“Why did you react so violently to the thought of Mycroft touching her, was it a jealousy thing or something else?”
Molly gave both of them a bottle of water. “Is everything okay? Did you two have a row? The tension is thick in here.”
“So what I’m hearing,” Liam stated as he sat in Mycroft's lap, “is John can judge other species, not just vampires.”
“Oh good, you’re awake. Let’s go, John! It’s morning and another present was left last night! Up! Up! We have to review the surveillance footage and open the gift!”
Exasperated John slowly got up from his seat, passing the notepad to Sherlock. “You’re right. No point at all. Look this over will ya? And I will search the internet.” John proceeded to his room taking his laptop.
It was very like John, cutting through all the niceties and getting straight to the heart of the matter. It was one reason Sherlock felt they were so well suited for one another. John’s ability to cut to the chase also allowed him to fill in all the blanks that Sherlock often left in his stories and explanations. And if John didn’t understand, well then he would say so. John loved him and thought of Sherlock’s home as being with him and Rosie. That just solved it for him, he had to get out of here. Preferably right now while the giant was out. But how? Sherlock smiled and stuck his hand in his pocket. The hair pin! John was so clever. He folded the two pieces of paper carefully and placed them in his pocket. He would have like to retrieve the other pictures Rosie had drawn for him and their violins, but he suspected his time was limited and he would need to leave it all behind.
Without a response, Sherlock moved off to do as asked. His mind was still preoccupied with the jarring changes John Watson had either induced in him or brought to his life.
“Well, John, if she was going to kill us she’d have done it already. And frankly I’m annoyed. Every time we get together it goes sideways.”
Sherlock’s mind was racing. He barely registered getting dressed. When he'd begun getting dressed this morning he'd abandoned the task part way through. He was sliding into his coat when Mrs Hudson walked in. “Woohoo’ Sher- aah! Is that an eye on the couch Sherlock?”
Sherlock continued to stare up at John in amazement. He knew enough about the world to know John was being very gracious and seemed to be one of a kind. Acting before he lost his nerve. Sherlock moved quickly pressing his lips to John’s. He wanted to tell the other man thank you for his kindness, and he’d be lying if he didn’t admit he was also curious about kissing, what was the fuss about? But this was Sherlock’s first kiss and he had no clue if he was doing it right. Wasn’t John suppose go kiss him back?
John watched as Sherlock paced over to the couch then dropped into it like a sack of potatoes. Sherlock was still wearing his jacket. It was odd seeing him in it, but he liked it. Even more odd was the fact that Sherlock hadn’t taken it off yet. Normally the first thing Sherlock did upon entering the flat was remove his scarf and then his coat, in that order like clockwork. But here Sherlock lay in his jacket like he hadn’t noticed.
“Oh, no reason really. While you were away a little blue bird flew inside and I realised I am going to die here. Possibly in this cage even.”
Sherlock looked at John even as he answered Lestrade, “Is that supposed to mean something? My true match could be a man.”
“If I’m going to be here more the least I can do is pull my own weight. I can cook and I shall. You do all the heavy lifting anyway,” he motioned towards Sherlock's head, “It's semi-fair.”
John looked up meeting the eyes of first Sherlock and then the rest of the room. “Otaktay. We were wondering how Eimile had known where we were-”
Sherlock cried, allowing himself to be comforted by John and reassured. He loved this man, and John Watson loved him back.
When they finally stopped it was at a small sandwich shop that Sherlock had never been to, but he was hungry now and had lost a lot of his patience along the way. He sat down at a table while John ordered them some food and chocolate.
“Why, what is it?” Sherlock inched closer to the box now on the kitchen table. The box was empty except for some writing on the bottom and expertly dribbled red paint. After taking a sniff Sherlock muttered, “Not paint.”
John could feel Sherlock’s sadness and the fact that he was uncomfortable with not knowing so he changed the subject. “You know who sent the package don’t you?”
“Because she supposedly knows nothing about the supernatural world, is unfamiliar with magic, all the different entities in this world yet she wasn’t scared of Hyde, she wasn’t curious or awed? She reacted as if she had seen his brand of species before.”
“Sherlock, you need your sleep, you’ve been running yourself ragged since you started the last case. Please get up and go get some rest.”
"Noooo. I could even feel his fear when I woke up. It was like I took advantage of him. I feel horrible about all of this."
“My wife. I’m the only one who can stop her. We should’ve put her down ages ago, but you know how it is when you love someone.”
John looked down at the pictures again. Quite honestly Sherlock had a good eye and was much better at all of this planning and coordinating than he was. "Surprisingly Sherlock, I don't care, I trust your judgement."
John tried to calm himself; when he was as calm as he thought he might get he left the bathroom. Sherlock surprised him when he rushed past him and into the now empty bathroom. John made a beeline for the bed, maybe he could be sleep by time Sherlock got done. And if he wasn’t he could pretend.
John looked stricken and turned to Liam waiting, needing him to deny what Alasdair had just said. When none came he fled quickly to his room.
John’s breathing was ragged. “No. But a moment longer and I would’ve had you beneath me. I’ll be back.” John moved as to kiss him again, but turned and left instead.
“No, I heard of John the old-fashioned way, by word of mouth. And although he too is family, through union, he is neither blood nor a vampire and I can not feel him. Lachlan was able to help me there.”
John placed a quick kiss on the top of Sherlock's nose and resumed the delicate task of opening him up. John carefully worked Sherlock open, kissing him and whispering all the things he wanted to do to him.
The two of them stood there awkwardly not saying anything. Sherlock had his hands in his pockets still and John kept his hands clasped behind his back.
“Mansi and I will patrol the perimeter. Get some rest John, maybe a nap will do you some good.” Delma and Mansi left out the room again.
Sherlock clung to John as he buried himself repeatedly inside him brushing over his prostate, and stimulating his trapped cock all in one swell swoop. He clung to John even as he saw the change in him, he went from considerate lover to a man seeking refuge. Something was wrong.
Liam interrupted with, “Okay but my question is why were you not equally as affected both times, no all three times? And why are they drawn to
“So what use were you to a giant who could come down here? Your ability to control the elements didn’t matter.”
“Let’s see if I got all the facts straight. First, you kiss John, he panics and runs off only to come back, he apologises and lets you kiss him again.”
“I suspect the killer grappled with his own sexuality and was targeting men who looked like him; in a sense, he was killing his own lust and desire for men.”
Sherlock had been casually plucking at his violin, but at Mycroft's words, he hit a sour note. “Excuse me?”
“Marry? Perhaps you are reading too much fantasy. I should bring you more non-fiction selections. I am your companion, and you need not marry.”
John left the room and headed for the back door. Since building quarters for the council, John had suggested the gym be moved in there so everyone had access to it. John checked the video monitors they had up in the garage showing the perimeter of the house. They added them in hindsight, they didn’t need anymore surprise factions landing on their doorsteps inviting the judge to come out and prove himself.
Sitting down again heavily Sherlock opened the aeroplane, absently stashing the hairpin in his pocket. The first thing he saw was a beautiful picture that Rosie must’ve drawn of John, herself and him. They looked so happy. Next he looked at the second paper fully expecting it to be another picture from Rosie, instead, it was a brief, no-nonsense letter, no more like a note rather, from John.
John shook his head and went searching for Sherlock’s bag. He followed the directions but found no bag, then he thought about the fact that Sherlock had longer legs and therefore his strides would be longer. John took 4 more steps and looked around, there pushed under a prickle bush. That had been smart of Sherlock, who ever tried getting the sack would get their hands all scratched up if they weren’t careful. John was careful and he had on his thick gloves, his hands were protected but the bush tore at the sack. When John finally got it free he was slightly out of breath. Not even bothering to look in the sack he gently picked it up and carried it back to the beanstalk. The bag was heavy and when he got close to the fire he sat the bag down and opened it. Inside was a small golden harp with the shape of a woman on it, and a small goose with some material tied around its beak.
Sherlock let out a low groan at the intimacy of Otaktay talking to him this in this fashion, and at his words that caused a small fire to ignite.
to death! Also, we have to bring Otaktay back!” John stormed off to the garage grabbing the keys for the convertible.
After several tense minutes the technicians started to file out of the flat, the moment the way was clear Sherlock bounded up the stairs to their flat.
Sherlock felt his insides tighten and his body jerk at John words and their hidden meaning. Sherlock tipped his face down just a fraction, running his lips over John’s.
Back in their room, the men lay in bed, their legs entwined and their bare upper angled away from one another so their bodies made a 'V’ shape.
John noticed when she glanced at the large monitor showing Hyde she didn’t so much as flinch. Although he did notice that Rayne’s lip curled up in a silent snarl and Lestrade patted her leg in attempt to calm her. So, Liam had been right.
Dream or afterlife aside his chest was burning where Rosie's hand rested. “Rose, could you remove your hand now bee?” Rosie did as requested.
“It’s okay, I guess. Sherlock should be able to be himself. Besides you still love him, he can’t be all bad.”
It was whispered so low it was nearly impossible to hear, but hear it he did. John felt that single word roll through his body, electrifying every nerve ending. He wanted to shout for joy! He wanted to pull Sherlock into his arms and kiss him senseless. John could neither act nor respond because right then the wedding march began playing. He watched as Sherlock squared his shoulders and cleared his face of all the vulnerability he'd just shown.
"Yeah, I know that now. But come on Sherlock. You want him. The reasons don't matter. Let's just try it and see what happens. Maybe I'll like it."
“I did believe in you, I was afraid for your well-being. Just as I believe in you now. And I am no less concerned for your well-being now than I was then, but I have seen you do a great many things John Watson and this is going to be like a walk in the park for you.”
John would have preferred to have waited until they were alone but he supposed since Sherlock called them all in there they all deserved to know what the commotion had all been about.
John didn’t feel like he was getting through, there was no echo or answering words or images from her. He redoubled his efforts.
John descended down the rope first, feeling the weight of the stranger’s eyes on him. Rosie started to descend above him. He’d gone first so in case she fell he could catch her or break her fall, but as he watched her he was struck by how deftly she moved. At the age of 6, she moved with the ease and confidence of someone who had been climbing all their life. That, however, did not stop John from taking the same precautions as they went down the beanstalk.
Sherlock leaned against the worktop watching while John cooked up a couple of omelettes for them. John was very efficient when it came to the mundane everyday things. It was one of the things that endeared Sherlock to him. He wasn’t an awkward, socially inept fool like himself. Normally John Watson was a confident, short-fused, socially competent member of society. He helped Sherlock in all his shortcomings. Sherlock just wasn’t good at all the social intricacies; making sure he was politically correct, plus trying to remember to emotionally and verbally hold people's hands so as not to hurt their feelings. It was all exhausting; Sherlock preferred to cut straight to the chase and not dilly dally around niceties. John was the only person in his short history that made him want to pause and think before blurting out what first popped up in his mind. And even in his desire to do so, Sherlock still apparently made heaps of mistakes; insulting John when he only meant to compliment. So on and so forth.
Now they were both rushing around trying to get ready for the wedding, they were in the wedding party they couldn’t be late. It was a bloody sunrise wedding, and right after would be the reception serving breakfast foods.
Several weeks later John was sitting in his favourite chair in their sitting room when a high pitch squeal rent the air followed by hysterical giggling. John smiled. Sherlock must be tickling Rosie again. Smiling he got up to investigate. “All right you two, what’s going on in here?” John opened the door and was surprised to see Sherlock wasn’t tickling Rosie, she was simply sitting on their bed and Sherlock was sitting cross-legged in front of her.
“And I would have missed out on a great thing. Sleep John.” Sherlock placed a kiss against John’s temple. “Je t’amie beaucoup.”
Sherlock had heard her, he turned to check and see if John had as well. He had, there was a playful twinkle in his eye.
Sherlock walked over to John and pulled him slowly into his arms as if he thought John would refuse him. “I’m sorry things didn’t work out with your commander. And I’m sorry he affected you the way he did. But if you want or you need me, I’m here.”
Sherlock was quiet for several minutes. John didn’t take it badly, he just kept reading his paper waiting for Sherlock to decide. He knew Sherlock often acted on impulses and whims, sometimes not thinking a situation all the way through. He imagined that Sherlock was now actually thinking the whole thing through. What it would mean for both of them. The changes that would come and the explanations. John sat the paper down and took Sherlock’s hand in his own. He didn’t say anything at first. He waited for Sherlock to look up from their hands to his face. “We don’t have to be. We don’t have to put a name to it. We can just be us.”
Sherlock had been settled down on the floor facing the Christmas tree thinking, it took him a moment to comprehend what John had said. “Yes, that’s true, what’s your point?”
Otaktay broke away first. “I know Sherlock is not a dream walker, but I still expect him to barge in at any moment and growl at me for being too close.”
Running a hand through his hair he looked away for a moment before he pressed on. "Tak, how did you feel about that?"
John wouldn’t mention it to the others but he was worried about Samantha. The fact that Alasdair was overcome with desire for Sherlock was proof that the Unhcegila was distressed. She was either hiding in plain sight from the mother or she was here against her will for the mother. Either way he felt she needed their help.
A knock sounded at the door. The men all looked at one another. Mansi and Delma were in the council’s quarters, Lestrade and Rayne were in the city and the rest of them was already here. Minus Otaktay and Hyde. John walked to the door with Sherlock right behind him. “Who is it?” he asked cautiously.
Realization hit John in the stomach and he deflated in his seat, slumping in his seat, this man must be Sherlock partner or worse case scenario husband. John was sure he could take him in a fight but he didn’t want any problems. And this man looked the sort to have other people do his dirty work. He hoped it didn’t come to that. “I uh, have none I suppose. What’s it to you?”
“Thank you, both of you. I will shower and gather some clean clothes from my room, while you two shower in here.”
“You mean, sort of like travel? There are multiple ways to reach your destination, all routes will get you there. Could you tell us what the determining factors are in this fight?”
“Why does your-” John paused to try to think of the right word, “I don’t know what to call it. But why does it only seem to make people attracted to Sherlock, why not any of the rest of us? Like why don't I suddenly become attracted to Mycroft or Liam to me or any number of combinations.”
“Good, good. I need you to feed and come back here. Speak to Mansi, tell her how you feel, that we all worry and miss her. Get her to come back to us. I fear I am not enough to coax her back. Alasdair, were you able to feel her?”
No one had heard from Hyde since he had given word to Liam that he was chasing a lead; that was until today.
“I think Otaktay has just gotten so used to being alone he doesn’t know how to be involved with a unit. He is also really big on facts. Maybe he holds out on us until he is sure of something, it just so happens by the time he is sure it is too late for himself.”
“John, that wasn’t necessary. When did you even have the time to put the gift there without me seeing?”
It was John who moaned this time as he relocated one of his hands to the small of Sherlock’s back, holding him closer. When they broke apart to breathe John murmured, “Christ Sherlock, I’ve waited so long for this.”
Sherlock noticed that John’s easygoing demeanour had changed since he agreed to not talk about work. He thought that would’ve made him happy. “John, have I done something wrong?”
Sherlock smiled at Mrs. Hudson and then looked up at Mycroft. “Thank you for showing me a bit of mercy.”
Ignoring the warning in John’s voice Sherlock said, “I need another set of eyes, come look at this. What do you see here?”
“Sherlock, will you really discuss this with the giant? Is there no other way? Maybe get rid of the beanstalk as you said you had done in the past?”
He could hear John on his mobile phone talking. But he realized it wasn't Lestrade. He could only be talking to Liam. Or maybe even Mycroft because he heard him ask if he could pop in and pop him back out.
John gave Liam an apologetic look and turned back to Hyde. “Yes, but as I was getting to, if certain rules don’t apply to them will the cure even work on them?”
Looking at Rosie he admitted out loud and to himself for the first time, “Yeah princess, I love him.” Rosie smiled at him, hugged him quickly and ran off to finish her dinner.
Upstairs Sherlock took pointe, Alasdair had intercepted them in the hallway and followed them into Mansi’s room. “Delma, love, we want to try something else to wake up sweet Mansi, okay?”
John chose not to study their budding relationship too closely, it was new and scary all on it’s own but once you factored in the fact that he had never had a same-sex relationship and Sherlock had never had any relationship, well then it just hit nightmare proportions.
“Nooo, Sherlock! I’m going to try to go back to sleep. You’re welcome to stay, I’m sure you’ve been up all night.”
It was now Sherlock's turn to be surprised, "Possibility?" He scoffed, "I guess if anyone could love my brother it would be you, John. You are a saint."
John was so shocked by Sherlock’s actions he didn’t say or do anything, he simply stood there while Sherlock gently kissed him. Sherlock was bloody kissing him. John panicked and stepped back bumping into the arm of Sherlock’s chair, nearly falling over it. “What- what are you doing?” John touched his fingers to his lips looking up at Sherlock with huge uncomprehending eyes, and then he bolted.
Sherlock laid on his back on the couch. He was in his flat and every now and again he would throw a small object into the air and catch it again. He was miserable. As impossible as it seemed he missed John. And his arm had been itching like crazy since the morning after the party. Every time he allowed himself to think about that night he berated himself all over again. Why had he fallen asleep? Why hadn’t he just given in and told the cute doctor he wanted him to stay the night? Why hadn’t he given John his number? He gave it to everyone else; he was a bloody fool. John had even attempted to clean him up, who does that?
Sherlock sat in the chair and watched as John cleared a patch of earth and set the kindling down. “Can you light it?”
The next night Sherlock was leaned up in a corner watching the room pretending to be drunk when he walked in. John Watson. He watched with apprehension and excitement as John looked around the room and then upon sporting him started towards him.
Sherlock hurriedly moved the bag with Molly and Greg to the trees where Rosie was hiding. “Do you know how to get home from here?” Rosie nodded with big eyes. “Course you do. Take this bag and run straight home, don’t stop no matter what you hear, understand?”
The man turned and looked at John giving a full and open friendly smile. His eyes were the color of grass and sparkled with mirth.
By the time Molly walked in just minutes later both men had settled back into their seats and was trying to focus on the work at hand.
Sherlock smiled at John. He had never told him his full name because it had never come up. “My full name is, William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
to be here, and he wasn’t here out of some perceived notion he had to be because they were friends. John wanted to have sex with him. That thought tightened things low in his body and made him feel even warmer.
“I don’t really think that would be the coup de grâce, more like when you passed your “judge locating” ability to me.”
“Agreed.” Liam said standing up. “I need to get back to my realm, I have traitors to flush out, coming John?”
Sherlock began gathering up his coat and scarf. John jumped into action gathering the pictures, notepad and his own jacket.
John licked his lips, he wanted to kiss Sherlock more at this moment than any other moment that he could remember. Refraining from doing so he simply stared at his bedmate. He’d always thought Sherlock gorgeous, but when he slept, all calm and not bouncing off walls, he was absolutely ethereal. John wanted to touch this untouchable beauty. He raised his hand, and just as he got up the nerve to reach over and touch him, Sherlock sat up quickly, with his eyes still closed he ripped off his pyjama shirt throwing it across the room. John watched as Sherlock plopped back down, he barely missed landing on John’s head. They were so close, in fact, Sherlock’s hair was tickling his nose.
John crushed his mouth to Sherlock’s once again, pumping his hips fast; every stroke driving the men closer to orgasm.
As John was pulling away Sherlock placed a shaky hand on his forearm stalling him. “You look horrible John, are you okay?”
“Yes, well, I wanted to know if the only reason you are going along with this couple business is so you can keep a better eye on me? Is this a case of you going above and beyond the call of friendship?”
Sherlock blinked slowly. So John wasn’t going to come. Well, he didn’t want to open the next clue or watch the video by himself, half the fun was having John to discuss the case with and the other half was having John stare up at him as if he was the most brilliant man to walk this planet. Sherlock decided to settle in beside John, perhaps he would allow him an hour more.
John took several deep breaths and then covered Mansi’s hand with his free hand so that hers was sandwiched between his two. Closing his eyes John went searching inside of Mansi. It was getting easier to detach his consciousness from his body and enter someone else.
Mycroft suddenly growled low; it sent a shiver through the room and before anyone could comment the duo was gone.
John stood up stretching. “Nope. Although I did find some leftover dark magic from his tie to Moriarty, I got rid of that bit. I sent magic to heal him, watched as it invaded every cell and every molecule of his body yet he remains in a comatose state. I don’t understand.”
“I know you didn’t hear a word I said, on account of you staring at John and all but maybe we should find our seats dear.”
“Well, look how level headed he is in spite of all of this, he's asking all the right questions and noticing things.”
John kissed Sherlock again, thrusting his tongue into the other's mouth, coaxing his tongue to come out and play. And when it did John sucked it, sucked as surely as if he was sucking on Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock moaned loudly and John eased one hand down the back of his trousers, rubbing his fingertip over his puckered entrance, pressing lightly. He thrust hard against Sherlock as he worked him opened. Both men moaning loudly.
Sherlock looked at John. He was definitely feeling better he was asking question after question, he was a natural born leader. He needed to ask him about his time in the war one day.
John’s eyes got big when he turned and looked at Sherlock. He had both hands over the bucket, but it was what was in the bucket that had caught John’s eye. In the bucket the water was suspended in the middle, touching none of the sides and it roughly held the shape of a small violin. The water was slowly taking shape and this baffled John for many different reasons. He could still see ripples flowing through the water so how can it look like it was solidifying? And then there was the matter of how it was suspended in the bucket; how it was being moulded; and how it appeared that Sherlock was the culprit.
Sherlock blushed at the compliment, he never got compliments from the giant, unless they were backhanded compliments that were actually meant to insult.
“Oh.” Sherlock wasn’t expecting that answer and the smile dropped from his face. John wanted to spend time with him?
“Lucky for us there aren’t any other families close by. And as honourable as your intentions are, we must do something about your feet. If we don’t you won’t last an hour.”
He’d never had someone as good looking as the man before show interest in him, it made John’s head reel. He shifted his hand from the man’s face to his curls, he had lovely, silky hair, it looked dark brown or black but when the light played in it John could see hints of red.
He wasn’t sleeping. He wasn’t eating, he was barely living. He had moved back into 221-B simply because he had nowhere else to go. He couldn’t live in his and Mary’s flat any longer. And Sherlock being the supportive rock that he was, offered him a home, a haven.
Otaktay responded back in kind, this was his native tongue after all. “I did not know at first, she fooled me. And then I wasn’t sure.”
“Why? If you didn’t want anyone in your business you wouldn’t have taken Sherlock’s hand. You two are causing quite a scene.”
Sherlock looked at Otaktay first then at John. "John,..." He stared into John's eyes for what seemed like hours before he could force himself to speak. "I love you, John. And
"Brother? I don't understand. Do you have more than-" John stopped speaking midsentence as he saw the Officiant pull off his black wig and fake moustache. "Son of a-"
The duo sat across from one another in Angelo’s, Sherlock had stated that he did some of his best thinking here. John was eating while Sherlock stared into space thinking.
“How could I? All I know of judges are what the lot of you have told me. And doesn’t it kind of make sense, you and Sherlock both said the prophecy said I will be the strongest judge ever.”
Sherlock was staring up at John with his sorrowful baby blue eyes. He looked at him with...with hope.
"Yes, John I suppose you should learn to take orders all over again and let others do the talking for you."
“How? I have an axe and a long saw but beanstalk is as thick as a tree, it would take hours to cut through. Not to mention it is frozen through and through.”
“Sherlock!” John hissed. “Fuck.” The people may appear to be alone but there could be a trap or anything waiting for them. John rushed after Sherlock but stopped in his tracks as he came face to face with the scene before them. A woman lay on a blue tarp, her hip hastily bandaged and he was betting it hadn’t been properly cleaned prior. Next to her, a man lay with his leg flayed open, no bandages covered his wound and last but not least. Sherlock was standing over the body of a man dressed like John. From the angle, John couldn’t see his face but he was guessing it was Major Sholto. He was dressed and laid out exactly like the picture they had received. “Sherlock!” John needed him to snap out of it and help him with the two on the tarp. Pulling out his phone he called Lestrade. “Found them. We need medical attention asap. Yeah, just come straight back.”
John closed his eyes and held fast to Sherlock’s hand as he settled in comfortably next to Otaktay on the bed.
The Unhcegila was a magical creature, maybe he could communicate with her in that manner. John went and stood underneath the big Elm tree in the back yard. That tree had seen so much bloodshed and pain, if it could speak John was sure it would be screaming. Sitting down John closed his eyes and concentrated. He thought of Samantha both as she had been when they had first met her and also as the Unhcegila. He formed her images in his mind and tried to speak to her.
Liam got Delma in and then placed Mansi next to her; he then got in and let Sherlock pass him Otaktay.
Sherlock’s hopes plummeted. He’d thought it would be explicitly obvious what he was on about. Apparently, John was being particularly obtuse today. He stepped forward, hands clasped tightly behind his back. “Happy Valentine’s Day John.”
Sherlock looked over his shoulder at the table and smiled, the table really came out nice. Looking back at John he realized, maybe he didn’t appreciate the effort in thought that had gone into the table after all. “Yes. Valentine’s day is often associated with hearts, so I used a real one to further cement the occasion. Matters of the heart, a human heart.” He gestured to the table behind him. “Anyways, I ordered us a hodge podge of food and thought after eating maybe you would like to take a stroll with me around London.” Sherlock looked down at his feet again, his nervousness getting the best of him. When no reply came from John, he looked up through the curtain of his curls to see John trying to work it all out. He knew John was clever, but sometimes he over thought things and got in his own way.
John waited until he felt Hyde and Samantha was far enough away then he spoke up. “Is it me or is Hyde like a totally new person?”
“Don’t be like that boo. I had to send Mymy away because there had been two attempts on his life recently and I don’t think I’ve caught everyone involved. Maybe John now would be a good time to come visit and see if you can judge fae as well as vampires.”
John continued to watch Sherlock and what he was doing inside the bucket, it was fascinating. “Well, unfortunately, I am a single father, her mother died shortly after she was born. And I am a farmer by profession. It’s hard work. The ground has been unforgiving as of late and hasn’t produced much. While I am out working the fields Rosie is supposed to be inside not up here learning the violin.”
John saw the way the man reacted, his eyes going wide at the contact, he mistakenly thought it was because Rosie was filthy and was getting dirt wall over his nice clothing. Gathering Rosie to him he admonished her gently, “Come now Rosie, we mustn’t dirty the nice man’s clothes.”
Sherlock smiled in spite of the ire rolling off John. “John love, not that the sex wasn’t brilliant, but knowing that your urges were caused by Samantha I didn’t want to take any chance. You did hear her say she could drive people mad.”
John stared at Sherlock dumbfounded, “Seriously? I didn’t. Why- What made you even come to this conclusion?”
“I know. Rayne called yesterday. She wanted to make sure Mansi and Delma were still around. I assured her that they were still here, they had moved into the council’s quarters.”
“Yes, I’m fine now move out the way.” Sherlock begrudgingly stepped to the side. “Where have you been Samantha? We were worried that you had been taken as well.”
John chuckled. There had been a steep learning curve in figuring out how to properly gauge the time difference between his new homeworld and theirs.
Sherlock blushed a bit at John’s words he knew what the shorter man meant and he had to admit it had felt nice being mindful of Molly’s feelings.
“Well, Sherlock, you see, Mummy wanted to arrange everything. But every person she suggested I shot down. I don’t want to be married, for convenience or love. The person I marry has to be compatible with my lifestyle and equally uninterested in an actual relationship.”
“Molly, you’ve done enough, sit, eat, we’ll handle this.” Molly smiled at John and sat picking up a sandwich she’d brought in. Lestrade went and stood next to Molly, making small talk. It was obvious to both himself and Sherlock that Greg was completely taken with Molly. And now that he was a divorcee he was free to pursue Molly.
“Do you really see her getting the drop on Mansi, Delma and Otaktay? Two council level vampires and a skin walker? Besides Delma said, the mother of death...who does that sound like to you?”
Gently John moved out of Sherlock’s grasp and looked away. How could he put this without making too big a deal out of it but at the same time not making light of the situation? Scratching his ear, something he often did when nervous or lying John looked at Sherlock finally. “Winter is upon us. Well, not yet, I know. But cold weather and icy conditions are. I- I can’t-”
John continued his chest press until his arms had the wobbly spaghetti feeling, he returned the bar to its housing and stood up going over to the leg press machine. Checking the amount of weight already on it, he decided to add 25 pounds more, taking the total to 100. He started his work out but after several reps, he became aware of Alasdair using the machine next to him. “What are you?” John asked keeping his head straight and his legs working.
“Of course Sherlock. She genuinely seems happy for us. But I do think we need to be considerate of her in the beginning, give her time to get used to the idea of us as a couple.”
"Bless these rings so that Sherlock and John may wear them with deep faith in each other. May they always live together in peace, love and abiding joy."
“The more of my bare skin that touch the earth the more access to magic I have, it’s also easier this way.”
John placed a kiss on Sherlock's temple before prodding him to get up. “We should wash properly and towel off. The water's grown cold, and you'll get all pruney.”
Sherlock grimaced. “No. Never say you subbed for anyone or anything to my brother. He has a wicked sense of humor.”
“Yes.” Sherlock whispered it but he thought he had yelled it. Everyone stopped their chattering to look at him. John took his hands and dropped back down in front of him.
John lay awake for a while longer staring at the man before him. He held Sherlock’s hand between them on the sheets. He was beautiful. Like this he looked so at peace and just beautiful. It was hard for John to think of any other words to describe this man. Having just met him he was sure there were things about him that he would not like, but the core of this man was beautiful. He put others before him rather he realised it or not. He had taken Rosie under his wing and kept her safe like a surrogate dad. He had risked himself to keep them safe when it would have been so much easier to let the giant have them. John’s heart bled for Sherlock, a man who had never known a simple kindness but offered it without expectations. The man so unaccustomed to kindness and friendship and hugs that he not only craved it, it scared him. But he faced his fears and asked what he wanted, said what he wanted. He was like a child in ways. When Sherlock had asked him to say his name it nearly broke his heart, knowing the reason for it had to be because he’d never heard his name spoken by someone who wanted nothing from him. Who didn’t hurt him. There was Rosie of course, but John knew first hand that children were in a different category than adults, then people you considered your peers. John wished he and Sherlock could have stayed awake talking too. It had been a long time since he had any adult conversation.
John’s mouth dropped opened. He scratched his brow and looked around like he was looking for someone to jump out and yell April Fools. But that was the wrong holiday. He hadn’t even realized it was Valentine’s Day, seeing how he had been single for quite a while now, he’d had no reason to keep track of or commemorate the day. Why on earth had Sherlock?
“Oh, well I didn’t think you’d be open to that sort of thing. Not necessarily because it’s a bloke I guess, but because you just don’t seem to be interested in a-” Lestrade stopped speaking as he looked at Sherlock and John. Bloody hell, it had been under his nose the whole bloody time. Sherlock was smitten with John. Now, rather John felt the same was to be seen. But John did follow Sherlock around like a lost puppy, he put up with Sherlock’s bad behaviour and did all his fetching. Maybe it was requited after all.
"Yes, it is true I find Sherlock more physically attractive, I'm drawn to your heart as well as your looks. Calling you little brother is also to help put Sherlock at ease. But I doubt he will ever trust me around you."
John smiled down at Sherlock, the man was obviously embarrassed but made no motion to move from John’s embrace. “No worries Sherlock. I don’t mind. We all need comfort from time to time.”
After dinner was a free for all. Most people continue to mingle with their dinner dates, some danced and others went to their rooms. John excused himself and made his way over to Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson, stopping to give Mrs. Hudson a kiss on the cheek.
Sherlock pulled away and grabbed the soap. “I do hate when my skin gets so dry. And if I recall correctly, we haven't visited our tree yet.”
“Ahh the world is just your play toy, and when you're tired of us, you just toss us to the side I see.”
John saw the tears anyways and rushed over to Sherlock’s side, sitting on the bench beside him. “What’s wrong? Are you hurt? Sherlock! Talk to me!”
Sherlock came awake to a delicious smell coming from the kitchen. John. He could get used to having the doctor home and to himself. A lot of times he didn’t eat simply because he couldn’t be bothered to make himself something.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand as he lowered his mouth as far down as he could go, allowing the head of Sherlock’s penis to tickle his uvula and cause him to gag lightly.
John kissed Sherlock in the middle of his back. “This is news. Bad news, but news all the same. The first bit of news about this situation since Rayne dropped that bombshell on us after the Moriarty situation.”
“John, doll, I know what you’re planning to do, and under normal circumstances I would think it would be a grand idea, but with the Dark Mother possibly out there, do you think it is wise?”
After several glorious minutes, Sherlock pulled firmly away from John, this time when he looked down at his companion he saw John was looking up at him with a serious look etched on his face. “What’s wrong?” He asked, noticing his voice had gone deep and gravelly. Clearing his throat he prepared to ask again.
Sherlock stared at John. He suddenly felt contempt for the man in front of him. And somewhere in the back of his mind, he recognised this as being wrong. Even before he'd loved John he never felt any negative feelings for the man.
The end of the song had John’s eyes snapping open staring at Sherlock. He stopped allowing himself to be lead around the room, just stared up at Sherlock. The song made a complete change, it crescendoed, tempo turning hurried, almost violent. There was an air of desperation and abandon to the song. And when the song ended suddenly it shook John to his core. He understood this song as if he had written it himself.
“She is a feared monster of my people. Unhcegila is a snake-like creature which  has been blamed  for many unexplained disappearances and deaths. But you say half, why?”
“Sherlock, you help me pass unseen with the morning fog, you keep people indoors with torrential downpours. You help grow crops for my salads. You make me ice for my drinks in the summer. You are beneficial.”
“Nonsense, he’s a man despite what else he is, he sees something he likes and he is going after it.”
“Rosamund Wilhelmina Watson,” Rosie said after Sherlock still grinning. “Wilhelmina is the fem-femin-feminine form of William.” The young child stumbled over the unfamiliar word.
Sherlock actually blushed, he learned a long time ago Mrs. Hudson saw far more than most people and she was tougher too.
“Look at it like this, taking a moment for yourself will clear your head and then you can tackle our problems from a different angle, a new, fresh perspective.”
“And Mary! I faked my death to protect you, I was gone for two years running from country to country, my life in danger getting shot at, tortured and when I got back, you were planning to marry her. I felt angry with the irony of it all.”
“He is wretched. It’s true that he doesn’t bother me directly and he leaves my area to me, but I have witnessed the things he does to his food before eating them. And he has a nasty penchant for getting rid of anything I become attached to, be it an animal or object. This is why I took great care in keeping Rosie-”
Sherlock smirked and looked at John; he noticed John was also smirking which meant he had picked up Otaktay’s mental curse.
After he finished stretching John dropped to the floor going into pushups. As an afterthought he wished he had brought along some music, it would have given him a reason not to talk to Alasdair.
“Oh.” After several minutes of silence, John kissed Sherlock on top of his head and said, “Goodnight Sherlock.”
John sighed as he removed his shirt. When he reached the other men he tossed his shirt over to Sherlock.
John stopped his leg press then, turning his head to face Alasdair and look him in the eye to gauge how truthful he was being. “
John came back with a huge blanket made of fur. And some shears. Sherlock watched as John set to work. He cut off a portion of the blanket and placed Sherlock’s foot on it. He measured out the right amount of fur for each foot and cut some cording he brought back as well.
Sherlock was leaning back against John's chest. He rarely took baths, but he had to admit, it was infinitely better bathing with John. “You must be pretty proud of yourself, hmm?”
“I must apologize for my clumsiness and also I wanted to say thank you for coming to my aid. All those other idiots simply stood around and watched.”
John stood up clearly angry. “Sherlock I will not  go back to that insipid party while the one person I want to be-” John suddenly went quiet realizing what he was about to blurt out.
Sherlock looked at the picture of the other person really for the first time. He noticed for the first time the environment and the condition of the person, he wasn’t quite sure if it was a man or woman. Sherlock thought he saw what John had to assume the person had been hurt. To be sure he put his hand out and John immediately put the magnifying glass in it. Holding it over the picture he focused on the visible features, the person was photographed at such an angle it was almost impossible to see the face.
John turned then and fixed Sherlock with a brilliant smile hoping it would lighten his comment and allay his lover's concerns.
Sherlock fished in his pocket and pulled out John’s phone, it was then that he realized Sherlock never gave it to him. “Sherlock.”
John watched with pride as his little girl held took the violin with confidence. Sherlock helped her adjust the bigger violin. And then Rosie was playing. Really playing, none of that sawing at the strings that he had witnessed in other players. She went off key a couple of times but it was beautiful nonetheless. He turned to thank Sherlock but saw the man was off little ways gathering water from a small teapot. He saw that the pot had a human sized hand crank that allowed him to fill a human-sized bucket with water. John rushed over and took the bucket from Sherlock who smiled his appreciation.
John’s face lit up as he pulled the Lakota warrior into a tight embrace. “Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
Sherlock thought about John’s words, really it made sense. “John, would that mean Alasdair is not to be trusted?”
John turned to look at Sherlock who was gripping his arm tightly, his eyes were closed tightly against the sight. John gently disengaged from Sherlock’s grip and took his hand. “Come on, let's go home and check on our little girl.”
Sherlock continued to frown as he watched the woman flirt with John, thankfully John didn’t seem all that keen.
Molly and John both looked up from their task. “What?” Sherlock asked, unsure what he’d done wrong. John gave him a smile and went back to work. Molly stared at him for a long while and seemed close to tears but eventually nodded her head vigorously.
Sherlock realised he was still holding the man's hand, John, he had said. Sherlock liked the feel of the man’s hand in his own. He’d also liked the huge, but they both gave him different feelings.
“You’re right. I mustn’t forget I am but your indentured slave, here to only do your bidding. There is nothing to keep me from throwing myself from this land and greeting the ground like an old friend.” The giant stood up, dressed impeccably as always, he scooped Sherlock up. “You have forced my hand Sherlock, I haven’t used your cage in years but now I fear for your safety.”
“It was your father who struggled with the alcoholism. And you entered the military to not only get away from but to try to prove yourself to him.”
“You’re right. You can use mine as I start on your new one.” Sherlock ruffled her blonde curls before he retrieved his violin and passed it on to her.
“I do.” Sherlock turned in John's arms and kissed him, taking his time to explore the delicious recesses of John's mouth.
Falling back into himself in a rush he opened his eyes and focused on Alasdair. “She is still with us, but barely. You can sense your kind, can you call them to you?”
John gave a nervous laugh and scratched the back of his neck. "Uh yeah, only the second time if you can believe that. We figured it's a bloody wedding; we should at least kiss. So we figured we need to become accustomed to doing so."
Sherlock turned to face the other man, “Because of the beanstalk. It wasn’t there. It had been destroyed when I was a little boy. I told the giant I couldn’t make another beanstalk grow this tall to try and keep him from going down and taking more people. And then one day Rosie walks in while the giant was out and she has returned every day for the past couple of months. When I asked her how she got here she said the plant rope. I got rid of the beanstalk several times, but once the giant saw it I couldn’t get rid of it without him becoming suspicious.”
John placed Rosie in the pot and then climbed in after her. He didn’t know what good it would do. The plant wasn’t much of a hiding place.
“True. You can't very well make it thunder twice once he leaves every day. Maybe we should limit our meetings down to once a week.”
“Fair enough, I guess the only thing we have to go on is I have been investigating cases that all seem to involve Moriarty and since I am a detective what other way to say hello, I see you then a mystery especially catered to me?”
“Maybe so, but Rosie can make the plants grow and not only cut your time in half but help it to be more fruitful.”
John ignored Sherlock's plea and continued to kiss him leisurely, slowly massaging him with a single finger. When Sherlock broke the kiss and glared at him, he chuckled. Allowing Sherlock’s leg to relax on the bed he got on his knees, as he watched Sherlock he opened the lube and squirted a little into his hand. He leaned forward bracing his weight on one arm and spread the lube with the other. Sherlock tensed as one beefy finger slid inside.
“I left my number written on the bathroom mirror. And while we are at it, why do you not have one writing instrument in your flat? Seriously not one!”
“I’ll call Lestrade and have him meet us,” John said as they made their way out the flat and down to the street.
John scoffed, tickling the hair on Sherlock's head. “I know what it means, but why? I mean James is not competition. That ship has sailed.”
John quickly dressed and gathered a couple of things in a bag. Grabbing a chair on the way out the door he motioned for Sherlock to follow him. “I’m going to get you set up at the beanstalk and come back with Rosie and some warm drink.”
"These two men have saved each other from a lifetime of loneliness, they have been each other's shelter in the storm and anchor in the sea. The love they share is apparent to everyone but themselves. Sherlock, John, I know you have each prepared your own vows, unbeknownst to you. Do care to share them with the rest of us?"
A loud squeal split the air as a blur flew across the room, Otaktay was lifted into the air in a tight embrace. John smiled as he watched Liam squeeze Otaktay and then drop him and pull Mansi into a hug just as fierce. Mycroft stood at the door, arms crossed stoically in front of him as if he was not pleased, John knew that he was.
“Yeah. No. Hell, I don’t know. I just dreamed about Otaktay.” John used air quotations when he said dream.
Sherlock’ hands were balled into the fabric of John’s shirt. The kiss was intense, Sherlock felt wide open like John could read his soul with every expert flip of his tongue.
But John wasn’t sure what to say after that? Part of him wanted to tell Sherlock if he didn’t love him too it was fine. But it wasn’t fine, it was just something people said. John balled up the paper and threw it in the wastebasket. Taking out another piece of paper he started again. Hand poised over the sheet he tried again to think what to say, he wanted to be eloquent in his words like Sherlock often was. He started to write.
“My ma held me inside her body as long as she could trying to protect me from the curse. She only gave birth to me when she was killed. The warrior that killed her thought she had eaten me and therefore freeing me.”
A moment later the three men and Hyde burst through the door; Liam and John were on Alasdair almost immediately.
“I’m here to help you, John. I am the man Hyde is searching for. Very few people knew for certain that I was even alive. Otaktay suspected it...”
John had noticed the man was walking straight now and no longer talked with a drunken slur. They had made it to a side street with benches that overlooked the river. He turned and looked at the man again, he really was good looking and impeccably dressed. “You’re not drunk are you?” he asked. The man pulled him over to the railing that kept people from falling down the embankment.
Samantha looked down at her feet coming across as bashful. John noticed Liam squint his eyes at her like he did when he wasn’t buying one of Sherlock’s or Mycroft’s stories.
Whirling Sherlock looked behind him to see what John was smiling about; Fíona was standing behind him. How in the world?
Back in the bedroom John turned all the lights off and climbed into the bed pulling Sherlock in against his chest.
“Well, as you said we really don’t have much to go on yet; I suppose we do need to wait until we get more information. But to be proactive about the whole thing I will set up surveillance and search the sitting room and stairs for clues.”
Sherlock was the last single man standing, as was Mrs. Hudson so they were paired together. That suited Sherlock just fine, Mrs. Hudson he could stomach, the same couldn’t have been said for any other woman whom he might have gotten stuck with.
John could feel his face go red. This gorgeous man, who could have his pick of anyone in the bar tonight had been staring at him? Wait- “Was
Lestrade clapped his hands, “Okay, now that we know who they are what do we do now? Were you given a way to contact him?”
John blushed under the intensity of Sherlock’s blue gaze. “You’re all Rosie has talked about, you and her lessons.” After a brief awkward silence John thought to add, “We would’ve come sooner but with the heavy rain I didn’t think it wise.”
Sherlock was unsure of how much time had passed but when John returned he had Rosie on his back and was carrying more supplies in both hands.
Rosie ran to the edge of the table and slid down the rope hanging there just like Sherlock had shown her.
John imagined wrapping his body protectively around the small golden twinkle. He spoke to it as if it was a small frightened child. He kept his voice soft and level, telling Mansi how proud he was of her, thanking her for her service. Relaying how worried everyone especially Delma was. He wanted to coax this small light into a full fledged fire. He felt responsible for this vampire. She was his guard and supposed to protect him yes, but he never wanted her to get hurt. Delma either.
“Mike Stamford. He invited me to the party that night. And Mike also knows D.I. Greg Lestrade who apparently supplies you with your caseload. So I asked this detective that I didn’t know, to call you making up a case just to get you down here.”
John sighed and buried his hand in Sherlock’s sheet, deepening the kiss. John marvelled in the knowledge he was kissing Sherlock Holmes, as their tongues touched tentatively, dancing together and away again.
This statement was accentuated by the distinct tremor of the beanstalk as the giant took hold of the beanstalk to descend. “WHAT’VE YOU DONE SHERLOCK? THE BEANSTALK IS HOT AND FEELS WEAK!”
Sherlock waited until John had snapped several pictures before lifting the vellum paper out followed by several sheets of tissue paper. Beneath the tissue paper, a gruesome sight awaited them. John almost dropped the phone while Sherlock stared down at what remained in the box. “Pass me the phone John.” Most people would think badly of John and his reaction to the boxes contents, they would argue he had been a doctor, sights as such shouldn’t bother him. But what most people failed to remember was John was an army doctor, he saw injuries that would pale the face of any seasoned surgeon and not only that, John himself had been injured while in the line of duty; had witnessed friends getting hurt and worse, dying. When John saw wounds, Sherlock was certain he flashed back to other wounds he had helped fix and even some he could do nothing for.
It wasn’t a question so John didn’t treat it like it was. He turned getting off the machine and stood to face Alasdair while he did butterfly curls. “How can you be both?”
“Nothing. Which I have come to learn that it means there is more than one outcome possible. A lot of determining factors.”
Mansi and Delma were settled in their room, Mycroft had fed Delma a couple pints of blood but there had been nothing they could do for Mansi, she wouldn't or couldn't swallow any blood given to her, she just lay there.  And now everyone else gathered around Otaktay in his borrowed room.
“I believe it to be a ploy of my dear wife. She met up with Sherlock and John at some point and has convinced them that she could help bring Mansi and Otaktay back. She gave them a vial of her blood, and they injected it into Mansi. I wouldn’t doubt if she has tried to poison them away from our little alliance.”
“I noticed Raynes instant dislike for Samantha when she walked in. I noticed she didn’t so much as concern herself with you Hyde.”
John couldn’t stand the naked, raw emotions he saw in Delma's eyes, she was terrified, and the love for Mansi apparent in her tear filled eyes. He wanted to try to reach Mansi, but he wasn’t sure if he could. He wished he had asked Otaktay instead of getting hot headed and rushing from his dream. John knew what Delma was feeling, if anything happened to Sherlock he would be prepared to offer even his life to save Sherlock’s if it would help.
Changing the subject John looked at Samantha, she was almost done with her food. “Hey Sam, what do you think of Alasdair?”
John climbed the stairs to his room. Sherlock’s mood had changed drastically, well it had been nice while it lasted. Laying on the bed John threaded his fingers behind his head thinking again about the day. There had been so many chances for him to tell Sherlock how he felt or even to make a move, to simply lean in and kiss him. Had it been one of the many women he’d dated in the past he would have just taken the chance, but with Sherlock it was different, he had to be sure, he didn’t want to ruin their friendship, work and living arrangements all because he had the misfortune of falling in love with his best friend.
John's concern only served to upset Sherlock more. To his extreme embarrassment, he began crying again.
Bloody hell, he loved Sherlock. He. Loved. Sherlock. The man made him laugh, made him want to choke him, made John inescapably happy. And he couldn’t, didn’t want to imagine life without Sherlock in it. He was like the glue that kept him and Rosie together. He and his daughter faired well before but Sherlock forced them to slow down and appreciate one another, take joy in the small things and to always learn something new.
Sherlock gave a nipple a lick before he half sat up and smirked at John. “You know I am quite aware of your reputation in the military as 4 continents Watson.”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and pulled him close. “So you found me out huh? Was it so obvious I wanted you to myself?” Sherlock joked as he tipped his face up.
John nervously got dressed. He was about to admit to Sherlock that he loved him. The man was so bloody brilliant, John was sure Sherlock already knew. Maybe Rosie wouldn’t be able to get the letter to him and John wouldn’t have to worry about Sherlock reaction.
His name was now a question on Sherlock's tongue, he loved to hear him say his name, but his goal was to hear Sherlock screaming it. John placed a gentle kiss against Sherlock’s ankle, swirling his tongue slowly around the small protruding bone. A gasp from Sherlock urged him on to repeat the same action on the opposite ankle. Experimenting with his lover's body likes and dislikes he bit down lightly, just above the bone and when Sherlock hissed but didn’t pull his leg away, he took that as a good sign. He took his time alternating between legs, kissing and nibbling, the quiet moans and breathy exhales made him giddy with desire.
Before Sherlock could answer someone called out, “Sherlock! Sherlock! Where are you, you bloody bastard?”
"Simple. You are of his line and he already shares a direct link with you. Both through blood and magic. I think he was able to manipulate you to act against your better judgement."
“There aren’t very many names on the list. Only about seven or so. Hopefully, our person is here.” Greg passed a list to the two other men in the room.
Sherlock couldn’t stop the moans from escaping as Otaktay gripped his hips tightly as he drove himself in and out of him. Sherlock was ashamed. He did want this. His body was already burning, the heat pooling in his middle. It wouldn’t be long before he painted John’s beautiful body with his seed. He reached out and began stroking himself. Before he was ready he cried out, coming all over John. But he still felt pent up, unsatisfied.
John heard Alasdair, heard the sincerity in his voice and still, John held a nugget of disbelief. How could someone be both a vampire and a lycanthrope? “Which one?” John asked instead.
The two men were quiet for several minutes, Sherlock’s eyes drifting close. John thought he was asleep until he blurted out sleepily,”What happened to Rosie’s mother?”
Sherlock opened one eye to look at John, instead of answering he yanked John’s towel loose so that it pooled around his knees.
“I don’t know.”Rayne looked sheepish as if her actions now embarrassed her. “I just had an overwhelming need to end her.”
John was quiet. He just couldn’t bring himself to think Alasdair could possibly be fooling him. Except for the Sherlock thing he had been so nice and helpful. In the back of his mind something Alasdair said himself came to mind
“Without turning to look at John Sherlock said, “This is John, my- partner. John, this man was just leaving.”
“No. Just you John, Otaktay, Rayne and Greg. Humans. And not really even, since I am only half Unhcegila I am not driven by the need for human flesh.”
This time Mrs. Hudson’s squeal and clapping didn’t go unnoticed, several people turned and looked at them. Mycroft got up from his table and went over to Sherlock. “What is all the commotion about?”
John tried one more time to disengage from Sherlock’s grasp, the man only held on tighter. Well, since he was stuck he might as well sleep in and enjoy the comfort.
John watched slack-jawed as Sherlock stroked both of them slowly. He knew Sherlock and knew he was testing some sort of theory his mind, and he wasn’t really here in the bed with him. Hesitantly he reached out his own hand, knocking away Sherlock's and began to stroke his bedmate. The way Sherlock’s body suddenly jerked John thought he had somehow managed to hurt him. “You all right Sherlock?”
I got mixed reviews the last time something like this happened in the first part of the story. Some loved it, some hated it. I myself had mixed feelings. As I do now. but there are certain forces at play here and apparently, this just needs to play out, for better or for worse. We'll take this journey together.
“No, but you do. And if something happens to him I know you’ll be upset and I don’t like that.” Sherlock let his fingers trail up and down John’s arms. “You know it is one of the things I love most about you. You care so much. About everyone. And you never make me question the love you have for me.” Sherlock placed a kiss to John’s forehead. “As much as I love your ability to make me feel loved and wanted, what’s  going on with you? The stunt you pulled yesterday?” When John didn’t speak up Sherlock gave him another kiss. “I’m not angry and the sex was amazing as usual. But you...you went from zero to a hundred in like 2 seconds. And then you had to
Mycroft grinned and showed Liam the phone, it read “Gotcha!” repeatedly across the screen. Liam playfully hit Mycroft in the arm and then leaned in kissing him to the soundtrack of the others laughing in the background.
"I heard him tell Alasdair that he did as he was told. He'd slept with me several times and believed I was now more pliant."
Sometimes the two of them slept over and on those nights Sherlock and John talked through the night. Adult to adult. They covered every subject their joint minds could think of, confiding in one another about secrets and fears. The two men had become very close and it was not uncommon for one or the other to wake up and find they had fallen asleep in the other’s arms.
Rosie hopped up passing her picture to her dada. “Yes! I need to put on warm clothes, all the clothes so I can fly it up to Papa Sherlock. But you will have to hold me on your shoulders so I’m higher up.”
This was nice, sitting all domestic like eating and chatting it up. Without putting too much thought into his actions Sherlock swung his feet up and placed them in John’s lap.
“It’s finally stopped snowing again. If it doesn’t snow again Papa Sherlock might be able to come down.”
“I mean, I skated when I was a kid, I thought this was one of those things you never forget how to do?”
Sherlock came back out now fully dressed and feeling more confident. John was reading the paper and he was scowling like he often did when he was deep in thought. Sherlock thought it was very John and cute, dare he admit it. Forcing himself to walk past the scowling doctor he opened a drawer in the desk and pulled out a couple of left-over surveillance cameras. He had found them in the flat roughly six months ago. Sherlock was sure his brother was the one to thank for this generous donation of three state-of-the-art security cameras now reconfigured to transmit video directly to John’s laptop instead of some remote unknown location. Sherlock smiled, thinking about how pissed his brother must have been when he realized Sherlock had found and disconnected the cameras.
, he thought. Leaving his own towel in place, John bent and retrieved the lotion from his bag. Turning back to Sherlock he wiggled the bottle at him.
“Ever hear of a playwright named Shakespeare?” When Sherlock gave Alasdair a completely unbelieving look he continued, “Yeah not that guy.”
Turning to gesture to the woman at the door he introduced her to everyone. “She is from the states, like me if you haven’t guessed. She is a minor judge.”
John groaned clearly exasperated. He went on his tippy toes and kissed Sherlock. “No. I believe she could if she wanted to, but she just stared at me and let me figure it out on my own.”
“Exactly!” Sherlock exclaimed, “Exactly like that, only you were gentler in your need of me. You also didn’t fight it.”
Sherlock got that funny feeling in his stomach every time John walked through the door. His heart clenched every time Rosie ran up and gave him a hug. He had never had friends or family or anyone before them but how was he supposed to go back to not having anyone after just becoming accustomed to having them? It was a question he wished he didn’t have to answer.
When Sherlock pulled away, he was pleased to see John's eyes were closed, and he had a goofy half smile on his face. He leaned in and kissed him again, placing a hand on the side of John’s face, caressing.
“Um, Happy Valentine’s Day.” Sherlock beamed at him and pulled out a chair in front of one place setting, gesturing for him to sit down, John did.
Sherlock ran a hand up and down John’s back. “Agreed. I don’t feel he poses a threat but I don’t trust him, nor can I let my guard down around him.” After a pause, Sherlock added, “But I suppose that’s on account of how good looking he is and how afraid I am of losing you.”
Sherlock frowned. “Obviously something was off about it, besides the matter of you dreaming about Otaktay in the first place.”
“Oh, that? I paid the bartender to set me up with the empty items before the bar opened. Look, I’m very sorry, I made the first move I shouldn’t have...I just wouldn’t have forgiven myself had I not. I-”
"I hid valves away. So we wouldn't have to start from scratch in case something like this were to happen."
He loved the way his name sounded coming from John’s lips, all quiet, almost whispered. He wanted to hear it again. “John, say my name again.”
“Okay. Sherlock is a vampire, but a good one, he doesn't kill humans and he treats’em fair like. John, is the vampire judge and I'm to be his apprentice.”
Sherlock rested his forehead against John’s breathing in his expelled air, feeling slightly lightheaded. After a moment he pulled away and started pushing John’s jacket off. “We promised my brother to get out of these wet clothes like proper adults, we really should keep our promise.”
Each of them had taken a prosthetic and was searching for the owner in the database. John and Sherlock were actually sharing responsibility for the steel rods since those would be harder to track down. John already knew who the eye belong to and all pertinent current information they were able to get from Lestrade. They just needed to identify the other two.
Sherlock could feel how still John had gone, he was sure if he’d done something unwanted John would’ve said something, so he continued placing small chaste kisses on John’s neck and shoulder. One hand came up to join in on the exploration. Slowly traversing from John’s side up past his shoulders to slide through his short gold and silver speckled strands.
"Otaktay, I know I have no right to ask this of you, you've given so much, but I- we need you back in the real world. Will you come?" As John looked at Otaktay waiting for an answer the medicine man started to fade away. Panicked John grasped at Otaktay's rapidly form but stumbled on empty air.
John took the cue he was given and guided the head of his cock to Sherlock's entrance. Breaking the kiss he wanted to look into Sherlock's eyes as he sank into him for the first time. Slowly, agonisingly slow, John pushed into Sherlock, relishing in the way his mouth slowly parted on a gasp, his hands tightening on his biceps. Holding eye contact, John whispered, “I love you Sherlock Holmes” and thrust the rest of the way home.
Sherlock couldn't believe what John had done. And judging by the look on their warrior friend he couldn't either. "John…"
“I am not worried about that John, I am only worried about keeping you and Rosie safe. And any other people around here.”
There was a tap on his shoulder and he looked up, Rosie was standing there and she was looking at both he and John. He had grown to know the little tyke as well and she was up to something. She had that gleam in her eye, the one she always had before trying something nefarious. Maybe nefarious was too strong a word but he knew his little Rosie was about to drop a bomb. His little Rosie? Who was he kidding? He cared for the little girl, probably even long before he realised she was a package deal with the man sitting beside him.
Sherlock looked at John in shock. “It’s more than fair. You contribute to the solving of the cases just as much as I do.”
John was taken aback by Sherlock's tirade. He moved to stand by Mycroft, "What makes you think he is offering me money?"
The quiet in the room was strained for several long minutes. Finally, Otaktay let out a deep shuddering breath and turned in Sherlock's arms so that his face was buried in his chest. Sherlock stiffened as he realised the medicine man was crying.
John and Sherlock got up and walked to the sitting room to greet Liam. John pulled his lively friend into a hug. “How is everything?” Sherlock asked clapping Liam on the back.
“At one point I thought everyone could but I still believe she can. Even if it isn’t a common skill.”
Sherlock lay where John had deposited him. He was tired and worn out. He watched through half closed eyes as John stormed into the bathroom. Sounds of John masturbating soon reached his ears. This was another first for them. They both always reached completion. Almost ten minutes later he heard John bellow his release. Sherlock smiled sleepily, his John was so sexy.
Sherlock sat staring after John long after he had disappeared. What had just happened? John was trying to tell him something, he was sure of it, but what exactly was he getting at? He brushed it aside long enough to untangle himself from his spot on the floor and retreat to his room. He needed to review the list John gave him but first he had a call to make.
“Okay! Okay, Mike, you win, just stop with the bloody pattering.” John took another deep drink of his ale. “This place isn't very good, is it?”
John’s heart plummeted. Sherlock didn’t want him here, he was more concerned with the fake case John had thrown together to get him here. “It turns out we have a mutual friend, and that friend and you also have a mutual friend.”
. I do believe somewhere in the back of your mind you believe Alasdair may have faked his reaction to me. That he wasn’t really driven to temptation.”
“Wait!” Lestrade yelled, “Did I miss something? When did this happen? You two have said repeatedly you weren’t an item. You don’t just go from not an item to will you marry me.”
Seeing that Otaktay wasn’t in the room John went to check on Sherlock and that was where he found Otaktay, sitting on the edge of the bed staring at Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his hips up, dragging another moan from John, “Well then she better get use to hearing us.” Sherlock wrapped one leg around John’s waist, “More John, please I need mo-mmmm, yes!”
John lightly hit Sherlock on his arm, “No, not creepy. Go, you need to give Mansi the blood; please be mindful of Alasdair. I’ll start here.”
Immediate squealing and clapping ensued from Molly and Mrs. Hudson. John kissed Sherlock for the first time in front of everyone.
John smiled to himself and placed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. “You have nothing to worry about Sherlock. You are the only one I want. You know me, you’ve been there for and with me through all the craziness.”
As soon as Sherlock had his jacket off John started unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, pushing both his jacket and shirt off in one fell swoop. Sherlock returned the favor by unbuttoning and removing John’s shirt.
Rayne went to stand up but Lestrade grabbed her hand holding her back. No one else made a move to get up so Mycroft did huffing as he went.
The lights were still on. John wasn’t sure if he wanted to get up and turn off the lights or stay to ensure his spot and the proximity to a sleeping Sherlock. Comfort finally won out. He would never get any sleep with the light on and they had an early day tomorrow. John clambered out of bed, turned the lights off and as he was laying back down he heard a sleepy “Thank you.” That wanker, you could never tell just how lucid he was, even under normal circumstances.
They finished their meal in silence, Sherlock brooding over whatever he was brooding over and John reading the paper.
“No. She is to serve as a back-up in the event you can’t judge. Also, her base of operations will be in the states. Other judges will start to pop up from all over and will need to come here to meet you.”
“No time, I have to get to the front desk. They've messed up our reservation.” John continued on to the front desk.
Sherlock stopped eating and looked up at John through his lashes. John never really jumped at working cases. He was usually more concerned with keeping them safe and only became more invested when he knew exactly what was at stake. They had yet to find out the stakes, so this helped to further cement the idea that John was behind this case, not Moriarty. “John, did you fabricate this case as a gift to me?”
Sherlock slid his hands up John's back, pressing his fingertips in just lightly. “I do believe you're doing an excellent job as it stands, let's go with your idea.”
Sherlock got up slowly, a little hurt that John didn’t like the heart, he thought it had been a nice touch, bringing a bit of realism. Picking up the platter he placed it in the refrigerator. Turning around he saw the look of derision John shot him, “I’ll, uh- take care of that later.”
, or Crazy Buffalo, answered him. He cursed my mom’s offspring to live in both worlds and to drive people mad with jealousy, desire, and love.”
love with you Sherlock Holmes.” John paused knowing Sherlock would need a moment to digest what he’d just said. “I know I reacted badly at first, but I was really caught off guard. I am doing all of this because I love you and it makes me happy to do it. To be here with you, able to reach out and take your hand, to touch your hair, to kiss you. And in time hopefully, we’ll be able to be together in every sense of the word. I am in no rush to get there, we’ll take as much time as you need.”
For once Sherlock bit his tongue and left it up to John if he wanted to tell Lestrade about his shared private history with Sholto.
Sherlock began walking away from the group, he needed to get away and think. Sherlock walked with no destination in mind. When he looked up he saw he had somehow made his way to a secluded seating area in the back of the property. It was very romantic for lack of a better word. There was a man-made waterfall with lattice work benches and it was all surrounded by expertly planted foliage so that the area was completely closed in.
“You were lied too! My wife approached you didn’t she! That’s her blood; I can smell her. That blood, her blood, will kill your guard.”
Otaktay looked at the two men on the bed placed his fist over his heart and bowed his head before leaving the room.
“Yeah, I suppose both parties do. They both deserve happiness and I think they found it in each other.”
“I don’t know. That’s how I felt too. Like all of a sudden, I had to have you and it couldn’t wait. My body was on fire, I was in pain. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock had to sit down. The kiss and John’s words had him feeling dizzy. His stomach suddenly felt like a rodent was running around on a play wheel. Walking over to the couch Sherlock dropped into it hard, pulling his legs up beneath him. He would wait for John here.
Sherlock jerked at the first feel of John’s thick fingers opening him up. This is what he needed, what he craved. His John worshipping his body, making him feel loved and wanted. As if reading his mind, and he very well could have, John slipped between his thighs again, his cock nudging his entrance. “Mmm, I love being with you Sherlock, I love touching you, hearing you, feeling you clench around me.” John pushed all the way in, taking Sherlock’s face between his hands, “I love
John could see Sherlock was lost in thought and it wasn’t about a case. After plating their omelettes John stepped over to where Sherlock was standing and slipped his arms around his waist, resting his chin against his back. He felt Sherlock stiffen, maybe he was moving to fast for the brilliant detective. “You alright Sherlock?”
Tears were falling down John’s face and that terrified Sherlock even more. He was positive that John wasn’t physically hurt, but something was wrong nonetheless. He eased out of the bed, quickly going to the bathroom to retrieve a warm flannel to clean them up. Once done he climbed back in the bed and pulled John to him. Sherlock held him as he cried, until he fell asleep, emotionally spent. It was hours before sleep claimed him as well, his mind was racing, he just
“That’s preposterous! Lover? I can barely tolerate people long enough to solve a case let alone have a lover. Who was this man, what did he look like?”
“No sir.” Samantha stood up and Mycroft walked around her. He looked over to Liam who was openly scowling. Finally he lifted his hands to touch her and Liam shouted across the table, “No! Don’t touch her Mycroft! Don’t you dare.” Mycroft’s eyes got big at Liam’s unwarranted outburst. Raising his hands he walked over to Liam and they very quietly debated while both Mansi and Delma took their turns. When they were done Lestrade got up. He walked over to their guest and leaned on the table in front of where she stood. “Rayne, come here.” Rayne gracefully got out of her chair and walked over to Lestrade. “Yes Love?”
Sherlock smiled to himself. How did he get so lucky to find and woo John? Liam had been correct when he said they were destined for each other, no other would be able to replace John.
John laughed. In retaliation he straddled Sherlock’s midsection while he started on the other hand and arm. He could feel the slight vibration of Sherlock’s almost silent hum.
Sherlock sat on the side of the bed watching John watch him with so much desire it made his blood hot. "I want to apologise John. I do believe this is worse than the incident at the club."
John was in his head, “Sherlock get her out of here or us cause I’m burning again. Hotter this time. So hot. I love you and I need to be in you
John mental laughter washed over Sherlock calming his fraying nerves. John was right; this could only help Otaktay and the group. He just couldn’t believe his kind and gentle love had told Otaktay he was their weakest link. Funny that he had been thinking the same thing earlier. “Alright well, showers all around and then bed.”
Sherlock turned, tears in his eyes, soul laid bare. He would take John’s condemnation head on, he was sure this was all he was deserving of anyways.
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at John and then smiled to show he was just joking. Sherlock pulled the bow apart and lifted the top off of the box. Directly inside was the next line of the song.
He had on his aubergine button up and a pair of black trousers, he been told in no uncertain terms by John that he looked quite handsome in this particular ensemble. He’d even mussed his hair and unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt, he wanted to be as appealing to John as possible. Just in case he was making a complete arse of himself.
John was taken aback by her question. He hadn’t allowed himself to dwell on the implications of Sherlock’s words of comfort to Rosie. Or how they made him feel. He could admit that all of the emotional exchanges left him with a “what if” feeling.
“Alright, Sherlock, to start I just want you to sit next to me, don’t share your power with me unless I ask.” Sherlock nodded his understanding and John looked over to Liam, “And you, same thing. If you feel me start to siphon too much of your power leave the building. I don’t know the reach of my power but if I start doing that…” Turning back to Sherlock. “If I need your help I will try to tell you one way or another before I do it, but just as I told Liam, if I take too much leave. Immediately.”
Sherlock seemed to think about that, after a moment he stood up and approached John at the desk. “Show me.”
The duo walked down the street no destination in mind, John was surprised when he felt Sherlock slide his hand into his. He didn’t comment, in fact, he didn’t acknowledge the action in any way. It was nice, he didn’t want to mess it up.
John was leaning forward, he had Mansi’s hand clasped in his own. Delma sat beside Mansi on the bed, she held Mansi’s other hand tightly as she silently cried.
Sherlock looked up at his big brother, they fought a lot but when it counted they were there for each other. He loved his brother and he was happy his brother had found someone and truly hoped he would be happy with Lestrade.
“Everyone is at the reception but us. Let's go shall we?” Mycroft hooked his hand around Lestrade’s arm and they walked toward the great room that was holding the reception. Sherlock’s parents, Molly and Mrs. Hudson all started forward as well.
“Well, Mrs hip replacement was put out of the army for misconduct. A soldier under her command reported he had been sexually harassed and her counter-story was that they were in a mutual relationship. And Mr steel rods retired but he had several blemishes on his records. Several men and women reported that he made passes at them. A man and a woman both claimed to have been sexually assaulted by him and another handful that claimed he made inappropriate remarks around and to them.”
“And sticky.” John abandoned his thrusting to kiss Sherlock slowly through his orgasm. When Sherlock was boneless against him, tucking his head into the crook of John’s neck, he began driving into Sherlock again. His thighs burned with the effort of holding Sherlock and thrusting into him, his arms felt numb, but still he moved, chasing his own orgasm. John didn’t even feel marginally close. Frustrated he pulled out of Sherlock, sweeping him up in his arms and laying him on the bed.
“Uh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.” Greg knew Sherlock wouldn’t be calling him if everything had gone smoothly so he asked, “And how did John react?”
Sherlock reached in pulling out the pictures. The first picture showed John and Sherlock walking hand in hand, it was from their walk the day before. Sherlock was staring straight ahead while John looked up at Sherlock. If Sherlock had seen this look on anyone else's face he would have immediately deduced that that person was completely and utterly besotted. So- Sherlock glanced quickly at John, did this mean John was besotted with him?
The next day came sooner than both men wanted. They had lain in bed holding one another, lightly touching, stolen kisses and caresses until they both had fallen asleep.
The ringing subsided and the world no longer looked like it had been brought into a sharp focus. “Sherlock, what happened?”
Clearing his throat Sherlock dropped the man's hand. “I guess you two should be going before my master comes back.”
Mycroft waved a dismissive hand at John. " No, I meant this whole facade. I hate when my mother gets an idea and sinks her teeth into it."
Again John shook his head. Yup, the man was mad, beautiful but mad. His thoughts gave him pause. When had he decided the man was beautiful? Shrugging it off he turned to Rosie, “Well, madam, let me hear it.”
His voice caught on the words and he had to turn his face away quickly when he stood up. Taking Rosie’s hand he walked them to the door. As Rosie started for the beanstalk Sherlock spoke without looking at John, if I do not find a way to be with you two, I will look for you on Spring's first thaw. Go and be careful on the way down.”
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “Despite the fact that you make me called you daddy, I am no child and I grow lonely up here. I would like to meet some possibly a companion, marry even.”
Mycroft stood in front of Samantha, he stared at her. After a moment he walked around to her other side of her chair. “Do you mind standing up?”
John was sure he’d had only a couple hours of sleep when he felt Sherlock stirring next to him. “Are you all right?” he mumbled.
“John?” Sherlock hated the sound of his voice right now, it sounded weak and uncertain. “What did Mrs Hudson say?”
John looked at Sherlock, he no longer wasted time questioning him how he knew what he was thinking, he just took it as gospel, it saved time and headaches. “No, it is. And before you say it, I know had it not been Major Sholto it would have been someone else and we would still be right here where we are. But if not for my association with the two of you he would be safe.”
you it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know you would defend me. Mycroft is the one that surprised me.”
John circled around the table and dropped onto the couch beside Sherlock shaking as he reached for the eye.
“No, the only thing missing is the physical intimacy. And maybe the acknowledgement of the relationship.”
Otaktay held on to Sherlock like he was a man drowning and Sherlock was the only lifeboat. He tried to pull away while he still had a shred of dignity but Sherlock chased his mouth, keeping them fused together. He moaned. He tried so hard to hide how good it felt to be held again and kissed like he mattered.
“Yeah, that was what I was trying to figure out. Otaktay, I believe Ms. Samantha should go home.”  Sherlock said as John began nuzzling his neck.
John stripped down to his pants and climbed into Sherlock’s bed. He laid on his back with his hands tucked beneath his head. Sherlock stared at him for a long moment before he started to strip down himself. But when he got to his trousers he blushed a bit and excused himself snatching up his pyjama bottoms and escaping to the bathroom. John chuckled because he wouldn’t have thought Sherlock was shy. When Sherlock returned and turned off the lights John held out his arms.
“The fact that you cut off the bartender before he could finish asking, and the fact that you offered it to a regular at the bar shows that you are very strict with your alcohol intake. That kind of discipline usually comes from seeing a loved one battle alcoholism.”
“It wasn’t until recently that Alasdair did something questionable. He tried attacking Sherlock, sexually, he blamed it on Samantha, but she was in range to affect him. And he also knocked the syringe of blood from Sherlock’s hand, it was Fíona’s blood, and it was what woke up Mansi.”
“I didn't ask Sherlock because he has been helping me in here and I may have weakened him. Same as Liam even though he was not in here with me, I believe there is a chance I could have siphoned magic and or power from him.”
John turns to see if the drunk man needs any help but sees he is surrounded by plenty of would-be suitors. Shrugging it off John walks back over to the bar and drops some bills next to his unfinished drink and walks out.
John gave a low needy groan right before capturing Sherlock’s lips. Thrusting his tongue past Sherlock’s lips he plundered the space, licking, sucking coaxing Sherlock to kiss him back just as fervently.
“As did I. Well, no, she touched me when I first found her in real life. She punched my arm in greeting.” Otaktay added.
After several long moments John continued, “Otaktay told me he wasn’t waking up because he didn’t want to. The bastard had the nerve to thank me for healing him.”
“You keep presuming to know- dear god!” John had bit down on his ear and thrust against him in one smooth motion cutting off Sherlock’s retort.
As John walked the woman over he tried to get some sort of impression from her, considering he was an empath he should be picking up something, he wasn't. Looking over to her he said, “I guess I do owe you an apology for that. It
“Yeah, I get that. I’m sorry my nerves get the best of me and effect y’all the way it does. It’s why I live alone.”
Sholto’s voice hit John hard. Part of him had thought Moriarty had killed him, especially with the way Sherlock kept staring at him. “Yeah James. Are you hurt?”
Sherlock looked up sharply, “Really? I’ll help on the farm and teach Rosie and pull my weight, I promise!”
Sherlock smiled tentatively, he wanted nothing more than to pull John into a hug, and even though John was touching him in a familiar way he didn’t want to scare him off. “Moriarty doesn’t let me out or leave the house at all. The only way I can think to send you any sort of signal letting you know the coast is clear is with the weather. But Moriarty is wicked smart, he is sure to catch on.”
“Yes, were you expecting someone else? I could go…” John panicked, he had taken a gamble and he hoped Sherlock wasn’t as callous as everyone seemed to think he was. Please don’t let him send me away, John prayed urgently in his head.
Alasdair stared at the duo as a tear ran down his cheek. “I don’t understand; her blood has always had destructive powers.”
Looking back on it all, he supposes it was a sign, he should have just left Mary right then and there and told Sherlock how he felt. But once he got over his anger, there was still fear to be conquered. What if Sherlock
“So, yes several months now. She is a bright young pupil, but how did you not know she was sneaking off?”
“Then what do you staring at me in the bar have anything to do with knowing alcoholism runs in my family and all of that?”
John slipped his hand into Sherlock's and slowly backed out of the room pulling the vampire with him. Once they were in John’s old room he closed the door and pushed Sherlock up against it kissing him quickly.
John came down the next morning intending to have himself some breakfast, but all thoughts off food fled his mind when he caught sight of Sherlock sitting in front of the tree. He was sitting cross-legged with the sheets from his bed haphazardly thrown about him. John would put money on it that Sherlock was completely nude beneath. Clearing his throat John walked closer, “Um, Sherlock, is everything alright?”
After another 45 minutes or John stood up again, first checking on Rosie and then going to the pile of supplies he brought with him. He pulled free a cross saw and stand between Rosie and Sherlock he began to saw at beanstalk. There would have been more room had he stood on the other side of the stalk but he wouldn’t be able to keep an eye on their hands.
Sherlock wasted no time pulling out his phone and dialing Lestrade. “Get over to Twist and Shout right away. I have our guy. What?! Of course, I’m sure. Just get over here.” Sherlock hung up his phone and shoved it in his coat pocket roughly.
Molly smiled at everyone. “Me too. Goodnight, can’t wait to see everyone all dressed up tomorrow.” Lestrade and Molly walked away and Mycroft walked up again but this time he was with his parents. “Everyone is heading to bed. You two delinquents, I hope you don’t stay up all night and disappoint everyone by being late for the wedding.”
Sherlock had climbed on the bed and into John’s arms. John’s words had been delivered against Sherlock’s temple.
John almost lost his concentration when he felt Sherlock’s head hit his lap. “You really like laying like that, don’t you?” He asked.
He sat down on one of the benches thinking. If he was going to be honest with himself and he should be, he was in love with John. Had probably been so since the beginning, all of the uncomfortable situations he put John in with his dates, all the times he faked an emergency just to cause problems for him and his girlfriends. All the times he found himself staring at his best friend and thinking to himself how lucky he was to have him as a friend. It wasn’t enough for Sherlock. He was far too jealous for it to simply be friendship between John and himself.
“Pity, had he, you would’ve seen what I mean. Don’t get me wrong John, Sherlock can be quite charming when he's on a case but when he isn’t he can be- himself.”
Mycroft walked into his brother's flat without announcing his presence. They often left the door wide open and today was no different. John and Sherlock were haunched over a book; their shoulders brushed one another and their heads nearly touched. John pointed at something and looked up at Sherlock as he spoke. When Sherlock met his gaze, they stared at one another as if transfixed and unable to look away. Mycroft watched, waiting to see what would happen. John leaned in a little, so close Mycroft was sure his breath was ghosting over Sherlock's slightly parted lips. Just when he thought his brother might lean into John, he cleared his throat. They quickly moved apart. John greeted him at the door with a quick kiss on the lips. Mycroft closed his eyes and imagined it was Greg Lestrade. When he'd opened his eyes again, Sherlock was already walking away, heading to his room. "Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. As you know, I was in the area and figured I would just stop in and see how things were going. Is Sherlock behaving?"
John stepped up. “Sorry Samantha, Sherlock is not always good with people, especially new people he has to warm up to them a bit first. Just ask Otaktay. Even though Otaktay had helped to save my life Sherlock just couldn’t take a shine to him. Now they're friends. Give us a shot.”
Sherlock took an obligatory sip and then passed it back. He had no time for drinking he needed to take the beanstalk down.
“It’s like your subconscious is working in the background, when your self preservation trigger is tripped your subconscious analyzes the situation and whatever it is in you that causes these urges are initiated giving you the chance to get away. One more question about this, I think. What we were told about your kind is that you can cause desire or rage in others. We have only seen desire, why is that?”
John smiled into Sherlock’s hair. “No, of course not. I’m doing it because- I’m doing this because I love you.”
John smiled at Sherlock’s request. As a doctor and his friend John hated when Sherlock took any sort of drugs be it mild like sleeping pills or more serious like heroin. He figured there was nothing wrong with placating his friend's sleepy request. “Sherlock.”
John gave a sad smile. “Happy actually. That means while he was getting himself off with you he wished it was me. Now look, I'm sorry you've had to find out about he and I this way and that Sherlock didn't have the decency to invite you in and explain it to you, but I won't allow you to try and insult me in my own home. I sincerely wish you the best, now good day.” John positioned himself between Sherlock and the man, gesturing for the man to leave. John became uneasy, and a shiver ran down his spine when the man straightened up and gave a smile. The feeling of familiarity was back with a vengeance. “Do I know you from somewhere?” John asked.
he was sneaking out of the wedding early. Mary had told him she was doing it because she was ordered to. She was helping to burn the heart out of Sherlock. She then smiled like she was proud of herself. She raised her gun to shoot who- he would never know because he shot her first. Sherlock had just stood there frozen in shock, and John had acted on instinct. He would not allow this woman to take Sherlock away from him again or anything else, no more lies, no more deceit. He was through.
And then in a blink, Alasdair had one hand to the side of his head grunting in obvious pain, he was still holding Sherlock immobile against the wall. John lifted a hand and a pulse of power breathed through the room and sent Alasdair flying hitting the opposite wall.
“Well, you two missed lunch and mummy couldn’t focus constantly looking for you. She had got herself all worked up thinking you had gone and found yourself a case. This weekend of all weekends.”
“Nonsense John, I am not unreasonable. I know as he is your friend, he still has some of your affection. But sit down, let’s discuss these items. You are my biggest clue on this one.”
Whirling around, now feeling angry again Sherlock yelled up at the giant, “Why do you even keep me here? I am no use to you just a cheap parlour trick. Let me go and make my way in the world, I beseech you.”
Sherlock saw John take a step back, probably trying to get out of his way, but he advanced further, quickly stepping into John he lowered his head and kissed him. Sherlock’s mind blanked and all he could do was take in every sensation of his lips touching John’s, his hands on John’s shoulders. John shaking.
Samantha glared up at Sherlock. "Anyways, he didn't even try to deny it. And I suppose he thought he was calming me down by saying it wasn't hard for him because at least I was easy on the eyes and good in the sack. Not his exact words, he said it much more eloquently. So I punched him in the face and tried to sleep on the couch."
Shocked John nearly dropped his spoon at the contact. When Sherlock just kept right on eating he did the same, absently stroking an ankle.
John couldn’t believe he was doing this. He was kissing Sherlock and he wanted more, oh, so much more. Burying a hand in Sherlock's silken locks he deepened the kiss, sliding his tongue past Sherlock’s lips, sweeping inside, tasting the wine Sherlock had claimed only minutes before and something else, perhaps the natural sweetness of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock berated himself for getting his hopes up, John didn’t mean what he’d hoped he meant by his words; he simply meant that all the people at the wedding were boring and he much preferred the company of his best friend. Nothing more, just John being a good friend.
“I take notice Sherlock, you are all very beautiful in your own way. If some of you had not been pledged to another I may have even made a pass.”
John looked at Sherlock, his eyes full of gratitude. “I’m not afraid that I won’t succeed, Sherlock, I’m afraid of what I will find, or that there may be nothing I can do for him.”
Liam looked at John sideways and took a slight step away, “John, since when have you been able to read minds?”
John gave a soft sigh before answering. “I haven’t really given it any real thought yet. you know, with threat after threat.”
Lestrade smiled at Mycroft and Mycroft gave him a nervous tight lipped one back. Lestrade took his hand, “You aren’t having second thoughts now are you?”
know I care about Otaktay, but I don't love him." John squeezed his hand, offering unspoken support and understanding. "With that being said, I do find my curiosity piqued about him sexually. Not because you aren't enough for me John. Simply because the seed has been planted and it has taken root."
Sherlock could hear the regret in John’s voice, furthermore, he heard what he hadn’t said. He would miss him. John would miss Sherlock enough to contemplate visiting Sherlock without endangering Rosie. But in the end, John was a father and a good one at that so he couldn’t leave his young daughter alone while he was off- off what?” Sherlock had read enough books to know that they were at an impasse. They were friends with not so platonic interest in one another. Sherlock suspected it was not only new for him but also for John. John who had married and had a child with a woman. They were at the point in their relationship where you either crossed that line and became more than just friends or you built a wall to keep you just as friends.
John quietly sat about starting his day. Grabbing clothes and shoes he went downstairs to have a shower and he was needing to get to the clinic and put in a leave of absence. He didn’t want to quit in case he and Sherlock’s working arrangements didn’t work out. Once dressed John grabbed his laptop opening it up while he sipped a cup of coffee. He knew Sherlock would want to review the surveillance together but he was getting ready to leave and he couldn’t do so with a clear mind until he'd made sure Moriarty hadn’t left any dangerous surprises behind.
"It is with great honour I present to you for the first time as a married couple Sherlock Holmes-Watson and John Watson-Holmes!"
Mycroft pulled Sherlock into an uncharacteristic hug, before pulling away he whispered, “Your turn Sherlock. Make an honest man out of John.” With his arm still around Sherlock he turned Sherlock to face John, nodding in his direction. “Don’t let that one get away brother mine, he is something special.”
Sherlock looked down at the small girl before him she was cute he supposed. He really wasn’t sure. But she had certainly grown on him over the past couple of months. He had begun to become fearful of his master finding the little person and eating her whole. He wasn’t even sure how she had found this place. But since she continued to show up he decided to teach her something useful.
“Okay, you also stated earlier that there weren’t many first generation vampires left, how many is not that many?” This question from John again.
Sherlock reached and touched the spot on his face and flinched, it was tender. “I’m okay, but thank you.”
"I think this fresh air is doing me a bit of good. I'm thinking more clearly." Sherlock covered John's hand with his own and placed a kiss in the centre of his palm.
Hyde stood up gathering the dishes and taking them to the sink and rinsing them quickly. “I’ll wash these in the morning.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone and sent a text to Liam, Rayne, and Mycroft notifying them that Alasdair was there.
John sighed as he felt the weight of the bed dip down behind him and the feel of arms slide across his waist. After just a moment John stiffened, this wasn’t right. Sherlock was slender, whoever was holding him was curvy, like a woman. John was about to turn around when Sherlock shouted, “I’ll be there in a moment John, keep your knickers on.”
Sherlock hopped up from the bed and looked down at the two men seated there. This was crazy. Preposterous. John didn't want Otaktay in their bed. He knew this like he knew he would never give up John. "No."
When Sherlock woke up the next morning it took him a moment to remember that he’d gone to bed the night before with John holding him. His current situation was quite different. John was on his stomach facing away from him, and he was flush against the shorter man with both his leg and arm wrapped around John. It almost looked like John was wearing Sherlock like a coat.
Horrified Sherlock turned his back to the small crowd and wiped furiously at his eyes. "It's just allergies, all these flowers you know?"
John took the man’s hand and swung up onto the tabletop, scooping up Rosie and darted after the man. He led them over to a potted plant that was sitting on the table.
Sherlock made sure his back was to Otaktay before he allowed John to see him rolling his eyes. They should be making love tonight after such a triumphant day, but instead, they were babysitting. He snuggled in close against John, giving him his back so he could hold Otaktay as promised.
Sherlock woke up an hour or so later cocooned in warmth. It took him several long moments to remember he had guests and it was the arms of one guest that held him tightly. It was nice; it made Sherlock feel safe, warm and cared for. He relaxed into John’s embrace, with his head tucked under John’s chin he wrapped his one free arm around John’s middle, his hand resting on Rosie’s arm he went back to sleep.
“I would have you here, right now; why do I want you so much? Gods, but I will take it if I have to.”
“Well, he told me he was actually an old timer, a dream walker and medicine man. You’re Liam, right? He said you were the fae king, as in a fairy. Mycroft,” She looked at the group of men and pointed at Sherlock, “is the ex-council leader and one of the oldest vampires in existence.”
"Great actually! We were just trying to iron out some of the last details. I have to go pick up the rings tomorrow, and you'll be needing to go by Sky Garden and finish paying for the ceremony."
John smiled to himself as he dug out the bottle of lotion he had brought with him. Then thinking better of it he placed it back into his bag.
“Oh, I don’t know. You know we’ve known each other for quite a few years and have been through a lot. Music helps me deal with the emotions I can’t or aren’t ready to process.”
Without thinking, or rather only thinking of comforting John Sherlock reached out a hand, resting it on the side of John’s face. His fingertips burrowed shallowly in John’s short blonde hair while his thumb lightly caressed his cheek. “I am so sorry John. She was a fool. If she couldn’t see how special you and Rosie are it is her lost and I hope she lives long enough to realise the error of her ways.”
John plated their food and sat one plate in front of Sherlock, stealing a quick kiss as he did. “Are you alright Sherlock? What's gotten into you?”
Sherlock dared a look in John’s direction, he looked confused and slightly scared. He checked back on his creation and then looked up to Rosie, she was still playing the song he taught her. She was a remarkable study. He gave her a smile of encouragement.
Things only got worse over time. The gap between Sherlock and himself. John suspected they were both to be blamed, Sherlock needed space because he couldn’t stand to see John with anyone else. And he, because he couldn’t stand to see himself not with Sherlock.
“Alright everyone, that is our cue to end the night's festivities, let these two lovely ladies properly get reacquainted. Goodnight everyone.” John leaned over and placed a kiss to Mansi’s temple and left out dragging Sherlock behind him. They stood in the hall and waited as everyone took their turn telling their “youngest” member goodnight. John took notice of how Samantha and Hyde stood closer to one another, more than he remembered ever seeing them do previously. He also took notice of how Otaktay stood away from the group. Holding on to Sherlock’s hand John beckoned Otaktay over. “Once again, goodnight everyone.” John walked hand and hand with Sherlock and Otaktay until they made it back to the house and their room. Shortly afterwards he heard Samantha and Hyde enter the house and head past their door and down to the basement room.
John knew Sherlock well enough to know he had regressed to their previous topic. He passed Sherlock the picture noticing when Sherlock slid the picture of them between the sheet and his chest. He would have liked to get a better look at that picture as well.
John stared at the stranger. “Extraordinary. Although, my father didn’t struggle, not in the least, he embraced it. Mind if we talk about something else?”
. So was it possible, that because of the fact that judges didn't come about until several years after the inclusion of vampires and shapeshifters into this world that Judges are not capable of judging them?
The trio was in the room talking with Mansi and Delma when Alasdair, Hyde, and Samantha walked in. John looked down at his watch, it was getting late, but they hadn’t been particularly loud. He watched Alasdair’s face as he walked in. The ancient vamp kept his face neutral showing no emotion. But Samantha and Hyde, however, were easy to read. Samantha laughed and clapped her hands; she even hugged the two newly awakened. Whereas Hyde looked confused.
Lestrade tsked at him before continuing. “I am assuming you two discussed the case a bit before he brought up you kissing him.”
Sherlock sat quietly for several long moments, turning the theory over and over in his mind. And to his horror, he felt a trickle of truth to John's words.
Sherlock leaned forward watching as Mycroft also leaned forward in giddy anticipation of a battle of deductions. Smiling he simply replied, “Pssh, I see the way you watch Gavin Lestrade when you think no one else is looking. Is it him? He is newly single.” Sherlock saw the look of surprise pass over his brothers face.
John laughed at not only Sherlock's joke but the sheer look of indignation that John would dare ask him again if this was a joke. John just couldn’t fathom Sherlock being serious, he suddenly grew a heart and professed his love? Just seemed fishy. They ate in silence for a while until Sherlock spoke up.
"Don't be. Thank you." Sherlock whispered the words and pulled away. Louder he said, "This is why you are the judge. Wise in so many ways. Loving to a fault, I don't deserve you."
“Mmm, and what point might that be love?” John's words were low and slightly slurred as if he was falling asleep.
John must have seen the change come over Sherlock for he said, "You know what, nevermind. I will call Lestrade and have him pick me up." John hopped off the wall and started walking away from Sherlock. He had no clue where he was but there had to be a road close by.
John chuckled. “I think I'm the only one who needs to think of a coming out strategy. I’ve denied it for so long and to everyone I’m sure I’ll come off as a hypocrite.”
Sherlock's hands fluttered at John’s shoulders as he moaned a low yes. John chuckled before dipping his head again nibbling across Sherlock’s clavicle and over to the other ear. He licked slowly along the shell before whispering, “I’m going to make love to your mind as much as your body, I’m going to drive you so crazy with need you’re going to be begging me to take you.”
The next couple of hours flew by with Sherlock explaining how he worked with the elements. John was fascinated with the whole process and ability.
“Yes! If it wasn’t for all your wrong idea’s helping me to rule out the clearly absurd I would waste precious time dismissing them myself.”
“I don’t know Liam, Sherlock and I have started christening those rooms too, the empty ones at least. I’ll make sure you get one we haven’t been in Samantha.”
“Kind of you to ask John, but I am very comfortable, your jacket is nice, warm. It’s like being hugged while I’m laying here.”
"That's why I wanted to tell y'all that that bastard was outside ya door. What if he made Otaktay wanna have sex with y'all?"
John sat staring at his laptop. It was an email from Hyde, of all people. John had finally given into the idea that the man had fled all responsibility and disappeared. He hadn’t thought the lycanthrope was the type and he was happy to see this email proved John right.
The sleepy quality of John's voice was fading and Sherlock couldn’t help himself. Blindly he reached out and ran his fingers over John’s lips. “I like the way you sound when you first wake up.” “You don’t sound too bad yourself, and I have always like the way you looked when you woke up, curls all stuck to your head on one side and wild on the other. My hands always itched to run through them, to try and take them.”
John simply nodded his head unable to formulate any words to this oracular genius. But as usual, he need not say anything, Sherlock was capable of speaking for them both.
Sherlock mimicked the giant silently as he left the house. And just because he couldn’t help himself he played out a quick sharp tune and thunder sounded in the distance. From somewhere below he heard “Sheeeeeerlock!” A warning from the giant. Sherlock smiled. It made him feel better to test the giant on occasion.
The man turned and looked John fully in the eyes. Oh, he was definitely a toff, he was wearing a three-piece suit in the middle of a pub. He even carried an umbrella, a fancy jacket hanging over his arm.
John quickly released himself from his trousers and pants, standing up he entered Sherlock with a hard thrust. Sherlock wasn’t nearly wet enough and it hurt a little for the both of them.
Sherlock watched as Otaktay thought it over. He was happy he was taking the question seriously and giving it some thought but he was kind of apprehensive about his answer. Plus, he knew John would be asking him the same questions and he honestly wasn't sure what his answer would be.
After only maybe fifteen or twenty minutes both Sherlock and Otaktay had fallen asleep. John ran his fingers lightly over each man where he touched, finally allowing himself to think about the situation for himself. He was now alone in his own head with his own emotions and he knew in the morning there would be an upheaval of feelings so best that he came to terms with whatever he was feeling now.
John in the meantime retrieved the newspaper from the kitchen table. Sitting back down in his chair he proceeded to comb through the paper looking for any mention of missing persons, deaths or John Does. And now that he was thinking about it, perhaps they could ask Lestrade about any new weird or unsolved murders or kidnappings.
“Well, think about it. Everyone here is something that goes bump in the night, even me. Why should we lock her up for being different? She hasn’t hurt anyone.”
John smiled at Sherlock. “I think also you may feel that way Sherlock because of the fact that you don’t get any vibes from either of them. Plus you’re practical.”
John was looking through the rest of his emails as he answered, “Nope. Not since last week. Once a week Sherlock, you know that is the arrangement.”
Sherlock saw stars behind his eyes. He hadn’t even realised he’d closed them. Blindly he reached out a hand and gave a small sigh when John entwined their fingers. John was both his anchor and the fevered sea tossing him along. Peeking between his lashes he was rewarded with the sight of John looking up lovingly while he sucked on his cock.
“Bloody hell!” John exclaimed as he fell for the umpteenth time that morning. “No, no, don’t help me I’ll get the hang of it again soon enough.” John watched as Sherlock gracefully skated a circle around him and then stopped within inches of him with his hand out. Sighing John gave in and took the offered hand.
“Have you all lost your bloody minds?” This came from Lestrade, “You’re all acting like a cat whose territory has been invaded by another cat.”
Sherlock’s mind scrambled to comprehend what John was telling him. This was not what he had expected to hear.
Allowing his consciousness to search inside of Mansi was not unlike his experience with Sherlock. The main difference and he guess the biggest and most important difference was the spark of life. Sure in Otaktay proof of life was everywhere, in his flowing blood, his beating heart. But in Sherlock there was a bright pale light all around, no source was evident. A coolness in Sherlock that he assumed was his life force. Even without the beating heart and flowing blood that cool spark was what let John know Sherlock was alive. Here in Mansi there was nothing, almost like being in space on the far side of the moon no light, nothing.
“Just as you and John share a bond so do my husband and I. Somethings trickle over by accident and others he lets me see, gloating. He has grown confident in my idle ways. He is sure I will do nothing to stop him.”
John glanced around the room, there wasn’t even a couch for him to sleep on. “What choice do we have?”
“Despite everything, I’m glad we came out. Just the two of us. But let’s get home and unwrap this mystery.”
Sherlock knew he had to be red in the face, Mrs Hudson had heard them; he thought she was supposed to be out of town, visiting her sister.
The beanstalk gave an ominous wobble with his first movements. He looked over to Sherlock, he didn’t like what he saw there, Sherlock was red in the face but around his eyes was drawn and hallowed. So instead of asking Sherlock if it was okay to keep cutting he just did. They needed to finish this now.
Sherlock called John a third time. But just as John was turning around to look at him someone appeared and then immediately disappeared with John.
Otaktay wanted comforting but he wasn't sure he wanted it from either of these men. Or men, in general, he was just really conflicted right now. In the end, his loneliness and solitude won out and he came in under John's arm, facing him and Sherlock's back. Even now, part of him wanted to reach out and run a finger down the smoothness of Sherlock's back. How could he both want him and despise the act?
“No! You didn’t just speak to me, you called me to you. I had no choice but to come to you. How did you do that?” Samantha’s voice was getting shrill and hysterical. Her voice had drawn the attention of the others, with their super speed each of the vampires were by his side instantly, Sherlock standing between Samantha and himself.
Grabbing the afghan from the back of the couch John covered Sherlock’s sleeping form with it. Deciding to do something useful instead of staring at Sherlock, John put the food away and then set about making them some breakfast. If this was to be his new duty while working strictly with Sherlock he could live with that. At least this way John could keep a closer eye on Sherlock's eating habits.
The next morning John woke up to the smell of coffee brewing. John stood up stretching, realizing he’d spent the entire night in the chair and Sherlock had finished decorating the tree. It was magnificent. John stood there several minutes just taking in the sheer splendour of their Christmas tree. Sherlock had gone all out. There were lights, and bulbs, glass icicles, and ornaments. Finally getting his fill of the tree he turned to enter the kitchen only to find Sherlock standing there sipping on a cup of his own. “Good morning Sherlock. The tree came out really well. You truly outdid yourself.”
Alasdair gave a nod and John left, heading back to the house and to Sherlock, he needed the comfort only Sherlock could provide.
“This is- this is hard Sherlock! How am I supposed to make the right decision? We have been told many things about Fíona, from not just Alasdair but Mycroft, Liam, Hyde and Rayne. How can they all be wrong? What about you and your research?”
“Sorry daddy,” John could hear the disgust and derision in the man’s voice, although he was beating this giant was no relation to the man.
“Oh, you know, tense. So many of the fae don’t approve of me. Some are fine with me because of the power I bring and more still are tolerant of me but not Mycroft. I’ve even had to make examples of some fae who have made attempts on either myself or Mycroft.” Liam collapsed on the couch throwing a leg over the arm. “I miss this place.” he pouted as he looked around. Suddenly Mycroft appeared on the couch next to Liam, pulling him into his arms.
Sherlock could feel the heat from John’s body radiating beneath the covers. He had taken two of John’s pills but he still couldn’t see himself falling asleep anytime soon. John shifted. The bed was so small their shoulders brushed and Sherlock inhaled sharply.
Mike stood up patting John on the shoulder. “You’re rather resourceful, I’m sure you’ll figure this out.” Mike started to walk out of the pub when John called out to him.
Lestrade inclined his head and headed out the door. They had taken additional pictures of each baggie and also of the 2nd and 3rd gift boxes and gave it all to Lestrade minus the picture of them together Sherlock still had that secreted away. And when Lestrade had asked about a second picture Sherlock simply said, “Second picture? There was only one, I just assumed Moriarty didn’t know how to count.”
Fíona smiled benevolently, “Something more. Remember my family was amongst some of the strongest druids. Take care of your family.” Fíona disappeared.
Lestrade and a group of men burst in. Some were medical professionals and some were part of Lestrade’s team ready to dissect the scene. John informed the medical personnel of each of the victim's injuries. He spotted Sherlock back by Sholto. They didn’t appear to be talking but Sherlock didn’t need to talk to get information. John made his way over to them. “James.”
! I’m sorry Sherlock, I’m so bloody sorry! The weight of it all, how can you still stand? How can you still stand me? I put you through so much, I’ve-”
Sherlock pulled a chair over to the bed, sitting down he took John’s hand. “What would you have me do?”
John took a deep breath, he had to do this. John pictured himself surrounded by the white healing light of magic, he called more of it to him, picturing it pooling in their clasped hands. John felt the hot and cold pulse of magic in his hand, guiding their hands over he placed them directly over Otaktay’s heart. Sherlock placed a kiss to his temple and he swelled with love for the man behind him. Suddenly the magic pulsed hotter and stronger, helping John to just let all his worries fall away. He shoved the magic into Otaktay’s body and followed behind it searching out the cause of his comatose state. John decided to approach the situation differently than he did last time with Sherlock, that time he searched the body for any abnormalities, this time he was going straight for the heart. But not just the physical heart, John wanted to find what equated to the soul. He was sure that was where most of Otaktay's problems lay.
“There you are! Your mother told me you were off hiding with John. And speaking of John, that woman’s scream at pulling John's ticket was just indecent wasn’t it? How are you handling today?”
Rayne took a step back and slid her hand into Lestrade’s, “Let’s go sexy.” Lestrade stood and followed Rayne out of the room.
John nodded. “No more wasting time.” John lowered his head, taking Sherlock’s mouth again in a gentle kiss as his hand explored his body. John took immense pleasure in not only the feel of Sherlock beneath him but the quiet sounds he was coaxing out of him. John kissed his way across Sherlock’s jaw, running the tip of his tongue around the shell of his ear. Sherlock shuddered in his embrace, gripping tightly to John’s shoulders.
John turned to Sherlock, they had never kissed or shared any physically intimate moments before today, and their first kiss would be as a married couple. The gravity of this moment was not lost on him, and he could see panic still swimming in Sherlock's eyes. He placed a calming hand against Sherlock's cheek, he held eye contact as he pressed forward, pulling Sherlock into their first kiss. It wasn't a steamy hot kiss that would give the guest a glimpse into the honeymoon night. It was chaste and gentle, a mere pressing of the lips and yet it still took both their breaths away. John regrettably pulled away, searching Sherlock's face as he did.
The next couple of days were strained at best. Alasdair sent Lachlan away, stating there was no need for the soft-hearted vampire and no need to tempt the rewiring that John had done to make him so.
John returned his attention to Sherlock’s waiting hole, licking at it with the flat of his tongue, once, twice and then he thrust his tongue in. Sherlock was so tight.
Sherlock nodded his appreciation to Otakaty. He would have defended John himself, but it always went over better when someone other than himself did it.
John sat up, squeezing another healthy dose of lube into his hand he spread across his shaft. “Are you sure Sherlock, I don't want to hurt you, and it is our first time.”
"Sherlock, don't look at me like that. We don't know if Alasdair can or has been controlling you. And before you argue, I know you don't like to think anyone can best you, but your genetic makeup may be working against you in this instance."
John stumbled back several steps, eyes wide, “What?! I can’t dream walk, you must be the one dream walking.”
