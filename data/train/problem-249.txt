"Fingerprints," he said. "DNA. Dental records. Trying to get some idea who is he, where he's from."
"John, I–"
, who had so often worked on no food or drink, who had subjected himself to drugging on a regular basis, for whom this had been normal
The first time he and Sherlock been to Dublin, John had been half expecting to stay with Irene, something that had puzzled Sherlock to no end.
"Mary then," John said.
The elder Holmes smiled, a genuine smile with no small hint of glee.
regret later.
Gabriel raised his eyebrows, Cheryl mirroring his expression, and Sherlock allowed himself a small, put-upon sigh.
And the flat still stood empty.
be ready? The speech?”
"All right, all right, you win," he said with a grin and Sandra gave a triumphant "ha!". "Pass me the dish towel."
"The human mind is remarkably adaptable, John."
She smiled a small but heartfelt smile.
"Don't be. We've all lost people – soldiers generally more so than most. But you're in a hospital and I don't want you to worry about that. Let me– well let me tell you about my name, since we might share one. I was named after my dad; his name was John, too. His father's name was Harold, so my parents named my sister Harriet after him, but my great grandfather's name was also John. He was a doctor, too, back when treatments I use daily without thinking about them were new or not discovered yet."
Without clients being allowed to call, there were fewer cases available, and those that came via email or by the post were summarily dismissed. Part of John considered that getting new tenants for Mrs. Hudson's flat would help – although he couldn't imagine that anyone would stand up to an interview with Sherlock Holmes right now.
"Great," John muttered, tendons on the backs of his hands jutting out as he rubbed his palms together roughly. "That really narrows it down, doesn't it? Between Richard Douglas and Charles Adair, we might as well interview the entire planet."
"Yeah, right," Harry muttered, waving her fork at him. "He was dragging you off on a case when I got here."
John rolled his eyes.
"I don't want it," Sherlock said shortly.
John nodded, making a note of that.
And he hadn't meant to be, John thought. He hadn't. All those years they'd been together, John knew who his husband was. Sherlock was wrong – John didn't want him to change, not in the way Sherlock thought. Relationships changed people all the time. Looking back now, he could see how much Sherlock had grown since they'd first gotten together, but he could see it in himself, too. He wasn't the same person. He couldn't be. Nor was Sherlock. But John didn't think he had fundamentally changed. He still valued what made him
“And when you were in the army and were required to leave the base, did you do so alone, without a protective detail? Or were you accompanied by an armed guard?”
"No. Sorry."
"And you're absolutely sure it was Sir Richard Douglas you found?"
"Um– all right."
But she knew he was coming.
Which meant the poem had been deliberately written and posted – John hadn't just happened upon it and put it up to annoy the detective.
came to me."
"Hmm," Sherlock said and the sound reverberated in his chest so that John felt it shudder down his spine and settle into his groin. Sherlock's fingertips began to trace back downward, maddeningly slowly. "A not altogether unpleasant prospect. However, since I'm here and you're here, we may well take advantage of the situation. I'm fairly certain these curtains do close."
"Standing at the bottom of the stairs ignoring my calls?" Sherlock replied and there was almost a hint of humour, of 'obvious' in his voice.
“It’s never
"This is Doctor John Watson. He's a–"
"Oh," John said, leaning back slightly in his chair, glancing around the flat. He'd almost hoped that by some miracle it would be clean again. He thought of their bed and the downy pillows and the sheets with that high thread count Sherlock liked so much…
Sherlock's nostrils flared as he drew himself to his full height, and John shifted, making his stance even more military. The moment before his partner took the hint was taut, both of them silently braced for a stand off, but Sherlock relented, relaxing enough for John to ease his guard down.
Sherlock eased himself through the window and changed – he had no time to shower or brush his teeth or even wash his hands, which he did fastidiously despite the gloves, but at least he could remove the smell as much as possible for John's sake.
"Nope?" he asked.
She doubted it was the former.
She was better.
“That doesn’t mean it won’t bother him.”
"Can you find him?" she demanded before Sherlock could even draw a breath. "Mister Holmes, can you find my husband?"
"No, John, it isn't," he said, and there was no banked anger in his voice, no hint of a storm beneath. Just a statement of fact. "And under any other circumstances I'd suggest we step back immediately, but a man's life is at stake and the only people involved for whom this isn't personal is us."
"It's a Beauceron, John."
He wished he'd thought to bring a change of clothes – not to mention soap and deodorant – but he could text Harry the next morning. In the meantime, John stripped down to his t-shirt and boxers, settling onto the cot and listening to Sherlock's steady breathing.
There had been time for idleness, for indulging in the utter contentment that always followed a session. Katherine had been good enough to book a masseuse for each of them, and Irene had even allowed herself a small glass of wine, a very rare treat after Aaron's birth. The satiated haze hadn't been rushed – with Charles and Dominique caring for Aaron, Irene had no reason to hurry, and there was no one in Katherine's home who would interrupt or interfere.
"I was going to take it home," Josephine replied, but then softened at his expression. "But yes. I have others."
He doubted Sherlock would be into anything too serious in that regard – but for a man who wasn't legally allowed to make arrests, he was awfully fond of his set of handcuffs.
John saw the shut down: grey eyes suddenly clouded, expression hardening with only the barest shift of muscle.
"So, what? You're just going to sit back and let him do whatever it is he wants to do to Mycroft?"
"Rather a lot of things," Sherlock replied briskly.
He suddenly wanted to ask if John missed it, the question hovering, unspoken, on his tongue. It had been John's home first, where Sherlock had installed him after hiring him, part of the conditions of John's contract. A real flat to call his own and protection for Mrs. Hudson.
"He's not," Charles said sharply, nodding as best he could at his son, who was propped against his shoulder, fidgeting and fussy.
John wondered suddenly where the case files had all gone. Mycroft, probably. He blinked in shock. If he was right about that, then Sherlock had listened to him about turning the case over to his brother. That meant that Sherlock was admitting defeat for John's sake and breaking his perfect record, and that he was willing to let Mycroft see some form of weakness. John didn't think of it as weakness – it just needed to be done. But Sherlock kept a mental tally sheet of his interactions with Mycroft and would see it as a concession. John hoped that he wouldn't feel resentful about it.
” Gabriel shouted, spinning back, throwing his arms wide, green eyes blazing.
"She's very good with strangers," Georges said cheerfully. Sherlock's grey eyes flickered over the room quickly, as if seeking escape, but pinned by the tiny human clutching him.
"Hardly," Sherlock sniffed. "There's water to our right in the distance, no indication of that to our left. Path of least resistance. Useful when carrying a corpse."
"Do you want me to come with you?" she asked.
"The thing about being tied up is that you don't get to make any of the decisions," John murmured, casually dropping one hand to draw light circles on Sherlock's hip, "but it's still going to be all about you." He smiled, tracing a finger downward, along the outside of his partner's leg. "I know you'll like that last bit."
When she found out Tricia was a doctor, too, Sarah was delighted and their conversation turned to medical topics and the state of the NHS. John found himself enjoying the company immensely and felt a bit bad for forgetting how much he liked actually talking to Sarah. He realized suddenly that he'd have to tell Sherlock he ran into her – two weeks ago, he'd have mentioned it but more in passing and Sherlock probably would have arched an eyebrow in that dry, amused way of his and said nothing and wouldn't have given it further thought. John pushed down on an image of Sherlock from two weeks ago, because it was coloured by the lie. He'd seen precisely what Sherlock had wanted him to see, not knowing there was more there that Sherlock was keeping carefully concealed from him. John refused to get distracted by that awareness and refocused on the conversation, keeping his mood deliberately light.
interference and it was written everywhere on all of Sherlock’s surfaces and in the air and the light and the temperature and there was no getting away from it and
"I'll make it worth your while. I promise."
"She's brilliant," he said.
"You said she wasn't working for her. I mean Adler. For– Mary."
He thanked Gerald and dismissed him for the night, declining the offer assistance carrying up the new suit Pierre had sent to his office that afternoon. The thought of someone accompanying him any further was more burdensome than the garment bag, and Sherlock rode the lift up alone, grateful that none of his tenants had managed to time a trip with his.
He hummed in reply, too sated to form the words to answer. It wouldn't be the last he heard about it, because Mycroft would be on his case and Irene would undoubtedly have something to say about it, but it was John who really mattered, and John who would let it go, trust his judgment, his ability to make the choices that kept them safe.
," he spat. "That's just fucking brilliant, Sherlock! So she's not just giving you drugs, she's giving you drugs she uses on her dominatrix clients? What's next – have you–"
Sam looked at him blankly for a moment.
If she were lucky.
had to have been concocted to draw Sherlock back in. Anger was carefully smothered, allowed no fuel with which to grow. There was no margin for error, not here. As little – or less – than there had been during the three day trek through the wilderness. One wrong step may not send him down the side of a hill or into a storm, but this ground was no steadier beneath his feet.
"What do you mean?" John asked. "Let's get upstairs."
"Besides, then I wouldn't be the only one in the world."
Given the opportunity, everything struck at once – exhaustion, thirst, hunger, confusion, isolation. He leaned forwards, dropping his head between his knees, inhaling long, slow breaths through his nose until the worst of the dizziness cleared.
John stared at him, brown eyes hard, something nearly hidden underneath, something Sherlock didn't have the chance to tease out before the doctor nodded once, curtly.
“We protect you.”
He needed that spark now. That curiosity.
Sam raised his head quickly, expression suddenly angry.
"That doesn't sound very convincing. You've probably got your laptop waiting, ready to finish your ridiculous paperwork as soon as my back is turned."
“Here we go,” Bill said, plunking a beer down in front of John, the foam threatening to spill over the rim of the glass. “Round five, isn’t it?”
The outward projection of indifference did nothing to lessen the sting of John's implicit rejection.
"I don't think I have one," Doe murmured and John opened his mouth to ask why not before realizing the other man was looking around the room.
Lips and hands drifted over newly exposed skin until their clothing was puddled unceremoniously on the floor next to the bed. John pressed his thigh between Sherlock's, hands sliding against the detective's back to pull him closer. Sherlock whimpered, biting down on the sound as his eyes fluttered closed. John let him thrust once or twice, dragging his teeth across his husband's Adam's apple, then pulled away to reach for the lube.
It was harder to misjudge now.
"No," John said, dropping the word like a stone. Sherlock snapped his eyes open, sucking in a gasp when John pulled away. The doctor sat back, making sure not to break the contact entirely, keeping his hips pressed against Sherlock's. Sherlock nearly closed his eyes again, trying to focus on the pleasure from the sensation, but John shifted, pulling his shirt off in one smooth motion.
Gabriel’s knuckles whitened slightly as he tensed his fingers, before deliberately relaxing them.
, associate that with John.
He always was.
He nodded at Sherlock, who drew a pen knife deftly from a pocket and sliced a neat line through the plastic next to the door frame. Sherlock twitched the now-loose plastic aside with one foot; John positioned himself quickly to fire if needed.
It was simple observation.
"Why did he move?" he asked abruptly.
He took himself into the kitchen, fetching a beer just as Mrs. Hudson appeared with a hot meal that smelled divine. John thanked her with a kiss on the cheek, smiling at her fussing. Alone again, he settled into the sofa with a contented sigh and flicked the television on, thumbing the volume down enough so that it wouldn't wake Sherlock but he could still make sense of the story.
"I didn't mean–" she forced herself to say.
He heard the surprise in the silence now – it certainly hadn't been the name she'd expecting, if she'd expected any name at all. Doubtless Mary knew who was behind Wales but she couldn't have known why. If she had, Georges' existence wouldn't have been a mystery to her, and he very likely would have been protected, even without his knowledge.
The same held true for her supposed job. If she knew the company or anyone in it, Irene would have to lower her estimation of Jim somewhat.
The house was silent save for the faint and occasional strains from his violin. The music wasn't much right now, snatches of melodies that were punctuated by silence as Sherlock noted them down, tweaking them to bring the half-formed tunes in his mind closer to reality. It would be something full and complete in time – he didn't know when, but it scarcely mattered. Once it was pieced together, he could play it for John before moving on, the charm of creating something new outweighing any desires to revisit older material.
really himself again.
"I said it would take time. And it will. We're not going to sort this out tonight, Sherlock. Not all of it."
"No, don't," Sherlock said and they didn't listen,
"No, I work with him," John replied. "Do you mind if I have a look at your chart?"
watching him, Sherlock would ensure that gaze did not track him to Jim Moriarty’s sister.
He had never thought of his father as close to Adele, because he'd never thought of his father as close to anyone.
"How do you feel?" John asked and Sherlock realized that he should have been the one to enquire.
"Thanks," Hassard said, rolling her eyes as Lestrade grinned, bundling his hands into his pockets against the night chill. "All this time on the force, and you know, I never was really sure about that. So good of you to explain. I
John sighed, feeling some of the anger dissipate, some of it shifting into a stab of resentment. Sherlock was right, John
Still, she enquired as to how much was being offered – based on her personal habits, such as nervously straightening the cuffs of her blouse or twisting the rather cheap ring on her middle finger – I deduced this question was not one of shrewdness but of surprise. More surprising was the fact that the buyer – whom the solicitor insisted remain anonymous – was offering a full quarter more than the property is currently worth and was also willing to pay handsomely for the house to come furnished.
Not yet.
"Come sit down," she said and it was more of a command than a suggestion. Sam just nodded, catching Sandra's eye as he pulled away from Veronique. She looked somewhat hesitant. It was an expression he was used to seeing in Veronique's presence; she made everyone uneasy. Almost everyone. He hadn't felt intimidated by her in almost fifteen years.
"The other day, you said that you were not much to look at. You were wrong."
"If I hadn't needed someone to mind Aaron, I'd have brought him along. I think he secretly enjoys watching you charm women and get exactly what you want. You would have made a formidable team, both of you vying for her, except for your rather endearing tendency to become noticeably jealous when he's flirting with someone else."
sense?"
He certainly wasn't going to give his brother the satisfaction.
Bridget met his gaze in the light from their flashlights, the right side of her face turned faintly orange by the distant but approaching fire.
John wanted to ask but swallowed on the question. It wasn't a hypothetical and he knew what it made him – it made him himself. Given the choice, he'd have made the same decision over and over again and had never once lost sleep knowing that.
"Double murder, missing corpses, locked rooms… You
"If by 'fine' you mean a complete and utter twit, yes."
"Sherlock–" John tried again.
"She's brilliant, as always. She keeps asking me when she's allowed to go back to the proper French school. I have her in a summer playgroup that's run partly in French but apparently it doesn't meet her exacting standards of the French government school."
"I mean,
"That's the rub," she sighed. "Why didn't you warn me that being the boss was like this?"
, she had to know, and she had brought them here, dragged them across London to–
"Can it really?" John asked.
. She'd bought a new jazz album that she'd been saving specifically to listen to on a night like tonight, had even dug out the vanilla scented candles her sister had given her last Christmas to make sure the relaxed atmosphere was complete. It was going to be a perfect night in.
Morgan had told him she'd shown their photographs to Riley, who remembered nothing of them. Nor did he admit to remembering anything about Neil Hayes or having any knowledge as to why Hayes' body had turned up in a construction site.
"Um, yeah," John said. "Absolutely."
John eased himself out, slumping enough to press a kiss into Sherlock's curls, fingers playing absently through Sherlock's hair as the doctor's breathing returned to normal. Sherlock settled his hands on John's waist as his partner moved downward, brushing their noses together.
Sherlock donned his new suit the next morning, impressed – as always – by Pierre's work. He examined himself critically in the mirror, preening slightly, pleased with the results and the striking image he'd cultivated his entire adult life.
"Nothing that concerns you."
“What does this mean?”
"What do I know about dresses?" Gabriel snorted. "Anyway, I wasn't allowed to go to the designer's. Bad luck and all."
"All right," he agreed reluctantly.
"I should think that four murders in the space of two weeks scarcely qualifies as a 'maybe'," Mycroft replied.
"Well, you two used to play pirates," Gabriel said. "Now you're actual pirates."
he thought.
"I hope this helps," she said. "Can't see how it would, but I'd hate to find out something happened to him. He seemed nice. Good customer, you know. Knew what he wanted, never complained about the price or if he had to wait, anything like that. Polite. But then, all my regular boys are polite," she added and John thought he could feel the faint smiles around him in response.
"You can't," McKinney groaned. "You can't."
Or maybe he hadn't known then. Maybe this had just come up, or been clear enough for him to make sense of it.
"Sherlock–"
Sherlock sent Gerald home and walked – a habit he'd developed after his meetings with Jim, but one he made sure to vary occasionally. It never paid to assume no one was observing even the most innocuous of activities.
Doe looked startled and John held up a hand but the other man spoke before he could.
"Why aren't you tired?" he asked.
." The same finger against John's forehead, a tiny, warm point of contact. "Why are
possible. But it didn't feel right.
The early September air was warm enough to be pleasant, even clad only in boxer shorts and a dressing gown. John usually made some kind of fond comment about what Sherlock chose to wear on their rather private balcony; the fact that he hadn't this morning annoyed Sherlock, and he lingered over his coffee, smoking three cigarettes instead of his usual one, waiting for John to come to him. It felt almost like defiance – he certainly wasn't going to be allowed to smoke in the flat again anytime soon, and he rarely indulged in this many at once anymore.
John told the duty nurse they were going for a short walk and led Sherlock away, letting the detective hold his arm when there was no one else to see. Molly was waiting for them in the morgue, looking nervous, and as displeased as John felt.
John frowned, putting the lid aside slowly, his brown eyes intent on the contents of the box. It made no sense. There was a dark green jumper, carefully folded, with an envelope resting on top of it, unmarked, and a pair of cufflinks.
"We can't just cut it out," he pointed out. "You'll have two gaping holes."
He looked at Riley, who was fast asleep, worn and slightly pale beneath his bandages. It was hard to imagine him setting a bomb and taking a life – several lives. Had he ever looked at himself in a mirror and asked himself what he was doing? Had the doubts been there before his son had died? If that hadn't happened, would he still have come to the same conclusion, made the same choice to turn away from his beliefs?
"Morning," John said, knowing full well he was capitulating to Sherlock, who would refuse to speak first, but he didn't want to play that stupid game.
For a moment, he couldn't move – not just euphoric shock, but a now-familiar surprise. Surprise that he enjoyed this, that John did, that something he'd never really wanted before made sense with John's body. With John.
She'd lived in London all her life – she'd been born and raised in Wandsworth, had studied nursing at Bart's and she had a good job at St. Mary's working on one of the short-term care wards. She wanted a flat near the city centre, not so close that it was too expensive, but close enough that it was a short tube ride away. She wanted to be able to go out any given evening and do something – go to the theatre, the cinema, a new restaurant, a new pub.
, John, in a low dose and taken infrequently! You know that – you knew that as soon as Irene told you what they are! She wouldn't have given me anything that wasn't! She has no more interest in seeing me dead than you!"
Never mind that John had pointed out that London drivers were hardly polite or patient, and that, as a surgeon, driving had not actually been one of his routine duties in the army.
"Just stay," he said.
"No," Sherlock said coldly. "They do not. So sorry to have bothered you Mister – Alexandre, it certainly was not our intention to impose."
"We're taking a holiday in France, John," he said, trying to keep his tone from becoming too abrupt.
Sherlock gave a sharp nod, impatient, annoyed when Lassalle shook her head.
. He'd built on strange relationships."
Sherlock stared at Mycroft then raised his gaze to John, who was meeting his eyes with a stunned expression.
She flashed another smile, this one far more calculating.
"I know," she said, rubbing her hands together slowly. "And we're spoilt for choice, which leaves us nowhere."
"Not that either," John replied with a grin, catching Sherlock's chin between his thumb and forefinger, pulling his partner into a slow kiss. He pulled away when Sherlock tensed, moving back just far enough to see the reluctance in the detective's eyes.
Sam looked at him in surprise, then nodded.
"Perhaps you were in the wrong army?" he asked, his voice thoughtful, as if he was really considering this. John rolled his eyes with a smile.
"No you don't," John contradicted softly. He heard Sherlock shift, then quiet inhalation that came before speaking, but he cut his husband off. "You don't, not really. You expect it – but with you, when it happens, it's because someone is playing a game with you.
"What? Mycroft, are you absolutely sure?"
"Yes I have. I did it last week."
"Well, he's my dad," John replied. "And that's my mum."
"You want to talk to her," John said flatly. "
"Something more dramatic!" Sam snapped. "Something that couldn't just happen like that! I'm an Interpol agent, Sherlock. I need to be able to go to the Yard and
It wasn't John, but it would have to do.
"No, no, no.
"Gabriel Samuel Mitchell," Sam corrected flatly.
it, John. I
Mycroft wasn't surprised to find the door unlocked. He stepped inside and glanced around, but the living room was empty, unoccupied, weak sunlight streaming through the windows, across untouched surfaces, the empty couch, the empty chairs, the silent television.
It landed heavily in John's palm, the white powder inside the bag shifting slightly.
she thought, sucking in a deep breath and forcing herself to hold it.
If he even wanted that.
, Sam!" Sherlock shot back. "Enough!" He stood still, waiting for more protests. Sam shook his head, unable to manage any words. Sherlock stayed focussed on him, trying to level his own breathing, to keep his heartbeat steady. He put his violin away quickly, shutting the locks with a definitive snap.
“But your lips,” Sherlock continued, and John watched the stamp enthusiast deflate a bit as he was pre-emptively silenced. “Dry, cracked, used to being licked. You’re a
"Yes," Sherlock sighed. He wasn't as annoyed as he ought to be. John knew him well – far too well, sometimes – but he
"And if I'd stayed, we would have spent the whole time hurting each other more, Sherlock. Sometimes we need space. I did, anyway."
"How do you know it wasn't him?" John asked.
She stifled the irritation, refocusing on the file. Ten years ago, Sherlock Holmes was, for all intents and purposes, a healthy young man without any medical issues.
"Where is 'e right now?" Veronique asked, making sure to keep her voice level and fairly neutral – not pleasant, but light enough so as not to sound accusatory or demanding.
"Obviously," Sherlock drawled as John opened his mouth to retort. The doctor snapped his mouth shut, shooting the detective a dark glare.
"What?" Gabriel demanded.
It was a long moment before he could fumble with the belt around Sherlock's wrists to free them, and hook clumsy toes around the scarves, giving Sherlock enough space to pull trembling legs from their restraints. John tried to move away, drawing deep groans from both of them when he collapsed again. Cajoling aching limbs, he managed to pull out and grasp a nearby towel, cleaning them awkwardly, hampered by weakened hands and by Sherlock pressing against him, warm mouth finding John's in an inelegant kiss.
"Do you think they–"
"I'm going to decorate the tree. I need your help."
What had the detective said to him all those years ago?
been in Pakistan. It might have been unconnected; there were certainly reasons for Sherlock to do business in Pakistan, both legitimate and illegal.
Finally Mycroft let them leave, sending them home in one of his cars. John settled in the back, grateful that the driver was removed from them by a pane of darkened glass. He sank into the leather seat and leaned his head against the headrest.
Sam gave him a slight nod and saw it acknowledged in Sherlock's eyes. It wouldn't be the last time they spoke of it, he knew, but he didn't think it would be as bad ever again. He felt like something had been laid to rest between them and that sensation alone was enough of a relief to leaving him feeling light. He hadn't realized how much had been there, unspoken, unacknowledged, but not unknown.
The sound of his phone beeping in unison with Sherlock's startled him slightly, and John felt a pang of regret when the detective pulled away to answer it. John fumbled for his own mobile, looking at Sherlock for an explanation of the link, followed by the abrupt instruction:
"Sherlock William Scott Holmes."
Or put up with it again.
"We both are. To Ireland, this weekend."
"Proper grammar can be learned at a very early age and doing so establishes appropriate habits in speech patterns," Sherlock insisted. "And no, Jo, it is not that long, not when you consider the time span for which you yourself have been alive. John is right: you are four years old. That is significantly longer than five days."
"Of course she knows who Alexandre George is," Sherlock sighed, silencing John's attempted protest with an abrupt gesture. "
There was
“You were an army doctor – you must have some.”
case I've yet to solve?" Sherlock snapped.
"What?" John demanded. "Why?"
He ignored it, sitting on his heels, palms resting on his thighs.
“We’re better,” he replied with a shrug. They paused again as the food arrived, and Mary nodded when they were once again left alone.
Sherlock waited an appropriate amount of time – just over two hours – before clearing a small space in his schedule without alerting anyone to the change. It was the work of a few minutes to ensure that his mobile line and the one he was dialling were secure – that knowledge and technology hadn't come cheap, but had been sufficiently modified that if the seller had been interested in hacking in, he would have found himself sorely disappointed (and the subject of intense police scrutiny in very short order).
Sherlock closed his eyes, fighting against shaking his head.
"To what?" Sherlock enquired.
, pieces of which still lay in scattered fragments, refusing his attempts to put them back together. John insisted this was normal, but Sherlock wasn’t
She suspected he'd found Charles Chauvière while looking for a different kind of talent altogether, but Holmes was never one to waste a good opportunity when it presented itself to him.
He wished the recording had been enough. He’d played it for Sherlock, letting the detective listen from the moment it had started, with John calling the police, until they’d managed to haul Sherlock outside and the audio had devolved into a nearly incomprehensible babble of voices and sirens.
"You'll have time to see him later. Right now, you should have time for me."
26 June
Sherlock's fingers found smooth skin, skimming upward, before John's hands closed over his wrists, a warning look in his eyes.
Sherlock gave a shuddering sigh, and threw up on John.
He put these thoughts aside firmly as the lift doors opened. Despite the condition in which he was likely to find Mycroft, his brother would still pick up on any discomfort immediately. He hadn't forgiven Mycroft for his comments about John. About Sherlock, really. He knew where Mycroft was laying the blame.
Sherlock nodded, the fabric of the pillowcase rubbing against his hair and cheek.
"Sherlock–"

Alexandre's impact on her life would have to be controlled. Loose ends were as irritating as they were dangerous.
"You think– you think she did this?"
"Nothing to do with
Doe looked back at him and nodded, but John thought it wasn't really agreement, just something to do. He winced and started coughing again, reaching instinctively for his water. John waited until the fit had passed then refilled the glass. By the time he was done that short task, it was clear his visit was over. Doe was struggling to stay awake so John gave him a smile and shook his head.
"Her name is Gabrielle."
The detective knew that if anyone else was aware that he did this, they'd find it strange and would assume it bored him. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was fascinating to map John's body over and over, to feel it shift and relax under his hands, to note the way the knots resisted and then released when he focused on them. It helped him understand how John was feeling – not just the way he said he felt, but the small things that he was not aware of, too.
"You're the doctor," Doe said.
"These aren't
"Our replacement Sir Richard Douglas needs some attention – and although I suspect Amanda Hassard has seen her fair share of dead bodies, police work is her area of expertise, not post-mortem examination."
“Mm,” his partner sighed, snuggling even closer to him. “There will be others.”
Stay awake! Stay with me."
She rather hoped never to repeat that again.
"Come with me," John said, refilling Sherlock's glass and leading them into the living room. John settled them on the sofa, the champagne bottle within easy reach, and turned on the sound system, selecting some soft piano music that bordered on jazz without being too brash for Sherlock's tastes.
"It could be yours," Donovan agreed. "It's a start. And you remembered the snow and lights. You just need to give it time to come back."
Beneath the duct tape, Sherlock grinned.
John waited a moment then sighed, shifting in his chair, rubbing his left hand over his face, his wedding ring gleaming once as it caught the light when he moved. Sherlock stared at it, wanting to sit down but also not wanting to move.
Mycroft was already there when they arrived, looking unreasonably cool and put together despite the situation.
He moved slowly, aware that it annoyed his partner, taking the precious seconds to try and work out what John wanted. It was moments like this – grating moments – when he couldn't read John nearly as well as he'd like. When his own proclivity for obfuscation was reflected back at him, leaving Sherlock scrambling to understand what was normally so clear.
There was light again. In patches. Jumping.
The next day, after Sherlock had proved to John that their address was programmed into his phone, John took them to the very heart of Central London, with its masses of people who made the narrow web of streets even more labyrinthine and complex.
John thought he detected Mycroft's involvement but he couldn't figure out why his brother-in-law would bother. He asked Sherlock about it one night, late, when they were curled in bed together, Sherlock still mindful of John's healing ribs.
"Get it off," Sherlock muttered, voice slurred, flexing his fingers around John's.
"We need supper," John said with a slight shrug as he draped the jacket carefully over a chair. "And I know you'll eat this. I'm guessing you haven't eaten anything else today. Coffee and tea don't actually count, you know," he added, when Sherlock opened his mouth to protest the nearly inaccurate deduction.
"Her entirely family died when she was barely more than a kid," John pointed out. "Maybe she wanted to get away from that."
"When
"Stop." It was little more than a sigh as Sherlock opened his good eye.
And there was no doubt they were being led. The man behind the killer, this puppeteer, was pulling their strings – but whose? His or Mycroft's? Both?
"Even worse!" Sherlock snapped. "We do
"You bought me Chinese food in the hospital the first night I was on your ward," he said as they sat down at a table outside, wrapped in their jackets against the cool autumn breeze.
"I know." He hesitated, debating with himself for a second but withdrew his notebook from his pocket and passed it to her. "Have a look at that."
Nothing in the file jumped out at him; sometimes a fresh set of eyes made no difference at all. But the news often ran pictures of people who had been missing for too long for the police to hold out much hope – not that they'd ever admit that publicly, or to the families. Lestrade could pull a few strings, get Richard Mitchell's face on there for a week or two, see if it stirred up any new leads, no matter how tenuous.
"No one should be alone on Christmas," Sherlock echoed. John felt a sudden flare of guilt but saw a smile ghosting at the edges of Sherlock's lips – he was coming for John's sake, not his own.
"No," John agreed. "We're not." He turned away from the counter, curling his left hand around the edge, facing his husband. Then he hesitated, uncertain if he should continue. One of Sherlock's eyebrows twitched upward. He leaned forward slightly, eyes intent on John's face.
There was
His words brought John up short.
"Both. Either."
"As are you," Sherlock pointed out.
He gave himself three days, telling John he'd be away, and taking to London's overcrowded streets, its abandoned alleyways, its forgotten arches. Down here, where life was more immediate, lived by the day, or even by the hour, no one knew him. They knew his name, and his disguised face, but the two didn't go together.
And because Sherlock had been steadily ignoring all calls, there were no cases. Lestrade had called him several times and Sam had tried to call him too, probably on the DI's behalf. He didn't care.
The detective kissed him again, lightly, quickly, then sat back. A champagne flute was pressed against John's lips, and he raised his head enough to take a small sip. Sherlock dipped an index finger into the pale liquid and traced it over John's lips. The tender pressure made John part of his lips, tongue darting over the pad before he sucked gently, watching Sherlock's eyes darken in response. Sherlock pulled his hand away, replacing it with his mouth, and John wondered if he was imagining the faint tingling on his lips.
It left Sherlock in his pants and John fully clothed, eyes raking over a thin body, tracing downward from the flush on his cheeks and chest to the faint bulge in the black silk.
"What is this?" Mycroft demanded, subjecting to the book's cover to a piercing glare. The reaction made no sense. Incongruous. It was just a book.
"She's not in London anymore. Thought you might want to know that."
and he was fine, or would be fine, everything would be fine–
"Come on," he said softly.
"None," he said flatly.
, he mused, letting his eyes wander down Sherlock's lean frame as the detective led the way toward the building's main entrance. He should have known the attention wouldn't go unnoticed; Sherlock glanced over a shoulder, arching an eyebrow pointedly.
"Noticed what?" John asked.
"All right, Doctor, thanks," she replied, nodding again. Steeling himself, he turned and left her with the other officers, circling around the car and walking steadily toward the body.
“I will tell him,” Sherlock sighed, fiddling with a pen, annoyed with the direction of the conversation. “It’s not an unusual circumstance, though.”
Still, John told himself, Sherlock was stronger with each passing day – strong enough to have made it down to the morgue by himself once already.
He didn't want to relive it anyway. He knew why he'd dreamt it. He'd been alone before, hospitalized, removed from his life, isolated. But not like the John Doe at St. Thomas'. Nothing near that bad. Because at least he'd always had himself.
"If they knew each other," Morgan echoed, gaze sliding away momentarily. The edges of her lips curled upward but the light in her dark eyes was sharp, humourless. "Oh, they knew each other, Doctor. Neil Hayes is just one more body linked to John Riley."
"It's a towel," Sherlock said with a hint of impatience. John opened his eyes as it was pulled away, then suffered his husband checking the stitching on his skull, patting it dry. This probably counted as medical care from Sherlock. John smiled slightly. He'd take what he could get.
, and he'd seen it settling in, catching it in the way Sherlock glanced at him sometimes, as if surprised by something, or coming to terms with a new, startling, idea.
The phones paid off the most – it wasn't uncommon for a photograph or a short sound file to trade hands. The people he dealt with knew the value of good information, and how to get it.
"It's written in Hindi. The writing system – which I suspect if what you were asking about – is Devanagari. Used mainly for Hindi and Sanskrit scripts. Among others, of course."
John nodded, feeling stuck on the motion, scrambling to keep up as if he were several sentences behind in the conversation – or missing a key piece, which he thought might be true.
take care of it. It's what he does." He paused, a distant scowl crossing his face. In some ways, Sherlock was an open book – or had become so, to John – and that particular distaste was reserved for Mycroft blindsiding him, rather than going through Gabriel.
John snorted, a smile spreading over his lips.
“Um, nope. Still in London,” John replied, lips quirking into a smile.
making it then," she said.
He smiled into a kiss, feeling the stretch of lips in response before Sherlock opened his mouth, giving up control to John who seized it greedily, taking and taking until the urgency began to wear off, leaving a calmer warmth in its wake. Bodies shifted, easing closer as muscles relaxed, and John slowed their kiss without lightening it.
Sherlock’s breathing was deep and rhythmic, undisturbed by whatever had shaken John from sleep. The doctor listened carefully for a few moments; Sherlock was adept at feigning sleep but rarely used it against John. Especially at this hour. If he weren’t asleep, he’d more likely be up and working than lounging in bed, pretending to sleep for his sleeping partner’s benefit.
"For champagne. On us."
"As a matter of fact, no," Mycroft replied. "Although I suspect I know who took it."
There was a set of footsteps missing – the lack of sound was jarring in the press of noise. Sherlock paused, turning back. John collided with him and cursed, looking up from his phone. Sherlock grabbed him instinctively to keep him standing, but focussed on Sam, who had stopped several paces back. A woman behind him grumbled at the upset and wove around him, shaking her head.
The idea wasn't as unappealing as it once might have been.
"John found it," Sandra replied. "It's a service that provides shelter dogs to injured Met officers. Former Met officers qualify, too, especially if they were injured on duty."
here late?
"It's something she employs in the more… recreational side of her business."
"Could you describe him to a sketch artist?"
gone all weekend."
He realized with a jolt he'd have to call Veronique. She'd find out anyway and if she didn't hear it from him, she'd be upset. The idea didn't seem as tiring, though. He trusted her with his life, more than anyone except Sandra. When he'd been in the hospital, she had been the only person who was safe. The only person he could stand to have touch him at the worst of times, the only person he trusted to tell him the truth. She would want to know and he wanted her to know. He missed her suddenly and wondered what she was doing in Lyon, if she was awake and at work or at home and fast asleep. He'd call her later in the morning – it was too early.
The sound of the buzzer made Sherlock grumble into his pillow. John left him in bed and clattered down the stairs, wondering who it might be. Most of their friends would have called before coming over. He thought it might be for Mrs. Hudson, who almost never heard her doorbell anymore. John was going to have a serious talk with her one of these days. She needed a hearing aid. He was beginning to worry she'd miss something serious, like the smoke detector.
It would be simpler, so much simpler, to tell John everything.
"What–"
"Things are fine, Harry," John replied, surprised at how little it took for him to believe that today. She cast him a quick glance and John sighed, offsetting the expression with a small smile. "Really, they are."
"They had the guard, too," Hassard pointed out. "He'd have been able to let them know when it was safe to work on the other side."
“Talk to me,” John said instead, needing to distract Sherlock as much as he needed to distract himself. “Tell me about the people you can see. Give me their life’s stories.”
"Oh, I see. You want me to let you pursue this now."
"Good," John sighed. "Do you know what happened?"
"I remember it's idiotic," Sherlock snapped. John heaved a sigh, shaking his head.
"What the
"Where he was pushed!" Sherlock snapped. "What's there? Any indications of the precise location?"
"No?" John asked, arching an eyebrow, brown eyes glinting with laughter. Sherlock huffed, wrapping a hand around the back of John's neck to pull him down again, feeling the doctor's smile against his own lips.
"That's not going to happen."
But she needed to know the smells in her immediate area, and if Sherlock came here with her again, John wanted them both to feel comfortable.
It had come from somewhere above him, and in the direction Sherlock had gone.
"Are you hungry?" he asked when he'd finished cooking and was dishing himself up a heaping plate of pasta.
He paused and Sherlock tried to will him not to say anything more.
He could see the driver veering toward the ramp; once on the wider road, he'd have even more of an advantage. Not just speed and space – navigating the city from behind a steering wheel was his livelihood. John risked a glance at the officer who'd been volunteered as his driver; lines of tense concentration drew down the younger man's face and across the back of his hands, but a sharp smile crossed his lips when he glanced at the rear-view mirror.
, Mister Holmes. But then, nothing about this does, not really. I was hoping you would see that. I'd hate it to spoil anything between us."
"In which direction?" Sherlock demanded.
Sam shook his head, eyes closed.
John looked away for a quick assessment of the scene – there was a body of a man lying at the foot of the stairs and he had either been pushed down the stairs or the impact of the bullet to his head that had clearly killed him had unbalanced him and he'd fallen. In a small flat, the stairs down which he'd fallen would have been a spiral staircase but space was not an issue here, so the stairs curved gracefully up to the second floor, not quite winding back on themselves.
Reaching for the lube in the nightstand drawer made them both moan as John's erection brushed against Sherlock's back, and the doctor nearly lost his grip on the small tube when Sherlock wiggled his hips. A couple deep, harsh breaths got him under control, and John sat back on his heels, aching cock twitching at the sound of the cap snapping open.
the point? The question chased itself around in Sherlock's mind – there was no obvious solution but there
Mary paused a moment, staring, and John wished he could retract his words – he knew he'd have to put up with a barrage of questions that he didn't really have the energy for.
Sherlock asked himself, tugging his lower lip between thumb and forefinger, only vaguely aware of the faint bite of his thumbnail.
Sherlock stopped abruptly when he heard a harsh sob escape Sam's lips.
John elbowed Sherlock lightly in the ribs.
"Everything okay?" John asked, voice still laced with sleep.
"It was fake!" he shouted back, leaving John to give Mycroft a somewhat apologetic shrug in lieu of explanation, clattering down the stairs so close behind Sherlock he had to take care not to trip his partner.
"Brilliant," John replied.
"We believe so."
know something about the Woman! We need to know what that is, John! We need to know what connects them!"
"Really? All right, let's have it, what happened?"
told John about this, haven’t you?”
"If you don't want to do it, we'll ask Jen and her husband," Tricia said.
Things had been so much simpler before John, but Sherlock found even the idea of going back made it difficult to breathe.
"Yes, but they also use SIG 226s. Had he arranged for us to have that type of handgun, it wouldn't point us in the right direction. It's a hint, a signal. Oh, brilliant, absolutely brilliant! This whole time, he's been telling us where he's from."
"No. No. I want to go home."
"Family is important, John. You've said so yourself on occasion."
His lungs tightened in a vice– air, he needed air
Sherlock valued his privacy, but John had no inclinations to give him that privacy right now.
"Because you picked it," Sherlock said. "You picked
"Yes, he was there. That day, that time? I doubt it. He probably knows, but he's never said anything. He was interviewed about it when he became an informant but nothing in the interview suggested he had any idea."
"Hmm," the woman murmured, eyes growing distant for a moment, then she gave a quick nod. "From the right. So that's south."
, he added silently. He sighed to himself; after last night, it was probably an excuse to check up on him, too. Something like this wouldn't escape Mycroft's notice.
The minor surgery to remove a precancerous mole and a follow up cosmetic surgery sat as mute, accusatory reminders that
When Sandra was twenty-four, she almost did marry Nicholas Chilcott. Well, she almost got engaged to Nicholas Chilcott. They'd been dating for two years and she loved him madly and she knew he loved her just as much. They'd talked about moving in together, getting a nice flat.
He thought he could hear sirens in the distance, but even waiting for back-up would take too long.
"You've remembered some things," John said. "I think that's a good sign."
"I need to see it," John said, pushing himself to his feet.
"No," Sherlock managed. "Stop. She'll have him killed."
"What does she know?" Gabriel asked. "About Pakistan."
5 July
The trick now, he supposed, would be avoiding presenting that threat.
John held himself still, breathing slowly and deliberately, eyes flickering over the maps. He pushed the city map away, keeping the others were they where.
John sighed again, dropping his head into his hands for a long moment before looking back up.
"You could take him," Charles suggested, rolling his eyes but not really annoyed when Dominique shook his head with a cheeky grin.
25 June

But this was his
Gabriel Mitchell was unquestionably one of those.
Sam shot him a look.
Sherlock locked down the impulse to respond, feeling the anger pouring off John like a physical sensation. He had, twice, and she knew that full well.
Until a nurse had been kind enough to loan him her phone for a few hours and John had read and read and read.
"I heard Veronique came to see you."
The doctor stirred slightly, a soft sigh escaping his lips, but didn't awaken. Sherlock hesitated, then reached out with his right hand, resting it on John's chest above his heart, feeling the slow and steady pulse against his skin. He stared at his hand for a moment, then shook his head, refocusing.
“Christ,” John sighed, sitting back in his chair. “Bill, I know nothing.”
Harry nodded, eyes downcast.
"Good morning," Sherlock replied, masking his own discomfort with practiced ease, accepting a kiss from his niece, who was warned off hugging him by John, because of her messy hands.
"You didn't know who Healy was," Morgan pointed out.
"It's a bed, John, not a battlefield."
"Hmm," Sherlock replied, curling onto his left side and withdrawing his hand to tuck it under his pillow. John smiled slightly and padded out of the bedroom, leaving the door ajar behind him. He went into the living room, took the afghan from the couch and settled it around his shoulders before curling into his chair. Faint street light from outside was just enough to see by. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back, listening to the silence.
John stared at him for a long moment, then heaved a sigh, some of the tension seeping out of his muscles. He reached behind him, extending a small white box to Sherlock, who took it reflexively. He must have had it in the waistband of his jeans, Sherlock realized, or it would have been crushed when he'd sat down.
If he knew it, then Sherlock knew it.
"He had his gun on him, but it hadn't been fired. We're testing the clothes he came here in for residue, but no, the Met
John's absence he could not.
"There's a programme here run by Sergeant Richards to provide service dogs for Met officers suffering from PTSD. It's based off of similar programmes in Birmingham and in the States for army veterans. I contacted him to see if former Met officers qualified and he told me they did."
"You don't know she didn't," Sherlock replied coolly.
"Here we go," John said, coming to the top of another set of stairs. Some hint of intuition told him it was the last one – he hoped like hell that wasn't a dark premonition. The heat from the fire was making him sweat, which made it harder to keep hold of Sherlock, and he could hear the flames all too clearly, cracking and engulfing the wooden structures behind him.
"I've seen a lot of victims in my time, John. Something like that – yeah, you're right, could have just been a vicious mugging, could have been just a random attack. But it could be someone thinks he deserves it."
to be upset or dwell on my mother's death. I don't want you to have to be careful, to have to take care of me. I want things to be– normal."
"It's mine," he said and Sherlock blinked in surprise, then felt a flash of apprehension and resignation. "Can I come in?"
"Oh." He tilted his head back slightly, looking resigned. "What am I doing in London?" Donovan didn't answer; the question had not been for her. She heard the undercurrent of frustration slip into his voice, saw it touch the edges of his features.
"It's just– She's right you know. Hassard. I can't climb that ladder one-armed. I'm not much use here."
"Air traffic," Sherlock said.
"I'm going to put my arm around your shoulders, under your left arm, okay?" John asked. "I want you to put your left arm around my shoulders, over my arm. Then I'm going to get you up. Is that all right?"
"You weren't," Sherlock confirmed.
"I can't tell you."
He narrowed his eyes, gaze skimming over the memory of a sweeping landscape of hills and rolling meadows, rocky outcrops against a pristine sky.
The post itself was unusual enough to raise eyebrows, and Mary read the introduction with sharp scepticism, surprised by the contents. She frowned, pensively, reading the poem a second time and then a third, eyes tracing meanings that might have been imagined but probably weren't.
"That's going to prove difficult," Mycroft said, the edge in his voice cold, cautionary. "He's missing."
That was something at least.
John crouched down again.
do when you are not here or at work may help shed some light on his activities and frame of mind."
"It is when it interferes with
"No, no, no," John said. "Stay awake!
John stirred slightly, aware that a momentary cold spot on the other side of the bed was being replaced by a warm body as Sherlock slipped back between the sheets.
He shuffled from under the duvet and into some clothing, foregoing the sling for now. He knew he shouldn't, but the freedom was a relief, and if he was careful he'd be all right for a bit.
He stared at her then looked away abruptly, closing his hands into fists when he felt them start to shake. Sam shook his head, setting his jaw. He refused to meet her eyes, staring instead at the pattern on the blanket covering his legs.
He might have known Mary would pick her time well.
"No, John, don't," Sherlock said, finding his voice in a rush. "Don't–"
"Imagine, John, just imagine! Over a decade and the first lead they have is a victim who remembers nothing. A man who does not know himself but who knows me." He gave John a bright grin. "This is going to be
He didn't have to open his eyes or extricate himself from the pillows to know his muffled (and annoyingly, somewhat slurred) words were being directed at his brother. Vaguely, Sherlock wondered if there was some means of harnessing the patronizing, put-upon concern his brother exuded – it could probably power a large swath of London.
John paused, peering over Sherlock's shoulder at the tiny phone screen displaying his latest blog post.
"I used to have a friend – we served together in Afghanistan – who was a mechanic. His hands were pretty rough, too. He complained about it sometimes, especially when the weather was cold."
"I will," Sherlock promised. He rung off and stood behind his desk, gazing absently over the sprawling city for a moment before setting his mobile and the conversation aside to return to work.
Ignoring the irritation at having to make this call –
Like the sound of sirens, rapidly approaching.
He pressed her when she said she couldn't remember anymore, letting up only when it was apparent that it was really true.
He pulled the hanger from the bar and shuffled through the rest of the clothes until he found the red jumper that Sherlock loved that went with the kilt. John changed and found his kilt hose – it was too chilly even in the heated flat to go without socks. He glanced around the room again but saw no more notes.
"I look forward to seeing you try," Sherlock replied, putting a bright smile on his face as the guard rung off, gesturing them toward the lifts. John swallowed a curse, striding after his partner, who breezed into the glass and chrome elevator with a smug, triumphant smirk.
, he thought.
“I’m sure you must,” Dominique replied, but John gave his head a sharp shake.
"What's the occasion?" he asked, following the motion as John lifted his own glass to his lips.
"Should I open the curtain?" he asked. "We could watch the sun come up."
"I'll stop in again soon," Mycroft said pleasantly, making his way to the door, apparently utterly unconcerned by the death wish Sherlock was clearly aiming his way.
"Rather a lot of pillows, actually."
"I'll be back soon," she promised and he raised one of her hands to his lips, kissing it lightly. "Please don't wear him out too much. He needs to rest."
But there had to be times, didn't there? There had to be moments when Sam's past was taken into consideration. And then there had to be moments when people made mistakes.
"You're not going to tell me you have a system for when you want to be found murdered, are you?" John sighed.
“What’s the case?” he asked.
I know someone who knows silk has a very high tensile strength and happens to like the way it feels." He watched Sherlock's Adam's apple bob and felt his own body respond, keeping up the slight scratch of his nails on Sherlock's head, tracing absent patterns.
But this wasn't Georges' home and there was no reason to assume he'd been brought here.
The imbalance faded slowly, his brain freeing him from that captive place between sleep and consciousness. His eyes flickered across the room – he was alone. Irene wasn't there (
, before he lost his grip on the last of his control and made a very public scene.
He wasn't especially angry with Sherlock and that annoyed him. He wanted to be – he felt like he could have been justified in it, but part of him recognized that as untrue. It irritated him that he was being so ridiculous, like a little child who hadn't got his way.
Sherlock thought, biting his lower lip. He wouldn't have. Not if it would have identified him as being a foreigner because that was more likely to be remembered.
touching any case files."
Their bed would still be there when they got home. He could wait.
, he supposed – Sherlock was not what anyone would call tolerant of other people's skills and workspace, and since John wasn't there, he'd likely taken to talking to thin air.
“See that you aren’t,” Sherlock warned. John grinned again and padded away, somewhat unsteadily, Sherlock enjoying the view until his partner vanished down the corridor.
Shifting fabric, heat, pressure spreading down his right arm to his hand. Across his shoulder. Merging, merging with the pain. Down his neck, down his spine. Inhale. Exhale. Remember those things. One at a time.
Sherlock moved like lightning, putting himself between them, a hand resting lightly on John's chest to keep the doctor from moving.
John refocused on the present when Tricia led him into a café. The place was air conditioned far too much for his liking but there were several vacant tables outside and he left Tricia with his order while he claimed their seats. A few minutes later, Tricia joined him with tea and scones for both of them and John grinned.
Sandra, Veronique, Sherlock, John, Marian, Lestrade – they were real. They were here, each demanding his attention, each offering their unique friendship in return. Sam had often wondered what his life would be like if all of the events on that day had not happened.
Another brief smile, a quiet, derisive snort asking if he really did, then the expression vanished, replaced by stony seriousness in Sherlock's eyes and the angles of his face. John kept his own expression open, letting Sherlock search it until something shifted behind pale eyes, finding the truth in the statement.
He was faintly amazed that this was his life, that he lived in this flat with an astonishing woman who had turned it into a proper home. That he felt safe here, that he went through most of his days not really thinking about what had happened to him five years ago, instead considering the work he had to do, the small daily chores that needed to be completed, the shopping that needed to be done. That he even had a life at all.
"Like I said, it makes us who we are."
Gabriel raised an eyebrow pointedly.
Mary raised an eyebrow and John felt himself colour.
When I got upstairs, there was this odd smell. That's not unusual either, but normally Sherlock's there to convince me that everything is completely fine, even if something's visibly on fire.
Even now, he wouldn't have put it past Sherlock – a flat, poorly timed joke or some impromptu experiment just to see how John would react. But there was that look of reluctant firmness that John had seen for years and had only recently recognized for what it was. Sherlock's lips parted slightly, as if he were about to speak, before he silenced himself, eyes flickering over John's face.
, John thought, a fond smile tugging at his lips when the dog padded over to where they were seated on the sofa, Sherlock sprawled all over John, to rest her chin against Sherlock's knee. Almost unconsciously, as if he'd been doing it for ages, Sherlock reached down without looking, scratching her behind the ears.
John expelled a harsh sigh, holding up a hand to stave off another apology from Molly, who didn't owe it to him.
Sherlock knew John wanted to have sex and he himself was not entirely opposed to the idea. But nor was he entirely comfortable with it. John had walked out on him twice. He'd had no idea if or when John was coming home after the second time. It had hurt him to lose his husband like that, even for a short period of time. He had lost his mother permanently a few months ago. Losing John on top of that had been debilitating. He had said as much to John, since John wanted to know these things. It had made the doctor frown and feel guilty and berate himself silently. Sherlock didn't revel in John feeling guilty – he just wanted John never to do that again.
It made Sherlock pause, a flash of anger coursing through him. No one had robbed Mycroft of his self-assurance before. Even when David had been abducted, he'd retained some of that unthinking superiority, that certainty that he was in the right regardless of the circumstances.
enough? It wouldn't be the first time she'd done this kind of thing!"
In their business, appearance was everything.
When they got back to Baker Street, John left Sherlock sitting on the couch, holding the box William had left for him, while he unpacked their bags. It had been the second time in less than a year that they'd packed hurriedly to travel to Sherlock's childhood home. This time, though, there had been no hospital visit. William had died in his sleep and hadn't been discovered until the following morning.
But they did have the vehicle's description, and the man himself.
Especially given his tendency to nearly poison them or to start small fires.
He counted it as a minor miracle that Sherlock didn't interrupt, even if another glance upward showed the detective's eyes narrowed in concentration as John led him through the schematic of the underground maze, drawing the trip Sherlock and Hassard had took, and showing him how the other two exits connected with the ones they'd used.
Mary watched the door close behind Gabriel Mitchell and waited the requisite few minutes until John was ready before sending the next patient in.
"They told me that," he murmured. "I don't remember saying it."
"Not everyone is you," John said. "By which I mean some of us are actually sane. And Harry's last girlfriend was a criminal mastermind, remember. It's not something you just get over."
Eliminating names didn’t take long, because she knew very few people on the list well enough to dismiss any suspicions. A few clients who had earned her trust across the years. She re-wrote the list, making as many notes as she could on each of them as she went. The more notes she was able to record, the more secure she felt about that person. It was those whom she barely knew, who touched her life only in passing, who worried her. Jennifer O’Haughan – Janine Hawkins – was on the list, of course; there was no way she could not be. It was likely Jim’s sister was unaware of the complications she was causing, but there was still a possibility that she wasn’t an ignorant player in all of this.
“John–”
"Sorry?"
"If I feel safe then I know I'm doing something wrong," the detective replied and John felt his lips curl again, the expression vanishing as soon as it had appeared. He sighed and heard the faint clink as Sherlock tucked the dog tags into a pocket. The detective moved away to close the door, then came back and settled in his chair.
Not obvious to him.
Doe studied the display for a moment, then reached up with his good left hand, placed his thumb and forefinger on the screen and brought them together to zoom in on the map. John fumbled, so startled by the action that the phone nearly slipped through his fingers.
John warred with himself for a long moment before relenting, relaxing his grip enough that Sherlock released him, letting him put his phone away.
It was a lot more work than any other relationship she'd been in, but Sandra didn't think that necessarily a bad thing. She'd worked hard to get into Bart's and then graduate from the nursing programme near the top of her class. That had been worth it.
John felt himself colouring and her smile grew and warmed somewhat.
She had her own eyes on Sherlock and John, for her own reasons. Undoubtedly, Mycroft did, too. Brotherly love and all that.
"I don't remember–"
– if – and
"Go," Sherlock whispered from beside him. John tore his gaze from Bridget to meet Sherlock's, shaking his head vehemently.
of us
At this, Sam stiffened, tensing his arms and shoulders. His eyes flickered, as if to glance at his wrists, but he shut down on the movement and kept his gaze up, forcing himself to nod. He was still and silent for a moment, then exhaled a deep, unsteady breath and continued.
, he thought brightly.
"Does she know him?"
It hardly helped his strength now to see John pull on the fresh pair of jeans without bothering with underwear.
"How'd you know?" John managed when the door was shut behind him and he was being lowered onto the couch, trying to ignore the way the flat was spinning gently.
John gave him a dubious look but sighed and nodded.
"You're just jealous," John said, grinning and squeezing his knee.
She had let it go, let it take its own time without ignoring it altogether. Her mind needed to know she was watching, and waiting, not abandoning the issue, but simply giving it the space it needed to grow. For pieces to fall into place, for the picture to become clear.
"Someone needs to be," Mycroft murmured.
"So you've come for yourself? Or should I say, for our mystery man in the hospital? A strange case, isn't it? A man with no memory who has not been reported missing and whose fingerprint may have been present at a murder scene twelve years ago, a crime which has gone unsolved all this time… I would have expected Sherlock to enjoy this case. Still, one can never tell with him."
"Only when you don't eat," Sherlock repeated with a roll of his eyes, standing and catching John's face in one hand, holding just tight enough that the doctor couldn't pull away, grey eyes narrowed and scrutinizing.
"Tell that to half our old unit," John muttered.
He fiddled with the chain around his neck again then growled, reaching up to unhook it. As he did so, he heard the front door open. He was surprised – he hadn't realized how much time had passed since John had left. One hour and forty-three minutes, according to the time on his phone. But he hadn't showered immediately and he was still moving more slowly than normal.
Mycroft was probably already concerned about Sherlock – he wouldn't have failed to notice that his younger brother had lost an alarming amount of weight in a short period of time. And he'd have been able to spot how little Sherlock was sleeping. John really hoped Mycroft kept his mouth shut about that, too. Sherlock wasn't going to listen to pointed comments and so-called advice from Mycroft and John didn't need anyone making it worse at the moment.
"What?" John snapped. "You didn't have to throw it!"
Sherlock popped the button of John's jeans and folded himself easily to his knees. John's whole body twitched in anticipation and Sherlock chuckled low in his chest leaning forward to nuzzle John's erection through his jeans. The doctor moaned softly, then gasped hard when Sherlock caught his zipper between his teeth and tugged it down in a smooth movement. He steadied John's hips when they bucked then drew away to John's corresponding groan of protest.
The train of thought made his eyes flicker down, quickly, to his own phone. He'd left it unlocked, propped up so that the app tracking John's location was easy to see. Sherlock felt a moment's relief and satisfaction when the tiny icon showed his partner at Hyde Park, and he slipped back into himself, finding a deeper relief in the solitude.
John didn't kid himself that the roll of his eyes went unremarked, but Sherlock chose to ignore him this time, honing in instead of the well-dressed man behind the security desk.
The metre reader turned, slipping his phone back into his pocket, making for his van, and John just managed to swallow a gasp.
"Three years?" John demanded, seeing the surprised look relax Sherlock's features. "You bought her three years ago?"
“It’s not about trusting
John noted the lack of hesitancy at the designation again – he'd been trying to remember Sherlock's relationship to John, not stumbling on the less common use of the word.
He lit a cigarette – such an unconscious habit now, he should really pay more attention, he
They raced down the stairs as quickly as they could, flashlights nearly useless now, pressed as they were against Sherlock's body. The smoke obscured what weak light they were giving, but John couldn't spare the time to drop it, focusing on the fire chasing them, on staying conscious long enough to get out.
"Like how you don't guess?"
Then again, neither did she.
"Let me go!"
His records listed the identification of a small, precancerous mole that needed to be removed. There were notes about the biopsy and the surgery – which would have been very minor, had it actually happened – and follow-up notes about the recovery, including some details about plastic surgery to remove the scar.
"Suit yourself."
He supposed they could hire someone to come and clean it out, but it felt disloyal. He wasn't worried about what might be found here – Sherlock had seen to the 'herbal soothers' immediately – he just didn't want a stranger rooting through her belongings, as if they were no more than pointless things taking up space. Everything in here had been
us learn it – when we're small. So you would have been doing it your whole life. But the phone... you're about my age – I'm forty-five – but these kind of phones have been around for– what? Maybe ten years? Fifteen? So it's something you had to learn to do much more recently."
"Jesus, Sam, I don't want you to be sorry," she said quickly, shaking her head. "This isn't your fault. Please tell me you remember that."
Voices drifting, in-out, like the tides, filling, draining. Who needs what, where, how much, when, why. Distant, closer, distant. There was a name for that. What was it?
"It's a lot more confortable than my bed," John snapped. "So if you want to be a giant git about chasing after murderers, you can sleep upstairs."
And Sherlock intended to see that Georges
He chewed on his lower lip. If John were home, he'd be subjecting the detective to a very disapproving glare right now. Sherlock had known this was coming. He just wished he could postpone it indefinitely until it ceased to be important.
Mycroft considered this for a moment, then held out his left hand. Angela rose and he folded his fingers around hers, raising her hand to press it lightly against his lips.
"What would it take to convince you?" Sherlock huffed.
mysteries".
"Or what?" Mycroft asked, voice exasperatingly calm, level.
The moment he needed to compose himself when he got home was stolen by Gabriel and Sandra's dog having heard the door open and launching herself at him in a fit of joyful barking and a wagging tail, running happy circles around his ankles. He might have winced at the dog hair being inescapably attracted to his suit, but the sight of his living room dismantled and reassembled into some sort of structure made of cushions rooted him to the spot.
"Maybe," he agreed. He frowned, then started coughing and John poured him some more water, listening to the congested sound with a sharp ear. The other man managed to get his breathing back under control and sip some water, slumping back into the pillows wearily.
"You were on the phone right before the blast," Sherlock said in a low voice that was almost a murmur.
"Again, not a neurologist, but I'd say it means you're retaining more recent memories, too."
"Take a photo," Sherlock ordered, and John did, caught between confusion and alarm, unresisting when Sherlock plucked his phone away from him and typed a rapid message.
"Uh, a construction firm – that was some of their stuff in storage down there. A law office and an insurance firm, I think."
"Listen, if you think of anything else – or if anyone you works with knows something you might not – give me a call. We could always use the information."
"Yeah," John said, reluctantly letting go to the hopes the detective's admission had sparked. He shouldn't have expected that much, and for Sherlock even to remember the smell of the smoke was remarkable. He should hold onto that, he told himself.
Another brief kiss and John was gone, leaving Sherlock alone in their bedroom, bewildered. He remembered himself in time to follow, but not in time to catch John before the doctor was closing the door to their flat behind him, the sudden silence swallowing everything.
"I'll just find something to put it in, then," John said. "Relax, you look fine."
John! I am not asking you how you
"Modesty is not my concern, John," Sherlock said, putting a light pressure on John's jaw and turning his face. He tilted his own head down, brushing his lips over his husband's. "I'm simply not inclined to share you."
John repressed a sigh and crouched down carefully next to the corpse. Mycroft was standing over him a moment later, extending a pair of gloves that John snapped on easily. It made it simpler to examine the corpse although he wished he had something to cover his mouth and nose – it was cool enough in the flat but the man had been dead the better part of the day. Since nine thirty-seven, if the broken watch on his wrist was any indication.
"No," John agreed. "You're sad. That's worse. Because there's nothing I can say to make it any better."
"This one's on you," John said, chuckling at the glower shot his way.
She just smiled, her blue eyes glinting, and unwound the towel from around his neck before hanging it back up. Sam stole another kiss then ducked out of the kitchen before she could retaliate, heading into the living room of their small flat. A nap might be welcome, actually. He eyed the couch which looked inviting and then glanced toward the bedroom, frowning. If he went to bed, he'd probably fall asleep for the rest of the day and he was trying to avoid that. Not just for the obvious reason, but because he needed to get back into a regular sleeping pattern after the murder of that Welsh MP, Brace, late Wednesday night. Falling asleep fully now would mean being awake in the middle of the night.
"She doesn't know either." Sherlock heard the words before he'd registered the realization behind them, aware that John's expression had shifted to confusion. The doctor shook his head, a short, sharp military movement.
"As far as– as far as you can tell? She bloody faked you out last time– the last two times! You need to do better than 'as far as we can tell'!"
"You do have an office, you know. Inside the Yard. It's nice and warm in there."
lucky. But he suspected Mycroft made his own luck.
"I told you, no one knows but us."
," Sherlock said, voice cool, holding the word at arm's length as though it was distasteful.
Irene admired the detail, aware that this must only be the surface level. Jim wouldn't have just stopped there. It was too easy. Jennifer had the advantage of a mother who didn't travel, but presumably she had old friends from school who did. It was possible she used that flat when they came around, but Irene very strenuously doubted it.
She cursed inwardly to herself, employing every French expletive she could think of and some of the English ones she knew, too. She was vaguely aware of her free hand curling into a fist on her desk, the other one tightening on the phone's receiver.
– a barebones sketch that didn't come close to fleshing out the reality that was Sherlock.
The sensation was nearly suffocating. Years of carefully building his reputation, carving out a career for himself, yet he was constantly walking into these webs, trapped in situations orchestrated by unseen forces, being guided like a marionette on very short strings.
Bridget drew a breath; Sherlock heard it dimly, more aware of John's reaction stopping it, the way the doctor held up a hand, the movement sharp and economical. So very military. John hadn't torn his gaze away and Sherlock felt caught by it, as though the two of them might stay, ensnared, in that moment.
He'd never been very good at following medical advice. Even his own.
Still, it annoyed Sherlock this needed to happen at all. If John had stayed out of his medicine cabinet, this discussion would never have to take place. He'd had no intentions of resorting to the sleep aids Irene had provided – at least not then, and he would have taken them discretely had he needed them, after John had gone to sleep and while in bed, so it would have appeared the next morning that he'd had nothing more unusual than a good night's sleep.
"They were clearly imbeciles," Sherlock replied. "Anyone with a modicum of observational skills should have been able to identify the nature of your relationship."
The bedroom was dark but the curtains that covered the balcony doors were pulled back and one of the doors had been left open. A faint and cool salt-tinged breeze stirred in the room, shivering over John's skin, raising goose bumps. He got up and searched the floor for his discarded pyjamas, managing to find both the t-shirt and the boxers in the moonlight that glanced across the polished hardwood floor.
If Mycroft had even noticed.
He was safe.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. No music or no memories? Likely both. Sam curled up again and leaned his head back, staring at the ceiling. He was silent for several minutes before asking:
John hoped like hell it was a bad one, and that it lasted for an entire week.
"So you always tell me."
Mycroft sighed, shaking his head, dismissing these thoughts. Worrying about his younger brother was a full-time job – two, really – but he had more pressing matters on his mind at the moment. He pulled his mobile from his jacket pocket and turned it back on as he left the conference room. They had all agreed to cut off all communication during the meeting, because this made it more difficult to trace their whereabouts. But he needed to contact Anthea immediately to see if anything had come up during the course of the meeting. Thankfully, none of them had been murdered – that would have been fairly obvious – but there was still a risk to their families.
"Being turned into flats, yes. Not a public space, but not precisely a private space, not yet."
"Good," John said.
John stared at him then forced himself to nod, falling into step behind Sherlock. He was livid and he recognized it was because he was terrified. No one knew who their killer was, even the man who had hired him. He was running circles around them, getting in past security everywhere and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.
"I can't–" Sherlock managed, word half lost to the linens and to his own desperation.
It mattered that John was everything, contained in one compact, perfect package, because
John eventually just dragged him into a bathroom and locked the door. He cleaned Sherlock's face and hands methodically, using the repetitive motion to get the detective to refocus, and made his hair look something approaching normal. When he was done, Sherlock was still standing taut and rigid, eyes flaring, jaw locked, but at least his breathing had slowed somewhat and he looked a bit more human. John cleaned himself off hastily and led them out again, finding a small waiting area that was tucked away, making sure that Sherlock heard him tell the nurses where they were.
"But he was," Hassard said, voice quiet, as if talking to herself. "Who was he sending those emails to?"
Morgan sighed, nodding.
"What would you have preferred?" Sherlock snapped.
More difficult was what to do about it.
"It's not a secret," Sherlock sighed. "And yes, I did. I make it a habit of not hiring stupid people. It was hardly difficult for her to come to the obvious conclusion. She offered them to me – I saw no harm in accepting. It seemed like an agreeable solution."
"Of course we need milk, we always need milk, I'll get milk."
"Seven years ago you asked me to care that people were dying! People are still dying all the time, John! Thirty-one people have died! Would you like me to remain unaffected by that? What is your fascination with being disappointed in me, John? My response isn't good enough if I don't care, nor is it good enough if I do! What do you want?"
John replied.
"John–"
It worried him, too, because it had a sharper edge than usual – Sherlock was never as good with the cases that involved a personal element. He'd seen that for the first time just over seven years ago, when he'd shown up at The Pool at midnight with Semtex strapped to his chest. Seeing that terrified dismay on Sherlock's face had been jarring, nearly stopping his heart without Jim Moriarty's help.
"Bloody amazing for someone who survived a bomb blast," John replied honestly. Mycroft managed to twitch an eyebrow up at that, his grey eyes amused for a moment. Sherlock wondered what painkillers he was being given – his eyes were fairly clear, although they had the same sort of glassiness as McKinney's. No surprise there, given that Mycroft had also suffered a concussion.
"Of course, but–"
The junior agent started to respond to the order with a question but Veronique ignored him and strode away, her heels clicking sharply against the tiling. She took another drag on her cigarette as she hit the lift button on the lobby and felt a flash of irritation that overlaid the anxiety she felt about Sam. She'd have to call François Hebert herself – she couldn't trust that imbecilic junior agent to do anything properly. The quality of people they were hiring these days – it was appalling! She hit the lift button again and glared at the floor indicator, tapping her foot impatiently and puffing vehemently on her cigarette.
"He's doing it because he can, because he knows it's not enough information. Oh, very clever, indeed. The nursery rhyme, John. It's only the slightest variation on the version typically used in Canada – enough of a deviation to be what he thought he was hearing as a child when he learned it. And the guns – SIG 225s, oh yes. Used by the Canadian Military Police. Mycroft, this explains everything – the boot prints on the floor in Kenton's house, the confidence and skill with which he murders his victims, his ability to move undetected – he's ex-Canadian Special Forces."
John felt very extravagant doing all of this. He tried to imagine what he would have thought ten years ago if someone had told him he would eventually be taking holidays at a private villa on the Mediterranean and being served by a household full of staff.
case is all over it!"
Sherlock didn't get much in the way of cases via actual post, but there were a handful of written missives that came each week. John read them over, smoothing each letter open and leaving them beside where Sherlock's laptop was currently residing. If prodded – or bored enough – the detective
The goose bumps that sprang up on his partner’s skin caused the same reaction on his own, and John felt a dull thrum of warmth settle in his stomach, one that had nothing to do with being curled up under a downy duvet with another person next to him. He shut his eyes, trying to breathe the sensation away.
her to know.”
The knock on the door surprised John slightly; he wasn't expecting anymore patients after the last one half an hour ago. He did have walk-ins occasionally, but his patients, all of whom worked for Sherlock, tended to schedule in advance if it wasn't emergency, and it seemed a bit early for a shooting.
be safe, Gabriel. You will ensure that she
"I'll send someone to fetch him, of course."
"It's good to see you looking better," he said. "Mummy and Father will want to come around soon, of course. I'll pass on your best to them."
"What?" Doe asked.
"Of course, there is a sixth possibility that he's nothing more than a man with a physical job who happened to have been shot at some point – wrong place, wrong time – and was recently attacked for reasons unknown. Personal? Random? Hard to say. Perhaps he's just unlucky. And it could be that any of those deductions were wrong because all we had was a beaten man with no memory and calluses on his hands and an old bullet wound to his leg. Hunting accident? Perhaps he does wood working as a hobby?"
"What happened?" he murmured, reaching blindly for John's hand. John took it, squeezing gently.
"John?" Sherlock asked.
"Um, pretty sure that's not going to happen," Sam replied with a hint of a real smile. Marian grinned back at him. "Besides, you don't actually want to strain yourself."
"Hang on!" the constable ordered again, and John braced himself as best he could one-handed, teeth gritted against the impact that didn't come.
, because the sleeves were the right length, and so were the trousers. The jacket fit better at the waist, but the shoulders were too big; what her mind had identified as simply from the body being supine was a fault with the suit itself, not the wearer.
"I rather like you like this," he murmured. "We are going to start coming here more often."
It wasn't much, but it was a start.
It was annoying now to know that wasn't true.
"Ah yes, this 'appens to me also."
"He's that missing man from Paris! It's been all over the news there – I may not live there anymore, Mister Holmes, but I still have family there and I keep up with what happens. And yes, at it happens – ridiculous as it sounds – I
And too often, an agreeable outcome was difficult – if not nearly impossible – to orchestrate. People were irritatingly inconsistent variables, prone to pursing whims or clinging to ignorance or stubborn habit. He knew those vagaries to be true of himself on occasion – he'd
So he explained in a flat, detached tone, keeping his voice level and his words neutral. Sam listened without interruption, his expression still without reverting to that blank look at which he so excelled. When Sherlock finished, Sam stayed silent, his eyes shifting away thoughtfully. Sherlock waited, forcing his hands not to tense on the arms of his chair.
"What do you mean?" Sherlock snapped.
"Why Friday?" she demanded, turning back to John.
"Oh, lord," John said. "Tee, I'm so sorry, I thought you knew."
"Take this off," he said, voice slurred with fatigue.
Sherlock looked startled, grey eyes going wide, and John felt suspended for a moment, caught by the realization he thought he'd buried – that the Woman could so easily pull Sherlock back into her trap and that he would go, almost willingly, for the chance of that dangerous distraction.
But it had been her voice on the recording, and there had been a gunshot. The body on the slab had died of a bullet to the brain.
"I want to help him," John said.
"He's not friends with anyone," Sherlock comment, voice flat, and under other circumstances, John might have smiled.
Sherlock leaned back and let out a mock sigh.
She met his eyes again, startled by the unexpected sincerity, managing a brief nod.
And they were police, when it came down to it. People were always more reluctant to talk to the police than they were just another bloke. He'd learned that in his eight years working with Sherlock – just as he'd learned how to read people well enough to know how to approach the questions. He'd never been Sherlock Holmes but he was getting to be a decent hand at it himself.
think it was him."
the movement behind him almost before he heard it, warning instincts setting off alarm bells in the split second before he felt something connect like a sledgehammer with the back of his head, blinding white light exploding across his vision, dragging searing pain with it that screamed along his nerves, paralyzing everything, seizing control of his body from him.
"I do trust you, of course I trust you."
When they returned to the manor after the reception, Sherlock reflected that he was an orphan. Strange to think that, that this word should be applied to him because it seemed wrong, if only because he was days from his fortieth birthday and it couldn't be considered tragic. Glancing at John, he realized he didn't want to contend with the day that Carol died and John lost his last living family member.
John grinned.
John nodded.
They always did, with John.
He was glad he'd suggested this – a respite from London was just what they needed. He smiled to himself when he remembered a time when the idea of London had been the fantasy, back in the baking summer days and freezing winter nights in Afghanistan. But life was complicated no matter where one was, and London was particularly so right now.
When had John learned to do that? Sherlock had never seen him practice, he was sure. Was it meant to be a surprise?
"No, I'm certain we'll find something," his partner replied quickly. John knew Sherlock's limited patience was reaching its breaking point, and he was starting to feel the itch to go back, too. He'd never lasted long on leave even when he'd been in the army, mind drifting back to the action after a few days, distracting him, turning a supposedly relaxing trip into chafing confinement.
"You don't know that he has a family!"
very good at what she did, and neither John nor Holmes had any reason to think she was anything more than Mary Morstan, a part-time nurse with a mundane personal life that would hold no real interest to two men in a relationship with each other.
because he gave me a really good tip. We'd always chat, but nothing important. The weather, football."
the doctor thought,
"You said you wanted to collect on your debt," Sherlock sniffed.
"Regardless of who he was, it does not make him responsible for Patrick Connolly's murder. Will you judge him guilty of that because you know something you dislike about him? And he is still the victim in a severe assault. Unless I'm very much mistaken, that level of injury would be impossible to inflict on one's self."
"Oh yes?" Sherlock snapped. "And what am I to do in the meantime?"
"Well?" he finally snapped.
Lestrade had played it carefully. His first instinct had been to head straight to Gabriel Mitchell’s flat and knock him off balance with the footage of Richard Mitchell from the café, just to see the look on the younger man’s face when presented with evidence that his missing brother was still alive.
"Go back to sleep," John murmured. "It'll help."
“You think John won’t be suspicious?” Gabriel asked, raising his eyebrows.
He saw his brother start to answer "well, of course" then stop himself before giving a curt, displeased nod.
"We can have a bit of a wander," John said. "You can update your map."
"Sir? Sir, can you hear me?"
26 June
He paid attention and remembered her birthday. He bought her jewellery that she liked – he was the first man she'd dated who had ever done that. She couldn't wear much at work, no rings or bracelets and she didn't much like wearing earrings. The first thing he ever bought her was a simple silver chain and a silver heart-shaped pendant with a small emerald inlaid in it. She could wear it under her scrubs and not have it get in the way when moving equipment or patients.
And his observation skills were alive and well – it was the first real example of that John had seen since Sherlock had woken up. Memories could be relearned, but the core of Sherlock was still there.
"Told us what?" John demanded.
John forewent mentioning that as well; he was taking his free trip to Paris no matter what.
He waited until his partner was almost ready go to, lacing up bespoke Italian leather shoes in the entryway to their flat, before pouncing.
He needed it, and knew full well he couldn't have it, because seeking John out now would only sound alarm bells in his partner's mind – especially after the disastrous dinner last night – and there would be demands for explanations. What he wanted wouldn't be given up until John had wormed enough information out of him.
"Good," Sherlock murmured, and John withheld a sigh, exhaling slowly instead. He let a moment slip past, then another, sipping his tea as if he'd dropped the subject – but he could see by the lines of Sherlock's shoulders that the detective was waiting for more.
There really wasn’t any other – although Irene did understand Sherlock’s reluctance.
26 June
"Mary?"
But his writing was scientific, clear, concise. Mary had never pictured him as the kind of man to take a literary flight of fancy.
Sherlock passed his phone across the desk, subjecting John to another glare. John skimmed the short list of names on the screen: Elizabeth Newman, Mary Morstan, and Nadia Khan – all women, he noted. There had been a few men who had applied, and John couldn't help finding it a bit endearing that Sherlock had eliminated what he'd (of course) see as potential competition.
"Yes, you do," she replied. "And I think you can. I think you're strong enough. Just – give it a day or two. Give John some time to cool down and think about things on his end."
He felt John's fingers curl around his – only lightly, only for a moment – as the lift doors slid open. It was enough to re-centre himself and he gave a curt nod of thanks. They stepped out and made their way down the corridor then Sherlock paused in mid-step. The action made John stop as well, turning back to glance at him curiously, but Sherlock kept his eyes on the young man standing in front of the vending machines.
"She says it was," Mycroft replied and Sherlock's eyes flickered to John, who was examining the victim's head carefully, fingers moving through the greying hair to better see the wounds. "She reset it when she let herself in."
He pulled out some photo albums and small shoeboxes, tossing them on the bed. When he was finished, he stared at the small pile, certain he must have missed something. There were two small boxes and four photo albums. Everything else, save for some of the photo albums he'd given to his mother, had been donated to a local charity. Nothing Harry had owned had meant anything to John, and he hadn't needed anything of hers. He had more than enough rubbish in his flat, most of it courtesy of Sherlock. There were people out there who could – and probably had – made good use of all the things Harry had left behind. It had been a relief to get rid of all of her things, to close out his account at the storage facility, to have done with all of it.
The connection could even be Mycroft himself. As much as including his brother annoyed him, Sherlock was disinclined to rule Mycroft out.
A newer, deeper relief swept through him when the program ran its course and John shut the television off. By the way John stretched when he stood up, it marked the end of a day that Sherlock was happy to see the back of.
26 June
"Inside," he snapped. "Both of you.
Mary put a hand on her husband's face, very lightly, and leaned over to kiss his forehead.
When John didn't say anything, Sherlock let out an abrupt sigh and set down the Petri dish and eyedropper he'd been working with. He didn't look back at John, but the stiffness in his posture indicated that he was waiting for some sort of retort.
Someone had set this up, blindsided them with it
"I know he's got a good support system and that Interpol will give him the time off that he needs. But I found something else that might help."
“He is, but he’s not the only person who could cause us problems, John. This isn’t about mistrusting you. It’s about not trusting anyone else not to see you as a target because of your relationship with me.”
"He could be twins."
"I think there's scones," he said, speaking in English because it was easier. He remembered Sandra baking the day before but he did not remember what she'd been making.
"I would like you not to walk out when you're angry," Sherlock said, his voice taut. "I would also like you not to act as though I cannot take care of myself."
"Yes, I know," John said. "It's– do you need to buy new clothing? You have time before then. I know it won't be up to your usual standard, but if you plan on regaining the weight, then you won't need the new clothes for long."
Mycroft sighed weakly. Doubtless he'd already been through this with the military and civilian police officers – and probably with Angela as well.
"We don't have fish," he said.
"It was only once, Sam."
"Yes, you mean you!" Sherlock snapped, his voice sharp with anger. "You told me to take the case for you and you told me to stop. You've made it quite clear that this is about you, John."
"Mary," John sighed, sitting back in his chair.
fail in that. Now I've got to fix it."
"Can't forget about him twice," he commented. "But yeah, okay. Sorry, none of this rings any bells."
"No," he whispered, then cleared his throat. John, ever cognisant of a patient's needs, circled the bed and helped him with a glass of water. The victim's gaze moved to John curiously. "Who are you?" he asked.
Mary crossed off another erroneous solution, refusing to be annoyed by the apparently random results they generated. Sherlock had chosen his words very carefully; she would be as considered in her examination. Like so many things in life, it would only become problematic if emotions were involved, if it turned into a game.
he told himself with an inward sigh. It didn't look open yet, and there was certainly no indication that someone had died there twelve years ago, but the path the shopkeeper had given him to Green Park station took him past the Gossard Gallery all the same.
John thought, but kept that to himself.
"Sherlock–"
"No, Sam, give me your full name." Sherlock understood the information John was seeking. Sam had changed his middle name upon returning to England permanently, so that he could be called 'Sam' without any confusion. Sherlock had never understood why but had not enquired.
At this, Sherlock tensed slightly as John expected he would. He dropped his eyes and traced an absent pattern on John's chest with his fingertips.
Mycroft had initially thought it wouldn't even last one.
He waited a couple of minutes to see if his partner would pick up on him. When that didn’t happen, John leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees, gaze trained intently on his partner.
John looked away, rubbing his palms together slowly, his expression tense. Unhappy-and-Suspicious John.
John pronounced him probably all right and prescribed preventative measures – heat and more stretches – for the meantime, advising Gabriel to keep track of it and come back if it got worse. Gabriel was happy to avoid physiotherapy for the time being, and hopefully altogether, particularly right now. With work and the wedding, he hardly had time to pile more onto his plate.
"Sometimes," John said, crouching down, resting his hands lightly on Sherlock's thighs, "not everything needs to be overanalyzed. Sometimes you just need to…" John shrugged, hiding a smile when Sherlock's eyes narrowed even more. "Let yourself go."
"Yeah well, you picked a strange person to pin your trust on. I'm a cop, John. I know enough to be realistic."
"Is this her, Mycroft? Is it
He waited; Sherlock's eyes darted away and down, defeat flickering over his features. Reluctantly, he released his grip enough to let John ease the pillow away, and the doctor felt his eyes go wide, muscles slackening with shock.
"Do you think he does?" John asked.
"Sherlock, if we hadn't got that videotape from the club, how long do you think it would have taken you to figure out that she hadn't been abducted?"
He felt Sherlock shift uncomfortably and turned his head enough to meet his husband's eyes.
"Sally, please. And I'm glad you're here – we've been at our wit's end trying to get any information on him."
There was another pause, this one more thoughtful, calculating.
Sherlock's memory couldn't be that badly damaged if he remembered the fire.
Appearances.
"I don't want it," Sherlock repeated.
The weight on top of him eased suddenly and Sherlock gasped again, collapsing back into the cushions, panting and disjointed so that the sounds of John rummaging between the cushions for the lube and shucking his jeans didn't reach Sherlock until John had pushed into him, groaning at the resistance. A flash of pain mixed with pleasure shot through Sherlock and he hung on as best he could as John thrust, hard and fast, coming with a groan buried in Sherlock's neck, the sensation of hot breath on the blossoming bruise making him tremble.
Sherlock wasn't the only one who'd seen Adler naked, and John
It was a relief to see John so light-hearted. Carefree. He had smiled more over the past two days than any other two-day period since Sherlock had returned to London.
"Jesus Christ," his partner murmured, and Sherlock could feel Isabelle Lassalle's confused gaze flickering between them, trying to divine what was wrong, not comprehending. He wanted to crumple the photograph in his fist, hide the reality from John, but that was unproductive and would scarcely have made a difference now; John had seen it and knew. "Sherlock, that isn't– Is that–"
His eyes adjusted enough to make out the faintest gleam from his wedding ring, a simple gold band incised with a Celtic knot pattern. That had been Sandra's idea – she'd said it went well with the Scottish theme in their wedding. He'd agreed happily. He hadn't cared what the rings looked like. He would have worn anything she'd asked. He still would. He'd do anything for her – most days he was still stunned that she was his wife, that she came home to him, that she'd chosen him and not someone else. Sometimes, he was certain he was dreaming the whole thing.
“You’re in early,” he settled for saying, keeping his tone light and matching her smile.
If John had to pick one worst day, this was probably it.
And certainly not in the middle of the night because he'd come damn close to killing his partner.
Any attempts to get up and make even a cursory examination were met with a suggestion that if Sherlock chose to do so, he might consider how long he'd like to be sleeping on his own. Deterred, Sherlock settled, not above glaring reproachfully at his obstinate partner (who, gallingly, was ignoring him without any apparent effort).
He paused and raised his eyes now and Sherlock fought against taking a step back at the hurt in them.
It didn't go unnoticed by the A&E doctor either. She brooked no argument, giving him the choice of staying and using the oxygen mask or being restrained by security and using the oxygen mask.
She was an expert in ensuring that blame fell squarely where it belonged in the rare instances when that kind of intervention was necessary.
Now that really
Father: Patrick Daniel Georges.
"Yeah, well you need to eat, too. I'll just get the usual."
"You cannot be angry at him for being a terrorist and then refuse to acknowledge that his opinions on the matter changed. At great personal risk to himself, I might add. That can't be a decision made lightly."
John stared at him a moment longer, then nodded. He slipped into the cab and put his hand on the door handle but hesitated, looking up at Sherlock as if expecting something. Sherlock looked back down at him and nodded.
"Don't give
"I didn't say anything," John commented, raising an eyebrow.
"I'm a perfectly capable cook," Sherlock protested but, John noted, didn't make any move to get up from his work and stop her. He smiled slightly, suppressing a wince as he shifted on the couch to get more comfortable. Sherlock's sharp gaze shot back to him, fixing on him firmly until John relaxed, giving him a slight nod. There was a reproving look on his husband's features for a brief moment as Mrs. Hudson vanished into their kitchen.
"Why don't we order take away?" he suggested. "You can put off anyone seeing you for at least a day."
Remember my first name and you’ve got a deal.
"Sherlock, it's a fucking disaster! This– this is worse than Moriarty!"
John! You dare bring my personal life into
Jim had always been an unstable element. Containing him had made him more predictable, but not in the ways that would matter here. And madness like his couldn’t ever really be entirely directed.
"No," Sherlock replied, stretching out on his back, adjusting the pillows beneath his head.
"Did it– did it work?"
Sherlock extended Lestrade's phone, which he was still holding, and John took it. He glanced down at the picture and then dropped his head back, closing his eyes. On the pavement above, their killer had drawn two ovals in permanent marker – one complete one, one that was missing the top half, the break delineated by a jagged line. On the complete one, he'd even drawn little stick arms and legs.
With a sigh, John helped his partner to unsteady feet, bundling the duvet in his free arm. Sherlock padded into their bedroom with John right behind him, not quite able to restrain the relieved groan when he settled onto the mattress. John checked his temperature again, satisfied that the fever was on its way down, and covered him carefully with the duvet.
"What shade of brown? Dark? Light?"
“Of course they do,” Sherlock replied, fingers brushing over bare skin now. John released him long enough to get his t-shirt off, letting it join its companion on the floor. “It’s informative.”
"Found anything?"
Irene gave him an expectant look, and Sherlock recounted the conversation – if it could be called that – he'd had with Jim. Her reaction to "the girl" was similar to Gabriel's, but without any potentially connected information from Victor. Sherlock filled her in on that, too, watching closely for any reaction, any realization that tidbits of information gleaned over the years might be linked.
"If you want things to be the way they were, it starts with you.
"You were crawling through tunnels?" she sighed.
The name clicked in milliseconds before the other woman spoke again.
"It can probably wait a bit," John agreed. Sherlock pushed himself to his feet and disappeared into the bedroom, returning with the water and the ibuprofen and a pointed look. John took the pills before finishing his tea and toast. He was grateful Sherlock hadn't mentioned going to a hospital – Mycroft had probably tried to insist upon it, which meant the discussion was off the table unless John brought it up. But nothing was broken, even if he would be moving slowly for the next several days.
"Do you know I saved all the money I could from my job and from babysitting? I hid it in a pillowcase. There was a loose floorboard in my closet. I put it under there. I'd count it every weekend until I was sure I had enough to come here."
Then he would have to visit Mycroft. That would be fraught with all sorts of petty unspoken admonishments. Sherlock wondered if perhaps he could just send Anthea a lengthy text to relay to his brother. After all, Mycroft was hardly in a position to come round to their flat. This cheered Sherlock slightly – his brother couldn't get up the stairs, and it would be some time before he could, which meant that their flat was unlikely to be invaded.
A quick, dextrous movement had Sherlock's trousers puddled around his ankles. John dragged short nails up his husband's bare thighs, the hand in his hair tightening as he nipped lightly at the skin just above the black silk, reaching up to unbutton Sherlock's shirt. He kissed his way up as the fabric fell open; it was awkward but he didn't care. He pulled his husband into a kiss, pushing the shirt from Sherlock's shoulders. It caught on his wrists where the cuffs were still buttoned and John chuckled, pulling away to dispense with them.
Sherlock shrugged lightly.
He made himself a cup of tea and cut up an apple for Josephine, spreading some peanut butter on the slices. John had taken to hiding the peanut butter, or else he'd often find the jar half empty or completely empty, despite Sherlock's assertions that it was foul and no one in their right mind would eat anything like that. He'd never actually caught Sherlock eating it, and had begun to wonder if his husband was a closet peanut butter addict, a thought that made him snicker. John now kept one jar tucked away and one in a more common place – although Sherlock wasn't above finding the hidden jar when it suited him.
“Amanda.” The word stopped both Hassard and the constable, and Sherlock tilted his head back, beam from the headlamp illuminating the ladder that led up past an open hatch. Without awaiting her permission, he pulled himself up, ignoring the sound of his name being called in warning, and clambered up the ladder easily, slowing as he reached the opening.
"He's in the hospital alone and he has no memory. If it were me, I'd be terrified. I just thought he might like a bit of company. It's almost the holidays. Can you imagine spending Christmas without your family?"
“No one wants to read about identifying ash or perfume,” he murmured, finding Sherlock’s lips in another slow kiss. “Or fabric strengths.”
She'd told Joanna that no one was. She knew she wasn't. She knew there was no perfect, not really.
been there – pain or no pain, Sherlock knew that. A mind trained over a lifetime to observe and catalogue didn't stop in the face of distractions (
"I will," Gabriel promised. "But when it comes to John, you're on your own."
Because he wouldn't say – he didn't want to, lips pressed tight, but the words were there, hovering; he swallowed against them but they were too light, like air, lighter than air, and Sherlock wanted them, but he'd tell,
He crawled onto the bed, trying to ignore the subtle way Sherlock shifted his hips, and grabbed the detective's belt, winding it around his wrists. Sherlock raised his head in surprise that shifted almost immediately to a smirk.
"You're looking too loudly," Sherlock murmured and his eyes fluttered open. He met John's gaze and the doctor was glad to see that his eyes were clearer and his gaze sharper. There was less fatigue in his expression as well and the faintest of quirk at the edges of his lips that was reminiscent of the Sherlock John knew and loved. He put the back of his hand against Sherlock's forehead and was pleased to feel that it was significantly cooler than it had been that morning.
The dark brown suited her too, and she considered making the switch permanent, although it would have to wait. Too soon after this and she ran the risk of being noticed.
It probably wouldn't matter much, but Sherlock wanted to absolve John of as much responsibility in this as he could.
"Why Adler?" Mary asked when he finished, and Sherlock studiously avoided John's gaze now – this had nothing to do with him but he felt the weight of it anyway; if he hadn't been so easily captivated, so taken by the buzz of an intellectual equal, the thrill of a challenge, if he'd just kept all his wits about him… It might have been easier to step away from all of this and see if from the cool vantage point of objectivity.
"As long as you promise to behave," John murmured.
