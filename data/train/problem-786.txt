Sherlock purses his lips and furrows his brow, but obeys. His cool, grey eyes focus in on each of the policemen in turn, cataloging every detail as they climb onto the boat. A soft touch on his knee draws his attention away and back to John. He meets those dark blue eyes, swimming with emotion, his lips in a crooked smile.
“There was a man. When I stepped out of the elevator before dinner. He was watching me. I’m sure of it, and he was gone when I looked back.”
“You’re too damn smart not to have it all worked out,” John pulls back to look at him, a grateful and utterly besotted expression on his face. “You saved me.”
You know, the first time I did this in my first story I never intended it to become a thing. Seems a little silly to have teasers at the end of every chapter and I'm sure some people find it annoying. Of course, when I think about that my Deadpool side comes out and I just think "Don't care. You don't like it, don't read it. We all do what we like and go about our business." But I digress. I have to say that my little question and answer section has become a great source of amusement. Yes, indeed. Anyway,
* Will John find any apples in Cornwall?
John smiles almost shyly and lets out a little laugh. He reaches up and encircles Sherlock’s neck.
While we're on that subject though, I was planning to get chapters out faster than I have been. Things haven't been working out and when I do edit, I've found that the chapters are so long that it takes quite a while. In addition, I want to apologize for any spelling errors or other issues in this chapter. My little nose-miners kept chatting with me and otherwise demanding my attention while I was editing. I am definitely still working on releasing chapters more frequently, so hang in there with me.
“Uh...well, I’m not exactly sure,” he cringes, lifting a hand and cupping the back of his neck. “You see, I’m the new doctor for the Detroit Rock City Rollers.”
“What?” he had seen her knowing expression as soon as he looked her way, even though she quickly shifted her eyes away and into her ice cream pint. “Molly, no. It’s not like that.”
Without further ado..
“No, it’s…” he looks back at Sherlock with honest embarrassment.  He bites his lip and it is absolutely adorable. Sherlock almost flinches when his stomach flips this time. “Actually, yeah. I’d feel better about it.”
He is so fucked.
Sherlock rushes to the side of his boat with the intention of diving into the water to find John, but Moriarty hampers his plan. As The Crown pulls away, the man scrambles onto the built-in seats across the back of the deck and jumps into Sherlock’s boat with a loud scream. Sherlock sees him coming a fraction too late and has no time to react before their bodies collide. They fall to the floor together, Sherlock on his back and the smaller man on top of his lithe body. The back of his head hits the wood with a crack and his vision blacks out for what feels like a few seconds. When he opens his eyes, Moriarty’s hands are around his throat and precious little air moves through his windpipe. Sherlock grabs Moriarty’s wrists and pulls at them as hard as he can to no avail. The terrifying little man is possessed with fury and strength greater than his stature should allow. Sherlock tries to change his grip, but the angle of their bodies works against him and he cannot seem to free himself from Moriarty’s grasp no matter how hard he tries.
“Tell me about it. I saw the schedule for the first time this morning,” John furrows his brow. Attacks on the team with no discernable rhyme or reason leave little room to find the answer to the mystery. How could John find clues where there aren’t any and without Velma Dinkley declaring ‘jinkies’ when one does present itself?
“The pain, the torture I endured in those two years, physically and psychologically, was nothing  compared to what I felt being away from you. Mycroft watched you, gave me updates, so it would be more bearable. He didn’t mention Mary. I only found out about her when I came back. I watched you marry her and never said a word because I wanted you to be happy. I would do anything for you, John. It has always been you. You have my heart.”
Sherlock shifts on the bed to sit on his knees and extends a hand to John. He takes it hesitantly and climbs onto the bed. The two men face each other on their knees.
And, if you don't remember that particular phrase, you are dead to me. :D
John rounds the doorway and steps inside the room to see his flatmate lying on the floor, blood oozing from a small hole in his chest. One side of his white button-down is already covered with wet crimson, making his already pale skin look sheet white. Quite a few items normally on shelves lay on the floor around him, no doubt pulled down with several attempts to pull himself up to stand or for a towel to stop the bleeding.
Mycroft gets his comeuppance?
“I am happy.”
My poor precious John. :,(
Tune in next Sunday for the final chapter of KYFC, otherwise known as Kind Yodelers Fond of Coffee.😂
Oh, and then there's some porn, y'all.
“You’re right,” he breathes, a tear slipping from his eye and trickling down his cheek. “I know you’re right. But it’s so hard.”
The detective lies to the doctor.
Love, Jane
7. Who is the other skater helping Moriarty? That's an intriguing question there, and
“You really think so?” Sherlock’s brow creased with confusion as John studied his reaction. It was positively endearing, perhaps because it was so unexpected. Sherlock had obviously made his deductions to impress, but still seemed genuinely surprised by John’s response. He was not used to being praised for his abilities, which told John all he needed to know about some of the assholes at New Scotland Yard.
I’m Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
He blows out a breath and takes his hands out of his pockets. John had plenty of chances to change his mind when he looked up the retired doctor’s address and while driving the hour and a half to the cheerful little neighborhood. He is here now. He might as well get on with it.
John gives him a roguish grin before turning to start up the ladder. It is harder than it should be, so he goes slowly. The pain of the wound has lessened, but his muscles are tight and pained. There is no cramping yet, but it is only a matter of time. It will most likely start in his calves, which will make climbing this damn ladder even harder. John grits his teeth and concentrates on his task, moving one foot up and then the other, one rung at a time.
“You’ve no reason to fear, John. No reason to hide. That is all behind you and has no bearing on us now,” he explains in a very serious tone. “It will not write our future or cloud my view of you. No relationship is exactly like another.”
So open and honest and yet, such a mystery. John would tell him anything if he only asked, even the personal and painful. John seems so responsive when Sherlock’s resolve slips and finds himself flirting, but truth be told, Sherlock is not entirely certain of John’s interest or orientation, for that matter. The stories of his past relationships are just vague enough that Sherlock has not gathered whether they were with men or women or both. They all have ambiguous names like Chris and Jamie, and are just short enough to provide the gist with no real details. Sherlock still cannot seem to deduce him either, not to the extent that he can everyone else. John cannot possibly know how he confounds Sherlock.
“Now move into your corner and stay there. Straight up and legs spread.” Sherlock quickly shuffled over and faced the wall. At least he hadn't been whipped or beaten or flogged or paddled. This was easy.
“You made him a vampire?”
“I sure will.” She pleasantly smiled and followed Mike and Sherlock. They didn't speak until they sat in a black sedan. He was moved into the back and sat beside Anthea. Mike sat behind the wheel and rather quickly rode away.
“Now you look like a bug struggling to get on its legs again. And you should try it because I won't help you.” John stepped over him and left the playroom. He could watch his struggles later because the camera also recorded.
“It’s all fine, love. It’s perfectly normal.” Sherlock trembled and John placed him on a kitchen chair. Then he handed him a glass of wine.
“No, not really. I am sorry, DI Lestrade. I am causing problems for you.”
“What?” He smirked.
“Thanks for all the food, Mrs Hudson. We appreciate it!”
Sherlock remembered all this very fondly.
“It wasn't what I meant to imply...” He helplessly shook his head.
“Stop thinking, John!” Instead, he held up his arm and tried to touch Sherlock. Sherlock just smiled and threw himself onto John. He kissed him all over, he licked and sucked and did other unspeakable things. The speed with which he was doing this was unnatural and John tried very hard to give something back or at least cope with all that.
“We'll see!” Now Sherlock shook him by wounding his long fingers around his neck.
Finally, he tried Sherlock who actually answered his phone almost cheerily.
He quickly fell asleep afterwards thinking of John and that he would be going home tomorrow.
“Well, that's not going to happen anymore. Remember, Sherlock, you are a human being. You are free. What John Watson did to you wasn't what a proper dom would do. He was a manic sadist and he tortured you. Now wake up and take a plate and fill it with all the things you want.”
“I am easy, you know. You can make me happy easily. I am not complicated. I love my ropes. I enjoy being fucked when I am helpless. I would like to borrow your mask. I also like to be given names but I know you don’t like it. Pain is just fine; use the riding crop I saw in your bag. Use the clamps. Force me to come again and again.” Greg shrugged. “That’s it so far.”
“I’ll give you old man…” John muttered and threw his body down. Sherlock shrieked and they started to play fight. John tickled him without mercy and Sherlock yelled the house down. Finally, John sat on his stomach holding his hands down by his head.
Finally, his cock disappeared into its mouth. Its tongue worked wonders and it took it deep into its throat. It swallowed around it, sucked, and licked in perfect motions. He groaned and fisted the hair. He started to push into his plaything.
“You still have to punish me and forgive me. It needs to be done. Afterwards, it is back to business.” John just stared at him. Rather blankly indeed. It made Sherlock continue.
“Next time you will be more careful. Do not fret! I will take a shower now and so should you. Care to join me?” John asked with a coy smile on his face. Sherlock looked at him and couldn't but smile back.
“Yes, Master.” Sherlock quietly replied.
Several days later, John had his football date with Greg. Sherlock had called it that and John just shook his head. He got ready and dressed up in a proper shirt and scarf.
“Hang them up, please?” Just for a second, he hesitated and chewed his lips, but then he bent down and hung them at the back of the door.
“He is able to deduce almost everything about everyone. People cheating on each other, their weaknesses, habits, everything. People normally hate it.”
“Look.” They both looked at the screen and slowly John’s eyes widened. Sherlock had bookmarked several porn videos showing male bondage. Men were flogged and sexually tortured by electric stimulation; they were edged or forced to cum.
Sherlock was kneeling behind an armchair and knew he had to do something. If he let him come too close, he would lose. And he can't lose. He needed to safe John and call an ambulance.
“Sherlock, come down!” John tried to force him by his voice but Sherlock only hectically swallowed and started to rant.
“I didn't have to since I have eyes in my head.” He moved around Sherlock who wiggled and moved.
“Well, it was a bit weird. His injuries aren’t too bad. He is weak and feeling sick because he had swallowed too much of Thames.” Both men grinned. “But he had a crying fit. He kept clinging to me and didn’t want to be left behind. He never reacted like that before.” John was clueless.
“I guess you are right.” She looked out of the window while Anthea rode through London and returned to Mycroft's house. She had already sent a text to Sherlock and informed him that everything was alright. She had also informed her boss and called Dr Kim.
Mycroft and Greg stayed behind. Mycroft very well noticed them leave but Greg didn’t. He was fully concentrated on Mycroft.
“Greg, John.” He acknowledged both men and sat down, too. John brought the dessert and Mycroft simply stared at it.
“Sherlock, how are you?” Ian asked moving closer. Sherlock looked up at him and smiled.
‘”Huh.” Greg made a sound that told Sherlock he was absolutely clueless.
“I will go and see my brother. Please, think about everything that happened. I already did.” Sherlock finally left his bedroom and made a beeline around John to grab his coat.
“I know what you are talking about, brother dear. But believe me, he will still like you after the weekend. It will all be just fine.” They locked eyes and suddenly Mycroft smiled.
“He must tell you who shot him so measures may be taken,” Mycroft squares his shoulders and says forcefully. John just looks back at him with an angry smile.
Love, Jane
Sherlock forces his drooping eyelids to open again and renews his hold on Moriarty’s wrists. He twists his legs out from under the man and wraps them around his waist, rocking from one side to the other. Moriarty frantically tries to stop him as he gains the momentum he needs to switch their positions. Moriarty squeezes Sherlock’s neck with his fingers, bruising it with an iron grip. Sherlock clenches his jaw and rocks harder, faster until they flip over completely. Moriarty finally releases Sherlock’s throat as their bodies roll. He thrashes his arms, trying to grab anything he can to keep Sherlock beneath him, but fails and falls flat on his back. His left hand crashes to the deck with a loud thud and a spike of pain that has him crying out. Both men glance toward it to see that his knuckles struck the flare gun that went flying when Moriarty attacked Sherlock.
Keep it down on the low key
“Molly.”
She steps forward, undressing him with a fiery look. When her focus returns to his eyes, she is pleased to see they are focused on her bosom, but soon realizes they are looking at something lower.
1. As I was saying, who is the culprit and how was it done?
“John,” Sherlock whispers urgently and John knows. He tilts his head in acquiescence, allowing Sherlock to push the blanket off of his right shoulder. The doctor takes a long pull from the teacup before giving it to Sherlock so he can place it on a nearby table. John sighs and raises his arms, angling his head down to look at Sherlock’s new discovery.
“They have been involved for quite some time. You can see it,” he muttered. The soft wisp of his breath made John shiver and he turned to face him, their faces dangerously close.
1. Now that Greg's in on it, will their three pairs of eyes catch something in the bouts to come?
“Have a lot of overnight guests, do you?” John smirks, already knowing the answer.
“The bouts are televised?”
“Yes,” Sherlock whispers after a few seconds of thought and John smiles.
Much love, Jane
I get down to the beat, I lose contro-oh-oh-oh-l
Sherlock studies John’s face carefully, gleaning it all from his features. He knows what happened next, but there is no way in hell he is going to let on. He straightens his middle finger again and touches John’s elbow gently. Instead of pulling away again after contact, Sherlock lets his fingertip remain against John’s arm, wishing the doctor had worn a short-sleeved shirt.
Much love, Jane
“I was born here,” he says simply. “In a suburb. Our house was on a cul de sac. It was one of those storybook neighborhoods. Everyone knew each other, the schools were close, we skated to the playground.”
He clicks his tongue and slips out the door, closing it on his way. With a small smile on his lips, Greg lets his eyes slide from the door to his coach. Sherlock is glaring back at him.
John looks back at Billy to see a smile growing on his face. He looks down at the floor and corrects himself.
Hey, it seems like I just did question time without even realizing and not in the usual format. Bugger.
“G’night, Papa.”
“In! In! Out, out, out!”
“Obviously he has conceived of some other method of delivery,” Sherlock snaps.
I'll see you on the other side. Enjoy!
“Ah, well,” Sherlock fumbles for words. Sherlock hates being off-balance, taken by surprise. He struggles for equilibrium. “Houses are meant to be shared, not kept by a single man.”
Sherlock presses forward until his lips touch John’s gently. They are warm and soft and perfect. All of the thoughts that normally fill Sherlock’s head suddenly stand still. The only one that seems important stems from the kiss he is currently sharing with his flatmate. The one causing a tingle in his belly that builds as the kiss continues. His eyes slip closed and  he presses a little harder against John’s lips, parting his own ever so slightly. John follows suit. Sherlock feels like he sucks the air right out of the smaller man when he gasps at being granted access. His tongue ventures out hesitantly, its tip just touching John’s bottom lip gently and for only a second before darting back in his mouth.
After a few more minutes of indulgence, Sherlock releases John and sits again. The two of them talk easily and light-heartedly, giggling and laughing. Sherlock had almost forgotten how good it felt to do this. To just talk to John.
“Are you okay?” John asks with raised eyebrows.
“No,” Sherlock replies.
“Who is Mary Morstan?” John asks breathlessly. He knows, but there’s so much he doesn’t. He needs to know.
And now, because I can and because I'm not in pain right now, it's question time.
Blocker - a skater who tries to prevent the jammer from skating around the track and scoring points.
“Well, we are delighted to hear that. Aren’t you delighted, Greg?” he answers sarcastically, finally glancing at the GM and ignoring his incredulous frown. “Has this man worked in derby before you so graciously added him to our ranks?”
He never did find his voice before John continued speaking. John did not think better of saying the word and Sherlock never brought it up, not wanting to hear John correct himself. Sherlock knows he should forget it, assume it was a slip of the tongue and not pin any hopes on it. His conversation with Greg weeks ago has still not motivated him to say a word to John for fear of what the doctor will say. For the time being, he would still rather live in ignorance and misguided hope than know John does not think of him in that way.
“I’m afraid that’ll change once I’ve been here a few more months.”
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock nearly choked on his words. He clearly had not deduced the full extent of their relationship. Maybe Sherlock had not asked Greg about him after all. John’s heart sank a little. Then he saw Sherlock’s eyes fall to his left hand, looking for a ring then. John’s heartbeat sped up just a bit for that gesture alone.
He runs through tomorrow’s plan while the elevator takes him to the lobby. He has plenty of time as it stops on nearly every floor to pick up what always seems to be a parent with children bound for the hotel swimming pool. He rolls his eyes and tries to concentrate over the din. The bout starts at seven, the ladies have all afternoon to do weights on their own with warm-ups starting around 5:30. Since they put in a long practice today, on top of the flight, tomorrow morning is free for sight-seeing and relaxation. Sherlock has heard some of the ladies making plans, mostly involving spas and massages. For his money, there are several historic sites to choose from, not the least of which is the home of Edgar Allan Poe.
“What could she do? She thought it was unfair and hated seeing my dreams crushed. She was angry as hell, but she couldn’t change it. Neither could I.”
What?? John, no! NOOOO!  Talk about sacrificing yourself for the one you love. Eesh. And poor, poor Sherlock. He's so grief-stricken he doesn't even see the truth when Greg says it. And what does he immediately turn to for solace? Sherlock, no!
“What?”
Jim makes yet another attempt on Sherlock's life and fails. How odd. It's almost as if it's all part of some grand plan (or game). Da da daaaaa!
“My pleasure, Captain,” Harry salutes and skates to the outside edge of the track with a broad grin on her face.
“Come to my office this afternoon. Allie will have it to us within the hour,” Greg tells him. He gets a quick nod from Sherlock as he walks out the door.
I can't help myself. Take some solace in knowing it happens to me too. I really surprise myself with some of the stuff I write because even I have forgotten some of the nitty-gritty by the time I've finished a story and begin typing and editing. It's true, really. When I edited this one, I got to the end and just exhaled a quiet "uhh". I felt totally deflated and thought 'Damn, Jane, you really wound me up for that goodnight'. I felt like John with the disappointment in my eyes and whatnot. I do hope you have all come to love my villainy be cause it isn't going to stop. Mwahahaha! (diabolical laughter, diabolical acting) More bonus points if you know where that one's from.
Will Sherlock hold to his philosophy of no relationships, no complications, no sentiment? (I'll give you a clue - He's already failing at the no sentiment one, but I'm sure you picked up on that.)
That is exactly why Sherlock has avoided John since that first day they met. He knew this would happen and he will not allow entanglements. John has attended nearly every practice and Sherlock has all but run from the track each time to keep from talking to the doctor and risking a conversation just like this one. Now he is trapped. He could not escape John’s gaze if he wanted to and he cannot keep himself from glancing at John’s mouth or wishing he could touch him.
“Thank you for driving me,” Sherlock says softly, “and for suggesting dinner. I enjoyed it very much.”
The giggles begin anew and only slow when Sherlock realizes John’s hand is still on his. He looks down at it solemnly and then meets John’s eyes again. He sees all the blues of the sea and his mind begins to catalog them all. He sees pure and utter fondness and friendship. He sees his future.
I love reading all your thoughts and fears in the comments and look forward to more. A shout-out to my Pat, Purrfect and Brna, and newbie Anna, all of whom have helped me battle fiercely against a downturn in mood of late. Thank you so very much. To my beloved Sherly, Hiddles and Julie, I hope you are all well and I see you again soon.
“Well, I can’t wait to hear this,” Greg crosses his arms over his chest. John hesitates. “Oh, come on. You can’t say that and not tell me.”
“Somehow, in all the bouts we’d watched, I never deduced that all female teams meant it was a women’s only sport,” Sherlock pauses thoughtfully and marvels at how caught up John is. He has never had such an attentive audience and his damn stomach flips again. “I told Molly as soon as I got home.”
Mycroft makes an absurd suggestion.
Please suggest away!
Now, back to the story. I love this case and invested a lot of time into letting it develop. The characters I created for it are some of my faves. I also had a lot of fun with the accent. I also wanted to use it to make my own personal statement about something, but you'll see that later.
* When will John talk to Sherlock and what will he say? (Is this the "I don't think we can be together anymore" conversation? AHH! Hearts breaking)
Sherlock’s expression changes to one of hesitance, but he lifts his hand and places it on John’s where it rests in his lap. He wets his lips and picks up John’s hand with both of his, facing his palm out. The doctor’s arm is bent at the elbow and he watches as the detective presses their palms together. John slides his fingers in between Sherlock’s and clasps his larger hand. The man’s long fingers immediately fold over his friend’s.
I just realized how that sounds. Don't worry. I'll keep updating. :)
Sweet baby jesus. I forgot the questions. How could this happen? I'm surprised you all didn't think the evil empire finally found me and replaced me with a pod. Rest assured, I'm still me and no impostors have taken over. That said, here we go...
“No. No, not this time,” Sherlock fumbles. “She did when we were here last year.”
“Exactly,” Greg says emphatically, pointing a finger. He turns to John suddenly. “And we need to keep you safe.”
“I’ll be fine, Sherlock,” John assures him warmly. The detective nods as he rises and places his own dishes in the sink. He walks back to the table. John looks up at him in surprise when he rests a hand on John’s shoulder.
Without a thought to his footwear or the floors, Sherlock skates from his position near the track and across the stadium to the exit closest to the team offices. Once up the elevator and in the hall, he continues to skate along the fairly flat carpeting until he bursts into Greg’s office. It shouldn’t take the man by surprise because he has stormed the office before, not to mention they were just speaking on the phone, but somehow it does and Greg jumps slightly when Sherlock rolls in. Greg rests his elbows on his desk and tilts his head warily to watch the wheeled man pace back and forth before him.
“And what, Gregory?” Mycroft looked cold.
“Well, you need to hold it for a while longer. It's not yet time to let go.” He patted his head and turned around. He picked up his mobile and set an alarm.
Back in their flat he placed him in the tub and washed him. James just let him which spoke for itself. And only when he had covered him with his duvet and he had fallen asleep, he took care of himself. He had a snack and a rather huge drink. And then another one. With shaking fingers, he smoked on the balcony when his mobile dinged.
“Later, yes. Not tonight. Tonight, I only want you in my bed. I want to hold you and kiss you.” Mycroft smiled.
“You know, I also could collect everything into a bottle and make you drink it later. Or I could force it into your backside with the kitchen funnel. It just might start all over again.” Sherlock looked up and his stare was wondrous. Could he believe what he had just heard?
“Thank you, Master.” Sherlock carefully sat down to avoid putting too much pressure on his behind. He saw the table had already been set up. And it had been set up for two. His dom didn't want him to eat out of his bowl tonight. Sherlock was so thankful, he almost teared up.
“What else do we have to bring?” John asked.
“Come in, Mrs Hudson.” She entered the room and carried a tray with a full English breakfast.
“Whenever someone gives you an order, you will obey and say
Mycroft wondered if he should have let him go home. But he had wanted to see him. Touch him. Hear his voice. Had he been selfish? Should he have provided more for Gregory than just pyjamas and a warm bed?
“You are right, of course. Call him. I will be your company.” She sipped from her drink and looked at him over the rim. Greg got his mobile out of his pocket and pushed the number for Mycroft Holmes private line. He answered quickly.
For a few seconds, Mycroft just looked at him.
He had no idea how long he had been trained to become the perfect submissive. He had lost all hopes of being rescued. By whom anyway? He just wanted to live. So, he did what being told. Every day. Again, and again.
“Or not?” Greg said but stood and took a pair of cut-off jeans and an old soft t-shirt for himself.
“You are an interesting man, John. I would like to further explore you. Sexually, I mean.” He breathed the last words into his hear and John completely stilled. He was tense and the urge to get away was bubbling up.
“See? He loves the new you.” Sherlock read John's reply. It consists of several hearts and a thumbs-up emoji.
“Do you miss using his livestock?” That question made Sherlock hold him closer.
“What happened today?” Sherlock asked quietly and sat by John’s side.
He chewed on his lips and returned into the kitchen where he had started preparing breakfast. Cook wasn't yet up and he had taken over. He needed something to do, otherwise he would become mad. He snorted. His brain needed the work even though it was only breakfast to work on.
Sherlock sat behind the wheel and obviously had fun. His elbow was resting on the window frame and he held the wheel with only one hand. Or more with only a few fingers of said hand. He also was driving really fast.
Greg, John, and Sherlock parked in a small forest close to a village near the coast. Greg broke into a cottage and stole some ill-fitting clothes, money and a mobile while the owners were fast asleep. Then he called an old mate and asked for his boat. Then John called someone who owed him a favour and got themselves weapons. Sherlock had no one to call. He looked between Greg and John.
“Please… Please… Please…” He begged looking desperate. He had understood what John was doing and he earned a grin in return.
Sergej untied him until only his wrists were tied. He left both the blindfold and the gag. He gently helped him up and made him sit on the sofa. He pulled him against his body and started to touch him. Soon enough he removed the plug and dropped it. He also removed the ball-gag. He started to tease him with the chain and he weakly moaned. He suddenly ripped off one clamp and Mycroft yelled roughly. His chest was heaving but he didn't move a lot. He ripped off the second clamp and used his wet fingertips to tease them. Mycroft arched up, tensed, and came for the second time.
“We will be forming a pack. Both vampires and Lycans. They also know Moriarty. He is their enemy as well.”
“I am glad to hear that.” Sherlock relaxed and rolled on his side with the blanket up. “Come to bed?” He asked already yawning. John happily complied and moved under the blanket with him. He liked it when Sherlock put his long arm around him and let him sleep beneath it, under his shoulder where he could press his nose against his soft, warm skin. It made sure he’d have no nightmares at all.
“Nice!” Greg exclaimed laughing. John shrugged.
“I will talk to the locals about satanic cults or crimes related to satanism.” Greg said.
“Actually, I am rather hungry. I haven’t eaten in the hospital. Do you think we can find something?” Hopefully, he looked up at him.
“What do you want, brother mine?” He asked.
“Sherlock, I’ll help Dr Turner. Will you please wait for me?” Sherlock nodded.
“Lube!” Sherlock thought but didn't say.
“I already told you everything I know. We haven't been doing business together for a very long time. I have my own business. Legal business. Of course, I still have relations and know stuff.” He nonchalantly shrugged.
“I worked on his cold cases. At first, it was difficult. It felt like my brain wasn't able to work as it did before. I was very angry and I welcomed the emotion. Any emotion is good. Feeling is good. Letting it out is good.” Mycroft wondered if he also had worked on his computer and researched his mental health.
“We will need to wait for a bit after just having had lunch. But I want to talk to you about something I found out this morning.” Sherlock explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s unbelievable,” he sighs and turns his eyes to Sherlock. “I just can’t believe it. She was so small and...and now she’s such a wonderful, outspoken girl. And you… It’s all down to you.”
“John,” Sherlock snakes a stealthy hand under the blanket and squeezes John’s thigh. The doctor quiets almost instantly, his eyes shifting to the coach. His entire demeanor has changed. Gone are the razor sharp edges in his posture and the hardness in his eyes, as the anger seems to drain from his body. “You need the stitches and you know it.”
“All right, ladies,” Sherlock announces. “Everyone sit down and behave yourselves.”
The bow slips releasing a screech of notes from the instrument’s strings before Sherlock corrects and continues the song’s melody. He turns his back to John and casts his gaze out the window once more.
John reaches for the apple and picks it up, setting his mug on the table as he does so. He looks at the bite that was taken and slowly rotates the shiny red orb in his hand. As the other side comes into view, small marks scratched into the fruit’s skin with a fingernail spell out words that make John’s heart go cold.  ‘I need you’.
I think that's all we need. So, without further ado...
As they talk with Greg, John holds on to the hope that he and Sherlock can resume their conversation, but it is all in vain. By the time they are finished, John and Sherlock have just enough time to rush back to the hotel for a change of clothes, to collect the ladies and their gear, and hop the bus for the night’s venue. The ladies are scheduled for an extended warm-up before they take the track and Sherlock insists on keeping a schedule once he has made it. For his part, John tries to stay focused, but cannot get Sherlock’s last two words out of his mind.
“Oh my god,” John snorts, rocking back and forth. “I can’t believe you and Molly got away with that! Did he ever show up at your house and tell your parents?”
* Why do you torture John so?? He's such a good and sweet man. (I know. I love him too, but I'm afraid I often make my favorite characters suffer.)
Hey, everyone! Welcome back to Persistence.
“...Holmes so busy?” John extended his hand to wave with a flourish between the two of them. Sherlock watched him with smiling eyes and a dazzling grin on his face.
“Sherlock!” Greg’s voice is quiet, but dangerous.
“So he’s a surgeon then,” Sherlock speculates, but it is more of a statement than a question.
“But I’m waiting for him,” John told him dumbly with an exasperated sigh. Nothing like abandoning any attempt at being articulate.
“The Detroit Demons.”
In the end, John suggests coffee and Angelo is more than happy to oblige. Once the cups are delivered to the table and the restaurant’s proprietor gone, the two men talk and laugh together. They share stories they haven’t in years and even ones they have told no one before. Sherlock, for one, cannot believe the evening is real. He has never experienced anything quite like it. Molly is the only person he can talk to this freely. It does not make any sense, but he feels he has known John Watson for just as long and can trust him just as much. There is one very important difference, however. He has never wondered if Molly’s hair is as soft as it looks. Nor has he wondered the same about her lips.
John arrives at Sherlock's apartment in the dead of night.
“And may I remind you that I would never put any patient in that situation,” John replies hotly. “None of that was my doing. Although, you seem to know that.”
Love, Jane
What's going to happen with Sally and her attraction to Greg?
“You’re welcome,” he says, not knowing what else to say.

Sorry, friends, can't say anymore. Just read on, Macduff!
Sherlock picks up the violin case, the wine glass in his other hand, and goes into the living room. He sets both items down on the coffee table and looks out the large window for a moment before closing the curtains. Finally, he bends down and lifts the beloved violin from its case, plucking up the bow as he does. After a moment of preparation, he begins to play. He closes his eyes reverently and sways ever so slightly. He plays and plays, careful not to be too loud in the quiet hotel. So consumed by his playing is he that Sherlock almost misses the gentle knocks on his door.
“It is possible,” Sherlock lightens his tone. “You were fully submerged for quite some time and are still wearing the same clothing. I’m surprised your teeth aren’t chattering. I’m assuming you were out of breath before Greg found you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock, wait,” he steps forward in a rush, tossing the t-shirt on the bed. They are only a couple feet apart now and Sherlock can already feel heat radiating from his cheeks down through his neck and into his chest. He watches as John bites his own lip and wards away the thought of doing it to John himself. John looks at him apprehensively, visibly debating whether or not to share what is on his mind.
“Shall I take you back to the stadium?” John asks, breaking through the quiet spell in the air around them. “Did you drive in this morning?”
Hello Hello!! I’m back and I’m so sorry that I made you wait so long for this one. I took a little trip to Packer country last weekend and wasn’t able to work on it. It was a wonderful getaway though. I really needed the time away and spent some quality time with two really great friends. Don’t worry. It was a very safe and distanced. 😉 Oddly enough, we spent most of the time playing a detective game. It was so much fun, but we completely failed the first case! Our score was 8/24 for god sake. We did it a second time that went better and then excelled on the second case. I can't wait to get together again for number 3. Anyway, if you ever get a chance to play detective with your friends, do it.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s body relaxes and he lets out the breath he was holding. “Thank you. Please, come in.”
2. Considering the timing and all, was it one of Moriarty's crew or someone with Rock City?
“Holmes,” the man supplied when John paused, the dramatic effect it created not lost on either of them.
“Ah, and you want to pick my brain, eh? Some of the ladies are probably different now, you know.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock finds himself completely mystified by his flatmate. In defiance of all logic and belief, the mind of the Great Sherlock Holmes is SILENT. His only thoughts are of John. He wants to know everything. Every part of John’s body - touching, tasting, smelling, listening. Will John cry out at orgasm? Will he say Sherlock’s name? Will he curse? Likely, given his propensity to swear. Sherlock wants data and yet, cannot be troubled with it. He’s so swept up that all he wants is John. Not to think or reason or analyze. Just John.
Da da daaaaaa!!
Lead jammer - the jammer who breaks through the pack first (no points are scored on the initial break through. The lead jammer controls the jam and can call it off at any time, unless in the penalty box.
“I know, I just…” Sherlock finally met her eyes again. “I swore off that sort of sentiment after Victor. You know that. Caring about someone that deeply is not an advantage.”
I see my future when I look in your eyes
Sherlock popped his body to the beat, looking every bit the king of the dance floor. He was like a six foot tall snake slithering both elegantly and suggestively into John’s space and out again. It was the hottest goddamn thing John had seen in all his life.
“Why not? You’re here already and you’re right about your state of dress, especially considering the blood. You can’t go anywhere looking like this.”
“Observe,” John finishes.
“Personality trait? Are you saying he’s some kind of psychopath?” John’s tone is incredulous.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock mumbles.
“Shit! Stop. Stop!”
“There was poison in her system, Greg. A lot of it,” John interjects. “There’s no way it could’ve gotten there without someone administering it.”
Love, Jane
5) Will each man's insecurities get in the way or dating and a real relationship?
“I didn’t see him when I got home, but he was there,” John begins without being asked.
“You are the most intriguing man I have ever met.”
WAT. Just what. What the fuck, Jane. Five years. FIVE YEARS. GAH!!
Sherlock hesitated, studying John carefully. John knew immediately that Sherlock was not looking for more information. He had all of that already. Sherlock was assessing the damage his words might do to their budding friendship, or romance?
“Must you insist upon letting yourself into my flat?” Sherlock growls.
“Bullshit,” John barks, crossing his arms over his chest. Sherlock stops playing the violin abruptly and gives John a look of warning.
“Oh, God.”
Sherlock blinks. He cannot believe his ears. Trying to keep the surprise from his face, he concentrates on John’s features. Honesty and curiosity are the primary emotions he sees and they make him love John that much more. Flip.
“John, the point isn’t to kill me. It’s to burn me.”
Both men reached their stride as the chorus and the fun continued. John popped his chest to the beat, moving his bent arms in counterpoint and shifting his weight with what the rhythm provided. Sherlock’s hips swayed with his dancing feet and he lifted his hands above his head.
John merely made a suggestion and Sherlock agreed. He did not ask him out. Just because Sherlock is going to his favorite restaurant with a gorgeous man does not mean…
Mycroft to protect Sherlock (and John?), (to keep them apart?), to get Moriarty.
(You know he isn't finished.)
“Not that it isn’t reason enough,” The Woman leers and the bus erupts into laughter.
“Great. I’ll drive and you pick the place. I don’t know enough about the city yet to find something suitable.
“Sherlock,” Greg replies sternly, gesturing at the man, who finally comes to a stop directly in front of the desk, “need I remind you that Martha Hudson owns the team? She can hire anyone she likes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s one of the bigger ones in this building,” Sherlock tells him as they walk. “If I’m not buying a house, I might as well still have what I like.”
“Hold this.”
“There’s nothing to talk about. It can’t happen again.”
“This from the man who criticizes my Bond movies,” John retorts with a hand on his hip.
Personally, I love the way this one starts. Sherlock’s stunned in the bathroom thinking, “I told John I love him. I told John I love him.” and then immediately segues into “John loves me. John loves me.” But forever the problem, John doesn’t know it yet. C’est la vie. ... My ass. When is John going to figure it out? Come on, man! Those tingly, weird feelings you’re feeling are love. Love. Get with the program.
“Do someone else,” John urged, his voice full of excitement. He looked around quickly to find someone with a tale to tell. His eyes fell on a tall, thin man with disheveled brown hair that fell to his shoulders in layers. His chin and cheeks were covered by a full beard and mustache that betrayed his age with shades of grey, as did the lines around his eyes. He was dancing in a group with four other people, but more or less on his own. There was something about his appearance, his jumper and corduroy pants that made him look like someone who wore an aluminum foil hat at home.
“No offense, Billy, you know him better than I, but why would he believe me? He doesn’t believe Molly.”
“Coach!” HardOn had suddenly yelled form the track. “Stop mistreating Ph.D. He can’t take care of our sorry asses if you keep bustin’ his.”
Sarah swiftly shifts to The Crown’s steering column and engages the engine. Pulling back on the throttle, the boat springs to life and begins to move away from Sherlock. With most other boats scrambling to help and the police on their way, Sarah knows there is little chance of escape, but she’ll be damned if she doesn’t try. Obvious, but understandable, and not Sherlock’s priority. He has far more important matters to attend to.
“So, like a consultant,” John stated experimentally.
3. When John gets to Sherlock's place will he, as John so eloquently put it, kick him to the pavement?
The frightful anticipation is over and Jim is back.
“I suppose so,” he reflects, “but I would never have called it that at the time. Molly joined the derby class when she started high school. Coach Jones offered it after school, unofficially, of course. I think he only did it because Detroit has two teams, and because he liked it. Midway through the year, and at Molly’s urgence,  he let me join in coaching. I took a year of community college for Molly’s senior year so we could keep training.”
“John is genuine,” Greg talks over him and, for once, the younger man bites his tongue. In fact, it may be the first time it has ever happened. “What you see is real, not a facade. John knows who he is and has no interest in pretending otherwise. Not for anything or anyone.”
For the next three weeks, the three men watch everything at bouts as closely as they can. Whether home or away, Greg and John are always stationed in locations where, between them,  they can see every inch of the track and every member of both teams. Sherlock does his best to help while still coaching Rock City. But nothing happens. There are no suspicious injuries or accidents, nothing but the usual rough and tumble of a bout.
“Honestly,” Greg runs a hand through his salt and pepper hair, shaking his head in exasperation,  “I did too. But she obviously didn’t. I just got off the phone with her. She’s on her way here and thinks this doctor is the answer to our troubles. We can’t play without a team doctor and the season is about to start.“
Sherlock has a nightmare and keeps the truth of it from John.
“You can always join a gym,” Sherlock suggests. As he works, he takes notice of the wound’s odd shape and angle. It is oddly familiar and yet, like none he has ever seen before, and he has seen quite a bit throughout his ten years in derby. This is different. What kind of object would make a mark like this?
Okay, so I didn't ask a lot of smartass Deadpool style questions, but this whole endnote certainly has that feeling about it, no? Needless to say, I love it. :D I have also recently discovered I love the show Firefly, but that is another story.
Thank you again for all your love and support! I hope you loved this chapter and enjoy the ones to come.
Stay tuned for the next chapter. As you can see, this part is much more subdued than the last, but how long will that last? You all know me, after all. (infamous eyebrow waggle) Thank you for all the love and support, and happy reading!
“Anytime. Anytime you feel like getting yourself almost killed,” Greg cocks a brow and shakes his head. “Never a dull moment with you two.”
Sherlock furrows his brow deeply and watches John closely, but remains silent. For a moment, John thinks he is going to say something. That all the feelings he hopes Sherlock hides away will spill forth like a damn breaking and flood their flat with possibilities. There is a light just beginning to shine in those piercing silver eyes that John would like to coax into a flame burning brightly, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared and Sherlock closes himself off. He lifts the violin once again and resumes playing.
Yas! I had fun writing this chapter. I mean, some of it maybe not, but most of it. I didn't realize it was going to be so long. It just sort of happened that way. I hope you all enjoy it!
Hello, hello, my friends! I’m so sorry it’s been so long since our last meeting. God, I’ve missed you all. It’s been a hell of a couple of weeks, but all is well. I hope this finds all of you well too. I’m sorry to have left you dangling over the cliff all this time. Trust me when I say it was not intentional. Please forgive me. I certainly can’t wait for you all to read this next, long-awaited chapter, so I’ll get right down to it after I thank my wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. She brings out the best in me and words cannot express my gratitude.
“Certainly not!” Sherlock replies indignantly and wishes he could take it back as soon as he sees John’s face. Definitely not the best way to react when John still has no understanding of his personality at all. “Sorry.”
The case continues.
“Tonight?” Sherlock interrupted. A sly grin spread across his features and he shook his head slowly. “You forget that I’m here nearly every time you are and more. This place is a hotbed of experiments for me, an opportunity to sharpen my skills and occasionally solve a case.”
Letting his lips curl into an affectionate smile, he relaxes into the bed and gazes at his flatmate. He silently catalogs John’s little movements - his eyes flitting back and forth beneath his eyelids, the occasional twitching of his lips. Sherlock spends extra time studying those lips and very lightly touches his fingers to them, but pulls his hand back quickly when John suddenly jerks his head away. Sherlock holds his breath as John grows still again.
“Oh, sure. Of course he isn’t,” Angelo winks at John conspiratorially. “Come. I’ll take you to his table.”
“Eh, no,” John answers slowly, mild confusion on his face. He is probably trying to figure out what the hell Sherlock is playing at. Sherlock glances toward the restroom. Maybe he should excuse himself, slip into the shadows and hope the moment has passed by the time he returns. Or maybe he could climb through the small window by the sinks.
Where does this leave them?
“We have all the time in the world,” he says fondly.
Back to Baker Street
Hooray!!!!! John is saved!
John spent months denying it. Then a couple years. Everything was going well and then Sherlock met The Woman. John was jealous as hell, but tried not to show it. Poorly. Fortunately, the world’s only consulting detective never caught on. He really can be so dim sometimes. John kept dating a few months and then just gave up. He found himself comparing every woman he went out with to Sherlock, or he constantly thought about Sherlock when he was on a date. Or not on a date. Kind of all the time. And it didn’t bother him in the least. He loved thinking about his flatmate and looking at his flatmate and talking to his flatmate. That was when John realized…
“I’ve given it all up,” Sherlock says fiercely, but his voice trembles. “Love, relationships. I let myself fall in love and it nearly broke me. I can’t let myself be hurt like that again. I threw myself into derby and never looked back.”
Unacceptable.
“She is safe, John,” Sherlock assures him. “I called in a favor long ago. Mycroft is his name. He was an officer and then chief of police in Tampa before retiring early and moving to Detroit. He does short stints as a security guard when he gets bored and spends the rest of his time as he pleases. He has been watching Molly’s room nearly the whole of her hospital stay and will continue to do so.”
“Fuck! Are you all right?” Sherlock straddles his hips and rests on all fours above him, his hands on either side of John’s head. “John. John! Just try to relax, okay? That’s it. Take deep, slow breaths.”
“She checked all of her equipment a few hours before the bout. It was all fine, but a bearing came loose and the wheel flew right off,” Billy’s voice is very grave. “Even that could have been coincidence, but her knee pad blew out as soon as she hit the ground. There’s no way. No way in hell.”
John laughed and gave a nod at that.
“It would be my pleasure,” John jokes.
“Why?”
I'd love to see you all one last time before I go back into my cave to write some more.
He raises his hand slowly and places it on Sherlock’s shoulder. Greg thinks the taller man may pull away, but he doesn’t.
“What happened?” Sherlock asks, trying no to notice the flip in his stomach at that first touch.
“Pretty obvious,” John crosses his arms over his chest. “You said his name just now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is none of your business,” Sherlock begins in a voice of quietly controlled fury.
He raises his eyes to meet John’s. “Have you ever married?”
is a true team. A team of equals, partners. That is what he has always worked toward and that emphasis has made his team unique.
“Is he gay?”
“I don’t doubt it,” John chuckled. He met Sherlock’s eyes. “I’d love to hear about it. Somewhere else,” he took a steadying breath. What the hell was he doing? “Quieter so we don’t have to yell.”
John could see the cautious pride shining through the haughty answer.
“Ready then, ladies?” The Woman asks with a broad grin on her blood red lips.
“So,” John began slowly, a thoughtful expression on his face as if he was giving Sherlock’s proposal serious consideration and not bouncing off the walls with excitement, “tea and cases at yours then?”
Oh my god. Action-packed (I hope all the derby action was understandable), another injury (the plot thickens), and then a tender moment for our leading men. Awwwww. I know what you’re saying: Jane, this fucking chapter has it all! What is in store for Rock City? (Defeat? Glory?) What is in store for our intrepid duo? (Danger? Romance?) Only time will tell, my friends. Oh, to know the inner workings of The Mind of Jane. ‘Tis a scary place.
“What? Jesus, Sherlock.”
Here it is, friends, chapter 10!
something is bothering you and I’m sure it’s to do with the accidents. What is it, Sherlock?”
* How long will this truce between the brothers Holmes last? Has Mycroft finally learned his lesson?
“No worries,” John’s hand is at the back of his neck again, his brows raised. “I guess I should call the police.”
“Okay, Sherlock, I get it. I’m sorry,” John murmured. “I was...disappointed.”
“Got here when you said we’d meet,” John said sharply. His tone was more harsh than he had planned, but he had truly grown tired of repeating the same scenario over and over.
“Quite.”
Their lips move together, even as their mouths remain closed. Sherlock feels dizzy. He has never felt so good or whole in his life. He finds John’s arms with his hands and holds on gently. John squeezes his shoulders and parts his lips just a crack. Sherlock immediately feels the humidity from his breath and lets out one of his own in a rush, like a moan with no sound. John kisses him with fervor. There are sighs into mouths, and across faces and lips. Though the kiss remains chaste, breathing grows heavier and faster. Motivated by blind desire, Sherlock tightens his grip on John’s arms and takes John’s bottom lip in between his own. He sucks lightly, eliciting a loud moan from John, and he nearly comes in his pants right then and there. Sherlock breaks away quickly, desperate to regain control. He drops his head back against the wall and takes in a shallow breath. John does much the same, leaning his head forward and resting his forehead on Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock swallows hard and then sucks in a harsh breath when he feels John’s gentle, incredibly warm lips on his throat. John is smiling against his skin. He brushes his lips over Sherlock’s Adam’s apple and then straightens his own neck, pulling away from the taller man. Sherlock lifts his head from the wall and looks down at John, into his eyes blown wide with want.
“Seriously, Sherlock, you have to stop coming here every night,” Molly had chided. “I know you’re behind on all that extra work you do after hours. You’d have to be by now.”
“Greg,” John’s voice is sincere and full of emotion. Greg looks at him with wide, concerned eyes and John must admit that the edge in his tone surprises even him.
5. Why, Jane? Why do you toy with us so?
Thank you all for your support - likes and comments and hits. I just can't believe the amazing response to this story. I am truly blown away. Please if you have anything urgent to say or any questions, I'd love to hear from you. All the love means so, so much to me. Thank you all.
“What?” John huffs a startled laugh. “No. That isn’t what I meant at all. Look, I know I left abruptly.”
“I know, but it’s not particularly healthy and... I worry about you.” Now John continues very carefully. “Especially with these nightmares.”
I hope that all makes sense. Off we go!
“Promise me.”
Two hours after they arrived, they are all climbing into the bus again. Sherlock grabs John’s elbow lightly before the man gets a foot on the first step. He pulls the doctor aside and speaks to him quietly as skaters continue disappearing into the vehicle.
“I most certainly do not!” Sherlock raises his chin, straightening his long neck. He looks down his nose at John. “I merely appreciate a job well done.”
“Whatever you store things in, search it all,” Greg clarifies in a stern voice. “Look for any similarities or people who were always there.”
Molly to regain Sherlock's trust and friendship.
Did I mention Mycroft is a meddling sod? Try utter bastard.
“Sherlock, promise me.” John is in full Captain Watson mode now. “No unusually stupid risks or ducking out on me to go it alone. No drugs. I’ll know. You know I’ll know.”
Today is a good day and I'm in a crazy mood, so DP all the way!
“It’s bad enough that you deduced it with your limited faculties…”
When he turns to John again, he means to speak, but the words die in his throat and come out as more of a gasp. John is just pulling the t-shirt over his head, tousling his blonde hair as it sweeps past it. He drops it on the bed next to him and looks at Sherlock expectantly, but the coach just gapes. John is gorgeous. His sun-kissed skin looks smooth and almost silky, stretching over his pectorals to his shoulders and down over the mostly defined muscles of his abdomen. There is not a single hair on his broad chest and his nipples are peaking from the slight chill in the air conditioned room. He looks like an underwear model and Sherlock’s mind floods with ways to worship every inch of his body.
“What??” Sherlock ceases his pacing and gesturing to stare at Greg, utterly taken aback. Greg’s lips creep up on one side, giving him a kind of crooked smile. He has the upper hand now and intends upon using it to the fullest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s eyes fly to John’s face. He was relaxed and cracking jokes earlier, but now wears an expression of curiosity that creeps in the direction of worry. Sherlock looks away as he tears open the package in his hands. He has placed the first one in seconds and then the other.
I will see you again next weekend, my friends. Thank you for your love and support. You comments and kudos are treasured, as is each of you. Keep safe, stay inside, good work, good night. I'll most likely kill you in the morning. Hahaha. Bonus points if you know where that line was plucked from!
fit that bill. To make matters worse, he never understood my relationship with Molly and hated our marathon phone calls once a week. We divorced a year after graduation.”
Anyway....who is the shooter and is Moriarty dead?
“Let me take him to the deck below,” he says to the officer. “There are no weapons down there and we won’t try to escape. Please. He needs to warm up.”
1. But Jane, what questions can there be? The story is over.
(See the end of the chapter for
But he does not.
1. Now that Sherlock knows, will/when he give in and let himself show it?
John blinks and pushes away the thoughts more forcefully this time. Now is not the time for nightmarish questions that will drive his mind into darkness. If John is going to think about Bill at all and how he fits into who John is today, he has to remain objective. If John had to guess, he would say losing Bill contributed, but he was already doing it before Bill. In fact, Bill seemed to have been the only exception and now Sherlock is too.
I want to draw your attention to the increase in chapters. Twelve will be the final number. And the number that will be counted is twelve. Thirteen is right out. And so is eleven, unless it be followed by twelve. (Mwahahaha! You guessed it. I'm in a mood again.)
Minutes later, they stand at the door to Sherlock’s suite. Neither has said a word and Sherlock feels like a complete idiot. Why the hell did he think
* Will Greg really show up in time for dinner? Just what is slowing him down anyway?
“I know, Greg, I know,” she shakes her head. “You’ll just have to trust me.”
“I can’t, Greg.”
“We weren’t a wealthy family,” he begins, “but what my parents were rich in was connections. My mum’s best friend was a tutor, so she came to work with me in the evenings. When I was old enough, dad got me into an upscale public school. He coached the entire board at cricket in the summer. They even talked my way into uni and medical school. My marks and accomplishments helped too, but it was mostly them. They knew everyone and everyone thought the world of them.”
“I remember,” John pauses, “but what does that mean? He wants to hurt you?”
Do I try to find something to go with John and Sherlock telling Greg what’s been going on, but how hard is that? Believe me, HARD. I kept looking at songs that give you courage to go into the breach, as it were, but nothing fit. At all.
“John?” he calls a little louder.
“Did you have some reason for coming to my room at this hour?” he asks in a clipped and rude tone he immediately regrets. He blows out a frustrated breath as John’s playful grin fades into startled dejection. Sherlock rushes to put it right. “John…”
“I know,” he replies like a sullen teenager. He meets Greg’s eyes and already knows what he is going to say next. Rolling his own eyes, he blows out a breath that flutters the curls resting on his forehead. “I’ll be nice.”
* Holy shit. Where DID Sherlock learn to fight like that?? (It's a bit like I felt while watching S4 and Sherlock kicked ass not only in the flat, but in that swimming pool at that guy's house. I think it was episode 1. It was like being Dr. Strange rubbed off in more ways than just bigger muscles to fill out his *ehhem* entirely new Sherlock wardrobe because his previous little Sherlock garb was too small for him and said muscles. My eyes are popping here.)
2. If he does, will Sherlock be annoyed that John has stuck his nose in? Molly did say Sherlock was trying to gather more data, after all.
“I didn’t love her,” John stumbles on, sounding more ridiculous by the minute.
Now, what will John's first bout bring? His first time in the heat of the competition and with Rock City's arch rivals, no less. Suffice it to say, you'll be meeting another familiar face in this one and the very first paragraph sets up the character straight away. Heh heh.
“Happy New Year, Sherlock.” John replies in a low whisper. Then he smiles and reaches out, offering a hand. Sherlock hesitates and then takes it in his, surprised by how well they fit together and yet, not surprised at all.
“A balaclava.”
“Sherlock,” he finally says when his mind gets itself together, and it still is not firing on all cylinders, “there’s something you have to know about me.”
“What? Yes. Yes, of course.”
“How do you keep yourself fit?” John asks in a light tone, brows near his hairline. “Midnight jogs in the park?”
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” John blinks slowly and curses himself internally for losing his nerve. He’s Captain John fucking Watson. What the fuck.
“John?” he steps forward.
Sherlock shoots him an indignant glare.
“Thank you,” Greg replies, some tension seeping from his body. “Mrs. Hudson?”
“Haven’t I mentioned it before? I’m quite sure I have. You guard your secrets with great care, John,” Sherlock nods his head; half annoyed, half in awe.
Much love to all of you and thank for your support.
“And glory,” Smacks adds.
WAAAAAATTTTT????? Like Phillip said in Hamilton: It's like that?
They are silent for a few minutes. It is awkward and yet, not. Sherlock feels very comfortable and calm, even as his nerves remain edgy. His grey eyes suddenly dart to where his own hand rests on John’s hip, a reminder to stay still while he works. He can feel the warmth of the skin under his hand. A light sweat breaks out on Sherlock’s forehead and his heart rate picks up. It sounds so loud in his ears and John must be able to hear it. They are too close for him not to.
DA DA DAAAAAA!
“Sit,” he gestures at the bed and disappears into the en suite. He opens a cupboard and removes a plastic case. He also grabs two hand towels to sop up blood, knowing he will likely need more than the kit has to offer.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looks at him with nothing less than adoration and gives him a radiant smile. He believes he knows Sherlock better than most, maybe even more than Victor Trevor had, the wanker, but he wants to know more. He wants to know every detail of this man and his life. Every thought and memory, every feeling, every inch of his body. God, his body. John saw so much of him last night and it wasn’t enough. He longs to explore Sherlock’s body again, worship it with his hands and his mouth.
“Your boat?” John gasps, still coughing a bit, but incredulous nonetheless. “What the fuck, Greg?”
If he is right, will John take Rosie with him?
Sherlock leans closer. The two gaze at one another with the kind of trust and bond typically earned only after years of friendship.
She nods and squeezes her eyes shut tightly. Sherlock fills the pitcher with water from the tub and pauses, holding it over her head.
I’m gonna be your bubblegum bitch
That’s the bad news. The good news is I don’t have cancer! YAY, FUCKING, YAY!!! The jury was out for the last 14 days or so and I got the results a couple days ago. I can’t tell you how relieved I am. It’s absolutely amazing in a year where there hasn’t been a lot of good news. So it's happy dance time! You know I've been doing it the last two days. Thunderstorms are scheduled for tomorrow and you can bet your ass I'll be out dancing in it with "Singin' in the Rain" on my lips. That's Cakey Jane for ya.

“Thank you, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,” he offers his hand and, in spite of his annoyance, Sherlock takes it for a shake. “I appreciate your cooperation.”
John’s body jerked back a touch at that, his eyes wide with surprise.
John huffs and rolls his eyes before he can stop himself. He has largely kept his jealousy to himself. At least, he hopes Sherlock has not picked up on it. He has given no indication, but the git probably noticed the moment the woman began talking.
“Well, I can’t hide forever, too. I need to get back to Scotland Yard.” Greg said.
John had made a few steps backwards. His face was paler than usual.
“This looks fantastic. I am really very hungry now.” He sat down and so did Sherlock. He carefully watched John through his lashes but he really seemed to like it.
“Very well. We should have dinner now.” John suggested.
“What was that right now?” John asked.
Sherlock endured the pulsing plug for hours and listened to the noises coming up from downstairs. He actually pissed on the hardwood and knew he would be punished later. He hadn't been able to control both, the need to pee and the urge to orgasm. He decided it was better to not come.
“They surely will. But John can be a big help for Lestrade. He understands me. He likes Greg. He wants him happy. And in daily life situations, mingling things, we are both the same. Only you can hide it better.” Mycroft sighed and chewed on some tomatoes.
Greg's eyes were huge and he finally sat down rubbing over his tired eyes. His eyes rested on the DVD.
Mycroft really was touched by this and he let everybody see when he wiped away some tears. Greg got up and sat beside him on the armrest.
“Very good. Text me the details.” John again laughed.
He checked the time and nodded to himself. He entered the kitchen and found an apron. He started to cook and even now it held no bad memories. Now he was cooking for himself and his guest. For Ian.
“Why?” Mycroft asked. Sherlock explained while Mycroft listened and poured more coffee.
”Oh, you have no idea how much, brother-dear! Listen to me, there has been a real murder and I need Lestrade to come over. The local police won’t be able to handle this. Me.”
“Miss you more...” Mycroft replied and let go. He saw Greg out and closed the door. He still smiled when he sat down behind his desk and powered up his computer.
John brought the plates and sat down with him. He picked up his fork and ate a few bites. He waited for Greg to start eating, too. Only then he started to speak.
“Hush... There is nothing to be sorry for.” And he kissed him on the forehead. Sherlock tensed but John didn't let go.
“Diogenes Club.” Sherlock said knowing what John was thinking about.
“You want me to wank until I come?”
Mycroft moved his arms and the metal clinked. Instantly, Greg got the key and opened the cuffs around his wrists. He gently checked him for injuries but his skin was just a bit red.
And he really gave his best. He licked and sucked and hollowed his cheeks. He took him deep and his dom let him do everything for a few minutes. But then he started to fuck him roughly. He face-fucked him and the head of his thick cock reached down his throat.
Mycroft had some spoons and then closed his eyes humming. John looked at him.
“Why don’t you pick them for me wherever you want and I sit in a café and wait for you?”
“Very good, John.” Sherlock was angry but the emotion quickly vanished again and turned into disappointment.
Sherlock rummaged through the bag and chose some chocolate bars. He ate three of them.
“You think he wants to have sex with me before dinner?”
“Let’s sleep then.” Sherlock found a comfortable position and they slotted together just as Sherlock had imagined it. He sighed and smiled with his eyes closed.
“Are you suggesting I tell John here what I want? I don’t know!” Sherlock became impatient.
“We are on our way. I'll get my med-kit. Stay calm and don't leave his side. Try to make him drink lots of water.”
“He is worried about you, Sherlock. He is your friend and will always look after you.”
“Tell me your colour now, John.” Sherlock said while John swayed on the spot when the second clamp was attached.
He loaded his cart with the things he needed for their dinner tonight. While doing that, he kept talking.
“No, this is freaky. I somehow suspected it but this is the much-needed proof.” John looked clueless and Sherlock grinned but only inwardly.
“Oh God, this is, this is …” John groaned and fisted into his hair. Sherlock almost choked when John’s cock touched his throat. He swallowed around his head when he forced it deeper. It didn’t take long and John shot his cum down his throat. He pulled out and Sherlock’s head just fell down on the sheets again. He was panting and coughing weakly.
“How is he? Did everything go well?” He asked.
Half an hour later he stood fully dressed again in the kitchen and had the dough on a baking plate. Now he poured the tomato sauce over it and started to add the vegetables and ham. He also added loads of cheese. He shoved it into the oven but only wanted to heat it up after Greg and Mycroft had arrived. They were due in an hour or so.
“You like him that much; you’ve got his number?” Sherlock raised his brow.
“Do you need any incentive, bitch?” Sherlock wasn't gagged, so he expected an answer.
“Do you mind if I am reading for a minute until I can sleep?” Sherlock quietly asked and hopefully looked up at him.
“Yes, John. Of course. By the end of this week.” His smile was a bit strained but John simply smiled and ate some more.
“So are you.” They looked at each other and John dared to take his hand.
“Good luck, John!”
“I left him behind to find something to eat.” Mycroft smiled.
“Sherlock? Greg is wondering why you are hiding from him!” He called out and at the same moment, Sherlock dashed out of his bedroom texting furiously on his phone.
“I know, I know.” Greg laughed.
Sherlock’s stomach rumbled and he greedily eyed the Tesco bag.
“And I am glad, we agree on this matter.” Sherlock still knelt on the ground with his hands folded on his nape. He still somewhat expectantly looked at John.
They smoked in silence for a while. Suddenly Ian's mobile rang and he raised a brow. He looked at the display.
“I look forward to it. What’s your profession anyway?” John told him the very short version but promised to tell him more when they would meet at the pub. Greg smiled and said:
“Beg for it.” John licked his lips and saw it twitch beneath Sherlock’s dress trousers.
Because if he spoke to his brother now, he would get very, very angry and upset. That's why he stood and made a few steps back. Sherlock cast his eyes and tensed. It seemed as if he sensed how angry he was. And it scared him.
“Come over here and bend over the armrest for me. I want to check if you are properly cleaned out.” John did exactly that not being able to think right now. He presented his arse as if on display. His mind was still a bit dreamy.
„You are the dom and know much better how to torment someone. I gladly follow your lead.“ Sherlock shrugged.
“Do you want more?” Again, with the shouting and nodding.
He put everything on the table and ate. It was good and he really enjoyed it. Afterwards, he cleaned up and put everything into the dishwasher. He took his computer and sat down in his armchair. He read what he had last written in his blog and found it rather boring. He kept editing it for a while and waited for Sherlock to come home.
“Yes, I am. Thanks, Ian. For everything.” John shyly smiled.
“Why was he jealous?” Sherlock asked.
“Not yet. You woke me.” Sherlock smiled, too.
“I have the kind of evenings it attended regularly. It will attend them with me, both here and at other places.”
“Would you like to try this?” He asked reaching out for him and Sherlock just nodded.
And he decided just to tell him. Perhaps it would help him, too.
“I believe you want to take these with you?” He asked and Sherlock nodded.
Then the door banged open and Sherlock tried to see who had come to torment him. But he already was too weak to turn over.
“Mrs Hudson would be very happy to have you back. She will cook for you, bring you tea in the morning and cookies for tea.” Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock came back out with two leather garment bags and now John stopped him.
“It's still a bit early, isn't it?” Sherlock checked the time but Greg shrugged.
“Yes, it's adorable.” John lazily smiled but suddenly turned around so he could face his lover, his vampire, his mate who now groped at his arse. John slowly moved against him. They kissed languidly but soon it became all wild, dirty, and wet.
“Why would I? I do like him.” Mycroft didn’t look at Sherlock.
Out of desperate eyes, he looked at his dom who simply smiled down at him.
“You might also refill my tumbler.” Greg said and made Mycroft get up again.
“Surely not!” Greg just left and at once Sherlock started to shove his cock against John’s body.
“No, I was looking at your beautiful pet over there and thinking about a scene for later.” John raised a brow.
“I thought about it in the past. I have once used it in the Diogenes but only with my brother. Now I am wondering if you’d like it.” Sherlock said.
„Is this you being jealous?“ John asked and Sherlock's eyes slanted. John sighed.
“You are not trying to threaten me right now, are you? Like if I hurt Sherlock, there is another place for me on that mantle as well?” John sipped his coffee. Mycroft laughed and shook his head.
“It still feels alien…” He murmured and moved his palms over John’s back.
“Now I am going to cook something light because I was able to hear you.”
“Yes, what do you want?” There was a film playing in Sherlock’s mind palace but instead he said:
He grinned and nodded to himself.
“Would you like dessert, too?” Greg grinned.
„He won't look at me...“ Sherlock at once complained to give John a reason to do something. He clawed into his hair and pulled him back against his thigh.
“No, we have got only one jumper. You wanted two, we will get two. I am good again.”
“But the kitchen is occupied with people! I can’t sit there and discuss things with you with all of them around.” He sounded shocked now.
But anyway, Ian seemed to be pleased.
“Oh, you have no idea!” He moved his wrists into his left and could easily cover his thin wrists. His free hand moved over his chest and slowly to the hem of his sweater. He reached beneath it and pinched a nipple.
“Did they test your IQ or send you to boarding school or…” Sherlock trails off. He feels like a nosy idiot. John must think him a fool, especially since he already said his parents didn’t enroll him in nursery school - is that preschool, he wonders - based on geography. They couldn’t have had the funds for such things if they needed a school nearby. As if reading his mind, John shakes his head slightly, taking a drink of water.
Much love, Jane
(See the end of the chapter for
WTF is wrong with you, Mycroft? Just keep pushing him away, why don't ya.
QUESTION TIME!
He smiles at John lovingly. John’s eyes fill with every word until one tear finally tumbles down his cheek.
Both men open their eyes half way to look at one another, searching, seeking permission. John slides his hand along Sherlock’s jawline, brushing a thumb across his lips. Sherlock nips at it, then tilts his head and swoops in. John’s mind goes blank but for the taste of Sherlock. His scent, the warmth of his lips.
John to be with Sherlock, to work himself back to as normal as he can be, also to finally get Moriarty.
Similarly, there are no further attempts on John’s life, or Molly’s. Mycroft continues to keep an eye on her through PT and in her room. Sherlock has even walked in on the two of them in the throws of a ruthless chess game. Mycroft has also proved useful in obscuring John’s whereabouts. After picking up enough clothing to last a couple of weeks, along with a few other items, John drove to a hotel and made it look as though he had checked in while actually leaving for Sherlock’s condo. John repeated this every two or three days so he appeared to be moving around.
“Are you?” John narrows cold eyes at Mycroft and leaves the room, letting the door slam to punctuate his exit.
And there you have it! I'm such a tease with the song lyrics, I know. No actual kiss this time around, but we all know that won't last.
“In case what?” John’s hands are on his hips. Well, one is more on his waist. Sherlock says nothing. “In case he comes back?”
Doing as he’s told, he focuses all of his attention on John’s face. He begins taking in every detail to distract himself from the pain and all-consuming fear. He takes his time on John’s lips. Not full like his own, but certainly not thin. Average, he supposes, and incredibly soft. Softer than he ever would have expected. And warm, playful. Suddenly overcome with the urge to kiss them, Sherlock tenses his body to sit up, but is met with astonishing pain and John’s hands trying gently to keep him down.
Love to you all, Jane
“This is ridiculous,” Sherlock pushes out of the chair and glides to the door. “I have a practice on.”
Once again, What the fuck, Jane? You lead us down this path and then SCREECH! You put on the breaks! You are evil. EEEEEEVILLLLLLL. Hey, there's a song about that. Eeeeevil Womahn. Hahahaha!
“What? Now?”
As my very own PatPrecieux pointed out, how the hell does Moriarty always seem to know where John is?
happen again.”
It’s forever, this time I know and there’s no doubt in my mind
“Your boyfriend,” Sherlock rasped, nodding his head toward the bar. His mouth was still so close to John that the sigh he let out drifted over John’s lips and the doctor was loath to look away. What he saw drained that wonderful, tingling, incredible adrenaline rush from his body.
“What?” John replies breathlessly.
YES!! HE'S DEAD! Ding dong, the WITCH IS DEAD!
“What the fuck, Mycroft?”
“You sleep in silk pajamas?” John asks raising a brow.
“There is something I would like to discuss with you while my brother is indisposed.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
“Tell Smacks we’re thinking of her,” Trixie gives him a nudge and meets his eyes.
John is alone in his room. He has been a prisoner for seven days. It is hell. The time on his own is frustrating, but preferable to the alternative. John has tried every way he can think of to escape and all to no avail. The wires holding him to the bed cannot be broken and are so tight that he cannot inch his way out of them either. His wrists and ankles are heavily marred from his efforts. Jim will still bandage them on occasion, but only long enough for the wounds to stop bleeding. John discovered that the protection they offer made struggling easier and nearly had a hand free late last night before Jim made an unexpected visit. After a rousing fight that ended in John being securely tied again, he was forced to suffer terribly for his efforts.
“It’ll be fine,” Sherlock protests while nodding in answer to the question. “They aren’t juvenile delinquents.”
“Jesus Christ!” Mary clamors for her ribs, one hand covering his.
JANE! JANE! DOES THAT MEAN?!?!  Yes! Yes, friends, there will be a Part 8. Editing will soon commence.
See paragraph 2.
“Is nothing short of miraculous,” Sherlock ventures when John simply pauses. It sounds pompous, but it is exactly what John is thinking.
Love you all and see you again soon. (Damn, I'm getting wordy.)
“Erroneous conclusion?” John repeats incredulously. “I can reason things out just fine, thank you very much.”
“There’s nothing else.”
Tune in next time. Same bat time. Same bat channel.
“Fine,” the word sounds like a curse on his lips, “but I want to see these ‘impeccable’ credentials for myself.”
He is in love with John.
“Yes, sir,” he replies. “We have him and are ready to go.”
I don't think DP would have many questions after this, or much to say at all, besides "Oh, god. Oh, yes. That was fucking incredible. Oh my god. You all carry on with your business. I'm just going to wait a few minutes and read that again. (an aside) Where's my unicorn?"
“Without a doubt.”
“No, I didn’t. There was more opportunity in civilian life, in England. Bill had shipped out to Afghanistan,” a determined look comes over John’s face and his elbow presses into Sherlock’s fingertip as if he needs to ground himself with the touch. “I thought I could do more, help more people, make more of a difference working in London. Women, children, young and old…”
Now Sherlock can put his wedding plans into action.
Without a word or thought, Sherlock lowers his head. His eyes slip closed and he just brushes his lips against John’s. The slightest touch, light as a feather and completely surreal. Sherlock’s entire body tingles with just that one touch. It starts at their lips and spreads through his chest, down his arms and legs to fingertips and toes. It. Is. Amazing. Glorious. Perfect.
I'm working on the next chapter and hope to get it out soon. Love you all and thanks for your support.
Love, Jane
“Oh,” John groans. His head lays back on the floor and his hands fall to his sides. With the air knocked free from his lungs, he cannot answer Sherlock right away.
“No,” Billy places the glass on the coffee table between them. “It didn’t seem to matter who the ladies were playing and that made it harder to find a pattern.”
“Not good. It’s near the knee,” John glances up when Trixie sets the medical bag next to them. “Ta.”
“Longer than he expected to be. He said he was on a schedule,” John’s voice is harsh and Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise. He had not expected the attacker would have spoken to John and the fury simmering just beneath the surface of John’s words makes Sherlock wonder what else was said. He is suddenly and inexplicably compelled to lighten John’s mood.
And there it is! AAHHHHHH!! What an ending, eh? Poor tortured Sherlock. And John. What a tangled web I weave!
Sherlock invites John to spend the night in his room and then starts having nightmares.
“So,” John begins as Sherlock feels a burst of lightheadedness when he gives his arm a squeeze and then gestures to the empty water bottle on the coffee table, “any chance I could get another? Or was that wine I saw on the counter?”
“Let me guess,” Sherlock says as John opens his mouth.
“You’ve seen me dance?” John asked, a little startled. This lithe specter of the dance floor had noticed him? Sherlock just replied with a satisfied and very amused expression.
The doctor says nothing. He just looks at Sherlock, unblinking.
“Ha-ha! Way to go, Molly,” John laughs. “So you coached for a bit somewhere else and then Mrs. Hudson hired you?”
Greg obliges as the boat begins to move. Medics radio from the marina and are told two need medical attention as soon as they arrive. Jenkins also radios the information about Sarah and The Crown in hopes they can intercept her at one of the other landing points.
Much love and torture, Jane
4) How does John feel about it? Is he going to encourage him to discover his own love for Sherlock or scare him off?
Got a figure like a pin-up, got a figure like a doll
“Good god. Calista, really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Now I'm feeling the more Deadpool side of my personality coming out. I'm starting to feel like I should have a name for all of you like Lady Gaga does with her little monsters or whatever she calls her fans. Any suggestions? Perhaps true DP style - Dirty Little Unicorns? Lol. Or maybe something simple like Peaches. That's a real gangster name, that is. Forget Bugsy and Baby Face, my Peaches are the biggest badasses. Bahahaha! This is too much fun.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s eyes go out of focus, gazing passed him in distraction, in thought. A glint of realization in them. “And what better way to hurt me?”
3. Who was the guy in the hotel lobby?
Sherlock looks at the doctor wickedly and lets out a dark chuckle.
“We can help if you stumble,” Greg says quietly, “but I don’t think you will.”
“Sorry,” he mutters.
“I might’ve known he was under your employ. You can’t leave well enough alone, can you?”
Happy reading.
Sherlock bites his lip. It is too much. He lifts himself, putting more space between them and adopting an air of nonchalance that grips his heart and squeezes.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Moriarty groans in frustration as the blonde, soaking wet head of John Watson appears.
Hi, Everyone, I'm back!!
2. Who the hell did he call on his cell? Seems Sherlock may have been right about a hired killer. (Shit, that was an answer. I just can't help myself.)
* When is one or the other finally going to avoid being kidnapped? I mean, seriously.
Happy reading, y'all.
There is a light rap on the office door and in walks the woman of the hour, Mrs. Martha Hudson. With a smile on her face, she lets the door swing wide before turning to close it with a solid click. When she faces them again, it is with a motherly smile.
LOL. Oh, god, I AM in a mood. Must be the cold medicine. Sorry for the obnoxious, soap opera behavior, my friends.
Sherlock’s lips turn up and he huffs out a breathy laugh.
“What if I have? He is my brother, after all.”
Sherlock pushes himself up quickly and gives John his patented “What the fuck” look.
“That’s pure Sherlock,” Billy grins openly now. “He’s very clever.”
“Sorry, sorry,” John blurted, opening his eyes to see that Sherlock had perched himself on the bar stool next to him. He seemed to have finished sizing John up and also appeared to have no intention of leaving. “I was… It’s nice to meet you.”
“Be back in a few,” was what he said instead.
He glances down to his lap again and then meets Sherlock’s steady gaze.
“So, what was your latest case?” John asked eagerly, ignoring the chill creeping under his skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Has he?” Sherlock asks with a lopsided smile. John gives him that cheeky grin and they descend into laughter. Sherlock leans back on the couch, rests his hand on his belly and looks at John. The doctor wears an almost wistful expression. A slow smile creeps onto Sherlock’s face, but doesn’t quite reach his eyes before his lips turn down into a frown. “Mike called you at midnight?”
So what happens now?
“Because you look a little…”
“I think you can,” John replies, meeting the man’s eyes again. Billy tilts his head curiously. When John speaks, his voice is low and deadly serious. “Molly mentioned poison. She said
“To date?” Sherlock ventures.
“So they still don’t know?” John asks, incredulous. “Didn’t you think one of them might be next?”
Or your place or my place
“Oh, Sherlock, I know he hurt you. I’ll never forgive him for that, but you shouldn’t give up that part of yourself,” Molly touched his arm, putting her own Chubby Hubby pint in her lap. “You shouldn’t deny yourself the chance to be happy.”
And now.....drum roll.....wait for it.....you know what's coming.....I am suddenly feeling very silly........and it feels so good.......
What does the last chapter hold???
Sherlock shrugs as he places a bandage and begins taping. John looks right at him, sparing none of his attention for anything but the man before him.
“I didn’t ask you to stay!” Sherlock snaps vehemently.
John laughed again at that and rested his hands on his hips. He looked at Sherlock with fond eyes, dancing inside that he had not bollocksed up the whole thing, and trying not to let his imagination run wild at where this might go.
Lead jammer - the jammer who breaks through the pack first (no points are scored on the initial break through. The lead jammer controls the jam and can call it off at any time, unless in the penalty box.
John makes a suggestion and it doesn't go exactly as planned, but the intrepid duo still get up to a little sumpin', sumpin'.
They started the song a respectable, casual distance apart, as any two new acquaintances would. Clearly still dancing together and that space was maintained throughout the duration. Honestly, John could not care less because dancing like this, to have fun and be free was exactly what he needed. It felt so liberating to just move without feeling the urge to prove something to himself or to Jim, and dancing Sherlock just felt right. Really, really right. Even though they had only just met, John had already begun to feel as though their actual introduction had taken place a long time ago.
“What?” John asks, bewildered. “Has Harry flooded her room?”
“What’s stopping you?” Sherlock thrusts his face close to Moriarty’s and scowls, staring him down. Moriarty grins back and twists their legs together. Bending both of his own, he forces one of Sherlock’s knees to hyperextend. The detective grunts in pain and Moriarty seizes the opportunity to shove him off. He lunges to attack, but Sherlock recovers quickly and holds him at bay. The two men wrestle around violently, each landing solid shots to the other’s face until Moriarty pushes away just enough to slash Sherlock’s wrist. He lets out a pained shout.
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Happy reading, y'all and thank you for your continued love and support. Hope you love this Part too!
By the time the doctor is finished, Sherlock’s eyes are closed and his fingers steepled before his chin. He visualizes it all in his mind, trying to keep his emotions at a distance. He has not been to John’s apartment, but knows the building and general layout for a unit. He watches the man grab John from behind in the kitchen and the ensuing struggle. Sentiment momentarily gets the better of him and he physically flinches when the second bullet grazes John’s hip. He breathes deeply and follows John out the window and down the fire escape.
Love, Jane
“I can do that.”
you do last night?” Greg jokes. Sherlock’s eyes go wide and he does not answer. Greg’s voice comes over the line again, his tone suspicious. “Sherlock…”
“I go out on it all the time,” he says in a good-natured, if not breathless, tone. “Great way to spend the weekend. Sorry I haven’t invited you yet. I’ll give you the grand tour.”
1b. Will John talk himself out of it?
Hello, everyone.
Greg is already shaking his head, looking John’s way.
A wide grin spread across John’s face as Sherlock began to chuckle. He shook his head a little and laughed with the snarky detective. Without a thought, he reached up and cupped the back of Sherlock’s neck, tugging his face down until it was close to his own. John looked into his eyes, wide with surprise, and moved in closer. Their cheeks brushed as John pressed his lips to the taller man’s ear and the sensation weakened his knees.
“On my way to the hospital,” his response is quiet, but books no argument.
Sherlock delivers two quick but light pinches to John’s sides, just under his ribs. The doctor yelps and twists fiercely.
“How do you do it?” John asked in a tone that bubbled with enthusiasm. “Are you a psychologist or a profiler or some mad genius who uses his power for the greater good? You know, all tall, dark, handsome and broody, but really on the side of the angels?”
“No?”
Just to talk
“There’s no one here,” John faces him, finally finished scanning his surroundings like a startled animal.
Sherlock’s lips curl into a knowing smirk, but he does not have the chance to speak because Angelo is suddenly at their table.  He asks about dinner and if they would like dessert or more wine. Both give him their compliments and turn down both offers. John goes on a bit about the alfredo and Sherlock can’t blame him. It is amazing.
6. Just what will John say? We know he is attracted to Sherlock, but has his own misgivings. Hmmm....
And now you're all wondering if he's truly okay. Will he be able to pick up the pieces? Will Sherlock be able to help him?
“Whatever remains,” Sherlock joins him in an equally quiet tone. John gasps and Sherlock continues alone. “However improbable…”
Isn't Greg the best?
“Ta,” John watched as Greg stepped away to grab a short glass and a bottle of Talisker.
Holy hell in a handbasket, Jane, just what are you up to? John escaped that one by sheer, dumb luck. He may be a soldier, but he can sure think on his feet. And the suspense of the whole thing. Arg! When I was editing I kept thinking of the jabberwocky and something wicked this way comes. The guy was so close to the desk. Soooo clossssse. *shivers and then straightens to full height* Don't be hurting my doctah.
Much love, Jane
Love, Jane
See you again next weekend, my friends!
The detective gasps almost silently and softly presses his lips to John’s. Their eyes close and they both lose themselves in the touch. John nips ever so slightly, teasing Sherlock’s lips open. A breath passes between them, a promise. It feels like hours pass before John suddenly pulls away to fix Sherlock with panicked, guilty eyes.
“I am never late, Gregory. In addition, I was looking forward to our weekend. I am rather, well, excited.”
„It's late in the afternoon already. Let's finish this and I will comfort you, OK?“ Sherlock pecked a kiss on John's cheek.
“That was the most amazing blow-job ever!” Sherlock proudly smiled.
He groaned behind the ball-gag and kept drooling heavily. He was also hungry. And he needed to piss.
Sherlock stood and went into the bath to shower. He was dressed as impeccably as ever when he left his room and had a last cup of coffee. He was reading his emails already if there was anything up that demanded his help.
“I love Myc very much. When he finally came out, I was very surprised because I hadn't seen. I mean, I always liked him in a strange sort of way but I never would have thought. Anyway, I soon understood that he was rather naïve and innocent regarding the sex and I loved him even more.” Now he poured himself some tea, too.
“Yes, Greg.” Greg was pleased for now and gestured him over to sit on the bed. Normally he would have made him sit on the ground so he could reach him from a sitting position but he didn't want him to sit on the ground. That's why he climbed up on the bed and knelt behind him. His fingers moved through his hair. He already had a thick rubber-band in his pocket. He braided the masses of dark curls but not too tight. He slung the rubber-band over the hair at the bottom. He had a look at him and was rather pleased with his work.
Trying to clear his mind and focus on what is real, John leans against a wall and watches Sherlock as he stands by the window, playing his violin and looking down on Baker Street. The clock on the mantle strikes midnight. John blinks slowly, peacefully, having finally found something to quiet his thoughts. He starts when Sherlock stops suddenly and places the violin on his desk. He strides toward John, a smile quirking on his lips as he approaches. John steps forward in question, but backs again as his flatmate nears. Sherlock crowds in, invading his personal space, his back against the wall, and fixes intense eyes upon him. Completely captivated, John watches as Sherlock’s full lips part. His voice comes in a low rumble that starts a faint tickle at the base of John’s spine.
Also, on a purely ridiculous note, I just noticed when I was looking the title that the abbreviation is KFC with an extra letter. Lol. Now I feel the need to come up with other words to replace the real ones, like Keep Your Fried Chicken or KY for Comfort. Bwahaha! That’s a good one, if I do say so myself. Sorry. Sometimes I really am still 15 years old. Like when I chuckle every time I hear the movie title “Pacific Rim”. Heehee. I really am very mature, but I do have that Deadpool side too.)
“Mrs. Hudson exaggerates.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, it’s just…” John shifts somewhat nervously. “You should be able to relax in your own bedroom and sleep, but you couldn’t. You left. And as much as you deny it, you do need to sleep, Sherlock.”
Don’t care if you think I’m dumb, I don’t care at all
John makes a suggestion at the surgery and...the aftermath.
John first noticed Sherlock at Greg’s club a year ago. John was there with Jim and a slow song had just started as Jim began to pick a fight with a rather large and nasty-looking man. John pulled him onto the dance floor and tucked his chin to his own shoulder to calm him down. A few bars into the song and John’s eyes had found Sherlock. He was wrapped around another tall man, both equal in height, all the parts of their bodies lined up perfectly for the dirtiest dancing John had witnessed in a long time. He had tried not to watch them, but could not stop himself. Sherlock, still nameless to him at that time, was simply captivating.
He pauses and lets his gaze fall to the candle, staring almost unseeing.
“I’ve gotten to know all of the ladies a bit in the last month, had lunches with Greg and Mike and other staffers, but I know virtually nothing about you.”
“Yes, Martha told me about that. All sounds like a damn nuisance,” John remarks.
“I could just do it myself.”
“A catapult perched on a rooftop.” Sherlock begins, wanting to steer the topic away from John.
5. WHAT ARE THESE TWO IDIOTS GOING TO DO NEXT?!?!
“Her ankle may be broken too,” he replies after gently squeezing one last time. “I need an x-ray. Could be sprained, but I’d say broken.”
“Your mate?”
“Uh…” John is astounded by his bluntness. His mouth is suddenly dry and he clears his throat again. “Um, yeah, if you’d be interested. Are...are you interested?”
John’s body grew tense in an instant. His mouth pressed into a thin and serious line.
“Like you want to give me a right flipping seeing-to,” John comments, suddenly sporting a playful grin. An outright wicked smile spreads across Sherlock’s face. John is momentarily surprised and pleased, but his expression quickly reverts to concern. “You need to take care of yourself no matter how intense things get with Moriarty.”
“Did you share one with Victor?”
“Apparently, even The Machine gets the flu,” Greg said by way of explanation. He continued with a shrug. “Who knew? To be honest, I hope it doesn’t spread around. She sounded terrible.”
Hope you all keep lovin' this and stick around for the end of Part 2.
“Twenty laps for being a smartass,” he announces.
They stare at it for a moment that seems to go on forever. Then they both spring into motion again as they scrabble for it, each trying to knock the other’s hands away while grabbing for the gun themselves. They roll onto their sides, facing the steering column and still grappling for the flare gun. Sherlock stretches his arms their full length and then stretches them again. The tip of his middle finger can just touch the trigger guard. He gives it one more shot and only succeeds in pushing the gun another millimeter out of his reach. He huffs in frustration and wraps his arms around Moriarty instead. The shorter man has positioned himself between Sherlock and the flare gun, their bodies flush with one another as if spooning. If their roles were reversed and Sherlock was the smaller spoon, the gun would be his.
“I could explain further, but do you really need me to?” Sherlock asked, his eyes flicking to John’s lips again.
“I’ll send one of the officers around tomorrow so you can both sign your statements,” Budreau replies, a slight smile his only response to Sherlock’s comment. “You’ll be at the stadium then?”
John howled.
“You would have avoided speaking entirely if it were possible,” Sherlock huffed, aggravation pulsing off of him in waves.
stadium?”
Without further ado...
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Moriarty says from the floor of the boat. He scowls, making no secret of his disgust. “It’s not fair. There’s two of you.”
And now, a tender moment for us as a group. As always, I hope this has brought you all some distraction and solace. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading with me, loving these two idiots with me, and sharing all these feelings with me in these uncertain times. I love you all.
“Come down again, John. I am with you. What do you want to do now?”
“Bite into the sheets, slut!” Sherlock did exactly that and screamed when the pegs came off. He cried again and his body shook. It turned John on. A lot. He was completely hard again after just having come.
After some minutes of brutal beating, John parted his cheeks and pushed two fingers into him. Sherlock panted and tried to relax but didn't manage. He remembered pleasure but this was only pain given to him.
“Are you scared, Greg?”
“Get someone like a historian over here as quickly as possible. Tell them he or she is needed because of national security. We need to know everything about this place. Secret rooms, caves beneath it or tunnels leading to and from it. The water is close. There will probably be old ways having been used to smuggle goods and people. Move!” The officer saluted again and got on the mobile.
Saliva ran over his chin and dropped down. John zoomed in on his face and Sherlock knew he had to look into the camera. John actually gave him the thumbs-up and it helped Sherlock to calm down when the man hoisted him up some more. Now he stared directly at his groin.
“Yes, I did see that. But what was written on it? Please?” Sherlock smiled his best smug smile.
“No, you don’t have to worry. I am coming by to let you know that I am looking forward to our weekend.” He stood a bit stiffly by the door and didn’t know what to do.
„He does. He only stopped because he got very disappointed.“ John nibbled on another cookie.
“He will kill you. I don't want that.” Sherlock struggled to get out of his grip but John wouldn't let go.
“He spoilt every single date I had during the last months. I also believe he hurt himself on purpose to make me come back and care for him.”
“This is wonderful. I haven’t had such a wonderful dinner for ages. Thank you so much!” He said looking at Mycroft again.
“Disappearance? He has been abducted by a sex-trafficking ring.” Greg paled beneath his natural tan.
John enjoyed every fucking second.
“Yes, I did. But that is entirely different from sharing a room with you!”
“Freshen up. The plug stays. Get dressed and start dinner.” He pushed him into the back and it made him stumble forward.
“Thank you, John. You are a wonderful partner.” John tilted his head frowning but his smile was still there.
“I am not angry with you. You know that, don’t you?” John whispered.
“I want pasta, too. And wine.” Sebastian raised his brow.
Mycroft pushed back the bowl and looked at John.
“I believe you have finished? The horrible noises have stopped at last.” He pulled a face and for once Sherlock did not look affected.
“I actually do, you know? I only never did because it's very expensive around here. And it wouldn't be the same.”
“Very good. I will prepare you now. Get up.” Sherlock stood again and let his limbs hang loose. He was given a harness which ran over his chest, shoulders and ended being hooked to his collar. Another part went between his legs and over his hips. His cock also got a harness and his balls were divided in the middle by a leather strap attached to it.
“Well, you are sometimes but not in situations like that. Plus, I don’t want you to go there alone. Without me. You are mine now.” John hadn’t thought about his words but when there was no reply coming from Sherlock, he looked back up.
He swallowed and finally gulped down the water he had poured only minutes ago. Completely absent-minded he walked upstairs and undressed. He used his t-shirt to clean himself and threw his sticky clothes on the floor. Then he climbed under the blankets and turned on his side closing his eyes. He deeply breathed. He could still taste Sherlock on his tongue and in his mouth. Blood, whiskey, and cigarettes.
“You two need to talk before something happens right now. Go outside. He is smoking. Go!” John left the room and left the building. He looked both to his left and right and found Sherlock sitting on a rock smoking. He looked up when he approached.
“I hurt you. I didn’t know how to make it better.” It suddenly was just a tiny voice, very different from everything he had heard from him before. It was almost a bit unreal.
“I am sorry, Gregory. I only meant well. I always only meant well. I don’t know what else to tell you.” Mycroft did exactly what he didn’t want. He stuttered and was at a loss for words. He actually followed John’s advice.
“You should see your face,” he struggles to say, his body tilting slightly from side to side with laughter. Realization quickly dawns on John’s face and he shoves at Sherlock’s arm, mumbling something that sounds like prat. He wears a smile of genuine amusement only a moment later and laughs with the coach.

“Sherlock!” his voice is urgent and full of worry. “Are you all right?”
QUESTION TIME!!
His eyes narrow as he considers his jammers to determine which ones fit with each strategy. He shuffles through individual tactics and assigns the ones that play directly to each woman’s strengths and personality. All of this is easy for him because he is a master at reading people and knowing what he shouldn’t know with only a look or two. He reads every strength and weakness after observing two trips around the track. He can see everything about one’s personal life as well, but turns that part of his brain off with the team so as to avoid invading their privacy. Mutual respect is also important in a successful team.
“What the hell is she doing, Greg?” Sherlock is already asking. “Did she learn nothing from the disaster that was Phillip Anderson?”
Sherlock gets a phone call.
put that look on John’s face.
Sherlock bursts out laughing, much to his own surprise. Not missing that fact, John starts in too and they both descend into quiet giggles when the receptionist gives them a stern look.
A corner of the detective's mouth curves up and he fixes the man with a doubtful, yet taunting expression.
* Will things go as planned when Giles shows up?
Sherlock is in trouble.
can fuck with her turf. The Woman twirls her head toward the track dramatically in invitation to the others to join her. They each nod, steel in their eyes and tenacity on their faces as all five women skate onto the track and get into position while Sherlock remains on the sideline. He cannot resist a quick look to John, who is across the track standing in the aisle with spectators all around. He looks inconspicuous enough, but can hear most of what the other team is saying. It is perfectly legal as far as the official rules go, but the two men have to watch carefully that they do not do anything that looks even remotely like signaling. Any cheating results in disqualification and Rock City is still undefeated at this point, which is difficult, but not unheard of.
Sherlock and Greg work tirelessly to find him.
“There,” Greg says from behind him and John can tell he nodded to their right. “To my boat.”
“Molly knows.”
“Of course, dear,” Mrs. Hudson winks, “and I’ll make your favorite cakes.”
A few weeks after his hospital release, Sherlock has finally recovered to John’s satisfaction and has stopped “hounding” Sherlock to be sensible. The investigation into Moriarty’s activities is in full swing and taking much of the detective’s time. John struggles from day to day to get the skinny bastard to eat and sleep. To combat the lack of interest in taking care of himself, John implemented taking a short break every two days under penalty of no snuggling on the sofa. Sherlock strongly protested these conditions, but gave in eventually.
“I don’t know exactly how Molly figures into this, but…”
“What?” Sherlock’s hand stills. He turns his gaze to John, his brows raised in question.
Sooo... Only one chapter left. Will there be another part? Will all of us need to keep persisting? If you'll notice with me for just a moment. Just about every character in this story has to do that on some level.
* Oh, and where's my unicorn?
“More like who they are,” Sherlock replied. “What they do and where they live. What their motivations are. That sort of thing.”
Hi ho, everyone!! I hope you're all enjoying the story and that life, such as it is at this point, is good. Once again, it is my greatest wish that this chapter bring you solace and the chance to forget you troubles, if only for a few moments. I send it to you with all my love.
“All day,” Sherlock tells him, rolling his eyes in his mind and stifling the desire to mutter ‘tedious’.
You bet your ass you did, and with little to no injuries too. Haha. See my Persistence series if you want to know why that should tickle your funny bone. Anyway, I kept you waiting for these last two chapters and just didn’t have the heart to keep stringing you along. That said, I know what else you’re thinking.
“Hi,” John forced his voice to croak out. “John.”
“He’s quite the character, isn’t he?” John laughs, waving a hand toward the candle.
“So the bout you saw,” John shifts in his seat to move closer to the table, closer to Sherlock. He can see the excitement in the man’s eyes. Another flip. “How old were you then?”
John opens his mouth to speak, but the server is back with bread and olive oil. The young man makes lame conversation as he prepares the oil, mixing in fresh black pepper and parmesan. By the time he has finished and taken their orders, Sherlock is ready to tell him to piss off. John must sense the tension because he remains silent, merely studying Sherlock while he sips his wine as if he is giving Sherlock a chance to cool down.
Gah! So many questions and more!!
“No,” Sherlock replies, sobering, “but he appeared in the playground after school the next day and extorted us.”
Gah! She's back!! And she wants to be John's friend. She's moving to London and did anyone catch the part where she was going to put the moves on him as they sat on the sofa together?? Villainess!
“A full three years ahead of schedule,” she grins like any proud mother would. “Seems he has the same head for medicine that you have for observation.”

Before he realizes what he is doing, Sherlock is patting John’s knee lightly. It is warm and welcoming, the denim of his jeans softer than it has any right to be. Sherlock pulls his hand away, even though every instinct in his mind screams to stop and just rest his hand on that knee.
“I’ll be fine.”
“God, Sherlock, really?” Greg rolls his eyes. The coach always was a drama queen, even from the beginning. He doesn’t usually get this carried away though and he clearly has John’s buy in.
“I was tending to something very important.”
Sherlock nods as John walks to the kitchen giggling. And right then, he decides he must spend the rest of his life making John Watson giggle exactly that way.
James
“Right. The left,” HardOn furrows her brow as she pictures what her coach has described. “That’ll work.”
“Why haven’t you bought a house? You’ve been here a long time,” John asks, referring to their previous conversation, clearly trying to distract himself.
Am I right? Am I right? (diabolical laughing) You all keep telling me the peace is beautiful, but cannot last. Well...unfortunately, you're right. I really feel like I shouldn't be so tickled by the prospect of my beloved readers tearing their hair out or hiding their eyes behind their hands, hoping John says "Oh, no, wait. Don't go, Sherlock. I'm being ridiculous. You're right. There's something very suspicious about Mary. Let's snuggle a bit and figure out what it is." Sorry, friends., but you'll just have to wait and see what happens. No hints.
Just what the fuck is Moriarty doing in Madrid? Vacationing?
“Ten seconds!” the timer shouts and all ten women on the track bend their knees and straighten their spines. The whole stadium vibrates with energy, fans for both teams stomping and shouting. The whistle blows as the timer drops her arm from where it was held aloft and the track springs to life.
“I think I may have hurt myself during practice.”
I may add more later. Until then, make up your own Deadpool style questions. And... go!
Happy reading!
“I know,” Greg meets his eyes and then John’s with a very serious gaze. “So we keep our eyes and ears open. If something’s going on, we’ll see it. I know you have it all stored in that brain of yours. Have all the accidents in the past been against the Demons?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I hope you all enjoyed this one! Personally, I thoroughly enjoy writing the conversation at dinner. Did Sherlock's past surprise anyone? Eh? Eh? I wish I could see all your faces when Sherlock says outright "I...got married". Ee-hee-hee-hee! Maybe it doesn't have the effect I imagine, but I'm going to hang to onto it anyway. The wide eyes, spit-takes, people falling over backwards in their chairs..it truly fills me with glee.
“It’s something I’ve meant to say always and never have.”
A few shouts of support start from the group of skaters working on core exercises on the outer left side of the track. More join in, along with the group doing squats on the right side, just after the timer yells one minute. As the time ticks down, Freddie and crew are all but drown out by the voices of a team joined in a common goal. Training is key. Training together, helping each teammate reach for something better - one more lap, skimming off one more second, slipping past for one more point -
“SHERLOCK HOLMES.”
“Sorry,” John looks up. “You don’t strike me as the sort of man who waits for anything.”
He nudges forward, urging John down onto his back, and resting his own body atop. He licks inside John’s mouth with an unmatched heat and intensity. When he finally pulls away to gasp for a breath, he and John share an intimate gaze.
