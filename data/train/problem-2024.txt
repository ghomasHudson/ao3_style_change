‘Time, no. Need, yes. Mrs Hudson refuses to do my shopping anymore after she found the fingers in her refrigerator.’ You look at him suspiciously. ‘What? There was no more space in mine!’ he defends himself.
Now you find yourself absurdly regretting it all, in these small moments of insanity when you indulge yourself in old addictions and thought habits.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies immediately. His expression is guarded, but not unkind. Even though he keeps his hands clasped behind his back, a picture of quiet politeness, the stubble makes him look older and brings his chaos into full view.
They haven’t talked about their relationship with Mycroft and with Sherlock’s parents, the three people who are now walking behind them on the long hallways of Sherrinford, and the thought of that particular conversation still unnerves John. But- his brain usefully supplies- if walking hand in hand to see the person who fucked up Sherlock’s life is what Sherlock needs, John is ready to provide.
“… boring, yeah,” John laughs. “But not really,” he adds, cupping Sherlock’s cheek in his hand, his thumb massaging gently. Sherlock leans into the touch, like a cat being petted, and lowers his eyelids with a contented sigh.
Taking Sherlock to bed might be the most dangerous thing he’s ever done, so it’s no wonder that his body reacts as if he’s going to war: rapid breathing, mercurial heartbeat, the very air hitting his skin turned into a full sensory experience as Sherlock leads the way towards their apartment. As soon as John closes the door behind him, Sherlock is on him again, kissing hard enough to bruise.
Sherlock finally decides on a medium-sized porcelain statue of a plump angel with his arms crossed. He picks it up and throws it at Mycroft. He runs out of the room, but he can still hear his brother’s huffed breath of relief and his revolted call. Sherlock smiles. It’s what he deserves for soon being old enough not to be forced to come here every summer, anyway.
Sherlock looks up at him with an expression that does unspeakable things to John’s heart. There’s tenderness and there’s fear, affection, lust and sadness, bringing John back to the days when they’d first met and Sherlock had been so young, so restless and reckless. Impossible to break. And now he’s here, having been broken time and time again, his eyes glassy and pleading, his lips swollen under John’s thumb as he leans in and…
It was all very well trying to prepare himself for what was ahead. But the truth of the matter was, that interaction with Sherlock was completely and utterly heartbreaking for John, who was so used to Sherlock being able to recall every little fact about him that having the tables turned felt oddly disorientating. He remembered the look in Sherlock’s eye after he struggled to find a memory of John. Sherlock had looked devastated – for there was no other word that John could have used. And this is what broke John. Sitting in silence and reflecting, and letting his heart get broken.
Sherlock began to sob again, and John couldn't just sit there and watch him. He shuffled over to the lanky detective and wrapped his arms around the sobbing figure of his best friend. Sherlock's arms wrapped tightly around his back and fisted his hands into the back of John's jacket. It was desperate, and John wasn't going to deny Sherlock comfort in his hour of need. He stroked Sherlock's back, trying to soothe him.
“Young woman, late 20s was found in a skip close to the Thames. Stabbed repeatedly in the face. Had a heavy impact to the side of her head causing major internal damage to her brain, which has been her confirmed cause of death. It seemed she was stabbed in the face several hours after her death.” Said Lestrade, leading the way, angling himself towards Sherlock as he spoke. They reached the room in which Lestrade’s office was located.
John smiled down at her, and received a wide, warm smile in return. He turned and walked back out of the lab. Suddenly the light didn’t feel as bright, and harsh. They were just lights, and they couldn’t hurt him. He walked out of the hospital feeling like a completely different person – like the old John Watson, from a time before the fall. He pulled out his phone and hailed a cab. Once he was sat comfortably in the back, he gave the address.
Greg slammed his fist into the wall next to him, creating a slight dent in the plaster, and a small graze across his knuckles. Not that he cared, he couldn't even feel it.
The cause of the head-splitting pain was firmly rooted here, just beyond the door of the palace, at the forefront of his mind. The door that was refusing to budge even just a fraction of an inch. The door that should not be there at all due to the aesthetics of the room. Yet here they were, attempting to break it down.
"Come on, John! If we have any hope of finding Lawson it will be by tracking these idiots that were paid to carry out this stage. If we're lucky, we'll at least have a location by the end of the evening." Sherlock bundled him in the cab, barked out Mycroft's address and they set off. Sherlock stared out of the window for the vast majority of the journey, lost in his mind palace presumably. John didn't want to disturb him to find out. About 10 minute in, John's phone buzzed. He opened the unread text message.
After this brief deduction, Sherlock returned to the matter at hand. He let out a loud sigh and prepared himself for what he was about to do.
John Watson was, well, as one might have expected experiencing a close brush with death. Pale, thin, broken and covered with wires. This was obviously not the same John Watson that had left them behind. Just as the man curled around his hand was not the same Sherlock Holmes that John had left behind.
“John, in all the time that you have known me, when have you ever been able to describe me as ‘stupid’?”
After a few minutes of basking in the overwhelming relief, Mycroft made his way to John's room. It was the first time since John had left England that Mycroft had laid eyes on the man. Jon was thinner. Much too thin, and ghostly pale. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his hair was most definitely grey rather than the ashy blonde it used to be. He looked like a corpse, and had narrowly avoided being so.
Sherlock had taught himself from a young age that love was a dangerous disadvantage. Everyone he had ever tried to love had left him lonely, and heartbroken. Ever time he had ever thought he'd meant something to someone, he was left alone, wondering what he'd done wrong. So he guarded his heart closely, never allowing anyone close enough to damage something so precious and delicate.
“We’ve a new Sergeant on the team who should be assembling all information regarding the case now,” stated Lestrade, opening the door and holding it for John and Sherlock.
Mary had come again. She bought John a fresh set of clothes and kept an eye on Sherlock as John went to get changed. She’d forced John to eat something, telling him that starving himself wasn’t going to do any good to anybody. John reminded Mary of how much he loved her. Anyone else would have treated him like a child, like he was something delicate that need to be protected. Mary wasn’t like that. She knew what John needed, and made sure that he got it. What John needed now was a rock, something stable to hold onto whilst his life was whirling around him in dizzying circles.
John didn’t seem to notice the tapping, assuming it was just Sherlock being impatient as he sat at the microscope.
“I- You-” Sherlock’s mind struggled to make sense of what was happening. His mind went blank as he tried to piece together the evidence. John chose to take pity on the detective, moving over to him and pulling the violin out of his hands, resting it gently on the floor beside them. With Sherlock’s hands now empty, he had nothing to hold onto that could ground him into reality and he played out John’s rhythm over again in his head. John once again came to his aid, filling the empty space between Sherlock’s long, pale fingers with his own shorter, tanned ones.
John looked at Sherlock with an expression that was a cross between concern and confusion. Sherlock was well acquainted with it, as it was the expression most people wore when they asked Sherlock how he was, and why wasn't he going outside or accepting cases.
“My pleasure, Sherlock.” She smiled up at him, but made no movement to get up, leaving John to dutifully show Sherlock out of the flat.
Sherlock looked at her with curiosity. He considered his answer very carefully before speaking to her in his baritone purr. “Yes I am Sherlock Holmes, also known as ‘that detective that jumped’. Although I am no fake and as you can see, clearly not dead. Now if you will excuse me I have somewhere very important to be which is not here with you enjoying your stimulating,” Sherlock put extra emphasis on this, the tone of sarcasm so clear in his voice that it was completely impossible to miss, “conversation.” He pushed past her. He was always one for manners, the result of being bought up in a rich, important family. However, Sherlock was not bothered with treating anyone who was prolonging his journey to 221B with the proper respects that he had been taught. He could almost hear his mother’s disapproving tutting.
"No bloody idea, mate," he'd said over his pint. John liked to join Greg for a pint every so often. Mary encouraged the behavior, telling him that it was unhealthy to spend all of his time with the same two people.
A wave of pain flooded Sherlock's mind, ice froze his veins and the air was knocked out of his lungs.
They probably wouldn’t always be happy, especially at the beginning, but that was okay. John would be satisfied for himself and Sherlock to be unhappy together, even if they were unhappy forever. Really, there was no other person on the Earth that John would rather be unhappy with.
John would have been perfectly happy to never see another hospital again. He was developing a very strong dislike of them, but who could blame him after the amount of time he'd visited them over the past year. At least this time no-one was unconscious or hooked up to any machines.
The man walking through the doors was not Sherlock Holmes. The man walking through the door was not his best friend. The man walking through the door was nothing more than a shadow of what he used to be, a whisper of memories long forgotten. Just a hollow shell of the rich, enigmatic and human man John had come to know. Physically, he was still the same – alert and intense. He still held his head high, eyes narrowed. He walked the same way he always had, and the curls on his head bounced around just as they had before. John watched from his armchair as Sherlock gazed around the flat as he stood in the doorway, taking in all the new information into his mind palace, and storing it for later analysis. After only a few moments of hesitation, Sherlock strode into the flat and sat down in his armchair. He moved his hands across the smooth, black leather, as if this was a source of comfort to him, as a small child would rub silk against their skin in a time of distress.
"Do what?" asked John, still purposefully not looking at Sherlock. Had that mark always been on the ceiling?
‘Sentiment.’ Sherlock had been thinking about this word a lot lately, and whenever he did, John was present, either physically or just in Sherlock’s mind. But Sherlock was yet to make the connection. He needed to know why. The feeling that accompanied being unsure was painful to Sherlock. He disliked not knowing things, especially things about himself.
From that point, Sherlock found that he couldn’t resist thinking about John at every available opportunity. It made concentrating on The Work significantly more difficult. However, Sherlock persisted and attempted to keep his thoughts at bay whenever they were out on a job. But all it took was one word from John – “amazing,” “brilliant,” “fantastic,” – and Sherlock’s thoughts once again betrayed him. He found himself purposefully showing off more and more around John just to hear him say these things. And when he did, a faint blush would creep over the detective’s face, and he couldn’t help smiling to himself. Of course, he tried to hide it whenever this happened, but if Lestrade caught his eye once or twice, neither of them mentioned it.
John had never considered that, and it was a terrifying thought. Sherlock was only 37 years old, and a widow. That was harsh, and finally explained Sherlock's defences when he was approached by women.
Mycroft's tale had done nothing to calm John down. In fact, it was possible that he was panicking even more. He was extremely relieved and grateful that he was found by nurses and not anyone else. There was a great number of people in London who would have loved to land a punch or two to the consulting detective's face - and not all of them were criminals.
Nothing much had changed since he’s moved out of 221B Baker Street. Everything was almost exactly the same as when he’d moved out, with the addition of a bit more mess, increased amount of equipment for more experiments, and a slightly stronger smell of chemicals and gunpowder. Sherlock had not moved anything of John’s, but the place had been noticeably tidied, or at least an effort had been made. Why couldn’t Sherlock have done this when John had still been living here? What seemed like wasted arguments finally had the affect John had intended, even if it was slightly later than expected.
“We don’t need publicity, not at the moment. The time will come, John, but not quite yet.” Said Sherlock as he moved towards the door. He paused in the frame, his fingers lingering on the sleeve of his favourite coat and blue scarf. They were there only a moment before he moved out the door and down the stairs. John followed, as eager to escape from this new tension.
John smiled up at Sherlock and planted another kiss on the detective’s lips as he tapped out his own response.
"If you were real, I'd be worried about your sanity with a face like that," Sherlock retorted as he grudgingly got up from his chair and proceeded to the toaster.
There was a shuffling outside in the corridor. Sherlock turned his head towards the door only to see his brother walk through, watching him wearily, as if afraid he'd collapse or start a riot if he wasn't careful. Sherlock supposed that this was the end of his dream. Odd. Sherlock did not often dream of Mycroft.
"Well, you can tell Alvarez that I'm not interested. If he wants to talk, he can bring himself to me." If John was able to, he would have been stood up, hands curled into fists at his side, but the chains prevented him from doing so, he was just relying on his voice to try to intimidate these men.
“He doesn’t even call me John anymore.” John choked out the words, ashamed to admit how much this hurt him. Because it did. It had always been Sherlock and John, John and Sherlock, the consulting detective and his blogger. But now, it was Sherlock and Doctor Watson, the consulting detective and the stranger that lived with him – at least in Sherlock’s mind. “And he’s loosing weight, Mary. Too much, it’s scary. He’s obviously not sleeping and he hasn’t appeared to make any progress with his memory.” John sounded like he was breaking, but there were no more tears. Mary rested her hand on his shoulder and pressed her forehead against his temple, eyes closed.
“It can’t be. Impossible.” This muttering came from the figure behind her. Anderson stood with his mouth open, eyes wide like Sally’s, his voice barely a whisper. His paperwork slowly slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor.
Sherlock shot John a withering look. "John, you of all people should know how much I detest repetition."
“Sherlock Holmes is not average.” His voice quivered, and he was struggling to keep a hold of his temper.
“No, John,” Sherlock continued, “I do need to explain. Mycroft kept me in that house and all he ever told me was how well you were doing. I had absolutely no idea what was actually happening. I had no idea that you tried to…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. He just couldn’t. “If I’d have known, if Mycroft had told me what was really going on I would have come back so much sooner, I could have saved you the pain which I’ve obviously caused, and am still causing, judging by the way your holding yourself.” Tears weren’t going to be a problem. Sherlock hadn’t cried since the rooftop, and he wasn’t going to change that. But his voice wavered, ever so slightly, and this was enough for John to understand just how his best friend was feeling.
John had moved on. John had found someone else – a woman, Mary – and had moved on with his life, a life without Sherlock. The worst thing was that it wasn’t just a short fling, as was John’s previous habit in regards to relationships. No, this was the real thing, John wanted to spend the rest of his life with this woman, this infuriatingly interesting woman who was able to give John everything Sherlock was not. And Sherlock was left lonely again.
After Sherlock had returned from pretending to be dead for two years - the absolute dickhead - John thought he would have kicked his habit. But Sherlock had continued his ritual as if no time had passed whatsoever.
Before Sherlock could make any more cutting remarks, John got out of his chair and up the stairs to his old bedroom. He closed the door behind him, holding onto the handle for a short while before turning around to face the room. He did not remember falling back, or down, but next thing he knew he was slumped against the door, his arms wrapped tightly around his knees as he cried into his lap. It was as if the universe was punishing him for a terrible crime. Sherlock couldn't remember who he was, or any of the time they had spent together, and yet they were sat there, practically quoting their past conversations word for word. His crying turned into sobbing, the tears falling thick and fast and never seeming to stop.
Then, like a gust of wind through the dancing dust in the light, their equilibrium had been thrown out of balance. John now needed to pay even more attention to try and balance their lives out again. One blow to the back of the head, that was all it took, and Sherlock had gone down like a ragdoll, unknowingly dragging their lives down with him. One blow to the back of the head.
Sherlock brought a hand up to his face to sooth the angry, red skin in the visible form of a hand on his cheek. That had to have hurt, John could practically feel the sting from the slap through the tense atmosphere that had suddenly settled on the room.
“Sherlock, love, it’s been a long day. Why don’t you pop off to bed and I’ll come and check on you two again in the morning.” She placed her hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze, filling her hands with the thick brown wool of the jumper Sherlock was still wearing.
“Do you remember what happened the last time someone doubted me Lestrade?” Sherlock shot him a furious look. “Or do I need to remind you?” Sherlock was shaking with rage, his hands screwed up into fists at his side. John noticed this and moved forward.
They sat in silence. It wasn't an awkward silence. It was an all too familiar silence that often happened after a brief spat back at Baker Street. It only ever happened after a small argument, if they had a large or serious argument it would often end in John taking a walk so he could get his temper under control. Watson's had famous tempers, John had experienced them first-hand when his father blew up when he was younger. John never wanted to be like that, so he'd remove himself from the situation before his temper got the better of him.
Mary seemed to sense this, and she leaned in and kissed John deeply. As they broke apart, John pulled her in tightly, wanting to be close to her, to just be with her.
It was at this point he had seen John, turning, frantic, panic obvious in his face. His breathing looked shallow, yet too frequent. He stumbled and Sherlock ran. He ran to his best friend’s side.
“Enough,” Lestrade’s voice boomed through the rather small room, the authority in his voice so plain that it nearly made John want to cower and obey his instructions. Nearly. John had been a soldier after all, and it was very hard to intimidate him. Sherlock and Sergeant Carter were another story. Carter completely froze, dropping her gaze to the floor, a slight blush grazing her pale, sharp cheeks. Sherlock had turned his attention back to the other people in the room, eyes widening ever so slightly at the tone of Lestrade’s voice, the only giveaway that he was at all surprised. “Now,” he began looking between the two of them, John taking a step back to slightly behind Lestrade so there was no block in the line of fire, “you either tell me what the hell happened between you two right now or you’ll both be removed from the case, effective immediately.”
Sherlock had fallen hard and fast. They moved in together after two months, settling down as a couple in John’s tiny flat, but they were happy. They were introduced to each other’s friends and families and everyone had commented on what a sickeningly cute couple they were. And they were right, Sherlock and John were absolutely besotted with each other.
Sherlock heard a gasp. Jason had known of his existence, but Sherlock had never allowed himself to talk about John.
“I know about your family, but not much else. I just assumed you were a private person, I didn’t want to pry.”
, John. Absolutely perfect. She was funny, polite, sophisticated and intelligent. God, John. Her mind was amazing. And my parents approved, even Mycroft approved of her. We were together for three years before we got engaged. We married very shortly afterwards. I've never seen anyone so beautiful as she was on our wedding day. Everything was perfect. Our marriage was perfect. We kept each other intellectually stimulated and we enjoyed each other's company. I was happy, John. Completely and utterly
"I'm a high-functioning sociopath, John," Sherlock corrected, still refusing to look at him. "We've established this many times."
Sherlock remembered about how had cried that night, the tears had flown freely down his cheeks as he listened to John’s carefully crafted words. He remembered falling to his knees in front of John, bringing John’s lips to meet his in a kiss as he whispered the word ‘yes’ over and over. Their life together had just begun.
John let out a sigh and hailed the next available taxi. He told the cabbie where to go, and slumped back into the seat staring out the window. An ache began in his chest, and unpleasant thoughts flashed through his mind.
At first, having Mrs Hudson around was a godsend. It left John to his own private mourning, to let him get on with it whilst making sure he didn't starve. She cooked for him, made him sleep and wash. John drew the line at her cleaning the flat though, he wasn't quite ready for that yet. Since then, he hadn't uttered a word to the woman except for thanks where thanks were due.
"Please, don't tell anyone." Sherlock never said please. Maybe a few times if he wanted something from John, but usually, pleading was beneath him. Maybe this was why that one word broke Molly's heart a little.
John’s voice was clearer now and he sounded utterly wrecked. A jolt of pain shot through Sherlock’s abdomen. Sherlock knew that the pain was in his mind, but it hurt nonetheless. And the pain in his head increased further.
He managed to solve a murder whilst delivering his best man’s speech, and saved the life of Major Sholto. Whilst John attended to the Major, Sherlock excused himself to practice the waltz he was to play for John and Mary’s first dance. He had taught John how to waltz, had savoured the opportunity to hold him close, because he knew that at the end of the evening, John would return home to Mary, and Sherlock would be left alone again.
He could hear her voice, muffled through the floorboard but unmistakably hers. She sounded as if she was crying, her voice shaking more than usual and long pauses where she stopped to take breath, more frequently than usual. Not a deduction to the standard of Sherlock Holmes, but enough for John Watson to know that something out of the ordinary was happening in the flat below him.
Breathing, breathing’s good, and he was managing to do it without the aid of any apparatus, so the likely hood of him being in a coma was low. Excellent, less chance of any brain damage – although John wait until a discussion with another professional before being absolutely certain.
He allowed himself to be overcome with the grief that he’d been forcing back. He had been determined to at least make it to Mary’s funeral without completely surrendering to the crushing sadness. He had succeeded, feeling only empty until now, not allowing himself to feel, to accept that this was happening.
“Sherlock,” he murmured, Sherlock turning his attention to John for the first time since they entered the room, “maybe we should leave.”
Before, John's natural reaction would have been to go and check on Mrs Hudson, to see if she was okay, to let the army doctor side of him take over. But now, consumed by grief and confusion, he let her be. She was tough, Mrs Hudson, although she may not look it. She's been able to take care of herself before, and John was certain that she could cope now.
Sherlock bought a hand up to wipe the treacherous tears from his face. Only after he'd wiped them did he remember that there was no-one here to witness them.
John leaned back in his chair, relaxing into it as he had done during many lazy evenings in Baker Street when they we're between cases.
"We don't have a minute, John. In the time your wasting the abductor could be there right now clearing away any shred of evidence that I could have found. He's clever, John. Very clever. He knew about the blind spot, the one and only hole in the security put in place by my brother. He knew exactly what they were doing. Oh," Sherlock clapped his hands together once and bought them up to his face, in line with his nose and shut his eyes, thinking, "I love clever ones, they're a challenge." His eyes snapped open and he bought his hands away by about an inch or two, still held together. "Finally, something interesting, something worthwhile, it's better than Christmas." Sherlock was now struggling to keep the smile from his face. John looked up from his phone as he pressed send and was reminded of their first case together. He was now fighting back his own smile, bringing back yet more memories of their first case together.
“Would I have done the same for him?” John watched Sherlock, who slowly turned to look him straight in the eyes. It sent a jolt of pain through John, and he had to turn away from his intense stare.
"Oh." There was no other reaction John could think of. Mary smiled up at him and closed her eyes. She looked peaceful, happy, completely and utterly perfect.
"John, look at this." Sherlock kneeled down on the floor, and John followed suit. Leaning in closer, John saw the tiniest, uneven black lines on the edge of the pavement, dragging towards the road. "It's rubber, John. Rubber from-"
"Ah, shit." Staying alive. Of course. Moriarty. "Damn it I'm sorry, Sherlock. I didn't think before I spoke."
“Where to?” Sherlock snapped back into the present. The cab driver had not turned around, but waited patiently with his hands at the wheel for Sherlock to give him an address.
He looked like a man who’d just returned from the dead, probably felt like one too. But Sherlock made no move to begin the conversation, and waited for John to begin speaking.
“I think it’s the other way around.” Jason sounded like he was laughing and crying at the same time.
Sherlock’s eyes turned downwards, refusing to meet John’s gaze, almost as if he was ashamed about what he was about to say.
Mrs Hudson sighed in relief, nodded her head and proceeded to help Sherlock bring John in through the doors and up the stairs to 221B. By this time, John was fully unconscious. Mrs Hudson said she didn’t think she could make it up to John’s room, so they put him on the sofa. Sherlock retrieved a few blankets from his bedroom and used them to cover John. He arranged the pillows to support his head and let him rest.
John was going to go to 221B, and with the help of Mrs Hudson and Mycroft – who had volunteered his services – to prepare the flat for Sherlock’s return. Sherlock was still being kept in hospital. According to Mycroft, Sherlock had been too busy insulting all of the staff - including the specialist psychologist who had been bought in to check his mental condition – that none of the test had been carried out. Typical. Sherlock always was a stubborn git, and amnesia clearly hadn’t changed a thing.
John rolled his eyes. Same old, same old. Nothing ever changes. Sherlock was lying across the bed he was currently inhabiting, stretched out to his full length so his feet were gracelessly dangling off of the edge. His arm was thrown across his eyes as though to shield him from the stupidness that radiated from the entire inhabitants of this earth. John sat watching him, still sat in the same chair, arms folded. He looked very much like the picture definition of a tragic heroine. Drama queen.
But John would be happy. Sherlock reminded himself of this everyday, and it was this thought that kept Sherlock from running away and avoiding the whole thing altogether.
John shifted in his sleep, the blanket fell off him awkwardly, leaving him exposed, even though he was still fully dressed. Sherlock moved over to him and replaced the blanket with caution, trying not to wake John. He looked peaceful as he slept, younger. Sherlock’s mouth twisted into a fond smile as he continued to watch John. He sat back in his armchair as silently as he could. He removed his skull from the fireplace and held it at eye level. He didn’t say anything to the yellowing bone. He simply looked. He remembered all the one-sided conversations he’d shared with the thing. But then he turned back to John.
“This,” John said, unfurling one of his hands from the ridiculously expensive shirt that Sherlock wore and wrapping it around Sherlock to reach his back and pull him closer, “is good.” This is what John needed. A friend. Even if Sherlock didn’t realise this, or know who John was, John was grateful just to have the source of comfort that Sherlock provided.
"Yes," said the world's only consulting detective as he returned to his microscope. "It was extremely inconvenient, John"
John’s voice had echoed in his ears and Sherlock had desperately held onto what he assumed was a hallucination. He didn’t care, he needed to hear John’s voice.
From a safe distance away, and guarded by the shadow of a towering oak tree, a very much alive John Watson looked on as his best friend walked away from his grave, still wiping away his tears. He wanted nothing more that to walk up to the man, to put his arms around him, apologise an go back home. But that was impossible - not whilst Moriarty's network was still fully operational.
, not anymore)- he pins you against the door, knee between your thighs, and takes you apart second by second. It’s not systematic, it isn’t even tender, it’s just…
. The routine of work and home life, all predictable patterns and worn-out evenings when nothing happens except the two of you. And it’s nice, it’s what you wanted. You love this woman, and sometimes you think you could even die for her. The problem is, you’re not sure you want to
You expect it to fade with time. You expect your nights to be more and more peaceful, because the cold thrill of absence shouldn’t leave any ground for these images to thrive.
‘Were you aware that the poison you used only has a forty percent chance of working?’ Sherlock asks, oblivious to her comment.
John breathes, clenches and unclenches his fists, turns around to look at Sherlock. Sherlock, who has been high for weeks, Sherlock, who almost died for on him, Sherlock, who seems to have lost his edges, watered down to this raw, vulnerable creature who looks at him with an honesty that he can hardly bear.
The train moves slowly through the country, leaving it scarred by metal and smoke and sound. Sherlock loves it. He loves the sound the most- the staccato imposing a steady pattern in his thoughts, smooth yet steady, rigorous yet creating a wholly different world. The world outside the windowpane is nothing particularly entertaining, only green fields and steep hills, yet he loses himself in absent contemplation, if only for a few moments. He opens the window and tests the temperature of the air with his hand, followed by his head which he forgets about until Mummy reminds him where he is, and that he should close the window because Mycroft is still having a cold.
Sherlock’s face broke into quite possibly the largest, most genuine smile John had ever seen on the detective’s face.
“That’s your mug. You use it every time you visit us here. No-one else uses it. You had three mugs to choose from, and you immediately chose the one that belonged to you.” John’s voice was shaking slightly as he explained. Is it possible that despite the disaster surrounding him, Sherlock’s mind was still trying to break free from the fog?
John did not take Molly’s hand. Instead, he swooped towards her and flung his arms round her tiny frame. He picked her up from the floor and swung her around the room, Molly holding on tightly so she wouldn’t fly away into any expensive equipment if he dropped her. John was laughing again, and this time, Molly was too.
“Sherlock, please stop interrupting and let me finish my bloody sentences!” John flashed a fond, teasing smile at the man sat opposite him.
A woman - the new Sergeant, John assumed - was stood with her back to them when they entered the room.
Luckily, quietness and efficiency didn't make up for accuracy in the case of the Serbian assassin. Not that he was alive to defend himself.
Sherlock threw himself into the wedding plans, playing the part of the best man with passion and enthusiasm. Well, as much passion and enthusiasm that Sherlock could put into something that isn't a case. But despite his efforts, Sherlock seemed distant, like it wasn't actually
He and Mycroft were sat on the uncomfortable chairs at either side of Sherlock's bed, although, since John had retreated into his morbid imagination, Mycroft had vacated his seat and was now pacing near the partially open window, speaking rapidly into his mobile phone as he did so. Sherlock himself had removed himself from under the sheets and was now sat cross-legged on the blue blankets that the hospital provided as a poor replacement for a duvet. Sherlock was fully towards John, and John subconsciously leaned forwards so Sherlock could speak to him directly. Sherlock also leaned forwards, although his actions seemed more deliberate. Their eyes locked and didn't break apart throughout the entirety of Sherlock's monologue.
She looked questioningly at John, silently asking if anything was wrong. Clearly, John’s face was shocked or completely blank, because she moved around her husband to greet whoever was at the door. As soon as her eyes landed on that tall mass that was the world’s only consulting detective, something in her face lit up.
He was chained to the wall at his hands, making any escape attempts extremely difficult. Usually in these situations, John was locked in the cells and no other attempts to restrain him were made. However, Alvarez was clearly not taking any chances. It probably didn't help that John had earned himself a bit of a reputation among Moriarty's network. Word had travelled fast of the nameless, faceless agent who was talking the organisation apart bit by bit. He was known to be violent, often losing his temper quickly, and leaving no survivors. If he was shown no mercy, John decided he was not going to give any. Besides, this way, there were no loose ends.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock might as well have shouted for all the effect his voice was having on Mycroft, but instead he whispered, his voice deadly and low, “for your own safety I advise you to leave the room now because I will not stop myself from hurting you.”
Mary was refusing to look at him, and this pained John more than anything. They’d already talked about it. Nothing needed repeating. She didn’t want treatment.
But now was not the time to think about his complex relationship with Mycroft. Sherlock had somewhere to be.
Sherlock waltzed into the building as if he owned the place, which Sherlock probably thought. John sniggered at his internal commentary, quickening his steps to keep up with the long strides of the aloof Consulting Detective.
“Sherlock,” John began, the words catching in this throat, almost as is he was having trouble articulating a complete sentence. If it were any other person, Sherlock would lose his patience and snap, but this was John, and Sherlock made an exception. “Sherlock, you- you wouldn’t-” he sighed, trying to reform the words in his head. “I know it’s been tough for you, it’s been tough for both of us, especially what happened yesterday. I just want you to know that you can always talk to me if you need to.”
To John it feels like familiar and uncharted territory at the same time, an old project revisited, redacted and possibly improved (with a cost). He’s tempted to feel like an intruder, but the way Sherlock welcomes him into his space day by day leaves no place for doubt. He is wanted. In a ridiculous flash, he imagines Sherlock saying this (because it’s something that Sherlock would say, if he knew how to):
“Yes, fine, I know, I will. Today. But first, we’ve other things to attend to,” he said, kissing John again.
Sherlock stepped into the kitchen fully then, toeing into John’s space. “And what if I did? Would it be not good?”
“John,” Sherlock breathed out. His voice had turned a bit wobbly, and his hands were restlessly carding through the hair at John’s nape.
John hummed. They fell back into quiet for a few minutes, then he said, meaning a thousand things at once, “You’re incredible, you know that, right?”
Half eight in the morning; John eating, drinking, reading; Sherlock watching; The morning after. We’ve been over this.
“-sorry, I’m sorry, Sherlock, listen to me.” He grabbed Sherlock hands, stilling them, pulling them down. John ran his thumbs along Sherlock’s skin, his hold strong enough for Sherlock to focus on the feeling. “I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry, calm down, you’re okay, I’m sorry. I understand. I understand. Sit down, c’mon, you’re okay.”
John, understandably surprised, tried to inhale the bite of toast he’d been chewing on. He coughed, sputtered, struggled to swallow around the bread and took a large gulp of tea. He was pink in the face.
So, he was thinking. About John. And he decided that he didn’t want to call John his boyfriend. No, that was too pedestrian. John was so much more than that, so much more than a boyfriend. He could say partner, but, well, perhaps that was a bit too formal. They were business partners already, worked together, you see, so there wasn’t enough insinuation. Significant other held more truth than the others, but it was a mouthful. It wasn’t neat enough. Lover was simply too intimate to announce to outside parties.
“Actually, quite the opposite,” John confessed, unable to keep the smile out of his voice. His back was against the kitchen table now.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked down to it, then back up to catch John’s gaze. Sherlock’s expression turned a bit calculating, a bit hopeful, but still unsure. Trying to figure out if John was amused, or endeared, or embarrassed, perhaps.
They laid in silence for a bit, until John nudged Sherlock and said, “So, you were saying something about marriage?”
John opened his mouth to respond, but Sherlock flicked a hand in his direction. “Yes, I know you agree. Say something else. Something
“Yes. I love how your voice changes when your inhibitory control breaks. When you’re in awe. When you’re passionate. When you fight to control it, which you often do.”
‘Not purpose. Order. I think the world is beautifully crafted, a mechanism where every part plays its role. I suppose you could call it purpose, thought that’s not really what it comes down to, is it?’
He doesn’t allow himself to think about it too much, lest he starts hoping. He doesn’t know how that particular feeling would fit in his life, in the marred territory between his ribs. If life has taught him something, it’s that taking things as they are is the safer- and saner- bet when confronted with the flippant, dizzying alternative of hope.
John laughs affectionately and gives a last roll of the hips before he takes Sherlock’s hands and places them at his sides, lifting himself out of the chair and kneeling at Sherlock’s feet. He doesn’t break eye contact as he opens Sherlock’s belt, unzips his trousers, gestures for him to lift his hips so he can slide them down.
“Alright?” he asks. Sherlock’s face softens up and he smiles back, pressing their foreheads together, his breath ghosting on John’s lips. Warm,
“I trusted you since the day you killed a man for me with no second thoughts,” Sherlock breathes against his scar, his neck, his lips, as if he knows that this, exactly, is what John needs to hear. “I know who you are, and I want all of it.”
After weeks of late-night chaste embraces, the change of pace is electrifying. Although John has been surrounded by Sherlock’s scent night by night, he feels as if this is the first time he’s awakened to it. When he leans in to taste it, pressing his tongue where Sherlock’s pulse point is hammering away, the detective rests his head against the wall, slightly tilted to offer him a better angle.
Without taking her eyes off her brother, she hits the first notes of his song- the one he’d composed years ago, the one that had made John green with jealousy, thinking it was for Irene, when in fact- Sherlock had confessed- it had been for him all along.
This is Sherlock’s heart, pouring out through his shaky fingers, his shallow breaths, his reluctance to look John in the eye, now that they’re finally seeing each other again.
“Nevermind. You’ve deduced it already, probably years ago,” John says. For a second, he feels like a fool for wanting to share his secrets with someone who’s mapped them all out from the first day they’d met.
He doesn’t believe in fortune or in faith, but he remembers words about how the world works in perfect order, always identical with itself, always falling into place. After many years, he feels like he found something that he wasn’t even looking for. A long-lost friend and lover that he forgot how to miss, because they were always part of him. A phantom limb. A childhood memory. The voice inside his head, the moments of eerie quiet before the storm.
In the end, she’d broken down under his pressures. You don’t mention how they’d been filming you and John that evening, how she’d seen everything. The tape is still out there, waiting to be exposed. You would make it your next mission to recover it, that is if you cared. You don’t care. Let the whole world know.
‘So, which one’s it gonna be?’ he asks. The field is barren, now deserted even by the last light of the sunset, making you feel of far too little significance to be holding two lives in the palms of your hands. Sherlock and Mary are tied to posts: Sherlock to the right, Mary to the left. They’re sedated, but conscious enough to be aware of what’s happening. You want to go to both of them, tell them that it’s going to be alright, that as usual, you have no idea what’s happening, but that you’ll figure a way out, because that’s how it must always happen. The problem is, you don’t really believe in that anymore. ‘You save your wife, your friend dies. You save him, she dies,’ he grins.
And I’d have you tied up, so you couldn’t even think about cheating your way out.  How much time until you’d start begging? Twenty minutes? Fifteen?”
, as oblivious to himself as you are now; it’s almost too much information to process, his hands mouth body on you the way he grinds against you
,” Sherlock says, and the reply throws John off-kilter, making him giggle as the weight in his stomach eases up. It seems that laughing in bed with Sherlock feels a little like giggling at a crime scene: silly, natural and entirely endearing.
They arrive as the first rays of dawn start bursting from beyond the horizon- bright shades of pink and orange, exhilaratingly alive, a little violent to John’s weary eyes. They pick up a half-asleep Rosie from next door and he holds her tight as she wraps her little arms around him. Sherlock is looking at them with unmistakable warmth in his eyes and John has the sudden urge to hug him as well. He wants to build a fort around them, to keep them out of harm’s way- the two people he cares about most in the world.
Instead of Mary’s ghost, it’s his internal voice speaking to him now, words and thoughts reclaimed as his own.
you anything to thank me for.” John feels moisture gathering in the corners of his eyes, entirely unwelcome. He doesn’t want to cry in front of Sherlock, not again. He swallows, wipes at his eyes, squares his shoulders. Looks up.
“Sometimes,” John says, “I imagine going slow, just like today. Taking you apart with my mouth, working every inch of your gorgeous body.” He lowers his voice, leaning upwards to whisper in Sherlock’s ear- “
John holds him and holds him and holds him through it, hoping it’s enough for his body to relearn the feeling of safety.
“Not always,” John replies with a frown, pulling his hand back from Sherlock’s skin as soon as he feels the familiar bitterness rising in his throat.
‘I don’t think I’ve actually fucked anyone until now. I might’ve made it all up. And we didn’t even…god,’ he says when he starts regaining his voice.
John looks at you with an empty expression. He’s crying, but probably doesn’t realize it, and it’s like his sadness is crawling out of the cavity of his chest and into yours, only to add to the whirlwind. You sit like this for a while, with Mary in his arms and you in his eyes. He must want to know what happened, why did she want to shoot him. You’re tempted to pity him, poor John, always caught in between, always with his heart in dangerous places, but you know that you can’t love and pity someone at the same time.
‘Hello,’ you try. You need human contact, some semblance of warmth to make you forget about the distance between the two of you.
You keep rewinding memories, opening all these doors from your palace to let the feeling slide out so only the unfolding scenes remain, bland and colourless, devoid of any emotion. You can’t do it. Your longing is like an entity of its own, wolfing down your resources, constantly feeding on his absence. You move his chair out of the way. You consider moving places, then you spend an entire afternoon sulking at your own absurdity. You feel just like before- the loss, the refractory period, inertia gnawing at your bones and making it seem to last forever. It won’t, you repeat to yourself. Nothing ever does.
“Good,” Mycroft replies, seeming satisfied with his answer. “Have a good day, Doctor Watson. And… see you soon.”
You give up calling and knocking at his door after the second month. You’ve only tried both things twice, but it already feels like you’ve crossed a line, stepping into a space where you’re not wanted anymore.
“In the time when I dismantled Moriarty’s network,” he starts slowly, sounding like he’s picking every word with the utmost care, “I… couldn’t get high. Obviously. But it was…” He stops, as if reconsidering his words, rewriting them. “What I never told you, John, about that day on the rooftop is that there was a sniper for each of you. You, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade. Moriarty made me choose between your death and mine. I had several plans laid out, but none of them involved you knowing. I didn’t think it would affect you as it did, I thought… you would just get on with your life, wait for me and welcome me back whenever I came.”
He settles his hands on Sherlock’s hips to feel every twitch, every tremble of his lover’s body as he alternates soothing touches with rougher ones, tongue pressing insistently with the barest hint of teeth. Sherlock moans and ruts against silky satin at the ghost of pain, a reaction that goes straight to John’s groin, building up the exquisite pleasure-pressure there.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replies with a hint of a smile. He’s lying on the couch, long hands together against his chin; his thinking posture. It still looks handsome on him, especially now, in the late afternoon glow. It makes him look younger. “I played,” he continues. “She sat with her back to me, didn’t turn once.”
John blinks, breathing into the silence between them, unsure about which part of Sherlock's words is the most difficult to process.
“Anyway, none of that was a good reason for…doing what I did,” he continues, fixing his gaze somewhere in the area of Sherlock’s chest. “
“Are you sure about this,” John asks, and he’s surprised to find that it doesn’t come out as a question.  “The last time we went so fast…”
“Good. You’re human. I was beginning to have doubts again,” Sherlock replies on a quiet, almost whispered voice, but there is also a lightness in his tone, an invitation to play, to let go.
More pity poured out the wrong way, how he’d have looked at you like you were a hurt animal instead of a hunter disappointed, aware that nothing ever again will compare to this day, this evening when everything turned to gold.
‘Too early?’ you ask, shuffling awkwardly on your feet. Your hands are clasped tight at your back. There is no danger of them straying out.
He stops midway, finally grasping the reason why his heart is still beating wildly in his chest, even if Sherlock is safe now.
, this new, fragile, wonderful reality between him and the man who had saved him. John swallows and straightens his back, squaring his shoulders in a soldier’s defense. Mycroft and his parents are moving towards the line of chairs arranged against the wall, but Sherlock doesn’t take his eyes off Eurus, and soon, the taut, invisible line connecting their gazes seems to be sucking the air out of the entire room.
‘See you around, John,’ he smirks. Do you seriously spend your nights awake because of this git? You laugh quietly to yourself and head for home.
‘That’s the one,’ you say, handing him the milk that you always used to buy for the two of you. ‘Forgot already?’
“Good,” Sherlock replies, eyeing John mischievously before they both burst into laughter, foreheads touching as they ease each other out of their shirts,
. This effortless complicity seems to lift a weight from both of their chests, reminding John that this is the two of them, his steady island of dangerous comfort in the madness of everyday life and absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
The intensity of his own thoughts surprises him. He’s never allowed himself to go that far, to imagine the details of being with Sherlock. There’d been fantasies before, of course, but he’d kept them purposefully blurry, as if he could pretend it was still a woman beneath that unruly mop of hair, kissing him with those tantalizing cupid’s bow lips. The very real, very sharp electricity of him being aroused by another man- by
John has been learning from a friend and his drawings have gotten better. Sherlock looks at himself and sees a beauty that he doesn’t recognize in the mirror- all of John’s portraits are precision and grace.
for you. The noises you make are absolutely obscene, you don’t even dare touch yourself because you know you’re gonna come on the spot.
The street is spinning around your head, or perhaps it’s the other way around; these are the days after a fight, when you’ve seen dozens of soldiers in pain and blood and torn up skin and flesh and nothing else really matters anymore, not the cars and the noise, not your feet stumbling on the concrete, not the way you take two wrong turns or completely forget that you should have taken a taxi in the first place. It’s all décor to the story unfolding in your veins. Him, on your skin and underneath it. Years collapsed into one moment so fleeting that it seems like a dream. Too much, too fast, the way secrets stopped being secrets without use of any spoken word and then the gate was shut without a second thought, a garden in bloom to become a cemetery. It’s hateful and wrong, like towers built awry. Your blood sings for escape.
John clears his throat, looks away. Remembers himself. He could brush it off once more, just another misplaced reply too strange to warrant a second thought, except. Well.
“I want to hear everything,” John says, surprised at how hoarse his voice sounds. “You, before. College. The Work. Those two years, those we never talk about. I’ve been wondering for ages, you know. Your brilliant mind is always on display, but this.” He splays his fingers on Sherlock’s chest, where his heart is. “Will you let me?”
“You’ll tell me who did it?” John asked, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s, their mouths a scant couple of centimetres apart.
Sherlock breathed in deeply, pushing away his nerves. It was just one question, and he already knew the answer. Most likely. Still, a declaration such as, ‘we should get married’, is much less vulnerable than asking the question.
Sherlock perked up, turned quickly and suddenly to face John. He stalked up to him, gripping John’s shoulders so brusquely the tea from John’s mug sloshed over the side.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, which were utterly blown out. “Yes,” he said. “Now kiss me, before I frame you for murder.”
“Yes?” John’s voice had the air of mirth to it, and he kissed Sherlock’s skin again, this time at the soft spot just below his ear. As he pulled away he gave a small nip, experimenting, and his hypothesis was confirmed when Sherlock practically keened against him.
“I think I overreacted,” Sherlock teased, a smirk playing across his lips. “That wasn’t brilliant of you, per se, just… considerably helpful.”
“Yes,” agreed Sherlock. “She initially was in shock and gravely injured, of course, that’s why her denial seemed so believable. But when I went to question her, she folded almost immediately. Apparently she was committing the crimes alongside her boyfriend, but when it got too much for her she wanted to turn them in. The other woman she was with was a close friend of hers, but the boyfriend got into the flat and killed the friend, then attempted to kill her.”
It was half eight in the morning. John was eating toast and eggs, drinking tea, and reading the paper. Sherlock was sat across from him; he was watching, per usual. (He does that a lot, watch John.) Last night they had finally gotten their shit together and, well, gotten together... if you catch my meaning.
“John,” Sherlock repeated, huffy and put out and somewhat short of breath, which John found wickedly adorable.
Well, I guess it worked out in the end! I don’t know about you all, but I’m quite happy for them. I have a feeling the wedding planning might be a bit chaotic, though.
They haven’t talked about John’s bedroom in the new 221B, or the lack thereof. Whenever the subject of his old room comes up, Sherlock immediately mentions nursery furniture and children’s books and educative toys, making John wonder exactly how long-term is this arrangement of theirs. Does Sherlock want to see Rosie grow up? Will they raise her together? If his old room will be her new bedroom, where will he sleep?
“Shut up,” John laughs. “One that matters right now. I’m sorry I didn’t get to actually touch you the first time I made you come.”
“I don’t find excuses for you, John,” Sherlock answers promptly, his voice steady once again. “I see the man you can be.”
“Flattering,” John breathes out, hoping that his tone will convey the depths of his contempt for whoever dared to do this to Sherlock. “I would have killed them before they laid a finger on you.” This is the man he loves and these are the years that separate them, mapped out, painfully visible, even in the dim light of the evening. John wants to erase them, render them null, send them back into the nothingness they came from. He drags his wet lips across Sherlock’s shoulder- slow, thorough, reverent-, stopping at each scarred line of skin to feel the texture and the warmth under his tongue. In his peripheral vision, Sherlock is curling his fingers in the sheets, his upper body rising and falling rhythmically to the pattern of his quickening breaths.
Without saying a word, Mrs Hudson patted Sherlock's arm lightly, before turning and walking back up the path to the waiting, black car that Mycroft had provided for their visit. It was their first one since the funeral.
"Send a text to Lestrade immediately. Tell him to get a decent and moderately intelligent team up to Vincent Square as soon as possible – not Anderson, he'll just get in the way. We need to close off the road, I need to get a closer look at this blind spot." Sherlock practically jumped out of the chair and began to stride towards the door in his ling, confident steps. He turned back to look at John, who was still recovering from the near miss. "John. The text."
Sherlock made Mycroft swear that he wouldn’t tell John. Mycroft had agreed – a shocking feat. Mycroft never agreed with Sherlock, at least not out loud. But the promise had come with a condition.
He'd felt so helpless, unable to reach his wife as her body flailed out of control. He was lucky he was a doctor, for if he wasn't, he would never have known what to do. But John didn't want to be alone in this, especially now there were fits involved. John wanted more qualified people around her at all times. He also wanted her to be comfortable, and the hospice could provide all of this and more.
It wasn’t easy. It really wasn’t. John was prepared to admit that it was the most difficult thing he’d ever had to do. Even Sherlock couldn’t deny that it was hard.
"That's a brilliant idea!" She almost sang. Before she could exchange any details, Sherlock grabbed John by the sleeve of his coat and propelled him towards another black, London taxi, which he seemed to just conjure out of nowhere.
John liked his smile. It suited him. Sherlock buried his face in the pillow, trying to hide his face as it burned with another red flush. Once again he felt the speed of his heartbeat increase, and the swooping sensation in his stomach. Sherlock didn’t know why he felt like this, or even know what to name this particular feeling. He’d never experienced anything like it, it was so all consuming. He’d have to get control over his body. He couldn’t let John realise something was going on before he’d figured it out himself.
But she’s changed since ‘the accident’. Molly was more reserved now, and was standing up to Sherlock a lot more. Clearly, something must have happened to make her like this. What it was, Sherlock could not figure out. And there was nothing Sherlock liked more than a puzzle. His intention had been to acquire a new set of kidneys to experiment on, but the kidneys could wait. This was much more interesting.
The day after their return to Baker Street, John had gone to visit Mary's grave. He had taken pink roses, Mary's favourites, to lay beside it. IT was his first visit since her funeral. He felt guilty for the extended delay, but he had been wrapped up in taking care of Sherlock. Now that Sherlock had recovered, and John trusted him enough to leave him alone in the flat without running off to shoot up again, there really was no excuse. John hated that he had left it this long, but he was here now, and that was what mattered. He lay the flowers down carefully, as if he was afraid that they would shatter into a million pieces - just as his life had done when he'd lost Mary. He stood there, string at the white marble, caught up his own thoughts, ignorant to the world around him.
“We talked about getting a dog. John like bulldogs and I liked Irish setters and we couldn’t settle. We even spoke about children, but decided that we shouldn’t have children until we had settled on a dog. We should have just bought a bulldog.”
“Jason, please let me finish because if you stop me I might never her through this.” Sherlock’s breath caught as he felt his emotions overwhelming him again. Jason remained quiet, and Sherlock loved him for that.
Once Molly had guided him through the front entrance, she whispered a number in his ear and gave him a general nudge in the direction of one of Bart's many corridors.
John didn't walk straight in, as Mycroft no doubt expected him to. He had to take a few moments outside to prepare himself. Sherlock had used his middle name, but that didn't necessarily mean anything. Did it? Maybe John was reading too much into it. But he wouldn't know unless he walked in. But he couldn't.
John had grown used to Sherlock's oddities, but there was one particular habit that made John feel uneasy, and John couldn't put his finger on why. It was probably because he simply didn't know the reason behind it. He knew about everything else. The violin at God awful hours of the morning? It was because it helped him think. Not speaking for days on end? That was Sherlock delving into the depths of his mind palace. Peculiar and often dangerous experiments on the kitchen table? It was Sherlock's childish love and obsession with science and expanding his knowledge that prompted him to continue with this. But this particular oddity? John just didn't know.
“This is hard. Much harder than I thought it was going to be.” Mary did not offer advice, for there was none to give. Neither did she give John pity, for which he was grateful. He could not stand to have anyone’s pity.
John collapsed into the chair beside Sherlock’s bed, trying desperately to stop his hands from shaking as he opened the envelope.
Sherlock's gaze hadn't left John the entire time. He viably flinched when the gun the gun pressed closer. He did not try to hide it. Moriarty already knew that John was Sherlock's pressure point, as Sherlock was John's.
‘What has become of you?’ Mycroft asks when he comes to visit, his presence made inevitable by Ms Hudson’s mindless hospitality. You would’ve slammed the door right in his face.
