“—this is when you always get so impatient and I can’t ever deny you anything, so I move,” he does so, “and it gets so much better.  Can you feel it, Sherlock?  How perfect it is?”
Sherlock tries to turn away from him, to hide from John’s unwavering gaze, but the man won’t let him.  He enters the room and walks towards Sherlock, reaching a hand out quickly to wrap around Sherlock’s bony wrist and
Sherlock is in no position to know what is best for himself, to know what is right.  So it has to be John.  It
He is just about to reach for the white granulated substance when he hears Sherlock say ominously behind him, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.  It’s rat poison.  I think.  I can’t remember which bowl I put it in.”
John takes a moment to stare at Sherlock in surprise.  Sherlock hardly ever tells him “no” outright.  He will say that he doesn’t want to do something, and he will complain and moan and cry crocodile tears when John forces an issue, but the little boy isn’t usually so brazen as to tell his Daddy “no” when John wants him to do something.
Sherlock huffs in irritation, as if he is the one who is put out, and crosses his arms as he sits up in bed, leaning against the headboard.  “I love you, and I can’t wait until we can start our lives together,” he grouses, but John can tell by the soft, affectionate sound of his voice that he means the words.  “Is that an acceptable enough reason to be woken up in the middle of the night?”
Sherlock doesn’t need to be told twice.  He bucks against John’s body and gasps, fingers biting into John’s shoulder.  John follows right behind him, filling him up with a small grunt and a stutter of his hips, pressing into him deep, dropping kisses to his face and neck.
“Yeah, right,” John said, frowning.  “Okay, well then you’ll have to have something that you need fixed,” he stated matter-of-factly, deciding that if Sherlock was doing this only in the name of science then he could be detached and clinical about it as well.  “Or that you need to happen.”
Sherlock swirls his tongue around the tip of the head like John did to him earlier, but doesn’t go past the crown.  His movements are jerky and unsure, but the warmth and wetness of his mouth more than make up for that, and he seems eager enough to learn what John likes.
“Okay, so if he buys all of your clothes, why do you still dress like this?”  John makes a gesture to the back of Sherlock’s current ratty outfit, even though he knows Sherlock can’t see him.
“It’s been a while since he’s fucked you, hasn’t it, John?” Sherlock asks him, voice dark and deep and John can only whimper in reply.  “You look so tight, like you haven’t been stretched in ages.  I can fix that for you.”
“God,” Mary whispers, and there is a short pause in which he thinks she may have fallen back to sleep.  But then she speaks again.  “That’s horrible, John, it really is, don’t get me wrong.  I feel bad for the kid, I truly do.  But you need to be careful.  You know how easily things can get misconstrued in this day and age.  If someone were to get the wrong idea it would ruin you.”
“I guess we’ll need to talk about names, won’t we?” the brunette man agreed, his hand finally giving up the search and moving away from his stomach.  He curled back into himself on the chair and stared at John from across the coffee table.  “Any ideas?”
“But, Daddy,” Sherlock starts, and John can tell by the sound of his voice that he is on the verge of throwing a mighty strop.
John lets out a nervous, embarrassed chuckle and brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck, looking away from Sherlock’s piercing eyes boring into him.  “Yeah,” he tells Sherlock truthfully.
Sherlock’s smirk grows at John’s silence.  He shouldn’t be able to seem so haughty while he’s sitting there looking like a wet cat, hair plastered to his head and clothes stuck to him oddly, making him look skinnier than he seems, which is already bordering on frightful.  But he does, and it only grows the longer John stays silent.
“That’s easy for you to say,” Sherlock answers with a huffy roll of his eyes.  “All you need is one orgasm before you’re practically falling asleep on top of me.”
It is whispered so quietly that John thinks he may have heard wrong.  No, he definitely must have heard wrong.
“Yes,” he heard Sherlock say shortly, and judging by the muffled sound of his voice, he was fairly certain the other man had already snuggled comfortably back into his pillow while John stood in the middle of their dark, cold room, perplexed and groggy.
He held out a hand to stop John’s rush of words and give himself a moment to think.  “It’s all right, I guess,” he lied, because, really, he only cared about one thing.  “His last name
“John, what are you doing?” Sherlock asks, glancing around the corridor and keeping his voice low.  John is glad one of them still has the presence of mind to be careful, because he surely can’t seem to manage it right now.
Sherlock practically howls when John’s hand connects with the sensitive skin of his sore arse.  He struggles against John’s hold like a wild thing, squirming so much that John actually begins to have trouble holding on to him.  John gets in a few more hard hits but the sounds coming from Sherlock’s throat are so visceral, so wounded, that John stops in surprise.  His grip loosens slightly on Sherlock’s wrists but doesn’t let go, and he rests his other hand gently over one of Sherlock’s inflamed arse cheeks.
And Sherlock is.  He is gorgeous.  He is slightly smaller in size than John, but that is to be expected because of his age.  It isn’t a fair comparison, anyways, because John knows his own cock is slightly larger than average.  It’s not such a big difference that it requires bragging about, John has learned over the years, but it is enough to have been a help or a hindrance in the past, depending on the situation.  Sherlock’s cock is definitely more slender than John’s, which is thick and flares out slightly past the crown before it tapers back down past the head of his shaft.  Sherlock’s prick is a decent enough length, though, and the tip is uncut like John’s own.  The foreskin has fully retracted in Sherlock’s arousal and John can see that Sherlock is leaking copiously down along his shaft, which has flushed an angry red colour.  Sherlock is almost completely hairless down here as well, except for a small, thick thatch of dark, dark pubic hair at the base of his cock.  His balls are drawn up tight against his body already, as if he is minutes away from releasing, no matter if he gets stimulation or not.  The bones of his hips jut out alarmingly on either side of his pelvis, framing his groin peculiarly.
The ride up to meet Mary’s family in the country on Saturday morning is just as uncomfortable as John thought it would be.  He and Mary don’t speak to each other for the whole trip, and John’s mobile goes off so often with incoming text messages that he has to turn it onto vibrate.  The low buzz of it can still be heard deep in his trouser pocket, however.  Whenever he gets the chance, he checks his messages (each one always from Sherlock) and responds to as many as he can.  Mary’s sharp, narrowed eyes are constantly on him, though, so after a while he just simply gives up.
John continues to kiss and lick his way down Sherlock’s body until he reaches the straining cock.  He takes Sherlock slowly into his mouth, swirling his tongue over the glistening, wet head and tasting bitter, warm precome.  Another wave of it swells up immediately and smears across John’s tongue as he takes Sherlock’s cock deeper into his throat, barely giving him a chance to get used to the sensation.  Sherlock moans and his fingers clench in John’s short hair, and John grins around his mouthful as the tip of Sherlock’s prick nudges the back of his throat.  He swallows around it, keeping his head still.  The muscles of his throat are the only thing that moves, and Sherlock cries out and tries to buck up deeper into him.  John has to press him rather roughly into the sofa cushions so that Sherlock doesn’t end up choking him; he’s such a greedy, impatient little thing when it comes to getting his cock sucked.
So, John begins his first day of school nervous as hell about coming face to face with a child.  As each class passes by without incident and he finally looks down at the timetable for his last lesson of the day and sees that Holmes is on the list, he steels himself.  He was a soldier, for God’s sake; an Army doctor.  He has been to war, been shot.  He can certainly handle anything a teenager can throw at him.
Finally, another voice broke the silence, awkward but very welcome. “Well, you heard the man,” Lestrade said. “Go on and piss off!”
Sherlock sinks into his outstretched arms willingly enough, a pliant, gangly little thing that is all arms and legs as John tries to move them into a more comfortable positon.  He tilts his head up to kiss Sherlock softly, but their lips have barely met before the reddened bum touches down on John’s lap and Sherlock inhales a sharp gasp of pain against John’s mouth.  “Hurts,” he whimpers, not pulling away from John, wanting to stay close, connected.
At John’s words, though, Sherlock jerks awake, head snapping to attention as he sits up and looks at John with tired, red eyes.  “I don’t want a nap,” he says petulantly, a small pout marring his delicate features.
“What the bloody hell is all of this, then?” he exclaimed, when Sherlock opened the door for him and the other man walked into their flat, a sleeping Callum in tow, unconscious in the bulky baby carrier that weighed John down.
Sherlock simply rolled his sea green eyes at the blonde man.  “Please, John, even you couldn’t be that stupid,” he told the doctor, voice dark with bitterness.  “He’s not just trying to be your friend—he’s trying to get into your pants.”
“No.”  John shook his head, even though Sherlock couldn’t see him through the blackness.  “Even if I believed you did this just for the puzzle, we both know what is at stake now.  And you are not backing out.  That’s courage, Sherlock,” he said, giving the man wrapped in his arms a squeeze.  “Whatever you may think, whatever others may tell you…listen to what
At the door, Sherlock turned back around to look at the other man, giving him an incredulous look.  “This has become a game to you, Lestrade,” he told the man.  “To see how badly you can make me feel about myself while you feel vindicated that you’re the only one good enough for John.  And it’s a game that I am no longer willing to play with you.  What happens between John and I will stay between John and I, and I don’t need you snooping around, looking pathetically for a bit of sloppy seconds.”
“You are a great man.  More importantly, you’re a good one,” Sherlock is whispering in his ear, and John has to bite back a sob because it is exactly what he needs to hear right now, and he doesn’t deserve to hear it.  Not after what he just did to Sherlock.  “Brave and caring and loving.  One day I hope to be half as good as you are.”
, John manages to think before his brain decides to cease functioning for a moment.  All of his blood pools south in an instant, lighting a fire low in his belly that spreads to his groin and fills his cock with heat and desire.
Sherlock looks as though he isn’t going to say what is on his mind.  For a long moment he doesn’t speak and John leaves him alone, doesn’t pester him, because John suddenly isn’t sure that this is something he wants to hear after all.  When Sherlock finally opens his mouth, his voice is small and unsure, and he isn’t looking at John again.
But his question was cut off as Sherlock grabbed him, pushing him up against the wall of their living room and kissing him harshly.
Sherlock’s voice is nowhere near as loud or uncontrolled as John’s when he answers.  “I wanted to meet her,” Sherlock says with an unapologetic shrug of his shoulders, as if he is unconcerned.  “I wanted to meet the woman that you keep choosing over me.”
The thought alone was enough to make him want to vomit in nervousness and fear, but he spent the better part of most days trying not to think about it.
“Now I know you wouldn’t do anything like that to someone you care about,” Mike continues, voice still soft and calming.  He sounds so fucking reasonable and John hates him for it.  “So break it off and let him go, mate.  In a few months or a year you can try to find him again, if you’re still obsessed with him.  At least then you won’t be his teacher anymore.”
There is a long pause from the other end of the line, the silence stretching out into an eternity.  And then, finally, there is a soft, sad sigh and John hears,
a line any longer, knowing how Sherlock is.  Sherlock has always had a way of breaking through all of John’s barriers, tearing through all of his defences.  However, now that he has permission to punish Sherlock for being spoilt and bratty, he knows that there is no longer such a thing as “going too far” between them.  All of the lines in their relationship have become blurred, inseparable.  There is hardly a distinction now between what Sherlock wants and what John is willing to do to him.  Like this, as in all things with them, they fit together seamlessly, all of their broken edges finding snug spots against the others’.  He knows that here—with Sherlock, in this secret time that they get to spend together—nothing is off the table, no matter how guilty or dirty it might make him feel.
“So, have you ever been able to?” John asks quietly, fidgeting uncomfortably on the bed.  Sherlock doesn’t blame him for being uncomfortable—they are both naked after all, and mid-coitus.  He assumes this would be a very embarrassing position for anyone to be in.
John hunkered into himself and fought his way through the back end of the extremely large crowd that was gathering around the front of the doctor’s offices.  The crowd was split up on either side of the walkway that led to the front doors, and John could see police officers already patrolling the sidewalk, making sure that the anti-Synaths were not being too disruptive.  John had almost made it to the front lines of the crowd when three cop cars suddenly pulled up, lights flashing but sirens off.
Mary enjoys the day immensely, he can tell, and they have a good time together.  Conversation is halted and uneasy, but at least it doesn’t dissolve into a row at any point.  And even though she never says anything directly, John can tell that she is grateful to him for the attention he is paying her, for the day he has devoted to her.  When they get home she kisses him—once, lightly—on the lips, before wrapping her arms around him in a
” This time John shouted, not caring who heard him. Most of the people around the crime scene had already been inching their way closer, intrigued—as usual—by the running commentary Sherlock always provided at crime scenes.
“Mrs. Hudson,” John cut her off, smiling at her softly.  “Do you mind giving us a few minutes?  I’d like for us to talk over some things for a bit.”
He looks at John with something like fear in his eyes, as if he is afraid of what John will think of him, now that he’s told John this.  “It’s only fair of you to know that before you make any decisions.  None of what you see in me is real.  I pretend at being human.  I may have moments where my emotions come through, but more often than not I just lock them away, because I can’t be bothered to feel them,” he says with a shake of his head.  “I stay awake for an unhealthy amount of days, I refuse my body sustenance until I finally crash and break down, because it’s all just
But those things melted away as John opened up to the kiss, relief and happiness flooding him and washing away all of the things in the past.  The fight and the harsh words and the fear.
“Here, let me,” Sherlock says softly, lifting his large hands to nimbly slip buttons through holes and undo John’s flies, helping the man out of his clothes as John presses uncoordinated kisses to his mouth and jaw the whole time, hindering Sherlock’s progress more than helping.
John holds back a sigh.  He knows getting frustrated with Sherlock won’t accomplish anything, but he wishes that Sherlock wouldn’t do this—the younger man is clearly upset, and if he would just let John help him through it, help him deal with the emotions he is no doubt having trouble processing, things would be so much easier.  “It’s not ‘nothing’,” John states gently.  “Tell me what’s wrong.”
, Sherlock,” John tells him, cupping his face as he lies on top of him with their naked bodies pressed against each other, and kisses him.  “Nothing else.  Just
This catches Sherlock’s attention once again.  He stops writing and looks up at John, frowning.  “Teach me?” he asks, as if he doesn’t understand what John is saying.
John laughs, because at least Sherlock hasn’t slammed the door in his face or started throwing anything at him yet, so he figures they are probably okay.  “Yeah, it is,” John says with a cheeky grin.  “What?  Not good?”
“How about Holmes Watson?” Sherlock gave in with a sigh, when he realized that he had startled John.
And the next day, when he tried to apologize to John for dealing with the situation so poorly, he had also confessed that it wasn’t just the fear that unnerved him.  It was the doubt.
He curses Sherlock Holmes once more and waddles up the stairs carefully, trying not to jar anymore yeast loose now that he is inside his home.
John’s mouth goes dry as he sits there and looks at the sight before him.  When Sherlock has licked the come off of his thumb, he slides it out of his mouth only slightly, no longer sucking it but letting the tip sit on his full bottom lip, a tease that is driving John insane with arousal.
Sherlock makes a strange keening noise that might have been an answer if John hadn’t taken that moment to slip a third finger into him.  The muscle is still tight, but it is slightly more pliable that he thought it would be from being stretched out once already.  John will have to remember how easy a second fuck is in the future.
He comes over his hand, feeling it dribble warmly down his fist, squeezing tightly on the shaft and not moving for fear of over-stimulating himself.  With his eyes closed he can’t see John, but he can feel the man pulling away from him, kneeling down on the floor in front of him and bending over, taking the swollen, come covered head of Sherlock’s cock in his mouth gently.
After a few days of constant, nonstop, almost teenage-like sex, John did seem to get a little suspicious.  Whenever Sherlock allowed him up for air, the blonde man seemed to recall that they hadn’t shagged so tirelessly in years—since they had first gotten together and had not been able to keep their hands off of one another—but before he could dwell any more on it, Sherlock would pull him back down into their bed, intent on making John forget how to even formulate a sentence.
It takes a little while, but Bill finally ends up saying that he should head home, clapping John one last time on the back and telling him that they should get together again sometime.  John makes some sort of noncommittal comment that they both know is a lie and Bill saunters away from their table, leaving them alone at last.
“It…I…” he says, but before he can get another word out, he is coming, gasping out a shout and streaking his bear with pearly, milky white come.
“That doesn’t make it any better, Sherlock,” John says with a long suffering sigh.  “Come on, let’s get you patched up.  Do you know: I’ve had to restock my first aid kit twice since I’ve started having coffee with you?  I’m going to have to buy cold packs in bulk.”  He leads Sherlock out of the coffee shop yet another time and towards the boot of his car where he props his cane up and starts the ritual of taking everything he needs out of the kit.  It’s all so familiar now that Sherlock simply stands there and waits patiently to be cleaned up.
“Isn’t the answer simple, John?” he asked, frowning slightly.  “We’ll rebuild Baker Street, of course.”
Once John had squeezed some lube onto his fingers, he knelt down in between Sherlock’s legs, trailing kisses along the man’s pale, soft thighs and across his pubic bone.  Sherlock squirmed against his mouth, clearly enjoying the sensation and John finally gave in to him, taking the tip of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth as he brought his fingers over to caress Sherlock’s tightly furled hole.
Sherlock releases a shaky breath and then nods, biting his lip.  He moves to turn over on the bed slowly, as if he is still unsure, but John stops him.  The blond leans down and gives him a soft, tender kiss, full of apology and regret.  He can feel Sherlock relax a little bit, opening up to him and returning his kiss, letting John lick into his mouth and taste him, biting at his lips when John turns the kiss into something a bit deeper, more urgent.  John’s hands trail down Sherlock’s neck, over nipples that have pebbled into hard peaks once again and down across his belly, a bit softer now than when John first met him, though not much.  John’s fingers dance lightly over Sherlock’s cock, stirring to life once again, and dip down to rub along his bollocks, soft and full from his earlier arousal.  Sherlock moans at the gentle pressure and John lets his fingertip press into his perineum, dragging along the sensitive skin as he nips once more at Sherlock’s lips before pulling away from him entirely.
She thinks she’s so clever but John knows better.  “Because you clearly can’t keep away from him!” he states, his voice booming in the still of their house.
One journal is thrown in such a way that by simple luck it hits John’s bad shoulder spine-corner first.  “Ow, Sherlock,
Sherlock’s curly head is still resting heavily on John’s hip and his bright eyes glance up at John’s face, a smile gracing his full lips.  “Thanking you for reading to me,” Sherlock answers simply, as if it is obvious.  “Don’t stop.”
“I know it’s nothing like you’re used to,” Mike tells him, clamping his hand down around John’s shoulder in a reassuring manner before letting the smaller man go, “but this is a nice, quiet town and I think you’ll actually enjoy working with the kids.”
The detective inspector made his way through the group, and when he reached John and Sherlock he handed the brunette man a small gift, wrapped beautifully in silver and white paper.
“We’ll fight, Sherlock,” John states, rather matter-of-factly, hugging his lover tightly.  “We’ll yell at one another, and say things to one another, and sometimes feel like we hate each other.  That’s normal.  And making up after all that is normal, too.  If everyone just walked away from everything they cared about when things got difficult then there wouldn’t be anything worth living for, in my opinion.”
John is afraid to ask for details and Sherlock doesn’t seem too keen on telling him, so it just gets left alone.
He only has the patience to stretch him for a moment more before he can’t take it any longer and he gently pulls his fingers from the boy.  Sherlock pants and trembles below him as he re-lubes his hand to slick his cock up, and then he moves into position behind Sherlock, watching him.  Sherlock’s face is still turned so that John can see him and the man looks, takes in every detail of his lover’s expression as he places the head of his cock to Sherlock’s prepped hole.  He presses forward gently and lets the crown slide in, the tightness of it pushing his foreskin back.  Sherlock bites his lips at the feel of John entering him, but the man can tell it isn’t wholly uncomfortable until past the head of John’s cock, when Sherlock winces and closes his eyes, his lip turning white from the pressure of his teeth.  John runs a soothing hand up and down his back, stilling and letting him grow accustomed to the stretch of it, waiting until Sherlock opens his eyes again and looks back at him before continuing.
They sat there for a moment longer, in a silence that was slightly less uncomfortable, before Greg spoke up again.  “I’m sorry,” he said, shaking his head.  “I’ve been a twat.  You guys didn’t…” he trailed off and sighed, running his fingers through his short salt and pepper hair.  “Are you going to be okay?” he asked finally.
His brain suddenly snapped back into focus and he realized with a jolt that Lestrade was kissing him, rather gentlemanly and chastely, but still—it was a kiss from someone who was not Sherlock.
“But you do make everything better, John, you do make all the noise go away.” Sherlock is whispering into John’s chest, his voice cracking as he rubs his face across the man’s shirt.  “You make it all stop.  Every time I’m with you.  Every time you hold me.  And I need you to continue to do that.  That’s why I came back to you,” Sherlock tells him, voice full of conviction.  “The drugs don’t make it feel like you do.  Please don’t leave me.  I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.  It was stupid, and I was an idiot, and it wasn’t worth it if I lose you,” he is clinging to John desperately, the trembling growing worse now, his hands shaking where they are clutching onto John’s shirt, so badly that he can barely even tighten his fingers.
John glares at him angrily from across the sitting room, his frown deepening the lines on his face as he stares at Sherlock.
It shouldn’t be like this between them, he knows.  John should be the one Sherlock runs to, not the one Sherlock tries to hide himself from.  John wants to be the one that makes everything better for Sherlock, the one who takes away all of the pain, no matter how Sherlock needs that to be done.  If he needs a spanking, or a rough hand during sex, or if he just wants to call John “Daddy” and be pampered for the day, then it’s all fine.  It will always be fine.  Even if all Sherlock wants is for John to hold him close while he tells John about how he is feeling.  John will do all of that.  Gladly.
Sherlock had frowned down at the violin in his hands, not looking at John, as if it had been the instrument who had asked such probing questions and not the man.  He had answered, though, despite his voice sounding small and cracked.  “When my mother left.  She was the one who taught me, she was the one who loved it.  My father hated it.  He didn’t like hearing it.  It reminded him of her.  After he started drinking, there was no way I was going to play it when he was in the house.  And then even when he would leave to go to the pub…what was the point of playing it?”
Sherlock whines lowly at the sensation and clenches his arse around John once, harshly, and that is it; John is lost, John is falling but doesn’t know it because it feels just like flying, like soaring, like burning up in the sun.  His orgasm lights through him like gunpowder being ignited, like a fuse being lit, and he is on fire.  He comes inside of Sherlock, pushing deeply into the boy’s body so that he is sheathed in warmth as his cock pulses out spurt after spurt, and Sherlock moans softly at the sensation of being filled.
John wonders how long Sherlock has been in his headspace.  He had sent Sherlock the text about his schedule in the morning.  Surely not since then…
Mycroft notices his younger brother’s display and lets his gaze linger over John and Sherlock.  What he sees between them, John doesn’t know, but it makes the edges of Mycroft’s thin lips tighten and causes a small frown to wrinkle his brow.
John smiles down at him softly, lovingly.  He wants to kiss every inch of Sherlock, spread his legs wide open and put his mouth to the most intimate part of him.  He knows that they have just only recently tried rimming and it had seemed like such an intense act for Sherlock, but John can’t help it.  He wants to do it again.  He wants to open Sherlock up with his lips and his tongue, make Sherlock mad with desire until he is spreading his legs as wide as they will go and tilting his hips towards John’s mouth.  He wants to tease Sherlock’s perineum, lick at the soft expanse of skin, part Sherlock’s bollocks with his tongue and his lips until he slowly mouths his way over to Sherlock’s tight hole, opening it up leisurely under his diligent care.  He wants to eat Sherlock’s arse until Sherlock doesn’t know how to beg for anything else besides John’s mouth and John’s fingers and John’s cock.
“Outside,” Sherlock said simply.  “On the sidewalk.”  He seemed incapable of saying more than a few simple words.
waits until the pub closes down and he can’t find a friend to put him up for another night before stumbling back home.”  Sherlock reaches him and falls down to sit on the bed beside John, close, their sides touching from their shoulders all the way down to their knees as they sit next to each other.  John can’t help but think that Sherlock looks very young in his short-sleeved graphic t-shirt, the logo on the front so faded that John can barely see it, and worn-out jeans which Sherlock seems endearingly comfortable in.  “He never leaves a drinking establishment during business hours, and since you can’t stay the night because of your wife, this is perfect for us.”
“So he really did it?  Bought the whole bloody building?” Greg asked John a few days later as the two men left the small, quiet restaurant together.
All he had to do was say no.  It was simple.  One little word.  Two letters.  It could be whispered, breathed, mouthed, and he knew that Greg would stop, that Greg wouldn’t push him, wouldn’t make him do anything that he didn’t want to.  But the word wouldn’t come out.  It stuck in his throat, and refused to be pushed up to his mouth, didn’t get anywhere near his lips.
Sherlock didn’t even have to say another word. In an instant, John was closing the distance between the two men quickly, his stride purposeful and deadly.
John could do nothing but sigh tiredly and follow behind them, cursing ever coming up with the idea to go shopping in the first place.
Behind him, Sherlock heard the quiet sounds of his brother’s secretary drifting off, leaving the two men alone.
!” Sherlock’s question gets cut off as John licks over the soft opening of his body, shuddering violently.  John can see his long fingers clench and tangle in his sheets, shoulders going tight and tense at the strange sensation.
They only linger in this room for a moment, though, before Sherlock is pulling John along out another door and down a different hallway, this one leading to a room that John instantly knows belongs to the teen.
For once, luck is on his side.  Mike just snatches a few more of his chips and doesn’t say anything else on the subject.  “So how long ago did you take the pill?” he asks John through a mouthful of food.
“They say many things, John, most of which aren’t worth the effort required to speak them,” Sherlock answers back without missing a beat, his clear eyes unwaveringly on John’s.
He finally settles on the word “more”, because that’s all he can think of to describe them.  It is the first time that they will meet as
John sighs and sits up, knowing that once Sherlock has gotten that look in his eyes, he is gearing up for a discussion that will eventually turn into a row because Sherlock wants something that John is not willing to give him.
He knows Sherlock will never hurt John more than the smaller man can take, but he still can’t help the words that come out of his mouth, dark and threatening as he rubs soothing fingers over his husband’s abused skin.
John sighs and his mouth tightens as he tries to bite back harsh words.  He hates how immature Sherlock can act sometimes, how childish he gets.
He what?  He liked him, too?  He wanted someone other than Sherlock to be everything that he needed?  He wanted the man to keep kissing him?
“John, it was years ago when I couldn’t afford to live here by myself,” he answered with a flippant wave of his gloved hand.  “Then I hired a live in P.A who forced all of my clients to start paying me for my services.  Thank you for that, by the way.”
John frowns in confusion.  “What for, baby?” he asks.  John won’t tell him no, if that’s what Sherlock wants—Sherlock shouldn’t be afraid to ask for anything he wants, no matter how silly or meaningless he thinks it might be—he just wants to know why Sherlock would rather be in their sitting room than in their bed.
“My dog tags,” John finishes for him, mostly because he wants to cover up the awkward silence that is descending thickly between them.  “Yeah.”
Beside him, John let out a sigh of relief that was cut off in a strangled sound as Sherlock turned around and hugged him suddenly, hard.  Around them, people smiled happily at Sherlock’s uncommon show of human emotion and John had to remind the brunette man to thank everyone else who had helped with the gift.
John moves away from Sherlock slightly, sitting back to give himself the space he needs, and he sucks a finger into his mouth, slicking it liberally with spit.  “All right,” he says as he pulls his finger out of his mouth.  He licks his lips and he tries not to notice the small tremor in his voice.  “All right, I’m going to touch you there now.”
At that, Sherlock wiggles out of John’s arms, squirming about in the bed as he tries to pull the bedsheets around himself comfortably and fluff his pillow precisely.  When everything is arranged how the mad genius wants it, he lies back on the mattress and says imploringly, “John, tuck me in for bed.”
who is the one who cheats, but that’s unlikely.  The head teacher is a very well-endowed, attractive woman and you never once let your eyes drop any lower than her face, even though she was clearly flirting with you.”  He frowns at John, as if he is judging the man and finds him lacking.  “It shows that you still have some sort of commitment to your wife.  Besides, I would assume that being stuck with a disabled veteran who has lost any future prospects in a prestigious medical career and can’t even sleep through the night isn’t exactly the life that your wife saw for herself when she married you.  So, chances are good that it is
“Mmm, yes.  Friend of mine.”  Sherlock’s tone is disturbingly casual as he goes about continuing to poke at the petri dish, as if his answer explains everything.  He doesn’t even bother to spare John a glance when he speaks to him.  “Well,” he rectifies, “I say ‘friend’…”
Sherlock moans against his mouth and John can’t help the involuntary thrust his hips give at the sound, the erection still trapped behind his trousers digging into Sherlock’s naked thigh.  God, his prick is so hard that it actually hurts.  He lets go of Sherlock’s cock only long enough to divest himself of his clothes, kneeling over the boy’s body on top of the bed as Sherlock tries to help him undress with fumbling, uncoordinated hands.
It is by far the biggest, the worst, of all of his scars.  It is newer, too.  Still an ugly, fleshy pink colour against his tanned skin.  The entry wound on his back is smaller than the exit wound on the front of his shoulder above his chest, where the bullet had torn through layers of muscle and tendon and bone and skin as it sliced through his body and exploded out of him.  It hadn’t helped that his platoon’s ambush had gone terribly, horribly wrong and he had been the only medical officer left alive, with assistance a long time in coming—if it came at all.  Without knowing if he was going to get medical attention, he had treated the wound himself as much as he could.  His non-dominant hand had worked over his own torn flesh shakily as he lay in the middle of a dirt street in a sandy desert town.  Because of this, the scar is much worse than it should be: infection had set in, working its way through his body with deadly intent.  Evidence of just how badly the wound had been infected will forever last in the mother-of-pearl striations of healed flesh that crawl outwards from the scar, like cobwebs creeping across John’s shoulder and down his chest.
John stood there for a moment, funny little hard hat sitting uncomfortably on his head as he watched Sherlock go about his modifications.  “So this…trust fund…” he said slowly, stepping out of the way of one of the constructions workers as the man carried a heavy looking power tool across the bare floor.  “It’s enough to buy an entire building?  And still leave enough to—?”
“Yes,” she says to him offhandedly, raising an eyebrow in mocking amusement and giving him a look out of the corner of her eye that is slightly judgmental.  “I know.”
It takes Greg a moment to comprehend the situation, because at first he doesn’t see John sitting naked in his chair, the doctor has gone so still and quiet.  Greg’s eyes fall on Sherlock first, but the dark smirk on the consulting detective’s lips must give something away, because John sees Greg’s gaze immediately dart over to him.  At the deep, penetrating look Greg gives him, John blushes ferociously and has to force himself to maintain eye contact with his husband.
At this Sherlock couldn’t help but bristle, upset that John always tended to brush off issues with what was quickly becoming a fall back excuse.  “No, John,” he said angrily.  “This has nothing to do with hormones or cramps or backaches.  This has to do with you and Lestrade, plain and simple.”
John smiles softly at the back of the curly head, even though he knows Sherlock can’t see him.  “I know, love,” he says, and his hands rub along Sherlock’s lower back, trying to calm him.  “It takes some getting used to.  That’s why we’re going slow,” he assures his lover.  He refrains from telling Sherlock that the feeling is only going to get stranger.  Lubricant will help things along tremendously, he knows.  He leans over to the drawer of his bedside table to scrounge around for the small bottle he keeps in there, its contents significantly diminished since starting his relationship with his student.
It seemed that the hormones which had proven themselves to be a nightmare at the beginning of his pregnancy had once again resurfaced as the culprits in what was steadily becoming an increasingly nerve-wracking case of clumsiness and forgetfulness.  The hormones worked to loosen his joints and ligaments, John took care to explain to him on multiple occasions, so that his growing appendix and abdomen would not be so painful to deal with, and he warned that Sherlock’s shifted center of gravity from the added weight and the beach ball he was carrying in front of him were more likely to cause a trip, slip or fall than usual.
In the soft light of the lamp, John turns back to look down at Sherlock now sleeping deeply in the bed.  The sheets are a tangled mess around him from his earlier struggling, and his mouth is hanging open widely.  John knows he will end up drooling all over himself in a few minutes, but he thinks that Sherlock looks too adorable to try to help remedy the problem.  John bends down over him and tugs the sheet out from under the dead weight of the sleeping brunet, taking the end of it and tucking Sherlock in securely.  It is a small journey from there to kissing him on the forehead, and John can’t resist the temptation.  His lips linger on Sherlock’s cool skin for a moment, breathing in against Sherlock’s hair.  His face scrunches slightly and he makes a mental note to get Sherlock in the shower after he wakes up.
After he pumps the last of Sherlock’s orgasm out of the boy, John collapses back onto the bed, panting and rolling over onto his back, away from the scorching heat of Sherlock’s body.  With his clean hand, he rucks his sleep shirt up his stomach and under his armpits so that the sweat will dry and he can try to cool off.  Then he reaches out to find Sherlock and drag the teen over to his side of the bed, holding him close.
Over the next few days, John was distracted and on edge.  He snapped at Lestrade for no reason and felt horrible afterwards.  After all, the detective was being much more gracious than John would have expected, letting the blonde doctor bunk on his couch for what could possibly be an eternity.
He needs a shower.  He needs to wash off the evidence of tonight, clean himself up, wipe it all away.
His thought got cut off as the doors to the police cars opened, and the crowd around him began to yell and shove harder, pushing itself around the men who were being escorted by the police officers out of the cars.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says, holding out his hand for the magazine that John is gripping tightly in his irritation.  “The skull doesn’t annoy me half as much as you do.”
“So then did you have better luck making friends when you were younger than you do making them now?” John wants to know, curious.
“Yes,” Sherlock bit out, teeth clenched against the onslaught of sensation John was pouring over him.  “Yes, I’m—”
like I’m tired of having this conversation with you, Sherlock,” he answers the boy’s question, rhetorical as it may have been.  John turns away from him and continues his search for his keys, digging through a pile of books that sit of the floor now, wondering where in the bloody hell they could have possibly gotten to.  He had them in his trousers earlier when Sherlock had pulled them off of him, and he was sure that he saw Sherlock toss his clothing in this direction.  “You know that I can’t stay, yet every time I leave you act like it’s something new.”
Which would have been fine, but John thought that the insurance company would be the one’s handling all of that, not their personal attorney.
John understands why the allure of this game is so strong for Sherlock.  The brunet never really got a childhood, after all; he never got to be a kid, to be taken care of.  Even when Sherlock was a child he was forced to be an adult, and he likes that he can let go with John, quiet his mind and not
He eventually manages to squeeze a third finger into the tightly stretched hole, watching in wonder as Sherlock’s arse clenches and grips around him.  He’s never seen anything more mesmerising than the teen’s body taking him in, and he realises that his breaths are coming in harsh pants just like Sherlock’s below him.  He feels like he can do this forever, like John will never get enough of watching him.  He could come just from this, just from fingering Sherlock.  He could probably milk the boy for hours, make Sherlock so out of his mind that he—
“It’s just that,” John tries, and Sherlock knows that he is struggling to find the right words, “it seems like you’ve been getting off on it more than other times we do stuff.”
?!” John yells, trying to move away from the boy even though it won’t help at this point.  He looks down at his wet, stained shirt and trousers in astonishment.  “What the hell’s gotten into you?” he asks, voice loud and furious.
Sherlock smirks at him as he exits John’s house, turning around on John’s front step to grace him with one last devilish look.  “I look forward to it, Mr. Watson.”
“You told me not to text you again and I listened,” Sherlock explains, his gaze imploring, and John can hear a slight tremble in his deep voice, as if he is scared.  “And when I texted you today it was only because you told me to.  I can listen to you, John.  I can do the things that you tell me to do.”
John stares at his friend in amazement.  “‘Go back to her’?” he repeats, at a loss.  “No.  I can’t do that.  I don’t love Mary anymore.  It’s over with her.  It’s been over for a long time.”
He smiled down at John, walking beside him. The doctor was panting slightly, since he was carrying all of Sherlock’s bags and trying to keep up with the brunette’s larger stride. His stomach grumbled hungrily and he had a sudden craving for the kinds of things he knew they would not sell at a vegan restaurant. It was okay, though. He knew John would cave to his cravings after lunch.
John chuckles at Sherlock’s impatience.  “And I told you that we were going to take this slowly.  There are already enough things that can go wrong with this relationship, what with me being married, you being my student, and only sixteen and all of that.  I don’t want to rush into something and regret it later, or end up hurting you.”
found someone,” Sherlock tells him with a smirk, as if remembering how good it felt to know that he had gotten one over on his brother in such a way.  “An older woman named Martha Hudson.  Her husband was the leader of a drug cartel and she had gotten in a bad way with some of his product.  Actually, to be more accurate, he used her to test out new shipments.  He kept her strung out most of the time.”
“Did they warn you about me?” the student asks him quite suddenly, the question seemingly coming out of nowhere.  The young teen’s voice is deep and settled already, for someone who looks so young.
He doesn’t know where to start, but he figures apologising for the mess he has made is as good a place as any.
“I don’t care what you think,” John told him angrily, scowling at his friend.  “All I know is that every time someone says that they are having some sort of problem and then I sleep with them, the problem mysteriously resolves itself.”  He pointed a finger towards his crotch with a smug smile.  “Magic,” he said imperiously.
“You do, don’t you?  You gorgeous, amazing thing.  Do you like this, like being full of me?” John asks him.
“I am letting you and your beau,” Mycroft gave a sidelong sneer towards John, “stay at my home because you have nowhere else to go,” he chastised Sherlock one evening over dinner for yet another mess in his mudroom, where Sherlock had come inside after slaughtering a crate full of chickens to document the blood splatter pattern on a line of trees outside.  “But I would ask that you treat it with a little respect, Sherlock.”
If Dr. Greenwhich noticed the condescension, he let it pass.  “Well, if you’ve been implanted by your partner’s sperm, the ball of cells that is the beginning stages of the fetus—called a blastocyst during these early weeks—will take up residence in your appendix, which will be acting—for all intents and purposes—in place of a uterus.”
Sherlock does as he is told and begins stroking himself—slow, lazy sweeps that drive John crazy to watch.  Sherlock likes to pinch the head of his cock between his thumb and index finger on every upstroke, and the movement squeezes beads of precome out of his slit.  He swipes his fingers through the fluid to wet them before stroking back down his length, slicking himself along the way.
John comes again, a pitiful amount of ejaculate spurting out between them in something that could almost be considered a dry orgasm.  He knows it is only because of the pill still working its way through his system that he is even able to come again at all.  Sherlock probably has his youth going for him, a teenage refractory period and libido that is close to insatiable at this point in his adolescence.  John thinks they must be close to quelling it, though, with as much sex as they have had in the past few days.  When Sherlock comes, it is with a cry that is almost pained, and a slight grimace that John kisses away slowly.  He presses his lips to the wrinkle of Sherlock’s forehead, the corners of each of his eyes, the edges of his pinched mouth, until Sherlock’s face is soft and relaxed once again.
“Hand me that Erlenmeyer flask over by the window sill, would you?” Sherlock cuts him off, his back to John as he heads over to his microscope again, for all intents and purposes ignoring John.
As his eyes met John’s, the midnight blue eyes sparkled reassuringly, as if promising that John would catch him.
Sherlock and John investigate in the club, and if John had any concern about the outcome of the evening, it's nothing
He, Sherlock Holmes, had just made a fool of himself. Because of some appealing chemical reaction. He had been weak, letting his guard down, foolishly engaging in something he had never known, and then, assuming for a mere moment that his friend hadn't regretted it, he had even entertained the possibility of pursuing this new dynamic further. He was such a fool. ‘
Sherlock's body quivered slightly, his heart pounding in his chest at the sweet sensation of John marking him with saliva and the light pressure of lips and sealing his promise with a kiss.
Of course, life didn't let him enjoy their snuggle, as no matter how much he fought against it, his full bladder made itself known with unbearable intensity. Cautiously and reluctantly, he disentangled himself from the soundly sleeping doctor. Tossing the melted ice-pack from his ankle aside, he watched John's peaceful expression for any sign of waking. But John didn't notice his bedfellow leaving, just nuzzled his face into Sherlock's pillow and carried on sleeping contently.
But instead of frowning, John only smiled—the softest, purest smile ever—locking his eyes with Sherlock’s. “That's exactly what I needed to hear to do whatever I can to stay safe and come back... to you,” he breathed, touching the detective’s face. “I love you too, Sherlock.”
Unpacking the groceries, John couldn't help but noticing the immaculate kitchen-table. No experiments today, yay, he noted. But the discovery also meant that it was very unlikely that Sherlock ate anything that day. Nothing new, John sighed.
“Thank you.” These were the first words that had left Sherlock's lips since the forest. His tired, washed-out blue eyes glanced at John, his lips curving into a tiny, barely noticeable smile.
“You're sure?” Sherlock muttered mischievously, before his lips met John's in a teasing, brief, feathery caress.
“I really enjoyed the evening.” John stared into Sherlock's sparkling blue eyes, standing outside of the front door of 221B. He had had numerous dates in the past, but none of those filled his stomach with as many butterflies as this one with Sherlock. He didn't want to mess it up, especially since his partner wasn't experienced in romance. “In a romantic movie, this would be the point when the guy invites the girl in for a drink,” John muttered suggestively. Sherlock just stared at him, apparently not catching his drift. John sighed, an amused smile playing in the corner of his mouth. “Would you?”
The lovely scent of pine and mouthwatering smell of scrumptious Italian food in the air, holly-decorated candles flickering on the tables, the restaurant was a perfect setting for a holiday dine-out. Sitting at their usual table, Sherlock gazed at John's firelight-caressed face with a languid, content smile as he listened to his companion's animated storytelling of a treasured Christmas childhood memory.
“Thank you.” John gave him an honest, loving smile, before standing on tiptoes and pulling Sherlock into a gentle kiss.
A warm smile appeared on John's face. "See, you have feelings for me. You're not that emotionless as you think you are." He sneaked his hand into Sherlock's, intertwining their fingers.
“Thank you for the important information,” Sherlock noted wryly, a half-amused smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
While nibbling and sucking on John's lips and skin, Sherlock's hands were roaming all over the ex-soldier's body, rubbing and squeezing the exposed flesh. Some regions earned his multiplied attention, having noticed that those parts were particularly sensitive to his touch. John's breathing took a roller-coaster ride, rising and falling, depending on which area Sherlock's fingers, mouth and tongue were pleasing.
“No,” Sherlock interjected before John could finish the sentence. “I didn’t sleep with her. She would have been amenable, but… no, I wasn’t interested.”
“The flat's clean...” he noted low-key. Perplexed, he tentatively sank down onto the edge of the bed. When John didn't reply, he continued. “Does it upset you this much because it was me who you were with in that recording?” The question was so unexpected that the doctor's rhythmic breathing stopped. “I am a man, not a woman... furthermore, being involved with me is not very flattering...”

“I'm sure, he did,” John noted sarcastically. He wasn’t keen on continuing this exchange. “Now, sleep a bit.” He patted the Sherlock's duvet-covered leg lightly. “You need rest. I’ll check on you in an hour.” He was already about to leave, when he heard the detective murmuring something under his breath. “Hmm?” John turned his head and looked back at Sherlock over his shoulder.
“I have never thought that there could be anything or anyone else beside the Work that would take control over me and be that important,” Sherlock spoke fiercely with bright eyes. “But—and listen carefully, because I
"You are my friend, so you definitely like me. You're also amazed by me according to the frequent use of words 'brilliant', 'fantastic' and 'amazing'." He was circling him while speaking. "As for the physical attraction, you like me wearing that purple shirt, I can tell from the stolen glances that you give me when you think I can't see you. Occasionally, you watch me while I'm lying on the couch with eyes closed, and with your ordinary brain - no offence - I doubt you're reading me there. You haven't had a date for weeks, so unless you wanked in the shower, you haven't had release for a while."
Sherlock swallowed hard. “Last time we were inebriated, so it didn't really matter, but now that we're both sober, and there's a chance that you might be disappointed in me, I must tell you that...“ He bit his lip. “I have never had sex before we...”
“I am,” John stated in a hoarse voice, trying to do his best to disregard the detective's flirtatious attitude.
Sherlock took the stairs by two, his long limbs moving fast and catlike.  Pausing at the doctor's bedroom-door, he knocked lightly. Getting no response, he entered the room. Once his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw John, still fully clothed, lying on the bed with his back toward the door. Hesitating whether to sit down and touch him, Sherlock's scrutinizing look searched for the tiniest sign to confirm that his blogger was sleeping.
John bit his lip, his eyes welling up at the memory. He missed James Sholto, his best friend in the army.
“You want to convince yourself of that? Try harder,” Sherlock countered with a brittle smile. “You aren’t worried that I don’t want this, you are scared that I do. You don't believe you could be an equal partner to me. You doubt that I could ever feel something for you.” His gaze never left the doctor's. “But you are so wrong.”
“Actually, I've already got used to you behaving oddly and having different views than normal people do, so it's not really you I'm angry with. No, before you misinterpret what I'm saying, I'm annoyed by your indifference to the issue indeed. I don't even dare to think of what could have happened if it had not been me who entered, but Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade or even worse  the inspector suddenly felt like raiding our flat accompanied by Donovan and Anderson...God, I'd have died in embarrassment..”
?” John prompted with narrow eyes. “You don't know what love means. You don't understand the concept of a relationship; you're ignorant and oblivious to what being involved with someone really means and requires. You’ve only just seemed to get around to accepting me as your friend. So while I'm flattered by your idea, I don't think that's what you really want.”
“Sherlock, this is really childish!” John threw the paper onto the coffee table eventually, having enough of the screeching concerto. “We should talk!”
Once Barnaby stopped the car, John jumped out and immediately rushed to his boyfriend's side. He found Sherlock curled up into a ball, leaning halfway against the tree--trying to save as much heat as possible, shivering heavily. John’s heart sank at the sight.
Exchanging little, noisy kisses, they stumbled through the kitchen, bumping into the furniture every once in a while.
“I'm such an idiot!” Sherlock growled loudly in utter frustration, and he grabbed his mug on the little side table and tossed it vehemently against the kitchen's door frame. The ceramic broke with a loud crash, the tiny shards flying around, the Earl Grey tea splashing against the frame, painting dark shapes on the green wallpaper.
“On the other hand,” he continued, “we both know that you’re not interested in romance, don’t do feelings. So while for other people the ‘friends with benefits’ situation could be a go, for me…” John sighed sadly. “Having these feelings, while you don’t… I don’t think I could do that. I don't want to be just another substitute for drugs or cigarettes, a convenient distraction.”
John swallowed hard and shifted as Sherlock moved closer, shortening their distance. The detective's body so dangerously close and the scent of his cologne lingering around him, John's breath became heavier. He must be enjoying this game, John thought, licking his lips instinctively, the bloody bastard.
“When two friends add sex to their relationship without romantic feelings, that's what people call 'friends with benefits',” John explained, watching the gears turning in Sherlock’s head, the long eyelashes fluttering in the process.
John expected Sherlock to acknowledge his reasoning with a single nod and suggesting forgetting last night and go back to where they had been before, then leaping out of his chair to stride into the kitchen to check on his current undergoing experiment. He was already preparing to feel sorry for himself for feeling miserable, when Sherlock’s quiet baritone broke the silence.
It was flattering and reassuring to know that John was so protective of him. No one had ever related to him with such vehemence and confidence. Not even his family. He squeezed the hand in his, the sensation of the soft, warm skin promising safety, stability and utmost trust. That sweet touch meant home. As long as John was by his side, Sherlock Holmes was no longer a stray, lost dog, looking for someone that would take him in and, instead of kicking him, give him a few kind words. He had found someone at whose side he could be a man, an appreciated human being. John had saved him and provided him a real purpose to live for.
"It has taken me some time to realize and come to terms with that though," he went on, bolder with every word. "I haven't intent to let you know though as you told me once that you were married to your work. Now, however, I'd curse myself for missing the chance to have you if only for a night, I'd rather let it slip away than acting afterwards as if nothing happened and lead the life we used to. Furthermore, your offer concerns a mere intercourse without emotions involved, which I can't accept. I don't want your body only; if we ever had sex, that should happen because you also have feelings for me."
“Oh, Sherlock...” He sighed and pulled the detective into a loving embrace. “There are so many layers of being a feeling and loving human being that you must learn yet.“
John's fingers fumbling with the button of his trousers, Sherlock inhaled sharply and instinctively thrust his hips against the sturdy hand. John's palm enveloped his bulge and rubbed teasingly. Sherlock whimpered loudly. Grabbing the counter for support, he discarded his trousers and underwear impatiently, accidentally knocking off a large bowl. The glassware landed on the floor with a loud shatter.
His prayers had definitely been answered last night; even more, he had apparently received more than that he had wished for. A lot more.
“You want me to say it out loud? Well, okay. You experimented on me last night! That’s all it was, right? Just one of your fucking games.”
“You don't want to,” John concluded. “Fine. But I do.” He took a breath. “Last night...” Sherlock tensed at the words. “I don't know what to make of it.”
“Not more than I want you,” the detective drawled, leaning down, and brushed his thirsty lips against John's. “Let me take the lead this time,” he whispered into the soft kiss.
The effect of the fast-acting painkillers had already started to kick in, but the pain behind his eyelids was still too much present to dwell further on the night before.
“I used to pretend to have no heart, detached myself from emotions that could have hindered my focus on my work, but...” Sherlock nervously ran a hand through his hair. “Since you came, I am not the person I used to be. Day by day, I had to realize that—when it comes to you—I can't keep ignoring forever the fact that, by default, I'm a human being with feelings. You are changing me. I try to shut out the world of emotions, but when it's about you, I can't anymore. Which is ridiculous, because you are just an ordinary man wasting the capacity of his mind, constantly caring about others' opinions, yet it seems I just can't withdraw myself from your power...”
Sherlock's 'your feet not reaching the pedal' comment is a nod to my old fave show "The X-Files"  where Mulder said it to Scully in one episode. Another OTP of mine. Oh, those old times. :)
“You bloody sexy creature, you...” John murmured in awe, drinking in Sherlock's bared body. “God must have been in an extraordinarily good mood when creating you.” He slid his hand along Sherlock’s torso. “You're not only a genius, but your body is the most perfect piece of work ever.”
But that still didn’t explain why had he suddenly found himself unaffected by the beautiful woman, even when she stood stark naked in front of him. That was unlike Three Continents Watson. More disturbing was the fact that he sent lingering glances toward Sherlock at the same time and experienced the unmistakable signs of jealousy of the Woman whenever she had got the detective’s attention. It was plain to see that Sherlock had been intrigued by and drawn to her, and John hated that. He hated how their dynamic had been disturbed by a third party (was it how Sherlock felt about John’s dates too?). He loved the life the two of them shared, and he didn’t want to lose that or change it in any way.
John Watson found himself not being able to tear his gaze away from those bright uniquely blue coloured eyes that were waiting for an answer. An answer to a question he hadn't expected to hear, let alone to reply.
John Watson groaned loudly, his heartbeat accelerating again. Unable to speak, all he could do to show Sherlock his love was sliding his fingers into the dark hair of the young Holmes and tenderly massaging his scalp. The other hand enveloping Sherlock's shaft, he started stroking the hard member.
“You know, stealing stuff from the Inspector is a bit not good,” John laughed.  He remembered the time when he had realised that Sherlock had a thing for pickpocketing the DI.
“I don't care about your orientation,” Sherlock said. “You could be bisexual, pansexual, multi-sexual or whatever, as long as you're with me.”
Sherlock’s chest tightened so much at the evident pain in John’s voice that he thought it would crush the organs in his ribcage.
Once the photo was done, Sherlock tilted his head, so that his cold nose nuzzled John’s cheek. It was so innocently intimate. John felt like travelling back in time to his youth, when the dates were just good fun and fooling around, ignoring conventions and rules. That was the last time he felt such carefree happiness like he did now. Reliving that feeling, John could cry out in joy.
“I'm sorry.” John looked away, biting his lip. “Understand me, this is something I want to do. This is my purpose...”
John had to gather all his willpower to hide the thrill—and anxiety, to be honest—that Sherlock's nod elicited. He inhaled deeply, bracing himself to utter the life-changing reply.
Checking his phone, he frowned at the lack of signal still. He should have been close, though. Their suspect had fled in this direction, obviously being familiar with the area. That meant civilisation, which equalled mobile service.
“Hey, young man, are you lost?” A silver-white-bearded, elderly man looked out of the window, tipping his hat as a greeting.
It wasn't enough. Sherlock slid the shirt off of John's shoulders, his admiring eyes taking in the toned torso—every muscle in the right place, not bulky, but visibly trained. His mind’s eye could see the dog tags hanging over the fine chest and the olive waistband of the military trousers hugging the strong body.
“The Beresford mansion? You're lucky, my friend, I work there,” the man smiled broadly. “Barnaby,” he introduced himself. “No worries, we'll get you two there.” He pulled his Land Rover over to the side and got out.
“What did you say?” John's eyes snapped open and stared at him, intently studying Sherlock's expression.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered into his ear, and that was when John lost it. Shuddering under the young man, he came with a loud gasp. His whole body was shaking and the sensation was so intense that he could see stars in front of his eyes. For some minutes, he was heavily gasping for air, thinking he'd never be able to breath normally again.
"Not enough data," Sherlock muttered, and leaned in for a longer and deeper kiss. Sneaking his arms around the doctor, he pressed their bodies together, feeling the comforting warmth against his chest. He could feel John's heart beating fast, every thud like a note of a melody.
The thin blanket of snow crunched quietly underneath their feet as they were strolling along the Southbank of the Thames, inhaling the crisp, fresh December air. The alcohol they’d consumed lifting their spirits, they were chatting animatedly, laughing and joking.
“The best quality for my favourite customers.” Smiling wide, he filled the tumblers with the burgundy liquid. “It's said to be beneficial to potency,” he winked mischievously.
“You wonder why I seduced you last night and why I don’t intend to delete what happened from my mind palace. There’s only one answer to both: knowing you are not gay, that tedious social gathering with loads of alcohol was my only chance to have you.”
Sherlock's eyes darkened, the pieces of the puzzle finally clicking. “Would you?” His intent gaze bore into John's.
“I promise that I’ll come back to you.” John’s eyes bore into Sherlock’s, emphasising the weight of the words.
’ echoed in Sherlock's mind. He recalled the doctor's detached, unusually quiet attitude earlier that morning, which—added to his frustrated, on-edge manner just minutes ago—was enough evidence for him to see that what he was dreading was true. John didn't feel the same about the previous night and had no intention of revisiting the experience. And on the top of that, he was certainly going to leave him after everything that had happened. Was it worth it?
There was nothing wrong about appreciating someone’s beauty, John told himself whenever his look lingered a little too long on his flatmate’s alluring features. It didn’t mean he was gay.
“Could say so. My friend had a little accident in the forest—nothing serious, just a sprain, but he can't walk. We had to spend the night there in the storm, and now he has fever... I need help bringing him back to the mansion we're staying at...”
The young Holmes was watching his spent lover with pure affection. In the post-orgasm glow John looked much younger, the sweaty forehead and dilated pupils made him even sexier.
John frowned, not liking that Sherlock’s fever hadn’t diminished. Despite that, he was hesitant to wake the man, who was running on far too little sleep as it was.
"The great detective misses the details at times." Seeing that his friend still doesn't get his drift, John continued. "You see, but you don't observe ..." Sherlock searched the doctor's eyes for a clue. "You deduce that I might not be against the idea of sleeping with you, but you take my words of refusal for granted. Isn't there a contradiction?"
“You don't have to...” John started, but with a sudden urge, he changed his mind. “Sod it, who am I fooling? You have to.” He looked down at his partner, his eyes lighting up in mischief. “Yeah, you owe me big time.”
John pursed his lips. “Right. From that perspective, I can see your confusion,” he admitted and pondered Sherlock's reasoning for a moment. “Yes, I would,” he replied eventually, looking into the silver-blue eyes. “So, will you finally ask me?” Not risking the game of Q&A that time, John made himself clear in a full sentence.
John blushed suddenly, at Sherlock’s question.  He ducked his head so that brunette man would not notice anything was amiss, but Sherlock wasn’t really paying him any attention in the first place.  “Nothing,” John answered, a bit too quickly.  “Never mind, forget I said anything.”  He cleared his throat awkwardly and prayed that Sherlock didn’t glance over at him.
James took one last drink from his cup, the delicate, gold inlaid porcelain looking ridiculous against his dark stained denim jacket and the purple, wrinkled tunic he wore beneath it, and stood up to leave. Sherlock followed suit, to escort the man to the door and John followed close behind them.
“I hadn’t wanted to build it back up in the first place!” John argued, once again.  “It’s dangerous, Sherlock.  Dangerous and stupid.  It’s like taunting the anti-Synaths, asking for more trouble.  Don’t you see that?” he asked the man, but he didn’t give Sherlock the chance to respond.  “I know you’ve never cared about anyone else’s safety—not even your own sometimes—but now you have other people to consider.”  He took his finger and jabbed it at Sherlock’s sternum, hard, to drive his point home.  “You have another life that’s more important than your own to think of.”
, young man!” John shouts out, surprising even himself.  Something tightens deep in his belly at his own words, but he is so annoyed at the moment that he doesn’t even really register it.
John ignores Sherlock’s sardonic, biting tone.  He doesn’t blame Sherlock for being derisive about the whole thing; he is just a child who hasn’t been able to grasp the depth and complexity of adult relationships and emotions, after all.  “I love
He sighs, his hands stilling on Sherlock’s naked body, one on his hip and one over his heart.  “Jesus, I’m no more of a man than your father is,” John states with a grimace, pulling his hands away from Sherlock as if they had been burned.  He turns his back on the boy and drops his head in his hands, unable to look at Sherlock for a moment longer, afraid of what he will see in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Sherlock,” he begins, not sure what exactly he is going to say to make it better, but the brunet cuts him off, throwing the sheets off of himself and sitting up in his bed, body still bare from their earlier love-making.  John can see streaks of dried, crusting semen on Sherlock’s stomach and thighs because Sherlock doesn’t like to clean off right away; he likes to feel John on him, likes to feel them mixed together.
When Sherlock is done climaxing, John drags his lips across Sherlock’s throat and to his mouth, kissing him so sweetly and gently that a tightness grows in this throat.  He has never believed himself capable of feeling such tenderness and love for someone, but he finds that Sherlock brings it out in him.
Sherlock continues kissing him and wriggling all over him, trying to grind down against him some more, but John isn’t actively participating.  He knows that it is completely pointless for him to do anything to try to get hard again.  It just isn’t going to happen.  It’s nature.  Basic biology.  There’s simply nothing he can do about it.
“What the fuck were you thinking?” John asks, barely waiting for an answer before he is continuing on.  “What possessed you to do that?  To go over to my
He is so lost in his own thoughts that he nearly misses what Sherlock says next, it is mumbled so low.

John has gone from snogging him to wanking him to blowing him, all in slow, simmering succession, yet nothing has worked.  It’s maddening, frustrating, disappointing.
“Arousal, John,” Sherlock clarifies, looking straight at him from across the table.  His gaze is penetrating and unyielding.  “Intense arousal.  This is the first time that the feelings have been so strong that I simply cannot ignore them or will them away.  I’ve felt the rather urgent impulse to indulge my body in these feelings.  Quite frequently, I might add.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, always gets so desperate when John begins kissing him, as if he just can’t wait a moment longer for what comes next.  Against John, he begins to press his hips forward, seeking friction, and John can feel his burgeoning erection against his own hip.  Impatient little noises escape his mouth where it is pressed to John’s and the man chuckles softly, carding a hand through Sherlock’s hair.
John pulls back the worn duvet of the guest room’s bed and wearily crawls in, sighing heavily.  He closes his eyes and brings his hands up to rub his face, feeling the tight furrows of his brow.  Tonight’s row had been a big one, even by their standards.  Messy and loud and hurtful.  It began first thing that morning with rude, angry remarks about the previous night and John’s dead mobile, his inability to let Mary know where he was, the ridiculous amounts of time he has been spending away from home.  The snide, bitter comments continued throughout the afternoon as John spent the last day of his weekend at home, knowing he had already pushed his luck with sneaking off to see Sherlock.  He hadn’t answered Mary back, refusing to play her little game.  He just stayed at home and ignored her; in all honesty, he thinks he is getting pretty good at that.  During dinner, though, everything came to a head, an entire day’s worth of frustration and anger bottled up inside of him and finally releasing.  He can’t even remember now how it had escalated so quickly, but it doesn’t really matter.
is the more fascinating of the species,” Sherlock affirms with a sharp intake of breath as John finds a particularly sensitive spot.  “I find them quite intriguing.  I just thought you should know.  I want you to know everything about me.  Before this weekend is through.”
Sherlock is standing at his bookcase, back towards John but head turned towards the door.  At first glance he looks disheveled, but John doesn’t have the chance to study him overly—his gaze is drawn immediately to Sherlock’s desk, bedside table, and window sill, where every inch of available space is taken up by mugs of tea in various stages of consumption.
But if Sherlock understands that he has once again done something a little off of normal social standards, he doesn’t seem to care.  He simply stares at John and waits patiently for an answer.
John just huffs a laugh.  “Not every answer to a riddle is as simple as deducing someone’s heart rate or his hard-on, Sherlock,” he says.  “Yes, the idea turns me on—immensely—but there’s just a part of me that doesn’t think I will enjoy it.”
Sherlock snuggles deeper against him, licking into his mouth.  “This,” he mumbles against John’s lips.  “Just this.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says softly, his eyes staring unblinkingly in front of him to the floor, not looking at John.
At that Sherlock scoffs and throws his phone down onto the top of the table.  It makes their cups rattle.  “Please,” he says, glaring at John.  His voice is irritated and annoyed.  “He is on his way to running the British government.  As if anything I could do would possibly stand in his way.”  He shakes his head and his dark curls brush along his forehead and his ears, looking almost black in the dim light of the coffee shop.  “He just likes to think that I enjoy making things hard for him.  Which I kind of do,” he amends with a smirk.  “But he shouldn’t flatter himself—I don’t cause trouble solely with him in mind.”
be so much more, if he is given half a chance.  John wants to make sure that Sherlock has all the chances he needs.  He doesn’t want anything to stop Sherlock from living his life, from being happy.  He doesn’t want all the shadows of the boy’s past to kill that light in his eyes.
He is desperate for an escape now.  He is still pushing against Sherlock’s body, trying to centre his focus on keeping Sherlock’s hips from grinding into him anymore, but he is trembling and his arms are growing ever weaker.
“You took more than most can the first time,” John told him, bending towards the man to kiss him.  He wanted to feel that amazing mouth against other parts of his body, too.  “Can I start stretching you now?  I want to fuck you so badly.”
Sherlock sits up, water sloshing around noisily, and they move around each other until they find a good position for John to wet Sherlock’s hair, pouring shampoo in his palm and then massaging it into his scalp.  Sherlock practically melts into his hands and John savours every second of it.  He has Sherlock tilt his head back again and rinses the suds out of his hair, careful not to get any in Sherlock’s eyes.  John watches, riveted, as the water runs down Sherlock’s neck and over the smooth planes of his body.
“That’s understandable,” Sherlock said, choosing his words carefully.  He watched as Lestrade stared at him from across the desk, looking intently at his face for any sign of emotion or reaction.
He tried to push his way past the crowd that was surrounding him, tried to get closer to the small group of scared-looking men who were being escorted through the throng of people and towards the front doors of the clinic, but he couldn’t get any nearer.  The people in front of him were thrusting forward their signs and their hands, shouting obscenities that were lost in the din of everyone else around them.
?” Greg repeated, a little more desperate now. “You had wanted him to do this? To take that pill and get….” He trailed off awkwardly. “It just seems a little…I don’t know, reckless, don’t you think?” he finished.
Quite a nice change, indeed.  John can feel arousal building low in his belly as he makes his way to Sherlock’s, warming him inside and making butterflies erupt in his stomach in a flurry.  His cock twitches slightly in his trousers at the mere thought of seeing Sherlock with the soft toy and he knows that he has to get himself under control.
John knew that look, knew that it meant that Sherlock’s guard was up.  The brunette was not the easiest man to have a conversation with when it was about nothing of consequence—John cringed to think about how this particular discussion would go.
“This is the third one we’ve found like this in three weeks,” Lestrade told John, when the blonde man reached him and bent down to examine the body for cause of death.  “I can’t tell if this is just pure coincidence, or if there is a serial murderer out there stalking university girls.  We haven’t found anything to link them together, except that they have been found in, or have come from, areas of town where there are bars, but the deaths have all happened so close to each other that the Chief Inspector is going to want all possibilities brought up.”  He sighed tiredly and stood up, deep lines etching into his face.  “I’d like to avoid a serial murderer at all costs, you know?  So see if you can try to help me out this once.”
Mike shakes his head, still not looking John in the eye.  “No, nothing like that,” he reassures.  “It’s just that, one of your students, he…” Mike trails off, and John’s frown grows.  He is sure to be adding to the deep lines that already mar his face, but he hasn’t really been able to help it these past few months.
“Three,” he manages between gritted teeth.  “I ridiculed you and embarrassed you in front of everyone.”
“Look at you,” he says in a low voice, settling back on the lid of the toilet and beaming down at his little man.  “You’re sitting there for me like I asked, so pretty and patient.  Good boys who wait for their daddies deserve presents for listening so well, don’t you think?”
He wiped away the dust and ash that sat in a thick layer over it, and his heart stopped in his chest.
John opens his mouth to say something else but the Holmes boy seems intent on never letting him get a single statement in his own defence out.  This time he doesn’t even wait for John to speak before he is cutting the man off once more.
“Well, Mr. Holmes,” Dr. Greenwhich said, pulling off his latex examination gloves with a loud snap and turning in his little swivel stool to face the brunette man.  “Everything is looking good.”  He pulled out Sherlock’s medical chart and jotted down a few notes, looking back over the papers when he was done, to see Sherlock’s progress.  “I’m delighted with the weight you’ve been gaining—I thought you were going to be one of those problem pregnancies who couldn’t stomach any food,” he chuckled softly to himself, at some small, unknown inside joke.  “But according to your growth chart, you are right on track.  Most delighting to see.”
Sherlock scrambles to obey him, glad that this seems to be the only punishment he is getting for making such a mess out of the flat.  John doesn’t tell him what exactly he has in store for Sherlock as far as the kitchen is concerned—they’ll worry about that later.
John grumbles slightly under his breath before he decides to just let it go.  He spends a few moments silently watching Sherlock work, dark head bent low over his paper in concentration.  Sherlock’s skin is so pale and smooth that John’s fingers twitch with the desire to reach out and touch him, run the tips across Sherlock’s cheekbone and down the soft skin of his neck.  He wants to dip his fingers into the open collar of the button down shirt Sherlock is currently wearing and feel the bones of his clavicle, press kisses to his sternum.  He wets his lips and realises that his mouth has gone dry.
But no matter how much he tells himself that he isn’t eager to see his student again, he isn’t anxious to lay eyes on him once more, there is no ignoring the happy buzz that grows and carries him through the rest of his day.  Every single one of his colleagues thinks that his euphoric mood is simply due to the fact that he has been using his cane less and less over the past several days, until he barely has a need for it any longer.  He lets them think what they will and doesn’t let it dampen his mood.  Even while he is at home with Mary later that day, having another uncomfortably silent dinner with her, he is practically humming with excitement and nighttime can’t come fast enough.  As they are cleaning up, he lets Mary know that Mike wants to meet him at the pub for a pint and Mary just makes a noncommittal noise in the back of her throat, not even looking up at him as she continues the washing up.  So he leaves her to it and heads upstairs to get ready, running up the steps like a child simply because he can.
John knows which rule Sherlock is referring to.  It was one that John had put there specifically for moments like this that Sherlock has about himself, because he hates that Sherlock never sees himself the way that John sees him—beautiful, brilliant, amazing.
This is the point where he gives Sherlock the decision.  He is secretly asking if Sherlock has had enough.  John has had to learn all sorts of little tricks to understand what the boy wants, because getting Sherlock to come right out and say it is like pulling teeth.
John frowns but neither one lets go of the other.  His arms are still wrapped around Sherlock and his mind can’t seem to comprehend what it’s supposed to be doing when his mouth is saying one thing and his body is doing something else.  “It’s not funny, Sherlock,” he says, and his tone is reprimanding.  “This isn’t a joke!”
He had made it onto his floor, which was thankfully seemingly deserted, and his shaking hand was fumbling with his blasted room key to no avail as he heard Sherlock’s deep baritone voice begin speaking over the line.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, as if waiting for John to continue.  When John didn’t, Sherlock frowned at him, rolling his eyes.  “That doesn’t prove anything, John,” he told the doctor, unconvinced and unimpressed.
Sherlock closes his mouth on whatever it is he is about to say but the glare remains, focused intently on John.  After a second of debate Sherlock seems to decide that it is not worth it to push John’s limits, so he simply nods in response to the man’s question.
Sherlock scoffed.  “Just because my brother and I seem to have the same tendencies towards antiquities and books, that doesn’t mean that I have decorated exactly like him.  And besides, the flat isn’t as tiny as it used to be.  I think you’ll find ample room now for all of our…habits and hobbies.”
The whole time Sherlock stood there, stunned speechless at the audacity of it all. No words, no thoughts, would come to his mind that could describe the sheer amount of disgust he felt at the touch of a stranger’s hand on such an intimate part of his body. Never before had anyone taken such a liberty with him, barely even John would do such a thing.
“Please, John,” he whispered, bringing his face closer and kissing John tenderly.  He let his tongue sweep against John’s lips, pleadingly, and his hands moved to caress John’s body, drinking in the lovely feel of him.  “I need it.  So badly.  I need you to touch me.  I want to feel you.”  His hand found John’s, and gripped it, tugging it down between them until it was on his cock, touching himself while John’s hand held his own.
The drive to Sherlock’s gives his temper plenty of time to fester, and by the time he is banging on Sherlock’s door he is livid.  When Sherlock opens it, John wastes no time barging in.  He practically pushes Sherlock out of the way as he charges inside, slamming the door shut behind him and turning on Sherlock, his voice loud and his anger nearly uncontrollable.
He can’t believe Mary.  He can’t believe she could say such mean things.  He can’t believe that she can ruin even this for him—his time with Sherlock, something which is special and untouchable and
“No, no!” John said quickly, his face flushing as he realized that he was turning the whole situation into a spectacle. “Please, continue. I’ll—I’ll stop.”
He was glad John was here.  He wouldn’t be able to do this if John wasn’t here; he knew that, deep down.
At John’s words, Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly in surprise.  His mouth parts the tiniest bit as his tongue comes out to lick his lips nervously, trying to decipher just exactly what it is that John wants from him.  He is suddenly so unsure of himself and hesitant.  So John decides to help him out.
Sherlock worked over his cock feverishly, with a sort of vigor and desperation that turned John on more than the feel of the man’s mouth on him. When he looked back down the length of his body and to Sherlock, he saw that the brunette had opened the fly of his own trousers, and he was rubbing himself off as he sucked on John’s cock.
When he’s finished slicking them both up again, he reaches out with both hands to grip Sherlock by the hips and drag him down the bed slightly, positioning him so that John’s cock lines up with his entrance.  Seeing the tip of his prick so close to Sherlock’s arsehole makes the engorged, red flesh of his shaft twitch impatiently, and John realises that he has stayed hard the entire time that he has prepared Sherlock, the pill in his system never once flagging.
“But you’ll let them touch her?”  Sherlock’s words turn into a moan as John sucks at the sensitive juncture where his neck meets his shoulder.  “Your wife?”
With Sherlock’s perfect form laid out before him, John is unpleasantly aware of the way his own body looks, very nearly 20 years older than Sherlock’s and more worn around the edges.  Logically he knows that he doesn’t really have a lot to be ashamed of: his years in the Army have left a strong layer of stubborn muscle which hasn’t faded since his discharge and which shows through in all the right places—his arms, thighs, and back mostly.  He is definitely a little softer around the middle than he would like to be, but he knows that is to be expected of a man his age.  So, unless he wants to spend a couple of hours a day working out and hardly touching Chinese takeaway or fish and chips ever again, his slight belly is inevitable.
And that’s it, that’s all that John Watson’s will can take.  He groans out something that might be Sherlock’s name, but his orgasm rips through him like wildfire, consuming all thoughts and motor functions.  He is vaguely aware that he hadn’t even pulled away from Sherlock, and when his brain kicks back online he quickly looks down the length of the lithe body to see his come all over Sherlock’s stomach, mixing with Sherlock’s own.
He frowns down at his pint and licks his lips, turning to his friend with nerves steeled and convictions ready.  He won’t be made to feel guilty about being with Sherlock.  He can’t, not when he knows in his heart that it is right.
Instead of answering his question, Sherlock looks away from him, his head dropping and his gaze leaving John’s, as if he is suddenly ashamed.  “You don’t know how hard I’ve fought to survive this life,” he says, but he is speaking to the floor, not looking at John.  “How I’ve fought to survive everyone leaving me, being abandoned by every person who has ever loved me.”  He closes his eyes and winces at some distant memory, something John can’t see and probably can’t even imagine.  “You have no
John takes a step towards the open car door and the woman silently budges over into the other seat, making space for him.  She continues typing away at her phone, not even bothering to look up at him as he closes the door and the car silently begins to drive off, John sitting uncomfortably inside of it.
Beneath him, Sherlock lost all sense of himself.  Any embarrassment he felt in his body, any reservations he had about not straining himself, any worries that he had about the future, about himself and his ability to deal with the perils of parenthood, John washed away.  With his hands, with his mouth, with his breath, with his heart.  Washed away and replaced with the most urgent sense of love, of longing, of desperation, of completeness, of…
Sherlock sighed in annoyance.  That John thought he could still keep secrets from him, even after all of these years, was not as entertaining as it had once been, months ago.  “Of course I do, John.  I’m not a moron.  I’ve known the inevitable outcome to this scenario ever since it started playing itself out, and I know where it is headed even now.”
“Congratulations, Mr. Holmes.”  Sherlock could hear the doctor’s smile even through the crackling of the poor reception.  “You are one of the first confirmed successes of the public release of the Synathida pill.  Your blood test confirms that you are, indeed, pregnant.  We would like to have you come in for a prenatal checkup in a week, to do all the routine tests.”
John doesn’t speak again until he has the detective lying prostate on the couch beneath him, shirt halfway off and hanging from one shoulder, and trousers hastily undone and pushed down to his thighs along with his pants.  But then he can’t seem to keep his mouth shut.
John always wears his wedding ring whenever Sherlock fucks him.  He doesn’t see the point in taking it off and Sherlock never tells him to.  He knows that Sherlock likes to look at it, sitting around John’s finger, a little tight now after too many nights of greasy takeaway.  Sherlock runs the pad of his index finger along it as he squeezes John’s hand while he fucks into him relentlessly.  His other hand leaves John’s hip and comes up to the back of his neck, pushing John’s face into the floor roughly and cutting off John’s oxygen.  John has to turn his head to the side so that the pain is lessened somewhat, and he knows there will be visible fingermarks there later.
“What?” John asks him, offended.  “I’m not a fucking pushover, Sherlock!”  It’s not the first time Sherlock has called him that and John is sick of it.
John doesn’t understand what the boy is doing, why Sherlock is goading him like this.  Why he is hurting John this way.  But he suddenly doesn’t care.  Because John’s had enough of it.  He’s had enough of people walking all over him and taking from him, telling him what to do.
So he laughs and hugs Sherlock tight to him, heedless of the mess smeared all over the boy’s arms and torso and groin, and the two of them stand there in the middle of his kitchen, naked and giggling like naughty children.
Dimmock threw him a confused look as he donned his beige coat on the other side of the table that Sherlock was currently leaning on, strapping his piece to his holster when he finished.  “What are you talking about?  You need to come with us to arrest that psychopath.”
John stops, hand on the door, so close to walking out.  He sighs, and his stomach clenches because he knows exactly what she thinks she has to do.  It was the reason he was so scared of anyone finding out about Sherlock.  He takes a deep breath, unworried now after his talk with Mycroft.  The elder Holmes had given his word that he would do what he could for John and Sherlock’s unique situation, to help his little brother and finally do something to take care of Sherlock.  At this moment, John knows that Mycroft almost certainly has put surveillance on Mary’s mobile and will be intercepting any call she makes.  He basks in the moment of safety and security and his hand grips the doorknob.
John had once thought that Sherlock’s most intimate places would look as beautiful as the rest of him, smooth and pink and untouched.  And he was right.  Sherlock’s skin looks new and fresh, and as John pushes his lover’s cheeks apart and the cool air of the room hits the hot skin, Sherlock’s arsehole clenches suddenly, releasing quickly and opening ever so slightly before closing again.  John is mesmerised by the pulse of it, the way it looks, tight and tempting and waiting to be touched.
“Good,” the old doctor said, his smile once more coming back.  “Now, for the love of God, give me that doll before you make its head fall off.”
Something prickles hotly at the edges of John’s vision and he tries his hardest to ignore it.  “Do you think you’ll use again?” he asks instead, as a way to keep Sherlock from noticing the slight sheen to his eyes and the roughness of his voice.
“Could it be that you’ve decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?” Mycroft asks, ignoring John’s question.
,” John says softly on an exasperated sigh.  They sit there for a moment in an awkward silence as John struggles to find words to soothe him.  “Well, maybe you can try again on Monday…” he starts, but he trails off because the platitude sounds strange directed toward Sherlock.
The final blow is neither kind nor gentle, and Sherlock cries out in shock as John’s strong hand connects with his slightly sore bottom.
But John just laughed at him, not bothering to hide it this time.  He leaned away from Sherlock to give the man room to turn over on the couch, so that he was facing the doctor.  “Of course you’re not father material,” he told the brunette man.  “You’re Sherlock Holmes!  I’m not even sure you’re human, half the time.”
“Well…we loved them once,” Mike amends.  “That’s why we married them.”  He smiles flagrantly and for a split second John can see the young man he had known all those years ago, back in university.  “Every time I think about leaving her, all I can see is that teenage girl who used to worship me.  I keep hoping that girl will come back.  That’s why I stay,” he tells John, the smile growing in size but also in sadness.
“A time-out, Sherlock.  For half an hour.  And no more experiments with Daddy for the next two times that we play.”
There were dozens of people out on the street, milling about pointlessly and staring wide-eyed at the destruction of building 221 in front of them.  John hardly gave the building a passing glance.  He was intent on only one thing, finding only one person…

All pictures are linked to my Tumblr account, which is NSFW although most of the pictures for this story (but not all!) are not explicit.
“Of course you did, Sherlock.”  Mycroft let out a sigh, tired and long-suffering.  “Ever the explorer, ever the scientist.  But I don’t believe that is the only thing.”  He turned his gaze upon his younger brother, sharp and deadly.  “Tell me the truth, the whole of it.  Why did you do this?”
Sherlock doesn’t miss a single beat, doesn’t pause for a moment.  “I’m not scared, John,” he answers quickly, deep voice full of conviction.  “I want you to do this.  I’ve been waiting a long time for it.  Don’t make me wait any longer.  Please.”
No wonder the voice on the other side of the door sounds a bit stuffy; Sherlock probably has tissue paper shoved up his nostrils to stem the flow of blood.  John bites back a sigh by the barest of threads.  He tries to push his annoyance to the side, though, and dredge up the doctor in him, purely professional and clinical.  “Are you hurt?  Is everything still in working order?”  He tries once more to push open the door, but it still feels as if Sherlock has wedged himself against it.
With his eyes on Sherlock’s, John slips his lubed hand between them, along the warm crease of Sherlock’s thigh and down the moist, wrinkled skin of his balls, wet with John’s saliva which has dripped down the length of Sherlock’s cock.  He moves softly across the flat expanse of Sherlock’s perineum and to the tight pucker of his entrance.  John slides a single finger in swiftly and watches as Sherlock gasps and winces slightly at the sudden intrusion, his eyes never leaving John’s.  The man stretches his arm out in the uncomfortable position, searching, looking for just the right angle to find—
He manages to tear himself away from Sherlock, having to turn his head to break the kiss.  “Right,” he says, taking a deep breath and pushing Sherlock away from him, back into his own chair.  “If you aren’t going to listen to me, then I guess a spanking really is what you want.”
“That’s it, right there,” John pants into Sherlock’s neck, nipping at the sweaty skin under his teeth.  “That’s the spot, yeah?”
John knows it is the wrong thing to say.  Knows it as soon as the words are out of his mouth.  He clamps his lips shut but the damage has already been done, the words are out and hovering in the suddenly still air between them like a deadly cloud.
“Right, of course not,” John groaned, shoving hard at the box from behind and stumbling as it leveled out on the landing and slid easily through the door.
He had been terrified that night.  Well and truly terrified.  He had been frightened so few times in his life that he could count them on one hand, even to this day.  At that time, not even John had known how to deal with Sherlock’s all too human reaction to what he had thought he had seen.  He had told John then that he had always been able to keep himself distant, to divorce himself from his feelings.  But he couldn’t that night.  The tremble of his hands as it had clutched desperately at the tumbler of scotch as he sat shaking in front of the fire of the inn had been testament to that fact.
“So- I have weighed the option in my mind for quite some time and I have come to the conclusion we should get married.” Sherlock said quickly.
John gave a big smile and turned off the bathroom light, raising the sheet to get under the covers with him. “I am too. I really am.” John said before pressing a soft kiss to his lips.
Sherlock continued as if he hadn't heard the outburst. “However, he borrows handcuffs for personal use at times.. ,“ he wondered aloud. “We could try them next time too...” He glanced mischievously at his partner.
“Tell me I'm not dreaming,” he whispered breathlessly, pulling back briefly. Sherlock fixed his gaze on John's thin lips, not daring to look him in the eye, in case the moment was only a figment of his imagination.
“Sherlock...” John reached for Sherlock’s hand, his voice gentle and reassuring. “Look at me.” Sherlock obeyed reluctantly. “You keep saying that you're a sociopath, but believe me, you aren’t.” The tears were shining in John's eyes, an affectionate smile lighting his face.
Sherlock’s world crashed. This couldn’t be happening. Not when he finally found what he had always been looking for—his other half, the complementing piece of the puzzle, his reason to live. With the current situation in the world, the looming terror attacks everywhere, reports on kidnapped and executed soldiers and civilians, he couldn’t dismiss the fear that John was going to be in danger. He wouldn’t be able to handle it if anything happened to John.

Sherlock tightened his hold and squeezed harder, before switching to his mouth once again. This time, John didn't have to comment about pressure and speed, Sherlock learnt quickly as he gauged his partner’s body language. Inhaling the musky scent of John's arousal, Sherlock swirled his tongue around the flushed erection with newfound eagerness.
"Ever since you entered my life, I find myself experiencing things I have never done before. I have never had a friend, let alone a best friend, now here you are. People didn't care for me, now here are you, Mrs. Hudson, Molly, Lestrade.. I have never been anxious about anyone's safety, now I worry about you all the time. I have never indulged myself in ordinary things, now I let you take over my life."
“Shit, we’ll need some lubricant,” John gasped as Sherlock slowly started stroking him. “There is a bottle is my–” But the sentence got caught in his throat, and his eyes widened when Sherlock's mouth wrapped boldly around his cock without warning. “Sweet Jesus,” John inhaled sharply.
“Don't look at me like you didn't know,” John chuckled. “You were fully aware of how that looked, still enjoyed it, you sodding git.”
Some minutes later they both were panting, getting closer to the edge. Their sweat-covered bodies joining, all they could focus on was pleasing each other as never before.
Sherlock lifted his head and looked at John breathlessly. His heart skipped a beat at the sight that greeted him. John watched him with dark, hungry, lust-filled eyes, swallowing his cum as if it was some delicious nectar. Sherlock's  heart missed a beat. People didn't even want to be near him, while this man wanted his
“I like touching you. Your skin is like pure velvet.” John's lips travelled down to Sherlock's chest, exploring the soft flesh idly. The detective's breath hitched, and a quiet moan escaped his lips as John's fingertips brushed his nipples. “You like that, huh?” John repeated the move.
Heavy sobs shook his body, while hot tears streamed down his cheeks. He didn’t want to wake Sherlock, the detective shouldn’t see him like this. John couldn’t face him asking questions right now and he definitely didn’t want Sherlock worry about him.
Sherlock shifted at the unexpected praise, his mouth curving into a sheepish smile. He could never get tired of hearing John complimenting him.
John wondered. Sherlock Holmes wasn’t interested in sex. John could never decide though if the detective refused to act on the primal desires only because the act distracted him from focusing on the Work, or because he was asexual by nature. He could hear Sherlock reprimanding him,
John smiled. Breaking away, his eyes locked the young man's. “Yes, you're an arrogant, annoying, intolerable bastard, yet, I can't help about it, I love you.” Cupping Sherlock's face, he pulled him into a soft kiss.
Sherlock shifted in embarrassment. All his confidence evaporated, and all he could do was blink nervously. Could he say it?
“How many times should I state that I'm not gay?!” He burst out. “It's just you, you sodding daft!” He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. “What's the next step? Seeing ourselves in the morning paper?”
“Oh, shit,” John wrinkled his nose, apparently sharing Sherlock's irritation about wasting time, and, swiftly grabbing the lapels of the purple shirt, yanked him into a demanding kiss. Before Sherlock could comprehend what happened, John’s hungry mouth sucked on his, hard and bruising, his teeth occasionally joining in, grazing the soft flesh. It sent Sherlock's senses on overdrive.
“Of course not,” John huffed in disdain. “Stop lying. I'm sure you find this bloody entertaining, but this is fucking humiliating to me.”
Sherlock sadly gazed at the yellow and red leaves floating on the dark water of the lake, oblivious to the slightly chilly autumn wind tousling his curls and brushing his cheek. Then there was someone beside him—heavy boots crushing the dry leaves on the ground. John.
Sherlock felt something settle in him. Data he understood. He took John in his hand cautiously. God, the sensation was incredible. The heavy weight was hot in his palm, the veins throbbed and muscles twitched under his touch.
John growled, his eyes filling with disdain. His fist was just an inch away from the pale face, when Sherlock's arm blocked the blow. Sometimes martial arts skills proved to be useful.
Here's a new chapter, with the warning of language and explicit description of sexual situations. ;)
“For that drink, you git!” John burst out in laughter again. This whole scene was getting utterly comical by now.
“I'm not having a row with you. I'm your doctor, so you do as I say, like it or not. If I have to, I'll tie you to the bed,” John affirmed strictly.
“John.” Sherlock's voice was deep and husky. “I truly appreciate your worry, but I've been waiting for this ever since that morning, when I woke up beside you. Ever since then, I've kept berating myself and the bloody alcohol for not remembering much of what happened. I have only the memories of my subconscious, and I hate it! If it were up to me, we'd have done this weeks ago. But you set the rule of not getting physical, and I respected your choice. Having been beside you, but not allowed to touch or get lost in you during the past months has been a torture, but I obliged your wish. So if you ask me if I'm up to engaging into sexual activity with you, my answer is, hell, yes!”
The old man didn’t mind sharing information of the family, which John thought could be useful for their investigation. “Do they quarrel a lot?” he inquired cautiously.
After walking aimlessly through the nearby streets, John eventually ended up in a coffee shop, nursing a cup of strong coffee (as still having been a bit hangoverish, getting a pint was out of question). Sitting at a window table, he watched the people passing by in the street, occasionally taking a sip of his hot drink. Out of the suffocating rooms of 221B, spared of Sherlock's drama-queen attitude and feeling more like himself after the stroll in the crisp November air, he could finally think without his head threatening to split into pieces and assess the situation he had got himself into in merely twelve hours.
What now? When visiting Ella, he hadn’t known that the intensity of remorse and the panic attacks would get worse. The more intimate thoughts he had about Sherlock, the more tortured he felt. How long could it go on?
“Ah, God...I'm not sure you are...” John moaned loudly, tilting his head to provide wider access to the exploring mouth.
vivid ones from this morning. He vaguely remembered dancing with Sherlock, giggling and unabashedly flirting all the way, then there was a large gap, and the next thing he could faintly recall was Sherlock's alcohol-bathed lips covering his, while long, wiry arms encircled him. The rest of the night was nothing but a cavalcade of faded images and hazy impressions.
He applied a generous amount of his mint-scented shower gel to his arms and vigorously massaged the forming foam on his skin, scrubbing away the remaining evidence of last night’s activity.
He needed distraction. He needed something to alleviate the noise and chaos in his mind. The sweet clarity and peace that his seven percent solution offered was ever so tempting. Sherlock could almost feel the blissful heat spreading through his veins and his mind calming, his focus becoming deliciously sharp, his thoughts crystal clear. Despite the strength of his craving for this honed serenity, Sherlock couldn't let himself fetch his secret stash and take that powerful relief. He hated that his promise to John and the thought of disappointing him was still binding him.
“How can you be so bloody calm about it??” John exclaimed. “Does the thought of your brother gawking at you having sex, moreover with another man, not freak you out? Does it not infuriate you?“
The forest ahead got thinner, and John soon reached a clearing that was cut by a dirt road. He took another look at his phone. Still nothing. He grunted. Now there was one more reason to love central London.
John's even breath caressed his ear like the gentle, warm summer breeze. Sherlock smiled at the occasional little snoring noises, finding them utterly endearing. John was drooling on him; there was a damp spot on his T-shirt. Sherlock wondered what he was dreaming about. Now he wished to have the ability to see other people's dreams—more precisely, John's dreams. He could make such good use of that—indulging in the happy ones, and intervening in the nightmares to grant his partner a peaceful rest. John would never have any more of those night terrors when he bolted, panting, covered in cold sweat, with utter fear and horror in his dark eyes. Or, if he had the power to channel dreams into another person's brain, he could plant only happy dreams into John's mind, preferably ones involving himself.
In that moment both of them knew that tonight was going to be different to the few ones they had spent together. Those times were kind of the introduction to something special, a taste of what was yet to come.
Hardly had he pull the jumper over John's head before John was kissing him again, tugging at his black blazer until the clothing eventually landed on the floor. John's palms slid along the silky material of his purple shirt, exploring the muscles underneath the tight article.
Many thanks to everyone who stuck with me till the end, special thank you to my faithful readers (you know who you are)! Again, thank you for nutmeag83 for the beta-work and support! I owe it all to you! If there's any mistakes, that's mine, apologies!
“You’re right. I’m not sure about you being able to have…” John searched for the right term, even though he didn’t know either what the proper word was. “...those kinds of feelings for me.”
Pulling back after the heavenly moment, Sherlock rested his forehead against John's. “You gave Christmas a new meaning. Thank you.”
I'm not a medical professional, all the knowledge I have I gathered from the internet, so I apologise if there's any incorrect information.
Sherlock didn't want to break the unexpected, ever so comfortable situation—not when all he yearned for was to be physically intimate with John. Even the urge of nature couldn't compete with John Watson. It was just his transport after all, something to which he had never paid much attention, unless it was inevitable. It was all just a matter of mind over body.
“If I wanted to get off, I'd grab you and serve myself,” Sherlock said courtly, reproach tainting his tone. Cutting the guessing game short, he provided the answer. “No, I wanted to see ourselves during the act. The way we move, breath, cry-”
Thank you as always to my betas and most importantly my readers! I know it's not an easy ride at the moment, but I can promise you that it'll get better!
Sherlock swallowed hard, fighting the rising urge to cry. “Let you go...” His usually confident tone wavered, and fear lit up in his eyes. “What if you don't come back? What if you get hurt again and die... then I can never tell you–”
“Would I what?” Sometimes having a conversation with the genius was both hilarious and frustrating. Following the speed of thoughts of that brilliant mind required extra patience and effort.
“Should I be interested? Right now?“ he asked unenthusiastically, furrowing a brow. Yet, knowing Sherlock wasn't going to drop the issue until he got an answer, he decided it was better to play along. “I guess you were curious,” he gave in with a sigh.
"I don't need special gifts from you to show me that you care. You're my friend, I know you do. But this... What you offer is beyond friendship."
“I don't want to disappoint you,” Sherlock spoke quietly, almost in a whisper. His voice was desperate. “I don't want you to be ashamed of me.”
“Tell me the truth, Sherlock!” John’s jaw clenched, and his expression mirrored desperation and anger. “Just once, be honest with me.”
I might not be able to post another chapter this week as I have a surgery on Fri and will have to stay in hospital for the weekend. So sorry in advance.
“Sherlock, tell me. Please.” John took a step closer, the colourful leaves crunching under his feet. “Maybe it's something I need to hear.”
“Sherlock,” John called softly, crouching beside the shaking man. Cupping the detective's death-pale cheeks in his hands, the heated skin proved John’s fears right; Sherlock had a high fever.
Sherlock needed to get his mind off of the nagging thoughts of John's intentions and the tormenting doubts the night had evoked. He hated this feeling. He hated that he had become weak and let himself feel at all—look where it had led! The image of Mycroft's gloating grin haunted him.
Sherlock's mouth quirk into a smirk of mischief, and, putting on the detective attitude, he smugly said.
“Maybe you don't, but I definitely don't like the idea of my private life being exposed. These are “- he gestured toward the screen with his hand - “utterly intimate moments, which means they are private. Private, should I spell it for you? P-R-I-V-A-T-E! What is under the entry of 'private' in your mental thesaurus? In my interpretation it concerns things that I don't share with anyone, they are for my eyes only. And one's love life is definitely off-limit for public. Note that Sherlock, if you happen to have deleted this fact. “
At 24 he briefly made friends with a young girl in rehab with him. She always looked at him with pity but genuinely seemed to like him.
Once in class at 18, he can’t even recall what it was for anymore, he was paired with a young girl and he had to go through his day to day routine. He hadn’t noticed at first how her face grew more sad as he continued and she would prompt, “So you don’t hang out with friends on the weekends or eat together or anything?” He would shake his head every time except to say once, “Well I do leave my room occasionally on the weekend to do laundry.”
“Is it Sherlock? You are using an incorrect assumption about you to hide your true self in order to protect yourself. How exactly are the two different.”
Sherlock cooed gently to Rosie as John got whatever his mystery gift was. For once he actually wasn’t sure what it was. “Close your eyes and hold out your hands.” John said behind him.
It seemed like the flat was overflowing with sound and Sherlock secretly loved it. There was always a sound from Rosie or from John. He forgot how much he just loved hearing John move around as he read the paper or made tea.
John sighed, running a hand through his hair. He shifted back and forth on his feet. “I guess I hadn’t realized you cared so much about it. I will make you a deal, you correct people when they say you are a sociopath or anything of the like and we can go public.” John said. If he was being honest he would go public with him even if he didn’t agree to his terms, he just figured he should at least try and get something out of it.
John let out a long breath. He ran his hands over his face. Are people always this nervous about coming out? Sherlock watched as John clenched his hands at his side, he could see them shaking. Sherlock stepped forward and cautiously wrapped his arms around him, unsure how well received it would be at the moment. “I’m sorry, John. I shouldn’t force you. You don’t have to come out if you don’t want to. It was… insensitive of me.”
At 36 years old, Sherlock Watson-Holmes realized a few things. 1) It’s okay to be lonely, 2) It isn’t permanent, 3) It’s okay to not have met all of your friends and the love of your life when you are 20, and 4) He was never going to be lonely again.
Sherlock just leaned forward and pressed his mouth roughly against John’s, keeping a hand on John’s cheek, keeping him close. “You, John Watson, are incredible.”
Sherlock made his thinking face for a moment despite knowing he would agree. He didn’t want John to see how desperate he was about the whole matter. “Fine. You have a deal.”
Sherlock agreed with John and pressed a kiss to the top of John’s head. Just as they got ready to leave Sherlock heard his phone go off. Sherlock flicked his eyes over to John who just shrugged. “What would be more fitting than having to solve a murder right after our wedding?”
John finished laughing at one of his stories and refilled his glass. He raised it up in a mock toast. “To the greatest man I have ever known.” John said with a smile.
His teenage years were spent alone. Mycroft had gone off to a different school, glad to escape his parents. The few friends he had in his early years had gone off and made better friends that they actually invited to things. His relationship with his parents only seemed to get worse as time went on. The house always seemed to have a tension that lingered in the air.
On his 34th birthday Rosie was with Mrs Hudson, it was just John and him. They sat together, drinks in hand. It reminded him so much of a few years ago when Lestrade was called to get them to stop laughing. That was six years ago. It seems so long ago.
At 29 he was alone, the cold mattress doing nothing for his back. He looked at the cracked ceiling, longing for his normal spot on the couch, John next to him rambling about something. Anything. He would give anything to just spend a few minutes in his presence, have John yell at him about an experiment or tell him about a child at the clinic. Anything but the silence. The crushing silence.
“Me saying I am a sociopath doesn’t affect anyone but myself.” Sherlock said, satisfied with himself for coming up with an answer.
At 35 Sherlock was sitting on the ground with John and Rosie at Christmas. “Well I will start cleaning up.” Sherlock said before John grabbed his wrist.
“I don’t want anyone else there, and Tom will most likely be too high to remember any of it afterwards. I want us to be married but I would rather die than have Mummy or Mycroft there to watch.”
Lestrade just watched in shock. He knew he should step in and break it off but Sally honestly needed to be brought down a few pegs.
“Now, if you don’t mind Lestrade. If Sherlock is done solving his case for you all we are gonna go back to our flat and take a vacation.” John said, he grabbed Sherlock’s hand and spared a nod at Lestrade before leaving the crime scene, all eyes on them as they left. Just before they were out of earshot John called out, “Don’t bother contacting us for another week, that should give you time to train your team to treat Sherlock with some respect.”
John flagged down a cab ( for once) and told the driver to take them to Baker Street before looking at Sherlock. His mouth was parted, his eyes soft. “Sorry about that. I just can’t stand how they treat you. Especially on our wedding day.”
John let out a laugh that gently shook Sherlock. He always loved when he was holding John and he could feel vibrations from him laughing or talking against him. It made it all somehow feel more real. “I- I know it is scary John but it’ll be for the best. I believe it was sir Ian McKellen that said he had never met a gay person who regretted coming out. Life at last begins to make sense, when you are open and honest.”
Every time he left his room to get food he kept his head down, ignored the people all around him in groups. He would gather food and bring it back to his room, closing the door behind him. He would put on violin music and eat his food, staring at the blank wall in front of him. The girl next door laughing even louder than normal it seemed.
Lestrade wrote frantically as John watched in awe. Just as John was going to exclaim some form of praise Sally gasped. “Is the freak wearing a wedding ring!?”
“Well then John and I will be-” Sherlock began and begun to leave but John’s hand snaked down to his wrist and kept him in place.
John began laughing again. “I can’t believe we laughed so much we got a noise complaint. And you’ve shot walls before without complaint.” John said, his face bright and open.
“It’s my treat. Or should I say Mycroft’s. He should know better than to leave his card lying about.”
John hesitantly moved back to Baker Street when Sherlock was 33. John brought with him one baby girl with no mother. Despite the circumstances Sherlock couldn’t help but feel more happy than he had in years.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock in return. “It’s fine. I know you are right, I just don’t like it. I have been living a lie. It’s not fair to you and it’s not fair to me. I don’t know why I care so much about what people think. I shouldn’t have to live a lie just because other people are bigots. I shouldn’t adjust my life to make other people more comfortable.”
John pulled back from Sherlock and looked into his eyes, his hands clutching onto his shirt. “Wait, are you serious?”
John smiled, his hand resting on top of Sherlock’s, gently stroking it with his thumb. “I think I could grow to quite like that.”
He graduated at 20. No one showed up. No one clapped when his name was called. No cameras flashed. Even then he didn’t feel lonely, only a small amount of pride at being done with it all.
At 31 Sherlock experienced the greatest amount of relief and disappointment ever in his life. Of course he was married. Why would he not be? They never got around to talking about dating, and even if they had there as no reason to why John would randomly wait two years in order to start dating again.
“God, we already called in the freak?” A voice chimed behind them. John closed his eyes for a moment and clenched his fists. He really wasn’t in the mood for her today.
Sherlock stood up and went towards Lestrade. “She is on vacation, most likely from Indiana. She came to meet up with a friend, most likely from University. They used to date, when he asked her out and she denied him he was mad. He waited for her to pass an alleyway and hit her with a hammer from the nearby construction site. You should find the murder weapon in one of the nearby alleyways. Restaurant security footage should reveal the killer.”
Sherlock huffed but complied. He felt something light in his hands and opened his eyes. His eyes quickly scanned the packet in front of him.
Sherlock couldn’t believe himself when he opened the door at 28 to show Lestrade with a frown. “I don’t know what you two are up to but I have had several noise complaints, they said it sounded like a party. Keep the noise down before I have to bring you in, which no doubt Donovan would love.” Lestrade smiled and peered over to see John with a bright smile, a drink in his hand.
When he settled into bed that night with John he couldn’t stop the way his heart clenched as he watched John get ready for bed like normal. He couldn’t stop staring at the way the gold band glittered on his hand. He never could have imagined this is what his life would become when he was 16 at college, staring at the beige wall, wondering what life held for him. He never could have imaged John Watson even existed.
“For the record Donovan, it’s not for a case. They are a set.” John said and held up his hand to show his own ring.
“You act like it’s not more complicated than that. Coming out is a big deal. I thought you didn’t care if our relationship was public.” John said, his hands resting on his hips.
Sherlock hadn’t been lonely in so long he couldn’t remember the last time. Perhaps when he was 7 or 8, sitting in his room quietly, wondering why his parents were never home. Maybe it was when his two friends were making plans in front of him as he watched quietly. It could be when they would all go for a walk and the sidewalk would narrow and he suddenly was walking behind them instead of beside. It could have been the first time he was called annoying, his heart dropping and his blood running cold despite his face bright red in shame and he escaped to the bathroom to cry in the closed stall.
“What was so important that I had to drop everything and come meet you here?” John asked Sherlock, making his way through the nearly-finished entryway of the recently reconstructed Baker Street.  He could see Sherlock down the corridor, carrying a large bag as he walked and disappearing into one of the rooms towards the back of the building.
“Yes,” he said. “Yes.” This was what he needed. John’s skin was burning up behind him, he could feel it on the backs of his thighs and on his arse and on his hips where the doctor was holding onto him tightly.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John chokes out through clenched teeth, voice gone rough and breath gone jagged in his anger.  “Just shut up.”
From down the hallway John hears Sherlock come out of their bedroom, his steps light and carefree as he makes his way into the kitchen.  John looks up at him and sees that Sherlock is still in his pyjamas and dressing gown, though the pyjamas he has decided to lounge around in today are pirate-themed and decidedly “little”-friendly.
From the other side of the bed, Sherlock only made a noise of discontent in the back of his throat as John tried to cover himself up with their blanket, trying to put an end to Sherlock’s exercises.
John’s smile grows because he can certainly believe that.  “What do they usually say?” he asks, curious.
“We could get you another soft toy,” John says, his face flushing hotly as he thinks about buying his teenage lover more children’s toys.  “Or some building blocks and books.  There’s lots of things we could do with those.”  It is slightly embarrassing, talking to a genius who is half his age with an IQ twice that of his own about toys of all things, but John is determined to get over it because this is something that they both desperately want.  It will take some time for him to get comfortable with the idea of buying Sherlock children’s things, and he knows the only way to overcome his unease is to jump into the middle of it.
He quickly turned on his heel, coat flapping about around him, and made for the main road, looking for the nearest spot that would have a public bathroom.
John stares at her for a moment.  He is so amazed that she could be fooled completely by Sherlock that John forgets for a second that the boy is even there until he hears the deep voice from across the room.
“What?” John said, dragging his mind away from the thought of how long it had been since he had had sex and back into the room, and conversation he was having, with Lestrade.  “No!  No one cheated on anyone!”
“This is real, Sherlock,” he says with conviction.  He has never been more certain about anything in his life.  “This is important and this matters to me.  Deeply.  It’s real to me.  Is it—” he falters suddenly because, while he knows how he feels, he realises that he doesn’t really know how the genius beside him feels.  “Is it real to you?”
that you find on me!”  Her hands are fluttering about frantically now, unable to stay still.  “He teaches a yoga class and he didn’t have any business cards.  He was there with his assistant and they were discussing their next class schedule!  I don’t know what else to tell you to get it through your thick skull that you are acting absolutely mad!”
It’s one of the reasons that he hasn’t had sex in so long, or even attempted a relationship.  But then John had come along and John was just so…
“But I promise, I’ve never lied to you.  You are the first person who I’ve ever done anything that intimate with—you
food, without his stomach churning unpleasantly and urging him to the bathroom.  It happened so frequently that Sherlock could not even try to hide it from John.  A few times when John had been in the bathroom, Sherlock had not been able to make it to a trash can and had ended up using the shower or toilet while John was occupying the washroom, puking into whichever facility the blonde doctor was not using at the moment.
His lungs pulled in large quantities of air, but he couldn’t seem to breathe properly. He was gasping, and his hands were shaking as they tightened around the sheets, and suddenly he felt the very tip of John’s cock at his entrance, and he couldn’t take it any longer.
“Fine, John,” she says and he can tell she is angry now, glaring at him.  “I thought you would be happy about the time we would spend together but I guess I was wrong.  I’ll be out all weekend, then.”
John’s head falls back at the incredible, indescribable feel of it and Sherlock makes a small, pleased humming noise as he pulls off, licking his lips lasciviously and smiling proudly up at the man.
week.  He told John each time he felt the tiny flutter of movement, but the doctor had not yet been able to feel it for himself, more than a week and half after Sherlock had first announced that he had felt something.
When he finally has Sherlock completely naked under him—his own trousers, underwear, and socks shoved out of the way while his shirt and vest are, as ever, still firmly in place—he thinks that now is as good a time as any to put their new decision into action.  He shivers in anticipation as he thinks of everything that they are now able to do with each other.  He barely knows where to start and has to remind himself once again to slow down; Sherlock is a virgin still, new to all of these different sensations.
Sherlock’s eyes follow him, clear and bright and questioning, as if he wants to ask John something.  He doesn’t, though, and the man simply raises an arm and beckons the brunet down to lie next to him.
Before they leave, as they are both dancing around each other in the kitchen while gathering keys and donning coats, he accidentally bumps into her when they both try to exit the doorway at the same time.  Normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but it is the closest that the two of them have been in months (not counting when they sleep), and it seems strange, so he feels the need to say something.
The late morning light shone brightly on everything around him, hiding nothing, and Sherlock listened as the fire marshal spoke to him and John about what they had found earlier that morning.  A deliberately cut gas main and an ignition point, at the back of the building.
He opens the bottle of lube and reaches down to his own hip, where John’s other hand has been holding him.  Sherlock lifts it up, upturning the lube and dripping a dollop onto John’s fingers, meeting the man’s eyes over their combined hands.
“Good lad,” John chuckles and stands up, dropping a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s frizzy head before leaving the bathroom and heading for his closet.
Fed up now with the production, John answered Sherlock sharply, not even bothering to try to be gentle any longer. “You said that you were dying all throughout your first trimester—hell, you even said that you were dying when you were vomiting up your guts from the Synathida. And every time you get a cramp in your legs or a twinge in your back you say that you’re dying. Well, guess what:
“Sherlock,” John begins slowly once he knows he has his aggravation under control, “sit down at this desk and eat.”  His tone is commanding, brooking no argument, and he fully expects the child to listen to him finally.
And then, he could lean forward just a little, to press a kiss to Sherlock’s lips, and even that small movement would alter their angle, and what John had thought felt like heaven just a second ago was nothing compared to this now, and Sherlock’s voice filled his ears with deep moans and heavy breaths and soft whispers.
John turns them around and shoves Sherlock towards his bed.  When they reach it, he pushes Sherlock face down onto the mattress before he can voice his opinion on the matter, pressing into Sherlock’s back so that he can’t try to turn over.  Sherlock struggles slightly, mostly for show John thinks, for the thrill of it.  The fight leaves him fast when John manages to pin him down with one forearm pressed across the length of Sherlock’s shoulder blades and the other hand rubbing at the hole of his upturned arse.
“Yes,” Sherlock moans, and for a second he sounds like himself again, like he normally does when he and John have sex, voice deep and rich, somehow older than how he has been sounding during all of this.  “Yes, do it.  Please, do it.”
Sherlock, however, simply leans all of his weight into John’s chest, and John can’t budge him.  “That’s okay,” he says as he licks a trail up the side of John’s neck.  “I don’t need you to be conscious; I just need you to be hard.”
John pounds on Sherlock’s front door until it opens, Sherlock glaring at the person who dared disturb him during the middle of the night.  It seems that John has caught him on one of his rare sleeping nights—Sherlock’s hair is endearingly messy and his night clothes are adorably rumpled.  He’s wearing John’s rugby jersey and it looks so distractingly cute on his thin body.  The glare Sherlock is shooting his midnight visitor, however, is anything but cute.
John does frown at that.  He doesn’t quite like the feeling of coming in second to an inanimate piece of anatomy.  “So why are you talking to me now?” he asks, more than a little petulantly.
“Oh, right,” John said with another sheepish look and a sideways grin.  “I had to name him.  I wanted to wait, but everyone was pretty adamant that he be called something other than ‘Baby Boy Holmes’, and I knew how much you had liked that name, and that it was the only one we could semi-agree on….I—I hope you don’t mind…”
Vaguely he was aware of Greg’s knee pressing in between his thighs, trying to push them apart so that he could get even closer to John’s body.  And there was a moment where John was so lost in everything that was happening that he moved his legs apart, so that Greg could push closer to him, and his hands on Greg’s shirt tightened as a small moan escaped his mouth, swallowed by Greg’s lips.
Sherlock comes suddenly while John is watching him with no warning, all over himself, just like John wants.  He makes a mess of himself, like he always does, except this time he has an excuse for it, and so John doesn’t mind cleaning him up with soft, warm swipes of his tongue along any trembling strips of flesh that he can reach while he continues to fuck the boy.
John’s smile answers Sherlock’s own and he reaches out to him, pulling Sherlock into a hug against his body.  He’ll never understand how he can feel so utterly happy and content with his life.
But John also knows that there is a reason for it.  There must be—Sherlock never does anything without a reason.  And from the fading bruise on Sherlock’s face (which must be the explanation for why the teen has spent the last few days avoiding John) the man can guess what exactly that reason is.
Sherlock twirled to face him then, long over coat still on because the brunette man hadn’t flipped on the electric breaker for the building yet.  “It’s ready now, John,” he answered the blonde man, an unreadable look in his sea green eyes.
John would have been worried if Sherlock didn’t have a history of such unusual behavior in the past.
John helps Sherlock up and confirms that the bruising isn’t just concentrated on his face.  The brunet winces and draws in a sharp breath at the pain of being moved.  As John half drags him to the car, he notices Sherlock wrapping an arm around his stomach and he seems to be favouring his left leg slightly.  John takes him to the passenger side door and sits him carefully in the seat.  The interior light of the car isn’t enough to get a proper look at his face so John moves to go to the boot, where he keeps the kit with the torch.
“Hold yourself open for me, Sherlock, just like this,” John says, voice gone dark and husky, his free hand moving to position Sherlock and show him what to do.  “I’m going to spank your little hole.  If you’re good for me, Daddy will kiss it afterwards and make it feel better, all right?”
And finally, he took John to the nursery, the room that he had spent weeks trying to decide how to build.  It had been the last room the construction crew had worked on, adding on to it continuously after that day that Sherlock and John had argued in it, and it still smelled of new furniture and fresh wood.
