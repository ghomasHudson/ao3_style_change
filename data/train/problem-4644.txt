job to punish you, remember? When you give that to me, you can let it go and not worry about it. Alright?”
“Ahh, so good!” he cried. A jolt went through his body as Cas thrust into his prostate and he wailed out his pleasure.
family, and…” The last bit was probably obvious, but he needed to say the words and make it real, “I’m bisexual.”
wasn’t obvious at all. “You know you don’t have to leave, too, Dad,” said Dean, allowing himself to be led away from the party and through the empty set.
Dean shook his head. “I’m fine, it’s fine.” Crawling up on his hands and knees, he kissed Cas to show there was nothing wrong. “It happens sometimes.”
Sucking in a breath as Cas entered him, he let it out slowly, counting the beats of his pulse, while the alpha worked up to a fast pace designed to get him to knot as quickly as possible. They always ended their day by falling asleep knotted, it helped them both to sleep better, but usually, Cas would get Dean off first, then wrap him up in a condom while Cas got his knot so there wouldn’t be a wet patch on the mattress to avoid while they slept.
Like a true brat, Dean leaned back in the seat and stretched, making a face that was far more orgasmic than yawn, as he dragged his hands along his thighs and up his chest in a slow sensual caress. Castiel’s eyes followed his every movement and he growled again, tugging at the makeshift cuffs. He could easily pull the tie free using his mouth, but he didn’t, so Dean knew he was enjoying this little game as much as he was.
When he was set back on his feet, Gabe pulled Sam by the hands. “Come up to my room,” he said, his excitement tempering his seductive tone a bit. “There’s something I want to give you.”
He crossed his arms again, standing up to his full height and taking total advantage of his unusual build. “To delete the pictures and videos you have of Cas. Apologize to him and never contact him again. Or else.”
Dean: Hey, guinea pig… My allergies have been going haywire this week and I had this idea to try my mom’s old soup recipe from when we were sick as kids. It says it’s good for anything from hangovers to the common cold so I have high hopes. But I made, like, a ton of it. Interested? I could drop it by your place, if you want. Unless you’re afraid I’m a serial killer.
He looked up, only moving his eyes. “It does?” he murmured, his voice slightly muffled. “I thought…”
With that encouraging him, he reached for his belt and started getting out of his pants. Cas sat up and stripped off his jacket, then helped Dean pull off his jeans and underwear before draping the blankets over his back, creating a warm cocoon for them.
This was Castiel’s beloved. A beautiful and proud omega who chose to submit to his daddy, knowing that every one of his needs would be taken care of in return. With Cas, Dean could trust that he was safe. It didn’t matter if he was wearing the most expensive of gowns, his jeans and flannels, or nothing but come dripping from his naked body. He could be absolutely filthy and this man would still want him, would still care for him, would still…
“Are you ready, beloved?” he asked, his lips against Dean’s jaw, tracing an electric path down his neck, which the omega instantly stretched out for him.
“Shhh,” Cas breathed in his ear, barely audible, each puff of breath tickling him. “If you make too much noise, the priest might come check on you.” He gave a firm stroke with a twist at the tip. “And he’ll see you like
Looking down at where they were joined, Dean experienced another moment of regret that he didn’t have a knot. Come was already beginning to leak out around the sides without that natural biological plug. But that sparked a moment of inspiration.
“That’s right,” said their executive producer, Lee Webb, walking up with a big smile. His secret nickname around the network was Bloodsucker, as his outwardly easy-going personality hid a demon-like ruthlessness inside. “You’re the consummate professional here, Winchester. Teach Mr Novak all you can, the future of the show is riding on you both!”
The sky was lightening by the time Cas was driving Dean back to his car at the overlook, again in dead silence. Once they were past the ranger station, Dean said in a flat tone, “You can just drop me off here. I’ll walk the rest of the way.”
“You’re new to this, so I don’t know if you’ve ever studied the craft of acting or if you were scouted and are just winging it.”
“I didn’t even recognize him at first,” said Sam, looking at Dean, still in shock. “What’s with the dress? Are you trying to make him more like a woman?”
“No, not camping,” said Cas, grinning at the thought of surprising the omega. “And I already told him.”
Castiel’s good hand grasped Dean’s chin and turned his face toward him. “Hey,” he said, his voice firm. “I can tell you’re trying to punish yourself in that head of yours. That is not for you to do, do you understand? You do not take something that belongs to me. It’s
He wondered where the alpha was, his apartment was empty and the first streaks of dawn were beginning to touch the horizon. Was he out meeting someone else, wanting to forget Dean as quickly as possible? Was his warm body wrapped around someone else right now? It brought tears to his eyes, but he blinked them away. He didn’t want to meet Cas like that, with bloodshot eyes pathetically crying and begging him not to call things off. He wanted to stand on his own two feet and say goodbye like a freaking adult.
“I was hoping this would make you happy,” said Cas, returning the hug and kissing Dean’s jaw. “I got the recipe from Sam so we could reinstate the ‘pie for breakfast’ rule.”
Turning his head, Dean looked down the little hallway to his front door, where he hung his coats on a set of hooks on the wall. A leather jacket hanging there flooded him with guilt and memories. He could still remember the first time they’d met more than six months ago; he didn’t think he could ever forget, considering all that had happened.
“Really, really great job today, guys!” he said. “You were in rare form! Because of this, we’ll get the finale done under budget.” He lowered his voice and added, “Which we’ll put toward the after-party, otherwise the network will expect us to make do with less money next season. Best not to set unrealistic expectations.”
He did as he was told, stretching his legs until he was on his toes, tilting his backside up as much as he could. Cas held onto Dean’s hips and plowed into him, jerking him back to meet each rapid thrust.
That wasn’t in the script, but Dean had told him to just act like he normally would in this situation. This wasn’t ‘Tom,’ this was
Dean touched his cheeks with his free hand. “My face is starting to hurt from all this smiling. You make me too damn happy.”
For the season finale, Rami went back to Heaven to speak with his superiors while Bast traveled to a convent that would be the site of the last seal’s breaking during a lunar eclipse. Because of the sensitive timing, they had to split up. Rami didn’t want to leave Bast with Rubicante, suspicious of her continued involvement, but he felt their path to Lilith was much too smooth and he needed information from what he felt were more reputable sources. The angel told them to go on ahead to the convent and he would meet them there later.
“I would have yelled for you to let yourself in, if that were the case.” They both knew you didn’t leave milk unattended, that was just asking for trouble and a big mess to clean up.
“Well…” He put the bowl in the sink and muttered, “It’s probably available on streaming.” Maybe he wouldn’t mind watching it if it was with Castiel. Returning to him, Dean took the bottles. “Okay,” he said, going to the recycling bin, “I had an idea. We’re going to the Farmer’s Market in the morning.” They left the kitchen together and Dean shut out the lights. “Why don’t you spend the night? You can sleep in my room and I’ll bunk down on the couch.”
In a stunned kind of daze, he allowed Castiel to help him out of his jeans and underwear before he was guided down into his lap, straddling his legs. Reaching down between his spread thighs, Castiel’s first two fingers found his wet opening, sinking in with a lewd sound that seemed too noisy in the quiet closet. His other hand pushed up under Dean’s shirt, finding one nipple and teasing it with little twists and flicks.
Predictably, each door to the back-to-back clubs had a line that streamed around the block. Dean maybe felt a bit smug as they parked in the VIP valet area and waltzed right up past the line with their tickets.
Dean sighed, having predicted the level of kick-back this would cause. “You broke both your legs in a car accident! You wrapped the Impala around a tree! It’s
“Yes, it is.” He reached over Dean’s lap and unfastened his seatbelt, then cold hands were taking his and gently pulling. “Step out.”
Dean wanted the earth to open up and swallow him. But the hit to his ego had resulted in a flood of support. All the replies to the clumsy tweets were about how the fans liked him even more for his faults and how cute it was.
Leaning in, Cas kissed him thoroughly. His eyes had twice the amount of sparkle when he pulled back. “I’m so happy.”
the Cage and Bast knew from experience, he couldn’t make an archangel do anything he didn’t want to do.
Looking over Bast’s half-naked body, Ramiel licked his lips thoughtfully. “We… might be able to turn this to our advantage, if we do it carefully. But it all depends on you.” He picked up the clothes that had been haphazardly thrown on the ground and started handing them over in the correct order so Bast could get dressed. “We were going to have to fight our way through Purgatory to Hell’s ‘back door’ and then fight our way back out once we find Jedediah’s soul. But if you’re a demon, you’ll have abilities in Hell. You’ll be able to tell where he is. Hell wouldn’t demand a price of equivalence for removing him. You might even be able to open a direct doorway to return to Earth.”
Ending the call with a sigh, he shoved the phone deep in his pocket. His feet heavy, his dragging steps slowed then came to a reluctant halt. Despite knowing that he was long gone, Dean couldn’t help looking over his shoulder. More tears were stinging his eyes and he tried to blink them away; he had to get used to the idea of holding back these emotions at work, but just then he couldn’t help giving in. His inner omega was in mourning.
“Listen, he’s going to be fine,” Dean repeated what Cas had said, crouching down in front of her and patting her leg in a manner he hoped was comforting. “What’s his name, do you know?”
“Don’t play dumb, it’s not cute,” Dean snapped. “I have no intention of letting you ruin my life this way, so tell me what you want in exchange for deleting the video. I’ll do anything.”
“You’re so damn beautiful,” he said, bringing the hand he was holding to his lips. “Opening up for me, giving me your gorgeous body… I just want to make you feel so good.”
“Are you sure you should be walking around, alone, at night?” Novak called from behind him, but his tone was cold, rather than concerned.
Sitting back a little more, Dean pulled Cas in to straddle his lap, knees on either side of his thighs on the bed. When the alpha attempted to rut their mutual erections together, Dean tweaked one of his nipples, effectively making him go still as he yelped.
“He was the only pet we ever had,” said Dean. “He deserved it.” He aimed his thumb behind them. “Sure you don’t want the face paint? You’d make a cute fairy princess.”
“Sweet daddy,” said Dean, leaning his head onto the alpha’s shoulder for a moment, “I appreciate that you’re thinking of my needs as always, but I’m definitely not starving.” He still remembered what that felt like. “Besides, food tastes better when you’re at least a bit hungry. And I like a little room for dessert.”
While the wedding party took photos, everyone else would be seated and enjoy appetizers instead of having a cocktail hour. The photographer’s assistant was going around and asking the guests to give a message on a video camera as a kind of watchable guest book. There was also a floral archway to serve as a ‘selfie station,’ a nod to the bride and groom’s modern sensibilities after making so many concessions to the traditional-minded in-laws.
“Just a second!” Dean yelled toward the door then whispered intensely to Sam, “Dude, you can’t do this to me! You’ve gotta let me figure this out on my own!”
That was debatable, but Dean didn’t say anything. “Can I ask you a question?” he said as he handed over the cash.
Dean only had to force his smile a little bit. He wondered just how much Sam had told Novak about his knowledge of the show and hoped he hadn’t talked about the ‘Book of Destiny,’ which was what Dean called the binder with his notes on the show’s complicated interweaving plotlines. He knew it was nerdy, but it was the only way he could keep it all straight! It also meant that he understood the continuity almost better than the writers themselves.
But now, he couldn’t seem to stop listening for that deep, velvet-on-gravel voice, or keep his eyes from searching the set, seeking out one particular person, wanting to see each new facial expression, and following his every gesture. It built up in Dean’s chest, refusing to be let go. The more it pooled in his heart, accumulating like autumn leaves, the more it buzzed, making him anxious. Twitchy. Curious.
“Thanks,” Adam said, shaking Dean’s hand and coming in slightly to pat him on the back. It showed a lot of trust on his part and Dean smiled warmly. “Its taken some getting used to.”
He bit his lip. “I guess, technically, yeah. I didn’t take much, I wanted to get in and get out pretty fast. It was a beta family, so I knew they wouldn’t smell me, but I was worried about the dog.”
him. Just for one heartbeat, Dean could believe what Cas was always saying… that he was perfect. That
Then Dean was being pushed, face-first, against the wall next to the shower, pinned like a butterfly with a strong hand between his shoulder blades, while Castiel’s other hand worked his underwear down from his hips.
Sam looked up immediately at the sound of his brother’s voice and did a double-take when his eyes skipped over the tall man in the red dress at first. He stood up slowly, slack-jawed. “Dean?” he said as if he couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing.
“That’s a pretty common assumption,” said the nurse. “You’re going to be just fine. You’re in good hands.”
“I was really pleased to get cast on your show,” Novak said. “And we’ll have so many scenes together!”
A little warily, he took it, holding the handle and trailing the fingers of his other hand through the flails. They were a bit wider than the short, stinging flogger Cas had once used on him during his training to test his pain tolerance, and so much softer. It seemed to be of much better quality than the other one.
He startled, almost as if the words had struck him and for a second Dean worried that he’d stepped over the line, but then the alpha nodded. “Okay. I’ll think about that. Thank you for being honest with me.”
Dean smiled at all of them and nodded his acknowledgment. “Give him my ‘regards’ as well,” he said, reminded of his earliest messages between himself and Castiel. “Thank you for coming. I know it’ll mean everything to Cas that you’re here.” He took the flowers from Gabriel and began unwrapping the paper. “Now, here’s what I’d like to happen…”
“Well… no,” he admitted. “I don’t have a whole lot of time for reading. I’ve been meaning to listen to more audio books, but in this case, Sam told me about them. He likes Words and Quality Time, so I learned to talk about feelings more. Took me a long ass time before it didn’t feel incredibly awkward and I still make jokes when things get too feels-y. In fact, that might be how we came up with the Jerk-Bitch routine.”
“Ah, you can’t lie to me when we’re like this, Dean,” he said, rubbing his fingers oh-so-lightly around his prostate. “I can feel your body clenching around my fingers. It’s honest even when you’re not. Why can’t you be honest with me?”
Dean knew what he wanted. He really was a bastard. Two could play at this game, though. Sitting up a little, he reached down and dragged his nails through Castiel’s dark wavy hair, curling his fingers around his ears and encouraging him to look up again. Dean ran his tongue slowly over his bottom lip and delicately furrowed his brows together, giving his best vulnerable but sexy look.
At any rate, he ended up with plenty of time to put the finishing touches on the surprise before he had to go pick up Cas. When he went back to the apartment, he opened the door to… his own scent, amplified. It hit him a second later.
Dean’s party was escorted directly to the heavenly VIP section, which had been reserved for just their party tonight, a gracious move on Mike’s part since it meant that Luce’s VIP section would be getting all the love from the regular guests. The room was more like an up-scale lounge than a club area, with throne-like chairs, a huge sparkling crystal chandelier, the harpist playing classical music, a mural on one wall that looked like something out of the Sistine Chapel, and more gold than a rap video.
“Thank you.” He squeezed Dean’s hand. “As for right now… I’d like to help you with prep, so I can start learning your work habits. Then you can take me back to my car.”
“Teeth?” he asked, baring them in a grimace. They’d both been enjoying some appetizers during the pie-making.
“Not really, because it won’t change how much I love them.” He shrugged. “I’ll just help them deal with it as best I can.” Dean toyed with the wrapper of the muffin, a little half-smile on his face as he thought about the future of his pups. “I hope if either or both of them are alpha, that they turn out just like their daddy.”
“Up,” he said, reaching for another condom. “Face me and crouch.” He rolled the latex over himself then swiped his hand through Dean’s come and used it to lube his cock. “Impale yourself. Do it slow. I need to get properly sick of you.”
“Do you feel that, Dean?” Cas asked, his voice gone slightly breathless. “Do you feel what you’re doing to me? It’s you doing that, making me want you. Can you smell how much I want you?”
Lifting a brow at him, Cas said, “I think Dean is being a little generous in his details. I definitely pressed my advantage on him.”
of a lot more than Coltcest.” He glanced up, seeing Castiel’s confused expression, and shook his head. “Nevermind. You know how I told you the fans referred to me as ‘Glitter’ because of my freckles? Well, now they’re calling you ‘Gold’ because of the color of Ramiel’s grace. So, together, we’re Glitter and Gold. Pretty cute, huh?”
Dean frowned. He still wasn’t sure. “I’d offer to come with you to give support when you have to face him, but my presence would possibly make things worse.”
“It feels like you might be about to come already,” said Cas as Dean’s moaning got louder. “You can if you want, but I still have a long way to go.”
Dean walked around in a circle and dipped his face into Castiel’s line of sight. “I dunno, Cas, am I?”
“Not yet,” he said, moving his body in a slow, sensuous roll. “I wanna stay… just like this…” Ducking his head down, he pressed his lips to Castiel’s. “Love you,” he said and kissed him again. “I love you.”
Angel Eyes chuckled. “I’m not sure if that would be a good thing or a bad thing. Besides…” He thumbed the rim of his glass before glancing back up, hitting him with that blue gaze all over again. “I don’t know if I want them coming around here. Maybe I want to keep you all to myself.”
Dean placed his, palm-up, on top of Castiel’s outstretched one. He swung the flogger in a rotating motion, letting it fall on top of their joined hands. It didn’t hurt, not at all. Instead of a short, quick sting, this flogger fell a bit slower, with more of a thud.
“I am happy,” said Dean, his voice rough and a bit wobbly. “You just caught me off-guard.” Leaning back in the embrace, he allowed Cas to see just how vulnerable he’d made him, with tears shimmering in his eyes making them look like green sea glass. “I love you so damn much.”
—” Dean clarified, “—but when neither of us is wearing the blockers, you… kind of smell like my best memory. It’s our combined scent that really brings it back for me.”
my firsts, but I want the rest of them to be yours. I can give you my future and I hope that’ll be enough.”
He had been getting better and better at it, but tonight was proving challenging. He wished he could just sink into his usual mind-set, but the fore-front of his brain was keeping him distracted with how what he said or did appeared in front of Sam. It made him tap into his humor as a defense mechanism, even if it wasn’t appropriate. Cas kept eyeing him all throughout the meal, but said nothing until the dinner plates were taken away and the server left to retrieve the dessert tray. Then Cas turned his attention to Dean.
“About ten years before we met, then?” Cas reached for the DVD and looked closer at Dean’s picture. “So, this Dean doesn’t know me.”
Removing his finger, Castiel licked his way back up to Dean’s cloaca and spread the furled pink lips with both hands. More slick dribbled out the way the honey had dribbled on his body.
His knees instinctively rose off the bed as Cas made a high sound in the back of his throat. Resting one of his hands on Castiel’s thigh, Dean gently tilted his cock with the other until it was almost standing straight up. Pressing a kiss to the head, he swirled his tongue around the tip before taking him down as far as he could. Cas moaned, loudly, and Dean was grateful for the insulation in their floor, ensuring that no one downstairs would hear what was going on. Swiping his tongue back and forth along the underside, he slowly drew back up, then back down. Moaning, Castiel groped blindly at Dean’s head, clearly wanting to grab him or his hair but not knowing if he should. His hips would give an occasional jerk as he instinctively wanted to move, to thrust deeper, at one point making Dean gag and pull away.
He met Cas in the living room and spun around, "so how do I look?" Dean chuckled and Cas pulled him close and kissed him. "Like a million bucks." he grinned and the headed up the stairs. "Dean, this is Jess, Jess, Dean." Cas introduced the two real quick. "Hi, it's nice to finally meet you." Dean smiled, "you too, by the way, your baby is freaking adorable!" Jess grinned.
"So Dean, my secretary tells me you've gotten your memory back." The doctor said once he came in the room. "Yes sir. Everything's back to normal." Dean said, "okay, well let's get you in a cat scan to see how your brain looks. Then how bout we take an x-ray of your arm and see how that's doing." "Sounds great." Dean replied and we followed the doctor to the scanning room.
"I-it's the only way to get him to shut up." Dean continued to whisper, "to get who to shut up?" Sam asked and grabbed the gauze to wrap Dean's bicep. "The voice. Dad's voice. I-in my head Sammy." Dean said crying silently. "It's going to be okay." Sam said once Dean's arm was wrapped. "Now, give me your blade or whatever you use to cut yourself with." Sam said, "what?" Dean asked looking up at him. "Blade. Now." Sam said holding out his hand, Dean pushed his glasses up and retrieved the blade taped in the cabinet.
I was only 19 at the time, not turning 20 till July. Dean and I were scared and excited all at the same time. With a wedding to plan and a baby on the way things got complicated, I almost lost my baby but, thank god, she's okay. Mary Elizabeth Winchester was born early but was healthy. Three days after my 21st birthday Dean and I got married and it was the best night of my life. And now we're here, my name is Castiel Winchester and this is my story.
20 minutes later Charlie came bounding down the stairs with a paper bag in her hand. "First off, here." She said and threw a box of condoms at Cas, "you should probably learn to use those." she sassed and then pulled out a pregnancy test for Dean. "Here you go." she said a little softer, and chose to ignore the bruise and brace. "Thank you." Dean said quietly and got up to take the test; a minute later he came out of the bathroom, "well?" Charlie asked. "Now we wait…" Dean said getting nervous.
"Well, Gabriel's about 5 months pregnant, he's having a boy. Sam and Jess got engaged on Christmas. Um, our neighbor Missouri, is the sweetest person alive, she helps us out a LOT. Sam and Jess unfortunately had to go back to California shortly after the accident. Their new semester starts next week." I said "Well awesome for Sammy and Jess. And back up, Gabe's pregnant?! What the fuck happened there? I thought he was on suppressants." Dean asked, "that is a
"Blood pressure looks good, let's take a look at your baby shall we?" Tessa said and Dean automatically laid back and lifted his shirt, "looks like you got a nice bump goin' on." Tessa smiled and rolled the ultrasound machine over, and Dean just blushed. He flinched a little when Tessa squirted the gel on, soon all of them heard the quick 'thump thump thump' of the baby's heart beat. "Heart beat sounds good!.. and there it is!" Tessa said.
“Wow. Charlie’s mom must have really worn him out today.” Dean chuckled. “At least he’ll be well rested for school tomorrow.”
Charlie and Benny left after giving Dean a hug and a few more congratulations. "Dean, where's Sam?" Cas asked when they got back to the living room, "no idea… Probably with Andy or something why?" Dean asked let out a shocked gasp when Cas pushed him onto the couch, "because, I've wanted to kiss you all fucking day." Cas practically growled and Dean could feel his slick starting, "then what are you waiting for?" he whispered and Cas lurched forward smashing their mouths together and he pushed his tongue into Dean's mouth causing the omega to moan and push his hips up to meet Cas's.
“Hey, Charlie and I are going to go out tonight, so it’ll just be you and Henry for a while.” Dean told Cas.
“Yeah, I need to borrow the suburban. We’re going to move some of Charlie’s things and we don’t have enough room.” Dean explained.
"So yearbook, where do I sign up?" Cas smiled, "wh-what? You, you want to be in yearbook?" Dean asked pushing his glasses up his noes. "Yeah, sounds like fun, and besides that's quite a list there." Cas said pointing to the list in Dean's hands. "Okay, um Bobby!" Dean said and Bobby looked up from his computer, "what?!" "Pass me the yearbook sign up old man." Dean said and Cas stopped breathing for a second, was Dean seriously talking to a teacher this way?
"I'll make you a deal. Enter the art show, and I'll buy what ever you need. And when you get there and you start feeling anxious, you can leave." Mary suggested and Dean smiled, "deal." he said and finished his food. "When is it?" Mary asked a little while later. "What?" Dean asked from the sink where he was washing dishes, "the art show." she said, "oh, uh I think it's in January. I have to submit my entry by next friday." Dean said rinsing off the last plate and dried off his hands.
About an hour later, Cas got the pie in the oven, set a timer on his phone and made true to his promise and made his way upstairs to lay down with Dean.
An hour and half later the group met by the front door ready to go party. Dean texted Jo the address for Dorothy's house and they left. When they pulled up to the house Jo and Ash were already sitting on the front steps waiting with a couple cases of beer. "Hey guys, this is Ash." Jo introduced them, "nice mullet." Dean laughed, "hey, don't hate. Business in the front, party in the back." Ash said flicking his hair. The group headed inside following Dorothy, "woooww, nice place." Gabe whistled. "Thank you." Dorothy replied, "um, rooms are upstairs so if you want to claim one and change go ahead and then we'll meet down here and get the party started." she said already heading up the stairs.
"Hey baby, what's up?" Dean answered on the third ring, "Not much, are you still at the mall?" "Yeah, why?" "I need you to pick up enough chicken wire so we can wrap it around the tree like a fence. Gabe said we used to do it when I was little. That way we can put the gates back on the stairs." "That's actually a really good idea. But the way this day is going, I need a beer, so I was thinking we could go to the Roadhouse." Dean suggested. "That's fine. Don't forget my brownie." Dean laughed "I won't see you later, love you." "Love you too." I said and hung up. "I heard something about brownies." Gabe said coming into the kitchen. "Yeah, I told Dean to get me one of those big brownies they have at the mall." I said getting the things to make tea.
An hour, a case of beer and multiple shots later, everyone was pleasantly drunk and they switched to spin the bottle. "kay, one rule." Jo said swaying a little, "no kissing relatives." everyone agreed and she spun the bottle and it landed on Andrea. "Woo!" Benny cheered and Andrea just smacked him and met Jo in the middle and they quickly pressed their lips together. She spun the bottle and it landed on Gabe, once they got their kiss over Gabe spun and it landed on Cas, "oohhh, come here lover boy!" Gabe teased pretending to lean over and kiss his brother.
Dean and Mary entered the dining room and Dean could tell Sam wanted to ask a thousand questions but he kept his mouth shut. After pie, Bobby and Dean discussed a few things about the yearbook and a few of the new staff. "Alright boy, I'll see you tomorrow." Bobby said and gave Dean a quick hug. "You too Bobby, bye Ellen." Dean said and gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek. "I'll meet you two at home." Mary said after her goodbyes and hit the road.
"Cassie, you need to calm down, you're stinking up the car." Gabe complained rolling down the windows. "Sorry, I'm nervous. I don't know what's going on with Dean and if Mary has to come get me then something's wrong." Cas sighed and stayed silent the rest of the way home.
And it'll give her food a chance to cool down." I said walking over to pick up Mary, "sure babe." Dean replied kissing my temple as I walked by. Trying to give Mary her medicine was a disaster, she let me spray part of it in her mouth but the part she had to drink was a battle, eventually after some bribing and many tears later we walked back downstairs. "Awww someone's not very happy." Charlie said when she saw the tears drying on Mary's cheek, "yeah, she doesn't like her medicine very much."
"Mom! Don't do that!" Dean said turning around, "sorry, but it's the truth. I just ordered the pizza it should be here a little after Cas does. Now, sit and be good." Mary smiled, "don't talk to me like I'm Lucy." Dean grumped and sat on the couch and folded his arms. Dean could breath easier now but he was still sore, so when there was a knock and he jumped up he bout knocked the wind out of himself.
"I can't… don't want to do this with out you. Mary needs her father, the twins need their father Dean, come on wake up. Open your eyes Dean!" I don't know how long I sat there crying, but when the tears finally stopped Gabriel came into the room. "Cassie? Come on, I think you should go home and get some rest." Gabe said quietly, I looked up with bloodshot eyes from crying so much. "Oh Cassie." Gabe said and pulled me into a hug, "come on, let's get you home. I'm sure Mary wants you home." I nodded and let him drag me out of the room.
Dean laughed a little, "what are you doing?" he asked but brought one of his own hands down to rest on top of Cas'. "I know we can't feel anything yet, but I just wanted to feel." he whispered and Dean just smiled, "alright you big sap, let's go back to sleep." When they woke again it was 10:30, "christ." Dean moaned rolling over to hide his face in Cas' chest, making him laugh, "come on sleeping beauty. We should probably get up." Cas said pushing Dean's shoulder a little, "noooo, don't wanna." he pouted, "I'll make you bacon and eggs then give you a blow job in the shower." Cas said and Dean instantly rolled over and got out of bed grabbing a pair of pajama pants. Cas laughed, "that's what I thought." he said and slid out of bed and stole a pair of Dean's pajama pants, grabbing Dean's glasses he had forgotten in the rush to get downstairs.
"What? I-I what?" Dean panicked, "it's alright I'll help your get situated then I'll leave you and Cas for some privacy." she said and Cas took Henry so Dean could take his gown off, Cas handed him back and Mary helped position Henry's head, "now, it's going to hurt at first and it'll feel a little weird." Mary said and Dean jumped and gasped a little when Henry latched on. "Alright, now, after about 15 minutes take your pinky and slowly pry him off and switch to the other side. After that he should be done and then burp him." Mary said, "I'll come back in, in about an hour." she said and left.
"Come on, let's finish packing and I say we break in that new shower." Cas grinned and Dean just laughed, "okay. I love you." he said finally looking into Cas' blue eyes, "I love you more." Cas smiled and quickly pecked his lips against Dean's.
“Yes and no.” Dean sighed. “It’s obviously going to take me a while to get over it but I’m done being depressed.” Cas hugged him tighter.
"Oh my god! He's adorable!" Lily, the other girl in the yearbook, squealed. "Thank you." Dean smiled, "he looks just like Cas." Lisa mentioned smiling softly at the baby. "He's lucky." Cas teased and winked, "hey." Dean said and chuckled. "How old is he?" Garth asked, "he'll be a month in a few days." Dean continued to smile. "Alright, alright, I know the baby's exciting an all but yearbook people stay here everyone else just be quiet." Bobby said and shooed everyone away.
"Dean, move god damn it!" I growled and wrapped my legs around his waist causing him to hit my prostate making me moan. Dean pulled almost all the way back and rammed right back in repeating the motion fast and hard. "Oh god! Dean, right there!" I shouted when he brushed my prostate again, Dean changed angels angle so he hit it with every thrust. It only took three thrusts before I was coming again all over my stomach, Dean followed a few thrusts later. Dean maneuvered us so we comfortably cuddling while we waited for his knot to recede. Our breathing went back to normal and Dean was able to pull out so he got up and got a wash cloth from the bathroom to clean my stomach and crawled back in bed wrapping me up in his arms.
"Hey, that's good. It may not be a big memory, but it's still a good one. I remember the waiter gave us a complementary bottle of wine because he saw my engagement ring and I was so nervous that we were going to get busted because I was only 19." I said chuckling "but I have some good news too." I said while getting out of the tub. "What is it?" Dean asked handing me a towel, "some rich guy came into the bakery today and wants me to cater his granddaughter's 16th birthday party. With over 200 guests." "Really? That's awesome, when is it?"
"You're coming with me tomorrow right?" Dean asked once he and Cas were a their lunch table, "of course. Then we can go to my place and tell my parents. They got home a few days ago so they should be back to 'normal'." Cas smiled. "What's tomorrow?" Charlie asked, "my uh… My one month check up." Dean said blushing a little, "ooohhhh! You better show me the sonogram." she demanded and went back to her lunch. Dean leaned over, "I have something to show you." he whispered in Cas' ear. "Oh yeah and what is that?" he whispered back, "you'll see after lunch." Dean grinned and pecked Cas' cheek.
An hour later they laid in bed snuggled as close to each other as possible. "I wish we could stay like this forever." Dean mumbled pressing a kiss to Cas's chest, "hmm, me too." Cas agreed. "But, I have to go pick up Sammy, and I should probably drop you off at home so you can actually be in your own bed and get some new clothes." Dean chuckled sliding out of his bed grabbing his glasses in the process. "I don't wanna." Cas grumped burring his head under the covers, "Cas. Come on." Dean chuckled and yanked the blanked off him, "I hate you." he grumped but got out of bed, "no you don't otherwise we wouldn't be in this situation." Dean said gesturing to his stomach.
"Cas! Let's go or we're going to miss our reservation!" Dean hollered from downstairs. "I'm coming relax." I said coming down the stairs and we got in the Impala. "Now, will you tell me where we're going?" I asked once we got on the interstate. "Nope." Was Dean only response. An hour later we pulled into my favorite Italian Restaurant, "Dean, you got reservations here?!" I gasped and pulled him in for a kiss.
Later that night once Cas was home and Henry was in bed, Dean brought up Charlie. “If not I can get an apartment for her with my settlement money.” Dean explained.
"Hey, how was Bobby's?" "Good, Bobby let me shoot one of his guns!" Sam grinned, "wow, don't tell mom that." Dean chuckled and walked towards his room and Sam followed. "Woah, nice bruise…" Sam said and sat on Dean's bed, "yeah, hurts like a bitch too." Dean smirked, nothing was going to bring him down tonight. "How was dinner with Cas's parents?" Sam asked averting his eyes while Dean put pajamas on, "uh… Honestly, really awkward." Dean said, "really? How?" "Well, first off they are old fashioned and they think omegas shouldn't be able to do what they want. And I don't know, they're just so prim and proper, I felt like if I sneezed they would be offended." Dean said making a face which caused Sam to laugh.
"Ready to go?" Cas asked and Dean nodded. They said a quick goodbye to Ellen and Jo and headed out to their spot, which was just an open field. They crawled up on the hood and snuggled up. "I'll never get tired of this place." Cas whispered looking at the sun set. "Me either." Dean said and quickly hopped down and got his camera from the back seat and took a quick picture. "What was that for?" Cas asked, "for Bobby's assignment." Dean shrugged and put his camera back.
Dean sniffed, “yeah, I have an appointment Tuesday after my check up. “I just… Fuck me. Why does this always have to happen? Just when I think things are going good something
Dean tilted his head to give me more access, "Cas are you sure?" Dean said but let out a soft moan when I bit his shoulder. "I'm sure." I said pulling him out of the bathroom and unbuttoned his jeans. Dean took his undershirt off and began to unbutton my jeans, once we were free of our pants and boxers Dean shoved me on to the bed. I scooted up to the middle of the bed while Dean crawled on top of me. "I love you."
“Never.” Cas spun Dean around to kiss him, which lead him into picking Dean up and setting him on the counter. Dean hummed into the kiss and wrapped his arms around Cas’ neck.
"I uh, um… okay." Dean said quietly the blush crawling up his skin. Dean stood up and just stared back at all the eyes facing him. "H-hi, um so it's pretty obvious what you do in here, but I will warn you, it's harder than it looks…. Um, if you thought this was just an easy 'A', thinking oh I can just take this class, all I have to do is take pictures you're wrong. Uh, this is also the yearbook, so if you'd like to volunteer to work on the yearbook this year, there's a sheet on Mr. Singer's desk, he and I are the editors this year. Um… This class focuses on improving your photography skills, w-we work a lot with photoshop. So yeah, uh. That's it." Dean said and sat down quickly hiding his face from the rest of the students.
“I’m sorry. I wish I could make everything go away.” Cas whispered. Dean didn’t say anything, he just got up to use the bathroom then crawled under the covers and snuggled up to Cas.
"Shit! This fucking hurts!" Dean groaned not caring about cussing in front of his mom, Cas wiped away some sweat. "You're doing good baby." Cas soothed, "fuck you Cas. You're never touching me again!" Dean sobbed and pushed again. "Keep going Dean, keep going!" Tessa encouraged, "I can't, it hurts too much." he whimpered.
Dean, eager to please, took Cas into his mouth as far as he could at the time and held back a gag. “Fuuuuck.” Cas moaned. Cas held onto Dean’s head and once Dean could take more, he held Dean’s head still and thrusted into his mouth. Dean gagged a couple times so Cas stopped to give him a minute to catch his breath. “I’m good.” Dean rasped and moaned when Cas forced his head back down.
They finished eating breakfast, quickly did up the dishes for Mary and got in the Impala. Dean dropped Sam off at school and made their way to the hospital for his check up. "Dean, we can find the gender today… Do you want to know?" Cas asked sliding his hand over to grab Dean's. "Yeah, I think I want to know. Do you?" he asked, "I do." Cas smiled, "it's settled then. If the pup is in a good enough position, we'll find out." Dean smiled and squeezed Cas' hand.
He said, "well, Mary's two now, and my heat is coming soon, and I was just wondering if you would want to have another baby." I whispered looking back down and started picking at a string on the comforter. Dean was quiet for a while and when I finally looked up he was staring at me; "Dean? Say something. Please." I said grabbing his hands. "You want another baby?"
He winked. And Cas growled, tightening his grip and thrusting deep into Dean’s mouth as his instincts took over. Relaxing his throat, he let the alpha have his way, squeezing the base of his cock with his hands, mimicking the feel of his inner muscles. He was rewarded with the beginnings of a knot forming. Letting go with one hand, Dean wet his fingers in the bathwater then reached through Castiel’s legs, sliding one finger right into his ass before the alpha could tell what he was doing.
Both of them shipped the characters as much as the audience did. Castiel was letting more warmth into his lingering looks and touches, having decided that Rami was falling in love with Bast, though the angel wasn’t quite aware of what was really happening. This was his first experience of affection blooming into romance, after all, of feeling more than just kinship or brotherhood. It had happened bit by bit over the season—when Bast shot him a particularly beautiful smile, when their fingers brushed as he handed Rami a beer, as he watched Bast talking with his toothbrush in his mouth—little, unremarkable moments that became extraordinary when it happened to be someone you love. His eyes would sparkle and he’d take a quick breath like his heart had skipped a beat as a slow smile would grace his mouth. No overt dialogue, of course, but all of it was obvious to the fans, who ate it up and dissected every moment online.
The demon hadn’t offered any prep, but as Dean lowered himself down, he found his ass had been magically lubed once again. That was a handy trick, for sure. Even so, Cas felt so much bigger in this position, only taking half of him felt like he was being split in two, but the slight burn was so good. Dean’s legs shook and his thighs would start to cramp if he kept this up too long, but damn, he didn’t think anything could feel this amazing. He gasped for air, the sounds escaping him getting louder and louder by the moment.
“But… no one else should know that!” said Dean. “There’s no way to identify you. Why’s Alfie doing damage control?” He went into the comments while Cas freaked out.
it to hurt. Either way, it’s going all the way inside you.” He patted between his shoulder blades. “Keep breathing, Dean. Long, deep breaths, that will help.”
He froze. What were the odds that they’d be working the same wedding and it was him and not one of the other siblings there? He turned.
“Absolutely,” said Cas. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they ask me what omega finishing school you went to.”
Dean flushed, his eyes slipping down, but he continued on. “Why are you doing this? With me, I mean. Yeah, I’m your roommate and I caused problems, but… you could have handled that in any number of ways. You’re a gorgeous alpha with all your shit together, there’s gotta be tons of people who want to be with you.”
“It didn’t seem to bother you that I was there when you were cornering him at the counter,” Sam pointed out.
When the alpha looked up at him through his lashes, his eyes were still fully red. “I… haven’t hurt you?”
He tried to push past Castiel, but of course, couldn’t move the alpha if he didn’t really want to move. He grabbed Dean’s arm again, his eyes getting big.
Jed was on the attack again, knocking Ramiel back further and further as he blocked on pure instinct, until Jed got him off-balance, landing the angel on his ass for probably the first time ever. The flaming sword spun away, sputtered, and the fire went out. Within seconds of being out of his hand, it vanished without the connection to grace.
It didn’t sound like a question, really; Castiel wanted him to admit what he’d said. Dean’s face flushed red. “Y-yes, but—”
He looked down at the floor. “We had sex very early. She was my first. Before I’d even presented because I was a bit of a late bloomer—they probably thought that this would be the thing to spark my presentation.”
“This is really good, kind of spicy, but soothing,” Castiel said, sipping the warm drink. “What is it?”
“Well, we should be finding out the primary gender at my sixteen-weeks appointment,” said Dean, frowning. “You’ll be back in California by then.”
“I love you being all pretty for me. I’m going to get you more of these,” said Cas, kissing his way along Dean’s neck. “In every color of the rainbow.”
For a second, he thought Castiel might argue he was a grown man and wasn’t about to let someone who was practically a stranger feed him soup in bed, but then he sighed. “Fine.” It was clear he didn’t have the wherewithal to put up a fight.
“You’re sure my Baby will be fine out here by herself?” asked Bast, nervously, as he opened up the trunk and lifted the false bottom that hid all their hunting gear.
“Don’t stress about it, we both have a full work day ahead of us, let’s get through that first.” He stopped Castiel with a hand at his elbow. “Hey.”
“Bast,” he said against his mouth, but he got no response. Squeezing his eyes shut, he pushed Bast away from him with great difficulty, earning an angry growl from the hunter. “Bast!” he said again, sharper. “Snap out of it!”
Cas took him to the next studio over, to Dean’s continued confusion, and it was completely empty with only a few lights on. It looked like everyone had already gone home for the day and it felt wrong to be there, like they were sneaking in.
Cas pulled off of him. “Patience, beloved,” he said, leaning over him on two hands, slotting their cocks next to each other, and rutting his hips to tease them with friction. “Your pleasure is in my care. But I do so love to hear you beg.”
“When we mate,” Dean said, hesitantly, looking away as his face heated up, “when we’re ready to go public… then you can mark me permanently. Until then… just do it somewhere it can’t be seen, otherwise, it could interfere with work—Ah!” He was cut off on a squawk as Castiel suddenly dove down, flinging Dean’s legs in the air. “What—what are you—” He moaned as hot, open-mouthed kisses were pressed to the insides of his thighs.
“It’s been kept quiet,” Sam assured him. “You’re not in any serious danger so they’ve got nothing juicy to print, and Mr Novak kept his jacket over your head when he carried you in.”
Cas kissed him fiercely, taking his lips with a fervor that told his gratitude far better than any words. “I love you so much,” he whispered, his hand behind Dean’s head, pressing their foreheads tight together. “I don’t deserve you.”
“Well, obviously not, if those judgmental asses got my white strawberries! What the hell! They aren’t even a pie place!”
Cas didn’t respond, but the shy smile on his face was all Dean needed to see. The words ‘praise kink’ floated through his brain and he resolutely pushed that out of his head. He did
“I told you the first day, didn’t I? That I wouldn’t do anything cruel to you. And at the time, I didn’t know if you were open to sex with men.” There was that head tilt again, the one that sent butterflies off in his stomach. “Are you?”
“Mmm,” the alpha purred into his ear. “That’s what I thought. Such a naughty boy, getting so worked up over having my cock in his mouth. Are you still hungry after drinking down so much sweet milk?”
“I’d like to meet every one of them and tear their arms off.” The sexy growl was back in his voice, but Dean wasn’t about to let it go to his head again.
He grabbed them and placed them back on his own neck with the clear implication for the alpha to keep his hands where he put them. “No,” Dean said, authoritatively. Even though Cas wanted tonight to be about Dean owning every part of him, he knew Cas was forced to give head so often with Naomi. “That’s not what this is about. Don’t make me restrain you; I know you want to keep touching.”
“I know. It’s a little mind-boggling. Apparently, they spent the Fall heat together over video chat. Gabriel wanted to fly out to California, but Sam said he’d probably get bitten if he did and he wants to follow your family’s protocol. Make a good impression, like I somehow managed.” He paused, a thread of alarm entering his scent, and lifted his head to look at his daddy as a thought occurred to him. “Hold on… will
“True.” On cue, Gabriel held up his phone and turned his back to the couple. “Smile!” he said, holding the sonogram up under his chin. He snapped a selfie with Cas giving a typical glower and Dean rolling his eyes. While they were shown to their table, he spoke out loud as he typed, “Guess who’s gonna be the favorite uncle? Hashtag: Twins!”
Sure enough, Sam called him late the night before Dean was supposed to go back out to the forest location, telling him that the schedule had been rearranged and to go into the studio until further notice. He would be working on the special effects and green-screen shots that were needed until the woods had dried out enough to resume primary shooting.
thing you’re good at.” A muted thud and Cas grunted. “Sucking cock. Go on, then. Satisfy me and maybe I’ll be persuaded to delete those videos.”
Dean trembled and looked away, unable to sustain that powerful gaze. It was the one thing he’d thought Cas would never ask of him.
Cas’ other hand snaked out and captured Dean’s wrist in the air, then he opened his eyes to pleasure-hazed slits. “What do you think you’re doing?” he purred.
“I’m not looking back after this,” Dean panted. “This is his final chance to do something good for himself. He can take it or not, I don’t care anymore. I’ve got a family to care about. And… well, that just can’t include him.”
"Cas…" Dean said his voice scratchy from not using it, "Cas.." he said a little louder and Cas' eyes flew open to see Dean staring down at him. "Dean! You're awake!" he practically yelled sitting up and pulled Dean into a tight hug. "You scared us." Cas whispered after giving Dean a kiss, "I'm so sorry…" Dean whimpered, "shh, it's okay now. You're going to be okay, the baby is okay." Cas said and he felt Dean let out a breath of relief.
"Hey, mom said she'll make us all a nice big greasy breakfast so stop at our place. Just follow Dean, Ash and I are leaving." Jo said and walked out the door. Once the house was cleaned up everyone got in the two cars they took and headed out to Bobby and Ellen's. Dean could smell the bacon as they reached the front door and he walked in with out knocking.
"Hello Claire." I said and tickled her neck causing her to squeal and giggle. "Dean, come to the living room please!" I hollered towards the kitchen. When Dean walked in with half a cookie stuffed into his mouth I rolled my eyes. "Really Dean. A cookie?" "Wha?" Dean asked with his mouth full and shoved the rest of the cookie in his mouth. "Anyway, Dean, this is my twin, Jimmy and his wife, Amelia." I said gesturing to the two. "Holy shit! He's definitely your twin Cas!" Dean said staring at Jimmy and he laughed, "um hi." Dean said a little quieter and shook his hand and Amelia gave him a hug surprising Dean a little. "How are you feeling?" Amelia asked "uh, better… Still a little sore in some places, arm is a bitch though." Dean said lifting the casted arm.
"Uh yeah, about that…" Sam started and rubbed the back of his neck. "Sam?" Cas asked getting nervous, "Bobby took him to the hospital." he said quietly, "what?!" Cas said a little too loud causing Henry to whine.
"Good, daddy sleeping?" "Yeah, daddy's still sleeping." John replied and helped her out of her coat. "Hi Cas." "Hello. Any changes?" I asked sitting down on the other side of the bed and grabbed Dean's hand, "nothing." John said quietly. John and I sat there quietly for half an hour listening Mary tell Dean stories, "mama?" "hmmm?" "I gotta potty." Mary said "I can take her." John said and grabbed Mary's hand. John and Mary left the room so I scooted closer to the bed and ran my hand through Dean's hair. "Come on Dean, it's been almost three weeks. I need you to wake up, I miss you; Mary misses you." I said my voice cracking a little.
I busted through the front door scaring both Mary and Gabriel in the living room. "Cassie, what happened?" Gabe called after me when I stormed in. "Gabriel, please put Mary to bed." I said not looking up from where I was standing, "o-okay…" He replied and carried her upstairs and I started walking forward towards the office. Before I could control what I was doing I started throwing things across the room and started shouting. Gabriel burst through the door and found me in a mess of books and a broken lamp and I was crying. "Cassie, oh god. What happened?" Gabe asked pulling me up and dragging me to the living room.
"When. Did, this happen?" He asked again getting angry, "during homecoming sir." Dean said quietly. "What?! Are you telling me you are a month pregnant!? Castiel, why didn't you call us when you found out?!" Naomi yelled. "I-I didn't think this was a conversation to have over the phone, but yes, Dean's one month today… That's where we were earlier, we went for his check up." Cas said. "You're only a month, there's still time to take care of it." Naomi said, "even though the school and public knows…" Naomi said, "take care of it? Are you suggesting that we terminate his pregnancy?!" Cas asked becoming furious.
Mary was passed out by time we got home so Dean carried her up the stairs and put her to bed and we both passed out shorty after. I woke up at 6:30 with my stomach rolling, I lurched out if bed and made it to the bathroom just in time to puke up last nights supper. "Cas? Baby you okay?" Dean asked as he crouched down to rub my back. "I thought you were done with your morning sickness." "I am. I don't know I guess all the greasy food didn't agree with me." I said and to prove my point I puked again. "Maybe we should just stay home." Dean said getting up to get a cold wash cloth, "no, today's the last day to get pictures with Santa, go ahead and take Mary, I'm just going to stay in bed." I said standing up and flushing the evidence away.
Dean gasped a little and Cas took that opportunity to slide his tongue in and Dean moved his hands to grip Cas' hair which made Cas moan in the process and pull away. "I'm afraid if we don't stop we're going to do something we regret doing in the middle of a hospital parking lot." Cas said catching his breath. "I agree." Dean said also catching his breath, "but nice way of distracting me… But I say we go home and finish this." Dean winked. "Uh, shouldn't Sam be home?" Cas asked, "no, mom has the night shift and Bobby is taking him camping." Dean grinned, "then why aren't you driving?" Cas sassed and Dean started baby and off they went.
Dean was in the process of getting Henry changed into his swim trunks and a t-shirt when he heard the door open and close downstairs. “Dean?” Charlie’s voice came from downstairs.
We were all talking about random things and Mary hand ventured over to her little play area in the living room when the doorbell rang. "I was wondering if they were going to show up." Dean said easing me off his lap and I followed him to the door, standing on the porch was Jimmy and Amelia. Dean and I stepped back to let them in, "hello Cas, Dean." Jimmy and Amelia greeted, "how's Mary?" Amelia asked after a quick hug.
“Amelia. You know you’re violating your restraining order.” Cas said while stepping in front of Dean.
Charlie stood in her room trying not to panic. “Think, think… Where the fuck could a 3 year old hide?!” she said to herself then looked out her window scanning the yard just in case. Then her eyes fell to the covered pool… “Oh god please no.” Charlie raced down the stairs and almost ran into Dean.
He wrapped an arm around her and let her cry for a few minutes, trying to hold back tears himself. “He saw me running and he pulled over and brought me here. The man stopped running after me after your mate put me in the car.”
“That’s fine. Thank you.” he sighed and sat on the couch. With the thought of loosing Henry today, Amelia showing up, loosing the pup and just the stress of everything Cas broke down and started crying, unable to keep it bottled up any longer.
"Wooow. I wanna see them!" Mary said, "tell you what, I'll take you with me when I go to my appointment and you can see them." I said and Mary nodded excitedly and ran off to play. "Can I go with you to the appointment?" Dean asked once I got my shirt back on, "of course you can. Mary come on, let's get you in the bath and go to bed." I said standing up and she whined but came over and started going up the stairs. I shut the tv off and told Dean to follow. "Why'd you shut the tv off?" Dean groaned but followed, "because Mary wont sleep unless she know's one of us is upstairs with her and besides the photo albums are in our room." I said and scooped Mary up since she was trying to run away from the bathroom.
mean you have to do whatever an alpha tells you." Mary said and wiped away the few tears that rolled down Dean's cheeks. "Come on let's go get some pie and go home." Dean nodded and followed his mother down the stairs.
"DEAN!" Sam yelled, "I'm serious Sammy. I'm still pretty lucky considering mom didn't disown me and allowed Cas to move in here when his parents dropped him." Dean said. "I know and trust me, after tonight I don't plan on having sex for a long time." Sam said and his ears turned a little red, "well on that note, go enjoy the rest of your night. I'll take Henry with me when I go and get Cas… Although you might have to help me get him downstairs."
Cas came out a few minutes later and the walked hand in hand towards the Impala. As soon as they reached the car Dean shoved Cas against his door and attacked his mouth; Cas let out a grunt of surprise and Dean took the opportunity to plunge his tongue in his boyfriends mouth. They don't know how long they stood there making out, but some how their positions got switched, Dean was now pressed up against the Impala and Cas was taking the lead. They pulled apart rather quickly when someone honked a them which made them burst out laughing. "We should probably get going." Dean said still breathless from the kissing, "yeah, you're probably right." Cas replied and pecked the other's lips one more time before walking around the Impala.
"Alright, Cas, Gilda, Meg and Sam. On stage we're going to go through No One is Alone." Mrs. Rosen announced and Dean instantly put his painting down so he could listen and watch. Sure he's heard Cas sing but it was just like goofy stuff like singing in the shower or in the Impala with him, but not actually scripted words. Hell, he's never really even heard Sam sing.
"Just fine? I take it that's a good thing then?" Dean asked sounding tired and annoyed. "Yes, Dean. Everything is fine. There's no blockage or tumors. I just have to wait till the blood results come back." I said flipping through channels on the tv. "Kay, well I'm glad everything is fine. I ordered pizza for supper." "What kind?" "Half meat lovers half pepperoni with stuffed crust and a kid's cheese pizza for Mary." Dean said laying back down on the couch. The rest of the night went by quietly and Mary thankfully went down easily; Dean was already in bed so I got ready for bed in the bathroom.
As he ambled back toward the North Dorm, Dean scowled down at the pamphlet. It had a stupid sunflower with a smiley face on it below the words ‘Your Secondary Gender And You.’ It looked like one of those things they handed out in middle school during sex ed classes. Maybe Dean should have paid closer attention then. He threw it into a trash can as he passed by it and shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans, retrieving his phone so he could tap out a quick message to Sam.
