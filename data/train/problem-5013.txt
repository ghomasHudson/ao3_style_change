Dean tensed, and then relaxed at the feel of Cas’s cock inside him, stretching him to the brim. Castiel was slow to start, thrusting into him slowly, again and again, driving them both to the point of no return. He could feel Dean’s inner muscles tense as he came again. Castiel leaned forward, sinking his teeth into Dean’s exposed neck,
His solid gold gaze fell to the giant hottie sitting in one of the booths in the back of his bakery, his long hair falling to frame his gorgeous face, a hand coming to push his hair back so Gabriel could look at that face a little better. Those long, dexterous fingers returning to the laptop sitting on the table in front of him as he typed away at something or another. A cup of coffee next to him, and
Grandma on speed. “Which
Dean didn’t know how, it felt like mere moments, but suddenly he was in Baby, his Chevy Impala, and then they were at his apartment. He had decorated his house a little with pumpkins and streamers, a little gothic, a little scary. He loved this time of year. But right now, he didn’t give a damn if his house looked stupid or a mess, because the gorgeous guy’s hands were on him, each and every touch setting his nerves of fire, making him quiver with excitement.
“Cas!” Dean cried his name with a moan, feeling the heat ignite with a searing pleasure that coursed through his bod. He convulsed with a cry of pleasure. Castiel fed in his release, sucking harder and stretching Dean open for his later invasion, forcing his thighs open with his shoulders as Dean tried to shut them, screaming his name.
easier,”
“Oh, this is going to be fun,” his grin caused worry to Castiel’s heart. He reached forward in haste, in an attempt to push Gabriel out of the way, but the sleeping Sam was much quicker.
be more. It fell short, and that made Cas worry. As soon as he was able to, having fed Dean as much of his magic as he could, he reached down and scooped Dean right up in his arms. Cradling Dean close to him, he made his way into his home.
“Dean, how are you feeling?” Castiel asked, leaning back against the pedestal. This was so unlike Dean, he was usually so subdued and calm, he never got so close to him – not that Cas didn’t
Dean could not be dead. No way.
It was fucked up that even the bar he ended up at was boring, the crowd was too drunk, dressed in all sorts of skimpy outfits, the music was too loud and he had no one to celebrate with. God, he should have just stayed home and watched horror movies or some shit. Tonight was looking to be a bust. Though he had repeated offers from anyone who came passed him, for some reason he had turned them all down.
“Yeah, I’m almost done,” Sam replied, not saying anything about the nickname. Gabriel always used a new nickname for him every day, he had just gotten used to it. He had that puppy dog look on his face, silently asking if it was okay for him to stay just a little bit longer. Gabriel let out a breath; Sam really was working himself to death nowadays.
Cas. How else would she know? Was she actually able to help them? Did she have what they needed? A way to summon the Empty and get Cas back? Or had listening to Gabriel only led them down a pointless path? That dumb ass archangel was a bit of an asshole when it came to things like this. Dean could appreciate the pranks, they were always awesome when they weren’t solely on him. But if he was making them do a god damn stunt or some shit, he was going to yank that fucker out of Sam and gank him.
The clouds were coming together and overtaking the beautiful starry night sky. This would do well for her escapade. She had a plan, she had a mission. She needed to find the All Seeing Eye, take its powers, and then she’d rule the kingdoms. But she had to find it first. And that was proving difficult.
“I don’t know,” Castiel replied, forcing himself to not think about the fact that Dean was giving him
…but wait…there were two of them?
He instead pressed a kiss higher up Dean’s hips, moving up to his chest, his collarbone, his neck. Smattering kisses on his warm skin. He wasn’t surprised when Dean’s arms wrapped around him, hauling him up the resto of the way on top of him. Cas let out a yelp, but laughed as he straddled back over Dean’s waist, legs on either side of him. Dean pressed a kiss on his nose, seeing him huff and roll his eyes.
Goodness gracious, this year has gone to hell in a hand basket. And hey, we still have one more month left before 2021 graces us with a whole other year of...stuff.
And I really didn't want to, or expect to.
Dean groaned, nodding in agreement, arching his back into Cas’s magical touch. It wasn’t all that rare that they’d massage each other, but it was usually Dean massaging Cas – he loved being able to touch Cas all over, making him moan and groan and sound so pretty. But Cas had a way with his hands that seemed to immediately soothe Dean in mere seconds. He panted softly, struggling to contain his voice, taking another gulp of his drink as the heat of Cas’s body warmed him up.
Cas’s cheeks tinged a deep red at the thoughts running through his head. Though Gabriel had done a good job, in Castiel’s mind, Dean would at least be shirtless, the ropes would be silk and the chair would be wide enough for Castiel to straddle Dean…
Oh and there were those nicknames, they always gave him hope, like starlight in the darkness. Sam would never be able to have something like that, he was not there yet.
“There’s no harm in trying, right?”
Dean was not drunk.
Dean nodded, not really knowing what else to do at that moment. If...if Sam believed that was Gabriel, then Dean was...probably going to believe him too. Right? There wouldn't be another bullshit agenda they would have to stop now, right? Jack wouldn't do that to them, would he? They had been scorned so many times before, he wasn't sure what to believe.
Clutching on the bedspread beneath him, dragging the material from its sides, his green eyes fluttering open to stare at the beautiful Cas’s face. He watched as Cas stood back, stripping his shirt and undershirt off. His chest was surprisingly muscular, but Dean had soon lost all interest in his chest as he watched Cas’s hands move to his jeans. He watched breathlessly as the black material slid down his thighs and legs.
“Okay, get them to the cabin. We need to figure out what—” Castiel started to say, but then Gabriel heard a few more weird sounds, followed by something that sounded a lot like Dean and then a whole lot of crashing before the phone was suddenly cut off.
"Win-ches-ter," Dean frowned, a little bit insulted. "It's not that hard to say."
“Hello Dean,” Cas’s deep voice said from the door. “You’re home late,”
“Just the usual,” he moaned again at those magical hands. “Asshole douchebag made me work all night, I was ass deep in his fucking car all night trying to fix it,”
Victor stumbled back, bumping into the stalls behind him as the others wondered back to what they were doing.
into the back of his head, under lock and key. That was
something he was going to think about. Nope, not right now. After all, he had more pressing matters to worry about right now.
Try not to think of Ron Weasley.
Dean let out a low chuckle, he knew his baby was perfect for him. But he also knew, if Dean hadn’t taken a shower, the probably wouldn’t be doing even this. But it was all appreciated.
He sucked in a breath, oh dear
known as a trickster – he looked down at the rich golden colour of the tea and took in the sweet peach like scent.
Castiel’s astral projection returned quickly back into his body. He shot up, sucking in a deep breath as if he had just come out of water and was trying to catch his breath. Dean got up next to him, looking at him with such alluring bright eyes. Brighter than usual, Cas noted. They were usually so lovely and beautiful to look at, but there was something different about them right now, something almost hazy.
dragged him out of hell, after all. Maybe he had…had he left a part of himself inside him? Was that what he meant by
Fuck, Dean was so hard now, he wanted Cas so badly, but it was still too early. Cas liked to make him wait, he enjoyed torturing him, there was so much more yet to come.
“Done!” Sam exclaimed, breaking Gabriel out of his thoughts.
Dean Smith stared at his reflection in the mirror and let out a long sigh.
“Cas…I like that,” His grin was wide as he helped Dean out of the club.
“Shall we go?” he asked, holding a hand out.
“You let me stay passed closing time again, huh?” he asked sheepishly, running a hand through his hair, wrinkling his nose when it just returned back to his face again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam raised his hands to his chest, letting Gabriel settle against his shirt. The ball of light shuddered a little, but stilled. It pressed up against Sam's chest, before submerging itself in. Sam let out a long breath as he did so, his face contorting a little before falling peacefully into a smile.
“You look so beautiful,” Cas murmured, his entire demeanour transfixed on Dean’s face. “Like a sensual god,”
Ah fuck, he didn't want to unpack
The two sickening lovers had a fight?
Sam looked up then, his eyes a little hazy, as if he were going to cry. But he had a smile on his face. He held the ball of light in his hands, fingers curled around it as he brought it close.
It was funny how one small phrase, one he said all the time, could mean so much for his angel. Cas retreated, leaving him alone. Cas always understood him, and in his own way he knew Dean was not in the mood to discuss the day. That would come later, after a few cold beers, but for that moment, he just wanted to enjoy his shower in peace.
Cas. “And its like a lighthouse light for him,”
Fuck, the guy was hot. He had such amazing dark blue eyes, full, pouting lips, a tall muscular frame hidden under a dark suit. His gaze rose up from the writing on the clipboard and he smiled at the two, making him look even more gorgeous than before, if it was possible.
Fucking dumb ass deal, but he’d yell at Cas once he had him in his arms.
he had gotten from yelling at Cas, to…
Naomi thought harshly, her deep dark eyes glowing in intensity against the darkness that permeated the forest. Have I killed my own stepson? So easily?
Gabriel had already showered him with all sorts of sweet treats, ‘on the house’ he had said, ‘try these so I can see if they are good enough to sell’, and each and everything he had put on a plate was absolutely divine.
Cas raised an eyebrow, but didn’t make a comment. He pressed the bottle into Dean’s hand. “I think you need this more than I do,”
After hiding her eyes from the bright burst of light and stars, Naomi’s gaze returned to the two on the forest floor, she saw Castiel was on his back, eyes closed, unconscious to what was happening. Her gaze rushed over to The Eye, seeing him also on the ground, unconscious.
Dean rolled his eyes. God, the gorgeous man just had to annoy him, didn't he. Dean's last name wasn't that hard to pronounce was it? No one else ever had a problem before, it sounded just as it was spelt.
“You’re no picnic either, short stop,” Dean growled, tugging harshly at the magically tied rope holding his wrists together. “Got to say, I’m getting a lot of ideas, Cas,”
the brothers? Who could have any ill will between them? What did they want?
I'm sorry.
Memories infiltrated his mind, of standing with Castiel, smiling and laughing with him as they worked together to make a potion or cook up a spell for something…or someone. His mind was still a little fuzzy about his thoughts and his past. But he remembered the feelings, the emotions he felt. The way Castiel’s mouth tilted to one side as he spoke, the way his gorgeous blue eyes brightened as he stirred the pots and cauldrons, the way his laugh sounded like lilting bells. The way his eyes had darkened when he got the package signed for ‘Novak’, the way he had signed it with a sigh, the way his body curled in on itself as he turned to look at Dean. The way he had…given up.
His head was aching.
He saw his lovely Dean on the ground before him, he looked completely unconscious. His heart almost stopped, his face drained of all colour. Castiel was quick to his side, muttering a spell and holding his hand over Dean’s prone body.
It made Cas shudder and shiver in their intensity, but he forced that thought right to the back of his head.
No, breathe Sam. He put his bag and books into his bag and slung them over his shoulder.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat as Cas came closer. His fingers were nimble as he quickly disposed of his shorts. Dean gasped as those powerful thighs appeared inch by glorious inch as he raised his leg up and stepped out of his shorts. Fuck he was magnificent.
Please God. Please don’t do anything to his Dean. “Please come back to me.” He leaned in closer, pressing their foreheads together, forcing his magic through their bond, knowing more touch would only help Dean gain consciousness quicker. “I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you I’m a Novak, but
His strength came from the things he created. Though he owned and worked in a bakery store that sold all sorts of sweet and savoury treats to help people, all the way from those who were exhausted and needed a pick me up to those who were dealing with actual life altering problems, like depression and other evil ailments.
heavy with the thought that the last thing he had said to Castiel was a lie.
Dean took the bottle without comment, slow and steadily moving so he was half off the sofa so he could drink. It wasn’t the most comfortable position, but it was the one he felt he was able to do without hurting himself. Cas hummed sympathetically, running his hand over Dean’s shoulder. Without thinking, Dean leaned into his hand, feeling those fingers east along his muscles.
“Yeah, sorry babe. Work ran late,”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas grinned, sweeping a hand down Dean’s cheek, curling his fingers around his chin and lifting his head up. His gaze was like sin. “I know all of your deepest and darkest secrets, you are very interesting indeed, and there is so much I have in store for you,”
But they hadn’t, and he didn’t want to pry until his brother was ready. It must have been a wild ride for Dean to find out that he was in love with his male best friend.
He loved Dean’s eyes, the way they flashed when he was angry, the way the corners crinkled when he laughed, and how they turned to liquid when he gave Cas
Castiel drew his head back, running his mouth instead down the length of Dean’s throat, planting butterfly kisses over his throat, trailing down and latching his mouth onto his nipple. Dean gasped at the sensations coursing rough him. Cas’s tongue was working wonders on his skin; he was so gentle, but so rough. Dean held onto the back of his head for dear life.
I want it so badly,” Dean replied, parting his legs, desperate for more. His hands travelled to Cas’s cock, circling it and squeezing the thick and hard length the same was Cas had done to him. He stuttered when Cas’s fingers started to move inside him, his strokes were long and languid, the pads of his fingertips rubbing against that sweet spot inside him, which made his entire body tingle.
let them go
don’t leave me. I haven’t even…”
is in you?”
“What is this you bring me?” Naomi asked, holding the blade of her sceptre out to the man.
He tasted so much sweeter when he came, and it only made his orgasm all the more intense. Watching the beauty that was Dean, he came with a growl, grasping Dean tight to his body, fangs digging deeper into his skin.
“I ain’t giving you another Perk Up Coffee,” Gabriel rolled his eyes and conjured a sweetened tea for the giant moose. “Try this instead,”
They lasted a week in their reprieve from it all, trying to get back into the routine of things. A week of waiting for Dean to come to him, so they could mourn Cas together. He still hadn’t talked to Sam. And Sam was sure he was still in the denial phase. He was asking to crash into the Empty’s lair after all.
yet…it was strange. It was like he was thinking this, and knowing it, but at the same time, it didn’t matter that he didn’t have any reflexive thoughts. Like he was free to do as he pleased without the repercussions.
"I'm sorry I missed our night," Dean added with a sigh. "Were they mad?"
Sam nodded, once again. "I give you my consent,"
He wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
that happened after. There was a reason why Sam kept Gabriel’s memories in a locked box at the back of his mind after the archangel had died. But…there had to be a reason why his memories came back to him in this moment right? Jack had given them free will, but he was sure Jack was also nudging them forward.
“You feeling good?” Cas murmured, fingers trailing heatedly down high thighs, massaging his thighs, his calves, his ankles over his pyjama bottoms.
Dean looked up at him in surprise, had they met before? Nah, not possible. He’d never forget a guy as pretty as this one before him. He felt like they were the only ones in the entire world. “How’d you know my name?”
Maybe he had been hit with a wayward spell?
Fuck, Dean didn’t even know anymore.
I'm going to do my best to tie up all the loose ends I saw when I watched the finale.
Castiel let out a gasp,
for those smiles, and he wasn’t disappointed.
Dean still came here, every night since, when he knew Sam was out doing an errand, or asleep, or just busy with whatever the hell he and Eileen did on their dates. He didn’t want Sam to see him like this. To see him mourning over something that happened so…so quickly. The whiplash of having him there, having him
Cas growled, thrusting into him harshly, violently, so fucking perfectly, filling him so good. But as soon as Dean was close, Cas relented, slowing the pace. Dean growled, moving against him, craving him. He knew his face was just full of embarrassing want.
He always sat at the corner booth, because this was the booth that was the most comfy, the cushions looked so flat and lacklustre in their plush, but whenever Sam sat on them, he felt like he was sitting on a cloud. The table was always smooth, and every time he placed his laptop onto it, it rejuvenated itself, never lost power.
Cas bit his lower lip, hiding in a breath as he undid the buttons, pulling them out one by one. The shirt hung open, his chest bare, the little trail of dark hair caught Dean’s eye and he followed the gaze to the thick swell in Cas’s tight shorts. Holy fuck. He was so hard and so fucking ready already. He couldn’t wait for the actual sex to happen.
And now he was stuck here –
This had to be something strong, something powerful, something so ancient. So much so that it wasn’t even in Castiel’s spell book; and his book had been passed down for centuries. It had everything, good spells and bad.
Castiel had allowed animals and insects and forest creatures to come in and out of his barriers whenever they wanted to. But only those with pure hearts and good intentions were allowed entry. Nothing evil ever entered his premises without him knowing about it and allowing them. If it hadn’t been a spell, and it certainly didn’t look like an animal, not that Castiel could be sure of that, he hadn’t really taken the chance to see…
But it didn’t stop Gabriel from staring. But, he wasn’t one to just stare at something gorgeous and not try to go for him. And though he had spoken to Sam once or twice ever since the man had come to his shop every day in an intent to stuff his face with ‘Pick Me Up Puff’s and drink gallons of ‘Perk Up Coffee’, Gabriel really didn’t know as much as he wanted to about the man.
Cas slowly came over to him, like a hunter circling his prey.
"She?" Dean asked, intrigued now. "She who?"
Sam reached for Gabriel then, making the shorter mage startle a step back. Fortunately, the ropes only got him so far. He looked down to them, growling almost like a rabid animal, and lunged once again. The chair below him creaked, and before Castiel could cast a spell to stop him, the chair shattered into pieces. Sam got up, rope loose on his wrists. He grabbed onto Gabriel and suddenly, they were gone.
And right now was definitely not one of those times. Before the two mage brothers were two Sam’s and Dean, all tied to the dining table chairs lined up before them. One of the Sam’s was still unconscious, his head tipped back and his body lax as he slept on peacefully. The other Sam was trying his best to Houdini his way out of the ropes – they were magically tied, making it damn near impossible to untie without the consent of the caster, in this case Gabriel – whereas Dean looked comfortable just sitting there, watching them all.
Dean bristled. “What?”
“I think I had a dream like this once,”
a…I don’t know, an out, a way to find out what to do. He wouldn’t just leave his dad in the Empty, right?”
was he talking about? Who was he kidding; he was so flustered around the mage. He was just a stupid little magician; he didn’t belong in the shadows of such a great man.
He'd have to apologise to his angel, he could see a few strewn popcorn here and there on the carpet. He should apologise to Sam and Gabriel for missing out on their annual Halloween fun. He'd do that later, right now he was too tired to move.
The spell wore off with the other two Winchesters, and the other Sam was up, disappearing almost as quickly as the previous Sam had, leaving Castiel with a smirking Dean, who had taken to holding the ropes in a loop around his arm.
“Actually, nah, there wasn’t a Dean,” Gabriel continued. Castiel wanted to slap his brother at the back of his head.
But no, he had yelled instead. He had let his emotions get the better of him and he had yelled at his best friend. At his…at…at the man he loved.
Ye-no, not kiss him. No, he was angry at the angel. Right? Yeah. He was angry that Cas had just sprung all of that shit on him and bounced. Yeah, Dean was angry at him. But if it lead to anything more, he wasn't going to stop hi...
the other Dean before he caused any more problems. However, if
Dean wasn’t sure how he did it, but he got up, drank the rest of the beer and lay back in a far more comfortable position on his back. Cas grinned, getting back to work as Dean settled himself more comfortable, Cas slipped a small cushion on his back, pressing it into the gap between the cushions and the arm rest. His smirk a bit more wicked than usual.
They both fell onto one another, grasping at one another desperately, pressing open mouthed kisses on whatever flesh they could find. A mischievous glint sparkled in Dean’s green eyes.
Her king had tasked her with the job of peace with the kingdoms, yet she despised the thought. Who wanted peace when they could have everything. People feared her, they saw her and trembled at her gaze. She adored her place as the advisor to the king, it allowed her so much, and yet she was always hungry for more. Absorbing the Eye's powers, she would be able to usurp her stupid stepson, and finally take her rightful place as next in line to the throne.
Castiel didn’t sound surprised that there were two Sam’s…
He reached for Dean, seeing him mumbling something to himself. He had wanted to know just what Dean had said, and now he had the chance.
"Alright, so..." Dean cleared his throat, shaking the pain away and standing up straight. "Yeah, that's the dick bag, fuck Gabriel,"
, not Castiel
Dean trembled, though he was thankful the ropes and bonds hid most of it from Cas’s keen eyes. Cas knew all of his darkest fantasies. Swallowing hard, he tried to move away from the blade, though he knew Cas wouldn’t hurt him. He was extremely skilled with that blade. But Cas standing there, in those stilettos and that barely there skimpy outfit, he seemed like a sexy threat – how was that even fucking possible.
Thank you for your support, and kudos and comments and we'll wishes and everything in between.
warmer now that the light was back inside him. That was fucking strange, and it felt…fucking weird, that was for sure. But after the weirdness kinda settled, he felt like his old self again. “It’s kind of like a beacon, or sorts.”
about the Empty, what could this old lady do? But she had known, she knew everything about the Empty —well, almost everything. She hadn’t really told them how they could summon her, or if they
“You saying…” Dean paused, peeling the label of the bottle. “You think he’s like…gonna give us a sign, or some shit?”
People however. Castiel had never heard of any successful instances where the spell to cloning had created someone as a perfect clone. Either they looked completely different, or they were unresponsive. And those were the
him, and not because he was the son of a king.
He didn’t know how long had passed, but there were no cars on the streets and more, and he could no longer see anything outside with the bright lights of the store. This was nice, just a calm, serene moment of him working on something, Sam sitting in his usual booth doing the same. Would this be what it was like if he ever finally asked Sam to become his familiar?
“What’s wrong Dean?”
Victor nodded, reaching out to take the box.
But there had been no sign of Cas.
Dean’s thighs loosened, calves relaxing easily as those hands worked their magic on him. And then Cas moved to his feet again, this time paying more attention than before. He took them one at a time and teasing his fingers between his toes, stretching them out as he worked his knuckles into the pads of his feet. It didn’t take much for Dean to let it all go, particularly when his feet had been aching the most. It wasn’t fun being on them all day long. He was soon whimpering like a baby in Cas’s hold, leaning into the touch, wriggling his toes for more.
Holy mother of god, Dean was going to
His heart ached too, as if there was a large part of him that wasn’t
…oh, holy…mother of…
"Sammy, you sure?" Dean asked, "how can we trust him? He's a trickster, after all,"
His body jolted as Cas’s fingers ran over the arch of his feet.
They had lasted a good week without worrying about any supernatural entities. But god damn it, he needed Cas back. If only to just...have him back. Dean was really missing his low drawl, the one that sounded like rolling thunder and heavy rain...not that he noticed or anything. It wasn't like he missed the way Cas's nose scrunched up cutely whenever he was confused, or the way the corner of his eyes crinkled whenever he was happy. Or the way his hands moved whenever he had his angel blade in his hands. And he definitely wasn't thinking what it would be like to have something
The bright thing zipped around Dean, circling his head, and then ricocheted out into the skies, disappearing to wherever it was he had gone. And then Dean’s body arched up from the grass, skin taut and a gasp escaping his lips. And then something happened that even Castiel couldn’t understand.
As the shirt and trench coat came off, revealing Cas’s toned torso, his muscular arms - that Dean desperately wanted to dominate him in bed now - guided further up on the mattress. Dean wanted to reach out for him, but his hands were tied too close to the railings, not giving him enough slack.
Something wasn’t right.
“Cassie, you gotta help me,” Gabriel said, raising the phone to his ear and not letting his little brother talk at all. Castiel was a strong witch, he had all sorts of strengths and magic, and though Gabriel was strong in his own right, his magic was woven within his things, Castiel’s magic wasn’t.
Victor knelt in front of his king’s advisor, the one who had led him on this wild goose chase, the decorated box held out in front of him.
“I’m offering you an…alarm clock of sorts,”
But now it seemed, with Jack doing that whole 'subliminal signs in the right direction' quip to make sure everyone still had free will real and centred, it was surprisingly easy. The sigils and markings on the ground seemed surprisingly soothing, smoother and more...well, he wasn't gonna say perfect, but they weren't as sloppy as before. His memory of regurgitating the asshole archangels from wherever the fuck they had been, was actually pinpoint perfect, if he did say so himself.
I just want them all to be happy!
Dean had been hit by something that made him act differently. Maybe it was a love potion – not that that was possible to create, no one could create love where there wasn’t any – or an infatuation potion seemed more like it. He wouldn’t rule out the baby duck spells either, imprinting on the first person you see. But he had to find out just
"Gabriel." He stated simply, as if that would answer all the questions he ever had. "He's not got a vessel, because it was destroyed in all realities, so he's like...this is what he can show us without burning our eyes,"
That meant there was something that he was getting sloppy – not wanting to sound pompous, but that was so not likely – or the attack hadn’t been for him.
And wasn’t that a kick right in the crotch.
Writing and doing any form of art is either extremely slow, or extremely painful. I wanted to continue but I just can't keep up with it.
“Will…will this help?” Sam asked, leaning close to the ball of light, watching it as closely as the old lady had been.
He felt something wet and cool on his forehead first, drops of liquid dripping down his skin to the side of his face, pooling behind his ears. There was someone above him, someone who was moving around. He felt the touch next, hands pressed against his own, holding them close to a warm chest, so close he could feel the quick thudding heart beating.
“Yeah, I was thinking the same thing,” Gabriel murmured, reaching into Castiel’s mind while he had been thinking – one of the witch’s strengths that always caused heartache for Cas at every turn. He watched as Gabriel reached for the still unconscious Sam, seeing the worry in his big brothers’ eyes. “What could have done this, any why only them?”
“This is getting ridiculous,” Sam replied, tugging and yanking at the ropes, sparking up bolts of lightning in order to dispel of them somehow. But Gabriel had created the ropes, and unless he
"I'm sorry man," Sam continued, lifting his hands up, following the ball of light as it flitted back and forth in his large palms. Was Sam able to talk to it? "How are you gonna...what do you need?"
"The Darkness, my dear."
Holy…crap.
“You didn’t even see me slip something into your drink, hunter? You’re losing your touch,” Cas murmured, eyes half lidded as he moved around the room, his heels clicking on the ground. Damn it, Dean knew he has seen Cas at the bar! “It’s like you wanted me to capture you,”
Who or what would do this to
Castiel’s gaze roved to the sleeping Sam and he shuddered. Maybe having the
And Gabriel…
Dean didn’t want to argue, but he was in pain and he was aggravated. He swallowed his anger and shrugged Cas off, hand waving at him.
Dean and the awake Sam had – to what Castiel could surmise – had lost all of their inhibitions; well lost them enough to do whatever it was that they wanted to without thinking of the consequences – Castiel was well aware just how much Sam Winchester was fawning over Gabriel, and vice versa, so he was sure
This was just what Cas wanted, the wicked angel playing with the knife, tossing it from hand to hand, blade shining in the barely there light. He looked dangerous.
However, it wasn’t like he had any choice in the matter.
He could almost see the words escape his lips, Latin and Enochian mixed together to make something archaic and powerful, something only he was able to conjure and perfect. He closed his eyes, letting the spell get to work. His eyes shone white, he knew this because Dean always told him he looked eerie yet awesome whenever he chanted a spell that involved his eyesight. He smiled at the memory, but focused instead on what he had to do. Almost like a weaving of an image, he suddenly found himself drawn back to a memory of the front of his home. Of him reaching out to Dean, tears escaping the corners of his eyes, stinging and hot as he listened to Dean yell at him, saying the same thing over and over again.
Time seemed to stop, he was so lost in his ecstasy, feeling Cas’s tongue slide in and out of his hole, deeper and deeper. He blew cool air, scalding Dean’s insides.
It hurt Sam to be away from Eileen, especially when he had found out that she had died. Her coming back as a ghost had quenched an ache he had deep in his chest. Which had been fully lifted when he had finally brought her back to life. Losing her again because of god’s vanishing act had made him more angry than anything else. But she had been waiting for him after Jack had righted everything.
If only he could just…be a bit more braver. In his fantasy, he’d have already taken Gabriel, pushed him up against the table and kissed him until they were so exhausted from it that they would be whisked away into the beautiful aftermath of an earth shattering kiss.
“Gabriel!” Castiel
“Not happening, lady,” Dean growled, placing his hand directly in her face. She wrinkled her nose, but moved back to her seat. There was a small smile on her face when she looked at Dean. “Just give us what we came for, and nobody will get hurt,”
It…it stemmed to goodness, to heaven, to what made life amazing. He had no thoughts of doing anything bad. Or evil. He felt almost like he was a
Dean sat up, shaking himself from his fallen twin. This Dean
coming out of his Sam, and the way said other Sam was straddling over him and giving him the deepest hickey – one that could rival Dracula – and made Gabriel’s already love stricken mind fly in all sorts of directions. Then Gabriel would have noticed his own magic flare up at the melding of their two magiks, the way it actually pulsed and grew as if it in itself had limitless potential. As if, in those few moments they shared their strengths, they could have taken over the entire universe if they had wanted to.
Cas’s hands caressed his body, and even through his clothes Dean felt like those hands were on his skin, trailing up his arms, across his shoulders, over his chest and down his stomach, stopping just where he wanted him. Dean felt goose bumps rise of his skin, breath whisper soft as a moan escaped his lips.
“Get some rest, Sammy,” Gabriel said, letting himself reach out and touch Sam. Sure they had fleeting touches here and there. He knew Sam probably only saw him as a barkeep, or someone who just let him stay late. He probably didn’t know just how Gabriel lusted for him, just how much Gabriel wanted him. As more than just a familiar.
Son of a bitch.
The night was sweeter than it had been the night it had happened. Which didn’t make any sense to Dean. How could the world just continue on as normal. How could every one expect him to go back to his normal routine and forget the one person who had been an integral part of his life for the past twelve years.
“Son of a bitch Cas,” He bit out a groan, unable to move as Cas’s fingers dipped into his loosened hole, playing with different strokes and caressed that made him melt. He no longer knew if Cas was doing this purely to relax him or if he had other plans. “You’re hands are fucking awesome,”
Dean just lay there with his eyes closed, just letting the day waste away. He looked so calm and so serene. As if he hadn’t just confused Cas’s world six ways to Sunday.
The Rifter stood still above the man. Naomi could almost feel the anticipation in the air. Did this mean that that dumb, lowly mage was the ‘All Seeing Eye’?
“Hmm…maybe I should be asking
He reached for the dropped bottle and grunted as he took another long swig of the now warm beer, hoping, wishing and praying that he wasn’t here. That it hadn’t happened. That Cas…
And it needed to be put down.
tone. Tongue trapped between his teeth, he hungrily took in the gorgeous body as his angel came into view. Cas stood before him, looking so dominating, his trench coat billowing like a cape behind him, but under that he was wearing a deep blue, velvety looking lingerie costume, the bra top cut low to his chest, collars high, and his usual blue tie tied around his neck, the buttons undone so that his entire chest was on show. The shorts he wore were tight and so high on his thighs. What really called his attention were the
It was like it didn’t matter!
He had to get to the bottom of this. And he knew just who to go to next.
When the other two looked pressed for more, she continued.
I'd apologise, but...ya'll knew this was going to happen.
Honestly, he should have been more used to waking up in unknown locations. But as his body woke up, he shuddered, taking in the heavy scent of…something…on his nose. What was happening? Looking down, he noticed he was naked. And no, this was not the first time this had happened.
Why did it sound like a goodbye.
"Oh…oh hell!"
With a low animalistic growl, Castiel moved lower, swallowing Dean’s cock into his mouth. It was as if an electric shock passed through Dean, his body arched off the bed. His eyelids fluttered with pleasure.
He looked up at the swirling pattern on his ceiling and let out a deep breath, he waited a few seconds before he drew a breath in and then released it moments later. He had been doing these deep breathing exercises for a while now. It was his attempt to try and focus on what was going to happen, and what he had to do to figure out what was wrong with Dean. And
Gabriel forced himself to not succumb to those eyes, to that kiss bruised mouth, and those pretty pinked cheeks, he forced his hands to stay far away from that head of hair, though he was desperate to tangle his fingers in them and see if they were as soft as they looked.
His struggling only succeeded in moving him from side to side, it wasn’t effective at all. His angel was really good at the rope tying – he panted at the many memories of them playing with ropes. He heard the taping of Cas’s shoes thudding anxiously across the linoleum floor. Yeah, they were in one of the bunkers bed rooms. They had redone the floors because they were easier to clean up, and cheap to replace.
Cas sucked on his head, twisting his tongue and circling the tip, and Dean responded with low groans and shudders, tugging on his binds, wanting to touch Cas, to bury his fingers in Ca’s hair, push his face in further, but he couldn’t move. The binds buckled him back in blissful torture.
“A hunter, all tied up,” Cas’s voice was mocking, deep and throaty. “Aren’t you sick of finding yourself like this? Or…” he took another step closer, still hidden in the darkness, his eyes shining so beautifully bright. “Is this what you truly want, what you truly desire?”
Huh…Cas?
“You’re a lifesaver,” Sam said, taking a sip of the heated tea. He let out a sigh, his cheeks turning a warm pink. He placed the tea down next to his coffee cup and got back to work.
Wait, what the fuck was she saying. What seraph was in him? There wasn’t god damn angel possessing him, was there? Sam hadn’t told him, and he definitely hadn’t been having any blackout or weird moments or some shit like that. Like the way Sam had been when he had been possessed by Gadreel. He crossed his arms over his chest, shrugging away the woman’s hold around his shoulder. Fuck, she was strong for an old lady. “I ain’t got no angel in me,”
Dean threw the last ingredient into the pot on the ground, letting out an internal elation when it burst into a dull flame in the pot, mixing with the other ingredients inside. Rolling his eyes as Sam chanted the familiar Enochian incantations for summoning the trickster dick to the world, he watched on, not wanting, neither needing, to be a part of this part of the shit show.
Dean was too lost in his desire to register what Castiel had asked him, he reached down and pulled Cas to him, kissing him with a boldness he didn’t know he had. A faint blush kissed the apples of his cheeks, partially from arousal and partially because of Castiel. He gasped as thick, slick fingers entered his hole, cutting him off from his train of thought.
Dean didn’t get to see Cas, his
He would have sensed if some otherworldly magic spell had tried to come in through his barriers. It would have been a definite red flag, and if the spell was low in strength enough, then it would have been dismissed there and then as they hit the wall. He would have made sure nothing happened to Dean. So whatever had happened hadn’t been a spell.
to mourn. But once they had taken down Chuck, and everything had been restored, Sam had taken a moment, a long moment, to really sit and mourn everyone he had lost along the way. He hadn't been alone, Dean had been right there with him. But if this was Dean’s way of mourning for Cas, then Sam needed to get him back on the right track.
Well, okay he definitely knew how, he remembered each and every moment
she desired, collapsed into the forest floor, grasping at his head in pain. Naomi watched as the Rifter sunk into the man’s heart, making him stumble into the street. She also noticed that, without hesitation, Castiel leaped into his way, wrapping his arms around the Eye and holding his other hand to Dean's heart, stopping the Rifter in itspath. It shot out of The Eye and up into the air, most likely off to find its next victim.
"Please, Winchester," Charlie pleaded, holding onto his arm and pulling him into the large ball room where people were twirling and dancing about to the soft music playing the the background. "You are my last single friend. Everyone else found their soul mate. I need you here, I couldn't go alone."
“Now the shorts?” Dean asked, knowing he was pushing too far, but Cas nodded and he exhaled. Dean was waiting for the shorts to drop, licking his lips in anticipation. The sound of the zipper unzipping as Cas drew near him again was sweet symphony to his ears.
He narrowed his gaze at Dean, taking on his challenge. "Of course, Dean."
Dean, and he knew Dean
God was powerless. Jack was the new god. He had brought everyone back, he had brought his family back. He had done everything perfectly. Except for one thing.
ones. He bare not think about the
Cas appeared at the kitchen door with a beer bottles in his hands, raising an eyebrow. Dean groaned, looking away from Cas, growling into the cushions. Maybe it was stupid to expect to be alone in the living room, but he did not want to move from his position. He hoped that his face in the cushions was enough of a message for Cas to leave him alone for the night.
"There is no way I'm going to find my match here!" For full emphasis, Dean raised his arms to the elegance of the ballroom.
It couldn’t have been Dean, he hadn’t had his arms out, and neither had Castiel felt his powers merge to create anything that could cause him to be completely knocked out. And anyway, Castiel had an internal protection spell that alerted him to any outward and wayward attacks.
“Cas?” the words were thick in his mouth, tongue working as he tried to voice his want, his needs.
Dean watched as he clenched his eyes closed, trying once again before giving up. His cheeks turning an adorable shade of pink.
Sam forgot how to breathe! He was used to Gabriel being sweet and flirting with him, the shorter man did it all the time after all. But it always sucked him in, every single time, he felt like he was on the edge of a cliff, looking up into Gabriel’s waiting hands. He could either lift a hand up to him and take it, or he could plummet to his death.
, as he yelled at him, accusing him of hiding his hierarchy to the kingdom – Cas
Oh god, he needed to get to the bottom of this, for both of their sake.
...she's back!
“What the heck is that?”
“So, which one is it?” The old woman asked, setting her tea cup down on its saucer the table silently, giving them both an intense look.
– not that I don’t like the attention, big guy,” Gabriel tried, damn it all to hell, he tried all right, but the man was on a mission, and it seemed his mission was to make sure Gabriel had a string of hickies and marks all along his neck and collar. “But we really gotta stop,”
Cas moved over to the bed, cupping Dean’s cheek.
“You’ve got an archangel in you, dearie.” She pressed her finger to Sam’s chest. Sam’s gaze darted down to her finger and then up to her face. God, she was so close. “I just want to know which one,”
Gabriel rolled his eyes again, taking the finished coffee cup and making his way back to the counter. He needed to get his whittling finished for today, Jody was expecting it for tomorrow and he had to make sure it was done for her early morning cup of coffee.
colour. It almost blinded him with how bright it was. He let out a breath, knowing that the thing wasn’t from the old lady, but from inside him. There were thick tendrils that seeped into him from the ball of light, as if it had been yanked out of him and was grasping for a way back inside him again.
“Night Gabe,” he murmured, teasing himself with returning the nickname. Oh, dear lord, that face. It was like the sun rose from its slumber, lighting up the smile of Gabriel’s face.
“Some spell hit you,” Castiel stated, though he knew he was sounding more and more like a robot. But Dean had slowly gotten up and was making his way over to him. Though his footsteps were hesitant, and his head was probably all kinds of fuzzy and probably concussed, he had a look of dazed determination in his eyes.
He sat up, like some weird kind of astral projection of himself coming to life, getting up like Dracula emerging from his coffin. The
Gabriel’s eyes widened, face red, but Castiel could tell he was thinking about it. “Maybe we
He groaned, what the hell was wrong with him? And what was with that asshole who had made him fix up his car right there and then, watching him and telling him everything he had done was wrong. He was the god damn owner of the garage, yet that son of a bitch just grunted and gruffed, making him go above and beyond.
His cheeks burst a bright pink, and sat up a little. Oh dear. He shouldn’t get used to this.
The beer bottle dropped from his sweaty grip and hit the ground with an audible thud, beer sploshing out and staining the demon marked cement ground. But Dean didn’t notice. He didn’t notice anything. Not anymore.
“An alarm clock?” he asked, his voice low and taken by the ball.
Sam reached for it, but the old lady slapped his hand. She handed the bauble to Dean, who reached slowly for it. She pressed it into his hand, curling his fingers around it. It was light, almost weightless, and the swirls seemed to move within the bauble itself.
Wait…
Sam sleeping right now was the best idea. Though the bad Dean was running around the city doing god knows what.
“Think of it like an Castiel radar for you,” she stated in lay mans terms, so both of them could understand. It was the first time she had outright said his name, and it was then that Dean was sure that the ball of light inside him was
Angel of Thurs— so it
Ah, and he would never know. Nah, Sam was going to be a lawyer; he was going to go out there and save the world. He was going to find some gorgeous girl, get married and crank out beautiful babies.
Well, Gabriel was still working on that.
“I…I shouldn’t be here,” The blonde one stopped, turning, and crossed his arms over his chest. “
in hell. God damn it, he never usually cared if people gave a damn about him or not, but today. Well, today was the one day he wanted even just a little bit of attention, and he wasn’t even going to get that.
“Dean,” Sam tried to placate him before he went off on a tangent. “I don’t…I don’t think he
“I…I just had a weird thought,” Sam replied, “Maybe…look hear me out yeah, but maybe we can like summon…
Sam paused, looking up into Gabriel, his complicated eyes, like a god damn a sunflower bursting from the middle and shining on his day, they looked so dark, so dreamy, and so
Sam was his familiar. He had to be. Gabriel could feel it, like a calling. Sam was definitely his familiar. He
The old lady straightened out her glasses, the chain jingling against her earrings as she did so, and peered closely at the ball of light. “That Angel of Thursday did a number on you. It’s pretty big, and that makes my job a
He sighed. He looked like he was trying too hard. But this was as good as his appearance was going to get.
And just like the first time he had told Gabriel that he wanted to be a lawyer, and he saw that smile, the one that made his insides flutter and tumble, made him fall madly in love with the shorter man.
“We’re gonna gank the Empty and get Cas back,”
I am so sorry guys!
Gabriel placed the piece he was working on down on the table, throwing a rag over it as the last sparks of his magic laced themselves to the barely finished whittling. He turned around the bar and made his way over to Sam. He was thankful that it was late, passed closing time – he always let Sam stay late, the boy was always so engrossed in his work that he never noticed the hours waning, but Gabriel always made sure to have him fed with ample amounts of food and drink. – there was no one else in the store other than them.
He didn’t want to brag, but he did think himself a connoisseur of the mystical arts of creation magic. He was strong, stronger than most out there, and he was all by himself, no familiar to help siphon his magic, or keep him sane whenever he tried a new spell or something much more powerful than he allowed himself to do.
It's going to be slow going, not gonna lie, but I hope you stick with me~!
A week had passed. A whole week.
“Do you want me, Dean?” He asked, slowly peeling off the slick cotton underwear.
Dean glared at him, sarcastically saying. "Just call me Dean,"
“Great,” Dean said, with that gorgeous, knee weakening smile. He leaned in close, until Cas was almost bent right over the pedestal. “Now that I’m with you,”
"I'm sorry…" He said flustered, still trying to mouth his last name. It was terribly rude of him.
Cas had hoped they would have spoken about it last night. But he hadn’t expected his last name to rear its ugly head.
What the fu—“Oh god,
to be. He just had to get the giant moose of a man to understand that.
"I'm fine, Dean," Sam stated clearly, his voice holding a smile. "He's...resting? I think, but I can feel him. It's...warm..."
When Gabriel had told them about this place - which was a hell of a trip, by the way. He had sort of
He exhaled slowly, dropping his head forward, running his hands through his hair and down the back of his neck, groaning as the water seeped down his back, a delicious warmth that was much needed. He looked up, letting the hot water spray over his face, a ticklish sensation that he loved to feel. A shower was just what he needed; he needed peace and quiet, no rush, no chaos, no work.
Yeah, he was going to ignore
Then again, Dean was missing his boyfriend. Sam would have been the same if it were Eileen after all, hell he’d be the same if it were fucking Gabriel.
He seemed...better.
"Charming, Bradbury," Dean rolled his eyes but nodded. He couldn't let his friend down.
“It’s like…” She paused, juggling the ball in her hands a little before pressing them straight back into Dean’s chest. Dean let out a breath, feeling a
But that was when he saw the spell coming from the corner of his eyes, a big bright blur that moved with such speed, it had big round, pupil-less eyes, and a wide mouth with what looked like fangs at the corner of it. It zipped through the air and through Castiel’s astral projected body and straight into Dean. Castiel witnessed Dean’s eyes widening as the thing spilled into his chest, he curled over in on himself and gasped out loud. The thing moved straight through him, phasing through him and throwing him back with the force of it.
But right now, all he could do was give himself to Dean. He grasped Dean’s shoulders and brought their mouths together for a sweet kiss. As their lips met, it ignited the passion that blazed between them once again. Dean sighed in acceptance, wanting Castiel again.
Cas leaned back, mischief in his pretty blue eyes. “Hmmm…you have a funny way of showing it, you haven’t even kissed me yet,”
Castiel was suddenly brought back to the present. He let out a breath as his magic receded back to its natural resting place, and he shuddered. Looking down, he saw Dean gazing up at him with worry and wonder in his eyes.
"Bradbury and Winchester," Charlie said, peering at the list.
to happen!
Dean knew what that look meant. He shivered as Cas continued, working on the sides of his chest, fingers dancing almost sensually to the centre.
Son of a bitch.
Sitting there, he forced himself to focus on his work. This was why he was here, sitting late into the night, working, working, working. He was going to be a lawyer; he was going to do his best. He was going to make his brother proud. He was going to make his
Dean sucked in a breath. He felt his fingers twitch and he knew he had to get up from here. Thankfully, it felt like his entire body was slowly getting lighter and lighter as the time passed. Though his reflexes were still so slow.
Sam peered up at him, running his hands through his hair, his dark eyes widened and turning to Gabriel, his smile stretching across his lips, looking just so…
“Open it.”
It was no shock that this small bakery was booming. It was all because of the gorgeous golden man behind the counter. The Willy Wonka of confectionaries.
“He said he was going to be less ‘hands on’ right?” Sam intervened.
I should be able to update more regularly soon.
The plan on getting Cas back was not what Dean had expected it to be.
But what he didn’t expect was to sit down on a hard, but overstuffed sofa in a froufy little house in the middle of nowhere, drinking tea with a lovely looking old granny.
I hope.
Uh…Dean really felt like he must have been dreaming. Otherwise, how was Cas here, when he was supposed to be all the way back in Pontiac? Had Cas come back…for him? His heart swelled at the thought.
He heard the voice next, a voice so sweet and solid, one so perfectly amazing, that it made him want to sigh with relief.
Had...had Jack not brought Gabriel out of the Empty? He had brought back everyone else, there had been this whole bullshit huzzah about how all the archangels were up there in heaven, making everything right. Well, at least that was what Jack had told them. The archangels -- sans Lucifer and Michael -- because, for what he knew, those two had been killed by God -- and Michael ganking Lucifer with the archangel blade.
Denial had morphed into anger when Cas had done that. Anger at the Empty, at the thud, thud, thudding sound of Billie’s fist pounding against the wall. The look on his face, those teary blue eyes, the trembling of his lips. At the emotions lodged in his own throat as he stupidly stood there, shock thrumming through him. Unable to speak. Unable to do anything but watch him.
Fucking hell, no way was that little bit of light the asshole archangel. That...that couldn't be, right? But Sam was looking at it with such...fuck...reverence, it was impossible to think of it as anything else. Right? Maybe Sam knew, maybe Sam could feel it?
"Uh...Sammy?" He started, "wanna share with the class?"
Dean’s eyes narrowed. “He lost his dad, you know, you’d think the guy’d care—”
He looked up to the stars, seeing them spinning out of control. A body appeared before him, looming over him as he slipped into darkness.
Sam had been watching, and he had seen Gabriel looking at him, oddly, admiringly. But he had also seen the beautiful and wonderful creations that mage made, each and every one of his pastries, sweets, baked goods, hot drinks, cold drinks, all the way down to the wooden table Sam sat on…they were all so powerful, so wonderful.
“I require the All Seeing Eye.”
Dean felt like that was a
His magic faltered, however. Their beautiful spiralling melding of magic was siphoning away, separating as if the light was dimming, as if a fire was slowly turning to embers. It was very odd, and completely frightening. His magic had never done that with Dean before. They had unconsciously been sharing their magic, their souls, with one another whenever Dean was over – and he was over a lot – so Castiel knew the way he felt, the way his magic tasted. They were always so close, though in any way buy physically, so whatever had hit Dean, whatever had come through his magical barriers and rendered them both unconscious, it was frightening, it was strong.
Gabriel sighed, seeing that huge back walk away from him once again. What he didn’t notice was the big black ball of light zip through Sam, straight through his body and stop right in front of Gabriel. The little ball looked up at him with those beady pupil less eyes before zipping off through the window and out again,
Dean’s eyes widened as he fought with the ropes, wanting desperately to reach up to his boyfriend and have them speed this whole thing along. Cas grinned, head thrown back as he laughed at his lovers’ predicament.
Task for you.
He wasn’t just going to sit idly by anymore and mourn the death of his best friend, his…his god damn angel. He was going to take down the Empty and get his Cas back.
Gabriel barely heard the sound of his mobile phone ringing in the distance. He was too busy trying to make sense of Sam 2.0 sucking on his neck like his god damn life depended on it.
Sam swore there was some sorcery there, because he could see sparks flying out of those honey whisky eyes. Then he moved his hands in a quick motion and – just like usual – a lollipop appeared in his hands. Sam took it, slightly hesitant in doing so, not because he didn’t trust the mage, but because he didn’t want to look like this was what he had wanted from the beginning.
It hurt Sam to see him like this.
Hello there my lovelies~!
(See the end of the chapter for
to the Empty.
and then walked away as if this was the most natural thing in the world.
Gabriel was so damn sure that hottie in the corner was the familiar for him. He could feel it deep in his bones, right down in his soul. It was like the hottie was screaming at him, telling him to come and bond with him, to take him as his own familiar. They could share their strengths, their magic, their powers – and if Gabriel played his cards right, he’d want to share
He had resigned himself to yet another day in hell, correction; another
“I’m all green, angel,” Dean replied, glad that Cas had asked, but frustrated and wanting Cas to just hurry the fuck up, he’d been hard ever since he saw Cas’s beautiful eyes in the darkness.
He couldn't believe it. He
Gabriel had swapped the open sign for closed about an hour ago while he worked on his latest creation – though majority of that time was him staring at Sam, but that was neither here nor there. Sam hadn’t even noticed the time. He gazed up when Gabriel approached him however, his hazel green eyes wide as he looked around and noticed the rest of the shop was completely empty.
Those lips were trailing over his neck, sucking on his collarbone, and lathing his skin as if he were tasting him. Sweet mother of all that was holy, what was Gabriel even talking about any more?
Cas chuckled, running his hands through Deans short hair, his dark eyes were so damn beautiful. Oh god, Cas was always so handsome, but right now, his angel was so pretty. He had lost himself so many times to those eyes, to that gummy smile. This night was going to be something else, and he couldn’t expect any less from Cas.
right now, like a giant weight had been lifted off his chest and he was flying free. Oh Cas. Beautiful, wonderful,
He turned to his long time friend and huffed when Charlie gave him that puppy-dog look, jutting her lips out into a pout. Dean felt his steely resolve waver.
Wait, what? Dean straightened himself out and made his way over to his brother. "What?"
Sparks lit up inside him, fire smouldering deep inside him. Cas kissed with a ferocity he had never imagined possible.
"...son of a bitch!"
“Oh? Is that so?” She leaned back on the sofa, crossing her arms over her chest, and crossing her legs at the heel. She gave him a look, another one of those long, intense ones that made Dean’s insides crawl. Her gaze fell then, to one that looked worried. “Oh, so you…you really don’t know?”
Blinking, he grimaced at the bright sun and tried to find his bearings. He knew he was outside his home, the barriers were strong – stronger than ever in fact – and that they were pulsing, as if there was something wrong.
I wonder what could happen?
Castiel didn’t know how they ended up wrapped up in one another on the floor under his spell book pedestal table.
Crowley stopped him, holding the box closer to himself again. "I require something in return.”
“So…yeah,” Sam started, whispering and leaning closer to Dean. “You think she can really help us?”
“Cas…what the fuck?” Awake, but not to his full senses, he whimpered when he noticed his mouth was covered by a thick and soft cloth, so his words came out muffled.
Castiel tried again, pressing his other hand to Dean’s cheek trying to push more of his magic into his…Dean. His chanting continuing until it was like white wash humming in the background, like a mantra as he repeated it again and again. The words came easy to him, the intonation and the pitch like breathing. Dean’s skin was cool to the touch, sallow and weirdly shining with sweat.
hot was making Dean pant
Cas chuckled, understanding without Dean saying anything. It was one of the reasons they worked so well together, they understood each other intimately. It was just how they were. It was something that stayed between them, something profound.
“We’re gonna get Cas back,”
Not that Gabriel had anything like that in his mind right now. After all, he had priorities – and no, at this moment in time he was not thinking with his dick when it came to Sam Winchester. In fact, though everything happening right now pointed to a night where they were both sweaty and spent and gasping each other’s names, the original Sam – Sammy OG, let’s call him, because calling him ‘not as hot as the one currently necking him, but still just as hot in that cute puppy dog kind of, I want to take you home and feed you and spend the rest of my life with you kind of way’ was a bit too many words for Gabriel to
Naomi quickly pulled it out and held it in front of her. It fell from her grasp, thumping into her chest as a large white orb ripped itself out of the glowing emerald and zipped out of sight into the night sky. Her deadly gaze roved over the darkened alleyway, smirking widely.
Naomi stood from her chair, took hold of the intricately decorated box and pressed her thumb against the latch. It flicked open with a rush of wind. But then...nothing happened. Peering inside, she saw a large emerald set in a gold chain. Reaching for it, she held her sceptre to her side, in case of its need, and touched the cool metal. Again nothing happened, so she lifted it up against the willowing sun setting into the horizon. The emerald sparkled like starbursts, it was mesmerising to see.
it was Cas, but like a remnant or something. But what exactly did it mean?
Dean stopped, breath caught in his throat.
“Allow me to introduce myself then, my name is Castiel,” He replied, taking hold of Dean’s arm and moving them away from the doorway they were blocking. He slowly removed his glasses and Dean sucked in a deep breath. His eyes were an amazing blue, like the brightest of skies, and so clear. They had a weird, almost supernatural glow to them.
and see if he was o—holy fuck, Sam was straddling him, his large body crawling and towering over Gabriel’s own like a seductively cat…no, panther…fuck.
Sam felt like he was falling.
Castiel didn’t know what was happening.
“Look, I get it.” Sam stated, sitting opposite his gleaming brother and trying to get his head around just what Dean was expecting them to do. He had thought, with God replaced by a much better one, that they could have a moment to just rest and relax. “I wanna get Cas back too, but we can’t just walk into the Empty’s hideout and force her to give Cas back,”
Fuck sakes, it was almost Halloween, he and Cas had plans tonight. They were going to do their annual scary movie night with his brother and his brothers asshole of a trickster boyfriend. But no, he had been stuck with the douchebag king and a stupid new age tech-fangled car. He hated new age cars, preferring vintages like his Baby. But he was the owner, he didn't get a choice.
It was only some times that Cas let out his more crazy and sexy side. It always came out in full form, just like now, as he moved over to the table in the corner – not that Dean had been paying any attention to the room, not after seeing Cas in that outfit. He pinched at the centre of the white cloth draped on the table and yanked it off in one swift move.
He watched as Dean would sit against the wall, pressing a hand to his shoulder — the one that had Cas’s hand print on, and just stare at the wall. He had wanted to go inside too, many times he had to force himself to stop. Dean didn’t appreciate being watched when he was like this, when he was vulnerable.
His phone buzzed again, slipping out of his fingers and onto the beer stained floor. After a moment of silence, the phone buzzed again, this time by Eileen. And he knew he should at least attempt to pick up the phone.
Maybe he should go
But my Sabriel heart was like...I need to see Gabriel happy too.
“Night Gabe,” Sam murmured, taking a look at him and then turning to the door.
"Gabriel had a plan on getting Cas back,"
Getting all my ducks in a nice, neat row.
Castiel had to focus. What had he seen, what had he sensed before the magic spell had hit Dean. Closing his eyes, he tried to focus. They had been outside. Castiel’s barriers had been up and they had both been inside the parameters. He was damn sure of that. He could still sense the little strain he felt whenever he had them up, like a little tickle at the back of his head. A presence that made itself known only when he focused on it. Like breathing, his magic was to him.
Dean’s hands tightened on Castiel’s hair, fingers buried deep as he rode the waves of his orgasm, head shaking from side to side in his feverish state. He whimpered. “Son of a bitch, Cas!” as Cas continued to stroke inside him, pumping softly, he felt a sharp pinch at his thigh and he gasped, panting.
Castiel reached out to him, the cool sensation of him projecting out of his memories body and stepping forward towards Dean. He stood directly in front of Dean, desperate to reach out and touch, to hold onto him and tell him how sorry he was, how he had never wanted Dean to find out like this. That being a Novak didn’t make him different to the Cas Dean knew him to be.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was mesmerised by his gaze, hell by his everything. He was even starting to dig the trench coat, provided he could take it off him later tonight. What the hell was happening? He should be freaked out, but hell, maybe it was the drinks he had downed, or maybe it was something else, something more profound about this man, but Dean felt like he knew him. Intimately. Weird.
She had said it was a seraph, and the only seraph he knew that he was in close contact with for god only knew how many years was Cas. But…that wasn’t…him…was it?
Like…was Sam even interested in men?
Dean’s eyes were drawn to his thick cock, the shape a shadow against the fabric of his underwear. Fuck, he was already so hard.
I have no excuses.
He smiled, clapping his hands as he made his way over to Sam. He conjured a large lollipop and held it out to the man. Sam took it, used to Gabriel giving him sweets and things whenever he had finished something big.
Thank fuck for that.
Pushing those hands away was a pointless feat, because Sam Winchester was a giant moose of a man, and holy fuck, when the man wanted to, he could hold Gabriel down – willingly mind you, - and do whatever the fuck he wanted with him.
Sam would have him. Yes, there was no way he was going to let this man go. But for tonight, he was going to wait for his results, and try to pass his class.
His gaze flickered to the wall. There wasn’t a mark on it, not even a nick, or a stain, or anything. Just the metal and cement of the bunker, just the sloppily painted sigils and symbols in the black lacquered paint, the panelled walls and the iron shelves, and the god damn chains stuck to the ground.
Fuck.
“I think I like you like this,” Cas hissed, running his nails down Dean’s chest and abs, making him shudder. “You comfortable baby?”
Cas leaned in close, lifting Dean up and dropping a gentle kiss to his forehead, trailing his fingers along Dean’s thigh, bringing his hand towards the inner thigh and with one finger, stroked at the hardened cock straining in his black underwear, curling his hand around it and squeezing it gently. Dean’s gasps brought a shiver through Ca’s body and he continued to grind and pump Dean’s cock through the cotton, repeating the moans from his pretty lips.
proud.
The air had felt a lot less crowded here, a lot cleaner too. She had instantly recognised this to be the small nook of atmosphere her stupid stepson had taken hostage of. He always did love living in silly buildings and cottages set far in the distance, far away from his mother. She followed the small ball of light, seeing it zip and zag along the air. She understood the allure of this place, it was a lot nicer than the cityscape of the kingdom, and a lot more serene than the dark confines she called her home.
“This is a Rifter,” Victor pushed the box up higher. “Crowley states this will show you the Eye’s whereabouts.”
Sam glared at his brother, pressing his hands to his chest, the ball of light held between the space of his palms, shining a little brighter.
He saw the ball of light fizzle a little, shivering and shaking in Sam's hands, before it zipped out and thumped harshly against Dean's groin. He hit him hard enough for the hunter to double over in pain and catch his breath. Dean groaned at the sudden pain, putting pressure on the ache.
But he aimed to change that. He was going to go out tonight, meet a nice person, man, woman, fuck he didn’t care, and get drunk and have a good time. He ran a brush through his hair, spiking it up a little more – he wanted to look hot today, more so than what he usually looked like. He wore a tight shirt that hugged every dip and hollow and curve of his body, and jeans that were just as tight, black boots to finish the outfit and a plaid shirt over his shirt to add to the allure.
Hopefully Rowena is nice enough to give us a spot of tea!
slap him on the back of his head this time. However, the low growl coming from the sleeping Sam caused him pause.
“Dean, my love,” Castiel whispered, pulling his mouth away from his nipple, skin now dark pink from his attention, he pleaded. “Tell me,”
Dean chuckled, reaching over to his beautiful angel and kissed him for all he was worth.
“Well maybe we didn’t look hard enough!” Dean growled, pounding his fist onto the table. It didn’t scare Sam, he was expecting Dean to be like this. To be somewhat unhinged. But his anger faded, shattered into a sad, faraway look. “I…I asked Jack…he—he isn’t replying,”
, lust. His angel was so turned on right now. And Dean was ready to go whenever Cas got like that. “Let me do this for you,”
“Slowly,” Dean murmured.
“Thanks for letting me stay late,” Sam said, getting up from his seat. He placed his laptop and books in his bag and slung his bag over his shoulders. “You know you could just kick me out when you’re closing,”
on the way Dean was curled into his right side, warm and sweet, smelling like a forest and metal, those thick muscular arms wrapped possessively around his middle.
Dean seemed to think about this for a moment, and then nodded, loosening his arms enough for Castiel to move a little to the place where his book had fallen. Dean’s arms were still looped around him however. When Castiel reached for the book, he was forced back into Dean’s embrace. The man in question curled back around Castiel’s right side, tightening his grip around the sorcerer and buried his head back onto Castiel’s chest, murmuring nonchalant words.
Cas ran his fingers over the binds, picking a few of the soft buttery leather ones and making his way over to Dean. He grappled him harshly onto the bed, leather buckles clasping and tightening on his wrists and ankles, holding him still and steady. Dean groaned, rolling his shoulders back, but the bounds held him back, pinning him up. They were soft to the touch, but were as strong as steel. The manacles chains clinked forebodingly, as he tried to wriggle and ease some of the tension from his body.
Sam didn’t have a problem with his big brother being gay, or bisexual or whatever the hell he was. He did get why they kept their relationship a secret from the others. But why keep it a secret from him? He had wanted to ask them, countless of times, wanted to shake them and tell them that he knew, he
Dean was confused. No, not confused. He got what she was saying. This little ball of light inside him would be able to tell him where Cas was, probably when they were in the Empty, and that Dean would basically be a beacon for Cas to find him. But that didn’t answer just how the fuck they were going to get
I am so torn...Sabriel or Samleen?
Focus, for fucks sakes.
The markings on the ground lit up a golden colour, sparkling like glitter and a disco ball mashed together. He watched, enthralled moreso now than before. His attention was taken by the small spark of gold in the centre of the room.
She wanted to find out more, but the Rifter had disappeared into the skies, ready to split again. And Naomi was left here, with an unconscious High Sorcerer and half of his lover. All she wanted was the Eye's power. And now, she had probably caused hell to unleash on the earth.
“Y-yeah, sure. C-Cas,” He said with a shudder. It made sense why he had turned everyone else down. It was like he had been waiting for this one guy, this gorgeous man.
The old lady held it up to her face, making the tendrils stretch a little more. Dean didn’t understand why his body moved with them, why he was eager to have it back inside of him, rather than glad it was out. Who the fuck had put that in him in the first place? Not many people had the jump on him, especially with something that screamed
“For Naomi,” Crowley bowed low once again, “I will charge one hundred thousand coins,”
Thank fuck.
When he wasn’t baking, he was creating all sorts of things, such as furniture and assorted items. He loved working with his hands, adored the things that came out of his fingers. He had a piece of himself in everything he sold, and he sold them well. Many people, sorcerers, familiars and humans alike, had come to his side, asking for more of his treats, for more of his furniture, saying how he had helped them immensely.
“Hmm…no bite,” She wrinkled her nose almost cutely, but didn’t sound like she was nerved by them. She sounded somewhat ancient, like she knew way too much, and wasn’t that fucking perfect. Dean was ready to thump the next person who kept things away from him all because they wanted to be mysterious and shit. It didn’t help anyone. “Alright, let me explain it to you then,”
Dean grinned, oh he knew that tone. An hunter and the angel role play tonight. This was going to get awesome really quickly. He relaxed on the bed, though his ear was still primed to that gorgeous voice. He wondered whether he could come just by Cas’s voice. Blinking rapidly, and trying to clear the fog from his vision – god damn it Cas, did he have to hit him so hard? Or had he drugged him?
Crap, this gorgeous piece of ass was a weirdo. Great, always jonesing for the crazies, Dean. “Buddy, I’ve definitely never seen you before,”
Hearing that Cas had...confessed to him. It had shocked him, floored him. He hadn't...well, he had heard every word, and it had made his heart beat madly, but his breath catch in his throat. But the impending doom, with Billie at the door, and with the fucking Empty being summoned. Dean hadn't been able to take anything in.
“Best god damn Halloween night ever,”
“Have you found what I am looking for?” She asked the Rifter, though she knew it couldn't hear her. Her nose was filled with the scent of pine and forest, and something else. It smelled…powerful. Like an electrical current pulsing through the air. She watched, in awe, as the small ball of light shuddered almost coquettishly, and disappeared into the blonde mage's body.
“I didn’t think you were into this kind of thing,” he grinned, his eyes still that lusty dark burst sunflower.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
Dean thought he wasn't good enough?
He was able to weave his magic directly into his creations that would actually help and benefit the people who ate his treats or used his things. He was still trying to work on that nasty cancer. But he was sure he was going to get a break through some day. He was damn sure of it.
He had been nursing the same drink for almost an hour before he finally gave up and decided to leave. He made his way to through the crowd and to the door, but bumped into whoever was entering. Murmuring a quick sorry, he looked up at the person he bumped into and his breath caught in his throat.
It had been a great night out, all those pretty scantily clad costumed beauties. Ellen’s Roadhouse had been packed when he got there, but it was worth all that shit, not finding a table and standing at the corner for most of it. But yeah, it was Halloween and Dean was happy.
He leaned up against the cool tiles for a moment away from the heat, before returning to the hot water, lathering up his body with a generous helping of soap and shower gel. It was a routine that helped settle the stress from his mind. He rubbed at his sore muscles, trying to find the places that hurt the most, but every new position brought up a fresh new twinge of pain.
His heart grew a few sized bigger at the idea that his Cas was looking after him after he had fallen.
“Now, let’s get back to earlier,”
Dean couldn’t open his eyes all the way; they felt heavy and laden with something that made his insides turn. The thrumming ache in his chest felt like he had been hit by a truck. And there was a thick sand-like taste on his tongue. It almost made him want to throw up, or dash for a pitcher of water and drink it until the taste disappeared.
“You’re a Novak?”
“Where should I start?” he inquired, his voice deep. He touched Dean’s cock playfully with his heeled foot, pressing the flat toe on his hard cock just a little. Dean gasped, but he was grinning. Cas pulled off his tie, tugging on it and removing it from the collar of his slutty outfit. He arched his foot back and bent down, letting the tie drop to the ground, licking Dean’s chest and all the way up to his full lips.
But I don't want to make this another massive thing (I say that all the time, and it never works out the way I want it) so you'll hopefully see all the oldies but goodies.

It wasn’t going to end like this. Dean wasn’t going to let it end like this.
“It had to have been something ancient,” Castiel followed Gabriel, though his attention was still on the three Winchesters. He still wasn’t sure why the other Sam was unconscious. And if
Cas grinned, playing the tip of his cock at Dean’s entrance, holding it there. Dean whined, lowering his body down in an attempt to nudge his cock in.
“Just a new blend, doesn’t have a name yet,” Gabriel shrugged his shoulders, “But it should help you sleep at night,”
Yeah. Because he wasn't. All he wanted was his best friend back.
Castiel growled out his spell, moving his fingers in an intricate dance in the air, forcing everything he had into his words and his fingers. Bluish white light emanated from the tips of his fingers and he pressed his hand down onto Dean’s chest. He could feel Dean’s body shudder as he violently arched up, back curving into an arch. He dropped just as harshly back onto the ground, his body recognising Cas’s magic, wrapping his own around it. The small greenish gold tendrils urging up from his heart was always an amazing sight for Castiel to see, it was like his soul wanted Cas, was eager to taste his magic, needing him, feeding off him. Castiel smiled, that meant Dean was still here, he wasn’t completely dead.
ones?
Dean’s gaze flickered to the wall again. The pristine wall, only hit with the snicks of his knife, gauges of the blade slicked into the cement. The trials of his pain, his aching, his anger, his greed, his selfishness. His want, his need. The wall was filled with his yells, his screams, his cries.
“Do not be alarmed.” The angel smiled, and took off into the skies.
Fuck, what was Cas thinking?

Dean kissed me.
"Use me," Sam stated, gazing intently at the fading light in his hands.
“I wish Naomi well,” Crowley laughed as the sorcerer took the box out from his home. "May she get what's coming for her,"
“My dear hunter,” He replied, running the blade carefully over his skin. “I know every little thing about you,”
Gabriel reached forward, taking hold of Sam in his arms. He struggled with the larger man, but easily moved him to the booth, laying him down. Sam’s legs bent over the side, his large body fitting in the booth.
Such a powerful mage, he probably had a familiar…somewhere. Someone who was beautiful, lovely, and sweet, just like he was. Not someone like Sam, who was bulbous, bumbling and such an idiot whenever he was around Gabriel.
What the

summon her at all. He still wasn’t so sure if that was possible. Cas had made a deal with the thing after he had been killed — and from what Dean knew, the Empty was like a psuedo heaven for angels, so no human or otherwise had been there before — and he had only been able to fully summon the Empty when his deal with her had been finished.
“We searched,” Sam stated, pointedly. “The first time Cas was in the Empty, we looked everywhere and we found nothing,”
Well, she sure as hell
Cas grabbed him by the knees, so calmly, pulling them apart as far as they would go with his ankles still tied, he pressed long and hot kisses to Dean’s thighs. Dean was so sensitive and Cas’s tongue was so hot. He made sure not to neglect any part of his flesh, especially his hole, stretching it open with his tongue and fingers.
He grimaced as the beer burned his throat, smooth silk and familiar as he tried to take another hit. But the bottled slipped slightly from his shaking hands. Pressing his other hand to the neck of the bottle, hoping to hold himself steady, he forced himself to drink again. An illusion. A hallucination. A nightmare.
“How much?”
The almost empty bottle smashed to the ground, the warm beer splashing in a neatly growing circle by his feet. He gripped his shaking and sweaty palms to his chest, his breathing shallow, choking and hot. He slumping his head down onto his bended knees, trying to get his body to respond, to relax. But his breath came out harsher, heavier, chest aching.
Nope.
“You’re still too dressed,” Dean teased cockily.
Fuck, he felt sick, he felt faint. His heart beat maddened, weeping for what he had lost. What he could no longer have. Why hadn't he said anything, why hadn't he held Cas close to him. Why hadn't he
"This is ridiculous, Bradbury," Dean whispered harshly, glaring at the white and gold chandeliers hanging deftly above them. He was so out of his element. He wasn't used to wearing tuxedos and suits, he would much rather be at home, sitting in jeans and a t-shirt than be forced into…eugh…a tie.
We will ride to Hell together!
But Dean kissed me…
Nothing productive would come out of him thinking about Sam and him and…
Castiel’s cheeks tinged a beautiful pink as he leaned back a little. “P-perfect? Wha—did you hit your head?”
moment, but he was glad Cas was keeping this serious. Dean felt submissive then, at the whim of his angel’s thoughts and ideas. It was a great place to be. He was able to show what he truly felt. It was just a table, just sitting there. But the items on that table, the bindings and the buckles and…there was so much there. He could only imagine what it would be like to be tied down completely, heart hammering anxiously like a caged bird, fighting for freedom. Not that he really wanted it.
His dark brown hair was curled at the ends, his eyes were shielded by red tinted glasses, he was dressed in a dark suit with a long, tanned trench coat. But god…he looked

They were just as beautiful now. But it made his heart ache at the memory of his boyfriend. He hadn’t seen Cas since he had left for a family get together a few days ago. He wasn’t due back for a long while. Man, Dean was so hooked on his angel, he had even thought he had seen Cas at the bar, but that couldn’t be possible. Cas was miles away.
He had…he had mourned for Cas, hell he was

had happened first of all. And he had a spell for that.
Then, suddenly, the air was frozen still. Naomi’s breath came out in puffs of moist steam that permeated into the air. She suddenly felt the emerald hidden under her shirt heat up. A blinding light grew out from under it. She peered at the emerald, entranced by the green that stared back at her, swirling with such power that it immobilised her.
Sam and Dean act like?
Urged by a force unknown, she placed the pendant around her neck, clasping it into place. As soon as she did so, Naomi suddenly felt something push against her navel. She clenched her eyes closed at the sudden pain. But when she opened them, she saw she wasn’t in her room any more.
I did tag M/M/M....
“Hush, Dean,” Cas replied, turning around and looking at Dean. He was hidden somewhat in the darkness of the room, but his eyes were bright, filled with…
Cas wasn’t gone. Not really. He was still out there, still alive. Still kicking. He just wasn't here. Dean wasn’t going to believe that his best friend, his angel, was up and dead. He couldn’t do that. No way. There had to be a way. There was always a way. There had to be something. They had killed Death, taken down God, Amara and all those god damn assholes.
Bargaining had never been a thing. Who would he ask? Who would he bargain with? Jack had gone off the radar while he fixed heaven — or at least that was what Dean had thought he was doing — and he had told them that he wasn’t going to be so hands on. Dean understood. Dean preferred it. He didn’t want another God who was like the previous one. The one who preferred a good story.
“Get some rest, Sammy,”
Cas made his way over to Dean’s side, feet shuffling silently on the plush carpet. He looked so soft dressed in one of Dean’s old shirts and pyjamas. He could just imagine how he would walk over, looking so gorgeous and much too put together for Dean’s liking. He poked at Dean’s shoulder, insistently.
It was oddly mesmerising, kinda therapeutic, like looking at fish in a fish tank. He was kinda enthralled with the wispy colours.
right now.
Dean’s magic pulsed a little, like a car revving up and making his way back to consciousness, back to Cas. Castiel’s heart beat madly in his chest, jack rabbiting, threatening to burst.
to know if Dean’s blood tasted as sweet as he did. He felt his canines extend slightly. His eyes darkened and he pressed his mouth to the curve of Dean’s throat, plunging his fingers deeper into Dean’s hole as he did so, claiming his throat with his teeth. His fangs sank into his plump flesh, he felt the warm nectar of Dean’s blood flow into his mouth and he groaned in unadulterated pleasure. Dean was by far the sweetest and most succulent thing he had ever tasted.
"Trust me," he stated, to both of them. Dean paused. He...he wasn't sure what to do. On the one hand, if they had Gabriel back to full health, then they'd be able to figure out a way to get Cas back. Hell if a nephilim could wake him up in the Empty and have the shadow creatures spit Cas back out, then maybe Gabriel could do the same?
He probably should have told Cas just how much he was into this, but Cas had told him not to talk. Everything was coming to head, gloriously. Rolling his eyes, he groaned deeply in the back of his throat. The silence was overwhelming, god, if he listened closely enough he could hear his own heart beating.
…fucking hot. Like what the hell was that?
He hadn’t understood just how he had gone from looking at Dean’s beautiful green eyes filled with anger and hurt, filled with
He reluctantly followed his friend down the grand staircase, tie tugging at his collar in an almost painful way. They stopped at the bottom of the staircase and were met by a man in a dark suit, holding a clipboard.
It was such an odd sensation. But he felt…worry free. Like everything that had caused him to pause, to stop and think before he did anything rash…
Cas couldn’t take the new development, he couldn’t hold back any longer. He just

and reached for Dean’s arms, trying to reason with the man, though he felt this was all just way too out of character for Dean. He didn't want to anger the clearly enchanted man. “I just need my book, and then we can cuddle,”
Both Sam and Dean right now exuded raw sexual energies and uninhabited need to be with him and Gabriel, but did that make them the
“What don’t I know?”
Dean nodded, nuzzling his neck, sighing a dopey smile on his face as he kissed his skin, tightening his arms around Cas’s waist. “I love you, you know that?”
Dean felt his heart skip a beat. Fuck, dimples...
“I beseech you to tell me where to find The King of Hell,” The once gossiping marketplace suddenly quietened, as if the world was put on mute. Thousands of eyes glared at the blonde man.
on him.
And Sam was, once again, getting lost in him.
Victor shook his head. “It requires your blood to open it.”
He remembered the look on Castiel’s face, at the way he had yelled at Castiel and how that gorgeous face had fallen. He spotted the tears in the corner of Castiel’s eyes, and his heart had desperately wanted to reach out for his Cas, to hold him close and tell him that he didn’t care just what his last name was. That Cas was his Cas that he was the best sorcerer, the best friend Dean could ever have. And that was because he was
Wait.
He tugged Cas into his bedroom, trapping him into his embrace as they slammed into the door, and then into the wall. Kissing and giggling, acting like teenagers. He slipped his hands into Cas’s trench coat, dragging it off his shoulders, throwing it off his body and onto the ground. Cas kissed him then, soft, sweet and so good.
Sorry its taken so long to update, been having a...well lets call it hectic, past few months. But I'm slowly recovering, and honestly, this story is going to take some time to get going, but it will definitely go into my good graces and be up more frequently.
The place she had landed on was dark, there was wet soil at her feet, staining the bottom of her dress. The once star filled sky overturned with darkness as clouds rolled in. The sound of thunder was almost deafening as lightening crackled to the ground a few feet away from her. The simple lights around her flickered off one by one, engulfing the place in darkness.
Castiel sighed, he had read through that book hundreds of times throughout his life, he had even skimmed through the entire book as quickly as he could while waiting for his brother, and hadn’t been able to find anything. Maybe Gabriel could find something.
"No, look, you're low on grace," Sam stated, speaking directly to Gabriel. He held the light up to his face, narrowing his gaze. "And I want to help, let me make it up to you, so use me, god damn it,"
He thought about releasing his tensions the usual way, but he was too tired to even masturbate. The stress and tension was layered into his muscles. Eventually he had to concede defeat, getting out of the shower and leaving his clothes in a rumpled heap as he made his way to his bedroom, towel wrapped around his waist.
Fear engulfed Victor as he tightened his robe around his lithe frame, holding his head high, he hoped that the royal seal placed upon the clasp of his robe shone out to those who feared the kings, and hid within the deep blue robe to those whom wanted something against the hierarchy.
It had all happened so fast. He had still been in fight or flight mode with death literally following their heels. And Cas...his...Cas had told him he was going to die. For him. To save him.
“N-not that I’m not—
She had been the one to call him, the one to tell him how much she loved him, how scared she had been, how they shouldn’t wait any longer. He had been ecstatic, he had immediately agreed and they had been together ever since.
“What would a Novak want with me?” He heard Dean say to himself, and his eyes widened.
He was always around pretty girls and hell, Gabriel was the same, he was pansexual. But there was just something about Sam that made him zone everything and everyone else out and just
“Thanks for letting me stay late, you know you can just kick me out when you’re closing,” he mumbled, stumbling as he got up from his seat, almost slinging his bag on his back and holding his laptop in his arms. Shit, he should put that
look. The one that made Cas sure that Dean loved him, they just…they just hadn’t gotten there yet.
The Rifter rocketed in through from its stupor in the skies and settled onto the forest floor where the two men were was talking, unbeknownst to the world around them. The blonde mage could not see the small ball of light, too enthralled in his discussion with Castiel, either that or he didn’t notice. The Rifter stood still, excitement bubbling up inside it. The blonde mage's pretty face, gorgeous green eyes, long dark eyelashes that fanned over her high cheek bones, the panting of her breath from his parted lips as he spoke heatedly to the man standing at the doorway, running thick fingers through his spiky hair.
Cas pressed his knuckles into Dean’s ass, hissing sympathetically when Dean whimpered. He pressed down harder to get all of the tension out, using every bit of knowledge he knew about massages, though most of that had come from practice. He wanted Dean to be fully relaxed from his long day. He had the patience of a saint, and determination too.
He heard a tap of the bathroom door, a short, sharp rap that startled him from his thoughts, making fresh pain spring to every bruise and callous on his body. Fuck.
okay.
“Come on then,” he whispered, his voice strained. With his hands tied up, there wasn’t much he could do. His instinct was to spread his legs and reach up, but he wanted Cas to do it for him, it would send him right over the edge. Shit, he was already so close.
Dean glanced up into those lovely blue eyes and smiled brightly. Everything felt so
Cas worked his fingers in and out of Dean’s hole, imitating what he really wanted to be doing, and what he would most likely be doing. Thrusting in and out of his tight, wet and warm hole, savouring the whines and moans escaping his lips, he bobbed his head against and again, sucking sweetly at Dean’s cock, working his mouth and tongue in a circle at the head of his cock, bringing Dean to an earth shattering orgasm.
Cas’s cheeks burst a bright red and his spell book fell to the ground with a loud thud, making him jump. This was so…wrong! What kind of spell made him act so…so emotionally? It had to be that blast that had knocked them both back. He was sure the spell attack had been for Dean and Dean alone, because Cas didn’t feel any different at all. But Dean…Dean was acting so gung ho and sure, more so than usual. It was like he was letting whatever was usually crossing his mind happen!
The blonde mage had split like she had expected him to, her intent had been to keep him when it happened, and to kill him off when he was the most vulnerable. His soul split it two, easy to kill. Yet she hadn't expected this. She hadn't expected the Rifter to separate him from himself, she hadn't expected
They didn’t need to say anything to the old lady, not really. She didn’t know there name, and they didn’t know hers. She didn’t want to give it up, just in case they were ever interrogated and her name came up in their conversations. God damn paranoid woman, but he didn’t care. As long as she could help him.
She nodded, closing the box lid with a snap, bringing Dean out of his trance. “It’s something that will wake up the shadows from their deep,
The place
“Son of a bitch,” Dean moaned, his body laced with relaxation. "You're a fucking angel, babe,"
Oh dear.
Dean growled, closing his eyes and wishing for a moment of peace. Frustration roiled in his stomach, but he didn’t let it run. This was Cas after all. But his head was pounding with ache, like it was threatening to burst through his skull.
“Done!” He cried, his gaze turning to Gabriel as soon as he said it. He
He could
Then again, it only seemed right, after all they had the summoning of angels and demons down to an art form.
The only time Dean had seen his grace was when they were in need of it, or when Cas was bleeding out, caught by bad guys and needing to be saved.
“Beautiful Cas,” he murmured, pressing a scant kiss to the corner of Cas’s lips. He felt Cas stiffen underneath him, but he pressed on, leaning back and smiling. “Such perfection,”
Also, I don't want anyone to be freaked out by the new tags, yes I did write Sabriel and Sam/Eileen, but I was so on the fence about which one I would choose. I've always been a Sabriel simp, but I love Eileen. As a fellow hard of hearing person (though obviously Eileen herself has it a lot worse than I) I was glad to see the representation, and I adore her and Sam together.
Clutching the small tomb close to his body, Victor peered into the parchment paper and reread the article that had answered all of his prayers. Shivering at the feathers of a Great Eagle that had brushed passed him he walked ahead through the myriad of creatures and stalls surrounding him. Stopping in front of a stall, he leaned into the puce coloured ogre standing on the opposite side.
“Run that by me again?”
calm, considerate, caring, sweet, meek and timid; whereas the other would be
Alright, fine. He was stalling.
Cas slammed his hands down on the pedestal and turned to Dean. He gasped when he noticed just how far Dean had gotten. The man was like a panther, a ninja! Moment before he had been unable to move, and in a flash Dean had turned the large table and was standing right next to him, they were almost face to face.
“We do not talk of his name out loud,” The ogre muttered, pushing him back from the stalls. “Leave before I make you,”
He was losing his nerves.
He knew how Dean was grieving for Cas. How much pain he was in that he had lost his best friend, his…lover? Hell, it wasn’t a surprise to Sam how much the two loved one another. It wasn’t shouted out at the world, they weren’t open and welcoming about it. They kept everything quiet, like it was just for them. Something special and warm and exciting that they wanted to share with one another before they told the world — or at least told him. Which was how Sam had expected Dean had wanted it.
Dean remembered. They had been fighting about his heritage, about his last name, about his family. What an idiotic thing to be fighting about? Castiel was his friend, his confidante, his…Castiel was his…he was…he…he was Castiel.
No…come closer. Dean forced his body to move and reached out to Cas, wanting him closer. He pressed a hand to Cas’s cheek, leaning up with him.
“She’s not been wrong so far,” Dean replied. It was true, she had been right about pretty much everything that had been going on. She knew he had Cas’s…grace — or whatever that light show was — inside of him, and she knew who Cas was. All they had done was show up at her house, once Gabriel had given them directions, and told them they needed to talk to her. She had been the one to silence them, usher them into her home and get the kettle on. They had told her they simply wanted to know if they could summon the Empty, and if she had any clue on how to do that.
“That thing; we’ve got to figure out what it was,” Gabriel stated, making his way to the pedestal and leafing through Castiel’s book.
...I wonder what's happened to Dean~!
“What is it?” Sam asked, taking the drink from Gabriel’s hands – Gabriel was always so stunned at just how trusting Sam was of him, after all he
blonde mage's. And she definitely hadn't expected her own stepson, the High Sorcerer to the House of Novak, to have fallen at its power.
“What the fuck is that?” He asked, ‘cause, alright. So that right there, that was…well,
No, he wasn't going to think pessimistically anymore. He was gonna be all positive. Yeah, they were gonna figure this out. Even if he had to pull Gabriel outta that ball of light by his fucking wings.
“Okay, baby,” he retaliated, pushing at Sam. When the man didn’t budge, Gabriel snapped his fingers and suddenly Sammy 2.0 was lifted from him, hovering just a few inches away from his body, arms strung up of his head and legs spread below him, stopping him from reaching. The second Sam was then pushed into a wayward chair, one that had – in Mickey Mouse Fantasia style – walked over to them and settled onto the linoleum. “You’re gonna stay there, while I figure this out,”
“Now what am I going to do?” Victor dragged his leather bound feet over the dirt ridden paths. A warm hand tapped on the lapels of his robe, turning he saw a vision of beauty bestowed upon him. An angel had settled to the ground and motioned for him to follow her into a dingy alleyway leading through the middle of the market place. Should I follow the beauty to my possible doom? Victor thought to himself; he reached for the hilt of a dagger strapped to his waist and followed the angel.
Cas laughed in a way that Dean found incredibly sexy. He pulled back and gazed at his lover, seeing Dean so erect, weeping and drooling cock throbbing with need. He started to undo the buttons on his tight fitting shirt.
“I want it…
Dean growled to himself as he made his way into the shower, his skin beaded with the days sweat. He shrugged off his uniform, the jumpsuit he wore that was now covered in engine grease and grime. He kicked it to the side of the bathroom and stepped into the shower, eager to feel the steamy caress of water soothing the aggravation of the day from his body.
Dean came then, hearing Cas’s thick and throaty voice filled with so much love, spilling in the mess between them. He thrust in one more time, feeling Dean’s wall massage him, hearing Dean scream his name. He could no longer contain himself, He took sight of him, flush wish his orgasm and with a few more quick thrusts, he came inside him, roaring out in his pleasure.
He had seen the way his magic bloomed as it seeped into Sam’s own skin, the way it sped up its incursions, the way the very vine like ministrations he had expected to surround Sam in his protection, and the way they literally grew, wrapping and trapping and soothing before sinking into Sam, intent to stay there.
There was a deep black smoke that enveloped around Dean, and then he was forced to the ground, body unmoving. Castiel watched, unable to get out of this hell he had created for himself. Though he knew Dean was fine, he was okay, they were currently on his floor, cuddling together on the plush carpet. But looking at him now, seeing him like this, it broke his heart.
Cas leaned his entire weight into the massage, grunting with the effort it took to relax his lover. He peeled off the pyjamas, snapping the hem around Dean’s thighs and then he was at Dean’s ass, smoothing and massaging along the muscles, releasing tension as he massaged the globes with care. Dean was a puddle by now, he didn’t expect Cas to want to go further, but he was surprised when he felt fingers creeping closer to his puckered hole, hands shoving the pyjamas off his ass completely.
“He…well, he did quite a number on you.” She continued, giving Dean a look, mostly at his chest, as if she saw something there other than his shirt and flannel. He shuddered, and not in the good way. What the fuck was this old woman? “It’s surprising you’re not aware of it. But I guess you’ve always been a little hard headed, must be all that stuff your dad told you,”
He...of course he trusted his baby brother. But sometimes Sam had a weird complex. Then again, if anything were to happen to him, Dean was going to torture the asshole archangel piece by shiny piece, until he wished he were dead.
His head felt fuzzy, and his mind was a mix of white noise and a blaring siren. The cacophony of sounds pounding and aching behind his eyes.
“More…I want it…” Dean gasped.
“Th-thanks anyway,” Why was he such a fool!
But the damage had been done.
Naomi watched as the small ball of light zipped this way and that, as if she was watching, listening to their conversation.
He didn’t even care to think about just
I miss Gabriel...
Cas had given him a look, his face falling from the serious to the meek one Dean always saw him as. His look was silently asked for consent. Dean gazed back, nodding. And Cas’s expression hardened again. It was going to be so much fun.
If it weren’t for the whole
Cas to poof them up or down.
“Holy crap…that was awesome,” Dean gasped as he fell back onto the bed, spent and sated. “You…you’re awesome,”
Okay, he pushed all of
He had to figure out what was happening to Dean first.
And his phone was still ringing.
Maybe Gabriel hadn't been resurrected -- or what the fuck ever -- and this was...what? Another fucking sign or something? Maybe they wouldn't be able to get him back, and that meant that without Gabriel's help -- not that he was sure how that shit was going to work, but Sam seemed to have some kind of idea, he hoped -- they wouldn't be able to get Cas back.
Wait…why was he thinking about Gabriel? The archangel hadn’t been on the forefront of his mind for years now. Why was he suddenly — maybe…
Castiel watched on, running through the many spells he had known by heart that would incapacitate Sam in a way that wouldn’t hurt him or the others. The other Sam shuddered, looking at the sleeping Sam and grinning.
The sleeping Sam woke up, eyelashes fluttering in their attempt to take in the sudden light, before they zeroed in onto Gabriel. Those eyes turned a pitch black, the sclera and iris completely invisible. The smile that stretched on Sam’s lips was iridescent and obscene. Almost frightening in how dark he was.
“What the hell is happening over there?” Gabriel asked, but quickly shook his head. He had to prioritise right now. “No, wait, look, something happened to Sam, there’s two of him,”
Holy fuck.
as he worked hard.
And then Sam kissed him…
“Good…” a sweet voice said, guttural and raw, deep and absolutely familiar. “You’re finally awake,”
after all, he
“You don’t really want me to, do you baby?”
“Are you feeling better now?” he asked, fingers trailing over his the freckles on his high cheekbones.
"Alright, thanks." Sam replied, grabbing onto Dean's arm and hoping it would at least help him out of the weird trance he was back in again. There was definitely something strange and powerful about that ball. He could feel it, hell even Gabriel inside of him was beaming a little warmly now, as if he was glad his plan had worked. Sam just hoped it was a good idea, and not that Gabriel was trying to trick them. He wouldn't do that to them, would he? Shaking his head, he focused on what he did know. And that was that the ball in Dean's hand was basically a bomb. But that didn't really answer all of his questions. "So, can you help us get into the Empty? Or how to summon her?"
Dean’s head rolled back, exhaling out slowly, he slumped into the cushions as if that sigh had been the turning point for him. This was intimate, but not sexual, well not yet anyway, but it didn’t help his body any. The awesome attention he was getting made his cock stand to attention, demanding for more, jutting out obscenely.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas grinned, and holy shit he was a demon right there as he cleaned Dean up of his release. His beautiful angel. There was nothing more relaxing than a good massage after all. Cas didn't stop there, and worked down his thighs, taking his sweet time in easing Dean to the ultimate state of relaxation, his mind intent on the job before him. It was the least he could do after all.
in a sense. Like a clone apple would taste like cardboard, or cloning a car would disappear in mere hours of conjuring.
He reached for his phone first, the incessant ringing still going as he did so. He knew there were only a handful of people who actually
"Stop moving around!” Dean whined, grabbing onto Castiel’s middle and forcing him back down onto the ground.
Sorry for the sporadic updates.
It's the most...wonderless time of the year.
“You’re mine,” he stated simply, driving himself to the hilt.
It sounded so simple when Dean said it like that, with so much determination and enthusiasm in his expression. For a long moment, Sam actually believed they would be able to do it. Hell, why not? They had done so many other impossible feats before this, so why not crash land into the Empty, the one place they hadn’t really been into, and get Cas back.
My usual livelihood had been disrupted and put into a standstill pretty much. My tumour has revolted and is seething for revenge, and my body and joints etc are paying the price.
“So much…” Victor paid the man. Crowley took the pouch and threw it up into the air, it disappeared into thin air. The gypsy wrapped a material around the box, covering it completely.
Their kiss deepened, fierce, hot and intense. Cas gently lifted him and carried him over to the bed, pressing him down onto his sheets. They never broke their kiss. He pulled off Dean’s boots, and jeans, over shirt and shirt until he was laying there on the bed in just his black boxers.
He sighed. Yeah, now wasn’t the time to think about that. Pushing off the lamp post, he made his way passed the party and club goers and back home. Home wasn’t too far away. But each step he took forward felt like a great effort, like something was holding him back. He felt like he was moving through sludge, it was tiring him out to the point where he collapsed onto the ground, slamming harshly onto his knees. But he didn’t really feel the impact.
Leaning on the lamp post, he grinned. The night sky was clear and bight, he could see so many stars in the sky and it made his heart swell. The only time he had been able to focus on the stars like this was when he was with Cas. They had spent many date nights sprawled over the hood of his car, a picnic between them, just watching the stars twinkling in the sky, as if they were painted by an artist.
If Cas wanted to play, then hell, Dean would play. They had their safe words, and their limits already perfected, so Cas knew that when Dean snapped against the gag, straining and fighting against the binds, he wasn’t really meaning he wanted to get out. They were roleplaying after all.
“What do you truly crave, hunter?” Dean’s gaze shot straight to
Not likely.
So he hadn’t known just how he had gone from an angry Dean, to being knocked out unconscious, waking up on the soft dewy ground, looking up at the climbing sun rise across the skies, the birds and other forest animals singing sweetly, while his head pounded, his chest aching and his body feeling like a dragon had slammed straight into him.
“Yeah, they’re both…” he took a look at them both, seeing that they were, in some way safe and contained. “Yeah, I have them both,”
But this…this was…not it. It wasn’t the immediately intoxicating lightning storm Cas was used to, it was like…a small monsoon, like there
He fell back and his world tilted sideways before it completely darkened.
It was so easy to get lost in those gorgeous golden honey eyes. Oh god, if only Gabriel knew just how much Sam adored him. But someone as powerful and as wonderful as Gabriel probably wanted nothing to do with him.
He turned, steering away from the temptation of an empty room and a cosy lover, and a few flat surfaces to choose from, and faced the door. He barely noticed the little black ball zip through the air, through the glass of the door. But he felt it slip into him, heating him up from the inside, and take over his mind.
“The trickster asshole?” Dean cried, slamming his hands on the table as he stood up. “No fucking way, do you remember what he did to us the last time? What he did to
They had that profound bond thing after all.
Halloween fell on a stupid day this year. A Thursday. Not close enough to the weekend to enjoy the night out. All his friends had congregated however, for a few drinks and a great time. It was good to see everyone again. Work had really taken over. But then again, they really shouldn’t have to make excuses to meet up on the regular.
Like what exactly was that
He bristled again, a frown forming on his face almost automatically. He paused, not sure why the fact that his woman was talking bad about his asshole of a dad was making him feel this way. “Don’t…don’t talk about my dad,”
Leaning his head onto Dean’s chest, his heart plummeted when he couldn’t hear a heart beating, or feel his chest rise and fall in his breath.
Cas shook his head, shaking his head and grasping harder at his toes, pressing his thumbs into the arches, smiling to himself when he heard the lovely groan release from Dean’s lips. Every drop of tension that had worked in him had vanished. Cas smiled at his job well done, letting Dean go, laying feather light kisses up Dean’s legs,, travelling higher and higher up his body, pressing a pressured kiss at the tip of Dean’s cock. He knew Dean was too sensitive to the touch, it would be easy to get him off here and now, but this wasn’t about that.
Cas trailed his tongue down Dean’s body, tweaking his erect nipples, biting down lightly on them. Dean gasped, whimpering when one hand slid between his legs and Cas inserted two fingers into him again. He moved so slowly inside him, stuffing him and curling and scissoring his fingers. Dean’s cock was hard and drooling again, he was ready for Cas once again.
He found he couldn’t move very well. It felt like he was stuck in molasses, everything around him was heavy, and hot, and all sorts of awful. However, though it felt like there was a large weight on his entire body, he felt
“If Naomi wants the All Seeing Eye, she will have to go get him herself.” Crowley flicked his fingers in the air, calling upon a scantily clad gypsy woman to appear through the slide doors. With a quick word to her ear, she returned through the doors. Victor looked up when he felt the air around him stir. He paused as his gaze fell to the gypsy woman who entered the room, holding a small beautifully decorated box.
The blonde mage,
She zipped back onto her chair in front of them, reaching for her teacup and taking a sip. All this fucking running around was going to give him whiplash. She placed her, now empty cup of tea back onto the table.
“Do you have them both?”
Cas come. But Cas was moving so swiftly, so perfectly, Dean couldn’t help but scream, urging him on. Every thrust became more and more unrelenting. Cas leaned down and bit into the flesh at the curve of Dean’s neck, sinking into the skin and holding him tight.
"Sammy?"
The ball of light seemed apprehensive, shivering and shuddering a little, zipping back and forth in Sam's large hands, before finally settling down in the middle. He seemed to tumble over a little forward, as if he were nodding.
Putting on clothes sounded like too much work, but he forced himself to get on a pair of loose, old pyjamas, not bothering to do up the front. He didn’t care if Cas saw him; he had seen Dean in even worse states. Groaning, he stretched; gasping at the twinge of pain on is back. He made his way through the hall and into the living room, breathing a sigh of relief as he dropped down onto the soft sofa – god bless Cas’s need for soft furniture. This was the one good thing about their small apartment.
He felt Dean stiffen under him, and then relax, eyes drifting shut as Cas’s tongue traced lazy patterns down his stomach, muscles tensing for what was about to happen next. When Castiel’s teeth sunk into the flesh of his hip, he almost came with a shout.
Dean was so lost in the sensation of it, muttering sweet, nonsensical words to his lover. He would do anything for Cas, anything he fucking wanted. Cas’s hand squeezed at the base, his other hand rubbing at his balls in slow, soothing circles, weighing them on his hands before releasing them from his soft touch. Dean shuddered, hands grasping at the plush of the sofa, toes curling reflexively. He came so softly, so sweetly, body raising in a graceful arch before crashing back down to earth.
“I know a lot of things about you,” the man replied, running a hand through Dean's hair and smiling brightly when Dean didn't shy away. “Although, from a really long time ago,”
Did that mean this…weird pixie ball of light had been inside him…from the beginning? Maybe…from when…when he had first met Cas? Or maybe even when he had been in hell for all those years? Cas
Dean took a long swig of his drink as Cas’s hands pressed a bit harder into the muscles at the base of his neck, seeking to work away the tension he found there. Dean shuddered and groaned.
“I was thinking about that,” Dean stated, leaning back on the kitchen chair. He placed the beer bottle on the table and played with the label. “So like, we need to summon the Empty right, to get into it? There’s gotta be some lore around here that’d help us,”
Sam looked up at him, blinking once, twice, his eyes turned a weird golden colour, a little brighter than his usual eyes. They seemed to hold the glow that had been around his body. But he smiled brightly, skin a little better for it, not as shallow and sunken as it had been for the past few months.
