It took some time for the red-headed witch to make her appearance, taking every passageway possible to get to his small throne room.
“They’re here for you.” The voice closer, feeling their breath on his ear.
He pressed “Rest” before locking his phone and starting the car. He’ll play more tomorrow. So far, it really didn’t grab his attention. He was starting to understand why it had a 1 out of 5 star review.
“What are the specials for tonight?” he inquired when he managed to get the man's attention.
Dean shot up, eyes wide and gasping for breath, his heart was racing.
Castiel slammed his fist onto the wooden armrest, growling in frustration.
He doesn’t know why but his heart stopped. Kill another player? Why would he do that?
Castiel's own personal rule after watching all of his friends, family, and even random strangers get their hearts broken. Declaring how they were in "Love". Which is why Castiel decided to stick to his own devices by focusing on passing his college courses. So how in the hell does this man walk into Castiel's life, introducing himself as "Hi, I'm Dean Winchester" Son of Lucifer, Castiel thought after telling the man he wasn't interested.
“I read it somewhere and thought I’d give it a try,” brows pinching together in confusion, trying to understand how twirling your dick would cheer someone up.
The screen changed to a hallway.
“That means goodbye for the night,” Dean answered, smiling. Castiel looked down as he tried to understand, a small smile on his own when he finally got it.
******
That’s when a thought struck.
“Now, normally people who talk like that are raised with a strict upbringing,” Castiel gathered, recalling the stories Dean has told him from the previous sessions. From what he can gather, he was a Man’s Man.
Even his own family was keeping secrets from him.
Someone was having an extramarital affair.
Hope everyone enjoyed my version of the Purge :D
Dean was the first to smile, Castiel following suit with his own.
Castiel bit his tongue. To tell a complete stranger that he just broke up with his boyfriend would be too much information to spill all at once. Besides, this guy is just going to give him a half-hearted apology and continue on his way.
‘Sammy,’ he tried to say, but his mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton. The sound of feet hitting the ground made him groan as it irritated his headache.
“D-Dean,” he moaned out, his head rolling back to rest against the door as his hands tried to find purchase in the man's short hair. He received a moan in response, the vibration had him shuddering as he felt Dean take his entire length with ease.
“Where're the herbs he was carrying?” Castiel asked out loud, clicking yes. The screen blanked for a second, the image of his character rising and falling slowly, his health bar really low.
Now, even though Dean’s soul held all the magic, his body was never able to acclimate as one born with their powers would.
“How the tables have turned,” Looking behind him, he watched Dean take a small sip of his beverage. “How I was pouring you a drink and now the roles have switched,” Dean answered Castiel's confused look.
“What are you doing there, Cas?” He asked, stopping just short of the Vampire and his brother.
“Fuck” he heard Dean mutter, his body leaning forward. His hands placed on the bookshelf as he tried to get ahold of himself.
Sam huffed at Dean’s remark, the man didn’t care for things that couldn’t be explained, ever since they were kids. He was also stubborn and if it didn’t make sense, then he would walk away without listening to reason.
A noise pierced the silence, dragging both of their attention away to the sound.
No, that can’t be it.
Dean looked from the girl, back to the cup, then up to her name tag.
Taking down the royal family.
Then Voila.
Michael glared, pushing Gabriel’s hands away like a child so he could walk away. He didn’t get very far, the words mumbled from his helmsman had him pulling a knife out.
“Nah, you go ahead. I’ll see you Thursday.” Inias gave him a reassuring smile, turning to head towards his car that was parked on the side of the building.
I hope everyone enjoys this chapter ^^
Shifting the car into reverse, he lightly pressed the gas pedal until he was right in front of the place.
Crap, he's bragging. That's such a narcissistic thing to say. This could ruin things.
The guy gave him a sad look, nodding his head an agreement.
Blue eyes stared into green, their eyes slowly closing before their lips finally came together.
followed by the sound of the door slamming shut. But neither person in the small room was paying attention.
Sam and Dean figured the kidnappers had brought Cas back to the Church where he originally woke up. To finish that ritual they've been waiting to do.
As the Butler and personal confidant to the billionaire, Castiel did have his own standards to uphold.
“Look, I’m not sorry for pulling you from the danger but the bad news is we can’t keep you here. Once those people that were chasing clears out, you’re gone.” He watched as the man’s shoulders relax slightly, his gaze turning towards the concrete floor.
"What was that?" his voice teasing.
Desperation was what he was suddenly feeling, rising more and more from the contact, at the feeling of the chapped lips, his own hands coming up to rest on either side of the man's neck, his body moving forward on its own.
“Then let’s go back,” Castiel began flipping through his notes to their first meeting. “You had a healthy sex drive during your late teens, noticed yourself not as into it around your mid-twenties. You’re close to your thirties now, can you recall anything that might have triggered the change?”
The taunting, teasing, and perverted remarks made in his general direction. He knows she means well but it’s starting to get on his nerves. Hell, her shift didn’t start til 12!
Dean only stopped the kiss to get up, pulling his shirt over his head while Castiel quickly unbuttoned his. The two met in the middle after both having completely undressed. Cas on his knees to meet Dean who was still standing at the foot of the bed.
The words caught his attention, blue meeting green. A flicker of hope in those eyes as Castiel’s thumb moved on its own. Swiping along the soft, plump lips as those eyes pleaded for him to do something.
“Don’t you look happy, Castiel” the twang of his commander commented, bringing him back to reality. She sat opposite of him in the small compartment, her lips stained red as they pulled back to reveal her sharp canines.
"Hey man, I'm not into the whole rope play," Dean said as the man approached.
She didn’t say anything as he sucked his next meal down, tossing the body. Raising a brow at him when he slumped back in his seat, one hand covering his eyes, the other wiping his face.
If you are on tiktok, and want to become further educated on Dissociative Identity Disorder, there is a system known as "Theasystem" that can further educate you on this :D
I don't know why the font and words are so bold and big when in my doc's is not even this way, smh. Enjoy!
In a blink of an eye, Dean was upright and leaning against one of the trees as he watched the man walk across the campsite. Over to where he first appeared and...picking up the intact vase. What the hell?!
of his finger, scanning the pages. Not thinking about the distant laugh, how it didn’t quite sound like Dean’s, maybe a little higher than the man’s deeper one. How it seemed that over the course of his one semester that Dean was sitting closer. Their hands brushing every now and then when they’d reach for their drinks. Dean’s knee brushing against his leg, the man apologizing. Castiel brushing it off with a small, nervous laugh.
Dean smiled, relieved that he didn't have to sit here and listen to the rest of this hocus pocus anymore. He stood to follow the man, hearing Bobby resume a tale his brother had never heard before, despite all the books he’s read.
“Dean, come to your senses! He'll kill you! He'll kill all of us!”
“Our lineage goes back to the start of the First King, on Father’s side,” Emphasizing his point by flipping the rather large tome to show an extremely detailed art of said lineage.
"I'm just saying you've taken a lot of blows to the head." Sam glared at his brother as Dean continued, "I mean, I know the Disney princess hair gives you some padding"
When did his face get so hot? He brought a hand to his cheek, feeling the slight warmth beneath his fingertips.
“I guess the better question would be what the make is?” Dean smiled, heat filling Cas’ cheeks again at the way Dean was looking at him.
Are You Ready?
Now, generations later, He is to marry the grandson of the Dragon Slayer.
Dean wasn’t scared. Try as he might, he wouldn’t be scared of this thing.
Dean eventually turned, noticed that Castiel was dressing before following suit.
He stared at the expanse of sky and ocean before him as he stood at the narrow edge before him.
"I have a better position than this,"
He honestly wanted to call everything she was saying as ridiculous and stay until his shift ended. But there was another part of him wanting to leave. To go to Dean.
He doesn't know what woke him, something like a trombone or some kind of horn, blaring loud enough to wake him from a peaceful slumber.
Castiel nodded, they had brushed on a lot today and if Dean wanted to leave, he wasn’t going to charge him for the remainder of the time.
“So soon?” Dean teased, looking up at him through his lashes while his hands worked their magic. One to slowly massage his balls and the other to pump him achingly slow. Castiel came here for a reason, he reminded himself, his train of thought deterring as he watched Dean lean forward to lick the pearl of pre-cum, his tongue teasing the slit before his lips wrapped around the head. Eyes begging Castiel to have his way with him. Looking away, he could feel the last bit of his stance weakening.
Dean saying something about being a 'Meat Man'.
But what if they had and he just turned a blind eye?
Fist clenched hard enough that his knuckles were turning white, Castiel sat up. Eldon reaching out to grab Castiel, pinching his cheeks together to force him back. Without thinking, or any thoughts at all, Castiel continued forward and used the momentum to smash his forehead into Eldon's. The loud crack and overwhelming dizzy feeling surrounded Castiel as he faltered backward.
She smiled up at Dean before walking around the desk, turns out she was wearing a black dress down to her knees with some wickedly high heels.
“Can we do it again?” the words catching the Therapist off guard. When Castiel looked up from buttoning his shirt, he was met with hopeful eyes that made his heart skip.
“Dean!”
“All the answers will be answered through that door,” With that said, she walked up to the door and placed the four cards into a slot next to it.
“I got you a cake, that’s close enough, right?”
“Wake up,” Castiel called out, unable to do anything to help the man. Dean sat up quickly at his voice, panting as he tried to regain his senses. “Easy, hush now. I heard you scream, so I came running. What's wrong?” he said clearly, his hands up to show he wasn’t going to harm Dean when he flinched away.
Watching the steam rise, he braced himself as he descended into the water. Hissing as his joints were soothed by the heat.
Clenching his fists and plopping himself in his seat once again he mumbled something under his breath.
“So what? You’re going to keep me here until I give myself over to you?” Dean commented.
“Wha-” he stuttered out, feeling something firm press to his back, the hands slowly roaming up and down his chest. The back of his mind was telling him to tear the hands away and look towards the source, but he was frozen. Paralyzed from some unseen force.
“So firing them is out of the question,” was all he said in such a nonchalant manner, causing blue eyes to roll in agitation.
No need to put himself on display for whoever lay on the other side.
Looking up to see where the source came from, Dean took a hesitant step into the spotlight.
Dean’s cock straining with precum, Castiel purposefully neglected it as his hands touched everywhere but there.
“As I said, all answers can be answered if you walk through this door,” The sound of a door opening and closing had Dean turning to see two big men dressed in a suit standing there with their arms crossed and looking in Dean’s direction.
He expected to hear the uncapping of lube, instead, he felt something wet around the rim of his hole.
Dean's heart was racing, his body trembling at the story. Everyone from the village figured they were killed or eaten, this...this was much worse. He turned, eyes downcast as Castiel continued.
Castiel gripped the plug again, pulling it completely out. He stared at the puckering hole once again as he placed the used item on the towel he just produced from his bag.
Taking that cue, Castiel used his free hand to move lower. Past the man's legs, between them as he found what he had been looking for.
“Oomph!” Dean grunted, not having seen the man move, he was suddenly knocked to the ground, those intense blue eyes staring down at him. He heard the man… purr...before leaning down to capture his lips.
“Stay away!"
"He's new, some big corporate bigwig needing some stress relief," Castiel nodded along in understanding. Those secretly gay types. Probably has that apple pie life with a wife, 2.5 kids, white picket fence and dog to boot.
Stuff like this does happen. The easiest way is to either help them relax or stop until the problem relieves itself.
Castiel watched as Dean answered all the questions, feeling a sense of pride at how well he was doing. There was a stutter here and there, but that’s to be expected with the shock, the officer told Castiel.
“Second," Dean continued, grabbing Eldon's attention by adjusting his tie and leaning forward on his elbows, his hands folded together on top of the table. "Before anything goes down, let's move this somewhere else."
“No need, this one is on the house.” Dean gave her a confused look. “I’m the manager and the owner has noticed how much patronage you’ve put into their business. This is a token of their appreciation.”
It was quiet, the hand on his dick pausing.
“All you have to do...is to give yourself...over to me,” each pause, the hands roaming his chest slid lower and lower.
"How did you know that would work?" Castiel asked after slipping out of the brothel.
“Why would I kiss under a poisonous plant that killed Frigga’s beloved Balder?”
He slowed his pace when he saw the housekeeper, Meg, walking towards him, an arm full of towels while giving him a knowing look.
“Where was your mind during the whole encounter?”
Dean let out a shaky breath once he was fully sheathed, the tightness and heat.
"Well. Now then." The cold barrel pushed further into his throat, choking at the lack of oxygen. "You see, Dean, finding out that you had been seeing little Castiel here...I was angry at first. But then, I saw it as a chance. To finally put this boy to use as a perfect bargaining chip… you know, instead of just sucking dick on his days off."
Rolling his eyes, this was ridiculous, he was about to respond when the static on the walkie talkie cut in.
“He’s conscience,” an unfamiliar voice said through the darkness.
“Yeah?”
“Ugh!” Dean gasped out, the strokes were fast and confident, Dean panting at the sensation. Despite the cold hands, the contrast on his cock felt amazing.
“Dean.”
The betrayed look on Dean’s face at the admission had Castiel’s heart drop. He even backed away when Castiel had attempted to reach out for him.
“Fuck!” Dean panted out, sitting on the stool Garth provided after the bell rang indicating the end of the second round.
The abrupt silence made him uneasy, but Cas did barge up to the door right as he sat down. And Dean wasn’t exactly gonna deny his boyfriend on the rehearsing of his speech. Just...not in the bathroom. When he has to take a number 2.
But when Dean made that sucking sound, Castiel couldn’t control his hands as they found themselves gripping Dean’s hair as his hips jutted forward, unintentionally choking the man.
Castiel gave a small huff, indicating he was falling deeper into sleep.
Bold. Dean likes that.
“My Liege,” a voice interrupted whatever he was going to say, turning his attention to the new arrival standing at the door to the throne room.
Before he could do anything else, he felt a finger under his chin, forcing him to turn to look into those glowing blue eyes.
“I-uh,” Dean fumbled, his hands reaching for his pocket where he replaced the cards from earlier. “I got these cards?” holding them up to show her.
He had an hour left until the man's arrival when something burst his bubble.
"Now now," Cas drawled out as Dean watch him reach into his bag. “Can’t have this session end too quickly,”
He couldn’t contain the tears as they fell. This building was his responsibility. His flock. He failed them. All because he couldn’t bring himself to follow a direct order.
“It's the dragon!” Gabriel shouted as he was about to wake the crew to prepare for battle.
“78’ Lincoln Continental, Mark V”
I had the Lovely and Extremely talented "The Friendly Pigeon" commission this amazing piece of art ^.^
He could never make it fly. No matter how creased and sharp he made all the edges, it sunk every time.
Shaking his head, he continued down the hall, stopping once he got to his destination. He had his hand on the handle but was suddenly pushed up against the door, a body firmly pressing against him.
Dean and Cas stood there in awkward silence.
“His body was found,” he breathed out after chugging the ale. “Burnt to a crisp along the main road,” Everyone gasped in horror. “He looked to have been protecting someone. An elderly couple, by the looks of the two bodies behind ‘em,” the man sobbed out.
Castiel pulled his coat closer when a brisk chill blew through, glad that it wasn’t snowing.
“You took almost a two-month break...did something happen with that office client?” Was that concern and irritation in Cas’ voice? Dean was hesitant at first, reluctantly revealing what had happened from the time Castiel left to now.
“How did he die?” The tavern wench shouted above the noise to the man after he graciously accepted a tankard to chug down.
When Castiel came in, the guy was the total Professional that he was supposed to be. Kept the talking to a minimal, did his job with precision because he knew what he was doing and the guy was really gentle.
“Say again,” he all but snarled to the redhead before him.
"Cas-"
"Demon," Dean spat, fists clenching, anger starting to boil under his skin.
Castiel closed his eyes, breathing deep as he braced himself.
“I don’t understand,” Dean started, pulling away from his brother who tried to steer him from the room. “I’m the best you’ve got at finding this thing, better than any of the men you got. Now, of all times, you tell me ‘No’?!”
“Dean, what the hell!” Sam called out abruptly, standing in between Dean and the door.
He grunted in pain when a pulse radiated through him, grunting as the hot flare started to spread from his neck to the rest of his body.
"Sorry, but I'm gonna have to pass. Killing innocent people just doesn't do it for me,"
“Who do you work for?” he repeated.
A small piece of him blamed himself for not believing when he was told these stories from when he was a kid. The tales about magic and creatures alike. But Dean didn’t believe any of it. He couldn’t see any of it.
“Well don’t jinx me-”
When questioned by his father, who was angry with his disobedience, and Bobby, he told them there wasn’t much that he remembered aside from getting knocked out from being thrown against a tree by one of the thieves.
“That’s me.”
“Because you think that if something happens between us and it doesn’t work out, you think I’ll report you to HR or something,”
This upcoming exam. Why did he have to take so many freaking classes?
Amidst the moan of protest, Castiel tore himself from the man’s side to cross the room and out the door.
“Open your eyes, Dean!” Sam nearly shouted into his brother’s face, his grip tightening around Dean’s pinned wrist. His entire body sitting on his older brother’s chest to keep him from moving.
“Okie Dokie” Dean called out as he made his way down the hallway to the main door.
“Bowel movements?”
He tried to hit ‘Run’ again but was met with the same response.
It didn’t take long, probably a fifteen-minute ride with no issues. After parking, he made his way inside, keeping his eyes open for his friends.
Which definitely wasn’t there before.
Then Dean did something that caused Cas to let out a muffled cry.
It was at home.
"Michael said it was just him and you. Is this the main personality?"
“Help me! Please!”
Raising a brow at the question, he clicked yes.
Gasping and moaning at the man’s continued assault, he almost whimpered when the heat suddenly disappeared. Looking up through hooded eyes, he watched Dean just as he pushed his pants down just enough for his own cock to spring free from its confines.
Looking up, Castiel noticed everyone at his table was staring at him.
He was about to click the box but the screen changed, the somewhat familiar black background with the white words saying:
But Dean didn’t go anywhere. He placed a hand under his eye, of course, you can’t feel actual bags under your eyes. He may be getting a lot of sleep, but there's a difference in restful sleep and restlessness. He’s been having dreams.
"You remember now. This means you won't hurt this body," Lucifer tried to move but was stopped by Dean pressing into him harder.
“Hey Castiel, you want to go get pizza?” Glancing up, he nodded, taking note of the character on the screen looking almost saddened.
Dean bit his bottom lip, head falling back as Cas began to pump his cock. His body shook as he tried to hold back from cumming too soon.
The guy is freaking straight!
All the curtains had been drawn closed by the heavy material, casting the entire room into a pitch-black abyss. But he can see perfectly.
“No...it doesn’t have anything to do with your comics.” Castiel huffed, rolling his eyes. “The legend Balder, who had a dream of death which worried his mother Frigga. Upon learning of this, she went to all corners of the earth, speaking to the air, fire, water, earth, the animals and plants, seeking a promise that no harm would come to her son.
“Of course I am.” Castiel cut off. “If one of those servants hadn’t signed a full disclosure agreement when they started working for you and had seen what you just did, they wouldn’t think twice to sell the story to the highest bidder,”
It was all over the news and social media. People were even chanting “All hail the new founding fathers”
“He hasn’t done a thing to me. If anything, he’s helped me see clearer than what you’ve kept from me my entire life. Thanks to breaking that vase, I’ve never felt better.” Dean could feel the anger now boiling within him, rolling off him in waves.
While Cas became a whimpering, panting mess, his grip on Dean alternating between loose to a vice-like grip, feeling himself getting harder and harder from the friction of Dean rubbing against him.
"I-I can't accept such a generous tip." Castiel stuttered out after placing the last cup down, eyes falling on the outstretched hand with the bill held out in his direction.
“Another,” he demanded, the utter silence was deafening. But no one questioned him as one of the servants placed a nervous-looking person before him. Shaking as they looked around, trying to figure out where they were.
“Take a deep breath and relax,” Castiel warned as he added pressure to get the item past the ring of muscle. He heard Dean grunt at the intrusion, panting a little as he fought to control his breathing.
"Sir?" Castiel questioned, gazing down at the man. Dean had his eyes downcast, his free hand sitting on the table in a clenched fist. Castiel watched as Dean pushed the food away.
But Dean did pop his head up and turn it towards Cas, who was sitting on the floor next to him, in time to make eye contact with him.
“Have you tried to run away?”
He wasn’t expecting the grim look on the man's face at the revelation.
he chastised to himself. His moment to shake the man's hand away was thwarted when Dean used both hands to bring Cas’s hand to his cheek.
Dean woke up feeling a little lightheaded. The thunderous storm outside his window wasn’t helping.
“Are you ready?” Castiel spoke softly, a cue for Dean to take his fingers away and push his gaping hole in Castiel’s direction. That and the needy look in the man's eyes as he looked over his shoulder at him. He guided Dean to grasp the metal headboard next to them as he positioned himself on the bed, lining himself up before slowly pushing in.
“Bedroom,”
After he woke up four days later after the incident in the woods, everything did not feel the same. Off putting would be the word.
He was planning his surprise attack, the feel of a cold blade against his neck halting him from doing anything else.
“Maybe he’s just a generous tipper in general?” Castiel tried, letting the mop plop on the ground, wondering where that new stain under the table came from.
"Don't go! What about the new man? Remember? He needs me!" He begged, taking a step forward to grab at Cas.
“Does it feel good,” Dean whispered into the crook of his neck, his hand starting to stroke Castiel at an agonizingly slow pace.
Moving his hand to the back of the man's head to keep it steady, he jerked his hips up, earning the noise he was craving.
"Hey Cas, right on time," Dean quipped, holding a hand out, gesturing for Castiel to come in.
The woman, the blade digging into her chest, her body flashing orange then black internally before collapsing to the floor.
“Rest now,” Castiel murmured to the man, brushing hair from the man's sweaty brow. “I’ll return,”
“The dragon will never harm you, Dean. Ever. I promise.” Dean watched the man pull out the gift he gave him, holding it out for him to see. “A new man was born last night, remember?” Castiel defended, his words strong liked his word. “Because of you. And he needs you.” Dean gave a wobbly smile, Castiel’s hand a meer inch from him before standing up.
He stared in horror as the man stood up straighter from his leaning position on the rail of the Life Guard tower. His ID tag dangling from his lanyard, the name "Castiel" next to a headshot.
Castiel groaned deep in his throat, praising Dean at being such a fast learner. The hum in response and the way Dean moved his tongue as he sucked nearly finished Cas. Luckily he pulled away in time, ignoring the look of disappointment.
He didn’t get very far though.
Reaching down for the lube, he uncapped it and squirt a generous amount into his hand. Tossing the bottle back into his bag, he took the mans’ length in his left hand, swiping his thumb over the slit to smear the precum there and moved his hand around the length to smear the lube.
The man laughed, shaking his head before looking towards Sam.
Contemplating whether he wanted to go back to the throne room, he paused mid-step at the familiar feeling.
He shivered at the thought.
“Uriel,” he murmured, the man’s eyes not lifting to greet him. His chest was heaving from the latest torture session.
Running a hand through his hair, he let out a loud sigh throughout his empty house.
Meg gave his shoulder a small push, Castiel’s body moved before his mind and he was out of the door in no time. He unchained his bike and peddled home as fast as he could.
“It’s a classic. But I’ve never seen a Chevy Impala in person.”
Room #4, which was at the end of the hallway. Perfect.
The voice demanded, the image of a man’s body standing between his legs, towering above him as he stroked Dean.
He paused. His mind raced as he tried to remember. Something. Anything. But all he could come up with was the need to touch the man before him and he didn’t know why.
Except for the small argument the two had right as Dean was leaving.
Looking around to make sure the coast was clear, there was no one, before taking a tentative step forward from his hiding spot across the street.
“You're alive!” he breathed out, relieved that he was ok.
Rachel was close, her face right next to his ear. Her fingers inching up his suit to his tie, her fingers fixing it before lifting a hand to adjust his collar.
I hope everyone enjoyed ^^ please comment and kudo
"Juac, tie him up, and please do something about that mouth if he's not gonna go silently," the third man uttered towards Dean, watching him bring a hand to rub at his temple.
“Well...Sometimes it's something I'm scared of, sometimes it's something I long for…” Dean trailed off, his head dropping to his knees, mumbling out the next phrase. “I'm really scared of the dragon, Castiel.” A shaky exhale before continuing, the images of the Dragon flashing through his mind. Dean was standing before the beast, his hand had just reached out to the touch the scales. It was peaceful for a moment before the thing reared its head to drown him in flames. “All this time I've been…preparing to…”
"You don't know the tale?" They questioned.
“Lies,” he hissed and Castiel could see the anger raging in Eldon’s eyes. “Coffee dates, sitting at
I don't know what this is, but I couldn't sleep until I wrote it. It's based on this song: https://youtu.be/gNarAFhOw1I
“And you can show me more of this kinky side of yours,” The wink through Castiel off guard for the second time.
“If you’ll come this way,”
"This will be my third time."
I hope everyone enjoys :D
“That’s right up Cassie’s alley, isn’t that right?"
“I want to know what’s going on with you.”
“Yeah,” his fangs slowly descended, Castiel taking in the missing ones that had been extracted. “You can go to hell.”
The way Castiel stroked him in tandem with the thrusts of the toy to leaving his hand still, making Dean thrust forward and back for the friction while impaling himself with the toy.
“Besides,” Dean continued, standing up to cross the distance between the two so he could pat his brother on the shoulder. “Having a night out with your older brother will do
“I don’t know Doc, maybe there’s something wrong with me,” Dean admitted while distracting Castiel from finishing his sentence.
He couldn’t keep the smile off his face, urging his horse to ride faster after clearing the first gate. The guards looking on in question at his passing, but not daring to halt the Prince.
The games of chess that Dean kept losing after showing the man how to play when they discovered the board and pieces in one of the chests.
“Hey Bobby, did you get that?” He muttered into it with his eyes laser-focused on the area before him.
"Alright," taking a long swig of his beer, almost draining it, before slamming it on the table. "You got any idea on where they could have taken him?" Crossing his arms and leaning against the table.
The metallic color of the vase, embellished with depictions of leaves and vines with a full moon standing out amongst the design.
“Who are you really?
His heart gave a loud thump, a sound only Cas could hear but a strike of fear followed suit at the familiar feeling. Itching at the back of his mind when his heartbeat picked up speed.
The message closed out to display his character in the middle of the room, arms out as if trying to get his attention.
Head dropping, he tried to compose himself from his kneeling position. The humming under his skin as it tried to pull himself together in order to continue his path but he ignored it. Raising a hand to the man’s forehead, he whispered:
Staring with animal blood until he was able to regain his strength, using his pathetic stature on people to lure them in, sucking the blood until they looked like a dried-up corpse.
“Funny, I thought the same thing,” Dena commented, noticing he was able to move his pinky. He tested other parts of his body, foot, hand then his head. He was able to move it slightly.
Looking up after preventing himself from falling, he saw Dean staring at him with wide eyes. Face flushed as he took in his own appearance, lifting his gaze to meet Castiel’s.
“She's running late,” Hannah supplied while pulling out the flashcards.
"Bingo!"
“I can always come back-”
He really loves that man.
Dean kept his eyes sweeping left and right, searching for anyone that could pop out or a possible trap.
“Fight them,” Sam commented, surprising Castiel enough to where he turned to look at the man.
“Drop your pants and lay over the armrest,” Castiel told him after regaining his composure. This was only Dean’s second time being dominated. He knows better than to rush as he watched Dean do as he said.
Others were whispering about how Prince Samuel, the one who was to become the advisor of the late Prince, will have to take up the throne now. Even though he’d make a great King, he was no Dean.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, placing a hand on his cheek, urging him to look at him. Kneeling down to be on the same level. He watched them take a couple of deep breaths, finally moving to look at Dean.
“Dean you don’t want to do this, you’re still under the Incubus’ spell,” when Dean pushed Cas onto the bed.
“Always so unsure,” he murmured. The next thing Cas knew it, he was being turned around, his back being pushed against the door. His pants were unfastened before he could speak, gasping when those delicious lips wrapped around his slowly hardening length.
Smashing the heel of his hand into his eyes, he shook his head.
"Dean, are you- you know we- we talked about this," Cas stuttered out when he saw Dean pull out a box from his pocket.
He was naive!

And that’s how the rest of the breakfast went and dinner. Dean kept to himself as his parents and brother continued on. Hearing his father talking about political leaders coming to stay to negotiate terms on a treaty. His mother was speaking with one of her handmaid's about something personal. Sam was busy inhaling his food, probably in order to get back to his studying. Everyone just seemed normal, like Dean hadn’t been knocked out days ago.
Before either could say anything, Dean was on his knees between Cas’ legs, sucking the tip between his lips. Hissing at the sensation, Castiel restrained from bucking into the man’s mouth. Instead, opting to hold the back on the man’s neck to guide him up and down.
It’s true, Dean’s never been into his family history, that’s Sam’s job. He learned all he knows from Bobby and his father.
"You know what, I thought about it. This is just fine. Michael's vessel. It's perfect. We keep you, Dean, in a secure location so Michael doesn't interfere with our plans,"
“I'll teach you to see the wind,” While taking a hesitant step toward him. Being bold as to stand so close. A hand on the kite, guiding Dean’s hand raise as he whispered in his ear. “Close your eyes. Look in the distance, further than you can see with your eyes open.” Raising the kite higher, holding it still as Castiel continued to instruct him “Feel the wind with your fingertips, and hear its whisper. Feel it with your skin. Then, you will find something inside you that you didn't know was there.”
“I know” was all Dean said as he decided to layout on the couch, his attention focused on the ceiling.
That being said, Castiel had witnessed the comings and goings over the years of all Mr. Winchesters exploits as they attempted to leave in the mornings. Castiel not saying a word but being kind enough to extend them breakfast as a courtesy
When he arrived at the end of the strip, he gave an irritated huff, turning in his seat to look back a where he came from.
Dean chalked it up to the good luck he always seemed to have. As for this jitteriness? He couldn’t quite put a nail in that one.
It wasn’t like the guy was the one to end it with Castiel.
"Hold on!" Dean went to chase after them when they began to retreat, stopping only when the clap of lightning struck above. He looked up to witness the branches bending, giving way to reveal the blackened sky above, the moon disappearing behind a dark cloud.
Dean. When the time came...he shook his head.
“I’m not going in there without any answers first,” Dean all but growled out, not caring if he’s acting like a child, but this was ridiculous! He had no clue what was going on.
Which is why he finds himself in the hallway, leaning against the door to his bedroom. His mate inside. He can feel the stress and lust mixing into the air and it was driving him crazy.
He continued with his female clientele, only meeting with the male clients if they were the ones that just wanted companionship.
"I know about the boat." Castiel interrupted. Not wanting to hear what Dean had to say. "I know why you didn't want to stay in the pit: you wanted to escape."
"What? You don't like being proven wrong?" Another smack.
He’d been lied to. His whole life. Even though everyone tried to tell him that it was real. They were all two-faced. He couldn’t see any of this, the proof. Like everyone was amusing him by saying such a thing existed so they could get a rise out of him even though they were secretly hiding the truth.
“I know. Father must be off his rocker if he won’t let me fetch a stupid
Dean smiled, his gaze looking towards the floor then back to Cas.
"Fuck," Dean muttered, easily guiding himself all the way down to the base. He slowly pulled back before slamming back in.
Turning his eyes suspiciously around the place, his hand reaching for a cloth to settle over his privates. He was met with a tsking sound.
He patted himself for his wand, stooping to his bag, and came to a startling realization.
‘No, ‘m not,’ he defended, trying to push away the hands but to avail.
The small gasp from moving, the tightness in his pants rubbing along the cloth, had the man turning his head. Sharp blue eyes glued Dean to the spot, noticing the man’s lips pulling up to reveal sharp canines beneath.
"Yer Majesty," she redhead finally said after some time, watching the man leaning against the backrest, taking deep breaths in. “To be honest. This spell was created by the witches who cast the spell. It may just be a slight side effect. It may take a day or two for himself to adjust to everything.”
“You haven’t stopped training since you got back,” Sam started and Dean can tell he was about to start his lecture on Dean’s recent habits.
“No,” Dean said a little too quickly. “Just after that night, I took a break.”
“Yeah-yeah, try not to speak,” Dean muttered out, holding his hand to the man's wound. Just as his hand began to glow a faint green color, he was stopped by Bobby’s bloodied hand moving it away. “Bobby, don’t be stupid!”
Of course, the added hot chocolate and pizza was Dean’s idea as they settled in for the night. The Christmas lights around the apartment gave a soft light for both of them as they watched their movie in peace, enjoying each other’s company.
He could die, right then and there, instead of having to sit through this. Dean was going to die at Eldon’s hands and everything would become much worse for him. He’ll be taken out of school, he’ll be forced to leave this job, just when he was feeling somewhat independent from the Frankstein family.
Walking closer to the edge, he turned around and looked skyward. Taking a deep breath, he leaned back, his feet leaving the rocky edge as he began to fall.
When he looked up to meet Cas’s eyes once again, something caught his attention to the left of him. Embedded into the floor was a bullet hole. The wisps of dust and dirt were just settling when Dean turned his attention back to the man before him. A small sigh escaped his lips as he stood, the chair giving a slight squeak, before walking around the table. He adjusted his black pinstriped jacket before loosening his blue tie as Castiel leaned against the front of the desk, the gun still in hand pointing towards its intended target.
Sam’s eyebrows raised at the offer. They hadn’t been there in a while.
It was when Cas' tongue disappeared and a very manly whimper escaped Dean's lips did he look over his shoulder.
He slowly walked forwards, the warmth guiding him like gentle hands towards it. Stepping into the darkness, eyes adjusting enough to notice a figure leaning against the wall. Arms crossed, the only thing Dean could make out was the glowing blue eyes before falling unconscious.
Stay tune and subscribe, there will be a sequel at some point.😁
"Well, you kind of have to, you know, on a night like this," to emphasize his point, Dean clicked the hammer back on the revolver.
"Think of this as," he paused, getting off the bed so he could stare at the naked man before him. "Payback. For making me stand outside your door while you and whomever you brought home that night, listening to everything going on,"
“Touche me-please-Cas,” he didn’t need to be told twice, his hands traveling lower at an agonizing speed, getting lost in the pleasured moan when his fingers wrapped around the weeping cock.
Castiel shifted away from Anna’s hand to move around and disappeared into what Dean assumed was the back kitchen area.
After shutting the door, Castiel took in the familiar settings of the apartment. A kitchen set right next to the doorway, the spacious living room before him with a dining room off to the left. The hallway next to the kitchen leading down to the bedroom and bathroom.
“Oh! Which one is it?” Charlie enthused, capping her marker to scoot closer.
Castiel stumbled in his steps when his eyes settled on the man, who definitely couldn’t be Dean because he wasn’t wearing his usual attire.
“Were you looking forward to your usual, Bacardi Cocktail?” Crowley's voice after noticing the look on the man's face.
“Stop spouting nonsense and let me heal you,”
“Smooth Dean.” Sam chastised.
Another hard smack had Dean biting his lip, the stinging and the plug still in his ass, swiftly followed by three more smacks to either cheek.
The people were silent.
Cas, Dean had nicknamed him.
"Let's hit up The Purgatory lounge tonight, what do you say?" She purred, her hand trailing downwards. He caught her before she made any other 'attempt' to 'rile' him up.
Dean felt his stomach sink, connecting the pieces together.
The wind picked up around them, Dean letting go a second later as his eyes opened to watch the kite rise higher and higher. They watched it fly through the clouds and wind. Dean smiling through it all. Both of them had their hand on the string.
The guy’s response was to stand straight up, reaching under the table for a bottle, pouring a generous amount into Castiel’s glass before placing it in front of him.
"Stay with me this way for a while. Let me get used to you," Dean murmured, unable to keep the smile off his face as his hand hesitantly rested on the scales, gently moving it back and forth. He watched Cas’ close its eyes, leaning into the touch.
Green eyes looked up at the mention of his name, moving up to capture the man’s lips with his as Dean’s hands continued its conquest.
...It saw you.
Dean didn’t care. The close proximity. He wanted it. He leaned a little into the man, his hand touching Cas’, eyes closed when the side of his head rested on the man’s cheek.
“Tell me what you want,” Castiel asked, his hand on his cock through the material, slowly stroking it as he kept the man’s gaze.
Castiel had just placed the dinner plate in front of the man, intending to grab the napkin to place it on his lap when a grip on his wrist stopped him.
"If he gets ahold of that vase, this will have all been for nothing!" Shouted knife guy temporarily distracted as they turned their anger towards their companion. Taking the opportunity, Dean pulled one of the knives out of the tree trunk, throwing without aiming towards the owner.
“Your shift started an hour ago, you can’t be asking those types of questions anymore,” Castiel finally said to the she-demon, taking in her still lounging position from where he was restocking the shelves with freshly made herbs.
He looked at the health bar to see it was maxed out in the green, so there was nothing else to do at the moment.
Never had he had a client affect him the way Dean did just then?
“I hate puzzles,” Meg murmured under her breath. “I prefer the straight to the point,”
him despite disappearing on him.

Sure, why not? He's kept everything else. He clicked the yes. He tried to search for anything else but a bubble popped up saying there was nothing else to find.
"Let's take you and I for example," he said while gesturing between them. "I care a lot...a lot about you, and Christmas is my better way of showing it,"
alive,"
“He is summoning him!” Michael shouted, scrambling to his feet. “Dean, don't!”
“It flew away,” he mumbled, turning in his spot. “Castiel? Castiel, where are you?”
Pulling at the taped edge, he carefully unwrapped it, trying not to rip the paper. A weird habit he’s picked up pm. Why waste perfectly good paper when you can reuse it?
"Yeah, fine,"
“Hang in there Cas,” he called out, turning around to grab the biggest rock he could find to beat against the wall repeatedly. Two more hits sent the wall crumbling before him, giving way to another area.
Hearing a
“Dean, I have a question,” Castiel murmured after inhaling, smoke escaping from his lips after he pulled the cigarette away.
“Hey there,” Dean mumbled out, attempting a smile to the man.
“So you’re having an office fuck. You haven’t had one of those before,” Castiel commented as he pulled the gloves on and moving to place himself directly behind Dean “How are you feeling?” while placing a hand on man’s ass, the other grabbing the lube.
“I’m almost ready,” Castiel’s voice called down the stairs.
“Well… I’m a little concerned,” he started slowly as he watched Dean plop himself onto the couch near the fireplace, watching his brother as he sat himself across from him, elbows on his knees.
“What about Sam,” Dean managed out between clenched teeth, eyes looking firmly at the man as he took in the information.
Dean was the first to hop out when the engine cut off, sprinting around the impala to open the door for Cas, snapping him out of his gaze.
“I have a boyfriend.” The words blurted out, the shocked expression on the boy's face at doing so. Dean’s brain stopped for a moment, wondering how that even came up.
“You’re much tighter than usual,” Good thing Cas couldn’t see Dean’s face, it’s probably as red as a tomato. “When was the last time you had any prepping done?”
“Nothing!”
“Cas…it’s true. He told me you didn’t deserve to inherit the main branch of the family! That the right was Michael’s by birth.” Panic ringing in his ears as Dean tried to get as much of the information out without fumbling over his words, knowing his chances are narrowing by knowing there’s a 1 out 3 chance the bullet could be next.
“Yes,” feeling warmth spread throughout his body as Castiel nodded his head.
“I tried what you suggested and...it just didn’t do it for me,”
“What made you go for a female this time?”
But then the way Cas had looked at Dean popped in his head.
Looking out the window, the buildings became less and less, more trees became visible. Ahead of them, Castiel could make out a thin glow above the trees not too far ahead.
It was six in the morning when he opened his door, walking as lightly as he could into the living room. The occupant was asleep on the couch, the blanket covering them entirely from his view.
(See the end of the chapter for
A moan from below had him turning his attention to watch just as the dirty blonde head lower farther onto his cock.
Eldon had waved at Dean with the gun in his hand, indicating for him to join them just before placing the barrel of the gun in Castiel’s lap, the thing cocked which made Castiel freeze.
Dean wished he could feel embarrassed when he came shortly after, Castiel not saying a word as he continued. His hips stuttered not long after.
Both wearing gloves, Garth holding the kit with all the medical necessities and the water bottle.
“Oh,” Castiel managed out, this story was new, his gaze catching how the memory Dean was remembering managed to move the indicator of his meter over the line into yellow by just a hair.
“Who did what,” she prodded, noticing up close the slight tinting of pink to his cheeks.
They rushed back down the aisle to the back room just in time to hear the door smash open.
“What are you doing?!” Dean cried out a second later when that grip tightened, pulling Dean’s arm through the hole to his side.
He stared at those words for a while. Castiel didn’t know how to respond to that. But he did know what could say,
a voice whispered in the back of his mind, Dean snapping out of it by shaking his head. Where did that come from?
Dean has only seen drawings of the item in question, the books didn’t do the item justice as it shined in the beam of moonlight.
He watched the cloud of dust float from the pages.
“Sorry,” Cas apologized, one hand holding both ice packs to the mans’ asscheeks.
Not even a half-hour later, while Dean was placing a steaming cup of coffee on the table for another gentleman, the man had shaken his right hand. A weird gesture of thanks for bringing the coffee he ordered. Receiving a card in response was another surprise.
Cas could feel his face heating up at the same time, biting his lip to stifle any noise, he heard the loud conversations on the other side of the door.
Dean raised his arms as it came closer, allowing the creature to wrap its claws around him. Lifting him easily off the boat and into the sky.
Dean hummed, not paying attention, giving a particularly loud suck to Cas' neck causing the man below him to grip tighter right as he started convulsing.
"I saved you?" Dean questioned with a coy smile. "Aw shucks, does that make me your hero?"
The intruder managed to sneak in through an open window, which Dean had told him early on before the cops showed how the weather felt nice and but he didn’t want to go outside because he was watching a movie called “Tangled”.
“Black Coffee,” a feminine voice announced, a familiar cardboard cup was placed before him. He looked at the pale hand, delicate and sharp nails, up the arm to a familiar redhead.
Click.
Hope everyone enjoyed this :D
Looking back at the man, who had his eyes closed and lips puckered, ready for a kiss.
Bobby’s voice breaking the silence around him. Turning in place Dean started hustling in that direction.
The closer he got, the distant murmuring could be heard. Ducking down, he crawled the rest of the distance to a bush that separated him from the campfire of unfamiliar looking men.
Over his chest, down to his hips, grabbing at his ass before moving to the front to give Dean’s fully erect cock a stroke or two. Precum dripping down the length.
"Another?" He questioned once he got close enough, his hand already reaching under the table to grab the necessary bottle.
As quickly as the onslaught started, it vanished, leaving Dean a wrecked mess as he removed the covers to see his little “accident”.
“And from what I can tell...you feel the same,” Castiel had to hold back the gasp when the palm of Dean’s hand found itself on his groin. Not realizing he’d let the thoughts of those dreams affect him. “Please,” Dean whispered, his hand moving slightly, rubbing along the growing length.
The guards were picking up the books while Sam and Mary stood off to the side. Dean was about to turn away when the site of Sam extending his arm caught his eye.
He was met with silence.
Dean walked closely beside Castiel as he fumbled slightly up the steps, the awkward silence in the elevator up to the fourth floor, and taking forever to find the right key for the door.
The hall was clear, the sun was setting below the tree line as he made his way to the dining hall.
Dean nodded in understanding, having seen proof of this in the books.
"Well look what we have here, boys," the second voice chuckled at the sight of Dean. "He saved us the-ow!"
Nodding at the word, Castiel moved behind him, kneeling to take in the site. Surprised at how smooth and hairless the man was. He was going to say something about it but decided that’d be for another day.
“Simple misdirection spell, he’s aware of magic and creatures. But something as dark as an Alpha Vampire living trapped within his kingdom would not have gone over well.” Hands shaking, Dean let go of the man’s shirt to stand. The outrage sparked within him again, but before he could plan his next move Bobby continued talking. “Your Mother wanted to protect this kingdom. Just like her ancestors.”
Also, I went back to chapter 1 and 2, I edited/updated them. Fixed little nuggets of mistakes and added a little more if you want to go back and read :D
“It’s a puzzle though,” Castiel clarified, shifting some of the cards so they could go another round.
He is now a specialized sex therapist.
That interested the Alpha immensely. He rose to his feet, the urge to break something rising given his frustration.
Down the hallway and to the bedroom.
Her eyes at the site.
“It’s fake,”
“Cas, what are you doing here,” the man asked, looking out into the hallway before silently shutting the door and locking it.
Sam gave him a skeptical face, rubbing his hands together.
“You’re good,” Dean commented after taking a deep breath.
When the girl woke hours later, with him still being awake, the sight of her walking around the room to gather her clothes with her perfectly shaped bottom, perky breasts, and soft creme-colored skin-
It was quiet.
“You two are living together and yet you introduced me, your slutty best friend, to this man. This Adonis with green eyes and a rockin’ body that I know for a fact you’d be all over if we were still in college. And yet you passed him off to me,”
“There you are, Castiel. Look at what I made,” Castiel glanced from his hunched position, the fire finally receding as he took back control. “It looks like a dragon, but it won't fly. Will you teach me to see the wind?”
Sam watched his brother take off, his heart hammering in his chest as he turned to run out of the room to find his father.
Especially when they were a patient.
"One, I am the second oldest of four brothers,"
"We've known each other for...what...15 years?"
Weightlessness, soaring, it wasn't until his back slammed into something solid, knocking all the air out of his lungs before crashing to the floor.
Dean always keeping the situation light between them with jokes and entertaining stories. But this was different.
He glanced at his dash to see the time, nearly dropping his phone when he realized it was almost ten.
<3 <3 <3
But overall, he was stuck on an emotion he couldn't quite pinpoint.
*tips toes in to quietly post this chapter and runs away*
Mixed signals. Wires crossing. Brain function overload.
Lucifer chuckled.
“How do you know it's a guy?”
“I’m not kissing you under the mistletoe, regardless. It’s still poisonous.”
“So good,” the words purred in his ear, their hands sliding over his naked torso.
He did as he was told, after watching Cas remove the latex gloves, his knees spread apart with his arms and head resting on the backrest.
. I don't think you understand my current situation,”
When Dean woke, through his blurry vision, he could see the flickering lights of candles in the darkened room.
Even though Castel thought Christmas wasn’t as joyous of an occasion, he wasn’t one to dismiss giving presents to the ones he cared about. They only had Dean’s parents and Gabriel to buy for, he also took the opportunity to check the order status of other packages they were expecting, smiling when they all said delivered.
Dean, peeked his eye open, blinking until the fuzziness cleared so he was able to see clearly.
“Please,” Dean all but whispered under his breath, wanting to move but that knowing that doing so wouldn’t earn him what he’s craving.
“Oh, Sam. Hello,” he replied. “What are you doing here so early?”
A moment later the door to the cafe opened, Dean, shifting as he looked over his shoulder.
“Well clearly it’s not,” he huffed out. “Bring me the witch,”
Looking around, he noticed everyone was peering up at the sky in fear.
The room was simple, a queen size bed with a comfortable-looking blue comforter. A lot of fluffy pillows at one end. One nightstand, a dresser, a closest off to the right with an attached bathroom next to it. Pretty plain based on the rooms Castiel has seen since working for the company.
What the hell was going on?!
“I needed to see you-” he was interrupted when the man nearly ran across the room into his arms, kissing him before he could say anything else.
Raising a brow at the question, Castiel nodded his head as he was lead down the hall. When Dean first started using their services, Castiel had remembered the man asking if they could use the bedroom.
Ignoring the pain, he sat up to look around.
Which is the only explanation. The pain in his neck pulsed in agitation. He brought a hand up to grab at the spot, teeth clenching as he fell onto his bed to curl in on himself.
He relished the cool air conditioning after he finally made it to work, looking around at the less than crowded coffee shop. Nodding to Inias, who was currently taking a customer’s order, before hobbling to the back to put his apron on and put his helmet somewhere.
“Fixing up my car.”
Castiel took a deep breath, scooting onto the bed, feeling Dean's dick slip out.
Dean anxiously looked at his watch, ten minutes to seven, turning his attention out the window to the slowly setting sun. He took a deep breath, a hand on one of the bars to make sure they were secure. Turning towards the room, it wasn’t that big, but it was enough to fit a handful of people comfortably. A cot in one corner, three computer screens on the wall with a desk settled underneath them and a big cabinet off to the side filled with necessities such as food, water, and guns.
Castiel couldn’t help himself, feeling the man’s throbbing cock as it rubbed against his stomach. He brought a hand up, wrapping his fingers around the thickness as the tip dripped with precum.
He felt his chest warm when the thoughts of their quiet evenings together came to mind, Dean cooking dinner for him, watching the man take care of his garden, watching him work with his shirt off…
Why was he so distracted? Castiel shifted his eyes away from the world outside to the lone coffee cup across from him. He was already finished with his own and he distantly wondered if the other coffee was cold by now.
“But you never answered any,” A smirk on her face, resting her cheek in her propped hand as she watched the man squirm.
Neither one made a move, as if the man was waiting for him to make the first move.
“Now or Never” Castiel could swear he heard the man whisper before hands were cupping either side of Castiel's neck.
The one time Dean walked away from the counter to bring someone their order was when this man decided to leave and conveniently bumped into Dean in the process. After apologizing to the couple he was bringing the drinks to, calling to Charlie to refill the order for free, he turned and started the same process with the man.
The woman nodded her head, a quiet settled upon them as they watched the villagers walk by.
"A Ritual?" Bobby questioned, disbelief in his voice.
The people of his village stood at the edge of the water, cheering while throwing petals and rice into the air in celebration. He smiled while looking around, dressed in his family’s traditional attire for the ceremony.
“We gotta go,” Sam stated after answering the phone, eliciting a whine from Rachel as she was forced to stand and Dean joining her a moment later.
“You liked it,” Castiel after a few beats of silence. “He did something different,” he gauged, head tilting to the side. He was curious.
“But then after the first session, you were all I could think about,”
Castiel wanted to fight, wanted to demand to know why he was led on, but the anger in the Dean's eyes was wavering. He could see the edges of hurt and regret with the tears threatening to fall.
“So..” drawing out the pause, his eyes looking everywhere but at Dean. His gaze landing somewhere on the ceiling, a small smile gracing his lips before dropping into a firm line, it didn’t last long when a small chuckle came out when he looked to the gun in his hand. “You’ve placed me in quite a situation here, Dean.”
He didn’t get too far when a hissing noise slowly grew louder. Turning around, he was met with gold eyes shining through the darkness.
Don’t get him wrong, it was...awesome, the best in a while. But the satisfaction just wasn’t there.
Shifting onto his front, he didn't get very far when his left arm was stopped by something cold around the wrist, the sound of something scraping along the floor after he did so. Testing the restraint, he came to the conclusion that he was handcuffed. He sat up, awkwardly slouched over from not being able to sit up properly.
Dean enjoys both but when it comes to performing... He just comes up flat.
He felt the other hand at his closed eye, forcing it open as he leaned close enough to where their noses barely touched. Staring straight into Dean.
“Give me your hand,” Dean half demanded half asked as he held his own out. He watched the man lift up his own hand to stare at it.
“Go back to bed,” was all he said in between the conversation after noticing their presence. His face a mix of exhaustion from being woken in the middle of the night and stress from whatever is going on. Brow furrowed as he spoke to his men as if his sons weren’t there. Some of those men bowing before dismissing themselves to carry on whatever task they were assigned.
He didn’t have long to chose when they heard rapid footsteps heading their way. Dropping it right then and there, the two sprinted down the dark alleyway.
But truly...Dean loves it.
Castiel had just managed to get the toy up the hilt when he heard a strangled noise. He paused.
“No idea.” The man scolded, jerking his head away from the weapon. Dean chuckled under his breath, eyes dropping to the floor, a small smirk on his face.
"I-I've never…" his voice trailing off, his grips tightening on Dean.
He nearly puked when he saw the blood begin to circle around the scattered remains, swirling upwards into a small tornado, the mix of red and gray, hovering over the ground.
“How did the royal family manage to come up with a spell to trap me?” He placed the pointed end of the pin to Uriel’s temple, slowly pushing in. At first, the man tried to hold in the noise, breathing ragged, eventually succumbing to the pain, cursing and shouting.
"Now how'd you manage to fit that great big thing into that little ol' Speedo?"
Dean never believed in all the “tales of olde” or the “fairy tales” that were told to him and his brother by their parents when they were younger. To him, it was a load of crap. The only explanation as to why creatures aren’t alive today is after a dark force was locked away, all magical creatures cut themselves off from all mankind.
“Dean,” a voice interrupting Dean’s train of thought. He looked up, unable to suppress the low chuckle at the man’s appearance.
“D-Dean you have-have to stop. It’s coming back,” Castiel stuttered, a hand coming up to press on the man’s chest, trying to scoot away.
His last appointment was a single guy in his late twenties. This would be their third session together.
She smirked at him and gestured to the entirety of the place. “Everything is legal during the purge,” her smirk turning into a smile, all teeth showing including the fake canine teeth she was sporting, “We focus on one of the most important aspects of human nature: Pleasure,”
"Get. Out." Dean brought the tip of the blade to Lucifer's throat till a pearl of blood form followed by a white light spilling from the wound.
The screens on the computers blacked out for a moment, multiple live camera feeds pulling up a second later, covering all areas surrounding the bunker.
"It is quite alright, this wasn't even my favorite suit," the man with blue eyes and just walked out of bed hair stated, gladly accepting the napkins from the now nervous man.
“It’s...hard to explain,” now that piqued her interest, enough so that she swung her legs down from her relaxed position, sauntering over to the man with a small smile on her face.
Needless to say, someone’s icing may have gotten a hole in it down the line, which ended up on someone’s face. The retaliation of the other squirting some back.
“Such a good boy,” he cooed, moving his hand to grip Castiel’s chin between his two fingers, eliciting a wince from the blue-eyed man. “Come with me.” It wasn’t a suggestion, more of a demand as he let go, stepping back with an expectant look on his face. Glancing at Inias, who was in awestruck, gave a small incline of his head as a nod of approval.
Dean stared, completely entranced by the item. His heartbeat quickening at the site, mouth suddenly dry when his eyes saw the item in person.
“You have to leave, please,” he begged, Dean, watching as tears began to slip down his face.
his only thought when they came to him in the first place. The meter above was a clear indication that neither one was satisfied with the relationship.
"You know what Dean..." his words cutting through Dean's instantly, his mouth snapping shut. Castiel Novak used his gun to scratch the back of his head. Internally flinching, Dean said nothing as he brought his hands behind his back, holding his wrist to stand at attention, the barrel was pointed towards him again.
"Enough!"
A common occurrence Castiel has heard before.
Crying out in pain as he fell to the ground, he reached a shaky hand into the pocket of his robe, pulling out the Ocarina.
"You brought me the wrong brother!" At that, he turned and knocked everything that was sitting on the altar off. He picked up a cup off the floor before throwing it in a random direction.
Castiel heard and felt the unbuckling of his belt, the zipper being pulled down, hissing when the warm hand pressed against his dick through the material of his underwear. He felt Dean’s face move closer, the smooth skin of his shaved chin touching his cheek. The cologne he was wearing sending shudders through Castiel’s body, his legs nearly collapsing when he felt a light kiss to his neck. One after another, covering Castiel’s entire neck as Dean’s hand continued to torment him through the cloth.
It didn’t take long for him to drain the body, tossing it to the side with the other as he sat back in his seat, enjoying the bittersweet taste. Watching wearily as his servants began removing their lifeless bodies.
If he thought the castle was bad, the entire village had so many more magical beings walking around. Nodding to him or curtsying to him as they acknowledged his presence. He tried to keep a straight face to not gawk, returning their gesture in kind.
“Thank you for coming to my rescue,” he thanked when Michael came up to wrap a blanket around his shoulders. Dropping to one knee before Dean to fit the blanket comfortably, a hand coming to rest on Dean’s cheek.
Oh, my sweet Gaia, what did he deserve to withstand this torture.
He can’t go through with this.
"You wanted this, and I am
Glancing up from his phone, the map indicating that he should turn the whole car around, that’s when a flicker of light caught his eye in his rearview mirror. Turning in his seat, sure enough, there was a store with neon signs lit up stating “we’re open”.
"Eventually...we were able to slowly take over the bodies of key leaders, creating the 'Founding Fathers,'" Lucifer smirked, which turned into a couple of chuckles of laughter.
He heard the thing above hum appreciatively.
He felt his heart fluttering at the gaze, unfamiliar with the urges that sprang up when those eyes looked at him with concern.
“Fuck…” he muttered under his breath, catching Dean slowly easing up, mirth in his eyes.
Staring in wonder for a moment or two, he put the car in drive to park it in the closest spot, trotting up to the door. He stopped just before his hand reached the handle.
Eyes squinting open.
“I love books,” he said, proud that he was able to say that without cringing.
“What happened?” Meg questioned in concern, pointing towards the nasty-looking cut on Dean’s reaching hand. Pausing as he went to take a sip, changing to use his other hand, Dean glanced down at the scar of his other.
“Oh, Dean.” Meg purred. Castiel rolled his eyes, turning back to the machine to assemble and start a fresh cup. He could hear the conversation between the two, the entirety making his skin crawl.
“Sam!”
He wasn’t even a minute in!
"You damage him, you deal with the boss' consequences, Boris," remarked the fourth, their voice smooth as they held the vase to their chest.
He slowly rose to his feet, the "demons" beside him watching intently.
“Would you like me to assist you with that, your highness?” the girl inquired humorously, breaking Dean’s gaze at her body to look down at the problem in question.
Castiel's resolve was weak as he watched the smooth skin slowly reveal itself with each button.
No matter how many times he asked, Dean’s face always had a blush on his face. Dean can talk about everything under the sun, which is how he was open about his life in general but his sexual encounters make him a little more hesitant.
“I don’t understand,”
**Updated 02/16/2020**
“Somewhere in the Castle, I'd imagine.” She spoke nonchalantly, gesturing with one hand towards the place in question. “You weren’t knocked out for very long.”
Before Dean could think of how much he enjoyed the sensation of being manhandled, the stinging in his as completely distracted him.
“He was was right, you say? Do you want to marry the Duke's youngest? Do you think I don't know the secret?” He waited to hear any objections. “Dean is supposed to send me a sign with his love, and it will be our beacon. Sounds great, right?” he watched Gabriel’s hands raise up passively, showing he was listening.
Castiel could have become a doctor, a lawyer, heck, even the president with how smart he was, but he decided to stay humble, if you will, by becoming a servant to one of the richest families in the world.
It was Cas.
“I’m sorry,” was the first thing he said. “I didn’t know,”
“Nah, I want you to take a break and then we can pick up again until we get to 5th base.”
“Oh...you mean a “gaydar” ?'' Castiel said, holding his hands up to make air quotes.
It was as the man predicted, the bell dinging over the entrance. Castiel could feel the blood pumping in his ears at the situation settling at the back of his throat. He wanted to call out for the man to run but the movement beside him seized anything from happening.
“What happens after? I become your slave until you get bored of me then throw me out?” He heard the creature chuckle.
So honestly, I wrote chapter 4 first....because it needed to be written. I had part of this chapter done for a while, but I finally finished.
"Hello, Dean,"
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he argued with the disembodied voice, shifting forward, hands on either side of the tub to stand up. Water be damned as it sloshed everywhere at the abruptness. He grabbed a towel.
“Who said you can look up,” he heard Eldon murmur angrily into his ear, Castiel flinching away but a hand around his shoulder kept him from moving too far.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Whatcha need?” the oldest questioned moments later after dressing, calling out for his brother that it was all clear.
Dean peeked around the building's corner. The coast was clear on the streets, but he wasn't going to risk it. He turned around and headed for the alleyway.
Nobody laughed.
The thought running rampant, making him bolt from the bed.
He was complaining a while back about wanting to wash up so Castiel showed him where the hot springs were. Dean had looked in awe then got mad about Castiel holding out on him.
'Michael' Castiel thought, the tone more familiar as he froze so as not to draw attention to himself.
He yelped in a very manly manner when he spotted a short man walking along, muttering to himself. Dean having nearly tripped over him. When he looked up after dropping all the scrolls for his father, the man had become the same height as him.
“Dean gets the first watch, Sam you rest. And you know where I’ll be.” The boys nodded their agreements, having already been through this so many times. This had been going on well before they were alive and it’s become regrettably second nature.
Castiel did a double-take. The text didn’t show on his normal message app for the phone.
Lucifer turned around, walked up and hopped up on top of the altar. Legs swinging as leaned back on his hands.
“I didn’t say you can move,” He heard Dean’s voice scolded, no real anger, just warning.
"Let it be the way you want, just don't leave me now. I can't be without you," he trailed off, heart sinking when the creature turned away. His gaze dropped to the floor, staring down at his knees, legs dangling off the alter he was thrown on, the rejection creeping in. Was this was going to be all for nothing?
The car slowed to a stop, Dean informed his men that he got this after opening the door for himself. The two looked at each other and shrugged. As Dean approached the coffee shop he looked in to see the place filled with college students and other people looking to get their fix for a Wednesday morning.
He could hear the crowd going nuts through the cement walls. The Boo’s and Cheer’s as the spectacle going down before them. He rolled his neck and started rocking from one foot to the other.
Receiving concerned looks from everyone, he shrugged it off on his way back to his room.
The scent hit him first, closing his eyes and biting his lip to suppress the moan.
“There’s not much to tell,” he started. “Dad happened to find Mom while he was coming back from a meeting at another kingdom, she was outside tending the farm she lived on. He fell in love at first sight,” looking up to meet his brother’s gaze, a story they’ve both been told a thousand times.
"The obvious difference between your sexual experience and mine. I am always prepared." Castiel wiggled his ass before pushing it out more, giving Dean an eyeful. "No wonder all your male sexual partners left here limping,"
He pushed down any hesitance of what could go wrong, like them ganging up on him or even sicking hound dogs on him, he gripped the door handle to open it.”
While Dean was distracted, Castiel cursed himself internally for not having lube within his office. Opting for the lesser, easier substance, spit.
“I-uh- was looking something up for a game,” he said truthfully, clicking out of a chatroom for ‘Escape the Maze’.
This was Originally a Prompt that I made, and I couldn't think fo anything for a chapter story, so if anyone wants to continue it, just make sure to tag me.
The man's terrified face looked from the flames at Dean once again before closing their eyes. When they opened again, Dean nearly took a step back when the iris that were once blue were now pitch black.
“I can feel his energy, seeping under the doors and throughout the halls. He’s not aware of his actions. Memories of back then and present are now mixing. I believe it’ll be best if you stay away from him, at least until he's fully aware of who he is.” she added, noticing the dangerous look in the Alpha’s eyes.
“It’s real. I know this because I was there.”
He knew it!
“I don't love you!” He screamed louder, the villagers lining the lake murmured to one another, some gasping in surprise at the statement. Michael’s eyes narrowing at the confession.
Dean thought as the pounding on the door continued.
The man gave him a look as he pulled the rag from his shoulder to wipe the counter from where he accidentally spilled some of the liquid.
The next time he visited the cafe it was a few days later. He was flagged by his brother and a girl, who he forgot the name of already, and they sat at one of the booths.
When he turned around, he wasn’t expecting Dean to be sitting there with his head in his hand, elbows resting on his legs.
“I-uh...huh, wow,” Dean cleared his throat, sitting up straighter and fixing his shirt before reaching across the table to clasp Castiel’s in his own. “My name is Dean Winchester. I am an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and I own an auto shop.”
‘Weird’ Castiel thought as he clicked to continue looking.
He somehow woke up one day and everything was just there. Out in the open. Everyone greeted him as if it was a normal day.
Arms above his head, wrists chained together, lifting him off the ground just enough to where he barely touched the ground. His body was covered in scratches, punctures from deadman’s blood injections, and a small IV that dripped every now and then from his body.
“Fancy seeing you here,” an alluring and familiar accent brought him from his thoughts.
Dean shuddered, his ass leaning back at the loss of contact. Castiel couldn’t help but stare at it. Perfectly round, plump, definitely chiseled from the finest piece of rock known to man. What Castiel wouldn’t give to see it gleaming red from being spanked by his hand.
Stopping suddenly, his entire body acting as if it had been dunked in an ice bath, he stayed where he was. Maybe if he didn't move, they won't knock again?
Glancing back towards the table where the cards lay he turned his back to go to bed.
In the dark recess of Dean's mind, he kind of liked that. Someone taking authority over him.
“Would you..." Sam started, keeping his attention on the brothers. Castiel had just managed to tackle Gabriel who was laughing hysterically. "Would you want one?"
“Cas-I’m-” the words lost in the noises, Castiel barely hearing him over his own release. Neither one moved, both heaving as they caught their breath from the exertion.
"Let go,” the voice soothed, feeling a hand on his throat, turning it as he felt something sharp graze his neck. “You’re mine now,”
“Y-yes sir,” Dean responded shakily, the anticipation killing him as he moved his hips slightly, the need clear on his face. Castiel smiled up, one hand on Dean’s hip, the other reaching up to pull at the tie to bring the man down for a sloppy kiss.
The wind started picking up around him, he brought his arms up to shield his face from the dirt and any scattered debris flying around him.
Leaning forward, Castiel took hold of the man’s cock, sweeping his tongue from the base to the tip, eliciting a low moan. Looking up through his eyelashes, he watched Dean tilt his head back and resting on his elbows, giving Castiel’s more room.
With many years of living together, Sam knew his brother like a book. He was ready for whatever surprise that was going to come his way.
Dean grunted out, letting his head falling between his arms.
"J-just give me a moment," Dean said, a little breathless, one of his hands coming up to cover his face.
Or worse! Rubbing his cock! He was so embarrassed when he suddenly grew hard in the middle of a meeting with the royal court.
“Do those freckles cover his entire body?”
Dean didn’t hear him enter, but he remembers something smashing over his back.
He got the best education until he was pulled out at fifteen, homeschooled, and graduating the following year.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d just finished his cup, a signal that his time was up, he was about to get up when he noticed a familiar figure walking through the door.
“It’s ok,” he murmured to them, sitting on the edge of his seat to get closer. They turned their eyes on him, the fear sparking pleasure within him as he leaned closer. Watching their pupils dilate, bodies becoming lax as they fell under his hypnotic gaze.
‘It was just a dream,’ he kept telling himself over and over as he wiped his face from the sweat soaking his skin. As he evened out his breathing, his gaze wandered around the room he was in.
“What is this, Maze Runner? It’s fiction,” the only thing he could say. This had to be a joke.
Their crops were burned and homes destroyed when they refused. A young maiden was brave enough to place herself before the creature with the song she sang to lure it away.
“So we should kiss.”
“Hello, Meg.” he greeted politely, watching as she nodded her head in response before taking a long sip from her iced coffee.
"I don-"
"Awe, Doc, I thought you'd be excited that the two of us were finally alone,"
“She didn’t notice, I guess? From what I could tell she was-uh-really vocal and into it,” making ‘oh’ face, Castiel wrote that down as well.
Turning towards the source, his breath caught in his throat at the sight of Dean in the doorway. His bare chest sweaty from being outside, he was wearing soft grey sweats and he was covered in dirt.
“And you also never believed that it was Santa Clause placing presents under the tree. I know. But this year will be different because you have me.”
"Now that that's taken care of," Dean started, crossing his arms in amusement.
Through the brush, he could make out uniforms of black and purple, a banner with the same colors and a pair of glowing red eyes placed right in the middle.
“It’s okay, sweetheart.” Rubbing a hand along his back as the guards and his brother rushed in to start picking the books up.
“You had something you wanted to tell me?”
“Why do you give me such generous tips?” Dean paused in placing his wallet back into his pocket, he shrugged it off as he reclined in his seat to lean against the window, left arm across the back of the booth and his other hand grabbing for his coffee.
Doing a double-take, he took in the long brown hair and “puppy” eyes as Meg called them.
“Fuck,” Dean moaned out behind him.
When Dean came too he had heard the man in Castiel’s bedroom. So he snuck into the kitchen to grab the closest weapon, hiding until the man came back.
“Stop,” Dean forced out, dropping to his elbows, forehead resting on the bed.
“You will. Once we set up all the lights and decorations, this place will definitely get you in the mood for the season,” Dean answered, a smile on his face as he placed the box on the couch, opening it to view the contents inside.
“How are we today,” Castiel glanced up from his notebook to see Dean on the couch, lounging out in a slouched seated position, left hand draped across his leg with the left arm lying along the backrest. He moved his gaze back down at the notes from the last session. Jotting down on today’s fresh piece of paper where Dean’s scale lay.
He felt all sense of what was happening when Deans clothed crotch brushed against Cas' again and again in a thrusting motion.
"Now that we know how to get in, you're almost useless, if you weren't my brother's vessel. Now that I walk among you with this meat suit, we can move forward with bringing Hell to Earth."
Only a few patrons were here this early. Sam turned back around to lean forward, indicating for Castiel to do the same.
Of course when he heard the deep voice of Dean commanding him to cum, he didn’t need to be told twice. His body shuddering from coming so hard.
“Dean,” keeping his voice firm despite his insides being rattled by just a simple hand on his wrist.
He burst onto the illuminated streets like a bat out of hell, where he kept running until he found his way to another set of alleyways. Slumping against the nearest wall, he keeled over in exhaustion.
“Well, I hope you feel better,” Dean started after a few beats of silence, standing up straight. He placed the cup on the table, his palm of his hand lying flat along the surface. Castiel stared at those hands, slowly trailing them up the arm. To the shoulder before locking eyes with the man.
“So...shall we start?” Indicating to the empty spot he was expecting Dean to be occupying. Making an ‘oh’ face, Dean made his way to the loveseat, taking a moment to compose himself before dropping his pants. Cas didn’t even give him a second look as he was squirting lube on his two-fingers. He did look up expectantly as he rubbed the liquid between his fingers to warm up the lube.
If Dean wasn’t back by six, Sam was to assume he had failed. Sam had gotten all teary-eyed, arguing that he’ll be back and that Dean was being ridiculous. Of course, Dean’s rebuttal that he may be Batman, but even he was Human and can’t fight all the bad guys at once.
His heart sailed as he watched the man decide, undoing the belt on his pants with one hand and pushing them down. Stepping out so he can turn to face Cas, a small smile on his face as he leaned down to capture Cas’ lips in a brief kiss.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your company,” Castiel tried, biting back the queasiness in his stomach.
They were off in a matter of seconds, their leader pleased with his decision to come down for that bit of news.
“Castiel,” the voice catching the man off guard. He blinked up to find his brother Michael glaring at him.
“I don’t see how you did,”
The man walked out from the shadows, Dean grimacing at the sex dungeon attire, the guy brought his nine tail whip up, using the other hand to run through the leather tails.
"It's ok, I'm just surprised that you managed to have a waitlist of two months. I've only had that happen a handful of times for me,"
Dean inched them both backward until Castiel's knees hit the bed, taking that opportunity to turn the man around, dropping to his knees.
Standing on the other side amongst his men, Michael stood proudly, a big smile on his face.
The only reason Castiel helped jerk Dean off was that Dean had asked him and it was part of his job to help ease the process.
“Oh, you know. When you have nothing to say or to give us, we just make you disappear. That old chestnut.” He reached for the scalpel, a little slice and dice would get better answers when you decided to peel the skin away from the muscle.
Dean left more confused than before.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But Bobby- “
“Great, did you get the pie?” Dean asked as he tried to get a peek inside the bags for that sweet and delicious dessert.
They remained quiet.
“Clarence, over here,” a familiar voice called out, followed by multiple “shh’s” across the room.
Looking up, past the ground of people, came a dark silhouette from the sky. It’s massive wingspan beating as it came closer.
Bold Italic's is singing
Dean turned them, keeping himself still sheathed in Castiel’s warm heat, before pushing against the nearest piece of furniture.
Not a minute later Dean joined him, he was straightening out his pants and tie just as the church bells rang.
Afterward, the lands began to prosper. And so began the tradition of sacrificing people of the village every couple of years.
“S-Soldier, Sir.”
Through a groan, he managed to get out “Such a good boy, Dean”
“Dean.”
Dean ran a hand over his face, holding in a groan as he listened to Cas read through his speech. He just finished with the first verse of it and was working his way through the examples.
“Good thing we’re just decorating,” Dean’s voice called from the kitchen, followed by the sound of doors opening and closing. The clattering of something here or there.
‘Left’
Cas stared transfixed at the man above, his heart thumping in his chest at the fact that Dean still wanted him,
The boat rocked aggressively, the two men were thrown to the ground, Michael roaring with anger when the boat finally steadied itself.
Castiel was so lost in the feeling that he didn’t feel Dean’s hand on his neck move up until he felt the swipe of his thumb along Castiel’s bottom lip. A crazy thought appeared, blocking every warning bell ringing in his head as he decided to take that thumb into his mouth.
Nothing.
When Dean was done, placing his pants on the seat opposite of them, Cas leaned forward to place his free hand on Dean’s hip, guiding him to sit on his lap. Obediently the green-eyed man did as he was told, his legs on either side of Cas’ hovering over the man’s length, letting out a small whimper when he felt Cas’ cock rub along the cleft of his ass.
After the guy keeled over in pain, Dean exited quickly.
When he opened his eyes again, he saw the man next to his bed, kneeling down making eye contact with him.
It’s true, Dean thought to himself while his mother guided him out of the library. She waved him goodbye before walking back in.
Leaning back in his seat, he anxiously rubbed at his face while letting the yellow highlighter fall between the book. Why was this bothering him so much!
Not to mention the moans he could hear from behind the door. All he wanted to do is burst in and hold the man. Screw the witch!
When Dean looked over his shoulder to see the expectant look from Cas, he internally groaned. He started this slippery (no pun intended with lube still in his ass) slope, might as well fall all the way down.
and that tongue of his, divine!"
As gross as it is, Dean didn't mind the excess spit that comes with a rough face fuck.
He whimpered when Dean pulled away, only to find the man’s thumb before him. He took the digit into his mouth, moaning as he sucked it down. He looked up to the man as he stared down, lust blown eyes, mouth parted as he watched Castiel.
Two fingers and slowly adding the third.
“Go to the man,” she spoke suddenly, catching him off guard. “You have 2 hours left. Kevin comes in an hour, I can handle myself until then,”
If she knew who he was, she didn’t show it with her tray held against her body with both hands as she smiled at his group.
His mind wandering around his thoughts until he came to a particular day. A couple of weeks ago to be exact.
He was also secretly grateful that he hadn’t spotted that weird energy crackling around his brother’s head like he’s seen before. Nor any of the delusions from the days prior. Like everything had gone back to his standard of normal. He was probably lacking in sleep, the illusions were just a sign of his need to sleep longer.
“Fuck!” He cursed out, hands on the armrest with his head laying on the cushion, ass sticking out in the air for another smack.
He had half a mind to block the number, ignore the message since he figured it was a prank or a wrong number.
“So beautiful,” he heard Cas utter under his breath, hearing the squirt of the lube bottle. Glancing over his shoulder, Dean groaned at the sight of Cas’ applying a generous amount of lube to his thick cock.
She could have sworn this morning he looked normal, but that's not what she had been paying attention to at the time. Her focus was on this man's love life. She could smell it on him.
Fuck it.
Walking around the counter, Eldon quickly wrapped his arm around Castiel’s shoulder. Using that to guide the smaller man around tables and a single row of booths along the furthest wall to stop at the last one. Eldon’s arm fell away, using his other hand to indicate for Castiel to sit.
Blondie and the woman stared in horror, Dean raising a brow in question when nothing happened.
“Give it a day or two,” she started, ignoring the groan from the Alpha. “His body is fine. All those years training in the kingdom. But the mind is fragile. Being bound and sealed within off since the curse, with no accidental slips. Forcing him to come out too soon could leave significant damage to his psyche,”
“Didn’t hear that,”
“Uh, Ma’am. My friend, he is just coming down from the adrenaline rush and from something being smashed over his back. He may also have a concussion from hitting his head on something after falling from being attacked. He was also scared that this man could have killed him,” Castiel defended, maintaining eye contact with the cop, a hand on Dean’s shoulder to emphasize the point.
One night he had brought one of his latest conquests, a supermodel, home from some big charity event.
“De-”
Dean backed up when Castiel took a step forward out of fear, his eyes turning a deeper shade of red.
“Sir?” tilting his head towards the source, he squinted at the lower rank demon that was disturbing his time. The man stood tall, looking off into the distance so as not to make eye contact with his boss. “The raiding party has returned,”
He wanted to close his eyes, another act of defiance that he could add to his list. He also did not want to witness the black that filled what were the greenest eyes he’d ever seen. Knowing he’d let this happen. Knowing...that he was supposed to kill this man before any of this was supposed to happen.
Choosing the next item, he lathered it extensively. This is as big as anyone could get so it should be good.
Walking in, he noticed a woman with shoulder-length black curls, black blouse and creamy white skin standing behind a white marble desk with gold trim.
They drove for another half an hour, Castiel was truly confused as to where they were going after Dean took another left.
He didn’t say anything, the angry look he was giving her saying it all. She raised her brow in response.
“Just water. I ate last night though,”
He was about to call for his attention again but was silenced by the sudden scraping of a chair against the tile.
His response was Dean lifting his arm to wave at him.
“It’s ok, Dean,” Sam called out, a small smile on his face. “We got this covered. Why don’t you go take a nap or something? You got some heavy bags forming,”
Cursing to himself, he continued on his path to the woods. The only place to hide in the vast landscape. Keeping his eyes open for anything that could give any clue as to where the burglars have gotten to.
Even though he said that for all of them.
Luckily it had cooled enough to where it didn’t burn him but the wasted coffee! He could hear the woes of the spirits crying out at the spill.
‘So Sammy’s secret love was Gabriel,’ Dean realized, seeing his brother smile back at the helmsman.
“I’m feeling awesome,” He watched Dean look over his shoulder to wink at him. Castiel rolled his eyes at the comment. “Fine,” in an exaggerated voice. “Everything is good, but I’d feel comfortable going slow today.”
‘A Vampire?’ Dean thought.
He felt the heat on his back as the Dragon attempted to catch him which spurred him to climb in the direction of the hole across from him.
In all his time with people talking about their sexual fantasies, he’s been able to keep himself relatively neutral during those times.
the creature thing started, hearing it tut as its hand moved back down and across his chest. Opening his eyes, all Dean could see from his point of view was a shadowed hand. The darkness surrounding them, keeping Dean from seeing anything else in the room.
He turned his head.
“It’s a Maze,” He finally said, after Sam kept guessing. Prison, Zombie, Apocalypse, even Call of Duty.
Dean’s vision was plunged back into a familiar pink.
“I-I-” was all Dean could get out, his muscles tightening as he came. Untouched.
Followed by Dean shifting forward to stand between Castiel’s legs to deepen the kiss at the same time Castiel wrapped his arms around his neck.
"How about you take my card and meet me tomorrow, keep me company for the night." Dean felt the man press something into the pocket of his apron before standing and walking out.
“Y-yes, sir,” not sure where the ‘sir’ came from, but grateful when he felt the tip pressing just past the ring of muscle.
It was pitch black, the hairs on the back of his neck raising when the thought of Hatchet Man. Appearing out of nowhere saying his famous catchphrase:
And Castiel did. Slowly pulling the plug out and pushing it back in. Dean’s head lifted, followed by the rest of his torso so that he was on all fours.
“If he was killed by fire, that means some kind of Sorcerer did this!” someone shouted, urging the people to cry out in anger at the audacity.
an ominous voice called out.
Castiel couldn’t control himself when he looked up, wincing in pain when he felt a slap to the back of his head.
“You’re welcome,” Dean replied.
He stood slower than intended.
“Good, I’m gonna go clean up,”
Overall, Dean didn’t want to do anything except lay in bed all day. He could do some training inside with some of the men in the royal court but that would require pants.
The words "Purge" carved into her stomach.
No other words were exchanged as Dean began his bruising pace.
A quiet city with beautiful scenery surrounding it. Buildings nestled in between like they were in their own little world. The leaves were just starting to change from Summer to Fall, changing from green to the array of reds, yellows, and oranges.
Dean grit his teeth hard enough to feel them chip as white-hot pain began spreading through his body. Eyes closed tight, body giving way from the shock, his back hitting the wall so now he was sitting flat on his ass with his legs on either side of the body before him. Castiel had kept a firm grip on Dean’s wounded shoulder while his other hand gripped Dean’s bicep to keep him in place, the new position not hindering him at all. In fact, all he did was move closer, each knee under Dean’s thighs, almost pinning him into this awkward position. A whole head taller, Castiel brought himself lower and maneuvered himself to speak into Dean’s ear.
"Please?" Castiel asked, a little breathless from the playful look the man was giving him.
He was the last to stand, putting on a charming smile when he walked up the girl. Her cheeks had a tint of red as he leaned in close.
Taking his seat, Castiel shifted inside the booth so that he was closer to the wall. Eldon plopped himself next to him, having no trouble closing the gap between them, resting an arm along with the backrest and across Castiel’s shoulders once again.
Hello Everyone! I'm really sorry that this chapter took so long! I'm extremely grateful to those who have stuck around, commented, and left a kudo ^^;
A small smile on Cas’ face at the memory. They were both invited to a 4th of July cookout at the Winchesters family abode. It was also the first time Castiel was being introduced to the family. Thankfully, everyone was so accepting and ended up loving him. Once the fireworks went off across the lake, Castiel was entranced.
"Fix it!" he nearly shouted, slamming his hand on the armrest, silencing the witch before she could continue. “I’ve waited,” his voice was shaky. “Stuck in that prison.
He tapped it which caused a window to pop up.
"I-I was kidnapped a couple of days before the Purge. Someone I knew betrayed me, they grabbed me in my sleep…" he trailed off, glancing up to meet Dean's eyes, "When I woke up, I was on the floor of a church. No one around."
“It’s not like that,” Castiel mumbled just loud enough for Dean to hear, turning and plopping into the seat across from the other man. “Besides, it's none of your business.” He repeated, lifting his hands to adjust his sweatshirt higher and closer to his neck.
She had the most devilish look on her face as she waved her wand, Castiel watching the stain lift and disappear in the air.
A thought struck him, where in the hell was he? He wasn’t a prisoner, based on the lack of chains and bare walls.
…Right?
Dean held up a hand, waving it to one side as a gesture to dismiss the subject.
Leaning forward from his spot, he found two figures standing at the entrance, huddled close as they continued to speak.
A couple of thrusts from that finger and few deeps breaths later, Dean was able to answer.
“Did you want one?” he offered while holding out the box. Dean smiled and shook his head. He pushed back on the metal headboard, stretching backward, his ass on full display for him. Castiel had gotten lost in looking at the cum slowly leaking from the man’s hole that when Dean had moved to get off the bed, it snapped him back to reality.
“Now!”
“You go this,”
The beating of wings pulled him from his thoughts, the sound getting closer and closer. The gusts of wind getting stronger and stronger.
he thought, shaking his head when he thought he saw a naked girl within the small sphere of light.
Today is a beautiful day.
He noticed it not too long after he started seeing things.
As much as Castiel would have loved to have taken this slow and easy like usual, the reason he came here...time was not on his side. He started his bruising pace, surprising the man based on his gasp as he continued. Enjoying the mixture of gasps and moans he earned from hitting at just the right angle. One hand on Dean’s hip and the other on his shoulder, he dug deep for the energy to thrust while closing his eyes to focus on that tight hole.
Dean smiled around the mouthpiece, Sam wishing him luck before leaving to find his seat, just before the door opened to lead him and his corner team to the ring.
The Dragon roared just before descending, aiming straight for a narrow hole on the side of the bones. Dean clutching for dear life at the increasing speed, the sunlight now gone the farther they went.
“Castiel.” The boy supplied a small smile on his lips.
This peaceful moment didn’t sit right with him. His left hand  that rested on his thigh, under the table, twitched at the thought.
"Well, You're gonna get it tonight, Big Boy," the man commented, swinging the whip around. "What's your safe word?"
Dean shook his head at the comment. Everything was supposed to be running smoothly, but there were people resisting his leadership. That comment had Bobby smacking him across the back of the head.
“Home,” a voice answered, Dean, jumping at the unexpected answer. He turned, gripping with his free hand the bottom of the current to cover himself.
Gripping the sheets as Dean continued to toy with him, changing speeds from fast to an agonizingly slow speed that made him whine in the back of his throat, his body pushing back to meet the thrusts faster. He received a smack to his cheek in retaliation.
“Kill him,” Castiel whispered gently into his ear.
Leaning up to brush their lips together, reaching down, Dean aligned himself with the puckering hole before pressing in with just the tip. They both hissed in pleasure as Dean slowly started to rock his hips, pushing farther and farther inside.
“P-please,”
Castiel still giving him the look.
“Then come get me,” and with that Castiel made a beeline for the door while hearing Dean’s shouts of protest.
They lay there in silence, Castiel eventually removing the blanket from over his head to stare back at the man.
Running a hand along the length, eliciting a breathy moan from the man into the kiss, his hands reaching up to grasp Dean’s shoulders. Hanging on for dear life when the hand moved faster.
“Out of the pants,” Cas commanded, pulling his fingers free to let Dean pull his dress pants off, taking the shoes off as well since they were in his way. In the meantime, Cas stroked himself at the display.
"I only ask because I don't recognize your banner, therefore I can't place where you hail from,"
Dogs barking.
He shoved the man onto the altar, keeping his grip, using his body to hold the man in place, the angel blade poised above him.
He groaned at how satisfied he felt, wanting to pull the blankets over himself and fall into a deep slumber when the sound of clothes rustling alerted him to the Dean’s movement.
“Do you want your usual?” He asked, getting right to the point as he started unbuttoning his own shirt.
He managed to get one couples meters to reach max, watching as they quickly ran out the door.
Arm and arm the two walked along the cars to the entrance where families were waiting to be let in.
CLAM?
"You're used to being feared," Dean started calmly. "You don't know what it's like to be loved. A man or a dragon - I love you for who you are," his heart wanting to burst out of his chest when the Dragon inclined its head as if letting him know he was listening.
“Cas?” a shot in the dark, the name causing the figure to curl up tighter into a ball. “Cas is that you?” Dean asked again, his voice barely above a whisper. His body moving on its own to get closer to prove that he’s just out of his mind and this person was not the man who disappeared after their first kiss.
Despite the outcome was pleasant, to say the least, but the problem lies with what was causing the issue.
"Couch," if Cas cared, either way, he didn't show it as he turned in the direction of the loveseat.
Dean just closed his eyes, dropping his head back onto the comfy stretcher, groaning at the realization that he lost.
"It's no use," the deep-sounding voice called out, halting Castiel in his attempt to escape. He knew this one. This was the one he was most terrified of. A chuckle brought his attention back.
“Hey Castiel,” a familiar voice greeted him right as he walked in.
He figured there was no one going to call him since his family knew where he was and could easily contact Hannah or Meg if it’s an emergency. He held the power button until the network logo flashed before going blank.
Castiel wasn't upset. He really can't be. At the time he had wished it was him during those moments. Instead, he had to stand outside the door, per Dean’s commands, and battle a raging hard-on every time.
“Michael, don't!” he vaguely heard over the wings.
The color on his cheeks when he caught Dean staring at him in return.
Off in the distance, catching his eye, a faint glow of a fire signaled life, spurring Dean to dismount. Shushing the horse as he tied her to the tree, rubbing at her neck again before he stealthily made his way in the direction.
"Yes,"
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice pulled Dean from his observations. He noticed John’s head lift suddenly, wincing in pain, but surprise clear in his face at his name.
A chuckle floated through the air, cutting through the sound of rain and the creaking of wood as it became ash. Snapping his head up, he caught sight of a dark figure within the flames, a stark contrast from the orange and yellows of the fire that roared around them.
“I-I..fuck,” Dean panted, feeling other icy touches on his nipples, pinching them as another cold spot lapped at his neck, like a tongue, with sharp pricks every now and then that felt like teeth.
Castiel shuddered as Dean continued his assault on Cas’ neck.
It had been pouring rain this entire week, which benefited the employees at the coffee shop. The days prior had been busy and quite frankly, they needed a break.
Turning his head slightly, squinting his eyes as he absorbed the information he was given.
Castiel contemplated, keeping his head low, fists clenching before reluctantly nodding his head in agreement. They shook hands briefly before Castiel walked around the man and through the door behind him.
Castiel noticed a slight crack in the man’s voice, curious as to what he was thinking about at that moment.
“Quiet, all of you!” Gabriel demanded, silencing the soldiers at once while making his way to stand beside the man.
“On your back,” Dean commanded softly, “Head off the bed,” And Cas did as he was told, rolling onto his back, looking up at the man as he towered over him. The man’s stature towering over him, his dominating appearance causing his own need to stand at full attention.
"Nope, nope!"  Taking off faster than he’s ever done before, the back of his mind wishing he could have taken the impala.
He quickly tucked his gun into the waistband of his jeans, having had it in a death grip the entire dead sprint.
The man stood at Dean entering the room, walking around the desk to greet him.
The elevator dinged before opening and leading him into a long hallway. The room he was looking for was at the end.
The creature’s hands began to get warmer and warmer.
“There’s no such thing as magic,” he mumbled out after wrapping the towel around his lower half while running a hand through his wet hair.
Hands freezing in place as the man before him slowly dropped to his elbows, Castiel could see the man’s torso expanding and collapsing as Dean tried to regain his breathing.
He didn’t say a word, not even collecting his clothes as he walked out.
"Mage," blondie muttered in warning.
"But this body," gesturing to himself. "Found what we were looking for. My perfect vessel."
This time he clicked ‘Yes’.
Nothing.
After Dean thanked her, after recovering from his shock, she walked away. He mentally tallied just how much coffee he bought from here.
The half dragged half walked Dean back down the aisle to the man standing there. The people dropped, causing him to fall on his hands and knees.
He took a deep breath of the night air, his men stood before him with his carriage at the ready, his right hand walking up to let him know they are ready to leave when he is.
"Who is he?"
“Impala,”
“Have you seen him naked?”
"He’s now in stable condition...but we...have a situation."
“Don’t be blaming my little brother,” Eldon interrupted his corner lip lifting. Swallowing the gasp when he felt the man's hand lightly grazing his cheek, moving lower to grab at his throat, Eldon’s face inches away from his face as he whispered harshly into Castiel’s ear. “Enough.”
"Great. That means we have to keep him." Dean said, an air of finality to his words. Sam and Bobby looked at each other, nodding in agreement.
“Dean?”
“Ah-” Castiel gasped out, feeling the slight pinch to his nipple before smoothing over his chest. Feeling lips to his neck as the hands traveled farther south, his heart beating rapidly at the attention. When his hands found Castiel’s fully erect need, he nearly came at the firm grip.
A flurry of butterflies in his stomach as they made the deserted, rugged, island into a cozy getaway.
It’s been six days since then.
“Dean, don't!” Castiel watched in horror as he watched Dean's foot slip-off the side sending the man falling over the edge.
When his mother placed her hand on top of his during dinner one night, he nearly pulled his hand away at the feel of some kind of energy vibrating above his.
“No, this is exactly what I needed.” He took a tentative sip, enjoying the smooth bitter taste and how the temperature was perfect to sip. Reaching in his jacket pocket, he pulled out his wallet, intending to pay until Anna held up both hands.
“If you want to call it that. But anyway, as I was saying, you broke up with the guy. He was…” he puckered his lips in thought. “Neglectful? If that’s the word I’m looking for. He didn’t appreciate you or the things you did for him. But the second you don’t do it, he blows up?” raising a brow with that freaking smirk because Castiel couldn’t believe that he was spot on. “Probably bland sex too. Get in and get out the situation, very vanilla,”
Grabbing the doorknob, Castiel turned back with a smile on his face.
“Want me to wait with you?”
"I bet you're other partners couldn't have taken that so easily," Castiel mocked, looking over his shoulder with a smirk. He hissed in pain from the smack on his ass.
“Cas?”
Castiel did not fit in with Mr. Winchester’s criteria.
Rubbing a hand over his face, keeping his hand over his lips as he stared down at his coffee cup. He has no clue what to do.
"By proxy, you are 'getting laid'," Cas countered.
“You were enjoying it,” Dean whined as he watched Castiel move away and off the bed.
He was talking about Dean.
After waiting months for this to finally happen, he was not going to let it slip away.
But Castiel gave him a firm look in response.
Dismissing the new nickname, he gave her a small shrug in response while dropping his gaze to anywhere but her.
“If it’s anything, I was more concerned you were gonna hurt yourself. On another note,” he started before Dean could say anything. “I’d like to fix my misconception in my own ways,” Dean gave him a weird look, quickly changing to mischievous when Cas began to lead him to the bedroom.
“Nonsense,” Crowley interrupted before Castiel could turn away. “We should have that in supply here within,” the man pulled out his pocket watch, checking it before answering. “A few minutes. We can bring it back when it's ready if you want it in your private room,”
He stumbled in his step, lost in his thoughts, the realization of where he was going becoming clearer as he passed the familiar family portrait. The statue of a knight he accidentally knocked over as a kid, the one with a piece of the stone missing from the helmet, was right next to the throne room.
"Have you ever wondered why, on an island where so many people had perished, there isn't a single skeleton or even a bone?"
As he stood there, the dried coffee making itself known on his once-white shirt, now stained brown, the smell more potent than when it was in the cup.
He doesn’t think he’s ever gotten home so fast as he jumped off his bike, not caring that he left in the middle of his yard. He unlocked the door without his keys and entered his home.
“Take the next left,” Dean panted out.
The sound of the door opening, the chime signaling a newcomer, Castiel looked and felt himself deflate just slightly when it wasn’t who he was expecting.
He was still paralyzed.
A newbie.
“You said it was a survival game, did you win?”
The couple before him drone on and on, complaining about the nonsense they’ve covered multiple times within prior sessions.
“H-how?” Castiel could feel his face turning red at the declaration.
“Hang on,” Dean whispered into Cas’ neck, the only thing grabbing the man’s attention was when Dean’s hips stopped thrusting. Abruptly grabbing hold around Dean’s neck as he lifted Castiel off the bed.
"Is there anything I can get you, a new coffee or maybe one of the pastries..." rambling off everything he could do to make the man forgive him as he got down on his hands and knees to clean up the spill. "I noticed you were drinking tea, we have a huge s-" he was silenced when he felt a finger under his chin, guiding him to look up.
With his left hand on the man's head, to keep him occupied while his right searched for that puckering hole.
Castiel couldn't wipe the smile off his face as he wandered down the hall, hand tracing along the wall. Not caring that his pants are open for the world to see. Or staff.
He-lucifer-he was in the bunker. He could have escaped at any time. But it was a setup. To have Sam chase after Castiel. But Dean came instead. Which would be placing Sam in danger.
“Why is it ‘good-ish’,” Castiel asked while standing from his desk chair to walk across the room to sit in his seat in front of Dean.
Dean's read all kinds of stories that have happened. With easy access to the internet, you can see the deeds being done across the state. Amazed and sickened by how creative these people could get and how far they’ve come since the beginning.
“Up,” Castiel's hands going straight for Dean’s belt and zipper. Shoving the pants and underwear down right as Dean hopped up to sit on the edge.
He got a grumble in response. Another low chuckle followed by the shifting of said chuckler.
The sounds around him faded, his mind drifting into the darkness surrounding him.
“I’m afraid we will be closing soon,” she announced, surprised at the maiden for now blushing when the man gave her an easy smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve been neglecting those duties,” His voice stern, crossing his arms over his chest. His eyes show worry despite what he was saying.
“There’s nothing to be worried about. I’m just going to go for a walk.” He opened the door and walked out just as he heard Sam call out.
“If you were you’d shut up,” Dean’s face heating up, embarrassed about the whole thing already.
He groaned at the pounding headache, squinting in pain, wanting to bring his hand up to rub the ache away but his arm was too weak to move.
Dean breathed into the kiss, bringing both hands to cup Castiel’s face to deepen the kiss.
Accepting the proffered napkins, dabbing at the spill. Meg looked on, commenting how he could just clean himself up with magic.
The thought was tempting but he decided that the sooner he left, the better.
"Only the dragon needs you here!" Pulling his arm out of Dean's reach before the man could do anything. "Go away!"
Castiel didn't know if he should feel pleased or disappointed that what he was looking for was not on the menu.
Embarrassed because he wasn't able to hold back, cumming quicker than when he was first discovering his body.
He turned to Juac, launching himself shoulder-first into the man's crotch. He quickly got to his feet so he could bring his foot down for a solid heal to the man's crotch again.
As the sun rose higher, the streams of light found its way onto the bed and into the eyes of one of them. They moved their head away, groaning, before curling tighter into the body before them.
He was rewarded with a hiss in response.
No words were needed to be said as Dean unfolded the arm closest to Cas.
Dean watched and felt Cas place a hand on his hip as he guided his cock to Dean's hole. Gripping the armrest, the feeling of his cock was much bigger than the plug.
The note of sadness at the end caused Dean to look over his shoulder at the man who happened to look up from what he was doing. Their eyes locked. Such an intense gaze.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anna.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t understand.” Not even sure what he was talking about.
“Yes,” he said reluctantly, the words muffled by the pillow but Castiel heard it either way. Nodding his head at the breakthrough, he continued.
After taking off the ridiculous trench coat and suit jacket, he watched Castiel roll up his sleeves, which makes any man 5,000% hotter.
He punched the man in the Dick.
Michael looked down at the rope in his hand, anger clear on his face before ordering his helmsman to help him pull. They didn’t get very far as Dean moved forward to yank the rope off the boat, causing Michael to fall backwards from the force he’d been using to pull.
That's the third time in a month the guy has been unavailable. The girl on the line had told him that Castiel had gone on vacation for two of those weeks while taking personal time off. After coming back, his schedule became booked real quick.
"H-hey!" Dean called out, trying to pull his arm free.
“You were right, Sam”
“I don’t know,” Dean glanced over his shoulder at Castiel. “Girth probably.”
"I'm not surprised. You of all people would have a long clientele list," a compliment that went straight to Dean's heart. "Who's the special client today?"
“Please,” it came out softer then Dean intended, his hand reaching out for the man’s wrist to stop him from whatever he was going to do, while his other hand, with a slight tremble, placed itself on the man’s crotch. A jolt of satisfaction spread throughout Dean when he could feel the slightly hardening dick beneath the cloth.
Dean turned his attention to the last two standing calmly as if their comrades weren't bemoaning on the forest floor in pain. Blondie finally pulled his hood off, a glare at his hair flowed free from the confines. His pale skin made his blue eyes pop.
Castiel shook his head in response, lifting the mop into the bucket to wring it out with the handle. Their conversations aren’t long, minimal at most, nothing to brag or compensate with money for.
"...wish you'd let me know sooner. But uh-Cas, are you going to untie me?” Dean asked, tugging at his restraints.
He heard Lucifer call out to him, taunting him to come out to play. Dean's adrenaline was pumping, he looking around, discovering a silver blade. One he's never seen before.
“Castiel,” words like silk, familiar. A shudder through his body when the memories of his name being whispered into his ear in that same tone. Deep, full of lust as they lay together in the throws of passion.
He watched his brother shrug his shoulders as he flipped to another page.
Art has been done by the AMAZING  The Friendly Pigeon!!! ^^ I love her artwork, so freaking amazing :D :D
"And that’s when I blurted out, "I love you"." Castiel finished, eyes bright, fond at the memory.
"Lucifer?"
Cas nodded, not truly understanding.
That's when she slowly lifted her arm until her hand point straight at him.
After that, someone had given him information on people that can help him prep for stuff like this. It was weird at first, but in the long run, it helped out a lot.
“Yes! I like the guy,”
“Says the people who kept everything a secret from me,” he retorted, his senses tingling at the back of his mind while his eyes searched methodically for a shadow or a glimpse of his brother.
Castiel’s own having hit his chest and bed sheets. He shuddered when he felt Dean slide out, already missing the feeling of being full.
Did he scare Dean off?
“Working a minimum wage job while going through college, I figured a generous tip would help.” Castiel went to speak, coming up short with a remark at the mention of him being in school. “I came in a while back, saw you studying.” Dean pointed out before taking a sip of his drink.
The kind that when he wakes up in the morning, he either has a mess to clean or a problem to take care of.
The loud cracking sound of bones was clearly heard over the wind, permanently silencing the men, Dean’s stomach dropping as he watched the men burst into a pool of blood.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Dean demanded, confused by her statement. She smiled, from across the fire, he was able to make out the sharp canines.
“Good night, Dean,” he said back before leaving. Dean laid back down, the quiet never bothering him before, but the images of the beast still fresh as he tried to sleep. He vaguely remembers hearing the flute from Castiel’s room playing, it was soothing enough to finally allow Dean to drift off into slumber.
of metal had him ducking, the rope falling from him in the process. Looking up he noticed a blade sticking out of the tree. Turning his attention in the direction it came from, he had to move out of the way of the man across the fire as he launched another one.
He blacked out, he thinks for a few seconds, possibly even minutes, groaning in pain, trying to catch his breath.
John Winchester is...was a controlling asshole. He didn’t care what Sammy did, even though becoming a lawyer was the last thing any of them expected. But Dean, he was expected to take over the family business. Head of the Winchester Mafia.
“I had a bad dream,” Dean murmured out when he was able to regain himself.
There was that unspoken question of ‘Why’ left hanging in the air, Castiel clenching his jaw as he looked from his watch to his lap, back to his cup, and repeat.
Dean can tell he was irritated. Tense shoulders, slight crease in his brow and set jawline despite the fake smile that could fool anyone but Dean. He knows not to speak right now as Cas gazes almost lovingly down at the revolver in his hand, Dean’s heart rate skyrockets while fighting to control his breathing. He must not show weakness.
Dean’s eyes widened at the information, wiping his hand along his pant leg. He was trying to figure out what to say, Castiel thought to himself.
Before Castiel made his way to the familiar chocolate loveseat, he heard a low cough, stopping him in his tracks.
Taking a deep breath, he stopped Dean from continuing by placing a hand under his chin, guiding him to stand so Castiel could kiss him. Slow and passionate as his other hand traveled to Dean's hip, slipping it under the loose pants to grab a handful of the tight ass beneath, causing Dean to gasp into the kiss, body moving flush against Castiel's. He kneaded the flesh, taking in the moans it earned him as he began moving them closer to the bed. He took pleasure in Dean jumping slightly when Castiel had moved his other hand to find his hole.
Dean nodded towards Alicia, the girl from earlier as he dragged Cas down the hallway, stopping at the third door on the left, opening it and pushing Cas into the room.
Glancing down at his own after taking a sip, he noticed he needed a new one. Raising a hand to catch the man's attention.
"He said he was kidnapped a couple of days ago, woke up in a church, escaped. Now he's here."
"Are you sure?"
"The purge doesn't have to be about killing, you know,"
“Ok,” he said, almost reluctantly, with a small smile. But Sam wasn’t, Dean knew that. He could read his little brother like a book. The brooding pensive shoulders were his give away, that and the bitchface he liked to use on Dean when he did or said something stupid.
The roar from the villagers rose in volume at the beginning of the ceremony, just like before.
"Why"? Don't you understand?”
Castiel felt his heart flutter at the gift once the paper was removed. It was a simple wooden frame with a picture of him and Dean on the 4th of July. Dean hugging Castiel right as the camera went off. Castiel was giving Dean a weird look while Dean had a big smile on his face.|
"Still, it's overly generous." Castiel tried, even going as far to take a step back, his tray held to block Dean from placing it in his apron.
“How long have you worn those?” Dean questioned, leaning back into his previous position, his eyes lifting to almost meet Castiels’, stopping just short of making eye contact. Castiel didn’t respond. “I know you have a boyfriend, but did he give you those hickeys as well as that limp?”
“Than please elaborate for me,” turning his head to the noise as much as possible. The corner of his eyes caught a glimpse of a naked body curled against the wall.
A corner of Dean’s lips lifted, shrugging his shoulders.
Dean whimpered when the hand suddenly disappeared, those same hands holding his hips as he attempted to gain some kind of friction.
Dean stared, trying to wrap his head around what the man just said. If what he said...this isn't real. There's no such thing. Dean's not a religious man, but there's always a possibility with proof. But this is just downright impossible.
“We have the Bee's Knees, Hanky Panky, Scofflaw, Mary Pickford, and Gin Rickey,”
No foreplay, no nothing.
You bet your sweet ass he did.
Nodding his head in understanding, Castiel popped the lube cap open and pouring some onto his gloved finger. He rubbed it between his thumb and two fingers to warm it up before placing it at the entrance of the awaiting hole before him.
Dean bit his lip as he watched his brother leave, wondering what it was she needed from Sam and not him. He watched the two leave, Dean was glad that he no longer needed supervision. It had been weeks until his Father finally relented. He’s been relatively well-behaved, hasn’t done anything stupid in the last...hour.
"You had a plan…' I'll teach you to live like a human.' To get a hold of materials and maps, to learn to send signals to the ships. There was only one thing left…' Will you teach me to see the wind? To overcome the curse of the island preventing you from sailing away."
"Not tonight," he mumbled. "You're more than welcome to go by yourself but I have a meeting to attend to." She pouted and Dean thanked whoever lived above when Sam arrived.
“Do you have any preferences?” Castiel asked from the kitchen, standing in front of his self-titled  “booze cabinet.”
The man’s breathing became ragged, whimpering from the assault, as he got up on his hands so that he was on all fours, again, so that he could start pushing back into the toy and forward into Castiel’s hand.
The cries of the dragon echoed as he tried to escape its prison, thrashing, and growling as it tried to reach for Dean.
He clicked ‘yes’ when prompted to heal, even clicking for them to have food.
Sam shook his head.
His head shot up when he felt a warm feeling under his chin, looking up and seeing nothing, he felt a small tug, unlike the others that were gripping him, this was gentle. The warmth spread throughout his body as he stood, turning in his spot until he was looking at a shadowy corridor.
Settling on his left shoulder. He felt a small tug from it, pulling him. He dug his heal after taking a step forward. The tingling sensations stopped, replaced by another on his right hand. He watched as it lifted, pulling him to his left.
Dean closed his eyes, willing this all to go away.
“And it’s none of your business,” he added, leaning forward, his eyes glowing as he disregarded her.
“I was, but I can’t be walking into work tomorrow with a limp.”
“Please,” Dean begged breathlessly into the kiss, his body pushing instinctually onto Castiel's finger.
“F-fuck,” Dean moan out, as Cas started to slowly rock himself, inching deeper with each thrust. Only when he felt that Cas’ was fully sheathed, the feeling of the man's sharp hip bones against his bruised ass and the deep groaning sound did Dean let himself breath.
“D-Dean,” Castiel tried again with a shuddering breath when his hands went for his belt. “I-we can’t do this,”
“Well, you’re free to leave. Same time next week?” he called out over his shoulder as he walked to his desk to put his notes away.
Limbs shaking as the man continued his slow rhythm once again, feeling a hand grasping his weeping cock at the base in a firm grip.
The ambiance of the rain and fire muffling any other noise, including the sound of shoes stopping just at his knees, briefly catching a glimpse of that tanned skin, feeling a finger under his chin, lifting his head.
‘Where the hell am I,’ he gasped at the sight before him.
“I need a big stone,” Throwing his hands up, deciding then and there that he was going to take care of this problem. Turning around to look down at his options, the rocks, not finding very many as he moved the heavier ones away to find a decent-sized one for throwing.
"He's not Senator Roan, who believed in the cause and survived until She was a nominee for President-"
Neither one speaking. Of course, what could Castiel say in a situation like this...
Something stroking his cheek snapped him out of his haze, but a new problem arose when he realized he couldn’t move. He could feel the soft texture of whatever he was laying on, possibly a bed with something really warm by his side.
"I'm fine, Dean,"
“So letting the girl take control did not work. How did she react?” He watched Dean bite his lip as he tried to remember. Originally he ‘homework’ Castiel gave him was to find a guy and do the same thing, this could still work with a female.
