"You have nothing to apologise for," he replied softly, but Dean still blamed himself for not being able to stop it.
“You’ve got everything you could ever want, or need, or dream,” Bobby said, as though reading the turmoil inside Dean’s heart. Perhaps he could. It had been so long since he and Bobby had seen each other, and so much had changed, but one thing never would: Bobby was a father to Dean, now and always. And the words that he said… Well, perhaps they were true. Maybe there was hope in heaven. “So, I guess the question is, what are you going to do now, Dean?”
He stared up at the blue sky above, and he realised that it was the same shade that Cas’ eyes had been all those years ago, sitting on that park bench, the sun shining down on him as though it was in awe too. Dean sure had been. He still was.
Charlie laughed. “Yeah, you’re definitely going to need to practice that speech.” Dean just flipped her off, but she continued to laugh as she left to find Linda.
! A mixtape made mostly of love songs from his favourite band. “I listened to it whenever I missed you when I was away,” Cas continued, and Dean’s heart gave another little throb in his chest. “I missed you a lot.”
“And why is that?” A smarmy voice asked from across the room and Lilith gritted her teeth. If Crowley wasn’t so vital to her plan then she would have had him killed by now for all of his questions. Lilith liked to keep her plans close to the chest and her demon subjects each only knew the parts which were vital to them. Crowley had weaselled his way up to the position of King of the Crossroads… or so he liked to call himself. But she didn’t trust him to clean the dirt from her shoes, let alone with a vital detail such as this one: Sam Winchester was Lucifer’s true vessel.
Unfortunately, Jack was with Cas right now too, so that also took Godly healing off the board this morning, so makeup was the only option they still had left.
Sam stopped his pursuit and fell to the floor, gasping for breath. Before Dean even had a chance to shout out his brother's name Cas flew to the position just behind Uriel and held his blade against the angel's neck.
"When an angel dies, their grace burns out of their vessel. That was trying to happen to me but my warding slowed it until it could stop it."
“Alright, grubs up!” Ash called once the last of the speeches were done and he got the go-ahead from Mrs Tran. They’d lined all of the pool tables up at the back wall, covered them with boards, and that was where the buffet was laid out.
PS. I just bought tickets to meet Osric Chau at the end of the month!! I already made an SPN fanart dress a few years ago when I met Felicia Day but now I'm designing a few more fanworks to add to it too. So excited!!
"You let Dean go to hell," Sam said as he turned to face Cas, "and then brought him back months later to make us think you're on our side. You may have Dean fooled but not me."
Idk why I thought this whole "grace sharing" idea made any sense when I first thought it up… but I like wing!kink and so I decided to keep it, no matter how stupid it is. Btw, in case you can't remember, the other way that Cas mentioned that could help save him but was very dangerous is by touching a human soul (he did this with Bobby in season 6). I know that a
, are you?” she asked lightheartedly, changing the topic to the first thing she could think of, and Dean nodded.
“Calm down, Fergus,” Rowena appeased, “it was just a wee mistake. I’m sure you’ll still look dashing without the jacket.” And, more importantly, without the jacket, he was dressed in a more acceptable black and grey. The witch gave Charlie a subtle wink and led her son away, and Charlie grinned. Yep, she was definitely more tolerable now.
“Angels, Lucifer, the damn Apocalypse… Boy, if I started believing in that crap I woulda belonged in a damn asylum. But now I know angels are real… well, it changes things.” The room fell silent again and Dean felt hope brewing in his chest. They were beginning to believe him.
, Sam? Let me out!” Dean shouted… he was getting a little anxious. Had whatever case the two had been working on messed with their heads or something?
"This is the same thing that you had at the police station," Dean said and Cas nodded even though it wasn't a question. "It kills demons… what else?" Dean asked and Cas shrugged as he put his own blade away.
Also, I'm well aware it's been over a week since my last update and I'm sorry about that. I had planned on posting this chapter on 24th but I spent the entire day watching Teen Wolf and making a dress so I forgot
“Suit yourselves, I’m getting dessert,” she said, standing up and straightening out her dress before stepping back up to the buffet. There was another woman there – a redhead with a long, flowing blue dress, wearing more jewellery than Jody had ever seen one person wear before. She wasn’t paying the food much attention though and was instead filling up a giant fish-bowl glass to the brim with gin and tonic.
Cas was saying it. The only other time that Cas had told him this, it had been moments before the Empty appeared and swallowed him up, taking him from Dean before he’d even had the time to process it.
Which reminded him in turn of the first drink he’d shared with Sammy. The fondness turned like a pit in his stomach. It wasn’t so much that Dean wished that his brother could be here with him now, more that he wished he could be down there as well. And it wasn’t simply because he’d left his brother alone back on earth. He hadn’t; Sam had Eileen, after all, and Dean knew she would take good care of him. So, it wasn’t that. Wasn’t
" But there the light was fading in his blue eyes and his muscles were becoming weaker. Dean leant his forehead against his lover's and cried. "I love you," he whispered to the limp body next to him and he was shocked by the truth of the statement; he hadn't realised until this moment just how much he cared for Cas… and now he was going to die. "I love you," his voice was weak and cracked from his heartbreak as he spoke.
Mary kept her eyes solely on her beautiful young boy, so proud of the man he had become. It was only once Dean reached the head of the aisle and turned back around, his eyes lighting up and his smile growing ten-fold, that Mary realised that Cas must have made his entrance.
Linda was tapping at her watch at the back of the room, so Bobby figured he’d better move this along before she tackled him for the mic.
They were all sitting in the Roadhouse now for the reception – himself, Mary, Sam, Jack, Claire, Charlie, and Dean and Cas all sitting upfront as everyone else was spread out on tables around the room. Bobby couldn’t help but feel a little out of place. He’d been dead for more than 8 years, and during which time, Sam and Dean’s family had only grown and grown. He’d been back for a few months now – they all had; all revived by
“You clearly never saw Cas when he thought no one was watching,” she said. “Yeah, he put on that tough guy act. But he would look at Dean like he was his whole damn world… I would know, people look at me that way all the time,” she bragged and Sam rolled his eyes. They waited a little longer before going back inside. Bobby excused himself without giving much information about what he was up to and Bela hung back in the kitchen with a glass of water as Sam went to sit with his brother.
That was how he’d met Tessa again. And it had been difficult to remember her and the time that he had refused to go with her into the afterlife. If he had done, maybe none of this would have happened. Maybe the world would have been safe. Maybe if Dean had just died then the damn Apocalypse wouldn’t be creeping closer and closer day by day. But before he’d had a chance to deal with that, the demons had appeared and kidnapped Tessa in a flurry of black smoke.
“I’m Jody,” she said, shaking his hand before reaching for a knife to cut the pie – which was apple and rhubarb, according to the tag wrapped around the pan – and Ash passed her a plate. “This is a pretty decent spread you got here.”
Cas pulled away from the embrace, and for a second Dean thought the worst. But when he opened his eyes again, and he saw nothing but adoration staring back at him. Adoration and surprise. And that was what powered him on.
down the aisle. And he’d never have known how happy it would make him to be asked by someone who he considered a son.
!” Dean sang the next line, making Cas laugh, his breath ghosting against Dean’s neck, causing the small hairs there to stand up. Dean smiled and finally turned to face him, pressing a kiss to his husband’s lips while the song continued on around them.
Dean pushed away from the door and started pacing the room. He dug his phone out of his pocket but it was no use, the signal was poor enough in Bobby’s house because of how far out they were. But in this underground room made entirely of iron? It was non-existent.
Cas was grinning up at him, his happiness sparkling in those beautiful eyes, and Dean wanted to just lean down and kiss him.
a struggle. Because ‘lover’ was technically true, but it felt too flippant. ‘Partner’ was too… stale. Dean didn’t like it. However, ‘boyfriend’ seemed too juvenile, seeing everything they had been through together.
Not gonna lie, I did want to update sooner… but it's still been less than a month since my last update, and that is a lot better than it's been the past few chapters, and so I consider this a win. Chapter 19 is almost finished but I have exams to revise for and so I'll update again on the 15th or 16th January.
, but at least he wasn’t actively trying to be a thorn in their wedding day anymore, so it was okay.
That received an aww from the guests surrounding them. Though, considering pretty much everyone here was a hunter, it was mostly in jest rather than sincerity. Dean ignored it. This moment wasn’t for
When the angels had left a message of a truce with one of her demons, she hadn’t known what to think. Surely, it had been a trap. But she’d allowed some of her more trusted underlings to meet with them and uncover the truth. It turned out that Michael wanted this Apocalypse as much as she did… and wasn’t
“What are you talking about, Bobby?” Sam asked at the same time that Cas shook his head. And, you know what, Dean was really getting fed up of being stuck behind this door, he could barely see anyone.
He looked out across the room at the faces, both familiar and unfamiliar alike. Even those who he had once known felt like strangers to him now… like Garth, and Jody, and – hell – even
He reached out and took Cas’ hand, pulling him closer so he could get a better look at those beautiful blue eyes. Dean would have thought that, after all the time he’d lost staring into them, he would be fed up with it by now. He wasn’t. He never would be.
Jack was the next one to stand up, looking an odd mix of uncomfortable and confident. Bobby hadn’t really got the chance to know the kid yet and wasn’t too sure what to expect from this speech seeing as he was: A – Lucifer’s nephilim, B – a three-year-old, and C – God.
to say. Dean needed to tell him that he’d never met another man like Cas before, that he’d been completely blown away from that very first night. He wanted to say that Cas had changed him too, that life had been brighter with him in it. That there would have been no heaven if Cas wasn’t here with him to share in it.
“For the opening reading,” Sam said once everyone had settled down again, “I suggested a few poems by Pablo Neruda, T. S. Eliot, and Shakespeare… But, Dean had other ideas, so I guess I’m going to read you the lyrics of this Led Zeppelin song, instead.”
“Wait, no!” Dean shouted, panicked. But it was useless. He moved quickly towards the door again in just enough time to see Cas appear from thin air, standing on the bottom step to the basement. Cas looked
It was supposed to have been John walking alongside her down this aisle, but it had soon become obvious that none of them had really wanted him involved today, and they were all just putting on appearances for one another. Still, Dean invited him to the wedding – probably more out of a sense of duty than anything else – but when John’s response was lacklustre at best, they’d decided to keep him out of the procession itself. Which was good thinking, it seemed, as Sam had announced this morning that John wouldn’t be making an appearance at all today. Mary wasn’t sure exactly what had gone on there because no one was talking about it, but she swore once this day was over, she was going to track that man down and kick his ass.
Linda wasn’t in the library, but Charlie eventually found her in the kitchen, pouring herself a giant glass of red wine. Charlie imagined that she probably had earned that drink more than anyone else here. Organising a hunter wedding in only a little over a month was one hell of a job.
"Protection against angels… if they come here after us then all you have to do is place your hand on this sigil and they will be sent away." Dean nodded and watched Cas work for several seconds.
Garth rested his head on top Bess’ head, sighing contently while surrounded by so much love and laughter. Being a father made him happier than anything else ever could, but it sure was nice to spend time with his other family every now and then too. Maybe once Gertie and the twins were older, they’d all be able to visit more often.
“We’ve only been together for a couple of months,” Dean continued, “but it already feels like I’ve spent a lifetime with you. And I’ll gladly spend a lifetime more.”
Cas grabbed Dean’s arm and quickly pulled him along as they searched for somewhere private for a little fun, laughing when Dean used his spare hand to pinch his ass and leant in close to whisper filthy things into his ear.
“Nah, I’m not much of a cook. More of a hacker,” the guy said. He finally had enough room to fit the pie on the table, and then he offered Jody his hand to shake. “Name's Ash, but you can call me Doctor Badass.”
"I should leave," he said quietly and Dean was about to protest but he just nodded and pulled him in for one last kiss. Cas disappeared after that, though Dean wasn't really sure if he'd flown away or just turned invisible… but Sam would think that he was gone. He didn't move from where he was kneeling on the floor and neither of them said anything for a long time.
From one second to the next, Cas was in his arms. Dean’s trepidation faded into nothing as he clutched desperately back at his angel and inhaled deeply, his senses flooding with the scent that was uniquely Cas. He smelt like the sea, like static, like an oncoming storm.
“I swear, I’m not much of a fighter, but I might just kill that witch,” Ash muttered, staring after her retreating form, and Jody laughed.
Cas sighed in relief, hearing the truth inside Dean’s words. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt him.
“He was possessing someone?” Sam asked, jaw tight. He was trying so hard to be okay with everything, for Dean’s sake, but that was messed up.
“This is their third song,” Claire told her, trying to keep the smile off her face to make it easier for Eileen to read her lips, and Eileen only laughed harder.
Dean laughed as he realised that, no, it wasn’t the rejection he feared here, it was something much, much worse.
Eventually, he took a pull from the beer Bobby had handed him, using it to control the emotions that were surely gleaming on his face. And, somehow, he stumbled into one of the few things that could have actually distracted him right now. That beer tasted like memories he’d almost forgotten, about one of the few bright days of his teenage years. The first drink he’d shared with his dad…
"Somewhere between a few months and a couple of years to disappear completely… but I live a long time Dean. To me, that isn't too long."
with her. At the Grooms’ table, Dean was laughing up a storm and recording the whole thing on his phone. Though Cas, it seemed, was more interested in watching
“They were,” Sam confirmed. Bela turned to face him quickly, her eyebrow raised high on her face, the first show of emotion she’d had since she arrived.
Kevin nodded, so Eileen quickly made her way through the crowd, leaving Claire and Kaia to keep Kevin out of trouble. Though, a voice in her head told her that perhaps they would only end up doing the exact opposite…
I know there wasn't much happening in this chapter but everything in the next chapter is completely new and doesn't follow ANY episode! I think you'll like it. I'm not the best writer (or the best at updating at the moment) but please review because it really does give me more encouragement to keep writing and get the updates posted sooner.
Cas kept held of Dean’s hand as Claire passed him the ring, and he repeated the vows back to Dean while the two of them collectively wore the biggest grins Sam had seen.
"For a while, yes. It started not long after you and Sam went your separate ways, but once Sam said yes to Lucifer… it started to get in the way of our roles."
no less, who had more reason than most to be sullen, silent grouches… well, it was a welcome surprise.
They could say that now as though it was the simplest thing in the world. As though they hadn’t been hiding those feelings away like the biggest secret in the world up until only a few months ago. They loved each other, and they could say it because, of course, they did! They always had, and they always would. ‘til death do us part and all that.
Everyone in the room groaned; they’d probably heard that story enough now, but Dean wasn’t done telling it so who cared?
?" Sam practically shouted from where he stood, shocked, in the doorway and Dean jumped off of Cas' lap instantly. His eyes quickly flicked between his brother to his lover and back again. Cas got up more slowly, but his cool didn't change the fact he looked completely debauched. "What is happening here?" Sam insisted as neither Dean or Cas spoke up. He expected Cas to make some snide remark but he instead stayed completely silent. Sam waited a few more seconds for an answer, but when none came he continued, quieter but still just as angrily. "Have you completely lost your mind, Dean? He is a
Dean expected to feel scared at that realisation, but the fear pumping through his body had nothing to do with what his family did or did not know about his relationship with a certain blue-eyed angel.
Eileen settled back into her chair, perhaps snuggling just a little bit against Sam’s side, when Kevin caught her attention from a few tables away.
“Damn you’re strong,” Dean complained… or maybe it was a compliment. Garth wasn’t sure. But it didn’t matter because soon he was stepping away from Garth and up to Cas, just in time for the song to change. Garth took Bess’ hand and spun her around while the guitar opening for Scorpion’s
He landed in the motel room and instantly recognised the angel that was standing opposite both of the brothers.
But it was fleeting. Once he’d broke the seal and Tessa had teleported them both out of there, once Dean no longer needed that angelic strength to protect himself and the seal, he couldn’t seem to conjure it back up again. He’d gone back to his motel room and tried other things too. Things that he had seen Cas do in the past, like levitate objects. He knew that he shouldn’t, Cas had warned him against it, but what was the harm in one or two little tests?
“Being cold is a small price to pay for looking fantastic,” the man answered, giving his hair a dramatic flick. Rowena, who was dressed fancier than anyone in this place, frowned.
to be at full strength for this fight. Lilith wouldn’t give the angels the opportunity to take Sam from her grasp.
The guests had all left the bunker now to take their seats outside, which just left the wedding party inside, standing and waiting by the side door that would lead out onto the makeshift aisle that Linda had arranged.
What he’d told Sam was the truth, this wasn’t really Cas. If anything was Cas then it was the wing-shaped scorch marks on the floor in Bobby’s basement. But, regardless, it was difficult to watch the body go up in flames.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Sam asked, turning to face Bobby completely now. Dean took that as a good sign… Sam was starting to think of Cas as less of a threat.
? And by Ruby do you mean the demon bitch who was manipulating you?!" Dean shouted and stepped closer.
; he just didn’t trust Cas’ ability to cook them a meal without giving them food poisoning. After all, the last time he’d attempted to cook them anything, he’d ended up dumping sugar into the frying pan because the recipe had said to ‘
,” she signed back and then returned her gaze back to the karaoke stage. The song was nearly over now, but Eileen suspected Rowena wasn’t going to let Sam leave quite so easily. She sighed and turned back to Kevin. “
"Well, now you're just showing off," Dean laughed, but it was uneasy with worry at seeing how much pain his boyfriend was in. Cas moved down the hallway and into the bedroom that was on the ground floor. He sat on the bed and indicated for Dean to lie down next to him.
“Tonic’s at the buffet. Knock yourself out,” he said, managing to omit the ‘please’ from his sentence.
Mary leant over and fixed Dean’s tie. It was the exact same shade of blue as the ribbon in her hair – made from the same material, in fact. That had been Dean’s idea, and Mary couldn’t help but think it was a particularly beautiful touch.
When the demons came, they were overrun. They appeared from every direction and before Sam knew it, Cas was dead and the wings of an angel were scorched onto the floor. Sam could only blink in shock, distracted enough that a demon was able to knock the colt out of his hands.
Sorry, but this is not the chapter Dean gets the truth. I wish it could be but I have big plans for that whole reveal.
For a moment, Dean thought he’d misheard. He turned to look Bobby’s way, his heart racing in his chest, his heart beating a mile a minute as it echoed through his eardrums. Bobby didn’t give any kind of clarification; he just waggled his eyebrows in a way which had the breath catching in Dean’s throat.
Like the guy with the mullet who had torn the sleeves off his suit jacket, for example. Mary didn’t know where to even
“I wouldn’t really describe Cas as the smitten type,” Bobby muttered and Bela laughed then. It seemed to surprise her, as though she had forgotten what laughter was like. Sam worried once again what she had been through.
“I missed you,” Dean said, his voice wavering shakily. “I missed you so much.” It had only been a few weeks, but that didn’t matter. It could have only been a few hours, a few minutes, and it still would have been true.
“Rufus,” Ellen chastised, though they all knew that wasn’t going to do any good. Rufus Turner was a surly son of a bitch at the best of times.
And when Plant started singing, Cas joined in, effortlessly whispering the lyrics under his breath. “If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you. When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.”
option left… Cas had been warning him against using the grace inside of him, but Dean had been too curious to resist. After discovering that he could chuck a man his size halfway across the room without even breaking a sweat, he’d tested it out a little. Not massively, though. It turned out he had less control when he wasn’t fighting for his life.
done anything but help us?” Dean insisted, refusing the break eye-contact and willing Sam to understand. Sam was silent and looked as though he was genuinely trying to see what Dean saw.
"Yes, Sam… that blade can kill me," he said without turning. Sam faltered and looked down at the blade, unsure what to do now that Cas knew he was holding it. Both Winchester's shared a look of fear where Dean shook his head… Cas could see the turmoil in his lover's gaze and knew exactly what he was thinking: if Cas could kill an angel then he could
"I love you, Dean," Cas spoke, very quietly. Dean realised his skin was warm to touch, too warm; it was getting hotter and hotter. But he didn't let go, he couldn't let him go. A moment later and Cas inhaled sharply and his body cooled rapidly, Dean pulled away very slightly to look at his eyes. "It's okay, I'm going to heal. I'll be okay," Cas croaked out his promise and Dean nodded. But his boyfriend still looked weak and unstable, his head was lolling a bit as he tried to focus.
“I never get tired of hearing you say how amazing I am,” he smirked, and Cas rolled his eyes. He settled back into his seat, leaning sideways and resting his head against his husband’s shoulder.
“Here,” Dean said, stepping in and rescuing the chicken from the grill before it became charcoal. Cas sighed in relief, even though he had been adamant in finishing this meal by himself, and Dean pressed a soft kiss to his cheek before wiping away the bead of sweat that clung to his hairline. Cas closed his eyes and rested his head against Dean’s hand, drained after spending the last couple of hours racing around the kitchen. Dean had, obviously, offered his help sooner – seeing as how Cas could barely cook anything to save his own life – but he had been forcibly removed from the kitchen by his husband, who was insistent on doing this alone. But now, when Dean asked: “How can I help?” Cas was desperate enough that he didn’t turn him away.
Reuploaded because I'm an idiot and forgot to delete a note i'd left to remind myself to find the exact wording of Ellen's quote *face palm* (this, ladies and gentlemen, is what University does to a person). Chapter named after a Eurythmics song (also covered by Marilyn Manson and, arguably, made better because of it)
happened in this chapter so I hope you all liked it. It's named after the Foo Fighters song of the same name; alternative names would have been Play the Game (by Queen) or Coming Undone (by Korn). Leave a review?
“Of course, go ahead, Darling. Samuel’s not giving me much to work off anyway,” she said, shaking her head, and Eileen laughed. She could see why everyone liked Rowena.
Sam had to step in then as the list of amicable exes ran thin, putting a stop to their showdown before Dean could make Jack bring back Anna, and before Cas could figure out what the real name for that reaper that he’d lost his virginity to was and bring her back too.
“Because that’s just the kind of man you are,” Cas said. “You’re caring, and thoughtful, and you are the most loving man I have ever met. Knowing you made me want to be a better person. Knowing you gave my whole existence meaning.
Dean felt physical pain at the loss of his boyfriend. He would never see Cas again. Never hear his voice or kiss his lips. Nothing.
So, she’d stationed the demons outside of Bobby’s house, their vessels warded by witches to disguise them, and waited until they were sure that Castiel was present. And so now Castiel was dead, Bela had infiltrated the Winchesters’ inner circle and was reporting to Lilith, and the angel warding remained. Everything was going exactly to plan.
Dean dressed quickly and sped his way over to Bobby’s house, getting there within just five hours of making the call. Bobby was waiting on the porch and motioned for him to hurry, which he did: whatever could get Bobby acting like
Mary turned back to Bobby and Sam, all of them waiting to hear the opening notes of that ridiculous song…
Dean nodded and started to clench and unclench his jaw, Cas watched in awe. Something about that simple movement made his features sharper and more attractive, he licked at his cracked lips as his eyes travelled over the face of his lover, memorising its beauty. Dean turned and met his eyes.
Charlie shrugged apologetically. Mary cast a look between the two of them and shook her head, deciding that she probably didn’t want to know, so instead of asking she just grinned.
! “He was such a chubby little thing, and so damn happy. I swear that he smiled at me that first night – the doctors say it’s impossible, that babies don’t smile until they’re six weeks, but I
Cas’ fingers were still drumming against his glass in tempo to the song as though he wasn’t even conscious of it. Dean shook his head, forgetting his dinner for a moment as he stood up and offered Cas his hand. Cas blinked at him in confused for a moment, unsure, and so Dean rolled his eyes and reached down to tug him up to his feet and into an embrace before leading them in a dance around the library.
Dean began to let out a complaint at that, but Cas immediately silenced him with a kiss, which once again got the crowd cheering.
“Calm down, Doctor Badass,” she said. “The invitation specifically said that no murder was allowed.”
Zacharia had told Sam that he and Dean were an important part in God’s plan and he wanted to speak to them both in person. So, Sam had given up the location of their hotel room. Zacharia had thanked him, smiled, and placed his hand on Sam’s shoulder. Sam had awoken instantly and forcibly. It had been disorientating. After only a moment, Zacharia had appeared before them but he’d barely finished introducing himself before Cas had shown up.
“Why are you even still here?” He asked. Bela wasn’t exactly his favourite person to begin with. Never mind, after what she had done today.
“Before I was born, I chose Castiel to be my dad,” Jack said, as though remembering being a foetus was just a normal everyday occurrence that everyone could relate to. “I can only remember bits and pieces about that time, but I remember feeling
Did demons have a higher tolerance for alcohol than people did? She’d never exactly thought to ask before…
Still, after Dean had decided to invite the former King of Hell to their wedding… Cas may have reacted pettily.
“I didn’t get to see all of their journey – one of the drawbacks of being dead for the past eight years – but I can see that everything they’ve been through has only made them stronger, has only made them love each other more, and that’s what matters most.” Bobby raised his glass then, turning to the happy couple and ending his speech with: “Boys, I wish you both a long and happy marriage.”
would be the ones to take that victory. And, anyway, the angels may want this Apocalypse but they certainly didn’t plan on losing it. They knew as well as Lilith did that Sam Winchester was Lucifer’s true vessel. Keeping him on the straight and narrow would be a benefit to them but a devastation to Lucifer. Sam
It was Claire’s turn now, and she took the mic from Charlie as she stood up, though her stomach seemed to stay seated. So, perhaps it was a good thing that she hadn’t had any of that champagne, after all…
I was going to write the whole thing in Castiel's PoV but there were a few parts that I thought up that I really wanted to happen but Cas couldn't be there so it's anyone's PoV but mainly Cas's. The titles of chapters will be the names of the episodes they're based on but not every chapter is based on an episode so some of them will just have the name of a random rock song that I think fit in well with the chapter.
The fight had left Dean now. He was still shaking with rage but it was no longer directed at Bela. Slowly, Sam let go of his brother and Den adjusted his jacket. He shook his head and left the room without another word. Bobby looked as though he was going to follow but Sam put his hand in the way and shook his head.
Sam placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder and Dean looked up at him, his eyes red and his face wet with tears. He looked devastated and that broke Sam’s heart.
“It was instinct!” Dean defended himself, hands in the air. “It was pretty cool though, right,” he laughed and grinned at his little brother. Sam looked as though he didn’t know what to think. Cas shook his head and explained how Dean was holding some of his grace for the time being to let it, and ultimately Cas, heal.
“How did they even get through your house, Bobby?” Dean asked and placed his drink back onto the table. And it was true, there were devil’s traps and warding sigils all over this place, it would have been impossible for so many demons to navigate them without a single one being caught. Bela got up and started pacing. Sam watched her for a moment but soon turned his gaze back to his family when Bobby started speaking.
But Cas didn’t die and Dean had left with him. Sam had been trying to get in touch with him since then but to no avail, since his brother was refusing to pick up his damn phone. And his attempts at tracking Dean had also failed. Honestly, Sam was worried. As a hunter, Dean should know better than to just disappear off of the map like this.
“We’ve got a lot of speeches to get through today, and Linda has warned us all to keep them short and sweet, or she’ll cut the power to the microphone,” Mary said, gaining a laugh from the crowd. Bobby didn’t laugh though; he’d received the exact same threat from Mrs Tran earlier today, and the fire in her eyes was damn scarier than it had any right to be. “Though that’s probably a good thing, because I’m sure I’ll turn into a blubbering mess if I stand up here too long, but I have a reputation as a hunter to uphold.”
“I was somewhere, but it wasn’t England,” she laughed humourlessly. Eventually, she shook her head. “It’s not important right now. What have you done to piss off all of those demons?”
Sorry for how small this chapter is, I just really wanted to write this part but couldn't see Cas doing much.
Also, in case anyone forgot, the reason why Gabe was so shocked about Cas taking a vessel in particular is because they were like forbidden or something at the time.
"We don't want your help," Sam said angrily and Cas moved his head up towards the sky like he does when someone is being unreasonable or annoying, Dean smiled. But then he caught sight of something in Sam's hand; it was only a slight glint of shiny metal, half hidden up his coat sleeve. But he recognised it and began to panic. It was an angel blade. While Cas wasn't paying attention Sam thrust the blade into his chest, catching him off guard. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion.
For a moment, she thought about asking to sit it out, but then she looked over at Cas and her heart sunk. She couldn’t do that to him. He deserved better than that.
time. He captured Cas’ lips with his own, hearing that soft gasp of surprise just before their mouths met, their bodies pressed flat against one another – warm, and solid, and
And as Dean drove, with every passing second, he built up more and more courage. He questioned why he was even scared of it in the first place; why was he so terrified to ask for what he wanted? Was it the rejection that he feared? Because that just wasn’t rational, not anymore. Not after what Cas had said…
got a laugh, and it helped in part to ease her nerves a little. But what helped more than that was when her eyes found Kaia’s and they shared a smile.
,” shouted the British demon at the back of the room. And, yep, high alcohol tolerance notwithstanding, he was
! Two months where Dean could hold Cas’ hand without caring who saw. Two months where he could press a kiss on his cheek, his jaw, his neck, shoulder, lips. Two months with a ring on his finger – which had been a strange feeling at first but now felt as comfortable to him as his own skin.
until I met you,” Cas said, turning to face him, and Dean pressed a short kiss against his cheek. He loved his sappy little angel. “That was when my whole life changed.”
“Ladies, gentlemen,” Charlie said as she began her speech, and then she grinned before continuing to list off: “werewolves, vampires… witches, and bitches.” Everyone laughed.
He felt Bela’s eyes on him but he tried to ignore it. It wasn’t until he’d drained the bottle and she was
. Dean was really getting into it as they belted out the verses, and Garth was glad to see him enjoying himself so much. By the time they got to the guitar solo, the newlyweds just started making out on stage, and everyone hooted and hollered. Still, they didn’t seem to care, not bothering to continue on with the final chorus as they got progressively handsy up there.
, just watching Cas sleep. Watching the rise and fall of his chest, listening to the heavy sighs which escaped his lips, admiring the flutter of his eyelids and the occasional curve to his lips as he dreamt. They hadn’t put a name to what they were at that point, and Cas had been okay with that, but it had been bugging Dean. So, that morning, he just lay there and struggled to figure it out. And it
“Now, don’t be such a sourpuss,” Garth goaded. “I can tell you’ve got dancer's hips. Come have some fun!”
you do anything,” Dean said with murder in his eyes as he struggled against Sam. Bobby soon moved to help hold him back too.
“We can’t do that, Son,” Bobby replied and Dean knew that his only option was to tell them the truth. He rested his head on the door and took a deep breath. He didn’t really know why he was keeping this from them anyway: Cas had just done so much to keep his identity a secret to protect them. And Dean knew it was valiant but stupid. They
it is for humans to contain grace than because of the pain, but the sleep would help Dean's body to heal and make the pain decrease.
“I’m sorry, okay!” She shouted, taking several steps back and raising her hands in submission. “They made me do it.”
The wedding ceremony was taking place in a field out back behind the bunker, but all the guests were milling around in the library for the time being, so Charlie went to check there first. She arrived in the room at the same time that the demon Crowley entered the bunker… dressed in a white suit jacket… which was not only a questionable choice for a wedding but also
“I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. Dean was always a little too macho to be completely straight. And Cas was definitely smitten.”
“Do I look like a painted whore to you?” Dean protested as Charlie neared him with a makeup brush. She grinned.
“There’s some pretty strange activity going on over here and I could really do with your help,” Bobby answered and Dean nodded to himself.
"Then what are you?" he asked warily, but he already thought he knew the answer. Cas leaned against the wall next to the sigil.
Surprisingly, Dean didn’t seem to care about that anymore… or maybe it wasn’t so surprising considering the choice words he’d let slip last night while absolutely
Deep in his heart, Dean knew what he wanted. And as Bobby’s question ran through his mind, the distraction that he’d afforded himself faded and emotions – good and bad alike – filled his lungs, making it difficult to breathe. And then he saw the Impala, sitting there like the answer to his prayers. That car was his home, and right now… Dean could use some comfort, some time to think.
"You're lying to me again, aren't you?" Dean said quietly. Cas didn't answer which was all the answer Dean needed. "What can I do?"
“Yeah, put your ass into it!” Jo added on, and Cas let out a happy laugh as he took control of their dance and led Dean around the floor.
He picked Cas’ blade off of the floor and used it to defend himself as best as he could. He was knocked to the floor and struggled to keep the demon on top of him from plunging a blade into his chest when suddenly a gun sounded and the demon was shot in the head. His eyes flickered and lit up like an electric shock had run through him as the demon died.
She didn’t have the different champagnes on hand to try, but she did have descriptions, so Charlie glanced down the list and picked one for the toasts. Linda left to tell Ash – who was also helping to organise the wedding since the reception would be at the Roadhouse; and, yeah, Charlie wasn’t sure exactly how
been powerful. But her demons had done what the angels couldn’t. Lilith grinned and sat back in her chair. Today was a good day.
In fact, the only reason this chapter is even written now and not in 2 weeks time when I've bought a new laptop and don't have to suffer using my Dad's horrible one, is because of that one guest reviewer who reviewed like four times begging for an update. So yeah, this update is for you!
Charlie approached with the makeup brush again, and Dean leaned away further. Apparently, he only wore makeup when drunk… What a loser. And she meant that in the most affectionate way possible.
“Anyway, I was awake just long enough to see Dean stab the guy in the heart, but hey, I guess that’s just his way of flirting.” The room laughed. “Well, it worked out in the end, though, so who am I to judge?” At that, Dean and Cas smiled at each other and shared a kiss. And as brief as it may be, it still got the crowd cheering. “Next thing I know, the guy’s rebelling from Heaven for Dean… In hindsight, I probably should’ve clocked on then that they were pining for each other. But, hey, it may have taken ‘em twelve years, but they got here eventually.”
Claire took her seat, turning to Jack with a question in her eyes. He only grinned back, but that was all the answer she needed.
“I missed you a lot too,” Dean admitted. Of course, he’d missed him. He’d missed him every damn second of every day that they weren’t together.
"I'm not from this time," Cas said after taking a deep breath, Dean lifted his eyebrow but said nothing. "I'm from 2014. I came back to this time to change things."
Cas summoned his grace and it sluggishly came into reach. He was injured badly and so it took several seconds to be able to use it. Dean was right, he wouldn't be able to defend them if he needed to, he would be almost useless… again. Sam was Lucifer's vessel which meant he'd had more power, add to that the demon blood that he'd ingested as a baby and he was almost capable of killing him… which meant that the injuries were much more extensive than he assumed they would be. He closed his eyes and searched for the least damaged section of his grace to offer up to Dean. Cas placed his palm on his boyfriend's chest and pushed his grace outwards. The human stiffened and began to breathe heavily.
." He brushed his hand lightly over the scar in deep thought. "You were burning up… you felt like you were on fire… what was that?"
As far as I can remember the show doesn't actually say if Cas can or can't see hellhounds but I thought, well if he couldn't before then he can now because he's more powerful. Also I figured that, since Crowley forced Bobby's soul into hell but no demon had done it for getting a righteous man, Crowley was probably the first one to do it.
.” She shrugged, it wasn’t exactly something she would recommend doing or idolising, it had been pretty reckless actually. But, hey, she was allowed to brag about herself every now and then. And after Linda had left to go deal with an issue with the wedding cake, Eileen and Kevin had both just fallen into hunting stories. Although Kevin’s stories mostly revolved around a computer, he still had some good anecdotes to share.
“For God’s sake, not this again. He’s an angel, okay!” Dean finally shouted, pulling back from the door and lifting his hands in exasperation. The men on the other side of the door were silent and Dean took that as a bad sign rather than a good one. Bobby opened the little flap on the door so that they could see each other. Bobby was frowning in at him as Sam stood a little further back looking thoroughly unimpressed. They didn’t believe him. “I’m telling you the truth, guys. He’s an angel. That’s why he knew all of those douchebag angels, and why he knew what Ruby was up to, and that’s why the demons are so involved in this war. It’s their fight!”
Sam did a literal spit take at that while Eileen patted his back, and Bobby laughed. Dean and Cas both just blinked at their son for a moment before they both split into laughter too.
“I’ll drink to that,” she said, moving to grab Cas’ glass but he was quicker than she was and swiped it quickly out of the way with a shake of his head. “What? I’m not allowed a glass of champagne at the wedding of the guy who’s wearing my dead dad’s body?”
Dean didn’t look as much in shock anymore. He looked pissed. He looked ready to take on the whole world for revenge.
“That’s what I thought,” Bela said, shaking her head. “But then I was kidnapped by a demon named Alastair.” Dean froze suddenly and stopped struggling. It looked as though he’d been slapped across the face by the name. And Sam could understand why considering Alastair was the one who’d tortured Dean in hell. Sam looked closer at Bela and took in the bruises and cuts that were visible to him. But it was more than that, Sam hadn’t quite been able to put his finger on what it was earlier but now he knew: she looked broken inside. “He… he told me to say hi to you, Dean.”
But his brother had then quite literally stolen the keys to the Impala to keep them from leaving. He’d spent the next few hours talking them into agreeing to
just what kind of case they were working when the door to the panic room slammed shut. Dean spun around as he heard the lock slide into place.
When they pulled apart again, Dean glared at his guests for the interruption, and they all just laughed.
Linda opened the door and ushered them out, Sam walking down the pebbled pathway first. At the end of the aisle was a large oak tree, decorated with ribbons of all colours, and that was where Sam stood. Whereas Mary and Bobby moved to stand in the front row of white fold-out seats. It was a cold morning today, but that didn’t matter when there were also so many space heaters surrounding the seats laid out to the right and left of the aisle. After getting to their chairs, Mary turned back around to see the flower girl skipping happily down the pathway, followed by the rest of the wedding party while the soft strumming continued to play through the speakers on the lawn.
Thankfully, though, Cas knew her well as he only smiled, and Dean shook his head while responding with: “Not unless you’re twenty-one, you don’t.”
Dean reached over and held his mother’s hand, whispering his thanks. And, true to her word, Mary’s eyes began to fill with tears.
Eventually, Dean returned from the junkyard to Bobby’s house, finding a pyre in the back garden. Dean’s chest felt heavy as he watched Sam toss another log on the structure. He was going to have to say goodbye to Cas now for good. Dean approached Sam and they silently finished the pyre.
“What? How?” Sam questioned. The demons would have needed a human working on their side to break so many traps…. everyone in the room turned their gaze to Bela. She looked between them with wide eyes, her jaw clenched in fear. But she made no move to deny it.
? How pitiful." Zachariah withdrew his own angel blade and charged forwards. Sam smiled in relief at having the angel on their side to help to kill the trickster; while Dean grimaced and had a mental battle about which side he was on… his lover's or the supposed angel's.
So, when Cas woke up, Dean immediately got down on one knee and popped the question. And after spending another couple of hours wrapped up together, they showered, packed some clothes, and went to invite Sam, and Mary, and whoever else was around that morning, to see them get hitched.
Everything died back down again, so Charlie passed Dean the ring, and he went about saying his vows while slipping it onto Cas’ finger. They’d decided not to write their own vows since they were doing speeches later, so Sam had just tweaked a sample one off the internet that they both liked:
"Fuck, Cas… when you look at me like that I have real trouble believing you're an angel," Dean laughed and Cas smirked. He leant forward and pulled the man into a deep kiss. Their tongues explored one another's mouths, just tasting each other. Cas moaned as Dean pushed him back onto the sofa, climbing on top of him. They broke apart from the kiss, panting heavily for oxygen, and leant their foreheads together. Cas' hands ran over Dean's body and he squeezed his ass, causing the man on top of him to take a sharp intake of breath. Cas chuckled and leant up for another kiss, though this one was slower and imitate. Eventually, the long kisses turned into shorter loving ones.
. The other pages on the table were just as random, he skimmed over the ones he could see: an article about agriculture, one about a cat that won some kind of competition, and one about a phone review.
“No!” Dean shouted, beating against the door with his fist. His family was being attacked while he was locked in this damn panic room with no way to help. All he could do was stand and watch. Cas dispatched the first 2 demons quickly with the demon blade while Bobby fought them off with the demon knife and Sam loaded the colt and began firing. But there were too many and his family wasn’t prepared for the onslaught. How had Cas not sensed them? That was supposed to be impossible!
He hopped over the counter and grabbed the three bottles of beer, taking a detour on his way back to the table to grab one more plate of nachos from the buffet. Linda Tran was the only one there at the moment, refilling some of the empty containers with more food. She smiled and nodded at him as he grabbed a new plate. Before either of them could speak, though, there was suddenly the loud sound of someone coughing up a storm and launching a glass at a nearby wall. It was that demon Crowley again, his mouth visibly smoking as he grabbed the wine glass right out of a nearby hunter’s hand and chugged the whole thing.
’ go –” he emphasised the words by making quotation gestures, made more awkward as he was holding the mic and refused to pull away to talk, and Dean rolled his eyes “– I’ve been informed that’s a rather good one.”
Dean hung his head in shame while Charlie laughed, but Mary just pressed a kiss to his cheek, lightly enough that she wouldn’t smudge
“I’ve got quite the speech to follow up there, haven’t I?” Bobby started. “Well, I ain’t much for words, but I’ll see what I can do.”
They’d come back for Sam and Eileen’s wedding, of course. Arrived back the day before and stayed to see them off to their own honeymoon. Then spent a couple of days milling around the bunker. But it was different now. They’d been gone for more than a month at that point, and it had gone from overcrowded to silent and empty and just as unbearable. So, they’d left again.
Dean tracked her down and discovered the building Cas has told him about, covered in angel warding sigils. For a moment, Dean had worried that he wouldn’t be able to pass through. But he took a deep breath and tried anyway. He’d had to grit his teeth as the grace inside of him twitched painfully while he passed the border but, once he was inside, he was fine. That was until he was ambushed by Alastair and his goons.
He was in a large open room with a sigil of some kind painted onto the floor. Dean was being restrained by one demon as another stood in front of him holding a knife. Sam was about to run inside to help when suddenly Dean broke free from the first demon and flung him across the room and into a wall, hitting the second demon in the process.
! But he knew right then that it wouldn't matter, anyway. Sam wouldn't believe him and Dean didn't feel like standing around and explaining. So he turned around and he left. Sam didn't try to follow him, which was as much of a relief as it was hurtful. Dean realised once he left the house, though, that he didn't actually know where they were. He looked around but the house was in the middle of the woods with only a dirt road in front of it. There was a car though. Dean walked over and climbed inside, hotwiring it easily. And then he just drove. He didn't know where he was going but he figured he'd get to a road sign soon enough, there was plenty of petrol in the tank too. After about an hour, though, he pulled up at the side of the road and leaned his head against the steering wheel. He had expected Cas to show back up and now he was worried.
But there was one thing standing in their way: the trickster sitting on the Winchesters’ shoulders. Which, as it turned out, wasn’t a trickster after all but a rogue angel. They assumed he was staying at Bobby Singer’s house but they couldn’t be sure as it had been completely warded against angels… but a demon could still get through.
Dean stared at the scene, his jaw slack, and he wouldn’t have believed his own eyes if he couldn’t feel the grace inside his chest twinging in pain.
Sam managed to talk Bobby into coming along too, but the older hunter was extremely disappointed when he’d discovered Sam wasn’t planning on actually talking to Dean. No, his brother had made it abundantly clear that he didn’t want to see Sam. That wasn’t what this was about. This was about making sure Dean was safe from that trickster. So, they hung back and watched.
But Lilith never intended on keeping up her end of the bargain with the angels. Let them be the ones that claimed Castiel’s life? No. He had been a thorn in her side for too long. The
The angels wanted some of Lilith’s demons to break in and destroy the angel-proofing on the building so that they could enter. But that wasn’t a good enough deal for her. Yes, getting Castiel to disappear was vital for her plan to succeed, but now that she knew what she was truly up against she was sure she could find a way to do that by herself without the angels’ help. After all, she’d been taught everything there was to know about angels by Lucifer himself. Trapping and keeping one would be easy.
’ Cas asked and Dean blinked, looking around the room quickly before realising Cas’ voice was in his head.
“Do you want me to get rid of that black eye or not?” Charlie demanded, crossing her arms, and Dean sighed as he looked into the mirror again to examine the bruise. The bachelor party last night may have gotten a little out of hand… Charlie could only blame herself for that one. Charlie-X had wanted to keep things a bit more casual and play some D&D – as in
“You can’t say the Roadhouse doesn’t accommodate for all dietary needs,” he said, “even that of a bloodsucker.”
on the same day when Jack had chosen to undo all of Chuck’s meddling – and that feeling of not belonging still hadn’t left yet. But his boys still wanted Bobby around, so that was good enough for him.
Mary’s phone buzzed then inside her bag – a text from Linda Tran to the wedding group chat, informing everyone that Cas was on his way, so they had to take their positions.
“Good. Now, important question: you’re not really going to make me watch you walking down the aisle to
But Cas didn’t want the words to sit with him like that; he wanted Dean to remember them in a different light.
“Get a room, you two!” Sam shouted as the song ended, but neither Dean nor Cas was making any move to stop feeling each other up on stage.
“You okay, Boy?” Bobby asked and Dean gave a thumbs up. Sam gave one last look at Cas… or, he supposed, Cas’
“I sure am glad your father already picked Gertie up,” Garth said, and Bess nodded and laughed. Their kids were all staying with him for the weekend to allow Garth and Bess some husband-and-wife time. Gertie
“Come on,” Sam encouraged and Dean looked down at Cas’ body again, then he turned his head further and brushed his fingertips against the wing marks scorched into the concrete where Cas had died. After a moment, Dean picked Cas up completely and carried his body upstairs. He lay Cas down on Bobby’s sofa and sat beside him silently. Sam and Bobby shared a look with each other before deciding to give him some time alone to say goodbye. They moved to stand out on the porch and that’s when Sam got his first real look at Bela.
“Not exactly,” Jack said, his tone very matter-of-fact in a way that gave them all pause to hear him out. “But I believe he is having sex with Rowena in the manager’s office.”
“Yeah, Cas told me about it. An angel’s visage, or whatever, is too powerful for human eyes so they have to take a vessel.”
“I better get going,” Mary said, gathering her things and giving her son one last appraisal. “You look great,” she said softly, and Dean echoed the sentiment. Mary turned to Charlie: “And you… don’t go spilling wine on my dress.”
Jody laughed. She’d heard her fair few stories about him lately. They ranged from ridiculous to sleazy, but Jody wasn’t one to judge. Plus, he was clearly close with the brothers since it was his idea to have the wedding here after he’d revived the Roadhouse.
Sorry for the lack of smut, but there's a lot to come (hehe) in the next few chapters and I didn't want to post too much of it.
“Well…” Bobby said while Dean was still struggling to press all of his regrets and anguish back down into that little box inside his chest, to suppress everything like he’d always had to. “Cas helped.”
“So, Jack did all that?” Dean asked, an equal amount of pride and regret swirling around in his head. He never had got the chance to fully make things right with Jack. He wasn’t proud of how he’d treated the kid, wasn’t proud of the decision’s he’d made and words he’d spat out in anger. He hoped that one day he would get the chance to apologise. He hoped they could still be family. He hoped…
Bess laughed and reached down to pull Cas to his feet; the former angel went along happily to the dancefloor. Dean stared after them for a moment before sighing and standing to follow.
“Alright, what are we working with?” Dean asked as he got his mind back on track, taking the wooden spoon from Cas and preparing himself as he moved to taste the sauce that his husband had been working on.
your friend, Uriel," Cas said as he released the angel, he pulled away for a second and then plunged his knife in the man's back, who proceeded to drop to the floor in front of him. Cas flew over his body to get to the Winchesters, he placed a hand on Dean's shoulder and flew all three of them to a safe house before any of the other angels broke out of their shock and decided to attack him again.
“I love you,” Dean said, and Cas looked up from where he was stirring the sauce, his blue eyes so beautiful. He smiled.
"I'm here, Dean," Cas said, he lifted his head and looked at his boyfriend. His eyes drifted over his face, and he noticed how pale and tired he looked, and then down at the blood-soaked remains of his shirt.
“I’ll take a gin and tonic,” Rowena continued, ignoring his attitude. Ash just reached over and passed her the entire bottle of gin. Maybe she would be more tolerable if she were drunk.
. He was still so drained from when Sam had stabbed him that he didn’t seem to be fully aware of the situation.
