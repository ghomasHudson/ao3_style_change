“I’m still pessimistic,” said Lestrade. “I still think we’ll have nothing to talk about, nothing in common but sexual chemistry,” his eyes lingered on Mycroft’s body for a moment too long, then he shook his head, “but both be too polite to say so, and thus, make each other miserable for no good reason, but…”
Sherlock’s core muscles were aided by those of his own fingers, digging into John’s thighs, urging John closer, and those of his lips when they whined,

“No, Cinders!” he exclaimed. “You shall go!”
“That is—” murmured Sherlock.
She reached out and caressed the Malacca handle of his umbrella.
“Out. No napping in the tub.”

“Go.”

“Watson!”

Kate’s cloud got sweeter. She heard her own moaning, soft and urgent, and she felt her body pitch awkwardly in Irene’s lap.
“There are thousands of cafés in this city. I know, I’ve staggered ‘bout the whole place and counted. Seen ‘em all. Had a drink in most of ‘em. I picked this one because they only give me the second worst table. That lump of a fellow, just beyond my bad shoulder, yes, him, Methuselah’s rag-and-bone man, he gets the prize post, but I suppose he’s beyond caring about the view of anything but the pearly gates. And there’s lots to see even from here. The painters, the writers, the poets, the actors, the worn-out soldiers, the once-were’s, the never-were’s, the might-have-been’s. The crooks and the gamblers and the swindlers and the roughs. They say there’s even a fellow on the prowl who likes to jump up and garrote you when you’re just shuffle along, minding your own business. But I haven’t seen ‘im. Yes, there’s a lot to see. And then there’s you.”
“Indeed.”
“You’re family, John,” whispers Mycroft. “You’re our heart.”
“Good work,” he told himself. “Perhaps so good as to be deserving of a treat.”
“Pardon me, Detective Inspector. I’m clearing my schedule.”
Molly had turned her head. She’d expected lips on hers but got the rim of a glass.
Mycroft shuddered.
Lestrade stared.
“I’d like that. A lot.”
“I mean, I thought you only feasted on the blood of your enemies.”
A ginger nut is vodka, Frangelico, and ginger beer.
Then he went back into the bookshop, past the café, to the farthest row, a quiet place with naked light bulbs hanging down like bats.
Holmes and Lestrade both preened at the ‘you,’ then noticed the other was preening and shot censorious looks across the table while Watson hid his mirth in his teacup.

Sherlock surveyed the chaotic scene, then he looked up at the surrounding buildings.

But as soon as John stood, he was jerked around, his trousers were open, and Sherlock was rummaging through the overhead cabinets with one hand.
“Then I am in another garden. This one is populated with nothing but Watsons. Male Watsons. Female Watsons. Creature Watsons. Shadow figure Watsons. Thousands of Watsons. Watsons feasting on a large strawberry. Watsons filing into a cracked egg. Watsons riding boars and bulls and stags around a pond where Watsons bathe.

He picked at the bedclothing and shrugged. Then he cast a glance at my swaddled torso and said, “Your ribs.”

The soft light coalesced into one beam in which appeared a squirming, self-slicking, tentacle-fingered stump of an arm headed straight for Greg’s half-hard cock.
“You came out with the information Lestrade needed on Crawford readily enough. I thought you’d play a little harder to get.”
“And I’ve a surprise,” continued John, ignoring the gripe, but when Sherlock stepped into the kitchen, his face fell and he swore.

“Dinner in? That’s almost romantic.”

“I thought you didn’t—”
Immediately, one wet, sex-scented fingertip pushes between Sherlock’s lips. His stroking hand speeds up, keeping time with his greedy sucking.

“Perhaps Mrs. Hudson will let us use her breeding stand, that way I can mount you all day,” said John as he stripped Sherlock from the waist. “I’ll keep you gagged, that is, when your mouth isn’t otherwise occupied.”

He laughed. “The night is young, Watson. And there is music.”

This only made Irene lean forward more, her grin turning into full blown smile, “Sherlock is it? I wonder if the youngest Holmes will be as cold as his elder brother hmmm? I think I saw a glimpse of him on the platform. Can’t wait to have him in Slytherin if he's anything like you.”
“I do hope the sorting doesn’t take long tonight,” Gregory said breaking the silence, “I’m starving.”
For his 5th birthday his parents had bought him his very first and
But that would be changing too would it? Everything would. No longer would his brother need to talk to him. Even if he did choose Slytherin, Sherlock could hardly let his name only hold bearing as “Mycroft’s little brother.” No meals or communication would be required at all. He seriously doubted they would even exchange greetings before the Holidays.
Day quickly faded into night and the train let out one loud whistle, indicating they were nearing their destination— Hogwarts. The nervousness he had felt that morning flooded back in swells as he pulled his robes over his clothing, adjusting them so they fit nicely over his clothing. Hermione of course had pulled hers on the second they settled on the train, and the poor Longbottom fellow struggled to pull his on, but finally managed it as the train rolled to a stop.
As his mother was beginning to whisk bowls away for cleaning, water bubbling and brushes beginning to scrub dishes suspended over the sink, the family owl flew rather gracefully through the open kitchen window and landed on the large oak family table in front of him. A sleek, black owl, Sherlock was rather fond of Eurus. She had always taken to him in such a warm way, unlike the other members of the Holmes family. Eurus fluffed up her feathers proudly, nipping at his fingers to turn his attention to the envelope dropped on the table.

I am fascinated by muggles. I was studying the laws  physics before Mother dragged me to get my school things. I am a first year as well.”
“He won’t be in Slytherin,” Mycroft cut off, “it isn’t his style. I’m warning you Irene, stay clear of him.”
His comment was ignored. Business as usual today then.
Sherlock said nothing while exiting the room. While his brother and he had been once quite close, at some point before his brother’s first year at Hogwarts that began to shift, until the point where their relationship only consisted of the necessities.

September 1st?
He wasn’t sure why exactly but he had a very buried desire to know where the girl was and If she had her eyes zoned in on Gregory.
He however did note that she had placed herself at nearly the opposite end of the Gryffindor table from Gregory talking at length with one of the millions of Weasley boys. He thought this one was Percy. A close friend of hers.
But that was not the cards he was dealt.
He stayed silent for the entire lot of her rambles, which rather quickly spilled into a rather good deduction and sharp knowledge of the clearly unfamiliar works around her. He didn’t even give her polite nods at least to seem like he was interested in her conversation.
Sherlock had perched himself in the kitchen chair quite like a bird, a book laying on the table across from his fairly untouched bowl of hot porridge and fresh strawberries. Muttering to himself,taking quick notes into a thick journal, his muggle pen jotting rapidly against paper.
It was perhaps the first time he had ever been felt his age in his entire life. He felt like the scared eleven year old boy that he was. He was scared— and the fact he only would see his parents at Christmas, was nearly unthinkable.
He couldn’t help but wonder if he had been born
“Oh yes I completely agree!!” She squealed,”I suppose it would be fascinating from your perspective. I always knew I was different,” she cleared her throat, tucking a strand of her rather bushy hair behind her ear—
Coming from a rather old and fairly wealthy line of purebloods did have its positives and negatives. A positive: nearly everyone scraping to please them since it was common knowledge that they had coin to burn and strings they can pull for whatever the need. His father and mother both working in the ministry and well known among pureblood society did help inflate the power that came with the name. The downsides  piled higher; Sherlock had realized at a young age that the pureblood superiority was rather rubbish and refused to entertain it. In fact he rather admired muggles. The next being that absolutely everyone knew you and everyone wanted to make nice.
True to his word, Sherlock owled Hermione after their meeting in Diagon Alley. He might have waited a few weeks after the meeting to actually send the letter, but he sent it nonetheless.  It was rather short and to the point. He hated the necessity of dragging on with pointless introductions and pleasantries so he did quickly skip to the point. He naturally asked on the progress of her studies and if she had any questions she would like to discuss with him at length. He gave a short description of how their mail system worked and instructed her that Eurus would stay in her care until she had completed a letter to send back to him. That had been the short of it.
He detested the fact, but it would play in his favor regardless.
The Potter boy walked his way slowly up to the chair, visibly shaking even from the distance Sherlock sat at. His clothes hung more like trash bags underneath his robes rather than actual clothes; his thin frame a mixture of natural physic and malnutrition. The hat took an enormous amount of time on the boy’s head— much to Sherlock’s relief but to the annoyance of everyone else in the room.

For the rest of the summer he did his best to write back to her in length comparable to her own, with his own questions about her muggle life.

But she didn’t seem to mind it entirely, but when she disagreed she was not afraid to spar back at him.
The comment was completely overlooked with the joyful cries of his mother and the boisterous cheers of his father, large hands patting Sherlock’s small shoulders. There were many

Up the left hand staircase was the boy’s rooms, the first year boy’s taking the floor closest to the common room. He found himself sharing his quarters with Terry Boot, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein and Draco Malloy— the last of which immediately bounded into his bed, drawing the deep blue curtains around him for privacy. If Sherlock listened close enough, he could hear the tale tale sniffs of crying, but instead focused his intentions on the beautiful mountainside view of the window next to his bed. Eurus was perched in her cage atop his bedside table. The bed was roomy and very comfortable, designed in the natural tones of bronze and deep blue. His area, like his classmates included a small side table, a dresser and a writing desk for his studies. At the end of the bed, sat a wide bookcase, which he immediately sat to the task of organizing his muggle books by category and alphabetically. He unpacked his robes and clothing into the dresser as quickly as possible— and not nearly enough attention to detail as his books received, before he placed his muggle pen and journal on his bedside table.
“What would you propose my Mia? What can I do? And
The blue eyed boy did not raise from his seat until other students began to flood out of their compartments, using his walking stick to pull himself to a stand, leaning on the compartment wall for support as he pulled his cheap black robes over himself. Disabled then. But how? Abuse more likely by the state of his garments.

“What if—“ Sherlock stuttered out in a whisper, “what if no one likes me?”
“Sherlock Holmes, I know that,” she sounded almost insulted. “But I do know you are quite the excellent actor. We need to go to meals. Study. Keep busy. And stay together.” She got quiet for a moment, leaning against the wall just high enough to lay her head on his shoulder, “We all will.”

High domed ceilings glittering with painted stars, comets shooting among the constellations. Fluffy seating areas made of thick comfortable pillows and large, soft couches scattered about various parts of the large room, with two staircases winding upward to the students rooms and lavatories. Large corners filled with highly stacked bookcases filled the majority of the room, with low lighting reflecting that time for bed was quickly upon them.
Not that it bothered him. It was perfectly normal for 13 year old boys and girls to have crushes and try to hone absolutely terrible flirting skills.
Color flooded his brother’s cheeks and he quickly ended his goodbyes and crossed the platform to board the train, making sure to exchange glances with the muggleborn boy now only a few feet away from him.
Sherlock did the same, exchanging two last, tight hugs and made his way to the train. While other young students struggled to board the train without looking back at their parents, creating a pause in the line behind them, Sherlock did not glance back at his parents.

Summary: Holmes suffers an overdose on a hot summer’s day.
“But we had an appointment,” Holmes lied.
Molly dragged her tongue up his neck. Then she bent her head and caught a glimpse of the pile of clothes on the floor, her new frock—a loud, lively, strappy harlequin-patterned thing—jumbled with his black-and-white evening wear.
Mycroft tried not to smile. “My suit.”
Jim gave him a hard stare, and then closed his eyes.
Sherlock grunted. “Well, I wanted to look at that body again. I was going to ask Molly to…”
“If needed, but he’ll probably sleep it off.”
“Your potion?”
A blue knickers is vodka, Blue Curacao liqueur, Galliano® herbal liqueur, pineapple juice, and cream.
The miniskirt was rucked up, revealing a swathe of hot pink lace strangling a half hard cock. A turn, and there was another, slightly larger swathe with the word ‘JUICY’ written in curled script.
“You were all for it. I wasn’t convinced.”
“Mm. Ex. As of, uh, twenty-seven days ago, but who’s counting. Oh, damn, damn. Sorry. I’m not, uh, not… Maybe we should call it a night...”
Was there anything more pathetic than spending Christmas Eve in a lab catching up on chemistry homework? Thank goodness the only witness to John’s shame was the bloke who was always there, gorgeous but with an intense look that said ‘don’t bother me, I’m a real scientist.’
“No! But that’s not your division!”
“Yes,” I said.
Lestrade gripped Sherlock’s hips and shifted the angle of his thrust.
“Wow. That was some kiss,” said Lestrade.
John was still sitting at the foot of Sherlock’s bed and still wearing the jumper with the scene of grinning cats, a destroyed tree, and a cheery ‘Have Yourself a Meow-y Little Christmas!”
Seb’s eyebrows rose when Holmes produced the rope and allowed the boss to tie him to one of two sets of rings, which Seb suspected were not originally intended for holding curtains.
“Miss Mary Spite, Spite, Spite, all dressed in white, white, white, with a Smith & Wesson, Wesson, Wesson, shoved up her—ah, that’s better. This is a vintage bridal gown, Seb, and when I say ‘vintage,’ I mean, it’s on unauthorised loan from the V & A museum, not, you know, bought at your cousin’s ‘shoppe’ in Chichester.”
After swallowing, Sherlock sat back on his heels. “I suggest a very quick cab ride home before your shortened refractory period expires.”
Stella slipped from under a dozing nude Sally and tiptoed to the sitting room and put the glove on. She drew out the egg once more and sighed, “Happy Easter, indeed.”
“Meet the family?” Lestrade looked like he’d rather be stuffed in a magician’s trunk and cut in half.
I took one of Holmes’s hands in both of mine and rubbed the muscles of his fingers, thumbs, palm, and wrist, applying quick, firm overlapping strokes of my thumbs.
“Yeah.”
“Big.”
“Daddy, may I have another?”
“I’m not casting aspersions on your flexibility or stamina, Gregory.”
The stranger was obviously mad.
Sitting opposite, I watched drops of sweat form and flow down the side of him.
When the front door closed, Moriarty smiled to himself.
Outwardly, he showed nothing.
is apple cider with lots of brown sugar and bourbon and vanilla and nutmeg and because it's Martha Stewart, you gotta garnish with honeyed walnuts.
“I am convalescing, but I am not an invalid!” I roared, then winced at the throb, a hideous pressure behind the eye sockets, that assaulted me. “I am not a selfish lover,” I said plaintively, my tone thick with disappointment and disgust.
“Art in the blood, Holmes?”
John slowly closed his eyes.
I shivered. “The urn which contained poor Alaric. She trapped him inside and walled him up—alive.”
“Oh, Christ, Holmes!”
“I know,” said Seb.
I fuck your mouth. I tease you until you beg. I leave you, begging.

I read the message and immediately did what I always do at such moments: drown my disappointment in the nearest book, which, in this case, was the book I’d brought for just such an eventuality. Inviting an inspector of Scotland Yard to share a convivial evening at a Turkish bath means accepting that unforeseen events may prevent him from attending.
She’s drank the sweet absinthe down while the dancing skulls fingered her clit and pussy.
“Holmes!”
Sherlock’s own prick is starting to take an interest in the proceedings, enough for Sherlock to free it and fill his cupped palm with lube. He passes the lube to John after John has peeled off his own vest.
“How’s that?”
It had been quite a while since I’d performed the act, but I’d prepared myself, physically and mentally, for it.
“Your place has a study, of course, it does. What if I told you, hold on, that I was in the bedroom with my hand down my pants thinking about your waistcoat?”
A head cocked to one side. And Mycroft recognised clothes as those of a bundle he’d stumbled upon while trailing Cossington. Thinking that they were Cossington’s and that he might return for them, Mycroft had left them in their waterproof bag where he’d found them.
He tried not to think too hard on that bit.
Going round and round in circles colored of green, red and blue. He had immediately dismissed Hufflepuff, although it would be quite funny. The hat dismissed it as well. After a length of time, Gryffindor was finally tossed out of the ring as well; while he had qualities of bravery he held no love for boisterous or loud hooping. He now wrestled between the green and the blue. While his cunning would take him far in Slytherin House, the hat ultimately yelled RAVENCLAW in a rather exasperated state. He did like the color blue and as far as the house goes, he enjoyed nothing more than a nice puzzle.
“How are you Crofty? Didn’t spend too much time in the mirror this summer I hope?”
He was pulled suddenly out of his studies as if the book lifted on its own accord and flew across the room. It landed hapadzadly on the floor, along with his journal and pen.  Sherlock looked up quickly, a clear sulk forming on his sharp face, already losing the rounding quality of boyhood. “Mum! I wasn’t done! You have lost my page!” The last bit came out as a whine but he didn’t quite care.
He did so not out of kindness entirely, but purpose. He intended to make an ally of this brilliant girl— if nothing but for the entire reason that it would very likely make his school experience less dull, not to mention she would be able to give him first hand accounts of muggle life.
It was breathtaking. The sheer magnitude of it all. Towers among towers that reached so high, out of sight into the clear night sky. Giant windows filled with warmth and light reflecting its magnificence onto the black lake below the boats. Sherlock stared at that reflection— the shimmering visage of the castle before him, the night stars and moon shifting on the serene waters below him.
As always, his mother had saved the best for last— Flourish and Blotts. Sherlock had spent the entire day nearly silent, observing Hermione as she rambled on with questions about what was in front of her, which she quickly answered for herself with nearly no help at all. When he finally reached his favorite store, the pair of them quickly tucked away in isles and isles of books while his mother arranged for their school text books to be brought together. She was truly in her element— the Granger’s appeared much more comfortable after his mother’s  skillful and kind introductions to their daughter’s new world and was asking tons of questions about nearly everything they see. While they did not catch on nearly as quickly as Hermione, it was easy to see her lineage did not lack in intellect.
Just as he had suspected.
“I suppose I’m more shocked at the choice. Muggleborn and a quidditch player at that? Not your usual taste I must admit.”
The cabby came to a halt in front of the station far too soon for Sherlock’s liking, but there was very little time to dawdle about. Running quickly to that very familiar barrier between platform 9 and 10 the four Holmes’ ran at the barrier at full speed, going one at a time. With his father and brother already across, his mother pushed him forward at a quick run toward the barrier and suddenly the muggle station painted in colors of grey melted away into a shock of color.
He was a rather stocky fellow, of average height but an obvious well toned body trained by sports, beater perhaps? His hair color was rather odd— mostly dark brown, but speckled with light streaks of gray, uncommon for such a young age. Dressed in a plain white shirt, well pressed jeans, bright red well made muggle sneakers and what appeared to be a necklace of some sort hanging underneath his shirt, the boy was obviously muggle. Well dressed indicating he had a family of decent means. He stands nearly at attention— military family then. Parents divorced, probably. His clothes were well made and he was clearly taken care of, but had no family in sight.  Father supports his son but due to military employment he cannot physically be here. Only child.
Piling out of the carriage and flowing into the welcoming warmth of the Great Hall, Gregory only stopped for a moment, meeting his eyes briefly with an understanding nod before he made his way over to the Gryffindor table to join Oliver Wood and his other mates on the Quidditch team. It was in that simple nod that Gregory knew what was asked of him. In moments where the oldest Holmes would not be available to keep Irene as far from his brother as possible, Gregory understood he was to play the game of cat and mouse— Irene being the cat of course. While Sherlock was an obvious interest of her’s after his slip up, she could never resist playing with Gregory.
At least to their parents. They might not know it but he was not the only Holmes boy fascinated by muggle studies— he was just the only one open about it.
at the meal table! You should feel lucky that I allow you to even have those writing instruments! How will you write with quill when you go to Hogwarts? It’s quite different.”
The hat had shouted GRYFFINDOR nearly as soon as the top hit his head. The name, John Watson lingered in his mind for the remainder of the opening feast. The last boy to be sorted was a tall and rather lanky boy by the name of Ronald Wesley, who was just as quickly sorted into the red. But still he watched the Watson boy with an interest he didn’t understand— at all. He had sat himself near the middle of the table, close to where the boy that Mycroft obviously knew was. He was as quiet as before, giving polite nods and small smiles to those who congratulated him on his sorting, but all together seemed to phase out his fellow students, and instead focused on Professor Dumbledore’s speech.
he stopped for a moment, his gaze turning toward the window, the rain falling was starting to turn to cracked ice. “I will never be able to do that I am afraid.”
Even the hat seemed to have grown tired of it.
The rest of breakfast went quietly, with the occasional praise of Mycroft's progress in his studies. There was the question— well rather more a statement — of when his own letter would come in and of course, what house would he be sorted into. Sherlock’s answer was the same as always.
“You’re forgiven on all counts, John, especially the last.” Sherlock grimaced. “I don’t think anyone is ready for those.”
“Rot in hell, Sister!”

After the job, he’d find her and, well, do whatever she’d like, but he hoped it involved his prick doing its best imitation of that dildo!
“Twice.”
“Yes, it seemed to amuse everyone.”
“God, he’s good,” moaned Molly, throwing her head back against Sherlock’s shoulders. She opened her eyes and read the longing in Sherlock’s gaze.
Holmes was sweating by the time he took up the first saucer. He began divesting himself of clothing as he hopped and spun.
“Well,” I said, looking down at my swaddled form, “we could retire for the evening and you could fuss about me in much the fashion of a proud rooster, or perhaps an arrogant cock?”
John brought the cup to Lestrade’s lips and tipped it carefully.
“So you do remember.”
“I’ve a sudden craving for second hand pumpkin spice.”

“Yeah, that, too,” said John as she buried her nose in Sherlock’s hair. “Christ, you smell good. Hey, I think I see a pair of ghosts on the ceiling.”
“Sorry, Molly.”
“I bake my own ginger nuts.”
“No, Watson, for the hundredth time, I had no idea when I agreed to accompany you to that,” he coughed pointedly, “celebration of bucolic charms that we would become entangled in so macabre a case.”
“Poor Marnie Evans. She was denied her one vocation of becoming a sculptress—”
John deeply regretted the decision to walk home from Lestrade’s local. Too many pints, too many streets between his bladder and Baker Street. He wondered if Lestrade (or Mycroft) would be able to get him off a potential charge for public urination.
Watson raised an inquiring eyebrow.
“Okay. I know I said it before but ‘thank you.’ That was good.”
“Strawberry and rhubarb,” answered Watson.
Holmes!
“Twice, thrice weekly treatments. More or less as the work fluctuates. My card is in my coat. I shall retrieve it when I’ve…”
“Lung disorder? Tobacco’s pall.”
Seb turned pale. Jim’s eyes widened.
“I’m not clever like you and Sherlock.”
Jim covered Seb’s gun hand with his and brought the tip of the gun to his own temple.
“Cock.”
“I abhor assumptions, John. It’s a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. And we will position ourselves for your pleasure alone.”
Sherlock can only nod.
Pairing: Holmes/Watson
Sherlock quivered at John’s touch, at her murmur.
“You might be a poet, Watson.”
“But surely you have something in mind, Detective Inspector.”
“How?”
“Give us a show, sexy,” said Irene.
“What’s that?” asked Jim, rushing toward the window clad in only pants.
She walks to the window, peeks around the curtain, and looks down. One corner of her mouth lifts.
“Sherlock, that place is huge and rapidly reaching capacity. I thought we agreed it would be better to station ourselves at the entrances and catch Evans when he arrived.”
From an artistic perspective, there was a kind of symmetry to my third stumbling be so close in nature to my first, but I vowed on that lofty pinnacle that it would be, above all, be my last. I had grown weary of being the hunted, even the balm of my Watson’s presence could not wholly assuage me. At the nearest opportunity, I would turn and face my pursuer.
“Cheers,” replied Sherlock and John, and each drained his flute.
“Your brother begs to differ. I’m to make certain you don’t get into trouble and that you are on board for the first crossing at Dover tomorrow morning. After that, you can do as you wish. Dive in and swim the English Channel for all I care! I’ll be very well compensated if I meet your brother’s terms, which fortunately do not specify how many pieces that you’re in when I settle you on that boat! Do you understand me?”
As August crawled closer and closer to September, his parents began to act a bit odd— more than the usual. Any time he would enter the room his mother would kiss him gently, wiping tears from her eyes in such a way that she was nearly pretending they weren't there at all. She and father both had even began to stop his homework all together and began to give his muggle books back (although he was still stuck with quill and parchment.)
introduction, but seems rather pleased. “Hermione. Muggleborn is a rather new term for me but I assume it is those born from families without magic yes? And you would be born from a family with magic? Lovely to meet you! It is surprising that you would choose to study physics when you have such
He ran his long pale fingers through his rather tamed black curls— surprising compared to the state of the rest of him. His dress pants were wrinkled terribly. His white button up crumpled and only partially buttoned, his bare feet resting on the warm stone wall across from his perch. That’s what he liked about Draco’s quarters. His window seals were just wide enough that he could quite comfortably fit between the walls and watch the world below him. It had been the deciding factor when he had chosen his room to cramp up in rather than his own.
“Odd, I didn’t imagine you capable of having actual friends Mycroft,” he muttered to his brother as they exchanged their final goodbye to their parents.
Finally a verdict of GRYFFINDOR was announced and the shouts from the red table bounded even higher than before and they continued through the throngs of other students— several sorted into Slytherin, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff in equal measures. It was when the boy with the slight limp— the boy with deep blue eyes, stiffly pulled his way on top of the stool Sherlock found himself fixated like a magnet.
Now that had shaken him into tears. Worse— it had shaken him to standing at Mycroft’s  bedroom door. Mycroft has actually had the gall to laugh at his confusion. He truly was boggled by the outpouring of sadness and affection— indulging his rather taboo fascination with muggles. His mother had even sat down and explained several different encounters or muggle customs she had learned about through her work at the ministry— something she had never done before.
The fact alone made him quite nervous and he couldn’t understand it at all. With all the homework, studying, and absolute glee that had followed his letter he had no reason to assume that would change at all. He has been told his entire life that Hogwarts would be the best years of his life. His father had been so distraught that half way into August, as he was skimming through a rather long letter from Hermione written on parchment(the girl does commit doesn’t she) that he even gave his journal and pens back, with added extension charms so they would never run out of paper or ink.
“Brother mine,” Mycroft said in a quite conceited tone,parting his auburn hair, his watery grey eyes focused on the mirror before him, “it’s so simple why you should be able to nearly deduce this yourself.”
Mycroft turned back to the mirror in a quick fashion, combing his hair, but not managing to control the slight curl at the ends that framed his face.
On his way back to his room, loneliness began to sink in as it never had before. He had no friends— he was never the type to really socialize. And without Father, Mother, or the necessities of meals to force Mycroft to speak to him, he would have no one.
He was truly stumped by this. They had not planned this. The opposite actually, so her very spur of the moment decision to indulge his obsession took him by surprise .
That was one of the numerous reasons why he enjoyed her presence so much. Hermione could truly appreciate the beauty of the muggle world; it’s arts, sciences, mathematics. How they constructed their world with great effort while in his own, he only had to wave a wand, muttering a few words. Well words only if it was truly a difficult spell really.
He was about to find out.
“Wonder” he said with a grin, “is entirely based on the perspective of the person. I find wonder in how your people create to fill the void that magic has left. With fascinating intellect and creativity. There is always wonder in the unknown.”
Diagon Alley, per usual for this time of year, was full of completely bumbling idiots. He much more likes coming in the dead of winter; the crisp, cold air, hot mugs of cocoa in the nearly bare Leaky Caldron and all the time in the world to peruse through books. As his birthday was nicely tucked into November, it was always his requested birthday treat— that and a trip to muggle London for some more fascinating books.
“Sherlock?”
Eurus had been packed in the back along with the rest of his belongings, a decision he was regretting the longer the ride went. He had brought a book concerning mathematics with him but it was difficult to focus on the train. While his compartment was now dead silent, the rumble of the train and the excited conversation from other compartments hardly made it a quiet ride.
He rather liked that.
Mycroft snorted at that so loudly Anthea actually jumped. “I doubt that,” he laughed, turning away from the boats to focus on his companions. “It will be the longest one yet.”
His mother and father helped the pair load their things onto the train, Mycroft’s eyes still steadily scanning the throng of students until, just as the train blew a quick whistle indicating for students to board, it finally landed on someone.
Until today it seems.
The bright red Hogwarts Express shined brightly under the rather rare and beautiful London sun. Several older students bustled around the platform, already dawning the appropriate house colors, while other new students like himself, dressed in varying degrees of attire with an air of nervousness that betrayed their year. His mother had pulled their trollies and returned them to normal size, Eurus squawking loudly in offense of the transfiguration she had undergone. Her loud protests drew no unwanted eyes; everyone was too busy either hugging friends in delight of a new school year, or holding onto parents with wet, tear stained faces.
Turning around without a word, he saw a small, bushy headed girl, fumbling nervously with apologies — Muggleborn obviously by the look of it. She was so totally enraptured by the magic of it all that she has completely lost focus on reality and nearly knocked him off his feet. The moment she realized her error he watched as her honey eyes shifted back into focus and a bit of panic filled them.
Nearing the back of the train, Sherlock spotted a nearly empty compartment-- one that held a familiar face. Hermione sat adjacent to two rather quiet boys. The one closest to the door was quite chubby, with flat, straight hair almost plastered to the top of his head, round chubby cheeks and had a nervous flush to his face. He was speaking in mumbles and stutters at Hermione-- clearly not used to conversing with people his own age.  The boy closest to the window was ignoring the pair all together, his back to the door, staring rather solemnly out the window in complete silence.
“Irene,” his voice was short with an undercurrent of warning “he will not be another toy to you. Leave Sherlock to his own trouble making.”
“You are stronger than this Sherlock. We both are.” Her voice was stronger at that, that Gryffindor shining through brightly. It made him smile, despite the tears. It had been a long time since he had smiled in earnest.
His announcement was met with more relief than excitement. His eyes fell on his brother sitting at the near end of the Slytherin table, who only gave him the slightest of nods before returning his attention to the Sorting. A short, meak girl by the name of Molly Hooper was next and was quickly sorted into Hufflepuff, blushing during the entire round of applause.
“That,” he took a pause to swing away from the mirror, dressed in smart grey dress slacks and a black button up collared shirt, only one button undone showing the tiniest of a gold chain hung around his neck, no pendent visible from underneath the shirt. “is the entire point! This isn’t about logic, it’s about feeling. Their youngest child will soon be off to Hogwarts. While we are there,  the nest is emptied. Before when I went to school you were still here to tend too. Now there will be no one during our months at school. It is a new chapter in their lives. Yours too. Have you ever stopped to think in all of your moaning with that muggle obsession of yours that you will not see them again until Christmas Holidays?”
“Mycroft please don’t chide me,” he nearly growled, “I don’t understand it at all, it's just not logical.”
Sherlock did not get to lean out of the train and wave goodbye as the train began to lurch forward. Being one of the last students to board the train, he had the rather frustrating job of attempting to find an empty compartment. Compartment after compartment, faces and colors blended together. He briefly noticed his brother in a compartment nearly full of fellow Slytherins-- the muggleborn boy now sporting a Gryffindor tie and partially wearing his school uniform to his brother’s left. The boy rarely spoke to anyone else in the compartment. For the most part he looked rather awkward, quietly perusing through what appeared to be a muggle comic book. Only there for Mycroft then. His brother caught his visage as he passed the compartment but he did not give Sherlock even the slightest of nods.
She may be the only companion he would have in the coming weeks.
She was brilliant— nearly at his level of not so. Very sharp witted and completely fascinated by the unknown. In learning the unknown. This girl— she would wring every droplet of knowledge that she could find in this world.
broom. To their surprise— and disappointment— he had left it lying on the ground and walked away. He may have asked “what’s this rubbish?”
Soon the thoughts of blue and walking sticks faded from his mind entirely as he stared up at the magnificent castle in the distant. While the older students packed into carriages, pulled invisibly up the hill toward the school, first year students like himself were directed to a large series of time worn, wooden boats floating sirenly atop the mirror sheen of the lake. Loading onto the boats was a task considering the number of students itself— but the caretaker by the name of Hagrid did a decent job of overseeing the task. His parents had warned him about Hagrid—nice fellow, half giant. A bit oafish but a good heart nevertheless.
“Alright alright,” he sighed, “but start again, from the top.”
No it didn’t bother him.
As standing in line for access to their vault—why Mother insisted him to drag along for this boring bit was beyond him— he was suddenly jolted out of his thoughts by a bump from behind, so hard it nearly knocked him to the floor!
It was well into mid morning hours by the time his mother had dragged him— yes quite literally
He didn’t answer her, he only shifted his head against the window looking at her in the most raw way he had ever been. He didn’t bother stopping the tears.
“Will you come to supper with us tonight?” She asked, eyebrows raised.
——————————————————————
The boy’s eyes had not moved from their focus on what laid beyond the window, the expression on his face quite saddening. As if he had lost something more important than a toad.
Nevertheless the hat took a bit on the blond boy’s head, moving and muttering until RAVENCLAW was shouted from its lips. The Malfoy boy seemed to be so shocked by the announcement that the Professor nearly had to lift him from the stool and guide him to the table.
Pens were so much better. You didn’t even have to dip them. How is that fact alone not magical?
The rest of the dinner was consumed by the clatter of cutlery against fine plates and the smells of absolutely divine food. He actually ate several handfuls of what seemed to be game pie, followed by a delightful orange and raspberry pudding. It was the Malfoy boy who did not eat. He barely managed to notice the food— let alone the cake. And his fellow students didn’t bother to nudge him out of his stupor. It was only after a fifth year prefect named Philip Anderson instructed them out of the dining hall and up a winding stairway into one of the topmost towers of the castle that the boy seemed to be aware of his surroundings. Well, partially. A very flighty and whimsical girl named Luna, with long blonde hair and pale skin seemed to take the job of Malfoy’s care up the stairs and into the common room upon herself.
As the first person his age that actually held a drop of decent intelligence he was rather fascinated by her and desired further study into her behavior. The rest of the day passed quickly—
And the last, but certainly not least, was the expectations laid at his feet. Full marks, perfect behavior,
They were rather hungry.
The typical ritual of the sorting began immediately, a fairly even number of new students being sorted into all four houses. His brother’s bushy haired companion, named Hermione Granger took a few moments before the House loudly shouted out GRYFFINDOR and the typical hooting and shouting from the table followed. Nearly immediately his brother’s name was called, following hushed whispers from his own table, and expectant glanced toward him.
He had to keep moving forward. A new chapter.
“Whatever I wish I suppose. Like a
“Sherlock you have to eat,” her voice was tinged with a plea, plopping the book down onto the bed with slight bounce. She moved over to him, bringing a warm cup of tea and a plate of sweetbread. She stood in front of him thrusting the plate of bread into his lap. “You are wasting away. You can’t let yourself starve.”
around you!”
Gregory gave him a look of disapproval but said nothing as they moved further up in the line. One of Gregory’s fellow Gryffindor’s, a short, curly haired girl named Sally waved at him from the front of the line. Gregory gave the slightest of waves back before focusing back on Mycroft in a comfortable silence. Mycroft kept an eye on the girl who kept looking back at Gregory with a blush as she turned back to her girlfriends in giggles. She likes him and he is completely oblivious of the fact. Fascinating.
(See the end of the chapter for
It had perhaps been the only highlight as July bled into August. His father and mother both had confiscated all of his muggle books, pens and journals and locked them away with enchantments he couldn’t possibly break now that he had received his letter (what a ridiculous law). They had set him at a harsh pace of studying all of his books and assigning homework. Homework!!  It was a month until school and he was writing an essay on the importance of a bezoar in most common poison antidotes. After he completed his assigned tasks he was allowed his choice of one— yes one— muggle book but any notes must be made with quill and parchment.
On the morning of September 1st his parents, for once in his life, was not nearly as nervous as he was. Truly the idea of going to Hogwarts frightening him. A forgein place, with no companions. What if he didn’t find his space where he belonged? What if he was truly the outcast? The “freak” other children would call him at the parties his mother and father would attend. Seven years of solitude— of being totally completely alone shook him a bit. While he had always felt a bit “alone” was he ever truly?

“That’s me.”
Jim Moriarty/Molly. Menstrual kink.
A warm smile and a beckoning wave through the glass office wall dispelled Mycroft’s mounting fears.
“A couple dozen, you mean,” said John.

Sherlock came and collapsed atop John, sending them both to the ground.

When she’d bottomed out, she kissed him and said in a low voice, “I see you’re a virgin.”
John is tucked between them, as he should be. They are both watching over him, as is their habit, even when no danger threatens.
Then he noticed, once more, the tiny whiff of perfume or cosmetic or something and was drawn back into his present reality.
I exhaled and shook my head. “Well, that wasn’t what I remembered. And now what are we going to do with the corset?”
“Who?”
The elements were all there, flavours, strong and subtle, forming a divinely-inspired whole, much like a stained-glass window in a centuries-old church, and the comparison was apt, for much like many ecclesiastical matters, the ritual was almost as delicious as the adornment.
John grinned. “Yeah, I also got a mouth that waters at the sight of you.” He bent low and took Sherlock’s nipple in his mouth, running his wide, flat tongue back and forth over it, then swirling the tip of his tongue ‘round the edges and flicking it. Then he pressed his mouth to the whole area and sucked.
A white bird with a long neck and a very cross expression on its face.
“Second rule, the only thing you suck on is Daddy’s lolly.”
“Christ,” slurred John. “Long Island Iced Tea’s not like Tippy Assam.”
“I can’t imagine ever growing tired of this—oh, oh!”
She reached down and ran a flat hand from his cock over his stomach to his chest, then turned her hand and slid it up, curling it around his neck until she could sink her fingers into his hair. Then, she gripped him hard by the roots at his scalp, pulling his head back, and pressed her lips to his in a rough, biting kiss.
“This is war.”
Being distracted by nature was never supposed to have such serious repercussions!
“In here!”
“A man of words, eh? So am I, these days. A legacy, in its own way.”
He shook his head and looked away. “You cannot possibly feel as I do.”
As I ate, I noticed on the interior of the brown was scratched a message in a familiar code of dancing men. It read:
“There’s a space on one side. It looks as if a photograph removed. But is that significant?”
Then he was presented with a very erect, very human cock, which he sucked with abandon.
“Drink. My gran’s recipe.”
After about twenty minutes, Sherlock said, with some finality, “Thank you, John.”
Soon, he was sitting up. “Sweet as sugar,” he remarked after swallowing a bitter mouthful.
“What would you grow?” persisted Holmes.
A/N: for the Holmes Minor November prompt: family.
Sherlock took the puzzle. He stared at it for a long time, in which Mycroft’s anticipation grew. Then he looked up at Mycroft and asked,
I pressed my body tighter to Holmes’s and began to kiss and bite his neck and shoulders in earnest. My fingers toyed with his nipples.
“Uh, excuse me, miss?”
John turned again.
Janine drew back, but Mary chased her mouth and kissed her hard once more.
A hard, possessive hand ran down his spine, between his cheeks, and found the plug.
Sherlock shrugged. “Does it help that I only narrowed it down to three possibilities?”
The three men’s heads turned toward the door where Mrs. Hudson stood.
“She strangled her sister-in-law and then moulded a mask round her face and arranged her in the Peter, Peter tableau.”
John put two fingers under Lestrade’s chin, lifting it, then kissing her lips hard.
“Yes, sir!”
“It is kind of cosy in here, but, yes.”
“Holy fuck!”
about wedding bracelets that look like handcuffs.
Stamford stopped before a large window.
‘Jim, will you fix it for me? My pussy’s so empty. It’s not been fucked for ages.”
I cleared my throat.
John nodded. “All right. I’m in.”
“Thank you for rescuing me, Doctor.”
Sally grinned. “Best kind.”
“There is, apparently,” said Seb, sliding off Molly.
Sherlock sipped. “Like you. Strong. Slightly sweet. You were good today, with the victim’s family.”
I am hungry.
Well, sort of.
Stella smirked and carried her into the bedroom.
“Fancy a dry place for the night, love?”
At once, Lestrade was on his back with Mycroft straddling his head. Mycroft bounced and made high-pitched noises.
A cloud of yellow smoke appeared, then disappeared.
“Wonderful,” said Mycroft. “I’ll be hoovering it out of the car until Christmas.”
in which 221 is egged by young vandals just as Sherlock moves in and Mrs. Hudson calls the Men in Kilts cleaning service to help clean up the damage.
I set my reading aside.
Mycroft pushed away from his desk and stood and went to the far cabinet. A key, a lock, a twist and turn later and he was allowing the first draught of whiskey to warm his throat.
Sherlock twisted as he slammed into John. John’s pleasure spiked. He cried out and spilled into his own hand.
“Let me fuck that sweet arse of yours.”
“Yeah. Want to die today?”
“Not as well.”
“It’ll do. Can’t wait."
“Okay,” concedes Seb. “You’ll keep watch?”
He will be alive, that is all I vow. I would not enjoy a single breath free from anguish knowing I led him to an early death. And what of his anguish?
Sherlock nodded then he looked down and found sometime, unknown to him, he had taken John’s hand in his and was squeezing it. He quickly released it.
The door to Lestrade’s flat had barely shut before he was shoving Sherlock against the wall and kissing him. He pushed away from Sherlock roughly.
And the other is so enchanted, so charmed, so spellbound, that he stops and stares.
Mycroft took a deep breath, then asked politely,
“’Go away, Sherlock! I don’t want you to see me like this!’ I inhale your manly—“
Dear Reader, someone else beat him to it.
“Bellinis already?”
Irene led her to the dance floor. It was late. Couples were already fondling and groping.

“You.”

Sally’s hand snaked out from the duvet. “I want to show you something.” She tapped the screen with her thumb. “You like pretty things.”
“Hospital?”
Watson, not legion of Watsons.”
“Oh Lord,” I grumbled. I looked over my shoulder, but, of course, the maid had disappeared.
Seb’s far and away the best-looking person in the room; he looks like James Bond ought to look.
Moriarty threw off the bedclothes and sat up, swinging his feet to the floor and slipping off his drawers. Then the figure was kneeling before him, dragging his tongue from base to head, then teasing along the weeping slit.
“My brain is housed in a body that has the same universal human needs.”
Doghouse Reilly.
“I must’ve been a very good boy this year,” he murmured, straining against the straps to meet the alien’s grasp. His eyes closed and his mouth opened at the first touch of tentacles to cock. Then he exhaled loudly and relaxed into the stroking and tugging, pumping and pulling, as the creature wrung every drop of pleasure from his body.
Then he spat on his palm and pumped his cock with violent jerks, splattering Mycroft’s face with come.
Baker Street. John was mounting Sherlock—
“I’m there, love. I’m there. FUCK!”
Mrs. Hudson’s brow crinkled. “Pajamas?” she echoed, disliking the way the word bounced on her tongue.
‘What now?’ I daren’t contemplate, not yet, so I chose the easier question,
I suppose it might have been likened an avalanche of rock or snow.
“Yeah, but he double-crossed me, too, didn’t he? And he’s still walking around.”
“Right ho! I’m off! Tailor’s, you know. Pip, pip!” cried the youth.
“That’s enough, Aesop. Sir, I mean. Now, at nine-thirty you have…”
First, as always, Toby, sleeping the sleep of the just.
“Rather narrow of you, I think,
John made tea. Tea was essential, but it also presented a problem. To make tea, John had to leave Sherlock in the bedroom. He didn’t like leaving Sherlock in the bedroom. However illogical, it felt like abandonment.
I was horribly uncertain of my decision up until the moment she opened the door.
It was a very familiar, very autumnal whiff.
“Naughty sleuths who don’t tell their boyfriends it’s their birthday get a very naughty teasing before they’re allowed to come.”
“Indeed, who could resist nature’s lure on such a fine spring day? No cares, no demands on my time, in a secret garden, of all places. A bit of childlike behavior might be excused, mightn’t it?”
Yes, I’d stumbled. I needed sanctuary.
“I mean, coffee, with a bit of my Irish in it,” said Moriarty, grinning and nodding at his own prick.
“I read it. I liked it. I think I even understood it. May I?” He made a gesture to the space beside Lomax.
“We break into the Tower of London so that you can get a blowjob? That’s mad? You’re high, Boss.”
‘WHAT THE FUCK?’ mouthed Seb.
“The dust…”
“Congratulations, Detective Inspector.”
“G’night, John.”
And realised that loins were not my most burning problem.
It said so quietly, so softly, it’s almost swallowed up by the noise of their bodies shifting on the bed.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“You’re ridiculous.”
The green fairy said nothing.
Lestrade nodded. “Sounds good. For now, sit back close your eyes, and enjoy the show.”
“A stinkin’ large cock,” replied Mycroft crudely.
“See?”
good. Some of my colleagues at the bar will sleep better knowing Chester is never coming back.”
Our heads turned toward the window. Daybreak was spilling in.
“What question? You know all the answers!”
“And you didn’t think it worthwhile to mention?!”
Molly frowned, went to the door, looked through the peep hole, and smiled.
Molly gulped the last of her Christmas Cosmo, set up the camera, and tested it on a sleeping Toby.
Far too many leaves on the rose bed.
Or one drink too many, the kind that only make their strength know when John tries to stand up. And falls.
Bessie the housemaid is invited to tea at 221B.
I have divine poet.
“Mister Holmes has already left?”
“Where?”
“Christ, you are a romantic, aren’t you, sweetheart?” breathed Moriarty. “All right, after our date, why don’t you come up for coffee?” He looked over his shoulder, pointing, if it were possible, which, of course it was, with his eyebrows.
“How do you think I arrived at the magic number of 70%?”
“Yes?”
He made an inquiring noise as he stroked her hair.
John walked slowly towards Sherlock. His voice dropped to a purr. “I suppose they have more charm when they’re worn.”
I sat on the sofa, directly in front of one of a pair of large electric fans. The fan’s twin was in Sherlock’s bedroom. I assumed that he, like I, was down to his pants and in a semi-mesmerised state from the loud hum of the machine and the whirring of the blades.
“I want more.”
“Course in medicine was tough—”
She got her first clue when a grave-looking Sherlock stopped by the morgue unexpectedly to tell her that what he needed most was her.
“I’m not sorry at all. Turn around in my lap. Let me play with you until we arrive home.”
“Miss Plenderleith was reckless to take those photographs. To keep them. Anyone with any

“As we always do. Now, wake up!”

Moriarty turned and bent and spread his cheeks.
“I’m not got to strike you with a paddle or a crop or a cricket bat or any other posh accessory or implement. My hand is good enough. In fact, it’s the only thing I’d use!”
There was a carefully-wrapped bottle in her lap. It was Thursday, the day that she and Martha would put the final stiches to their quilt.
For the DW H/C comment fest on sholio's journal. The prompt was hot chocolate with whipped cream and sprinkles.
“Oh, god!” groans John, leaning back against Sherlock as the fingers inside him plunge deeper and find what they were looking for.
Holmes said nothing. He thought of cocaine. He thought of opium. But he suspected, or rather he feared, that those substances would only amplify and make more grotesque his monster.
Watson sat.
“Too bad that you’re not going to get it. At the last second, I was outbid.”
“Tell me about it,” said Sherlock dryly.
He wished he could sit down with a pint and a shot and tell someone, someone who might understand, maybe that Watson fellow, what a marvel, nothing short of a bloody miracle, it was to see the flicker in Jim’s eyes when he ceased to be Moriarty, world’s only consulting criminal, spider at the centre of a web.
“The seedier side of things, but essential for a Hallowe’en orgy.”
hot.” Jim frowned and put his hands on his hips and turned in the direction of the loo. He scratched his head. “So what are we going to do?”
Well, of course, he’d sing about love! Most of the songs ever written, and thus ever sung, dealt with nothing else!
“Sounds perfect.”
Yes, yes, and yes.
“Now that’s a fine-looking piece cambric, Doctor,” observed Lestrade as I was wiping the rain from my face.
“Oh, Holmes.”
“Shower in, too, if you want.”
Greg’s voice softened. “Doesn’t make it any less of a fantasy because I’m laughing. I’m still your captive. You’re still going to have your wicked, otherworldly way with me.”
“I’ve got some lube in here somewhere. Bed. Clothes. Off.”
Moriarty raised an eyebrow.
The knickers were a matching shade of yellow but satin and, Lestrade reached between Mycroft’s legs, conveniently split-crotch. Lestrade rolled Mycroft’s balls round in his palm, marveling how the fabric nearly strangled Mycroft’s stiff, leaking prick.
“Gross,” said John without looking up from his notepad.
“There were some accidents. I thought I got it all off me. Obviously, I was wrong.”
Lestrade barked an address and slammed the door behind him.
“Yeah, same with Sherlock. Okay. Let’s get down to the numbers. How many?”
“Of course, I have. You saw me,” he snapped, but meekly allowed himself to be led to the bench.
He took the book of matches out of his pocket and leaned toward the stranger, who mirrored the movement.
“Harder, Sebby. More!”
And he claimed it at once.
He took a bottle of lotion from the bedside table and with greased hands began to massage her foot.
“A bit.”
“We returned to Baker Street. Tea.”
But not this time.
“You have no idea what it’s like, Mister Holmes!” cried the young thief. “To wear clothes that don’t seem right just because everybody says so.”
Mycroft still wore his dress shirt and socks, but the pink knickers were in his mouth and a dildo, oversized and dark purple in colour, was shoved neatly up his arse.
Too many pints at the local, we’ll apologise. What a bother, these aching heads!
And step by step, we divested ourselves of past. Of fear. Of pretense.
“Yeah?”
“Oh!” she cried out in mock surprise. She giggled as he bounced her. He came with a grunt.
“I like it when…”
Technically this is a songfic, not a drinkfic. The relevant lines of the 1959 song are:
“My pleasure, I assure you. Would you care to shower?”
Molly looked down. “Tap shoes?”
“Is that why you drank my piss? To keep me from going in there?”

John jumped out his own skin.
“If our schedules even allow…”
It was the way he said ‘change’ that struck Holmes; it held a meaning that Holmes could not immediately decipher, which was, in itself, a state so rare as to be gravely alarming to Holmes.
“Sherlock, how do you feel about sucking my come out of John’s hole while I suck him off?”
“Driver!”

You sigh. “My only consolation is that you must be somewhat rested. These first days we’ve been too busy and too fatigued with the unpacking for your anxiety to surface. And I’m certain that the story that the lady who runs the lending library told us yesterday contributed.”
Holmes ogled me, but he didn’t move until I’d spent.
“Yes.”
“My answer is yes.” I heard Holmes’s exhale of breath and saw relief soften his feature. “But I suppose it would be most proper if you did the honours, Holmes.”
Oh, that was it!
She watched as the pair scurried down the street.
“I don't have a self-pleasuring device because I take care of myself manually.”
I wave a hand, knowing full well that you did not.
Watson gripped the heavy sack of apples and headed downstairs with a chuckle and a mumbled jest which compared me, rather unfavourably, to a harvester’s ladder.
“Oh, oh!” Molly grabbed Seb’s shoulders and slammed her hips into him.
“Yes,” breathes Mycroft, his gaze fixed on Lestrade’s lips.
“Thank you very much, ma’am, but forgive me for asking a stupid question…?”
“A man of the world such as yourself, Watson? Why I’d be surprised if you
“Mister Holmes, can you throw no light on the situation?”
“And the reverse, sometimes, my dear Watson.”
John pulled off again and took in the buds, now pebbled, and the expanse of smooth skin and too prominent ribs. He licked back and forth between the nipples, then bit, very slowly, very gently, ‘round one.
A bubble of mirth escaped my lips at the non sequitur, then I gave it consideration.
He kissed Mycroft again and said with no little desperation, “So many times in the last few weeks, I wanted to take a photo—”
“That’s probably what they’ll call it. You really need to go. Out the window if you must.”
Holmes/Watson
“Here 'tis. I should like to hear more about this grandmother.”
“The longest.”
“And what were you doing at that lonely spot at such a late hour, Mrs—”
A tentative voice called from the makeshift waiting room.
How bleak my world seemed without Watson, how much darker those abysmal waters!
Five days on the beaches of Spain had been bliss, and now he had one more day to get things done around the flat before he had to go back to work.
Seb was still lying on the bed, looking like the debauched god he was.
“And you are rotten,” retorted Sherlock before he hurled Mycroft to the floor.
Lestrade filled the third flute on the coffee table as John clung to her. “We’ve got an audience now, Watson. You’d better make it good,” she said, licking and biting up the side of John’s neck.
Molly’s heels were digging into a dark uniform shirt with stenciled lettering, and her hips were bucking into an open mouth. Her thighs came together hard. She gave a needy little cry, then a satisfied hum, then unfolded like a flower.
Molly’s reply was a choked cry.
“Sure. Then will you read Milton to me?”
“Not the goal I had in mind, but still significant,” said Holmes.
Seb set his gun case down, then began removing his boots and socks.
“Huh?”

“Oh, yeah, I’m like a schoolboy sneaking into his first strip club,” growled Lestrade as music sounded, something by Rihanna, fast and fun, and Mycroft began to dance right in front of Lestrade’s face.
“Oh, Raffles!”
“I told you, Toby! I told you he’d drop by with breakfast.”

Breakfast was coffee for two.

He sat up abruptly. “To?”
"Piss off!"
“I don’t know, but I don’t see how you can be bored. Thinking up all those clever ways for people to die? What about that guy you struck by lightning three times last week?”
“Right. Other members of the clean-up crew might do the same when they see the distance to the nearest town. They’ll be given the option.”
“During that time, I so grieved the loss of you. It was quite painful to think of you during waking hours, so I often forced myself to forget and, perhaps, as a result, you often surfaced in my dreams, never more so than in that one.”
Jim mouthed in hair. “Ladies first.”
He shrugged charmingly and added, also charmingly, “I’m certain someone thinks so.”
“Oh.”
And so it went, too.
“I noticed that you were reading a lot about bees,” said John with a vague wave at the books piled on the floor by the foot of Sherlock’s armchair. “I saw this in a shop window and supposed you might like to, you know, try different kinds of honey. The bees get pollen from different flowers, and the honeys taste different.”
“Have you plans for Christmas?”
Mycroft drew the gold wig off as Sherlock sucked his prick. He tossed the wig to the other side of the car, then reached under Sherlock and ripped the stars off, too.
Sherlock’s eyes are doing a familiar spider-leg dance of scrutiny about John’s person, taking in his clothes, his posture, creases and wrinkles, miniscule stains, the untouched cup of PG Tips and who knows what else.
No, it wasn’t dangerous to fuck here, in plain view, amidst sturdy trunks and harvest-heavy boughs, as the autumn sun sank into the rolling hills, with John nestled beneath Sherlock and his stalwart wool coat.
“True, but—I prefer to be wholly frank with you, Gregory; I spend far too much of my waking hours doing otherwise—it was more fear.”
John smiled a tight smile. “Sherlock, I think we’d better call it a night. This place is getting too full. Even if Evans showed up, we might not spot him.”
“—is not going up your arse, Boss. I have, as you say, colossal hands. It’s not to work.”
Watson sputtered his surprise as the other froze mid-munch on the last of the winter cabbage.
“As I recall, you weren’t so bad at the luck-making business. You just had less practice than I did.”
He glanced down at the map pinned to the desk beneath a layer of hard plastic.
“Yes! Make me purr, John!”
The material seemed to be drawing ‘round him of its own accord.

“You’ll see to that, won’t you?”
“Sun-kissed.”
“Ah, ha!” called Sherlock from the bathroom. “You hid it in the drain!”

With much discomfort and more pinching, he hauled himself to sitting.

“You know, Watson, I never quite understood your whole algorithm for which of our cases you selected to make public.”
Mycroft mewled each time Sherlock brushed the sweet spot inside him, and Sherlock tested his brother’s limits, fingering him mercilessly and grinning wickedly at every plaintive noise.
“How ‘bout my mouth, John? You like them licked, sucked?”
Lestrade took another swig, not missing Mycroft’s gaze fixed on his mouth as he did so.

“I hate surprises, boss. We’re not going to see your mom again, are we? ‘Cause that graveyard shit…”
But it was all foreplay. Mycroft felt Gregory’s eyes on him. When he looked at the works in the frames, he saw Gregory’s face as he fucked Mycroft’s arse, as he came inside Mycroft, as he spread his lips round Mycroft’s cock, as he swallowed Mycroft’s come.
“The Duchess gave you that scent.” I indicated the alabaster box beside him on the rug.
“Watson?”
A finger was in his mouth, pulling him off. He let himself be guided to the other nipple. He forced himself to look up at her. Her eyes were very dark. He wondered if she was half as drunk as he was.
“Really?” Sherlock twisted his head as far as his bonds allowed. “That’s why I’m tied to a pipe beneath the Thames.”
By way of reply, John gripped Sherlock’s buttocks tightly with both hands.
“A cottage,” he said. “In Sussex. On the southern slope of the downs. View of the Channel, chalk cliffs, etcetera.”

John bent forward. Sherlock thrust up.
Moriarty jerked himself off as he spoke, ending his statement by decorating Sherlock’s face and neck with his come.
“We’re covered, Boss. Nothing’s going to happen to you. Or if it does, I go, too. Yeah? We’ll be in hell, knotted together, me jizzing all my nice, hot come up in your sweet cunt for an infernal eternity.”
“Yup. And this is the address of Jim’s tailor?”
After that, it was a matter of cleaning up and carrying away. Holmes and I watched Lestrade and his men escort Alphonse Unworthy to the door, shackled, and convey Angus Unworthy beneath a white sheet on a gurney.
Not so in winter when the nights seem to be rolled out before them like a bear hearth rug.  And when Sherlock feeds from John in winter, well, it’s a veritable twelve-course banquet.

I wring your body in order to shut down your mind.
He looked down.
Jim pulled away and sniffed derisively. “I’d be a piss poor criminal mastermind if I couldn’t do file things away for later, Seb!
“I know!” cried the hostess. “They’re a fabulous duet, right? Are you with John?”
I caught up with him and looked over his shoulder, following his downward gaze.
“Yes, wouldn’t it?” agreed he as he thrust. He came with a shout muffled by the sink of his teeth into the side of Moriarty’s neck. “And I really think it might be worth it.”
“Good. Yeah, he ought to be. I taught him everything he knows about eating pussy. And yours, love, is the sweetest in the whole bloody world.”
“He won’t let you top him, even with the prize of having his cock sucked by me while you do it.” Sherlock unbuckled Mycroft’s belt and opened his trousers.

Spilling onto Baker Street, Molly turned and returned the smile that greeted her.
“Kiss me,” whispers Mycroft.
Not we, I.
“Just a bit.”
Mycroft and Lestrade get together on National Pink Princess Day. Mystrade. First time. Oral sex. Dick pics.
But Sherlock had very much enjoyed getting manhandled. It was rare these days that John got his riled up, to the point of physically assault Sherlock.
Snake in the Grass is triple sec, gin, lemon juice, and dry vermouth.
John chuckled, and Sherlock bit his neck. “You’re a menace, you know, John?”
He put his fingers inside her and pulled out what was there.
“Water, first.”
Then Molly had been led and then turned.
“It’s hot,” said Sherlock.
“Tosser.”
“Mine,” said Mycroft.
Mycroft bought a brush to groom the fox, too.
Time to go home, thought Lestrade. Could be worse. At least he'd got a good book.
“Aren’t you going to sleep?”
“It’s your lucky day, my alien-friend. Here I am, all tied up.” Greg looked down at the straps that held his nude body fast to the table. “Like a gift under the tree or in your extraterrestrial stocking. All ready for my kiss under the cosmic mistletoe.”
First kiss on New Year's Eve. First time on Sherlock's birthday. Johnlock. Oral sex.
Then I climbed atop table and sleuth and finished the job. My prick finally found Holmes's sweet spot, the brushing of which sent him into struck-by-lightning spasms, and I finally bestowed my upmost admiration in the form of pissing streams of seed deep inside his stretched cavity.
Good.
Here's one recipe for a
“John?”
“How—?”
“What the fuck? That’s…”
Holmes slipped the forkful in his mouth and hummed. “Oh, Watson.” He chewed and swallowed with a curl of contentment on his lips. “Oranges and lemons.”
Even psychopathic international criminal masterminds wanted a cuddle once in a while.
Baked. Salted. Smoked.
“Only to one who knows where you go when you’re trying not to smoke.”
“Your body, the way it moves,” groaned Sherlock as he ran a slicked hand along his own cock.
Grodman struggled like a man in straitjacket.
They clinked glasses and sipped. Then Sally said,
That’s a good one. Takes the edge off me first, so I am not distracted by my own urges when I’m bringing you, over and over, to the brink. And you do beg so prettily.
“That’s a new one, John, you’ll have to teach me,” said Sherlock just before he disappeared back under the kilt.
One corner of Watson’s mouth lifted. “There’s plenty of time to tell tales. Let’s be off to London to collect your things and have a kip before dawn. And no running away again!”
Holmes waved him off and soldiered on.
“It was so hot,” sighed Molly. “I couldn’t help it.”
“Does it now? Well, I still need the loo, and seeing as how well we perform together in tight spaces…give me two minutes and then…”
His words pierced me like a blade. Personal matter. He was going to meet someone.
Lestrade winked. “Sure. I’m going to call you ‘Mycroft,’ like it or not.”
“And you missed the ones about the creature from beyond the moon.”
“Oh, Holmes, are we too late?”
The water that splashed back into the basin was cool, bracing, and impossibly—or so I thought—briny.
(1978)] No smut. Reference to dacryphilia but no actual dacryphilia.
Jim plucked at the satin and tulle of the turquoise skirt, then slid his hand under. He found Seb’s fingers and added two of his own.
“You’re such a good Alpha,” said John, reveling in the feel of terrycloth against damp skin.
“Come back with me, Sherlock.”
“Up.”
“Let me prepare myself.” He contorted his lips into grimaces and smiles, stretching the muscles of his face.
“You’re hard,” John observed.
“Job?”
The nude chest, and the hand that caressed it, rose and fell and Irene found herself synchronizing her breath to that of the figure, to that of the rhythm of inhale and exhale in her ear. Her own hand, mirroring that of the one above, went to her own neck.
“My parents were married, John. They still are, believe it or not. But, more importantly, I solved the case!”
Sherlock gets a parcel. John makes an assumption. Sherlock/John. Lingerie. Anal.
Mycroft smoothed a hand down the front of his suit, the suit that had been chosen from his entire wardrobe for this very moment.
“Thank you. Your signature brand of efficiency is sorely lacking here. Anything else require my attention?”
Seb’s grinned around Jim’s cock, then resumed sucking.
I hardly expected a frank reply, but one came.
And that was all he would say on the subject.
Lestrade ended up sitting on the edge of the bed with John kneeling between his legs.
That a most observant detective had failed to realise that he was himself being observed said everything about the situation.
He was a Greek god. Not the young ones, the pretty ones, the foolish ones.
“How did you get me out of there?” asked Jim.
Lomax laughed.
“Of course,” murmured Watson, gazing at the empty table.

I had initially balked at Lestrade’s orders, despite his uncharacteristic pleading tone, but it had proved much simpler than anticipated to remove the trunk without being observed, mostly because everyone else had been about their own business, saving their skin, putting out fires as well as sorting through the crowd for possible, and certain, criminals.
This was the incision.
“I assure you, sir, my vision is perfect.”
Hot, hot, searing streams of come filled John. Startled, he cried out.
“You know this wool is coarse, nasty, rough stuff.”
“Now isn’t that precious?” remarked Lestrade, looking down at the starfish design in the foam. He took a first sip. “That’s much better. So, Mister Holmes, what brings you to Brighton?”
“Do it again,” urged John.
“Yes! Oh, God. It’s perfect. Please, love, don’t stop!” He felt Mycroft’s hands running up and down his back as he thrust. “Your touch, so cool. Lovely.”
Holmes sat at the kitchen table, quietly drinking evening tea and not reading the card for a fourth time.
Lestrade looked up.
“I met him in Spain a few years ago.”
For 2019 Merry Month of Masturbation.
No, he wasn’t surprised when the terms of bet included the loser wearing a pair of felt antlers and being strapped to a breeding stand.
The dancefloor had become a sea of half-faces. The masks had glowed.
Such display of uncharacteristic anxiety, not to mention lack of erudition, had me even more puzzled.
“To second chances,” said Holmes.
“But while London is drinking their tea black, Mrs. Hudson is doing wonders with honey.”
John gave him a thoughtful look. “I might be out of line here, Sherlock, but as much as I like my jumper I think it’s a shame you lost the mistletoe hat.”
“Oh, yes,” I replied with good-natured mockery, “Father Christmas shows up and all the good little vampires get oranges and walnuts in their stockings! No, Holmes, we don’t exchange gifts. To be frank, we don’t really like each other that much.”
Irene sat up and squinted, then shielded her eyes with her hand.
“Oh, Mycroft.”
The hands on her waist gripped her tight, and he groaned as she pushed back against his thrusts.
“Yes,” admitted Mycroft.

“I especially liked the part with the hundred Saint Nicholas,” Seb added.
A Nightingale is vodka, apple schnapps, sour mix, sugar, water, and lemon juice. It sounds very trashy for such a classy name.
Seb smiled to himself. He curled his arms tighter round Jim in the manner of a constrictor.
The cold October night was refreshing after an evening at bedside in an overheated sickroom. The hour was evenly distanced between midnight and dawn. The Sussex countryside was bathed in darkness, but the diamond-dusted firmament was a wonder to behold, and I took a moment to let Barabbas set the course and drink in the starry spectacle overhead.
“I may need another visit from your filthy mole before the night’s over.”
“I’m going to, gorgeous, just give me a minute. I want to savour it. Jesus fucking Christ, Sherlock. You’re taking my cock so well. I’m going to—“
A blue moon is crème de violette and gin and lemon juice.
“Here’s your thermos flask,” said Lestrade as he slid into the vehicle.

“Who says?”
“Yes, Violet, you may leave. I expect that was the last of the lot for the day.”
Seb knows what he did when he found him, judging by the wave of coppery air hitting Seb’s battered olfactory system.
“Like a sausage!” I gasped.
Cup of coffee.
“I’ll say that bastard’s name in hell!”
“A concept easily illustrated. So, John?”
“What say you to an afternoon ramble, Watson?”
Sherlock watches John & Lestrade. All gender/cisswap. John/Lestrade/Sherlock.
In a Star Trek-esque world, Lestrade and Mystrade find themselves with a shared secret. AU. Masturbation.
John licked Sherlock’s cock until they were both hard. Sherlock came; John licked him clean.
It was a half-wall John decided, but he was sort of leaning on the top of it, but he didn’t have time to think much because there was a soft snick, a sort of perfumed smell in the air, a moment of silence and then…
Watson and Holmes spend January 1895 in southern Italy.
I would make the air for all sweeter, even if it cost me my own breath.
“Oh, sod off. It’s
“You know how it’s never twins? Well, it’s never, ever triplets.”
They locked eyes for a long minute, then John said,
Mycroft sighed resignedly. “Yes.”
“There are old mycologists and there are bold mycologists, but there are no old, bold mycologists.”
Sherlock Holmes’ ire dissolved when he read the note on the desk. Recognising the handwriting, he deduced some calamity had befallen his original note and that Mrs. Hudson or, more likely, the silly girl standing in for Bessie, had copied it—most incorrectly.
“Did you know Lady Lilac personally, Sir Adrian?” asked Holmes.
“My lolly’s hard, Daddy,” he whined.
It was comically easy to shove him back onto the table, sink my prick back into his now much-abused hole, and resume my sodding.
“Interesting.”
Sherlock took up the box and read aloud,
He did.
On the wall of the tent was the silhouette of a hand holding a knife.
It was not a bauble; of that, I was certain. Holmes knew I didn’t go in for such things.
“I’ve been dead twice. I’ll take my chances. Join me?”
He turned sharply and with a rueful expression, said,
Summary: 1902. Holmes confesses his feelings. Watson reacts. Pre-Sussex.
“Did I?”
Sherlock tucked his gloves in his pocket and spat on his palms.
Irene nodded.
I needed my Watson.
“Come, Watson, I understand that head wounds are not trifles; thus, I will place myself under doctor’s close care for the next two to four hours. And you, my dear man, should accept no substitutes.”
And hard.
Seb tugged at his collar for the umpteenth time. He hated playing a part, especially when that part required him to wear a suit and tie. It was October, but he was sweating profusely. There were too many people in this damn place. Seb longed for a quiet perch, preferably with an autumn breeze to make things lovely and crisp. Snipers always preferred shooting weather.
The boss sighed. “Seen any good films lately?”
Soon her back was against the wall. He sank, nuzzling her breasts and stomach atop her clothes. Then he reached her skirt and whistled.
“Yes, Daddy.”
I’m still
In a few moments, Watson saw it.
“What?!”
For: the DW Genderqueering Holmes March prompt: sunshine. Trans Holmes.
“Mexican. With chili pepper.”
Seb nodded.
“Well!” I exclaimed. “The nerve!”
There are several recipes out there for a Pete's Dragon, but lamentably I couldn't find one that involved liquid smoke :)
“Jim! I wasn’t expecting—“
“And we shall walk together through the gates of eternity hand-in-hand,” said Sherlock, licking a splash from the corner of his mouth.
“Try again.”
“Yes.”
Yes, he decided, perfectly acceptable. He pressed the button, then as the door closed, smoothed a fastidious hand down the front of his coat.
I dreamt of Bully every night for a week and had no need for further laudanum dosing.
Mycroft stared.
Sherlock’s eyes lit. He immediately began to nuzzle at the front of John’s joggers.
“Did you have her investigated?”
“I know! Where ever do they buy it?”
“Great! Have you ever had…Earl Greg?”
“Don’t appall me when I’m high,” warned Mycroft.
“No,” said Mrs. Hudson, draining her glass. She swished the gin around her mouth to savour it before swallowing. “I only allow myself one glass when I am at work with a needle.”
“Watson,” Holmes breathed.
The anguished cry is not enough.

The creature hid his face in his hands. “But it was me own mum! And dad! Oh, ho, ho!”
“Indeed?” I say, taking a sip to fortify me for what may be to come.
“Am I to come, come to crisis, if convenient, and if inconvenient, come all the same?”
Seb finished the whole thing in three bites. “Now can I come?”
Mycroft spun him by the shoulder and shoved. “Assume the position,” he menaced.
“Apologies,” he said, affecting a posh voice. “It’s the heat.”
Summary: Mister Holmes writes that he cannot provide a public endorsement. However...
The one day that Mycroft hadn’t worn a proper waistcoat! There was prepared and then there was angels fearing to tread!
She ate chocolate after chocolate. Then, with that sweet rich flavour in her mouth, she pushed the Malacca shaft inside her, testing how deep the curve of the handle and the curve of her body would allow.  It was perfect, smooth and hard. The folded silk of the umbrella canopy rustled as she began fucking herself in earnest.
“Turn me over, strip me, and fuck me, Sherlock.”
I wipe the sweat from my brow on my sleeve and, with clumsy movements and a groan, push myself to standing with garden soil still caked to the knees of my trousers. On my rising, I snatch the straw hat from where it fell and shove it back on my head, shading my eyes that I might, with undisguised curiosity and appreciation, watch Holmes move about his hives. He has traded his ‘pipe smoker,’ a device that gave more aesthetical pleasure than apiological utility, for a larger, two-handed instrument. He is masked and gloved and shrouded and I wonder on a day such as this, with the August sun beating down on us and no trace of a breeze to be had, how he can elect such voluntary mummification.
Mycroft coughed, then continued, “Please, through here. It’s in the tantalus.”
“On your back, so I can see those—“
Sherlock yawned. He wore a white bedsheet wrapped around him, more cocoon than toga, and nothing else.
Lestrade wiped his brow.
“Yeah, Sebbie and I’ve got some work, too.”
She looked for him in the room just as she had looked for him at the gate and on the plane and in the taxi. It was like hide-and-seek.

For Kinktober 2020: Day 4: Incest and DW Octobercest.
There was a menacing growl.
Holmes says the smoke soothes the bees. He says it also prompts them to eat—a last supper before forced exile—and, thus, are less likely to sting. He lulls them in order to go about his business—a bit of hive repair I believe is the objective of today’s foray—more freely.
When they exited the concert hall, Sherlock looked up at the starry sky. “It’s beautiful.”
Mycroft’s gaze ran over Lestrade’s face.  Lestrade smiled a tired but genuine smile.
“You were a bit quiet, but there’s nothing wrong with that. First time, trying to figure out what works, bound to be some missteps…”
“Oh, yes, well, I’ll just…”
“John…”

Mabel dropped the note on the desk and, upon hearing her name being called from the street by the young fishmonger in that funny way of his—Ma-
Sherlock’s head was swimming. Just before he latched on the other nipple, he found the wherewithal to ask,
“Still uneasy about this Baskerville business?” I probed.
John dropped the flute on the counter. Violent, but pleasurable, spasms wracked his body. His muscles were uniformly tense, then they relaxed and tensed again, pulsing as if they were…
“You gave it up for the New Year,” continued Sherlock. “So did I.”
“I have to say I think the frosty coconut mojito is your best effort to-date, Sebbie.”
Holmes returned the top to its former place and studied the skull carefully.
Sherlock likes it all. And sometimes, on those rare Sundays when they’re both rested and not a bit bored, they do it all.
Lestrade’s eyebrows rose.
“Some people have reported great health benefits from it, John. Increased vitality, etcetera, etcetera, but apart from that, we have to do everything that the Saundersons did so that we can get to the bottom—”
When Lestrade was fully sheathed, he leaned forward and whispered,
“I say, Holmes, what’s all this?”
Seb smoked his cigar and sipped his whiskey.
“Do you mean—?”
John heard the strike of a match. Suddenly, the room was filled with the light of one tapered candle.  “Four,” he replied.
“Molly, my dear.”
“Could be an hour. Could be dusk ‘til dawn.”
“John?”
Holmes’s lips curled in a grin.
John sucks hard on Sherlock’s bottom lip. His hips start to buck of their own accord. Then he turns back to Mycroft and licks at Mycroft’s lips. “Need your cocks,” he whimpers. “Spit-roast me. Take turns. Arse and mouth. Mouth and arse. Fill me up.”
Jim chuckled, then pinched Molly’s skin gently between his teeth. “Chemistry is for losers. Now, mathematics…”
“A vampire’s kiss pales in comparison to a vampire’s fuck.”
“Wait, Sherlock! No, don’t leave all this here.”
There are numerous inspectors in the various Holmesian versions. Have one or more interact with Watson in some way.
I hear the splash.

“You can have it if,” Clara raised the hem of the jumper, first showing off her damp ginger bush, then the lower half of her full, rosy-nippled tits, “you eat me out like a good boy.”
“Six. You’re going to clean this entire kitchen. To my satisfaction.”
Molly blushed and batted her long eyelashes and touched her blonde wig coquettishly. She glanced at the clock on the wall. “I’m late for work! Celebrate tomorrow?”
Warning: Reference to drug use.
This was Jim.
“How’s your brother?” he asked, making a beeline for the small box on the table he knew had been waiting for him.
Mycroft’s eyes widened.
“—so they trampled the whole bloody scene and, to top it all off, completely overlooked, and almost destroyed, the absolutely crucial, and most bleeding obvious, clue to the identity of the murderer!”
Molly’s alarm went off. Again. She groaned and rolled over and checked her mobile.
attention, I’d be forced to give harassing party a strong lecture about respecting women—”
“A chapter or two. It was a good drink, too. One of those Brazilian jobs that go down smooth.” He tugged on his bonds. “Nice knots.”
Forgetting about the camera, she closed her eyes and thought of the morning and the night before.
“You cut a truly magnificent figure, Gregory. Congratulations are in order, for I am rarely without words and you have, but momentarily, reduced my vocabulary to naught. Please come in, but one clarification: ‘second proper date’? My calculations have this as our fourth.”
And that was that.
“I feel odd, Sebby. Water!” Jim staggered into the kitchen. He leaned over the sink and twisted the tap. “I need,” he turned his head, chest heaving, "to suck your cock.”
A few hours had passed before the trolley made its way to their quiet compartment. He had taken some coin and bought a few pasties and chocolate frogs for the trip. Not long after the Longbottom boy began patting his pockets, getting up and searching the compartment rather frantically. He caught something about a toad and Hermione quickly followed him out of the compartment in search of it. Something about Trevor? A toad name Trevor?
He began to understand why students looked forward to this. If this alone would be the image he could look at for the rest of his days, he believed he would be happy with that.
Now that had lit the room with whispers. Not one Malfoy as far as history could record had not been a Slytherin.
Her voice was barely a whisper, sympathy and worry seeping through every syllable. He blinked at his name, realizing for the first time that a gentle stream of tears were wetting his cheeks, pale skin reddened by the distinct difference of the cold of the window and the warmth of the fire.
“What’s the point?” His voice came out cracked and rough. It had been a while since he had actually spoken. Days really. He wasn’t sure anymore. He has carried himself with square shoulders, trying not to break until winter holiday.
Sherlock had immediately blurted “candle” before the prefect could even answer— to the boys obvious annoyance. The eagle nodded in a satisfactory manner and stated “Very good.” Before sliding open to reveal a rather stunning home.
He had no problems admitting he was rather a brat. No sense in denying plain truth.
Closing his book and notebook with a huff, Sherlock began to click the pen in an annoying, rapid fashion out of boredom as his eyes began to roam the small compartment until they landed on the deathly silent companion across from him.
He was interested in
His mother was speaking to him in very quick, excited rambles. He caught enough bits and pieces to assume the would be emptying quite a chunk of galleons out of the family Gringotts Vault for
He had tried his best to look rather pleased by the statement.
While others sat on the edges of their seats to see where his younger brother would be placed, Mycroft got rather comfortable.
“But to know that it is real— I really am a witch— it is like a dream. I will be most pleased to see the bookshop I seen on the way in. I am determined to get a head start on things.”
When the time chimed for their departure to Platform 9 ¾ his father and mother summoned their respective trunks, shrunk them neatly and deposited them into his mother's handbag. Because you could only access the platform through the magical barrier, in the past years they had always apparated to the same discreet location only a few blocks away from the train station and walked the rest of the way. This year his mother planted them several miles from their destination and summoned a muggle cab— she even had muggle money! This had been the highlight of his entire day. He had seen automobiles before and read about them— but to be in one! It was marvelous.
