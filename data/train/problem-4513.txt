Cas’ jaw twitches, and he turns his face away, eyes hooded in the shadow of his brow. He gives a poorly feigned shrug, muttering flatly, “I don’t know what you mean.”
And that much is true. Dean’s well past the point of needing fatherly platitudes from John; he’d crossed that particular Rubicon half a century ago.
He settles back into his seat and shrugs, holding his glass over his belly. “Nothin’ much,” he mutters offhand. “Bit of research for the Arch - wards mostly.” He tilts his head toward the flatlands past the lake. “Rift opened up out in the marsh. Not much pass-through - coupla small fries itchin’ to get outta Purgatory. Bill and Jo’s crew sent ‘em packin’.”
Dean nods sharply and wrestles a smirk onto his mouth. “Gets that from his uncle,” he grunts and takes a long gulp of his beer.
Sam laughs, husky with surprise, and shakes his head. “Well,” he concedes. “Guess that’s something.”
Dean blinks hard and gives her an incredulous look. “You got Kevin out of the Library ... for cartoon porn?”
Dean finds Cas in the shade of a leafless maple tree, his palms pressed flat against the scorched-black trunk. Bumblebees dance through the hellebores at his feet, and a mild breeze flutters the hem of his trench coat. The wind chimes tinkle a discordant melody.
John makes a short, guttural sound, somewhere between a laugh and a sob. For a moment, Dean forgets all the reasons he didn’t want to see John’s face and finally -

Dean swallows hard around the lump in his throat. “How ya doin’, bud?”
Cas hums and tilts his head. “Ten years, give or take.”
, it’s been checked out.”
Dean shakes his head and sniffs. He presses his palms against the mattress, hoisting himself to his feet. He wobbles for a moment, his headache briefly reaching a critical mass, then blows out a long sigh. He peers up at Cas - still studiously attending his book - and takes a cautious step forward.
P.S. I may post the original dialogue-only draft of this fic, if anyone is interested. There are a handful of marked differences, but if you'd like to see it, let me know in the comments. Thanks!
Dean is just...
Dean gives a bark of laughter. “Man, you’re a nerd.”
Dean starts and looks back at his brother, but Sam’s eyes are settled on the water.
Dean’s jaw snaps shut, lips pursing, and... yeah, that tracks. “Right,” Dean murmurs, tipping his head back in a nod.
She nods, still staring glassy-eyed into the middle distance. “You followed one little bee all day long,” she murmurs. “Counted all the flowers she landed on. Then you,” she swallows, and her eyes go shiny, “you raced inside and scribbled it all out on the back of a—” a startled huff of laughter, “—a takeout menu.”
Ellen makes a sound like ‘hoo-ey’, and Dean looks up at her through watery eyes. Her face is screwed up, tongue running over her teeth, and Dean huffs a laugh that feels like smoke in his lungs.
Dean swings his leg over the stool, resting his elbows on the tabletop as Bobby settles in opposite him. “Karen home?” he asks as Bobby slides him his glass.
Charlie turns toward him and tilts her head, expression curious and bemused.
Dean looks inward, and
Dean frowns and squints down at his feet. The days surrounding Mary’s death are strange in his memory - blue-tinted and Gaussian blurred. He doesn’t remember candy or costumes, though.
Her fingers wrap around it, smoothing over the embossed lettering. “Got everything you
“The Archangel blade,” Dean whispers.
Dean had pulled up maybe ten minutes ago. He’d idled a few moments, as always, letting Baby’s rumbling purr soothe the tension across his back. When he was certain his legs would hold him, he’d cut the ignition and hoisted himself up, striding towards the barn with all the gusto of a man walking the plank.
He remembers curling up on a no-tell bed with Rhonda Hurley, the roach of an inexpertly rolled joint burning his fingertips. She wore his boxers - slung low on her straight hips - and he wore her pink satin panties. They’d fucked and smoked and fucked again, and when she’d caught sight of the fingerprint bruises on his arm - a relic of John dragging him from a werewolf’s grasp, shaking him roughly with fear-scented rage - she’d said simply,
When he’d heard through the grapevine that Kevin had finally made it over, Dean had sent Jack a silent, thankful prayer. He’s thought about checking in on the kid, but word has it he’s top dog at the Library - the new and improved Scribe of Heaven. Dean figures that’s about as close to ‘advanced placement’ as the kid is likely to get, this side of the pearly gates.
Cas turns toward Dean, his eyebrows arching toward the center of his forehead. His eyes have gone shiny and pink-rimmed.
Kevin taps his pen against his open book. “
Even softened by the balm of her compassion, the words pull at him, stinging like a paper cut. Dean folds his arms on the bar, hunching his shoulders forward. “Jo lost her dad,” he returns, and winces at the sharpness.
Dean’s jaw clicks shut. The sun...
Dean sucks in a breath, humid and brisk. Sam’s right, of course. Dean’s childhood memories are scant and disjointed, recorded onto his recollection in faulty stop-motion. He grasps at the images whizzing behind his eyes - an autumn thunderstorm, a wide bay window, weedy grass and buzzing bees, wildflowers and—
on the wall.
A shiver climbs up the back of Dean's neck. He shrugs it off.
Sam goes silent, staring down at his hands wringing together in his lap.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shakes his head. “Shit.”
“There were puddles at Bobby’s place,” he murmurs, then waves a limp-fingered hand toward the river. “Wet grass at the picnic.” Another step forward, ever closer, and there’s something dawning in Cas’ eyes now, glazing them over as they track Dean’s every move. “There’s mud on my boots,” Dean whispers, “even now.”
Dean’s eyes go wide, brow furrowing. “Wh-. Seriously?”
Cas sighs deep, shoulders curling forward. His hands clench and unclench at his sides, face darkening like a storm. “If you don’t like the weather,” he grunts out, bitter and briny, “you can change it.”
Dean sobers and shakes his head. “He said that’s where the storm was.”
Sam’s shoulder bumps Dean’s as he hoists himself to his feet. Dean glances up at him, eyes squinted against the spots of light shining through the leaves overhead.
Dean frowns, and his eyes flick up from where they’d been staring sightlessly at the book cover. He shakes his head, lips pursing. “He leaves?”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and his voice is gruff and too loud. He thinks one of his fingernails might have pierced the skin of his palm. “Yeah, they do.”
in the thick of it,” he grouses, glancing toward Dean. “We both were.”
Sam glances up at him briefly and gives a tilted nod. “She’s good,” he says, then breathes a resigned laugh. “She, uh,” he shakes his head, floppy hair bouncing around his ears. “She’s thinking about joining the Arch.”
Dean keeps his eyes forward. He doesn’t speak.
Trouble is, with the thrum of a headache pulsing at his temples and the ache in his eyes from the overbright sun, he’s not sure he’s even got it in him to hope.
He’d only been here once before, some fifty odd years ago, but it’s etched into his memory so clearly, it might’ve been yesterday.
But it isn’t any of them.
He’s at the inlet again, on his weathered bench at the end of the crooked pier. He’s got a beer in one hand, his spinning rod in the other. Line cast. Bob bobbing.
But if Dean knows Sam at all - and he certainly does - the silence wouldn’t have lasted forever. Kid’s too smart, too curious, too empathetic by half; sooner or later, he would’ve broached the subject - for Dean’s sake, if not his own.
Cas has always known him. Always found him.
,” he gushes, and Dean chews on a smile. “They’ve got everything ever written
his fondest memory of John - a vague half-remembrance from nearly a century ago, buried under a quagmire of regrets.
Kevin turns another page. “If you’re looking for
He stares across the table at Mary. She’s silent but smiling, her eyes far away. It’s a familiar look, one he’s seen on nearly everyone he knows in Heaven. Like they’re lost in a beautiful memory - a moment in their past lives that they didn’t regret.
Dean turns back toward his brother, but Sam’s eyes are fixed on the little plastic menu.
- since Dean last saw them, and even then, they’d been painted in ash on the wet dirt, misshapen and sparsely feathered. But
It’s one thing Dean has never faulted him. One thing they have in common.
These days, Dean could probably down a sixer of the stuff before the bubbles went out. And with Heaven’s littering policy vanishing all his empties, it’s entirely possible he already has.
He’d known the moment he arrived - felt it in his bones - that this was
Dean’s pretty sure Cas knows he’s there. Back when they’d first met, Cas could teleport directly to Dean from a thousand miles away - could find Dean in the dark and cold, endless expanse of Hell. Even powerless and human in an alternate universe, Cas had known Dean nearly the instant he saw him.
He looks—
Kevin sniffs. “And the Ark of the Covenant.”
Her voice is soft and ambivalent, as if she’s already accepted his answer. It gets Dean’s back up, and he peers up at her through flinty eyes.
Dean’s jaw clenches tight. “Wh—”
Dean’s hand clenches into a fist, fingernails rasping against his palm. “She’s happy?” he asks, eyes fixed on the countertop.
Dean’s eye twitches in a flinch, but he nods and digs his fingertips into his elbows.
Forty years isn’t long enough. A
John shakes his head. “Nope,” he confirms. “Big storm came through. Nothin’ too bad, but. Lot of wind, rain. Lightning.”
“Ugh, god,” he sputters, setting the glass down heavily on the low coffee table. “What is that?”
She gives him a mild glare, betrayed by the play of a smile around her mouth, and reaches for her giant pint glass -
And right in the center, barely twenty feet from where Dean stands, is a wide teak bench - with a dark, tousled head peaking over it.
it now - waiting to spill out in riptides and crashing waves. Ready to flood him, bury him. Drown him.
Dean clears his throat. “So,” he says, and waves a hand in a broad gesture. “What, uh. What all you got in this place?”
, that
He feels his mouth form Cas’ name, but it fizzles out on the flat of his tongue. He wants to argue; of course, things have changed - Cas got his wings back, he’s immortal, an archangel, for Christ’s sake.
Dean looks toward the sky, the ice-cold rain biting into his skin, washing the salt from his wide eyes. The water drips from Cas’ jaw down the side of his neck, winding around the fine hairs there. It pools at the place where Dean’s palms meet Cas’ throat, seeping in between and fusing their skins.
“Nah, I ain’t talkin ‘bout numbers,” Ellen counters. “Even if she’d been your age...” She breathes out a sigh, and Dean looks up at her. The little rag is balled up in her loose fist, her lip caught between her teeth.
“Yeah,” Sam sighs out. He shrugs again and runs a hand through his hair, frizzy from the briny air. “I don’t know. Sounds weird, but... If you’re not into the whole—” he waves a hand toward the cloudless sky, “—Norman Rockwell sunny slopes thing—”
“And it’s the same reason,” Bobby grunts sharply, pointing a wrinkled finger towards the sky, “that sun shines so damn bright.”
It’s a beautiful day, Dean thinks. And he nearly believes it.
, and they could carry on as ever, as always. They’d stare down at the picnic a while, til Sam got up to go join them. Dean would head home to sit alone on the ratty couch in his bunker, or sit alone at his little inlet, never catching any fish, or sit alone in his car parked outside the forest in the field - unable to enter, unable to turn away.
Kevin gives a little hum, then extends his other arm, hand outstretched. A book - identical to all the others lining the shelves - materializes on Kevin’s palm, as Dean watches with wide eyes.
,” he murmurs. “But...” he pulls his lips through his teeth, giving a slow, weary nod. “They knew.”
Dean feels his smile slip, and he peers down at the little talisman. It’s a rusted iron triquetra with shining gemstones inlaid, the whole thing no bigger than his palm.
Dean stares at him, eyes wide and unblinking. His jaw works soundlessly for a moment before he scrubs a weathered hand over his face, breathing a startled laugh. “
“Looked like it, yeah,” Sam says, and squints harder. “I dunno, maybe a... farmhouse?” Another head shake. “Or an old barn?”
He peers through the windshield, eyes squinting against the light, and observes the sparse spring clouds drifting over the pass. If he looks hard enough, he can probably find Sam and Eileen’s place - a little white dot on the mountainside. Instead, his eyes cut to the lowest point between the peaks, though he can see neither hide nor hair of what lies beyond.
he’s wrong.
,” Bobby scoffs, ignoring the interruption. “Still every bit the damn idjit you always been.”
“Ya know,” he grumbles, taking another short step. “I been sittin’ around up here, doin’—” he glances down at his feet and huffs a bitter laugh, “—jack shit.
Dean shakes his head. “He
Mary reaches her hand out again, and Dean goes tense for a moment. His eyes flit to hers, and he finds them crinkled at the corners. She’s smiling at him as she’d smiled at his little drawing, as she’d smiled when she sat him down, as she’d smiled while he ate his pie. She’s smiling at him now, as she had when he was a boy, as she always has.
Though stately and finely architectured with pillars and white stone, the building that houses the Library is surprisingly small.
Dean gives him a stony stare, and Sam stares right back, circumspect but open. Though Sam looks just as he did when Dean kicked it, there’s a wisdom around his eyes now, like he’s figured something out - the right answer or, maybe, the right question. Dean grits his teeth and looks away. His headache lurks.
Cas’ shoulders rise, and the winged shadows along with them. He hunches forward, knees bending slightly. Ready for takeoff.
Sam breathes out a short sigh, plucking Dean’s empty bottle from his loose fingers. He glances down at the picnic, then out to the mountain pass. Dean watches him squint at the valley between the peaks and gets the sense that Sam isn’t looking at the mountains at all, but
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline, and he turns fully toward her. “You talked to Kevin?”
Dean licks his lip, and his hands clench and release. “Congrats on the promotion,” he grumbles, before he can think better of it.
Dean spins on his heel in a swift volte face, and marches towards the door, tottery but unfaltering. He crosses the threshold and steps into the garish sunlight.
by Sam.
Dean stares at the side of Sam’s head, then turns back towards the inlet. “Huh.” He’s seen some scattered buildings across the countryside - Harvelle’s just off the highway, Bobby’s by the river. Sam and Eileen’s place just outside the forest, and Dean’s own little bunker near the marsh. He’s yet to come across a hayfield, and certainly not an abandoned barn.
Dean winces, peering up at the cerulean sky with squinted eyes.
From nearly anyone else, it might be a snarky question, but there’s a sincerity in Sam’s tone - a gravity - that gives Dean pause.
you been, man?”
Cas sighs a soft laugh and turns toward Dean. He’s got that look he gets sometimes - all soft-lipped forbearance and bag-eyed empathy. And there’s something else, too. Something in the pink rims of his eyelids, the straight line of his brow - something bittersweet and aching like—
Cas’ eyes cut over to Dean’s, slitted against the morning sun. They flick over Dean’s face like Cas is categorizing him, committing him to memory, and Dean feels his brow sink in a frown.
“Think that was the happiest I’d ever seen him,” John says, voice just loud enough to carry over the burbling water. “Fishin’ with me.”
explain to Sammy when he’d begged to run away.
Dean nearly smiles at that. For the first time ever, he thinks he knows this one.
“‘Course, I will,” Dean grumbles, casting his eyes back to his empty plate. He shrugs. “Not avoiding him, just...” he trails off and shakes his head. Best leave it there.
Dean frowns and takes a cautious step forward. “I... didn’t make an appointment.”
There’s no brick wall, no chipping grout, no lopsided masonry. Instead, there are horizontal slats of dry-rotted wood, defaced with sigils in dripping black spray paint.
. End of the line. The thought had sobered him, at first, calmed him in the wake of his death. But the longer he lingers here, the more miles he puts on Baby, the more sunny days he wastes away on his bench at the end of the pier - the heavier his head seems to grow.
Sam’s head dips in a nod, smile growing soft around the edges. “Yeah,” he murmurs.
Jack imbued... what?
Cas sighs again, eyes falling shut. “It’s... not impossible.”
Cas got his wings back.
Dean gets the strangest feeling that, for the first time, John expects nothing of him.
Dean doesn’t know the answer - doubts he even wants to - but he does know one thing.
, Cas had whispered,
The door he came through is gone, and the wall along with it. Instead, there’s a raised platform with short stone steps before it, and what appears to be an exact replica of the Resolute desk at center stage.
He’d never said as much (for fear of getting cuffed over the ears), but he’d always thought she was a looker. Sun-weathered and artless - a dust bowl beauty.
Cas holds Dean’s gaze for all of five seconds, before his eyes cut away.
He glances up at Sam - at the downturned mouth and the shining eyes - and thinks, for the first time, that Sam might’ve done the same.
, or maybe an
Sam doesn’t disappoint, and his tone is light and mild, curious when he murmurs, “What?”
The first thing he sees is spray paint.
That brings Dean up short. A startled beat passes as Ellen stacks up the shot glasses, and Dean stares at the top of her head, slack-jawed.
He feels Sam’s stare on him for a few long seconds. He wonders what Sam sees, what Dean’s given away now, but hell would freeze over before he asks.
Dean had known in that moment that something was different, had felt it in the buzzing electricity of Cas’ presence, the way the little hairs on Dean’s arms had stood up.
It looks familiar, like he’s seen it in a textbook or possibly a museum. Then again, in Dean’s very short - and very,
of them - the same day he—” Sam angles the book towards himself and turns back a page, neck craning around, “—imbued Cas’ Grace.”
Dean chews his lip and keeps his head lowered; the words bubbling up in his throat are schmaltzy enough without Cas seeing him go all dewy-eyed.
Dean eyes the bottle and the wrinkled hand offering it, then he follows the line of the leather-clad arm to John’s face. He’s looking away, squinted eyes watching the play of ripples in the water. His brow is a straight smooth line, his mouth soft. He looks calm and at ease, spine curved and shoulders loose.
“And what?” Dean grunts. “Heaven just- just
She grabs a damp dish towel from the sink and dries her hands, giving a loose shrug. “You were too old for her.”
Dean shakes his head and barks a bemused laugh. “You power-washin’ your deck, or was there a tidal wave?”
He’d called Charlie just as he pulled up to the garden. After a brief back-and-forth, she’d given a disgruntled “you owe me one,” and - through some sort of Heaven-magic that he doubts anyone besides Charlie could pull off - the amulet had appeared in his glovebox.
Ellen gives an inscrutable hum, then slides the glasses off the bar and into the sink, spinning the rusted chrome spigot. Dean watches the water pour from the spout, wondering idly if it’s holy.
Lightning.
“Mhm,” she hums, nodding sagely. “You’d chase ‘em around, flapping your arms like little wings.”
Dean winces as a bead of sweat drips into his eye and cranes his neck to wipe his face on his shoulder. He looks back at the phone and rolls his eyes.
Dean huffs out a bitter laugh. “Somethin’ like that, yeah.”
. And second,” he ticks two fingers up, “they were vampires,” he complains. “Big, scary vampires.”
Dean’s fingernails scratch against his pants, hangnails catching on the denim. “How would I find out?”
The breeze shifts, cypress moss rustling overhead.
“I know, Dean,” Cas says with a tiny flinch of a smile. His eyebrows form a point in the center of his forehead, head tilting just so. “You have your family, your friends—” he splays his hands in a broad gesture, “—a safe haven. Things are...” He pauses for a moment, breathing a soft sigh. “Things are different now. Better,” he peers up at Dean for half a second, then lets his eyes fall back to his book. “I hope.”
Dean’s head pops up at that, and he feels his eyes narrow into a squint.
. Dean.”
Bobby ushers him through the foyer - dimly lit by the tinted skylight above - and into the dining room. He circles the round mahogany table with its calla lily centerpiece, and steps into a wide archway, gesturing Dean over.
“So,” Sam continues. “Once he was old enough to understand what we we were doing, where we were going, why it’s important—” he tips his head to the side, lips pursing, “—we, sorta got back into it. But...”
John had rarely smiled -
should be
has changed.
These days, that’s how he spends most of his time - meaningless construct that it is: wondering why he’s here. When Billie had sworn to cast him and Sammy into the Empty, Dean had felt a pit of dread open up on his chest - not for himself, but for his brother. Sam deserved a beautiful eternity spent with Eileen - just as Bobby deserved to be with Karen, Ellen deserved Bill, and Kevin deserved his Resolute desk.
Though there’s only a smattering of trees, they’re densely packed around the old barn, the canopy stippling strange shadows onto the muddied ground. Dean’s eyes trace them as he trudges the pitted path, stepping over errant roots and brittle fallen branches.
why Dean’s here. He doesn’t want an
Dean squints, searching his scattered memory. He remembers the yard, the foliage, the window into the kitchen. He remembers thunder and lightning and torrential downpour. He doesn’t remember himself.
John had put his hands over Dean’s on the rod, showing him how to hold the grip, how to wait for the sudden tension of a bite. Dean remembers the afternoon sun glinting on the water.
He glances at the passenger seat, empty but for his phone lying face down.
a kid, and she’s been dead fifty years.”
The teddy bear had blown a hole through its own head, stuffing falling like snow, and the pearl had been crushed to sparkling dust, fine as John’s windswept ashes.
They taste like salt and rainwater, scorched earth and dry ash. They burn his lips where they’re pressed against Cas’, stinging his tongue where it scrapes Cas’ teeth. There’s something sweet, too, in the breaths they share, in the clench of Cas’ hands in the soaked fabric of Dean’s shirt.
That said, Dean doesn’t understand most of her decor. There’s a surprisingly beautiful oil painting of what looks like the bushy-haired girl from Harry Potter standing over the corpse of a monster with a face made of teeth; Charlie called it the Demogorgon, which clarified precisely nothing. On another wall, there’s a giant framed poster of the little shruggie emoticon dude, which, on closer inspection, is itself made of other shruggie emoticon dudes. In the center of the foyer stands a life-size marble statue of Poison Ivy, flanked on either side by two huge suits of armor, armed with iron flails.
Dean frowns at himself, wondering why
“You alright?”
“Different here, yeah,” Dean snorts.
But of course, Cas isn’t human. Never was, really. From the moment he’d come crashing into that barn -
Dean feels his face shift into a frown, and he arches an eyebrow at her. “You think there’s somethin’ I want more’n all this?” he counters, a stiff forefinger waving in an all-encompassing gesture.
“Thirsty?” Bobby asks, though he’s already pouring two glasses.
Dean huffs a laugh at that, face splitting in a wretched smile. It’s a cop-out, and they both know it. Dean’s said enough last words to know they’re inherently selfish - a balm for the dying, not the survivors.
,” Cas sighs, and it sounds like a prayer. His chin wobbles, the rims of his eyelids gone pink and shiny. “What. Do you
She unfolds herself from her chair and stands up slowly, as if in a dream. She walks the four paces to the wood-paneled wall, reaching out a cautious hand. Her fingers close around the frame of the thing, and she gives a soft sigh.
Dean blows out a breath and cranes his head over his shoulder, peering at Baby where she’s parked at the dead end.
So he summons the closest thing he can to a smile and says gruffly, “‘Course ya did. I’m amazing.”
Sam tips his head back in a laugh. “Right,” he huffs out. “Except that he’s the spitting image of Eileen. And he’s gay.”
Dean grits his teeth and steels himself, pulling the words from the chasm in his chest.
“They didn’t—” Cas shakes his head, and a muscle in his jaw twitches. “They didn’t
sure as shit ain’t one.
Dean’s pulse kicks up, hands going clammy. “Cas—”
Dean blows out a humid breath. He’s not much of a Noah, and the only ark that’s ever carried him is standing three feet away - grim-faced and dark-eyed, telling him
“Oh,” Charlie murmurs. “Huh. Wasn’t last time I saw it.”
Dean gets the sense, as he steps over the threshold, that he’s walking through
Mary pauses at the abrupt change of subject, but deftly lets it slide. Her eyes flutter a bit, and she pulls her hand back. “Yeah?” she asks, giving a slightly awkward smile.
argue; it’s one of the vows Cas had pulled from him as they’d stood together in the graffitied barn where they’d met:
. He wonders if Cas had taken that for the edict that it was - wonders if that was the moment that Dean had taught him
Dean swallows, hard and dry, and says simply, “He
the Harvelles deserve. He nods to himself as the sun comes in through the window again, illuminating the smooth planes of Ellen’s face. The glare hurts Dean’s eyes, but he’s glad it’s shining on someone.
. “You, uh...”
, Lucifer had said, beating Dean bloody, suspended in the air.
Everything is
She stares at him, calm and unconcerned, the bow of her lips turned up in a tiny smile.
Dean’s jaw clenches, and he nods to himself. Kevin scribbles on for another few seconds, then stops and glances up, face bemused. “Kinda weird though,” he says, squinting, “the mistranslation.” He shrugs mildly and turns back to his book. “Guess even angels make mistakes.”
Dean gets the sense he’s apologizing for more than just his imminent departure - and no,
His eyes squint, trying in vain to adjust to the darkness, and a headache pokes at the back of his skull. He’s sure his heart is still needlessly beating, but he doesn’t feel it anymore.
Dean winces. “So you heard all that, did ya.”
Sam continues, voice pitched low. “And I don’t think he just...
On a whim, Dean double taps his location, zooming in tight. He sticks his other hand out the window, waving skyward. On the screen, he sees himself, flailing his arm like an idiot, crystal clear and moving precisely in time.
), like an interloper (which he also is, in an almost too literal sense). He sucks his teeth and saunters over to one of the long tables, running his fingers over the polished surface.
Dean’s face scrunches up in a frown. He wouldn’t have called himself fluent in Latin, even on a good day, but now that he hasn’t read any in forty odd years, he can barely suss out any meaning at all.
He looks down at his chest, where Cas has pressed his wet hand, then peers up into his face. There’s something there - or nearly so; something Dean had only seen once, but briefly, before it was swallowed in darkness - torn away in cruel spite.
Dean hunches forward and crosses his arms on the bar. His beer’s gone flat - par for the course with El Sol; it’s usually sat on the same shelf as Natty Ice, after all. He remembers a time when he was fifteen or so, and Bobby had cracked one open for him after Sammy had conked out. Dean had held in his grimace as long as he could, but the dregs had been skunky and tepid, flat as Sam’s Ovaltine. Bobby had rolled his eyes, grumbling ‘Well, drink faster, boy!’
Dean had spent his first twelve or so hours on the island coaxing his lungs to take in the briny air, sweating through the pits of his knockoff Tommy Bahama shirt, and subtly trying to smooth his poofy hair. Eventually, he’d given up and just peered out the window, eyes roving over the billowing fog in the valleys between the mountains.
Dean’s eyelids flutter, head shaking in a recursive twitch. His mouth has gone dry, tongue sticking to the backs of his teeth as he grunts out, “Thirty-
Sam plants his hands flat on the table - the final step of his pre-lore ritual - and Dean suppresses a smile. “Okay, so,” Sam starts, and Dean settles in. “Basically, Jack arrives in heaven with the
“I understood,” Dean whispers, and he feels John stiffen against his side. “I knew—”
How...
Dean hums and nods, though Cas isn’t looking at him. “Got your wings back, right?” He takes another step forward, barely two arm lengths away now, and wrestles a smile onto his mouth. “Bigger and better than ever?”
“Couldn’t say,” Kevin says, voice cutting through Dean’s wayward thoughts. “It was there before I got here.”
Dean had spent most of his life digging his own grave - and digging some more, and digging some more. Finding bedrock should be a victory, should feel like a reward, and yet—
- in Heaven.
Dean gives a weak smile at that, though it hurts like a fresh bruise. He’s not run into Jo since he made it topside, though he’d seen her once after she died. He remembers her, sitting bleary-eyed and sallow next to that bald fucker Osiris - defending Dean’s wasted soul as best she could. He remembers standing in a ring of salt, waiting -
Bobby’s eyes shift to the side before his brows pop up. “Cas’ place,” he surmises.
Compared to John, Bobby may well be Father of the Year - but he’s no pushover, and he certainly doesn’t pull his punches. Dean’s admired the old man’s brutal brand of honesty for some eighty years now, and he’s always taken it to heart: if Bobby says he’s being an idiot, then it’s very likely that Dean
—” a dry swallow, “—that.”
Dean’s head pops up, and he finally meets Sam’s eye. Sam’s brow is raised, the puppy expression back at full volume. Dean frowns, wary. “Digging?”
Something swells in Dean’s chest, pressing against the inside of his rib cage, and there’s a sharp sting behind his eyes.
Sam, the little shit, smirks wide. “I’m sure.”
, she’d said, and Dean had snorted. Yeah, John was proud of him. When he made the shot.
Dean nods, though he’s not sure what difference that makes. Chuck had been divine, and he was a piece of unmitigated shit. Michael was divine too, and he’d clawed at the inside of Dean’s skull like a damned hellhound.
“Say it again,” Dean commands, and suddenly he’s desperate to hear the words -
“We didn’t get too close,” Sam continues. “Eileen wasn’t sure about it, and we’d been hiking all day. But...” He trails off, brows rising and a tiny smile touching his mouth.
Dean chews his lip and follows Cas’ gaze out over the water. There’s a seabird flying lazy figure eights a ways out.
Cas looks precisely as he had the day —
Dean tips his head back in a nod. He really should’ve guessed that. He brings his bottle to his mouth, taking a cautious sniff to make sure he’s not drinking any more of that wimpy shit, and gives Charlie a sidelong glance. “Did you catch the snitch?”
“But,” Ellen starts, and Dean’s eyes snap to hers. She tilts her head, considerate and a little sad. “You’re not,” she says plainly, a frown etched into her forehead.
Bobby’s eyes go sharp and slitted, roving over Dean’s face like he’s looking for something. Whatever it is, he finds it, and he rolls his eyes when he does.
No. No, that’s not right. Dean couldn’t have had Cas twelve years ago. Twelve years ago, Dean was young and stupid, blind to everything but the never-ending search for revenge, mired in a pit of tar-black self-loathing, salty and embittered, lonesome and
Rough bark digs into Dean’s back where it’s pressed against the gnarled oak tree.
His spine is ramrod straight, head tilted up toward the canopy, but his chin drops to chest when he senses Dean’s presence.
Of course, Jo.
Dean’s mouth closes hard, teeth catching on the tip of his tongue, and his smile falls. Something hot and heavy coils in the pit of his stomach, and his spine curves around it.
She chews her lip for a moment, then tips her head toward Dean. “You remember what I used to tell you before bed?” she asks, peering up at his face.
Dean frowns and looks down, squinting at the small font. The top left corner reads
Dean, on the other hand, is a creature composed entirely of regret. “Yeah,” Dean grunts, and drags his eyes away from Cas’ face. They settle on his bare feet, toenails overlong, and he gives a jerky nod. “Yeah, okay.”
Dean’s fist comes down on the table - harder than he’d intended - with a dull thud and a sharp, throbbing pain.
“You know,” Mary begins, and Dean’s eyes flick to her hands, still resting on the table. “He’s not going anywhere,” she says, and Dean’s eye twitches in a wince. “You know that, right?”
Dean holds his gaze, and holds, and holds. His stomach still feels heavy, his chest hollow, temples throbbing with his erratic pulse, the ever-present headache a sharp point in the center of his forehead.
Something loosens in his chest, and his fists unclench. He smiles, wan but sincere, and leans back in his seat, crossing his ankles under the table. “Coulda done without the bees though.”
Dean clenches his jaw and takes an unsteady step forward. “‘The other angel,’” he repeats. “‘The one in the dirty trench coat who’s—’” Dean’s jaw clamps shut, teeth digging into his tongue, but he presses onwards, “... ‘who’s in love with you.’ That’s—” he runs his tongue over his lips, though his mouth has gone dry, “—that’s how Balthazar described you to me.”
“Hey, Cas,” he whispers, and
,” Dean grunts, and he doesn’t bother hoping he’s wrong. He knows better now. “They
Charlie puffs her cheeks out and her eyes dart side to side. For a second, she looks like she might try to stick to her guns, but she blows out a sigh instead. “Okay,” she concedes. “Maybe ‘let’ isn’t the right word.”
Sam’s smile widens for a moment, before his face goes somber. “There are things that make you happy, Dean,” he says sotto voce. “You just don’t trust them. You...” He gives Dean a look, all subdued melancholy and straight-mouthed empathy. “You have no faith in them.”
Sam rolls his eyes so hard his head tilts back. “Oh my god, why did I miss you?”
Sam tilts his head in a crooked nod. “Yeah, it’s kinda weird that he hasn’t, right?” He doesn’t wait for a response, and Dean doesn’t interject. “So,” he goes on, leaning forward across the table, “I did a little digging.”
, Dean thinks, more literally than ever before.
Dean’s eyes snap to her face, still downturned, and his jaw clenches tight. A frisson of panic runs through him, crystallizing into a hard mass somewhere behind his sternum. It’s heavy and dense, with a beguiling gravity that pulls him
you.”
He’d known it then too, not that that had stopped him running his mouth. “You’re busy,” Dean grits out. “I get it. I just, uh...” Fuck, he hates this - he
It occurs to him, of a sudden, that he’s got no damn idea what he’s doing here.
Dean looks up to find Mary seated across from him. She’s a little younger than when he last saw her, but otherwise she’s just as he remembers - her yellow hair falling in waves over her shoulders, her eyes a soft Carolina blue.
Stone by cracked stone, brick by wet brick.
Dean swallows and drops his chin to his chest. It’s honest enough - more honest than he had intended to be, really. Fleetingly, he wishes he could remember how to lie to Sam - as if any good had ever come of that.
For the first time in forty years, the recursive whisper in Dean’s head is his own:
And Dean’s noticed that, too. Spending hours (or minutes, or maybe decades) on the highway, Dean’s come across some odd spots: places where the grass is un-trampled and a little too green, the ground too flat, the trees too young. Whenever he passes one, he gets a strange feeling, like he’s watching a silent movie, or staring at a blank canvas. He feels it at his little bunker out in the greyscale marsh, and he felt it at the tiny forest in the endless yellow field. Like a song without a refrain, something is missing - unfinished.
Dean turns back to the towering doors. Before he can think better of it, he presses his weight against one side, nudging it ajar. It creaks something awful, and Dean winces at the sound, halting his movement.
Dean’s eyes flutter closed for half a second. Of course, Bobby knows. “Yeah,” he grunts.
Sam gives him a smile, all white teeth and deep dimples. Dean tries to give him one back, but it feels more like a grimace on his face.
Dean represses a scoff at that. “Why wouldn’t he?” he says and picks up his fork, eyes downcast. “He’s got you.” He slides the crumbs around on his plate, shoulders hunching forward. “All he ever wanted.”
Dean’s hand hangs in the air, callused fingertips reaching toward nothing. Without the lamplight, or the feathered shadows, or the humming, electric presence of an angel - of
to the trussed up ma’lak box of Shit He Doesn’t Think About. This close to it, he can just make out the whispering voice—
Oh, god, he
Dean huffs out a chuckle, bitter and resigned. “‘Course he did,” he grunts, pressing his thumbs together.
, so much as a hapless slew of endless mistakes, hands gnarled and spine bowing under the weight.
The word hits Dean like meltwater, freezing him in place for a short, fragile beat.
“Things have changed for you,” Cas murmurs as if Dean hadn’t spoken at all. He sucks his lips into his mouth, chewing on the bottom one, and it’s such a familiar motion, something Dean’s seen him do a million times, and—
Cas, for his part, is staring placidly at Dean, gaze leveled somewhere around Dean’s nose. His eyes shine a deep limpid blue, pink-rimmed with pronounced bags underneath. He looks tired and a little grumpy, hair mussed and trench coat rumpled. His tie is loose, the skinny end dangling free of the keeper loop.
Dean feels Sam’s eyes on him, feels the weight of his stare pressing him down into the wet grass beneath him - but Sam only sighs.
Dean’s eyes flick open, and he stares out at the water. He clears his throat and hunches forward. “Yeah?”
Dean’s eyes close on a sigh, chin dropping to his chest. “I don’t need you to
Dean nods; he does know. John and Mary had lied to them both - and to each other - and it hadn’t gotten them anywhere but six feet under.
It’s a stupid question. He already knows the answer - knew the second he saw the sharp, looping script. The instant he read the word
Dean’s brow drops low, head turning sharply toward Cas. “Ten years,” he repeats, bemused.
He shakes his head and huffs a dry laugh, chucking the phone onto the dash. He flicks on the radio,
It’s almost funny, really. Turns out living in the Happiest Place Not on Earth hasn’t changed Dean much; he still divides his time evenly between
Dean sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. He glances down at his legs, flannel-clad and half buried under sweat-damp sheets. He squints down at the covers; baby blue and low thread count - they’re definitely his. He presses his hand against the mattress, watching the imprint stick and then fade - memory foam.
Dean remembers this place.
A short beat passes, punctuated by the rasp of turning pages and Dean’s own pulse throbbing near his temples. After a moment, the silence grows thick, heavy in the air.
Charlie smirks at him and takes another gulp, licking the foam from her top lip. “I may have spent my first afternoon here flying around on a broomstick like Harry Potter.”
“I’m safe, Dean,” Sam says simply. “And happy. Everyone - all of our family, our friends. We’re safe. And happy. I just...”
Dean himself had been destroyed, after all: devastated by his mother’s death, crushed under the weight of his father’s stark misery. He’d been cast into the Pit and rent apart, sullied by demon and angel alike.
Dean feels a pit open up in his stomach, strange and unbidden. He sets his beer down on the table, butting it up against his controller. “You tell the Arch?”
“You—” Dean pauses for a moment to consider his argument. But toeing up against Charlie is a bit of a nonstarter, and, well... Frankenstein is pretty badass.
“Think Sammy’s gonna join the Arch,” Dean says overloud, settling his elbows on the tabletop.
Stippled sunlight seeps through Dean’s eyelids, painting nebulous shapes in the darkness. He scrubs a weathered hand over his face and digs his thumb into his temple. There’s a tension headache lurking in the wings, and he’s got no damn idea where to filch himself a bottle of aspirin. He scrunches his face up against the sunlight and sighs; forty years tooling around the Great Beyond, and he’s yet to come across a CVS or - Jack forbid - a Heaven-Eleven.
busy—
Somewhere in his chest, there’s a tumbledown city - bombed out and burned down, razed and run through. But the broken ground is shifting, the rain putting out the embers, and for the first time in his life, Dean thinks he could rebuild it.
it is.
Cas turns to him sharply, brow sinking low and eyes squinting in startled offense. “Wh—”
Dean sucks in a noisy breath through his nose. A frustrated, petty part of him is tempted to feign ignorance.
Dean hunches forward, pressing his chest against his knees. “My point stands,” he grumbles and takes another swig.
“Speak your piece, boy,” Bobby says, and his tone is mild - kind in that way he pretends not to be.
Kevin watches him for a short, taut moment, eyes flicking across Dean’s face. Dean swallows again, shoulders coming up.
Any other day, Dean might’ve heeded it.
Their shadow seems to fill the whole barn, distorting at the corners of the room where their sheer size forces the silhouette to bend. The feathers are pristine, all the peaks and divots at uniform intervals, their tips spanning clear across the side walls.
Dean shakes his head. “How could you see me?”
— he died. The day he was taken by darkness, drained away —
He squeezes his eyes shut, hands balling into fists.
Cas’ eyes fall shut, and a few errant tears skitter toward the corners of his mouth. They clump his eyelashes together, leaving shiny tracks on the sharp angles of his face. Dean wants to smear them across his cheeks with his fingertips.
Dean nods and stares down at the amber liquid in his glass. He’s heard about the City - seen signs for it on the highway - though he’s never been. He’d learned young that cities are just for passing through - on the way to the next clue, the next job, the next apocalypse. The most he’d ever found in a city was a nameless girl to pass the night with, if he was lucky, or a wanted poster with his face on it, if he wasn’t.
Sam’s mouth goes a little slack, eyes scanning side to side, though Dean doubts he’s seeing anything. “I dunno,” he intones, squinting. “Something weird.”
Dean’s eyes trace over her face, searching for something, though he’s not sure what. She’s still the girl who made a deal with a yellow-eyed demon. Still the woman who left, and left, and left again. She’s no more perfect now than she ever was, but...
Dean huffs a brittle laugh and finally looks away. His eyes find the septagram again, and he grits his teeth. “That’s, uh,” another dry laugh, “that’s why I haven’t seen you in, what...
Dean’s eyebrows pop up, and he snorts. “We have the technology,” he mutters, pinching the screen to zoom out again. “We can make it better, stronger—”
Dean nods. He’d spent forty years there, after all - not counting the various forays afterwards. Every time he’d returned, there’d been a moment of paralyzing fear - a desperate clench somewhere in his chest, as he wondered if he’d make it out this time.
There’s a deep sigh from behind him, and he turns to see Kevin, weary-eyed and grumpy, peering past him to the inscription.
“Jesus,” he grumbles. “Yeah, okay.” He holds up the amulet, extending his arm as far from his body as possible; he’s pretty sure nothing can kill him now, but he’s not particularly interested in testing the theory. “So how do I use this thing?”
Something cold and hard forms in his stomach, and Dean shakes his head, eyes wide and unblinking, stuck to Cas’ like glue. “I’m good,” lie. “Yeah, I’m- I’m real good,” fucking
Kevin’s head tilts, but he doesn’t look up. “Hm?”
“Ya know,” Dean says in a harsh whisper, “you don’t seem real happy to see me.”
Dean is
Sam nods. “Yeah.”
Doesn’t matter anyway; Cas is staring down at his book, jaw set and eyes hard. Dean’s barely three feet from him now, but it feels like miles - like
“Yeah,” she murmurs. “Yeah, she’s real happy.”
Dean sniffs and presses the heel of his hand into his eye socket. “Thought Wish Magic was dangerous,” he mutters. He thinks of the ancient Babylonian coin that had brought a teddy bear to life - the shining white pearl that had pulled his father from his grave.
And sometimes, they rebuilt each other. Propping one another up, building foundations under the other’s stumbling feet.
. Certainly older than he was when—
Cas turns toward him, red-rimmed eyes meeting Dean’s own, sharp and shiny, pinning him in place. Something beats against the inside of Dean’s chest, and Cas says, imploring, “Did you think I didn’t mean them?”
“The weather,” Dean says, voice overloud.
Sam raises his eyebrows and hums. “Mm. The Arch...” he shrugs with bemused smile, “...angel.”
the reason.”
Abstraction Blue - Georgia O'Keeffe
Dean swallows and cuts a glance at Charlie. “What?”
Dean frowns harder, clarity drifting further and further away. Hardly matters, he thinks; fish out of water is dead, anyway.
He doesn’t feel dead right now.
“Dean,” Mary sighs, tone somewhere between chiding and apologetic.
Fair warning: this one
Dean stares at his back, watching his shoulder blades shift under his trench coat. He wonders if Cas can feel the weight of his new wings, feel them tugging at his spine even while they’re hidden.
Ellen huffs and rolls her eyes, then stoops down behind the bar, rifling through her wares. She comes up a moment later and slaps her prize down onto the counter, a triumphant smirk around her mouth.
The first goes down smooth like warm honeyed water, with a bite at the end that has him reaching for the next. The second is bite all the way through, spiced and peaty against the flat of his tongue. He takes a short gasp of breath before the last, and he’s glad he did; it hits him like wildfire, scalding his throat with brine and accelerant - a salt n’ burn in a tiny scratched glass.
He blows out a deep sigh, emptying his dusty lungs, and finally peels his eyes open.
Something rises inside Dean, cresting in his throat like a tidal wave, and he speaks shortly, sharply, before he can think better of it. “Where the
John shifts awkwardly at his side, leaning toward Dean’s ear.
The drawing is entirely ridiculous - an indecipherable riot of squiggly pen lines and waxy crayon color. There’s a messy bed of green near the bottom, which Dean assumes is grass, and it’s speckled with tiny blobs of vibrant pink and deep red - flowers, Dean thinks. Near the center of the page is a single white daisy with a bright yellow bumblebee hovering over it. A swirling purple line trails behind its black-striped body, making loop-de-loops around every flower. The sky is a strip of electric blue at the top, just above an empty field of white - the landscape drawn as children often do, with the heavens separated from the earth.
He runs a hand over the back of his neck and tries for nonchalant. “Heeey, Kevin,” he says, wincing at the slight crack in his voice. “How ya doin’, bud?”
Sam glances back to him briefly and nods. “Yeah.”
“I run out the back door, callin’ your name. Heart’s in my throat, thinkin’ how long you been out here. Cold, alone. Scared. But when- when I get to you... You’re smiling.”
He swallows hard. “‘Yeah,” he grunts and clears his throat. “‘Course.”
He sighs, resigned, and gives a shrugging nod. “Yeah.”
Cas’ lips pull back, smile going wide and gummy. “No,” he demurs. “No, you were...” he squints, considering, “... twenty, maybe thirty thousand miles away.”
- and chucked it back onto the nightstand, pulling the covers over his head. He’d slept until the sun went down.
“Presumably, he—”
Dean’s sure he knows what all those words mean individually, but- “Yeah, I got no idea what you’re talkin’ about.”
way.” Dean rolls his eyes, head tipping forward, but he doesn’t offer a counter.
out,” he says and sets the book on the table with a soft thunk, “from the Library.”
Cas’ eyes flick open, and he blinks once, frowning in bemusement. He shakes his head, but doesn’t speak, and his jaw clenches taut.
Dean is silent for a beat, debating whether asking the question is worth hearing the answer. He puts on an air of detachment he doesn’t feel and asks, “You thinkin’ about it too?”
His voice comes back to him on a stuttering exhale. “You got Bill back,” he murmurs.
, and he still hasn’t lived down the juggalo thing. “Alright, first off,” he says, gesturing wildly with the nuclear weapon in his hand, “it was rebar. Not a nail.
Dean stares at Sam’s profile. He’s got Mom’s nose and Dad’s chin, Mom’s straight spine and Dad’s weathered hands; but mostly, he’s just himself - a man of his own. Dean’s always wondered how he managed that.
“Well,” he says, mustering a smile. “I’m real happy for ya.”
Sam is here -
Cas halts and glances back up at the tree. Dean follows his eyes to the beehive. It hangs near the end, its weight pulling the narrow branch downward. There’s a knot at the place where the branch meets the trunk, with a wide crack running through it.
The tension across Dean’s back lessens by a fraction. It’s the least Jo deserves - the least
Sam sighs and angles his shoulders towards Dean, eyes far away. “Yeah, uh, we... we went over the pass.”
He’d caught word from another hunter - Lee maybe, he doesn’t quite remember - that an artifact storeroom in the archaeology building was haunted. There’d been reports of objects moving on their own, cold spots and the smell of smoke, and the soft, distant strains of anguished weeping. Nothing particularly bad (no injuries or deaths, in any case), and the disturbances had only started a couple weeks before - just after an earthquake had shaken the northeast. Dean had figured it’d be a simple salt and burn.
Dean smirks. “You guys get it on in the woods?”
Sam nods and sucks in a breath, one hand coming up to tuck his hair behind his ear. Dean’s eyes soften at the gesture; for all he’d wanted to be a lawyer, or a hunter, or a freakin’ superhero, Sam had always been a Man of Letters at heart.
Dean’s eyes roll skyward at her chipper tone, and he fiddles with the odd little trinket in his other hand. “I mean, is it gonna work,” he grunts out.
- flashing on the screen. He’d picked it up and fiddled with it, running his fingers over the burnished metal and smooth glass. If he’d never seen any of the crazy shit Charlie’d cobbled together, he would’ve said the thing looked Space Age - all sleek lines and sharp angles, no buttons to speak of.
Ellen grumbles and runs her hand through her hair, before pointing a chiding finger at Dean. “Mind your tongue, boy,” she says and drops her hands to the edge of the bar. “Bill hears you talkin’ like that, he’ll put one between your eyes.”
That much is certainly true. Not two minutes after he’d left the barn yesterday, it had occurred to him that his car was still parked outside his bunker in the marsh. He’d grumbled a bit, but started walking anyway, humming Whitesnake lyrics under his breath. The gravel path had slowly turned to blacktop, mirages dancing in the stinging sunlight.
Her head tilts up, absent eyes meeting his as she pulls herself from reverie. “You were... three? Maybe four?” She looks down and brings a hand to settle over her heart. “It was beautiful,” she whispers, and tilts her head. “Wish I still had it.”
Dean blows out a shaking breath, eyes flicking sightlessly. “You carried me back inside,” he whispers, and he remembers that, too - John’s rough hands circling his waist, hoisting him up, pressing Dean into his warm, dry chest, strong arms wrapped around his back.
Kevin moves around the desk and settles himself in his chair, grabbing his pen. He clicks it once, twice, three times, and presses it to the page, jotting something down in quick, spare movements.
His stomach chooses that moment to grumble ominously, and Dean hunches forward, pressing his forearm across his belly.
Dean hums and nods. “And a, uh, ruggedly handsome ladykiller,” he adds, pointing a forefinger toward his own face.
Bobby stares at him for a short moment, blue eyes squinted against the sunlight. Then he blows out a gusty sigh and reaches for his drink. “You’re a damn fool,” he grunts, and knocks back the last finger.
“I was confused,” Cas says, cutting through Dean’s wayward thoughts. “I didn’t understand why my brethren couldn’t see you.” He breathes out a soft sigh, eyes distant and a little awestruck. “You shone like a star.”
Dean pulls the phone away from his ear and briefly presses the back of his hand into his eye socket. He nods to no one in particular, pulling his lips through his teeth. Sure, plutonium. Why not.
“I stopped by the Library,” Charlie says, nonchalant. Then she gives Dean a mischievous grin, raising her glass to her mouth. “Wanted to see if they had
“Personally,” he murmurs, as he inks a full stop, “I’d just knock on their door.”
Something cracks in Dean’s chest, and he’s talking before he can trap the words behind his teeth. “I’m not sure I-.”
Sam’s head pops up like a frickin’ meerkat, all innocence and feigned confusion. “What what?”
Dean raises a doubtful eyebrow. “Did I?”
,” he urges. “Say it again.”
. He recalls seeing it printed on greeting cards, boxes of chocolate, Valentine’s bouquets - the sort of shit normal people busied themselves with.
Ellen gives a little chuckle and pulls back, dusting off Dean’s shoulders.
- had been out of this world; crunchy and greasy, sour and salty, and drenched in sauce hot enough to make his eyes water.
Mary’s eyebrows pop up, and she smiles a little wider. “You remembered me,” she offers.
Dean feels his jaw go slack, and his eyes get a little misty. Kevin is in Heaven, and he’s sitting at a giant desk with a frickin’
, comes the whispering voice, gravelly and bleak like something dragged across a tundra.
Dean eyes flick up from where they’d settled on his dirty plate, and his brow furrows. “A map?”
“It was on fire.”
“They didn’t hate me, Dean,” he murmurs, and his tone is chiding and pleading at once. “They—”
John clocks it though, as he always did when Dean got snarky. Punishment was usually swift, the degree of severity proportionate to the count of John’s empties. More often than not, it was a stern look or a barked reprimand - a cuff about the ears, if John was really in his cups.
Dean bites the inside of his lip, pressing his palms - clammy and tense - against his thighs. “Who lives there,” Dean asks, and it’s a stupid question again, barely a question at all. Dean’s heart beats in his ears.
Cas - steps forward until his toes just cross the penumbra. He looks—
Dean hadn’t called him while he was away, though he’d held his phone in his hands nearly every night, staring at Sam’s number with his thumb hovering over the button.

(See the end of the chapter for
“The,” Sam scrunches up his face, bemused, “...
John hums, and Dean sees him nod in the corner of his eye. “He, uh—” he interrupts himself with a hoarse chuckle, and Dean’s jaw clenches. “He found this- this dirty old box of gear in the garage. Tent, bags, couple poles.” His line tugs at the bob as he gestures vaguely with the rod. “Reckon he wasn’t real big on the whole great outdoors thing, but...” He trails off, and there’s a smile in his voice that has Dean frowning. He tries to remember John smiling when he was a boy, when Mom was alive. Dean thinks he must’ve done, but he can’t quite picture it.
Cas’ eyes flutter shut, and a muscle twitches in his jaw. “My work with- with the Arch is...” he trails off on a deep sigh, before glancing toward Dean’s face with arched eyebrows and hooded eyes, “...strenuous. Time-consuming.”
Dean’s eyebrows pop up, and his head tips in a bemused nod. “Oh, is that all.”
Charlie’s place is frickin’
More often than not, Dean’s afterlife feels much like his before-life: stumbling buzzed and ill-prepared from set piece to set piece, shoulders at his ears and a tension headache waiting for its cue.
John nudges Dean’s shoulder again, and Dean lets his body sway with the motion.
Dean’s lips turn down, and he shakes his head. “Sorry,” he mutters, mostly sincerely.
Charlie’s brow smoothes at that, and she perks up, grabbing her stein with both hands. “Probably. All kinds of weird stuff over there.” She takes a long swig and gives a tiny burp that has Dean huffing a laugh. “You seen the mini forest in the field?”
“Bye, Cas,” he says to the graffitied ground, and his chin drops to his chest, eyes burning.
Dean stares blankly at him for a moment before dropping his eyes to his hands, turning his glass in a slow circle.
The phone was something of a turn up. It had appeared at his bedside sometime during his first night in Heaven. He’d awoken to the sound of it buzzing against the tabletop, a message from Sam -
Dean snorts. “But.”
years?”
He assumes it’s heaven’s off-brand kind of ESP that’s landed him here, seated at a teakwood dining table in a house
“Dean—” he says sharply, but Dean isn’t listening any more.
Bobby squints harder. “Hey your damn self,” he snarks. “You look like pickled shit, boy.” Dean huffs a brittle laugh at that. Bobby stares at him for another moment, considering, before stepping to the side. “Gonna stand there twiddlin’ yer thumbs all day?”
Dean peels one eye open and casts it over the sprawling master suite. They’d arrived two days ago, but the luggage sits by the armoire still packed, the itinerary unopened on the low coffee table.
Sam gives him a tiny, crooked smile. “You wanna know what I think?”
Sam is silent for another moment. Then he sighs, barely audible, and turns back to the water. It glitters and ripples where the bob floats.
A soft harrumph draws his eyes to Kevin, staring at Dean with mild amusement and open expectancy.
“Naomi,” Dean interjects.
Dean’s eyes squeeze shut, and his head falls forward. His spine feels loose, wobbly like a Jenga tower.
, Dean. I- I can’t,” his throat works like he’s choking on air, “I
Dean peers around the plaza again, though there’s not a soul (he snorts) in sight. He squares his shoulders and straightens his spine, giving himself a little shake.
A pointed harrumph comes from somewhere behind him, and Dean sits up in a flurry, his neck giving a sharp pop as he peers over his shoulder.
Dean frowns and cranes his neck to glance at Kevin. “Oh?”
After a tense moment, during which his entire body clenches like a vise, he opens his eyes. He peers down at himself, patting a hand around his chest. He’s still— well, not
“Shoot it,” Bobby grunts. “Else it ain’t medicinal.”
“Many of the Host,” Cas intones, “my... my brethren.” He peers down at his hands, mouth a straight, firm line. “They knew.”
“He’s waiting for you,” he’d said as he sparked his dad’s old lighter.
Castiel.”
Dean swallows the relieved sigh coming up his throat and looks down at the reel, eyes squinting at the glare on the corroded aluminum. “Not ready,” he suggests.
Sam’s brow furrows, and he glances sidelong at Dean. “What were you thinking about?”
Cas turns back toward Dean, blank-faced and eyes downcast. “I’m needed elsewhere,” he murmurs, stepping backwards out of the pool of light. His shoulders shift strangely, spine going ramrod straight. It’s a familiar motion, though it takes Dean a minute to place why. It must be something close to fifty years since he last saw it - a weird little twitch, like something’s pulling at Cas from behind, like he’s counterbalancing a weight on his back—
Kevin hums. “It’s also mistranslated.”
Cas hums and gives a slow nod, eyes seeking out the little bird again, gone back now to its idle circling. “They couldn’t find you,” he intones. “Hell is...” he pauses, and his shoulders twitch in a little shrug, “... expansive.”
his way home - the divine magic of Heaven, and all that.
Forty years. He’s been dead
, he’d said - stood too close, eyes too blue.
Dean clenches his jaw and drops his fork onto the plate. It clatters loud in the calm of the spring afternoon, and Dean barely restrains a flinch.
Dean knows perfectly well why it’s always sunny: it’s
The breath freezes in Dean’s chest, and his muscles stiffen in a full-bodied flinch.
The little bee circles around Dean, slightly too close for comfort, and he waves a hand to shoo it away. He watches its flight, lazy and seemingly directionless, until it comes upon the back of the old barn. There’s a shining wind chime hung from a flickering sconce lamp, its long Corinthian bells silent in the still air. The bee hovers over it for a moment, then dances off toward a figure at the other side.
Kevin’s eyes roll, softened by the tiny smile around his mouth, and he goes back to his writing.
Dean frowns at the evasion, but shrugs it off, nodding at Bobby’s back. He steps up to one of the barstools at the little table and wipes the water off the seat with the side of his hand. “Always,” he snorts.
, she’d said.
Dean frowns, eying Cas’ stark profile against the ice-blue sky. “Oh?”
He tries for honesty - the sort of frankness that always terrified him when he was alive - but his voice comes out defenseless and confused, all the bluster of a moment ago dispersed like smoke. “I dunno,” he grunts. “I got Sammy, got—” he hides a stutter behind a grumbling harrumph, “—got Mom and Dad.” He nods his head towards Ellen. “Got you guys, and this...” a vague wave toward the sunlit window, “...place.” He pauses, weighing the validity of the words against the hollowness in his chest, and shakes his head. “Got everything I ever wanted.”
Mary is still staring at him, but the melancholy has given way to a sharp sort of consideration. Her eyes dart over his face, slightly squinted, and she looks so much like Sam that Dean turns to stare out at the sun.
Cas’ jaw goes taut, chin dropping to his chest. “Dean—”
Dean squeezes his eyes closed. Definitely no punches pulled. “Bobby—”
He knows. “I know.”
She reaches out a hand to grasp the side of the frame opposite Dean’s, the small weight of the silly little drawing shared between them. She’s got that look again, like there’s an old Super 8 projection playing in her head. Dean wonders what’s on the reel.
Dean’s mouth moves before his brain does, stuttering out, “I just—” before he bites his tongue and turns his face from Sam’s view. He’s not sure what he was going to say next, not really sure of anything these days. His pulse beats in his ears.
Dean doesn’t think about his human life. He’d lived it, after all. That was enough.
,” he recites, “
Dean glances over it all with a tiny smile on his face, while Bobby rifles through a white shaker cabinet. He comes up with two scuffed tumblers and a dusty unlabeled bottle, then juts his chin toward the sliding glass door.
“How—” Dean swallows to clear his throat. “How did I get here?”
She holds his stare until his eyes flutter down, his shoulders rising on a deep sigh.
- only to frown down at the flat dregs. She shifts as if to stand, then her face lights up, and she smiles over at Dean. “Hey, check this out,” she says, and the childlike excitement in her voice has Dean leaning forward. She raises the
His voice is low and scratchy, martyred as he grunts a plaintive, “
“Middle of the night,” John goes on, voice soft and a little distant, “there’s a thunderclap so damn loud it- shook the whole house. Car alarms go off outside, Sammy wakes up just
Dean’s jaw goes taut, molars grinding together. He peers down at his feet and digs his toe into a hairline crack in the stone tile. He isn’t a star. Most days, he’s barely even sure he’s a
Dean rolls onto his side. Even in Heaven, he can barely manage more than a few hours of shuteye a night. Whenever he tries to grab any more, he finds his eyes flicking open of their own accord, tracing over the mildewed brick wall of his bedroom. The grout lines are messy - poorly smoothed and a little crooked - and several of the bricks are out of square, misshapen. Dean’s stared at them so long he can see them behind his eyelids.
He steps around the bench and lowers himself gingerly onto the seat. A familiar ache climbs from the backs of his thighs to the small of his back, and he smiles at the low burn.
Kevin sucks in a breath and gestures to his open book, then to the stack of several more at his elbow.
“Would you have ever told me,” Dean murmurs, voice just loud enough to carry. Oddly enough, it’s precisely what he meant to say, what he came here to ask - but the words taste like ash in his mouth.
.” He shakes his head again and looks back toward the picnic. His face goes soft and smiley, and Dean knows he’s staring at Eileen. “If you want it, you gotta... you gotta grab it. Hold onto it.”
, reads the text.
“Huh,” he grunts in lieu of a response, and glances up.
“Well,” she starts, lacing her fingers on the tabletop. “I won’t speak for him—”
John is silent at his side, but it’s flavored with something Dean can’t quite place. Sadness, maybe. Or regret.
. “Is that...?”
Dean knows this. He knows all of this, but... But that doesn’t stop him from... It’s not the same as...
Cas’ voice echoes through Dean’s head, and his jaw clenches tight, throat constricting.
Dean’s eyebrows pop up, and he nearly laughs before wrestling his face into a bland smile. “Oh,” he says, glancing back at Kevin. “Uh. Cool.”
Dean nods and stands up. He spins in a slow circle, looking for any that he’d missed, and finds one directly to his right. It’s one of the only ones written at eye level, but its lettering - Latin, Dean notes - is pale, almost translucent. As he stares at it, it appears to grow darker, bolder against the wall.
“Damn,” he sighs out. “It’s good to see you.”
P.P.S. If you've got a prompt, need a beta, or just want to say hello, come visit me on
Sam lets him hang for a few seconds before smirking. “After you... bit it?”
Dean thinks.
Dean had sat on John’s lap, Sammy tucked into Mom’s arm, all of them huddled together under a threadbare quilt, eyes glued to the flickering sky. Dean had pressed his hand to the window, watching it fog up around his tiny fingers.
overhead and bellows, “Beer me!”
Dean’s jaw goes slack for a brief second before he snaps it shut. “On the mountain?” he asks, though he knows the answer.
Charlie smirks at him. “It’s a comic, but... yes, yes it is.”
Dean’s arms flop down to his sides, and he feels his face warm.
Unlike nearly every other trip Dean’s been on, this one was planned to the nines. The rental car (a freaking
Sam goes silent, and Dean feels a clench in his chest, like an arrhythmia. It’s not like he didn’t see it coming; hunters are all hero complexes, piss and vinegar - easy pickins for the Arch. And lord knows, Sam’s a damned hero if there ever was one. But—
Her voice is warm and too-soft, edged with a wistfulness that greets Dean like an old friend. “Beats me, kiddo.”
Cas jerks his chin toward the barn doors. “Your car is parked outside,” he murmurs. “I imagine you drove.”
she’d said to Dean, lying through her teeth.
Cas’ voice is low and flat, but bold, unyielding, with an almost imperceptible vein of irritation. He sounds much as he did when Dean first met him: driven and no-nonsense, all righteous fury and unshakable faith. Inhuman.
“Well,” she huffs and grabs her stein, “you’re pretty ripped.” She lets that hang for a moment, until Dean looks over at her, brows raised. “For a handmaiden,” she smirks and takes a smug pull.
He’s part way up the knoll, a little ways away from the picnic proper. From this vantage point, he can still see everyone - Mary and John on the big blanket, Ellen and Bill at the grill, Jo and her beau du jour swimming lazy circles out in the lake. Eileen sits next to Karen, both engaged in a lively discussion with Bobby, judging by the frenetic hand movements.
, it tugs at a rough-sawn edge in his chest. He thinks it might be a flower or a river. Or a cloud. Or maybe a bruise.
“You were a beacon.”
Sam huffs a short laugh. “Explains why he hasn’t stopped by for a beer.”
Sam tilts his head in a crooked nod and flips to the next page. “I was confused too,” he offers, “until I read this.” He flips the book toward Dean and taps two fingers over a block of text near the top of the page.
An image flits across his mind, and he sucks in a breath: a tiny figurine that sat on the mantel, with fluffy little wings and a crown of white roses.
Dean holds his breath and waits.
Dean hunches forward, and his stomach grumbles again. “Yeah,” he murmurs, and he feels nauseated, hollow. Too many wings, indeed.
Charlie makes an offended noise, and there’s a low thud that sounds like a book snapping shut. “Of course it’s gonna work,” she says, tone sharp with a nerdy bluster that has Dean cracking a smile. “I poured my flesh and blood and a tiny bit of weapons grade plutonium into that amulet.”
“Hey,” Charlie starts, turning briefly to glare at Dean, “Mileena’s my main, ok—”
Funnily enough, the wings in Heaven aren’t anything to write home about.
soaked through - hair plastered to your head. Barefoot.
Dean breathes out a long sigh, and his eyes fall closed. He gets that odd feeling, like something’s swelling behind his breastbone. It spreads like a weed, or a drop of blood in a puddle of water, and the whispering voice takes a breath, as if to speak.
The bell chimes again, and Cas closes the book with a careful swipe of his hand. “I have to go now,” he says, and there’s an apology in his voice, but no regret.
Castiel steps further into the weak lamplight, all squared shoulders and downturned lips. “Jack has put a great deal of faith in me,” he grunts out, voice pitched just above a growl. “I have responsibilities, Dean.”
The sky goes a shade darker, a cumulus cloud passing overhead as John whispers, “...Storm chasers.”
about its inhabitants.” He gives Dean an expectant look, brow raised and lips sucked in.
, Dean thinks as he cuts the ignition.
Dean presses his phone closer to his ear, eyes fixed on the tall, imposing doors at the top landing. “You sure this is a good idea?”
Ellen is silent for half a moment, then gives a pensive hum. He sees her hand slide along the bar toward the whisky bottle, a forgotten MacGuffin sitting half empty.
it reads
Cas frowns and shakes his head, eyebrows dropping low. “What?” he grumbles.
What do you
Heaven, Dean.”
Charlie gives him a dry look. “Dude. I’m a pasty code-jockey otaku.”
Cas’ frown persists for an instant, before it smoothes into weary resignation. He turns back toward the table, bagged eyes dropping.
“Amazing, yeah.” Sam gives him an indulgent, if mildly annoyed, smile.
Dean follows him through, boots clicking against the stone tile flooring. It’s a rustic sort of kitchen, country style, with butcher block countertops and a farmhouse sink done in etched porcelain. There’s a pretty pink apron draped over a cabinet door, and matching handtowels on the copper oven handle.
Movement in his peripheral vision has Dean looking over his shoulder toward the lanai.
Of the two of them, Dean had always known that Sam was the one who could survive on his own. He’d done it before, after all; he’d packed up, given Dean and John a bitter ‘good riddance,’ and fucked off to Stanford for
Cas turns sharply, and his book drops onto the table with a dull thud. Dean’s caught him by surprise, he realizes; though he supposes that makes sense - he’s caught himself by surprise as well. Not a moment ago he’d been stood in his modest kitchen, rifling through the cabinets in search of something he can’t remember, when a thought occurred.
“Damn,” he says, voice thick in his throat. He sniffs and blinks back tears around an open-mouth smile. “You know you ain’t gotta liquor me up if you wanna take advantage, right?”
, the text near Sam’s finger marked with a tiny superscript,
“I just wish you were happy, too,” Sam murmurs, and sets off back down the hill.
“You know,” he says, to fill the silence, “Sammy asked me if I remembered anything,” he swallows, throat dry, and looks down at his plate, “‘bout bein’ a kid.”
“Dean?” Bobby grunts, eying Dean’s suspended fist.
She definitely hadn’t mentioned any fucking
Black wings. Blue halo.
In an instant - a perfect, shining Moment that Dean thinks he’ll remember forever - he and Cas are soaked in a torrential downpour.
Heaven is warm, bucolic, and perfect. And it gives Dean the damned heebie-jeebies.
“I don’t—” Dean starts and flinches at the sound of his own voice, cracking and harsh. His bob jerks a few inches toward him, and his jaw tenses up.
John makes a little sound in the back of his throat and leans away, rustling in the bag at his side. He comes back upright, shoulder bumping against Dean’s, and holds out a bottle of El Sol.
Dean rolls his eyes and reaches for his glass. He tips the little coaster off and watches as the glass refills itself. It’s a darker orange-ish color now, rather than light blonde. He takes an experimental sniff: El Sol, this time. He feigns relief in case anyone’s looking (no one is), and peers back up at Sam.
Dean’s face cracks in a crooked smile.
In the half-light, the hills and valleys of his face are shadowed, his eyes a murky ocean blue. He’s got that look he gets sometimes: sad but...
“Oh my god,” she whispers in awe.
Sam throws him a low voltage bitch-face and runs a hand through his mussed hair. Dean smiles wider, and the twinge at the back of his skull abates.
Dean harrumphs around the tightness in his throat. “How is she?” he grunts. “Jo?”
Oh, right. This is a B&E.
Dean glances towards the window, casting his eyes out to the distant mountain - jutting up from the ground, imposing and unscalable like a border wall.
happy.”
Dean harrumphs and adjusts his seat. “I mean, I like the—” he gestures vaguely toward the window, “—the picnic weather, too, I just...” he trails off, noting Charlie’s scrunched frown, and shrugs. “I dunno. Sam says there’re storms, past the mountain.”
What is he
Mileena’s health bar drops to zero, and she sways back and forth. Dean gives Charlie a smirking side-eye.
“This isn’t my first rodeo, Winchester.”
Bobby peers over at him, frowning, then he peeks his head out from under the awning, casting his gaze inexplicably skyward. Dean follows his eyes to the clear blue sky and winces at the overbright sun. He looks away, spots dancing on his retina, and finds Bobby staring at him, eyes sharp and speculative.
“We didn’t go trick-or-treating,” he posits.
On first glance, it looks no different from any other satellite map - a blinking blue dot with his name hovering over it, little broccoli trees and crosshatch roads. But as he looks closer, he sees movement: the trees seem to sway, the shadows shift, and there’s a dancing white speck where a bird flies figure eights.
Dean feels his brow wrinkle. “Hey,” he calls, “why are your curtains closed?”
Sam looks up like he’d forgotten Dean was there, and he shakes his head. “Oh just, uh,” a dry swallow, “Eileen and I, we. We went hiking, little while back.”
Dean’s jaw goes a little slack, and for a moment, he thinks he might simply say,
This -
Twelve years.
The air catches in Dean’s throat, somewhere between a sigh and a gasp. “Cas,” he croaks.
Everyone with two eyes had seen the flickering flame between them - always teetering between roaring to life and sputtering out. In the end, he’d kissed her mouth as she lay dying, and watched her burn in salted fire. He’d soldiered on, dry-eyed and numb, and added her name to a bill he couldn’t pay.
Dean blinks several times in succession, eyes falling back to the bookmarked page.
Something sharp-edged rises in his throat, and he harrumphs around the blockage. “Yeah?”
He stares at it for another few moments. It’s eerily familiar, though he can’t place why. There’s something manifest, nearly recognizable about the handwriting.
“This is—” Cas starts, scrubbing an exasperated hand over his face. His voice is low and cracking, thick in his throat. “This is
“Judgin’ by the mopey face, I’m guessin’ that didn’t go so good,” he grumbles.
Shaded and cool, the little forest in the field is a half-lit oasis on the shining plain.
They’re huge and imposing, magnificent and a little terrifying.
Dean chews on his tongue and gives a twitchy nod. “Good for you, man,” he grunts out, peering down at his flexing hands. “I’m, uh,” he nods again, more like a shiver. “I’m happy for ya.”
Dean looks down at his hands, a little wrinkled, knuckles swollen. He hadn’t been thinking about anything, really. Matter of fact, he’d sat down on the old bench, cracked open a beer, and cast his line with the sole intention of thinking about nothing at all. Certainly not the throb in his temples that’s persisted since he made landfall here, or the way his fists clench tight when he’s not looking at them. And definitely not the fact that these forty years under Heaven’s sun feel a lot like the forty he spent in—
“Huh,” he says, and folds his arms over his chest.
Cas shakes his head and turns a page. “I’m not sure. You were here when I arrived.”
He stares down into the empty bottle, turning it between his thumb and middle finger. “So Kevin said it’s fine?” he asks. He keeps his tone mild so as not to betray his peculiar unease, but he can’t quite suppress the note of concern. “Tiny burnt forest with lightning and a creepy barn?”
again. Sometimes by the cruel will of God or Fate, sometimes at the well-meaning hands of friends and family.
Kevin hums, scribbling away.
Sam’s brow furrows deeper, and he hums, eyes cutting over to Dean.
“It’s a little funny,” Dean smirks.
There are soft sounds from the kitchen - cabinets opening, a gurgling coffee maker, a substratum of tuneless humming. Dean hunches over his plate and shovels another forkful of pie into his mouth. It’s sweet and rich, tart and crumbly, and he barely tastes it at all.
“Yeah,” Dean says, clearing his throat. “Yeah, no, I- sorry, I just, uh...”
There’s a shifting movement at the far end of the room, and Dean’s eyes snap to it. The man standing there - no, not a man, something else,
, Dean,” he growls, voice bleak and a little shaky.
Heaven. Destroyed and rebuilt til they- til they got it
Cas’ shoulders sag under Dean’s hands, just as a boom of thunder sounds. The forest darkens as a cloud thickens over head, and a bolt of lightning cracks across the sky.
She’s waiting, he realizes, for him to speak, to get there. Though where ‘there’ is, Dean’s got no damn idea.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary leans further forward, hand sliding halfway across the table.
Sam’s eyes flick open, and he chokes out a laugh - brittle and waterlogged, but unrestrained. “Yeah,” he grumbles. “Yeah, you are.”
And that’s true, too, though he’s never said it in quite those words before.
Sam turns to him with a raised eyebrow. “Being a monster?”
Any other day, the tone might’ve put Dean off. There’s something sour in it, like an uncleaned wound covered and left to fester. The unspoken plea -
The student begrudgingly helping him sort through the artifacts - a tall Asian girl with a nametag that read Sanae (though she’d introduced herself as “heck this, I’m a freaking
Dean’s head bounces in a nod, jittery with upset. He makes a broad gesture with shaking hands. “And you couldn’t have told me that sometime in the last—”
Sam notices, of course. “You alright?” he asks, dipping his head to meet Dean’s lowered eyes.
...Dean is—
Dean shifts in his seat, shoulders tightening. “She likes it?”
Dean blanches for an instant, a ribbon of shame tugging through him as the pit in his stomach gapes wider. He gives himself a little shake and smoothes his face into a crooked smile.
Dean turns to face him. “What.”
Cas sighs and hunches forward, pressing his hands flat against the tabletop. “Dean...”
Dean frowns at him. “What?” he prompts.
Dean had given a weak protest, though of course, Jack was right. That
...But he’s already said that.
Dean tips his head side to side, considering. It’s true enough, yeah, but- “I had five good years there,” he demurs, “at the beginning.”
He’d borne Cas’ handprint on his arm like a war wound - had worn it on his sleeve like some people wore their hearts. Through all the years they’d known one another, all the foiled apocalypses and paradises lost, it had never occurred to Dean that he might’ve left a mark on Cas, too - that the very touch that gave Dean a reddened handprint, might have given Cas a red right hand.
Deans hums and looks out over the inlet. He tilts his head, eyes tracking the little white bob. “Twenty years ain’t so much,” he offers. “You were in the thick of it for fifty.”
Dean snorts a bitter laugh, and sucks in his lips. He peers up at Kevin with sharp, squinted eyes.
Sam quirks a brow and tips his chin down in a nod. “Yeah. Apparently he decided he wanted to rebuild
“Keep thinkin’ so hard, you’re gonna sprain somethin’,” she says.
“Thunder shakin’ the ground,” he murmurs. “Rain comin’ down in sheets. Sky lit up like the Fourth of July, and you’re...” He chews his bottom lip, head tipping back. “You’re lookin’ right up at it,” he laughs. “Little arms out like you’re gonna take off, and...” He grins, so wide it cuts dimples into his cheeks. “And the biggest damn smile... I have ever seen.”
Dean peers over at Bobby and shakes his head, brow furrowed. “I don’t—”
His eyes follow the curves of the bottle, and he runs his tongue over his lips. “We drinkin’ slow or shootin’ like heathens?” he asks, peering up at Ellen.
into Heaven’s Library?”
. It’s a familiar expression, one Dean’s seen painted on his own face a million times over - but it ruptures something in his chest to see it on Cas.
Sam comes around and folds himself onto the bench, stretching his Clydesdale legs until the toes of his tennies peak over the pier end. He gives a little sigh, soft and pleased, and casts his eyes out over the turbid water.
“No,” Cas murmurs.
A twig cracks underfoot, and Dean looks toward the sound.
Ellen spits a laugh and turns the bottle in her hand, gravity chasing the drippage back down the neck. “Ain’t we all,” she murmurs and pops the stopper back in.
Bobby’s right, of course. Dean isn’t here to shoot the shit - if there’s even any shit to be shot. Trouble is, he’s not sure why he’s here.
There’s another one floating a few yards away - this one blue and dented, like it’s seen better days. It’s been dancing on the ripples in tandem with Dean’s for a while now. Dean could trace the shining line to the tip of its rod - he can just barely see it in his peripheral vision, lost in an amorphous shape at his side.
this. “I was thinking we could just—” he shakes his head in a spasmodic twitch, “—start fresh, right? Just- just forget the past and...”
Dean’s mouth drops open of its own volition, and he snaps it shut with an audible click. He scrubs a hand over his face, hiding the sudden warm spots.
Dean stares at him for a moment longer, considering, then takes the beer from John’s outstretched hand. He flicks off the cap with his thumbnail and takes a long pull. It’s sour and hoppy, bitter as always.
“And it’s the same reason,” Bobby says, pitching his voice above Dean’s, “you never quit huntin’.” Dean frowns at that, but doesn’t interrupt. “Same reason you—” Bobby’s jaw goes taut, tone hardening, “you died in a
Come visit me on
Dean glances at him sidelong, but Sam is looking down toward the picnic. It’s a vague sort of question - deliberately so, Dean thinks, based on the cautious tone.
Dean nods absently, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. He’s known since ‘they live over yonder’ that a reckoning would come for him and his dad. Dean just isn’t quite sure if he’s ready for whatever truth John might tell - or if he’s even inclined to listen to it.
Cas’ shoulders sag on a sigh, and he glances back up at the tree. There’s a large beehive hanging from a crooked branch overhead.
Dean’s not sure what more to say - what more he
Dean snorts. Generally speaking, that’s been Heaven’s party line as long as he’s been here. Sam, Eileen, Charlie - he’s heard them all waxing poetic about the endless font of magic and mystery that is Heaven 2.0. Everything is possible, everything is perfect - blah blah blah, gay rainbows and sparkly unicorns.
“Badaboom, right.” Dean nods around a grimace and casts his eyes about the courtyard. It’s quiet and empty, the last rays of the evening sun glinting on the white stepping stones. “And if someone from the Arch sees me?”
Sam hangs his head, hair fluttering into his face, and he looks so much like the kid Dean raised that his eyes go a little misty.
Dean blinks several times in succession.
A quietude stretches between them, peaceful but gravid. Mary tilts her head, face serene and mildly expectant, and she inches a pale hand forward on the table. His fingers clench around the little dessert fork, and he takes another bite.
Dean nods and swallows, looking down at his own hands. “Yeah, I know.” And he does know.
Dean had always thought Sanae was wrong. It wasn’t the spirit of Corinth - just a lost little kid, soul destroyed by endless tragedy.
He steps further into the study proper. There are two rows of bookshelves to his left, one directly before him, and several more a little ways down on his right. The books are all bound the same, in a deep beige leather with some sort of gold insignia etched into the spines. He doesn’t recognize the symbols, or any of the books themselves. He doubts any of them are Vonnegut.
Thing is, once he’d started walking, it hadn’t occurred to him to do anything else.
There’s movement behind Mary’s head, and Dean’s eyes snap to it.
And Kevin wanted to grow old.
Kevin huffs a dry laugh and leans back in his seat. “It’s not really,” he says, and points a finger toward another quote Dean hadn’t noticed. “That one’s a proto-Germanic joke about a walrus. And that one—” he points towards the circular one done in hieroglyphics, “—is in a pre-Sumerian language. No one has any idea what it says.”
Dean wakes up.
Dean’s eyes fall shut, and he swallows around a familiar lump in his throat.
She huffs a little laugh and shakes her head. “You loved the bees,” she counters.
...” he swallows around the lump in his throat and nods sharply. “
He inches closer, boots heavy and sticking to the ground, and tilts his head in the vague direction of the lake.
John sniffs. “Think that’s just who we are, you and me.”
Dean arches a brow, one corner of his lips ticking up. “Bit it?”
Something is...
Ellen takes a glass between her thumb and middle finger, hunching her rounded shoulders forward. “Ready to put some hair on that chest, pretty boy?”
Mary’s smile grows soft, warm like the spring air. “Mm,” she hums. “Always overgrown. Your dad never wanted to mow it.”
idea, so… No, not at all.”
Cas’ lips move like he wants to smile, but he isn’t sure how. “Dean,” he whispers, and stretches his fingers toward the hollow of Dean’s throat.
“Yes,” Cas says as he steps further away. “Burden.”
Dean harrumphs - sharper than intended from the tightness in his throat - and reaches for his beer. His stomach grumbles as he takes a gulping pull. It’s skunky and flat, bitter and watery, and he doesn’t taste anything at all.
Charlie shrugs. “Kevin said not to worry about it.”
- years. Not since its owner had bitten out a raspy ‘Don’t miss,’ and then burned alive in propane fire.
He ghosts his fingertips over the gemstones.
But he can’t stop, and he won’t turn back. Not anymore.
Cas is
“You know, your dad thought you would join,” she says with a little smile.
Dean’s eyes cut to the side, settling on John’s lax, callused hands. John’s voice is airy, a hundred years away when he continues.
Cas’ head tips forward and to the side. His shoulders rise in a deep breath. “I did tell you.”
“Look, I—” Dean starts and falters, throat going tight. His mouth is bone dry of a sudden, and he swallows reflexively. “I’m sorry about...” he trails off and waves a hand in a vague gesture. He was a dick the last time they spoke, Dean knows that now.
.” He huffs a short laugh, leaning back against the bench. “So Mary goes to the nursery, I go to your room, but...” he pauses briefly, and Dean sees his head tilt in his peripheral vision. “You’re not there.”
- looks up at him.
wanted endless spring days.
She slides three shooters across the bar in a little line. They slosh, but don’t spill, and Dean watches the tiny legs evaporate on the musty air.
Sam had been kind in his silence.
Dean stares at him, noting the faraway tone and the loose shoulders, the new laugh-line etching itself at the corner of Cas’ mouth.
Dean breathes out a sigh and approaches, grabbing the rod as he sidles onto the seat. He hunches forward and clutches at the grip, thumb fiddling with the reel. His stinging eyes trace the line up the pole and back down, the weight of John’s stare pressing on his shoulders.
Sam nods, unsurprised and unfazed. “Yeah, me neither,” he intones. His head tips back, hair catching on the splintered wood of the bench, and his eyes scan the endless blue above. “Guess there’s a lot of things I’m not ready for.”
Sam had undersold it. It wasn’t just miles of hayfields, it was a seemingly endless expanse of yellow and gold, trembling under the wind. In Heaven’s perfect visibility, there was no skyline at all - just the ever-reaching stretch of dry pastures, tapering off into the sky a thousand miles out.
Cas’ glassy eyes roll skyward and he makes an aggravated sound, splaying his hands in frustration. “Then
Dean makes a frenetic motion with the controller and goes full button mash. “You cheese Mileena! With your stupid tele-drop—”
Dean points a finger toward the script and glances at Kevin. “These wards?”
Kevin looks up at him - face blank, eyes opaque. He stares at Dean for a long moment, and whatever he sees on Dean’s face has his eyebrows rising.
He takes a long pull, eyes fixed on his little bob.
Castiel sighs, head tipping back like he’s looking to the heavens. Dean wants to laugh at the irony, but there’s something sharp caught in his throat.
Dean shakes his head - once, twice. “No?” he asks, and winces at the crack in his voice.
He reaches out a hand, brushing his fingers over the knob of Cas’ wide wrist. The contact buzzes against his skin, electric and charged. “There was rain the day I met you,” he murmurs. “Wind. Thunder.” He presses his thumb against the fragile bones on the inside of Cas’ wrist. “
, but he thinks he has enough regrets.
Dean takes a bottle from her hand, twists off the cap. “You don’t like it?”
It’s a ridiculous question, somehow loaded and stupid at the same time. He’s not seen Cas in forty -
Dean cranes his neck to read the upside down lettering, and Sam turns the book toward him.
blaring from the speakers, and throws Baby into gear.
for the Arch.”
He doesn’t argue, though -
“Why’d you quit huntin’?” he says in a rush. “I mean, after I...”
Sam nods absently, then tilts his head and squints. “Think she still knows the recipe?”
Dean shakes his head, shoulders going stiff. “So how’d you find me?” he grumbles.
Mary turns around, her eyes a little wide, eyebrows climbing toward her hairline. Dean isn’t sure why he asked. He backtraces his train of thought, only to find he hadn’t had one at all; seems he’s done his usual shtick of putting his foot in his mouth the very moment he opens it.
“Yeah,” Dean grunts and tips his head back to squint up at the sky. “Been like this since I got here. Not a raincloud in sight.”
,” Sam crows. “Literally every single—”
Dean swallows around a sudden lump in his throat. “We barely knew each other,” he grunts out.
, the screen reads.
He recalls a memorable night spent with Pamela - well, as memorable as it could be after a fifth of Macallan. Sam had said ‘So get this...’ and then fucked off to the local library, leaving Pam and Dean at the hotel bar. They’d drunk til the lights got fuzzy, and Pam had leaned back against the barstool, arching one dark eyebrow.
Dean withholds a wince at the mention of John, and a muscle twitches in his jaw. “I liked it how it was.”
It’s another stupid question, and Kevin clocks it quick. He sighs a dry laugh and snaps the book shut.
Dean clears his throat and swallows. “So.”
Sam huffs a laugh. “Shut up. It was—”
And yet.
anything—
Dean’s head snaps up, shoulders going tense. They loosen a bit as Sam slides into the other side of the booth. He’s wearing a denim button-down that Dean’s pretty sure was one of his, and his stupid hair is extra floppy. He slides his dorky messenger bag off his shoulder, settling it at his side.
, it wants to say, as if he’s got no idea. As if ‘they live over yonder’ wasn’t the first thing Bobby told him. As if Dean hadn’t picked any direction
Sam approaches with two beers in hand, sure-footed on the grassy slope. He plops himself down next to Dean, sidling closer until their shoulders press together. He gives Dean a vague half-smile and hands him a beer. It’s an uncapped green bottle with a white label and red logo. Stella Artois.

He draws back his hand, blowing out another sigh when the damned thing stays put. It’s glowing almost painfully bright now, the light leaving red spots on his retina. He peers around the landing, wondering belatedly if he should take cover.
A tiny smile pulls at the corner of Cas’ mouth. His eyes go soft in that way they do when he’s about to say something too frank, too forthright, too—
She’s staring at him, face guileless and open. There’s a spark of curiosity in her eyes, flavored with a sort of tempered sadness. But there’s no reproof, no expectation, and Dean gets the strange feeling that there isn’t a right answer. Or a wrong one.
“Yeah, well,” Dean grumbles, voice rough in his throat. “Jo’s probably the sweetest girl I ever met, but—”
Dean sucks in a sharp breath, his hand settling over his roiling stomach. “It’s the reason they hated you, isn’t it,” he whispers, and his voice cracks. “
She has laugh lines, and yellow hair, and Carolina blue eyes. And she’s looking at Dean like she’s missed him forever. Damn, if he hasn’t missed her, too.
“The forest,” she says, smoothing a finger over the lip of her glass. “I mean, not the whole thing, just a couple trees near this, like, barn thing? They were all charred.” She tilts her head, considering. “Coulda been lightning, I guess? I dunno.”
Dean watches her, the way her eyes flick back and forth, like she’s watching the scene unfold before her. There’s an ache near the center of his chest like a bruise. “I don’t remember that,” he says, voiced pitched low.
, Dean had said once, straightening Cas’ tie just to feel his throat under his fingers,
Dean’s fists clench up, and he watches with hawk eyes as the thing manifests, forming itself into a vaguely rectangular shape. He feels his lips purse tight and his spine straighten like a rod.
Cas smiles down at his feet then peers out over the water. “Yes,” he says plainly. “Even then.”
Dean stares blankly at him for a moment, then turns back to the wall. He remembers the verse now, and the bit that follows:
His hand clenches around the leather grip of the old spinning rod, its slack line dragging the bob through brackish water. The hardwood bench at his back is solid and warm, weathered a deep brown just as the pier beneath his boots. Dark water laps at the piles below - a soft susurrus to offset the chirping birds.
Dean winces hard, eyes squeezing shut for half a second. “Yeah?” he asks. His eyes flick back open, and he stares down at his plate. The wings have gone cold, the celery warm and floppy.
It’s a nice porch. The roof extends out over it, supported by weathered wood pillars, and there’s a ceiling fan turning lazily overhead. A wide bench sits a couple feet away, with horizontal wood slats and wrought iron legs, and there’s a scrap wood coffee table with a big peach-colored candle in the middle.
He’s been sat here, hands on the wheel in a stiff 10 and 2, languishing in indecision for a good while now. Though the windows are down and the visor out, he’s still sweating a wet spot onto the back of his henley, hair damp at the base of his skull.
...when he died.
“It’s—” Dean starts and frowns, askance, “...an angel?” he guesses.
His left arm had tingled at the bicep, hot and cold at the same time, buzzing along his nervous system like a shock. For an instant, he’d felt a constriction across his chest, a heavy weight at his back, as if someone were clutching him, holding him. Carrying him.
Dean shakes his head and harrumphs. “Nah,” he replies, gesturing to the old rod. “Wasn’t payin’ much attention.”
Dean feels his frown smooth into blank confusion.
Forty years, nearly half a damn century, and the sun beating down from a cloudless sky, and eaten alive by the Void, and spit back out again, and not a peep, not a word, not a goddamn whisper, save the ones in Dean’s stupid heart that shouldn’t beat anyway and he’s- Cas is—
