The two of them had been spending most of their free time together.  They had meals together and chatted about their daily lives and coworkers frequently.  It really was a nice routine they fell into, sharing everything and leaning on each other.
The sound of 35 overlapping voices became louder as Steve stepped into his dining room.  Some guests were sitting at the dining table and eating while others stood around in the corners of the room to chat.  He made his way into the living room where all his favorite people were.  Bucky sat in the middle of their giant sectional couch with Wanda next to him as he spoke with Sam and Natasha.  Happy, May, Pepper, and Rhodey were also involved in their conversation.
Slowly Steve crept into his penthouse, keeping quiet and staying low.  His Army training was kicking in as he peeked under the stair rail to scope the perimeter.  Immediately he saw the man he didn’t recognize pacing and his boyfriend sitting on a dining chair with his hands behind his back.  Steve had never seen Tony look so scared before.
Steve started to stretch too, “Yeah.  He already way too excited about it and wants to start nesting.”
“Sure, we’ll put it right in here next to the bed.” He whispered, kissing the top of Tony’s head.  He hummed in response, nuzzling his cheek against Steve’s muscular pec,“I am happy right now, for the record.  I love our new place, our new neighborhood.  I love you.”
Bucky bit into his burger, "I basically had to assure him that I knew he was scared about his surgery. I told him that making everyone else feel as bad as he did was not going to ease that fear."
“Sure thing, honey.”  Stev said.  He met Sam at the track to run.  When they finished, they grabbed lunch together at a nearby open air food market.
Steve made his way up to his old apartment in a basic blue shirt and his nice denim jacket.  For a second, he marveled at the appearance of his former home.
It was obvious Tony had just been wracking his brain all night about the possible reasons Steve betrayed him.
“Thank you.” he smiled.  May leaned toward him to add “Also this house is so beautiful!”  Steve put a flattered hand to his chest, “It was all thanks to Pepper over there.” he nodded toward her, getting her attention, “She had a friend that is a badass realtor.”  Rhodey nudged Pepper and said “Don’t tell my girlfriend that.  I’m going to catch her looking at Zillow houses as
"Wanna make you cum, Mister Stark." Steve told him in a high whine, "I want to be a good slut for you."
Tony had a heart condition due to a nasty cocaine habit in his college days.  Now he was in his late 30s, he was visiting the doctor and his home gym more frequently.  Typically he stuck to a strict diet.
Bucky huffed a laugh, “Scott likes Natasha.  He wants me to get them acquainted.”  He kept Okoye’s comment to himself, wondering if Steve would find it funny or insulting.
When Steve got the door of the apartment, he started to feel increasingly anxious.  He tried to come up with something to say to Bucky preemptively, but his mind was blank.  All he had to do was apologize for convincing (and begging) Bucky to hook up with him and then he could be moved out and give him some space.  Then they could start to heal their friendship again...hopefully.
“Steve.” he said firmly, their eyes meeting once again.  All Bucky got as a response was his friend’s expectant face.  “I think you know what almost happened yesterday.”
Visiting a medical doctor confirmed that Steve had developed more vigorous panic attacks from stress.  The doctor had to prescribe him stronger anti-anxiety medication (Steve was supposed to take them more frequently) and he had to start doing yoga and meditating as a recommendation from Sam.  Sam even starts to come over to help him, like his own personal yoga instructor.
Steve grabbed the gun and ran into the kitchen, “I’m coming...I got you.”  He grabbed a towel and banged the panic button under the kitchen counter a few times.  In a flash, Steve was over next to Frank searching his pockets for the handcuff keys.  When he found them, Steve rushed behind Tony to get off his restraints.
“We can, Steve.  We can all move on and I can move away.  Probably somewhere in New England.” responds Bucky.
Steve immediately came over to see for himself.  “I thought the cleaning team was supposed to get rid of all that!”  “Didn’t catch the spatter.” Tony laughed, pointing at the top of the dining chair.
Steve was squeezing him in just the right place to feel him shiver with every upstroke.  “I’m gonna miss this gorgeous body.”
More tears escaped Tony as he looked up at the sincere man standing above him.  Steve was still all serious and fiercely protective but also turned his face soft every time he made eye contact with Tony.  Even though he was a little dizzy, Tony reached up with his right arm and cupped Steve’s jaw.  It was obvious now that Steve’s left eye was completely swollen from being punched and would be discolored for a while.  Steve dropped one hand away from the weapon so he could face him better.
“I know we’ve been through hell today.” began Steve, speaking carefully and watching the side of his boyfriend’s face, “And I know I technically saved you, but...you know, you don’t have to feel obligated to forgive me just because I did a good deed.”
Steve keeps unpacking and re-decorating over the next few days to keep himself busy.  He goes to his first two sessions with his therapist to get to know him.
That embarrassed Steve, making his cheeks go hot. Bucky noticed and smiled to himself as he took a bite of the garlic bread he was holding.
“Then what?” sighed Steve, throwing his hands up, “I just wait around to see if I’ll be discharged and Tony’s contract terminated?  Should I look for a new job?  Fuck-”  He broke into sobs and could no longer speak.
He kept Steve’s bed, but ran to Bed Bath and Beyond to get all new bedding.  He made sure to immerse himself in video games, work, and socializing with his sister (sometimes his dad) and his coworkers.
“I mean, he knows I got an extension.  He’s trying, Tony.  Bucky only just got a job.  You said you understood that you can’t rush these things.” said Steve, turning to him with his brows furrowed.  He was standing only in his white shirt and boxers.
“That’s good.” Tony told him, still keeping his tone happy. “I mean, does it bother you that he is in a relationship overall?”
Steve stared at Frank, disgusted.  “All that because you didn’t get my job?  You could have gotten it after I left.”  “Well I can’t!” scoffed Frank.
Wanda visited and brought home made food.  She said it was something everyone in her family did when someone was going through something.  It was about 18 servings of a white wine mushroom lasagna.  They had to eat it for days.
The mechanic engineer had a 3 story apartment with 5 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, the top floor was open and also Tony’s home lab/gym.
“No, no...I can make time.” said Steve softly, taking off his hat.  “Look, you waited for me out here.  Why don’t we go inside?”
Steve joined them in the living room, looking nervous.  Tony took his leave and the bedroom door shut behind him.
Tony laughed and apologized.  “I do want to pick out some things together though.   We could make a space that’s ours.  I’m excited, okay?”
wrong?” Tony asked, “What does this have to do with me?”  He was trying not to let himself cry from fear.
They had been friends since they were 13, Steve only wished he would keep in touch and stop getting into terrible relationships like a never ending cycle.
As Bucky was seeing him out, he opened his arms to hug his old friend.  Marco smiled and confidently pulled his face into a very sultry kiss.
Steve wrote back that he would be going to the store soon and asked if he had any preferences for dinner.  “Not really.  They did end up keeping my contract, by the way.” wrote Tony.
Tony squatted down next to him, wearing his wife beater and boxers.  “I know how it feels but like I said, I’m here.”
“Well, at least you have a dad.” Steve said sincerely, looking at his feet, “Just try to make your peace with him while he’s still alive.  He’s the only parent you have.”
Bucky is at home on his day off, cleaning the apartment and hanging black out curtains.  A text comes through on his phone from Marco that says “I’m close by.  Be there soon!”
Natasha brushed her hand through her hair, “No, but thank you.  I think I could have some fun with him.  Let’s see how much free shit I can get.”  She started to busy herself with chugging down her drink.  She noticed it was grey goose, not the cheap shit, so it was actually so much SMOOTHER.  (Especially since it was free.)
“Really, I mean it.” said Marco, “I could have protected you better.  I could have stopped him from-”
“There are about 4 markets within walking distance but if you buy too much, there is a brilliant delivery service, you recall.”
Exhaling his smoke, Bucky looked confused then followed Steve’s line of vision to the man sitting to the right of him.
Steve's voice wavered as he looked up from his lap and quickly wiped his falling tears.  “I guess I’m not going to work tomorrow either...so I have nothing to really keep me occupied and no boyfriend for 4 days.”
Steve’s face dropped.  “It’s not that I’m jealous of how you spend your time, Buck.  I’m not trying to tell you who to hang out with.  I just feel like the timing here is...odd.  Or, I’m being selfish.”
“Stop feeling sorry for me.  You know I hate that.” it was obvious Bucky was holding back a sob as he said that.
Tony was not around when Steve arrived but his assistant, Pepper, was sitting on the living room sofa doing work on a tablet.
“I didn’t say that.” said Tony, shaking his head, “I said I was betrayed.  You can get another chance with me.  That will be the last fucking one.  Understood?”
Saying nothing, Tony went to the kitchen area out of sight.  Glass clinking noises started to drift into the living room.
A swift silent nod came from Bucky as he chewed.  His hair was half up in a hair band and he was in a red henley shirt.  Steve kept looking him over with approval, telling himself that it was just because he was dressed nice to get hired.
Steve kissed his chest here and there before laying his head on the man once more.  They sat there listening to the city outside for a few hours, just enjoying each other’s embrace.
Steve made himself a tofu rice bowl and as he finished eating, Bucky came out dressed like a fancy rockstar with his hair up halfway.  He smelled like heaven.  (More like Acqua Digio cologne.)
They ate silently for a few minutes.  Bucky sipped his coffee until his head was clear.  “Are we okay?”
Steve was handed a flute of champagne, Tony was holding one too.  “Are we toasting to something-” Steve started to say, stopping when he noticed something at the bottom of his glass.
Steve immediately flushed and walked quickly and quietly into his bedroom to get the hamper of dirty towels.  He ran through his kitchen to the laundry closet.
Eventually Tony had come in the bedroom and heard him sniffing.  There was a soft knock at the door.  “Hey babe?  You alright?”  Steve cleared his throat, “Yeah, just feeling too deep in my thoughts.”  He washed his face, brushed his teeth, and stripped off his shirt so he was only in his pajama pants.  They both got in bed together and Tony pulled Steve to lay his face on his chest.
When Steve was noticed, a random woman got up out of one of their area chairs facing the sofa to let him sit there.  Bucky smiled at him, “You’re back!  I just tried some of your crab dip, it’s amazing.”
A sigh erupted from Bucky as he put down his coffee and ran a hand through his hair, “Yeah, you did...for only like a minute.”
Immediately Bucky was reminded of how much he missed scotch and how he wished he could be drinking with him.
Steve was taking off his shoes at the door, “Of course.  I will always be here to help, Buck.  Plus you showed up literally at my doorstep.  I didn’t have much of a choice.”
Steve pulled back to smile at the man in his arms.  They were embracing and swaying.  “Surprised?” Tony laughed.
“You took jobs from me ever since you started at that base.  Those jobs belonged to me.  I applied for them right beside you and you kept snatching them over and over.  Then you got your cushy desk job and I ended up an IT bitch.  All because you saw more combat than me!  They felt sorry for you.”
Steve arrived home with 2 cloth grocery bags full of food and went to open the front door with his key as usual.  As he stuck in his key, it was alarming to Steve that the door was left unlocked.  That door was definitely locked when Steve left and Tony ALWAYS locked it as soon as he crossed the threshold.
Bucky shrugged, “You weren’t really walking on your own.  In the cab you were fading in and out.  Kept asking for sub sandwiches like I had them in my back pocket.”
“Maybe that’s best.” agreed Bucky, “I’m trying to get someone to hire me.  I can’t do that if they think I’m an emotional disaster.”
The look on Steve’s face turned to anger, “He’s not fucking doing that.  We’ve always been there for each other.”
Surprisingly, Tony slid down to his knees on the rug.  Steve moved to the edge of the bed to plant his feet on the floor.  Noticing the older man cry, he opened his arms and let Tony slide between his legs to hug him at the waist.
“So do you, and quite well.” Steve breathed in his ear deeply.  He ran his hands down his legs slowly, moving toward his dick.
“Thanks again for cooking.  This is a great brunch.” Bucky complimented, trying to get him to feel better.
It impressed Steve as well as turned him on even more to hear the dirty talk grumbled into his ear.  Usually he would have to ask.  “I…shit...love
“Hey.” nodded Steve, looking at him cautiously.  He couldn’t tell if it was appropriate to go in for a hug.  “Uh, come in.”
Sure, he got some rest after the drive in but it wasn't enough. Bucky just chose hanging out with Steve instead of going back to bed.
Of course he didn’t want to seem like he was trying to make Bucky look BAD, Steve just didn’t want him to jump into something new, with his friend, and break his own heart again.
“It’s not cheap.” said Steve, looking worried, “And it’s not easy to just find somewhere else in New York City in the middle of Christmas time.”
Steve chuckled a little, “You already want to get furniture together?  Tony, there is nothing wrong with your bed.”
Bucky had been going out with the couple for dinner and having them over to watch random sports.  He was joining Steve, Wanda, and Natasha every week at karaoke, never once offering to actually sing.
“Right.  I won’t hold this offer against you later.  I’m sorry I did that before.” said Tony, kissing his shirt covered pecs a few times.
Tony’s hands gripped the tall man’s ballerina hips as he stared up at him, “Mmm,” he cooed, “I wish I could have a sleepover with you tonight, sweetheart.  I’d love to kiss every inch of you right about now.”  He gave his boyfriend a few pecks on the side of the neck.
“Sure!  I’ve just been spending all my time with the kids lately.  They’ve been on spring break the past two weeks, so there have been a ton of like, full day classes.”
“Absolutely.” Tony said enthusiastically.  “That man’s been doing just about everything but wiping my ass and I’m sure he would if I asked.”  A little laugh escaped him at that last statement.
Steve sprung awake defensively, a reflex left over from the military.  He was lying on his back and trying to sit up, but the weight of his boyfriend prevented him.
“You’re the only one that noticed.” said Marco, getting his eyes back up to meet his, “I’ve missed you.”
After they ate and binge watched almost 4 hours of the show, they got ready to sleep in the gigantic bed Tony bought for them.
“Hopefully I can find a place with chill coworkers.”  he said,  fidgeting and scratching where his prosthetic met his skin.
Scott nudged him, “Don’t listen to her.  I would definitely tap that Nat girl.  She is SO into you.”
Bucky’s blue and grey eyes stared straight through him.  He started to notice the formation of what hit him in the bruise around his temple.
“Come get me then!” laughed Steve over his shoulder as he ran just ahead of him.  It was foggy that morning in the light of the barely rising sun.
Chuckling to himself, Bucky thought for a second before answering.  “I guess it was the few times I ran to him after fights with Mads.  The first time, I was angry.  He hugged me to calm me down.  No one had ever done that.  It just felt good because he understood how to comfort me.   Also he saw what was wrong with her too...but still he sided with me.”
“Bring Tony.”  Natasha said, “Oh, and Bucky if you want!  I’m dying to meet him.”  walking backwards until they exited.
They smiled at each other softly as a piano player in the center of the dining room began to play a soft jazz song.
Bucky hated to admit that he was a little relieved that there was no memory of who he kissed.  “Don’t even worry about it, Steve.  I encouraged you to leave after so it was all okay.”
Bucky pulled his fingers out and delved in with his mouth one more time, as deep as he could manage.
Tony gave him a sudden warning of “I’m going to-” before filling him up, pausing with his thrusts and stilling inside him.  Steve cried out with each thrust until Tony paused and bent forward to kiss him.
The phrase being repeated to him yet again that afternoon had Bucky feeling dazed.  He still couldn’t believe it was coming out of the other man’s mouth so effortlessly.
Frank seemed to come up a little closer behind him, “I was appointed actually to give him a gift from his coworkers.  They wanted to give it to him at the base, but he never had a last day or anything.”
Also: try to remember that I am a real person. Remember to look through the tags before you start reading. If this fic makes you upset, it wasn't meant to.   Hate/threatening comments toward me as a person over a FICTIONAL story about people that do not exist are not welcome and will be filtered out.
Steve realized they were going into his own bedroom.  The windows closed but the blinds were open against the sheer blue curtains, putting a frosty hue on the room.
“Wanda and I were going to invite you to a concert we got tickets for.  I kind of invited Bucky already.” she grimaced.
The coffee pot dinged and Bucky poured the hot liquid into his mug.  He blew on it a little and took a few sips before sitting next to his friend.
The bar itself was wrapped around them on 3 sides in a U shape.  The rest of the place was pretty open with a few small tables here and there.
"This is not up for debate.  You and I should give each other space.  We can't be trusted together anymore.” said Bucky sternly.
“No, but I feel it.” Steve laughed and turned a little to start kissing the older man’s much scruffier cheek.  With ease, Tony turned his head to connect their mouths and started to kiss him sloppily as water cascaded over them from all sides.  Instinctually, Steve started to thrust his ass back against him.
“I want to believe I’ll be okay.” he mumbled, staring down at the floor, his hands holding onto his hips.  “I just feel like I’m being attacked for who I’m with.”
Steve turned to look at him through the glass door over his shoulder.  Tony was already shirtless and starting to take off his pants.  “Shit.” he groaned, echoing against the tile and marble counters “I can’t fucking handle you at this angle.”
“We usually save the wild ones for Christmas and Halloween.” smirked Steve, “Our friends are pretty relaxed though.  They’d love to meet you.”
Bucky even hugged Steve and Tony before he left that night, texting Natasha immediately to tell her the good news.  She expressed her happiness for them.
“We met at Natasha’s party.  He talked to me about tech all night, remember?” said Tony, trying to focus on anything but the burn in his arm.
“Tony…?” Steve asks softly.  Tony whips around to face him angrily and roughly wipes his tears away with the back of his hand.  The older man calmed his breath and stomped (around the broken glass) back over to the bed.  He stood next to it so as to tower over Steve.
“Yeah, I’ve been watching a lot of Queer Eye, what can I say?” laughed Bucky.  The two men sat on the couch at opposite ends.  Bucky put on some soft rock music on his new sound system.  “So what’s been going on with you guys?”
They had been together for 2 years, soon becoming the longest relationship either of them had ever had.
Bucky’s hair was half tied up in the back and his tufts of hair hung around his face delicately.  He was wearing a loose black shirt and jeans.
Steve nodded and told him he understood.  They compromised on trying to get Tony to just boss him around next time and use his words to dominate him.
I love and appreciate any readers if they want to give their opinion. Just relax, it's all fictitious.
Tony got to the Army base and was patted down upon arrival.  Pepper has asked to come with him, but he’d insisted he had to go alone for this.  He was given a visitors badge then was escorted by two armed guards to a private meeting room.
They cleaned up and held each other close, still naked and groping and kissing every piece of exposed skin.  Whispers of “I love you.” and “I love you more.” rang out in the dark bedroom until they both fell asleep.
They danced for hours, Bucky drinking water in excess from the sweating and taking smoke breaks when Steve would dip off to the bar for more drinks.
Glancing down at his phone, Steve noticed a text from Tony that said “Hope you’re having fun, baby!  I love you.”
Bucky went up to Tony, “Hey man, I just want to thank you for all you are doing for me.  I honestly can’t describe how much I appreciate it.”
When their eyes met, Steve’s were filled with anxiety and fear.  Bucky tried to keep a light hearted tone to calm him.  “You look a bit bulkier.  You got a gym here?”
As soon as Natasha comes back she puts 3 unopened bottles of o'douls non-alcoholic beer in front of them.  “Thanks.” smiles Scott, “That’s really nice of you.”
Steve held his friend’s eye, really trying to come up with something encouraging to say.  Any nice words about Wanda or expressing his support would have been appropriate.
Bucky moved his air mattress in the room right before he left.  That was going to be his new room once Steve left.  It had a nice floor to ceiling window in the middle of the wall, so he liked the view.
Steve noticed that the footage started to change into the ambulance arriving at the hospital and Tony being wheeled inside.  There were slideshows of pictures of Frank and Steve’s own image even flashed across the screen.
Steve felt bad for never really asking about Bucky’s mental health after they both returned from war.
Bucky was being rude and almost unapologetic so that Steve would be offended instead of seeing any of his desire reciprocated.  It was a typical thing Bucky did to needy people he fucked in High School and College/The Military.  Be a dick so they leave you alone.
It was very obvious that he showed up to Steve’s building and slept there in the hallway most of the night waiting for him.
There was an encouraging nod from him to indicate that Bucky could keep speaking.  “It takes two people to cheat and I definitely shouldn’t have encouraged it.  It wasn’t right to you or Steve.  I am a fucking asshole for doing that to you when you helped me so much and have been nothing but nice to me.”
Bucky wasn’t one to know how to take compliments.  He just laughed uncomfortably and let his hair fall back over his eye.  “Well thanks.”
His expression changed from irritation to sympathy when he saw Steve.  “Baby.” he breathed, sounding exasperated.
It was just lit enough.  Bucky toppled them both down onto the bed so that he could lay half on top of Steve’s broad chest.  His leg swung over the blonde’s hip.
A few more tense silent minutes went by before Tony sat up straight to speak.  “I think the Army is going to keep my contract.”  That statement confused his boyfriend.
He felt guilty since Bucky looked scared to death.  Steve worried that his one scotch and frazzled emotions made it seem like he was forcing himself on his best friend.
Steve looked up at Tony to see if he heard her comment.  Sure enough Tony was staring at him  from the left side of the bed.  He definitely heard, but his face was neutral.  “If you could.  Thanks.” replied Steve.
"Brunch," he corrected, "I want to see you as early and long as possible. I have to pop into the lab for inspections tomorrow evening."
“Great, right now.” nodded Steve, “Yeah, I feel like he’s actually starting to trust me again.  I haven’t even needed my meds over the past few months.”
This was it.  Steve started to prepare himself for the ass kicking he rightfully deserved.  He’d probably be kicked out at least for the night and have to go maybe stay with Natasha or Sam.  Then he’d have to explain what happened to Sam possibly.
Steve’s phone started to ring.  He took it out to see it was Natasha.  Tony told him to answer it.  “Hey Nat.” said Steve as he answered.
Other than hanging out with his friends, Tony immersed himself in work.  His young new intern, Peter, was starting to stay later and later when he noticed the change in his mentor’s work schedule.  Peter was an adorable junior in college, a crisp 20 years old.
Steve became nervous and started to tiptoe toward him cautiously, wishing he had brought his firearm with him the night before.
“We are celebrating tonight at a 5 star restaurant, you know you can’t get me worked up.”  He tried to sound stern, but his face was playful.  Steve adjusted his slacks a little.
“Pretty good.” Tony nodded, adjusting his arm sling, “Steve’s been feeding me mostly vegan.  He said I need the vitamins for healing.  Other than that, just working from home and trying to build up my strength.”
Bucky looked up from touching his toes, “In Brooklyn?  Permanently.  I just need a job...and a phone...and a place to live.”
The typing dots started to pop up then disappear then pop up again.  She finally sent, “I mean, I know you guys had a fight right before you took over his place.”
Huffing and puffing about his best friend’s pep talk, Tony said “I am definitely letting him know this shit won’t fly with me.  I just...we are serious, I can’t give up at the first red flag.”
“Stevie.” Bucky said again, stroking his hair to try to get him to make eye contact.  “You believe me, punk?”
“Well, I’m going to a party at my friend Natasha’s place.  She invited you and Tony, if you’d like to come.”
His body relaxed under the smaller man.  Steve leaned up and kissed the top of his head then fell back into a peaceful slumber.
Tony got in the car with Pepper and Happy started to drive them to her place to drop her off.  He was feeling pretty gross about taking money from people who fucked his man over and gave him such bad personal issues that he needed to seek therapy.
When there was no movement, Steve shuffled into the living room and got comfy on the sofa.  He stared at the ceiling, sniffling to himself and overanalyzing their fight.
It was important that Steve kept his breath quiet while he made his plan of attack.  He didn’t even close the door yet to keep quiet.  Carefully he sat down the bags of groceries on the floor and went back to watching the intruder.  Steve scanned him to notice the man was brandishing a gun.  Steve’s gun was in his bedside drawer.  All he had was his pocket knife and his reflexes.
They went out to put in applications.  After a few hours, Bucky got back to the apartment with 3 interviews already lined up.  (The other places seemed wary of a one-armed bartender.)
“Been here and there.” Natasha shrugged,  turning to him, “Tinder cruising...hanging out with Wanda.  Been going to Bucky’s bar to hang out sometimes.”
“These things happen.” said Steve, shaking his head with more tears appearing, “No one is out to get me.  I keep to myself.”
“M’kay.” Steve nodded and went straight to their state-of-the-art rainfall shower with tons of wall jets and cut on the hot water.  As he sat down his leftover coffee and started to remove his clothes, his thoughts turned back to Bucky.  He tried to block it out, the doubts, the concern if Wanda was right for his friend.  He loved Wanda, it wasn’t like she was a bad person.
He still hadn’t told him about the situation with his job but he decided to mention it to Tony when he saw him.
Rhodey was pacing around his living room with his hands on his hips, “So what’s your plan?  Avoid him to death while staying in a relationship with him?  What’s the point of that?  Did you ask him if he had feelings for his friend?”
“You got it.  I’ll be back by the afternoon.” Steve assured him, sharing a few more lingering kisses.
Suddenly Bucky said “You took the news of my relationship better than Marco did, believe it or not.”
Steve crossed his arms, “Those things are such a rip-off though, Tony.  You end up paying about 30 dollars more for no reason.”
tell each other everything.  We always agreed on one thing since day one and that was transparency.”
Sinking low into the couch, Steve said “Oh, that...I mean, we were drinking.  That’s why we got the hotel.  I don’t really remember it that much.”
The driver dropped him off around the corner from his place on the sidewalk.  He went around to pull out his key and unlock his mailbox near the front door.  As Tony pulled out the package, he noticed a guy leaning against the building between the garage entrance and the mailboxes.
Steve put one of his out feet behind him to steady them both and moved his hands, interlocking his fingers behind Bucky’s neck.
Bucky paused and looked at her in disbelief, "He's known me for half his life.  He IS fond of me, as a friend.  A best friend."
"As far as I'm concerned, we can have 4 houses and you never have to go back to work again. Just teach some art classes if you enjoy it." Tony said in a sultry tone, staring at his man’s adorably surprised face.
At first Steve was reluctant, saying they were technically coworkers. Tony assured him he was only there maybe 4 times a year for maintenance.  He was a glorified handyman or an IT guy, completely compliant with the base employee rulebook.
Tony scooted over immediately and put his hand around his lover’s tiny waist,  “You look...fucking delicious.”  He licked his lips as he smelled the fancy cologne Steve had on,  smelling like sex in a new car.
She hugged him and kept rubbing circles on Steve’s back.  “Sweetie, I love you.” says Natasha sweetly.
The good news was, he had gotten the job at Painting and Pinot with a schedule of 4 evenings a week.  It was shitty part-time pay but he was kind of living his dream as an art teacher and he would get tipped by drunk ladies from time to time.  They would comment on how he was so handsome and slip him cash to “buy himself something nice”.
“Morning.” Steve nodded, putting down the bag of bagels and two coffees on the area table.  He offered Bucky’s black coffee to him wordlessly and sat down.  When Bucky grabbed it, he opened the top to blow on the hot liquid.
“You don’t have to.  What else would I do with them?  Let them collect dust somewhere or donate them.” insisted Steve.
As Steve appeared in the dining room with fresh clothes and wet hair slicked back, Bucky was snapped out of his thoughts.
I hope you enjoyed this.  PLEASE give me your comments.  I will love one or 2 words.  Even an emoji will do.  You're beautiful!
Ultimately, he started to accept that his secret shame was eating him up on the inside.  It had been almost a month of no communication with Bucky.  Tony would ask why he wasn’t hanging out with him anymore and Steve said he was working too much but would admit that he missed his best friend.  Having him back in his life was so nice until he took it too far.
The blue eyes drifted up to meet Tony's, “Tony, hun,  I’m not...upset anymore and it’s not what you think.”  The older man’s face was still friendly as he urged him to explain.
Bucky turned in toward him and extended his arm over Steve’s hip.  He buried his face in Steve’s collar and cried once more.
When he would come home from his shifts, Steve would usually find a hot meal waiting for him.  He’d done most of the grocery shopping and would give Tony the recipes he found.  They would always be cooked to perfection.
Over all, the Army had decided to honor the contract and keep him as web security.  He scoffed at them, “You made me wait for weeks then come all the way down here just to tell me to keep going as usual.”
“I’m definitely relaxed right now.” smiled Tony, tipping his head back.  Steve washed his hair, then his boyfriend returned the same treatment.  When the two of them dried off, they ended up lying naked in bed, cuddled up under the covers with some food competition show on TV.  Steve had his head resting on Tony’s pec while the older man stroked his back with his right hand.
“No,” said Steve, looking up with worried brows, “I really am sorry for all of this...I shouldn’t have suggested it or encouraged it to go on for so long, any of it.”
When Bucky took a deep breath, he exhaled pure defeat. He made this conversation happen. Time to open up.
“Shit.” Bucky murmured under his breath, picking out a button down shirt and a sweater to go over it.  He put his hair back in a low ponytail at the base of his neck and went into the bathroom to wash his face.
Steve looked over his bruised face, noticing his black eye was starting to look even darker purple than it did that morning.  Pretending not to notice, he suggested “There are plenty of bars, grocery stores that need overnight stock people.”
Immediately the two men could tell that Marco was crying and trying to hold back the shaking in his voice, “James-”
“That is possible.” said Tony, sounding kind of high strung, “Do you have any idea who that might be?  Anyone at all?”
Laughing, Steve replied, “I guess...you know you can’t solve all our problems with money and sex right?”
She nodded and started to wander around the closet to ogle Tony’s nice things.  “Has therapy been helping you though?”
When he entered the bedroom, the brunette was curled up asleep in bed with all the lights off and a pillow and spare blanket was thrown on the floor near the door.
It was dusk when Bucky woke up.  Steve was in his office reading a history book when his friend wandered in rubbing his eyes.
Immediately, Tony screamed in pain, getting their attention.  Steve looked up at him, panicking and seeing the blood start to form on Tony’s sleeve near his left bicep.  Keeping his eyes on his boyfriend, Steve retaliated and jumped Frank to put him in a chokehold.  They struggled violently until finally, Frank was unconscious.
Steve took a deep breath and wiped his tears while staring at the front door, “I wanna tell Tony.  I need to.”  He had a drunken mumble to his voice and most of his words were slurred together.
“Nah, since Mom died, old George Barnes wants nothing to do with his fuck-up son.  Becca went and got married to some douchebag Republican.  I think she is trying to start a family right now.  Got no time for her loser big brother.  I should probably get a new phone so I can at least reach her on Facebook probably.”
When the party was in full swing, Steve was in the kitchen, replenishing different dishes and refilling the sangria pitchers.  Tony came sauntering into the kitchen door with a glass of drained sangria in his hand, “There you are, baby.  Quit being a busybody and go talk to people.”
When the brunette man came out in the living space, Steve was sitting on the couch, using the smart remote to pick out a show.
Steve buried his face into the pillows to scream again.  He was slightly shorter than Tony but definitely thicker.  It burned in the best way.
By the time Bucky was calm and his face was back to a normal color, it was time for Tony to show up.  Steve had to change into a red T-shirt since Bucky’s tears had soaked it all down the front.
Steve sat shirtless in his and Tony’s bed while he listened to Tony shower.  They had talked late into the evening about the convention until they fell asleep.
“Apparently it’s benign.  He’s going to have surgery soon.  Becca asked me to come visit before then.  They were going to have a cookout.”
"I offered my hand to you when you were in the Hospital.” Steve told him in a stern tone.  He gave his recollection with slight irritation.
Tony threw his hands in the air, “What do you want me to do?  Sit around and wait for something you agreed to weeks ago?  Want me to just go back to sleeping in my lab so I don’t have to think about how much I miss you every night?  It’s worse than before Bucky even showed up.”
When they got their waters, coffees, and usual food orders, Steve noticed Bucky tucking his hair behind his ear.  The movement made Bucky’s black eye completely exposed.
Steve tilted his head to make eye contact.  He reached up with one hand and pulled the brunette into a few short kisses.  “You’re not a bad guy, Buck.  I wouldn’t love you if you were.”
“If he is not there for you to entertain, you should bring that cute ass over to my place tonight and stay over.”
The blonde man stood and went to grab two glasses containing a pink and icy beverage with fresh strawberries floating on the top.  He came back into the room to hand one to Bucky.  Tony was holding one too as he sat on the sofa.
He got acquainted with his new coworkers, his black eye completely healed, and he didn’t have to pay Tony back for his shiny new work clothes.
“I figured it had to be that.  Do you want to talk about it?  You know you can trust me.” she said, rubbing his back.
Tony awoke in the middle of the night because he was chilly.  He noticed a certain giant soldier was missing from his arms and the bed entirely.  When Tony sat up to peer in the bathroom, it was dark and quiet, leaving him to wander barefoot through the penthouse.  He saw a light coming from up the stairs in the home office/gym and went up to join him.
Bucky was making notes of where they should stop and put in applications when a slew of texts started coming in.
Steve tried to avoid asking him what was going on outright.  “Well what about your family back in Indiana?  Have you thought about going to visit them?”
Tony squinted at the light of the sun streaming through his windows, the blanket still pulled up to his chin.
The rest of their friends made their way over to the hotel to visit.  Pepper had to be snuck in through the garage since the paps knew who she was.
A metallic song was blasting from his “Stark pod” speaker.  Steve was chuckling at the sound of his boyfriend singing along.
“I’ve missed you,” typed Steve, “Missed having you around.  I know we can’t just fix our friendship immediately, but I hope you and I can start the process.  I want you to be happy and not push me away anymore.”
Eventually skipping breakfast caught up with them and they did have to get Chinese food delivered.  Of course they ate in bed and put on some music then cuddled and fooled around for the rest of the day.
Lately they’d been spending most of their time in the suite, hanging out in front of the TV.  They started a series together about superheroes and both would work on their tablets while discussing the show, just like their old routine.
“I guess so.  For something that keeps coming up in my life over and over, no matter how much I try to get rid of it.”
Scott gave a container of dirty beer mugs to the barback, “You want to be more than friends with her?”
Tony scooted around so he could prop up his bad arm and face Bucky properly.  “So...would you like to discuss the apartment matters first or the...other thing?”
“It’s alright, Tony.” promised Steve, staring at the spot on Frank’s forehead where his gun was pointed.
Tony seems dumbfounded.  Steve stepped between them, “I hope you get the help you need Frank, but I doubt they’re even going to let you plead insanity over this.”  Pointing at Tony, he continued, “You just shot one of the richest men in Manhattan.  You’ll be looking at attempted murder.”
“I can afford it.” smiled Tony, “It’s okay baby.  This place is paid off, and you’re worth it.”  He cupped Steve's cheek.
Tony kissed him again, more gentle this time, “I love you.”  They stared into each other's eyes before a gravelly voice stole their attention.  “Gonna make me sick.” Frank said, looking at them smugly.  His lip was bloody and both sides of his jaw were bruised.
Tony heard the muffled retching noises and sauntered in to make sure Steve was alright.  Steve was shaking as he hovered over the toilet on his knees.  His back was spasming as he held back gags.
Tony was shirtless in his own boxer briefs.  Looking down, he wiped stray droplets of water off his chest, “I mean, if we don’t give him a timeframe this thing is never going to happen.”
Natasha suddenly looked bubbly and happy, “You know who could help us eat it?  Wanda!  Would you mind if she came over?”
Like Steve didn't have enough problems?  Now he was going to think he couldn't trust Bucky to not take advantage of his fragile state.
Who knew if it would end that way if something did start up between Bucky and Natasha?  It just didn't seem like a good idea to encourage them.  (Even if Bucky was already masturbating to her.  So them hooking up seemed inevitable.)
“Well, I hate to tell you this but I always planned on going back to doing some kind of artistic work.” Steve said, “I was thinking of teaching painting classes to children at the community center.  You know my favorite nights at work were always with the kids and it doesn’t pay much but it’s fulfilling.”
As Bucky waited, he couldn’t help but feel a little aroused.  Even though there was no promise of what would happen, Marco
Steve laughed, “I mean...I don’t know.  This is the first real relationship with a man I have ever been in.  I don’t really know how all that is supposed to work.  Also I’ve never been with someone long enough to even consider marriage.  I guess...I haven’t thought about it at all...”
Bucky showed up to their suite in a full (depression) beard with his hair partially pulled up and his heavy winter coat on.
It breaks Bucky’s heart.  “Fuck,” he whispered, “I don’t want to be like this.  I don’t want you to feel worse.  I just...don’t know how else to get my point across.  You make me weak.”
“I just...ate a big meal then fell asleep.” Bucky said weakly, adjusting his t-shirt, “That causes nightmares sometimes.”
As soon as the door closed, Bucky burst into laughter and Okoye came over to investigate to get in on the joke.  She then high-fived Natasha.
“Must have…” said Tony, pouting as Frank’s gun went right back to being angled towards his head, “slipped my mind.”  As soon as Frank’s attention was on Tony, Steve threw his knife to hit the man’s forearm.  It connected to the meat in his arm with a *thwack*, making him drop the gun.
Giving a shrug, Steve said “If by laugh you mean cry like a fucking teenager.”  He sniffled for emphasis.  Bucky pouted, “Want me to suck you off or something to make you feel better?”
The brunette man took the glasses over to the sink and grabbed them two new ones, heading over to the liquor shelf.
“I’m putting the space between us to see if it’s possible to live without him in my life.  I’ll decide eventually if I can’t do this anymore, okay?  I promise.  And I did ask him, but he didn’t say.” said Tony, looking up at him pitifully.
“What?  No, she just...doesn’t ever commit.  Wanda hasn’t had a real boyfriend since she was in college.”
“Walk, please.” Frank said, smiling and sounding friendly, “Make sure you are cool for your cameras.”  He ushered Tony inside to the elevator.  They rode up to Steve and Tony’s floor.  Immediately Frank spotted the next camera, positioning himself casually next to Tony.
Steve’s friend Sherry and her wife were sitting in the two lounge chairs next to them so they started to talk.
Steve was organizing the home office while they chatted.  Natasha was sitting at his desk chair and swaying around when she realized his playlist of songs currently playing on his computer were all sad Sia songs.
“Nah, I go back in on Saturday for the closing shift.” he replied without looking up from his rice he was cooking.
They went inside and Steve turned on the light above his tiny round dining table.  He had a mostly open floor plan so the light brightened up most of his living room, kitchen, and dining room.
Tony nodded and tossed the Smiths shirt back into the closet, "Prince of Darkness, always a good choice."
“I did, and I am glad.” he responded, “I have been avoiding both of them.  Won’t they be mad at me?”
“Dad’s got cancer and it’s causing him to have other health problems.  My mom passed from cancer a while ago.  If something happens to him, I’ll only have my sister, really.  We didn’t associate with our distant family much growing up.”
Looking over him, the blonde man asked “Do you want to come to counseling with Sam and I this week?”
Steve held his own coffee as he stared up at him.  The sounds of the city were loud since it was a bustling Saturday morning.    “Sleep okay?” asked Steve finally.
“You would have flown home early and missed your work at the conference.  I’ve been keeping busy.  I’m okay.”
Bucky sat in the chair farthest away from him and began to eat.  Steve took the opportunity to do so as well.  They ate in silence, calming them down for the moment by doing something innocent and normal.
Tony glanced around the apartment approvingly, “This is a beautiful place you got here.”  He gently let go of her hand.
Steve pulled out the embrace to stare at him lovingly, “Tony, that’s sweet but I couldn’t ask you to take care of everything plus therapy.”
Almost giving in, Bucky abruptly pulls back and sets his half empty coffee on the end table.  “Alright, stop.  Just let me go.”
Sam was already there, leaning against the trunk of his car when they arrived.  He looked over Bucky with concern when they got out of his own vehicle.  It was only because of the brunette man’s very dark and obviously fresh black eye.
Bucky forced a fake smile and adjusted himself to sit up straight, “I uh...just missed you.  Thought we should catch up.”
Bucky looked over the side of his friend’s face carefully, searching for any hint of regret or embarrassment about his actions while he was drunk.  “I only reheated  meatballs.”
The party had thinned out quite a lot and Steve went over to Bucky to ask if they could go home.  He was talking to Natasha and Clint at the dining table.
“We’ve both been having bad dreams and are both in therapy." Tony said, "Don’t you think moving back in here is going to make it worse?”
The whole week Steve did keep in touch with Tony, but only through text messages.  The businessman was far too preoccupied to even get to facetime his boyfriend once.
The man had his head down and his knees curled up to his chest, therefore Steve couldn’t tell if he was sleeping or not.  He lived in a building with a buzzer door, but it was busted sometimes and his older more senile neighbors were trusting enough to let people in from time to time.
“Yeah, we were in the war together so we’ve been through a lot.  I don’t know, I guess I’ll let him stay temporarily.”  Steve decided.
Tony managed to pause and ask “So, you don’t want the chicken anymore?  You’re about to go to the point of no return here.”
Tony tilted his head at him and squinted his eyes, “Alright, look...I know this is awkward, but you got to get it over with at some point.  Talking it through was your idea.”
The two of them sighed softly at the same time, giggling right after then locking eyes and sharing a kiss that faded back into a tight embrace.
He started shoving towels into the washer, making as much noise as possible to subtly let Bucky know he was home.  Steve even started to hum a song to himself as his thoughts ran wild.
“Oh yeah,” Steve said, “I...think I should move him.  He won’t be knocked out for long.”  Picking up Frank slowly, Steve placed him another dining chair and promptly locked him into handcuffs around it.  Steve hid the key in the kitchen while they waited for the police to arrive.
When Steve stepped inside the front door, he announced his arrival.  “In here!” came Tony’s voice, as he was in his office tapping away at his computer.  He could hear his boyfriend’s frustrated growls from the spacious living room. There were still moving boxes scattered here and there.
“You can probably keep my two TVs.” finished Steve, “Tony has a trove of monitors everywhere.  I’ll be living in a robot home essentially.  I doubt I’ll need them.”
“I’d probably like to speak to one of you at a time, honestly.” said Bucky, “I owe you both an apology for multiple reasons.”  “Alright.” nods Tony, “Should I go first?”
“I just need to get a pack of cigs.” said Bucky, “I only smoke when I go out but it keeps my hands busy.”
“Not really, you just did some things.” he replied, not looking up until he sent what he was writing.
Tony did business with Pepper over the phone the whole way, not getting back until about 5:45pm.  He got an email as they crossed the bridge to announce a package had been delivered in his mailbox outside his place.  “Must be that super small computer part I ordered for Peter.” Tony thought to himself.
Steve glanced down at where his spit landed then back at him, “I lost my job there now.  Why does any of this still matter?”
Finally Steve stopped crying.  “Everything will be fine.” Bucky whispered in his ear, “We finally both have what we wanted, Steve.”  They pulled back and Steve smiled at him and straightened himself.  The music seemed louder in the complete silence.
“No you didn’t!” sneered Frank, rolling his eyes, “You got paid to leave then did so with all your pension intact.  You have a good reputation with the Army.  I want you to suffer.  I wanted your relationship ruined and your precious boyfriend over there to lose money.  Of course none of that happened because they didn’t want to fucking get sued!”
The steam on the mirror indicated he had just gotten out of the shower.  He was leaning against the bathroom counter with a towel around his hips, being held up by his amputated arm.
She stood there with her hands on her hips, looking like a disgruntled kindergarten teacher.  “I doubt they would have any reason to let him out.” Tony assured her.
“I deserve it.” breathed out Steve, “I still love you, no matter how you feel about me.  I will always protect you.”
His heart broke even harder seeing tears start to fall silently down Tony’s cheeks.  “It obviously meant something,” sniffed Tony, “for you to do it continuously like that.”  The two of them made eye contact.  “Do you love him?”
Sitting back, Steve nodded to himself, feeling flushed a little at the realization.  Was it the right time?  What if Tony WAS planning to propose that night?  Great, now he is wondering if he should get his hopes up.
“Yum!” Steve said dreamily, letting his friend practically carry him off the dance floor.  They went out into the street and caught a cab.
"Aww," pouted Tony playfully, "is somebody worried his best friend is gonna be stolen by his other best friend?"
"Oh, I can find something for you to do." Tony said in a deep voice, lunging forward to kiss him rather hard.  Steve touched his hips gently and sucked on Tony’s tongue in return.
They arrived at the restaurant and were seated in a dim booth in the corner.  There weren’t that many people in there that night since it was a Thursday.
Steve shook his head, “You’re here now.  Stoppit.”  He kissed him a few more times to get him to calm down.
“I also meant what I said earlier,” Bucky told him, “I’m not interested in a relationship right now.  There’s too much shit going on.”
“Fuck, it burns!” groaned Tony, jolting his head back.  He looked down to make sure Frank was still passed out before glancing back at Steve.  “Apparently, you used to work with this guy.”
Keeping his mouth by Steve’s ear, Tony said “Hey babe, got your drink.”  He looked up at him with a questioning look, but got up to stand behind his chair.  Their friends on the sofa started to talk amongst themselves once again.
Steve spoke with a mouth full of food, “Bucky here can sell ice to a polar bear.  Always been a smooth talker.”
“Is that what you want?” Rhodey asked, raising his eyebrows so high, his forehead wrinkles were extra prominent.
Bucky took off his jacket and hung it on the rack by the door.  He kicked off his boots and looked around the apartment, like he was trying to decide.
Steve showered and practiced his reactions in the mirror so he was prepared.  He settled on a simple black tailored suit.  His tie was a red and gold pattern, Tony’s favorite tie he had bought for him.
Steve went to get changed into his casual clothes, a soft green sweater and thick jeans.  He grabbed his overnight bag with his clean work uniform and took off.
He recognized the title as an indication he needed to start making demands or he might not be allowed to finish.
“You’re right!” said Wanda, spilling mustard from her sandwich on her camo uniform, “I believe he hasn’t had a break in like...8 years or something.  He’s a bitter old man.  He needs to let loose.”
There was a tickle on the side of Tony’s neck as he felt his boyfriend inhale his scent.  He told him happily, “I missed hanging out with you..”
Steve was awakened by the sound of the doorbell and then Tony stomping down to the front door.  He returned to the living room with a paper bag full of breakfast sandwiches.  It was dropped in front of Steve’s face on the coffee table.
Steve’s eyes twinkled in delight at his words.  He slowly got up and made his way over to Tony while he spoke, “No problem.  I’m off tonight.  I was thinking about making a nice dinner for the two of us.  Would that be...okay?”
“Well, I guess the other thing that’s bothering me is…” he paused, fighting back more tears, “I just got you back as my friend, Buck.  I went for so long without even a text from you.  It would suck if I lost you again to a new girlfriend.”  Steve succumbed to the tears even though he wiped them constantly against his jacket sleeve.
“Typical,” Tony smirked, “...you don’t have to always just suck it up, soldier.  You get a say in this."
Tony started to put in the code on the keypad to the front door, “No, he isn’t right now.  I didn’t think you guys knew each other that well.”
They hear footsteps and yelling of police officers coming up the stairs to burst through the front door.  Steve immediately disarmed and handed over the weapon as they swarmed Frank.  “He needs a medic!” Steve told the cops as he rushed over to his boyfriend.  2 officers walked them to the elevator to ride down to a waiting ambulance outside.
His oldest friend was worrying him, but Steve knew he had to remain calm and casual or else Bucky wouldn’t tell him anything about what was going on.
He smiled and slid in, closing the door and saying “Hi.”  “Hi, baby.” replied Tony, staring into his eyes.
The brunette man was breathing deep, seemingly relaxed for the first time that day.  “Steve?” he mumbled.  “Hmm?” Steve answered.
He stood up carefully, hand still around his soft dick, and went into the kitchen to find a towel to clean up and threw it immediately in the washing machine.  Then he made his way back over to the couch to find his underwear and put them back on.
“I got to go to work soon.” Bucky mumbled, holding Steve on his chest while the bigger man lay between his legs.
Steve changed clothes a few times before he settled on a blue flannel shirt and a black bomber jacket.  Steve styled his hair and by the time he was finished, Natasha was knocking on his front door.
Bucky cleared his throat to get his attention and asked, “So, is uh...does Madison know you are here?”
“Nothing.  I’m just not interested in that right now.”  Bucky dragged his smoke, “Also, how does he know that I’m not here with you?”
“Hold on to me.” Bucky told him low and gravelly.  He took Marco by the hand and led him into his bedroom.
Tony stepped into his lobby area but held the door open with his foot.  “I can take it for you.” he offered happily, “Thanks for bringing it all the way down here.  It’s funny they didn’t just give it to me.  I just came from the base, actually.”  He held out his hand for the gift.
Smirking, Steve looked him over and replied, “About 10, I suppose.  Natasha will be over here in a bit.”
When Steve first came out, he did his rounds on grindr and other hookup apps but never really found the right guy to actually fuck.  They would never go all the way because they didn’t seem RIGHT.
One day, Steve was walking home in the fresh spring air and decided to grab himself a coffee from a stand.  While he waited in line, he was mindlessly scrolling through Facebook.  A specific post caught his attention, making him gasp out loud and get glares from the people near him.
Bucky’s breath caught at that statement.  He had to clear his throat awkwardly once again, “I won’t use our history as an excuse but it is a very long and complicated one.  I met Steve when I was young and in a bad place.  I dropped back in on him because that’s what I’ve always done.  It’s unhealthy, I realize and we can’t do that anymore.”
“Come on, you can get a nap later.  Just tell me what happened, the short version.  Please?” he asked lightly.
“Cuddle up to me and give him a dirty look.” huffed Bucky, sitting closer and situating the ashtray between them.
Steve watched his bedroom door close and couldn't help but wonder how long he was going to stick around this time.  He also couldn't believe Bucky had made the sober decision to cheat on a woman with her own brother.
Tony wiped his face, composed himself, and cleared his throat, "Get your stuff together. I'm not arguing with you anymore."
Bucky smiled.  Every time he visited he asked to go back there.  It was the only place in Brooklyn where Bucky enjoyed everything on the menu.  (And he could afford it.)  “Sure.”
“Sure thing.” he replied, helping Natasha off the stool and grabbing her things for her.  They went outside and got an uber.
When she walked away, Steve continued to eat his kimchi bean sprouts.  “So...maybe we should have that talk now.”
Steve held his breath, letting it out slowly as he was impaled.  There was no stopping Tony from going all the way in until he struck that magical spot inside him once more.  They held still, staying connected and breathing, listening to the running water patter on the tile.  “Go on.” Steve groaned softly, nodding his head.
“You go for the lack of people but stay from the lack of gas stations.” joked Bucky, “I understand.  I just don’t want to deal with my dad.  I feel like he’s just going to be...vicious since I haven’t been home.”
Of course Steve was afraid of rushing things back to normal when he was still in a transitional period with Tony.
“I love you.” Steve said out loud as the door shut.  He knew his boyfriend didn’t want to break up.  At least, Steve hoped so.  Tony needed more time, so he had to accept it.
Bucky’s eyes wandered to the window to watch the beginning of a snow flurry falling outside.  The sound of Tony’s throat clearing regained his attention.  “So,” he boasted, “how do we do this?”
Taking his remaining sandwiches, Tony sat on the chair on the opposite side of the room to eat them.  They chewed in silence for a while until Steve finished the first biscuit and thanked him.  In return, Tony only gave a nod without looking his way.
Okoye was wearing a button down top, open and untucked with ripped jeans. She always kept her haircut shaved bald and makeup flawless.
“Bits and pieces.  After the third round, things got hazy.” laughed Steve,  taking two coffee mugs out of the cabinet.  “I could feel worse, but my hangover is definitely there.  It serves me right by mixing beer and liquor.”
Steve thanked Natasha and she left but as soon as the front door shut, he had to hastily rush to the master bathroom to vomit.  There was a ton of commotion as he stumbled through the bedroom, waking up his man in the process.
Bucky didn’t look directly at him as he started lacing up his boots.  “I thought I might walk to the bar, it’s nice out.  Sorry I can’t take the night off but I’ll be home by about 1.”
Never before had Bucky been so demanding with him.  This was all so new yet familiar.  (And incredibly hot.)
Steve was in and out of consciousness on the way home.  He would probably have no knowledge of what happened at the club.
Steve shook his head slowly, "Let's just go to bed, hun. I said I was sorry.  I didn't mean it the way I said it. You know I didn't."
Steve cleared his throat and switched his phone to the other ear, “I’m here, just seems a little unexpected.  Buck and I have been talking a lot and hanging out again.  I just don’t know why he wouldn’t mention it to me."
Both of Steve’s hands held the gun once more and stepped closer to Frank.  “Alright, you fucking prick.  Why’d you come here?  To kill me?”
Steve stood awkwardly for a minute before asking Bucky if he wanted something to drink which he declined.  He sat next to his boyfriend.  Tony was giving Bucky a pleasant look, which he forced himself to return.  This whole situation made his stomach churn but he knew it needed to be done.
Steve looked relieved, “Yeah, we just needed to talk it through, I guess.  He apologized for seeming like he was avoiding me.”
“Thank you.” she sang, leaning down to kiss both his cheeks.  (They did that every time they saw each other.  Tony absolutely adored Carol.)
“You’re practically a diversity hire.  They need more queers in the military and that’s the only reason you got what you think you earned, Faggot.”  Frank spit a loogie on the floor in front of him.
“Oh thank God!” said Marco, his voice being deeper than Steve thought it would be.  He had a thick New Jersey-esque accent.  “I was texting you in case you got a new phone.  I didn’t know what else to do!  I’ve been so worried.  Where are you?”
With a chuckle, the brunette man finished off his burger. "I came out as bisexual to him when I went home after the war."  He spoke so casually as if that wasn’t a big deal.
Steve looked over at him, giving him an adorable smile from one corner of his mouth, “I wanted to make sure you were alright.”
"I don't want to argue." He whimpered, "That's not fair.  You said you wanted me to stay tonight.  I gave Bucky my house key."
Besides her, Natasha visited.  She was super emotional when she came.  As soon as Steve opened the door, Natasha held onto him for 5 minutes straight.
“Steve…” Tony said warningly, slowing his pace.  “Let go, honey.” Steve begged, putting both hands on the bench to support himself.  There was some resistance on Tony’s part, his hands pushing against the man’s ass.  “Whoah, babe.  Slow down.”  He was definitely weaker than Steve and couldn’t do anything to stop him.  “Baby, seriously.” moaned Tony, digging his nails into the muscular hips that were gyrating back onto him.  Steve’s moans mixed with his boyfriend’s, “Doesn’t it feel good?  Don’t you love my tight ass?”
Steve gave her a dirty look and announced he is now moving on to the walk-in closet if she wants to follow him.  They both go to the bedroom and she sits on the floor while he starts to organize his clothes that were sitting in a pile on a bench.
It really assisted their "moving on" process, since they literally moved across the city to the suburbs.  They, of course,had to talk about the affair and the invasion in their sessions. The couples therapist was an old liberal woman who did appointments from her Harlem home.
Other than working and taking care of the penthouse, Steve would spend quiet nights at home with Tony.  He would rub the older man’s shoulders every afternoon when he came home from the office.  Sometimes he would pour him a drink.  Tony would vent about whatever was frustrating him and Steve would just listen and be attentive and affectionate before he went to his short class.
When he rejoined his friends upstairs, Bucky seemed to be talking to a few more of his friends from work besides Natasha.  Steve mingled a little more on his own.
The next morning was Saturday, meaning it was Steve’s day off.  He still woke up at 6 and took Bucky with him to the football field to jog.
Steve whispered in his ear, “Yeah, but they are probably already done and gone.  Let me take care of you, honey bun.”
Steve looked down at his boyfriend, “You sound like you have been giving it some thought.  Usually it is safe...we were stalked.”
The humping motions Tony was making became more fierce and desperate. He was starting to fall apart.
Steve had his arms around his man with Tony’s back against his chest and his head resting on his shoulder.
Tony and Steve were happier, laughing together and attempting to go out a bit more.  Their story wasn’t so popular anymore but the paps were still following them around.  It was still so bad that Tony had to “buy out” a rooftop beer garden for a few hours just so they could have dinner...in the blistering cold.
Steve’s eyes wandered around the living/dining room.  You could tell the walls were professionally decorated with art Tony didn’t even pick out.  When turned his gaze toward the kitchen, it reminded Steve of when he was making meals alone and feeling sad while Tony and he were fighting.  The memory of frantically grabbing towels to put pressure on Tony's gunshot wound.  He started to notice how cold and empty it felt in there.
Tony had been nagging him about figuring out what to do about Bucky since his lease would be up soon and the moving arrangements would have to go forward.  Plus, Tony had already bought the California king size bed for the two of them and was sleeping in that giant thing alone every night.
Bucky did so and examined the intricate wood and marble paneling on the walls of the suite, “This place is nicer than my bank.”
“At least we look hot enough not to wait.” Steve said loudly into Bucky’s ear, holding onto his belt loop as they pushed their way through the crowd of men trying to get into the bathroom.
“I’m not trying to be mean, but I was honestly irritated with the fact that you were trying to get me to continue being your side piece.”
Steve sighed, “No, love.  We just haven’t caught up in a while and you can pick me up when you and Rhodey are done.  Everything’s fine.”
Steve met his eyes again, “I mean...you just didn’t mention anything to me.  She didn’t mention anything either, but Wanda and I aren’t that close.”  “Really?” Bucky scowled, “You guys see each other once a week.  You used to have lunch every day, right?”
Steve was doing a poor job of holding in his laughter, “I’m...I’m sorry, honey.  Just wanted to surprise you.”
“He’s my oldest friend,” scoffed Steve, “I’m just looking out for him.  You did the same thing for Rhodey when he got dumped and had to move out of his girlfriend’s place.”
When Natasha came back to her seat at the bar she started to flirt with the guy in the green coat.  She was not being subtle.  He bought her two more rounds then she was officially wasted.
The blonde got off of him and grabbed his phone off the coffee table to see that Tony was calling him.  It was about lunch time on his usual work day.
"You may have distanced yourself," said Steve, "but I mean...my love for you has been around for 10 years.  Ever since high school, when you snuck in my window.  It won't matter how long we're apart.  You're right, I tried to ignore it too.  I moved on.  So did you."
The blonde man looked over at Sam, making eye contact and looking panicked.  Sam motioned with his hands to tell him to calm down.  Bucky also caught his eye, looking confused, then shocked when he realized what was happening.
Steve examined his face as he shuffled.  The hair covering half his face was an attempt to disguise a black eye behind it.  Keeping his voice casual and friendly, Steve asked, “Well, it’s a little early and I need to get to work in a bit.  You can always just call if you want to catch up, ya know.”
“I know.  I used to hear her talking to her friends all the time about it.  My family has never been good to me.  I’ve been planning my escape for a while, luckily.”
The main General person in charge of this case said, “If you wish to withdraw your company from our contracts, Mr.Stark, we would be happy to have our lawyers speak with yours.”
“Would you really leave?  Even further than where you moved last time?”  It hurt Bucky’s heart because he could almost read it in Steve’s sad tone.
Bucky looked up at him but the other man’s eyes stayed focused on his food.  “You’re worried I might overstay my welcome?  I wouldn’t do that to you.”
The lobby and elevators had just been painted brighter, more modern colors.  He could smell the new floors they had put in as well.  When he got to the door, Steve had to take several deep breaths before knocking.
Bucky turned to Steve on the couch and scooted a little closer, “You know what?  Maybe I should move to Brooklyn.  I love hanging out with you again and eating this amazing food around here.”
“I’m sorry, Steve.  I didn’t know.  That was rude of me, I...thought I was talking with you enough and checking in.”  She put her hand on his shoulder.
He saw himself as guilty for enabling his friend back then even though Steve had been told repeatedly that he wasn’t the problem.
His comment sat Bucky’s face on fire.  He had to look away,  “I’m glad you are finally doing it, the graphic design thing.  You were always good at it.”
Natasha laughed, sounding kind of cocky.  Like this sort of thing happens to her all the time.  (Steve realized it kind of happens often when they go out.)
There were a few nights Bucky didn’t leave the bar until 4, sometimes 5 in the morning, but he would always try to make it home on time to run with Steve and Sam.
Looking embarrassed, she suggested 90 Day Fiance.  He agreed happily.  They both could admit it was trashy but they loved it anyway.  After watching an episode, they start making small talk about how Bucky is doing.
“I think they’re going to keep your contract.” Steve smiled softly, “They would have called you in earlier if they weren’t going to.  I hope they do.”
“Violating your contract, how could you have done that?  You work for HR.  You’re just a bookkeeper.” asked Bucky, getting a little upset and protective.
“I’m not even sure what I want to do or where I want to live.” sighed Bucky, sipping at his drink.  “Also, no offense, but I don’t ever want to work for the Army again.  I was discharged, remember?  I’m too crazy…”
Bucky said he would silence his contact for a little while because they both needed a longer break from each other.
Steve scooted closer to him in bed and put his head on the man’s shoulder, “Thank you for taking care of me and feeding me so I don’t die.”
“Then why did you text me immediately?  You only do that when you are upset.  Aren’t you happy for your friends?”
Steve scoffed to himself, “I know right?  I’m such an asshole.”  He drank some water and breathed deeply as he felt fresh tears start to fall down his cheeks.  All this sobbing was really starting to leave him feeling dehydrated.  His eyes burned by now.
That made Bucky feel a mix of emotions.  Should he make it clear that he doesn’t want to restart what they had?  Should he not say anything and try to have a good time?  Was this visit supposed to be strictly friendly?
Slowly, Steve moves off the door and stands aside.  He doesn’t know what else to do.  “I understand.  I’ll leave you alone for as long as you want.  Just...hug me before you go.”
“What are we doing?” asked Bucky with heavy eyelids and labored breaths.  His hands were still on his shoulders, preventing him from coming closer.
He had to sit on the bench nearby to collect his thoughts.  How had he not seen the way Wanda and Bucky interacted?  Why didn’t she mention it to him?  Why didn’t Bucky mention it to him?
“Not like this.  It’s always got to come to an end.  This feels right, like we have all the time in the world.”
As Bucky stole a spritz of Steve’s cologne while they were both fixing their hair in the bathroom mirror, he asked which club they were going to.
An emotional conversation turned into a full blown argument very quickly.  Steve insinuated that he couldn’t be Bucky’s friend anymore now things were different, more different than they ever had been.  Bucky insinuated that he would never speak to Steve again for saying that and it was fucked up.  He told Steve that their discussion was over before they could say anything to make it worse.
There will be a lot of texting going on for the next few chapters.  Give this story time, is all I will say.  Love you for reading this!
It surged the brunette man forward and since he was holding Steve up at this point, he clutched the blonde tighter as he found his footing again.  Their foreheads bumped a little.
“Never.” promised Bucky as they pulled back.  He went to the front door and blew Steve a kiss, “Don’t eat too much takeout while I’m gone.  See ya Friday.”
Just as Steve had promised Natasha, every Wednesday he would join them for karaoke at their favorite bar.  They usually had fun but by the end of the night, Steve is usually shitfaced and stumbling.  Natasha knows it’s because he is sad-drinking, not happy-drinking.  Thankfully Tony is usually asleep when his boyfriend gets home via uber from the bar.  He’d never been seen stumbling sloppily around the house.
Slowly he helped Tony make his way to the couch.  Tony hissed as he sat down, continuing to press on his wound and trying to control his breathing.  Steve still pointed the gun at Frank.
This particular man had a perfect undercut and a beard.  He was kind of sexy, wearing a very tight tshirt and shorts, in his early 40s with large muscular arms.
“I’ll go get a phone and go job hunting tomorrow.  Are you cool with me listing this place as my address for now?”  asked Bucky, combing his fingers through his hair mindlessly.
They started to kiss and strip each other, ending up naked on Tony’s bed with Steve on his back and his slightly smaller boyfriend on top of him.
Rolling his eyes, Bucky replied, “Yes, I’ve been sleeping.  I’m fine.”  He gently took Marco’s hands down from his cheeks.  “It was nice to see you.  Good luck on that interview.”
“Yeah, but we don’t really hang out outside of that.” shrugged Steve, “I just had no idea you guys were even a thing.  You and I have been talking again and yet you still just...nothing.”  He shook his head and crossed his arms.
Bucky reached down to slip his finger tips in the waistband of Steve’s now tented boxer briefs.  “Do you want to?”
“I know it’s not the same thing,” said Tony, “but I have been hiding it from you too, and I felt guilty.  Seems stupid now.”
Nodding, Steve looked around the apartment in his own thoughts, “Yeah, I’m glad you guys got along.”
He proceeded to explain the whole situation to his friend.  Bucky seemed excited but did offer to pay Tony back starting as soon as he moved out.
Rhodey brought over Carol to have dinner with them most recently.  When asked why they couldn’t go out, Tony reminded them that the photographers were following him and Steve everywhere.
“The great Steve Rogers is going to protect him?” taunted Frank.  He cradled his hurt arm as he and Steve circled each other a little.  Suddenly Frank lunged for the gun, causing both of them to tumble to the floor.
By the time Steve sat back down alone on the couch with his beer, Wanda wandered back in the apartment to join him.
“I’ll hit up the store before you get back.” smiled Steve, “Good luck with the meeting.”  He leaned closer to Tony, looking expectant for a goodbye kiss.
Tony nodded, “Always worried about me…” His voice was soft and loving.  “We’re celebrating, darling.  Red wine is heart healthy.  Also, I haven’t had red meat in months.  It’s okay for every once and awhile.”
Natasha looked him over and admired the way his button down shirt was tight around his muscles, “Nice to meet you.”
Paying more attention to Tony made Steve almost fall in love with him all over again.  It was refreshing for Steve to take care of
Bucky cleared his throat, “Then the second time I came to him,  I was upset and crying.  Madison had said some fucked up shit to me.  I literally ran into his arms.  He kissed ME that night...for like 3 hours.”
Steve leaned up and pulled Bucky into a hug.  The brunette continued to cry, starting to apologize for it but his friend shushed him.  “I don’t want this hostility or silence between us to ever happen again, alright?” Steve said, “You’re so important to me.  I want you to be a part of my life.”
Plating the food, Steve said, “Fuck, should I tell him about it?  We promised to never keep anything from each other, no matter how small.  I feel like such an idiot.”
“Absolutely, I need to be more considerate.  It’s good you’re telling me this now.  I got a feeling that’s not all, is it?”
Steve smirked and nodded, “Yeah that’s what that means.  We can spend all the time in the world together.”  “Like we’ll be officially living in the same place?  Sounds like we need to celebrate,” said Tony in a sultry voice, “since we don’t have work tomorrow.”
“There was no excuse for the...perpetuation of...what happened.” Bucky continued, “I just think...I was holding out hope that maybe...he and I were going to be something else.  That sounds so stupid now I'm saying it out loud.  The point is, I realized that I was being selfish.  He was already with you, and you guys are in love.  You are good for him, Tony.  I’m not.  I needed to accept that and move on.  I should have just been happy for him and let him be.”
Bucky looked around with his hands in his pockets, admiring his collection of memorabilia and pictures of him and his parents hanging on the walls.
Deciding to take his chances and be daring, Steve said “Seriously though Buck, I’m not scrutinizing you or anything but, why DID you start hooking up with that guy?”
He didn’t say anything, trying to hype himself up about all the good going on in his life.  Steve didn’t have time to worry about bullshit like this anymore.  It wasn’t wise to let himself go back to that shitty mindset that Bucky belonged to him.
“That’s an order, Rogers.” said Tony with a playful military voice, “I need you to tend to my privates.”
“Wanda has been single for a while too.  It’s good for her to get back out there again.” she assured him.
“He has a black eye but he’ll be fine.  He just got out of a bad relationship with a crazy woman.  I’m just trying to help him back on his feet.” Steve spoke softly as he paced up and down his balcony.
“We.” Steve corrected, “WE did that.  I will be alright.  I’ll pack some stuff and keep myself busy.”  He was pulled up into a kiss, their tongues encircling each other passionately.
Examining the way he answered that last question, he knew Bucky was lying.  “At least he helped you when it mattered.” offered Steve.
“Yes I am.” whimpered Steve, kissing his cheeks then down the left side of his neck.  “I swear I am.” he repeated in a low tone, “Buck...please.”
Wiping his face with the back of his hand, Steve shook his head and let his eyes wander around the apartment.  "Buck…" he exhaled, "I…”
A ton of guys were already walking around without shirts on and making out in the seating area even though it wasn’t even midnight yet.
Steve let himself lose his mind for a few more minutes, went to the bathroom to wash his face, gathered his boxes into the living room, and called the movers.
A few minutes went by before she responded “Okay, yeah.  He told me, but only because he was miserable and I pressed for information.  I knew he was sad.”
“I’m Tony Fucking Stark,” said Tony in a sing song tone, “I can make anything happen.  If I call Pepper right now she can have us 5 homes to view by tomorrow."
Taking a deep breath, Steve started over and went into the entire history of he and Bucky.  He even told Tony about how they slept together in High School and the military and finally, went into what happened when Tony was away on his trip.
“I don’t want Bucky to hear.” Tony said softly, "No way either of us could keep quiet.  You know how we get."
Steve mindlessly aimed his head a little better and caught Bucky’s lips to press them together dead on.
Steve looked down at that comment but he nodded as Bucky let go of him.  He swiftly walked around the kitchen wall to join Bucky at the bar.
While they had good sex (though predictable) and they both did get to cum...it was just kind of disappointing.  Steve even started to feel embarrassed for asking a few times for something he maybe didn’t want to do.
Bucky did mention that a visit to the Burlington Coat Factory would be good enough, but the wealthy man wouldn’t hear it.
Pepper looked at him incredulously, “Do you realize that you just gained popularity over the past month due to your TED talk and now you have become a victim of a home invasion?”
This was the first time they had seen each other since the months before (when Marco’s uncle was punching his face).
“Not sure.” Bucky responded, “I just would never give you the option, no matter how I felt about it.  Does that make sense?”
It would become a funny story about how Steve went around gathering all of the heat lamps in the place and put them in a circle around their table.  Tony said he felt like they were on Survivor and they couldn’t stop laughing when the waitress would come check on them.
“Tell you?”  Steve interrupted, “You were at the conference, Tony.  I didn’t want to distract you.  I was planning to talk to you about it now.  I didn’t think they would contact you yet.”
“Baby, c’mere.” sighed Tony sadly, hugging him and rubbing his back, “I understand how this feels like a betrayal.  You gave yourself to them and they were supposed to almost treat you like a family, huh?  This is fucked up.”
“I’ll come over, honey.” Steve assured him, “Just let me stop at home after work to give Bucky the house key.”
“God...god damn…” moaned Bucky, sounding impressed with the feeling of being inside the dreamy man underneath him.
“Now you sound like Marco.  We’re adults, Steve.” Bucky said, shaking his head, “We knew what we were doing.  That’s why I asked you a few times how long we were going to keep it up.  I told you I didn’t want to do this again and I did anyway.  You think you can just be the martyr and then feel sorry for yourself?”
Nodding, Bucky told him “Yeah, my Christian name.  I’ve been called Bucky all my life.  Middle name’s Buchanon.”
He stared a second before replying, “It did at first, but I realized I just want Bucky to live his best life and nothing seems good enough for him...from my perspective.”  Steve searched his man’s eyes for any signs of anger or sadness.  He didn’t find any, so he continued.  “My friend’s had a rough life.  I just always think helping Bucky is my responsibility, but it’s honestly not anymore.”
“But you were jerking off to her!” cried Steve before snapping his mouth shut from the embarrassing admission.
With a sigh, Bucky told him “Watch some TV, keep your mind off things for a little while,  and I’ll be back soon.”
Managing to avert his gaze, Bucky could only make it down to Steve’s pouty lips.  He wondered if he licked into his mouth right now if he could still catch the familiar flavor of the whisky…
The younger man looked at him gloomily, knowing he deserved these harsh words.  Shaking his head and quieting his voice, Tony said “I’m tearing myself in two because you’re my soulmate.  We belong to each other.  I still want us to hold each other and I want to cry with you and comfort you.  What was this all really about?  Huh?”
Bucky nodded and slipped his black leather jacket on.  He pointed to the mirror, “When you move out, can I keep this?”
Rolling his eyes, Steve got his things together and hurried over to Tony still sitting on the bed.  They shared a short kiss and said I love you.  The blonde man hurried out the door in his army uniform, overnight bag slung over his shoulder.
“That’s super nice of Tony to help him stay here.” she commented, strolling down the hallway to inspect the dark empty office.
“Don’t you start!” Rhodey told her, pointing a finger at her from his hand that was gripping his beer bottle.  They all started to break off into multiple small conversations.  May asked Steve, “What made you guys decide to move out of Manhattan?”  Wanda and Bucky were listening next to them.  Steve shrugged and said loudly over the voices and the music, “I just wanted to come somewhere that I could walk down the sidewalk and not run into 50 tons of garbage, ya know?”  They laughed together.  “Hey,” smiled Bucky, “there are rats too!”  “You’re absolutely right!” Steve nodded to his friend.
Crossing his own arms, Tony sneered, “Obviously I’m fucking not.  It feels like you don’t even want to live with me!”
Bucky stammered, "Besides, he is in a serious relationship to a man that is literally putting me back on my feet."
The penthouse was now a crime scene for the next couple days, so they would have to get a hotel room until all evidence was collected.  That included Steve’s knife, which he would never get back.
“Haven’t been ready to see anyone seriously.” Bucky told him honestly, “Just been focusing on making friends, plus I need to work on myself first.”
“Hey,” he smiled, “calm down.  It’s alright.  You got confused and accidentally kissed someone.  You didn’t cheat, you didn’t do anything knowingly.  It’s a miracle that memory came back to you at all.  Don’t even worry about it.”
"Sounds good." Tony leaned up to press their lips together a few times.  When he pulled back, he seemed to be in his thoughts, “Hang on, what if we don’t need to kick Bucky out?’
“Nah,” Bucky huffed, “the guys are so flaky and when the girls saw I was bisexual, they just say nevermind.”
“Talk to you lover.” Natasha shrugged with her hands full of her lunch box and lemonade.  “Just don’t forget to let me know if you can come to my party tomorrow night, alright?”
The days the couple had shared recently were filled with eating a meal or two, television, and nonstop sex.
Tony and he liked binge watching shows together and they had been half-way through Breaking Bad for a long time.
“Of course.” scoffed Steve, getting a light kick from his boyfriend under the table.  “He just reeks of it, doesn’t he?”
With a content sigh, Steve kissed his cheek slowly a few times, “I do have all the time in the world for you.  I’m sorry I haven’t been showing it lately.”
Tony was crying and groaning in pain.  “Tony!” Steve cried, getting to his feet as fast as he could.  “Help me.” groaned Tony.
Steve swept him into a bear hug and tipped him backwards until Bucky was lying back against the couch pillows.  He hovered over the brunette man.
With a sardonic chuckle, Bucky turned to him, “What do you mean?  You’re the one going through something right now.”
Okoye grabbed the cleaner and towels to wipe down the bar, “Steve, that’s right.  He definitely seems interested in YOU.  The way HE was looking at you, when you speak…”
“I think we’re set.” said Tony, getting her attention.  “Thank you so much for everything you’ve done.”
That got Steve to raise one eyebrow in intrigue.  Bucky started to back up down the hallway, towing the other man with him.
This was only the second time they had sex since they got out of living in the hotel suite.  It was so overwhelming and amazing, reminiscent of their very first time.  Tony stood a little taller and pumped in him faster, gently slapping the beautiful ass in front of him with his left hand.  He noticed Steve had slipped a hand down to start stroking himself.
Immediately, the burly man put his hands up defensively and smiled.  Mouthing “Sorry.”, he got up and walked off.
Scott, Bucky’s bartender friend, came over from time to time to watch football games.  He had partial custody over his daughter and he was an ex-con therefore Scott never went out anywhere crowded anymore.  (Leftover claustrophobia from prison.)  The two men both welcomed the distraction once a week.
Furiously Steve typed “Fine!  You know what, I was trying to be nice and be supportive.  Have a nice fucking life!”  After the message was read, he blocked all notifications from Bucky’s number and slammed the phone face down on the coffee table.
Steve got home from work Friday afternoon to find Bucky’s shoes kicked off in the living room and his duffel bag on the floor of the hallway.
When she walked off, the three men went to the kitchen to grab beverages.  Bucky got a soda, Steve got a light beer, and Tony poured himself a cheap scotch neat.
Every time Bucky visited during the beginning of their return home, it seemed to be one big party.  The two of them used to drink through the entire weekend or do hallucinogens together.
Natasha snickered, “Steve, you encouraged him to hang out with Wanda and I.  Didn’t you think this might happen?”
That got Tony’s attention.  Instantly he looked down at the man, “By yourself?  Just you two?”  His face wasn’t exactly angry or hurt.  It was just incredulous.
Tony was still sitting in bed with his boyfriend, waiting for him to speak.  His eyes were drifting over the curves of Steve’s face, admiring him even though he appeared to be having an inner conflict.
Tony was getting ready to leave the office when he got a call on his cell from the Army.  It was a representative saying that even though they needed to meet up and speak about it in person, unofficially, they wanted to honor his contract.
Steve just didn’t want to rush his friend out.  He didn’t know anyone else in the city well enough to get another roommate.
“Okay,” Bucky said thoughtfully, “I...I started hooking up with him because we were hanging out at his place outside work.  We had a lot of things in common.  We worked together every shift and sometimes we hung out long after closing, until the sun came up.  He actually listened to me and let me choose what we did together.  I hadn’t had a relationship like that since...you and me.”
Snubbing his cigarette out, Bucky backed up and put both hands on the balcony rail behind him.  He kept his eyes down at the pavement as he said “I don’t even know if we can be friends right now.”
“Marco, I...I have to go.  Maybe after a while we can talk again.  I just need to focus on myself for a while.”
Steve made his way over to his own bed to sit on the edge, “We just argued a little bit.  It was nothing.  I have some good news though.”
“Why not?  Sometimes people are just jealous, it doesn't have to be something you did.  Someone had to have deliberately reported this so you would look bad.  How else would you guys have flown under the radar for 2 years?”
The three of them walked into the living room where Tony was sitting on the sofa.  “Hey there honey bear.” he smiled.
The coffee must have caused him to officially wake up because he suddenly turned to his friend with a spatula in his hand, “Oh God...oh no.  Buck, did I...did I make out with someone?”
“I appreciate your concern, Platypus.” smiled Tony, “I know it’s out of love,  and I love you too, alright? ”  "I just hope you know what you're doing."   Just then Carol and Steve re-emerged into the living room.
At home, he could tell Steve wanted to talk more, but also was smart enough to try and not push too hard.  It was feeling like they were only roommates.  Steve continued to be pleasant to his boyfriend and try to have some conversation here and there, he wasn’t giving up.
Slowly, he started to rock his hips into Bucky, lolling his head back and whining.  That man’s mouth felt incredible.  He felt drunk on it.
“Again, all valid concerns.” said Natasha, “But if Tony is helping you, then it seems like you can take your time finding a job.  Also, he can probably help you get good legal representation if you need it.”
“No worries.” Tony said, offering a friendly smile, “I’ll see you soon then, babe.”  Steve nodded, stifling his small giggles and they disconnected.
She was definitely getting more tipsy and subtly forcing her boobs to spill out of her sparkly top she was wearing.
He stared at Steve while sitting still and eventually put the phone on speaker, making Steve throw his hands up in the air in frustration.
The two men sat in silence for a few minutes.  Finally, when Tony found his voice again he said “Steve, we always,
“That’s right!  Frank, the IT guy.” said Tony, gesturing with his hand holding the package.  “Is there someone I can help you find?”
Sam was also honorably discharged from the air force when his partner died in his arms on the field and got his degree in psychology.  He currently worked as a guidance counselor for High School kids.
“I said I wasn’t going to kill you.  I wanted to take something from you.” Frank said, looking straight at Tony with a smile.  “Just like how you took from me.”
Bracing against the blonde with his good arm around his waist, Tony started to move.  Moans started to pour out of Steve straight away.
“Fuck.” groaned Bucky with bleary eyes when they gasped for air.  He cupped Steve’s face with his skin hand to look at him, “I...I don’t want to share you.  I’m sure Tony doesn’t either.”
Steve huffed one small laugh, like he thought that was the cutest question ever.  “Braised red snapper, garlic potatoes, and raspberry gilatto.  Hopefully the cops cleaned that stuff up and it’s not melted everywhere when we get home.”
Knowing Bucky had to leave for work in about 4 hours, Steve decided to help him out.  He changed out of his work clothes and quietly went out to grab the duffel bag full of clothes.
Steve turned off the TV and stretched, “How was your night?” he whispered. He was shirtless in pajama pants, his voice raspy.
A silent few minutes later, Tony checked the antique clock on the wall and determined that Steve would be home within the next 10-15 minutes.  Frank continued to pace in front of the cuffed man and gripped his semi-automatic pistol tight.
“About when I moved in here.” Bucky said, finally returning his gaze.  He announced he was taking a shower and took one of his pills just to be safe.
Looking a little afraid, Steve told him “I was sad because he kept quiet about it.  We’ve been salvaging our friendship and I found out about this through social media.  I felt left out of the loop.”  “I could understand that.” shrugged Tony.
When Steve was stretched open, Tony lubed up the vibrator and slid it into him slowly.  He clicked it on to the first speed of vibrations.
Tony suddenly stood and raised his voice, “I know I’m fucking right!”  He laughed bitterly, “I sure as shit didn’t do anything wrong.  You know why I have to keep drinking right now?  My mind cannot comprehend the level of deceit from you.”
Bucky shook his head and put his own coffee on the table.  He dragged his cigarette, “I know, but that shit isn’t cool with me.  I told you it wasn’t.  You seemed to forget.”
Steve indulged him for a minute and even moaned and thrust his almost hard dick against him a few times.
This lanky guy reeked of cigarettes when he breathed out his laugh, “I just came here to visit your boyfriend, Steve.  We miss him since he left the base.  Is he around?”
“Babycakes.” pouted Tony, both of them pausing in the space between the two entrance doors.  “When you are with me, you don’t ever have to ride that dinky train again.”
“Yes you do.” mumbled Tony, cradling his boyfriend and placing kisses in his hair.  “Hey, I’ll tell you what, why don’t we go on a date to the movies tomorrow night?  We haven’t in so long and you love that.”
As soon as the elevator in Tony’s building opened for Steve, he was met with a tight embrace from his boyfriend, in his casual ACDC shirt with a long sleeve underneath.
A few moments later, Steve pulled them out of the hug and looked down at the sad man in front of him.  He waited patiently for his boyfriend to speak.  Softly, Tony finally said, “I don’t know how to ever trust you again, Steve.”
Suddenly he heard a strange choked noise.  Turning off the water, Steve listened and realized it was coming from Bucky.
As he was planning to bum rush the guy, the wind slammed the front door shut behind Steve, making him flinch.
Bucky took a sip of water and sat back, crossing his prosthetic arm and his real one.  “Alright...so basically...I was with that girl, Madison.  She got me a good job at a bar with her brother.  I was doing well as a barback...I was not even drinking because serving drunks every night kept me off of it.”
“Whatever you need, babe.”  Tony smiled, “If you want to do the shopping yourself and need help, me and Happy both will go with you.  It doesn’t matter.”
They hugged until Bucky was reduced to tiny sniffles.  Steve got up and sat next to him on the loveseat, “You alright now?”  Bucky nodded and wiped his face, “I think so.”  “Tony!” Steve called, hearing his boyfriend opening the bedroom door immediately.  He looked back and forth from Bucky to Steve.  They looked exactly like he thought they would, worked up and emotionally exhausted.
Tony put his arm around him to cuddle Steve a little, “I love you.  I want my baby taken care of.”  “I love you too.” said Steve, smiling when he got a kiss placed on his own cheek.  “I appreciate that.  You know I just don’t like to impose. I...I don’t deserve you.”
There was only a bandage covering Tony’s open wound and he couldn’t take a shower.  Tony looked around the room at the tall windows and the designer furniture all around, all white.
That made Bucky ask “Is there going to be more to this investigation?  Or do you have all you need?”
The brunette man pouted his plump lips, “Are you sure we can’t pick you up some bagels on the way to your place?”
“No, I’m sorry.  I’m getting married.” she said with a slightly boozy voice, “Thank you so much for the drinks, though.”
“What, Steve?  What’s wrong?  Do you miss him?  Bucky seems like he misses you and like he’s almost...offended when I mention you.  It’s like he’s jealous I can talk to you, as if he can’t.”
“I know...me, in a long-term relationship with another guy.” laughed Steve, stabbing his bacon on his plate.
“I have to be wherever is best for me.” Bucky replied, “It may not be here.  I’m going to need to eventually apologize personally to Tony, but after that, I probably will start looking for somewhere to live.”
Glancing down, Tony noticed Frank was wearing his military uniform under his coat.  He had regulation military boots just like Steve’s.  There was also a pile of cigarette butts.
Feeling more alone than ever, Steve laid down on the couch under his blanket and cried himself to sleep.
“It’s been months.” Bucky said as he took a sip from his root beer, “I would never be mad at you, Marco.  I just thought it would be a good idea for us to take some time apart.”
As their wine was being poured, Tony waved the menus away and ordered 2 filets with potatoes.  He extended his hand across the table, Steve grabbed it to hold.
When Carol stood, she said “This place is incredible!  It seems just like a luxury apartment.  I think it’s nicer than our place.”  Her loose curls were bouncing as she glanced around the beautifully decorated room.
Sitting up to push Steve backward, he grabbed both his legs and slipped him onto his back.  Looming over the bigger man, Bucky kissed up and down his neck, moaning at the taste of him.
Tony barely spoke to him when he would come in the kitchen and see the beautiful spread.  He always ate everything at least, even though Tony knew Steve was trying desperately to get on his good side.
Wanda suddenly came outside and squealed happily when she saw her friend.  She was pretty drunk.  When the two attempted to hug, she lost her balance and laughed out loud.  Steve caught her.
As Bucky climbed off the couch and scurried into the bathroom down the hall, the post-nut clarity hit Steve pretty hard.
“Also!” he yelled, keeping everyone’s attention.  Tony stuck his ring finger into Steve’s flute to fish out the gold diamond and sapphire lined ring.  He wiped off his hand with his pocket square, also ditching the cloth on the table.  Swiftly, Tony got down on one knee.  A few gasps and woops came from the crowd.  Steve looked bewildered as he met his boyfriend’s eyes.  Happy immediately moved the area chair out of their way, so everyone in the open living room could see.
“So it was you.” Tony said from the couch, “You what, snuck into that party?  You asked me about our relationship to get information and then reported us to the Army for nepotism.”
Bucky had been crying every night lately.  He had been wanting a drink so bad, it was necessary for him to attend some AA meetings.  Not once did he share about himself.  He just wanted SOME way to get out the pent up sadness and frustration.
“I mean, sure it’s tempting.  I make a point to tell my bosses and coworkers right away that I am a recovering addict.  I am usually not tempted after that because I know they will be watching me extra close.”
Nervously, Bucky brushes his shoulder length hair again and adjusts his prosthetic in the mirror a thousand times.  Marco calls on the box, Bucky buzzes him in and he takes a deep breath before opening the door.
Looking a little offended, then happy, Tony told him  “It’s absolutely fine, honeybun.  You can have your very own office to do with what you please.  You’re in the military, it makes sense that you are interested in these things.  The men in your family were all soldiers and that’s pretty cute that you want to know everything about them.”
“That’s the plan.  Therapy is supposed to help me work my way to that point.”  When he said that, his face went from sad to worse.
“You’re so sweet.” she told Bucky loudly over the music, “You’re getting a big tip at the end of the night.”
“I was just being nice.  We were celebrating our engagement, I thought you knew.  I’m so sorry for the confusion.” she said, sympathy in her voice.
When they pulled apart, and he saw any and all emotion vanish from Steve, he told him “I don’t want to ruin what other people have for my own selfish reasons.  I came here to run away from the last time I did that.  I don’t want you to feel guilty either.”
“I was thinking, ya know,” Steve said, “I should try to go for a job where I could maybe use my artistic skills.”
“Yeah, definitely.” said Bucky over his shoulder, “Let's get you a drink before we park on the floor.”
“I am.” cried Steve, shaking his head and gently taking away his boyfriends hands.  “I’m not pitying myself, Tony.  It’s been awful living with what I did to you, to us.  I kept letting it go on and on when I could have stopped.”
Bucky shrugged and sipped his coffee,  “I brought it on myself, I suppose.  I’m still standing, though.”
“I'd like some…” Steve’s email notification on his phone interrupted him.  He reached over to the nightstand on his side and grabbed it.  “Oh yeah, I was expecting an important package.  It’s already been delivered.  I have to run to my place to get it before work.  Sorry babe, I don’t think I have time.”
Steve laid down under the covers first, “We just hung out and talked.”  He let himself sink into his plush pillows that matched the deep red duvet.  The bed shifted as Tony climbed in next to him and propped up on his side to face him.  “What did you guys talk about?”  He was really pressing for more details.
As they faced each other in the middle of the dance floor, quite a few lustful eyes were scanning over them.
“It’s a black suit in a dark place.  They’d never know.” whispered Tony seductively, “We could get a table in the corner, sit side by side under a long table cloth…”
“I’m burning everything right NOW!  You can’t disagree!  I’m fucking doing it.” says Bucky, trying to sound stern.
Previously during his tour in Pakistan, Steve saved his entire team from terrorists and on the way out, his lifelong best friend Bucky, was blown up and lost an arm.  Luckily, Bucky survived but Steve hadn’t seen him in years since he was honorably discharged.
Slowly, he made his way into the bedroom and was greeted with the sight of his friend sleeping in his own bed, face down in his clothes.
After dinner, Tony announced that he needed to take off and make it to an early breakfast meeting the next morning.
The pair had been friends for about 6 years, since they met each other at a veterans day festival.  Steve was sent home from the army after he developed PTSD and could no longer serve on the battlefield.
That made Steve grit his teeth together.  He’s causing him stress.  “I’m sorry, Buck.” he breathed out.
A few people came by to say hi to Steve or Tony since almost his entire staff was at the party.  Steve would introduce each person to Bucky every time and watch him get nervous and quiet.
Steve shook his head "I don't care where we are for Christmas. I just want to cover our bases before we just move somewhere.  I know you've always kind of had money and lived this lifestyle but our cost of living has gotten steeper.  I haven't even gone back to work yet and you had to take care of all those medical bills and our suite."
It had been about 2 years since he had seen his friend and almost a year since he had a good phone number for him.
Goosebumps started to spread all over the larger man’s skin while he hugged the couch pillow under him and closed his eyes.
“Rhodey had just been cheated on and we were there to cheer him up.” Tony said calmly, still giving him a disappointed expression, “We talked about cheating, how it’s stupid and not worth it.  We made a pact to call and talk to each other if an opportunity presented itself.  Ring a bell?”
They finished their meal in silence.  Tony was the first to stand and announce he had to get going.  His car was already downstairs waiting for him.  He put on his coat and glanced back at Steve at the top of the stairs leading down to the front door.  “Thanks for breakfast.  I should be back by 4 or so.”
Pleasantly agreeing, Steve announced to him that he was almost completely finished packing and soon he could officially change his address.  He told him he had a day off so as not to rouse questions.
Bucky appeared at the door, clean shaven with his hair in a bun.  He was dressed in a tight black shirt and dark washed jeans that were painted on.  “What’s up?” he said happily, letting him inside.  Steve looked around, “Wow, they spruced up the place since we came here last.”  Most of the walls had new shelves on them.  Pictures of his family and random trinkets sat on them.  “Seems like you have been too.” he added.
It was like they were secretly playing house and just eating it up while they could with no plan of how long it would go on.
Tony actually laughed at that and leaned his now dry naked ass against his man’s thick pants.  (They were surprisingly soft on the outside.)
Bucky looked up at the ceiling and picked up the phone to hold it up closer to his mouth.  He had to wait to stop crying and calm himself down enough to speak.
“After that, things just slowly...escalated, ya know?” Buck added, finally returning his gaze.  His eyes looked a little glossy.
Tony audibly gulped when Steve fully grabbed him to start stroking.  “The movers are here with you, I presume?”
Bucky spread his cheeks with both hands and began a deep rhythm.  Steve cried out with each thrust against his ass.
Tony wasn’t moving, he wasn’t talking, he just stared furiously at him.  His thoughts were too chaotic to put them into words.
Everything seemed to crash down on Bucky, making him hug tighter and full on sobbed into Steve’s shoulder.  The hand that wasn’t rubbing his back cradled his head.
"Please," smiled Steve, pressing his lips against his ear to breathlessly address him as "Mister Stark."
“I know.” Bucky whimpered, “I can promise nothing like that will happen again.  This whole time I should have at least done the right thing and offered to start those payments to you as well.  I do have some money saved up a little, for the record.  I was just...scared and ashamed and I have been staying away so as to not to make it worse.”
When he felt it was enough, Tony started to thrust two fingers into his tight opening.  He then started to pulse them in a medium rhythm.  “God dammit!” groaned Steve when his boyfriend hit his prostate.  After a few minutes of stretching him, Tony finally began to get ready to push himself in.
“He has a sick wife at home.” said Steve, popping some pretzels in his mouth, “That’s why he feels like he has to work all the time.”
“Gotcha.” said Steve casually.  Bucky grabbed his duffel bag and went back into the dining room to ask Steve for a hug.
“Want to talk it out?!” Bucky’s voice raised, “Fine!  Here’s how things are going to go...I’m going to go ANYWHERE else right now so you can get your stuff out of here.  Then, you will give me space and keep communication to a minimum via phone only.  I will work, I will pay Tony back with interest, and I will find another place that I paid for MYSELF.”
Steve smirked, “He’s probably making you a drink.”  They could hear things being poured and a few muttered curse words.
“I...I’m not sure,” the man on the phone stammered, “I...I didn’t want to...do this over the phone.”
The two of them fumbled and Steve basically leaned with both hands on Natasha’s shoulders while she braced herself on the hand rails and they reached the living room.
Steve shook his head, “I know, I just...don’t think I want to be in the Army anymore.  Now I feel more unwanted than ever.  I would rather do something I LIKE to do.”
“Of course he does, what’s not to like?” said Steve, amused.  He cleared his throat, “I actually...should have probably suggested she not get so drunk tonight.  I hope Nat wasn’t too embarrassing.”
He still was jogging with Sam every morning and doing meditative yoga, (still not telling him what happened with Bucky) only letting him know he and Tony were having issues.  Sam thought it was normal for a couple getting used to living with each other.
The day finally came for Tony to go to his meeting at the Army base.  They were going to tell him their decision whether or not to honor their contract with Stark Industries.  Steve’s part in the investigation was no longer applicable since he left the military willingly.
Bucky looked up and shrugged, "I'm down for whatever. I will say however, I am tired of sitting around here trapped in my bad thoughts."
“Le Bernardin?” Steve said, unsure of how to say it, “It’s one of those French places Tony likes where I can’t read the menu.”
Pain killers were necessary to get the man through the day so that meant he couldn’t drink during one of the most stressful times of his life.
Tony sat them down on his massive sectional and sighed, “I got a very upsetting email earlier.  Apparently I need to go into the Army headquarters for an interview pertaining to...a conflict of interest case?”
“I didn’t think you were judging!  I was just saying I know I wasn’t ever...dating men before and I didn’t know I would ever pursue something like this.”
“Sorry I’m being short with you.  I’m not trying to be.  I’m having a hard time and I don’t feel like talking.”
“I’m thinking it’s just because me and my co-workers have been talking about Tony and I moving in together nonstop.  Anyone could have overheard or talked about me in passing.”
“Tony,” she said, putting her hands together in a praying position, “you were hurt.  If for whatever reason, they let this crazy man out of jail, I want to be ready.”
Steve gave him a soft kiss and thanked him.  “Of course, sweetness.” smiled Tony,   “C’mon, let’s get in bed and drink some sleepytime tea while we look over some therapist listings.  How’s that sound?”  He agreed and followed the shorter man downstairs.
Steve made sure Bucky’s coworkers weren’t within earshot, then glanced over at Bucky mixing drinks a few steps away.  “Basically, he cheated on someone.”
Bucky watched him cook for a second then saw a sort of realization and horror crawl over Steve’s face.
Tony did keep a panic button hidden in the office and kitchen.  Fuck, why didn’t he spring for the one by the front door?  “What exactly
He decided that would be too aggressive, so he decided to try to figure out how to facilitate Bucky instead.   “I guess we should discuss what you want to do next.”
As Bucky started to make eggs, bacon, and toast, his heart hammered in his chest as he thought about talking to Steve about the previous day.
He had assured the older man many times that he wouldn’t hurt him.  It was okay to be more coarse with Steve.
“Mph,” groaned Tony, “I can arrange to stay working from home so we can do yoga and have sex constantly.”  Steve rolled his eyes and smiled at him.  He realized how long it had really been since they had sex.  Since the fighting started, Steve wasn’t even able to masturbate due to sadness then he got busy with keeping an eye on his injured boyfriend.
Steve slipped off his camo jacket to reveal a tight white cotton undershirt.  He nodded and sat at the bar to remove his house key, “Yeah, so I needed to give you this.”
“No.  The whole thing’s just strange, unexpected.  That’s what Bucky and I talked about.” shrugged Steve.  Tony’s eyes continued to scan over his man’s face, “Were you upset?”
Bucky picked up his mug of coffee, “I got out of there and drove away through the night.  Then I came to the only friend that was close enough and I thought he could help me.  That’s it.”
“Steven Grant Rogers,” smiled Tony, staring into his eyes “You are the man of my dreams.  You are the one who saved my life, who took care of me, and kept me going.  I’ve known I’ve loved you since the moment I met you.  Nothing can ever change that, baby.  Please do me the greatest honor of marrying me?”
Tony was staring in horror and urging his boyfriend on silently, flinching every time a hit connected.  A few more punches landed around Steve’s eye.  The two men on the floor rolled over completely as Frank would not let go of the gun.  In the struggle, a shot went off.
She looked over the two of them, suddenly sad and pouting.  “It’s my job but also...you guys are my friends and I care about you.”
They gossiped for a while.  When there was a lull in the conversation, Steve looked over to the kitchen to see Natasha and Bucky still giggling together.
good for us.  After that last phone call we had, it just sounded like a goodbye.  I applied for jobs all over the place right before I sold my bar and I saw it as fate that my interview was here.”
Steve grabbed his full bottle and nodded.  They headed to the floor where the music was much louder and the air was much hotter and humid due to the bodies and bright lights.
While they agreed to come over, Rhodey was still on the fence about trusting Steve but was still respectful to him.  Ultimately he had to tell himself that if the man saved Tony’s life, his best friend, then he couldn’t be all bad.
“I know but I want a bigger, stronger, reinforced bed so I can fuck you more.” said the sultry voice on the phone.
The long haired man scratched his beard and looked around the room like he was being pranked.  “Are you sure?  After what I…everything?”
Sam encouraged him to come back to the group therapy as well as his current counseling.  Steve assured him it would be too much for him to do all that.  It was already hard for Steve to focus on anything but he and Bucky’s drama.  Bringing up old experiences in Pakistan was just going to make it harder for him.
It was 8 in the morning.  Bucky woke up from a nightmare, shirtless in a cold sweat.  He’d only gone to sleep 3 hours before.
Finally making eye contact, Bucky asked, “So you think I don’t blame myself or take partial responsibility?  I feel like shit.” He let out a bitter laugh, “You know that, right?”
Tony smiled fondly, “Yeah?  Let’s spend a few nights there together.  Ya know, to say goodbye to the old place.”
Tony tipped his head back against his shoulder to listen better, “H’m gonna miss you too.  It’s...just...ugh...4 days or so.”
"We don't need to make any commitments yet.  I just need to browse with you and get your input.  I kind of want our place to be a surprise when you move in."
“So, they think that’s because of you.  Like what if SI does a good job so you guys are happy with it?  Shit.” scoffed Bucky, “That’s not your fault, Steve.  Sounds like someone is in your business.  You got a rat on your hands.”
Steve started to drink one of his beers when he noticed a handsome guy sitting a few feet away checking out his friend.
The next morning, when Bucky woke up he expected Steve to be cooking breakfast after his run with Sam.
Clearing her throat, Natasha said, “Hey, why don’t we start going back to karaoke on Wednesdays?  Just you, me and Wanda.  Like old times.”
With a shake of his head, Steve said softly, “Tony, I didn’t mean that.  We’re too angry, we’re saying things-”
Steve and Tony met when he got his base job.  Tony was the head weapons specialist at Stark Industries.  The Army employed the genius/mechanic to maintain the operation software for the base weapons used for training.
Frank sighed and took off his coat, tossing it on top of the dining table.  He began to pace and rub his head like he was in pain.  “Do I have to gag you?  Or I could just knock you out so you can’t scream.”  The nostrils on his giant down-turned nose flared.
That got a small side smile out of Steve as he fussed with his tea bag.  “Totally!  I’m actually...kind of bummed to be moving out of this neighborhood.”
Steve does make plans with Sam to come over to his new place more often so that they could do something other than jog together.  Natasha had told Steve she wanted to come to his new place as well.  They no longer saw each other every day and she needed to update him on all the new work gossip.
“Ugh!  You’re exactly what she goes for.” Wanda huffed, drinking more water, “If you find her, she’ll definitely flirt with you.  Watch.”
“Well, as you may understand, I am hesitant to continue this business arrangement while my boyfriend was forced to quit.”
Steve assumed there were silent tears falling down his cheeks but he couldn’t look at him, “I just wish I could take this away from you.  Remember what I told you in the Hospital?  You saved the entire platoon.”
Steve got up to sit next to him on the couch and put his arm around his shoulders.  Slowly, Bucky’s head tipped over to rest on Steve’s.
“Oh, you son-of-a-bitch!”  Sam yelled, trying to run as fast as Steve on the track around the empty football field.  They usually met at the track field early in the morning to train, 5 days a week.
He should have noticed that he had a prosthetic arm but Bucky was wearing gloves and his hair was longer and hung around his face, neatly over one eye.  It appeared he was starting to wake up.  “S-Steve?” he said, looking relieved, “Steve.”
Steve gave him a peck on the lips, “Thanks.  Just pour some more seafood dip, crackers, and put out the rest of the cheese platter.”  He started to back away to the door, watching his lover wave him away and start peering into the fridge.
“Not exactly” said Tony bitterly, letting his eyes drift around Rhodey’s house, “...especially since I was lied to.  I can move past it eventually but I’m not
The man was in a dark brown trench coat, staring at his phone.  He had a brunette buzzcut and was peering around carefully, glancing once at Tony and then back at his phone.
“That’s not it at all!” protested Steve, holding his coffee so he had something for his hands to do.  “I only have one more load of boxes and I wanted to get them over to the penthouse.  I also barely slept thinking about this whole...situation and how I feel bad that it felt good.”
Tony re-emerges with bottled water and gets down to sit on the rug next to his boyfriend. He rubbed Steve's back slowly as he drank it.  "Small sips, baby."
“No, he kind of asked me some questions about her.  She has been busy lately, I guess they’ve been hanging out.”
Bucky fidgeted with his jacket buttons while he spoke “A few things have happened and I have really just been wanting to talk to my best friend about it.  I didn’t talk to anyone about us or what happened either.  I’ve just been...by myself.”
"Ya know," Bucky said thoughtfully, "I seem to run to you every time I go through something in my life."
“Kind of slow until about midnight then we got a rush of lesbian roller derby chicks.  It was wild.” Bucky told him, glancing over his book at his shirtless friend.
“Yeah, but he couldn’t possibly afford all the bills at that place.” said Tony, “So I guess, I’ll have to just take over the lease and let him pay utilities.”
“No, no.  I’m sorry I snuck out of bed.  I woke up and couldn’t go back to sleep.”  Steve told him, putting the album into an open box next to him.  He turned his music off on his phone.
“Why don’t I leave a little early for work and go get one made for me?” Bucky suggested as he took the key from him.
“Me?  Tired of this?” asked Tony, grabbing the man’s muscular ass.  The movement made their cocks rub together.
Tony pulled him down for their lips to meet.  This kiss was stern and purposeful, communicating appreciation.  Their lips didn’t move much, just stayed pressed firmly together for a few minutes.
Frank had his hands in his deep, seemingly full pockets.  In a paranoid sort of way, the taller man looked around him to check for other people.  Frank stared at the security camera outside and in the corner of the lobby.  He shifted his hands so they were low and hidden.
Tony’s body went limp as he leaned back against the headboard and sighed.  He started to think about how Bucky hadn’t contacted him personally.  The last time he heard anything from the man was when Steve had officially moved in.  Bucky insisted to pay Tony back as soon as possible for the rent.  The conclusion they reached was that they should meet up and talk about it, but that never happened and it had been months now.
“Some cocktails, sushi...maybe invite some people over to eat it with us.” said Tony, putting his arms around Steve’s hips, “How’s that sound?”
“No, I’m not regretting it.” he interrupted, “I just...I feel bad for not feeling bad.  Does that make sense?”
Steve read directly from the letter open in front of him, “I am being investigated for ‘conflict of interest’ and could potentially be discharged and/or terminated for ‘violating my contract’.”
It had been a few months.  Tony and Steve were just moving into their new place, a lavish, modern house with more bedrooms and less floors in Southeast Brooklyn.  Steve had finally convinced him it was a good place to live.
“Understandable.  You don’t need to be scared of me though.” said Tony, “Of Course I was angry for a while and I still am but I have definitely evened out.  I was betrayed, sure, but I can be an adult and know when to move on.”
"Make me cum. Show me what a good slut you are." Moaned Tony being pushed over the edge at that moment.
Tony smirked across the candle lit table, “So, I have something to ask you...and I just thought this was perfect timing since it’s our anniversary.  Feel free to say no if you don’t feel ready yet.  I will totally understand.”
Steve's smile dropped and he tilted his head back, "I can't go back to doing nothing like when I was on leave. I'm going to go crazy."
Bucky shrugged and leaned against the fridge on the other side of the kitchen, “I’m fine.  Just waiting for my coffee.”
Bucky furrowed his brow and glanced over at the man in question then looking back to Steve.  “Put your arm around me.”
It was good that Steve did acknowledge that his friend was intentionally being short with him and that was okay if it was helpful to setting new boundaries between them.  However, Steve eventually let him know that he decided to go to therapy for their situation because he could barely sleep anymore.
“So we are giving him 4 weeks to get his own place?  You tell him that already?” asked Tony flatly as he dried his face on a towel.
Sometimes Steve couldn’t sleep and had to go to the couch on his own.  He would put music on in his headphones to zone out, listening to Sia and his sad emo ballads from the early 2000’s.  He no longer could go to bed with silence at all anymore.  A distraction was necessary for him to shut up his brain long enough and get any rest.
"There are so many...I want...to crawl into bed with you when I come home and I see you asleep like an angel. Sometimes it looks so comforting and warm that I can't stand it.  I want to hold you and be able to kiss you when you’re sad.  I want to go with you as a date to parties and functions.  I want to fight anyone that makes you cry.”
“In my country, we call it ‘thandayo’...like he thinks you are the most beautiful person in his life.” she thought for a moment, “I guess, he has fondness?  Steve looks at you like you hung the moon.”
“We were physical multiple times in that week.  He basically has been pushing me away since then, that’s why we don’t hang out.” Steve said, “I...searched for a reason I would allow myself to do something like that.  I don’t have one for you.  I was just...an asshole.”  His tears fell silently down his cheeks as he checked Tony’s expression.
“Absolutely, go on.  I’ll bring you a drink.” smiled Tony, making sure to check out his boyfriend.  He was in grey slacks and a light blue button up collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  Tony was in a more casual t-shirt blazer combo with slacks, but Steve insisted he wear his slacks that hug his ass the tightest.
“Don’t worry about it.  That’s chump change and I want you to be able to have anything in the kitchen you’re heart desires.”
“You’ve already asked me that tonight.  He’s fine, showing signs of socializing more and it seems to be good for him.  He’s even been talking to his family more.”
Steve chuckled, “Pepper always insists on the best.”  He led him down the hallway to the living room area.  As they stepped into the room, Bucky noticed Tony sitting on the couch in his arm sling and thick red sweater.  His pants were very chic black sweatpants.  It was hard for him to make eye contact with the older man.
“After I heal a little more, sure.” he nodded.  That made Steve hopeful.  He relayed the information to Bucky.  Tony pulled him to lay down with him as Steve put his phone on charge.  They settled in for the night, knowing neither of them were likely to sleep.
“I didn’t tell you anything and I should have.” Steve told him, managing to hold back his tears.  He needed to stare down at the floor so as to not look at the look on Tony’s face.
“No.  Look, don’t worry about it.  They’ll question you, they’ll question me, then my superior and decide what to do.  Most likely they will just find a new company to work with besides yours.  I don’t want that to happen.”
Steve went into the humid bathroom to find his boyfriend drying off.  “Hey.” he smiled.  Tony looked him over, noticing he was wearing all his clothes including his coat and socks, “Going somewhere?”
“The world stopped turning when I realized he shot you.” said the taller man, sounding like he was choking back tears.
Just then, Steve’s phone started to ring.  It was Tony.  The blonde caught his breath and answered it on facetime immediately.  “Hey hun, you on your way?” he answered cheerily, some leftover giggles creeping up.  Steve panned the camera over so Bucky could be seen over his shoulder.  “Hey!  Me and Sugarbear-'' Tony showed Rhodey briefly beside him, “should be there in about 15 minutes.  We’re going to that Columbian steakhouse.  Sounds good?  You want to come with Buck, bring your manbun, maybe some harem pants, birkenstocks?”
“That’s not true.” sniffs Steve, “I’m the fucked up one.  I’m never satisfied and I’m selfish.  I just care about you.  I hate myself for doing this to you and Tony.”
Bucky grabbed a receipt he had just printed and grabbed a clipboard and pen, “Do you want me to tell him to fuck off, Nat?”
With a soft smile, Tony told him “Look, I know how hard this has been for all of us and I’m quite frankly, tired of it.  Life doesn’t need to be hard anymore.  We as humans don't know how much time we have left.  Just keep the intentions strictly friendly with Steve and everything will be fine.”
“Oh God, I’m so sorry I didn’t reply right away!  I’ve been at the base with my phone off.  I just got your messages.” she said frantically, “Are you guys okay?”
“About?” Natasha asked.  Bucky just looked away, obviously trying to come up with an easy lie to tell.  “You can talk to me about stuff, ya know?” she assured him, “I’m a great listener and I’m always here.”
The question made Bucky pause before he reached the shoe rack against the front door.  Turning to him and looking at the phone in his hand, he seemed scared.
“Baby, don’t do that.  I can fix this.  Contracts are legally binding.  They can’t just throw out the one with my company.” He held both of Steve’s hands in his.  “We can fix this.”
“That’s easily done!  I was saying I would try harder to do that last night.” smiled Steve, “I fucking miss you at night too.”
The elevator left then dinged again, this time his boyfriend emerged.  He didn’t look pleased or excited and he was fiddling with his smartwatch.
Natasha knew Steve came clean to Tony, meaning it had to be in the back of Bucky’s mind.  She wanted to make sure that Bucky wasn’t just forcing himself to socialize with people so he wouldn’t seem weird.
Everyone knows how scandalous it is for a woman to be cheated on with another man but her OWN BROTHER?  Unforgivable.
“I told you,” Bucky replied without looking at him, “I always run to you because you’re…familiar and comforting.  Always been a good friend to me.”
Bucky’s phone was propped up against the wall on the counter and he was using his one hand to zoom in and out of a picture.  His breathing was heavy and for a second it almost sounded like he was sobbing.
“Did you go to Tony’s earlier?” asked Bucky, washing the pot and scooping the fresh coffee into the filter.
“Yeah!  I just cleaned the sheets and I’ll be out here fucking around.  Feel free to sleep as long as you need to.”
It was too dark in the living room for Steve to see clearly but he didn't move as the outline of Tony’s head laid on his chest.  Tony covered the two of them in a large blanket.
“I know.” Bucky said, fidgeting with his fabricated hand.  “The dreams just...give me phantom limb pain.”
Bucky went to pull back since he was practically sharing breath with Steve and their lips brushed together.
Excitedly, Tony slid out of his side of the booth and stepped over to Steve’s side to lean down and kiss him.  They both laughed as they pulled back since the waiter stood around holding their desserts.  He was trying not to interrupt.
"I will make coffee then. That sounds nice actually." She said, going over to the pot on the counter.
“I told you before that I was going to bed.  You just need to realize that things will never be the same between me and you.  Even if time goes by and we heal, it’s still just not going to be like it was.  So just leave me alone.”
Quietly, Steve made his way in the bathroom and listened to his boyfriend sing, “...just a beast under your bed.  In your closet in your-”
Tony started to cut and eat his chicken, "So Bucky, I've heard some things about you but not much. Where are you from?"
Bucky noticed his change in demeanor and pulled him in for another immersive kiss.  It was just to wipe the sadness away.
“No,” urged Bucky, “tell me what you’re thinking.”  Keeping his tone friendly, he scooted even closer in case he needed to take the blonde’s hand.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” asked Bucky as if that was a stupid question.  He slipped on a shirt of his with the name of a metal band across it.
Bucky had made the wise decision of putting a towel nearby for the amount of times they were grabbing at each other.
They were already Facebook official, meaning things must have been going on for  a while if they are serious.  Steve’s mind was racing.  He couldn’t decide if it was any of his business or not.
He got a text from Natasha saying she spent 2 hours on the phone with him and she promised her help for his and Tony’s situation.  They also made plans to meet up for coffee that week.
As he set the glass down delicately, he heard Tony’s voice even though it was low.  “God, you’re beautiful.”
“No, it’s not just that.” said Steve, “I’ve just felt this...depression and I can’t make it go away.  I feel like I can’t sleep and I can’t focus right now.”
The two lab partners had been getting to know one another for the past couple of months but lately, Tony moved Peter’s weekly time in the lab from 2 days to 4.  They had a lot more time to talk.  Of course Tony still felt guilty looking at him with a lustful eye.  Although, Peter was devastatingly cute.
The waitress came by and gave them the check.  Bucky did pull out his wallet but Steve insisted that he pay.  They went back to Steve’s place in silence.
He was more drunk on that than all the alcohol he’d consumed that night.  The knowledge that he put that good mood back into Bucky felt like such a reward.
The palms of Steve's hands made a slap noise when they hit the surface. On instinct, he was arching his back perfectly like a feline. "That gorgeous body." groaned Tony, lightly grabbing the man's throat with his right arm.  "Can I get you ready for me?  I need you right now."
They both sat down on the floor together.  “You know,” she said, “I have been hanging out with Bucky from time to time but I promise my intentions are friendly.”
Bucky got himself a bottle of water and the two of them went over to the benches behind a wall so the music wasn’t so loud.  It was dark back there with Rainbow lights in facing every direction.
Bucky started to go to the table but Tony stopped him and held out his hand to shake.  “Good to meet you, Bucky.”
A desperate whimper came out of Tony’s throat while he closed his eyes.  A few tears fell down his cheeks as Frank told him “I know you aren’t used to being told what to do.  I have the fucking gun, and I’m in charge here.  Shut.  Up.”
Tony arrived about half an hour later, Happy Hogan emerged out of the elevator first, holding Stark’s bags.
Bucky swallowed some food before stating, "My dad was crass as ever.  I had to put him in his place."
"Yes." He grunted when Tony's hand stroked him a little. With a slight pushiness, the older man grabbed his lover by the hips and bent Steve over the built in shower bench.
His uniform was button down shirts and a tie, (vests encouraged) meaning he was going to need to go shopping for some nicer clothes.
“In a way, yes.” Bucky nodded.  “Me too.” said Steve, smiling at the both of them.  Tony put a standup comedy special on TV.  The three of them watched it, laughing and smiling together.  Things finally seemed normal, like they were going to be okay.
Leaning forward, Bucky said “Look, I’m sorry I have been so distant and rude.  You know I have been dealing with things on my own and I just wanted to get out of your way.”  “I know.” nodded Steve, his large biceps flexing.
Sitting back and sighing pleasantly, Steve said "Wow, that's really nice. That's progress.  He just opened up to you?"
Steve glanced over at Natasha who was getting up to go to the bathroom.  He instinctively slid her belongings closer to him on the bar.
That statement shocked Steve, “You mean that?”  He still looked sad.  Steve himself wasn’t sure if that was the fair thing to do.
“Well how do you know?  If that was true, that you two are ‘best friends’,  I wouldn’t have been able to date you for 2 years without meeting him.  Maybe you aren’t as close as you thought if he ignores you.”
Steve took his shoes off and nodded to Bucky to do the same. “I have one bedroom and the other is my office.  So, do you want to take a nap in my room or the couch?”
“Typical,” sneered the man struggling in Steve’s hold, “never notice what’s right in front of you.”  Catching Steve off guard, Frank managed to grab the gun around the man’s hands.  They started to fight over it.  Punches started to land, a few around Frank’s jaw and nose.
It was like he knew he was being lied to years ago but now it was being confirmed.  Of course Steve understood he was coming out of a medically induced coma after being bombed.
“I’ll put up this package and make a phone call.  Then I have to change and we can go out to breakfast, okay?” said Steve.
The three men happily went up to Natasha’s apartment.  It was a pretty spacious loft full of people laughing and holding hors devours or alcohol.
Steve’s pulse sped up and he bit his lip.  His heart flooded with warmth.  “I’m so lucky to have you, Tony.  You’ve shown me things I would have never seen on my own.  I’ve never had a love like this.”
When Steve’s alarm went off on his phone at 6AM the next morning, the two of them groaned at how tired they were.  Tony instinctively crawled off of him so he could get up.
“I haven’t really been sleeping and it’s been catching up to me late at night by the time my shift is almost over.  I feel like I’m going to die sometimes from exhaustion.”  said Bucky.
Somehow Bucky still didn’t seem phased.  “I don’t know…even after all he did for me...I’m not really sure if I’d call that love.” he replied, pulling his mouth into a hard line.
The music was starting to become techno ballads.  A DJ announced that it was time for the last call for alcohol.
Tony’s eyes finally met the blue ones staring down at him, “I mean, haven’t you thought about it?  Do you want to live where I was shot?  Where there is still blood on the placemats from a traumatic experience?”
After doing the dishes, Steve started to obsess about what he should wear.  It was the week before Halloween so it was chilly but he also didn’t want to make it seem like he was trying to dress up.
“I know, baby.  Wanna g-give it to you...all the time.  Mmm!” moaned Tony, his eyes closed and his hips thrusting forward against his hand.
Steve sat back in his dining chair and crossed his arms defensively.  His stomach was tight and tense.
“Koy must have just got in my head.” he thought to himself, changing into real pants.  “I was just...being too affectionate...I WAS the one leaning in, I think.  Got caught up in the moment."
“You know I care about you.  We’ve been friends forever, that’s not for no reason.”  typed Bucky, “I know I shouldn’t have confessed my feelings when I did.  I know I should have said something a long time ago.  However, you can’t put me somewhere I don’t belong.”  He hated the feeling of tears stinging his eyes.
“I want your attention because when I get it, it feels like a reward.  But Stevie, I...can’t break up another relationship.” Bucky said with a cracking voice.
She noticed, starting to read him a little better.  That was her job, after all, to notice things.  “Last time we hung out, he said you and him haven’t seen each other since you moved out.  Are you partly sad because you had to leave Bucky all alone?”
Natasha sighed and opened the door.  She ushered him through the door and sat him down on the bottom step.  “I know you miss him, sweetness.” she said, sitting next to him.
Marco giggled back, leaning his head down to suck on Bucky’s earlobe.  With a shiver, Bucky managed to move around enough to shut and lock the door.
“It’ll be okay, baby.  I’ll make sure of it.” said Tony, kissing his forehead, “You don’t have to worry about anything anymore.  I’m here to help.”  He held his boyfriend until the blonde fell fast asleep.
“You did, okay?  You did stop him.  I’ll be alright, I’m just never coming back there.  So you can make sure everyone knows they’ll never see me again.”
With a single laugh, Bucky said, “Um...I don’t really know.  Maybe once I settle in I can figure that out.”
The two men had to wait to be approached by the waitress to take their drink orders as the menus were at the tables.  Business was in full breakfast rush, so they knew they had a few minutes.
Dressed in the deep navy cable knit sweater, Steve made him a big old fashioned breakfast that morning.  There was bacon, eggs, toast, fruit, and hashbrowns all plated impressively at the dining table.  Tony came in and saw the man already sitting at the table, pouring coffee into both of their mugs.
They got up and got changed.  Steve loaned Bucky a button down black shirt of his that fit him a little bit tighter than it did on his own body.
Tony turned off the music from his smartwatch, getting the attention of most of the crowd in their open living area.  Steve’s eyes darted from the bottom of his champagne to Tony’s face, “Tony…”  The older man cleared his throat and started to tap his drink glass with the edge of his metal wrist watch.
They got up to the apartment and Steve sat at the dining table immediately and laid one ear on his arm across it.  “Alright, time for meatball sandwiches.”
When Steve finally looked at him with his red and glossy eyes, he looked so weak and helpless.  It reminded Bucky of when they were younger and Steve was the smaller one that he had to protect from bullies.
As the two friends sat at the bar, Bucky greeted them happily from behind it.  He introduced them to his co-workers, Koy and Scott.
“Look, the DA seems to be making an example of him.” said Tony, pointing at the TV, “They are already talking about pushing for better background checks in the military.”
“Why are YOU sorry?  I did it to myself.  I walked around all over the city before work to clear my head but then I was tired from my long walk so that didn’t help-”
Groaning playfully, Bucky leaned forward and let himself be pulled into a tight embrace.  His scruffy chin rested on the blonde man’s broad muscular shoulder.
“I have been worried about you too.” said Bucky, “Since that asshole broke into your place.  That’s what I dream about.  Losing you forever without...getting to say goodbye.”  His voice cracked as he started to cry.  In a flash Steve was kneeling down in front of him on the carpet. “Hey, hey...Buck, I’m okay.  Tony will be okay too.”
Bucky looked so perfect, with the romantic lighting in the bar and his hair looking so soft and framing his face.  Bucky’s expression one of admiration and innocence.
Steve thought to himself how to put it in the right words.  His eyes drifted across the bed over the filigree pattern on their blanket.  “Have you looked at Facebook recently?”  “Yeah,” answered Tony flatly, “why?”  “Did you see that Bucky is in a relationship?”  “I did.” Tony nodded.
Tony slowly bobbed his head on him a few times, hearing the hiss of approval above him.  He shifted his eyes, stared up at his man, and pulled his mouth off him with a pop.  “Fuck my mouth, sweetheart.” Tony said gently, swallowing him again.  On instinct Steve started to thrust his hips.  They stared into each other’s eyes the whole time.  Steve found that to be incredibly hot.  Tony managed to hold his gaze through faltered breaths and tears filling the brim of his eyes.
Tony’s favorite Pixies album played on their little speaker in the kitchen.  This used to be their ritual for mornings of days when Tony was about to do something that made him nervous like a meeting or presentation.  Since they’d barely spoken, it was surprising to Tony that Steve had even remembered about the meeting at all.
Pulling him back he kissed Tony deeply, sucking on his bottom lip and licking into his mouth, even pulling his hair a little.
Tony’s head snapped over to look at him, “Oh, I am in no way giving you a pass.  Like I said, we’ll have to repair this trust between us.  I’m upset, I just...don’t know what kind of upset to feel.”
Tony cleared his throat to get his attention, making the blonde shut the album suddenly and take off his earbuds.
Bucky shrugged, “I wanted to take you to breakfast, I was in town.  If you don’t have time, I understand.”  He stood up, making his camo-clad friend stand with him.
Bucky swallowed a lump in his throat.  “Uh...not really.  Just some brunette white guy.  It was really dark in there.  You probably even thought he was Tony.”
Over the past few days, Tony was staying over at Steve and Bucky's place. (They officially added Bucky’s name to the lease.)
“Look, you just have to calm down and step back and figure how to fight this.  Wait to see what Tony says.” Bucky said with a small smile, “Alright?”
“Look at you.” smirked Steve.  The men came in holding boxes and unloaded them into the office.  When they left, the two men had some down time.
About 12 came in at once so he had to turn the notifications off while they went through the list of bars and restaurants.  Bucky stood and announced he’d get his shoes.
She got them to fully open up to each other and gave them the emotional tools they needed for the future.
“Oh, they love me since I’m not only there for a paycheck.  I don’t think they’d ever had a teacher get to know them like this before.” Steve said happily.
“We should do this again.” smiled Natasha when they pulled back.  She kept her hands on Bucky’s arms that were still around her.
Bucky’s eyes dropped to the dirt as they reached the start of the running track.  He pretended not to listen as he stretched.
One night that changed when he arrived at home much later and much more drunk than usual.  Natasha had to actually go with him to usher him inside and up the elevator.  They got to his front door that opened to the few steps up to the living room.  She propped his much larger body against the wall while fumbling with Steve’s keys.
“Yeah, that way you get to live here, he has a place and can still save up for a bit, and you can take your time moving.”
The breath punched out of the bigger man when his friend resumed his punishing pace into him.  Swiftly, they both climaxed at the same time, Steve catching his release with his own hand and Bucky in the condom.
He sat up in his bed, trying to even his breathing and relax.  When he finally did, he reluctantly sent Natasha a text asking if she was awake.
“I sold the bar.  I enjoyed doing freelance graphic design at home but I needed something bigger.  There are tons of opportunities out there and I need to use my degree.” Marco said.
The two men untangled and laughed together.  Steve finished his first beer as Bucky snubbed his cigarette.
When Bucky let go and sat down to eat he told him "You didn't have to do my laundry.  I appreciate it."
A week went by of Steve and Bucky starting to text more, making tentative plans to start hanging out again.  Bucky started to keep Tony up to date on when his payments would arrive as well.  It led to them having a few casual conversations as well.  It turned out that both Tony and Bucky were interested in cars.  Bucky’s father used to work on classic cars in Indiana.
“Alright then.  Besides, you said the last time we went to a sports bar that ‘the straights have terrible taste in music’.” laughed Steve, washing his hands.
Bucky snickered, “Madison called me when she found me and Marco.  I was trying to turn the ringer off and get dressed at the same time and I’m...ya know, one fucking handed.  She busted the office door open and I dropped it right into Marco’s fish tank.  Then all hell broke loose, so I said ‘fuck it, I’ll get a new phone’.”
Steve just wanted to reach over the bar and hug him.  “It’s alright, Buck.  You need these things more than I do, and you deserve them.”
“Alright, alright.” smirked Steve, dismounting him.  Tony pouted and resisted a little, making them both laugh.
A few women could be heard squealing silently in the silence.  Steve didn’t dare look at anyone besides the man in front of him that was pouring his heart out.  He couldn’t believe this was happening.
“I need quesadillas and my bed.  I had so much fun though!  I like this place.” she smiled, leaning up to hug him across the bar and wobbling.
Steve had given up on texting Bucky since he would always be short with him and be quick to hostility.
“I do. So...are you saying we’re all made up?” Tony asked, dipping down yet again to assault Steve's neck.
Tony watching the man pace frantically now, muttering to himself while constantly checking his watch.
Eventually, they had to go back to their penthouse to check on the repairs.  The walls were fixed and in the process of being repainted.  One evening when they stopped by,  Tony, still in his sling, walked over to the pile of dining furniture shoved in a corner.  He leaned in further to examine the chairs as Steve watched him from across the room.
Most of the day, Steve was watching his show on Netflix while Tony sat with him, messing around on his tablet.  By the afternoon, Steve was complaining of a hurt stomach again.
Steve’s arms went around the other man’s torso and he hugged him close.  “I love you too, Tony.” he whimpered, “I’m sorry.  I’m so fucking sorry.”  They started to cry together in their tight embrace.
After leaving work at the Army base, he arrived in his small one bedroom apartment to ravage his closet.  It was hard for him to put together the sexiest and fanciest outfit he could since he kept second guessing himself.
“I have been dreaming fucked up shit too.” admitted Bucky, “Isn’t that our thing?”  Shrugging, Steve said “I guess.”  More heavy silence followed.
“Like, let him take over the lease?  That could be okay.” nodded Steve, seeming pleasantly surprised.
His co-worker, Okoye, (most people called her Koy) smiled at him. "Well look what the cat dragged in." She said with her thick African accent coming through.
Almost blacking out, Steve became a muffled noisy mess as his prostate was struck with amazing accuracy continuously.
It was especially hard when Natasha would mention his best friend.  Bucky had to make it seem like Steve had just gotten too occupied with Tony to hang out as much as they used to and he was okay with it.  He was preoccupied too.
Bucky stopped in front of the picture hanging over the kitchen bar, “Is that...the guy you were seeing?”  The picture was taken on a boat in Hampton Beach during a summer vacation.  Tony and Steve were shirtless in their rather skimpy bathing suits and the blonde was being kissed on his cheek and embracing the shorter man.
“Oh yeah?” said Bucky real low, pushing the other man against the wall.  “You just assume I just want to fuck you right now?”  His tone was playful.
Steve’s eyes were twice their normal size as he listened to the man pour his heart out.  Bucky really had been denying himself happiness for a while.
“Um, how are you feeling?” asked Bucky, trying to keep their eyes locked.  “Better, just not my best.” answered Tony, “Doing what I need to.  The doctors say my arm looks good, given the circumstances.”
“I don’t know...something that keeps me busy and on my feet.  I don’t want to wear a dorky hairnet or uniform.  Also I don’t want to get up early in the morning.  You know I’ve always been a night person.”
“The paramedics will come with the police in a few minutes.” muttered Tony weakly, “I should be fine.  I just...feel so stupid.  I am the head of a tech company that is focused on web security and I can’t even SECURE my own home.”
"I know." Said Bucky, shaking his head.  "I even left you alone for a year because I wanted to give us both a chance, and tried to stay out of the way.  I dated.   I wanted you to have happiness even more than I wanted it for myself."
Bucky scoffed, “Well I guess I can have my breakfast and go so you can finish moving.”  It seemed as if he was fighting off his own tears trying to well up and it was making him mad.  He grabbed a bag with a bagel sandwich in it.
That was the meanest thing he had ever said to him.  Even though his boyfriend had been rude to him first, it didn’t make it right.
When they were about to have their post-workout meal all freshly showered, Steve got a call from Tony.  He answered and kept eating, “Hey, you’re on speaker.”
“I just want to get it done.  Bucky and I will pack up some last minute things, and I’ll be right back over.” shrugged Steve.
Pepper went to their penthouse for them to grab them clothing and toiletries.  She also canceled all appointments for Tony for the next 2 weeks.  The two men checked into their empire state view suite and went up to essentially,  a full one bedroom apartment.  Tony immediately went into the bedroom and sat gently on the bed.  Steve looked around the room, opening the giant closet to reveal two white fluffy bathrobes.  “I think we both need to bathe.” Steve said over his shoulder.
Making his way inside, Steve looked toward the balcony door to confirm he was right about Bucky smoking nervously in an oversized hoodie as he waited.  The brunette man had his hair tied up in a half bun and was pacing back and forth.  When he joined him outside, Bucky immediately stopped pacing and exhaled a cloud of smoke.
Scratching the back of his head, Bucky told him “We...hooked up a few times.  He just moved to the city.”
“That’s a good thing, isn’t it?” smiled Sam, drinking some water and putting the bottle on the ground off the track.
That night, after Tony fell asleep (passed out in their bed), Steve had cleaned up the broken vase and made himself comfortable in the living room.  The TV was on, but he wasn’t really watching it.
“She started to get suspicious,” Bucky continued, “when I stopped fucking her completely.  Then she figured it out when she caught us getting dressed in the back office at the bar.  She screamed at the both of us.  I bailed to get my shit from the house and prepared to run away, but...Madison showed up there with her big guido uncle and he got some hits in.  Her brother showed up at the last minute and saved me from certain death.”
Tony cleared his throat to say “Yes, I do.  I think it’s reasonable that you not hang out with Bucky for a while and keep this distance between you.  Ultimately, you had to go to therapy and had chest pains.  This situation has obviously been ripping you apart.  Even though that could have been avoided, it happened...and you have been different lately, probably from organizing your thoughts, right?  The longer you waited, the more it seems to have worn you down.”
Steve poured the bottle of wine he was holding into the pitcher, “I have been talking to people.  Are you drunk?”  “Just tipsy, my love.” smiled Tony, stepping closer to him behind the counter, “I was just about to grab some water, but seriously you’ve done enough.  I’ll be in charge of the refreshments from now on.”  Steve recycled the empty bottle and took a step back, “Are you sure you got this?”
Steve shrugged sadly, “I will stop receiving my leave pay they’ve been giving me at the end of the month.  I guess I need to start setting up interviews and getting that whole process started.”
Bucky scoffed and shook his head, "That’s exactly why we SHOULD drift apart right now, because we love each other."
“I have to find a new job!” Steve said, “I don’t want to rely on Tony taking care of me forever and I have no idea what I am good at other than being in the Army.”
Tony looked over Steve's face and pretended not to notice the sound of Pepper’s high heels clacking up and down the hallway.  She was pacing, that must mean the meeting is soon.
He was dressed and putting on his jacket to leave as he kissed Tony at the door.  “Remember you can come stay with me any night until Friday this week while Buck’s gone.”
Pepper had to resort to hiring a single private driver to take them wherever they needed, constantly changing the type of vehicle so that the photographers wouldn’t notice.  The only good news that came of the incident was that Stark Industries stock was through the roof.
Bucky was saving his paychecks for a place of his own, therefore Steve was pleased with letting him do chores as rent payment.  He honestly never wanted to ask money from Bucky anyway.  What kind of friend would he be?
“I believe that you are upset about this bullshit investigation.  We all are at the office, by the way.  But that’s not what’s making you depressed, I know it’s not.”
Tony sat in the back seat of the black on black luxury SUV when Steve got down to the sidewalk.  The open back window revealed the cheery smile and stunning silver and black suit Tony was wearing.
Steve never took his eyes off his friend as he listened.  His stomach felt like it was tied in knots.  So the guy’s name was Marco.
Steve then realized he was jerking off and the picture he was using was of himself and Natasha in their bathing suits at the beach.
The whole group erupted into laughter just at the sheer timing of everyone’s statements.  Tony came up behind the back of Steve’s chair and leaned down to kiss his cheek.  “The state bird of New York is the Eastern bluebird.” He offered.  Everyone gave him their attention, the humor seemed to die off.  “However,” added Tony, “I always say it’s the German cockroach.”
Steve and Tony ended up in a private room at the Hospital waiting for hours for an x-ray, wound clean up, and lots of pain medication.  Steve’s black eye was looked over just to be safe.  When they were released, Tony was in an arm sling and blue nurse scrubs.  It was dark out.  They had to make a few calls, got a car, and had Pepper book a room at the 5 star Langham hotel.
“Taking advantage of me?  I was drinking and all over the place.  I get a little affectionate when I’m drinking.”
“About 1.” snickered Steve, “I woke up at noon and ran to the market for some groceries.  I thought I could cook for you since you did last night.”  He turned to face the stove to pay attention to the bacon and hash browns he was grilling.
"Oh, desperate for it, huh?" Whispered Tony into his lover's ear.  The blonde man moaned in response as his boyfriend’s hand slipped down to check his own growing cock. Tony snickered, "You want it bad, baby?"
“I know.” Steve said, not breaking his stare at Bucky, “He’s the best man I know, he didn’t deserve how he was treated.”  He realized he wasn’t telling her the whole story and fought with himself about revealing that much information to her.
Bucky arrived at home and saw Steve was sitting on the balcony, covered in a blanket and sitting on the outdoor couch.
When Steve arrived at his building, he went inside and ran up the stairs to his second floor apartment.
He came back to his new place and was met with Tony handing him a flute of champagne and wearing a bright smile.  “Hey there.” Tony said before kissing him.
“Okay, so I am a little sadder than I’m used to right now, okay?  I’ll get over it.  I had to go to therapy for it.”
When Bucky cleared his throat, Steve glanced back at him.  He took notice of the fact that he’d never seen Bucky’s beard that long before.   “I’m glad you’re here.” came the blonde man’s voice softly.
Swaying a little, Steve sat Wanda down as she replied, “You’re totally hot.  You look like a long haired bad boy.  That’s totally Natasha’s type.  Are you in the Army too?”  There was a slur in her speech.
“Hey.” Steve answered, avoiding eye contact and messing with the dry food in the closet so his hands had something to do.
Steve smirked at him quietly for a second.  Moving in together would definitely be more feasible than marriage.  “I guess you’re right.  I would like to live a little closer to the base.”
Examining him, Tony tried to figure out what his chances were of getting out of this situation.  Frank’s plan seemed to be to either kill Steve or Tony.  Why else would he be doing this?
“No, it’s not because we’re gay.” sniffed Steve, “They are saying because Tony’s company is in charge of our web security and weapons maintenance, that I technically shouldn’t be with him.  Word got out that we were moving in together so it is serious, and my boss renewed our contract with Tony’s company 3 months ago.”
Steve shrugged and his phone started to vibrate in his pocket.  “Excuse me.” he smiled, pulling it out and seeing his boyfriend was calling.
Bucky glanced back at him and saw in his face that Tony wasn’t annoyed or angry.  There was only sincerity there.  “No, you’re right.  I uh…,” he cleared his throat, “I’ve never been good at this kind of thing.  Usually I just flee.”
As Pepper was getting out of the car, Tony realized he needed to talk to Steve about this and warn him about what he was thinking about doing.  He hoped Steve didn’t get upset with him and alternatively considered telling them to go fuck themselves.
“I’m close.” Steve gasped, cupping his cheek and stroking his hair gently.  “Tony, I’m...don’t stop oh fuck!”  Tony swallowed around him, knowing he adored it.  Steve’s knees almost buckled as he released into his mouth with a groan, his lover coaxing him through it and swallowing him down.  Promptly, Tony was guided up to his feet and kissed deeply, neither of them minding the taste.
The sick feeling in his stomach made himself known as he remembered saying that to Bucky the night before.
“They’re gonna call me by 7 whether I got the job or not.” said Marco into his ear, “I need a distraction for the next 2 hours.”  He emphasized his point by letting his hands wander to Bucky’s ass and squeezing.
As Steve picked up his fork, his boyfriend stopped him.  He gave him a brief kiss, making a loud smooch.
Tony ordered them pasta from room service and they ate in bed on a meal tray while watching an HBO drama series.  They wanted to avoid commercials and the chance of running into stories about them.  After their meal was finished, Steve sat up against the headboard with Tony cuddled up on his left side.
Hearing that made Tony’s eyes roll back in his head.  His breath started to pick up as he let Steve ride him, listening to the beautiful whimpers as he would hit his own prostate.  Tony looked down at his man, his rippling back, his blonde hair, the side of his gorgeous face.  The expression Steve had and the way he was purposely tightening around him was too much.
"No you didn't." Steve told him. The statement wasn't accusatory.  It was more of an observation.  He licked his lips.
“I can see that.”  Steve nodded, pondering how easily Bucky made friends even when they were children.
“You don’t know that you need to do that.” said Tony, “Maybe you should take a little more time to yourself before you jump into something new.  Who knows, they might even say you can keep your job.”
His redness finally started to clear up on his face but his eyes were a little puffy.  He held an icy glass of water up to his face to attempt to not be so obviously upset when he got back to Tony.
Bucky crossed his arms, “That is true...I’d rather listen to the same thumping rhythm all night then Bruno Mars and Maroon 5.  Even worse, those places might have KARAOKE tonight.”
