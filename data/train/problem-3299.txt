“You guys are also always welcome back at the bunker. It was your home as well.” Sam says. Dean nods along jerkily, the shake and pop of pressure building in him around words that won’t form sentences.
The front entryway is cramped, but Castiel stands neatly tucked into the gap between wall hooks and the radiator as Dean and Sam pull their boots on. A distant soundtrack of Jack bumping plates together as he finishes off the dishes. There’s the sharp chirp from Sam's pocket of an incoming call, and he excuses himself back down the hall as he answers.
“What?” Dean whips around, the plate glass storefront giving him an immediate view of Sam, Eileen, and Jack standing next to the cart return.
The parking lot is half full, a menagerie of Priuses and Smart Cars with Castiel’s Ford and the Impala nestled between them like bricks mislaid in mortar. It’s the kind of health foods store that has three gluten free aisles, no Doritos, and motivational quotes painted on the walls of bathroom stalls. Crisp bleach white parking spots, complete with hybrid charge stations like vacant flag poles.
“What about me? What have I earned.” Jack looks at Castiel, the soft creases of his face making their best attempt to firm into something challenging and serious.
The flaked door jamb frames Sam and Dean, a splash of puce coloured apartment hallway backgrounding them, their set brows falling quickly into matching looks of confusion.
The casual scrape of metal across porcelain stops. Dean taps out a nervous sort of rhythm on the table. Castiel says “Well-”, reconsiders, places his own utensils next to his plate, and folds the skin between his eyes into a familiar squint.
Jack is halfway to the Ford already, trailing within arms reach of Castiel. He glances to Dean, but Dean’s preoccupied, a silent exchange of head tilts and firm nods passing between him and Castiel. Sam and Eileen have taken up a similar kind of inferred conversation. Finally the four of them all turn to look at Jack at once, an almost synchronized turn of heads.
Three build-it-yourself garden boxes show up in a Lowe’s truck one day, the delivery driver looking harried as he complains about confusing directions and dirt roads that just end. Castiel nods solemnly as he speaks, and doesn’t take a word of it in. Two days of trying to put them together leaves him with sixteen splinters, a broken thumb, and a permanent ban from any tools in the bunker. He spends the third day after they arrive sorting through seeds and perennials, watching on as Dean shows Jack how to not slam a hammer into your own hand on the very first go. There’s a tension in Dean as he hovers, the grip of his boots twitching in the gravel on every downswing of Jack’s arm, a flipbook pose back and forth as he firmly plants his arms on his hips, then crosses them in front of his chest, before he switches again with idly twitching fingers. Castiel, however, lets a suffusion of the late winter breeze, early smells of unbudded flowers, and the carry of Dean’s “Look. No you’ve got it. Yeah. Just, don’t put your hand there. Careful. Careful!” sink into him.
“Yeah, well, he mixes up really disgusting cocktails and makes you try them,” Dean warns. “And he eats with his mouth open and is a sore loser at monopoly.”
“Cas? Are you alright? What was happening upstairs…Why are you soaking wet?” Cas looks down at himself. He’d forgotten that he was still wet from having climbed into the shower with Dean.
He elbows Dean out of the way and stares their neighbour down. Dean unconsciously takes a step back. This can’t end well. Gabriel is wearing jeans and a candy pink shirt that clashes with his stupidly expensive car. His hair is neatly slicked back and there’s a leather cord around one wrist. He looks a little like a pimp, whereas Mrs Parker is all class in a lemon yellow blouse and neat, black pin skirt.
“I know,” Dean replies, switching the TV off, so conditioned is he to Cas’ ‘meal time is family time.’
“I think we’d better go, Sam,” he says, grinning. “I think our brothers would like us out of here for some alone time.” Cas immediately blushes but Dean has never been so grateful.
“Yeah, Sam, come on. There are a couple of bars I know around here…failing that, there’s alcohol at my house…” Gabriel deliberately raises his voice mischievously as he leads Sam down the garden path, causing Dean to shriek in outrage.
“What’s the problem here?” Dean asks easily, wrapping an arm around Cas’ waist. Cas leans into the support gratefully. Furious females terrify him a bit.
“If that’s not devotion I don’t know what is,” Dean declares and pulls Cas further onto the bed with him and leans against his chest. Cas swings his feet onto the bed and wraps an arm around Dean. The crisp cotton of the angel’s shirt is rubbing into Dean’s cheek and there’s the stiff material of a tie wedged behind his ear but Dean is comfortable, the most comfortable he’s been for the last few days all because Cas is rubbing the back of his neck and warm and firm under Dean’s fingers.
“Move your vehicle,” Mrs Parker says firmly, not even waiting for Gabriel to open his mouth. “I can’t get out of my drive.”
“What the? FUCK, GET OFF HIM!” Dean shrieks loud enough for Mrs Parker next door to immediately appear at the window and Cas to rush out from the kitchen.
“Because I think that you love Cas as much as I love Sam. And that’s something I get,” Dean says quietly. “Plus, it’s good to know you were being a dick for a reason.”
At first he just sees himself. Jimmy’s vessel. No, himself, he corrects himself again. This is his body now. No more Jimmy. One inhabitant only, permanently renting. This is no big deal. He’s seen it before, many times. In the beginning, he never gave it much thought. It was merely a vessel. He tried to keep it clean and heal it when necessary. It required neither sleep nor nourishment so it was fairly easy to maintain. Humans have to spend so much time taking care of their bodies, washing and grooming, satisfying sexual and biological needs; the list goes on and on. He chose it because of the soul inside, the devotion and kindness of James Novak. It was a way to talk to Dean, to walk on Earth. Nothing more.
“Well, not sex. I mean, after sex, sure…” Sam shifts uncomfortably. “But humans, you know…” and then he gives in and uses that word because how else is he going to explain it? “Cuddle.”
So that’s how their new arrangement came about. As long as Cas takes off his shoes and climbs into bed and Dean can sleep with his head pressed comfortably against Cas’ chest, the hunter doesn’t give a shit about what Cas watches anymore.
But the one thing he cannot love about Cas is his cocky, sugar addict dick of a brother who leaves twinkie wrappers shoved down the side of the couch and flirts with Sam.
“Goodbye, Sam. Goodbye, Gabriel. Maybe we should wait a few months before we do this again,” Cas says, so matter-of-factly Dean nearly laughs out loud. Apparently, these things are more stressful than Cas would ever let on.
“Look, if I didn’t approve of you, I wouldn’t torture you so much. Cas loves you and as much as I hate to say it, you’re good for him. But while you may be good enough for him, I don’t want you to ever get complacent or take him for granted. That’s why I do what I do. I’m going to judge you harder than any of Cas’ other boyfriends because I know you can make this last.”
Cas steps forward, back into Dean’s arms, sighing gratefully when Dean’s arms drop to enclose around his waist.
“Anyway, if you could both leave now…you know. For your date,” Dean says a little bit forcefully. He can see by their faces, he’s not fooling anyone. Maybe he does make googly eyes at Castiel. There’s his manhood down the drain.
“But…I am sure Dean would not want to. If he were awake, I mean,” Cas says softly. His eyes are still intense but filled with sadness. Sam remembers when he used to look at Dean like that when his brother wasn’t looking before they were a couple. Apparently angels can suffer from unrequited love too.
But from then on he became more and more aware of this body. Gradually falling, losing his powers, and being submitted to Famine’s effects. As his Grace faded he realised that the inevitable was coming: this body would soon be his. Jimmy was gone. He’d have nowhere to go. He’d be Earthbound, like Anna. Although she had made her choice.
“Yeah.” Sam struggles for the right words. Why isn’t Dean awake for this? It’s an unspoken rule that Dean is the one to explain all of this crap to Cas. Sam maintains that it’s the boyfriend’s duty to illuminate clueless angels and then give a demonstration. Sam is not giving a demonstration.
“I’m sorry,” Cas murmurs contritely. “But recently I noticed other humans and how they want you. I know I have no gender…used to and now this vessel…body is mine and I know you love me…But if I had always been human and we’d met somewhere, would you have found me desirable and taken me to your bed?”
“Tool?” Dean suggests, trying to keep his eyes open. Cas makes a vague sound of agreement before waving their joined hands at the screen.
“You asked me that, like five minutes ago! I’m fine. Too warm actually,” Dean says, lying still when he realised he couldn’t very well shrug off an angel hell bent on checking his temperature.
“Dean! It wasn’t like that!” he hisses back. Dean notices his defensive body language with growing apprehension. Is he sticking up for Gabriel?
“She does not dislike you,” Cas says immediately. “She just…doesn’t see how wonderful you are. You are misunderstood.” Dean puts off returning to the table so he can pull Cas into his arms and lay one on him.
“That’ll be Gabriel then,” Dean mutters wearily. Gabriel’s red convertible is an outrageous colour, very fast and highly impractical. It is parked horrendously, right in front of Mrs Parker’s drive and her – ugh – hybrid.
“Huh?” Cas says eloquently but to be fair, Dean’s other hand has resumed it’s tentative exploration of Castiel’s behind, cupping a cheek and then ghosting down the crack. Cas quivers a little, wishing he’d press further in. Physical confirmation of Dean’s devotion right now would be lovely. Dean traces the curve all the way up to Cas’ hip and then repeats. Cas presses a little more insistently into Dean’s body so that he can feel his hardening dick and get a clue.
“Ok, so you wanna…” But then he is cut off, not by Cas, but by Dean himself. Without waking up, the hunter rolls over in his sleep and scoots over in the bed, throwing an arm around Cas and burying his face in his chest. Even in his sleep, Dean reaches out for Cas.
Cas sighs heavily from his place next to Dean, waiting not too patiently for Dean to get the damn door open. He’s holding four shopping bags and clutching a bag of toilet paper to his chest and almost but not quite scowling. If he weren’t so annoyed with Cas right now Dean might find it adorable.
“Dude, why are you watching Legally Blonde?” Dean complains, trying to untangle himself from the sheets. As always, he’s managed to completely wrap himself up in them which he blames on the childlike belief that monsters will not attack you if you keep all limbs in the bed and under the covers. It’s not like demons are going to go ‘Well, he’s surrounded by an impenetrable force field of cotton, not much I can do here’ and leaves but much like a fear of the dark it’s hard to get rid of.
When Cas reappears upstairs without soup Dean stares blankly at him. “What happened to ‘the internet says soup is crucial’?”
So Cas goes on Daddy-searching trips or follows up on leads or finds hunts for the boys once they wake up which Dean approves of. At least he’s spending his time wisely. Of course, Dean would rather Cas takes off the coat and tie and cuddle in a badly lit motel room but again, he’d French the remains of a back-stabbing, brother-fucking, lying demon bitch before he’d ask Cas to do that. Cas would probably just tilt his head and look confused anyway.
“Well…no,” Dean says, baffled. “But you don’t like me. I’d have thought you’d have been right in there with the threats!”
“That doesn’t make it better, Dean…” Cas stifles a laugh and locks the door as quietly as he can. He should take a shower while the brothers are bickering and the water is hot. He’s sore and more than a little wound up with want, but that will have to wait. He can take care of it himself, as much as Dean would probably like to slip under the hot spray with Castiel.
The knock on the door as Dean is chasing the last crumbs around his plate with his finger is not normal though. Dean pauses with a finger in his mouth and exchanges a look with Cas.
“What does the old broad want me to do about it?” Gabriel can be heard complaining before he’s even set foot on the front porch and Dean stifles a snicker at Mrs Parker’s expression.
“Dean, I do not see the problem,” he insists. The keys slip through Dean’s fingers and he cusses loudly and has to stoop to pick them up. The bag handles are digging into his arm and Mrs Parker is looking more scandalised by the minute. He knows exactly what she thinks of them and the funny thing is that she would probably like Cas on his own. Neat, quiet and polite Castiel who does not yell ‘fuck!’ when he drops things, play Led Zeppelin very loudly while washing the car on a Sunday afternoon or give interfering old biddies the finger when their backs are turned. Who wears a suit and goes to Church and says ‘good morning’ to the neighbours. Yep, Dean’s boy is an honest-to-God upstanding member of society.
“Her friends think it’s an unwise endeavour too. Why is her self esteem based entirely on what that young man thinks?”
“I can’t believe you invited him,” Dean fumes as he attempts to juggle three shopping bags and the door keys. He’s pissed off enough as it is because a child sneezed on him in the check-out line and some ass in a Mercedes nearly clipped his baby in the parking lot. Luckily for the douchebag, he just missed because otherwise Dean wouldn’t be standing here right now with leaking ice-cream dripping on his foot and nosy Mrs Parker from next door peeking through her curtains at the sound of his raised voice. Dean forces a smile and a wave and is silently grateful that he didn’t run over the Mercedes guy, purely because she’d be so damn smug if he ended up in jail. That old bat has been a pain ever since they moved in and is particularly snide to Dean. He doesn’t want to give her the satisfaction.
“But that time I had to, you and Dean made it very clear that I should not discuss those kinds of things…” Cas protests and Sam holds up a hand to interrupt him.
“I’ll make up for this tonight,” Cas promises, still pressing kisses against Dean’s eager mouth. “And I will endeavour to keep him away from Sam.”
“No, but thank you,” Cas has relaxed a little bit, letting the tension slip out of his shoulders. “Go watch TV until our brothers arrive.”
“Woah, Cas. Have a fight with the shower nozzle or something?” he asks, clearly delighted at the water soaking every inch of the angel. Castiel sheds his coat and jacket and firmly rolls up his shirt sleeves, ignoring the fact that the white cotton is soaked through and is clinging to his body very provocatively. This fact does not escape Dean who is eyeing him with some interest. It amazes Cas that very few things can hinder Dean’s sex drive.
He’ll have to see Dean soon. He knows that. Over the years he’s tried to stay away, been forced to stay away, had sabbaticals and retreats time and time again from the Winchesters. From Dean Winchester. But like food scraps circling the drain into a running garbage disposal, he’s bound to get pulled back in.
Dean rolls his shoulders, ignoring the pinprick of strained, tight, pierced, muscle that still twinges when he thinks about it too long, “Alright. I guess I’m not hunting.”
“I know. I couldn’t….” Wind kicks up behind them, a slight shiver working its way through Jack, “I couldn’t leave you there. I know it wasn’t my decision to make.”
Sam wakes up at 5:30 in the morning for his runs, greets Dean in the kitchen at 6:30 for early morning breakfasts of granola and scrambled eggs, respectively. By 8:00, Dean is hunched over some rusted spark plugs of a gutted out Honda at the shop, and Jack will wander into the kitchen, leftover granola and scrambled eggs already plated out for Castiel, Eileen, and him.
Sorry this chapter is a little shorter and not much happens! Plot-like things will happen next chapter (And Claire’s finally gonna show up!), but ultimately this fic is just me meandering through small character interactions I want to see. So.
The hard plastic of the basket bites into Castiel’s hand, he stares at the soft fade of Dean’s neck, into nape, into hair, framed by basmati and arborio. It’s their first time alone since he’s been back. Since the dungeon. And it’s under the cold harsh light of grocery store fluorescence, but neither of them is saying anything about it. Dean hasn’t said anything about it.
Cas winds an arm around Dean’s waist and squeezes slightly. But it’s enough to remind him that he and Gabriel have the most important thing of all in common.
“Yeah, Dean, I’m sure. You gonna be ok with this?” he says quietly, settling his eyes on Dean’s. Dean knows they’re doing what Cas calls the Winchester mind meld but he doesn’t care. He can see all he needs to know in Sam’s eyes. Finally he gives a one shouldered shrug.
“She is planning to go to law school for a…what’s that word you use?” Cas asks, still staring at the screen.
“We are not having sex, Dean,” Cas calls over his shoulder as he makes his way to the bathroom. He can dimly hear Dean cussing at him but he has far bigger problems. The shower dials.
“But Dean, I do not sleep and you are tired. You need the proper amount of REM sleep or you won’t be able to function properly.” Dean almost groans. It’s too late for this. Having a boyfriend who doesn’t sleep sucks.
“Dean, I know Gabriel has his quirks and can sometimes be…an acquired taste but he is my brother and I love him very much. He is the only family I have left.” Dean wilts a little. He hates that Cas has so little family when he has parents and uncles and cousins and all Cas has by way of relatives is some arrogant shorty who swans into town, insults Dean, eats all their food and leaves again. Dean makes sure that Cas is invited to every Winchester function and feels as much a part of the family as Bobby or Jo or Christian. But sometimes it’s not enough. Dean knows that the way Cas lights up when he sees Gabriel is the same as when Dean sees Sam.
“The shower is running,” Cas says pointedly, bending down to help Dean out of bed. He deliberately leaves the disgusting coloured blanket behind, even though Dean shivers without it.
“And he can’t hit on Sam!” Dean continues, gesturing with a bag-laden hand. “At all! It makes Sam uncomfortable and I don’t like it! No one gets to make googly eyes at my baby brother!”
It was a few days ago. They were in a diner, Sam on his laptop, Dean trying to teach Cas the joys of Earth food. But after Famine, Cas is eager to stay away from cheeseburgers or anything so incredibly indulgent, so it was slow-going.
“Hey, I’m sorry,” Dean says remorsefully. “Just relax ok? I’m not gonna die. I just caught the damn flu. Probably from that snot nosed kid. Did his mom never teach him to cover his mouth? I mean, she was sitting right there while he was coughing away and…” he is cut off by a swift kiss to the mouth, firm and insistent but brief. Before he can respond Cas pulls away again, reaching up to brush away a stray droplet of water.
“Good. I believe next on the list is sustenance. The internet says soup is crucial to this kind of ailment.” This jolts Dean out of his military operation shower induced shock enough to say “What? Crucial? Cas, what have you been reading? Soup is not going to help!” But Cas is gone and Sam finds him five minutes later, standing in Bobby’s kitchen, staring at the fridge as if it might tell him something.
“I love Cas. S’all there is to it,” Dean says shortly. She raises an eyebrow at him, as if to say ‘I was only asking’ but says nothing.
“Thanks.” Sam nods and vanishes into the darkness of the bathroom and without turning on the light, stands in the doorway while Castiel kisses Dean’s forehead and closes his eyes.
“I think that if Dean wants something, his being ill will not stop him,” Cas says dryly. “I think pie may be useful as a tool to keep him in bed.”
Because, unlike Dean, he liked long-term, serious relationships. Admittedly he hadn’t really been able to hold one since Jessica, but when you moved around and killed supernatural things for a living it was a little harder. And he did miss Jess but he also missed going to bed together and curling up on the sofa to watch sappy movies together and even tiny little things like when Jessica had made him coffee without him even asking and delivered it to him while he was studying with a sweet kiss.
“Alright,” Dean concedes defeat. “But if he eats all the red lollipops again I’m allowed to spit in his cocktail.” Cas beams, utterly delighted. For some strange reason he always believes that Dean will do the right thing.
“Marriage, dear boy. It’s been what, nearly four years now? Christ, get a move on already.” Gabriel rolls his golden eyes (Dean briefly considers tearing them out.) “Cassie’s a catch! If you don’t get a move on…well.” He lets his voice trail off in a way that implies ‘Cas can do better than you.’ Dean’s stomach involuntarily clenches.
“Cas! Lay off! I can’t cool down with you smothering me!” Dean yelps and then regrets it as hurt floods Cas’ eyes. Dean immediately feels a kick of guilt. Cas is only trying to help and to be honest, Dean likes it a little. It’s been a while since he’s had anyone to fuss over him and worry about him like Cas is now.
“Dean!” Cas says, before turning to the two in front of them. “Come in, both of you.” Cas rather forcibly shoves Dean out of the way of the doorway and gestures Sam and Gabriel through.
He moves downwards. His neck seems to be a place of great interest to Dean. He shows a great deal of attention to it, placing kisses along it and marking Cas with teeth and lips. He has broad shoulders, even though he is fairly slender. Dean still affectionately calls him a ‘skinny little dude’ but as it seems to be said out of love, Cas does not take it as an insult. If anything, Dean appears to be even more impressed when he is capable of taking down a demon, even without his powers.
“Sam’s here. Shouldn’t you see to that ‘crucial sustenance’ or something?” Dean asks reluctantly with a yawn. Cas looks down at the flushed, sleepy hunter in his arms and thinks of the years to come; of a different kind of showering together (one where they’re both naked and more likely to end up dirty than clean) and sleeping, pressed together, in the same bed and feeding soup to a stubborn, ailing Dean.
Once Dean had left to fetch them some dinner and Sam was still stuck at the local library, researching, Castiel stripped off all of his clothes and stood in front of the crappy mirror in their motel room.
“Cock, Cas,” Dean had said, once he’d stopped chortling. “You have a cock now. Say it with me. Cock. C’mon, half the human race has one and now so do you.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean says softly. “You’re still you. Still incredible and clever and brave. Shit, Cas, you believed in me when no one else did. Even Sam chose a demon over me. But you never lose faith or stop trying to take care of me.”
So Cas borrowed Sam’s computer and did some research on how to take care of people when they’re sick. Cas shuts down the computer when he’s finished and ponders for a little bit. He highly doubts that Dean will let him do anything to help and Sam has already had to drag Dean back to bed twice today. But Cas is willing to make tea or fetch medication so he goes to the bedroom that has been designated to Dean for this trip. The room is stuffy and smells a little bit rank, tissues flung all over the nightstand from where Dean has aimed for the bin and, in his sickly state, missed. There are used cups and a sick bowl (“Just in case,” Sam had muttered darkly as he’d placed it by the bed) but no Dean.
“I’ll say.” Gabriel seems to be deliberately taking his time to move the car, and no amount of urging from Cas will make him move any faster. He may be doing as asked, but damn it if he’s not going to make things as difficult as possible.
“And cream!” Dean suddenly remembers, as he makes good on his earlier promise and pulls Castiel into the house by his belt loops.
“My brother is not a complete douche,” Dean mutters, finding the right key again. He doesn’t have to turn around to see that Cas is looking positively murderous.
His eyes – and hands – move down again. Here is another of Dean’s favourite places on his body. He has never seen the appeal of hipbones himself but Dean finds his extraordinarily fascinating. He nibbles and licks along the dips and curves like a cat, until Cas is arching his back and begging for more attention. Dean can spend hours there alone, worshipping those insignificant juts of bone with his mouth. Sometimes Cas will be pushed down onto a mattress and his trousers tugged down just enough for Dean to have sufficient access to them. Maybe it says something for Dean’s sexual prowess, as whenever that happens, it always ends with Cas trying to push his hips up, desperate for something to grind against, for Dean’s luscious mouth to be focused elsewhere. But Dean always takes his time, dragging his tongue back and forth over the pale stretches of his skin, biting down gentle, butterfly kisses over every place he can reach.
It takes another hour of the four of them, drinking coffee and lazily chatting before they start to move. Dean doesn’t even mind Gabriel lounging on the sofa next to Sam, because he’s got Cas practically in his lap, nuzzling his hair when he thinks their brothers aren’t looking.
In the bathroom Cas patiently strips Dean and pushes him gently into the shower. Dean whines and bitches and complains frequently while Cas stands at the door, watching the faint outline of Dean’s body through the curtain. When Dean goes quiet, that is when Cas pulls the curtain back and finds Dean leaning against the wall, looking pale.
“My apologies, Sam,” Cas starts and then adopts a confused look when Sam shushes him. “I do not understand. Why are you making that noise? Where is Dean?” Sam stabs a finger at the bed and Dean’s curled up form and Cas’s face twists in understanding.
“Dunno. I think we bonded over difficult relatives,” Dean says with a shrug. Their neighbour has climbed into her car and is reversing out of her drive and looking at her, Dean is reminded of her and Gabriel glaring daggers at each other. “That or she found someone she dislikes more than me.”
“You cheated,” interjects a dazed looking Gabriel, who’s still staring at his and Sam’s linked hands like it’s an ice statue made out of Gatorade.
“The virus will make you dehydrated. Are you warm enough?” Dean starts to protest as Cas leans over him to press a hand against Dean’s forehead.
It had been a long time coming, Castiel knew that much was true. Ever since the garrison had stormed Hell for Dean Winchester. Maybe things would have been different if any other angel had restored Dean; Ariel or Haniel, maybe. Would they be in his position now, tired and lonely and sad in a dingy motel room in Montana? Or would – like he knew in his heart of hearts – this have always been his fate and Dean Winchester his alone?
Castiel is not surprised. But all he has to do is listen out for the ever-present hum that is Dean’s soul and follow it to the living room where his other half is curled up in an extremely ugly yellow blanket and watching TV.
“Sleep? Kind of necessary, Cas,” Sam replies absently, wondering if he should turn the laptop off now and call it a night himself.
There’s silence for a moment before Gabriel shrugs and says “I think he’s going to give Sam ‘the talk.’”
“That you would tolerate and welcome someone who clearly irritates you into your home because it makes the one you love happy,” she says. “I never managed it.”
Human genitals still seem a little strange to him. Back when he was newly fallen, this was the one part of his body he could not adjust to. Dean had laughed about it a little, no surprise. He usually thought with his genitals after all. Dean was completely unashamed of his body and had no embarrassment about the coarser, ruder functions and words that went along with it.
“Yes, but you learnt the hard way that if you type things like that into Google, you’re going to see a guy bent over a kitchen counter, covered in caramel,” Sam counters.
“Well, I do not care if other people find me attractive,” he says softly, voice hitching as Dean squeezes a little more insistently.
“There’s a monstrosity blocking my drive. I am late for an appointment. I was just asking your…partner here to kindly move it.” Dean notices the way her nostrils flare on the word ‘partner’ and tightens his arm around Cas. He’d move Cas away from such a horrible person if they didn’t love their house so much.
“I’m sure we can work something out,” he says gravely, kissing Dean chastely, a mere hint of what’s to come.
Dean doubts this as Gabriel is pulling faces at them. Mrs Parker has obviously noticed but accepts Castiel’s apology gracefully.
Cas knows from experience, that the waitress was attractive by Earth standards. Not by angel standards or peacock standards but for a human girl, she is very pretty. She also has many traits Dean likes: a full bottom, large bosoms, a red mouth. None of which Cas really has. So he’s started to wonder why Dean finds him attractive.
Gabriel turns to give him this look and suddenly Dean can see how Cas and Gabriel are related. He’s seen that look on Cas many times, and it’s truly frightening. Even on this pint-sized trickster it’s terrifying and it takes all of Dean’s manhood to stare back at him. But finally, Gabriel shrugs one shoulder.
“Alright, that’s enough!” Gabriel booms suddenly. Cas and Dean part and look over to where Gabriel is getting up and stretching.
“Anything I can do to help?” Dean feebly offers, although he knows Cas will never take him up on it. Don’t get him wrong, Dean is pretty capable in the kitchen but Cas can be a bit of a control freak sometimes and feels like he has to do everything himself.
“Dean…” Cas murmurs when they pull apart. “We don’t have time for this.” But that kiss has put Dean in the mood and Cas looks so hot in his green shirt.
Dean pulls out the chair for Cas and doesn’t miss the shy look Cas gives him or how the way his fingers slowly brush down Dean’s arm. They’re good. They’re so, so good.
His eyes are quite nice, he considers, tired and old aside. A lovely shade of blue, surrounded by many eyelashes. He far prefers Dean’s bright green shade but his are pleasant as well.
“God, Cas, of course I want to marry you,” Dean whispers. Cas’ eyes light up but Dean doesn’t see as Cas buries his head into Dean’s shirt and clings there desperately. “I love you so much, and I will, I promise. I guess I thought we’re just so happy as we are, I kind of forgot about it.” He raises a hand to stroke Cas’ wild, dark hair and tightens the other in the fabric of Cas’ shirt, even though it’ll crease horribly.
“A shower? Really?” And then Sam blinks and Cas is dry again, hair perfectly brushed back, shirt sleeves neatly rolled up although the tie was still crooked. Cas has never managed to get the hang of ties.
But that’s the problem, that Castiel is ‘Dean’s boy.’ Mrs Parker had been all sweetness and smiles the day they moved in to Cas, until Dean had arrived home from work, in jeans and covered in oil, looking like sex on legs, coupled with 'guy you did not want to meet in a dark alley.'
It is pretty incredible because Sam was pretty sure that Dean was so screwed up he’s never be able to keep a relationship going for longer than sneaking out of the girl’s room while she’s still asleep, never mind going all dreamy and happy whenever said partner’s name is mentioned. And Dean has a habit of insisting that he doesn’t want what he wants even if what he wants will make him truly happy so that he’s doing something for himself for once is probably the first time it’s happened in Dean’s life. And it does. Dean is happy. Happy like Sam has never seen him. He laughs more and is gentler somehow and lighter. Yes, there’s the apocalypse but Dean isn’t drowning under the weight of it like he had once been.
“You mean to say…sex?” and Sam almost chokes on his tongue. He knows the angel has had sex. Enjoys it, definitely. For Chrissakes, the man is in a relationship with Dean. People around Dean don’t stay virgins for long. But maybe he should have a talk with Cas one of these days and point out that most humans don’t discuss sex that openly. And Dean is the exception that proves the rule.
“I was surprised!” Dean says defensively. Gabriel raises one shoulder and then drops it, in a half shrug.
But it’s there in front of him. Dean had seemed pretty pleased with it (apparently that’s another thing, not all genitals are that attractive and males are fairly preoccupied with the size of them).
“Why not? You’ve always made it quite clear you didn’t think I was good enough for Cas,” Dean says coldly. Because it’s true. Gabriel has many times insinuated that Castiel would be better off with someone else, someone cleaner, more successful, someone with more class.
“Gabriel, enough. Don’t ruin our dinner. Dean, help me with the plates.” Cas’ tone is curt and Dean thinks that he might be hurt by Dean’s hesitation to answer. But he says nothing and quickly gathers the plates and rushes them through to the kitchen. He’s dumping them in the sink when Cas comes through, face oddly blank.
When Cas asks a startled waitress “How you doin’?” Sam almost chokes on his coffee. It would sound bad from anyone but in Cas’ gravely tones it just sounds plain wrong. Dean slaps a hand over his boyfriend’s mouth, smiles at the poor girl and shoos her away. An hour later, his pancakes are soggy and Castiel still does not understand the point of pick up lines and how they differ from regular greetings. Dean stresses the point that you can’t copy lines from sitcoms and then changes his mind and tells Cas to not watch that show anymore. Cas tilts his head and says calmly “It seems to me that they were not really on a break. His actions were immature and selfish and should you ever try that, Dean, there will be repercussions.”
Dean shuffles into the bathroom, his arm just shy of pressing up against Castiel’s, the rough of flannel brushing into the knit of a light brown two-for-one-sale Target sweater. He reaches past Castiel, straightens a toothbrush, rubs his finger through the gathered dust at the back of the sink. “I mean, technically he’s four, physically he’s like maybe twenty-two, and mentally he ranges from three to teen-angst to however the hell old god is. It’s like some sort of shitty riddle.” He catches Castiel’s eyes in the mirror with a quick grin.
Castiel and Dean are debating the relative merits of jelly brands when Dean’s phone starts to chirp at him from his front pocket, a grimacing photo of Sam lighting up the screen. “Can’t I leave you alone for five minutes?” Dean says into the phone.
The leather on the steering wheel of the Impala is cracked. Hairline fractures that start in the crease of the seams and radiate the circumference, rings of a tree reminding Dean of the age of his car. An oppressive sort of silence weighs heavy as they push 80 mph down the freeway, spiderweb thin fissures in a pane of glass pressing down onto the both of them.
One week later they break the lease and move into a bigger place, as Castiel and Jack learn that most human fathers and sons actually prefer to have separate bedrooms, and single room motels are an exception not the norm to sleeping arrangements. Especially when it turns out certain ex-half-angel-gods snore.
It’s 4am and Castiel finds Jack in the library. The quiet hum of air circulates like breath through the room.
Dean matches Castiel and steps back, a pull against their orbit. In recent years Castiel has noticed the way the two of them fall in line with each other, like mirrored dancers or soldiers at war. They’ve learned the unspoken casualties of each other, gotten better at anticipating.
Three weeks later Charlie stumbled across a group of three Rugarus who had bastardized some spells from a coven of local witches so that they could survive off of raw pork. They spent most of their time frequenting local butchers, buying them out of all their scraps and bad cuts of meat. And then a series of vamp nests in Austin, and Dallas that were living off of hospital blood sent out as biohazardous waste. And then a couple of Sirens keeping their heads down in Idaho. Skinwalkers living like the Fitzgerald’s in Kentucky, ghouls keeping only to graveyards across the whole west coast, a den of vegetarian vetala bordering Montana and Alberta. And so on. Something had changed. Most hunters knew by then that the Winchesters boy had stepped into the recently vacated position of Almighty, and assumed that his promises of being ‘hands-off’ hadn’t lasted. And hunters don’t sit around waiting for the matching thud of a pair of shoes.
The front wheel of their cart is screaming out a teeth grinding psalm, it’s rhythm matching to the quake of rocksalt over pavement. “Yes.” Castiel says as he leans the weight back, tries to unbalance the whole thing for a moment of silence.
It was still early days, and there was still the occasional hunter who would rather shoot anything that wasn’t like them, but people were coming around.
They explain it all back to Sam and Dean. The wheat field, the maze seen from above. Balance and cereal.
Sam breaks finally, surges forward with a brief pat on the curve of Jacks elbow. An apology, as he brushes into the room, pulling Castiel into one more I-don’t-know-how-you’re-alive embrace. Dean still doesn’t move. He stands there vacant, an unsteady rise and fall of his chest the only reassurance that he hasn’t managed to die, eyes open and on his feet.
“It’s… With everything that happened with Jack. When he was born. With mom and then… trying to take out Chuck. I just….” The rub of his palm down the side of his face grounds him, just for a second. “Do you think Cas wants to keep Jack away because he knows I’ll fuck him up more.”
family. If you still want… Even if you need time to-” Jack crowds into him before he can finish, face pressed into the solid plane of his collarbone. Dean holds him and pretends not to feel the soft shake of Jack’s shoulders.
“I’m glad to be back. I...” Castiel hesitates. They’re not really alone. Not truly. He can hear the lull of Sam’s phone call just around the corner, knows that every second word from him and Dean is drifting into the other room, filling out a half formed conversation.
for responding at 10pm to my desperate plea for line edits and a full walkthrough on how to use AO3's UI.
Castiel's eyelids open like the shrug of the universe. Weighty, salt crusted, and painful. Jack stands above him, haloed by cloudbursts and sunlight.
They’re in a wheat field, and Castiel can feel the crush of rotted mulch beneath his back. Jack pulls him to his feet, and for a second Castiel feels like he’s been wrenched too far forwards, about to crash face first into the decay he was just sinking into. A hand braces on his shoulder, steadies him. Jack's hand.
The Winchesters unfold into a tentative post-hunting life with more ease than Castiel would have expected.
“What about you? Can I just ignore you into shutting up?” Dean fiddles with the tape deck, cranks the volume up so the strum of Robert Johnson fills the car, overpowering even the rough growl revs of the Impala.
He’s waiting for the shift, for the moment of calamity. Even just for Dean to pat Castiel on the arm in full view of Sam, Jack, Eileen, and whatever last vestiges there are of a god with a “You’re like a brother to me,” and an uncomfortable look on his face. If Dean never wants to mention it again, Castiel will understand, he’ll adapt. Some kind of a sign that the spilling point has been reached would be nice.
Castiel’s resolve to avoid the Winchesters breaks down right after his truck. The Ford had been old before, but now it’s decrepit. It wheezes a trail of something everywhere him and Jack go, dark splotches staining pavement. Just like last time he searches how to fix it, but the manuals online show the broken down anatomy of a machine that is more valves and tubes than Castiel’s twelve years on earth have prepared him for. Once, he might have had a quiet sense of awe at how the human capacity for creation inched closer to the same complexity that god had once breathed into them. Now he’s mostly just frustrated.
And maybe this whole apocalypse thing was making him a little bit cynical but nonetheless Sam likes to believe in love. There were times when he saw old couples sitting together on a bench – just sitting and holding hands – and it reminded him of what they’re trying to save. Little and greying old people who have spent their lives together and young couples who share a milkshake in the booth next to them at diners and that one day he and Dean get that mushy, hand-holding, intense love too.
Dean wisely doesn’t reply that it seemed to him they were actually on a break and just nods obediently.
Cas doesn’t know where to look. He doesn’t want to look at the mirror or his body and he can’t bear to look at Dean either and see the emotions flicking through those deep green eyes. His hand by his side clenches and unclenches in frustration and something in the back of his throat hurts, like something is stuck and is grating along the passage. He realises belatedly that he is trying not to cry and that feeling comes from trying to hold it back.
“I suppose it’s a friend of yours that has such rude manners,” she sniffs. Dean isn’t sure what he hates more: her attitude or that she presumes he and Gabriel are friends.
“I know you will not die,” Cas says seriously. “I would know if you are in any true danger. But I have never encountered something like this before.”
Gabriel grins. “My kind of guy. Look, I really do like Sam. I’d like him better if he weren’t related to you, of course…”
“Cuddle,” Castiel says gravely and Sam has to stifle a snicker because an angel just said ‘cuddle.’ Even worse, he said it as if it was the freaking commandments or something.
“This is…not unpleasant,” Cas whispers, looking a little bit awed. Even after all this time he still finds tiny little human actions totally baffling and then it’s like he falls in love with them. Sam smiles. Once again they’re so cute he could just gag…but he really doesn’t mind.
“What?” Cas says in bewilderment. The surprise has banished the tears from his eyes and the pain from his throat. Dean has a little quirk to his mouth and his eyes are anything but judging. Even the hands on Cas’ arms are holding him gently, thumbs stroking back and forth reassuringly.
And when he gets out of the shower ten minutes later, warm and sated, he doesn’t give the mirror a second thought.
“Yes but you’re the only one who Dean would consider…” Cas cuts himself off, looking tense, but Sam gets it. Apparently this jealousy thing is a two-way street. Strange that Dean believes he has no right to be loved when he has two people fighting for exclusive rights for his love and attention, one of them a Goddamn angel.
“Maybe I should Google this,” Castiel frets, sitting at Dean’s side on the edge of the bed. Dean is collapsed back on mountains of pillows, eyes shut and pale as Death. The urge inside of Castiel to just press a hand against Dean and take all of that aching and heat and pain away is almost too much to bear. Dean has been wounded before but now Cas feels helpless. He cannot make this go away. He has to wait. He doesn’t know if he can. After all this is Dean. He raised him from hell, brought him back to his body and Sam. There’s very little he wouldn’t do for Dean.
Sam doesn’t really mind so long as they keep it to a minimum in front of him. Hand-holding is fine. Castiel absent-mindedly stroking the underside of Dean’s wrist while they watch TV is pretty cute. Some kissing is fine. Tongues is not. Neither is Cas turning up without warning and Sam arriving back to the room and catching them yelping and doing some serious naked-scrambling for the covers. He set down some ground rules after that. If Cas is going to appear without even calling first, try and consider innocent Samuels who have only stepped out of the room briefly for more beer and don’t wish to come back to see his brother’s bare ass.
“I’ll go get him,” Cas says and hurriedly excuses himself. Dean lets the green material of Cas’ shirt slip out of his fingers and stares at Mrs Parker.
“Hell yes. And if Sam weren’t due back to the room sometime this evening, I’d prove how sexy I think you are,” Dean promises with a leer. Castiel sighs happily, as Dean’s body contradicts his words and grinds back eagerly against Castiel.
“No, but you were very worried I wouldn’t,” Dean says heartlessly. “I know I’m not Mr mushy, hearts and rainbows moment guy but you can talk to me about this. Ok?”
Cas sighs as the crappy motel shower putters and then finally starts a torrent of water. This is his life now. He has his lover and his friend and a human body all his own. Dean’s right: he shouldn’t worry.
“Ugh,” Dean mutters. “You sure about this, Sammy?” All eyes turn to Sam who looks a little uncomfortable at their scrutiny. But he surprises them all by reaching down and taking Gabriel’s hand.
Cas takes Dean by the arm and briefly considers ‘mojo-ing’ him upstairs but Dean probably won’t appreciate it while he’s feeling so unwell. Such an action might make the sick bowl necessary. So instead he tugs gently and leads the hunter upstairs slowly, pausing when Dean has a coughing fit on the landing.
The first time Dean gets the flu after being raised from the pit, Castiel is at a loss of how to help him.
“You get the pie, I’ll unplug the phones,” Dean says, suddenly very back into the game. Cas does look good in that green shirt. And he’s been really, really good today.
“Well, drinks are a start…” he says, eyes flicking over to Sam again. “And after that…well.” The emphasis on the last word makes Dean throw up a little in his mouth.
“Thank you, Castiel. I appreciate it. Anyway, I must take my leave. I’m afraid I’m running a little late.” Her mouth purses again, just in time for Gabriel to swish up the path and give her the stink-eye. Dean suspects that Gabriel has found his match in this tiny, proper housewife.
“Got dizzy when I tried to wash my hair,” Dean explains with a tired, ‘please don’t panic’ smile. Castiel studies the hunter for a moment, then the shower and then after a moment’s contemplation, climbs into the tub as well.
Cas slides off his lap and with a firm look at Dean, walks out the room followed by a confused looking Sam.
“It was a little more explicit than I care for,” Cas says. “However, it did not seem appropriate that I discuss my relations with Dean to you.”
“I didn’t think you needed it,” he says, unwrapping the sweet and flicking the wrapper away to God knows where. Dean can’t be asked to scold him.
The rest of his facial features seem pleasing also. His hair is a mess but an interesting colour and Dean seems to like it. When they sit together, in diners or bars, Dean will lay an arm on the back of the chair and touch his fingertips to the hair at the base of Castiel’s neck and play with it while he holds a beverage in the other hand. He likes it even more when they are kissing, carding his fingers through it, as if to keep a possessive hold of the former angel.
No, that wasn’t true. He’d made his too. The final straw had come when he’d committed the final act of rebellion: he’d fallen in love with a human.
“Uh, no,” he says awkwardly. “But people tell me that Sam and I don’t much either. Although those two really don’t look alike. Or act alike. Or give any explanation how Cas can be related to…that.” Her coral pink shaded lips quirk up at the corners.
“Yes, you do!” Cas calls. Dean is about to make a smart reply when the curtains next door twitch again and he ducks through the open door and slams it shut.
Even more touchingly, Cas wraps his arms around Dean without needing any instruction and then strokes Dean’s hair with the one hand that he hasn’t entwined with Dean’s long, calloused fingers. He looks more human in that moment than Sam has ever seen him.
“Cas, I’d find you attractive anywhere. You chose a pretty hot dude for your vessel – thanks for that, by the way – and I love you, dumbass. You. I mean, you’re amazing! You were an angel. This incredible, powerful creature who saved me and believed in me.”
Chances of making it out of this dinner alive are slim. Gabriel has already stealthily insulted him three times, if he keeps slurping on his gin and tonic like that Dean is going to scream and he’s fairly certain Sam and Gabe are playing footsie under the table.
“Why, you’re not thinking of leaving me, are you?” Dean cracks open an eye suspiciously. Cas is quick to deny it.
But just as he drops his head and closes his eyes, he’s being spun around and gripped by the shoulders. His head spins from the action, but he suspects that it’s his weak human body reacting to hunger and tiredness from a cramped backseat.
Cas hadn’t noticed, completely delighted to introduce him as ‘my Dean’ while Dean and the old bat had stared each other down in a show of instant dislike. She tolerates Cas but whether it’s some throwback from a more homophobic generation or it’s Dean’s attitude she dislikes, Dean can’t figure out.
“Hey,” Dean says, as he pockets the keys and room card and kicks the door shut. “I got you some baguette type thing and fries, is that o…what are you doing?” Cas flushes a little, despite Dean having seen his nude body many times before. He’s aware that it’s probably strange to strip naked once one’s companions have left and stand in an ugly motel room in front of a mirror.
“I am very sorry. I’ll ask him to move it right away,” Cas soothes, but as he looks back at Dean his eyes are clearly screaming for help. Dean strolls up to take his place at Cas’ side. Mrs Parker’s mouth purses slightly, which is so not fair, as Dean’s dressed nicely for once (Cas makes him when they have guests over.)
But then Dean really has to start questioning what Cas is watching. There’s probably a good reason why angels don’t watch TV in the first place.
“I suspect that Gabriel dislikes you for the exact same reason,” Cas points out gently, nudging Dean aside and swiftly unlocking the door. Dean watches Cas go inside and take the groceries through to the kitchen before answering.
“I gave Dean a shower,” he says calmly but Sam does not look reassured by this. If anything he looks slightly worried.
“No. The chicken will burn and I still haven’t made the starter.” Cas’ tone is firm and reluctantly Dean lets go, after grabbing one last firm kiss. He knows that voice all too well and it means ‘Dean, I love you but back the fuck off.’ You don’t mess with that voice.
“Shit, Cas, I…that’s not what-“ Dean runs his hands through his hair and then steps up to his boyfriend, wrapping both arms around his waist and pulling him in tight.
Lately he’s started to worry. Dean is beautiful, incredibly so. Cas has seen snow-capped mountains and distant stars; he’s flown past comets and walked through Heaven’s many bountiful wonders. And yet, still his lover is the most beautiful sight he’s ever laid eyes on. Dean gets very embarrassed when he tells him so. But Dean still doesn’t think he’s special and Cas knows otherwise so he is sure he’s right about this too.
Castiel is standing there in socks looking a little bit bemused. It occurs to Sam that this is the first time he’s seen Cas like this before. Of course, Dean has seen him in much less clothing but that doesn’t need thinking about. No, this will do and Cas doesn’t sleep anyway.
“Thinking?” Dean purrs, shucking off his jacket onto the nearest bed. “And you have to be naked, why?” Cas shifts back and forth and resists the urge to cover himself. He’s unsure whether to tell Dean what he’s been thinking. Dean is not really one for sharing deep thoughts. Especially not insecurities. Dean may have doubts about many things but his level of attractiveness is not one of them.
“He is my brother,” Cas continues, hitching the toilet paper higher in his arms. “Your brother is coming…”
“I’m sorry, excuse me. I assure you, we are not expecting company.” Cas rises from his chair and leaves the dining room.
So anyway, his life has gotten weirder since his big brother took on an angelic lover but he doesn’t mind it really. Cas is already like a brother to him and this kind of makes him Sam’s brother-in-law (although he would never tell that to either of them.) It just tightens their strange little family a bit.
“So that gives him an excuse to hang off you like a twenty dollar hooker?” Dean hisses. Sam’s eyes sharpen.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel apologises. “But it is very difficult when you are so beautiful inside and out.” As always, this makes Dean flush with embarrassment
“So, Dean,” Gabriel says casually and something about his tone makes all of the hair of the back of Dean’s neck stand on end. Nothing good can come from the glint in Gabriel’s eye like that.
That was a bad suggestion. Really bad. Almost as bad as the time he thought the truck stop waitress with the weird rash was a good idea.
But Cas is old and an angel and to be honest, only just getting used to the idea of other activities in bed. Although those he took to like a virginal duck to water but somehow sleep still eludes him. More than once he has woken Dean up to ask him why Dean deems this a useful way to spend his time but Dean just grumpily kicks him in the thigh – rather pointlessly as kicking Cas is a bit like hitting your foot against an immovable table leg made of concrete - and goes right back to sleep.
“That was weird…” Dean comments, after they’ve dutifully waved back and she vanishes behind the floral patterned fabric again.
“Bro!” Gabe somehow manages to drown Cas in a hug, despite his size. Cas looks delighted to have a hug from his older brother while Sam slides up to Dean.
“Oh. He is asleep,” Cas murmurs and Sam thinks he sounds disappointed. Cas still does not understand the human concept of sleep and therefore thinks it’s a waste of time: to be specific, of time he could spend with Dean but several years of training from the brothers has made him understand that you don’t wake a sleeping human unless it’s life or death. Or in Dean’s case, if sex or pancakes are on offer.
But it’s over a month in now and it’s getting better. They still haven’t told Bobby because, as fond as the old man is of Cas, he’s going to freak when he finds out Dean is sleeping with him. But a few days ago, on their first month anniversary, Dean and Cas went off on a date and Cas was very serious and explained to Dean that he would like to be more open about their relationship. Because very soon they were going to need to go to Bobby’s for some crisis and he had been led to believe that humans did not appreciate having truths kept from them. Dean had agreed, all too readily and then had dragged Cas back to their motel room and engaged in whatever it was that they did that made Cas make that high pitched shriek (seriously, even a room across that hall would be an improvement.)
The hiss of the doors give way to the cloying scent of just ripened produce, and the tinny mumble of a local soft rock station. Sam begins to break right, stopping as everyone trails behind him. “Oh hold on, actually I was thinking we should split up.”
The bite and hold of February is giving way to spring in Kansas, the arid rub of sunlight reflecting off the mirror finishing on the Impala. It’s still too cold for rolled down windows, but Dean is stubborn, shivering through the whip of wind in the car.
“Oh.” Dean’s eyes wander over him. Starting at the tip of his shoulder, passing left to right, up then down. The simile of a blessing to the cross with his line of vision. A holy kind of investigation. He looks at the grey hair again. “Well, I don’t think you’re much older than me or Sammy. We could just say forty-four and call it a day.”
“But we can do more than research. We can…” Jack trails off, trying to condense everything they used to do into a new framework, “Keep people safe.”
Once he’s up, usually after Eileen and Jack have picked through the kitchen and wandered off elsewhere in the bunker, he bypasses the pre-brewed medium dark roast that’s left warming on a back burner. Instead he pulls out the cheap no-name brand instant coffee, and the fancy flaked hot chocolate that he keeps stocked up from the farmers market. They get mixed into his mug, a two-to-one ratio swirled into just about boiled water. Dean thinks it’s disgusting; Sam has tried to entice Castiel with a fancy espresso machine, a french press, and coffee beans more geographically diverse than the entire population of Lebanon. But he prefers the granulated texture of the instant coffee, the sensation of it rubbing up between teeth and tongue.
Castiel pulls his eyelids taut, stares into the whites of his own eyes. He thinks about decomposition, and he thinks about age. “What about Jack.”
. We didn’t pay for that, Jack!” Sam says. Jack brings his hand up to his face and starts to open his mouth. “No, wait. Don’t spit it out!”
A series of notebooks are sprawled in front of Jack, cramped, looped handwriting running off the page. John Winchester’s notebook is immediately recognizable, a spiral bound, leather insulated relic of age-stained paper. It’s nudged up against a small journal Sam had begun to keep post-leviathans, and stacks of motel letterheads that Dean had been informally collecting for nearly 30 years. Little sketches cramped in the margins. There’s other hunters’ notes as well, yellow legal pads and hastily filled-out post it notes. Years of information that Sam has been trying to compile into a database for Bobby and Eilleen. Every last scrap of half-remembered lore from anyone who’d thought to leave it lying around the bunker.
Castiel had held his breath for millenia. The same handful of particles suspended in his lungs from just four days after the beginning of time itself. In a half moulded motel off of the I-5 in 2010 he had taken his first shuddering breath as Dean Winchester clapped him on the back and said “You could blend in a bit better man. People get the heebie jeebies. You know, from the whole unblinking rain man shtick.” Carbon that should have been fossil spilling out. The show of normalcy became a novelty, which became a habit, which twice now has become a necessity. But he is still well acquainted with the feeling of waiting for something that seems like it might never come.
The smooth-shod rumble of pavement gives way to gravel as the Impala nears the bunker. Dean eases his foot from the gas, lets the clack of pebbles grind softer and slower until they’re sat in the middle of the road, car idling into white noise.
The door handle is still loosely gripped in Jack’s hand, forgotten as he tries to keep up with what’s going on, “They don’t know?”
“I’m not mad at you.” Jack says. “I…” He trails off. He’s watching the vanishing point of the horizon, focused on the spot where a spray of clouds lap at the fringe of fields in the distance. Flipping through something in his head, a rolodex that got overfilled and written all over when he was god, trying to catch the right thought.
“I know you and Cas were mostly eating takeout and frozen food, but there’s a lot of vitamins that you’re not getting if you don’t eat enough vegetables. So I thought we could pick some stuff out together.”  The mister is running, a fine spray of water splattering the back of Sam’s hand as he picks through heads of broccoli and cauliflower.
Dinner passes in an unsteady rhythm, a warped funhouse distortion of their few and far between ‘family’ dinners at the bunker. Silences slipping into unfamiliar gaps that used to be filled by a joke from Dean, or a mishandled reference from Castiel. They muddle through, adjusting around the tension of the things they’re not talking about. Jack tells Sam and Dean about the corn snake Castiel got him as a late birthday present, they listen as he describes her sheds and which fake plants in the terrarium are her favourite, and carefully no one mentions the last snake Jack had cared for. Sam, through a slight blush, mentions that Eileen had moved into the bunker just weeks after the averted apocalypse.
“So what, you think we should be setting him up on playdates with the local teens or something?” Their shoulders brush finally, as Dean leans in to jostle Castiel.
Sam pulls back, finally drawing Castiel’s eyes away from Dean, “Did… Did Jack bring you back? What are you guys doing here?” Sam says.
But with lungs still contracted, straining at the bit for a breath of air, he’s starting to think that Dean’s thresholds are limitless and unfathomable.
Castiel opens his mouth, madlibs excuse primed. ‘Thank you for the invitation but since we (verb) the (adjective) (noun) here, and Jack is now involved in (local activity) it would be best for us to stay here.’
“Shut up, it’ll be faster. And I think you’ve had enough influence on Jack’s eating habits.” Sam shoves a list into Dean’s hand, and a spare basket into Castiel’s. “Here.”
“Right. Why don’t you pick out some fruit then? Any fruit you want.” Sam gestures to the fruit displays awkwardly, just narrowly avoiding a quick swat to a pyramid of red delicious apples, “Oranges? Raspberries?” He says, desperation leaking into his voice.
“I guess.” Dean shifts in his seat, looks to the passing cut of canola and corn fields, an exaggerated discomfort once again finding its way up his spine.
Jack waits two more weeks in their new place before he brings it up. Castiel is scraping away at a nonstick pan with a clump of rusted steel wool, he’s pretty sure he’s done something wrong but hasn’t figured out quite what yet.
“Do you think I turned out like dad.” It slips out in the space between passing lanes, the narrowing of the highway boxing Dean in.
Sam glances between the two of them, never quite used to the way they’ll continue a conversation like they’re the only two there, “We were cutting back. One or two a month, nothing that was more than a 5 hour drive away.”
“Dean it was six hours in emergency surgery, where they couldn’t tell me if you were going to ever walk again, let alone come out of a medically induced coma.” Sam bites the words out, bitter and unresolved as he pushes down the image of Dean begging him to let him go as a 911 operator calmly asked for an address.
“Here.” Dean aims a kick at the wheel, and it spins around loosely, a little symphony of rattles as something in the bolt and washer slips loose. Cautiously Castiel lowers it back down to cement, and throws a grateful look to Dean when it rolls on with a barely noticeable squeak.
“Um.” Jack says, the normal ease he feels being the centre of parental attention undercut by something that feels like the sickly film in his mouth, that builds up when he forgets that he has to brush his teeth now. “Yeah, ok.”
“So if there’s no god now... what happened to heaven? Hell?” Sam says, his quickly cooling food preparing for further neglect as he prepares his law school dropout line of questioning.
Castiel holds one of the hairs out. Dean tries to lean in, squints at the pinch of Castiel’s fingers. “What? What am I looking at, Cas?”
She pulls at Jack’s hand, placing the berry right in the centre of his palm. He rolls it back and forth for a second, and then pops it into his mouth with a considered chew.
“This isn’t a speak-when-spoken-to thing kid, I… if you have something you want to say you can just. Say it.” He tries to temper the harsh roll of his tone into something softer, more open. He doesn’t have to be John.
The collage of prairie sandreed, button snake-root, and bull thistle tower in the boxes. Dots of aster and bladderpod at their base rounding out the mishmash of plants. Sam begs Castiel to plant some leek, or carrots. Even just a patch of thyme. But Castiel insists on the mix of grass and flowers native to the area. Insists that the fledgling garden on previously lifeless land doesn’t have to have use beyond a stopping point for bees, and butterflies, and aphids. The delicate hours that Castiel spends tending to the plants is not for anyone, it’s not to prove anything, it’s an extension of himself that he begins to settle into like a first attempt at a deserved human selfishness.
“You and Cas can manage that.” Sam says, jogging away from Castiel and Dean, and towards impending disaster as Jack reaches for a fruit at the bottom of the pile. “And stick to the list Dean!”
“A life without obligation, Jack.” Castiel says. Jack’s eyeline skitters away, catches on the wood grain of overfull shelves. The heavy stare of his father bores into him, but he traces the spines of bestiaries and spell books. “A chance to make choices for yourself. You’ve already done more than anyone ever should have asked of you.”
Two days ago Castiel had returned from ‘grocery shopping’ at a nearby Gas n Sip with nothing but beef jerky, a bear shaped bottle of honey, a 2 litre of coke, and a bunch of bananas that were so dark they might as well have been half composted. He had eaten two. Which according to Sam meant it was finally time that everyone in the bunker learned what the inside of a proper grocery store looked like, despite Dean’s protests that Sam didn’t even really cook. Eileen got lumped in when she tried to argue that
“There was…” Jack trails off. “I wasn’t all knowing. I saw the future unfolding. Like looking at a maze from above. And … I thought I could create balance. When I got Chuck’s power, god's power, it seemed so clear what to do with it. But I think that’s the whole point. That it seems so clear. So I got rid of it.”
“Well I was going to get some curly fries. But I’m starting to think that’s not something they carry here.” Dean motions vaguely at a display filled with starch-free, salt-free chips. “Ok then, what do we got.” He shakes the list out, “Why the fuck does he want brown rice? I’m getting white rice.”
“Sounds like it. And a little pissed to have lost her throne and title. Honestly though it’s great timing. Eileen and Bobby have been talking about how we need someone who can get us an in with some more witches. Between her and Max I think we’ll have a good start.”
There’s a moment where no one breathes. Castiel trapped in the singularity of Dean’s stare. Sam frantically looking from Jack, to Castiel, to Dean, to Castiel, to Jack, like a bobble head knocked off the shelf.
Lights don’t flicker as Castiel steps out from the kitchen, there’s no sparks, and no barn doors to dramatically slam open. But Dean feels the tip of the earth on its axis just as sharply as that first time.
” Eileen’s fingers pry the plastic clamshell open, the tips of her nails staining as she plucks a raspberry out. “
The door is shaking in its frame. Little tremors of dowels and wood glue coming loose under the force of someone knocking. It’s only been a month back in the world, but already Jack is unlearning the reflexive clench of adrenaline that came from living in the bunker, these days he associates someone at the door more with chickpea masala deliveries than monsters and bloodshed. He swings the door open without a second of hesitation, ready to call for Castiel to bring his wallet.
“It sounds like… he was trying to let the universe right itself, I don’t think going around raising people from the dead really lines up with that, even if he made an exception for Cas. As for Rowena…. Well. She always made a point of having insurance policies when she was alive. I doubt being queen of hell changed that.”
“Chuck was… not known for telling the truth. The universe we were living in had been unbalanced for millennia. That power… it was older than Chuck. The all consuming nature of it couldn’t exist in one being, even with someone like Amara as a counterweight. I think it was waiting to be given up.”
The tide of their conversation breaks like waves around the sea stack that is Mary Winchester. They float back to shore a second later.
So he calls a mechanic. Dean had always taken care of the upkeep of the impala, and said “All mechanics are thieves, they’re out there charging you a 500% markup on a serpentine belt, and then installing it with next to no tools in 30 seconds. If I wanted to get fucked that bad I’d ask out Crowley”. The garage he finds online is a little ways out of town, but it’s only got one review that’s not five stars which just reads “Owner told me to fuck off when I asked him to change my windshield fluid.” so it seems like a good bet. The kind of mechanic Dean would approve of. The number dials and Castiel sits perched at the kitchen table, the sharp staccato ring innocently connecting his call.
Dean watches the retreating back of his brother, takes a short huff of a breath and tries to access an emotion without it getting hidden by the facade of rage, “Look I-, I really thought that was gonna be the one that took for good. I didn’t-” He glances to the door, holds eye contact with the chain lock for a moment, before resolving himself back to Castiel with the clap of a hand on his shoulder. Unaware of the reverse tableau they’ve created, opposite hand, to the mirrored shoulder, of the wrong person. “I’m glad you’re back, man. Really.”
There’s a soft tap from the open door frame. “Um…Hello?” The ubereats driver nearly folds under the weight as everyone turns to stare at him. “Delivery for Jack Kline?”
