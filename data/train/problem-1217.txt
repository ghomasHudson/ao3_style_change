“Please get off me.” He almost shouted with urgency.
John’s rugby game was the next day and it was cold and damp, the proper start of winter. Sherlock stood next to Mike and Greg, who were talking amongst themselves, wrapped in his favourite black coat. The Boys, as they called themselves now, had joked that Sherlock over dressed for every occasion, for a rugby match he donned a white shirt and trousers, but Sherlock had smiled and told them that it was the first match of the season, so of course he’d make an effort.
"On my first day you knew those shoes were mine. How?"
sorry this chapter is so short, but the next one is min 5k so please forgive me. take some fluff as an apology
“Alright lad, what can I get you?” The guy at the counter asked. It was a truck like building, the inside just big enough for one employee, two at a push.
Sherlock himself lay on his back in bed, facing the ceiling. To his right lay his sleeping dorm mate, who sighed gently as he slept. How long had he been staring for? 3 hours? Sherlock resisted rolling over to look at John in the dark. He knew there was no chance he was awake, yet there was a niggling of fear that John would see him. How would he explain that?
“Shut up Michael.” There was a pause. “What’s going on between you and John, Sherlock?”
“That’s my song, isn’t it?” John blushed a little at Sherlock’s drunken enthusiasm.
“I don’t understand why. I’ve never done anything to you.” This made Sherlock groan. “Well?”
"Where the hell have you come from?" John asked, placing his cup on his desk as he shut the door.
"What the hell do you mean?"
John chose a spot by the circular window on the second floor. It looked across the grounds. With a sense of calm, John opened his study guide. It was thick and contained comparative analysis for his poems in English. It smelt like new ink. John only needed to read up to page 8 and make notes, but John wanted to get to page 20 to get a head start. It would lead to less pressure in the long run. After about 3 pages, John felt a presence in front of him. They had silently slipped into the chair opposite him. John looked up.
"Alright boys. We'll play 4 matches. As there are 20 of you here and we need 15, I'll pull out one or two each match. If you get pulled, tough tits. Better of next year." John cringed at the abrasive tone of the teacher. 4 matches. That's it.
“Toad in the hole.” John replied softly.
John wasn't a friend. Friend seemed too dull a word. John was interesting in the way nobody else was. He seemed to be a too complex just to be a friend, somehow, and Sherlock was determined to discover why John mattered and why the boy was so diligent in supporting Sherlock. Something had happened in John’s life that had changed him forever and Sherlock was determined to find out what made John Watson so protective.
“God no. I’m not gay or anything. We’re just room mates.” He looked up at Anderson, who seemed internally jovial at this news.
No, he’d reassure himself each time, listening to the voices of his peers muffled through the walls. He liked girls. Sherlock was just quite feminine, that's all, and eccentric. And complicated. And John wanted to work him out. Besides, Sherlock never said he was gay, but then Sherlock said hardly anything at all concerning himself. All John knew about Sherlock’s personal life was that he was rich (obvious) and took pills. That was all.
John would only need to go to a practise once every other week and then twice a week during match months. It seemed pretty low commitment, which made John glad he was only a reserve. He'd done okay in his chemistry exam, but knew that he needed to revise more to improve. He couldn't risk losing the scholarship. He'd been given the school's rugby shirt, which was black and burgundy horizontal stripes. On the back was WATSON in white capitals. He showed it to Sherlock, who thought it looked 'very nice.'
"It's no problem..." She paused, waiting for his name.
“Are you happy?” The boy asked sarcastically but did not wait for a reply before leaving, slamming the door after him. There was a knock of anger on the wall from the dorm next door.
"I was asking you to come and collect a test paper." A test? On the first lesson!
"Thank you John, you don't know how much that compliment means to me." Even through the slurring words, John could hear Sherlock's genuine tone. "In all honesty, even you speaking
“During match season they use the stadium at Jude St. Francis school. It’s weird they’re playing now, I didn’t think October was a good time for rugby.” Mike said, leaning over towards Sherlock and Greg.
“Alright.” John said, pausing, before pouring the tea into the cup. “Is there anything you need?” He asked, trying to indicate that he wanted Anderson to leave. John watch him lean against the countertop, crossing his legs and folding his arms.
"Sure."
“Well I’m having fun too.” Said Mike, who was seemingly on another planet and very much content with it.
“That’s true. What did he say about me?” John cleared his throat, cringing as he did.
Gently, they moved towards Sherlock’s bed, and John lightly pulled Sherlock’s shirt sleeve as an invite to sit opposite him. John had opened his eyes at this point, but Sherlock seemed to still have his eyes half closed.
“Do you know how worried I was. I care, Sherlock.” There was a brief pause as exam papers were passed back to the students. Sherlock turned to face John.
“It’s very…yes.”
At 7 o’clock, Mike knocked for John and they walked across the grounds. Another boy, named Greg, joined them halfway there. He had jet black hair and soft brown eyes. John liked the look of him and, when he spoke, he had a rough tone.
“I was sick over the weekend.” Mr McGowan nodded slowly, noticing how tired John looked.
Idiot. Stupid. John kept his head down as he walked through the crowd. He shouldn't have said anything. Sherlock hadn't said he was straight either, but John wished he would. Then at least he’d know. But what would that change? Sherlock was to John's right, leading them through the crowd as he could see over the tourists heads. They hadn't looked at each other since they left the train and John firmly believed he would never look at him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Friends eh?” Greg teased.
Tea cup in hand, he pushed open the dorm room door before almost having a heart attack. Sherlock saw John's startled face and smiled chaotically, his mouth closed and lips stretched upwards.
"Maybe he is." Greg replied.
“Sherlock’s my friend.” Anderson scoffed at him.
TW: ALLUDING TO EATING DISORDER BEHAVIOUR (sherlock is funny about eating but does not explicitly refuse)
“Is that it?”
"Sherlock! If you wanted to come home, daddy would have come to get you."
“Unlike you, Sherlock, I dress weather appropriately. I’m fine. Besides, we’re nearly at school.” Sherlock went to protest again but was silenced by John nudging him gently. The boy then pulled the knitwear over his head, flexing his arms a little, and nodded.
The next few days were silent. John found he couldn't even look at Sherlock without a twist forming in his stomach. It was anxiety of waiting to apologise, but there was never a right moment. Sherlock would not speak to John in their shared lessons, and in the evenings Sherlock would not return to the dorm. He assumed he was staying at home and walking to school. Then again, there were days when he didn't see Sherlock at all. There was something else to the knot too. When John looked at Sherlock, he felt physically sick with words he wish he could say. But even John was not sure what they were.
“Sorry?”
“As in your brother, Mycroft?”
"Nice to meet you John. Your shoes are by the door." There was a beat.
“This,” Sherlock gestured with his free hand. “The air. The countryside. Being outside. It makes you feel alive.” John smiled to himself, drunk Sherlock’s wholesome ramble from Brighton coming back to him.
Upstairs, Sherlock Holmes was lying flat on his back, staring at the ceiling with his fingers steepled under his chin. John didn't know whether to say anything, so closed the door gently and padded cautiously across the room to read up on his chemistry book. The exam had reminded him of how little he remembered. Perhaps the others in his class had tutoring over the summer and were already ahead of him? This was a sobering thought. As he sat down, the bed groaned, which made Sherlock's eyes flick to John. Again, Sherlock said nothing, and John watched him sit up over his book.
“Well it paid off.” Mike replied and they all nodded.
“Well, don’t get in unmarked cars.” Sherlock remarked, tapping ash into a nearby glass. John sighed. “What did you expect?” Before John could argue, Sherlock cut him off again. “John I’m joking. I’ll speak to Mycroft next time I see him.” John flashed him a disgruntled look. “I’m being serious, I will. What did he say to you?” John lay back on his pillow, shaking his head, watching Sherlock breathe in the cigarette.
“They are.” John wasn’t sure where this conversation was going, but decided to engage anyway. Late Stage Drunk Sherlock was his favourite.
"No. It's nothing." Sherlock let out an exasperated sigh.
“Love what?”
“Do you have any siblings, John?” Sherlock asked as they turned the corner onto the road of the hostel. John nodded.
“You might want to sort that out.” Anderson’s eyes on his arms. Sherlock dared not look down.
“I can go grab us some drinks?” Mike offered and all the boys agreed. Mike wasn’t legally allowed to buy, he was 17 at most, but the old man at the bar seemed to care little about this. Money was money after all.
"Here's something." Sherlock called to John, who was unconsciously staring out to sea, perhaps wanting to drown himself in it. "John!" He turned around and walked over to Sherlock, who was standing by a lump of aged grey stone. They were on some grassy knoll overlooking the impressively blue sea. Their teacher had told them to be at the hostel by 9 pm so until then they had free reign to do as they please. They needed to collect data and were told they could ‘look around the shopping outlet’ as long as they could carry things they bought themselves.
It seemed as though the alcohol had hit Sherlock a lot harder than it had John. After he started on the glass bottle of gin, he was giggling and now, echo falls bottle in hand, Sherlock was stumbling as he went. Still, John supported the idea of watching the sunset on the pier. Drinking booze and watching the sunset seemed to be the most attainable thing on his bucket list, so John was going to take the opportunity when he saw it.
There was seemingly no one downstairs, which put Sherlock slightly at ease. He didn’t exactly dislike his peers, other than Anderson, but they all lacked intelligence in such a way that made everyday conversation exhausting. Sherlock didn’t have time to waste on pleasantries, which made his friendship with John so much easier. John seemed to also believe that small talk was pointless, which meant Sherlock could sit in his much-needed silence for however long he needed without being disturbed. He filled the kettle, the water splashing against the sleeves of his dressing gown so he rolled up his sleeves and put the kettle on its base to boil. Whilst he waited, Sherlock paced back and forth, the dry sound of his slippers against the wood releasing some of the tension in his head.
“Like?”
“It’s very…yes.”
“We’re going to The Swan later, are you coming?” Greg asked over breakfast one Friday. John shook his head as he cut into the bacon on his plate. He was surprisingly tired this morning and put it down to stress.
John played rugby at his old school. It was a key part of the curriculum. Boys played rugby in the mud whilst the girls played netball or badminton. He wasn't bad either. He was on the team for 3 years, and rugby captain of the B squad for 1. But this was a good school, John realised, there was no way that he'd get on the team. Maybe he would try? He decided he would see how he felt in the morning.
“I can’t do that. I can’t make someone like you.”
Tonight, Sherlock had started playing earlier. It was a Friday, so many of their peers wouldn’t be in bed until the early hours. For Sherlock, this meant inside violin playing. Although it was barely 9 o’clock, he was already playing a particularly sorrowful melody. He would stop occasionally and replay the phrase he had just played, before continuing. John realised it was because he was writing the music as he went, which made John’s head spin. He could only dream of being that talented. He couldn’t help but imagine what was going in his head, trying to piece together the meaning of the music somewhere into real life.
John resisted doing this under everyday circumstance. Sherlock’s eyes made John’s stomach flip. They were beautiful, somewhere between green and blue, and they made John wish he could paint. John thought they were the most attractive part of him and decided, in that moment, Sherlock’s eyes were possibly John’s favourite colour in the world.
"Yes, I'm fine. I was just zoning out." Sherlock nodded unconvinced and looked back to the window. After a moment, John opened his mouth to speak.
- alluding -> elements of content that can be inferred to be triggering.
“He’s not like you.” He replied and Sherlock nodded in a way that made John feel as though he may have hurt his feelings. “You’re more interesting.” And Sherlock let out a single laugh.
"You don't have to baby me John." Sherlock replied. John opened his mouth to speak, but decided against it. Now was not the time to cause another argument.
- alluding -> elements of content that can be inferred to be triggering.
He was glad to have met Mike. Although he could remember much of him, it meant that it he now had a guaranteed friend group. He hoped that they weren’t all posh twats. At least Mike seemed nice enough and, if his friends were similar, John felt as though this year wouldn’t be that bad after all. As he unpacked, the hubbub from downstairs grew as more students were arriving. They sounded excited, greeting each other eagerly after the summer break. John remained upstairs, however, not wanting to introduce himself to a large group of people.
"Yes, thank you John." John got up and took the bottle and pills off Sherlock, replacing them both at his nightstand. Before he left, Sherlock called John's name.
"Nice to meet you too." The voice replied cheerfully, smirking, before stepping into the light.
if you care - i got into my first choice university to study english! yay go me.
"This is my family's land. It goes back generations."
John’s rugby game was the next day. It was cold and damp, the proper start of winter. Sherlock stood next to Mike and Greg, who were talking amongst themselves, wrapped in his favourite black coat. The Boys, as they called themselves now, had joked that Sherlock over dressed for every occasion, for a rugby match he donned a white shirt and trousers, but Sherlock had smiled and told them that it was the first match of the season, so of course he’d make an effort. In reality, he liked the routine of the outfits. He knew he was attractive, and he looked most attractive in suits. Anything else felt dirty, or wrong, as if he were a rat wearing human clothes. Moreover, the texture of the shirt against his skin was the only one that didn’t make him feel as though he were about to scream, so it was a win-win situation.
Today John was preoccupied with him. With Sherlock. It was becoming routine at this point. When idle, John’s mind would flicker to Sherlock. He hadn’t seen him all week, and he was barely around the last Saturday. The boy simply entered to pick up a small back from under his bed, nodding briefly at John, before leaving. (That action had confused John greatly – why look to him at all if he were ignored the rest of the time?) John didn’t ask Sherlock questions, he given very quickly after Sherlock would either ignore them, or reply in the most brief way possible. Instead, he settled on accepting the fact that maybe their friendship had been ruined by what had happened that night in October. Maybe whatever they had was lost. It frustrated John to the point of angry tears which caused him to smother his face with his pillow so no one would hear him. He deemed it ridiculous, it was just some boy drama after all, but there was something else about it that set John on edge. Sherlock’s sudden behaviour change was more than just down to their more-than-kiss, it was something else. However, in a move to try and settle his otherwise anxious mind, John reassured himself that he only felt this way because he cared for Sherlock. Arguably, too much. John found himself sketching spidery lines of flowers with his biro pen as he thought, glancing up the the front of the class every so often to at least look as though he were paying attention.
Sherlock Holmes was a good liar, John discovered. He watched his friend lean over the counter of an off license. He was resting his elbows on the counter, his chin balanced on one hand with the other gesturing in the air. The fluorescent tube light reflected white off his hair and John couldn't help but smile. He already felt drunk from anticipation and watching Sherlock flirt effortlessly with the woman behind the till made him giggle.
John had made it onto the rugby team as a reserve, which was better than nothing at all. The PE teacher had come to find John himself and put his hand on his shoulder.
“John. I’m sorry.” Sherlock exclaimed. John smiled, suddenly sober.
“Why me?” Anderson dramatically asked. It was clear he hadn’t been invited and was just sat with them, he was trying too hard to fit in.
"Come along John." Sherlock called, irritated, and John followed.
"And that's how I know that David Cameron in year 11 is actually from Cameroon. Very interesting when you think about it." Sherlock sat down heavily, his legs handing over the edge of the pier, facing towards the sunset. It was surprisingly quiet. John guessed people were taking photos of the impressive sunset from the beach.
"Would you like some tea, Sherlock?" John asked, his voice wavering. It took a moment for Sherlock to snap back to reality.
“Well, I hope you feel better.” James replied, shifting to the right to let John move passed him.
“Well, we’re your mates.” Greg said. “We want you to be happy y’know.”
“I’m not.” Sherlock flicked his eyebrow in disbelief. “I’m not. Not really. Just.” He paused. “Just mentioned what I already know.” John emphasised the I, hoping that it was explicit to Sherlock without him having to say anything. Sherlock smirked a little, stubbing out his fag on a coaster.
On Wednesday, John had rugby training for a match the following week. It was lightly drizzling, which annoyed John as the rain had a habit of getting in his eyes and flattening his hair against his head in such a way that made it impossible to see. He’d rather a heavy rain that shitty drizzle. At least the ground would be soft to fall on John reminded himself, flexing the hand he scuffed all those months ago. The first time Sherlock properly spoke to him.
“No. That’s why I was asking” He replied as John opened the fridge to get the milk.
“Your brother kidnapped me?”
The building was incredible, its walls high and brown bricked, crumbing and chiselled with age. Purple and white flowers climbed around the walls, stretching around the white framed windows and towards the roof. As the car pulled around the corner, John saw the front of the school, the way it curved. Below its doors were two sets of sweeping stairs, polished and white. It seemed inhumanly big and he couldn’t help but wonder how many rooms there were inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just as Sherlock finished, Mrs Holmes appeared. She placed the tray that she was carrying on the side table next to the sofa, before beckoning John over with her hand. John sat next to her and gave her his hands. As she gently wiped the mud out of them he winced, but he was more interested in Sherlock.
“Ridiculous.” He remark. Sherlock shrugged.
"No, I don't think so. Neither is Mike." John smiled to himself again as Greg filled his glass at the fridge.
i had my first few days of uni this week. very exciting.
again i have to express that this fic gets more intense as it goes. so please read with caution.
Often, in the evenings, John would gaze out the shared window in their dorm. It overlooked the countryside and, when the sun set, it would dance red between the trees before winking away. He liked the view, the peace. It allowed him to think. In those moments of serenity, John still could not avoid it. Somehow, it all came back to Sherlock.
i hope youre all well <3
“What is he then? Your fuck buddy? Because you’re spending way too much time together not to be friends.” Anderson added. Silence. John sighed.
“What the fuck? We’re not… Whatever. But Jesus Christ” Mike and Greg looked to each other.
"Well, either way. Very impressive." John cleared his throat as an awkward silence fell across the room. John stared through the windows as Mrs Holmes finished bandaging his hands. John could see the entire village through the window, the view appearing as if from a countryside calendar. He met eyes with Sherlock who raised his eyebrows a little in exasperation.
"Alright John." Greg said in a rough voice. It was clear he was feeling unwell, and the disheveled sight of the man-made John laugh. Greg was still wearing his pyjamas, as well as a pair of worn slippers that slapped dully against the wooden floor.
“Not much choice. She said that she is accepted for the person that she is or life will be difficult. No ifs or buts. Harry is very stubborn.” Sherlock nodded.
"Sherlock, are you okay?" John called, moving towards the door. There came no reply so John knocked twice. Again, Sherlock didn't answer so John pushed open his door.
“Well, you didn’t” Interjected Greg.
im just real sad
“Quite.” Sherlock responded, sitting on the arm chair nearest to the fireplace. John grabbed a pack for himself, the cold burning his finger tips before sitting in the seat across from Sherlock. They were silent for a moment, the embers in the fireplace glowing a gentle orange. John wondered if this was a health and safety risk to have an open fire with a small grate. Nonetheless, it looked very pretty.
“If you’re not a good person, John Watson, then I must be satan.” And this made both of them laugh. John stopped to take off his jumper and handed it to Sherlock. “But you’ll be cold.”
“What you-you mean it’s not his fault. Of course it is.” John responded, irritated at Mike’s defence of Sherlock’s behaviour.
“No Sherlock, it’s fine.” He heard Sherlock slip off his slipper and get into bed. “Some other time?”
“What I mean is that you’re more intelligent. More charismatic. More…”
——————-
"I haven't seen him since this afternoon." John added. He was almost shouting, there were so many loud voices.
“Yeah.” John cleared his throat, pulling his sleeves of his jumper over his hands.
The following week, John had training every night of school. There was a match the following Friday, and it seemed as though John was going to be needed on the field after all after one of the boys had broken their wrist at training the week before. He didn’t particularly mind the training; it was nice to be outside and moving around. John hadn’t played proper rugby in years, his technique a little rusty, but he was pleased to feel himself becoming more and more advanced in his movement. However, by night 3 of the training, John’s entire body was aching and sore. Twice, he missed dinner after napping too long whilst revising after training. It seemed that John was in a comatose state, about to pass out at any moment.
"Bloody hell John, they only give out 100% scholarships once in a blue moon. You must be smart." John cleared his throat.
The next page was filled about the information for scholarship students. After reading the page, a hard lump formed in John’s throat. It wasn’t information he didn’t already know, but seeing it formally, in writing made him feel worse. ‘Failure to maintain the grades you entered the school in will lead to the scholarship being revoked.’ For John, a revoked scholarship would mean that he’d have to leave the school. He didn’t have the money to pay £8,000 a term just for school. ‘Scholarships can also be revoked due to poor behaviour e.g. More than one detention per term, consistent underachievement and teacher referral.’ John had never got detentions at Raglesfield High, his old school, so he didn’t think that would be an issue. ‘As a school, we understand that students can have bad exams. However, if a students’ class work and exam results reflect a lack of care or intelligence, then the opportunity to carry on this programme will be removed.’
im sorry for not updating. writers block+burn out+university= not the best time to write a fanfic. apparently i wrote this chapter in january and never posted it???? whats wrong with me.
"You alright, Sherlock?" John asked as Sherlock tied his laces.
im sorry. i will return. 37K words is too many to give up on and i want to see this to the end.
"Yes- but they'll charge you £5 for it." John didn't have £5. Sherlock knew that. Sherlock was being nice.
“But how can he? Sherlock hates him?” John asked and Mike shrugged.
"Thank you." He replied, a little bemused. "Usually people say fuck off."
“Today was fun” John said to Sherlock after a while. There was some student chatter, but it was otherwise quiet. After a moment, John heard Sherlock breathe in deeply.
"Here we are." Sherlock put his key in the lock to a gate similar to Bullimore's, only this one was iron and black. It was submerged within a bush, the gate marking a dead end to the track. John assumed that this wasn’t a main entrance, that there was one with large, fancy gates and a buzzer. And he was right.
“Oh really?” John flicked his eyebrow and felt Greg sigh next to him.
"So, do you have any other friends?"
“Literally just fuck off. Do you not think Sherlock has enough going on?” The words soured his mouth. “What is the point in this? You threaten Sherlock and I, which, by the way, we are just friends. You use Sherlock’s…stuff as a way to try and cause problems between us? Is it desperation or simple stupidity?” John was so angry his hands were shaking. Phillip shook his head, laughing in disbelief. “Well?” And Anderson didn’t answer so John took that as an indicator for his exist, his vision still hot.
“Whatever Mike. I’ll say what I want. If he doesn’t like it, tough fucking shit.” John heard Greg hum in agreement and, now confident with Greg’s support and the contribution of booze in his system, John bound up the stairs  and (more wobbled) to his door.
“You okay?” A voice said behind him. John looked over his shoulder. It was James from English. John didn’t exactly dislike him, but there was something about James that put him on edge.
"Do you think I have any other friends?" Sherlock replied. There was no bitterness in his tone. "I don't have friends. I have more enemies than friends."
This time, John walked with Sherlock and Greg and Mike walked together. They were behind him and Greg seemed to be having a hard time getting Mike to talk sense. Although it was unlikely, there was a chance that a teacher would ask where they had been and Mike seemed to be the one most likely to expose them for their drunken escapades. It seemed as though the school’s rampant alcohol problem was to be kept on grounds and nowhere else. Occasionally, John would hear Greg interject ‘you can’t say that Mike, they’ll know.’ in a tired voice. Although John knew he ought to be helping, Greg’s concerned seemed pointless, there was no way of hiding Mike’s drunkenness.
“I don’t know, attraction to the mystery of Sherlock Holmes.”
"Because without food you won’t have the energy to process properly." John replied automatically. Sherlock looked at him inquisitively. "Please don't read into that." Sherlock nodded, but John knew it was too late.
“Anderson. I burnt it on the tea.” Sherlock replied, loosely gesturing to John’s mug which he was holding.
i will update with what i have, up to the chapters ive got. these will be staggered. but after the last chapter i will remind yall that this is paused.
Dealing with others emotions, of course, was completely different. Sherlock cared little for how anyone else felt, other than if it directly affected him in getting what he wanted. John, however, was an exception to this rule, and every other one, it seemed. John’s emotions seemed to physically impact Sherlock. Somehow, John’s feelings towards him; from his tone of voice to the words his chose to use had a huge effect on him. It was rather distressing, having some form of reliance on John’s external positivity to bring Sherlock himself some emotional stability. This had never happened before and now that John was upset, Sherlock felt knotted, unsure of what to do. John was complicated, Sherlock knew there were more emotional layers to him, hence the use of the ‘external positivity’ that Sherlock had given him. There was a constant layer of anxiety underneath is positive base line which stemmed from somewhere. Sherlock wanted to know what that was.
"I don't really know." He said and John laughed. They looked up, finding themselves in stitches of laughter the more they looked at the rock. John was holding his sides by the time Sherlock had stopped wheezing beside him. Neither of them were entirely sure what was funny, but that was seemingly what made them laugh more.
“Can you help me get your jumper off?” John smirked a little, he had almost forgotten.
“Shut up Mike, you’re no saint. There’s nothing wrong with it John, you can tell us.” It was tempting to tell them, but John backtracked.
- references to -> referencing behaviours within character dialogue that could be triggering
“Jesus Sherlock, what’s wrong with you.” He looked to the paper in Sherlock’s hands, catching sight of the ‘D’ written just below the title. Sherlock had clearly seen John look towards the paper as, when John looked back up, he was glaring at him.
They walked in silence for a while. John imagined what it would be like to have all these riches. An entire woodland to play in, acres of fields and all the money in the world. His little flat on the east side of a tower block didn't compare. The closest thing to wildlife John experience were chavs on a Saturday night.
After English, John had a study period. Instead of going to the library, he decided to settle into the desk in his dorm room. He was too unsettled to actually do any work, and so spent the 2 hour period flicking between swinging on his chair and opening his text book to different pages. What made it worse was that he knew he had to study. He had to get this chapter of Chemistry done if he wanted to be anywhere near passing but he couldn’t do it. None of the words made sense, and it made him feel more knotted to try and force himself to work. John was unsure of why there was this sudden knot in his brain that refused to budge and, although he knew it was due to Sherlock, he consciously put it down to a lack of sleep (which was also being caused by Sherlock.) Both Mike and Greg were in lesson so there was no hope in trying to work with them, so John decided to take a break after writing the word ‘polarity’ at the top of his page and make himself some tea.
“I don’t really understand what is going on, I won’t lie to you.” He heard Greg laugh. “But as long as John’s team wins.”
"Well, people they like, people they don't like. Boyfriends, girlfriends." Sherlock shrugged.
“New buildings.”
The walk back to school was mostly silent. Sherlock stared into the distance as they walked, his face showing little emotion. If John were to guess, he would say that Sherlock was upset. John wondered if it was because of Sherlock’s mother, the pill box or the collapse of one of his shelves that had put him in such a sour mood but either way, Sherlock was not happy.
"Alone is what I have."
Sherlock must have come in at an early hour, because when John awoke Sherlock was in his bed. Instead of waking him like normal, however, John dressed quickly and left, hardly able to stand being near him out of fear of crying for no particular reason. As if Sherlock’s very existence made him feel knotted.
"Sorry, I didn't want you to miss breakfast."
“Friendly! Friendly! I was told to get into an unmarked, black car, wasn’t told where I was being taken and then was told to sit in a room by myself until your…your brother spoke to me about my personal life!” John exclaimed, gesturing wildly with his hands outstretched. All the while, Sherlock took a drag, shaking his head and giggling at John’s dramatisation.
“What are you doing?”
John rolled onto his side, his back towards Sherlock’s bed. He heard Sherlock come back inside, drinking water from a cup he got from the kitchen.
oo they're in brighton babyyyyyyy
“I don’t owe you any form of explanation, Phillip.” Sherlock spat pouring milk into the mug. Anderson laughed emptily, shaking his head at Sherlock. “Leave me alone, Anderson.” Suddenly, Anderson got up and stood in front of the doorway. Sherlock had already began walking towards the doorway and had to stop quickly, the tea sloshing over the cup edge and burning his right arm. Both he and Anderson glancing down.
He had scuffed the palms of his hands on the hard pack earth and found himself picking at the skin that was burned off. It stung slightly, but the rolls of white skin annoyed him and John couldn’t help pulling off the soft skin. After his shower, he hunted through his cupboard for plasters or something to cover the burns. He only had a few plasters that were made for grazed knees so just as he managed to get the plaster to stick, it would come undone and he would have to try again. It was an irritating process of using a combination of his chin and the fingers on the plastered hand to try and sort it out.  Just as the plaster had stuck down, his hand had started to bleed and it had become unstuck again.
"When did you get back?" He asked, suddenly feeling very awake.
“Squat down a bit.”
"Wait, John. Before you go, can I give you some advice?" John turned back to Philip before nodding.
But he hadn’t. John debated it with himself and, no matter which way he looked at it, Sherlock was in the wrong. Sherlock knee John was worried about him, and it seemed as though the boy wanted to see how far he could bend John before he broke. He was behaving differently, somehow, and the cold and flippant exterior of Sherlock’s behaviour put John on edge. For the remaining time together, they said nothing, Sherlock was writing feverishly almost as if his hand was itching for some kind of activity. John, on the other hand, could not concentrate, his brain swollen with aggravation.
She had a pink zip up jacket and nylon leggings, with black and pink running shoes. Her hair was pulled back into a blonde ponytail, which bounced as she ran.
“N-nothing.” Hiccup. He suddenly felt upset. “Just that Sherlock keeps leaving without telling me. And I wor-worry about him”
"I don't mind." John replied and for once did not feel a burn of regret. Sherlock looked up at him, taking a long inhale from his cig. He watched him blow out the smoke.
hi all,
"8:30." Replied Greg, downing the glass and walking away, waving backwards as he did.

"Alright Greg? You're looking a bit rough." John smiled, thoughts about Sherlock quickly forgotten.
"Be careful with Sherlock. You don't know him like I do. He's dangerous. Don't get too close." John paused before answering.
The silence didn't upset John exactly. It wasn't an angry silence. It just made him feel uncomfortable. Had he done something to upset him? No, of course not. He was just difficult, like Greg said. Somehow, that made John feel worse though. Perhaps it was because of the pill box. Then again, it was not his fault. Moreover, John could plead ignorance if Sherlock asked him if he knew what they were. He still felt bad though, but it had been an accident. John just desperately wanted to get through to Sherlock but every attempt seemed to fail.
"Sorry, what am I looking at?" John asked flippantly, he wasn't in the mood for looking at rock. Sherlock paused, slightly taken aback by John’s sour attitude.
"I don't have friends, John." Was all Sherlock replied.
“What about?” The black haired boy enquired and John paused.
"Jumpers and tea? Jesus you couldn't get more British if you tried." They dropped the case at the side gate. "Maybe you should try something different."
John hesitated, before walking towards the desk at the front. He could see a woman behind the desk, arched over her paperwork. He assumed it was the person he spoke to outside. She looked up when she heard John approach, her face first confused before flattening to a smile.
“Yes, I can’t eat and drink alcohol at the same time. Messes with my stomach.”
"My family's estate is not too far from here, so I go home sometimes to see Redbeard." John shifted. Estate. Sherlock didn't mean a housing estate either.
The night progressed and the conversation was taken up mostly by Mike. The more he drunk, the more confused he seemed to be, until for a solid 20-minute period he was rambling on and on about his brand of shoes. John wasn’t sure why or how Mike got onto this topic as he had started by talking about his favourite flower, but it was entertaining enough. The others were in fits of silent laughter, including Sherlock, and it even funnier due to the high amounts of alcohol in their systems. Mike was ridiculous. Harmless and kind but gullible and stupid when drunk. John felt sleepy, his brain almost vibrating in his skull as he watched Mike do impressions of the teachers they shared.
"Mycroft is the name of my brother."
For some reason, that thought made John’s stomach turn uncomfortably. The fact he hadn’t seen Sherlock since Friday made him nervous. There was the positive that John knew he had his blade, which was now sitting in the U bend of the shared toilet, although it was likely that Sherlock had many. Somehow, John knew that Sherlock wouldn’t kill himself that way. It was simply a self harm method. Suicide that way seemed very un-Sherlock. John kicked the softening grass with the toe of the boot. Practise was boring. They were trying passing techniques, but currently the coach was practising with a small group, which left John and 3 others alone. They weren’t allowed to move from position, or maybe they were, but John did not want to flaunt this rule. The thought of Sherlock bleeding out onto the expensive wooden floors of his bedroom made John feel sick, closing his eyes hoping the image willwould pass.
“No.” Pause. Of course he had. Once, when he was getting changed, John caught a glimpse at the inner of Sherlock’s left arm. It was white, but sprinkled with whiter, straight, horizontal lines that ran the width of his forearm. To anyone else, the scars would have gone un-noticed as they were almost invisible, but John knew what they looked like. He found himself subconsciously looking towards his friends arms and legs, checking that they weren’t hurting themselves. John didn’t bring it up, and he ignored it again when he noticed several pinker marks a few days later. “Why does it matter to you?” The boy opposite him shrugged, turning to lean his back against the counter-top.
By about 6 o clock, the sun was steadily setting. Any thought of schoolwork was forgotten a long time ago and, even if he had wanted to do it, Sherlock was in no position to even form coherent sentences, let alone write paragraphs of work. For once, John tried to ignore the insect like anxiety in the back of head that told him he was going to fail his class and walked with Sherlock down the beach.
"Good." Sherlock replied and slammed the door.
“No John. See. We’re different. You’re kind and considerate and you give people things even when you have so little yourself. It makes you a good person.” John’s ears burnt. Even though Sherlock was drunk, the sentiment was clearly there.
“Strange, I thought you and Sherlock were close?”
“Then what do you call it?” He cried in disbelief. Sherlock snickered, running his hands through his hair.
Sherlock whipped his head round fast, alertness on his face. John stumbled back, spooked by Sherlock's reaction.
"The shelves fallen off the wall."
"Only about 15 minutes ago. You were smiling when you were asleep." John laughed nervously, running his hand through his bed hair.
"Hello Sherlock." He said.
"Next time you fail to follow my instructions, you will have a detention." The teacher said, deliberately emphasising every word to the entire class. John swallowed thickly and nodded his head. John knew he was being made an example of, but a detention could be detrimental to his scholarship. He could see Sherlock looking at him from his peripheries and as he walked back to his seat the boy raised his eyebrow slightly, almost a sign of solidarity. "Book away Watson." John looked up, startled, before fumbling with his bag to put his text book in it. Why were his hands shaking as he flattened out his test paper in front of him? Sherlock hadn’t seemed to have noticed, and John wasn’t sure why he cared . Breathe, he told himself as he could hear the loud thumping in his ears."You may start the exam."
"I will, thank you."
And yet, he couldn’t help but think back to the night in the field, when they were both hazed with drunkenness and fuelled by something else that they almost slept together. Was that attraction? Sherlock simply concluded that it was some attempt to know him better, understand him somehow. He was certain that he didn’t want to be with John sexually. The alcohol had clouded the memory, making Sherlock feel dumb and slow, yet he was sure that he wasn’t sexually inclined. As far as he was aware, that was left to less intelligent people – Sherlock believed that he didn’t have the space in his brain to be turned on.
"I'll be outside."
After the game, John came out of the sports house, hair wet and arms red from cold and injury. Despite that, he had a large smile on his face, white jumper in hand. His kit had been left with the coach, who was ‘very impressed’ with his performance, and so he wore his day clothes, his jeans rolled and cuffed at his ankles.
At the end of the lesson, John waited outside the door for Sherlock to finish speaking to their teacher. It was a long conversation, longer than John expected, so he leant against the wall, half listening, half not.
“Are you alright?” He asked. It took every cell in John’s body not to start crying.
Whilst he had been asleep, somebody had dropped of his trunk, so John spent his time unpacking. It was mostly jumpers and trousers, although there was one green polo shirt. At the bottom of the case was the uniform. A burgundy blazer, burgundy tie and black trousers. Also, a black cap with the school emblem on it for special events. It was ugly, but would become the staple of his wardrobe for the next year. John put the blazer on over his jumper. It was a little big for him, the edge of the sleeves ending at the palm of his hand. Hopefully, he would grow into it. His previous school hadn't enforced uniform rules so John never wore his blazer. The polyester was abrasive on his skin but the uniform was not optional at the school. John stretched out his arms, maybe the starch would come out with age.
"You either get on with Sherlock, or you don't." Mike added.
John and Sherlock were on speaking terms again, which was as good. But it didn't stop John from feeling a bit sad around Sherlock. He spent all his time around his now verified friend, but it still wasn't enough. He wished he could make Sherlock feel okay somehow without the need of medication. He wished he could do something to make him feel as if he were okay. But he didn't. It was an eerily familiar yearn but John pretended not to feel it. Sherlock was talking more now, a surprising contrast to only days before when the atmosphere was frosty. Even if it was a passing remark, Sherlock seemed to want to be around John, rather than the otherway round, and this made John feel slightly more content with their friendship. Sometimes he would join John for breakfast and would always eat dinner with him. This was another positive change.
When he got into the dorm, John locked himself into his room. Of course, Sherlock was not there. John felt sick, his head oddly light. He sat against the door, the voices downstairs audible through the wood. His breath was hitching in his throat, his stomach unsettled. It was a panic attack. John was familiar. He straightened his back, placing his head against the door, trying to use the wood to ground him some how. It bought him no solace, his breathing becoming more rapid. John was lost, unsure of what to do. All he could hear was his own rapid breathing. He took his blazer sleeve and placed it over his mouth, smothering the noise from his mouth. Come on John. Come on. Come on. But no matter how many times he told himself it was okay, he continued to panic, his head so light he was convinced he was going to pass out.
Sherlock wished he could have the variety that John modelled. He was almost envious of his jumpers and polos and t-shirts. The colours, the textures, he seemed to look nice in everything. Sherlock fancied a jumper of his own, but they didn’t flatter him he way that the shirts did. He watched John stretch on the field and could tell he was nervous. It was his first match day after all. Sherlock didn’t understand why John was involved in such a ridiculous game, but it seemed to bring him some joy, so Sherlock humoured him. It was so un-john like. The small, studious, quiet boy playing rough and tumble, it was almost laughable. Sherlock invested his interest in him for the simple reason that it added dimension to John.
“It’s okay. You don’t need to apologise.” John smiled behind him, closed mouth and quick. When people are nice, it makes things worse.
John watched Sherlock take a long drink before pulling a face of utter disgust and sticking out his tongue.
John wondered what made Sherlock reassess his mind palace so heavily. Had John truly said anything revolutionary? He didn’t understand Sherlock’s sudden, stark reaction to the news he was not a homophobe. Moreover, he didn’t think Harry being a lesbian was such big news, but then again John had grown up with her lesbianism. Perhaps the idea of being a lesbian really was so foreign and unusual? At John’s old school, there had been plenty of open lesbians, although John was sure the only reason they had been accepted because teenage boys have a strange fixation with the thought of their female classmates fucking each other. At an all-boys school, there were no lesbians (obviously, John) and no open gay couples, although that could have been due to school policy. Had Sherlock never experienced real life gay couples? The thought amused John as he lay down to go to sleep. The fact they had kissed less than 5 hours before and now Sherlock was acting as if homosexuality was a complete alien thing. Somehow, this wasn’t a gay thing. John wouldn’t be able to explain why, but he and Sherlock kissing wasn’t gay.
"I did, until you poured the water in." Philip remarked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you for caring." And John knew that really meant 'thank you for being my friend.’
"My roommate? I don't know." Sherlock replied, slightly bewildered. John stood up.
“I owe you nothing.” John shook his head in disbelief, opening his exam paper. There was a ‘B’ written in red in on the front of the paper.
“Still, it’s very impressive.” Sherlock replied, watching John again shout towards the rest of the pitch.
This, of course, was for Sherlock. John wasn't sure whether it was the way she said it, or if Mrs Holmes really was being rude, but Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened them, there was a slightly colder version of the same mask on his face.
As John laced his boots, it occurred to him that all of the other people had been students at this school for years. They knew this teacher. He knew their strengths. He didn't know John's.
“Really, Sherlock?” He asked, looking towards his friend. Sherlock said nothing, as if he were waiting to power on before nodding.
Downstairs was empty apart from a boy who was lounging on a chair by the fireplace, somewhere between wake and sleep. Now and again he would shift, his folded arms twitching as he sighed in his dreams. John laughed quietly to himself, if only he could sleep right now, perhaps it would be a better use of his time. He wandered over to the kettle, filling it up at the sink and boiling it. Even if he tried, John wouldn’t be able to sleep. He was too riled up, his brain anxiously flickering  and, as he turned around to grab a cup from the cupboard, he caught the figure of Anderson out of his peripheries.
The entrance opened immediately into the kitchen and living room. It was open plan, it seemed, with large windows either side that let in the summers light. On his left John could see a few sofas, along with armchairs next to a fireplace. The were made of old leather and draped with a mismatch of blankets that added to the homely feel.  John could see himself reflected in the mirror above the fireplace and, upon seeing his reflection, brushed his hair out of his face in an effort to look for refined. It didn’t work and instead he was left with a Tin-Tin like quiff. On the shelves on the furthest wall of the living room were thick textbooks, as well as a radio. To his right was the kitchen, which had a silver double doored fridge, an aga and a sink, as well as cupboards lining the walls. There were random knick knacks, like a metal statue, stood on the centre of the kitchen table and a vase of flowers on the windowsill. Everything was oddly mismatched but in a way that was charming.
“It’s okay John, you’ve stroked my ego enough.” And for some reason, both boys began to laugh, the smoky air now clear and cold.
John cleared his throat.
“We’re not friends.” John replied, smiling with straight lips and distracting his hands with a paper coaster on the table.
It wasn’t attraction. He was sure of this. His entire life, Sherlock had been taught that homosexuality, in any form, was wrong. In mass, at Sunday School, he was told by the Father that even thinking in a homosexual way was wrong because God could read his thoughts. Of course, Sherlock knew that there was no God, that the religion he was bought up under was more of a cult used to control people rather than a house of an omnipotent being. But even then, small increments of the preachers teachings would somehow infiltrate his brain, poisoning it black with their preaching’s. Even so, it was attraction – John was simply interesting.

He went to argue back when there was a sudden buzzing from the gates as they opened and a stretched black car rolled passed. It parked next to Harry’s, suddenly making John feel poorer than he already was, and a man in a black suit stepped out the car. It felt very much like a kidnapping, but Harry nodded for him to get inside. Before he could though, she gave him a hug, her mouth pressed into his ear.
"Hello John." He said in a cool tone.
"Are you alright, John?" Sherlock asked after 30 seconds. John cleared his throat and looked down.
They trailed back up the hill towards the school. John wasn’t exactly sure where they were going, and he didn’t think the others did either, but he didn’t mind. It was nice to see that they were all getting along, Sherlock laughing every now and again to something Mike or Greg said. It was very out of character for him, but he seemed happy so that was enough for John.
They had found a sea wall,  far from where their class mates would be. It overlooked the rocky beach and the blue ocean that reflected like silver into the sky. John’s short legs swung over the edge, and the drop scared him slightly. Sherlock had handed him a Strongbow, and he nursed it between his hands. The cider was warm, but John didn't mind. Booze was booze and perhaps it being slightly warm made it better.
“What.”
"Hello."
It wasn’t attraction. He was sure of this. His entire life, Sherlock had been taught that homosexuality, in any form, was wrong. In mass, at Sunday School, he was told by the Father that even thinking in a homosexual way was wrong because God could read his thoughts. Of course, Sherlock knew that there was no God, that the religion he was bought up under was more of a cult used to control people rather than a house of an omnipotent being. But even then, small increments of the preachers teachings would somehow infiltrate his brain, poisoning it black with teachers. Even so, it was attraction – John was simply interesting.
“I will.” John paused. “Thank you.”
“There are lots of pride flags.” Sherlock remarked and John nodded. “I saw a club advertising drag queens by the sea front.”
"Well, I guess I'll have to see." John replied, not worried at all.
“Sherlock.” Said a voice from the doorway behind him. Sherlock turned around, putting his hands behind his back.
"What? Yes. Yes I'm fine. I’m just going out." He said, walking towards the door and leaving with no further explanation. John has opened his mouth to speak, but the door had clicked shut just as he did.
"What do you mean?" Sherlock asked, scanning his coursework and glancing back that the stupid rock.
sorry.
“Well I do, Sherlock. At least have enough grace to tell me where you’re going.” Sherlock huffed.
"That's not what I'm saying, you know that."
"Yeah, I'll keep that in mind at my all boy’s school." He retorted, buzzing the glowing button. The introduction guide said that they should buzz in and get a member of staff to carry the case, but having other people do things for him made John feel uneasy. He'd always been independent, and didn't see why that had to change now. He quickly said his name, and was told that someone would be down to collect him, before the intercom cut out.
“Look, Sherlock. This is going to be a difficult year. If you need extensions or help, I’m happy to aid you in anyway. I know the school echo’s that. You’re a smart lad, you deserve to do well.”
The front was glossy and dark blue, with a picture of the school on the front, along with the words 'strength through education. Bullimore Sixth' This phrase made John laugh. What did that mean? The first page had a Welcome From The Head Teacher, along with their photo. John didn't care to read the page, but noticed the phrase "excellence can only be achieved by one’s own determination to succeed." John snorted, it sounded as if the teacher had never seen anywhere else except for the inside of a private school.
"They'll live." Sherlock replied and John shrugged.
“Pardon, Mike.” Sherlock responded, his brain not quite catching up with the information.
“Sherlock was impressed by you.” Mike remarked with a smile, flicking his eyebrow towards Greg. John cleared his throat.
“Yeah…well I don’t want them to.” He kicked a stone, suddenly angry again. “I’m gonna talk to Sherlock ab-about it again.” They fell silent again, the gate coming into view. They waited for Mike to tap his card to the gate for entry, before walking next to each other again.
“The walls can’t talk.” Anderson said, looking to John. “But I can.” John was sure the line was rehearsed in his head. It sounded too rehearsed and delivered too straightly. “Who would the school believe? A long term student, exemplar student just trying to study. Or a couple of bum boys who so
The teacher was a short man who stood with his hands on his hips and his legs spread slightly too far apart. They were standing on the rugby pitch, which was at the base of the hill, shadowed by the woodland.
"Sorry!" John called back, laughing.
It was his mother, of course, so there was little surprise waiting for John in that respect. He wasn’t sure why and, before they entered her wing of the hospital, Harry briefed him on what to expect in a tight voice.
At break John took the time to make himself some tea in the dorm kitchen. He could have gone to the main hall to make it, but lots of people didn't seem like the best idea. He'd almost had a panic attack, something that hadn't happened in a while.
“Don’t be thick, John. It wouldn’t be your fault. Things happen.”
"I'm John Watson. I'm new." She nodded as he cleared his throat, looking down to filter through the papers on her desk. John rolled down his sleeves, suddenly aware that he must appear extremely unprofessional. He wanted to assert himself as belonging as soon as possible.
"Have you been taking your tablets?" John asked simply. The apology could wait, this seemed more important. Sherlock didn’t flinch, he knew exactly what he was talking about.
“Okay.” He replied, watching the sports house come close with every step. There was a sudden pit in his stomach, but he focused on the skyline to force it away. It of course, did not work. The rest of the walk down hill and, as Sherlock was taller than the other boys, he was forced to take smaller steps. It made him feel a little more out of place than normal  but Sherlock pushed that down, sentiment like that made him feel worse.
“Sorry John.” John didn’t turn around, his eyes half closed.
“Greg” Sherlock repeated in a mocking tone. “I’m just having fun.” And he took a sip from his bottle again, his eyes not leaving John. John cleared his throat awkwardly and glanced down.
love to you all
"She's a woman." John responded and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“I’ve got too much chemistry to do.” Mike rolled his eyes from across the table.
"Yes Sir, sorry sir." John got up from his seat and walked over to the front desk, where there was a stack of papers.
Straight ahead of him was a low doorway, which John walked through. It lead to a blue tiled room which had a number of washing machines in, as well as a washing line that ran parallel to the ceiling. It seemed as though they were expected to do their own laundry. To his left was a door which had the number 21 carved into the wood. Behind that door, John assumed, was a corridor of rooms that held dorms. Instead, John followed the room along to another doorway, which was signed ‘upstairs’. This was where John assumed dorm would be, so he walked through the door and up the curving stairs.  He could feel the cold against the holes in his socks, the slats of the wooden planks scruffy and stained, as if unkept. At the top of the stairs was another corridor. There were two doors at opposite ends of the corridor. One read 22 and the other 23. John tried his key for 22, and it came open.
"Do you think that's safe?" John asked. He wasn't partially sober himself, but in a better state than Sherlock. Sherlock turned to look at him.
After John had paid, he brought the yellow polystyrene cartons back to the table, the scent of hot grease and vinegar soaking through the paper wrap. Silently, John slid Sherlock his portion of chips. He sighed dramatically in response, before slowly unpeeling the edge of the paper layer by layer, his long fingers hesitating at every layer. John watched him open it as he busied himself with his own box. There seemed to be pure force that Sherlock was using to be using to even imagine opening the box itself. To ease the mood, John began to hum, folding the greasy paper over in his hands. Sherlock looked up suddenly.
It was an exact circle, the roof shaped like a mound and made of glass, like the min building. The entrance was framed by two large stone pillars, chiselled with flowered, and the door made of heavy wood, the thickness of john’s arm. The interior was huge. It was the same size as the dining hall, every inch lined with shelves. There were two floors to it, a balcony for the second floor that had desks pushed against it, so that people could over-look the library. At centre of the library was a large column of light on the centre. Surrounding that was circular desk where students could check in and out books.
anyway, stay safe and well
“I could do it if you would like me to.” Sherlock replied. John looked up at him, his eyes slightly red with blurry tears.
John looked down at his can, fiddling with the pull ring. They sat in comfortable silence, yet John wanted to say something, anything.
"Fucking hell." John sat bolt upright gripping the covers of his duvet, the welcome pack sliding off his lap and onto the floor. The room was darker than when he had lay down, the sun less intense in the sky, washing the room in a peachy orange glow. There was a figure in the doorway. John bent down to pick up the pack off the floor.
The rest of October was filled with the threat of exams. Sherlock continued as if nothing had even happen, and it made John wonder if he had dreamt the entire thing. Sherlock remained civil, but was slowly distancing himself from John. As everyday passed, he was slowly coming to school less, entering the dorm room less and John realised that perhaps Sherlock needed space. So, he avoided him too, even though it hurt his feelings to think he was the cause of the upset. Sure, John didn’t think that it was going to change much, but at least they could…talk about what happened. At least then they would have some form of level footing. John decided to work through it, Sherlock would talk about it if he wanted to, and the exams were more important than boy drama, even if John wished Sherlock would talk to him. He needed to pass, they were integral for getting into university and keeping his scholarship, even so, the insects still beat at the back of his head.
"Are - are you my roommate?" John enquired. He partly wanted Mike to say no, simply because he couldn't remember anything about the boy and he would have to fill in parts of information when he could. He hadn’t seen him since primary school, so he wasn’t sure how Mike remembered him.
"She seems nice." He said.
Now John was watching Sherlock stare into the distance, his hands still holding the bottle of water.
“It’s time to pick a side, Mr Watson.” And with that he left the room.
"You're not nice to Anderson."
"Why"
"Because I think you'll get your shirt wet. Come on." Sherlock hesitated, glancing down at John's outstretched hand before complying. He dug in his draw and pulled out a black polo top. John took it and folded it into his bag, before shouldering it. "What about your shoes?"
“Sure,” He opened the door wider for John, inviting him in. “Do you want a blanket or something?” Greg was sure John hadn’t slept and now wasn’t the time to ask why he hadn’t. He decided to just be as nonchalant as possible,  it wanting to make anything worse than it may be. He knew it concerned Sherlock; it often did now days.
"The more you drink the better it tastes." Which made Sherlock shake his head.
"What are you doing?" Asked John. He had given up on his mission of fixing his hand and now was awkwardly dabbing his bleeding right hand with the edge of his blue jumper sleeve.
"What can you tell me about that woman over there?" John followed Sherlock's eyes.
Once, in the middle of a maths exam, there was a knock on the door and, when the student was beckoned in, John saw it was Harry. She was in Sixth Form and thus did not have to wear uniform and looked serious and business like in her black dress. Her face was straight set, and she spoke to John’s teacher in a low tone. He could tell from the look on her face something was wrong – she had barely looked him in the eye when a lump formed hard and pressing in his throat. There was an underlying murmur from the class as John was excused from the lesson, shouldering his satchel bag as quickly as he could.
Greg watched them ahead of him, Mike leaning to his right. They were a confusing pair. He couldn’t quite figure out what was going on between them, and it seemed neither could they. Still, it mattered little to him whether they were together or not. Sherlock was a cold, sometimes cruel person and it was strange to see him bond so well with another person. In the five years that Greg had known Sherlock Holmes, he had never seen him have a close relationship with anyone. John Watson, it seemed, had changed that. Although he could be mean at times, Greg truly cared about Sherlock, and knowing he was happy was something that made him smile.
John nodded as Sherlock gestured to their right, where there were fields and fields of green grass and yellow flowers. Sherlock was a proper rich boy, acres and all. "When I was little there was a big tree house in the woods that father built, but it's not there anymore. Mycroft and I used to play pirates in that house."
“She.”
“Did you see Mr McGowan on the history trip?” Mike asked with a laugh. He had drunk at least a bottle and a half of red wine and seemed very invested in this particular portrayal.
Upstairs, he settled himself against the wall next to his bed. It must have been about 2am, the night still underway. He hated it. The night time after. Always. It was the worst. Loneliness and fear. A lack of control. John found himself banging his head against the wall in frustration, but soon stopped out of fear of being heard. Alone, he wrapped his arms around himself, his jumper soft and familiar, and gently cried into the sleeves, the moonlight spilling onto the bed.
“I’m John’s friend and it’d be rude not to.” He saw Greg raise an eyebrow.
Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock. Pretty Sherlock with black curly hair who could play the violin from memory and do history and science. Sherlock who looked good in uniform. Sherlock who smelt of smoke and books and something else. Something so Sherlock than John was sure that he would find it no where else but on him. He wanted to be enveloped in Sherlock's scent, by Sherlock's arms, by Sherlock's body. But not in a weird way. Not in a way that would get him kicked out of the school. In a way that meant he got to be close with him, watch Sherlock smile and listen to laughter swell in his chest in that way that made John giddy. Be comfortable next to him.
“Interesting.”
The faster Sherlock paced, the more anxious he became. The music became erratic, his bow striking the air with agitation. John watched, hoping that Sherlock would run himself out, but the boy was seemingly stuck between 3 notes, each a semitone down from each other. The noise wasn’t awful, but the longer it went on the more it seemed to drill into John’s brain.
“I don’t know what you’re hearing, Anderson, as I said. Sherlock and I are friends. Nothing more than friends.” He gestured with the teaspoon in his hand. “Also, I don’t see how or why this would matter to you.” Anderson shrugged.
That evening, Sherlock and John sat at their respective desks, bent over the text books they had gotten from class. John had not pressed further about Sherlock’s conversation with Mr McGowan. If he wanted to talk to him about it, Sherlock would have done so. Instead they formed friendly conversation about the previous exam (which Sherlock jokingly said was rigged in John’s favour) as well as John’s match the following week. Sherlock seemed to want to watch again which excited John. He didn’t take Sherlock as much as a sports man, in fact John was sure he didn’t even know how the game was played, so he hoped Sherlock wanted to come simply to support him.
“Who can blame him,” Greg remarked, sipping his drink “He’s a fine looking man. Not to be gay.” And both Greg and Mike laughed. John smiled, shifting awkwardly in his seat. It seems as though Anderson and I have more in common than I thought.
im going to try and update as much as i can but im back at work for the first time in months (AHHH) so updates might be a bit slow again!! sorry :( im currently about 5 chapters ahead in writing, so i need to get back on the grind. love to you all <3
John got dressed quietly into a jumper and some trousers before prodding Sherlock. He'd get into his uniform after breakfast.
"No problem, John." She replied.
“Why not?”
“Watson! What are you doing?” Someone shouted, which made John’s face sting. So, when the ball and positions were reset, John ensured to play harder and harder. His face wet with the rain, which was now falling more and more heavily the longer the training went on. Several times, John was tackled, once was playing the person – he had been tackled whilst not even holding the ball. John took it as an indicator that he needed to work harder. These were private school boys who’s lives were heavily formed on rugby. It was an elitism thing. John could have laughed. How ridiculous it seemed. Stupid upper class shits.
“As I said. Nothing is going on. Nothing.” His voice was tight in his throat and he could hear how desperate it sounded. He was sure Anderson could too. There was a moments pause, before Anderson flicked one of his eyebrows.
“I’ve finished my section on the birth of Henry VIII.” John said to Sherlock, leaning back on his chair, his back crackling loudly.
"Sure." There was an awkward pause. John watched the ducks on the water, his ears burning.
“You share room 221b, don’t you?” John nodded, looking at the page which was dotted with information about John’s academia. He let out a silent sigh of relief when he saw no family details listed. “Interesting.” John almost laughed, slowly realising that this was a theatrical performance. “Sherlock Holmes has a number of…challenges. As his roommate,” He said this with narrowed eyes as if he did not believe John.“I feel as though you deserve to have information given to you. You ought to be briefed and to be briefed and prepared.” John nodded again, slower this time, the thoughts of the Friday before clawing his attention. He found himself gripping the edge of the table, clearing his throat.
"Fucking hell John, what's in there?" She asked, bending to pick up the case for as second time.
“He’s playing well, isn’t he.” Mike said, nodding towards the pitch. Greg said something about tactical play (Sherlock was sure the words Greg was using were not actually English) before Mike said something to him.
"Right. Well." Anderson replied.
Just as John was walking into the reception area from his science room, Mike caught sight of him. John pretended to not have seen him, walking quickly away from the thong of students and towards the large doors that opened out into the land. It was lunch and John knew that if Mike spoke with him, he’d have to eat in the main hall. Currently, John felt very close to tears, so a room full of people would not be a good idea at present.
“Are you stupid?” Sherlock did not look up, opening his bag and dropping the blade inside, along with the remaining rags. “Sherlock!” John repeated and the boy opposite him looked up. He seemed more terrified that he got caught then at the act he was doing in the first place.
“Thank you, Sherlock.” John replied, wiping his hand across his posterior. He could tell he made it worse. Sherlock walked across to his bed and sat down; his back pressed against the wall. He was watching John take off his shoes and socks and John knew that the boy was buzzing to say something. John looked up at Sherlock from his own bed, clearing his throat to indicate that he was listening.
"How can I help?" Her tone was warm and friendly and it made John relaxed a little.
“As long as you’re okay.” Greg replied. “Anderson you fucking wipe, Mike didn’t mean water.” He shouted at the other Man as he fumbled past the chairs with a pint of water in his hand.
“Right.”
“What?” Sherlock asked again, this time in confusion.
“These people have no concept of money, John. Anyone lower are hooligans and they see themselves as the ruling class.” John noticed Sherlock used ‘these people’ as if he didn’t live in a literal mansion. It made John want to laugh, Sherlock didn’t have any proper concept of money either, but at least he was almost aware of the strain that a lack of assets caused John.
Dumbfounded, John hesitated before slipping on his pyjama bottoms and into his bed. The moment had been ruined and John was left with the frustration in his boxers. But they had been close. And that meant they could try again at some point. Although John had been a little drunk and Sherlock more than a little, it had been a conscious decision. For John at least. He wondered if Sherlock would change his mind when sober but somehow knew he would not. He couldn’t help but remember Brighton and the soft things Sherlock said at the pier. The boy truly liked him, and John wasn’t sure what that made him. He was attracted to sherlock, and now he could no longer deny it, but he wasn’t gay. Something about Sherlock was different and John wasn’t sure what, but it was big enough difference to make him want to sleep with him.
“Why don’t you go to sleep?” This made John huff out a laugh loose laugh.
“And which team is that?” He cleared his throat again, the man cocking his eyebrow in response, standing from his chair.
"What do you mean?"
“In a minute.” He responded. Mike sat down and John shuffled his chair round the table.
But he hated Sherlock. John knew something was going on, some form of untouched anguish. His mystery was a force that both compelled John’s interest and made him dislike Sherlock at the same time. The fact he wouldn’t talk to John hurt him, although he was reassured slightly by Mike reminding him that Sherlock rarely spoke to anyone it did not irradiate the concern that something was up. The random disappearances without explanation frustrated him and made matters worse. John found himself randomly waking to check his dorm mate’s bed, which was almost always empty. Then, he would lay awake for hours, listening to the gurgling pipes and wondering where Sherlock was. Hoping that he was safe.
"I guess not." He smirked.
"No problem." John replied, stuttering. As Sherlock stood up to leave, tucking in his chair, he looked to John.
“I’m so proud of you.” Is what Harry had immediately said to John. They had opened the acceptance letter from Bullimore together in Harry’s bedroom.
"Thank you."  He mumbled, turning towards the door. Somewhere, a clock struck 2 and suddenly he felt very alone.
And when John slept Sherlock was in his dreams. Sweet and tender and everything he wanted it to be.
“How are you?” God, he hated pleasantries, especially with Anderson. Sherlock’s silence was welcomed as then John knew their relationship was built on something with substance, more than just a ‘hello’ ‘how are you’ like so many friendships were.
“Squat down.” And Sherlock did as he was told. John preceded to roll the jumper up Sherlock’s torso. “Move one of your arms into the jumper.” And again, Sherlock complied. Then, with one tug, John freed Sherlock’s head and left the right sleeve on Sherlock’s arm, allowing the other boy to pull it off. Sherlock pulled the jumper off his arm and for some reason was still slightly squatted. John went to say something, looking up at Sherlock, when he suddenly met his eyes.
John and Sherlock stumbled into the dorm. They had managed to tap into the gates with no problem, encountering no teachers. John was tired, his body aching from the rugby match earlier in the day and the drowsy effect of the alcohol had set in. He just wanted to go to bed as quickly as possible and rest his heavy bones. Sherlock seemed to be in a similar position, his feet stumbling up the curling stairs. Several times he stopped to steady himself, and several times John had prepared to brace for impact of the falling boy. They made it to their room, however, with no additional bruises.
TW: ALLUDING TO EATING DISORDER BEHAVIOUR
"It's fine, don't worry."  John walked over to the fridge and pulled out a green carton of milk, before pouring milk into his mug. He gestured to Philip, who nodded, before sloshing milk into his mug too.
“John.” Sherlock said suddenly. John looked up from his lap. It was the first time Sherlock had spoken to him since the night before.
"How do you know so much about other people?" John asked. Sherlock looked to him.
“You know what I mean.” John huffed dismissively. “I’m proud of you.” He cleared his throat.
Hello! I wrote this a while ago but edited it today. I haven't slept, what a cool kid, so if you see any spelling/grammar problems please ignore them. Next chapter we FINALLY meet someone. How mysterious. I guess I'll update twice a week? okay bye
“Watson.” His teacher said. Internally, John screamed.
“Are you mean to me on purpose?”
"What did you say to her Sherlock?" John asked once they were far from the shop. Sherlock smirked.
"It's no problem John." Mrs Holmes put down the magazine she was reading onto the sofa and stood up, smoothed her black polka dot dress and walked off. John turned to Sherlock once she left.
- graphic -> described in detail
“And you are not opposed to it either?” That question almost made John openly laugh, but he swallowed it and shook his head. Why would he be? Had Sherlock forgot they had just kissed? “I see.” The boy continued as they walked.
im sorry for disappointing you at all. i want to write this properly and right now i cant.
"So what brings you here?" He asked, wandering across the room and sitting on the opposite bed. It creaked below his weight.
Sherlock wished he could have the variety that John modelled. He was almost envious of his jumpers and polos and t-shirts. The colours, the textures -he seemed to look nice in everything. Sherlock fancied a jumper of his own, but they didn’t flatter him he way that the shirts did. He watched John stretch on the field and could tell he was nervous. It was his first match day after all. Sherlock didn’t understand why John was involved in such a ridiculous game, but it seemed to bring him some joy, so Sherlock humoured him. It was so un-john like. The small, studious, quiet boy playing rough and tumble, it was almost laughable. Sherlock invested his interest in him for the simple reason that it added dimension to John.
Inside the dorm room, it seemed as though John had improved. He was in his pyjamas, in bed reading some form of poetry book. Sherlock handed John his tea before sitting on his bed, ruffling his hair aggressively. He didn’t mean for Anderson to get under his skin, but something about him made Sherlock instinctively angry. He ran his hand over the red patch on his arm, the skin warm and tight.
"John." John turned to Sherlock, his heartbeat in his mouth. "I am finished now, thank you for letting me use your pen."
So, they went to the off license near the pub and bought more booze, but it mattered little to John whether they drunk or not. Sherlock, of course, went to the counter. He was known round the village, he had lived there since he was born, so the owner of the off license simply laughed when Sherlock pretended to be 18, asked him what he would like and gave it to him at no charge. The boys were thoroughly impressed by this.
His dorm was halfway across the grounds, by a cluster of trees. Surrounded by a picket fence, the house reminded him of a classic English cottage. Made of grey brick, with roses climbing up the windows, it truly felt like a house he always wanted. The terracotta roof reflected the sun and John had to shield his eyes as he searched in the pack for his house key. It was heavy and slotted neatly into the wooden door, and turned easily in the lock. After taking a deep breath, John pushed it open.
“Hello John.” He said. John sighed internally; he wasn’t in the mood to deal with the irritating shit.
“Of course.”
“We were on the pier drinking.”
“And you did that all night?” Greg was drunk too, but he was more pressing and inquisitive than Mike, who seemed not to care. Greg made John more alert, he too was nice, but there was an edge to him that Mike did not have.
“Nothing.”
There was a knock on the door. Both the men looked to it, before Sherlock turned back to John and raised his right eyebrow. John cleared his throat and picked up his tea, pretending to be fixated on the inside of the cup whilst Sherlock lay back on his pillow and crossed his hands behind his head.
As the car rolled ahead, John folded his hands in his lap. He felt anxious. New people. New, rich people with more money John could ever dream of owning. How could he be friends with people he couldn’t relate to? Perhaps he could pretend to be some prince from somewhere in Eastern Europe. As he deliberated this, the car began moving up hill, the stones crunchy under the wheels. Somewhere behind him, John heard the gates slam and he suddenly realised that this was all very real. Perhaps they would like him for who he was. Perhaps people would like his awkward laugh and love for knitted wear. Perhaps they would be able to ignore that he didn’t belong there, at least not financially, and he could make friends. And, as John began to wish, the car turned up the drive and towards the school.
“Well, Brighton is the gay capital of England, Sherlock. Didn’t you know that?” Sherlock shook his head.
"Yes, I'm fine." John said. Sherlock nodded and walked away and John slammed his book shut, suddenly feeling a sick panic he hadn't felt in a while. The insects at the back of his head suddenly beating their wings loudly.
“It’s okay.” They met eyes for a moment and smiled to each other, before John left and shut the door.
“No.” He replied, his voice breaking suddenly as he began to cry. Sherlock furrowed his brow, unsure of quite what to do.
"How?" Mrs Holmes sighed at that question.
“See, Mike’s having fun.” Sherlock said, swinging his arm into the air and barely missing Greg’s nose. “Everyone’s having fun. Fun. Fun. Fun.”
“Your relationship to Sherlock.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, she is openly homosexual? In your house?”
One of Sherlock's shelves had collapsed and was hanging off the wall. It was only one side, so all the objects had slid off the shelf and onto the floor. Sherlock was on his hands and knees picking the objects up and putting them on his double bed.
“Greg leave it.” Mike cut, shoving his shoulder.
As they walked the hostel, the silence carried on. Sherlock seemed to be thinking, rearranging, data collecting something in his mind. John signed himself and Sherlock in at the sheet on the front desk before following Sherlock into a room with 4 different sets of bunk beds in them. John sat on the bottom of one bunk and Sherlock the bottom of the bunk opposite. He took up the position of his fingers steepled under his chin, processing deeply.
When they arrived at the station, John felt as though he’d stepped into a completely different universe. The classic South Eastern station design was familiar, and made John feel a little less distanced from his classmates. They all had to get on the same train, after all. However, John couldn’t help but over hear some of his peers complaints. ‘This station smells like piss.’ One had said as they walked down the stairs to the platform. Another had called it scummy. For John, it was a reminder of the vast separation between himself and his peers.
"Bollocks to what's safe John! What's the point in always being safe? You don't get to live!" He stood up suddenly and gestured widely, stumbling slightly at the power of his own arms. John grabbed him by his arm and sat him down. "This is living John! Drinking and sunsets and being with people you love." Sherlock paused and took a swig of the echo falls. He then rolled the bottle behind them. It made a clattering sound as it found its home next to one of the barriers. "And the sea. I love the sea. I love the way it smells and the colours. They look like your eyes." Sherlock looked to John, who blushed slightly. "I like your eyes. I like the way they reflect light. Like the sea." Sherlock took the bottle of prosecco, shook it vigorously and popped its cork. Prosecco rained on their laps and the fork flew into the waves. John watched as it floated away.
Sherlock watched John stretch, his friend looking concentrated in a way he had never seen before. He bent and tucked and jumped and lunged for some minuets, Sherlock’s own body aching at the sight of John. He could tell the shorter boy was nervous, though, he was repeatitvly running his hands down the short sleeves of his jersey, something he did also with his jumpers.
“Maybe they don’t want to pay for fuel.” Sherlock replied, adjusting himself slightly in his seat. “Or perhaps they fear the windows will be smashed in a car park.” John shook his head.
“Why not a palace?” And John laughed.
The entrance hall was large, with a desk placed in front of the stairs, mirroring the ones that John had walked up outside. There was a globe light on the desk, and a wide screen behind the desk, positioned just under the bannister, the entire room illuminated by the glass roof above.. To his left and right were corridors, with a sign with room numbers on them, as well as the words East and West.
John wasn't quite sure whether he ought to have helped the driver with his case, so awkwardly stood by the boot of the car. The driver bent to open the back, before looking up at John.
“Just keep it in mind.”
"So, have you been here long?"
“Yes.” God, people are so frustrating.
"Well, what's the other?" John enquired.
Suddenly, the door opened with a squeak and a man wearing a navy pinstripe suit approached him, extending his hand towards John. In slight distress, John stood, knocking the table with his knees as he did so and clearing his throat. He had startling blue eyes, framed by a crop of receding ginger hair and heavy set cheeks surrounding his flat mouth.
“I can’t believe it.” Was all John could say. She ruffled his hair.
“Move your elbow in!” John suggested as Sherlock’s arms flailed helplessly.
"Are you coming down to breakfast?" Asked John, purposefully loudly. Those already downstairs turned to John, and Greg looked up with annoyance on his face.
John hadn't mentioned the kiss, nor knew what it meant. Sherlock had been very drunk, as had he, and although Sherlock had seemed to want to kiss him the alcohol probably skewed his judgment. It felt like some hazy dream. He remembered when Harry got a large tattoo on her hip bone of female genitalia in line art after going to Wetherspoons.
The next morning, Sherlock was no where to be seen. Perhaps he had already woken up? John doubted it, and tried to suppress the bubble of anxiety in his stomach with a cup of strong tea. He wasn’t sure why he cared about Sherlock, but he did, and his roommates abrupt comings and goings put him on edge. The least he could do is let him know what he was doing. He guessed Sherlock didn’t owe him that, they weren’t friends after all.
“It’s no problem, Sherlock.”
"I'm just impressed with everything he's done. Not even a year out of university and he's already found himself success." Mrs Holmes lifted her glass of bucks fizz to her lips, smiling at John, who sheepishly smiled back. It seemed as though this was being said for John’s benefit. " I just hope you can do the same."
"Sherlock Holmes." He replied, shaking out his curls and shifting his white shirt. "I'm going out for a smoke." Sherlock said nothing more, stood up and walked off. John was left a little startled, the guide still in his hands.
“Pardon, Mike.” Sherlock responded, his brain not quite catching up with the information.
"I'll keep that in mind." John replied in a low tone, sitting on the bed.
The local train station was just passed the local town, a 30 minuet bus journey in one of Bullimore’s on site mini-buses. Of course, they weren’t like the regular blue ones with sliding doors that John had been used to. They were black and sleek with tinted windows and thick leather seats.
“Greg leave it.” Mike cut, shoving his shoulder.
“Sorry, I thought you were going to fall.” John sighed, shaking the water off his arm.
“John, really, I’m okay. Thank you though.” And John could barely see his face in the twilight that was ever darkening, but he could tell there was a small, gentle smile pressed on Sherlock’s lips.
"Oh, sorry" John stirred his tea bag.
“I’m getting you some chips.” John replied as he stood up from the bench.
And somehow, somehow, they were friends despite their differences. John watched Sherlock walk up ahead, his shirt and trousers shifting as he took each step. How much would that be? The shirt looked expensive, sewn with some slightly silky material, and his trousers looked well pressed. The shirt alone was probably more than all of the jumpers John owned. Still, unlike the other boys, Sherlock didn’t seem to think any less of him because of his lack of money. Although they never said anything to his face, John knew that his shoes were too scuffed for a private school and his hair cut a little too short. Sherlock ignored that and, out of everyone, spoke to him. It made John glow a little, no amount of money could buy Sherlock Holmes’ attention and yet he had it.
“Well.” John cleared his throat. He wasn’t sure what to say. “It’s okay. I-I don’t mind.” He replied, clearing his throat again, and quickly looking down.
Neither boy said anything, they simply looked each other in the eyes. John wondered how long they would stay like this, frozen and looking at each other. He wasn't complaining. He rather like the way Sherlock looked. His hair was falling in messy black curls, fluffy and windswept. Sherlock still wore the white shirt from the other day, as well as black trousers. They had light mud stains on the cuffs. Despite looking ragged, he somehow managed to still look good. Sherlock did not seem to be resistant in holding his gaze, it seemed more like a challenge.
“Yes, home.” Sherlock dropped the filter, stomped on it rather too agressivly and continued walking. “Our homes are very different.”
“Get it to me this evening please. Do you know where Mr Holmes is?” John shook his head. “He’s missed quite a few lessons. If you see him, please ask him to come and see me so I can catch him up.” John nodded as the teacher moved passed to the next set of tables. It was a lucky escape – John was glad that Mr McGowan was so lenient. If he had been given a detention he would have started crying right then and there. To preoccupy himself, John played with the lining of his blazer, naming all the elements in the periodic table as he did so, his brain thick with honey.
“What’s wrong?”
John speaks to Anderson for the first time, who says some unkind things about Sherlock before going to a Chemistry lesson.  Together, John and Sherlock sit an exam when suddenly Sherlock becomes cold towards a confused John.
“One, Harry.”
“Sherlock.” And the boy turned around, his face half illuminated by the twilight. “I’m sorry about Mycroft. I promise you he didn’t tell me anything I didn’t know before.” Sherlock sat on the edge of his bed, stippling his fingers in thought.
"Sure. Thank you."
"Where have you been the last 2 days?" Sherlock shrugged and lay down on his bed.
This somehow made John feel worse. He was a scholar in all 4 of his subjects, so fees were completely paid, but if he dropped just one of the grades in his subjects, he would have to leave. The thought made him sic. He came to Bullimore because of the opportunities he would be able to gain from it, the networking, as well as the quality of education. Raglesfield, in contrast, had been one of the worst schools in London. It was known for its notoriously bad behaviour, low grades and poor facilities. John still couldn’t believe that he had managed to obtain a scholarship.
With the blow of a whistle, the game begun, and Sherlock found himself drifting his gaze to John, who was currently standing still, rather than on the ball. It frustrated him, being unable to unlock John. It was easy to do with others – they opened up so simply. Take Mike, for example, his family had a large amount of money, his grandmother acting as the head of family with all the wealth. He flaunted it, not purposefully, but obviously enough. He always wore a heavy strapped Rolex on his wrist, his glasses from some brand like Gucci or Prada. His shoes always perfectly souled, the leather well kept. They were small things, but they made Mike appear more like a person, he was sure he could ask Mike what car he drove, what clothes brand he wore and Mike would tell him. John, however, falsely opened up. He said enough that made him appear approachable and interesting (which he was) but it was a façade. He had a sister, some form of parental figure, but after that it was lost. It was purposeful, all of it, from the jumpers he wore to the work he did. It all acted as a wall against the outside world. Sherlock scuffed his foot against the soft ground in frustration. He wished John would trust him more outwardly, but somehow knew that would never happen. He was a puzzle, not one that necessarily needed to be solved, but one that he wanted to see the picture of. One that he wanted to understand yet Sherlock knew John would never allow that. At least not for a while.
“Thank you, John” His teacher said, nodding towards him. John smiled a small smile.
Wednesday morning was history, which was another subject John shared with Sherlock. He'd got used to the routine by now. Wake up silently and get changed for food in silence. John would go down to breakfast and, when he returned, Sherlock would be reading, already dressed in his uniform. Sherlock would never eat with him, arguing that it was too much effort in the early in the morning to make himself toast. To John, it was an excuse, but he never argued with him. Sherlock would then leave to go and smoke and, whilst he was gone, John would get into his uniform. Then, when Sherlock returned, John would wait for Sherlock to pick up his bag before they'd walk to their lesson. If they had separate classes, then Sherlock would go to where ever he needed to be and wouldn’t be seen until late evening most days. This routine was done in relative silence, the only speech would be if Sherlock wanted a pen, or if John was asking for a cup of tea.
“I’ve got work to do for tomorrow.” He replied, sighing heavily, running his hands through his hair.
"Thank you." Sherlock then bent his head and began writing rapidly. John licked his lips anxiously; did he need to say something else?
"Ah, no. Everywhere else was too loud. Do you have any paper?" John nodded, ripping out a page of his notebook and passing it to Sherlock. "A pen?" John paused and searched his pencil case.
“What makes you say that?”
“It’s no problem.” John replied with a close mouth smile, sliding his shoes under his bed.
Sherlock had a small smile on his face, but he quickly swallowed it and nodded.
"You alright?" John asked. Sherlock looked up and nodded.
“Are you going to tell dad?” John had looked up at her and shook his head. Harry shrugged. “Mum would be proud.”
"What." Sherlock called. The door opened. He heard Sherlock sigh. "What do you want, Anderson?" John looked up and saw Anderson standing in the centre of the doorway, dressed in his dressing gown.
hello hello hello hello
“I don’t know. I saw him earlier and he said some stuff.” John wasn’t specific. They didn’t ask any further. After a moments pause, John continued. “He seems attached to Sherlock?”
“It’s not problem, John.” Greg replied, shifting his seat for Mike. John sipped his drink and smiled.
“It’s the chemistry mock exam.” John responded. “I need to finish it.”
“Oh. Okay.” John was unsure how to reply but Sherlock obviously deemed this valuable enough information that he ought to know it. Sherlock flashed a brief, false, smile, adjusted his shirt and walked through the double French doors. John followed suit.
“I think I know what I’m dealing with, Mike.” He retorted. They stopped outside the dorm house door.
The town was quiet. It was more of a village then a town, the wide, single road that led to the motor way 15 miles away, surrounded by charity shops and independent eateries. The pavemnts were cobbled with red stone, the curb marked with grey slate. It felt very much like a pentioner village. It was a pentioner village, Greg had said. He’d studied the local area for geography the previous year.
“I am trying.” The boy replied from under the jumper collar. John was quickly losing his rag.
“Yes, it is.” Greg responded, glancing at Mike who raised his eyebrows.
“Your friendship means a lot to me too, Sherlock. And I’ll try to remember, just…please be careful.” He paused. “And I’d prefer if you got some form of support.” They held each others gaze.
“Maybe.” Mike said with a serious tone. “It wouldn’t surprise me.”
"Okay. Fine." He put his shoes on angrily and picked up his dorm key.
“Anderson.” He replied in an exaggeratedly tired manner, walking back over to the kettle.
“I know.” John replied simply and he saw Sherlock swallow gently.
"Hello, who are you?" Said the boy.
“I’d hardly say it was a kidnap John.” Sherlock said with a smile, pulling a cigarette from his breast pocket.
“That you’re my roommate.” He nodded. “Which you are. You are my…roommate.”
“No, it’s not. He doesn’t choose to be miserable. He doesn’t chose any of it. It’s all a result of his brain. Just be sensitive.” John laughed at him.
"I'm not on a programme. I've got a complete scholarship, so every subject is a specialty one." John rubbed the back of his neck. "I guess it'd be science though, biology." God, he felt like a pretentious twat.
"Incredible."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you.” John replied, his voice steady and flat. He waited a moment before continuing to walk, his pace quickening as he exited the room, his first balled.
“That’s Mycroft.” He said, rising from his bed and shelving his book. John furrowed his brows in disbelief.”
so im gonna be simple. as you know, there are some pretty intense topics and themes in this fic that only become worse as they go. when i started writing this, it was a form of therapy for me to cope with things ive experienced. however, because life is a bitch, writing this has become more difficult. not only because im struggling with some sherlock-ism myself, but also because it's quite a taxing thing to write about in general. ive got little motivation atm and work is sucking the life out of me
“I know.” Sherlock replied, raising his eyebrows in agreement. John smiled widely.
“Who? John” Mike asked.
John felt sick, anxiety and alcohol churning in his empty stomach, so found himself in the kitchen grabbing a glass of water, his hand shaking as he held the cup under the tap.
“What’s he done?” Gred asked.
“Yeah, I’m just tired.”
“And what did you say? John paused, meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock did not necessary struggle with human emotions, but he simply found them frustrating. They took too much time to deal with – Sherlock could be doing so much more if his own emotions or others did not exist. Sherlock had mastered the art of blurring his own emotions, allowing the few that they were to settle somewhere in his stomach. This allowed the daytime to be almost emotionless, or at least more controlled. This, of course, meant at night that the daytime emotions suddenly surfaced. The supressed feelings rearing their head amplified.
“It matters not.” Sherlock replied, brushing off the conversation. “Who did he say he was?”
“Sherlock, are you okay?” But the boy seemed to only be able to nod in reply before he moved towards John, Sherlock’s lips pressing hard against his own. John moved onto his knees so Sherlock did not have to bend down so much. Sherlock seemed to agree with this position very much, his hands gently pulling at the hairs of John’s head as he kissed him with his tongue. The room was completely silent filled only by the sound of the occasional rustle of the bed sheets against Sherlock’s back as the leant down slowly, allowing John to sit himself on his stomach, John’s lips moving in synch with Sherlock’s. His counterpart had moved his hands to John’s waist, gently moving his fingers across his hips and along the button of his trousers.
He was pacing back and forth, dramatically playing his song. John watched. He had been working, but gave up 20 minutes ago. Once Sherlock started, John didn't know when he'd stop so it was impossible to work even if he had wanted to. Sherlock an incredible musician, and so John saw it as a privilege to watch him play.
“That’s fine. I’ve done it already.” He said, moving off his bed and towards John’s desk, filtering through the papers on his desk.
“What do you mean?” John asked, looking up at his smiling friends and… Anderson.
"That's your guide and your welcome pack. The large key is the key to the dorm house and the other a key to your room. Your dorm is in building two, on the second floor, room 1 B. Term starts tomorrow, 8:15, and students will begin to arrive from 5 o'clock tonight. If you have any problems, let me know.” John found himself nodding vigorously, taking the pack and fumbling with the pages as she looked back down, indicating that John ought to leave.
John had always liked train journey’s. They reminded him of childhood and the summer, and Sherlock’s upbeat exterior seemed to only intensify this feeling. It felt as though they were going on a summer holiday.
“Yeah. Thanks.” Greg nodded as John sat at one of the desk chairs. It was still fairly dark, the sun barely up, and Mike was sleeping soundly. John heard the door gently clink closed and watched Greg move towards his chest of draws. The room layout was identical to his dorm, except the curtains were blue and white checked.
“We’re thinking of going into town and grabbing food after the game. Will you come?” John asked across the two other boys, who were to Sherlock’s left. Sherlock rubbed his arm self-consciously.
“I see.” His teacher replied, quickly noting something on a piece of paper. “Could you give this to your history teacher?
“Yes, alright. If you want.” He sat down and sighed.
“No Sir. I’m sorry.” He watched Mr McGowan hesitate. Out of all his teachers, his history teacher was probably his favourite. He saw the teachers brows furrow. John always did his work and he was thankful he was so attentive.
“I don’t really understand what is going on, I won’t lie to you.” He heard Greg laugh. “But as long as John’s team wins.”
“Do you have a close relationship.” Sherlock asked. John shrugged.
“Yes…well, thanks.” John mumbled, watching Anderson as he glanced to their table occasionally. “But we’re not going out. I’m not into…men. I’m just trying to make friends with him.” Greg nodded.
"No, you'll just see. Sherlock can be challenging sometimes." Greg replied, cutting into his beef. "He's smart too, so I think you'll get on well."
When he arrived, he noticed Sherlock at the desk. It took every single muscle in John’s body for him not to both scream at Sherlock and hug him. His voice caught in his throat as he sat down to speak, unable to look at Sherlock’s face.
"Yes.” He stated. “And I got an assortment of alcohol, including prosecco, and some ready salted Pringles."
"Nothing much. Smiled at her, complimented her, told her that she's worth more than that shop, which isn’t wrong."
“It’s quite grey.” John nodded. They turned a corner, walking passed a structure on a green that looked like the kremlin and towards the sea front.
“You don’t need to have them all, Sherlock. Just some.” Which made Sherlock groan. “I need you to soak up some that alcohol.” John continued, pretending to ignore the very clear resistance Sherlock was showing and the growing anxiety in the back of his head. He wondered what Sherlock would have done had he been sober. He pauses, waiting for Sherlock to say something else. He did not, so John walked over to the counter, his chest heavy with guilt.
At the end of the assessment, John gave his paper quickly to Mr Smitham, not looking him in the eyes.
Sherlock had never watched a game of rugby before, so he wasn’t quite sure whether John’s team was winning or not. It was mostly silent, other than the occasional shout from one of the boys and the scrape of their boots against the mud. John did not seem to be doing much at the moment other than shout some form of criticism, however, he seemed completely focused on the game. Sherlock couldn’t help but fixate on John. He had his legs bent, arms ready at his side, shuffing from foot to foot, ready to receive the ball. Sherlock thought that this was the most interesting John had ever been. John knew exacly what he was doing, and the way his eyes scanned the pitch made Sherlockwonder what he was thinking. He would never be able to guess, and there was very little that Sherlock did not know, which gave him all the more insentive to watch John, to find out what was happening. He himself only dabbled in tennis once or twice, but he couldn’t see what was so interesting in a ball being hit or, in this case, passed around. Still, John seemed engaged so Sherlock thought he’d give it a go.
"Your trunk is empty so you've been here long enough to unpack, and the key was left in this lock" The boy threw the key to John, which he caught. "You've got holes in your socks and the shoes downstairs are scuffed and worn, clearly you can't buy new shoes. No one’s feet here are that small, and you’re the only new person I’ve seen. Thus, the shoes are yours." The boy threw himself on the bed, landing with his hands behind his head. The door swung shut.
“Yes.”
“John and I are just friends, Gavin, as I’m sure John himself has told you before. It’s almost perverted that you’ve created this fantasy in your head that John and I are secretly together. I suppose you imagine that we disappear to our dorms at allocated times to have sexual intercourse and then deny everything. This isn’t gossip, Gavin, it is real life, and your hyper fixation on John and I’s relationship is odd at least and truly disturbing when I really think about it. So, try and think about your own lack of sex life, because no one believes you went and fucked a girl at the other school, instead of instilling your sexual insecurities onto others.” There was silence and Sherlock sighed. Greg muttered something incoherent to Sherlock, but his eyes were burning so badly that he could not listen, his head filled with anger and frustration. He felt his vision grow cloudy just as John walked onto the pitch, who waved to him from a distance, before fluffing his curly hair and staring angrily into the distance.
The interior was as impressive as the garden, dark polished wooden floors with a long white clothed table running through the centre of the room. There were about 5 high back chairs either side, facing towards oil paintings hung on pastel blue walls. John’s eyes lingered on a portrait of Sherlock (they had caught his eyes perfectly) and a larger, brown haired boy.
“I’m sorry. For yesterday.”
“I’d hate to play in all that mud. I think I’d rather stay inside.” Just as Sherlock was about to remark about the fact Mike spent too much time inside, there was a whistle and the game started.
“Thank you.” And Harry sighed.
"Well I'm not." John took that as Sherlock wanting him to leave.
“No, I haven’t.” John threw a sarcastic smile to Anderson, who returned it. “Have you?”
"At least it's Friday!" Returned John, trying to put a positive spin on his new friends hangover.
“She’s 22. 23 next week actually.”
"Who is…"
He loved Sherlock. Or at least, he liked him greatly. John couldn’t avoid that. He tended to ignore it, pretend as though he cared little at all. He attempted to pass it off as a feeling of friendship. But everytime Sherlock was in their dorm there was some kind of force. The atmosphere tense, not with hostility but with something else. John didn’t know whether Sherlock felt it too, but he couldn’t forget what he said.
"John Watson" The teacher called, and John looked away from Sherlock’s hands and to the front.
"I'm going home." John cocked his head.
And now, as John lay down on his bed, resting the pack on his stomach, he wished that his mother would be proud of him. Silently, as he fell asleep, John promised her that he’d make his life better at this school. I’ll try my best to make things better.
“Good play, John!” Mike called next to him. The whistle had been blown for half time and John was walking from his corner, passed them and towards the hut. The boy had stuck his hand up to wave in response, a sheepish grin on his face. Sherlock noticed how John’s gaze seemed to be meeting his.
“Yes.” Sherlock responded simply, walking quickly down the stairs.
"What else? What is she wearing?"
"Then what am I?" John asked angrily. The words came out sharp and violent and John's throat stung from the force. He tried to suppress the heat building in his throat, but he began to feel his face getting flushed. Sherlock paused, his eyes confused.
Mike and Greg didn’t ask many questions. They let John say as much as he felt comfortable repeating. They could connect the dots if they truly wished, but Mike wasn’t the most type and Greg was mature enough to know when to push it. Now, was not the time. John just told them that Sherlock just got up and left in the middle of the night after they had an argument about him leaving randomly (not strictly untrue, John told himself.) They didn’t ask why John was awake all night or why he needed to be in their room, Mike knew John would tell them with time. He noted when John said ‘Sherlock’s doing just what you said he’d do.’ in a tight and tired voice. Although it was very little, Mike could guess what John was implying. He shook his head at this, and told John that Sherlock had his moments, which made the boy sigh in return.
"I just don't know what to do, Johnny." She said. She had always called John ‘Johnny’, she was the only one who did. He was glad of it, it made him feel all the more special and as though Johnny existed simply for her. John was sitting on the sticky carpet of their old flat, before the move. It had always been unkept, John seemed to remember the curtains always being drawn during the day not to attract attention, his mother had said. The TV flashing static. Her hands were skinny, the tendons showing through the flesh, and her eyes were set into her skull with large black rings under them. John had smiled, unsure what to say.
“I didn’t realise he could have friends.” Mike returned. John felt himself flush.
“I know what you mean.” John replied.
“It doesn’t make it okay, though. If-if-if he goes off and doesn’t come back? Then what. Who’s to blame?” John gestured to himself and Greg battered his hand away.
"Yes sir?" He faltered, his eyes meeting those of his teacher.
That evening, both boys were sat at their respective desks, working away at the work that Mr McGowan, their history teacher, had set. There was a lot of it, but it had to be done in order to go on the trip.
"Do you really think that that's good beach wear?" John asked as Sherlock was tying a pair of black shoes. Sherlock looked up at John, scanning his outfit, before looking at his own.
"It upsets me that you don't think we're friends." Sherlock threw John a confused looked before laughing mockingly.
“You know it’s only 3 o’clock.” Sherlock replied and John groaned in response.
“Well yes. I know.”  Sherlock paced back and forth, clenching and unclenching his hand.
"It was beautiful." John said. Sherlock shrugged, throwing himself on the other sofa. "Is it all from memory?" John asked.
"Thank you so much darling. Bu-bye." Sherlock picked up the white and blue striped plastic bag and smiled falsely behind him as he pushed the door open to leave. There was a melodic bing bong from inside the shop. John watched the woman behind the counter sigh and smile wistfully in Sherlock's direction.
“Give me it.”
“Alright.” John smiled with his lips pressed together, he could barely force it out.
"Myc won't be back this year either; he's doing some form of internship." His mother said in a proud yet tired tone. Clearly the Holmes' weren't often home at the same time.
“Yes Sir.” He glanced up.
“Yes, Sherlock.” John was sorting out some papers on his desk.
It was now November, the pressure slowly mounting. However, John remained in good spirits. He was doing enough work to make him feel confident (other than in chemistry – but John didn’t think he would ever be confident when doing chemistry) and he was growing closer to Mike and Greg. Since the rugby match in October, they had become a trio, sometimes a quad when Sherlock arrived, and John felt as though he could call them friends. Every morning they would eat breakfast together and at the weekend they would go out to the local and get food and then walk back to the school together. They would never discuss anything particularly deep and never asked about Sherlock (which John was thankful for) but their presence was enough. Although it was a small routine that had formed, it made John feel as though he had his own life, a feeling he had never had before.
sorry for the absence, ive just had some family health scares to deal with lol! global pandemic am i right. the coming chapters were due for christmas but im trying not to beat myself up about it. how have things been with you? thank you for the support :)
“Do you want anything?” John asked the boy, who currently had his head between his leg, with a nod of his head..
“I’m fine, John.” He responded with a nod and Mike laughed lightly, passing round an assortment of snacks.
“What do you think of Brighton, then?” John asked.
“Sherlock, its been a week, why the fuck do you think it’s okay.”
"Are you alright" He asked in a monotonous tone.
"Well okay, bring me back some." Sherlock shook his head as he tied his laces.
“You alright, Sherlock.” John asked, sitting next to him.
“Yep. Um.” John responded flatly, but internally panicked, unsure what to say.
“I don’t think you do. This is Sherlock Holmes, John, you need to be careful.” Again, John laughed, unlocking the door to the dorm as he did.
When he returned to the dorm, Sherlock was gone. John didn’t know where and he didn’t particularly care. He knew he acted irrationally and he should apologise, but right now John couldn’t even bare to think of looking at Sherlock, let alone speaking to him.
“It was, we should do it again.” He replied, before turning over in his bunk opposite.
TW: GRAPHIC SELF HARM AT THE END OF CHAPTER (the action of)
“Do you have your essay plan, John?” Mr McGowan asked in the Monday morning lesson. The weekend had passed in a blur and John didn’t do anything but sit in the dorm room. He didn’t remember if he ate anything at all. It seemed as if everything was removed, as if John had stepped back. He found himself shaking his head, checking the watch on his wrist to ensure he was awake. And suddenly, it was Monday.
