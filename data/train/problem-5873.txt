Several other projections aren’t so lucky; unable to stop in time, their clunky metal bodies are pulverized beneath the crushing wheels.
Guilt was an old friend, wrapping around his ribs to squeeze at his heart. Reminding him of things he couldn’t make right. On bad nights, the thought of slipping into the darkness didn’t sound unappealing. There was something calling him to jump, just jump…
“Um. Fascinating.” Steve shifted restlessly. If all Stark needed was a conversation partner, then he should leave him to get back to Wanda. “Are you gonna be okay?”
Scott doesn't waste a moment, stamping down on the gas to put distance between them and the city. Wanda slumps down into her seat, breathing heavily at the exertion.
Now that Tony wasn’t in constant motion, Steve takes the chance to study him more closely; a smaller, more compact frame, but no lightweight either - the lean lines of muscle in his arms and shoulders speak of a man who had spent years building things with his hands. Tony’s face is rapt with concentration, and his brown eyes - now that they weren’t glaring - are large and long-lashed, ardently focused on his work.
“I've got this,” With a twist of his wings, Sam flips around midair, shooting backwards and towards the armored cars. But instead of charging them head on, he veers to the side, diving under the freeway in a wide arc to land nimbly on the riverbank.
"Wakanda, huh? Do you know anything about the job?" Steve asked. The small African nation had abandoned its isolationist position just a few years ago, but was already one of the main players in medical research. Their first move on the international stage had caused a stir - the Wakanda Design Group introduced a technology allowing amputees regrow lost limbs - and many suspected that that was just the tip of the iceberg concerning the full range of their expertise.
“You don’t need to worry about me being compromised.” Steve leans against the wall. There’s too much riding on this mission for him to just… let his feelings run away with him.
“The Forger impersonates people that the target knows in real life to manipulate the subconscious. Parents, siblings, girlfriends...” Steve raised a finger, seeing Wanda’s eyebrows rise. “I know how it sounds, but it helps to play the emotional angle.”
There were so many good memories of them in this apartment; long hours spent preparing for an mission, patching up wounds, sharing celebratory pizza. It had been more than just a shared workplace or a couch to crash on - it had felt like a home.
“Hah! I wouldn’t be too sure about that.” And with a laugh that was only slightly edged with worry, Shuri launched herself at T’Challa, pulling him into a fierce hug which he returned just as strongly. It was a sweet moment which made even Wanda’s normally-stern expression curve into smile.
Now, with only two weeks to the deadline, everyone was gathered in Sam’s living room for a team meeting.
“Don't touch it,” Steve grabs Tony's hand and pulls him away. The idea of those talented hands frostbitten and useless makes his heart thump all the quicker. “It’ll freeze your hands off if you do.”
“Shitty” didn’t even begin to describe the hardships Steve had faced: from growing up in poverty in the 40s, to fighting in a war, to being thrown into the future where all his family and friends were dead, to being forced into an endless string of battles against aliens and other inter-dimensional horrors...
After what seems like an eternity, the enormous train grinds to a stop. Its hulking metal body lies in the crossbar of the junction like a corpse of some massive beast, cutting off their only exit.
They can’t escape even if they wanted to; the somnacin keeps them under for one full cycle at the very least. The only way out is to go deeper into the labyrinth.
“That's correct, Ms Romanoff.” T’Challa was standing in the doorway of the operating theatre, looking unfairly alert and put together for someone dragged out of bed in the middle of the night. “This is our only opening. If we don’t act now, it will be too late.”
His surroundings are furnished in dark greys and frosted glass, modern and minimalist. Rows of computer screens and server towers line the walls, glinting coldly under the fluorescent lighting.
“Sweetheart, ‘shameless’ could be my middle name.” The smugness in Stark’s voice is infuriating. “Well, actually, it's Edward, but nobody gives a fuck about details like that.” His breath hitches, and he makes a series of sounds - short breaths and soft grunts - that Steve really doesn't want to think about too hard.
Stark had spent the last half hour on stage talking up himself, before introducing his latest invention in his usual cocky manner. He described a terrifyingly powerful artificial intelligence with a flippancy that was perhaps even more terrifying. With every feature Stark listed, T’Challa’s dread had grown.
The After was measured in hospital visits, grim conversations with Sam, changing his job from Architect to Extractor, accepting any job that came by, long days of blank exhaustion, biting his tongue while he shook hands with corrupt businessmen, and - when he was able to sleep - fleeing from the
“Okay, okay, I'll be good. I even have one of those eco-friendly bulbs so I can last longer this time.” Tony lengthened his string, lowering his balls to Steve’s surface. As he bore down, his shutters began to open, unfurling like the petals of a flower.
Life as a sexy lamp wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, though. Being anchored to the ceiling made him the centrepiece of the room, but it also meant that he was always apart from the other furniture pieces. Always above them, never with them.
Sighing, Steve slicked his hair back and hung the towel on the rack. He threw on a pair of sweatpants and an undershirt before heading to the kitchen.
Despite the cold, Steve feels sweat break out behind his neck. He can barely see ten feet into the fog, but he knows, deep in his bones what’s coming next.
Frantic, Scott throws everything he can on the wheel, barely managing to swerve the van out of the train’s way. They screech to a halt a few bare yards from the path of destruction.
Steve can see the cogs behind Stark’s eyes starting to whirr and for a long terrifying moment he wonders if Stark has seen through their charade.
Their time in Limbo had lasted decades. It had been a creative paradise - pushing their imaginations to the limit, building things that could never exist in the real world - nobody to stop them, not even time. Several lifetimes bookending each other, stretching into infinity. All the time in the world. It had felt like enough.
There had been an awkward moment when T’Challa and Nakia unexpectedly showed up, and Sam half-jokingly offered T’Challa a bowl of cereal. To everyone’s surprise the T’Challa had accepted his offer and was now seated on Sam’s old couch munching serenely on Froot Loops. Steve supposed they'd had stranger days.
hold up his end of the deal. Sure, the king seemed sincere on the surface, but looks could be deceiving - it wouldn't have been the first time Steve’s team had gotten screwed over by a slippery customer.
With an experienced eye, Sam scrutinizes the exposed structural concrete beams that hold the freeway above the water, mentally gauging the speed of the armored cars. “I’m going to give you guys an opening - Tell Scott to maintain his speed. Don’t slow down even for a second. Or else.”
Drawing closer, Tony reaches his un-gauntleted hand towards the carriage, and the sight sends Steve into high alert.
“Projections. They’re what a subconscious uses to defend itself.” Steve kicks the projection’s head out of the way. “They're all after you.”
The faked injuries certainly have an effect on Stark. The sight of his godfather battered and bloody clearly rattles him, but he buries it under a forced geniality. “Cheer up, Obie, this isn’t the worst pickle we've been in. Sunset Boulevard '96, remember that?” Stark’s mouth curls into his trademark smirk, expecting Stane to be familiar with this anecdote.
Some of it splattered over Steve’s shoes and pant leg but he paid it no mind, wordlessly reaching out to hold Stark’s coat out of the way.
Stark’s expectant gaze melted away as the silence drew out. “That’s what I thought, huh? Never mind, stupid question anyway…” Stark sounded gruff as he staggered to his feet. “Sorry for puking on your shoes. Take this, it’s not like I’ll need it…” He rummaged around for his wallet and held it out to Steve with a lopsided grin.
Sensing he’s starting to lose control of the interview, Steve tries for a more placating tone. “Listen to me, I'm here to help you-”
“We could work with that.” Steve forced himself to speak, hoping that no one had noticed his lapse in focus. He turned to Scott. “Did you make the formula we asked for?”
The word hung in the suddenly tense air. Steve could practically hear the concerned looks Sam and Nat were exchanging behind him.
“I don’t want to be defenseless.” Tony’s voice has gone soft and uncertain, as if he’s ashamed of admitting it. His gaze flicks up and for an instant the mask of bravado drops away, and in his eyes- there, Steve can see it now - is the fear of being a burden, of being useless. Of being weak.
Steve hurls the shield up. It arcs towards the chandelier, barely skimming the ceiling, before the spinning edge snaps through the chain. Freed from suspension, the chandelier falls, crushing the six projections and impaling four more that are unlucky enough to stand too close.
“I used to be an architect,” Steve says haltingly. “Did lots of work designing buildings, sculptures, mazes...” he fidgets. “I liked it, and I was good at it.”
A low noise blares through the halls. Sonorus and heavy, like a groan from the rusted throat of some enormous machine. The raucous noise makes Steve's teeth buzz in his head and wraps a chill around his heart.
“That’s cool, how you guys have this superhero spy thing going on.” Wanda looked excited at the prospect, no doubt imagining all types of adventurous scenarios. “Sure beats the internship my friend got at some ad agency.”
“What my mom always told me to: dream big,” Sam reaches into that creative place inside him, focusing on summoning a weapon, and almost immediately a rocket launcher materializes at his feet. He hauls it up in his arms, taking aim at the concrete support beams. “Ready in three… two… one…”
Balanced on the small circle of land, Steve can see the entire expanse of the city laid out before him; how the fog sweeps through every street and avenue like a grey wave, swirling around the skyscrapers and blanketing many of the smaller buildings.
“Don’t be ridiculous. It probably buckled because it wasn’t meant to carry so much weight.” Owner helped Owner’s Companion to their feet. “Are you alright? Let me get some ice for your neck.”
“You're shameless.” Shoving his chair back from the table, Steve resolutely turns to face the glass so he doesn't have to look at him. Evidently everything he'd heard about Stark’s lecherous reputation was true.
He had to find Stark before he got himself in trouble. There was no telling what kind of danger might be lurking in this level of the dream.
The gun hovers a dangerous few inches from Stark’s face but he seems unaware of it; his eyes are locked entreatingly on Steve’s as if trying to pierce through the dehumanizing mask he’s wearing.
Steve nods at her with proud smile. “You've been holding back on us.” Away from the train and the man on the roof, the unnatural cold starts to ebb away. He can start to breathe easier now.
Steve pitches forward onto his hands and takes deep grateful gulps of air, his heart hammering in his once-again corporeal body.
Tony shoves his arm into Steve’s face without so much as a warning. “Check it out! What do you think?” Strapped to his forearm is a sleek gauntlet painted red and gold (how had he found time for
T’Challa gazed out the hotel window at the New York skyline, resisting the urge to pace. Stark’s tower stood out from the rest the skyscrapers, glinting in the setting autumn sun. The huge ugly building was visible throughout the city no matter where you were. The arrogant bastard probably planned that way. “Stark’s artificial intelligence is too dangerous to be allowed to exist. It has to be taken down.”
The van tears through the streets, weaving through any obstacles in their path and steamrolling a few that are. Scott’s wild driving flings the occupants of the van around; Steve hisses as a particularly sharp turn bashes the back of his head against the car roof.
Tony fired up FRIDAY and had her order every Captain America Rose in from every florist in New York. All the Avengers had flowers named after them, and he figured this would be a nice gesture. Not only were flowers Romance 101, the choice of the Captain America Roses was an acknowledgement of the years they’d loved and fought alongside each other. Most important of all, it was simple.
Eyes still shut, Wanda sways her arms like she's conducting an invisible orchestra and the string-taffy road bearing their van starts to bend. Ever so smoothly, the road curves over the train, depositing the van gently at the edge of the bridge.
Ever since the Incident, his dreams - both shared and personal - had been marked by three recurring signs: the train, the ice, and the Shade. Augurs of danger, warnings that his troubled psyche had started to seep into his surroundings...
“I disagree, I think we should go with something positive.” Steve said, slow and sure. “That always wins out over negativity.”
Natasha throws Steve an impatient look through the concealed one-way mirror and that's his signal to enter. Time to head things off at the gate in case Stark actually
The improved design is no less powerful than the first - the blast shreds the metal cabinets to ribbons - but without the hefty kickback. His second blast has the computer terminals splintering in a spray of sparks. The third blast shatters all the windows.
3. I'm hugely relieved that IW didn't introduce too much new canon, which means I can carry on with my original plans for this fic. The movie even gave me some new ideas that I'm going to weave in the later chapters - I had no idea that my 'people disintegrating into nothing' plot point would turn out to be relevant in IW too xD
He turns to each member of his team, trying to project a confidence he doesn’t feel. They all look various degrees of shaken and he can’t blame them - nothing in the world could have prepared them for this type of danger.
“I’m not joking, this is all a dream.” Steve sweeps his arm out, gesturing to the projection in the distance. “Look around you, since when did SI have metal bodyguards?”
Steve draws his shield, not liking the atmosphere of the hallway. Something’s coming, and he has to be ready.
When Steve proposed, saying yes had been the most terrifying and yet simplest decision Tony had ever made. Announcements were made, dates were set, and lots and lots of ‘Hooray We’re Engaged’ sex was engaged in.
“Uh huh. So you keep saying, ” Stark’s gaze goes distracted as his hands fumble around, clearly doing
“My offer has no hidden strings. The only condition is that you succeed.” In one smooth motion, T’Challa rose to his feet, striding over to Steve with the air of a man who knows he's won. “The complete dissolution of the weapons company, Stark Industries. I don't care how you do it or who you choose - I want it gone. These are my terms.”
A cursing Stark claws for his eyes, fighting him all the way like an angry cat. Stark is no pushover - Steve will give him that - but Steve has the advantage in sheer size and power.
“I’ll be the one bringing the party to them!” Tony crows, turning on Steve with a wide, excited grin. He looks so proud of his new creation that Steve can't help smiling back.
“My boy…” Natasha must sense that things are starting to go off the rails, because she reaches out Stane’s big paw of a hand to clamp firmly onto Stark’s shoulder.
The moment over, Sam reverted to work mode. “For starters, we're going to need a bigger team. This isn’t
Steve nodded. “Agreed.” He extended his hand to T'Challa, who shook it as if he conducted clandestine business deals every day.
Wanda looks down herself; she’s in a red bomber jacket and her hair is a lighter shade; honey blonde and wavy. The image jogs something in Steve’s memory and he tries to recall where he’d seen it before… A photo of Wanda, laughing, arm wrapped around the young man with silver hair, the wistful way she had watched T’Challa and Shuri...
With a chuckle, Steve pressed a kiss into the other man’s shoulder. “I’m sure he wouldn’t mind. The table was supposed to come with a diary, but I guess that got lost over the years. I even looked all over for any hidden panels or compartments, but no luck.”
In that darkened ballroom, packed tight with world leaders and business tycoons, T’Challa could sense the beginnings of a storm like no other; ULTRON was far too powerful to ever be used safely. He knew with a lightning certainty that the unnatural - evil, there was no other word for it - technology would lead the world to its doom. He knew it beyond a doubt.
“The rest of you guys know the drill. Time will stretch out as we go deeper down the levels, giving us more breathing room to work. A minute here is several hours the next level down. Remember your points and keep an ear out so you don't miss the kick.” Steve pauses. “Anything hurts you, hurt it back. Get killed - walk it off.”
“Let's hear him out, at least.” Trying to diffuse the tension in the room, Natasha stepped in. "Can you tell us more about the job, your highness?"
“People have called me a lot of things,” Steve decided to ignore the half-hearted attempt flirting. The poor man was clearly disoriented. “You don’t look too good. Do you need help?”
Tony squawked, nearly falling off his chair. "What are you doing here? It's bad luck to see me before the ceremony."
“What do you want? What makes you happy?” Stark’s eyes had regained their former sharpness, but there remained a tinge of desperation in them.
Stark smirks. “Not such a boy scout under there, I see.” He sidles up to Steve, getting up into his space, casting an appreciative look up and down.
“We head to the sky bridge’s access point, which is located ten floors below here. That’ll bring us to the North Tower, where my team is waiting.” When he opens the viewport of the scanner it’s just as Sam said: large packs of projections are congregating on every floor below theirs, blocking their path to the access point.
Steve felt tired in a way that had nothing to do with lack of sleep. It was an inception which had got him into this mess, and the only way out was to perform another inception.
Tony dimmed slightly, swishing his pull string pensively. He missed Rhodey and Pepper. As dreary as the furniture store had been, being with his two best friends had made it worth it. But ever since his new Owner had bought him - he could still remember the exhilarating e surge of energy that flooded through his socket when he was plugged in  had been
“Well, I’m up now.” Sam slipped past Steve, making a beeline for the coffee pot. “I could hear you thrashing around for the last twenty minutes.”
“Steve Rogers. Sam Wilson. Natasha Romanoff. Nakia tells me you are the best so I'll cut right to the chase.” T’Challa said briskly. "Inception. I’m told you can do it."
“Projections. He’s had dream security training.” Steve says grimly. “Top level too, judging by the quality of armor and weaponry.”
Natasha dusts off her hands matter-of-factly once settle Stark in the back seat. “That's phase one down. Now we just have to get to the next point.”
Time, that was the start and end of the problem. Once, Steve never would have thought too much time would be a bad thing. Not until he was staring eternity in the face and the full enormity of it hit him like an armor-piercing shell. Living the same days over and over again, endlessly and agelessly, was a terrifying fate.
Steve shivered. Being touched by Tony was something out of this world. He could sense the energy thrumming from Tony, from his bright heart down the pleasure-slackened string, out through the ceramic balls kissing his surface almost lazily. The whisper of electrons charged the air with static, and despite himself Steve could feel the knots in his grain tighten with the tension.
“...mmf, that's right. And there we go.” Stark’s voice breaks on a sigh, a satisfied little grin curling over his lips.
“Sort of. If the subconscious focuses on a pattern, its defences become easier to predict. Let's say…” Steve raises his eyes to the ceiling, trying to come up with a better illustration. “Let’s say I tell you ‘don’t think of white bears’. What’s the first thing that pops into your head?”
“Very nice work.” Steve says to Wanda. They’re both standing on the polished marble steps of a city library.
“That’s too bad, he’d have been a useful source.” Steve mused. “What other relationships can we use? Girlfriends? Boyfriends?”
“Oh, I like this. I’m gonna make you eat those words,” Tony practically cackles at the challenge. “Prepare to be upgraded so hard you won’t even know what happened.”
“Focus, Tony.” Steve had put his phone away and was now looking at him with that fond smile, as if he had heard the thoughts running through his head.
Steve shakes his head. “There isn’t any - the code doesn’t even exist, so the individual numbers don't matter. The whole point is to trick the subconscious into generating a pattern. In this case, a pattern of numbers.”
“Pepper.” The screams would have shaken anyone's composure but a deadly calm settles over Stark, even as his face drains of all color. “I have to get out of here now.”
"There's a Forger I'm acquainted with. Russian. She’s very capable, we’ve worked together a few times," she paused, catching T’Challa's disapproving glance. "I was there purely as a witness, and she handled the whole interrogation very professionally. If we are building a team, she’d be the best person to start with."
“How about my lack of a gag reflex and ability to hold my breath?” Tony replied, unable to resist poking a hole in the moment.
Steve was not a violent man, but in that moment he’d been pissed enough to contemplate wringing the idiotic man by the neck. Still, it’d bought him some small satisfaction to leave a huge hole in the wall of Hammer’s new conference room, if only for the dumbfounded look on Hammer’s weaselly face.
“Creating buildings isn't all I can do - I can move things with my mind.” Wanda looks drained but her eyes are dancing. “It's pure creation… I've never felt anything like it.”
Stark snaps into motion like a tightly wound spring, and a pair of unlocked handcuffs go flying into Steve’s face.
He quickly waved it away before Steve could turn and see that his boxer-clad backside was trending all over the internet. He felt another stab of guilt - Tony didn't mind making a spectacle of himself, but Steve did.
“A good architect needs to be able to design on the fly, creating structures that are convincing enough to fool the mark, while also being tactically sound.” Steve said. “You have two minutes to design a maze that takes me one minute to solve. Go.”
He catches sight of Stark at the end of the hall, facing off head-to-torso against a towering projection. Stark sinks into a defensive stance as the metal creature backs him up against the wall. It raises its weapon to strike and Stark instinctively throws up an arm to shield himself.
Still, it's not easy to restrain the struggling man, and stars flash in his vision when Stark clocks him in the jaw with a lucky punch. Grunting in pain, Steve reinforces his grip on the other man, careful to use his strength only to incapacitate instead of injure.
Tony opens his mouth to say something, but his gaze catches on something behind Steve and his eyes fill with shock.
T'Challa looked to Nakia, who nodded. “How would you like to have your friend back? Five years is a long time to be in a coma.”
Tony makes a circuit of the room, stripping every broken item for parts. He dumps his box of scavenged scraps on the cleanest work table, undoing his tie as he wiggles out of his jacket. The movement tugs down the neckline of his shirt, briefly exposing a mass of raised scars that spiderweb across his chest.
The sight makes him wince internally, and he wonders if they’d pushed Stark a bit too far. If he were truly a narcissist, surely he would have jumped at the chance to throw Pepper under the bus and save his own ass.
He gestures down at the blue combat suit he's wearing. He supposes a newbie like Wanda wouldn’t be able to tell, but the outfit is several years out of date - five, to be exact. “Your physical appearance reverts to a time in your life where you experienced a big change; something like moving house, or a loss, or...”
Scott sprang off the couch to help with the packing, while Wanda and Natasha ran through their notes on building schematics and strategy. By the time Steve and Sam started moving the cases of equipment into the car, it had started to snow lightly.
Tony had only been in the new place for a few weeks when the movers showed up again, lugging with them a battered packing crate.
Captain America’s shield materializes into his hands and he hurls it with all his might. The spinning edge slices off the metal arm at the shoulder joint - distracted, the now one-armed metal creature turns away from Stark just in time to catch a hit to the faceplate.
“That’s…wow. A place where art comes to life, I could do so much...” Wanda’s kohl-lined eyes widened, mind flitting through all the creative possibilities. She paused. “Wait, what was that about forgetting reality? Isn't that dangerous?”
A lone projection patrols the rows of cubicles, regarding Steve with little interest as it trudges out of the office and into the main corridor.
Sam whoops as they merge onto the freeway, diving down to cruise alongside the car. “Nice work, kid!”
Looking up from the sink, Steve’s reflection stared back at him from the cabinet mirror. Natasha had always teased him about having a baby face, but the bright-eyed artist he'd once been seemed to belong to a different life; beneath his shaggy dark blond hair, the beard he'd let grow had spread thickly over his chin and jaw. He tried to avoid looking at his eyes - ever since the Incident they seemed out of place in his face, something aged and strange lurking in the depths.
“You aren't. I’d follow you anywhere, man. Nat, too.” Sam shook his head tiredly. “We're just worried.”
Besides, he was getting ahead of himself. There was no way a lamp as classy as Tony would give him a second glance.
Steve gapes several seconds too long before tearing his eyes away, feeling a burning flush run up his neck. “Can you stop playing with yourself and focus here?”
Nakia laughed and leaned against his shoulder and T'Challa instinctively put his arm around her, drawing her closer. It felt nice, it had been too long since she had laughed like that and it curled a warmth in the pit of his stomach.
Tony glanced at his phone. On the screen were hundreds of missed notifications, not just from Steve, but Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Bruce, and Peter. Oops.
T’Challa’s eyes flashed. “You're asking my sister to cover up a death, never mind it's the death of one of the most prominent businessmen in the world? Are you out of your mind?”
No, that was ridiculous. Steve had grown up starving in the streets, such a overt display of wealth would be offensive to his sensibilities. This called for something more subtle.
“My dad never thought much of community outreach, his loss really. He talked about the future all the time, but he didn’t think about investing in what was really important.” Stark said on their fifth circuit around the quad. He gestured towards Wanda, who was now watching them curiously. “It’s people like her who are going to change the world. Kids, they’re the future.”
“As a matter of fact, I do. Come along, you’re going to want to hear this,” Natasha jerked her chin towards her shiny black sedan. “Remember that month I told you guys I was going to Venice for a holiday? Guess where I went.”
There was a pause. Probably Sam and Natasha sharing another ‘we are worried about Steve’ look, Steve thought peevishly. They’d tried, over the years, to be understanding but it was frustrating being handled with kid-gloves all the time. As if he was a time bomb about to go off.
“There’s something different about you. It’s fascinating, I can’t stop watching you...” Steve sighed, rocking on his legs sadly. “I wish there was a way we could touch.”
It would involve blowing his bulb. Tony flickered nervously, remembering what his Owner had said before about possibly throwing him out.
Stark’s face twitches at the contact but he doesn't flinch from Stane’s invasion into his personal space. It has the intended effect; he drops the matter, face going subdued and closed-off.
At a cursory glance, it appears to be a perfect replica of the city. On closer inspection, buildings from every culture and country, new and old, are scattered amid the endless rows of skyscrapers; scarlet torii gates, Gothic cathedrals, domes studded by solar panels and terraces walled with lush greenery.
Apparently that was enough to get Stark talking again, because he fired off another stream of words. Despite his unkempt appearance he spoke animatedly, as if trying to cover up his earlier dejection. Every sentence branched off into a random tangent - of flight systems, the benefits of chlorophyll, robots he had designed, the best burger place in the college town. Stark didn’t comment on how Steve knew his name, probably assuming him to be just another fan. He didn’t ask Steve’s name in return, which was a relief.
Steve’s smile turned impish. “That too, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.” And then he was leaning in so that their foreheads were pressed together, with his breath whispering against Tony’s lips. “You don't need to try so hard to impress me. Everything about you already takes my breath away. ”
way to privatize world peace.” Tony’s voice rings with the zeal of a believer and it sounds like he sincerely
“Do you ever stop talking?” Steve snaps, feeling the return of his migraine. This mission was turning into one headache after another; dealing with an uncooperative target on one hand, and the constant threat of death via nonexistence on the other.
"Good idea. World's been through the wringer. Ostentatious displays of wealth, probably not the best look.” Tony nodded, mentally scratching off his fantasies of marrying Steve on a private island with a 100-piece orchestra in attendance, as flocks of doves were released to fly across the dramatic sunset. Yeah, he was a little disappointed he wouldn't get to throw the big fancy wedding he’d always dreamed of - Tony wanted to
“How else would I keep you on your toes?” Natasha stepped over to hug Steve as well. “I heard you had some trouble with Hammer.”
“Steve, we would've respected your decision whether you accepted this job or turned it down.” Natasha put a hand on his arm. He turned, looking down into her surprisingly open face. “You’re our team leader, yes, but more importantly, you’re our friend." Her hand squeezed his. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
In the distance, the silhouette of a man was stumbling across the quad. He lurched like he was about to fall, but at the last second caught himself against a tree. With one hand against the trunk, his head hung low over his chest, body hunched in on itself like he was about to throw up or pass out.
“It ages you,” Wanda tries to hide a smile but it bursts from her in a giggle, her mood seemingly lifted by the shining surroundings. “And you behave like such an old man that I keep forgetting you're only, what, five, six years older than me?”
“We use a countdown song to keep track of time, so the team can synchronize their exit from the dream.” Steve explained.
“You're welcome, by the way.” Steve mutters. “My name’s Steve, so maybe you can stop with the nicknames.”
And it's a feeling Steve understands all too well. He'd always hated being dependent on someone else - the patronizing way people behaved when he was fourteen and skinny and asthmatic. It had only gotten worse when “orphan” became yet another labels to describe his life. Always being underestimated and pitied, treated like he was some helpless thing in need of saving.
"Let's keep things simple. Just a small ceremony at the church with our friends, nothing fancy." said Steve as they disembarked the Quinjet after yet another successful mission. His arm was wrapped around Tony’s shoulders, keeping him close, and the mood in the air was of lazy camaraderie.
But Tony beams. His eyes crinkle up at the corners in a smile that makes him seem much younger. “It's perfect! More than I need.”
First by a pack of three, then five, then eight… each wave of enemies keeps getting bigger than the last. With a concentrated effort, Steve can take down two or three units at a time, but once the projections started coming in groups of thirteen or more…
“I thought the punishment came after the crime. Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocents die.” Steve hands Tony a screwdriver but is waved off.
“He dated a whole string of supermodels and actresses over the years, but nothing ever serious.” Natasha had compiled a huge collection of tabloid covers and paparazzi photos of Stark out with a model or pop star. Stark didn't have a type other than young and pretty...he did seem partial to blondes, though.
“Since when was this a competition?” Steve embeds the shield into a robot’s chestplate, then kicks it over the balcony.
“It was the first thing I could come up with,” Steve answers, miffed. He always tried to avoid creating structures and tools within dreams, but the shock of seeing Stark in danger had pushed him to react by instinct - and as it turned out, his first instinct had been to summon a shield.
Tony fluttered his eyes mock-seductively. “Why, Captain, I thought you said we were on the clock, but if you insist- oh.” Instead of going for his pants, Steve looped the bow tie around his neck and began tying it for him.
They make it down those ten floors relatively unharmed, suffering no worse than a tear in the side of his suit (Steve), and slightly burned fingers (Tony).
There was one night when Owner was celebrating some momentous occasion, because not only was the lacy tablecloth brought out, but so were the
She whipped out an X-ray printout and waved it in front of their astonished faces. “There’s foreign shrapnel in the chest cavity - looks like he’s had it there for years - and it’s leeching poison into his bloodstream.”
“It's my job to notice these things,” Natasha regards him skeptically. “And if you don’t want to tell me why, fine… I just want to know if this is going to give us trouble later on.”
“Christ, Steve, you’re not that old,” Sam leaned his chair back on the rear legs. “And that’s so typical of you - of course you'd stand up for the little guys and starving artists…”
Wanda’s phone wallpaper was a photo of her laughing with an arm wrapped around a young man. She looked younger in the image - her hair was wavy and honey blonde while his was an eye-searing shade of silver.
Inception. The word was a horrible reminder. Of how the awful thoughts had eaten at Bucky’s mind until the words were the only thing left.
A bitter laugh bursts from Stark’s lips. “What good did all that greatness do Mom? She wasn’t even supposed to be in the car that day,” He squeezes his eyes shut. “She only went along because she was worried about him, as usual. Selfish bastard…”
It’s the third sign that fills him with with gut-churning dread. The apprehension that prickles under his skin every time he closes his eyes to sleep, wondering if this time,
“Barely saw ‘em because I couldn't even open my bedroom door.” Steve said dryly. At this proximity Tony noticed there were indeed a few stray rose petals clinging to Steve’s shoulders. “I had to climb out the window and scale the side of the building before I could get dressed.”
"No, if we're going to tamper with this man's mind it should be through people from his own country." T’Challa said, joining her on the bed. "Besides, there’s no way I’d feel comfortable with Shuri running around inside a mind like Stark’s."
“I’m mass-produced, there are a million more in the warehouse just like me,” Tony said darkly. “I'm just another flash in the pan. Next year there'll be a new gimmicky lamp.”
One day, Owner and Owner’s Companion came home in a strange mood. By the looks of it, they were planning on doing some assembly of their own.
“There.” Wanda points to something shining in the distance: a slender bridge which curves over the river. Delicate tendrils of steel twine above and around the roadway, encasing it in a spiralling double helix pattern. “That’s our way out of the city. We should-”
“Like I said, make me.” Stark raises his chin, eyebrow arched challengingly. “Normally, it’s a lot more fun than this when a stacked blond pushes me around and tells me what to do. Though since you’re already inside my mind, I’ll give you points for making the penetration relatively painless…”
“Is that your sick idea of leverage?” Stark glares him down unflinchingly, every muscle in his body screaming defiance. “Because if you've hurt Pepper I swear I can make your life look a whole lot worse than that ugly mug of yours…”
Judging by the modern decor of his new home, a lot of time had passed since he’d been put into storage. Steve never knew televisions could be so thin, or so many things were powered by electricity.
Steve smiled. “No, it was actually quite lovely. They played some tunes I hadn't heard in a while. I enjoyed their arrangement of
Silver-haired and handsome, with a proprietary arm around his wife, Howard Stark was the very picture of the moneyed industrialist. The old man knew how to command presence about him, and Steve could see the inklings of it in the younger Tony’s face. But that was where the physical resemblance ended, because where Howard’s eyes were cold and shrewd, Tony had inherited his mother’s expressive brown doe eyes.
“You don’t need to explain,” Picking up the tool, Tony rearranges his face into conciliatory expression. “We've all got scars.”
Well. As long as he doesn’t completely blow his cover, there’s no harm offering up some truth. You have to lose some to gain some.
The man turned towards his voice and Steve realized with a shock that he was staring into the face of a bedraggled Tony Stark.
I was thinking about splitting this into 2 chapters but decided nah I'd better get to the point. Dream stuff happens in the next chapter!
“And now you're deflecting.” Natasha shakes her head. “Fine, don't want to talk about your repressed…”
So that’s how it’s going to be. Choosing to ignore Stark’s bitching, Steve slides a notepad and pen across the table. “I’m going to need a five-digit PIN from you. Give me the code and I’ll get you out of here.”
The show of force was truly impressive - he’d never seen such a well-equipped task force on any other mission.
Steve clinked his coffee mug against Natasha’s espresso cup and Sam's glass of orange juice. "Here’s to success."
“The prototype he showed at the demonstration was nearly complete. ULTRON could launch as early as the next quarter.” The thought of that monstrous technology unleashed on the world made him feel sick.
“It’s gonna be alright. Do you have someone that I can call?” Steve tried to sound placating, feeling more and more unequipped to handle the situation. Stark had mentioned he was here for an event, so maybe that meant he had a bodyguard or two around.
“Is everyone pissed at me?” Tony asked sheepishly as he belted his pants and put his socks up, waves of guilt  already bubbling up from inside him. He hadn't even stepped outside yet and he was already screwing today up. Who missed their own wedding?
T’Challa quickly took his leave, slipping away from the cheering masses. If there was to be any chance of averting that terrible future, he had to move fast.
“…stunted set of emotional baggage? Then answer me this,” Natasha smacks his hands away from the PASIV and slams the case shut. “You've been acting off ever since we took this job.”
Of course everyone was. He’d been alone with his mistakes for years just like whatever demons Stark had in his own head…
Stark still looks on edge, casting glances at the shield as if he's afraid Steve is going to brain him with it next. The realisation makes Steve quickly lower the shield and stow it on his back harness.
6. I just got my IW tickets for the 25th! I'm going to take a few weeks' break to see how the new canon shakes down, though I highly doubt anything in the film will change my original outline for this fic. In the meantime I will continue editing the next couple chapters.  See you guys then!
“We can go treasure hunting tomorrow.” Tony began to roll towards Steve, but his gaze was caught by the flickering light once more and he scowled. “That lamp gives me the heebie-jeebies. Tomorrow I’m going to repair the hell out of it.” Tony grumpily rubbed at the burned spot on the back of his neck. “Pretty sure your lamp hates me.”
all day, every day: brighten up rooms, prevent people from tripping over things in the dark, and - since Tony was no ordinary lamp, he was a
“Just put that down there, I don't like being handed things. And to address your concerns-” Tony turns to him, eyes blazing with that same passion. “It’s an imperfect world, but it’s the only one we got. Trust me, this is the best way, the
He concentrated on pulling as much power as he could from his plug. He didn’t care what his lumen rating said, Tony was always one for pushing the boundaries.
“Busan, Korea. I interrogated a black market arms dealer for a Wakandan client. I know, I have an interesting life,” Nat flashed them a smile through the rearview mirror. “She contacted me recently, asking me to put together a team for her. Naturally, I gave a plug for you guys."
Steve splashed water on his face in Sam’s bathroom. T’Challa’s words were still running through his head. The king's promise both intrigued and unsettled him. He’d been searching for a cure for so long, but now… he wondered if the price was too high.
“Is that what this is? An intervention?” Steve scraped bits of solidifying egg off the edges of the pan. “Because if you're worried I’m going to do something reckless...”
“What should we do, Steve?” Sam stepped up to him, voice low and carefully even. “Team’s waiting on you.”
It was supposed to be a simple job: extract technical plans from the CEO of Hammer’s competitor. Standard bit of corporate espionage. Steve and Sam had spent the last month and a half planning the op to ensure it went off without a hitch, just like they’d done countless times before.
“You want to be my big strong rescuer against the big bad machines?” Leaning against the wall, Tony snickers openly. “Jesus, I've had fantasies before, but to have them play out this literally? There must be so much Freudian stuff swimming around in my brain that I-”
“ENOUGH!” Everyone’s attention immediately snaps to Steve. “Losing our heads isn't gonna help anyone. There’s no other way through this but forward.”
“If we’re stuck inside a dying body…” Scott’s face is pale beneath his stubble. “That means our own minds could be lost in a dimension wh-where time and space become irrelevant. We could wind up in Limbo...or worse.”
Wanda’s eyes lit up at the challenge and quickly flipped open her sketchbook to a fresh page. Her enthusiasm had him feeling nostalgic; he remembered what it was like to be eager to show off his skill, so full of ideas that they were bursting out of him.
Rejecting the prospect of going back to sleep, Steve padded into the kitchen to fix a coffee. Caffeine had long stopped affecting him; an unsynchronised body clock was one of the long-term effects of being a dream walker. The mug was warm in his hands and the bitter aroma grounded him.
Beneath the mask, Steve’s cheeks burn with frustration - they hadn’t expected Stark to be this stubborn; most people would have given in immediately at the sight of the gun, not make the leap to taunting and bargaining. Time to try a different tactic.
They were on their second circuit of the quad when Steve decided to put an end to the awkward silence.
“The architect creates the world of the dream; buildings, landscapes, whatever you can think up.” Steve said. Of course, the world of the dream was only as expansive as the architect’s imagination: a competent designer could create mazes that would take hours to solve, a skilled one - days. Anyone who could design a maze that took months - years - to break through was on another level.
“You can’t move past anything until you face it.” Sam turned his mug around in his hands. “Ignoring stuff isn't gonna help you.”
The seconds slow to a crawl and he can feel Tony start to tense up in his grip. Tony’s expression turns inward, a tremble running through his jaw, like he's rapidly reevaluating Steve as a threat.
Tony made a sound like a balloon running out of air. “That’s not fair, you can’t just come into my workshop, kiss me like that, then say we have to stand in front of our friends for four hours without even touching each other.”
, rising into the air like a strand of melted taffy, lifting them high into the air. Scott squawks in alarm to see the ground suddenly fall away.
“Says the man carrying around a giant frisbee,” Tony says dryly, as if he could hear Steve’s mental list of unflattering options. “I repurposed the power core into a repulsor cannon. Wait till you see what this baby can do.”
"It’s settled then," T’Challa said. "Assemble your team, Captain Rogers, and choose your people wisely."
“Don't burst.” Steve ordered sternly. He had keep things under control before both their feelings ran away with them.
“Is everything a joke to you?” Unprepared for the barrage of innuendos, Steve’s whole face feels like it’s on fire. “Because this isn’t the time nor place.”
Steve turned around slowly to face the king. His hand was clenched on the door jamb so hard it was a hair away from splintering.
“It's not that simple,” Sam shook his head. “True inspiration is impossible to create. Besides, there are too many variables at play - you never know what kind of spin a subconscious will put on the idea. The outcome is never a sure thing.”
“Come on, don’t hurt her! Take me instead,” Stark’s begging now, struggling at his bonds so fiercely Steve’s afraid he'll slice his arm open or dislocate a shoulder. “I'll do anything. Please... “
“The team’s with me in the West Tower. Heading to the rendezvous point in the North Tower,” Sam replies.
), with what looks like a small cannon embedded in the palm. “This should hold off those metal goons.”
“Tell you what,” Steve answers, feeling a sudden spark of playfulness. “Beat me in this little competition and I'll gladly use whatever gizmo you cook up.”
"Just giving everyone some background context. I spent my time at SI learning digging up the real dirt.” Natasha swiped at her tablet, bringing up second round of images.
As luck would have it, they find a maintenance room tucked away at the end of a hall. The stuffy little room barely counts as a storage closet and it's a mess inside; piled high with broken appliances, old AC units, half assembled computer terminals, with a few battered tools scattered over a workbench.
“It gets worse. During a tech convention a few months back, Tony held a private presentation for government officials where he unveiled a new artificial intelligence system, ULTRON. From all the tech reports I combed through, it’s set to go live as early as next year.” Natasha acknowledged T’Challa with a nod. “I can see why you want to shut him down so quickly. Threat analysis, DNA tracking… this is some scary Skynet stuff."
Bucky had always been better with people than Steve, that was what made him so good at extracting information. But both of them shared an appreciation of architecture and the unlimited possibilities offered by the dream world.
“I look at you say that and I almost believe you.” Stark didn't bother brushing off his hands, peering up at Steve with slow tired blinks. “Isn't that what my life has been? A big fat waste and it fucking sucks.”
He only wished he knew what to say. Every time he tried to get his courage to talk to Tony, nervousness would cause him to table the decision for later.
He couldn't convince Bucky. In desperation, Steve turned to the one thing he know how to do, and planted one simple thought in Bucky's head.
Candles! Those things were basically naked baby lightbulbs, the flames dancing like tiny stars at the ends of sculpted ivory wax.
Sometimes his friends were the worst. Steve frowned at Sam and Natasha, trying to suppress an internal squirm. They knew him too well. Any other time he would have (grudging) appreciated the concern, but T’Challa and Nakia seemed a bit too interested in their not-conversation, and Wanda and Scott were starting to give them weird looks.
“Sure did. But I wasn’t expecting to see... animal wranglers waiting around to release a flock of bald eagles, the New York Philharmonic, and Sam chatting with the fire marshals about his last-minute plans to incorporate Falcon into the fireworks show. I take it you're responsible for all these surprises.” A small frown creased Steve’s face. “Tony, I told you I didn't need all this stuff.”
They were pulling into the hospital when Steve realized that in their haste to leave, he'd left the watch behind. Too late. Another of those things that couldn't be helped.
Tony blinked blearily at the late morning sunlight streaming through the windows, wondering why the sun had chosen to rise early, and why he was hearing his thoughts out loud. Normally the auditory hallucinations didn't start till he’d been awake past the 60-hour mark. And then he realised the voice had come from behind him.
Steve coughs awkwardly “If you're quite done,” he re-seats himself at the table. “We need to return to the task at-”
There was a glass-walled conference room in the center of the office. And inside, slumped over the table, both hands cuffed to a bolt in the floor, was Stark.
Stark’s eyes widen in horror and all aggression bleeds out of him like sand from an hourglass. “Leave her out of this.”
“They took all my belongings,” Stane says unhelpfully, but Steve catches Natasha quickly palming her tie clip.
“Mhm. Sounds like you had a lot going for you. But I'm sensing some tension in the use of past tense. What happened?”
“My balls.” Tony swished his pull-strands so that the balls at the end clacked together. Yes, he was growing warmer at the thought. “Let me touch you. Steve, please. I’ve wanted it so long, I’m so hot for you…”
Tony doesn't buy it, twirling a screwdriver in his clever fingers. “Yeah, the silent thing isn’t gonna fly. Now that we’re working together there’s gotta be some quid pro quo.” Tony winks at him, adjusting the gauntlet’s circuitry. “So lay it on me, Steve-my-unfairly-good-looking-imaginary-friend.”
“I taught them all the things they needed to know, and my life story isn’t one of them.” Steve said.
“...can’t understand why anybody would design something so clunky and stick a huge glowing target in the center of the chest. Anyhow,” Satisfied with his salvage efforts, Tony pockets the core and stands up. “Is this the part you tell me to come with you if I want to live?”
“That’s already way too much contact. Christ, Steve, why not give him your number and keys as well?” Natasha’s face shifts from mildly annoyed to extremely annoyed. “You should’ve brought this up before! Now the entire mission might be compromised.”
He supposes he should. Out of all of them, Natasha is probably the only one who understands the best how it’s like to lose yourself in a mask.
"Oh… I'm sure nothing like that happened.” Over Steve’s shoulder, Tony could see FRIDAY pulling up the Daily Buglefeed’s latest clickbait article ‘
The show was finding its second wave of popularity among the hipsters, and Steve sometimes did a double take when he heard it blaring from someone’s phone, suddenly unsure of the reality around him.
Steve is moving before Tony can take three steps. “We are not splitting up.” He seizes Tony by the arm and spins him around.
“Too much?” Tony flickered, withdrawing his string and closing his shell slightly. “Sorry, I know it's a little much on the eyes…”
“Feel better?” Steve’s hands were gently playing with the small curls at the back of his neck, and the feeling made him want to purr and revel in the sensation for hours.
“Hah. We all need help. There are probably at least three, six medications I should be on, I dunno, but nope, can’t afford hurt the share price after the last time…” Stark didn’t seem to hear him, rambling on about drones, table condiments (pepper?), and some person called Stain.
“That's a huge exaggeration, it was only one tiny brawl. Hardly what you'd call a ‘trashing’, no matter how you slice it.” Natasha blew a stray strand of red hair out of her eyes. “The fire was definitely an accident though.”
“I just gave a full ride to this year’s class.” Stark carried on. “Bright kids, all of them. I mean, give people a little faith and they’ll make you proud…”
Surrounded by his team members, he could catch every emotion that flashed across their faces - determination, watchfulness, fear - and that was what snapped the actuality of the situation into dizzyingly sharp focus.
The first two signs had always caused significant inconvenience to his teammates, but with quick thinking and teamwork, they were manageable for the most part.
Tony huffs a sigh and looks up, down, everywhere but at Steve. His face looks pinched, nervous, like danger of the situation is finally sinking in for him. Steve supposes that's understandable; being told they were trapped in a dream would be enough to rattle anyone.
Steve aims the gun at Stark. He had no intention of shooting, of course, but Stark didn’t need to know that. “You have ten seconds to give us the code.”
“Tony, nothing you do could ever ruin today for me. You’re the one thing that makes it all special.”
Tony’s spherical body was comprised of smooth white plates loosely fitted together, cupping his bulb like petals of a flower. From where Steve was positioned, he could catch tantalizing glimpses of his inner walls: rose gold and glinting with a metallic sheen. When the power was off during the day, Tony looked sculptural and elegant. But at night, Tony’s power was switched on, and that was a different story: illuminated from within, his golden heart limned geometric patterns all over his body, like the sigils of a magical artefact.
It should have been hard to look kingly while holding a half-eaten bowl of cereal, but T'Challa managed it somehow. “I have been trained in combat and possess a basic understanding of dream physics, so you won't have to worry about me slowing you down.”
Steve stood “Then it looks like we've got everything covered,” He looked up at the last picture on the slideshow. The photo had been taken at an airbase - snapped mid-pose when Stark was halfway down the stairs of a plane, one hand resting on the guardrail. His face was frozen in a smirk, eyes hidden behind sunglasses. “Best of luck to us.”
“You all need disguises.” Natasha shrugs dismissively. “None of you can alter your faces, so this'll have to do.”
Stark lowers his arm and eyes Steve warily. “Want to explain why there are terminator things walking around?”
Stark was cold...so? Why should that matter? It wasn't any of Steve's business. The fact that he had spent this long talking to Stark went against every protocol of dream walking. It was a bad idea to have too much contact with a target - any residual memories could affect the construction of the dream. The proper, by-the-book, thing to do would be to focus on the mission and just let Stark go.
“...ULTRON will be a suit of armor around the world.” Stark ended his presentation with a grin, jauntily accepting the room’s wild applause as his due.
“That’s what I’ve been saying from the start.” Steve says, a little grumpily. “Call me what you want,”
“I wouldn’t want to be alone.” Steve said, feeling like the biggest hypocrite in the world and desperately hoping he wasn’t giving the wrong answer. They were getting into dangerous territory again, and with Stark in such a vulnerable mental state, there was no telling what could set him off. “I’d want a friend…”
"Address him as your highness." Nakia cracked a smile at him. "Don’t worry, we don’t insist on all the formalities. Just treat this like you would any business meeting."
Steve’s broad frame filled out the shoulders of his suit so perfectly that Tony was two brain cells away from drooling all over himself. Everything about Steve’s appearance, from the quarter inch of crisp white shirt at his wrists to the way his jacket accentuated that trim waist, to the fine fabric hugging that perfect ass - god, Tony could write odes to that ass, get on his knees and worship it all day long-
Scott twists over his shoulder, a harried look on his face. “Guys, you might not want to celebrate just yet.”
“Perhaps you shouldn't blow things up when we're in the same room.” Steve’s words are ignored as Tony dives back into tinkering.
Natasha’s smirk fades. “Wanda feels bad, you know. She thinks the train showed up because she botched the design of the city.”
Tony wasn’t just horrified, he was furious. How dare the humans start assembling each other on top of HIS STEVE.
Steve chases after him, cursing his inattentiveness all the way. Stark must have been picking his handcuffs under the table the entire time, using his mouthiness as a distraction - and like a fool, Steve had fallen for it. If they weren't so pressed for time, Steve would be more amazed at the speed of his escape, and that he'd managed it with a
Stark is pressed against the pipe, hanging limply from the cuffs as his breaths pant in and out shallowly. With his half-closed eyes showing only a slice of white, he looks on the verge of passing out.
Wanda blinks, then gives him a terse nod. “Thank you.” She stares determinedly at her feet but Steve can catch a flash of brightness in her eyes.
“I wasn't thinking about the mission! I was- I was more worried that he'd do something to himself...” It was too reminiscent of what had happened with Bucky. “I couldn’t leave another pers- I couldn't just leave him like that.”
The moment starts to sink in as Steve realises he’s pinning the other man with his whole body: their faces are barely a foot apart with how chests are crushed together and he can feel Tony’s pulse jumping under his palms… not to mention how his leg is wedged between Tony’s thighs.
There was a long silence. Sam remained frowning, while Natasha’s eyes filled with fierce determination.
“You mean if I wanted to be in the Louvre, I could create it myself instantly instead of flying to Europe?”
Steve found him utterly fascinating. He had never known lamps could look so elegant, or have so many moving parts, certainly far more than Steve could shake any of his legs at.
“There's nothing to debate. I have to do this,” Steve tightened his grip on the spatula. “I owe him that much.”
“I thought this was the best way to show you how much I care about you. But I can see I went about it completely the wrong way…” Tony went on, feeling like he was just digging himself deeper, “I just wanted this day to be special for you, but I guess I really blew it. You know me, always charging ahead with things without checking if people actually want them. So… I'm sorry for ruining everything.” Tony ended in a small voice, addressing his words to Steve’s chin.
4. So in Inception (2010), the train is a manifestation of Cobb's guilt over the death of Mal, which is interesting considering how trains factor in to the MCU relationship between Steve and Bucky.
His life Before had been normal. Most of it it good, but even the bad parts had been things he could comprehend. Work, friends,
“Boss!” A Rolls Royce pulled up to the other end of the quad. A tall, wide-set man in a suit got out and began hurrying towards them.
“Just wait till you see my new bag of tricks. I’ve picked up a few things since I left you guys. ” Natasha stands up - towering slightly over Steve, Stane is a
“Doesn’t everyone?” Caught off guard, Steve fumbled around for an answer. “There are people I wished I’d spent more time with, things I wanted to learn…”
It was painfully ironic: all his working time was spent in dreams hunting down other people's secrets. When he slept, his own nightmares pursued him.
"Few were trusted with that information.” T’Challa looked satisfied. "Very impressive work, Ms Romanoff."
“Say, you're a very good listener, you've got me spilling my guts over here while you haven’t said a single thing about yourself.” Hands buried in his work, Tony inclines his head towards Steve. “How did a place like this end up in a guy like you?”
“He’s not my friend.” Wanda shoved her phone into a pocket with a surly glare. “You said something about an internship?”
A panicky Scott squeaks. “It's a dead end! That train took out the whole block. Oh god this is bad, we are so dead...”
“That doesn’t seem very secure. Are you sure you won’t fall from there?” Steve made a stolid attempt to ignore the flirtatious display.
Steve eyes it all dubiously. He'd seen junkyards with more life in them. “You sure about this? It's garbage.”
, I'll stop hassling you.” Tony’s smirk fades and an inquisitive look steals over his face. “Come to think of it, you
Oh. This was what Natasha meant when she said that being recognized could throw a wrench in their plans.
The look Natasha gives him is equal parts exasperated and pitying. “I don’t think he’s the kind of guy you save, he's the kind you stop. You saw my report: Stark’s a textbook case of narcissism.”
“We’ve been here for days… I don't know how much longer we can hold out...” Stane groans theatrically.
“I'm in the South Tower with the target,” Steve taps at his communicator. “What's your status, Sam?” He visualizes Wanda’s layout of the sprawling office complex: four towers, one for each compass point, laid out in a diamond and each connected via a sky bridge. Exactly as they’d discussed.
Steve feels pang of shame. “Look, can we try this again?” he spreads his hands, attempting to clear the air. “We got off on the wrong foot- clearly. Can we figure out a way to work together?”
Steve’s jaw clenched at the mention of his old rank. “It's one thing to steal an idea from someone's mind, but to plant one there?” He gestured at the video of Stark. “You don't know what the inception could do to this man, how it could change everything about him as a person. Whatever idea we plant could grow to define who he is. You're asking me essentially to...to...”
Darkness blankets everything, as if every light in the building were blown out. But that can't be right; all the windows were open to let in the sunlight, and he should at least hear the sigh of the air or dripping of a distant pipe…
“Guys, are you ok?” Sam voice crackles through the comm. He must be frantic, circling above them unable to help. “Can't see a thing through this smog. God, this train has to be at least fifty feet high…”
He thought of Stark, brown eyes broken and pleading. Thought of Bucky, After, crooked grin never quite reaching his eyes.
Wanda was a sophomore with a penchant for red leather jackets and black nail polish. Her entire style - from the pin-straight dark brown hair and heavily lined eyes which pinned him with a frosty gaze - screamed punk rock vampire.
The doctors managed to pull Bucky back from the brink. But they couldn't save his arm, frostbitten beyond repair from the plunge into the river.
Sometimes Tony couldn’t even believe Steve loved him back. The gentle pressure at his throat as Steve worked on the bow tie, and those intent blue eyes… It was intoxicating being this close to Steve.
“Spare me the Hallmark speech,” Stark cut in. “You never answered my question: If you had only one more birthday left, how would you want to spend it?”
Stark’s face twitched, and he leaned over to place the wallet on the seat beside Steve. After a short hesitation, he unfastened his wristwatch too, carelessly clapping down what must have been a fifty thousand-dollar watch on the grimy wooden bench. Stark turned away, jerkily stuffing his hands back into his pockets.
He sat up and ran a hand through sweat-soaked hair, willing the traces of the nightmare to fade. Taking deep gulps of oxygen, his racing heart started to return to its normal speed.
Inception. The word opened up a pit of dread in his stomach. Sam’s initial assessment was right: this job was much too risky. Too many things that could go wrong in a mission as complicated as this. And that was assuming T’Challa would and even
And now they were back to square one. What was it about the man that made him repeatedly lose his temper?
It was that realization that made him claw his way through the fog of inertia; his memories of the real world came back to him in flashes, like watching sunlight from the bottom of the ocean. One thing had become exceedingly clear; they couldn't stay there any longer or they'd drown in madness together. Limbo wasn't real. It wasn't and couldn't ever be.
“Fuck the ice. Let’s continue this in the bedroom. Remind me to take a look at that fucking disco ball you call a lamp to see if I can’t do anything to fix it...” Owner’s Companion snapped impatiently and began tugging Owner towards the door.
He’d been proud of himself for keeping a level head in the weeks leading up to the wedding, but now that he was just twelve hours away from the ceremony, doubts had started to trickle in, and now he wasn’t sure a quiet little ceremony would be enough to convey the
mistake. He could still hear the crunch of snow as Bucky had walked away that day, walked straight to the bridge in the dead of winter where he had…
“This is what I've prepared for each layer of the dream.” Wanda took over the screen. Her design concepts flashed on screen, showing floor plans, 3D renderings. Mazes. “Lots of places to hide, easy to defend against any violent projections.”
“Change of plans. Stark just collapsed, they’re headed to the hospital as we speak.” Sam informed him, doing a final round of checks on the PASIV. “Once we get there, it’s showtime.”
“If the world were less scummy, you boys would be out of a job.” Natasha fell into step beside them.
“Not to me. Tony you’re the literal the light of my life.” Steve answered. The timbre of his words was sincere.
As he took stock of his surroundings, Steve identified his new location as a living room. The source of the dazzling light was a lamp suspended above him.
They fall into a pattern: Steve plunging into the melee, taking on the brunt of attacks with Tony providing cover fire from a distance, preventing the stragglers from swarming Steve.
Steve gripped the cool porcelain edge of the sink, fighting down the wave of hopelessness. No, T’Challa had been right about him; Steve would have willingly given up anything if it meant finding a cure. Not that he had much left to give; his career as an Architect was a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, although in his weaker moments he missed the days when his biggest worries had been a missed deadline or two.
“That's quite the entourage,” Sam commented as they rode the elevator up. “Who exactly do you work for?”
Natasha paused, considering. “Imagine if Santa Claus had a baby with Emperor Palpatine. Creepy.” For Natasha - who dealt with creeps on a daily basis - to consider Stane creepy spoke volumes about his character. “There’s a whole dirty story there, not even counting the deals he’s cut under the table.”
A distant explosion tears shatters the stillness, the sound of something heavy slamming through concrete and glass.
A fresh round of gunfire assaults their bullet-riddled van as a fleet of gunmetal-grey armoured vehicles begin to approach. No amount of veering and dodging can shake them and slowly, relentlessly, the projections narrow the distance. A spray of bullets zing through the back window, shredding the back row of the seats.
Natasha goes very still. “Do I tell you how to do your job?” Her voice is pleasantly conversational.
Tony strained to reach Steve but his anchorings kept him bound to the ceiling. He swung anxiously. This was unacceptable, he couldn't just hang here while Steve was violated below him
“I'm looking forward it,” Steve looked down at him, lips curling into one of those blindingly sweet smiles, the ones that made every thought go straight out of Tony’s head, reducing him to a state of dopey contentment. Tony was vaguely aware of the other Avengers vacating the landing pad with disgusted groans, but who cared what they thought, anyway?
“In 2008 Tony was kidnapped in Afghanistan during a business conference. Yeah, I was surprised too, their PR worked hard to keep it out of the news.” Nat went on. “He was held by a terrorist group for nearly three months until Stane quietly paid the ransom. At the end of that year, SI applied for a record number of patents - more than triple previous years.”
“I can’t tell from here. Just get ready to call for help in case he gets violent.” Steve cautiously made his way over to the man. Propped up against the tree, the stranger was breathing heavily and was clutching at the chest of his fine, though extremely rumpled suit.
With Scott joining the growing club of people crashing on Sam’s couch and Wanda coming over to work on designs every second she wasn’t in class, Sam’s home was the liveliest it had been in a long time. (“Dammit, guys, my house is not your personal B&B. Clean up your shit!”). The living room table looked like a hurricane had hit it - strewn with architectural drawings and sheets of chemical calculations.
Stark picks up the pen and darts a quick look up through his lashes. Several emotions flit through his eyes; bewilderment, irritation, and something else Steve can’t identify. Stark twirls the pen around deftly in his fingers, then snaps it clean in half.
The golden light had been the first thing Steve became aware of. At first he thought it was the sun, so rich and warm it was. But there was something different about the light: while it lacked the all-encompassing intensity of the sun, the mild radiance was beautiful.
...If only he’d stop criticizing Steve’s choice of weaponry. As Tony’s kill count increased, so had the offers to upgrade his gear. Well, that and the cockiness.
