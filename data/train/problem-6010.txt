So Tony decided to get away from the Tower for a bit (he wasn't hiding from Natasha, he
“It’s beautiful,” he said, staring at the city below. He could also see the two of them, each with a glass in hand, reflected in the glass. It would make for a beautiful painting.
It was just so typical of Iron Man, to hack into their lives and then pretend that it was friendship. Steve understood the fear of secrets, but they worked together many times by now, so even if they didn’t like each other all that much, trust was something he thought they had, at least a little. Steve knew that he
“I’m sending her the rest of the Mandarin’s locations. With a message about a mole in her ranks.”
“You got knocked on the head?” Clint asked. Tony just sent him a glare.
Tony leaned in. "Good," he whispered.
“Okay,” Tony said slowly. “And why am I here?”
For future references, Tony will blame the tears in his eyes on the chest pain. “Thanks, Steve. It means a lot.” Tony wondered for a brief second what Howard would have thought, Captain America being proud of Tony, when he was the one who always said Tony was nowhere near as good or as worthwhile as the super soldier.
Steve’s mouth opened on a gasp, like the words were the last thing he expected to hear. “You do?” he asked, breathless.
“I know, but I guess Howard never really got over your disappearance. You were... a perfect success, and I guess Tony... at least to Howard... wasn't.”
He was given a clean bill of health (well, Bruce recommended rest because of his slight head injury but it wasn't like Tony was going to listen to him) and by the time they all got back to the Tower, Tony was ready to forget the accident had ever happened.
Second thing he noticed was that there was something warm and heavy in his hand. When he brought his other hand to rub at his eyes he peeked around the room and was grateful to not find it fully lit. There was only a soft glow but it still took Tony a while to fully open his eyes.
“Sorry, I forgot I didn’t introduce you to JARVIS yet.”
Tony nodded. Last night was a maze of confusion but he remembered every word Steve said to him like it was branded on his brain.
' and really, Tony was pissed.
“Okay, then,” Tony said quietly, then mirrored Steve’s position by laying his head on the back of the couch. Steve was distracted momentarily by Tony’s eyes looking directly at him.
The cave smelled like the one in Afghanistan. It wasn't really a scent as more of a feeling, being trapped, the walls damp, air suffocating.
Peggy was silent for a long moment. She was the one who had encouraged Steve to pursue this relationship the most, and while everyone had been worried, she was nothing but supportive and happy for him. She wanted to believe Tony was innocent. For Steve’s sake.
Steve had never seen Tony look so furious. He was always so calm and collected. It was a part of him almost, how he could stare down any situation with an almost bored look on his face. But not this time. He was angry, and he was scared. Scared for Steve.
Natasha turned to look at Steve. “Hammer hasn’t been seen in a few weeks, but once he shows up, SHIELD will be there, waiting for him. In the meantime, the biggest lead we have is Tony Stark.”
“Did he say something else?” Steve asked.
So when JARVIS spoke up after hours of silence, Tony was startled, “Sir? Mr. Rogers is looking for you.”
(and thank you, Howard, for still influencing his decisions, twenty years after his death).
“Because,” Tony said meaningfully. “If I couldn’t find the Mandarin…”
After a couple of minutes (but what seemed like hours to Tony) Steve gave a big sigh and left.
Tony continued. “And by the way, I still don’t understand why you assumed I was innocent. I’ll be the first one to admit that finding my weapons like that seems very suspicious.”
“W… Wait a second,” Tony was still chuckling, still looking at Steve like he was an impossible piece of a physics equation.
After a couple of moments of staring at the place where she disappeared, Natasha cleared her throat. “So, how exactly are you going to prove Tony’s innocent?”
“Can’t I just visit an old friend?” he asked, innocently.
Steve realized he was staring and Stark was looking more amused by the minute so Steve blurted out the first thing that came to mind, “What are you doing here?”
A flash of anger crossed Tony's face. “Well, if my Captain wants to speak to me, I have to drop everything I'm doing so that he doesn't have to wait.”
He was sitting sideways, his head on the back of couch as he watched Tony talk with big hand gestures and bright eyes.  There was an energy to him that Steve couldn’t help but admire and despite the late hour, neither of them was particularly tired.
“You must be wondering why we called you,” she said. Steve let her speak. She was good at it and he didn’t trust himself not to mess it up.
“How...” Well, that would explain why Tony tried so hard even when he didn't have to, and acted as if he had to earn his place in the team even when he did so a thousand times over. But... “Why... I mean, how could Howard not see what an amazing and brilliant person Tony was...
“Discussing where you’ve been?” interrupted Natasha with a smirk.
He couldn’t stop thinking about the look on Tony’s face. The realization, the disbelief. And then the coldness, disgust. He’ll look at Steve like he looked at the Captain that day at the base. And this time Steve won’t be able to come to him later, hold him close and look at his easy smile. It will all be gone.
Ever so carefully, he edged out the first one. It was written on cheap, thin paper clearly torn from the back of a novel; the other side was covered in faded, nearly illegible type. The front, in Captain Roger’s cramped, tidy handwriting, read—
Fury made the same deep, disbelieving sound Tony remembered hearing so many times as a child. It was as deeply annoying now as it had been then. Tony made a face at him.
“—the only way to make sure—”
"Just about." Reluctantly, Tony pulled out of the hug.
"I think you should stay away from Steve."
Tony smiled a little. This was why he was here, he reminded himself. And the sooner he got this little piece of business squared away, the sooner he could convince Howard to let him return to Cambridge.
Tony would have been more defensive if she had sounded condescending or even concerned. But she pointed out each detail without any emotion, just plain facts. It made it difficult to refuse her.
A few feet away, a chittering animal stared at him, its eyes huge and luminous in the semi-dark. Goose pranced around it, too well-behaved to simply run away but clearly nervous to have some tiny animal down by his hooves. Tony's breath returned in a rush and he wheezed on the ground, trying to regain his equilibrium.
"I'll come down with you," Tony said finally. "Cooper, get my horse. And a horse for the boy, too."
That was it. Tony winced and handed the letter back to Yinsen.
Tony was surprised to be asked about it at all. "Yes," he said, cautious. "The pain's mostly gone. It's just annoying now. Everyone's trying to get me to stay in bed."
making a good case for yourself!” Fury snapped.
Toomes' jaw worked furiously. He clearly wanted to object, but Tony had him over a barrel and they both knew it. As the magistrate, he had control over the law in town, but Tony was the son of the county lord and nobility besides - he may not have the official power to step in, but they both knew he could do it regardless. Tony absolutely could raise a stink with the House of Lords if he wanted and he absolutely would if Toomes didn't cooperate. He didn't care much about his name or the power it gave him, but he wasn't above using it when it could do some good.
this one took a while mostly bc work has been kicking my ass this month and i've been trying to tie up a few other projects (notably my mth fills which have taken FOREVER to get off the ground and may finally be publishable some time soon). also had to do a few rewrites to shake loose how i wanted this chapter to go.
"About dinner—"
It made Tony almost sick to look at them now. Years and years of letters he’d saved as carefully as any war bride, and what had it gotten him? Nothing but heartache. He wished he could burn them or toss them aside, but even the thought worsened the bile at the back of his throat until he began to think he would actually throw up. He set the box to the side and breathed deeply through his nose until the sensation passed. Only then did he look back at the letters.
"Lord Stark." God, it really was clear how relaxed he'd been talking to Mrs. Barnes versus how uncomfortable he was talking to Tony. "I didn't see you."
“Oh?” he asked. “What an honor.”
? Nearly six years, all told before this thing—" he tapped his bad leg with his cane "—took me out of service and into Intelligence. He was promoted not long after."
After that, he had no idea what he was going to do.
Tony opened and closed his mouth several times, so indignant he was at a loss for words. Fury watched, mouth ticking up just the tiniest bit. Bastard.
"If you feel that strongly about it," he said weakly.
Tony scoffed. "Promises? You must have me confused with someone else. I don't make promises."
Pepper groaned, but she stepped aside. Tony would count that as a win.
"Ouch!" Tony tried to shrink away from the hands poking at the bruise on his side, but it didn't do him any good. Bella scowled down at him, relentless and without mercy. "God, woman, can't you be a little gentler?"
"Conditions." Rhodey's voice was flat with fury. He knew Howard Stark too well to think of him with any kindness. "What kind of conditions?"
There were, Tony mused, few situations so awkward as pomading down a lovely forest path with the love of your life whose hand in marriage you ruthlessly rejected. The silence stretched between them, thick as molasses. Up ahead, Tony could faintly hear Sousa's awkward attempts at explaining the properties of an oak tree.
?" Tony groaned. "Come on, Rhodey—"
Tony lifted her into bed, concerned all over again by how easy it was to do so. Tony had never been particularly strong and Pepper was pregnant, but it had taken hardly any effort at all. He pulled the covers over her and took one second to smooth his hand over her forehead, brushing wisps of hair out of her eyes. She smiled weakly up at him.
,” Tony said. Fury gave him a look and he shrugged. “Well. Yes, that’s the gist of it. What do you say?”
"Aw, don't be scared, honeybear! I'll protect you from big, bad Fury!"
"It's
They walked for several long, quiet minutes. Sousa visibly turned over the idea of Tony's estrangement with Captain Rogers, though Tony couldn't tell much beyond that. He was a reserved man and Tony got that sense that there was a lot more going on than he showed on the surface.
Tony swallowed several times. "You were mistaken," he said. He was proud that his voice didn't crack. "There was nothing like that between us."
Tony held a hand to his chest and adopted his biggest, saddest eyes. He’d perfected them at age eight and used them shamelessly to get extra cookies from the cook for two whole years before Jarvis found out and put a stop to  it.
Dr. Yinsen had clearly been bemused to see Tony again so quickly and in such company, but he promised readily enough to check in on Mrs. Keener. Fury, on the other hand, was not pleased when Tony finally returned to the Hall in the carriage with two children in tow. He was waiting on the steps of Shield Hall as they pulled in, arms crossed over his chest and a deep scowl on his face.
Tony looked back down at the letter. His eyes caught on the line
"I've heard that before." Tony sat, relieved that he didn't have to be posturing anymore. It was such a pain. He cracked his neck and slumped bonelessly in the chair. "What's so crazy about it?"
"Are you sure you didn't steal any flowers, too?" Peggy asked, dimpling. "Auntie has said she found you in her flower beds more than once, Lord. Stark."
Tony bit the inside of his cheek and viciously reminded himself that the Captain's disdain was something he had cultivated six years ago.
Rogers will come visit.”
“She’s probably going to use worse when she sees your face again,” Fury said. “It was her petunias you boys pulled up, remember?”
Shouldn’t he?
"He does dote on her so," Bella continued. She sounded very pleased. "I was so happy when he came to visit right after our dinner together - I had hoped he would take a shine to one of the girls, but I didn't think he would do it so quickly or so obviously! We must have a summer wedding, don't you think? It will be lovely here in the summer."
Silence reigned. Tony breathed slowly in and out through his mouth, resisting the urge to throw up. Laying this old wound bare made him sick. He'd nursed it and hidden it for so long to reveal it felt almost taboo, even to the people dearest to him in the world.
“Rhodey still doesn’t know either,” she said. Her face puckered at whatever she saw on Tony’s. “
Harley looked from his face to his hand and then cautiously reached out and shook it. Steve took it back with a bemused stare at his fingers.
He didn't let any impatience show as Harley thought it over. When he finally nodded, Tony almost drooped from relief. He didn't know what he would have done if Harley had refused. Harley stuck a hand across the table. Tony blinked down at it, then bit the inside of his cheek so he wouldn't smile. Cheeky little sod, wasn't he?
When the tidal wave of desperate emotion had calmed, he rolled over his back and considered the dark ceiling. Well, he thought. He had done it. He had been in the same space as Captain Rogers again and the world had not ended. They had even managed to speak to each other, no matter how brief, no matter how coldly polite. Tony closed his eyes. Once, they had been the closest of confidantes; there were no two hearts so open, no feelings so in unison. Now, they were strangers; no, worse than strangers, for they could never again become acquainted. It was permanent estrangement.
"More or less."
Tony was glad for all the practice he'd had at masking his emotions - he kept the blow of that shock carefully concealed. Yinsen's eyes were careful, considering.
Pepper was silent long enough that he finally looked at her. Her eyebrow was arched up high, mouth unhappily pursued.
Pepper gave him a look. “You know as well as I that even this,” she nodded to her huge belly, “wouldn’t stop the gossip if I moved in with one of you. Come on, Tony. Be reasonable.”
come with us to visit Miss Wilson!"
"It's nothing too interesting," he said to answer her question and try to redirect her attention. "Mrs. Killian needed some help with her water pump. It turned out to be much a much messier operation than I expected."
“Three weeks,” she said. “Dr. Yinsen said it can be difficult to tell, but any later would be cause for concern.”
"It'd be a shame to deny you all the chance to have a reunion," Bella said. "It's been some time, but from what I remember there was no separating your little gang. It would have been lovely to have you with us tonight, Tony - why
Tony relaxed a little. “Thank God,” he said. “And the baby?”
"Very well. If you don't have the good sense to do as I say, I'll kidnap you." Her tone brooked no argument. "You seem the type to recklessly endanger yourself further and I can hardly stand by and let you do it."
Pepper put a gentle hand on the back of his neck. "Captain Rogers doesn't know anything about this?"
"You're only a few years older than me and you already talk like an old bachelor," Sharon said. "Surely you will find
"He needs a ride home."
"You're that guy from yesterday night," he said. His eyes narrowed, intent on Captain Rogers' face. Tony had no idea why the kid looked like he wanted to kick him in the shin. "That c
Pepper didn’t smile. “It wasn’t just them,” she said.
“Lieutenant Barnes was from their mother’s first marriage,” he said. “He decided to keep his father’s name even when his mother remarried.”
"I forgot about these," Captain Rogers said with wonder. He turned the little shield over in his hands. "They're so small."
“I wasn’t aware earls knew how to fix clocks,” he said.
“I’m sure we’ll all be able to forget any past… mistakes and get along just fine,” Tony said. “I can promise I’ll be an excellent house guest! I’ll speak quietly and cordially and put all my books back in the right place in the library and I’ll only steal a few pieces of silverware!”
Tony’s stomach began to do a freefall. As if from the end of a very long tunnel, he heard himself ask. “
"Lord Stark was kind enough to show me some of his favorite volumes."
Tony sighed as if this whole conversation was beneath him.
big, fancy house."
"Well," he said. "That's good to hear. Even if we're not close anymore, I'd like to see him happy."
Tony couldn't help himself. He flicked his eyes up, taking in his first glimpse of Steve Roger's face in six years. He didn't take a step back out of sheer cussedness. Captain Rogers, like Barnes, had grown up well; sharper cheekbones, a sturdier jaw. By anyone's standards, he was beautiful; of course, he always had been to Tony, but it seemed like the years had only added to it.
people win that many times, Tony. I beat you into the ground.”
love."
"If he starts making off with something more valuable than bread, you will need to take him in hand."
Tony wanted to pretend to be his normal aloof, independent self but Rhodey was right - it had been too damn long. He clung, taking deep breaths. Rhodey ran a hand down his back.
“Dr. Yinsen said you had to ask Sir Fury for a horse into town,” she said. “Tell me true—did he make you cry?”
"It's been a while since I've been back." He wasn't going to snap, he wasn't going to show the Captain that he was getting to Tony. That was the only way to make it through this. "Not sure if there's some kind of time limit on how long it's acceptable to go between visits, but I'm pretty sure six years is pushing it. Mrs. Everhart must be so disappointed in me."
"Miss Wilson?"
Tony had no idea what had just happened. Rhodey, to his annoyance, looked as knowing as Peggy.
"Not quite." She sat down on the bed beside him. "If you want to explain why you were riding a horse dangerously fast late at night, this is your chance to do it before my husband gets wind of your little escapade."
Tony put down his small bouquet. For several long minutes, he stood and looked down at the headstone in silence. It was well-kept and tidy without the neglect of the other stones. Jarvis had kept his word.
, too. Tony reminded himself again that keeping his memory of the boy he’d known separate from the man he now was was going to be the only way he would ever get over their ruined relationship. He would have to do the same with Bucky. They’d been friends half a lifetime ago—surely Tony could treat him with gentile indifference, keep him at arms length, if they should cross paths before he could leave.
Oh, she was holding those knitting needles a little too tightly. Best to do some damage control before he found himself stabbed with one.
Pepper lay on the floor of her bedroom, still in her night shift. She was breathing heavily, eyes screwed tight as she grimaced. Tony reached for her clenched hands, taking them tightly in her own.
Yinsen's eyes narrowed. "I thought I was mistaken about you, Lord Stark," he said. "But maybe you
"I know we were never close when you were growing up, Lord Stark, but I don't think anyone with eyes could have missed what passed between the two of you several years ago. I was sure there was going to be an announcement by that summer's end."
"Jarvis made them," Tony said. "He's always been handy at carving. He used to make these little animals—"
the harley plot was an unexpected twist I decided on when I was trying to figure out ways to get tony out of dinner - since he doesn't have any helpful nephews to fall out of trees. since in the story that moment is meant to highlight anne's virtues, I wanted something similar for tony - in that, he is a defender of the underdog and also a collector of rough-and-tumble children.
Tony could have told him that he hated the idea of it or that he felt sorry for a kid who had to steal food in order to survive. Harley wouldn't like that, though - Tony could see that plain as day. He wouldn't accept Tony's charity or pity. It reminded Tony more than a little of himself at that age.
"Steve said you read a lot."
"I saw him here and there during the war," Sousa said at last. "I was shocked. He'd changed so much - not just in body, but in soul. In many ways, he wasn't the man I'd watched grow up. He smiled less, shared less. War changes every man but I could hardly account for how much it had shaped him. Even when we were on leave, he never spoke of home, not anymore. Not to me. Not to anyone." Sousa's mouth thinned. "Despite his success, he was the unhappiest man I saw during the war. And that's not a title I give lightly."
The doctor’s clinic had its sign set to open, to Tony’s relief. He swung down from his horse with a grimace and knocked on the door. He received a reply immediately.
close attention to you," she said conspiratorially. "And he insisted on bringing us all home!"
Another man sent home missing parts of himself. Tony hated the thought of it and softened a little toward this stranger.
," Tony complained and ducked another swat with a laugh that sounded more normal than it felt.
That was true enough. Bella considered this and nodded slowly, though her keen eyes were more perceptive than Tony wanted them to be.
“It’s all rather thrilling,” Peggy said. She had seemed stately before, a woman grown, but now, with her cheeks flushed and her eyes alight, she looked more like the girl she was. She really was quite stunning, Tony thought. “It’s said he grew up in this area, or that’s what everyone in town has been talking about. That’s why I wanted to ask you, Lord Stark—is it possible that you are acquainted with Captain Rogers?”
"Petey, come here baby," Tony called out as soon as he saw his son. Peter ran to the front of the couch, Tony and Steve putting a little space between them. Tony caught Peter in his arms and brought him close, sticking him between himself and Steve. Steve put a hand on Peter's back, rubbing circles, while Tony wrapped his arms around him.
"Hey you!" Steve smiled as Peter wiggled around, laughing. "How's Granma?"
"Stark," Hill started, but Fury held up a hand.
“I’m not positive that I can help you,” the former surgeon told him, pushing the sleeves of his shirt up. “But I would not turn away someone in need. There is a way that I could try, but I would need your permission to slip into your dreams and memories of what has happened.” Tony whined a little.
“It’s late, and I’m sure that Jarvis will have this waiting for you.” Steve looked around and he saw the beginnings of a suit. “This isn’t what was in here earlier.”
It didn’t seem that long, but Steve must have drifted off a little because next thing he knew there was a pressure on his chest, and he was waking up. Tony must have been moving, and he wondered if he was going to wake him up so that they could move back up to the bed. Then the pressure turned sharp, then painful, then
"Nuh uh."
“I don’t like the idea that this is all connected,” Tony added. “Alright, I’ll grab the babies. You know where we’ll be if you need anything. Jarvis should be fully functional in a few minutes or so.”
"Those are, outings, I would think."
“I was in college when I was a teen,” Tony threw in, locking eyes with Steve.
"I appreciate that, ma'am," Steve said, looking at her as he spoke, before going to explore the rest of the apartment. The bedroom was painted a soft beige color, the bedspread a solid blue color, tucked in with hospital corners. Another room across from the bedroom looked like it was a study similar to the one that Mary had. There were some folders already sitting on the desk.
"You're looking a hell of a lot better than I imagined," he replied, helping her stand, then hugging her with one arm. "Kind of a sight for sore eyes."
“Something of immense power. Stark is under the power of the Mind stone, as Loki was at one point as well.” Strange looked back towards Tony, then gently waved a hand over his face before waving Steve over. The blonde moved right away, and then Tony was being gently lowered down into his arms. “There’s nothing that I can do today, and it would be better to take him back where he’ll be comfortable.”
Steve also knew that it was going to be Tony that was going to meet with Mary's parents tomorrow, so that Peter would be surprised when they showed up. He thought it was a little odd that Tony was going through the trouble to take care of Mary's parents, even going so far as to put them up in a hotel himself, just for Peter. Maybe it wasn't odd, maybe he was just surprised that Mary's parents accepted Tony so willingly as well. Sometimes, Steve had his mind still set in the 40's.
"Yeah! I made those ones, Uncle Bruce helped with the stove though." Peter let Tony sit, sitting in his lap.
“There’s my baby girl,” Steve cooed at her, letting her settle herself in his arms, putting her head on his shoulder. “And so good looking in your clothes. Aunt Mary always knows what she’s talking about, doesn’t she?” Mary had a little self-satisfied smirk on her face, but Steve pretended to ignore it. “Looks like somebody didn’t sleep very well last night, did they?” He could share the feeling. She babbled a little against his shoulder and Steve smiled softly, gently running his fingers over her hair. Mary smiled at him, patting his arm as she walked by, heading for the dining room and the boys.
"Who are you? Are you with Mary?" There was a guarded tone to his voice now, and Steve proceeded carefully.
"Thanks, J, whatever would I do with out you?" Tony smiled a little. "Jarvis is going to be your greatest asset, Petey, mark my words. Anyway, yeah, so when I was younger I didn't exactly make the best of choices, and I just want you to avoid making those same mistakes. I made my choices because of how I grew up, and I've tried to make it so that you didn't go through that, so this could be a warning track for absolutely nothing. I wanted to rebel, so I did a lot of, er, questionable things. Drinking, a few drugs, and just don't, don't even try that stuff, it is not worth it, trust me. And yeah, I slept around a lot, but I like to think that I wasn't an asshole about it. I don't remember a lot of it.
“Why are you moving around so much?” Peter asked, then got up, walking over to her. He frowned and looked down at her. Jamie moved her hands from the table towards Peter. When he got close enough she put her hands on him, grabbing his shirt. “What are you doing?” He went to take her hands, most likely to push them away, but suddenly she was moving again. Her legs wobbled, and as Peter backed up a little, she pulled herself up onto her feet, leaning heavily on Peter.
Putting the last of the more difficult dishes in the dishwasher, Tony turned to see Steve squeezing out the different frosting into their own bowls, before adding a few other ingredients. The cupcakes were already in the oven, and it seemed that Steve was even taking over the frosting duty. Joke was on him though, Peter had already told Tony exactly how he wanted the cupcakes.
Steve paused for a second on the first floor, ears picking up a sound, and he was moving for the back door of the house. Whatever had happened before Steve had gotten downstairs, reinforcements were now headed for them through the front door He kicked open the back door, and put his arm with the shield around Wade as well to keep him protected, just in case. He heard the front door slamming open just as he was darting across the grass, going for the same spot that he had jumped the wall previous.
Downstairs, Tony went for one of the comm units that everyone had. He had passed on the design to SHIELD as well, knowing that they were much better than what the organization had been using before. When he turned it on he was treated to a familiar voice.
"Har har." Tony let out a little huff of air through his nose. "Well, I'll let you introduce the boyfriend, and I'm going to run downstairs real quick." He looked at Mary, tapping the arc reactor a little. "Won't be but a couple minutes."
"He's with Coulson," Steve told him. He had seen them sitting in the cafeteria. Tony looked at him, eyes manic. Tony wouldn't be reassured until he saw his son, he knew that, and he couldn't blame him. "Come on." He grabbed Tony's arm and pulled him out in the hall. Steve needed to grab his shield, and he could grab them some com ear pieces.
"Better," Tony answered and Peter looked at him like he was crazy. "There are lots of different Doctors," Tony told him. "I'm technically a doctor, but I'm not a medical doctor."
"Campus should be clear in the next half hour."
“He says as the family walks through the theme park dressed professionally,” Steve quipped, sounding extremely put out. He snorted out a laugh when Tony landed a smack on his arm with the back of his hand. “I’ll admit, it’s a lot more fun than I thought it would be.”
Steve bit his lip and sat down in one of the chairs next to her bed. "My Mom used to tell me that you should talk to people in a coma," Steve said quietly. "She believed that they could hear those that talked to them, swore up and down that it could help them wake up. I know your body still has to heal, but thought it might be nice to hear a familiar voice." Steve just felt that talking to her was the right thing to do. "A lot of stuff happened that you missed. Peter's alright, and so is Tony. At least, I think he is. You know him better than me, and he didn't look the least bit happy when he found out who I actually was. There's a strain there, obviously, and we both said some stuff. I'm not proud of what I said, and I wish I could use the excuse that an evil scepter made us say it. I'm still not sure, yet. This was something that not even you could have trained me for."
"No, no," Mary shook her head. "Just sexism." Tony's jaw dropped a little. "We are severely outnumbered in the Tower, so we're shoring up out defenses."
"When did you start?" She asked him.
Tony shrugged, hands in his lap. "I'm not actually sure. If you wanted to get in after dark? Or if you needed to save me, or something, I don't actually know, but if something came up I didn't want you be stuck." He worried at his lip a little with his teeth. "I know it's nothing like that utterly amazing drawing, but-" It was Tony's turn to sound surprised when Steve leaned in to kiss him.
The HUD was still flickering, but he was able to get an analysis. This man had built an arc reactor. Tony crushed it in his hand, looking over towards Mary. He was about to enter a shit storm, again.
“What exactly are they doing?” Steve spoke for the first time. “Or rather what are they trying to get you to teach them?”
“These are going to be some awful conversations,” Tony muttered.
Tony smirked as he faced Steve, catching the faint blush on his cheek. There was no way that America's greatest heroic symbol was actually checking out Tony. Either that, or Steve was exploring the changes of his sexuality, and Tony would feel a little proud if he was the one to make that happen.
Tony's ear didn't even pop as he went through the portal, but a chill washed over him. The suit started to fail, the HUD going dark, Peter's voice was cut off. He let go of the missile, saw that he had at least guided it to the Chitauri mothership, or whatever it was, was going to be. The life support systems failed, his oxygen leaking out from the damage the suit sustained. He gasped for breath, tears in his eyes. But Peter was safe.
Tony met Steve in the hallway on the way to Julie's, Peter in his arms, asleep on his shoulder. He had gotten a call from Coulson that Rachel was out of surgery, but the next twelve hours would really be the most telling for her condition. She was stable, but not awake. They would be staying at the hospital overnight. Steve then texted him to meet him upstairs, than it might be better if Peter spent the night with Wade. Something was up.
“My point is, we didn’t do this on purpose, but it’s going to happen. So, the least we can do is protect him when that danger comes calling, like we always do.” Mary looked at Tony, really looked at him, into his eyes and ran her thumb along the edges of the dark circles under his eyes. “When was the last time you slept, Tony?”
“The rainbow bridge he’s always talking about?” Tony asked with a frown. “What did his girl call it? Einstein something, uh, Einstein-Rosen bridge. Is it like that?”
"Oh, for the love of- Wade!" Tony sat up, hand pressed to his side a little to ease the small ache still in his ribs. "How do you even know about that, you're- Never mind." He shook his head, rubbing at his face with one hand, careful to avoid his nose. He and Steve had been back in the Tower for two days since their run in with the assassin. Winter break was over, it was the weekend, but Wade's Mom was going back to the hospital for another round of treatment, and Tony said he'd make sure that Wade got to school starting on Monday.
Tony turned his head a little, leaning up to kiss Steve's cheek. "Let me work my magic, babycakes." Tony could feel Bruce's eyes roll at the pet name. "Jarvis is already working on the next file, and Bruce's machines are still running possible compounds. Nothing much we can do now until we get more information."
"Yeah," Rhodey nodded. "Look, I'm sorry."
"Jarbis?" Peter asked, trying to get some of the peanut butter from the roof of his mouth.
“The Tony Stark name is already starting to corrupt yours.” Tony patted Steve’s arm. “First thing they’ll focus on, after finding out what you look like finally, is that Tony Stark is corrupting an American symbol of wholesomeness. Captain America, no matter who is, shouldn’t be gay, that’s blasphemous. And he shouldn’t be dating the infamous playboy Tony Stark.” Steve pursed his lips a little. “This is of course coming right along the heels of who would possibly find it okay to let someone else take the sacred mantle of Captain America, and then they’ll find out that you’re still the original, and we’re right back to defacing the perfect Christian ideal of America.”
"We've also got scans out for the Maximoffs," Steve told him. "They have a vendetta against you, and they made their play obvious."
"We'll leave at Oh-Five-Hundred," she told him as he moved towards the door. Steve sighed as he left to track down Tony.
"Got a family?" Tony asked him, pouring some water for them as Yinsen rolled the dice.
Meg moved to the side a bit more, still holding onto Bucky's arm, but wanting to see more clearly what was going on. "I'm not-" Clint let the arrow go, landing in between her and Bucky, forcing the two to separate from each other. Before Steve could make a sound Natasha was rushing at Bucky while Clint was leaping over some furniture to get to Meg.
Mary nodded a couple of times, then sat back up. "Alright."
"I carry around mace, too." Tony stared at her for a second before letting out a snort of laughter, a little bit on the side of manic.
“Don’t give me that look. Everything’s alright.” He turned back to the screen that was rolling quickly with code. “I’m working on this program with Jarvis, once I get-”
“She likes it when people talk to her,” Peter said with a smile. Jamie looked at Peter with a smile, throwing a couple squeals his way, before looking back at Bucky, and touching his longer toes. Bucky quirked a little smile at the girl. She was Steve Rogers’ kid, Bucky had no doubt about that. He looked forward to Steve going through what he had, every time he had to drag the punk from an alley. He would absolutely deny that she had wormed her way into his heart already.
I have pictures up on my Pinterest of the exact outfit that Steve is wearing. Mmmm, it would be a perfect ass indeed.
"Last year was fun," Peter said. "A big dinner with everyone there. But, it's your day, Daddy." Tony smiled at him. Peter was a big proponent of the Birthday tradition; The birthday person does what they like, and doesn't have to do any chores.
“It’s your fault.”
Then he was reminded why he thought it was time to come. “You’re right, they are the reason that I’m here.”
You're all beautiful and I love you.
“The kitchen is only one story,” Tony told him as Steve wiped off his pants.
“She also comes to spend time with you,” Steve said softly, almost like he was asking permission for something. “Would that be alright, too? If I spent more time with you? Maybe to get too know you?”
"I do admire you're unwavering loyalty to my son," Tony confessed, and that pulled another grin from Wade. "I do not admire the little bit of creepiness that you possess."
"That's no fun! You didn't do horribly, but when Mary spun you, you almost did a face plant. But, really Steve, how does someone mess up the Time Warp when Tony Stark was teaching you?"
"'Cause you're a superhero," Peter answered happily. He could see the blue glow from the tesseract now, could see his Tower. He was getting closer. Too close.
Tony phone dinged and he grabbed it, seeing a response from Rhodey. 'Don't forget what you said on the plane.' Tony let his lips turn up just a little in a smile.
“Yeah, but this isn’t the same suit that I remember seeing,” Steve pointed out. “This specifically isn’t the suit that you’ve been using on call outs.” He started to walk over to the suit and Tony jumped up, grabbing onto his hand.
“This is a thing now, isn’t it?” Steve asked as the car started.
"We all are!"
"I have indeed been uploaded, Sir," Jarvis told him, the AI running through the suit now, making it easier for Tony to navigate with its weight. "We're online and ready."
"I'm thinking that I stopped a mad-man," Tony answered, not looking at Pepper, watching the roads, timing how long until they got to the airstrip.
," Steve growled, getting in between Natasha and Bucky. He glanced back at Meg and saw a snarl on her face, the pupils in her eyes blown wide. "Buck-" Bucky growled a little and Steve rolled his eyes. "Bucky," he glared back at the man, "take her to the kids. Now."
"I'm afraid Mrs Parker is leaving the building." Tony raised an eyebrow. "She is on her way to the New York SHIELD building, it seemed rather urgent."
"Daddy!" Peter laughed, twisting and turning in Tony's arms, until he wrapped his arms around Tony's neck. "Bunny's can't hug like I do!"
You beautiful people you! I'm here to give more Rhodey love in this chapter! Also, some Thor love. This will probably be as much as I delve into Thor: The Dark World in this story. There may be some call backs later, but meh. Everything serves a purpose. Mwuahaha.
“I am going to enjoy this, Captain.”
Steve knew he was tearing up as his vision blurred briefly, but he felt the stretch on his face from his smile. “Yeah, baby girl, that’s me. That’s my name.” He rocked back a little, sitting on his feet, feeling content and free, even if for just a minute. Movement in front of him pulled his attention back to Tony and Peter, the older man leaning in to whisper something in Peter’s ear, then patting his back as the boy jumped up. Peter pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek before running from the room and down the hall.
"Tony."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve quickly followed Tony, the smaller man moving quickly. "Tony." He didn't stop at his name, kept moving. "Tony," Steve said, this time reaching out and taking a gentle hold of Tony's upper arm. He turned around quickly, looking at Steve with wide eyes, his other hand reaching up, but then resting on Steve's wrist. "If you need to talk-"
"Put on the suit, let's find out," Steve threw back.
"You are too young to be embarrassed by us kissing," Tony exclaimed, pulling a little smile from the baby. "She is her Papa's daughter, that is for sure."
Mary smiled as Peter went on, eating her dinner, and Steve remembered that he had his own plate in front of him. He cut some of the chicken, and scooped up some pasta and sauce with it. There was a little moan when he started to chew, and Mary smirked a bit.
"Thinking that you didn't get there in time?" Rachel asked with a little smirk. "Missed your chance Stark?"
"They're going to recruit a fourth into their group," William told him ominously. "This only spells trouble for you. Mary already likes her and she's been telling Rachel about her, and now the newest house guest." Tony blinked and looked up at him. "I'm only telling the truth. You're doomed."
"Oh, the misery, the exquisite tragedy, the Susan Haywood of it all. I actually know who she is," Steve whispered that part before continuing. "I can just picture you there, sitting alone at your table in your white dress and lavender flower."
"Ewwwww!" Peter turned his face into Mary's side.
"You just want to jump right into work?" Tony said, watching the man. "You don't want anything to eat? For me to show you where your room is?"
“Projected completion is eighteen days, Sir,” Jarvis told him and Tony sighed. Eight months was a long time frame, and Jarvis could only move so fast if they were looking for a facial match, and that was in the US alone.
"Hey, buddy!" Tony ruffled his hair, making Peter giggle a little and try to move his head away. "Did you have fun with Grandma and Grandpa, today?" Peter nodded and pulled away, pulling his backpack off his shoulders.
Stane gave one finally pull, and Tony thought his heart had just stopped. It might as well have as Obidiah disconnected the arc reactor from his body. His body filled with ice, movement slowly starting to come back, but not enough to stop Stane. He watched the man he had once looked up to, look at his arc reactor, like it was his own invention.
"I can't help that I have so much better taste in music than he does," Tony defended.
She gasped, ducking when the glass suddenly broke, showering the ground. "Mary!" She looked up at Tony's shout.
"Still trying to figure that one out myself," Tony said with a sigh. "But wait, there's more!" Steve glanced over and saw Bruce walking in from the back of the lab. He nodded to Steve in greeting.
"Also, I do enjoy the company of Mrs Parker."
"Not angry, no." Tony felt the 'but' brush up against him, become a good friend. "Just trying to tell myself that there must be a reason for you to keep it all locked up so tight."
"You're restless," Steve murmured, turning his head to look at Tony, looking sleepy, but just the right amount of awake.
"I don't like bullies." Tony's head whipped around at the new voice and he swore his jaw dropped. The man standing there was dressed in a ridiculous costume, but one that he knew all too well. And attached to his arm was a very familiar red, white, and blue shield with a star. The man threw the shield, hitting Vanko's suit in the head, causing him to stumble back, and the shield rebounded back to his arm, and he threw it again.
"Nope, New York City," Tony said again. "That includes Staten Island, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the works." He glanced around at the silent audience around him. "What? I've spent more on worse. A lot more." Tony shrugged a little, glancing down as his other hand ran through Peter's hair. Steve noted that Peter's hand was over Tony's arc reactor, and how relaxed Tony was about it. "Figured the city could use a break, and I'd help up so as much money and time can be put into continuing to rebuild."
I did see Civil War, it as amazing. The movie will influence me to a point, but only in the fact that it reinforced ideas I already had, so still, no spoilers happening in this story! (Be sure to check out the end notes as well.)
Tony looked at Steve, and wrinkled his nose as he smiled. Steve smiled back then leaned in to kiss him over Peter. “Ewwwww.” Steve laughed when Tony groaned as Peter made a face at them kissing so close to him.
"She's waiting for us to come to Granma's room." The older man told him. "They only want two grown-ups and one Peter back there at a time," he quickly explained when he saw Peter look back at Tony.
As they road up the elevator to the apartments, that was furthest from his mind. They could see that both doors to the occupied apartments were open. Bucky and Mary visible in one, with Peter seated on the floor, looking a little morose, but doing his homework. He probably didn’t understand why he couldn’t be with Wade at the moment. Steve assumed that they still had everything under control with Meg, and the babies. He’d be wanting a long cuddle session with both their kids when this was done.
"I served in Desert Storm," the man said suddenly and Tony raised an eyebrow. "I recognize someone healing, and coming to terms with PTSD," he held up a hand when Tony opened his mouth to protest. "My wife just cares very much for our daughter and grandson, and if she ever corners you, you're never going to hear the end of not marrying Mary right away, taking care of both her and Peter."
Wade went for Steve's suit and Peter hopped back up on the bed. "Wade, I need a comb!" Tony smirked, watching the boys work with a ruthless efficiency that Peter never even gave to his homework.
Tony wanted to call them, wanted to hear their voices, but he had purposely not turned the service back on, knowing that he would be bombarded. He had nearly cried when Rhodey had handed him back his phone back in Afghanistan. They had found it in the sand, not far from where Tony had been injured, and Tony had been afraid that he had lost some of his favorite pictures of Peter, the ones that he didn't have Jarvis save, just in case.
"Yeah, I got it," Tony nodded, gently pulling away from Steve. "I've got stuff in the workshop." He turned and practically jogged away, heading for the door downstairs, leaving Steve in the hallway.
"You gotta do what you gotta do, Cap," Tony shrugged a little, hands in his pockets. "You can't ignore a beauty like that, she's gotta see the country, you know." Steve glanced back at the bike. "Seriously, who knows when the next time you'll be able to do this will be. You're still practically unknown to the outside world, better take advantage of that while you still can."
"Uncle Nick!"
"Oh, Lord Stark!" Sharon cried. "You would
"Not yet, Miss Carter." Tony hoped his voice sounded light instead of strained. He'd lost the ability to tell.
Tony nodded. Yinsen turned to his desk and rifled through some papers, coming up with a folded piece of parchment. Tony recognized the cramped, spidery handwriting; it was less shaky than the letter he'd received.
“It reminded me of you,” he’d said with one of those bashful smiles. “It looks a bit like Jericho, doesn’t it?”
"Without any issues," he confirmed. He offered her a rakish smile. "You've even more ravishing in candlelight than moonlight, Mrs. Barnes. Are you sure you don't want to trade up for an earl?"
Tony breathed through the pain and forced himself to smile. "Well," he said. "We were much younger the last time we saw each other. He's certainly changed quite a bit as well."
"We wouldn't want to infringe on your visit," Captain Rogers said.
Sousa nodded. "After hearing those two go on about their adventures in this forest, I had to see it for myself in the daylight." Sousa tilted his head up, taking in the sunlight filtering through the trees. "It is lovely. I can see why they always talked about it."
"I've never known Lord Stark to be cowed by any piece of machinery," Bella said from behind Tony. She was fixing her gloves when he turned to look at her, a little surprised, and she winked at him. "I remember how you used to run around fixing everything you could get those grimy little paws on, sir. You should have heard how Mr. Hogan used to go on about him."
definition of— Hey!”
“Quickly,” she said.
They had definitely not been talking about trees. Sousa had even said it with a straight face. Tony eyed him, both impressed and unnerved by the easy lie.
"Lord Stark," he said. He offered his hand and Tony took it, ignoring the man's raised eyebrows. "Adrian Toomes, at your service."
Captain Rogers didn't speak as he reached for Tony for the second time that day, taking him firmly around the waist and lifting him into the carriage without any sign of strain. His hands were warm and broad through Tony's thin jacket, creating pinpricks of heat down Tony's sides. Tony was too startled to react and he allowed himself to be handled like a doll. Captain Rogers set him down gently in the back seat of the carriage, careful of Tony's bad ankle. He began to pull away when his eyes caught on Tony's. They were closer than they'd been in years, practically breathing the same air. Tony's heart fluttered, hummingbird quick, in his chest. His lips parted. Captain Rogers' eyes darted down to them, pupils dilating and Tony, weak as he was, couldn't help leaning in just a little. It had been so long.
Being denied any of Captain Rogers' deeper emotions was another nail in the coffin of their old relationship.
That made them both laugh. Tony relaxed a little. Whatever their trepidation about him, at least they could be convinced otherwise.
Tony turned. The tall, dark-haired woman standing behind him, her hair done in exquisite curls and her mouth rogued a somewhat scandalously deep red, couldn’t be that much younger than him. She offered him a wry smile.
"Betrayed by my own friends," Sousa said with mock outrage that made them just laugh at him. He turned back to Tony. "I'll take your challenge, Lord Stark. Now it's apparently a matter of protecting my honor."
you after that whole mess. Like you'd been run through. And we
Tony wished he was a little less susceptible to her huge, shining eyes. Sharon was so guileless it was difficult to accuse her of manipulation, but Tony would be surprised if she didn't know how well that expression worked on people she wanted something from.
Tony accepted the change in subject. He offered Fury a mocking salute. "Sir, yes sir," he said, all irony.
“I’m not sure,” Tony said. “She was bleeding, but she couldn’t tell me what caused it. Half-hour ago—I came as soon as I found her by horse.”
He pretended not to hear her. "I need more wine," he said. His drunkenness had long since left him; he just felt sick and sore now. "I need
"It depends." Tony figured any close friends of Sharon and Peggy were probably good people, but he wasn't sure how much Pepper wanted other people to know. "Sir Fury's been kind to let me stay at his manor, but who knows when that kindness will run out?"
"Spending so much time away from it only makes us long for our homes more," Sousa said. "You'd be surprised to hear how often we can turn the conversation to where we come from, our families, our houses. I think I've heard every story from Steve and Bucky's childhood three times over." He tilted his head, smiling. "You feature in them a great deal."
When Yinsen had closed the door, Pepper whapped Tony on the arm. He yelped, giving her a betrayed look.
"What exactly has he taken?" Tony asked Toomes.
“Luckily for you, that’s the right impression,” Tony said. “I need to borrow one of your horses.”
Peggy and Sharon exchanged speaking looks. Tony didn't look at Captain Rogers, who had Barnes at his elbow, saying something to him in a low voice. He could still feel the warm imprint of the Captain's hands on his arms, the casual strength of his body.
Hm. "It was all very last-minute," he agreed. "I honestly didn't expect to stay for longer than a fortnight."
"Mr. Toomes, I'd like to see the thief. Speak to him."
"You know, I think you have the greatest talent for self-misery I have ever seen in a person, Tony."
"You really don't like that guy, huh?" Harley asked.
"Crazy," Harley muttered again, but he didn't hesitate to follow Tony out of the door.
They glared at each other until Pepper cracked and began to laugh. Tony laughed too, relieved that she wasn’t bleeding and crying anymore, happy that she seemed to be on the mend and the scare was over.
“You aggravate me so much!” Pepper said. “Why must you always make me feel like I’m fourteen, Anthony Stark!”
Tony's stomach dropped to his toes. For a long moment, all he could do was blink down at his hands, mind full of white noise and panic. When he could finally make himself look at Bella, she smiled sadly at him.
Pepper had always been the kindest of all of them. Tony's relief almost overwhelmed him. He smiled at her until his cheeks ached.
"That was a one-time-only thing! I wasn't even sure it would work, but I had to do
"Just visiting," he said, trying to sound relaxed and casual.
"What have you done now?" he thundered out.
"Maybe," he said.
"All part of the country doctor's life, I guess."
Reaching the top of the stairs, Tony bent to give her cheek a kiss. She allowed it, then pushed him away with a laugh. Without any other recourse, Tony turned to face their guests.
Rhodey rolled his eyes but he was smiling. "What're you going to do, huh? Throw a book at him?"
Tony widened his eyes, the picture of innocence. "Me? Why Mrs. Fury, I can't believe you would think—"
Tony turned to face him more fully. Sousa was smiling but his eyes were solemn. He really meant that. "You can't be serious."
To his credit, Dr. Yinsen’s mouth firmed and he immediately reached for the heavy black bag that stood open near the door, collecting different vials and syringes and bandages without even needing to look at them.
- was written in clear and legible script.
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again, completely taken aback. He knew what rumormongers were like, the way they could seize a story and run away with it. But he hadn't expected anyone to chatter about him
He lifted his chin as he met the Captain's direct blue gaze. His heart beat unevenly but he knew that it didn't show on his face - it never did. He had no idea what the Captain was thinking under that piercing stare or why he'd even brought the subject up to begin with. Why did Captain Rogers, clearly about to become engaged himself, care about Tony's supposed romantic life?
Tony gaped. At least it was dark; he was well aware the motion made him look like a fish. "Mrs.
Speaking of, a soft, “Come in,” made him open the door and smile at the obviously overworked, but still looking composed as ever, Peggy Carter.
“You and Stark?” said Natasha dubiously. “I thought you hated men like him?”
“He’s lucky he has you, you know?” Steve said.
“You were what?” Tony pushed.
But while he would have been mad about it before (as he had been with similar situations) he couldn't bring himself to be now. It had taken Steve saving his sorry ass to realize it, but maybe Steve was right in benching Tony from time to time. Maybe Steve knew his limits better than Tony himself did. Maybe Steve just cared.
There was a tense silence in the room, you could hear a pin drop.
Steve cleared his throat. “Good morning.”
“I want you to see yourself the way I see you.” Steve said, painfully honest.
Tony was hesitant but didn't deny Steve access when Steve's tongue swiped over his bottom lip. That was all Steve really needed before he was kissing Tony even more desperately, tongue exploring, teeth clashing. It was everything Steve thought it would be and more.
“So, what, you’ve intentionally set yourself up as a target to the Mandarin? Why would you do that?” Steve was so angry in that moment. All he wanted to do was protect Tony, and the stupid man kept getting himself in trouble.
“Because Stark, you are going into foreign territory to negotiate peace and bringing your high-tech weapon of mass destruction may not send the message we're trying to convey,” said Fury in his nicest voice. It wasn't really all that nice. “Besides, as I said, you will have Rogers and Romanoff at your side at all times.”
Tony smiled. “We were at each other’s throats so much back then. Couldn’t go through a conversation without disagreeing about something.”
Tony closed his eyes. “What do you want from me, Steve?” the words were sharp, but in a way that showed vulnerability behind it.
“Why?”
, like Tony was made of glass and would break at any moment.
“Did you even listen to a word I said?” Natasha narrowed her eyes at him.
“Wait, what?”
“Go already,” and she pushed him out of the chair.
Steve smiled. “What would you like to know?”
Steve didn’t really love him. He was from the 40s, it was only natural that he would confuse simple attraction and desire for love. He was the type of person who didn’t understand the point of casual sex, so every attraction probably seemed like love to him.
There were some ways in which Tony could have taken that speech the wrong way. Mostly how the team only needed him for what he was (rich, smart...) and not who he was. But he knew Cap didn't mean it that way. He meant that Tony was valuable and not just for his genius or his money. For some reason... for some reason, Tony Stark was valuable to the team for who he was. He was valuable to
“That’s it,” Natasha smiled.
The guy turned toward his minions. “Should I tell him?”
“Is that... is that a bomb?” asked Clint.
He was finally getting immersed in his drawing, tuning out everything around him, including his thoughts, when he felt someone sit down next to him.
And Steve saw in that moment, more clearly than ever, how Tony was the same person as Iron Man. This was the person who could get under his skin with just a few words. Who could make him mad and frustrated and annoyed with a one liner. But it was also the person who could make him laugh more than anyone, who could make him feel happier than he’s been in a very long time.
While most of the bad guys managed to get away, they did capture enough of them to ensure someone would have necessary information, even if extracting it wouldn’t be fun. Steve was always grateful to Natasha for stepping in when the prisoners started to get difficult.
“Wait, what?”
“And what?”
“I hope you’re right about him,” she said then released him. “Hurry up though, I won’t be able to keep people from snooping forever.”
“Mornin’” Tony mumbled, then promptly stole Steve’s coffee from out of his hands.
Which was exactly what he had to do now, sitting at a meeting, about to suggest they invite Tony Stark inside their base to prove he didn’t illegally sell his weapons to a known terrorist.
Natasha smiled. “Perhaps not.”
He got Tony kidnapped.
like that.”
“That you are in the workshop.”
“Go talk to him,” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“So, when do we move?” Natasha asked.
"Yes," Tony said. And then, "and finished it."
“Okay,” Tony repeated. “Are you ready?”
Then, without warning, the small doors at the back of the room opened and Tony Stark walked inside, like he owned the building. He wore a three piece suit and sunglasses that probably cost more than Steve’s rent. He looked good. Nobody could deny that.
and not some nameless stranger. “You know, I don’t think I caught your name.”
“Copy. Also, don't call them robots, they're undeserving of the title. Honestly, I did better robots in college while drunk,” Tony replied.
"Maybe you could stop being so fucking vague, and tell me what the hell is going on for once," Steve snapped, not able to help himself.
It was always a bit nerve wracking to be at the SHIELD headquarters, him being who he was. It didn’t matter that the chance of someone figuring out his identity was as likely as an alien invasion.
“I could've helped!” Tony insisted.
Steve was silent for a second. “But were you happier then?”
Later, he would look back and realize how stupid he had been. The gas was clearly affecting him, as was affecting everyone else besides Steve (who apparently had an immunity to it, but that was hardly surprising) but Tony didn't care at that moment. If Natasha (who wrapped her scarf around her mouth but her movements were still much less graceful then usual) could fight, so could he (which was stupid, because she was one of the best fighters in the world and he could barely win in a fistfight with Happy).
“I guess it would also have to bring hope to the people, you know?”
Tony sighed. “You know they’re watching us, right?”
“And how do you see me?” Tony opened his eyes. They seemed to hold on a challenge Steve was happy to accept.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief. The minions they captured that day in Hell’s Kitchen had to be left behind, since they attracted quite the commotion and they couldn’t risk bringing them on board. Steve knew that leaving them with their friends from Hell’s Kitchen was the right choice, and he trusted them to take care of it, but he was still eager to start the investigation themselves. One of them will have to talk sooner or later, and it will bring them one step closer to Hammer and the Mandarin.
“Another base? How?”
There was a blur on the horizon he thought was a plane, until it was close enough for him to realize it was not. A monochrome picture with a bright red spark in it, and Steve's fingers moved on its own accord, wanting to capture the image but without paint, without canvas, they just moved, in the air, suspended with no purpose.
“Why not? Steve, let yourself be happy for once.”
“No, I know,” Steve said.
"Maybe if you told me what that plan is, I could help."
Nobody really understood it. Steve was usually so calm and collected, the kind of person who never engaged in verbal fights, but intercepted them and played the role of a peaceful middleman for opposing parties. And if anyone did dare to go against him, a glare and a stern but not raised voice was all that was needed to resolve the situation.
Easier said than done.
Dismissed for the moment, the Avengers returned home to the Tower. Its stark white walls and modern grey furniture didn't give him the color he seemed to want, but it was comforting nonetheless. This was home, every last inch of it, the kind Steve never thought he'd have.
“I don’t hate you.” When Tony raised an eyebrow, Steve elaborated. “I don’t hate Iron Man.”
“Have you ever met him?” Steve asked. Despite his dislike for the man inside the armor, he could see why Tony would like the idea of him, an armored vigilante, using tech to save the world.
"Yeah," Tony sighed. "It was a pretty easy fix."
It didn’t work out for them in the end, sadly. But he was always going to love her.
The thought made Steve so angry that he had to force himself not to think about it. “So what you're saying is... Tony doesn't know I have… a crush...” and saying crush was a big understatement, but Steve wasn't ready to say anything more aloud “...on him, because...”
“SHIELD managed to locate us,” Steve's voice was soft as if he was trying to match it with Tony's. “JARVIS helped apparently. I didn't hear much but it looked like his input of the location where he last had a connection with you helped greatly.” Tony realized Steve would have known much more than that if he didn't have to take care of Tony and went to a debriefing like he probably wanted to. The thought was enough for Tony to pull away.
The elevator doors opened before Steve even realized they stopped moving. And then they were in the penthouse.
In hindsight, it probably wasn't his best idea to shoot a missile at the angry supervillain's back but he was getting rather desperate. Doom, on the other hand, didn't even flinch, not even when everything in his vicinity caught on fire, but he did seem more aggravated by the action, enough to turn around and do his magic mumbo jumbo and then Tony's suit was shutting down, and everything went black, and
Unfortunately that was when Clint decided to speak up, “Natasha’s done. Wrap things up with Stark and meet us in the van.”
“And what is it?” he asked, voice full of hope for the new future.
And while the words before hurt, the past not quite yet healed, these ones broke his heart. He felt numb, his whole body frozen. He knew Tony was talking about the team. The Captain, the organization. But it was Steve Rogers who heard those words, coming out of Tony Stark's mouth.
And then Stark. He was supposed to be the worst of them. And yet, here he was, sitting down with a man he met only once before, basically a stranger, in casual wear, looking tired, and talking like they did this every day. Complimenting Steve’s art.
“5 years? Wow. Why did you leave?”
Steve grabbed Tony's waist to bring their bodies even closer and Tony put his hands on his shoulders, fingers going through his hair. There was no more hesitancy in his movements, like Tony finally gave up on holding himself back.
“It’s okay, it’s refreshing to have someone be so blunt with me. But to answer your question, the advantage is that when you appear to be like everyone else the interest in you decreases.”
By the time they all found themselves at a debriefing, Tony was still in a bad mood (and wasn't that an understatement). Steve wasn't helping his case by glancing over at Tony every now and then, wearing that worried expression (and Tony learned to differentiate between his worried and his disapproving face. It was a slight difference when it came to Tony, but it was there).
It was a given though, since he was sort of in charge, even if not officially. The organization wasn’t exactly legal, but over the years they made up a system, and it worked for them. Steve would trust his team with his life. They were all like him. Beaten and broken and betrayed and now they wanted justice and Steve was the only one willing to do what needed to be done for that justice to be served.
But they were there for a reason and his name was Richard Johnson, an acclaimed advocate of many wealthy businessmen and their companies, including Hammer Technologies. Steve and his crew have been tracing Hammer for a while, trying to find any kind of evidence that he was dealing under the table, selling to terrorists.
Steve hesitated. Not a lot of people knew what had happened that year. Steve told the story only two times since then, once to his original team (Natasha, Clint and Bruce) and once to Peggy. They were also the only people who knew what exactly had happened (with Bucky, who was there). Everyone else knew the watered down version of the story that Clint and Natasha spread around.
Tony didn’t push, but his eyes were worried.
Steve hesitated. Peggy was right when she said that he didn’t have a life outside of his job. He had nothing but his art, and they already discussed that. Bringing it up again might seem like he was fishing for compliments.
Steve didn't often feel jealous.
Steve met Clint outside the door and together they entered the room. The first thing Steve noticed were the two guards laying on the ground, stunned. The second thing were the boxes. Piles and piles of boxes.
“You’re late,” Natasha said, when they were steady on their feet.
So Tony, as reckless as he was, crawled to the guy, avoiding all the shots and fighting around him and hoping Natasha and Steve were holding their own. Once he got a hold of the man's weapon Tony hesitated. The gun was standard issue, nothing special but that wasn't the problem. Tony knew how to use a gun, as well as any other weapon (he was manufacturing and creating them for a better part of his life, of course he knew how to use them) but there was a difference between shooting at a target in his lab and shooting at real people. Sure, he did it all the time with the suit, but his targeting system always made sure there were no lethal injuries and most of his weapons nowadays were non-lethal anyway (except for when he was fighting robots and the like, but those weren't
“Here we go again,” Natasha signed ordering them more drinks even though they hadn't finished what they already had. “Listen, those one night stands mean nothing to Tony. Why do you think no one ever stays for more than one night? They're meaningless to him.”
“Because I love you, dammit!” Steve said, and the word love wasn't even hard to say. It was as easy saying it, as it was hearing it from Natasha.
“Which one exactly? Iron Man or Tony Stark? Or does she know you’re one and the same? Crap, everyone will know I’m the Captain now as well,” Steve felt a moment of panic wash over him before Tony spoke.
As soon as the doors closed behind him, Natasha said, “I like him.”
“Flirt with him. We all know he’s weak for a pretty face,” Steve could hear amusement in Clint’s voice and was about to retort, when he saw Stark, elegant as ever, about to pass by him.
“No!” he exclaimed. “Nothing like that. I did met him on a job, but he’s not a suspect,” he added.
Steve bit his lip. He wasn’t sure where to start. “It’s complicated,” he settled on.
He’s been here often enough, though, that no one even gave him a second glance anymore. It was a problem at the beginning, people being outraged at a civilian walking down some of the most classified hallways in the world. But having friends at high places had its perks.
“Oh, yeah, of course,” Steve said, but Tony just kept talking.
"What?" Steve managed.
Steve was suddenly next to him, eyes looking all over him, looking for injuries. When he noticed Tony clutching his bicep, he pried the fingers off to inspect the injury and upon seeing it was just a graze he relaxed and it was only then that Tony noticed how tense he had been. Tony felt bad for making him worry and knew that as soon as Steve stops worrying, stops looking over him again and again, as if having to convince himself Tony was really okay, checking the injury, as if afraid it will turn out to be worse if he just averts his eyes off of it for just a second, that when he finally realizes Tony is here and not dead on the floor, he is going to be
Natasha and Steve both stood looking up at the sky. It was always impressive, watching that armor at work, even when Steve hated to admit it.
Tony felt a little bit guilty. Cap did have to change his so called 'battle plan' to come and protect Tony from being molested by the bad guys. And he was grateful, he really was. Sadly, in the true Tony Stark fashion, gratitude was not what came out of his mouth. “You didn't need to save me, I'm not some damsel in distress,” he hissed and knew he wasn't helping his case when Steve seemed to become even angrier.
“I have several,” Tony said with a wicked smile.
“Well he better hurry, because we don’t have much time,” Steve said.
What was happening to him?
“I do everything fast,” he responded, with a gleam in his eyes. “Can you keep up?”
And then one of them said, “He looks kinda familiar.”
Stark grimaced. “Tony, please.”
It drove Steve up the wall. And Iron Man seemed to also disagree with his own method of doing things (“uptight” as he would call it), so it was obvious why the two of them didn’t get along.
“Don’t worry, guys,” Tony said, amused. “If I hurt him I have a feeling not even all of that will be enough to stop you from coming after me.”
But Clint was still turned toward Sam. “This means that not only will we have to give a shovel talk to Tony Stark but Iron Man as well.”
But his team (well, two of them) needed him and he couldn't let them down. He couldn't let Steve (dad? Himself?) down. It all came back to the same insecurities, same issues.
“An address. To another base.”
There was pain now, in Tony's expression, but he still didn't say anything. This was the longest Tony had ever been quiet and Steve hated every minute of it. “God, please Tony, say something.”
Steve turned around and stared at Tony incredulously. The henchmen that managed to slip past Steve were on the floor, unconscious. Tony himself was standing among them, unharmed.
Steve wanted to say something, but the tightness in his throat didn't let the words out.
” Steve said but didn't argue further.
Well fuck. Steve wasn’t one for cursing but he felt like it now. “Purely by accident,” Steve said, making it up as he went along, “It was some gallery exhibition or something, I can’t really remember it anymore. We sort of started to talk about art and the next thing I knew, she adopted me.” Steve smiled shyly, the way Natasha would sometimes when she was lying through her teeth.
The ceiling was white, spotless. Not a hint of red on it. Steve stared and was confused as to why he had been expecting red. Tony's walls have always been pristine, the kind of white you only see in newly bought marble that does not last longer than a day.
Steve left it alone. It was already a miracle they hadn’t bitten each other’s heads off during the mission, he wasn’t going to press his luck any further.
“No, no, I get it.” And then Tony got serious. “It actually makes more sense than I’m willing to admit, if only because I should have known,” the last part was said in a whisper, as if Tony was speaking to himself.
Tony winced and vowed to pay for all the statues that were destroyed as he blew William Shakespeare's head off with a repulsor blast.
When the first henchmen barged into the room, Steve took care of them pretty quickly. But he knew they had been discovered. More were coming, and he had to be prepared if he was going to buy Tony more time.
Steve looked back at the menu. The prices weren’t written, and the names of the dishes didn’t make any sense. Steve was so out of his element, and after five minutes of staring at the menu in total silence, he still didn’t know what to order.
Once they were back at the penthouse, sitting on the couch, Steve relaxed.
“Doom. When I got here he was already trying to leave. Didn't even bother much with fighting me even when he had a clear advantage. Why would he go through all this trouble and then just leave in the middle of it?” Tony wondered.
“He’s different, Peggy,” Steve said. “I think he really might be.”
Tomorrow they would go and try to save the universe, and Steve knew that if he didn’t speak up now he would forever regret it. Because there were no certainties, and anything could happen, and this was an opportunity Steve wasn’t going to let go.
“I do.”
“Thor is overseeing the transport,” Natasha continued.
, he wrote and sent before he could lose his nerve.
“What juicy parts?” asked Sam, now invested.
She raised an eyebrow, “I’m sure you can keep a secret until you’re comfortable enough to tell him.”
So Steve had to trust Tony, and focus on the punches flying toward him. The guy was fast, but so was Steve, their movements tough to follow for anyone but them. Steve thought he could get an upper hand, try to use his slightly bigger frame to overpower him, but the tattoo guy expected it, wanted it to happen. Despite trying not to, the fact was that Steve's mind was still on Tony, and it cost him. Trying to end the fight fast was not going in Steve's advantage.
When the team finally arrived with Tony's armor in tow, Tony was ready to kick some Asgardian ass. With his teammates. Not alone.
Tony blinked at him. "Is that a wish for your suit's color scheme change that I'm hearing?"
“Steve, can you do that? Can you focus until we get out? I’ll answer any questions you have then, I promise.”
Steve frowned. “You’re here to tell us how your weapons got there. Who sold them to the Mandarin?”
“So, Steve Rogers,” Tony began. “Tell me something about yourself.”
Tony wasn't sure what happened next. One moment he was standing, trying to convince Cap that he was okay and the next, he was on his knees, head on Steve's chest, hands clutching desperately at the front of his costume. Steve's hands were around him, as if he was trying to shield Tony from the world. It made him feel safe somehow when it would usually make him feel weak.
of Cap but he wasn't that desperate (close, but not quite).
Tony shifted on the chair. “The thing is, I’ve been looking for my weapons for a while now. Even before you contacted me. I have found most of them, but the ones that the Mandarin took… They have been hard to track. I’ve been hitting a dead end for a while now. But then you guys found some of them. And it gave me an idea. See, until then, I’ve been laying low. You couldn’t track anything back to me. But then I started making some noise. The Mandarin knew you involved me now. And I knew he couldn’t afford me snooping around.”
“I don’t know. You just look like a soldier.”
"What about Pepper?" Steve couldn't help but ask. He knew she was always there for Tony, and that they loved each other in their own special way.
“I’m working on it,” Steve said without looking back.
Summer was near, and heat was bearing down on Steve as he sat on a bench in Central Park, waiting for Tony. He was early, but he took that time to draw a few sketches in his notebook. He rarely found the time to draw lately, what with spending his time either with Tony or at the base.
“They are,” Steve said. “They’re also idiots,” he added.
While Natasha interrogated Johnson in the restroom, it was Steve and Clint’s jobs to watch the entrance and stop anyone from interrupting.
Steve shook his head. His hair was still ruffled and Tony resisted the urge to smooth it down. “Natasha has a theory.”
Tony leaned in and Steve closed his eyes. But just before he kissed him, Tony exclaimed, “I got it!”
Steve nodded. “Thank you.”
Steve remembered that day. What they were saying on the news. How Obadiah Stane died in an accident. Plane crash, if he remembered correctly.
“What are you talking about?” Clint asked. They were all looking at him worriedly and even though Steve let go of him before, he now reached out to take his hand in his (the gloves Steve wore prevented Tony from feeling his skin but it was still better than when Tony wore the armor).
Tony hummed. “Not as often as I would have liked. We’re both very busy people.”
He couldn't believe he was just going to wait for back-up. In normal circumstances, he would just ignore Steve and deal with Loki on his own but with Steve still being mad at him...
Tony just blinked at him for a few second. Then shook his head. “I’m sorry, can I record you saying that? Because I don’t think Pepper will believe me.”
After a moment, Steve let go. "Yeah. Just thought I remembered something."
“Oh, honey, I thought you knew better than that,” said Iron Man, the amusement clear in his voice.
he had been.
“Yes?”
“Huh,” Tony said. “I must say I’m not that surprised.”
He was staring at the gauntlet. When Tony saw him, he whispered, “Later.”
Once they were back at their quarters, Steve followed him to his room, and Tony's hopes that he won't be that mad about Tony's burst of heroism were squished to dust once he saw the look on his face.
Tony put the briefcase down and took off his sunglasses. He smiled at her. “Nice place.”
The black suit he was wearing made him very uncomfortable.
“Because he doesn't think he's good enough for you to love, yes,” she finished and Steve's heart broke. Also, the way she said the word love, so simple, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, eased something in his chest.
“Any news from Iron Man?” he asked as he got near them.
Tony will hate him and there’s nothing Steve can do about it.
“I know you will,” Steve said. He turned to look at Tony properly. “But you know this means you’ll have to join the organization now. You have no choice.”
wouldn’t get caught?” Steve countered. It was a weak argument but he couldn’t let it die.
But there was nothing he could do but watch as the face tattoo yanked his cowl off, a triumphant look on his face.
“And now they have you,” Steve continued. “And it never would have happened if I didn’t give you that information about the Mandarin. I never should have involved you in this part of my life. I never should have involved myself in your life at all.”
Tony was looking at Steve now, in wonder. Steve didn’t quite understand his look of disbelief.
"Maybe you could chill out, and follow my lead, since I'm the only one here who actually has a plan," Tony's voice was hard, unyielding, and it sounded so much like Iron Man's even without the voice modulator.
Tony waited for Steve to put the glass back on the table before speaking again. “How long was I out?”
“Oh, really?” said Iron Man and Steve could imagine the man inside raising an eyebrow.
Before she could respond, Clint joined them. “You know, man, I thought I was going to meet your boyfriend for the first time under different circumstances.”
“Well look at that,” the guy said. “He’s pretty.”
Steve clenched his jaw and stopped himself from speaking. He knew that Tony admired the guy and didn’t know what a jerk he really was. Steve was not going to burst his bubble.
Steve grinned. “Lead the way.”
Steve frowned. “He must, I don't think I'm exactly subtle.” In the beginning, when they were still learning how to be friends, Tony would even flirt with him. Flirt in a way he did with everyone, but once Steve started reciprocating, Tony would go all weird and awkward and would turn everything into some lame joke. And Tony was always talking about them being friends, and how great it was, and yes, Steve could get a hint, friend zones were a thing even in the 1940s.
"And then there was Yinsen."
Steve stood there for a second, just watching Tony work. Then Tony said, “Watch the door.”
“Well, well, well. If it isn’t America’s favorite Captain.”
“Good,” Steve said. “Anything else we need to discuss?”
But before he got to jump, the dream changed. Arms held him across the waist, but he was not mid-air. He was standing in the middle of a blurry street, as though his eyesight betrayed him - although he knew full well he had never needed eyeglasses. The arms seemed wrong to him too, though he could not immediately discern why. They were feminine hands, elegant fingers, long, red nails. Delicate yet strong, power held in them unassuming and subtle. As soon as he recognized them the streets sharpened, every shape and color coming into sharp detail.
She didn’t him finish, “You’ll never know if you don’t try.”
“What do you mean?”
She just shrugged, an unreadable smile on her face.
He didn’t really expect anything to come of it. Tony had to be a busy person, running one of the biggest companies in the country, if not the world. It was just Steve’s luck that he managed to get on his radar at all.
They all looked at each other, thinking of the possibilities with dread. Almost suddenly, they simultaneously started walking toward the building.
Maybe he should stop thinking about his life as a job. Maybe he should get a life in the first place.
But they were dealing with SHIELD here, so Steve wasn’t so sure how likely that actually was.
“I'll have you know it was plenty interesting.” Tony said. His face was blank and Steve wanted to crack it again, to see the real Tony behind the mask.
Tony smiled. “I’m an engineer, Rogers. And that armor is, like, every engineer’s wet dream. State-of-the-art, highly advanced, gorgeous color scheme if I might add,” another smile at Steve’s laugh. “Of course I’m a fan.”
They kept searching the rooms. They ran into more guards looking for them, but they dispatched them quickly enough. They were running out of time.
“I know,” Tony nodded.
But the hallway was quiet and the only thing you could hear were the lightning fast clicks of the keyboard. And Steve didn’t have any more excuses not to acknowledge it.
“Who did you love?” Tony asked.
Steve paused. He tried to think if any businessman ever, big or small, had ever asked him to call them by their first name. He didn’t have to have a perfect memory to know that the answer was
“But nothing,” Steve said.
“Tony, what are you talking about?”
Tony whirled the bourbon in his glass. He was looking down at his phone, video frozen on Morgan’s smile.
Steve would choose the good old fashioned breaking and entering any day.
“Yeah, you and me both.” Steve was excited to finally introduce Tony to his friends. He planned to bring them all together to a bar, keep everything casual and fun. He didn’t know what he was going to do now. His friends will have this as their first impression of Tony, and Tony won’t even know he met them.
“You wouldn't do that. I'm your best negotiator as well as fluent in Japanese.”
“Tony? What are you doing?” he heard Natasha ask, but it was distant. Calculation were already turning in his head, possibilities and failures. It was too much. 90 seconds.
“Whenever you’re ready,” Steve whispered. What he really wanted to say was,
“Sorry,” he resisted the urge to clear his throat again. “What were you saying?”
Steve shook his head. “He didn’t do it. Something else is at work here.”
“I haven’t had the pleasure, no,” Tony said. “But who knows. Maybe one day I’ll have a chance to pick his brain a little.”
He rebooted it manually but the arrow caused some serious damage and it would take a while to reboot. Meanwhile the stupidbots (okay so maybe the name was not the best but Tony didn't really have the time to think of a new one) were closing in on him. At least the civilians ran away. Small mercies and all that.
“Steve?” Tony asked because somehow, through all the haze, that was one clear thing, one light in the tunnel of dark memories. One thing that, despite all odds,
“Steve,” someone said, rather loudly, and Steve blinked to find his teammates all looking at him.
The face tattoo guy got impatient. He ripped the magazine out of the other guy’s hands and looked at the pages himself. Then he looked at Steve. Back at the pages. Then he laughed as well, that manic laugh you get when you can’t believe your own luck. “You’ve got to be shitting me.”
Steve stepped closer. The kiss transformed, gentle and slow, exploration in its finest form. Fingers gripped his arm, the back of his neck, strong and red. His own fingers were on a waist, cold and smooth. He wanted to tear it apart, wanted to get to Tony, get him out of the red.
So you can imagine his annoyance when Fury (once again) insisted that Tony couldn’t bring the armor for the next mission.
“Tony…” Steve was at a loss for words. But before he could find them, he heard the familiar sound above his head. He looked up expecting to see the red and gold suit and instead saw pieces of it, flying toward Tony. He watched in fascination as the pieces enveloped him until the only thing he could see was Tony’s face. Tony caught the helmet in his hand but didn’t put it on.
“Do you know where the exit is?”
“That doesn't sound like something he would do,” frowned Clint.
“Oh, so you’ve been somewhere,” smiled Clint, then high fived Natasha.
“Best weapons in the world,” murmured Clint. “We should take some for ourselves.”
And Tony resented that, he had been thinking, hence taking the gun and all that instead of rushing to the battle bare-handed and with no plan at all, but he assumed Steve would not be pleased either way so Tony kept his mouth shut (and wasn't that a miracle?).
Tony had gone with the SHIELD operatives to make sure the terrorists were put safely behind bars. He has not come back yet.
The man was surprisingly hard to track, always moving, never alone. For someone who was supposed to be an easy target, he made Steve and his team incredibly frustrated. But when they found out he would be at the gala, the opportunity was too good to miss out on.
"When I came back, all I wanted to do was shut down the weapons division at SI. But Obbie told me not to. He told me to wait, at least until things settled down. I decided to listen to him, at least until I had the solid grasp at what was happening in my company. I knew someone had to have sold my weapons illegally. I wanted to know who it was."
