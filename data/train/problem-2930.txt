Bobby glared at him. Why would the former king of Hell want help defeating members of his own kind? He knew the Bobby Singer from this reality had interacted with Crowley more than once, and that his boys had worked with him and developed a relationship that couldn’t be considered ‘trusting,’ but was at least ‘mutually beneficial to the point where they didn’t have to worry about backstabbing.’
“Look, Alastair he… He wants me to do something to you, and I’m sorry. If you can’t forgive me for this, I understand.”
A bit of hushed whispering, then, “If you let me stay with him after, don’t throw me back in this cell, if you let me stay with him to make sure he’s alright, or as alright as he can be, then I’ll do it.” Dean went silent, listening to a reply Cas couldn’t hear. “I don’t give a damn. If you want me to suffer, you gotta get me to agree to this, and being with him is the only way I will.”
“You’re right. It’s unfair that we haven’t been able to take some time to ourselves. Now that I’ve admitted--to both you and myself--how I feel, I’m realizing how much I just wanna be with you. I’m tired of fighting. So when this is all over… let’s take a break. Vacation. We deserve to have a moment alone.”
Angels don’t sleep, but damn he wanted to, and maybe the pain would be enough to let him slip under. He didn’t feel much like an angel at the moment anyway, even though he had a prominent reminder of the fact mounted on his shoulders.
Of course she was. Of course seeing her formerly deceased son in person for the first time since he’d died came second place when compared to the Winchester’s mutt padding alongside him. Miracle, his collar said, when Crowley had read it in the low light of Dean’s bedroom.
The demon he’d heard addressed as ‘Ruby’ shoved Sam into the cell, hard enough for him to lose his balance and topple.
“Sam,” Cas cut in, “if my understanding and interpretation of human slang is correct, I do believe you are still a ‘dork’ regardless of the fact that you never finished law school.”
Fingers prodded around inside him, fishing in his guts. He could feel every jab of her nails, every excruciating flare as she brushed up against exposed nerves. His stomach rolled but Sam managed to swallow.
He knew this cell better than he knew himself. Every crack and scrape in the stone, every ward carved into the bars, every bloodstain, every scratch mark on the lock from the days when he’d still been brave enough to try escaping, digging his nails into the lock in a useless attempt at picking it. Asmodeus had punished him for that by sliding needles under his fingernails and prying up, peeling them off one by one.
“We’ll figure something out,” Sam assured him. “I can research what’s been going on, contact some other hunters and see what they know, stuff like that. Once we have enough information we can make an action plan and deal with it. I’m not gonna let anyone hurt you again, okay? You’re safe here.”
Before he could consider the consequences of his actions, Dean slammed his fist into the wall and yelled “DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH HIM,” as loud as he could. His words echoed in the sparse, empty cell. His hand throbbed, but that didn’t stop him from striking the wall a second time. “I’LL KILL YOU IF YOU TOUCH HIM.”
“Yeah, Cas.” Dean stared at the ground for a moment, then looked back up, locking eyes with Cas. “I love you, the same way you love me, and I’ve been an idiot and a coward for not admitting it earlier.” He took Cas’s hands in his own, calloused fingers brushing against Cas’s skin with impossible tenderness. “I’m so sorry that it took your death for me to finally get it right.” Dean swallowed. “Let me prove it to you?”
Dean pat Cas on the shoulder. “You were right about him. He’s everything the world needed. There’s a lot of you in him.”
But he shouldn’t hope. Hoping just made it worse. He’d tried to hope years ago, in his first centuries with Asmodeus, that he would be able to escape, or that if he couldn’t get out on his own, someone would come and save him. His siblings, maybe. Castiel was never one to accept what he was told, so maybe he’d go looking, just make sure Gabriel was dead. Or maybe the Winchesters would catch a whiff of him and come looking. Maybe another Prince of Hell would gut Asmodeus (how much he’d love to see that, intestines staining that damn white suit) and then toss Gabriel out with no use for him. Or kill him.
Sam gagged as his face hit the ground, and the metallic stench assaulted him as wet puddles of blood splashed beneath him, slithering into his nostrils, under his eyelids, and into his mouth to spill into the back of his throat.
Crowley set down his now empty glass. “As a matter of fact, yes. But first, we’ll need to figure out where she is and how exactly she plans on attacking Hell. My mother has been warned of the threat and will take necessary precautions, but we should know what we’re dealing with. I happen to know of a few demons who support Abaddon. I propose we abduct one.”
They’d developed a sort of routine. When Cas woke up, he’d call for Dean, and Dean always made sure to be right there. He refused to fall asleep until he heard Cas whisper his name. Then Dean would check in on him, make sure he didn’t get hurt too bad, and Cas would either deflect and assure him it didn’t hurt too bad, with only a vague explanation of what he’d gone through, or his voice would break and he’d sob out every gory detail and Dean would try not to vomit at the thought of Cas with all his entrails pulled through his mouth or his broken bones twisted like pretzels.
“Alright, Cas and Sam are here, tell them what you told me,” Dean said into the phone and tapped the screen to put it on speaker.
“I know you’re a witch,” he grumbled, then whispered, “Do you know her?” under his breath. He shook his head and sighed. “I was really hoping to avoid, well, people like you, but I guess once you get dragged into the supernatural, it never leaves you alone. Who are you?”
Oh hell. That wasn’t real, right? He must have dreamed that. He’d woken up from the premonition earlier in this same cell, and then he must’ve fallen asleep and had a nightmare where he tortured Gabriel and… and liked it…
“So glad you asked. See, back when I was King, I started up a little project, designing a bunker of my own, but I never used it because it wasn’t perfected before my death. It’s warded against anything and everything, but it’s got a major flaw: the wards mess with telephone signals and external WiFi signals and such. I never got a chance to fix it, which means no contact with the outside world while I’m inside.”
Lighter didn’t exactly mean easier to carry. Dean took his time, careful of the wings dragging on the floor, and he stopped every time he felt Cas so much as wince.
“Apologize,” Sam snapped. “Stop blubbering and say you’re sorry. Or is that not enough? Should I go into what happened after I saved you? I nearly died to protect you and you ran away again. That’s all you ever do, run away and hope other people will solve your problems for you. I offered you a home, a purpose, and you turned your back on me. So apologize.”
He sat straight up, gasping as he woke. Nightmare, of course it was a nightmare, a horrible bloody nightmare.
For the next few hours, every time Cas made any noise, even as little as breathing too hard, the collar shocked him. How high must the voltage be to be able to hurt him?
“As you should be. I’ve just texted you the location, so come on by as quickly as possible. Oh, and before I leave…” Crowley’s tone shifted from lighthearted and casual to heavy and threatening. “Where is my mother?”
Gabriel stilled as much as he could with a rush of shakes running through him. What would be done to him for this? Sam hated him, wanted him to suffer, and yet, there Gabriel was, pressed up against him, clingy as ever. Really asking for it this time, wasn’t he?
Rolling his eyes, Sam got up and started to rummage through his closet. He didn’t have any clothes nearly small enough to fit Gabriel, so he pulled out some jeans and a shirt that on Sam was form-fitting, but on Gabriel would look like a cocktail dress. He set the clothes on the foot of the bed and made for the door to give Gabriel privacy, but Gabriel stopped him.
The stench of burning feathers smoked into the air, tangling into blood and sulfur. After all his years of Torture, Gabriel had long since gotten used to the smell of his own flesh burning, and it no longer made him gag, but something about the way hellfire scorched his wings, something evil attacking something pure and holy, assaulted his senses. The pain, the odor, the fear, it all blended together and his guts twisted, intestines knotting until he couldn’t hold it in any longer.
Gabriel begged for mercy. He heard himself laugh. And then he’d burnt up the wing, one feather at a time.
Dean’s fingers brushed over his back, nails sliding under his ragged feathers and reaching the aching skin beneath. He kneaded his thumbs into the bases of Cas’s wings.
Dean cupped Cas’s cheek and rubbed fingers into Cas’s hair as he cleaned and bandaged cuts on his head. Cas leaned into the touch, and some part of Dean wished he wouldn’t. Hate me, he wanted to scream. I’m hurting you, he wanted to cry. Despise me, he pleading in his mind without voicing the words. But Cas only nudged closer, equal parts warm and cold.
Castiel heard voices this time, low and hushed. Even with hearing far more advanced than any human’s, he only made out a few words, senses dulled by pain.
She hefted herself onto a barstool and leaned on the counter, attempting in vain to hide her labored breathing, exerted by the short walk to the bar with her… companion.
“Don’t give me that shit, Cas. I did have a choice. My dad held out for a hundred years and I couldn’t handle thirty. I didn’t have to agree. I didn’t have to torture anyone and I certainly didn’t have to like it, but I did. That’s what he talked to me about, how much I liked it… And he made me an offer to do it again.”
Gabriel heaved. Sour bile surged up, stomach acid burning his pharynx. It stung in the back of his mouth and nose as it came out, slick and bubbling, slime spilling from his mouth and splattering in a puddle in front of him.
At least Rowena made their job easier. For the Queen of Hell, she was friendly and helpful, and she never tried anything to cause problems. She even released a few souls Chuck had damned without reason, and made no complaint.
As Gabriel ran he couldn’t help but become aware of some distant buzz, a pull from a far off place, that felt far too familiar.
“Michael, what’s ‘the Empty?’ Thanks. So,” he told Rowena, “Michael says that's where angels and demons go when they die, but lately he’s been hearing the voices of siblings he said are supposed to be dead.”
Gabriel cringed and whimpered beneath him, curling in to make himself smaller and flattening his wings against his back. Sam realized then just how many places they were touching, and how terrifying that must have been for Gabriel.
He knelt beside Gabriel and set a hand on his leg. “When I’m done with you, you’ll never be able to run away again.”
No. He didn’t enjoy it. The very idea of enjoying… that sent him stumbling for the bucket and emptying his stomach into it.
At that point, Sam tightened the screws again, slashing into pale skin and raw meaty flesh, splattering blood in the ground. Tendons and sinew split and snapped, dangling in oozing strips shredded to ribbons between the spikes. Sam rotated the screws at the same time, pressing the wood closer together until he heard the scrape of metal against bone.
The flickering lightbulb dangling from the ceiling did little to ease his fear of the dark. The yellow glow cast long shadows, wavering, expanding and contracting every time the bulb stuttered. Those shadows followed him into his nightmares.
Rowena stood up and smoothed down her dress before turning to the door, but then she spun back around.
Cas considered risking the pain again to tell Dean to get his head out of his ass and cooperate, but what he heard next told him he didn’t have to.
So somehow he’d fallen asleep again. Maybe he’d been more depowered by his return to the living world than he thought, and he’d passed out without realizing it. Any minute now, he’d wake up, maybe in Sam’s bed again, and Sam would make some sassy comment about him needing to lay off the chocolate chip pancakes, and Gabriel would still be shaking with fear from the nightmare but that would wear off when he saw Sam and he would laugh at the comment and say something snarky in response. Any minute now.
“I do believe I should as well,” said Cas. “My return to this world has left me feeling quite drained, and the long journey here didn’t exactly help.”
Gabriel stood over Sam with the knife poised to strike if the demon came close to them. He summoned the scattered embers of his grace and fanned the flames with his fury till his power flickered to life, flashing blue in his irises… before fizzling out like a blown light bulb, dark and broken. Shit.
When Sam backed away, Gabriel let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, even though Sam seemed genuine enough. But he couldn’t let his guard down. Not yet. Not ever.
Sam had looked up just in time to see Gabriel go limp, no longer tense or shaking. He couldn’t stand on broken knees in the first place, but if he could drop, he would’ve.
“Well if we do find something to use, it’ll probably be you. This cell is completely empty. I can’t even see a vent, or a drain. There’s this sound though, that I started hearing about an hour ago. Like dripping. I think there’s a leaky pipe behind the walls.”
According to what Fergus had learned from Castiel and Dean, Michael had grown up a little, and had been willing to be helpful, so he could be a good ally to have.
He sucked in a gulp of air as agony electrified his veins, crackling like lightning in his blood and blurring into his own grace, where the painful voltage could brush against his true form, scattering heat and ozone across the massive expanse of his real body.
A tiny figure, soaked in blood, crawling away from him. They coughed, each hacking breath so violent it shook their whole body.
Sam squeezed his eyes shut, but the images didn’t fade out, they intensified, searing into the inside of his skull like a brand, flashing in and out in strobing light, each time closer than the last, and when the figure was close enough, Sam dropped on one knee, finding himself knelt in front of them, eye to bloody, bruised, rolling-back-into-the-skull eye. Even with all the blood and grime, he knew that face. But that couldn’t be, Sam could not be seeing his face.
Laying on his stomach, Castiel winced and groaned as he shifted again, again, trying to find a comfortable position on the cold floor. Silence buzzed in his ears as he lifted his head and dragged his limp arms from his sides, folding them at the elbows, and lowered his forehead to rest against them, shifting his face side to side until he found the least uncomfortable spot.
“Forgive me for waking you,” Cas said from the doorway, “but you should come to the kitchen immediately.”
The angelic equivalent of someone ripping off a man’s shirt and leaving him exposed in the middle of a crowd, if most of the people in the crowd were homicidal monstrosities.
“You know your defiance is just making this worse,” he sneered. “All you're doing is encouraging me to get more gruesome, and more bloody. I’ll warn you now, if you don’t say yes this time, you won’t recognize your boy toy by the time I’m done with him.”
Dean took Miracle outside, then fed him, and stumbled into the kitchen, half-drunk with exhaustion. He fumbled along the counter with fingers that couldn’t connect to his brain and by luck alone he got out the coffee maker.
Sam looked down his nose at Gabriel. How had it become so easy to reduce an archangel to a blubbering mess? If only he’d been able to do that in the past, then maybe Sam wouldn’t have gone through so many Tuesdays.
“When I woke up, I found that Alastair had done something to me that… should not really be possible. I don’t know how he did it, some sort of spellwork or something I’d guess, but when I woke up, I had wings.”
So he pushed forward, and by the time he saw the bunker, silhouetted by hazy morning light, he couldn’t fly anymore, couldn’t run. His legs felt like jelly, numb and burning, a dull ache shooting through him with every step. Gabriel leaned against the door for balance and knocked, then when no one came to the door, he kept knocking, hoping someone was home.
Before he’d been dragged to Hell, he’d spent his life under the impression that hellfire burned hot. He knew Hell as fire and brimstone, a sweltering, sulfurous inferno suffocating in smoke and sweaty bodies blistering alive in vicious red flames and viscous red blood.
Oh, right. The Empty took Cas before Jack took out Chuck, so he wouldn’t have any idea what happened. Dean and Sam exchanged a look. Cas frowned.
He tried not to picture what Cas suffered, inventing images to fit the sounds, but his imagination overpowered his will, and every time Cas cried out or yelped or coughed Dean stared into the far corners of his cell, wondering which arteries Alastair must be severing, which bones he must be breaking, and how much pain Cas must be swallowing.
After absorbing Chuck’s power, Jack had gained the ability to hear prayers. He sent angels to respond to them where he saw fit, but he never responded directly. They wanted to be a little more distant. Meddling had caused this mess in the first place, and Jack didn’t want to repeat it. But this prayer… They knew that voice just as well as they knew their own. Sam, calling out for help.
Sam turned to Asmodeus, who handed him something Gabriel had far too much experience with. A knee splitter. Shudders ripped through his body. “Please,” he mouthed, unable to produce the sound, but Sam ignored him.
The souls took to their new homes with ease, and Jack allowed their homes to shift in size, shape, and appearance according to their tastes.
He opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again, looking back and forth between Sam and Asmodeus. He exhaled a low whine from his throat.
Cas made a mental note to tease Dean about this later. “I wouldn’t mind them being visible if it were just you, but my true form, especially my wings, well they’re very private. Personal. They’re not meant to be… defiled.”
He pressed his ear against the wall. The coolness eased some of the ache in his skull. He stood in silence, breathing through his mouth so his blood-crusted nose didn’t make his breaths snuff. He waited, waited, and then heard muffled voices.
Despite the fact that the pajamas were much too big for him, Gabriel gave them a look of approval, barely giving Sam enough time to flee the room before peeling off his wet clothes.
“On the rack,” he said. “They dragged me into this cell and chained me to the rack, pinned my hands down with spikes.” Cas leaned forward and grabbed his lower leg before snapping his knee back into place with a yelp. “You know how racks work, I don’t have to explain it to you. But Alastair had his demons chain my wings, and then he kept turning that crank, and he pulled them right out of the sockets.” He popped his other knee back in the socket. “A-and then he kept going.”
But there was another demon, wasn’t there? He couldn’t remember much from that morning past Sam making breakfast, but he had flashes. A clatter, smoke, a woman.
So Sam didn’t want him to back off. He wanted him close. Of course he did, he would’ve had to come over here to sit beside Gabriel in the first place. Meaning all Gabriel had done by moving was screw up whatever plans Sam had. So Gabriel froze. If Sam wanted his obedience, he could give that. He knew to never make things difficult for his torturer.
“Thank you, Aunt Amara. Will you be staying in Heaven, or do you wanna go back to Earth? Because I can make a place for you to stay here, if you’d like.” Jack gave her a hopeful smile, still so childlike, almost innocent, even after inheriting infinite knowledge, wisdom, and power.
He couldn’t do that to Cas, couldn’t be the hand that hurt him. What if Cas became afraid of Dean? What if Dean lost control of himself and slipped back into the mindset he had in Hell, twisted joy and gory satisfaction? What if Dean went too far and gave Cas a reason to be afraid of him?
Sam strode into the cell. Even with an ear-to-ear grin, he still looked furious, brow furrowed and eyes burning with hatred. His hands balled into fists and he shot one out to curl it in Gabriel’s hair and yank, forcing Gabriel to look him in the eye, tearing a yelp from his throat.
“I’m back from the dead, mother, who else could be involved? And that is precisely why I’m here. See, I found Miracle here all alone in the Men of Letters Bunker, where Sam and the freshly resurrected archangel Gabriel should have been, but neither of them were there when I arrived.”
Seeing him struggle brought her back to the good old days, when she had him begging for her blood, shaking and hungry, a dying man, and she’d been completely in control.
He shoved the severed limb aside as Cas collapsed into him, sobbing. Dean turned Cas so they could sit chest-to-chest, and he held Cas’s head against his pounding heart. Dean ran fingers through dark hair and wished he could have been combing through feathers instead.
Dean and Crowley laughed, and Crowley used the momentary distraction to grab them both by the shoulders and send them to Vegas. Traveling felt different with a demon than what he’d used to do as an angel. Less smooth and fluid, and when they finally landed Cas’s head spun and he stumbled into Dean, who groaned and pressed a hand to his head.
“You’re in danger,” Sam forced out. “I didn’t see anyone else, only you, so I don’t know who from, but you are definitely in danger. I only saw it in flashes, and my premonitions aren’t always correct. I’ve been able to stop them actually, in the past. But after what I saw, well, we need to be careful.”
Sam looked away, like a damn coward, when Asmodeus raised the whip and snapped it across Gabriel’s blanched skin, staining him like red wine on a marble floor. Gabriel was the one who had to suffer, and Sam couldn’t bring himself to look. Did Sam not deserve the pain that came with looking, with watching the blood drip from deep cuts and spill on the floor, with listening to muffled screams choked out when Gabriel cut his tongue, with smelling the sickly odor of meat rising into sulfurous air?
“Oh he’s not alone,” Crowley said, “though I don’t know how much help his current company will be. Have you ever met the archangel Gabriel?”
Cas shook his head. He mouthed ‘No,’ over and over until a faint sob cracked off his tongue. Pain zapped him, but he hardly noticed.
Because this time, they were wings, and they burst through his skin, unfurling in knots of blood and gold and gracelight blue. The weight of them pulled him down, and his knees buckled beneath him, dropping him to the ground.
Gabriel gave him an expectant look not too different from a child standing in the candy aisle at the store, holding armfulls of chocolate bars, and staring up at the parents with giant, pleading eyes. Try as he might to resist it, Sam gave in, and he returned to his closet, where he pulled out some soft pajamas that Mary had bought for him.
Dean stared back at him, and a dog’s bark sounded from by his feet. The dog ran circles around his legs, sniffing away, but Dean just stared, stunned, mouth hanging open, eyes wide and unblinking.
All these years later, Sam found himself really understanding his brother for the first time. They’d both been to Hell, but not in the same way. For the longest time, Sam thought he’d had it worse. He’d been there longer, for one, and he’d never been offered respite.
It took Gabriel an embarrassingly long time to summon the courage to open his eyes. He shut them immediately after.
“I said you don’t have to say anyth--” Dean cut himself off and gave his brain a second to catch up with his mouth. “It’s still in? That asshole just left you here like that?”
“No, no, don’t say anything else, don’t answer any of my stupid questions. I’m gonna kill that dickwad when I get us out. Just have to find a way out. Maybe I can fake my death? But I don’t have any way to hide my pulse… I could try breaking a wall. I’d probably just break my hand but then someone would have to come in to make sure I don’t die from an infection.”
Ruby clinked her glass against his, face painted with a wicked smile as she imagined all the ways she would get Sam (and these idiot Princes) to bleed.
The next day, when Alastair came in, Dean took in a breath. Cas would get hurt either way, he knew that much, and no matter how hard he tried to distance himself from it, he’d only be delaying the inevitable. Dean held out for thirty years, once, but how long had it been now? Were they in Hell, where a month lasted ten years, or were they somewhere else? Either way, as time wore on, one of them would break, and if Dean let himself give in now, maybe he could spare Cas from shattering later.
“Why do you want Cas and Dean’s help? Don’t you already have a whole army of demons at your disposal?” Sam would prefer Dean and Cas not go off to meet Crowley at some secluded bunker of his own design where no one could get a message in or out. Even after all they’d dealt with together, Sam couldn’t trust Crowley.
Eventually he managed to get to the rack, and the only thing keeping him from vomiting now was sheer force of will driven by the fact that Dean refused to ruin Cas’s beautiful wings with his own bile.
She severed the organ with a slash of her knife, then dropped it on the floor. Sam flinched at the wet plop.
He didn’t have much time out of a cell to work with though, since it only took a few steps to reach the second cell door, right beside Dean’s. Alastair unlocked it with a keypad, covering it so Dean couldn’t see the code. But maybe he could still find a way to get it; demons left a smell behind on everything they touched after all, and Sulfur would be easy to pick up on.
The crushing weight, the ice from the sea, the magma welling up from between tectonic plates, and it could feel again.
Castiel coughed, testing his throat. The soreness had faded, and when he touched a finger to his tongue, no blood came away, so he figured he could speak without doing any further damage to his body.
He waved his hand, and the patrons and bartenders all went silent and raised their hands to their necks, voices cut off as their throats closed up against their will, tightening as Azazel clenched his fist. One by one, they dropped to the floor, smacking into the sticky wet tile. Ruby stepped over a dying woman as if she were merely a muddy puddle, and Azazel followed behind.
But the body could feel. It felt the cold, electrifying its nervous system, then the heat bubbling up from the cracks in the layers of the earth, and the pressure, the suffocating pressure of endless water, weighing down like the fate of the universe upon one’s shoulders. This body had felt that same pressure before.
He must’ve blacked out, because when Sam cracked his eyes open, the ceiling spun above him. A throbbing rattle knocked around in his head.
They opened a bottle of champagne, and even though Cas didn’t eat or drink, Dean managed to convince him to down a glass of fizzy alcohol.
Ruby and Chuck had the same idea, then. She had gotten the idea earlier, to open up the Empty for a resurrection spell, but if it was already open, this would be even simpler and she’d thought.
Even after all his years of knowing Cas, Dean still struggled to convince him to do this thing called ‘having fun,’ but he made slow progress as time went on, and indulging in a glass of celebratory champagne was part of that. Normally Dean would consider himself a booze guy, but even he would partake in his ‘human traditions.’
“Oh, is that so?” Rowena tilted her head towards the offending sign and waved her hand behind her back, casting a little spell to erase it from the wall. “What sign?” And just to be safe, she flicked her fingers toward the waitress to charm her, just a bit.
How could he ever say yes? He couldn’t bring himself to torture Cas of all people. Maybe if it were some random person he didn’t know, like the demon Crowley had abducted, he could be logical.
Ruby grimaced at his acceptance, so he must’ve mastered looking bored while being threatened with torture.
Dammit, dammit, dammit, he had to get out of the holy fire. Cas fumbled with his coat, struggling to get it off. He could throw it over the flames. He’d lose it forever in the fire, but when it came down to a coat or Dean, Cas never stopped to think. His hands seemed to be wired to someone else’s brain; his fingers couldn’t get a grip on the fabric, and by the time he finally did get it off, he didn’t get a chance to free himself.
Sam cut him off with a stinging backhand slap. “Do you ever shut up?” He leaned down, pressing his weight on Gabriel’s knee till he elicited a sobbing wail. “I know I don’t have to do this. I’m not hurting you because I have too, I’m hurting you because I want to.”
Since Dean didn’t feel hunger pains or dehydration, he figured they’d been IV feeding him, taking care of his needs while he fell unconscious to limit the interaction he had with people. He hadn’t actually seen someone’s face since that fight with the demons in Vegas, but they didn’t have him completely isolated.
He stared at the puddle of bile at the bottom of the bucket, then his eyes shifted to his fingers. Why were they covered in blood? He hadn’t really hurt Gabriel, right? Right? Just a nightmare, Sam told himself. Just a nightmare. But why did he have blood on his hands? Who’s blood--? No, no, nightmare, nightmare, just a nightmare, it wasn’t real it wasn’t real he didn’t torture Gabriel and he certainly didn’t feel any satisfaction while he did it.
“Shit,” Dean growled. “How are we gonna gank her again? I’m not getting the Mark of Cain back. I don’t know if I could, but even if I could, I'm not doing that again.” He glanced at Cas, and Sam didn’t have to guess to know Dean still felt guilty about hurting him.
When he fell, his hand crunched a frail object he hadn’t noticed till it shattered into several pieces of green glass.
She almost wanted to force-feed him some blood, just to make him go through the withdrawals, but that would just load him like a rocket launcher, filled up with all the power he’d need to kill her.
Trepsichore’s eyes blackened. “I’m not telling you shit,” she snapped, words stilted as she tried to speak with a missing lip.
He had to be alive to take care of Cas, which meant that as much as he didn’t want to, Dean had to be selfish and take care of himself before Cas.
Torture ahead, lots of fun stuff. Sam is acting ooc but there’s a reason for that, which you’ll find out in a few chapters
But Jody and Donna were still there, and they’d both hugged him, before he could get to the shower, and then he’d really be a dick if he didn’t stay and talk for a minute, so he sat on the couch with them, told them about how he and Sam and Jack had finally gotten rid of Chuck, filling in the few details Sam had omitted, and then he and Claire started talking about hunting, comparing their techniques, and damn he had to admit the kid had some skill.
What he wouldn’t give for some pie. Thinking about pie, using his imagination to picture warm, cinnamon apple chunks and a flaky crust, got Dean through the whole bowl. And what he wouldn’t give for a beer to wash it down.
Jack wanted to argue. There’s no excuse for child abuse, after all, or for any abuse, but John had clouded his eyes with his own arrogance. As if his poor parenting had somehow been harder on himself than his sons. This man didn’t deserve to stay in Heaven if he couldn’t at least admit his mistakes. Instead of arguing, they damned John’s soul.
Cas changed the subject from alcohol. “Do you have any ideas on how we might deal with Abaddon this time around?”
A spark electrified Cas, and his eyes flashed like lightning. He felt his grace again, spurred by the jolt shot through him. Pale blue glowed from under his skin, and he moved his arms to Dean’s shoulders, fitting his palm over the same place he’d left his handprint years ago. The shadows of his wings cast on the ground, and for once he didn’t care if they were damaged and broken, because Dean loved him, loved all the scattered bits of him, and he returned the same love, the same passion. Dean, his Righteous Man, loved him, and he loved Dean.
“It seems yet another angel has emerged from the Empty. He says Gabriel arrived at the bunker, a short time after we left. At the time of the message, Gabriel is unconscious, but very much alive.”
He’d have to rely on what he’d felt while trapped in that closet then. Terror, desperation, and the panic-induced realization that he had more power than he realized.
“Hey, Jack,” Sam whispered, like he didn’t want someone nearby to hear. “I know you said you didn’t want to get involved with stuff on Earth but… but this is bad.” Jack frowned. Sam’s voice sounded strained with agony. “The Empty is ruptured. Dead angels and demons are coming back. Demons got me and Gabriel, and I think they have Dean and Cas too.”
Sam sank back into the dream and reached out, but the figure scrambled away from his outstretched hand and struggled to stand, then ran for a door that hadn’t been there before, leaving behind crimson footprints.
Dean stared down at his hands. They really were shaking, slight tremors running through his fingers, only held still by Cas’s touch, solid and grounding and the only thing keeping him on Earth and out of Hell.
Bobby nodded. He should contact other hunters now, so that by the time the hellhounds found Dean and Cas, he could send in an army to save them. Jody, Donna, Charlie, Garth, everyone. He wouldn’t take any chances.
Something soft ran over him. The source of the warmth. He felt it pulsing like a heartbeat and he nudged a little closer to it, soaking it in. The warmth ran over him in slow, light strokes over his hair, then moved down to his shoulders and arms. It slid under his wings to brush against his feathers, but avoided the bleeding ones on the outer side of his wings, as well as his excruciated back and shoulders, skating away from sources of pain.
Gabriel snatched Sam’s knife from under his limp fingers and clung to the handle with a reverse grip till his fingers went white. “Piss off, bitch. I happen to be having a very bad day right now, so trust me when I say you don’t wanna tick me off any more than I already am.”
“No, no, not that.” The skin had ripped, tendons snapping from strain, and muscle had torn, leaking hot blood down his back, but they hadn’t come off. “They’re bleeding, but they weren’t severed. I’d put them back in, like I’m doing with my legs--” he cut himself off to ram his femur into his pelvis and whimpered-- “but I can’t reach.”
Swallowing another groan, he redistributed his weight to eliminate as much contact as he could, though the wings were too large to avoid touching them.
Her hands slid under his rib cage. Sam’s heart pounded, sending blood pumping over the edges of his opened skin. He grit his jaw, teeth grinding together, and he forced himself to swallow a scream alongside another nauseous wave of rising, sour vomit. Her fingers hooked like talons around his kidney, and she squeezed. Sam tensed up and a low whine stirred in the back of his throat. She tugged on the organ, pulling it away from the ribs it hid behind, and she burrowed back into his insides with her knife.
Hell had its moments of quiet, but they never lasted long, always shattered when some demon cackled or some soul screamed. Some methods of torture, like electric saws and meat grinders, made quite a bit of noise while in use. The tap of dripping blood could sound like a roar in these echoing halls.
“You’re so lucky you don’t have to worry about heart failure,” Sam sighed as he sat down at the table to eat.
“I gagged your angel,” Alastair informed him. “He’s growling at me now, but he can’t say a damn word unless he wants to slice his tongue off.”
Ruby’s eyes flicked black as she glared. “If you felt like you’d just been hit by a bus you’d be drinking too.”
Sam groaned and dragged his fingers through his tangled hair. He really needed a shower. And so did Gabriel, who looked like he’d been dragged through mud by his ankles.
If the wings hadn’t started rotting, Dean could’ve tried to sew them back on, but Alastair would notice at once and make him cut them back off.
Did Gabriel do some messed up shit to Sam and Dean? Yes. Had Sam forgiven him? Not entirely. But did he deserve to be beaten and peeled and flogged and… No. He didn’t.
Azazel checked his phone, which he’d hooked up to a small, undetectable camera watching Sam in his cell.
Gabriel whimpered through his teeth at the memory and curled his fingers, hiding his nails by digging them into his palms.
Jack set his plan into motion, beginning the operation to save his family. This time, instead of sending an angel to do his bidding, they contacted and sent a demon.
“My name is Castiel Winchester,” he told himself, voice raw and ragged from where it had been torn up by the salt grating like sandpaper against his throat. “My name is Castiel Winchester. I’m an angel of the Lord. And I’m going home.”
He’d gone soft, hadn’t he? Why did he give enough of a damn if Sam was alright to put himself at risk like this?
So Dean was alive, and safe, in the bunker with his dog. He smelled like beer, but that was no different, and he looked like he’d showered and shaved recently, so Sam must be fine too.
A time came after that where death would’ve been the preferable option. Empty sounded nicer than Hell. At least it was quiet…
No, he could not be here again. Not back in the same cell, the very place he’d been stripped of everything that made him who he was, shattered beyond repair with nothing left to hold onto. He couldn’t be back in this place, bound and helpless, he couldn’t.
“You want revenge,” Ruby breathed. The very idea of vengeance left a sweet taste on her tongue, tantalizing, and she needed more.
“I’ve wondered a few times,” he said, “if raising my boys in the life had been a bad idea. I mean, guns and ghouls ain’t the best way for a kid to grow up. Always moving, always fighting, outside the law.” John stopped to take a sip of his fifth heavenly beer. “But then I look at all the things they did. Stopping apocalypse after apocalypse, that took some real grit. I gave those boys that grit. Me. All those lives saved, because I sacrificed my fatherhood for them.”
He pinched himself, nails digging into his skin, just a little too tight and breaking skin, but that had to be enough to wake him up.
He twisted the orange foam, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger till it narrowed down to a thin line. He stuck the plugs in his ears and they swelled up, blocking out the nighttime sounds of the bunker:
Heavy warded links seemed to tighten, squeezing into the feathers like a boa constrictor strangling its prey.
Clarence? Dean only knew of one demon who called Cas by that name, a demon who should be dead, but then again, the Empty had an open wound and a lot of demons that should be dead had stopped being dead.
It took Cas an embarrassingly long time to reach the bunker, but in his defense, he’d awakened on the west coast, washed up on the shores of California, and he had to travel all the way to Kansas. Plus, exhaustion slowed him down, and he barely felt his grace.
“No, you don’t get to be afraid. This is everything you deserve. Hell it’s less than what you deserve after all you’ve done. To me, to my family.” He finally let go of Gabriel and paced around the cell. “You forced me to watch my brother die, over and over again, a hundred times, listening to that same damn song every time. You know I still flinch every time I hear it. You did that to me. You made me fear a song of all things. I wanted to forgive you, I tried to forgive you, especially when you sacrificed yourself for us, but then it turns out you didn’t?”
Dean nodded. He knew Cas could take it. Cas had gone through Hell, after all, just to protect Dean. He was a certified badass. But just because Cas could handle it didn’t mean he should have to. Had Cas not earned his peace? He shouldn’t be here, maimed and bloody on the floor, he should be back home with Dean, the two of them in the Bunker together with Miracle draped across them.
Crowley rolled his eyes at the mutt. “Once I’ve figured out who betrayed you and we’ve thoroughly punished them, I propose you pick one Winchester-angel pairing to rescue, and I’ll take the other. Those boys and their boyfriends will owe us bigtime for saving their asses.”
He shrugged. “We have similar goals. See, the Winchesters took something from him too. From my understanding, he had an archangel--yeah, you heard me right--under his control. A little pet birdie, and he fed on its grace. That archangel is with Sam, weak and damaged, just like you’re feeling now.” Ruby glared, and he rolled his eyes. “Relax, you’ll get back to your old self soon enough. Point is, Sam is stuck babysitting a powerless archangel that my brother wants back, and if we take them both, we all get what we want. We get our revenge.”
He listened to Gabriel ramble about how he really did die, but then he came back, and Sam knew it couldn’t possibly be coincidental that Cas, Crowley, and now Gabriel had come back to life, emerging from the Empty. He saw it. He saw Gabriel in excruciating detail, damaged and broken, eyes dazed and glazed over in a white-rimmed haze of terror, far too similar to how he’d looked when curled up in the corner after his rescue from Asmodeus. And if that really was a glimpse from the future…
Jack had the souls reexamined, and told the angels to bring a select few down to Hell. Chuck had made exceptions for people who shouldn’t have been allowed past the gates. Not very many, less than ten, but only one name stuck out to Jack. John Winchester. Who dragged his sons into a life of pain and vengeance, and who had no remorse for it.
Dean took a breath. He pressed his hand into Cas’s back in a futile attempt to provide some comfort. He could feel Cas shaking. Dean whispered a thousand apologies as he pressed the knife into Cas’s wing, but they would never be enough.
She didn’t come alone. Of course she didn’t come alone. What kind of idiot would try to break into the Bunker and kidnap Sam Winchester while working alone? But before Gabriel could locate the accomplice, most likely a second demon, and spill their guts, a heavy weight cracked against the back of his head. Gabriel dropped to his knees beside Sam.
Meanwhile, oblivious to Sam’s crisis, Cas had to physically restrain Dean from giving Crowley what he called a ‘Colombian necktie.’
So Jack had dismantled every wall, using Chuck and Amara’s powers to reshape bleak hallways into grassy meadows dotted in flowers; trees and mountains sprouted from the ground and sailed towards the sky, which Jack filled with clouds and sunlight and stars. As much as he loved Chuck’s designs for Earth’s constellations, he thought Heaven could use its own unique sky, so he spent some time rearranging the stars into new lines.
His scalp stung from the weight of filth in his hair, his teeth hurt from where he ground them together, his nose burned with sulfur, tears scratched at his eyes. Pain assaulted him from every direction, no matter how hard he tried to pretend he could take it. The ground scraped his skin. Bruises throbbed. The feeling of too much all at once weighed down on him, too heavy to let him move, assuming he’d be able to move at all with the amount of broken bones he had.
Instead, he chopped Cas’s wing off. Blood gushed from the wound, drenching him in hot, sticky scarlet tinged pale blue.
Sam barely remembered to turn the stove off. He staggered to the sink and tugged at the faucet till a spray of frigid water splashed into his hands. He scrubbed the water over his face, the temperature grounding him. Sam swallowed and stayed there for a moment, counting along with his breaths, till he heard the knock yet another time.
Gabriel woke up to both the foreign sensation of warmth and the familiar sensation of agony, both flaring across sensitive nerves. Not fully awake, he didn’t register the source of the warring feelings, he just shied away from the cold, burying himself into heat in hopes that it would shelter him from his pain.
“Fine.”Alastair slammed the cell door, as he always did, and Dean only had a few minutes of silence before he heard Cas groan and wail in agony.
Nausea spurred by disgust and fear kept Dean’s hunger at bay for a while, though as each hour crawled on, Dean found his stomach rumbling and aching with need. Dehydration soured and dried his tongue, and the few times he tried to stand up or exercise for something to do ended in his vision blackening and Cas whining in worry.
“Calm down lad.” Rowena leaned forward. “I’m not here to cause any trouble, and I certainly don’t mean you any harm, not that you’d have any trouble with me if I did. I may be a witch, and a damn good one, but just look at who you’ve got riding shotgun! That being said, I’m gonna need to talk to your roommate, if you don’t mind sending him out.”
If they’d fed him more than just a tray of something he wasn’t sure was really food shoved under the door every other day, he’d vomit. Instead, he got up, pacing circles around the room, and tried to breathe.
Hellfire isn’t red, for one, it’s blue. Sulfur burns blue, and reeks of rotting eggs, the stench nearly as powerful as the odor of offal rot.
Sam tried to hide it when Cas came back, but he’d been needing to go to bed for hours. His headache still hadn’t eased up, and he allowed himself a trip to the bathroom to grab a plastic bottle of pills, unscrew the child-safe top, and pour a few painkillers into his hand. He popped them all into his mouth at once. Normally Sam would just dry swallow, but he thought some water might help the headache, so he washed the pills down with a long swig from a paper cup he filled with icy, filtered tap water from the bathroom sink.
His fear of punishment for disobedience overpowered his fear of cold, yellow eyes, and he dragged his gaze off the floor and set his eyes on the open cell door, where he saw two familiar figures: Asmodeus, and Sam.
Ruby pressed her thumbs into her temples, rubbing small circles into her throbbing skull. “What do you think?”
So Michael had been alive before the Empty started bleeding, probably resurrected by Jack after all of that business with Chuck trying to end the world.
When they were alone, Dean drank half the water in the bottle and kept the other half to make holy water with the rosary. With lack of a better hiding place, he slipped the chain over his neck and stuck it in his shirt. Dean then ate the… food? It tasted bland, which Dean guessed was better than tasting bad, though he didn’t know how much he’d notice a bad taste with his current hunger. Cas had to whack him about four times to remind him to eat slower so he wouldn’t damage his stomach.
“Oh shut up, Stanley. You don’t run this place,” the waitress sassed. “Besides, could be a service dog, don’t be rude.”
Once free, or as free as he could get under the circumstances, Cas fell backward into Dean’s waiting arms. He gasped, wings twitching, and Dean adjusted his grip, attempting not to irritate broken bones and burnt feathers.
“Alright angel, let’s get that bridle off. I want Dean to really hear it when you start screaming.” Metal clinked and clattered on the floor. Cas coughed.
Sam had burned Gabriel’s wing up. If Cas’s wings were anything to go by, that would never heal. Sam did that. Sam did that to him, and some twisted piece of him had liked it, hungered for it.
Ruby folded her arms. “It’s clever, I’ll admit, linking his mind to a shifter,” she said, glancing at the shapeshifter across the room costumed in Sam’s skin, “but I was hoping for something a little more hands-on. I wanna make that bastard bleed after all the shit I had to go through because of him. I had to let him drink my blood. Do you know how gross it feels to have someone’s tongue flapping around in your open wounds?”
He heard shuffling, a grumble, a metallic rattle. Another shout, then a mocking laugh. A weight slammed down and a groan.
Of all the things Sam had expected to do today, he’d never even considered that he would have ‘babysit an archangel… again’ on the top of his list. And to make it worse, he’d seen Gabriel’s face, moments before hearing his knock on the door. The headache had faded, but not the over-bright, sharpened flashes of blood and burns on Gabriel’s waxy skin.
Stupid question. Of course it hurt, he’d burned Gabriel’s wing up with a hellfire blowtorch until the feathers had shriveled and crumbled to bloody ash, leaving behind a skeletal frame spattered with clustered black feathers clinging, desperate, to the bones, too stubborn to break away and fall. How could that not be absolutely agonizing?
“I have a text from Sam,” said Cas as he checked his phone. He read through it, then read it again. “Oh.”
Warmth and softness cocooned him. Pillow, blanket. Bed, maybe, or couch. But Gabriel didn’t give a damn where he lay. He could’ve been sleeping on an anthill and he wouldn’t have noticed anything beyond the thick veil of sleep.
“Yeah. He was alright, for an angel. He died in the fight to get my people out of our world, but I guess he’s back too, huh?” Bobby scratched his beard. At least Sam had someone, but companionship wouldn’t be enough if Sam’s old wounds reopened. “Still, my point stands, Sam and Hell is a bad combination. You find my boys, and don’t you dare lose them Crowley, or I will spill your guts myself.”
At half the speed he used while moving away, Gabriel crawled back towards Sam, stiffened by tension that wanted to latch him in place. He pushed through, untangling fear from his limbs long enough to drag himself back into place.
Crowley paused for dramatic effect. “In case you’ve forgotten, I died.” Sam rolled his eyes and bit back a comment about missing the silence. Crowley, oblivious to Sam’s expression, said, “That presents us with a question. How did I, and others, including Feathers, come back?”
One young man, seated all the way in the back, fixated her with a glare. Judging from the powerful energy radiating off of him, the skinny young man would be none other than Michael. Taking the waitress’s offer to sit anywhere, she approached his booth in the back corner and perched on the end of a red seat made of fake leather.
A jolt of pain flaring through Castiel cut him off with a choked gasp. He groaned, and at the sound, another burst of pain ripped into him. It didn’t take him much longer to figure out that the pain had come from voltage, high enough to kill a horse, zapping into his body. To test it, he made one more odd noise in the back of his throat, and the voltage struck once more.
“It’s okay,” he whispered. “I’ve got you. Whatever it takes, I’ll find a way to protect you. I’ve got you.”
It couldn’t surrender to death, it couldn’t drown. It thrashed, it clawed at inky saltwater, it opened its mouth to scream with air it didn’t have in its lungs. It could not sink again, it could not fall again, it could not die again.
“It seems that I’m right about one thing then. I’ve managed to piece together that several beings who should be peacefully asleep in the Empty are coming back, and the more powerful the being is, the larger the body of water they wake up in. That being said, you’ll never guess who crawled her way out of the middle of the Atlantic.”
Gabriel nearly lost his footing when the door swung open, revealing Sam Winchester in all of his exhausted, bedheaded glory.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean whispered, ignoring Alastair. “I really don’t wanna do this… It’s gonna be okay though,” he promised. “We’ll work it out, we always do.” To get his message across, he ran his fingers up and down Cas’s arms, hoping his touch would drive it home. “C’mon, I guess we should get this over with.”
Sweat beaded out on his ash-white skin. His lungs compressed and he couldn’t get any air in. Tears stung his eyes. His whole body shook, and if he were standing his knees would give out and send him crashing to the floor. His fingers, slick with his own vomit, did give out, scraping on stone. Skin broke and acidic bile stung his cuts. When he dropped fully to the ground, making no effort to hold himself up, his wings pulled against their chains.
These hands had beaten Gabriel bloody, carved deep gouges into his skin, ripped his wings out of his body, and then burned one of them up. These hands had become weapons, instruments of torture in their own right. He couldn’t let himself hurt Gabriel again, so he turned to face the wall and balled his hands into fists, layering his fingers and thumbs incorrectly in a way his father had told him to never do, lest he break his fingers.
“I have a source who’s informed me where Sam and Dean have been staying, and he’s had someone watching the place. Last I was updated, Sam is living in a bunker in Lebanon, Kansas, and his brother left. Sam is unprotected.”
Dean had to wrap an arm around Cas to hold him still. Both wings fluttered as well as they could with all the damage done to them. Even broken and burned, they still had surprising force behind them, and Dean was sure he’d have a few bruises later from all the times they smacked into him.
Dean selected a knife. A small, simple blade, but simple got the job done best, as he’d learned after forty years in Hell. Serrations added to the pain, but the knife would just get stuck, which Dean didn’t want. Alastair had tortured with brutality, but Dean preferred the opposite. Clean cuts, precision, like the bite of a piranha, their teeth so well designed for slicing that most victims of their bite didn’t know they’d been bitten until the pain kicked in.
It would turn ugly, at some point. It always did. Gabriel didn’t have to think about that just yet though. He prepared himself for it, always reminding himself not to fall for it.
Once they’d come out of the sockets, Alastair kept turning the crank until his flesh split open with a rip of agony and Cas sobbed as well as he could with his jaw forced shut and his tongue bleeding, all the while Dean shouted for him, demanded Alastair leave him be until Alastair finally unlocked the bridle and dropped it aside.
When Ruby slammed the door behind her, Sam turned his head and shifted just enough to keep himself from choking. He heaved, and sour bile spilled onto the floor.
Dean took a handful of salt and shoved it into her mouth, scraping the grains against her oozing flesh. She hissed and thrashed against her binds, choking out, “You’ll get nothing from me, nothing.” So Dean sliced off her bottom lip.
It shouldn’t be physically possible, but somehow, before he woke from the bullet that knocked him out, Alastair had carved his back in the right way, and when Cas came to, he’d known without looking what had happened. Cas had summoned the courage to turn his head and open his eyes, only to find himself met with the sight of ragged, charred wings hanging limp off his back and spilling sooty, bloody feathers on the floor.
“By the way,” Ruby called back as she approached the cell door. She had it open, and stood halfway out before swiveling on her heel to face him again. “If you’re hungry,” she gestured to his severed kidney on the floor, “that’s all you’re getting today. Or tomorrow, or the next day. So savor it.”
Alastair tossed a knife. It bounced, point first, off Cas’s back and clattered on the ground. Dean shot a glare at the demon, but Alastair only answered with a grin, motioning for him to get on with it.
He’d woken up hours ago in the middle of the damn ocean, and to his luck, it just so happened to be storming, so he couldn’t see anything unless a bright flash of lightning lit up the waves around him. Gabriel, on instinct, went to flap his wings to take himself literally anywhere else, but he could only carry himself about a mile before he gave out and splashed back into the ocean. Okay, not a problem. Trickster powers time… and that didn’t work either. He couldn’t summon one tiny motor boat to get the hell out of here?
Cas jolted with pain, and Dean grabbed his shoulders to steady him as he gasped and shuddered. Dean nudged him to lie down, and for a moment he imagined sawing through the collar with one of the suture needles, but this wasn’t a damn spy movie, this was Hell, real Hell, and things didn’t work like that here. So instead, he tried to get Cas comfortable so he could treat his wounds. After he ate and drank, of course.
Since he didn’t want to keep breathing in that horrendous stench, he’d gotten up to clean it, and since he was already up, he’d figured he should take a shower and grab a beer.
“I have a name, you know,” the shifter snapped with a perfect imitation of Sam’s bitchface and ‘I-went-to-college-so-obviously-I’m-smarter-than-you’ sass voice.
“Shut the hell up,” Sam snapped and cut him deeper. The knife’s edge scraped his bones. “For once in your life, just shut up. Honestly I liked you better when you had your mouth stitched shut.”
His demon lackeys had grabbed Cas by the arms and dragged him into another cell. He tried to fight back, but he could hardly move with excruciating pain shooting through his back and shoulders, and that didn’t even cover how the wings themselves felt.
“Shaking him won’t do anything,” said a woman’s voice. “Shame he went down so fast, I’d hoped to say hello.”
Being used to the pain didn’t make it hurt any less though. A high pain tolerance didn’t do shit when his senses were on overdrive, nerves fired up and far too sensitive to the point where everything hurt, even things that shouldn’t.
Beneath it, the earth shifted, and tectonic plates split open with a burst of magma, light, and color, and heat scorching through the water to scald the body as gravity pulled it through red and gold, through black, through searing fire, through darkness, through light, through nothing, through everything, towards the core of the earth, towards the surface of the earth, dragging it up and down, left and right, as it struggled and screamed, fighting against the burning in its lungs, its full lungs, its empty lungs, its screaming lungs--
So who’s blood coated his hands, and why did he have the same headache he always got after waking up from a vision?
He kept a mental count of every time he heard the lash crack. Far too long later, he got into the thousands before he remembered that the whip had several strands, so there would’ve actually been more lashes than he’d counted.
Maybe he was being childish, but he didn’t really want to cover himself for the sake of warmth, because he didn’t feel cold, he felt exposed. As if in the dark corners of the cell, something watched him with invisible eyes, a wolf (or in this case, a hellhound) sizing up a clueless fawn, unantlered, alone, and defenseless.
Dean never thought he would have a dog. It seemed like part of that “apple pie life” he could never have. A life completely dependent on him, like a kid. Dean had tried being a father before, with Lisa, and that failed. He tried to help out with Jack, after getting over what Jack was, and at least Jack turned out great, though that was mostly Cas’s work, the one who raised him, protected him, believed in him.
Dean reached up, straining on the tips of his toes, to reach the shackles. He unlatched them and pried the metal apart. The shackles opened with a spurt, splattering Dean in Cas’s blood. Dean looked a little closer, and noticed the spikes lining the inside. No wonder Cas had so many cuts on his wrists, with those damn things ripping his skin to the bone.
“That’s right, Adam,” she corrected. “Several angels and demons have come back from the dead, my son being one of them. In some cases it’s a cause for celebration; Castiel is alive, if you didn’t know. Alive, but in need of help, I’ll get to that in a moment. And, Michael, so is your brother. I guess that doesn’t narrow it down, does it? Gabriel, I mean, is alive again.”
She set down the empty bottle. Ruby admitted her curiosity to herself, but feigned indifference to the demon beside her. She leaned back. “Is that so?”
He flinched against the wall, a little too hard; his burned wing smacked against the stone, shooting pain up his bones.Gabriel swallowed a groan, and clamped his eyes shut, but when no kick to the ribs demanded he get up or shut up, he risked a look.
As much as Bobby didn’t want to work with Crowley, he’d get over it if it meant saving them. The Winchester boys had gone to Hell and back, literally, to save their world, and then they’d gone on to save the people in Bobby’s world. He’d grown fond of them, and had even started to feel like a father to them as time went on, a feeling now intensified by a protective urge to keep them away from any and every kind of harm.
Rowena hummed, thinking. “I’ve only informed a few of my most loyal of her resurrection and your mission to combat her so far. My forces are amassing, but I haven’t told them why.”
“Really, Samuel,” Asmodeus sighed, “I can’t seem to comprehend why you’d ever try so hard to protect that pathetic excuse for an archangel. You know, he confessed to me, all the things he did to you a few years back, when I had him caged the first time. Confessed everything, actually,” he chuckled, “every single bad deed ever done, like a wretched little sinner spilling his heart out to a priest.”
He must’ve passed out, because when he opened his eyes again, he didn’t feel the chains, and no one joined him in the cell.
It took the wings much longer to pop out. His bones stung, striking his nerves as they clung in desperation to his body before finally giving way.
“If you’re done abusing this building,” said Crowley, “we should discuss a proper way--that doesn’t involve me losing the security deposit on this hotel room--to rescue your idiot sons from demons.”
By the way Dean’s voice broke in the middle, barely concealing a ragged breath wetted in tears, Cas figured out the full extent of the offer. Chills rippled through his skeleton, icing the edges of every bone.
Jack agreed to meet her the next day, but he had one more thing to do before he could consider his interventions complete. Jack recreated Amara’s vessel, rebuilding her atom by atom. They took care to make sure no detail went unchecked, even down to the stitching on her black dress. Jack set two fingers against her vessel’s forehead.
“Yes,” Cas assured him. “My grace has just been feeling drained since I got back. It’s been getting better by the day though. When I first woke up, I couldn’t even feel it, like there was something smothering it. I have enough to heal you of small injuries though, that’s no problem. It’ll just tire me out.” He reached for his coffee mug and took several swallows.
Now that would have its benefits. Ruby had heard rumors of certain rituals and spells requiring components from angels. Blood or grace, usually, but a rare few called for feathers. In fact, she knew of one particular summoning spell that required angel feathers, shards of a true form containing enough power to pull someone back from the dead--even if that dead person was in the Empty.
A vicious headache cut off Sam’s thoughts, and he gripped his head with an agonized groan as pain tore through his skull. Wet heat trickled down his face. More blood, leaking from his nose, as if his brain were overheating to the point of melting and the residue had nowhere to go but out, out, out, Sam had to get out, he had to get out of this place, away from the blood and the screams and the meat hooks and the nightmares and--
A door opened and slammed shut. A new voice spoke, and Dean’s blood turned to ice water. “Clear out.” Alastair. “I’ve always wanted to test out my skills on an angel.” Cas. Alastair had Cas on the rack.
Cas reddened. “I am concerned for you, but, ah, we haven’t had much time to ourselves lately. I mean, I just came back from the dead, I think I’ve earned a moment of quiet to just be with you, have everything I was never able to have before. But all we get is one night together before we’re thrown right back into the fight? Just another apocalypse to get in the way,” he sighed. “I know this will sound childish of me, but it’s not fair. We deserve peace, a break, just a few seconds of silence to revel in the victory, but all we get is another emergency.”
Dean couldn’t do that to him. He held out twice every day, both times he received the offer. He could count the days now, keep track of passing weeks by sessions of torture.
Before Dean could say anything, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Dean fished it out while drinking his coffee, much more carefully this time, and nearly choked. “Son of a bitch.”
When Asmodeus had stolen his grace, they’d linked, and they had the ability to sense one another, like a GPS or a homing signal. But that wasn’t possible, Gabriel killed Asmodeus in a blaze of fire. Asmodeus could not be alive. And yet, Gabriel had died too, gutted by his own brother, and here he was.
Gabriel found himself clinging to the hope that maybe, just maybe, he could get out with at least one wing intact.
She glowed gold for a moment before her eyes flicked open and cast deep, powerful shadows. Jack felt Amara separate from his body. He felt better after, actually, like she’d been taking up too much room, overfilling him.
Cas and Dean shared a look, but Cas decided it was probably best if Crowley understood what they’d been dealing with lately, so they filled him in with what Dean called the “Sparknotes version,” whatever that meant. After they’d explained to Crowley everything that had happened since his death, including Jack, the Princes of Hell, the apocalyptic alternate universe, Jack and Mary getting stuck in said universe, Gabriel’s survival and pretty much immediate death, the evacuation of the Apocalypse World, Lucifer’s death, Other Michael’s possession of Dean, Jack’s loss and eventual regain of his powers, the gates of Hell opening, Rowena's ascent to the throne of Hell, Michael’s return and betrayal, Cas’s deal with Empty, the whole Billie situation, the fact that they’d took down Chuck himself, and other such information, Crowley stared at them, mouth open.
He’d been tortured by the devil himself, he could handle a demon with a knife. Sure it would hurt like hell, but he had a high pain tolerance now, developed after centuries of having his entire body pulled apart and stitched back together on repeat, so whatever Ruby planned on doing to him now? He could just breathe through it and wait it out. Maybe he could even hold off a scream; wouldn’t that be satisfying, to watch her frustration increase as he gave her nothing but silence.
“Look at me, not him. Apologize for everything you did to me. For traumatizing me, for abandoning me, for lying to me, for only coming back when you needed help with your petty revenge scheme. And then you got yourself killed again. I could have used your help you know, but no, we needed an archangel and you weren’t there so Dean had to let Michael possess him. I almost lost my brother again because you weren’t there, so fucking apologize!”
Maybe he could use his feet. Asmodeus had kicked him half to death on more than one occasion, stomping on his ribcage till it inverted and crushed his organs, snapped bone shards spearing through his lungs and left him hacking up blood for hours. On days like those, Gabriel cursed the fact that he couldn’t die so easily.
“It’s a spell,” Azazel filled in, “for forcing an angel, or in this case an archangel, to manifest their wings. It also dampens and binds their grace to diminish the damage that seeing an angel’s true form would normally do.”
One of them even offered to let Cas borrow his phone, in case there was someone Cas could call to help him out and offer him a place to stay. He almost accepted the offer, but… But what if Sam, Jack, and Dean hadn’t survived? The world was alive and flourishing, so Chuck must’ve been dealt with, but at what cost? What did they have to sacrifice to succeed? And when the human offered his phone, he couldn’t help but imagine it ringing, ringing, and then going to voicemail.
His hands appeared in front of him, clinging to wet sand as he hauled himself from the water to heave and vomit up half an ocean onto the shore, the salt and stomach bile burning his throat. With his lungs and stomach clear, he could crawl, hauling his wet form across the sand, fragments of seashells dashed against the rocks by the waves digging into his palms.
“Do you mind?” he mumbled, presumably to Michael. “Not gonna happen. He can hear you through me, so just say what you have to say.”
How odd, that Bobby had gone from fighting and killing angels to fighting tooth and nail to save one.
And he didn’t just feel that for Sam and Dean; Bobby had begun to see Cas as a son as well, even if the angel was about as old as Earth, but he didn’t have a real father caring for him, so Bobby had taken on the role.
“I did some digging to figure out what happened since my death, and wow it’s been a lot. One almost-apocalypse after another it seems, and every single time, there’s always been one name at the center. Winchester.”
Jack watched them explore, settle, and thrive with the same sense of joy animal rehabilitators must feel releasing birds back to the sky after scrubbing oil from their wings and mending their wounds.
If Dean were more patient, he might’ve started with an arm or leg and moved to more painful areas as time went on, but he just wanted to know Abaddon’s plans and current location so they could deal with her and Dean could go home with Cas. So Dean, impatient, started with the face.
Yes, his information about the Empty and a bunch of demons and angels coming back to life had been useful, but Bobby hadn’t had any interest in working with the little weasel until he’d informed Bobby that Sam, Dean, and Cas had been abducted.
It took Cas an embarrassingly long time to figure out what exactly had set Dean off. When they arrived at Crowley’s bunker, Cas kissed Dean on the cheek, not realizing Crowley was right by the door, staring at them.
Sam caught Gabriel when he fell and lowered them both to the floor. Gabriel coughed and spat out blood, splattering it on Sam, but didn’t wake up. He lay there, limp, as Sam tried to arrange him into a more comfortable position with his back and wings facing upward. He didn’t react at all to Sam’s touch, not even when he ran his fingers through Gabriel’s hair.
The gold hues burnt out, and deep, inky black infected his feathers, spreading like a sickness. He’d only seen this once before, in Castiel. When angel feathers came into contact with hellfire for long enough periods of time, they’d lose their natural coloration (white for angels, gold for archangels) and turn black, stained.
Sam had dove down on instinct with no regard for how the movement would affect his body, too focused on shielding Gabriel from a brutal whipping. When his hands hit the ground, he may as well have plunged them into fire, and his abdomen wrenched in the wrong way, spiking from where he’d lost his kidney.
Gabriel made the mistake of trying to move. He whimpered and froze, holding himself still for a moment until he let himself move again, at a fraction of the speed, adjusting himself to lie down without as much pain.
Gabriel paled. Sam would never torture someone, would he? Not unless they really deserved it, but Gabriel did deserve it.
Cas sipped from the mug and Dean barely blew on the coffee before he started chugging it, remembered a little too late that it was fresh and therefore scalding, and coughed, but in stubborn Winchester fashion, he swallowed anyway, burning his mouth and tongue.
Ruby hung back while Asmodeus and Azazel went to perform their spellwork. She didn’t really care about watching them torture Gabriel, she just wanted to see Sam’s reaction. Ruby pulled out her own phone, tapped into the live feed, and watched Sam while he slept through the dark, grainy lens.
When he lost the ability to hold his hands in a fist, he beat them in wet, flopping smacks into the wall, ramming his palms and the sides of his hands until he heard the bones crunch.
Bobby spent the next half an hour chasing Crowley around the hotel room, shouting obscenities that could make a sailor blush, and demanding that Crowley delete the photo. He laced in a few colorful threats such as “I’ll feed you your teeth,” and “I am this close to making hotdogs with your intestines,” before the hotel guests in other rooms called the cops.
“I know.” Cas reset his other hip and dropped his hands to his sides. He turned back over and lay down on his stomach, panting. “I should be fine, I just need to rest. I’ll be ready for our escape soon enough. Speaking of which, do you see anything that could be of use? This cell is mostly empty, save for the rack, but I’m not quite sure what I could do with that. Attempt to break the chains off, maybe?”
“He’s alive?” The whisper that came from Adam’s mouth sounded so unlike him despite being the same voice. Quiet, hesitant, coated in a forced apathy, as if it were afraid to care too much. This must be Michael.
“Let's get to business,” Crowley said from the opposite end of the room, carefully avoiding the devil’s trap, plus the holy water and salt he’d provided Dean with for the sake of getting information.
His breath and pulse quickened, and he tried to stand up and run, but something rattled on the ground and his legs jolted under him, dumping him on the sticky floor.
“I’m sorry, Cas, I’m sorry. It’ll be over soon,” Dean promised as he cut through his angel’s wing. His fucking wing.
He’d abandoned Sam and Dean and Cas and their cause too many times, but at least now he wouldn’t be running again.
Sam waited for the cell door to slam and lock before he dragged his feet under him and, using the wall to support his weight, he stood up. Pain flared up in his gut and he froze, stopping to breathe until it passed. It took him longer than he wanted to stagger with his weight braced on the wall towards Gabriel, but he managed not to fall as he reached up to unchain him with fumbling fingers. The splints on his hands didn’t cover his fingers, but that didn’t make them easier to move. He undid the latch at the back of the bridle and pulled it off. Sam tossed it into the corner where it clanked and rolled into the shadows, out of sight and out of mind.
Dean’s grip tightened on the handle, and he envisioned himself slamming it into Alastair’s face. That wouldn’t do much to a demon, since he didn’t have salt or holy water, so the fantasy remained a fantasy, and instead, Dean leveled the knife against Cas’s back, the edge hovering above black feathers.
Sam checked in on him, but gave him his distance to grieve. People came by, other family and hunters suddenly brought back to life by Jack, to offer their thanks, their congratulations, their support. Jody and Donna and their girls, Charlie, Garth, Bobby, even Rowena, taking a quick vacation from her duties as Queen of Hell. Dean only spoke to them if they came by his room, and even then, barely even a hello. He felt like a dick for not saying more, but what could he say? Sure, the world was safe, but what was the point of the world if Cas wasn’t in it?
He’d take all of the pain he could get as long as it meant he’d never use these hands for torture again.
Sam grinned at that, and he joined Dean in hugging Cas, nearly crushing him in his hold. But even though Sam was larger, Dean hugged with twice the strength, clinging to Cas like he had no intention to ever let go.
Dean moved his hand up to pet Cas’s black hair, shaggy and a little greasy. Cas needed to wash his hair, but Dean didn’t care at the moment. That could be dealt with later. Maybe Cas could even steal some of Sam’s fancy conditioner.
Sam took another sip of beer. Maybe he should set it aside and get water instead. That might help with the headache stabbing behind his eyes. He shrugged the pain aside, just something to deal with later. Right now, he had to listen to his brother. He could offer that much, at least.
It didn’t help. It would never help, not then and not now. He’d suffer if he struggled and he’d suffer if he didn’t, so why bother resisting? Why bother not resisting?
“Abaddon, Knight of Hell, has abducted Castiel and Dean. She knew we were coming and set a trap for the angel. Dean, of course, ran in to try and save him and ended up knocked unconscious. After the first betrayal, I don’t quite trust other demons, so I’ve had my hellhounds tracking them and trying to find them. When they get a scent, you’ll be the first to know.”
He resigned himself to his suffering, surrendered to it, accepted it, but that didn’t make it hurt any less. When he’d done the same thing with Asmodeus, given in and taken it with no more resistance, he told himself it got better when he didn’t fight back.
Good riddance to that bastard anyway. He couldn’t admit how he felt about his father to Dean, because Dean and John had always gotten along. They understood each other, bound by the shared horror of remembering Mary pinned to the ceiling and wreathed in fire. But Sam hadn’t known his own mother’s face until years later when she came back from the dead. No one ever stayed dead in Sam’s life it seemed.
Hot metal glowing orange, flesh charred red and black, the stench of burnt hair and skin, and a person huddled on the ground in front of him.
Sam stared at his reflection in the mirror. His hair had gotten greasy, and he needed a shave. If he weren’t so tired, he’d take a shower, but for the time being, he’d just have to wait till tomorrow, and hopefully his headache would let up by then.
Somehow, surrender felt less damning than admitting the truth. He’d become so starved for primal needs like comfort and affection that he’d sought it out anywhere he could find it, closing his eyes and pretending the hand on his throat wore the disguise of an embrace.
And speak of the devil-- er, angel, Sam turned at the sound of shifting on the bed to find Gabriel moving out of total stillness to tug on the blankets, repositioning himself. Sam stayed silent, waiting for him to wake up on his own time, only asking if Gabriel was awake when he thought he saw golden eyes flick open.
“Can’t exactly ‘rise,’ in case you’ve forgotten,” Sam grumbled. He shifted his limbs, all bound in leather straps pinning him to the cot. “What do you want this time?” Ruby had come in a few times in the past few days, once to drug him so someone (probably not her) could splint his hands and someone (probably her) could bind him immobile. She’d come in again to gloat.
Sam nodded. He’d been there before, and Gabriel really did look like he needed to sleep for about a month.
If Cas made a sound, he’d be electrocuted, so Dean stopped doing anything that might elicit a noise.
Castiel only got a second to cough out the blood before the crank made another rotation and he screamed, his bloody tongue flinging crimson droplets across the side of his face, and Dean’s name shot from his lips until his throat went hoarse and he couldn’t scream anymore.
“Keep telling yourself that. As I was saying, welcome to my own little paradise.” He extended his arms to gesture to the space. Much smaller than the Men of Letters bunker, but decently sized. “If you’ve gotten any last minute calls to make or messages to read, deal with them now before I seal the doors.”
Sam lurched on the cot. So the mind link had started again, then. She watched him writhe, sweat, gasp for breath as he struggled against the premonitions stuffed in his skull. Poor Sammy had himself a moral code, and thinking he’d hurt someone would shatter him more than any physical pain ever could. As far as she’d heard, he’d already broken for pain, so doing it again wouldn’t be easy. If they couldn’t destroy his body, they could destroy his mind… but Ruby still planned on deboning him like a trout.
For some reason, in the visions, Sam always wanted to do it. He could hear his own voice, echoing, saying things he didn’t remember saying, spewing bullshit about Gabriel deserving to be tortured like this.
It could’ve been days that passed, or maybe weeks, or maybe a decade. The passage of time became meaningless, a fleeting thing. Dean tried to mark the days at first, but he had no way to tell when days passed.
Pain in a vessel hurt quite a bit, of course, but now, with his true form exposed, he realized just how muffled his sense of pain had been before. He’d been sheltered, shielded by humanoid skin. Now, though, every burn felt excruciating, amplified far beyond anything he’d ever felt.
“Oh, so you recognized it?” Alastair gave him a smirk and a smug raise of his brow. “Thought you’d like to reacquaint yourself with your favorite old tool of the trade. She’s certainly missed you, that brute of a blade. What was it you liked to call her again, when you used her to carve people up? Oh, right, Baby.”
He mumbled his identity, his purpose, under his breath as he dragged himself through the sand, a prayer, or a mantra, to push himself forward.
Or maybe the heat came from the flame. Gabriel made the mistake of looking, turning his head and cracking his eyes open to see a blue light burn from the edge of the blowtorch, reeking of sulfur.
Sam shoved him hard enough to topple him. The chains wrenched at his wrists and cut his skin as he fell, digging out thin lines of blood. Gabriel’s back scraped against stone. He struggled to sit back up, no small task while he couldn’t move his arms and trembled like a leaf in a hurricane.
Dean stood up and glared. “Yes, on the condition that you stay the hell back. You don’t touch him, you don’t tell me how to do my damn work, you don’t get involved. I’d prefer if you stayed out of the cell too, but I doubt you’ll go that far. So stand on the other side of the room and don’t take a step closer. Don’t talk to me.”
With that, Sam twisted the screws the rest of the way. Bone caved beneath the spikes with a screech of metal and several wet cracks as the kneecap shattered into a dozen jagged shards, glistening with fresh blood. Gabriel’s head tilted back as he screamed, so raw and deep the lights flickered, a little of his true voice seeping through.
He didn’t figure it out till he got to the kitchen. A few wisps of white smoke hovered in the room, and it only took a few inhales for a headache to burn the back of Crowley’s eyes. He tugged his shirt up over his nose as he meandered around the kitchen, finding a folding knife and a now empty canister of knockout gas.
Sam rached across the table to take one of Gabriel’s shaking hands. “I know it’s scary. Believe me, I know.” Some of that dam crumbled, letting out a drizzle of vulnerability.
“Save it, Crowley,” Dean grumbled, “we all know you’d be doing the same thing if the roles were flipped.” He stood from the couch. “So, what are you waiting for? I’ve always wanted to do a case in Vegas.”
“Vessel, now what do you want?” Though he tried to sound angry and aggressive, his agitation came off as more frightened, though that was only to be expected if this was the same poor lad that had gotten stuck in the Cage.
He didn’t notice it till he stepped over it, toe catching on a transparent wire stretched from wall to wall, nearly level with the ground. Something metallic clinked. Heat flared up, shooting from nozzles concealed in the concrete.
Though Sam found himself remembering the time when Ketch had rescued Gabriel from Asmodeus. Gabrie hadn’t even taken in his grace until Sam managed to get through to him, and after that, Gabriel hadn’t actually used his powers until he had to, with no other way out.
Foggy smoke filled up the room, thick and heavy, blurring the edges of the space. Gabriel grilled his head and blinked as colors blurred around him. He groaned and shook his head to clear it, but Sam had no such luck. Even with his shirt and hand covering his face, Sam wheezed and staggered until he fell over. Gabriel dropped down beside him.
Dean leaned in to whisper in Cas’s ear just as he began sipping the drink, “And another little bonus, your lips will taste especially good now.” He waggled his eyebrows and smirked to get the message across.
“Are you kidding?” Dean cried out between gunshots. “I only just got you back. I’ve lost you enough times, I’m not abandoning you ever again.” He shoved a demon aside and tried to run for the fire, spitting out enough curses to make a sailor sweat. “Just hold on, Cas, I’m gonna get you out--”
“This is worth involvement, isn’t it? I’ll take anything at this point, any help you’d be willing to give. You don’t even have to help me; I have a plan to escape. But Dean and Cas… I keep seeing them in visions. Cas is hurt badly, and I’m sure Dean isn’t much better.”
Some beings, however, didn’t deserve sympathy. Looking over the souls in Heaven, they noticed that some didn’t truly earn a place here.
With Gabriel unconscious, Sam had nothing more to do than text Cas and Dean to update them, hope they’d get his messages eventually, and wait.
As Sam threw himself over Gabriel, pain flared across his back. Thick leather cords split his skin and carved gouges into him, hot and leaking red.
“I wish Jack had stayed a little longer,” Dean sighed. “Then we could’ve asked him to bring Cas back. But now he’s off doing his own thing, remaking Heaven and all that, and I dunno, I just feel like I wasted my chance.” He finished his beer, tossed it in the trash, and got up to get another one. “I wasted so many damn chances with him.”
He woke up in what he assumed was morning, but he couldn’t see the sun. Every ‘morning,’ he had a fresh, sore to the touch needle mark in his arm.
“He’s right, Dean,” said Crowley. “There’s no chance we live if we stay a minute longer, we need to go!”
He went silent for a bit, and Cas said nothing. He’d let Dean take his time working through it all in his head. Castiel’s own mind wandered, and he found himself wondering if Dean had resisted Michael for so long because he had given in to Alastair’s offer in Hell. How much of his drive for free will had come from the decades where he had no will or agency, where the only choice he could make was to suffer or suffer in another way?
“Okay,” Dean sighed, “so that’s a no on punching the wall. We’ll think of something else.” He had to think of something else. He had to. “Maybe we could, I dunno, get ahold of a weapon.” Not his most solid plan, but Dean would think of something. Anything. He had to.
But now, Sam got it. Hurting other people and having to live with that, especially when he didn’t have any control over it or a way to stop himself, that hurt worse.
The drowned body fell through the endless, weightless waters, farther than where light can reach. Gravity took a hold on the body and pulled it down, deeper and deeper, fathom by fathom, into the darkness, into the silence, into the emptiness, and there was no solid ground, nothing to land on, just infinitely stretching trenches with no seabed in sight, and nothing else in sight either. No sight, no sound, no smell, no taste.
Trying to stand again failed him, and this time Sam realized that he had manacled locked around his ankles, chaining him to the floor.
“Oh, Samuel…” Asmodeus snapped the whip against the grimy floor, sending white sparks into the cold, putrid air. “Resist my will all you want, but there’s not a damn thing you can do to stop me.”
How the hell could Crowley be alive? Sam had assumed Jack brought Cas back, but why would Jack ever resurrect Crowley?
And then one of Jack’s angels came back with news. Rowena wanted to speak to him personally about an important matter.
At least they were both in pain, Sam could share in that at least. He could barely move without feeling like a spike had rammed through his abdomen, and his head pounded from yet another premonition where he’d seen Cas and Dean together, suffering, covered in blood, and completely out of Sam’s reach. The intensity of the vision had been enough to make Sam’s nose bleed, and it had only just stopped, leaving a drying crust under his nostrils.
“Because you and Feathers are going to meet me here. I’ll text you the address, and you’ll come by to help me out. We’ll find a way to stop Abaddon, meanwhile Moose uses his connections and research skills to keep tabs on any other known threats who might be back.”
Desperate to elicit even a shred of mercy, Gabriel backed away, whole body clenched with pain. Every miniscule, wrenching motion forced him to stop and gasp for breath as he inched away, nearly slipping far too many times on his own sweaty palms until he managed to stumble off Sam and push towards the wall, where he could squash himself back into the corner for the illusion of safety.
As flawed as Chuck had been, in the end, Jack had to appreciate his craftsmanship and eye for detail, compacting so much into bodies so tiny, lifespans so small. He watched them roam his new Heaven like a wonder-eyed child staring into an aquarium fish tank.
But now, no more distractions. He couldn’t put it off any longer. Sam swallowed a gulp of air. “Um, Gabriel, there’s something else you should know. And I don’t know if I’m right, I could easily be wrong.” Please let him be wrong. “But back when Azazel was alive, since I had his blood in me, I had psychic powers that faded when he died. Premonitions, and…” And one freak case of telekinesis. “And I think I saw the future earlier.”
“Shut the hell up,” Asmodeus huffed. He reached for a chain dangling from the ceiling and bound Gabriel’s wrists above his head with it in serpentine coils. “I like you better when you’re silent. I could sew your mouth shut again, but I actually had another idea.”
Ruby got up to snatch Azazel’s bottle of booze and pour herself a glass. “Any way to track the rip’s movements?”
“What, not a fan of Vegas?” Crowley asked Cas with a smirk. “Casinos, strippers, fancy bars?” he teased, raising a brow.
Ignoring Alastair, Dean pulled Cas into his arms. Castiel sank into the embrace as he struggled to hold in groans and whimpers that would set the collar off again. Dean’s warmth closed in around him, allowing a little of the tension in his body to melt.
Tears burned Gabriel’s eyes. He couldn’t move his hands to wipe them away, so they free-fell down his face, searing his skin.
Azazel snorted. “Are you kidding, Ru? Did you see the way he lost his lunch? And all the crying and whining, he definitely fell for it.”
The chair screeched against the floor as Gabriel nudged it back to stand. He followed behind Sam, joining him in the corner of the room, where something sounded like it had fallen, but Gabriel couldn’t see anything.
Sam sighed. “You’re not the only one who’s come back from the dead. There’s something going on, Gabriel. And I’m afraid it’s only getting started.”
He couldn’t do anything to help, trapped as he was. He could only watch, helpless, as Dean fired off round after round, gunshots echoing, but new foes replaced every demon dropping dead. Crowley pulled out an angel blade, slashing at any demon that so much as glanced in his direction, and for once Cas didn’t mind that Crowley had gotten his hands on an angel’s weapon.
Cas talked with him, sometimes, but more often, he mumbled or made other non-speech noises to indicate reaction. Dean even got a laugh out of him, a few times.
“You have wings,” Dean echoed, not bothering to mask the awe in his voice. “Damn, that’s badass.” He corrected to, “Bad, I mean, that’s bad, that they did that to you. Because even though having wings would normally be very cool and you probably look really hot with them, it’s bad in the current situation.”
Gabriel had had better days. He’d also had worse days, but whatever. That was besides the point. After having the amount of “worse days” that Gabriel had gone through, didn’t he deserve a good day at some point? Just one good day? Apparently not.
“So this’ll be a slow process?” Sam said in a voice that sounded like him but didn’t feel like his own.
“Something rolled under there,” he warned Sam, voice rising, and Gabriel grabbed his arm to yank him back.
Gabriel, eyes wide and pulse flapping, pressed himself as far back into the corner as he could get. Sam didn’t look angry or aggressive, but that could change any moment. He couldn’t let his guard down, even if Sam did look like hell.
Times like these Cas wished he had a way to make his wings corporeal without burning anyone’s eyes out so he could use them to smack Dean in the face, but alas he couldn’t use his wings, so he settled for an elbow to the ribs.
Sam gasped and his eyes snapped open. He struggled against his blankets, kicking to fling them off, to toss away the suffocating weight. His room felt too hot and too cold at the same time, and sweat trickled down from his hairline, and Sam noticed the chilly dampness of more sweat soaking his back and underarms.
Hoping that said power belonged to an archangel, Rowena zoomed in on it, her irises flashing violet and the ring of candles surrounding her leaping bright with blue flames. She recognized the presence as angelic, far too strong to be a normal angel, even if depowered. An archangel.
“Dean,” Cas wheezed, flinching as the shock collar buzzed. “Get this over with. I can take it, okay?”
Before he could survey his surroundings, Dean heard another shout, followed by a thump from something heavy falling to the floor.
What the hell was he thinking? He’d just tortured Gabriel, and even though he didn’t want to or have a say in it, Gabriel didn’t know that. Did he even believe that Sam was back in control now?
“Go on, Sam, tell this little bastard exactly what you think of him. Remember what he did to you and your brother? He needs to pay for it.”
The spotty light from the moon and the city skated over the cracked edges, streaking in thin lines, and reflecting his face back at him. He stared into his own eyes, vivid blue, and his hair, black and damp, his clothes, ragged and sand-stained. He’d paled, waxy skin contrasted by half-moon circles under his eyes darker than bruises and the shadow of stubble ghosting his jawline. He’d looked better, but he still looked recognizable, just enough that he could remember his name. He could remember who he was, what he was, what he’d done, and why he had to keep moving, crawling up the beach, even though his legs were too weak to carry his weight.
The heat from the burner seemed to magnify, swelling to a sweltering blaze. His brain boiled from the inside and Sam tangled his fingers in his hair with a groan. Images flashed behind his eyes:
Dean grabbed him by his coat and yanked him into an embrace. “I love you too, you assbutt.” He turned back to the doorway, voice shaking with unshed tears, and shouted, “Sam, get up here, it’s Cas, he’s alive. It’s Cas, Sam, get up here!”
The demon chuckled, breaking their self-imposed silence. “You look pissed. But that brings me to the reason I went out to find you in the first place. I woke up much the same way you did, but weeks ago. I’ve had time to catch up. And I have a proposition for you.”
The ticking of his clock, the electronic thrum of the AC unit working, the buzz from all the wires and mechanics running through the walls, the faint hum of the warding that no one would notice if they didn’t know it was there, and any sounds that might come from Dean’s room, including but not limited to whatever Dean and Cas would end up doing, Dean snacking, Dean drinking, Dean cleaning his guns, Dean binge watching Doctor Sexy, and the occasional moment where Miracle would have a dream and start sleep howling. The less he heard his surroundings, the less ammunition his imagination had to weaponize against him while he slept.
Sam almost choked on his drink. “No, you most certainly didn’t.” If Dean had ever told him that, he would have remembered, and maybe used it against Crowley, or against Dean, or both of them. “Did you two, ah, y’know…”
Sam broke away first. “Let's take this inside. There’s a bottle of champagne I bought to drink if we saved the world, but it just didn’t feel right to celebrate without you.” He descended the stairs, called, “C’mon, Miracle,” and left Cas alone with Dean as the dog padded back into the bunker.
And yet, he didn’t stop. He ran, stumbling, gasping for breath, still soaked to the bone from the ocean and the rain, without giving himself any time to dry off. Landscapes blurred around him: lit up cities, rolling fields of wheat, stereotypical American suburbia, thick woods, and one inconveniently-placed mud puddle that Gabriel slipped in, face-planting into the muck. He staggered to his feet and kept going, making a rush for Kansas. The only place he could go where he could trust the people around him. The Winchesters had sheltered him before, despite their past, so maybe they’d be willing to do it again.
Dean said nothing for a while, until he moved to press against the wall. He spoke with a strain, forcing something back. Rage? A scream? Tears?
With each inhale, a little more light came back to him. Pinpricks of white all above him, and the blurred colors in the distance. Hues faded into place, illuminated by the moon and stars and far-off city lights.
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose. He put his eggs on the table and returned to the fridge to dig around the beer bottles until he found a can of whipped cream, then a bottle of syrup, which looked to be the fancy organic kind. Sam handed it to Gabriel, who dumped half the bottle on his pancakes, then swirled a mountain of whipped cream on top. He took another bite. Perfect.
Sam forced himself to sit up, braced on his elbows as he struggled to drag his legs under his body. He managed to get himself upright, but that didn’t make him look any better. He kept shaking his head and cramming his eyes shut and opening them again. The simple act of sitting left Sam panting and sweating, glistening beads matting into his hair and stubble.
Cas’s feathers fluffed under Dean’s touch, lifting into his fingers. Dean swept over every feather, even the ones only a fiber away from falling off, and he straightened them out, scraped dried blood away with his nails, picked out flecks of ash and chunks of debris. Too late, Cas realized that Dean was grooming him, just like birds do for each other. Dean took his time, careful not to press too hard or damage any feathers more than they already were.
The last time he’d had to make his way across the country, alone, without a vehicle, without his wings, he’d been limited by human needs, but now he could keep up a steady pace of walking day and night, since he didn’t have to sleep, eat, drink, or relieve himself.
If only Dean had just listened to Cas. If only Dean had just believed in Jack. If only Dean had taken a chance instead of hiding who he was.
Alastair unlocked the cell door and shoved Dean out into the hall. He didn’t bother with restraints, which seemed a little out of place, but Dean wouldn’t complain about that. Maybe he could use it to his advantage.
Distant breathing (Cas’s?) grew steadily louder the more Alastair worked the crank, and Dean couldn’t help but picture the scene on the other side of the wall. His mind stitched together an image, Cas chained on his back, trying not to make a sound, but he still let out stiff, strained breaths and barely contained groans as his limbs pulled, stretched out and tense, bones creaking. Maybe Cas would be struggling, trying to move even as chains held him in place.
But Sam hadn’t woken up in his bed. He woke up on a hard stone floor, and the air reeked of coppery blood and sulfur, the all too familiar odors of Hell, but this room was empty, no shelves stocked with tools of torture, thank Jack, and he didn’t see Gabriel anywhere.
He tried to take a step forward, then his legs did give out, crumbling beneath him, and he pitched forward. As he fell, he noticed the glint of light reflecting off the barrel of a gun as it slipped through Sam’s fingers. Sam lurched forward and caught him before he hit the ground, strong arms wrapping around Gabriel’s waist. Gabriel looked up at Sam. His mouth opened, but no words came out, just a quiet exhale before his heavy eyelids pulled shut and he blacked out.
He grabbed a pistol, one of the many, many weapons left sitting around the bunker for easy access, just in case they were needed.
No one would suspect that she’d just crawled out of a river, dizzy and exhausted, with an ache stretched through her limbs, bones sore from her frantic swim as the rapid currents slammed her into every other rock she saw.
Heaven lacked the same diversity. Empty halls, nondescript white. No wonder Cas preferred to live on Earth; if Jack had to spend so much time in such a monotone place, they’d lose their mind.
“You don’t get to cry,” Sam roared and stomped a heel down on Gabriel’s stomach. “Not after everything you’ve done.” He brought his heel down again, a little higher, and a rib cracked beneath his boot. “You abandoned me to fling myself into the Cage.”
If only this had happened when he’d arrived at the Men of Letters Bunker, before he’d pissed off Sam by dragging him into yet another problem, he could’ve had help.
To Sam’s surprise, she then undid the straps holding him down. Not that he could get up though. If he even tried to sit right now, he’d definitely vomit. In fact, he might vomit now.
He still remembered every hall and pass as he walked down to the throne room. Good on his mother, she hadn’t changed too much. They always did have the same taste in decor after all. Even the throne looked the same, dark and bold and imposing, the only difference being that he wasn’t on it.
“Dean,” Cas sighed, tone softer, like consoling a child throwing a tantrum, “it’ll be okay. I trust you.”
“I’d love to, but you never know who’s listening.” The demon winked. “Make sure you save the water. I’m not sure when I’ll be able to replace it. And I’ll have to count the needles when you’re done, so don’t try stealing any of them. They’re too small to make good weapons anyway. Good luck, Dean. Clarence.”
Crowley took a closer look at the red marks. His brow furrowed. Counters to the Bunker’s warding, by the looks of them. Fading, mostly used up, but still flickering.
Meat suits would fool a human, but not Castiel. He could see their warped true faces beneath the skin, twisted beyond anything recognizable as human, bearing no remnants of their pasts. If Cas didn’t know for fact that demons had once been ordinary people, he’d never have believed it after looking into their soulless eyes.
Cold metal dug into his wings, biting under the feathers to snap around the skin. Gabriel forced himself not to move, but he couldn’t swallow his whimpering. Asmodeus tugged on the chains and dragged his wings open as far as they could go. He hooked the chains to the floor, pinning the wings in place. Pain spiked through Gabriel’s shoulders and back from the strain.
Dean closed his eyes when the bone splintered apart, cracking into white fragments strapped together by whatever ligaments Dean had yet to sever. He cut the meat and marrow apart, his grip on Cas tightening, and Cas’s screams shattered something deep inside him. Dean pressed the blade down in one last slice before it caved through, severing the wing.
If only he’d told Dean to piss off that day he’d shown up uninvited to tell Sam that dad went on a hunt and didn’t come back.
Asmodeus extended his hand for the booze. “Actually, you may both be wrong. See, according to some of the demons I’ve been in contact with, the weather changes in the place a resurrection is about to occur. The wind goes wild, storms start brewing, and it all comes out of nowhere. Heat has been most common in sites of demonic resurrection, and cold at sites of angelic resurrection.”
With his newfound funds, he took public transportation across state lines, and walked the distance he couldn’t pay his way through.
He reached out, and the figure flinched back, turning his head to stare at Sam with a heart-shattering expression of sorrow and terror. Gabriel?
Gabriel drifted in and out of consciousness. When he finally woke long enough to take in some of his surroundings, he cracked open an eye, then squeezed it shut again against the light. He turned his head, fully covering his face with the blanket draped over him. But no matter how hard he tried to go back to sleep, it evaded him.
Sam looked up from his plate, locking eyes with Gabriel. He spoke with a calm, measured voice, slow enough to pick his words with care, his mouth a dam for all the things he really wanted to say, all the emotions carefully sheltered behind his eyes, so well hidden that Gabriel would have missed them entirely if he didn’t have millennia of experience reading people. Rage, sorrow, fear, hopelessness, all smothered and buried, trying to crawl from the grave, but Sam wouldn’t let them. He kept his face and his tone as neutral as he could.
Gabriel dug his forehead into the floor. “Please,” he sobbed. “It hurts. Please stop, I beg you, please.”
If Cas hadn’t been chained up, he might’ve had the strength to break through the wall dividing them.
“Oh, so you’re talking now? Finally got yourself a bit of courage? Where was this when I needed you to help stop Michael in the other world and you fled instead? I saved you, I pieced your broken ass back together, and I almost died trying to protect you, but you repay me by running off and only coming back when you needed help. You only ever show up when you need something.”
Jolting awake, Sam gripped his head where his headache had swelled up, screaming inside his head, high pitched and shattering, and he couldn’t help but think it sounded like a person’s scream.
She should really get into contact with some demons so she didn’t have to constantly rely on these buffoons for information, but most demons didn’t like her too much. They hadn’t known her true role in the apocalypse.
Crowley gulped down his drink, downing half of it in seconds. “Oh, it appears I’ve been a bad host. Care for a drink, boys?”
“Oh hello,” Rowena greeted, hopping off her throne. Her glittering red evening gown swished as she walked and her stilettos clicked on the floor. “It’s so good to see your lovely face in a dreary place such as this.”
Miracle perked up and barked his affirmation. His tail wagged fast enough to blur in the air. Rowena couldn’t resist giving him a few pats before clipping the leash on.
“Had,” he corrected. “I’m no longer in charge of Hell, which severely limits my available resources. And you lot are quite good at dealing with impossible odds, so you’re my go-to.”
“As do I.” His eyes flicked yellow. “Come on, then, let’s blow this joint.” Azazel stood up. “Can’t have any witnesses though, never know who’s listening.”
“Hell,” he said. Dean cleared his throat and exhaled. “He talked to me about Hell. But not what he did, what I did. You were there, you saw me. You watched me flay all the skin off a soul. Dammit, I still remember his face. The way he screamed. I remember all of them.”
Alastair turned the crank again and he definitely heard flesh tearing this time but all Dean could focus on was the sound of Cas screaming “Dean,” so hard that his voice gave out with a hacking wet cough.
The wings started rotting in that time. The sour odor of decay choked the air, and Dean had to get up, peel himself off of Cas, and shove the severed limbs to the opposite corner of the cell. Cas scooted against the near wall, and Dean sat down next to him. The distance didn’t help the stench much, if at all, but at least Cas didn’t have to look at the wings. He could bury his face in Dean’s shoulder and breathe through the pain in a desperate attempt to stay silent.
“You let me know the second you find anything. Anything at all, even if it’s just a hair or a scuff in the dirt, hear me? I can’t stand the idea of Sam being alone in Hell after all he’s gone through.”
Sam found himself remembering some of his moments in Hell where he’d lost body parts, especially organs. Temporarily, of course, since they’d always grow back after. He felt like Prometheus on some days, chained up and tortured as a reward for helping humanity. He didn’t have an eagle pecking out his liver, though. No, he’d have preferred an eagle, because a bird couldn’t taunt him, insult him, degrade him, take him apart with words alone.
After about ten minutes straight of humiliating pleading, Alistair said “maybe” to Dean’s request for medical supplies so he could piece together what remained of Cas and stop him from losing any more blood and grace.
He’d cracked a smile and said, “Took you bloody idiots long enough to tie the knot. Damn, first night must’ve been real fun. I’d love to have been in between you two.”
The only color in the room came from a smeared maroon stain where Dean’s blood had leaked out of his nose and dried on the floor while he’d been unconscious.
Cas wiped the tears from Dean’s eyes. But that wasn’t right. Dean didn’t deserve the comfort here. He hadn’t suffered enough to earn it.
Asmodeus waved his hand and Sam gasped as a wave of demonic power rammed into him like hurricane-force wind and slammed him against the wall. He cried out, his insides twisted, and he could almost swear something cracked when his wrists slammed into the wall, pinned in place by the power of Asmodeus’s will. No matter how hard he tried to move, his limbs felt like lead, and it seemed the more he struggled, the tighter the demon’s hold on him grew. Sam finally stopped thrashing when his lungs squeezed and he could barely breathe.
Gabriel squeezed his eyes shut. Tears trickled from the corners of his eyes and rolled down his face, running bright tracks through his grimy skin. As much as he told himself that he’d accepted it, fear overruled his resolve,  leaving him trembling hard enough to rattle the chains crushing his wings.
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as he turned back to face Gabriel. “No, they're the most small. What the hell were you expecting, a silk bathrobe?”
He hesitated, heart pounding, then lifted his hand to knock, but before his knuckles could touch the door, it swung open.
He set the class down on the table, most of it undrank, and wiped a few droplets off his face from where he’d snorted the champagne through his nose. Cas huffed and sneezed, covering his face with his hand, but Dean caught the blush behind Cas’s fingers, which Cas tried to hide by pretending to wipe his mouth.
“Yeah,” Gabriel said, “I figured this wasn’t normal. I mean, before I died I had some of my grace restored, but now I can barely feel any of it. My wings aren’t working too well either. It took me hours to get here after I woke up. And, uh, there’s another thing.” Gabriel turned his head to stare at the ground. He took a breath, and let all his words out in a rapid whoosh. “I’m feeling a piece of my grace somewhere outside of my body but I don’t know where it is and I’m afraid Asmodeus is back too and that he has some of my grace because there was still some left in him when I killed him and if he is alive I’d like to not leave here at all ever so yeah can I bunk with you?”
She groaned and hunched down in the chair, gasping for breath and trying to spit out the salt burning the inside of her mouth. Salted blood leaked down her chin in vivid rivers, filling the air with the coppery stench of bloody sulfur, the same inescapable odor ever present in Hell, thick enough to gag on.
Gabriel scrunched himself into a tiny ball, and with his wings wrapped around himself, he looked like little more than a pile of bloody feathers. But hiding under his wings did nothing to stop Asmodeus, who simply shoved them aside. He grabbed Gabriel by the shoulder and pulled up so hard something popped in the socket. Sam winced at the sound of dislocation, and Gabriel yelped.
Hadn’t they already established that Castiel preferred Dean be the one holding the knife? Whatever torture Alastair had in mind would be more bearable if Dean were the one performing it. Just his presence alone made this situation a little less horrible.
Not that it would matter anyway. Crowley was dead, had been for a long time, and he couldn’t just come back. Crowley resisted death with the scrappiness of a cockroach, but not even he could come back. If Jack hadn’t left, maybe, but without him, no one would be returning from the Empty, and that meant Cas was dead, really dead this time.
Cas, always willing to bleed for the Winchesters, complied without any hesitation. He shifted on the floor so he was sitting with his back to Dean and his wings spread out as far as they could go, long feathers sweeping the floor. They looked a little better groomed, but Cas would never get to enjoy the feeling of clean wings again.
“Burning that image out of my brain,” Crowley huffed. “Now, as I was saying, normally this wouldn’t be cause for concern, but the door was open, and I saw counters to the warding left behind. Not to mention I found a gas grenade when I looked around. I believe they may have been abducted, or otherwise harmed, which is a problem because I went to get Sam so he could go save Dean and Castiel--they’re together now by the way, finally--who have been abducted by Abaddon’s forces, who had a holy fire trap waiting, so they knew we were coming.”
“You didn’t have to torture her,” Cas said as he shoved Dean to sit down on one of Crowley’s sleek, fancy emerald couches, probably stuffed with peacock feathers or something. “Crowley can deal with it. Hell, you didn’t have to be in the same room. We could’ve waited out here from the start.”
While Dean and Crowley indulged themselves in their happy juice, Cas stood beside the bar, envying, not for the first time, the ability of demons and humans to get drunk, and to enjoy the taste of what they drank.
Dean folded his arms. “Yeah, that’s what they all say before I start pulling their intestines out of their asses.”
Only then did he look, and cold crawled through him. He couldn’t see any skin left on Gabriel’s back, just bloody meat and the white outline of his spine and ribs poking out. His wings looked a bit less damaged, but not much, and had lost quite a few feathers to the whip snapping into him.
Dean glanced at the floor. “Yeah. Um, what you said to me, when you confessed. You kept saying how much good there was in me, but Chuck called me a killer, and I guess I trusted your word over his, so I thought maybe we could prove him wrong about us. That we don’t have to be killers.”
“You’ve been in here for two days straight and you go for the food before the water? I thought hunters had survival skills.”
“Meg?” He eyes her current vessel, a bearded man in his fifties. “I thought you preferred women for meat suits.”
A gold bell above her jangled as she tugged the door open. One step inside and she already drew attention from various farmers in flannel, truckers in baseball caps, and a middle aged waitress with enormous black hair piled on top of her head.
“Cas, are you okay?” Dean pulled out his gun with one hand and struggled out of his jacket with the other, but he never got a chance to lay it over the flames and give Cas an escape.
The force of Cas’s push knocked him sprawling, scraping his hands on the ground and leaving red smears behind. He jumped back up, oblivious to the blood, and spun to face Cas, his stunned and worried face veiled by wavering tongues of holy fire lashing in a circle around Cas, penning him inside.
Alastair must’ve grabbed the crank, because Dean heard clanking and the sound of chains clinking. Dean curled his fists tight enough to leave indents in his palms.
“NO,” Dean snarled. “That’s going way too far.” The comment had Cas flinching in fear, but at least the collar didn’t respond to motion, only noises he made. It didn’t respond to any of Dean’s shouting either. “I’m not doing it. Threaten me all you like but there’s no way in hell I’m doing that to Cas.”
“Don’t you get it?” Sam grabbed his burnt wing and yanked so hard Gabriel screeched. “I’m not going to stop. I’m never going to stop.”
Crowley rolled his eyes. “Oh don’t pretend you aren’t interested in me, and don’t pretend you don’t swing that way either. I have a photo that says otherwise.”
He swiveled his head to look over his wings, but didn’t see anything. Then he realized, it wasn’t his cell opening, it was Dean’s. He took a step closer to the wall, wincing at the pain ripping his wrists, and strained to listen.
They could hear Crowley’s smile as he spoke even though they couldn’t see it. “Oh, that’s wonderful, great for her! Is it odd for a son to be proud of his mother instead of the other way around? Oh, who gives a damn, I’m so proud of my dear old mum, I always knew she had it in her. Well, I’ll see you boys soon. Farewell.” Crowley hung up.
“Normally, yes. That’s why this should not be possible. My wings are… smaller, tamer than they should be. I don’t know how he did it, but I have my wings out in the open now.”
No, not that he cared about Sam, he told himself. He had his own personal, selfish, self-centered reasons for walking into the Bunker. He’d need help fighting Abaddon, of course, and then there was the fact that when something bad happened to a Winchester, he got dragged into it. That’s it, plenty of perfectly selfish reasons for checking on Sam. He didn’t care about the man, and he certainly had not gone soft, thank you very much.
Sam ran up the stairs. He took one look at Cas, then dropped the angel blade he was holding. Cas raised a brow.
Dean sighed and sank into his chair. He cracked open his beer bottle with the edge of a knife. “Romantically?”
Crowley grinned with all his teeth and pulled out his phone. “I knew I’ve been saving this picture for a good reason,” he said before presenting his screen, showing an image of a younger Bobby kissing Crowley. “You used tongue, by the way.”
So when Dean walked up the stairs to the bunker door, Miracle trotting beside him, he never could’ve expected to pull open the door, receiving a facefull of chilly night air spelling of grasses and farmland, and hear the very voice he’d been hoping for, wishing for, dreaming for, praying for.
Castiel flicked his eyes open and stared up at Dean. He didn’t speak, but he tried to convey all of his needs and desires into one piercing stare; the eyes that had watched nebulae bloom and mountains rise and fall saw even greater beauty and wonder in Dean Winchester.
Gabriel kept falling each time he tried to fly. He knew he needed to rest, replenish. Hell, maybe he should even sleep. Archangels didn’t have to sleep, but he’d indulged in the sweet release of unconsciousness plenty of times.
Gabriel clenched his jaw and braced himself against the wall with splayed fingers cutting into the stone. He couldn’t swallow the low whine building in his throat as the paint built, digging deeper and deeper, past the confines of his body. Sigils, he realized. Spellwork marked into his skin, plunging through meat and bone to scratch the edges of his true form. A wave of agony rolled under his shoulders, squirming like a living thing.
Sam would have to warn him, and explain what little they knew so far. “You’re not the only one who’s come back from the dead,” he exhaled. “ There’s something going on, Gabriel. And I’m afraid it’s only getting started.”
He clenched a fork in his hand, as if that would be a decent weapon. Didn’t angels have fancy knives they were supposed to use?
‘Out, Squirrel,” Crowley ordered. “Swallow your pride already and let me have a chat with my guest like a good and proper host.”
“Of course you can stay,” he replied without stopping to think about it. Back when they had to deal with Michael in the Apocalypse World, that’s all he’d wanted, for Gabriel to stay. “I’m not gonna kick you out or anything, and besides, you look like you could use the rest. What exactly happened when you woke up?”
“Dean.” Cas took his hand and tugged him back, out of the devil’s trap. He spoke in a low, hushed voice so Trepsichore couldn’t hear. “You don’t have to do this. Just let Crowley handle the interrogation.”
And worse still, he saw Sam after one Tuesday too many, full of rage rather than despair, and he leaned in too close and whispered, ‘for my brother,’ before ramming a hand into Gabriel’s gut and pulling out his snaking intestines.
Cas nodded and followed behind, letting Crowley lead the way around the back of the building. The demons would recognize them on sight, and even then there were too many to fight. For now, Crowley had decided to set up microphoned cameras looking into the windows. They could spy on Abaddon and her forces, get an idea of numbers, and overhear plans, all while figuring out a way to kill her.
While most angels didn’t really have a concept of nudity, he’d come to understand it after so many years alongside (and as a part of) humanity, and that same vulnerable feeling came the closest to how Castiel felt having his wings exposed for all to see.
“See, Squirrel, I and your boyfriend aren’t the only ones who’ve come back. Several demons that I thought long dead have been springing up in lakes and rivers all over the world. I myself popped from one of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie to be exact, which is quite fitting. Now, I’ve got a bit of a theory about all this, but it’ll take some effort to confirm. First off, Feathers, where did you wake up?”
Cas hung from the ceiling, facing away from Dean, feet barely grazing the floor, and a dark red puddle sat static under him, only rippling when Cas’s toes brushed over the surface. Blood slithered, sluggish, from too many wounds for Dean to count. His torn-up wrists, gashes on his bare back, punctures and lacerations covering him all over, leaking burns. But the most blood came from the base of his wings, waterfalling down his back from gaping rips where his wings were broken and the bones drove like white knives through feathered skin.
