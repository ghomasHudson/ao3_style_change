Peter scoffed “No they won't.” he tells her going right for her pride like the little snake that he was “You’re too tough to be killed!” he proclaimed the sugar already reaching his brain making him be a little louder than was strictly necessary.
“Pleeeease Tony?!” Peter whined looking out the window with longing eyes.
“Tw..twenty dollars… please.” He managed to squeak out in spite of his chattering teeth.
“No-”
“Hmm?” Tony asked distantly
They looked between each other and the box. Nodding a truce Bucky grabbed the box from Clint. Natasha finished off her tea in one gulp getting up from her seat to come help with breakfast.
Buck nodded, accepting the apology. “Thank you, Peter. Now you can look.” he held out the bag.
Natasha took over her normal job of organizing the arduous task of unloading and settling the pack into their temporary home. Nobody argued with the red-haired omega as she assigned them each their usual tasks. Bucky and Steve were on unloading duty. Peter was in charge of making sure everyone’s things were beside their individual beds and their toiletries were in the bathroom. Sam was sent out to gather firewood for the night. Tony was working on setting up an internet connection while Clint was to scout out the area for possible dangers as well as place cameras on the trees so that Jarvis could monitor the area around the cabin. All of it a part of the familiar, comforting, routine they had to make sure that they were as safe and as comfortable as they could be.
"There's a weekend in two days," Sam commented off-handedly.
Peter pouted “but-”
“That's right. And why pray tell, do we have our rules ?”
Peter squealed happily, bouncing up and down on his toes. He turned his puppy-dog eyes on Steve. “Can I feed them?”
Sam chuckled watching the pup look out the window as if he didn't see snow on a yearly basis and didn't arrive an hour ago from New York where it had been actively snowing when they boarded the jet to fly to the Grand Canyon.
"What am I chopped liver?”Steve asked
Peter lit up snatching the bag from the alpha. Turning it around he saw on the black plastic inscribed in gold lettering were the words ‘elk food’ with a simple drawing of an elk’s face above it.
Bucky silenced him with a look. “Eat.”
Peter sat up some more when a tiny bit of movement caught his eye. A fox. A grey one to be exact crept out of the forest on silent paws, its ears pinned forward to listen for any prey which might be hiding beneath the snow and ice. Peter watched in fascination as the small predator zeroed in on a mouse who was nibbling away at some of the food it had stored in its burrow beneath the snow.
Peter pulled out his boots and looked them over. They were also a light grey that matched with his bag. They were made of waterproof material so he wouldn’t have to worry about his feet getting wet and they would be easy to clean should they get dirty. Having tried them on Peter found them to be his exact size as well as very comfortable. It felt as though he were walking on clouds.
Steve set Tony down on his feet pressing a mug of coffee into his hands. Tony purred, raising himself onto his tiptoes he kissed Steve's cheek in thanks before he went to sit down at his seat. Steve smiles so stupidly happy at the obvious show of affection that it filled the room with his scent of peanut butter and apples.
Buck took his time with his shower simply enjoying the hot water which sprayed endlessly down on him. Reminiscing about how before he would've been lucky to get enough water for one five-minute shower. Rinsing his head off he turned the water off and grabbed his towel. Drying off and slipping on his usual pajamas of a loose t-shirt and sweats. Careful not to make too much noise he snuck out of the bathroom and into his bed murmuring goodnight to Tony as he slips into bed and falls asleep.
Bucky rolled his eyes, “They’re a lot like big goats.”
By now the snow was beginning to form a pristine white blanket over the cabin and surrounding woods. Tony groaned, stretching his arms above his head dramatically as he got out of the car. The rest of the pack clambered out after him, stretching their muscles out as they set about unpacking the car.
Natasha flicked on the lights of the kitchen blinking at the sudden brightness but otherwise unreactive. Clint on the other hand hissed like a pissed-off alley cat and tried to block the light with an arm. Natasha rolled her eyes at the dramatic beta.
They moved on heading down in the canyon. The trail was wide enough for two to walk side by side at first but it progressively got narrower as they continued down till they reached a point where they had to go single file. The ground was slightly dampened from the now melted snow but the air was still crisp and a slight breeze blew down the canyon cooling the sweat on their necks as it formed.
Clint grumbled about the randomizer being rigged as he climbed up into the jet with the help of Bucky. Soon the whole pack sat tiredly in the jet munching on their specially made boost bars. Some cringing at the greasy, unpleasant texture more than others.
Instead of climbing into their own beds like they normally would, somehow they all just seemed to gravitate towards Steve’s and Tony’s. It was a bit of a tight squeeze to fit all of them on and they did have to push over Natasha's bed but eventually, everyone curled up together and fell asleep.
Tony huffed fondly, waving off the over-excited pup "Oh hush. You'll have plenty of time to do everything you want to." He assured Peter, helping him up into the jet.
“To keep us safe….” he mumbled his reply kicking at a snowbank with his boots
He growled playfully “Is that so...?”
Steve chuckled ruffling Peter's hair. “How could we have not?”
The pack took a 3-hour nap before Peter began to stir. He rarely managed to get more than 3 hours before his body was raring to go again. It was cozy inside the cabin, despite the freezing temperatures outside, thanks to the two human furnaces which were snoring peacefully just a few feet away from where Peter shifted sleepily. He was not quite awake yet, his mind still foggy and unfocused, but not entirely asleep either as he instinctively took in the different scents around him. ‘Tony’s warm bread...Clint’s fresh cut grass...Bucky’s coffee grounds with a mental tinge….Sam’s lemon zest….Natasha’s pierogi filled with sweet raspberry jam… and Steve’s peanut butter and apples. He listed off each scent blearily in his head, slowly becoming more and more awake.
“Fuck, do that again,” Tony tells him, ignoring the slightly desperate edge to his voice. Steve’s teeth catch the skin of his neck again bit this time he bites, lightly, as he moves the dildo. “Fuck
Steve shifts his hips into Tony’s and they both moan, “
this. “Well, Howard ditched me in Italy, something about teaching me a lesson, fucking prick. I was fully prepared to badger my senile grandfather for money to get home because he loves me more than Howard but then I happened to stop Steve in a car and thought ‘huh, he’s hot.’ Anyway, figured I’d take him home to his place, which turned out to be a hotel and honestly I was fully prepared to just stay the night and leave the homeless problem to tomorrow’s Tony but he kept me around for the week so I didn’t actually have to solve that problem. Then I convinced him to bring me home, easy peasy.”
fuckin good.” Tony moans into Steve’s neck, marking him again and Steve changes their position, falling forward so Tony’s back on the mattress with his legs spread wide. “Always so fucking eager to take me,” Steve tells him as he leans over him. Steve kisses him roughly, nipping at his bottom lip before nosing his way down Tony’s jaw and kissing down his neck. “God, you smell even more turned on than you feel,” he says, letting out a small moan.
Tony you’re gunna die there,” Rhodey tells him and that’s rude!”
“Seriously?” Tony asks and Steve doesn’t know if he should be offended by the disbelief in Tony’s voice or not.
Steve nods, half coherent. “Can feel that, baby. Your slick’s making a mess,” he tells him. “
? Don’t listen to him,” Steve tells Tony.
Tony gives him a
“Please don’t ask some dumb shit,” he says.

but he allows it, watching Steve shimmy down the bed a little until he’s somewhat distantly between Tony’s legs. He gives Tony an appreciative once over before he grins and trails his fingers down the inside of Tony’s thighs lightly. Tony shivers a little, biting his lip. “What is it with you and doing that?” Steve says. “Stop your damn lip biting and moan like you want to.”
but you hold a natural talent that’s rare. Trust me, I know talent when I see it,” Bucky says.
“Mhm, yeah,” Tony says, kissing Steve again. This time Steve doesn’t pull away, pulling Tony closer as he runs one hand up his thigh.
“Can I redefine it now?” he asks, looking way too hopeful.
, that’s it Tony,” Bucky murmurs. Steve is clearly pleased with his choice too because he moans into the space between Tony’s shoulder blades. Steve lets out another couple huffs of breath before he pulls Tony back some more, disrupting Tony’s rhythm to set his own, shifting into Tony as he moves his hips the way he wants. Bucky moans, breath hitching as Steve moves Tony’s hips just the right way. “Oh,
“Not stopping you,” Steve calls to him.
of surprises. Another of Bucky’s favorite traits.
more than suggest his relationship would extend to Bucky so its not like he’s stepping on any toes
When Tony picks up his pace in earnest Steve and Bucky’s grips on him get tighter. Steve guides his movements a little and Bucky drops his hands from his thighs in favor of running his hands up Tony’s arms, down his back, and over his thighs again like he’s trying to touch every inch of skin he can reach. “Like that, Tony,” Steve tells him as he guides his hips, “
“Guess I should maybe mention he’s kinda the leader so-to-speak,” he says.
, do that again- survived that long,” Steve tells him.
“Yeah?” Steve murmurs, smiling a little.
“You with me, Tony?” Steve asks, voice harsh if his ear and yeah he is.
Rhodey shoves him back out. “Oh my god. He’s not going to break sacred bro codes-”
“You okay?” he asks because Tony’s looking at him with a weirdly concentrated look on his face, like he’s trying to figure out some kind of philosophy question. He’d say a math problem except Tony is more than exceptional at math and he got bored and annoyed of Steve’s philosophy course text in like five minutes. Said philosophy was a useless discipline and he’s not entirely wrong there, in his defense.
“Yeah?” Steve murmurs, “why’s that, baby?”
“Come on then,” he says, holding his hand back for Steve to take. When he does Tony pulls him from the room, moving down the hall to the left. They get about half way there when Steve pulls him back and releases his hand in favor of grabbing his hips.
“I told my grandfather I was dying of dysentery for this.
“Yeah you do,” he murmurs. “Come here,” he tells Tony, beaconing him closer. He crawls up, sitting pretty in front of Steve. By now his shirt is a mess, half hanging off his shoulders, and his hair has to be a disaster but that doesn’t seem to matter to Steve. “Undo my jeans,” Steve tells him and yeah okay, this is something he can do.
“And how mad can he be if he was the one who suggested this?” Tony points out.
, Tony,” Steve says, pushing himself in as far as he can go. Tony moans too, legs curling tighter around Steve as his back arches and he cums. Steve lets out a string of swear words, panting into Tony’s neck and seemingly oblivious to Tony’s release. “Holy fuck,” he murmurs.
Bucky lets out a small laugh, “yeah I’d fucking say. You managed to make three different kinds of explosives out of
“Hope he does a lot more than that,” Bucky adds, grinning down at him.
“Oh, guess that makes sense. Any plans for the rest of the day?” he asks, slightly tongue tied as Tony reaches up to the shelf over his bed, exposing a small bit of his stomach and honestly he needs to get his shit together. That’s not even attractive.
Steve sputters, surprised. “What was that for?” he asks like Tony hasn’t made himself one hundred percent clear.
“Heart murmur.”
Steve grins, “a store,” he says because apparently he’s in the mood to be a dick.
Steve moans into Tony’s neck and he pulls his hand away from Tony’s ass. “You are so fucking hot,” Steve tells him. “
“No fuckin way, you’re always ready for me,” he says and Tony huffs out a laugh.
he misses this, its been too long and Steve’s so good,
“Believe it or not s’knida hard to get me this wet,” he tells Steve.
“Steve,” Tony whines into Bucky’s mouth, “please.” He’s not entirely sure what he’s asking for but something is better than the nothing he’s getting now.
Tony pants as Steve starts to move, desperately trying to urge him to move faster. “Baby I need you to hurry up,” Tony tells him. “Want you so bad,” he murmurs.
There’s a billion other variables of course, and Tony could be wrong on all accounts but that doesn’t really matter when he’s stored with a bunch of tech. All he needs to do is get access to it and he’s smart, way smarter than any of his captors, so he’ll be fine.
Tony nods, “love the feeling of a knot in my ass,” Tony says, “can’t wait to feel you fill me up.” His fingers tighten in Steve’s hair a little and he curls his legs around him, urging him on.
Sam considers it for a moment and nods, “makes sense.”
or at least it looked simple.
“Forty percent hearing loss in my left ear. Scarlet fever as a kid, I think. I honestly can’t remember.”
Tony shivers, “whatever you want,” he tells Bucky, mostly ready to make good on that too.
Steve laughs, sounding a little hysterical and nods. “Anything you want,” he murmurs.
“Faster,” Tony tells him as Bucky’s hand settles in its place on his back again.
goddamn good on you,” he says, eyes falling to the aforementioned garment. Okay, yeah, Tony’s got better self control than Steve at least in this department but even he’s got his limits so he props himself up and reaches for Steve. He carefully guides him in, taking his time to adjust to the stretch as he slowly sinks down. “Oh
“Am not, its true,” Steve murmurs, pulling Tony into his lap. Tony rearranges himself; shifting so one leg is on either side of Steve’s hips and curling his arms around his neck.
“Fuck no, that’s gross. This has nothing to do with you and everything to do with Tony- the point here is to rile him up a little for my own benefit. If that means kissing you, fine. I’ll make that sacrifice,” he says. A simple means to an end- that’s all this is.
Steve moves faster, placing a hand on Tony’s hip, grip tight. “You have no idea how hot that is, telling me to mark you like that,” Steve tells him.
If he’s going to be stuck like this for days, and there’s no
Bucky swears, letting out a low groan. “Fuck I can’t believe you got him to do that,” he murmurs and Steve laughs.
“Do you have something to add, sweetums?” Tony asks and Rhodey wrinkles his nose. Which, rude, Tony calls him all kinds of things that are worse than that. Steve and Bucky made him promise never to call them platypus but that wasn’t a hard sell considering only Rhodey gets to be his platypus.
people, Bucky namely, he knows to keep weird opinions to himself. Who the hell just
“Less teasing, more sex,” Tony tells him. Steve laughs a little, but obliges, taking Tony back into his mouth. Tony moans as Steve sets a pace, mercifully faster than his starting point. “Yeah, that’s it,” Tony tells him, “fuck that’s good.”
Steve swears in Gaelic again as he fucks into Tony harder. “Say your mine,” Steve all but growls at him.
“Great! I’m excited to see what Tony does.”
you are wet.” He knows that, has been trying to hold back since he stuck the damn stockings on but when Steve flipped them over yeah,
Tony does his best not to twist too much when the dildo hits just the right spot. “S’good,” Tony manages to murmur.
“You’ve had a good go at it so how about shut up,” Steve tells him.
to know that Tony wants him too given the sheer amount of time he spends trying to goad him into doing something. And at the moment Bucky looks damn tempted but he looks away for a moment, considering walking away Tony assumes.
Steve nodded “To keep us safe.” he repeated sternly “You have to have more self-control, Peter. If you were to dash out like that during a mission you could be seriously hurt.”
Peter was bouncing up and down in anticipation, his mouth practically a waterfall; eyes as big as saucers. Bucky grabbed Peter before he could jump the pancakes like a starving animal. Steering the hyperactive pup towards the bathroom “Go wash your hands first.'' He told Peter leaving no room for argument. Peter went with little complaint just wanting to get it over with so he could eat.
Natasha narrowed her eyes “Don’t you dare….” she threatened
As soon as the jet touched down Peter was flinging himself out of the jet and towards the door to the elevator much to the collective amusement of the pack who made their way out of the jet at a much more leisurely pace.
Clint looked over “Yeah?”
Peter grumbled twisting in Tony’s grip to look over his shoulder to look up at Steve pleadingly. Steve smiled fondly, deciding to help his pup. He put a hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony looked at him. “I’ll protect him, Tony,” he promised Tony sighed deliberating, eventually he let go of Peter.
"Why stay in the United States? I say we go to Rome or Italy." Natasha said as she smashed the final goop-filled creature.
Clint, who had been watching this whole exchange from his perch on top of the fridge, hopped down leaving his coffee up there for some poor unfortunate soul to find later.
Peter was practically bouncing off the walls of the elevator by the time they reached the common room floor. He dashed for his spare room as soon as the elevator doors opened.
He chuckled, looping an arm around the pup.“Aww c’mon Nat this isn't anywhere near wired for him. Remember when he tricked Thor into giving him coffee? Now that was wired. Kid didn't sit down for like 48 hours straight!” he laughed
Peter nodded so enthusiastically that he made himself dizzy. Steve huffed a laugh at the pup’s antics. Having handed Peter two pots, Steve tells him to turn on the stove and start on the pasta. Steve smiled, grabbing a pan and starting work on some homemade sauce. Over the next hour the two work on the meal. It took about 7 packets of pasta and 3 saucepans full to make enough for everyone to have seconds.
“We think we should do this trail,” Clint said, having given them a moment to skim through it.
“Peter, what is our rule for going outside?”
About two-thirds through breakfast Sam started passing brochures down the table. It was for a hiking trail called the South Kaibab Trail. The pictures showed steep trails with views that could take your breath away. Tony could only imagine what it would be like covered in a blanket of snow.
“Come here- I'll take you to go get some,'' Steve said, gathering up the omega into his arms, then princess carrying him into the kitchen.
Roughly an hour later they were all headed off to the trail. It was an easy walk of about half a mile as they chatted amongst themselves. Just before they got to the start of the trail a herd of elk came into view. Tony stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes wide with terror. He turned tail and hid behind his bemused mate. Bucky huffed a laugh. Watching the infallible tony stark shake at the sight of a few big deer. “Ya know they’re kinda cute,” he commented
Peter turned to look at Steve as he asked in a deadpan voice “Are you covered in warm melted butter, liquid sugar, or have delicious fillings?”
, Steve. Lets
Steve presses a kiss to the top of his head, “yeah you are,” he murmurs. “And you’re smart, and funny, and generous, and compassionate,” Steve tells him, kissing his way down Tony’s neck.
“Nope,” he says. Steve makes a displeased noise and Tony thinks its funny that he’s frustrated with his own fantasy. He presses a finger all the way in and moans a little. Behind him, Steve shifts listlessly as Tony starts to move his finger in and out of himself.
“Gunna fuck me or no?” Tony asks and Steve bites his lip and oh,
“Oh yea, but not until you
of that shit is easy and I watched the security tapes. You’re…
Steve nods, “mm, fuck okay,” he murmurs, “let me grab a condom.”
They’re curled up on the bed and Tony needs a shower before he feels too hot again but he also doesn’t want to move. Steve prods him gently and Tony swats him away. “You need to shower,” Steve murmurs. “Come on, I’ll wash you,” he adds.
Tony can deal with being the worst so long as he’s
Peter nodded enthusiastically, digging through his bags to find his suit. Bucky stretched his hands above his head smiling as he watched the pack pup slip on his suit. Almost immediately the suit began steaming as the heaters worked to bring Peter's body temperature up to his optimal range The pup grinned like a Cheshire cat enjoying the heat of his suit. Bucky knew the heater was undeniably Peter's favorite part of his suit. He had seen the teen wearing the suit around the tower when he didn’t have enough times to know that it was more than just a convenience or laziness thing. Not to mention the dead giveaway of the way he purred whenever the heater kicked on.
“Wouldn’t be impatient if you gave me what I wanted,” Tony tells him. Bucky shakes his head and shifts Tony’s head to the side, pressing his face into Tony’s neck and
. Total jackasses.
Bucky shifts to look up at him, offended. “I am not vanilla,” he says.
yes,” Steve tells him. “You’re always in skirts anyway, not that hard to imagine you in what I like.” Tony grins and shifts, rolling them both over- a bit difficult in the limited tent space but he manages just fine. He pins Steve’s hand over his head and settles in his lap, straddling him. Steve squirms a little; lips parted some as he looks Tony over. He leans in and kisses Steve, smiling as Steve leans into it enthusiastically, his free hand tangling in Tony’s hair to pull at it a little before it roams down his back and over his ass.
“It got infected,” Steve says through his wheezing and Tony nods.
“Yeah I wanna do it,” he tells Tony, grip on his hip tightening considerably.
“Yeah, and it was
that’s good- do that-” his words cut out as he moans, mouth falling open.
“S’not my fault Steve went on for hours over there,” Bucky murmurs, sliding a hand up Tony’s thigh.
“Am not! I have protection,” he says, nose in the air.
Yeah, Tony knows. “Didn’t take you for the territorial type.” Mostly because he seems to you know, have some common sense. But he can deal with a little territorial if Steve keeps the rest of his traits. Might even be a little flattering.
he’s got a thing for that. “You get more fun by the moment,” Bucky murmurs, leaning in and kissing him softly. Tony tries to press into the kiss more but Bucky pulls away, grinning down at him. He leans back in and kisses him briefly because apparently he’s intent on teasing. Payback, Tony is sure, for putting up with Tony tormenting him for so long. But when Bucky pulls away completely he lets out a disappointed noise that makes Bucky laugh. “Shush,” Bucky tells him, “and flip over.”
this god damnit and Steve needs to hurry the fuck up.
Steve moans loudly, “oh my god, I think I’m gunna,
as an adult and he will never,
Bucky considers it for a moment. “On a scale of one to ten how well do you think this will work?” he asks.
that is a lot hotter than Tony expected it to be. “Fuck Steve, keep doing that,” Tony tells him as Steve shifts his hips up to match the pace he’s set. Steve’s grip tightens as his breathing and thrusts become a little more erratic.
“Colorblind.”
torture and Tony’s got a plan. Kind of. HYDRA won’t be getting shit from him anyway, even if they think they’ve won just because they played and extended game of Dunk Tony. But they need him alive if they want anything out of him and he’d figured out fast that they weren’t willing to just kill him. Stupid of them to play their hand like that and he’d say it was stupid of them to hand him a pile of weapons but he’d honestly rather be waterboarded again than use what looks like fucking
Tony considers his options and decides to hell with it. “You gunna fuck me with it or no?” he asks.
Steve pants heavily into his neck, movements soft and jerky as he cums too and Tony sighs. “Think that vibrator is still on,” he murmurs after a moment. Steve lets out a soft laugh and shakes his head.
Tony throws back his head and laughs. “Okay, so I had no clue he did this, that’s important to the story. So he wakes me up at like just after four in the morning and he’s crying his eyes out and I just want to go the fuck back to sleep so I tell him to stop whining about his girlfriend dumping him, climb in bed, and go the hell to sleep but that solves nothing. Then he’s all ‘I need you to look at my dick’ and sleepy me is an asshole, but I’m curious at the best of times and that’s not a normal reaction so okay. I sit my ass up and nothing could prepare me for what was about to assault my eyes. I’d say it was to early to look at that shit, but there’s no good time of day for that.”
Leaving the conversation at that Bucky turned his attention to the toll booth they were pulling up to. He rolled down the window to be met with a very cold-looking beta teenager huddling in the booth. He couldn't have been more than 19 years old. His face was covered in acne and his teeth had braces on them. It was abundantly clear he had not been expecting it to drop below freezing today as he was wearing a light jacket and no under armor beneath his baggy jeans.
“Tony….” he called, gently shaking his mate. Tony let out a high-pitched whine of protest.
About an hour later Steve stirred a bit, groggily raising his head to look around the room. The corners of his lips twitched at the sight of his pup nodding his head along to the beat of whatever song was playing in his ears, lost in his own little world. Steve pushed himself up on his elbows looking around at his sleeping packmates he took a moment to simply enjoy it. Closing his eyes and listening to the steady breaths of those around him.
Rooms on the common floor were generally just for hosing off after a mission and grabbing some clean clothes, or in this case, their go bags, so it wasn't hard to meet back by the elevator in under 30 minutes. Peter, of course, was the first to show, followed closely by Natasha, Bucky, Steve, and Clint. Tony, in typical Stark fashion, was late. Fashionably late as he would say whenever anyone complained about his tardiness.
“Buck, we both know you’re more vanilla than the ice cream flavor, relax,” Tony tells him.
“I’ve
“Yeah,” Tony says, his voice nearing a whine and he sounds fucking ridiculous because nothing’s even happened yet aside from some minor petting but he’s still got that image of Steve and Bucky in his head and it seems to be doing a lot of the work for them. Not hard, Tony figures, when its something that’s been running around in his imagination since he met them.
“Rumlow’s pants,” Steve points out and yeah okay, he’s got a point there. Steve smiles, knowing he’s got Tony there. He leans in and kisses Tony softly, “want to make the playlist?” he asks and hell
Tony frowns, “didn’t seem to do much to you,” he says and Steve laughs.
Tony shrugs, “no idea. But his nurse was the
Steve moans again and Tony shivers in response as Steve picks up his pace a little, giving Tony some more enthusiasm. Tony tries mostly unsuccessfully to hold back his moans as Steve traces down his thigh and between his cheeks, probing at his hole. “
Yeah, he shouldn’t have agreed to this but Steve was all ‘but camping is
“Wait no, finish the story!” Sam yells, cackling as he battles it out with Rhodey for the tablet he’s on. Rhodey must win because the call drops. Tony shakes his head and abandons his phone on the floor and turns to face Steve. He’s got some paint on himself, but even with that he looks surprisingly attractive. Or maybe he looks attractive because of that. Whatever, Tony doesn’t discriminate.
“Fuck Steve, yeah,
Steve cocks his head to the side, smiling a little. “I don’t know about that. I’ve reconsidered, might be a little hot,” he says and Tony grins. Well, noted then. Not that he took Steve as the ‘mark my territory’ type, that’s absolutely more Bucky’s thing than his.
He follows Bucky’s instructions, pulling his hair a little and Bucky lets out a loud moan, fingers on Tony’s wrist tightening for a moment. “
“I do,” Tony tells him, letting out an irritated noise when Bucky pulls away.
Tony narrows his eyes, “because I’m fucking
“Not super difficult to make, assuming you have the right stuff lingering around,” he says.
Steve and Bucky exchange another look and
. Steve sighs, cheeks turning a little red. “Okay, and maybe I want to make him a little jealous,” he adds, embarrassed.
“Exactly what I was going to ask,” Steve snaps, clearly pissed off but Bucky rolls his eyes.
He curls his legs around Steve, nudging him closer. “You like to draw things more than talk about them,” he says. “Thought I’d give you a visual reminder of why talking about what you want is a good thing.” Steve’s hands curl around his legs as he licks his lips, looking Tony up and down as he flexes his fingers around his thighs.
“Be good for me,” Steve murmurs as he presses the toy to Tony’s hole. “Take it for me,” he says. Tony lets out a small, soft moan as Steve presses the toy into him slowly, taking his time. “That’s it,” Steve murmurs, “just like that.”
He turns back to Steve, “I can see why you brought him home.” People don’t talk to them like that; perk of being pretty widely feared even though they aren’t much known for lethal force. But still, people don’t stand up to them often and to a point they count on that to operate. Not that Tony gives a shit and Bucky likes that about him, knows Steve does too. ‘Course, if anyone decided to overstep their bounds with Tony they’d regret it faster than immediately.
“I like to feel fancy,” Tony says, nose in the air. Steve shakes his head and leans into his neck, nipping at the space under his jaw.
“Okay, aside from misadventures with bodily fluids anything interesting this week?” he asks.
. “Don’t fucking give me that shit, Steve.
Behind him Steve presses his face into Tony’s shoulder but it doesn’t do a whole lot to muffle him. “Oh my
“Sorry platypus, gotta go,” he says, cutting off Rhodey’s protest as he ends the call. He’ll deal with Rhodey yelling at him later, and Pepper too he’s sure.
“Eyes?”
that,” he says.
. Which is a real possibility hanging out with gang leaders
Steve snorts, “told you he was freaked out by it,” he tells Tony, smiling down at him.
supposed to run the stupid company so sometimes he gets stuck doing company things. Everyone hates him on account of being young, loud, and an omega but they’re all forced to admit that his ideas are good because out of the dozens that he’s presented only like five have failed. Granted plenty of people like to use that against him too but he keeps graphs of everyone’s successes and failures to point out he’s much better than them so they should maybe shut it with the criticisms. No one likes that much but whatever, not his problem.
, fuck that’s good,” he murmurs, hand finding its way back to Tony’s hip and gripping it tight. He guides Tony’s movements, starting out slow before he picks up the pace.
. “And clothing’s not that bad, you’re just slutty,” Rhodey tells him.
Yeah, they’ve lived together for almost eight months and Tony has yet to let his guard down fully and its not an alpha thing either, Tony just has a lot of trust issues. “Happy to have proven that I have basic critical thinking skills,” he says. “And I’ll tell Bucky to keep his salivation outside. Not sure if it’ll work, Bucky’s a dumb bitch but you can always throw him out the window.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky chuckled leaning forward to look at the snow falling through the sky, “ Yeah… Yeah, it is.”
"And do what? Hike? It'll be freezing! I say we go to Hawaii and do nothing but lay in the sun and eat chocolate-covered strawberries for 5 days straight." said Clint, Tony quickly agreeing with the beta.
Munching on his pop tart happily Peter went back into the living room. Settling down in his bed, grabbing his Stark Pad, and booting it up. 'At least while they're sleeping I can get some homework done.' He thought to himself as he loaded up the computer. Plugging in his headphones so he could listen to music while he worked.
So it went for the next few hours, Bucky would throw the ball in a direction and Peter would chase after it. Occasionally Bucky would ask Peter a random trivia or shout that his web-shooters were broken for the next five minutes just to get him to use his brain and problem-solving skills. Finally, after hours of throwing the ball, Peter collapsed into the snow panting hard his cheeks flushed from the cold and exertion. Buck smiled, satisfied with how well Peter had done as he knelt to help the pup up. Peter had a dopey grin on his face all along the walk back to the cabin.
“The brochure says that gear is required for this trail." Steve pointed out with a skeptical look.
"Seven! The lizard showed up as we were leaving from the giant robot fight." Peter corrected the wind roaring in his ears as he swung through the air.
“C’mon baby gotta wake up for me…” he persisted
Sam groaned as a green goop was splattered all over him. "Damn it." The beta whined as he whipped his glasses off a disgusted look on his face as he took his entire suit covered in the slimy substance "This stuff is gonna take forever to wash off."
Peter smiled, opening it up and taking out a handful. It was full of oats and fresh blueberries. One of the elk cows sniffed, taking a step towards him. Peter held out his hand to the cow and she took the treat from him. Tony watched anxiously as his only pup fed the elk with a glow of pure happiness around him.
Bucky steered Peter into the bathroom as quietly as possible. The pup needed no encouragement as he took the towel and PJs from Bucky. A few minutes later the pup came out of the bathroom clean and dry; hair still damp from his shower. Bucky steered him towards his bed ensuring that he did in fact make it to his bed rather than just giving up cuddling up with Tony and Steve.
She growled at him from her seat at the table “You wish, Soldier.” adding on “Maybe then you’d stand a chance against me in the ring.”
Steve had spent much of the morning in bed with Tony simply enjoying the more cuddly side of his omega. While Tony had never been a morning person he still often was called into meetings with pepper or struck with an idea at a god-forsaken hour so it was nice to be able to cuddle his omega for longer than a few moments. When Sam poked his head around the corner to tell him that breakfast was ready he decided it was time to get up. He cooed at his omega brushing a stray hair from his face.
Steve huffed, slightly hurt to be passed over so easily for the sake of a few pancakes but sat down nevertheless allowing everyone to start eating.
They agreed and quickly split up to go to their separate rooms.
"Already called Eye Patch!" Tony cut in "He bitched about it a bunch, but I managed to barter from now until noon Sunday and all for the low low price of some paperwork I’ve already had underoos sort and stamp for me." He reported an air of smugness coming into his voice at the end.
Suddenly aware of just how exhausted they all were, they decided to follow the pup’s lead, crawling into their own beds to catch up on some well-deserved rest.
“Thank you. Thank you.” Tony said without an ounce of humility, soaking up the praise like the attention-loving omega he was. When it quieted down he continued “So, where are we going for this little vacation?”
Natasha rolled her eyes “I'll be sure to put it on your gravestone. ‘Death by a pancake.’ Seems fitting for you.”
Tony had finally given in to sleep at around four in the morning, nestling under the covers and cuddling with Steve who held him tightly against his chest. Tony had purred happily drifting off.
Natasha cut in “Actually it was Bruce who woke him last. Remember? You told him you would buy him butter masala if he did. ”
They spent the rest of the trip in a massive cuddle puddle watching movies and just enjoying each other's company.
Peter shrugged nonchalantly as they walked over to where the jet was landing to take the pack back to the tower. "I'm Jarvis's favorite,"  he said as if that were a perfectly reasonable answer to always winning when it came to the randomizer.
He bounced up and down on his toes a little testing out the boots with glee. He turned, stopping up short when he saw the look on Steve’s face.
Bucky was next to arrive giving Peter an appreciative nod when he saw the dinner table laid out and ready for them. One by one the pack trickled indrawn by the smell of food or the chatter as the pack sat down to eat. Eventually, everyone was there except for one. Sam’s seat, which was right next to Bucky’s, was empty. Everyone looked at Clint.
“Dinner’s ready.” He told the beta happily, sliding off the bed and prancing into the kitchen.
Quick as a flash Peter tore the lid off and lifted the jug to his lips taking a big gulp. Natasha vaulted over the table, grabbing the container before the pup could get in another gulp of the sugary drink.
Clint blew out a shrill whistle, cutting them off before they started full-on fighting in the middle of the kitchen “If you two are done with your pissing match how about some breakfast?” He held up a box of pancake mix enticingly
Together they watched Peter feed, pet, and play with the elk until they moved on. Peter turned back to look at them with a jubilant look in his eyes. He bounced over to where his parents were and asked excitedly if they had seen him.
Natasha got out a bowl and started mixing the batter up while Bucky took care of cooking up the pancakes. They put Clint in charge of the fruit and Peter in charge of prepping the mixins. Nobody trusted that pup not to cut himself with a knife while he was already having trouble with keeping his hands still for more than a few seconds.
Natasha looked through it and found the box. With practiced ease, she boiled some water and made herself a cup. She didn't add sugar or milk to it having found that it overpowered the tea if she did. Not to mention that becoming too fond of the sweetness could be a weakness.
"Why don't we have Jarvis decide? Jarvis put all the options into a randomizer and pick one." Tony suggested as he landed next to where Bucky and Steve were waiting for the jet.
Bucky chuckled, ruffling the pup’s hair fondly as he helped him up the steps. “Got that runners high don’t ya pup?” he teased,
Natasha was just sitting down at the table, tea in hand, when a still half asleep Peter stumbled into the room. Rubbing his eyes with his fist the pup made his way over to the fridge. Pulling out a jug of orange juice the pup set it heavily on the counter. Usually, Peter was only allowed two shot glasses worth of the sugary drink otherwise he’d be bouncing off the walls all day. He studied the jug for a long moment looking between the jug, the cupboard, and finally Natasha.
Tony turned on him “They’re massive blood-thirsty beasts!”
The grumbling of a certain pup’s stomach pulled Steve from his moment, chuckling he opened his eyes to see a very much blushing Peter Parker ducking his head in a terrible attempt at hiding it. Shaking his head fondly at the pup’s obvious embarrassment he got up motioning for Peter to follow. Peter immediately tossed aside his tablet in favor of following Steve into the kitchen.
Clicking her tongue as she looked through the bags of food they had brought with them “Clint?” She asked looking up to see the archer starting on a pot of coffee
Now that everyone was fed and awake Peter was raring to go outside despite the fact that it was 30 degrees out and pitch black outside.
On the way out Tony made them stop at a coffee shop. Insisting in his usual over-the-top dramatic way that he was not going to make it to the airport without another cup of coffee. Bucky begrudgingly pulled the car over for him. Tony rushed inside the small hole in the wall looking shop like a starving animal. Taking one sip of the piping hot coffee he decided he needed every last drop. He bought up every bit of coffee the store had to offer and came back with arms full of his bounty purring all the while.
This is a little bit sad and I feel like an absolute idiot but it’s funny enough to mention it so... ya know what scene in Stan Lee is on that alien planet and he’s talking with those like four other aliens and telling them stories in guardians of the galaxy vol 2 (love that movie 10/10 will watch again)… it did not click for me that that was Stan Lee until almost 4 YEARS after the movie came out. I was going to bed and my brain decided that then and there was the perfect time to drop a bombshell on me. I….my stupidity amazes even myself at times.
He held it above his head in offering as he walked back outside. Peter nodded enthusiastically, his eyes trained on the old ball which Buck passed back and forth between his hands as he made his way to a clearing. Upon reaching the clearing Bucky turned in a split second and chucked the ball back the way he had come. Peter took off like a rocket after it, returning and dropping it in Bucky’s outstretched mitt just a few moments later.
"Let's go to the Grand Canyon!" Peter suggested excitedly
A yelp drew Tony’s attention to where Peter was glaring at Natasha rubbing his backside as if he had been swatted by the older omega.
Tony sighed contentedly, pinching a piece of strawberry from Steve's plate when he was too busy with his contest with Bucky to notice; popping it into his mouth and chewing it slowly to savor the sweet tangy taste.
“Do you know where my tea went?” She asked as she continued to look through the bags.
Steve shook his head fondly at the pup's fleeing form. "Meet back here in half an hour?" He asked the rest of the pack.
Later, when the early birds of the pack began to stir, it was very much apparent that Steve would not be joining them in helping make breakfast. At least not without prying himself away from a very cuddly Tony who was currently starfished onto him and having no intention of letting go any time soon.
Steve hummed thoughtfully "Maybe, Pup. Maybe. We'll have to see if we can get S.H.I.E.L.D to cover for us-"
Taking his seat at the table everyone immediately began passing around the bowls of food. Tony pointedly placed the bowl of salad in front of Peter. Peter, in silent rebellion, proceeded to then drown his salad in dressing. Tony rolled his eyes at the teen’s antics. Overall the meal was peaceful, nobody saying much of anything other than to ask for seconds. When all the food was finished everyone sat back with a groan of relief and satisfaction.
Peter dropped his head in submission “Sorry, Buck.”
Clint shook his head  “Don't know why you won't just drink coffee,” he teased her goodnaturedly continuing on before she could get in a jab of her own, “but yeah it’s in the 4th bag to the right. With the breakfast foods.”
Tony rolled over onto his stomach flipping Steve off with his face buried in the pillow.
Monster after giant robot after natural disaster with no breaks in between had left them all worn out. Sure some of them were enhanced but even so they were all still (mostly) human. Not to mention that the enhanced only accounted for a third of the team. For the rest of them well…. Let’s just say that the phrase “running on fumes” would be the understatement of the century.
Clint huffed crossing his arms over his chest in defiance “No. No way. I woke him up last time!” he bitched
“Well…..” Sam started cut off by the doorbell ringing.
Peter shrugged “If I am meant to die….choking on pancakes….then that is the way I shall go.” He said around a gigantic mouthful of the gluttonous cylinder.
They had decided on making four different kinds of pancakes: chocolate chip, banana, plain, and cinnamon. With, of course, the usual toppings of butter and syrup. They also had a platter’s worth of various fruit cut into bite-sized chunks.
"Vacation?" Peter asked hopefully
Chapter 1
Sunday morning everyone felt well-rested and ready to return home. The food they had brought with them was nearly gone now and Tony was on his last cup of coffee so things were beginning to get dire. Natasha took control of clean-up as she usually did and sent everyone on their normal clean-up duties. Steve and Bucky worked in tandem to get the bags into the car again. Peter was on clean up, finding and taking out all of the trash. Sam and Clint worked together to get all of the cameras down and the beds made when Tony was finished washing all of the bedding. And Natasha did the final touches to ensure that it looked as though they had never been there at all.
He blinked awake. It looked like it took a lot of effort. “Coffee?” he asked with vague interest.
The smell of fresh pancakes and friendly banter eventually managed to rouse the rest of the pack. Sam, surprisingly, managed to pull himself out of bed just as Buck was finishing off the last of the batter flipping the final pancake expertly through the air and onto the towering pile on the table.
Natasha huffed and, in spite of her best efforts, felt a smile twitch at her lips as she sat back at her seat. Taking a sip of her chamomile tea to hide her amusement she said “True as that may be…. They’ll still be mad at me for letting you get wired at six-thirty in the morning.”
Sam followed, choosing not to comment when he saw Clint slip a twenty to Natasha upon Peter walking into the room. He had decided long ago that some things were better not to ask about.
“Then yeah. You are. Now if you’ll excuse me I have a date with some pancakes.”Peter sassed, wiggling out of Steve’s arms and sitting down at his seat in between Tony and Natasha. Picking up his knife and fork and looking at Steve expectantly; waiting for him to sit before he started like the good pup that he was.
Bucky looked back in the rearview mirror at Sam's chuckle. Upon catching sight of the awed pup, his face so close to the glass it was fogging up with each breath the hyperactive omega took, Bucky's usually stoic face lit up in amusement. In a teasing tone, he asked "You tryin' to merge with that glass, Pete’?"
Peter grinned triumphantly at the older omega who was screwing the cap back onto the container and putting it back into the fridge.
Steve got up to see what it was. Sitting outside the front door in neatly packed backpacks was all the things they would need for their hike. They were sensible, sturdy canvas bags of varying shades of browns and greys. Complete with walking sticks to match. Steve turned around to scowl at the two betas who at least had the decency to look sheepish. When Steve's back was turned Peter had come following him to the door. Squealing with delight when his eyes landed on the bags he dashed past Steve to kneel beside them excitedly checking the tags to see which was his. His smile widened to a Cheshire cat’s grin when he found his. It was the light grey bag with light brown leather straps that complimented it well. Flipping the top open he was greeted with everything he could possibly want during a hike. There was a plethora of snacks, a water bottle, and a pair of hiking boots and socks among other things.
She shook her head in exasperation “Your dads are gonna kill me when you’re literally bouncing off the walls later today.”
Shutting the fridge he walked over to the bags of non-perishable food on the counter. After looking through them he eventually settled on a bag of pop-tarts. Not bothering to toast them because despite what Bucky says pop tarts don't need to be toasted to be good.
Peter grinned, bouncing over to Bucky excitedly. Bucky huffed, slinging off his bag and opening it up. Peter tilted his head curiously. Bucky smiled, pulling out three things. A water bottle, a pack of their specially made protein bars, and finally a small black plastic bag. Peter zeroed in on the bag immediately “What’s that? Bucky? What is it?! Can I have it? What’s in it? Who’s it for?” Peter questioned him excitedly.
Almost everyone was asleep and snoring peacefully by the time they returned except for Tony, but there was no real surprise there. He gave them a small wave from where he was sitting up in bed with Steve sleeping beside him. The soft blue glow of his reactor contrasted with the harsher light of his pad. Even at its lowest brightness the screen still seemed too bright against the darkness of the room.
Snarling mockingly when the snow clump hit him square in the chest he gave chase. Peter yelped floundering through the snow in an attempt to get enough momentum to swing from tree to tree. Together they raced through the dark, silent forest until they looped back to the cabin. Bucky ran inside and dug out his mitt and wore out baseball from where he had stashed it in his bag. It was always a sure-fire way of tiring the pup out when running him just didn't seem to be cutting it.
Peter flopped onto his bed, his legs hanging off the edge, a satisfied sigh on his lips having completed his task of sorting through the Avenger’s things. ‘Who knew that Natasha had so much makeup or that Sam had 3 different bottles of lotion for his face alone?’ Everyone slowly trickled back into the cabin finding their beds and looking through their to-go bags for whatever it was they needed. The quiet chatter of the pack along with the classic rock Tony had cast onto the tv began to lull the pup into a light sleep.
, as if Tony would just offer that information up. “Long lines to the bathroom, sports fans who start riots when their teams lose, the smell of the bathroom if Steve’s accidentally eaten some gluten. Seriously, if you guys want to take him out so bad feed him some bread.” Tony kind of thought Steve was making up his long list of allergies and things he couldn’t eat but lost that line of thinking when Steve had unthinkingly gotten into some leftovers Tony had brought back from one of his favorite Italian restaurants. Needless to say he and Bucky ended up flat out vacating the apartment and he kind of felt bad for Steve but also his nose hairs were burning.
He sighs. “Buck. Its one time for Tony and besides that would you rather him come home tired or sexually frustrated?” he asks, appealing to Bucky’s caveman brain.
Steve sighs though; pulling away some more so there must be some type of validity to Bucky’s statement. He leans in and gives Tony one last quick kiss before he turns to Bucky. “If he’s late again I’m going to shot him.”
“Doesn’t mean I can’t watch,” Tony says a little primly. Steve smiles at him again and grabs the dildo with one hand and reaches out to Tony with the other, feeling his hole. “You think you’ll be okay?” Steve asks, sliding two fingers in and Tony bites his lip, nodding. “What did I tell you about that?” Steve says. Tony huffs out a sigh because he can’t help it, its instinct.
There’s a long pause before Steve finally sighs. “Tony,” he says, “did you tell Bucky we moved?” he asks.
“I don’t fuckin care.”
brought this up. You shat the bed, you lie in it. Two, I’m trying to sleep right now and if you two don’t get that god damn racket your making out of my face by the time I’m done talking you won’t
“Steve has many ideas, many of them bad unless its food with garlic,” he says.
bold. “That, and Steve accidentally ate gluten and stunk me out of the apartment for almost three days so its probably best that you’re in London,” he adds, obviously to Steve’s chagrin.
For a moment Tony doesn’t respond but then he squints a little. “Are… you even affected my me?” he asks and Steve frowns.
“Tomorrow you’re probably going to wake me up at stupid o’clock in the morning to fuck,” Steve points out.
“One thing for Tony and you can’t even manage that?” he asks.
“Not maybe, this is lifted directly from the page. Points for attention to detail,” he murmurs, fingers trailing up Tony’s thigh on the stockings. Yeah, Tony made sure they matched what Steve drew.
Steve flips him off, “you got him up until now so shut up,” he says.
Tony leans in and kisses him. “Did not, you’re just dramatic,” he tells Bucky.
“How did you do that?” Steve murmurs eventually and Tony shrugs.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve murmurs. “Now shower.” He rolls his eyes but lets Steve drag him off to the shower and lets him do most of the work washing him too, just because he can and also because he’s tired. When Bucky inevitably shows up to ruin his shower Steve leaves him there to suffer under the spray while he goes and deals with it. He can
here, and clearly he’s willing, and there’s no time like now so he leans into Steve, arms making their way around Steve’s neck. Steve runs his hands up Tony’s sides and back down again lightly and Tony knows from experience that, if he had suppressants on him, this is about the point of no return anyway. He knows because Steve’s touch, however light it is, feels better than it would normally and he wants out of his clothes
“Yeah, if you think you’ve been clear you’ve probably actively told him you’re not interested. You suck with words,” Rhodey tells him and oh fuck off, he does not.
Sam sighs, considering for a moment before he must decide to go ahead with it. “Most people kind of define their sexuality through the scope of their gender, but I know you uh-” he stops, frowning as he finds a good way to explain his thoughts.
Steve’s attempting to get his stupid sill life assignment done when Tony rolls in looking a little worse for wear. “You okay?” he asks, looking up at Tony over his sketch pad.
baby, come on.” Tony grins and shifts his hips, causing both Steve and Bucky to moan. “Or do that,” Steve says. “That’s also good.”
“Thanks for the warning,” he says, earning an offended noise out of Steve.
He rolls his eyes, “I’d say I’d rather shoot myself but Hammer weapons are so shit I can’t even rely on them to not jam when I do it. They had wanted me to fix the guns but I can’t fix design flaws when the design
“You are no longer my best friend Tony! You are fired!” Rhodey yells at him.
did you do to him?” he asks, eyes landing on the hand print on Tony’s him.
damn Tony, do that again,” he tells him. Tony shifts his hips a little and Steve’s fingers tighten on his hips. Bucky’s have found their way to his thighs and he grips tighter too. Tony smiles, carefully shifting his hips in small, soft motions that leave Bucky and Steve panting. “Little faster Tony, give us some more of that,” Steve murmurs in his ear. He moves Tony’s hips himself, telling him without words what he wants.
that?” Tony asks. He definitely didn’t pack it and he doesn’t remember Steve packing it.
Bucky snorts, “just because your being a dumbass doesn’t mean I need to suffer for it,” he says. Steve tries to smack him again but Tony gets to his hand first, forcibly pulling it closer to him and weaving their fingers together.
indulged him in. The rest- he’s managed to talk one or both of them into his plans. “
tries to make an escape but Tony is sitting in his lap so that doesn’t happen. Tony smacks his leg with his free hand. “You stop that. You’re not going anywhere and this is your room anyway,” Tony points out.
make spending time with him worth their time? He doesn’t half ass things so that’s just rude. “Yeah, uh huh, name it,” he tells them, waving a hand around.
“Sure, I’ll go hit Howard up for a place to-”
“Just fuck me,” he tells Steve. Steve’s eyes flick down from his face to his ass, considering a moment, before he gives Tony a cocky smile.
“Holy fucking Christ you feel amazing,” Bucky says, right in his ear and Tony moans.
teasing you but you weren’t picking up what I was putting down.”
He does his best to hold in his excitement at that and he’s sure he fails at it though he follows Bucky’s instructions quickly. He earns a pleased noise out of Bucky for doing so too. After a few moments of nothing Tony wiggles his ass a little, a silent invitation for Bucky to get a move on. Bucky’s hand touches his hip finally, sliding up his side and back down again as Bucky crawls in closer, nudging Tony’s legs apart as he does. Tony obliges, spreading his legs a little wider and grinning when Bucky sucks in a breath. “That’s it,” Bucky murmurs, sliding a hand up Tony’s ass, settling on the small of his back for a moment. “You look good like this,” Bucky tells him; thumb caressing the small of his back.
Steve drops his sticks beside what Tony assumes will at some point be a fire and perches himself on the log Tony is grudgingly perched on. He’d prefer
Shit, that in itself almost earns him a moan. Steve shakes his head a little and returns his attentions back to Tony. “You gunna stare all day or do something?” Tony asks, head tilted to the side.
want this,” he murmurs as he runs a finger over Tony’s hole and yeah he fucking does. “God,” Steve says softly, “
“Not like I want you to, baby. Move your hand,” Steve murmurs. Tony lets out a put upon sigh but allows Steve to move his hand away. “God a surprise for you,” Steve tells him. Tony shifts himself so he can see what Steve’s got and he’s surprised to find a dildo.
“Are so, but I’ll let it pass,” Tony says, kissing him softly.
Steve laughs softly, nuzzling Tony’s neck. “Ready?” he murmurs, nipping at the already over sensitive skin on Tony’s neck.
Tony’s half asleep in Steve’s arms when Steve sits straight up, dislodging Tony from his position of comfort. “Get back here,” he mumbles, reaching out for Steve.
“S’not that hard to do if you know what to mix together. And they were the idiots who left me the ingredients to chlorine gas in the damn closet.” Those Christmas decorations had been convenient little bombs too, once he gassed himself out of his prison cell and managed to locate a more workable stash of weapons. Needless to say he’s pretty sure HYDRA was pissed off that he managed to fuck them over like he had but its really not his fault people consistently underestimate him. Even Bucky had look surprised before Tony passed out completely. He assumes Steve brought him back home.
“That isn’t a thing. I don’t even know what that means but its not a thing,” Tony tells him.
“The fuck do you,
Tony wheezes out a laugh, “oh, I’d die before I made you shit,” he says, dead serious.
Steve runs a hand up his thigh and Tony shivers, sensitive to the touch even through his clothes. Steve pulls away a little and Tony lets out a small noise of distress that makes Steve laugh a little. “Shh,” he murmurs, pressing his forehead to Tony’s. “I just want to make sure you’re fine with this, not that you’ve got like… I don’t know, heat brain or something,” he says and Tony snorts.
Yeah, uh huh, he’s sure it is. He presses himself back into their hands, trying to push them as deep as they can go and he lets out a noise of frustration when its not enough. “Want you,” he tells them, “
Tentatively, Tony spreads his legs more, smiling when Steve sucks in a breath and leans in a little. He reaches over himself slowly, carefully tracing his hole as Steve watches, eyes glued to his every move. He teases himself a little, back arching a little as he slides a finger in some and then pulls it back out. Fuck its good, watching Steve watch him as he teases himself. Steve licks his lips as he leans forward to spread Tony’s legs wider. “Want you to move a little faster, baby. Want to see you fuck yourself on your fingers,” Steve tells him.
“Yeah,” Steve says, “since you go out of your way to… fulfill our fantasies.”
Tony shrugs, “stuck a postit on the fridge with the address.”
over his shoulder, “rude,” he tells him though he smiles, grabbing Bucky’s hand and placing it on his hip as he makes his way to Bucky’s room. Bucky follows behind him enthusiastically, letting Tony pull him along until they get to his room and then he pulls Tony to his so his back is flush with Bucky’s chest.
how much of a mess you have to be for me to consider you a hot mess,” he says meaningfully.
Tony lets out a soft gasp as Steve slides a finger in and pulling it back out. “Two fingers,” Tony tells him, “wanna feel you.” Steve’s pace falters for a moment at that but he recovers fast, thankfully, and presses two fingers into Tony. He bites his lip and tries his best not to buck his hips as Steve pumps his fingers in and out. Steve pulls off and Tony makes a small noise of disappointment.
Tony nods at nothing in particular, shifting his hips so they get a better angle and yeah, that’s it, that’s what he’s looking for. “Look at that,” Steve murmurs, “look at you fucking yourself on our fingers. So fuckin hot.”
“Tony,” Steve all but moans out and Tony’s pretty sure he doesn’t even know what he’s asking for, not really, and that makes this all the better. He carefully presses another finger in, shifting to get a better angle and moaning as he presses in a little deeper.
“Not especially relevant to my life, so no. I have a bunch of cold and sinus shit though, might help with the fever at least.” It can’t be comfortable, being that hot. Okay, actually he knows its not comfortable given that he
It’s tempting with half the work taken out of it but there’s still the standing problem so he refuses to move. Steve sighs, “come on, Tony. Before you either fall asleep or jump me again.”
that’s good. Steve’s hand moves its way down his back again, hand spread out across as much as Steve can reach before he pulls his hand out of Tony’s shirt and he whines. “
But then they lean in and Tony’s face is practically on the screen now he’s so close and they do it. They kiss and Tony is having a hard time remembering to breath right now because he’s probably imagined this like five billion times. They pull apart for a brief moment, Bucky giving the computer a glance and grinning when he must mostly only see Tony’s eyes given that he’s all but attached the screen in front of him but Steve,
He’s never appreciated when smart people pretend to be stupid so Tony gives him a
There’s a list, and also a list of things he wants to try but he leaves that particular list alone for the moment. “Like it when you two work together, always feels like you’re telling each other something I’m out of the loop on but when I-
“Um, ‘scuse you, I think it is,” Tony tells him.
“Want you to, baby,” Tony tells him. Steve losses his pace a little as his hips stutter and then pick up speed.
He repeats his actions, pulling Bucky’s hair harder this time and he’s rewarded with a tighter grip on his hip and Bucky panting against his shoulder blade. “Okay, okay,” he murmurs, pressing a kiss to Tony’s shoulder. He starts moving his way down Tony’s back, his fingers detangling from Bucky’s hair as he goes, leaving a trail of kisses down his back. He stops at Tony’s tailbone, leaving a soft kiss there before he pulls away. “Ass up,” he tells Tony, patting his hip.
Bucky makes a soft, appreciative noise as he runs his hand up Tony’s back slowly before getting to his neck and curling his fingers around the back of it. Tony can’t help the small shiver he lets out as Bucky leans in, pressing more weight into the back of his neck. “You gunna cooperate for me, baby?” Bucky murmurs in his ear.
“Dunno if that’s possible,” Tony murmurs. He goes to say something else but Steve scents him, nipping at the sensitive skin of his neck after and Tony moans. “Do that again,” Tony tells him.
“Want you inside me, both of you, like
The look of relief on Bucky’s face tells him that’s what Bucky wants to hear. “Yeah, I mean it was his idea,” Bucky says, rationalizing. In his defense he’s not wrong, Steve actually
Its not like this is the first time this has ever happened to Tony but it does happen to be the first time he’s been snatched for mob purposes and from people who actually give a shit about him. Howard? He mostly only cared that someone would be around to take over the company but Steve and Bucky genuinely care about him so this is bound to be interesting.
Steve releases his wrist and shimmies down the bed some, lifting Tony’s legs to get a better view of his ass. “You have no idea how sexy this is,” Steve tells him, “bein so wet for me like this, wantin me to use you.” He shakes his head, “kinda been a long time fantasy of mine too,” he admits, but softly.
“Mhm,” he agrees, “yours.”
“Then do it,” Tony tells him. “Want you to.” Steve still pauses, considering this for a moment and Tony pouts at him, prodding his hand back to his ass. “Want you,” he tells Steve. That seems to be the encouragement Steve needs to go ahead with what he wants and Tony gasps as he presses two fingers into him at once.
