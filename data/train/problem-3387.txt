When he looked back over his shoulder again, he found Anna back at work with the Impala, completely unsupervised. Dean twisted around before he broke his neck and scrambled to Anna before she broke anything.
Once they made it home, Dean showed Anna to her room, which was his bedroom because he didn’t have a bed in his guest room yet. Not that Dean ever used his bedroom anymore. He either slept on his couch or Castiel’s couch. Dean couldn’t remember what sleeping on a bed felt like anymore.
Anna was showing Castiel the pictures when Dean called the waiter to the table. The waiter, a tall man with a nice smile—was he giving Dean a
Their search took up most of the day. They looked at so many places, Dean lost track of how many. Castiel didn’t seem too eager about any of them, even when Dean pointed out the swimming pool in one of the apartment complexes. Castiel’s response to that was a scrunched-up nose and a, “I don’t really swim.”
When Dean got home from work, he found Lisa and Ben playing with his Legos on the living room floor.
Dean practically ran out of Charlie and Rosa’s house, jogging all the way to his driveway up the street. He went inside directly to the fridge for a beer and then to his backyard, where he slumped down onto a chair, shut his eyes, and gulped down the bitter liquid.
“Ellen is a snitch,” Dean grumbled. “And a thief. She stole my keys, Cas. She took them and I didn’t even notice.”
But when Dean turned around, he ran into the last person he wanted to see. Bela was standing on set, staring at them curiously.
Dean mirrored the position, and they lay there quietly, letting their gazes drift to the stars that seemed bright enough to light up the sky.
“Okay, first, those apologies sucked,” Dean said. “Second, this isn’t the time to get into your family drama. And third, keep your voices down. Claire is sleeping.”
Dean laughed, turning around in his arms. Castiel’s hair was completely ruffled and his blue tie was crooked. Dean fixed the tie for him, feeling giddy because he could do this now. “I couldn’t sleep more than four hours without you. It’s a problem.”
“You’re not inviting your date inside?” Sam asked, grinning from ear to ear. He tried to look outside the window, but Dean shoved him aside. “Hey, watch it, jerk.”
Lisa groaned. “See, you always do this, Dean. You make me look like the bad guy when I put my foot down. I don’t want Ben to have a dog because there’s no one to take care of it, but you make me sound like I’m this monster who doesn’t want my son to have a dog. I’m always the strict parent in Ben’s eyes. You’re the one who can’t say no to anything, so I have to be the one that says no. I hate that you put me in this role. I wish you were…”
Dean took a long swig from his beer, and the cold bitterness felt so good. He hadn’t realized he’d started crying until the wind hit his face and he felt the cold wetness on his cheeks.
Castiel met Dean’s gaze, moving his mouth back to Dean’s, kissing him until Dean was moaning. Blindly, Castiel reached for the bottle of lubricant that was on the nightstand. He knelt between Dean’s legs as he spread the lubricant on his fingers. The first time, Castiel had been worried about hurting Dean, but the process had been far easier than he had imagined. This time, he knew what he was doing a little better, so he was more confident when he inserted the first fingers on Dean’s opening.
Castiel knew that this was something he had to do. He’d talked about it with Jody hundreds of times. It was part of the grieving process and he’d always known it would be difficult. But he
“Hell yeah,” Dean said. “Harrison Ford was my first crush. Han Solo and Indiana Jones were my sexual awakening.”
Dean tried to take the phone back, but Castiel was having none of that, blocking all of Dean’s attempts. “We were having a nice talk, asshole.”
Castiel was suddenly interested. He liked Charlie. Maybe going down there would help stir his creativity. “Alright. I’m going to the coffee shop. You want me to pick you up something?”
“I find you infuriating. I wanna learn things from you. I never considered that I’d be losing my favorite professor in all this.”
Gabriel clapped Castiel’s shoulder. “You’ll get used to all of this. Just take it easy at first. Don’t fly too fast. There’s a lot of us out there. Try to follow the current, and you’ll be alright. As for your dear old husband, I’d suggest you keep him hidden.” Gabriel glanced at Dean. “After tonight’s show, chances are all angels are on the lookout for my studio to get to you.”
“I’m a mechanic,” Dean finally said. “I’m starting work on Monday at a garage owned by an old family friend. It’s one of the reasons we moved here. I knew I’d be able to get a job, and I get to live closer to my younger brother.”
“Yeah, me neither,” Dean said, thinking about his last serious relationship. It had been over a year since Lisa, and he just hadn’t thought about anything more than a fling every now and then. Thought about it, not even done it. And it wasn’t because he was hung over Lisa, it was because he’d gotten tired of looking. There had been no time for anything in the past year. Nothing besides…
Then, Castiel cleared his throat, interrupting Dean’s train of thought. He was smiling sideways, and Dean met his eyes. Dean knew he’d been caught staring at Castiel’s lips, and he flushed, feeling the sudden heat in his cheeks. “You okay there?”
Castiel hovered on top of Dean, careful not to lay on the mess he’d left behind, but Dean didn’t seem to care, pulling him back in his arms. “Ugh, we don’t have anything to clean ourselves up, Dean.”
They sat together on the couch, eating muffins. Dean had the suspicion that Castiel had come this early with the sole intention of checking up on him after yesterday. Dean hadn’t bothered to hide how much his recent argument with Lisa had affected him. It was nice to see how much Castiel cared, not wanting to leave Dean alone with his thoughts too long.
Dean rolled his eyes, grabbing his phone from the nightstand. He went back to the kitchen for his coffee while he dialed Sam’s number.
Dean took a deep breath, taking another sip of rum. “God, I really hate that I won’t be able to finish my road trip. It was so damn hard taking eight days off from work to come here. Now I’ll have to wait another century before I can take another vacation.”
When their last reader left with their signed book, Dean turned to Castiel with a smile. “We did it.”
In all these months, Dean had never been to Castiel’s house. They’d always gone back to Dean’s apartment. Dean felt the most comfortable there. Besides, Jack would always bring them two coffees, ever since Castiel staying over became a regular thing. Jack wasn’t at all surprised to find that Dean and Castiel were together. In fact, he thought it’d taken them long enough.
“You’re gonna love it. There’s nothing else like it. The first time you hold your baby in your arms, and you feel how tiny that little human is, how fragile, it’s incredible. You just know you’re gonna spend the rest of your life caring for them. Loving them. Protecting them. It’s love like you’ve never felt before.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, waving a hand. “I noticed the damn sign. Actually talked to the owner. He’s weird.”
“Cassie and I were just going to watch a movie and eat some popcorn,” Gabriel said. “You can stick around.”
on a tight schedule, but he also hadn’t been with anyone in over a year. And after what had happened two months ago, he thought he would never be able to get back out there. He’d felt so empty, inside and out. If there was a chance he could get lucky with this guy, then maybe it would get him back on the right path. It had been two months, and he still felt completely lost.
Dean arched his back and lifted his hips, making Castiel move with the action. “Peachy. Just peachy.”
Dean rolled his eyes, pulling Castiel to an empty table. “You’re back for one day and you’re already everyone’s favorite.”
Dean pushed his uneaten burger away. “Thanks for the beer. I think I’ll head home early today, if that’s okay. I gotta clean out the garage. We might need the storage space.”
Dean crawled to the backseat after him, and they fell onto the seats comfortably. They moved around until Dean was underneath Castiel, who had him pinned and was kissing him senseless. Castiel slid a hand down Dean’s torso, touching him everywhere he could before he reached the button of Dean’s pants. It didn’t take him long to unbutton him and unzip him, and then he grabbed Dean’s cock in his hands. Dean gasped into his mouth, arching up.
Charlie gave him a look. “That doesn’t sound platonic to me. You can’t be that stupid, right? Tell me you know how weird this sounds.”
“Were you speaking from personal experience?” Claire asked, grinning from ear to ear. “You know, with all the rose of Sharon stuff?”
Dean furrowed his eyebrows before he placed his hand on top of Castiel’s, who turned it over so his palm was up. “What are you doing?”
to kick him out. I should have been the one to leave. I’ve been worried sick since he left because I don’t know where he went. His mom’s always traveling, his sister's in New York, and he doesn’t have any other living relatives. Shit, what if he went to your place?”
“Three,” Dean said, followed quickly by the loudest scream Castiel had ever heard. It was a jarring sound on such a quiet night.
They made it to the bar only five minutes late. Dean was sure Charlie didn’t mind because she was with Jo, and she probably wanted some alone time with her. Yesterday, Dean had asked if she preferred to go alone with Jo, but Charlie had insisted for Dean to join them. So here he was, with Castiel.
Ben and Claire started tossing the balloon back and forth. It was really sweet seeing them both giggling with every throw. Claire got really excited every time she missed the balloon and had to run after it. Ben was patient with her since it took her some time to run for it and come back to her spot to pass it back to him.
“Help will be here soon,” Dean reminded him. “Why don’t you just talk to me while we get out of here? Get it out of your mind, huh?”
When they got to the tattoo parlor, Castiel picked out a font he liked and went into a room with a heavily tattooed bald man. Dean’s tattoo artist was a heavily tattooed woman named Pam with a collection of facial piercings. She looked awesome.
“I’m not handing her the phone,” Castiel said. If Lisa wanted to have secret conversations with this man behind Dean’s back, Castiel wouldn’t make it easy for her. The nerve of that woman. How could she do this to Dean? Not that Castiel knew exactly what she’d been doing to Dean. But it didn’t look good. Castiel pushed the phone back to the side, glaring at it until it stopped ringing.
Anna sighed. “It’s not that great. I mean, it’s big and full of expensive stuff, but I live there alone. I don’t really like being there on my own. Fortunately, I spend most of my time on my shifts at the hospital.” She was quiet for a moment. “You have a family here, Castiel. You have a man that loves and takes care of you, a daughter who adores you, and even a dog who happily follows you around.” There was sadness in her eyes when she looked at him. “Maybe you were right to get away from our family. Maybe I should have done that, too.”
“I’m not defending her, dear. But every person has the right to be with the one they love. Clearly, things hadn’t been working out between Dean and Lisa for quite a while. It was only a matter of time before that relationship ended. You said it yourself, Dean was willing to put up with Lisa cheating on him because he knew she didn’t want to be with him anymore. If he’d still loved her, he wouldn’t have been alright with that. There was no love in that relationship. Both Dean and Lisa deserve to find love. But I won’t defend Lisa for being so extreme. That was wrong.”
“Well, I hope Canada makes you very happy in the summer.” Castiel reached for the door handle, but Dean stopped him, a hand on his forearm.
Dean blushed, lowering his head. He did that every time Castiel kissed him, no matter where he kissed him. Maybe Dean should be questioning why Castiel kissed him so often, but he liked it too much to rock the boat. “Thanks, but I’m still a beginner.”
Dean shook Castiel’s hand next, and he immediately liked the way his nose crinkled when he smiled. “It’s nice to meet you guys. I’m Dean Winchester, and this is my son, Ben. Say hi, Ben.”
“Yeah? I haven’t really thought that far ahead. I just know I want to quit my job. I’ll only work for the two weeks I have to, and then I’m done.”
Going through their DVD collection was a walk through memory lane. Most of the movies they owned had belonged to Mary. And she was a big rom-com fan. She basically owned the entire Meg Ryan collection. But she had also been a big fan of the classics. Although Dean had seen many of them—and liked some—he hadn’t seen
While Lisa took care of business, Dean was keeping Ben entertained. And he’d run out of games to play in the front yard while they waited for the movers to be done inside. They’d already played tag and rock-paper-scissors dozens of times. Ben might only be five, but he still required a high level of entertainment, which Dean was clearly not providing at the moment.
“It’s forgotten,” Charlie said, smiling. “Now tell me how did this happen? I always knew there had to be something there. You two always had that spark.”
Dean. Castiel was a happy drunk, and he was already tipsy, and this was his favorite song at the moment, so he drew Dean closer and pressed their bodies together. Castiel slammed Dean up against a wall, where Dean’s legs fit perfectly between Castiel’s, leaving easy access for Castiel to move his torso in perfect harmony to the song. This wasn’t the first time they danced this way together, but Dean was beaming at Castiel’s enthusiasm, encouraging him to move faster while he just stood there and enjoyed the show. Castiel gripped Dean’s shoulders, which allowed him to go lower, shaking his ass as he descended the length of Dean’s body. The movement was slow, but the look Dean gave him was thrilling.
“We shall,” Dean said, taking Castiel’s hand. Before Castiel pulled him away, Dean turned to Jess again. “Call us if you need anything. We won’t be home too late.”
Dean only lifted a hand in greeting. Not even a smile. Things must be worse than he’d made them out to be. After the potluck, Dean hadn’t come around. Castiel had tried texting and calling, but Dean hadn’t answered. Castiel had doubted that Dean would show up today, for their weekly
It appeared that most of his employees were taking their lunch at the same time because Dean found Bobby, Ash, Benny, and Kevin in the breakroom. He went straight to the vending machine, digging out his wallet for a dollar.
“We are. So close that he can be a pain in the ass most of the time, but I love him. Sammy’s the one that keeps me sane.”
Cas had the sweetest smile Dean had ever seen. He didn’t think he’d ever get tired of seeing it, especially when it was directed at him. “So, I guess that means we’re slow dancing on our second date?”
Dean checked his phone for the time and saw that it was getting late. Maybe Sam was right. Maybe Dean should just pick something. He smiled at his phone wallpaper. Ben was on Dean’s lock screen, but Claire was on his home screen. As soon as Dean saw Claire’s picture, the answer hit him. It had been so obvious. What did Castiel love the most?
“Hate list? What is this, high school?” Charlie chuckled. “Also, if you hate him so much you wouldn’t have your very own nickname for him. You’re literally the only person in the entire building who calls him anything other than Castiel.”
Lisa shook her head, blinking away tears. “At first I thought that maybe he was sick, or that the sudden change of scenery had upset him, but I couldn’t lie to myself forever. He was miserable because he missed you, Dean. Not a day went by that he didn’t ask for you. Benjamin stepped up. He was a great father to Ben, like I knew he would be. He took him to the park, he bought him toys, he played with him, but nothing made Ben happy. Eventually, I caved and got him a dog because I thought maybe that would do the trick. And it did help restore some of that light back in his eyes, but he still asked for you.” Lisa looked back at Dean, eyes filled with regret.
Castiel laughter, and Dean smiled. The sound of Castiel’s laughter was something Dean would have to get used to. He found out he really liked it. “I love being right.”
“Oh, Dean, this one is fantastic.” Castiel licked his fingers this time, and Dean’s mind went straight to the gutter. Dear God, Castiel was the most seductive pie eater Dean had ever met. He was driving him crazy.
Castiel took a deep breath. “Dean told me that Lisa left with Ben. Apparently, she decided they needed to move with Benjamin to California. But she refused to give Dean any details. She doesn’t want Dean to contact them again.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, looking slightly embarrassed by the admittance. He shifted uncomfortably for a moment. “I guess I thought that maybe I wasn’t relationship material. It sounds stupid, I know. But Lisa had just dumped me because she thought I was a bad boyfriend. And—I don’t know—I found comfort in not giving a fuck about the people I slept with. It was easy. No strings attached.”
In the morning, Dean felt perfectly alright again so he kept his chin up and shared the tale to his new coworkers, laughing it off as a fun anecdote.
But Dean was thinking about Ben again and then he was crying. Usually, he didn’t cry in front of others, but Dean was done giving a damn. So he burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably with the pain returning all over again. Ben had been taken from him. Ripped away. How could Dean go through the rest of his life without his son? Who would read Ben his bedtime stories and tuck him in bed? And then, Dean remembered that Lisa had left behind Doug the Dog. That was Ben’s favorite toy. She couldn’t even let Ben keep that small memory of Dean.
This morning, you looked particularly beautiful. Your eyes were closed as I kissed down your body, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of you. The sounds coming out of you were better than any song I’d ever heard. And then, when your fingers dug into my hair as I kissed lower and lower, you bit your lip. My God, the things that does to me. I know that the only time you bite your lip is when you’re savoring what’s happening, and what is yet to happen.
Dean took the Tylenol and drank the full glass of water, and then hid his hands under his pillow since it was the only thing he had available to give him warmth. With the shivers and chills, he still managed to lose consciousness somehow.
Dean’s heart was racing as he stepped into the breakroom. He spotted Castiel sitting at a table with Claire on his lap. As soon as she noticed him, her arms went up.
Dean’s leg was bouncing and he kept staring at the door, wondering if his odds were good enough to outrun Castiel back outside.
Dean set down the plates on the coffee table and sat on the couch. “Yeah, I love all types of stories.”
As soon as the elevator doors opened Castiel guided them both inside. They made their way to the bottom floor with Dean’s face still hidden away to avoid the glass windows. Once they reached the ground and the doors opened, Dean lifted his face, wary eyes making sure there was no danger. Castiel kept a hand on the small of Dean’s back, walking close beside him until they reached the street.
Dean and Castiel both laughed, and so did their guests. Dean had already forgotten about how much he was sweating.
Castiel flicked his gaze to Claire, and his eyes filled with tears. He pulled them both to his arms, kissing both of their faces over and over. “Thank you for being here. I’ve missed you both so much.”
But Dean wasn’t sure what any of it meant. Could Dean be gay, after all? What about all those girls he’d dated? Dean checked out girls as much as he checked out guys. It was all so confusing.
Dean grinned down at his plate. He always got shy with compliments. “So, what romcom are we watching after dinner?”
Cas took a shaky breath. “I’ve told you before that men have used me for sex. Pretty much all my life. After they get what they want, they leave. So I have a hard time processing that you might want to stay after we have sex.”
Dean hesitated. “Cas, am I the first person you’ve been with that you’ve introduced to your parents?”
Dean kissed the top of Ben’s head before he continued unpacking. There was a lot to do, but Dean wanted to have most of it done by the time Lisa got home. He wanted to surprise her after a long day of work.
Dean’s heart was racing, but for all the wrong reasons. “I know where this conversation will take us, but I’m not ready to go there. Not now.”
Dean glanced at Bobby, knowing the look on his face was something crumbling, but he followed behind Lisa and Ben.
Dean sighed, holding back his comment on the wreck he’d caused and Castiel’s injuries. “Can I borrow your phone? I wanna call Cas and see how he’s holding up. I’m sure the movie he was watching is over by now.”
as though it were a lifeline. Crowded places gave him anxiety. But this place wasn’t just packed, it was loud. Very loud. People all around him were talking in animated voices. He couldn’t make out what they were saying, but he kept hearing “Dean” in all of their sentences.
Dean hadn’t been able to stop smiling since he woke up, and people were starting to notice. First, Pamela pointed out how different Dean was acting from the previous day.
While Castiel was out getting groceries, Dean sat on a chair in front of Claire’s crib while she lay there calmly. Dean wanted to play the song he’d been practicing on his guitar for Claire and this was the best time to do it. The blisters on his fingers had gone away, but there was still a numbness to them the more Dean pressed up against the hard strings. But even with all the pain it caused him, Dean enjoyed playing the guitar. He thought that he had improved significantly in the past few weeks.
“Okay,” Dean said. “But only wear it if you want to. A ring doesn’t change the way I feel about you.”
The brick house was three stories high. It was long and spacious with seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. Castiel had never understood the need for such an enormous house when there had only been four of them, and then three, and then two, and then his mother had lived alone in the house that was too big for most families. The flashy chandelier greeted Castiel like a neon reminder that he’d grown up extremely privileged. Castiel would have traded all of that for his parents’ attention and affection.
And then, a loud cry came from down the hallway. It was crystal clear. An anguished, tortured cry. Dean followed the sound, filming everything as he went.
Castiel pulled away to catch his breath and held Dean’s face in his hands. “I’m not ready to go back to our room yet. Should we get some dessert?”
. The sequel seemed to be her favorite as of lately. Probably because she hadn’t seen that one as much as the first one. Dean warmed up the pie and grabbed a fork from the kitchen. Then he sat beside her, holding out the pie and fork for her. “Brought you some pie.”
Dean chuckled. “Oh, hey, speaking of horror, I got your books a couple days ago. I’m gonna start them this weekend.”
Dean’s gaze rose above Castiel’s head, and his eyes widened as Castiel’s wings kept moving. “This is fucking nuts.”
“When were you going to tell me about this, Lisa?” Dean couldn’t believe that she’d planned for Benjamin to meet Ben on his birthday in a month, but this was the first Dean was hearing about it. If it hadn’t been for Castiel, Dean would have still been completely clueless.
“I hate to break up this fascinating conversation,” Meg said, “but I’d like to know when the game is set to start.”
Kevin laughed. “Well, I have a lot to do before our first table read, so if you’ll please excuse me.”
“Of course there’s a cake!” Aaron led them both to a booth table in the corner. There were a few people he’d seen around at the office sitting at the table. They greeted each other.
Castiel zipped up his pants, relaxed his shoulders, and walked up to Dean. “You look way too good in the morning.”
Castiel held his gaze, blue eyes intense. “I will not change my lunch time. You should change yours.”
It had taken some convincing because Castiel wasn’t in the mood to celebrate any holiday so close after Amelia’s death. Although apparently he’d never been into the holiday at all. Dean didn’t like the history behind the holiday either, but he sure loved food. Also, Dean completely understood Castiel’s hesitancy to celebrate not even a month after Amelia’s passing, but he wasn’t going to leave Castiel home alone while he spent the day with the rest of his family. In the end, Dean’s incessant pestering got Castiel to give in and join them.
Dean had passed out by the time Sam arrived. Castiel had also called Bobby and he’d showed up soon after. But Amelia had gotten there before either of them. Castiel had called her after he’d gotten off the phone with Sam because Amelia was just as much Dean’s friend as Castiel was.
Castiel wasn’t sure how he would break the news to his mother, but he eventually had to tell her that he was no longer human.
Dean rubbed his hands over his face. Yeah, he knew that neither of them was enjoying the fallout of their fight. Dean had been trying to keep himself as busy as possible to avoid thinking about both Castiel and Lisa. But this had to end. Dean had to talk to Castiel. Dean had to apologize.
“Dude, I just want to get out of here for a while. I’ve been in Lawrence my entire life. I’ve lived eighteen years without leaving the country. I think it’s time. It was either Canada or Mexico, and I flipped a coin for it.” Maybe he shouldn’t flip a coin for big decisions, but Dean was kind of indecisive.
With a final glance at his watch, Charles got back on his feet. “Very well. I will go. Next time you leave me a hundred voicemails asking for my presence, don’t be disappointed when I don’t show up.”
Suddenly, there were sticky—always sticky—hands on his face, smacking him on the nose and on the chin. Castiel opened his eyes to Claire’s open mouth falling over his cheekbone, drooling on him as she “gaaaahhh’d.”
Dean held Castiel’s gaze, measuring how sure he was about what he was saying. Whatever he saw must have won over his indecision because he said, “Alright. Let’s just go.”
It took a lot of work to get Sam up from the basement, but once they managed it, they set him down on the pull-out bed that creaked like there was no tomorrow.
“He has many names. Call him whatever you want. The devil. Lucifer. Satan. He’s the same cocky guy. Hopefully you never meet him.”
“Not when you think that person’s lying to you,” Sam said, holding Dean’s shoulder with one hand while he tried to read the messages in the extended hand. “They’re from Cas. Of course they are.” Sam let out a gasp, and Dean licked Sam’s arm, but Sam didn’t let him go. “Sorry I couldn’t come home with you tonight. I was looking forward to it. I was going to top what we did last night. Raincheck? I’ll try to steal some time alone with you tomorrow in your trailer. By the way, Charlie’s fine. I’ll fill you in later.”
“Bring Ben back home,” Dean said. “Please. Move back into this house. It’s yours. It’s always been yours. I just need to see my son back, Lisa.”
“So, I saw you talking to my friend over there,” Dean said, looking over his shoulder. The old man looked in the same direction, and he nodded. “He’s a bit shy, but I know the way to his heart.”
Castiel didn’t want to say anything because it wasn’t his place, but he couldn’t stop the words from coming out. “Maybe Dean has already moved on.”
“We talked it out,” Castiel said, smiling. “I’m sure you already figured that out because we went on a date and you caught us making out on the front porch.”
Castiel hadn’t even thought about the need for a eulogy. Before this conversation, he hadn’t thought about how he would even start planning the funeral. Castiel could barely function anymore. If it wasn’t for Dean and everyone else, Amelia wouldn’t have a proper funeral. He tried not to let that sink in too hard.
Castiel traced his fingertips over Dean’s palm. “I’m reading your palm. I want to see what’s in store for you this new year.”
only had three chords, so it wasn’t that difficult to learn. However, Dean still had trouble switching from one chord to the next without it sounding too choppy. Charlie promised him that with time, he’d get better at it. Dean hoped that was true because this hobby had turned out to be more painful that he’d imagined. By the end of his second lesson, he had full blisters on his fingers and he’d pretty much lost all feeling on the tips.
After a comfortable moment of silence, Castiel said, “How close are you and Anna to being done over there? It’s boring here.”
And then suddenly, all of Castiel’s fingers were gone. Dean waited as Castiel covered his cock with lube and then settled back on top of him. Castiel pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s forehead. “Are you okay, baby?” Castiel asked.
Castiel took the lead and grabbed two stools from the counter, planting himself down beside the noisy group.
It wasn’t purely accidental when Castiel pressed said morning wood against Dean’s thigh and hissed in response. But Dean didn’t seem to mind, gripping Castiel’s hip tighter and kissing Castiel deeper. Castiel bucked his hips against Dean’s thigh again, and the friction made his cock harder and harder. Castiel moaned, but Dean swallowed the sound. Needing something to hold onto, Castiel grabbed Dean’s waist as he arched his back and rubbed his erection against Dean’s thigh again, and again, and again. There were too many layers between them. In the back of Castiel’s mind, he faintly remembered their promise of taking things slow. But Castiel couldn’t remember why on earth they had agreed on such a stupid thing when they could be doing this instead.
Dean inhaled a sharp breath, but he didn’t say anything. His green eyes, on the other hand, spoke volumes. Dean needed to get out of there. Castiel would get him to safety soon. He placed a hand on Dean’s face, gently, hoping the touch was reassuring enough to calm his nerves for the moment. Then he moved to untie his hands. Once free, Dean untied Leyna and Sara while Castiel removed the duct tape from their mouths. The girls gasped, and tried to speak, but Castiel pushed everyone inside the house as quickly as possible.
“I didn’t get this to guilt you into getting me anything,” Castiel said, reading Dean’s face. He lifted Dean’s chin with a gentle hand. “I just got it because when I saw it, I thought of you.”
“I’ve picked up an interesting new hobby ghost hunting in an abandoned building and you would not believe the stuff I’ve caught on camera.”
Dean blew Castiel a kiss and winked. But Castiel only squinted further. Dean threw his head back in laughter. The mere thought of Castiel ever being replaced in Dean’s life was nonsensical. There was no competition.
Dean found Lisa and Ben by the door. Ben was bent over, tying his shoes on his own. He managed to do it without an issue this time.
Dean ran his hand through his horse’s black mane. “Cas, look, isn’t this mare gorgeous? Can we take her home?”
A slow grin spread on Castiel’s lips, and Dean was reminded all over again why he fell in love with him so easily. “Even with my wings?”
It was close to Christmas, and Dean’s diner was packed. The Roadhouse did well year-round, but the holidays brought in twice as many customers. Dean didn’t like to brag, but he knew his homemade pumpkin pies were a big hit. He’d learned the recipe from his mom, who’d learned the recipe from her mom, and the deliciousness was too much to resist.
“Hey,” Dean said, standing far from Lisa at the kitchen counter, wanting to keep a distance to not upset her. “How’s it going?”
Dean was expecting Castiel to look uncomfortable with that comment. Disgusted, even. But Castiel had a funny look on his face. And then he said, “That’d be nice.”
“I am,” Castiel said, another smile on his face. Dean thought he would never get tired of his smiles. “I finished the entire pie you brought me yesterday. I have no regrets.”
“Why?” Dean asked quickly. He immediately rejected the idea of Ben sleeping away from Dean on his first night back. “You don’t have to sleep at your mom’s, Lisa. I gave you the house. I want Ben to stay here with me.”
“Coffee Coffee Coffee?” Yeah, that was the name of the coffee shop. Castiel had been in there maybe twice since he and Amelia had moved here.
“Cas,” Dean said from the bed. He looked a little pale as he leaned against the headboard. He looked slimmer too, like he hadn’t had a full meal in days. But his face lit up when he saw them, and his smile was contagious.
“No, shit, I forgot,” Dean said, gaping at Anna. “I usually carry my toolbox in the trunk, but I took it out to fit my bags.”
Suddenly, Charlie and Rosa were standing in front of Castiel, looking way too serious for their usual cool, calm, and collected demeanor.
Dean didn’t think so, but he’d have to check with Castiel before giving Sam a good answer. “You have something in mind?”
Castiel pressed a kiss to Dean’s shoulder. “I can’t go back to sleep if you leave our bed. Stay one more minute.”
“Closet, come on,” Dean said, sounding offended. “If you dig in my dresser, you’re gonna find stuff you’ll never be able to unsee.”
So Castiel sat down. On the floor. He sat there, staring at a wall while Dean knelt beside him. He could hear Dean speaking to him, offering him water, asking about his well-being, but Castiel couldn’t say anything in return. He hadn’t finished processing anything Dr. Williams had said.
Castiel sighed. “Dean, come on. Don’t be so close-minded. Look, our therapist just died. If I hadn’t walked out of that building with you following after me, we would have both died in there. Sins or no sins.”
“Of course,” Castiel said, lifting the suitcase off the bed. He was forced to carry it since this suitcase didn’t come with little wheels.
“It’s good to be back.” Dean took a bite of the cake. “Damn, this is good. You gotta give me the recipe.”
Before Amelia had the chance to reply in the affirmative, Castiel shut down the conversation. He stood up, walking over to Dean and guiding him back to the door. “I think it’s time for you to go home, Dean. You’ve bullied me enough for the day.”
“What are you doing?” Dean asked, still holding the phone to his ear. “Sorry, Cas, but your sister is messing up my work.”
Dean blushed, but then he laughed too. It was all a silly misunderstanding. “Apparently, you said you liked my face too.”
Jess laughed. “Is that why he took so long to ask me out? I was about to do it because I figured he was too shy to make the first move.”
Dean had scooted closer and when he spoke, it was quiet enough that only Castiel could hear. “Since you’ve been having trouble sleeping lately, I thought having Claire close would help. I hope you like it.”
Maria’s wasn’t busy since they’d arrived in the gap between lunch and dinner. Since Christmas was only two weeks away, the diner was a winter wonderland. They sat at the same table by the window they’d sat before, since it was apparently Dean’s favorite, and ordered burgers, fries, and vanilla and chocolate milkshakes. Dean looked significantly better since they’d walked out of Jody’s office. He’d smiled then, and he was smiling now. Wide and bright. His clear green eyes were lit up with playfulness. Castiel was dying to kiss him.
“Hi, baby girl. What’s the matter? You got a dirty diaper? You hungry? Or do you just want to be picked up? Aw, sweet girl, look at those tears. It’s alright, sweetheart. Don’t cry. I’m right here.”
“I’m ready.” Castiel took a deep breath and shifted on the couch. “This is going to sound so stupid, but do you remember when you were dating Aaron Bass?”
Lisa’s gaze didn’t falter. She straightened her back and lifted her chin. “I realize you don’t like me, but that doesn’t change the fact that we’ll be in each other’s lives from now on, Castiel. There’s no need for animosity.”
“You’ve been sleeping for hours,” Castiel said, laughing. “We’ve got to be out of here by noon, remember?”
In a way, Castiel ached for Dean. It was heartbreaking seeing him this low, and being unable to do anything to help him. Castiel wished he could make it all go away. But he couldn’t. All Castiel had to offer Dean was his friendship.
Dean looked at Castiel. “The other day I realized that I don’t really know you, man. When we were in the elevator, I saw another side of you. I just figured we could try to start over. Don’t you think it’d be better if we stop antagonizing each other at work all the time?”
Castiel looked more serious. “Alright. Well, whatever it is, I’m ready to hear it. Judgement-free, of course.”
“You know, when Sammy said you were out of his league, I didn’t believe him,” Dean said. “Boy was I wrong.”
“Exactly,” Castiel said, throwing a leg over both of Dean’s. “If it’s my party, I get to decide whether I want it or not.”
“I hate to break up your little love fest—which is gross, by the way—and remind you both that we no longer have a car.”
Castiel lowered his sword with one hand and used the other to touch Dean’s cheek. The feeling, again, was unlike anything else he’d ever felt in his life. “Dean, I never wanted you to take on this role. I’m relieved that it was me. I want to do this. I’m going to end this. You don’t have to worry about me.”
Castiel softened his gaze on Dean. “That’s really flattering, Dean, but I’ve made up my mind. I want to venture into different genres. I want to push romance to the back of my stories. I want to write a book that’s actually popular. The romance genre is hardly ever recognized on a grander scale. Anything outside of Nicholas Sparks never makes it big.”
“No, no, I couldn’t.” Dean paused. “I haven’t answered his calls in months. Two months, to be exact.”
bisexual. Growing up I wanted nothing more than a kickass character who was also bi. So that’s what I wrote. I hope that answers your question.”
“Hey, Tessa, it’s nice to see you again,” Dean said. Dean would bring Ben to eat here on the many nights Lisa didn’t show up for dinner. This place had become a bit of an escape. Although, it had always felt second to Castiel’s house.
On the other hand, Dean was enraged at Castiel’s bastard of a father. During his lifetime, the man did his best to make Castiel feel awful as often as he could. Castiel reached out to him plenty of times, only to be constantly rejected. Dean had only stood back and watched as Castiel tried to reconnect with his father time and time again, up until the day he died. Dean had often wondered if Castiel had changed because he never fixed his relationship with his father, but he’d never imagined
Cas groaned, licking his lips as his dark blue eyes stared at Dean in frustration. “Teasing me is counterproductive. You’re supposed to be seducing me.”
“Are you ready, Dean?” Castiel asked, finally looking at him. There was a softness to his eyes that Dean hadn’t seen before. Somehow, Castiel seemed to know exactly what Dean was feeling, and why he still hadn’t gotten out of the car.
“It was great, man. If you want to change anything, I’d say use double the nutmeg, and less of the cinnamon. What milk did you use to replace condensed milk?”
“Holy shit,” Dean said, looking around the den like he’d just walked into another Western-themed museum.
Dean shrugged. “We can’t do that. But I feel like ever since I saw you at the Roadhouse yesterday, no time has passed between us.”
Castiel hadn’t had any time to think about what he was going to say, but he knew exactly what he wanted to say. He’d made up his mind instantly.
From the passenger seat, Jess was smirking. “Okay. So this man spends the night at your place but he’s not your boyfriend. Does he sleep on the couch?”
The Roadhouse didn’t have any competition. Not during Christmas, anyway. Not when Dean had so many faithful customers showing up for his pumpkin pie. They were going faster than ever. The day so far had been running smoothly. No one had complained about any of the food. No one had been rude to Jo or Ash or Kevin. Dean was, all in all, content.
Castiel paused in front of the bed, head titled to the side, staring at Dean. “You’re reading in bed? You…you wear reading glasses?”
Castiel frowned, taking a sip of his beer. “To be honest with you, Dean...I feel incredible.” He looked up at him, grinning. “You have no idea the weight that’s been lifted off my shoulders after my divorce. Sure, the legal part of it crushed my spirits, but now that that’s over, and everything has been finalized, I feel free.”
“Yeah, the shark got me,” Castiel said, shaking his legs, trying to free himself before he sank under the water. “You might want to let go of me in case I go down, Ben.”
Dean leaned over him again, placing a tender kiss to Castiel’s shoulder. “You’re so tight, Cas. It might take some time to get you ready.”
Then Castiel started to move. They started slow, but picked up the pace when Dean asked Castiel to go faster. Despite how close they were now, Dean still felt they could be closer, so he kissed Castiel. They weren’t really kissing though. They were mostly just clashing their mouths together, gasping for air in between.
Dean was taken aback. This guy was asking for his number already? Whatever happened to romance? Dean tried to laugh it off. “Just like that, huh?”
Dean crawled over Castiel to get off the bed. Once he was on his feet, he helped Castiel get up. Dean winked at him simply because he couldn’t help himself. They were deep in it now. Dean knew it. Castiel knew it. But Dean wouldn’t talk about it unless it was absolutely necessary. And it was too early in the morning for that.
Amelia hummed, pondering. “About ten years or so. Since way before I met Castiel. I’ve always loved classic cars. I saw your Impala when you guys moved in. 1967?”
In the morning, Dean woke up with the same arm wrapped around his middle. Something was different thought. Dean was on his side, and his back was pressed warmly against Castiel’s stomach. That was definitely new.
“Somewhere in California with Benjamin Fucking West. Lisa wouldn’t tell me where exactly. She doesn’t want me to contact either of them again. I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye to my son.” Dean hated the way his voice cracked at the end. “She took him from me.”
“We’re not putting a TV in our bathroom. You said you wouldn’t take long in the shower. I’ll be waiting for you.” Castiel pulled out his phone. “I’m dialing.”
“That was unbelievable,” Charlie said. “Dean, I’ve never heard you sing before. Your voice doesn’t suck, my friend.”
Despite the A/C in the room, Dean felt immediately heated. He had not been prepared for this sight. He’d always known that Castiel lifted weights in the garage. Dean had seen Castiel go in and come out a sweaty, stunning mess. But Dean had never seen him in action. In order to not ogle his best friend during his workout, Dean decided to make his escape, but Castiel had already spotted him.
When Dean got home, he found Sam lounging on his couch watching Carpool Karaoke videos on the TV. Selena Gomez was singing her heart out. Dean liked her. She was a nice girl. He should call her.
Dean rolled his eyes, sipping on his vanilla milkshake. “I don’t see why we need anything other than pie, but go for it. That means more pie for me.”
Breakfast consisted of Dean eating slowly as he watched Castiel fidget uncomfortably in his seat, poking at his hash browns. The pills took a while to kick in, but Dean could tell when they finally did, because it was when Castiel started eating. After that, it was mostly smooth sailing. They shared a few words about all they had to pack for their trip and all the stops they had to make before leaving to Houston: Chuck’s, the Roadhouse, Quick-Trip.
Then again, if Dean could have his way, Claire would be sleeping in the crib he’d built her in the nursery Amelia had painted for her. Not in Anchorage, Alaska, thousands of miles from home. But Dean had made his peace with this situation.
That was it. That was the moment Castiel realized their midnight kiss had turned into full-on making out. In public, nonetheless.
“Can you picture it, Dean? A life together with our children and our dogs in this quiet town until we’re old and gray in our rocking chairs.”
“See, you see,” Dean said. “Things are already getting weird between us. This is not what I wanted.”
Dean ate his lunch in the Impala, careful not to leave a mess. Wrecking the car was one thing, but crumbs were a real headache. Anna reminisced on their college years, bringing up all of their old friends. Dean realized he hadn’t stayed in touch with any of them, not even his old college roommate, Gabriel, who was a real jackass. The guy wasn’t that bad, honestly, but he had an odd sense of humor.
The guys all cheered for him as Dean left the room to answer the call. He went into his office for some privacy. Not that it really mattered anymore.
Dean grinned. “Wow, I can’t remember the last time my date paid for my dinner. I’m swooning right now.” Dean fanned himself with his menu, blowing out a puff of air.
Apparently the swimming lesson was still not over. Castiel continued teaching Ben, this time how to stay afloat on his back.
Castiel lightly tapped his ass as he pushed past him. There was no hostess to usher them to a table. The man at the bar glanced at them upon entering, and he told them to sit anywhere. Castiel headed over to the one empty table near the bathrooms. All the chairs at all the tables were occupied by people who were eating like it was their last meal, and others who looked too paranoid to enjoy what they were eating. There were a range of people, from finely dressed, to caked in mud and blood stains.
Castiel rolled his eyes, making his way to the festive parking lot. The air was filled with smoke, but the pleasant kind. Beef patties, hot dogs, and a few pork chops were being grilled in a few spots, and Castiel walked past them, nodding at the friendly-looking people. A few of them offered him a hot dog and a beer, and Castiel saw his opening. He leaned on a blue pickup while he ate his hot dog in a few mouthfuls, realizing how hungry he was. After eating nothing but junk food throughout the day, this was the most sophisticated meal he’d had in days.
Castiel worried his bottom lip. He let out a long, shaky breath before a smile won over his face. “I have no idea what I’m going to do about any of this. All I know is that it would be so nice if Dean felt the same way about me.” Castiel leaned his head back against the couch, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I’ll never be able to get this off my mind.”
“That’s right, we have a cop on our side. He’s actually my boyfriend. Look how cute he is in his uniform. Isn’t he cute?” Dean filmed Castiel up and down for everyone to see the fine specimen that he was.
Castiel wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist, pulling him down enough to kiss down Dean’s neck. “Let’s do that, too. After all, it sounds like you have a lot to teach me. I’ll be your willing student.”
Castiel sighed. “It wasn’t on purpose, at first. I think I removed it before I got some cleaning done around the house, but...then I never put it back on.” He shifted on the couch, feeling suddenly self-conscious. “I don’t know if I should feel guilty for not wearing it anymore.” He looked up at Jody. “It’s only been three months since Amelia passed away. Do you think I’m disrespecting her?”
“No,” Dean said, quickly grabbing Castiel’s wrist before he could get away. “I invited Cas, and he’s joining us for dinner.”
“Dean?” Castiel whispered, shaking Dean gently beside him. Claire was asleep between them, all limbs spread everywhere.
Dean knew he should feel a bit of guilt for the way he had completely dismissed his Impala for the Bel Air, but it was just for one day. No harm done. Baby would understand.
“No,” Dean said, pushing off from the wall. His green eyes peered intently into Castiel’s, and then flickered slightly to kiss lips. “Cas, how long have we been friends?”
“I think he was hoping you’d come over to watch the doctor show until I told him you and I were going to see a movie. He pretended he didn’t care, but then he locked himself in his office all night long. You understand why this can’t keep going on, right? This isn’t good for either of you.”
Dean got to work and waited for Castiel. And waited. And waited. By 8:30, Dean was growing worried. Castiel was never late. He was usually always early. Dean kept taking calls, but his mind was elsewhere. It was difficult to concentrate on anything else besides Castiel. His mind immediately went to Friday afternoon, and the shaky way Castiel had gone home. Dean should have made sure he made it home safely.
Castiel let out a loud groan before he threw away his trash as well. With another glare at Dean, he walked out of the break room.
Castiel kissed down Dean’s chest to his stomach, making sure that Dean knew how much Castiel loved every part of him, especially the ones he was nervous about.
He stepped closer to tug on the blanket and make sure Dean was well covered, and then he kissed his temple. Then he lied down beside him, ready to guard Dean’s dreams. Castiel would make sure that no one ever hurt Dean again.
“Where do you think you’re going?” Castiel’s voice was a low gravel that shook Dean to his core. “You’re not walking away from me after that.”
Not today though. Today after Castiel left, Sam dropped off a pizza and asked Dean if he would be okay if he didn’t stay to eat because he had some work related emergency. Seeing his chance, Dean told him he didn’t need a babysitter—because he didn’t—and sent Sam on his way. Glad to have the opportunity to escape for a much needed drink, Dean shed his smelly robe and put on some pants. Then, he was on his way to the Roadhouse.
Dean handed Castiel the book, opened to the page he’d been working on. He sat back and waited as Castiel examined Dean’s drawing. Dean knew his art was messy, and average, but he realized then how much he wanted someone’s approval on it. He’d been spending so much time on his drawings, convincing himself it was just a hobby; when in reality, these sketches mattered so much to him.
Castiel pressed his lips into a tight line and didn’t say anything for a few seconds. “He kissed you.”
“I convinced myself that I was only attracted to you because of your looks. It was my only consolation. I thought that I could have my crush as long as it stayed a superficial crush. But everything you did was endearing. You ate so much chocolate, but it always made you smile, and I lived for your smiles. You would read the most generic looking books on your breaks, and you would often gasp, like you couldn’t believe what you were reading. The worst part of all was at lunchtime, when you would watch that show. Your laughs, Dean, they killed me. Your laughter was the best sound I had ever heard.” Castiel licked his lips, holding Dean’s gaze.
“Ignore me,” Castiel said, shaking his head. “I shouldn’t be this petty. You know that I trust you completely.”
Dean went back to his desk, his mind on Castiel, again. Dean couldn’t remember a time when he wasn’t thinking about him anymore. Castiel had lost someone. Dean couldn’t imagine what he must be going through. He didn’t know if Castiel had any close friends. Dean knew nothing about his personal life. And maybe this was none of Dean’s business, but he couldn’t help but worry.
“I’m not letting you go to the movies alone. I’m coming with you. But promise me you won’t keep avoiding Castiel after tonight. Talk to him tomorrow. Come over for lunch.”
Dean could barely hear Castiel through the pounding in his head from how loud his heart was beating. “I feel the same way too.”
Dean mustered up courage before getting out of his seat. The short walk to Castiel felt eternal. Dean had sweaty hands by the time he got there, and he couldn’t immediately look Castiel in the eye. He sat down on the stool beside him and ordered a beer.
After getting two beers—he’d grown tired of the martinis—he waited by the pool. The L.A. weather was perfect. Not too cold, not too hot. It was just right. Livable. The soft wind was like a caress on his cheeks.
Castiel would be lying if he said he wasn’t cold himself. “Me too.” He kissed Dean’s forehead before he climbed off of him. “We should go back to our room. Take a hot bath.”
Bobby and Ellen walked past him, and Dean went inside. Lisa was making mashed potatoes. Ben was over at the Novaks, swimming in their pool, but they would be bringing him over when they came by later.
On Monday, when they went up to Dean’s room after school to study, Dean closed his bedroom door and pushed Castiel against it, kissing him senseless for a long time. After dinner, Dean had driven Castiel home, walked him to his door, and kissed him on the front porch.
Dean swallowed, lifting his chin to meet Castiel’s hot gaze. Their position had somehow made Castiel taller. “Am I?”
Dean laughed, and he followed Amelia back inside the house. She handed him a towel and they went into separate bathrooms to change.
Raising Claire without Amelia had never been part of Castiel’s plan. Her loss would also loom over his life. Amelia was everything to Castiel and she would have been an exceptional mother. But Castiel had to make his peace with the fact that Amelia wouldn’t come back. And although Claire wouldn’t get to experience Amelia’s profound love for her, she would still always be surrounded by love. This might not have been the life Castiel imagined, but it was a wonderful life that he loved.
“We should have told you,” Castiel said. “I know we don’t keep secrets from each other, but Dean and I thought we should keep our relationship just between us for now. Because of the show and everything.”
Dean glanced over at Castiel, who was already blushing. “Yeah, we were doing this back and forth pranking thing. I just had to top him. We’re taking a break, for now.”
They stopped with the shots but drank a glass of whiskey and two more beers each. Dean was drunk enough now that he was seriously starting to consider singing. He turned to Castiel, draped an arm around his shoulders, and pulled him in.
Claire hadn’t let go of Castiel’s finger, and Castiel was happy to stay like that with her for the rest of the night. But after a few minutes, Claire pouted, and she began crying again. Castiel looked helplessly at Dean. He didn’t have the slightest clue what to do about it.
Jo snorted. “Yeah, right. Every guy I date is secretly in love with someone else. It never works out in my favor.” She laughed. “Sorry. I probably shouldn’t cry to you about my sad love life.”
“Am I setting myself up for disappointment, Jody?” Castiel asked. “Why did I set my eyes on my best friend of all people?”
At the door, Dean put his jacket on while Castiel stood with his arms crossed, dreading the day ahead of him.
“You’re not here to be fixed, Dean,” Castiel said, patiently. “You’re not a broken machine in need of repair. You’re a person who needs help. And you’re not a lost cause. Don’t say that.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Hey, so tonight I’m going to dinner with Cas and his brother Gabe. I was thinking maybe tomorrow Cas could come to dinner here.”
Castiel grabbed a clean apron and tied it around him. “I’m actually here to replace both of you. Go get some rest. You need it.”
When their food arrived, Dean dug in and found that mushrooms tasted better than he thought. The chicken marsala turned out to be one of the best things he’d ever eaten. Castiel did it again. And that was exactly what he told him.
“Yeah, I gave them the news,” Dean said, running a hand through his hair. “They’ll be here tomorrow.”
Castiel looked peaceful in bed with the blanket wrapped around him. He snuggled into himself when Dean left, but he didn’t wake up.
“Are you sure you don’t want us to help you move upstairs? There are three bedrooms in the house. Only two have beds, but you can take your pick.”
Sam sighed. He put the camera down and sat down on the arm of the couch they were sitting on. “Last week I started a YouTube channel. It started as fitness videos. I wanted to start a video diary on my workout regiment, but then those turned into vlogs. I’ve recorded Mom in most of my videos, but you’re never around when I pull out my camera so I wanted to introduce you to my viewers now that you’re here.”
Dean placed a hand to his chest by his heart. “Really? God, you two are disgustingly sweet. For Ben’s first Halloween, I bought him a little monkey costume.” Dean frowned, suddenly, like he’d just remembered all over again that Ben was gone. But he pulled himself together and said, “Anyway, let me start cleaning up around here. Then I’ll get out of your hair.”
Grinning, Dean poured them both tequila shots, and they clinked their small glasses before downing them.
to kiss Castiel on the lips. Castiel turned Dean’s face towards him so he could look into his eyes again. “Well, according to Jo, we’re Claire’s gay dads. It makes sense for us to kiss.”
“Sam, this is Castiel—Cas. I like to call him Cas,” Dean said. “And apparently, Anna is still sound asleep in the car.”
“I agree. I don’t want to make this difficult for him. He should be enjoying having Ben back home. He shouldn’t be worrying about who he’ll have to live without.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, I know. You look great too.” He tried not to check him out because Castiel was right there.
“Oh, please, I wish I had a Daisy to cry over,” Charlie said. “No girlfriend as of now. Totally hating the single life. I mean, it was great at first, but now it’s like Ahhh, I have a huge house just for me. What the actual fuck.”
“Her heart has stopped,” the doctor said. “We’re doing all we can to get it beating again. You can come into the room if you’d like, but she won’t look like the person you know.”
“I know you’re only human. Even if you had some crazy night vision, you wouldn’t be able to see them.”
Castiel ran a hand through his hair just to have something to do with his hands, and then he gripped the counter. “Fuck.”
“Bye, weirdo.” Dean stood there, giving Castiel a funny look the more Castiel walked backwards. It was until Castiel nearly crashed against the trash can bin that he turned around and walked forwards again, shaking his head from embarrassment.
“Because I was,” Dean said, a shiver running through him from the cold. His clothes were still soaked, and the air conditioning wasn’t helping.
Castiel trailed his eyes over Dean, admiring how handsome his friend looked in a cream suit with a waistcoat. Dean’s faint stubble only made it better. The only protest Castiel had was Dean’s hair, which was combed back elegantly instead of just letting it breathe like usual. But he’d already complained about that back in the hotel, so there was nothing to do about it now.
“Good morning, sunshine,” Charlie said in a sing-song voice. Way too loud for—Dean checked the time on his phone—ten in the morning. “Did I wake you up?”
Dean sipped his beer. “Trust me, it ain’t easy driving back and forth, but it’s a good thing I love driving. I just couldn’t leave Lawrence, you know. It’s home.”
They looked at each other without speaking. Dean knew he should say something to break the silence, but he couldn’t. He’d just gotten mugged, and a part of him had wished to die just to end his long series of misfortunes. No, he didn’t want to die yet. He was just so, so tired of living.
And it was because this felt so perfect and so surreal that Dean decided he could trust Castiel with his past, too. “You remember that deadbeat dad I mentioned a while back?”
“You’re fighting the romance so hard, but by the end of the night, I’ll make you see how nice it can be to be courted, Winchester.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised to find Dean in his kitchen the following Friday, eating cheesecake with Amelia. It
“I am,” Castiel said, facing Dean again. He was wearing a perfect smirk on his lips, which was a better sight than the moon at the moment.
They went into Castiel’s room. It was colder in here than it was out in the waiting room. Dean took the chair beside Castiel’s bed while Anna stood there holding Castiel’s hand.
Dean widened his eyes, wondering if he’d heard right. “Is that it? Dude, that’s a big deal. I’m telling you I’m gay, and you ask me if that’s it?”
“We’re really sorry we couldn’t come earlier,” Rosa said. “I’ve been nagging Charlie about it ever since we heard we had new neighbors.”
Castiel smiled fondly, squeezing Dean’s shoulder before dropping his hand. “Here’s the deal. You go wait in the car while I go get some info on the game show. With all these people here, I’m guessing there’s some sort of auditioning process.”
“Does that change your perception of me?” Dean would be disappointed if Castiel was too put off by Dean being bisexual. That would be the end of their new friendship.
As soon as they found their room, Castiel rushed them inside and shut the door behind them, and then proceeded to slam Dean against said door. Castiel kissed Dean on the mouth, deeply and desperately. Castiel removed Dean’s leather jacket and let it fall on the floor, and then Dean’s shirt went next.
For a few minutes, nothing happened. Dean and Castiel looked out the window for any signs of gray wings flapping in the distance, but there was nothing. The blue sky looked as empty and ordinary as any other day. Part of Dean was relieved, though he knew no results were no better than good results.
When Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist and pulled him closer, Castiel opened his mouth to Dean, who gladly stuck his tongue inside his mouth and did filthy things to him. Castiel tangled his fingers through Dean’s hair, which elicited a soft moan from Dean that Castiel kissed away. Their chests pressed up against each other, and the contact was achingly sweet. Without thinking it twice, Castiel bit Dean’s lower lip, and he smiled at Dean’s soft moan.
While he waited for Castiel to wake up, Dean decided to create a new image of the Mothman. Castiel had briefly mentioned a graphic novel, which had been part of Dean’s idea not so long ago, though it was long forgotten. Dean started a new drawing, this time with purpose. He had a vague story in mind, about a group of teenagers, searching out the Mothman from his hiding place. This moth—more bat than moth—hid in the coal mines of West Virginia.
“But my brother doesn’t break that easily,” Anna said. “He started writing his novels again, and he became pretty popular in the book world. Well, in the romance genre. He hasn’t had another serious relationship ever since. He claims he doesn’t need a life companion, just someone to pass the time with.”
Castiel stole the coffee from Dean again, but he frowned when he realized the cup was empty. “That was definitely not enough caffeine for the two of us.”
Castiel turned Dean around, wrapping his arms around him again. “We don’t have to think about that tonight.”
“I know it’s weird, Charlie. I know. And I wish it wasn’t platonic. You have no idea how much I want him.”
“No, you haven’t. You’re sort of stuck in my life forever now.” Castiel smiled warmly, hoping Dean was able to see how much he meant it.
Gabriel looked surprised. “You are more than welcome to withdraw from the competition, but you can’t make the choice for another contestant, regardless of your relationship to them.”
Dean only caught half of the words Castiel uttered. He spoke at a lower volume, more timidly. Even if he had been able to hear, Dean knew it was none of his business.
Castiel was too tired to worry about the fact that he was standing in his pajamas in front of all of these unexpected guests. He waved lamely at everyone before he followed Dean into the kitchen.
Castiel chewed slowly. Then he looked down at his plate, taking a deep breath. “She looks exactly like Amelia, doesn’t she?”
“No.” Castiel shook his head, moving slowly over to his side of the bed. “I never knew you needed glasses. Do you wear contacts?”
Before biting into his sandwich, Castiel said, “Even if she wanted to eat our food, she doesn’t have enough teeth to chew it.”
“No,” Amelia said, in between sobs. “It breaks my heart knowing that Dean is so unhappy with Lisa when he deserves so much better. I want to think that Lisa is a good person who will come around, but I’m starting to lose hope that she will. And Dean deserves real happiness. He deserves someone who truly loves and cares for him like he cares for everyone else.”
Castiel laughed. His flirting game must be truly weak if Dean didn’t catch the innuendo. “I think you forgot to take your painkillers, Dean. They’re in the glove compartment.”
Castiel trailed behind Dean after he broke the front door to get inside. They walked directly to Burlington Coat Factory. Not the first place Castiel would have thought of, but he kept from asking questions. There was a bright look in Dean’s eyes that Castiel had missed seeing. He didn’t want to ruin the moment.
“No, dude. It’s Thanksgiving. It’s just an excuse to pig out.” Dean motioned to his own clothes. “I’m wearing jeans that are two sizes bigger and a black t-shirt so you can’t see any stains. Keep it casual.”
They got to the ice cream place, and ordered their ice cream in cones. Castiel got pistachio and Dean got double chocolate chip with sprinkles. They ate them in the car, listening to the old Ramones tape that Dean had listened to hundreds of times before.
“Here I am,” Dean said, fidgeting with his tie. Did he tie it correctly? “How’s my hair? Do I look awful? He’s gonna see how sweaty I am and he won’t wanna marry me anymore.”
Dean gaped, well aware Castiel couldn’t see the look he was sending him. “Oh, you messed with the wrong guy, my friend. Watch your back.”
Dean licked his lips, looking back at the circular pattern his feet were making in the water. “Do you miss him?”
to let himself in with the spare key on the porch. Dean was even debating just making Castiel an extra copy to carry in his keychain.
“You want my brother,” Dean said, breathless. Speaking directly to the angel made him sick to his stomach. The angel’s presence tensed every muscle in his body.
“You were right when you said we shouldn’t do this,” Castiel said. “I don’t want to ruin what we have.”
They made it to Bobby’s right on time. Sam and Jess pulled into the driveway a few seconds after they did, and they were all over Claire when they saw her in her red dress.
Dean knows all about these feelings better than anyone. He knows everything about grief. He knows everything about sorrow and emptiness.
‘’I'm writing my thoughts about you... I'm writing everything about you.’’ He whispered above his skin, making his heart flatter. ‘’Then why don't you let me read?’’ Cas whispered above Dean's lips.
‘’Here you are.’’ He said when he got close to them and offered the package to Lisa. ‘’Thank you so much, Castiel. It's my wedding gown, you know. We have a dress rehearsal tomorrow! And I can't wait. And Dean, please, you have to go and buy a costume, our wedding is two weeks away and you aren't ready yet.’’
It was another showery spring twilight. The youthful woman was glancing the stars out of the window of the narrow bedroom. They were countless and so enchanting... They captivated you. When she was a little girl, her father used to tell her that the stars in the sky were the souls of our loving people who were not alive anymore. That they were resting up there, looking down to us and safeguarding us.
?’’ He asked him in a whisper. He had lowered his head because he was crying, reluctantly though. He wasn't to blame for the tears running down his face. And of course, neither Dean is to blame for these hot tears embellishing his rosy cheeks.
‘’Thank you.’’Cas uttered without being certain why he's thanking Dean, it just felt like the right thing to do.
I opened the car door and I gave him my hand. He didn't say anything, he didn't say no or anything. He just used me to support himself before he grabbed his crutches and I helped him for one more time, but it was fine... He looked at me for sort moment and I felt my whole world turning upside down. It's really weird how much he can already affect me. And this was only the beginning, later I'm a part of him as he is a part of me. We affect each other with so many ways. Good and bad.
I didn't say anything else. He took the package of the driver's seat, making space for me to sit. He didn't say anything either. He was just caressing the small box raising my curiosity about what it contained. He pushed it towards me. I was trying to erase the memory of what happened a few minutes ago between us but it was too much to handle.
He averted his gaze to the old barn, only few times I happened to be there. It's located a few meters away from the house... all of a sudden, he formed his pink lips into a soft smile, almost like he reminisced a pleasant memory.
“You don't even know me...” His eyes display to full confusion. I froze again. I couldn't speak or thought something, I felt unable to breath. His emerald green eyes affect me so fucking much.
He continued his sentence smiling widely to Dean before wrapping his arms around him and bringing him into an unexpected hug, it was one if those you didn't want to end, which make you feel secure.
And yes, he lost everyone. Even and Cas. Even if Cas promised him he will stay. That he will be with him. He- he has to be. He fucking promised to Dean. He said he isn't going anywhere.
‘’We stayed here for some time you know... for some months, it was winter and I was six. You were still a baby. And then we came here again when you were around four. I don't remember much... only some vague memories. At least Dad was happy. So was mum.’’ She said and wipped her tears. They took a deep breath together, they were losing their father, forever.
Besides, he promised him he wouldn't go away. But the fear of losing Dean is still following Cas. Not just because he will move or get married... he is afraid of losing him permanently. He can't imagine his life if his lover leaves. Sometimes he prays he won't have to experience this but leave first to avoid the pain. But then he reconsiders because of the pain Dean will have to deal with.
And if you're brave enough to dive and swim a little longer, you'll find yourself on a calm and distant beach. But of course, there is the road, but the road from the forest is only for the courageous. For the few and not for the many. Acts of courage are followed only by those who dare, and they are few, and I will never be one of them.
I feel like the man that is sitting next to me doesn't know for a few minutes, that he's not a stranger. No, I don't feel that way, I feel like I've known him for a million years. I feel like I know things about him, that he's a part of my heart, I feel like he's feeling exactly the same feeling. This connection, these storms that I feel every time his eyes fall on mine. Every time I look at him, and I'll never get tired of talking about him.
This confined, yet bright and graphic library knows everything about me, every minor and crucial secret. All these books know who I really am. They know the poems I hide behind these thick books which aren't approached by anyone- except for me. They sometimes know me better than my own self. I miss the feeling that overwhelmed me every time I casted my eyes onto that paper heaven-this is how I call it- I miss the sense of warmth.
My feelings vanished, they've been buried, and they keep drowning and dying slowly as my eyes take a glimpse of an unfamiliar image. Where did my haven go? Why did it vanish? It used to be so lovely a room that I fell in love with it by first sight. The feeling I received when my hand unfolded every single dusted page of the old books or that night when I happened to fall asleep on the small armchair for I had stayed up late reading a random novel from the enormous, in my own eyes, library.
He closed his eyes for a moment and allowed the touch of the sunlight to urge him to their romantic place under a beautiful sunset. He just imagined that the sunlight was his angel. Cas. And that they danced together, shortly before darkness covers the Creation. He took pleasure in this touch before it was gone completely.
forever, but it's a way · a good way, to keep his memory alive. To remember him. But how can I forget the only person who made me feel really free? how can I forget him, his eyes, his lips, his hands and his heart. And I still lust like a mad man his lips. I still want him to be mine. I remember him, as I promised to him. I will remember him until my last day.
A beautiful and promising word. Unique and mysterious. It's a sorrowful fact that it is an unattainable dream. A dream unable to be accomplished. For people in love are cursed. We are cursed, my love... The cursed poets who still have hope.
“I'm sure Dean understood his mistake. He said that he isn't going to do this again. He learned his lesson by sending him in the war”
And he wants to assume that they are still one. Castiel still loves this special and unique human being. Castiel feels every single emotion he missed out on all these years. He finally feels. - Dean made him to feel, he teach him how to feel, they teach each other many lovely and soft things.
He smiled to me and extended his arm, pointing his cigarette to my place. “U-um no-no thank you. I don't smoke”, I declined his offer as politely as possible, our fleshes were almost touching when he pointed his cigarette to me.
Cas forgot about all their problems when Dean's soft lips left a kiss on his forehead. ‘’It's not a goodbye stupid, well see each other soon.’’
Hii, sorry for posting this really really late, i know its been months. Many shits are still happing on my life right now, anyway I hope u enjoy this :) <3
“Mommy! Mommy! Tell us a bedtime story!” the little girl bigged her mother loudly. The boy seemed way more excited as he was the one who told his elder sister to ask their mother to tell them a story.
For the first time in his life he has time available to talk about his traumas, his emotional heaviness. For Firth first rime in his life he's not running away from them. But he will confront them and even win this battle.
Maybe this is why they're falling constantly, for they are not brave enough to put into words how much they love each other.
He hated the fact, and I think he still does, that Dean found male friends, he wanted him to be lonely. A few months ago, when he found out from Sam about his friend Benny... He was outraged. He didn't want his son to be happy... To be okay with himself.
, when his lips formed into a timid, mere smile. The day he understood what really love feels like, when he felt all these
‘’So, that's your boyfriend?’’ Whispered Gabriella in his ear a moment before reaching the impaired man. Castiel nudged her, ‘’He's not my boyfriend.’’ He whispered through his teeth.
Like those phantoms which taught us to be afraid from an early age. All the phantoms return at night, just like he did. He came back with the moonlight and not the sunlight. All the phantoms have a tragic background, just like him. And I've been told to be afraid of the phantoms...
Whoever noticing these marks, their initial impression is that he and Amelia have active serial life, even though in reality it's exactly the opposite. She never put pressure on him to do something. Cas knows very well that Amelia desires to have a kid and he is eager to give her one, everything for her happiness and welfare. He cares about her and he wants to see her happy. He knows how much she loves kids and how much she wants one. Regarding his own happiness; He's here, beside him, who's kissing him in such a great manner that he goes insane. Cas is certain that Dean is smiling through his kisses and while moving his thighs against Cas' hips. He can feel Dean's boner touching him.
Dean started laughing to hide his embarrassment, Castiel glanced at him with the corner of his eyes, his heart was filled with delight when he saw him happy.
“It doesn't matter Dean. I know you or not. Oh, and it wasn't your mother's but my own initiative. Besides, I want to take care of you, it's my fucking choice. Liked or not.” I refuted his words while I am helping him walk.
For so many hours, he had been reminiscing everything concerning Cas, he recalls every single moment of theirs. Every memory of them.
He cut her off "Love is never a sickness." He wondered how he found the confidence to talk back to her, but he did.
. Stuff and several items related to the wedding here and there, calls to forgotten relatives to inform them for the wedding. Dean, on the contrary, is distant from this situation and an "outsider", he is counting on his fiancé and soon-to-be wife.
“How you know if I'm alright or not? How you know if I'm capable to lift a fucking little shit. I can do this you know. I'm not completely worthless piece of shi—”
He was lost. He felt lost, he was clueless why he felt like it, he didn't know what he felt, all his problems were surrounding him and he was trying to escape. But...
‘’You, my lady, don't have any authority to speak because you were a part of one of these things too.’’
''What are you writing about?'' He asked taking his hand and caressing it, he hadn't stopped with the intense kissing yet, a sigh escaped from his lips as he moved his hand more and more downwards. He closed his eyes as Castiel rested his head on Dean's chest, just enjoying him...
‘’Please don't cry... don't make it harder for me.’’ Dean's voice sounded even more broken after every word he uttered, the pain only seeing Cas cry.
I'm starting to process the offer he made to me a few moments ago. I was ready to continue but I stopped for another time. I attempted to encourage myself to keep going. I have never smoked in my entire life, even though I was given quite many opportunities to do so in the past. I don't know if this is right...to share the same cigarette.
I still remember the day I met Castiel Novak. My Cas. Even so for me, it was the first time I really felt alive and free. After all these years I still lust his lips. I reminisce his figure so clearly. His graceful black hair... And... Oh, my Lord.... His stunning and fascinating blue eyes locked in mine, as our souls. He was my angel...My lover, my savior from my own hell. My everything.
A few seconds later I noticed a boy with soaking wet blonde hair in an old military uniform coming out.
Like a little kid annoyed for being scolded for something he didn't do. Dean was like this, he didn't bother to reply to his mother's words.
-- Before he loses him for good, for forever. Before he disappears again. This time - he won't listen to the soft sound of his angelic voice. He won't see his ocean again. He won't see his lovely lips again. That he really wanted to feel in his lips. But he is long gone. He is- on a empty word.
’’ Dean stopped abruptly once again, but this time he didn't connect their lips. He didn't went on touching him. He wasn't able to gain the courage to continue. He just stared at him, his eyes glowing.
When this phrase entered my ears, my face changed a thousand shades within seconds. He just smiled again. I moved backwards as fast as I could trying not to look upset.
he had to calm him down, all he wanted was his sake as he kept on touching him, telling him what he wanted to hear. Helping him forget everything except for him.
Another day that no one missed to inform him how he has changed the last weeks, about his dark circles under his exhausted glaucous eyes, about his weight loss, that he has to try more, eat more and drink more water. He was tired and it's too early.
‘’Then too bad.’’ He whispered and averted his gaze, admiring the sea once again, but at least he was ensured that Dean loved him.
“Do you get lost too...?”I started saying “In your thoughts?” I asked him but he didn't answer immediately.
He was worried, really worried, I could feel his anxiety and his negative thoughts. He believed that his brother was dead. His real brother, he understood Dean's decision to stay away from his family a few months more before he would come back from the war, he needed time.
He smiled and Dean connected their lips, a slow and passionate kiss, like the first ones they had exchanged, his tongue was dominant in his mouth ‘’About how we have touched each other’’ he managed to utter through their passionate kissing state.
He never uttered those words, maybe because he lacks courage, maybe Dean would think that Cas is out of control. He is... he just let these words wander through the forests of his mind, he let them vanish beyond the horizon.
“I found it here when I first came... he had just built it...” I uttered, my eyes on the tree house, not many times have I been there. No one visits it anymore. Not even Sam. He has completely forgotten its existence. It lies there lonely, awaiting to be filled with warm voices and laughters.
Dean gazed upon him with a tender smile, while getting closer to him, his eyes still glowing in the dark, so extrextraordinary yet disastrous. Dean's eyes infused Cas with a feeling of safety.
But he had a slight hope that Dean would return, despite the fact that it was too late. Dean is capable of everything. He had promised to him that he would never leave him alone, but as it seemed, he breaks promises the same way he unwittingly breaks Cas' heart. This poor, broken heart, it has to handle a lot yet. How much pain can a heart handle before it stops beating? Tears escaped Cas' eyes and rolled down his cheeks as another memory came into his mind.
‘’Finally! Long time no see!’’ She exclaimed with excitement. A handful of tears of happiness were on her rosy cheeks. He was on the verge of forgetting what her voice sounded like. Really, it had been a long time since he last saw his beloved sister.
It is about helpless people in love and cursed poets who are still expecting to meet their signification other once again.
I admired the sky as I used to do when I was five years old, the same feeling. So many beautiful colors; light blue, soft pink and coral while deep inside you could distinguish an odd yet impressive color created by the mix of yellow and purple. My lips formed a smile as I took a glance of the last shade, when darkness came to substitute the natural palette of the sky.
Our lips were still one, I was able to feel our heartbeats getting faster and stronger, muting every other sound and spreading to the place.
“Do I have something weird on my face?” He said sternly but teasingly at the same time. I just rolled my eyes and averted my gaze.
“I finally found you!” Amelia exclaimed as she placed a kiss on my cheek. My wife. We have been married for almost a year. She is part of the family. I really care about her and I feel close to her. She means a lot to me. But... I cannot say that I'm in love with her.
. Seasonal fruit and vegetables are availableeverywhere. Currently, schedules are hectic due to Dean and Lisa's
"I'm see you won't believe me due to my terrible behaviour- I know I'm an asshole...A fucking dick. But- but, I'm being more than honest with your right now... I miss you. I truly and completely miss you." He was holding a flower he picked up while walking down the hill.
The ocean was one of the greatest things he had ever seen in his life-bigger and deeper than anything he had imagined. It changed its color and shape and expression according to time and place and weather. It aroused a deep sadness in his heart, and at the same time it brought his heart peace and comfort.
Castiel smiled as he brought his small glass of whiskey to his lips for another sip, the spicy drink slipping through his insides causing his body to shiver. That's when he felt a mild pain in his chest, as much as he didn't like it, drinking was a way to forget, to quench his pain. After he had met him, he started drinking more than he used to and smoking as well. He's crossing the same path of self-destruction due to his unwillingness to stay away from him.
" before raising his gaze into Dean's eyes. Dean left a tender kiss on his hand, which sparked weird feelings in Cas and caused his heartbeat to speed up.
‘’A last one,;; he said. Dean was staring ta Cas. He was striving to make his lips form into a smile but to no avail. He didn't know why he felt sad even if he was
“Keep on glancing at me like tomorrow will never come. Go on, don't hesitate. Keep going and so will I, keep on staring at me until the sun ceases and desists casting its light on the land...”
Maybe he didn't have the courage. “I'm sorry.” I said as I turned my gaze to him with sympathy. He nodded his head in a negative manner before grinning ironically.
I tried to refrain from thinking such things and kept gazing at him silent. I have said this countless times before and I will continue saying this. His eyes. His beautiful, emerald eyes. They make me travel forests, which I desire to explore, every corner and puddle.
void feeling, which he loathes with all his being. He feels like this on a daily basis, and Dean, this poor man is trying. He's trying his best to establish a sense of comfort in Castiel's heart, to calm him down. It seems that both are suffering.
And... plainly with the thought of someone seeing them. But as it seemed Dean didn't really bother. He lost himself in Cas, for one last time. They kissed one more time, and another one, they kissed open-mouthed, they concealed their passion, their fears, their insecurities, their everything into a soft kiss. The nostalgia was there, the desire to experience what they felt.
“Father wanted me to go to war... to 'discipline' me. I didn't go for him though. I did it mostly for my mother. I developed some friendships there but unfortunately most of them lost their lives. I wasn't eager to return immediately. I was dead. I rented and apartment and worked on a daily basis to make ends meet, despite my wound. It's gotten better now.” He paused and breathed in a gust of smoke once again. He had opened the car window slightly in order to throw the ashes out. He didn't ask me first, not that I would answer no to him. I wasn't able to do this, in spite of being cold. He turned his head towards me with a faint smile.
I wrapped my arm around his firm waist and supported him while he was trying to walk. We were both wet but he was slightly more than me.
, ''Just give me a second'' he wipped away his forgotten tears and shoved everything he could somewhere dark. While he was striving to tidy he came across a drawing belonging to Dean. It was him, watering some flowers. And that's how he got lost in his memories again.
“...Until the sun showers with its brightness only us. Until the very last second, keep going and so will I...” I continued unintentionally.
He looked at the flower. It was beautiful, but not so beautiful as Cas. Cas is the most and unique flower.
“Yes. But maybe not...Dean used to believe that the stars are the souls of the lost as well. The souls of cursed, helpless people...” The girl was staring at him without curiosity. His lips suddenly formed a mere nostalgic smile. He wasn't quite sure when was the last time he said that name out loud...How long it had been. How captivating his face was, the sound of his voice in his ears, his lips, his heartbeat, his hands on his body, he was about to forget his emerald eyes... Those eyes he loved unconditionally... He had started forgetting... and Dean was becoming what had always been for him.
In all likelihood he recalled something unpleasant, judging from his facial expression.“He is going to take advantage of the storm and use it as a justification to excuse himself and stay with his friends. Oh, Lord! What have I done to deserve all of this? If he starts seeing that guy again-” Marry interrupted his load thoughts.
“It feels like you do it because you pity me. The last thing I want is your forced kindness, Cas.” He seemed so cold, empty, helpless, alone.
He was soak from top to bottom. When he noticed the car, he let out a mere grim. Sam informed his friends that I would come and pick up Dean. I got out of the car so to give him a hand. He was carrying his staff and it was difficult for him to hold the scratches as well.
‘’It's okay.’’ He replied, coughing at the end of his sentence. His whole body was trembling. He was under the impression that he was playing with fire when, in reality, no one was. There was never a fire. Only the the flame between Dean and him, their passion. It may sound cliché but it's the truth. They're suns.
Maybe some of you think it's quite early for such thoughts, such words, such actions... But the sad truth is that life is too short for second thoughts, to doubt about the next step. Should you sense that the person standing in front of you is the one, go on. Don't be afraid, will you? Don't give up. Dare to be carried away by the chaos, dare to get lost in the mesmerizing eyes of the person.
“Mr. Winchester!” I raised the tone of my voice this time. He averted his seemingly exhausted gaze to me with an expression full of confusion. I haven't talked for at least an hour; I was lost in my thoughts. I was thinking... Thinking about the boy who was supposed to come over today.
He knew Dean would be beside him even if he was with her. He was aware that Dean loved him despite his lack of courage to say it but he would take it in soon.
Just look at each other until past midnight or until the first light of day, until the sun comes out behind the green and huge trees of the forest or until we see the first flower of spring born in spring rain... Until we hear the sound of the waves of the wild side of the sea as they strike with force and rage on the huge rocks, and then calm again.
Castiel. It's ok not feeling ok, but I'm begging you if you once again feel... you know, I want you to come and talk to me. You know you can trust me, don't you?’’ She took his hand in hers. He was still shivering, but Amelia's voice and touch calmed him down. He hasn't felt like that for long.
‘’It's okay, feel free to tell me. It's only the two of us, no one is gonna hear us.’’ Dean motivated him while Cas was aiding him to get into the car.
‘’I will reveal everything to John. And you already know that his reaction  will not be that pleasant. If you indeed love Dean, stay away from him.  You will let him go, get married, make a family. Heal.’’
The next minutes passed fast, various discussions. Some of them concerning their father's condition, others concerning their plans when winter arrives. Gabriella is planning on emigrating to America with her husband, since they can't land for a job here. He's a doctor, all the hospitals are full due to the was but the wage is not high enough to make ends meet, let alone feed a family. She's a mother of two children. An eight-year-old and a two-year-old. They may have a more prosperous future there.
‘’A couple of years ago, you know... I had just finished high school, I had my first serious relationship, if you can call it that.’’ He started speaking, she smiled at him as a motivation to go on, she adored him speaking. Castiel had a flaw or sort of gift of making extended speeches. It helped people get away, something he's trying to do to himself right now.
“You need to drink something. And don't say anything. It's for your own well-being. Your mother mustn't see you in such a mess. Plus, your father is upset with you” I advised him being genuinely worried about his well-being.
Through his rain of tears he placed his hands on his head in his panic-stricken and crying state, alone, dully, sorrow had devoured his soul, endless tears were running from his eyes while the warm water was falling on him, his whole body was trembling. He was trying to stop his tears but his attempts proved vain. He started biting his lower lip nervously.
He looked around anxiously, "I know you miss Dean and you're scared of what is bound to happen after his marriage..." She whispered because at this time in the house, even the walls have ears.
“It's been really long since anyone seemed to care about me. I forgot how it-it feels... being important to someone.” He confessed.
They were from the fortunate ones. They had more than two or three chances. But they were too fainthearted to admit their feelings.
Cas wasn't sure about Dean's feelings as he was for his own, he wasn't sure if his heartbeat was as fast as his own when they were together but he was sure that he felt something. He knew he meant a lot to Dean and he knew his personality, how hard it was to start a conversation with him.
I broke the kiss and my eyes dove into his and my forehead was touching his forehead gently. He was looking at me with an anxious gaze, for some seconds I thought that he would stand up and leave or that he would do something else but I couldn't be more wrong... He smiled as I gained the courage to place my palms on his cheeks and my lips on his. It lasted for a few seconds when he moved away and left a soft kiss on my lower lip.
“Do I look like I need help? And you don't need to do whatever crap people tell you to do. On the contrary you don't give a fuck.” He said, he was getting angry again.
At least, my sweet love of mine, we are going to be lost together in a glade. You and I, forever happy.
He is by himself, gazing at a meadow full of plain and beautiful flowers. He knew Cas would admire this place with his whole immortal heart which stopped beating unexpectedly. He knew Cas.
‘’Just say it... I need to hear it.’’ He looked at him one last time before he averted his eyes to the busy road, among the hordes of people he distinguished Lisa. She was walking towards their place with a wide smile on her face when she saw them and waved at them.
And Dean, he was left behind alone, under the hot sun which was warming his face. He was on the verge of collapsing, he had so many questions to ask him. So many hopes. But ultimately he just left him behind...
Lisa was about to decline Cas' offer but Dean stepped into the conversation. ‘’Deal, but first want to ask a friend a question.’’He said and without further ado he lifted himself from the bench and approached a sailor who was looking at them, that moment Lisa fixated her look on Cas.
many, his fears have started overwhelming him. He breathes slowly and steadily as the lukewarm water is tumbling down his body. He's feeling a bit relieved, shower is a way to calm down and relieve the pain in his joints. Taking a shower always rendered him calmer and had a positive impact on him. It helped him. But just as many others he drowned into his own thoughts, sometimes confused whether the water was coming from the shower or if it was his salty tears.
“Pretty please!” They once again shouted in unison and looked at their mother impatiently. She smiled and wiped away a tear.
Under a beautiful sunset, a hurt, a broken and a lost man in love is mourning for the death of his soulmate, the death of his world, he's kissing goodbye his other half and remains half.
“I'm not, believe me, I'm the most boring person of the town! Sorry if I disappointed you. I am not completely ordinary and-”
A chuckle escaped from his lips and added ‘’And when I saw them I was afraid to approach and you- grabbed one of them and threw it to my face.’’ Both of them burst into laughter in the end.
said without wasting time, immediately Mary stood up and went over her seat to hug her. Amelia started tearing up due to her overwhelming ecstasy.
Castiel followed his lead and took a seat beside him on another chair. He immediately grabbed a newspaper to occupy himself. There weren't any other patients with them in the waiting room. Probably a last one inside the office who kept the orthopaedic occupied. He was able to catch some scattered words from the conversation between the doctor and the patient coming faintly through the door, just as he caught Dean's eyes on him.
? You'll realise eventually that life isn't so easy and we don't always get what we want. Your brother knows better, if you seek advice, ask him.’’ Mary replied sounding slightly frustrated and pointed at Dean, who was looking at his plate, at the end of her sentence.
They started preparing the table. Amelia was also there, her ecstatic expression was hard not to be noticed. Dean was teasing Sam about Jessica and Marry was narrating stories about Dean when he was a kid. Cas was feeling free. He enjoyed the night for the time being.
at least I'll be by your side.’’ She gave him a broken smile. ‘’ But this is not what you really want, is it?’’ Her expression was sorrowful.
Dean was afraid that he didn't have much time left. That his end was upcoming and that he didn't have time to live. That he wouldn't get to do all those minor but enjoyable for him things. That he wouldn't achieve his individual goals. That he wouldn't feel free. That he would leave early.
I stopped him. “It scares you, right?” He nodded before we heard Mary calling his name from downstairs.
How much he wants him close to him. It might be early to say all these things and carry such emotions, but one in love doesn't think too much.
Our souls were already connected. In all likelihood we were soulmates in our former lives. In this life, in this cursed life we live there are is neither hope nor happy ending in the lives of the condemned.
It seems like he missed the town a lot. He missed his friends, his family, the places he used to spend his time, he wants to visit them again, relive the emotions, the memories. A slight smile formed in his lips, he probably recalled something.
, just give people a chance to speak and finish their sentence, will you?’’ He asked as he took ahold of his hand. He whispered a gentle "
I helped Dean take a sit, he just glanced at me. “Thanks” he uttered with a silent tone barely audible to me. I sat right across him on the other side of the table, now being face to face with him and waiting for a waiter to serve us. He had rested his upper body on the table, giving me the impression, he wanted to sleep. Out of the blue, he casted an eye over me. The weariness in his beautiful face was apparent.
‘’And I'm going to work at a nearby shop part-time. We also have the money my parents passed down to me... after their death. Castiel's sister will help us as much as she can too.’’
His lips formed a smile before he opened them. “Wow, easy, tiger.” I rolled my eyes before I wrapped his arm around my waist while holding his crutches with the other and so did I. I was able to sense the hotness of his body, which meant he might have had a fever.
He was making her worry, he was making her sad, he was making her ache for his mistakes and mishaps. He miserably failed to make her happy, he failed...he instantaneously thought before dragging his hurting body put of the bathtub. He was still in able to show love to someone who deserved it. He was gladly receiving the love she offering him and he was destroying it.
...’’ he said timidly. ‘’I can't imagine how my life would be without it, you know... even if I'm not a very good swimmer.’’ He added.
‘’He confessed to me that he stayed with me because his parents had thrown him out of home, for a completely different reason. They caught him doing drugs with a friend of his- just a friend- and he had the audacity to blab that… he had a second affair at the same time as ours. One he met that summer. Also, he told me that I was uninteresting to him, that he hated me f-for loving him... that he just stayed with me because he needed a house and money and that we had good chemistry in bed... When my dad learnt about the doings... he was disappointed in me. Not because I had an affair with him... I lost my home and he only caused arguments... After a few weeks later when I stayed with my father, he announced that he would search for a house for me and stuff... A few a years later, I found my home, here.
'“See you later Castiel...” He said with a friendly smile, before he closed the door of the library.
‘’A-and what do you want me to do?’’ He questioned with a low volume in his voice and she waited for a moment until she answered.
At that very moment she took notice of her brother leaning on the bedroom door. Without saying a thing, he approached the kids and took a seat beside them. They didn't say anything. She looked at him with tearful eyes.
“I know you don't need my forced kindness as you called it, but you know what? My life, my choice. I choose whether I want to be nice or not. It would be so much easier if I were a dick like you are.” I said, this time full of anger.
‘'Okay chill out, I won't do it again.’’ He said with a grin, at that moment the door of the doctor's office opened and an elderly man with hoary hair walked out, greeting both of them. "At least for the next thirty minutes." Dean stated as he entered the office.
“I need you to be honest with me...You can't hide.” I said while I was trying to be strict, but we both left a quiet and small laugh about my last comment.
‘’You ask the greatest questions you know’’ He said asked he left a kisses on his lips. ‘’For you, of course. Don't forget you're my muse’’
, they're pure and steeped in magic and love. They offer you a thousand optimistic feelings and delight and in the end, the protagonists always reach their destination.
He was my soulmate... My other half, my heart and my soul. My whole body, he was me. He was the world to me; he was my shelter... And... I used to believe we were two silly boys who fell in love, but the truth is; we were always one.
He's going to talk, so he feels ready. Besides, there's certainly a reason why he chose not to come back right away when he left, and he chose to spend a few months away from his family alone. He lost a lot. He lost not only a very good friend in the war, but also a part of himself. I know what it's like, not from personal experience though.
He answered him in the same way, he wasn't able to hear his voice and see the pain he felt, the pain lying underneath Cas' broken smile, but he understood it for sure. It was a given he shared this feeling, this pain.
‘’Dean please stop-’’ Cas whined annoyed, but Dean didn't have that in mind. They once again started heading to the car.
Afterwards, they walked towards the harbour, they had parked their car near the train station, close to the spot he first met Dean. Amelia told him that she wanted to trow a visit to her childhood friend to communicate the happy news to her. She also told him that she would take a taxi if she stayed longer.
Dean was about to reply but Cas was quick enough to speak first. ‘’I know I haven't lost you, at least not yet. But it feels like I'm losing you and it's too early yet and I don't want this... I'm afraid to go on without you, I'm going to be all alone. I'm sure you've heard the phrase 'I can't imagine how-how life will be without you, my life.’’ His voice started to shutter into a thousand pieces, just like his heart.
‘’I missed you too though. Besides, you know my love for you is greater than my love for the see.’’ He whispered, not looking at him.
‘’When Dean was your age,’’ Mary stared and pointed at Dean, ‘’he didn't have the greatest companies. I'll never forgive you for what you did to those poor plants.’’
would like it to remain between the both of us though, alright?’’Cas nodded with a broken smile and whipped away his tears.
event of Earth. With Dean by his side he would be able to overcome all his fears. He could Fall for him even for a trillion times. Except for his greatest fear, which he will never be able to overcome. And that is living the rest of his life
He, as person hopelessly in love, smiled in the memory, a night when they were discussing about everything under the sun for hours until dusk, until the first ray of the sun was casted upom their naked bodies, together, the night he found that drawing.
“I can feel you, you know...it's better to be there...find yourself being lost in your own thoughts rather than the real world...” I smiled when I understood that he agrees with me and didn't get annoyed that I had been ignoring him for so long.
I need this... I need to hear you say it, you know - It will save me, render me stronger, so many weeks without you... so many moments, so many moments that I didn't get to hear the sound of your sweet voice. It's been so long, do you hear me? It's been so long since the last time I kissed your lips, the last time I saw you, I didn't wake up by your side, I was alone and... I am intimidated, do you hear me? I'm intimidated by the thought of losing you. I'm afraid that something will happen and you will leave. But I don't want you to leave, my light, I want you to stay with me for the rest of eternity. I want you to stare at me until the last star stops glowing. I want you to drown into my eyes until the last drop of the sea is lost, I want to stand powerful by your side, hold your hand.
He desperately needed to confirm that Dean felt the same way. He moved his gaze slowly on him. Tears had creeped their way into Dean's eyes as well. They were keeping company to Cas' tears.
He has always been and always will be. Always. He will go on being alive, even if life hurts like a bullet in the heart. Even if life hurts like hell. For him. He will keep him alive in his heart. Cas is still alive because Dean is also alive.
He just smiled slightly. “So, you prefer Castiel?” His voice soothing at the beginning of his sentence but switched to childish in the last word in an attempt to imitate mine, but he fell through.
He didn't search for the sun since it was already beside him. He didn't even try, for he knew. He knew his sun was him. The boy with the thousands of colours.
“Oh, my Lord! Yes! Of course, and yes, I'd like everything you have from drinks right now... and... and a pie with a lot of—.” he began to say eagerly as he looked at the list.
“Castiel... I understand you might care about me... But— I guess my mother told you to do so, to "protect" me... But why?” I couldn't answer. I started to panic and feel more anxious. I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.
He broke down. He broke, he broke, he-- He fell on the ground crying his soul out and sobbing, expecting his love to return to him.
He started his sentence with a wide serious tone in his clients but towards the end he released a laugh. ‘’It's not funny, you know.’’ Cas replied somehow annoyed and got up. Dean had to pack his stuff up and get ready.
She's worried about her son. I thought and averted my gaze to the empty street and then to the yard. It was so clean. Steeped in dense vegetation, flowers and trees.
He was mentally exhausted of his perseverance to learn what was going on. But, no, he wouldn't be able to live his life without him filling it up. And he knows this is bound to happen soon.
Castiel gave him a benevolent smile. ‘’When we're given the chance. As frequently as possible.’’ He said, taking a bite of one of his baked potatoes.
Don't tell me you thought otherwise?’’ He answered him softly and released the smoke from his lungs. He placed the cigarette between his lips again. He resembled a work of art. If only he knew how to use a paintbrush properly to imprint on a canvas every chaotic detail of him. To leave a map of kisses on him to make him his.
Cas is Dean's everything. So and Dean is Cas's everything, maybe Dean doesn't know about this...But it's the truth.
And this is making him sad every now and then, his heart is breaking again and again, because he's taken it seriously. And he misses him and he's only thinking about him and no one else. There is nothing else apart from him. Dean Winchester.
A tear was slipping down his cheek, Cas ended up crying once again that day. How much pain can this person bear until he completely breaks down. He didn't even try to hide it, conceal his pain behind a smile or just change the topic.
“Yeah... Maybe... ” He said nervously. I kissed him again, oh, my Lord, I will never be bored kissing his lips.
‘’Here… I'm waiting for the ship to arrive... I need to speak to the captain.’’ He answered and shoved his hands in his pockets.
Silence dominated the room once again. It was approximately nine o'clock and Dean should have been here at least two hours ago.
I felt at home, where I felt secure and free, where I felt like myself again, where I could read for hours and hours the dusted and forgotten books which hadn't been touched for a long time.
For the first time- and surely not for the last. He had no idea how to deal with this new fact. And he keeps spending his days lonely, three weeks, two days and sixteen hours. He estimated the period of time he was away from him.
"I-I miss you, you know..." he started speaking again, his voice calmer. It was a way to feel better. To feel closer to his lost lover. "I'm really miss you-like- fuck... I'm sorry", he can't control himself.
At the end of the path, at the end of the world, that's where you'll find me, under a sunset like this one, under a beautiful sunset, beside shore. And grab a cheap bottle of whiskey and let us be lost together.
The terror of how to introduce myself, how to behave next to the new person I was on the verge of meeting... It's not that I'm unwilling to meet him. Everything begins from the fact that I'm afraid to meet him...
‘’Don't pretend you don't get it, you're making it worse.’’ She was fuming with frustration but her eyes were void.
The only thing he's doing tonight is remember. Remember the memories of their lovely time. That night when no one was in the small, white home, a wedding had taken place earlier as far as he recalls. But whatever it might have been, it was a chance for them to get closer. Become one. Him and Dean decided to leave earlier. Dean's fiancé couldn't keep her hands and eyes away from him. Cas knew that would be the last night before Dean got married.
Castiel had been dragged away by one of the event coordinators, so Dean took the spot that had been reserved for him at the front row. All of the chairs were full, so there were a lot of people standing. Castiel always seemed to pull quite a crowd. He had so many fans, it was kind of surreal. Dean didn’t think he’d ever get used to it.
“Yeah,” Dean said, looking up at him. The bags under his eyes were so big, they looked like they’d been painted on by a bad makeup artist. “Angels are badass.”
Castiel pulled away, taking in Dean’s full lips gone red, and his incredibly messy hair. He dropped his hands and retreated a few steps, licking his own lips before looking at his feet, embarrassed.
Sam laughed. “Don’t be so dramatic. I’m sure it won’t be so bad. Listen, I hate to rush off the phone, but I have to stop at the store to pick up wine. Jess’s parents are having dinner with us tonight, and I’m already an hour late.”
When Castiel walked into the living room, everyone was all over Claire because Dean had dressed her up in a cute white dress with a big black bow in the back and shiny black shoes. She also had a little red bow on the few blonde hairs on her head. Dean had always been great at finding her the cutest outfits. Then again, Dean was great at most things.
Castiel scanned the room once more, and he saw something he hadn’t seen before. Worried glances came from some of the people still eating at the tables. There was something odd in their looks, like pity. It was much different from the glances the crowd at the bar was giving them, which was a whole lot more threatening. Even Randy had gone quiet, but at least he wasn’t looking at them anymore.
With that, Charles strode out of the waiting room, taking with him the thick, uncomfortable tension that had formed in the room.
This long-distance thing was way harder than Castiel could have ever imagined. For almost two years, Castiel always had Dean a few feet away from him. Right next door, or in his house. But now Dean was almost four thousand miles away from Castiel and that felt so strange and wrong. Very wrong. Dean shouldn’t be so far away.
Castiel looked down at his outfit, which were cargo shorts and a green Polo. Nothing out of the usual. “I do?”
There were many things Castiel wished he could change, but there was only so much supernatural power to go around.
Dean and Castiel were offered Danny and Sandy costumes, but they both refused the wigs and went instead with the leather jacket and dress. Castiel looked beautiful in the dress.
Castiel frowned, anger at Lisa rearing its ugy head again. “Dean, that isn’t true. You’re Ben’s father.”
“He called to say he’d be working late,” Mary said, but then her attention was completely on Dean. “What’s the big smile about?”
Once in the truck, Castiel drove them to the middle of nowhere, a few miles outside of the city where the stars were a lot more visible. He’d brought a blanket, which he’d draped on the bed of his truck so they could lay down and do some stargazing.
Castiel laughed into the crook of Dean’s neck, a soft sound that made Dean smile. “I can’t believe we did that.”
“Hmm, I remember.” Castiel grinned. “But circumstances were different. We weren’t married then. Besides, you complained about your back for days on end.”
Dean glanced at Jody. “Sure I do. I still want all of that. But things changed along the way. I’d just like to figure out what changed them.”
Dean stared at the key for a long time before he finally picked it up and put it in his own pocket. Then Dean met Castiel’s gaze. “If you ever get tired of me, you have to let me know so I can go back to my own place and stop bothering you, alright?”
Castiel replaced his hand with his ring, and Claire giggled again. “You laugh because you always get what you want, you lovely, spoiled girl.”
“It’s good seeing you, too.” Dean led Castiel to the garage, where he pulled out the chairs from behind all of Bobby’s other junk. “They’re not so heavy. You can grab one, and I’ll grab the other.”
“It wasn’t,” Dean assured him. “It wasn’t a ghost either. It had to be something evil. Did you hear that laugh? That shit was fucked up.”
Castiel grinned at the visible dark purple mark on Dean’s neck. Castiel had done a pretty good job on it. Maybe it was juvenile to leave a hickey on someone, but Castiel had been sucked into the moment at the time, and he hadn’t cared at all. In morning light, he wondered if Dean would feel uncomfortable at showing the love mark to their guests. But Castiel figured since Dean hadn’t brought it up, he was alright with it. So it probably wouldn’t be an issue.
Dean stared at Castiel, and it occurred to him that he could have Castiel’s tongue in his mouth depending on his answer. Again, he tried playing it cool. “Are you kidding? A kiss without tongue isn’t a kiss.”
“Holy fuck, yes,” Castiel said with another moan. He picked up the pace, pushing and pulling faster and harder, keeping his mouth pressed against Dean’s. They weren’t exactly kissing, but Castiel didn’t want to move away from Dean’s mouth in order to feel his shallow breaths and gasps directly.
Dean rolled his eyes and smiled. Jack started calling him boss in a snarky way, but it kind of stuck after a while. He had a lot of affection for the kid, and he treated him more like a good friend than an assistant.
“Please, Dean, talk to me. Just tell me what’s bothering you. Tell me how to fix it. Tell me what I can do to make things better for you. Tell me--”
“You must be Dean,” Gabriel said, extending a hand for Dean to shake. Dean shook it. “My baby bro has ditched me multiple times these past few weeks for the sake of hanging out with you. He texted me today that he was free, so I swing by, and who do I find? None other than Dean Winchester, baby bro thief.”
Castiel settled comfortably on his seat, eating the icing from the cake as Dean drove them home. When he felt Dean’s cold hand reaching for him in the darkness of the car, Castiel took it and kissed it.
“It’s about everything,” Dean said, shaking his head. “This road trip is making us forget that life isn’t like this. We can’t just take off and go to another state with strangers and make out because that’s not real life.”
The Impala’s trunk was loaded up with Dean’s suitcases. The summer skies were bright, and the air cool. The beautiful sound of the car’s engine rumbled fiercely. Classic rock music blasted from the speakers. Dean had a full tank of gas and many places to go. Nothing could ruin this day.
“No need to thank me. You’ve earned it.” There was that menacing grin again. “At least that’s what corporate believes.”
Castiel took a deep breath, preparing himself to see his in-laws. He was afraid to be around them. He didn’t know how to face them knowing he’d see their grief in their faces, the same grief he was feeling at the moment. Castiel wished he could have been beside Amelia until her last breath.
“You’ve been keeping me at arms’ length since we met at the Roadhouse. And I’ve been trying to win back your affection ever since.”
Dean sat in his car, staring down at his phone for what felt like a small eternity. Suddenly, he was regretting agreeing to the drinks with Sam, and inviting Charlie. He should have stayed home where it was safe, holed up in his apartment.
Castiel turned his hand and laced their fingers. “I’ve seen this movie countless times without you, but I don’t remember it being this good.”
“Any reason you’re avoiding me?” Jo asked, turning him around. Her blonde hair was tied up in a ponytail, and she shot him a warm smile. “I saw you the moment you pulled up in that ugly green truck. You can’t hide. How are you, stranger?”
There it was. Castiel had also asked Naomi to leave out her strict religious views out of any conversation involving Dean, mostly out of fear that she would say something homophobic. This was somehow just as bad. The harsh judgment was still there.
“I’m an adult, Cas,” Charlie said. “You don’t have to worry about me. I want to go because someone I love lives in Austin, and I need to find her. Isn’t that what you’re doing?”
Dean winced because, yeah, of course Castiel wanted to talk about this right now. “I’m not not freaking out.”
This morning, as Dean made the long walk to his corner, mumbling weak hellos and good mornings, he saw Castiel’s black hair peeking out of the cubicle wall. Before Dean even sat down, Castiel was already looking up and smiling. It was the same every day. A big, bright smile. At first, Dean had been completely confused. The guy appeared to be nice, so why did everyone hate him?
After finishing his novel, Castiel had spent all of his time with Claire and Dean. During the small window he had without work, Castiel refused to waste any of it. So, he’d planned a lot of outings with his little family. All three of them had been to four museums, including the cowboy one Dean had become so fond of. And, of course, Dean had bought Castiel his very own cowboy hat at the gift shop. They had also gone to an aquarium. Claire had loved the seahorses the most. They’d also been going on a lot more walks around the neighborhood.
“Thanks for coming, everyone,” Castiel said, sitting down on the arm of the couch beside Dean. “Merry Christmas.”
Dean glanced at Rhonda, his eyes going wide when he saw her—and Castiel pushed down the ping of jealousy he felt at that—before shaking her hand. “Nice to meet you, Rhonda. I’m Dean.”
This time, Castiel was able to finish reading the book and then Dean put Claire in her crib, kissing the top of her head. Then he did the same to Ben. Castiel watched as Dean tucked both of the kids in bed, wondering how he got so lucky to be with someone as wonderful as Dean, who was a fantastic father on top of all the other amazing qualities in him. Castiel would never fail to be amazed by Dean.
“Oh, shut up,” Anna said. “My mom might die any moment. The last thing Castiel and I need is any of your bullshit. If you’re really here to support me, then you need to behave like less of an asshole. I don’t need this crap right now.”
The sound of someone clearing their throat behind them pulled them apart, but Castiel still kept an arm around Dean’s waist. He turned to see Lisa holding two beers.
“Don’t remind me. That shit was traumatic. And I still don’t have a swing set for Ben. I was so excited to find one so cheap.”
“Dean, I don’t think Ben could ever forget you. I find it hard to believe that anyone who’s ever met you would be able to forget you. You leave an impression on people. A mark. Besides, fathers are the hardest to forget. I haven’t forgotten mine and I don’t exactly like him.”
Dean stood up again, staring at Anna. “The guy he was engaged to after college broke it off? He didn’t say that.”
After dinner, they moved over to the couch. Castiel sat between Dean and Dandy as Dean hit play on the movie. Castiel had long ago stopped caring what Dean made him watch. Spending time pressed up against Dean on the couch was all Castiel could ever focus on anymore. But Dean kept looking at him during the movie to gauge his reactions. Castiel liked that about Dean, that he always wanted to know Castiel’s reactions to everything.
Castiel released one of Dean’s hands as he dug out his cell phone from his pocket, and he leaned his forehead on Dean’s shoulder as he answered. “Hello?” Dean was surprised by how even his voice sounded all of a sudden.
“I love camping,” Ben said, biting into his third s’more. “It’s a lot more fun this time with Claire, Dandy, and Doug.” The dogs were both tired from the hike as well, lying on the grass with their tongues sticking out.
The motel’s swimming pool was lit up by a bright white lamp, but otherwise the area was surrounded by darkness. It was a small pool, and the gate was locked, but Dean knew how to pick a lock with ease. He got the gate door open and they stepped quietly inside. Dean and Castiel stared down at the water, each of them in basketball shorts, and each of them holding a towel.
Now, things would hopefully change. Sam was a short drive away. Dean could go with Ben to visit or Sam could come here anytime. Things would be a lot easier now for all of them. Another reason to love this new house.
“I have to believe you, don’t I? Today has been a really good day. I have no choice but to believe you.”
Castiel followed Dean’s breathing until he felt the knot in his throat vanish. He wanted to scream out his frustration, but he was still in his driveway and he didn’t want his in-laws to hear him. Or for Claire to be woken up by the sound.
“How long will you be staying with us?” Jess asked. “We have two guest rooms, one of which is just for you. I thought that if we designated a Dean Room, Dean would finally decide to visit. I see I was right.”
“Would you look at this?” Charlie said, standing up. “The happily married couple, showing their faces here just a few hours after getting married.”
Castiel opened the book and found Dean’s signature beneath Castiel’s name, but there was a sticky note on top of it. The note read:
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Don’t twist my words. I’m saying, let him live. Sometimes kids want to be a little wild.”
Around 7:00 pm, Dean took Ben next door. Lisa, as she often did, had simply sent him a text that she wouldn’t be coming home for dinner, so Dean was glad he didn’t have to run into her on his way out. Dean stood on the front porch, gripping Ben’s hand, dreading the moment the front door opened after he rang the doorbell.
The red devil pulled out a pitchfork from behind and headed in Dean’s direction. Dean had no choice but to run from it.
Castiel escaped to the kitchen, filling up a glass of water, wondering what could be the reason behind Lisa’s impromptu visit. Whatever it was, Amelia would fill him in later. For now, Lisa only wanted to talk to Amelia, so he would give them some privacy. Castiel brought her the water and then excused himself to his bedroom.
Dean didn’t realize how clammed up he’d been until he was behind the wheel of his Impala, driving on the road with the windows rolled down. This was a good distraction from all the worries in his mind lately. He was thankful that Castiel had been kind enough to notice how tense Dean had been and how much he truly needed to just get out of the house for a few minutes. After picking up the candy, Dean opened up one of the bags and ate a few pieces, just to test them out of course.
“That’s a fair concern to have. Now that you know the truth behind your feelings, we can work on exploring these issues.”
Dean nodded. “It was taken down. And I was blocked from that number. Whoever that man was, he was bad news.”
Dean trailed kisses down his neck, going soft, soft, soft before he bit down on the skin. Castiel let out a sharp breath and arched his back. Dean had been dying to do that after all of those marks Castiel left on him. It was only fair that Dean returned them. Dean sucked on the skin there, and Castiel bucked his hips. Dean started to roll his hips in time with Castiel, and the friction was driving Dean crazy. Castiel was breathless as Dean continued kissing his neck.
“Bobby helped a lot,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his neck the way he did when he was embarrassed. Dean never did well with compliments, even though he often deserved them.
It was Monday on finals week, and Dean had been restless in bed, so he decided to just get up and start his day. The kitchen clock read 6:43 a.m., so he made some coffee. Maybe it was the coffee smell—okay, it was definitely the coffee smell—that lured Mary and Sam into the kitchen a few minutes later. Sam yawned and rubbed his eyes, heading directly for a mug to fill up with coffee.
Dean was worried about leaving his car behind, so Castiel called a tow truck to drive the car home before it was spotted by any passing cops. Once Dean calmed down—and, quite honestly,
Castiel and Ben were still talking near the store’s entrance when Dean found them. Judging by the look on Castiel’s face, Dean could guess that nothing he’d heard was good news. Before Dean could ask for any details, there was an explosion in the parking lot.
“Keep reading,” Castiel said, calmly. “We have about half an hour until Chicago. Where exactly does your brother live?”
Dean laughed awkwardly, nursing his beer. “Trust me, that wouldn’t be good for any of us. Ellen would murder me if I ever went out with her daughter.”
“I want you to come with me in the summer,” Dean said, and he was proud when his voice didn’t waver. “I’ll come back for the fall semester at KU. That’s where you’re going, too. It’d work out. If you want.”
Everyone gathered around Bobby’s long rectangular table to eat. Dinner was filled with chatter and laughter, the same way Dean remembered growing up. It was nice being around family again without the looming presence of loss or death. On top of that, the food was amazing. Bobby marinated the turkey himself, and it was tender and delicious. Sam’s scalloped potatoes rocked his world. And Ellen’s mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce sent Dean momentarily to heaven. Alright, so Dean was a bit dramatic when it came to food. Thanksgiving had always been Dean’s favorite holiday for that reason.
Dean wasn’t surprised to find that Jess had been so willing to babysit for them. After Sam found out about him and Castiel, Jess had called Dean so she could get as many details as possible. Dean didn’t gush about his relationships, but it had been amusing to see how excited she was for him. Sam had been the same way, except he’d asked a lot less questions.
Between the two of them, they got Anna up to her room on the third floor, and as soon as they opened the door for her, she rushed to the bathroom.
“Really? I think I’ll check it out. I’ve never been interested in medical dramas, but if you think it’s that good, I’ll give it a shot.”
Castiel gaped at him. “Excuse me, but this is very difficult for me. I don’t know how you’re taking this so easy.”
“Dean, you’re squishing me,” Castiel said, but he relaxed in Dean’s arms. Dean let him go eventually, but his plan had worked. Castiel was in a better mood. There was a smile on his face that reached his eyes. Much better.
Dean rolled down his windows, letting the air blow his still damp hair. It felt incredible. At a red light, Dean turned on the radio. He found his favorite oldies station, and
Dean couldn’t help but smile. Castiel was joking with him. Things were good between them. Maybe Dean shouldn’t be so forward with Castiel. He would probably scare him off. Although, there was something that told him Castiel was just as drawn to Dean as he was to him. He could still remember Castiel’s touch from the night before. Soft at times, but firm at others. On the dance floor, Castiel’s hands on Dean’s hips had been strong and firm. It had felt delicious.
Dean couldn’t believe the results as he started packing up. He didn’t have much to pack up since he only had his unfinished apple pie to take home, but he put the top on it, grabbed his messenger bag, and grumbled as he walked towards his Impala. Halfway there, he heard his name called from behind. Dean immediately recognized the gruff tone from his co-winner.
Castiel couldn’t imagine how difficult this must be on Dean. Judging by the way Dean slumped his shoulders as he looked at Ben still swinging, Castiel could see how much the situation upset him. But Castiel had never been in his place. He didn’t know how awful that must feel. Being a father wasn’t a privilege he had just yet.
Castiel looked sharp. He wore dark jeans, a blue Henley, and a gray blazer. The only thing Dean recognized about him was his messy hair. Other than that, Castiel looked like an actual model who had just finished an important photoshoot.
Without thinking, Dean grabbed the back of Castiel’s neck, pulling him in until their mouths were crushed together. He hadn’t been expecting for Castiel to wrap his arms tightly around Dean’s waist or for him to crush Dean against his chest as his tongue licked Dean’s lips, urging them to open. With a sigh, Dean allowed Castiel’s tongue into his mouth, and it became very familiar with Dean’s tongue. Dean ran his other hand down Castiel’s firm torso and then snuck it under Castiel’s shirt, feeling warm skin. God, why did this feel so right? Dean had imagined this moment so many times, but he’d never thought it would feel this good. Castiel was making these quiet, sinful noises, a mixture of whines and moans as he deepened the kiss.
He wanted to shout so she could hear him, but he was out of breath. He was underwater and he could not breathe.
Castiel gaped, like it was the last thing he’d been expecting. And Dean had a moment of panic because he wasn’t sure if they were the type of friends to eat lunch together. Maybe their day at the farmer’s market was a one-time thing. But then Castiel closed his laptop and pushed his papers aside. “That smells delicious. I’m starving. Thank you for this, Dean. You’ve made my day.”
“I hope you love talking to me enough to share some of your ice cream because I already finished mine.” Anna tried to steal some of Castiel’s ice cream with her spoon, but he held it out of her reach.
“Sorry we only have two guest rooms,” Sam said, rubbing the back of his neck. “But both beds are big, so I’m sure Anna or Dean won’t mind sharing.”
So Castiel got himself ready, this time only having to lube himself up with no further protection. He settled back on top of Dean, and entered him slowly, carefully, watching Dean’s face to make sure he wasn’t hurting him. Dean wrapped his legs around Castiel’s hips, urging him all the way in. Once Castiel was balls deep inside, Castiel kissed Dean’s temple.
“Hey, Cas, what do you want for Christmas?” Dean asked right after the chaotic Black Friday shopping scene at the beginning of the movie. Christmas was still twenty days away, but he had bought zero presents.
Castiel already had his phone out. “Of course.” He went to the nursery and snapped a couple of pictures, texting them to both of their cell phones. When he returned to the couch, Amelia was crying again. “What’s wrong, Ames?” He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her close.
Castiel looked surprised. “Well, I hope you like them. If you don’t, I won’t be disappointed. You can tell me the truth.”
Claire was asleep in her car seat, which was a good thing because if she’d been awake, she wouldn’t have been able to leave Castiel’s side. Castiel’s book tour would be over in two weeks, but Claire hadn’t been away from Castiel for that long before. Dean was worried about how she’d handle it. Dean was also worried about how
Jo was beaming. “Seriously? That would be great.” She laughed. “Did you not know that your boyfriend is a famous author? People go crazy over him because they think he’s so handsome. There are Buzzfeed articles about him.”
“Water is fine, thanks,” Castiel said, shifting on his feet. He still looked nervous. Dean didn’t know how to make it up to him. He wanted to put him at ease somehow.
Dean offered to drive, so he waited for her in the driver’s seat of his Impala. Amelia stepped out of her house, waving at Dean from her front porch before she walked to his car and climbed into the passenger seat.
“I’m glad we did this without the condom.” Dean kissed Castiel’s temple. “I wanted to feel you like this. I wanted to get as close to you as possible. I—” Dean let out a long moan when Castiel thrust at a different angle.
happened, Anna,” Dean said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We’ve just been spending too much time together.”
“It took a long, long time,” Castiel said. “But Charlie and I weren’t gonna take no for an answer. Not when it came to you, Dean. We wanted you back, so we got you back.”
Castiel smiled at him, and Dean was momentarily stunned by the sight. He had it bad. “You said you wanted romance?”
“I didn’t mean to scare you,” Castiel said softly into Dean’s ear. His hands were strong as they manhandled Dean into a similar position that Castiel had taken during his turn. Castiel shifted Dean’s hips, and then threw a leg in between Dean’s from behind so that Dean spread his legs further. In the meantime, Dean was having a difficult time remembering where they were and what they were doing. Castiel was now circling his arms around Dean’s arms, angling them just right, and when he was satisfied with the position, Castiel whispered, “Much better.”
Castiel chuckled, his breath hitting the back of Dean’s neck, sending shivers down his spine. His arm around Dean tightened. “I like having you this close. Just you, me, and India Jones.”
I’m gonna end it right here because you’re giving me a funny look, and I think you require my attention. Not to worry because I’m more than happy to provide it.
