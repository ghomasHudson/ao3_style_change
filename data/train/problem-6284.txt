Tony couldn’t help himself, and ended up pulling him for another round of breathtaking kissing, which turned out frantic and overly enthusiastic since in less than a few seconds. Their hands were everywhere —
He looked from one girl to another, seeming distraught. When he looked back at Mr. Steve, he was smiling that pretty smile of his, and Morgan was sure she noticed her daddy’s face become pink.
“Who is your leader?!” Howard roared, causing Tony to jump in place and raise his head in alarm, “Bring him here at this moment!”
When he arrived, Howard had been waiting for him, much for his surprise and horror. He remembers getting the beating of a lifetime and being locked in his room for an entire week as punishment, but none of that had been more painful that calling Steve over and over again, and still getting absolutely no answer. After that week, Tony spent another two locked inside his room, sobbing in silence for what was left of his broken heart, phone clutched in his hands with Steve’s number shining on the screen.
Howard, after finally being able to compose himself, narrowed his eyes at the man before him, “I have no idea what you are talking about, barbarian.”
His thoughts came to an abrupt halt when a wet tongue came in contact with his entrance, and Tony gasped out loud out of his stupor. He had been so lost midst his own pleasure that he completely missed Steve stripping him bare, and now watched with wide eyes and gasping breaths as Steve licked and kissed at his entrance while one of his hands worked on Tony’s erection. The warm press of a tongue against him had Tony gasping out loud a shuddering moan, which received a noise of approval from Steve as he pressed further and actually invaded Tony with his tongue. From that moment on, Tony was pretty sure there was another open latch on top of his room, because he was seeing stars.
But as Steve continued to look deep into his soul, Tony’s eyes captive of his own as he gazed upon him with both despair and determination, Tony found himself unable to do any of the aforementioned things.
Natasha smirked and hugged Carol closer, burying her face on her girlfriend’s hair and lovingly whispering, “Aye aye, captain.”
Tony, already feeling his anger melting away, narrowed his eyes at his boyfriend, “We cannot have kids. I have the feeling you’ll be too easy on them, Cap.”
“Duncan, stop!” Morgan cried as she tried to recover her plushie from the slightly taller boy’s hands, “Give me back Mr. Fuzzy!”
of the picture of perfection Howard used to go on and on about. Captain America was righteous, obedient and proper in every way, but Steve had already proven himself to be a handful, and a look where he didn’t seem as impeccable as he used to in his day-by-day was like the metaphorical nail on the coffin that Steve Rogers — super strength and famous moniker aside — was just a man. He was not a deity that was far from reach, and whom Tony would never be deserving of. He wasn’t perfect, and he made mistakes,
When the Sokovia Accords happened, they fought and argued, but when Zemo came into the picture trying to use Bucky as a trump card to tear them apart, Steve reached Tony about it, and they fought Zemo; accords or no accords,
happened to turn him into the being he currently is, which makes his attention on us greatly concerning… Not to mention he seemed interested on Tony before he left to the North.”
“No, Tony, wait,” Steve reached for his wrist, earning a furious glare from Tony who was already feeling his throat burn as tears threatened to spill. Years of making himself stronger suddenly felt like nothing as the protective walls around his heart started to tremble at the mere sight of the despair and overwhelming emotions swimming inside Steve’s blue eyes. The eyes who always made him so vulnerable, and
Tony nodded, and then started to look for another subject to address. He didn’t really have anything else to discuss with the man, but he still wanted to talk to him for a bit longer without any bitch ogling him or any innocent kid around. Call him an opportunist, but something told him that if he allowed Mr. Rogers to leave through that door without exchanging a few more words with the man and getting to know him better, he would regret it – and since Tony was already impulsive by nature, consequences be damned.
Tony smirked knowingly at her and gestured lazily towards the door. "It's not the first time I've hear that, so I'm sure my own lawyers will have a blast with yours. Have a wonderful day."
.” Tony breathlessly confessed, looking up from Steve’s chest to meet his thunderstruck expression, “I’m losing my sanity, I’ve lost Pepper… I
Steve chuckled but didn’t really respond, too busy continuing his plundering inside Tony’s mouth. Tony who was already growing steadily overwhelmed by their heated exchange and couldn’t help but to moan quite loudly when Steve’s hands landed on his ass and gave it a hard squeeze.
“You— He— How—” Tony fumbled with words, suddenly feeling wildly parched as his eyes went back to Steve, who was calmly walking in their direction, “Oh no.”
"L-liar!" Flash spoke up for the first time since Tony had arrived, "He's lying! I started nothing, he just attacked me!"
“Of course I do,” Steve whispered, capturing Tony’s kiss-swollen lips in another gentle yet searing kiss and then saying, “I’m not making any decision until I know the both of us agree to it,” he looked at Tony with so much determination that Tony felt himself gasp, “
With his throat burning, Tony did his best to try and blink away the tears pooling by the corners of his eyes, but it was proving itself to be a difficult task. To think their separation had caused so much pain to Steve when Tony spent all those years being angry and sure that Steve had never cared about him, sure that his name probably didn’t even cross Steve’s mind.
Her daddy stared at Mr. Steve in disbelief, then groaned loudly and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand.
“Come now, Stane. You are only behind that desk because I helped put you there, so this house is as much mine as it is yours, therefore, I may come and go anywhere as I damn please.” Tiberius arrogantly pointed out, earning an eye roll from the older man. “But you haven’t answered me. How is delightful Anthony fairing today?”
“I thought so too when daddy and him started going out, until the day I was inside my daddy’s office and I heard the truth...”
in his life, and that he literally described you as his ‘everything else’, which doesn’t seem to involve friendship
The little girl’s eyes watered as an overwhelming feeling of gratitude overcame her, and the only response Morgan could muster was to hug her new friend as tight as possible and whisper, “
"You see, I really like Peter. He is a very smart boy, and I have no doubt Mary is much the same, so I'd love to have both being nurtured by my school, and who knows, maybe even have a special spot in my future project of the Stark Industries Internship program once they start college." Tony had said that as if it was the most natural thing in the world, but it was clear the offer was more than a little overwhelming for Mr. Rogers, if his starstruck expression was any indication.
“You fucking disappeared, Steve. Didn’t answer a single call, not you, not even that buddy of yours. God, I tried calling your
Tony released a shuddering breath midst sobs, gathering courage to look up at the man who apparently held his life in his hands. He met the Viking’s expression, and couldn’t help the scared gasp that escaped his trembling lips. The king’s expression was nothing like before. His expression was furious, and there was an unseen storm raging inside those bright blue eyes that would probably make even the strongest of men soil themselves. It was one of the scariest sights Tony had ever witnessed, and even if somehow Tony felt that said anger was not directed at him, there was no doubt the king was a terrifying man, and Tony was about to be given to him—like a lamb being gifted to a hungry wolf.
The Vikings hounded closer, and Tony watched in panic as they surrounded them with raised weapons with malicious smirks.
Which reminds him… Tony narrowed his eyes. The leader carried no weapons? Strange. Tony had read about Viking leaders too, and how they always kept themselves as armed as possible, given their powerful position that ought to attract a lot of envious eyes. The man had nothing but some kind of circular shield strapped to his back, and if their position hadn’t given away who was the leader, then Tony would probably have guessed it was Mr. Grumpy and his pal blades, and not bearded Adonis over there. He frowned. Nothing was going like he expected. Maybe Jarvis was right? These people looked civilized enough, maybe they could be reasoned with—
Tony, too dazed by the prospect of Steve being in love with him to care about Carol’s threat of bodily harm, shifted uncomfortably on the chair while worrying at his bottom lip, “You really think so?”
“It’s my daddy’s boyfriend,” She started reluctantly, playing with the rim of her dress, “I really don’t like him, and I want him gone.”
? I didn’t know if you meant everything to me, and if I was capable of giving you what you needed. I questioned myself, I wondered, I tried to pretend, but when we fell apart... I only felt that kind of emptiness and visceral pain once in my life, Tony, and it was when I woke up seventy years later and realized I had lost everything.” Tony’s eyes widened, tears rolling unchecked down his cheeks as he stared at the man before him in awe and bewilderment. Steve smiled, shedding a lone tear of his own, “I only have this,
Tony was head over heels for her, since for the first time in five years, he was finally able to forget Steve. Which was why five years later when they figured out Darlene was pregnant, Tony was absolutely overwhelmed with joy. He was planning to propose to her, his father wasn’t being as terrible as he used to be, and things seemed to be going absolutely perfect in his life.
and impressed that you are this much of a nonsensical asshole to just waltz in back into my life and try to act like nothing happened!”
Their forces didn’t last two hours against the burly warriors wearing body armor and animal pelts, and their swords were no match for the heavy weapons the invaders swung with their terrifying strength. In less than a day, the Iron Kingdom had fallen to its knees before the barbarians, and now  gathered in the throne room and fearing for their lives, Tony, Howard, Jarvis and countless other royal servants along with what was left of their royal guard, awaited the final judgment by the hands of their conquerors. Obadiah and Tiberius had left the kingdom early that morning to go see to some important matters regarding weapon trading in the east, and as the chief of their royal guard, Rhodes had gone with them for protection. Having the chief accompanying them had been a demand from Tiberius for whatever reason, which had really peeved Tony given Rhodey was not only the castle’s main protector but also his best friend, but now he was glad the man had departed. At least he would be safe. At least he wouldn’t die too.
That had the king staring again, only this time, it was in disbelief. He then raised his head towards Jarvis, who Tony didn’t need to look to know was glaring at the king like a lioness about to pounce at the slightest sign her cub was in danger.
"Well, if it concerns you that much, I can request Mrs. Romanoff to designate Peter to do some extra time after class and tend to the school pets." The boy's face lit up like it Christmas morning, and Tony's smile widened in response, "They will be his to care as well in a year, so might as well start getting acquainted with the responsibility."
“Did you keep himself from doing it in order to protect Thor’s ego?” Tony ground harder this time, successfully ripping out a low growl from the soldier, “My oh my, what an admirable leader you are, sweetheart.”
Natasha nodded and disappeared behind the door, leaving Tony to glare back at Mrs. Thompson. "Again, I understand you are upset Mrs. Thompson, but I need to ask you to have some decency in the presence of the children. We still need to figure out what happened between them."
He heard Peter chuckle and the sound of him plopping down on one of the stools near the kitchen island, “Sometimes you sound like a housewife, pops. It’s the least Captain America thing ever. Ned just won't believe me.”
The waiting warriors howled in agreement, raising their weapons in pure glee as the huddle of terrified subjects and royals to scream in horror and fear. Tony felt his entire world turn upside-down. All his hopes and expectations slipping through his fingers as the reality of what was about to happen struck him like a mace. They were going to die. The Vikings wouldn’t spare them, King Steve
King Steven, seeming to have woken up from his trance, nodded, “You took, therefore, it shall be taken from you. It’s how the natural order of things work.”
Grunting and refusing to entertain any further thoughts, Tony lunged forward and captured Steve's lips in a searing kiss, what seemed to surprise the captain, if the gasp Tony greedily swallowed was any indication. The kiss was messy for a moment as Steve gathered his bearings, but once he did, Tony couldn't help but to moan against his lips as Steve fought back for dominance and won, parting the seams of Tony's lips with his tongue and plundering the insides of his mouth with gusto, successfully taking all of Tony's breath away.
Mr. Deity— I mean, Mr. Rogers frowned at that. "Mr. Stark, are you sure? He still broke one of your rules. Won't that set a bad example for the other kids?"
“You know, king Stark of the south, I have met many kings during my voyages,” Tony heard King Steven say, and the next thing he knew, the man was aiding him and Jarvis to their feet, “and of all the horrible men I faced, you are undeniably one of the most despising of them all.”
Steve quirked up a brow at his son as he hung upside-down from the ceiling from one of his web-strings. He would never get used to how furtive that boy could be, “The occasion is dinner. Now get down from the ceiling and go have a shower, your father must be arriving soon.”
Steve stared at him for a moment, uncertainty shining in his bright blue eyes before he released a resigned sigh and closed his eyes, “Alright.”
“No, I’m being serious, mainly since now you come to me saying the guy was in that pitiful state because of a lack of
Tony felt something ugly and possessive twist his insides, which was clearly stupid. He had just met the man.
“You’re welcome.” Natasha’s teasing tone dragged his mind out of the gutter as she and Wanda stood before him.
“Will you just stand the fuck down and listen instead of keep interrupting me?!” Obadiah ground out, his patience wearing thin, “He
- and looked away as he rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, well… I wasn’t much of a dame’s man before the serum, then afterwards came the war, and-”
King Steven seemed to grunt something unhappily in his mother tongue, ignoring whatever Howard was going on about and coaxing Jarvis and Tony to walk towards the exit. They did it without preamble, wanting to leave that place as soon as possible, and reached the main entrance where a big muscular and blond man awaited. Tony held back the need to recoil once the big guy glowered down at them with a single good blue eye—the one that wasn’t covered by an eye-patch. His beard was longer than the king’s, even allowing it to be braided like the rest of his bright blond hair. A thick hammer was strapped to his black armor’s leather belt, and the low rumble of a voice he possessed was enough to send terrified shivers down Tony’s spine, “
Tony cursed, knowing Bruce would have definitely questioned Steve on whatever he meant with calling Tony his ‘everything else’, but now he would never know since a certain titanic raisin had blew up the compound and everything inside it, so he grit his teeth and ran a nervous hand through his face.
"But I'm sure you are aware of this. After all, that's why my counselors and coordinators have monthly meetings with the parents to let them know how their kids are doing under our care and to update them of possible difficulties they may be facing. Some of these difficulties may become situations exactly like the one that happened today, which is why Mrs. Romanoff is so adamant that all parents should attend," he looked down at his Stark Pad again, feigning surprise, "ah, says here neither you or Mr. Thompson ever did. How curious," he shot her an unimpressed look through the lens of his glasses, "isn't it?"
A deep sigh brought his attention back to the two people who remained in his office, and Mr. Rogers was sending him an apologetic look that should not be so similar to a kicked puppy. "I'm truly sorry about this, Mr. Stark. I've always taught Peter to know better than to fall for this kind of trap."
Howard continued yelling and being ignored for God knows how long before something actually happened—that something being the throne room’s gigantic wooden door swinging open to allow passage to an entourage of new Vikings Tony had yet to see, and that had Howard shutting up almost immediately.
“Just barely. The rest of the footage was corrupted,” he explained, tugging again at Steve’s beard and causing him to release a soft huff.
Thankfully, Steve had decided to ignore his friend’s nonsensical teasing and looked at Tony with a smile, “
Tony released a watery, disbelieving chuckle, “You idiot,” he softly hit Steve’s chest, prompting Steve to pull him closer and hug him tight against his chest, causing Tony to sob at the crook of his neck, “you damn
“And you are saying you were not aware of your father’s actions?” The king pressed on, expression once more turning tempestuous. Tony swallowed nervously.
Tony released a shuddering breath, looking around towards their visitors and swallowing nervously as they regarded Howard with raised brows or blank stares, and then completely ignored him. Tony sighed in relief. The last thing they needed was for his stupidly arrogant father to make things even worse.
“I suppose…” Steve relented, his chuckles dying out gradually as he focused back on Tony. They held each other’s gazes in silence for a moment, until Steve opened his mouth again, “But it doesn’t change the fact that I was the one who blamed you in your vision, and seeing how I’ve been treating you since we’ve met, I guess is not hard to understand why.”
He had literally asked Pepper to gather all media outlets possible for this announcement. There were a
He didn’t need to ask a third time, since Steve’s pace quickened so damn brutally that Tony could do nothing but yell and continuously hit the mattress as countless shockwaves of pleasure wracked through his body whenever Steve hit home. They continued like this for god knows how long before Tony felt the telltale of his climax building up inside his stomach, causing him to contract around Steve and make him grunt louder and louder at each thrust, “I-I’m close,” Steve whispered against his ear, earning another strangled moan from Tony, “with me, sweetheart. Come on.”
"Holy shit," he gasped breathlessly against Steve's shoulder, "guess that answered if I wanted this or no, huh."
“I won't put them up because I feel like the kid is embarrassed enough as it is, but judging by what I see in here," Tony looked down at his Stark Pad and frowned slightly at the amount of terrible results, "he just barely reaches the passing grades, even though my teachers are trained to understand each one of their student's specific difficulties and aid them through it. Even the most challenged kids grow in the environment my darling mother has planned for them," Tony raised his eyes to meet the Thompson's again, "which means that the lack of positive results from your boy for the past year can only mean he doesn't care enough and you are wasting both your time and money keeping him here."
Tony felt the need to get up from the bed and go outside to run around and scream like a madman. Steve was so damn adorable, what the
“That was a test, right?” Peter had reluctantly asked, seeming unsure if he had made the right decision. Tony opened his mouth, ready to deny that and insist, when he remembered a certain pair of patient and wise blue eyes. He sighed.
“I suppose not, honey.” Tony leaned down and sealed Steve’s lips with a chaste kiss, talking against his mouth as their breaths mingled together and he felt Steve hardening beneath him, “There’s nothing about you that doesn’t sound worth it.”
And tell him, Steve did. About Arnim Zola. About his parents’ murder. About Bucky’s existence and how his brainwashed self was the one to do it, how Sam was currently chasing cold leads on his best friend turned murderer. He told Tony
He looked like the sexiest version of a lumberjack that could ever come to exist, and Tony is pretty sure that if Steve had looked like
The abandonment had crushed him in ways Tony couldn’t quite put into words, not only because Steve was his one and only friend, but also because he had been Tony’s first love. Love which Tony planned to confess the night they agreed to sneak out to go to a little festival down in Brooklyn, that Steve always told Tony so much about. He had been so excited about it, albeit a bit nervous. Tony never got out much before Steve, but sneaking out with his silly and sickly little friend turned out to be the greatest and most fun times in his life, so Tony always felt excited for them, and this time was even more special since they would go to the neighborhood where Steve had grown up in. Steve had invited him to celebrate, since that day - may fourteenth - would complete three years that they knew each other, and Tony thought it would be the perfect occasion to confess his feelings for the smaller boy, so he made a thousand plans and rehearsed a thousand speeches, and when the clock ticked closer to the hour they had agreed to meet, Tony sneaked out of his room once more and went to their rendezvous point, excitedly waiting Steve to arrive.
They stayed like that for awhile, with Tony enjoying the heat Steve’s body irradiated while feeling side inside his embrace. Steve was awfully silent, but Tony didn’t hear his breathing even out enough to signify he had fallen asleep. He wasn’t panting anymore, since they had some time to let their hearts calm down, but he still wasn’t asleep. In fact, Tony was pretty sure Steve’s muscles had grown tense, as the arms surrounding him tightened their hold, and he couldn’t help but to wonder what was going on inside the knucklehead’s mind that had him so tense after the blissful and intimate moment they shared.
“No!” Jarvis cried out, pushing past Howard and completely ignoring the king’s angry shout. In less than a second Tony’s bare body was once more engulfed by Jarvis’ warm embrace, Jarvis who was shaking and hugging him like his life depended on it. “Please, please don’t take our boy from us. He’s the only thing we have left of our beloved Queen. Please Your Highness,
Tony was really shocked now. This was the first time he saw such a side of Steve Rogers, and he wasn’t quite sure what to make of it yet, “Something’s eating at you right now, isn’t it?”
But his happiness didn’t last for long, of course. Apparently Howard thought it was time he intervened and did something about Tony’s “defiance”, as he called, and that’s how Tiberius Stone entered his life.
The screen froze once he hit pause, and Tony stared as his mind became a whirlwind of panicked thoughts. Steve couldn’t have meant
“Mr. Fuzzy is such a dumb name. I thought you had a genius for a daddy, so where is your smartness now?” He teased cruelly, keeping the caramel bear out of Morgan’s reach, “Stuuuuuuuupid.”
There was no turning back now. Tony gathered what was left of his strength and opened his eyes, finding Steve looking at him with so much adoration that his already weak knees almost buckled. He swallowed a sob that almost crawled out of his throat, and after inhaling deeply, forced himself to ask, “When you said… when you told Bruce I was your ‘everything else’, Steve,” he released Steve’s face to take hold of the flannel, seeking more to hold, to anchor himself, “Steve, what did you
Steve stared at him for a moment, jaw clenching just like his fists that rested on top of his worn out jeans and eyes filled with regret as he said, “I can’t.”
Tony stepped in, however, "In a jungle, perhaps, but this is a school and the students are meant to behave themselves and respect each other. If you don't see an issue with how your son acted, then it's clear he is not the only problem here."
Tony felt his blood run cold and his hopes to die once more. So there was no hope for them, after all? He got what they were saying—there was something similar he learned in his classes about Christianism. If you did harm to others, and if you were a bad person, your soul would go to hell once you died. Tony wasn’t sure if it was the same thing, but he was pretty certain it was at least similar, and he couldn’t help but to feel resignation wash over him. He closed his eyes and felt tears prickle at them. So this was truly the end, huh? At least he had tried.
when he got the call from Happy about what had happened to his plane and just who exactly had helped to keep the heist from happening. He honestly couldn’t care less about the items or if Happy had messed up ignoring the call from Peter’s friend, all he cared about was the fact the kid had once again disobeyed him and had almost gotten himself killed and-
“Don’t play dumb, you know well what I’m talking about, and that’s a fucking low blow,” Tony huffed, turning away to look back at the girls and trying to ignore how the man looked damn adorable even though he was far damn older, “and you should know better, because if you are going to come up with some bullshit excuse, don’t even bother. I don’t want to hear it.”
man, who always seemed to demand all of her daddy’s attention when he finally had some free time from his work, so she had to mostly spend time with her big brother and his friend Ned, and daddy just seemed just so
Bruce chuckled from behind him, "Are you really calling someone out for making a scene when that's exactly what you're doing?"
Laughter actually escaped Tony’s lips, but soon it was overwhelmed by another string of moans once Steve buried himself deeper, filling Tony in a way he had never been filled before. “Fuck.
“Your brother is down at the workshop, so I’ll have FRIDAY call him, but check on your sister. I left her working on an art project after I bathed her, but since she is as messy as your father, I’m pretty sure she's needing another one by now.”
Now, two months later and as the mission came to a wrap once Barnes and Wilson had managed to collect the needed intel and, as a bonus, they brought an end to a criminal faction which happened to be terrorizing the small city Steve, Nat and Wanda had chosen to act undercover. When Nat told him, Tony couldn’t help but laugh. Only their luck to send them to a place where they would finish two missions instead of one. It was almost too absurd, but also satisfying — after all, they had saved the double amount of lives Tony had expected them to, and all because he wanted Steve to grow a beard.
Natasha and Carol were at the living room — Natasha sitting on a corner of the couch while Carol laid stretched on it with her head resting on Natasha’s lap, who was gently carding through the captain’s short hair as they watched a movie.
Steve actually leaned forward and hid his face against Tony’s neck, “T’was amazing… Thank you so much…”
Morgan watched Mrs. Maximoff fumble with the device for a few seconds until her eyes widened almost comically, and she proceeded to look at Mary, then back at the calculator, then back at Mary again. “Oh my God.” She whispered, and after a moment of staring at the calculator, she rounded her table and reached for the phone also sitting on her desk, “Just a minute, sweethearts.”
,” he tugged at Steve’s beard again, “then I’d have had the courage to do something I’ve been wanting for a long time!”
“Good.” Steve nodded, turning to his pack as they looked at him with mixed looks of determination and expectation, “I know all of this is far too sudden, and I would be an even worse leader if I didn’t warn you this is a dangerous battle that we are going into without any planning whatsoever, so I won’t hold against any of you if you want to stay back.”
Once Peter was out of sight, Tony heavily sighed and ran a hand through his face, looking back at the Iron Spider suit lost in thought.
, Tony found the last proof of what he had come to understand earlier about why he had fallen for Steve in the first place.
“S-Steve. Baby, wait- Oh god. Oh god.” Tony released another moan, this one particularly loud when Steve actually gently inserted a digit inside, “A-ah! Okay, I was not ready for that one.”
Anyways, enjoy, and remember to let me know your thoughts about it! Unbetaed, so ignore mistakes ngnngn
, ever since they locked eyes earlier. Tony felt the urge to look away, but soldiered on, refusing to give in. Whoever these people were, it was clear they were headstrong, so Tony doubted displaying any sort of weakness would be the right move. He needed to toughen up. After all, weren’t Stark men made of iron?
“Oh, hey pumpkin. Are you two done playing?” Mr. Steve asked with a pretty smile, and the sorrow Morgan had been feeling suddenly lifted.
"Well, even if he did, he shouldn't have priority over mine!" She turned back to Tony, "For the absurd amount of money I give this school, the least you could do was give him another chance!"
at it. A natural, who had Tony moaning and writhing in pleasure in less than ten seconds. His big hands grabbed at everywhere he could, leaving purplish marks on Tony’s legs as his mouth and tongue worked overtime to drive Tony absolutely out of his damn mind. He grabbed a fistful of sheets and moaned out loud when Steve left his entrance to give attention to his cock, which happened to be throbbing and a sticky mess of pre-come due Steve’s hand smearing all of it down the length. He licked and nipped at Tony’s shaft, while continuing to rub gently at his entrance, and Tony was on the verge of losing his sanity as he continued to moan desperately and squirm under Steve’s hold. He’s never been more glad to have listened to his isolating tendencies since, thankfully, the barn he had accepted to spend the night in was far enough from the main house for anyone to actually listen to his moans.
to us, so I cannot risk it, not to mention I’m pretty sure Rogers’ interest was part of some plan Maria had in mind.”
"That's a lie! Mr. Stark is a very good and busy man, he wouldn't waste his time with you and your mean folks!"
Peter shot his father a hopeful look, and Mr. Rogers quirked up a brow at the offer. Tony knew it was more of a prize than a punishment, but he wasn't really that inclined to actually punish the boy, so this would do.
Steve hummed in approval, returning to his task and taking his sweet time with Tony’s already sensitive nipple. He squirmed slightly as another low moan escaped his lips, and concern started to pool by his stomach along with excitement. Steve hadn’t even
Mary stared at her with wide eyes as Morgan finished, and she couldn’t help but to feel somewhat ashamed. She shouldn’t have heard that conversation in the first place, and now she was bothering Mary with it...
After their initial contact earlier, things had suddenly grown awkward once the excitement of the reunion dissipated and Tony remembered how Steve had simply vanished during the worst moment of his life and where he needed Steve the most. Worst of all, Steve had lied to him, since he had promised Tony he would be there for him when he lost his mother, and that Tony could always count on him, seeing he understood Tony’s pain to a degree since Steve had lost his father less than a year before he met Tony.
Until his ‘peace’ came to and end when Steve and Natasha showed up in his property accompanied of Scott and a ludicrous plan that sounded absolutely impossible and straight out of a sci-fi movie, but that surprisingly enough, ended up working out in the end.
Tony quirked a brow at her icy tone, smirking playfully as he teased, "My oh my, Mrs. Romanoff. Not even a good afternoon? I'd hate to be the kid who has gotten on your bad side today."
"Very well," he finally found his own voice after dry swallowing his want, "I don't think there is anything else to investigate here. It's clear that Peter’s reaction was nothing but a response to the aggression against his friend, whom I'm sure I'll need to speak with the parents as well since he clearly got hurt." Tony turned his hardened look to the Thompson's, finding a seething Mrs. Thompson glaring right back while Flash did his best to look as small as possible. "And I don't know if it didn’t get clear to your boy or yourself, Mrs. Thompson, but it's very important to me that my students respect my academy's rules, seeing how they are what makes this school as prestigious and safe as it is. I will not have your son breaking a rule as important as 'do not intentionally harm or intimidate a buddy' a second time for whatever reason."
Tony smiled against the mattress, “Sounds like a wonderful excuse to skip work, actually. ‘Oh, sorry I didn’t show up. It’s just that Captain America kinda pounded me into the mattress and my legs were not that functional.’”
Tony used to think that he knew all about nightmares, seeing that his life was a living one. Being the sole heir of someone like Howard Stark—or as he was ominously known, the Death Monger of the East—was everything but easy, even more so when the man seemed to hate and blame Tony for his mother’s passing after the arduous labor she went through to give birth to him. Tony never got to know any love from his father, and never had the chance of having none from his apparently caring mother—Jarvis liked to tell him all about Maria, at every chance he got—and worse than all, was the intimidating man King Howard keep as his right hand.
Steve Rogers was a man unlike any other, and it terrified Tony how suddenly inclined he was to turn the world upside down in order for it to fit Steve and his little family as it should.
Steve chuckled, low and dark, which sent shivers down Tony’s spine. There was movement, and the next thing he knew, they were crashing on top of the bed with Steve on top, grinning deviously at him, “Was that your motivation for picking that undercover mission? You just wanted me to look like a caveman?”
Steve raised his head and his expression lit up like a kid on Christmas morning, “Really? That good?”
The pause was longer this time, but then there was some shuffling and Steve finally heard a ping, “Tones?”
Steve closed his eyes and leaned into Tony’s touch, seeming peaceful, content, “I’m glad to hear that.”
“Don’t fall prey to the illusion of safety, Tiberius. I take you have never actually met the man in person?”
that Tony actually felt like kneeling down again and giving the man a second round, because damn him if Steve didn’t deserve it.
“If we didn’t need to go on a life threatening mission in a few hours, you can be damn sure we wouldn’t be leaving this bed.”
Morgan was just… not being able to connect with the other kids. During playtime, the girls preferred to play with dolls and pretend they were mommies, which Morgan had nothing against, but wasn’t really much of her taste. She was more fond of plushies - Rilakkuma, in specific - and robots, like the ones her daddy used to make. The other girls, however, always looked at her weird whenever she mentioned her friends U and DUM-E, so after the third failed attempt, she just stopped trying altogether.
But that meant he wasn't usually in contact with the parents of the kids, once Natasha was the one who always took care of that, so he didn't really get to meet the people who cared for the few brilliant children who happened to succeed in his rather difficult scholarship tests.
He turned his attention back to Peter, "With that said, I'll let you go with only a warning this time, but I don't want this to repeat itself, yes? You are one of my best students and I would rather if it you stayed that way."
In less than two minutes, he was running through the glass doors that gave him access to the hangar, which had been already open to allow him passage — no doubt, F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s doing —, just in time to watch the Quinjet’s back door lowering down and his teammates to saunter out of it.
Steve, however, still seemed uncertain, "I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with putting Mary with the bigger kids. I know she will be safe, but she still is very small and might get intimidated, and I don't think I need to tell you she won't fit in well along with the other first graders..."
“I had other plans for him, but honestly, the brat is just too much work. I’ll just crown someone else I find much more worthy of the throne than him, and well, maybe you can use him to warm your bed before the sacrifice?” Howard manically said, tugging at Tony’s robe and making him fight back in fear and confusion, “I guarantee you you won’t regret it! Let me show you, good Lord, and you’ll surely see what I mean.”
Tony smirked wolfishly at her, which immediately caused the woman to freeze and shut her mouth. Flash stared at her with wide eyes, and even Peter's father seemed taken back by her words. Tony leaned forward, propping his elbows on the table and interlacing his fingers as he asked with a rather amused tone, "Impressive, Mrs. Thompson. If you have enough money to pay the bills of a billionaire whose current car is worth more than what your entire family probably earned in the past decade, I wonder why you decided to put your kid on my school. Was it for him to deliberately break my rules and piss me off, or just to have the pleasure of bragging to your high society friends that your child is being taught in the best academy currently existing in American soil? My, am I humbled."
Carol rolled her eyes, “Yeah, Stark, your damn golden retriever was a royal pain in the ass until we finally caught a whiff of that message of yours and I managed to go collect you,” she paused and quirked a brow at him, “only for you to arrive and yell at him until he looked like a kicked puppy.”
avenge them, Steve, but you need to understand you are far too compromised. Maybe you should step down for a moment and I should—”
But as soon as they stepped aside to give passage to the real star of the show, well... Tony couldn’t help but to lift his head from Jarvis’ chest and gawk.
" And then the big screen turned on once again, this time displaying Peter's impeccable grades and spotless history.
Tony felt himself chuckle. That boy truly was something else. "Now, Peter, why don't you go outside and let Mrs. Romanoff know of your future extracurricular activities? Maybe pass by the infirmary to check on your buddy Ned as well. I need to have a word with your father."
, and now that he had stopped to notice, did the headboard have a crack in it? — pillow on Steve’s face, feathers flying everywhere as the super soldier laughed, “Stop looking like a damn puppy, you menace. Makes me want to jump your bones again and I’m regrettably short on fuel.”
"If you actually did, you'd have kicked me out a long time ago," Clint smartly pointed out, earning a thoughtful hum from Tony as he analyzed and measured their hands. The archer narrowed his eyes, "Man, I feel like Tarzan or something. This is so weird."
Struggling, he threw his arms around Steve's neck, burying his fingers through his soft hair as he lost himself in the feeling of being so hungrily kissed by the man he had been desiring for the past two years.
Tony gasped against Steve’s mouth, feeling his entire body lit up like a furnace that grew wilder at every touch. It took him a brief second to understand what was going on, but when he did, he didn’t hesitate to respond in kind, opening his mouth to give Steve’s tongue free access, which the man enthusiastically took advantage of, practically devouring Tony’s mouth and ripping little gasps and huffs from the engineer as his mouth was plundered by the seemingly starving soldier.
The kids surrounding her all perked up and smiled happily at the idea of getting a new friend, but Morgan just pouted and sunk lower on her plush chair. She was hoping something awesome and out of the ordinary would finally happen to make her day less boring, but apparently she was wrong - it was just another new student who would probably ignore or make fun of her, so she failed to be as interested and excited as the rest of the class.
“Is that so?” Steve smirked, sounding all smug, the bastard. “That’s good to hear, I was hoping to impress you.”
” A voice, which was definitely not Tony’s, answered, causing Steve to quirk up a brow and walk towards the gigantic windows that framed the penthouse and offered a breathtaking view of New York city during the night.
Tony's hands were not delicate. Far from it, they were caloused and covered in tiny scars from all his time fixing and building things, which made a stark contrast against Natasha's slender fingers and smooth skin, but still looked fairly normal against Bruce and Clint's own hands, so he hadn't seen much to be impressed.
at her new colleague as the girl continued to frown at the dumbfounded state she had left the classroom. Mary was like her.
“Always so bossy.” Steve shuffled around, removing his fingers from inside Tony - which caused him to gasp - and placing himself in between his legs, “If I remember well, we are equal in here. You are not the boss of me.”
The recording came to an abrupt stop, causing Tony to wordlessly blink at the black screen ahead of him, now reflecting his shocked and devastated expression. He ran a trembling hand across his face, wiping away the tear streaks currently adorning his cheeks and trying his best to ease his thundering heart. “F.R.I.D.A.Y.,” he choked out, “where’s the rest?”
Shaking his head, Tony came to a stop in front of Steve, whose eyes were crinkling at the corners as he smiled at Tony, hand raised like the good soldier he was. Tony regarded him for a moment, taking in all the lines of his expression and how absolutely stunning the man looked even during a comfortable day of lazying out on the couch.
“Language.” Steve scolded softly, prompting his husband to laugh out loud from the other side of the line. “But sure. Don’t take long, though. I’m making your favorites.”
Well, because he never stopped loving that idiot, and he clearly never would. So the possibility of Steve not having left Tony because he hated or had gotten tired of him and yes because of a complete different reason, was more than enough to cause hope to spark inside Tony’s ailing heart. A heart he had closed off years ago, and a heart that didn’t feel like it worked for anyone but his children and his close friends.
” he had choked out; the pain of having watched Peter disintegrate before his very eyes while he could do nothing to stop it still too fresh and raw for him to bear talking about it.
, don’t tell me you are scared of him? We have the power of the Philosopher’s Stone in our hands! There’s nothing that overly big imbecile and his filthy mutts can do against us!”
!” The captain praised, face flushed with how much she was laughing, “I know you said those two had a lot of pent up sexual frustration, but that’s
Obadiah rolled his eyes and walked towards the scotch bottle sitting on his desk and poured himself a glass, “Figured you’d be amused by that. Regardless, feel free to use the Jarvis card with Tony. I’m sure he’ll do anything you ask of him that way.”
“Are you fucking insane, you idiot?!” Bucky yelped, earning even more attention from their pack members, who were growing more and more restless at each word, “That’s suicide, even for you! You might be far stronger a d durable than any of us, but you sure as fuck is not invincible, and you know that!”
Steve chuckled sensually and leaned down to nibble at Tony’s earlobe, only to say, “He got knocked out after you came so beautifully while calling his name.”
” the Captain pressed his lips together, slowly turning his head towards Bruce with a haunted look in his bright blue eyes that had Tony’s throat burning, “
find out that Tony still lives, and the last time I checked, we don’t have access to the damn stone without Tony, so we
“Stubborn assholes with self-deprecating tendencies?” Tony snorted and prompted Steve to chuckle again, “You got that right.”
Sure he was single — things hadn’t really worked with Pepper even after she was snapped back, after all —, but he couldn’t just look at Steve and ask if the guy would like to go out on a date or something. Tony’s bisexuality was news to no one, but Steve? He had
On the recording, Flash arrived with his little group that Tony took his time memorizing the faces, and the good atmosphere on the table immediately evaporated, "Hey there, Parker. Hanging out with Flabby Pants again? You know, you'll end becoming fat by osmosis or something."
Hiya, back with another one. I hope y'all like it! I'm trying some real different stuffs with this story, and stepping through waters I have never before, so oof, hello insecurity!!!
succeed, Tony,” Steve had eventually told him, earning a glare from Tony that gained nothing but an easy smile from the Captain. “And even though I’m not a fan of him getting himself into danger either, we can’t ignore the fact he does have in him what it takes to be a hero. I thought you had told him that if he wasn’t nothing without the suit he shouldn’t have it? Well,” Steve had stepped closer, “guess he proved to you that he, in fact, is quite a lot.”
His attention, however, was on Mrs. Thompson, who looked as red as a tomato and sported a furious expression of raw embarrassment as he spoke up, "So, we are thick as thieves then, Mrs. Thompson? Funny, must have missed that memo since I can't even remember your first name to properly address you, you know, like close friends do."
Steve started to kiss Tony’s back from the beginning of his spine and upwards, proceeding to massage his hips and earning a pleased grunt from the engineer, “It’s a good thing I told the team to get some rest before we leave in the morning. Would hate to be the reason why you can’t fight Ultron.”
Tony had to admit; he was impressed. That was some kind of bullshit only a teenager would be able to come up with, and not a twelve year old.
"Yeah, she was" Tony's smile faltered slightly and he tried to keep the sorrow from his tone, but if Mr. Rogers noticed it, he didn't show. "But enough about me and my family, it's yours we need to address. You see, my scholarship program is still a work in progress and I plan to expand it in the future, but the Elementary grade will have a different approach. I'm still working on it, but I'd love little Mary to be one of my first students to enter via the Elementary Scholarship program, just like her older brother."
”. It had been a jab at Tony’s own actions and he knew it - no wonder he jumped at the first opportunity of arguing with the Star Spangled Man about it -, but it made him feel no better about it.
Ned yelped once he fell on the floor, and Peter immediately went for his aid, "Ned! Oh my god, are you alright?!"
idea. Tony had had the hope that maybe Steve would eventually show signs that he swung both ways due some lingering looks he sometimes caught being directed his way, but given Steve didn’t seem to have dated a single guy — that Tony knows of, at least — he was unsure. Surely America’s golden boy wasn’t gay, right? Would ruin his reputation or whatever the hell conservationist a-holes preach about, not to mention the guy was originally from a time where being gay could actually land you in jail, so let’s just say Tony’s hopes that Steve would reciprocate his feelings one day weren’t really the biggest, which,
Morgan didn’t have time to question what she meant, since the next thing she knew they were standing by their daddies and Mary was startling them out of one of those weird trances they got into when they were looking at each other.
Steve hummed in appreciation, returning his hand to Tony’s hip and massaging the spot slightly, “As you wish.”
“Sure is,” Steve nodded and smiled gently at Tony, “we still have a great mass of media waiting for your big revelation outside, though, and I’m pretty sure Pepper is going to kill you
perceptive for a little girl of her age, and she knew her daddy wasn’t great with dealing with guilt -, so she really didn’t want to worry him more.
Natasha smirked, “Honestly,” then walked by him, not before smacking his ass and causing him to yelp, “Go get him, tiger.”
She already knew how to spell the name of the animals. Her daddy always took time from his busy schedule to teach her about everything her little sponge of a brain could absorb, and it she
“What?!” He yelped, eyes wide as saucers and focused on the King as he sat on his throne and continued to analyze the papers in front of him, “What the hell you mean by that, father?!”
“I’d have scoured the entire galaxy to look for you if I had to,” Steve fervently vowed; the sheer determination sparkling inside his cerulean eyes causing every single cell inside Tony’s body to tremble, “And I’d only stop once I found you.”
? Tony was so damn sure he never fucking cared during those years, and now he finds out he did? And that he
“Kill us now, and you won’t be any better than King Howard,” Tony repeated, feeling confidence build within as the Viking tilted his head slightly, “Most people in this room didn’t have a choice but to serve under him. I’m not sure what has transpired during the attack to your people, but in the name of my headstrong father and my entire kingdom, I humbly apologize.”
“Good ol’ Jarvis has cared and looked after Tony ever since he was a baby. The boy sees him as some kind of surrogate father, since his presence made up for Howard’s absence and own failures,” Obadiah explained, getting up from his chair and walking towards the grand window situated behind his desk.
The offended gasp from the other line actually had Steve laughing. Wasn't hard to picture Tony’s outraged expression, “
slow idiots.” She explained with an easy smile, getting into a more comfortable position that allowed Carol to lay in the middle of her legs, “Not to mention you helped Tony as well,
Steve considered him for a moment, and Tony could almost hear the gears inside his head working until his face lit up with understanding and Steve gaped at him, “Y-You mean…”
Tony's expression hardened even more as he rested against his chair's backrest "And why do I find that hard to believe?"
“Lower your tone, boy, you are speaking to your king.” Howard had lightly scolded without looking up from the parchment, and Tony felt the already cackling fire inside his chest burn like a furnace.
Tony felt a pleasant shiver course through his body before yet another term of endearment, “Ah, well,” he sighed contentedly while trying to unfasten Steve’s flannel with shaky hands, “I wanted to be surprised.”
His skin was warm, far warmer than the other's had been, and his elongated and rather chunky fingers practically eclipsed Tony's own as he moved their fingers together and took a moment to understand the sensation. Steve had been watching him in silent curiosity, but Tony couldn't move his eyes away from their hands, and neither could he ignore the sparks of electricity that seemed to course through their conjoined digits.
Natasha rubbed their noses together and giggled softly — a sight reserved to Carol only, “You big sap. Are you sure you aren’t related to Steve in any way?”
"Well, I suppose it works." He agreed and then looked down at his son, "You won't skip not even a single day, and no videogames for a week."
"A friend, but back to the subject, no, I wasn't too harsh. I give the younger kids two chances, which is more than I give the teenagers. I rather not have this kind of thing in my school, seeing the repercussions it may bring in the future."
A chorus of ‘No!’ and ‘We’ll follow anywhere, Captain!’ were the answers he got, and Steve couldn’t help but smile widely in response. It never ceased to amaze him how loyal the Commandos were. Most days he didn’t feel like he deserved such loyalty, mainly now that he was practically leading them into death’s jaws, but there was no doubt he was more than grateful to have them, and he would do his best to keep them safe through this madness.
A few months later Morgan was born, healthy and beautiful and absolutely everything Tony thought he’d never deserve. He was over the moon about his little girl and about his future wife - as they decided to marry once Morgan was born because Darlene didn’t want to look “fat” in her wedding dress - so once they went home that night, he expected nothing but bliss and happiness in his future.
understand, Steve. I don’t know what happened!” Tony bit back, shutting Steve up and making him clench his jaw, “You
Tony felt his eyes water, and before he knew, he was reaching for Steve’s face and gently stroking his cheekbones with his thumbs, as his remaining digits took delight in touching the truly soft beard beneath them. The touch seemed to surprise Steve, judging by the way his eyes snapped open in alarm and the amazed look he directed towards Tony.
The boy immediately blushed in embarrassment and looked away, while his father beamed at the display with pride in his eyes and another breathtaking smile stretching those absurdly inviting lips. Something inside Tony felt giddy at the thought that something he'd done had brought such joy to the man's previously tempestuous expression, but he shook himself out of it.
Many Vikings growled at that, while King Steve scowled. Tony felt his insides twist with frustration, “What dignity?!” Tony barked back, voice a handful of octaves higher, “You listened to Obadiah’s bullshit again, didn’t you?! Probably one of your drunkard days, where he weasels into your office and makes stupid suggestions, that you just happily agree with!”
“I’ve seen it,” Tony whisper confessed, “Your talk with Bruce… I— I was bored, and Fri said she had a few videos from a few years ago she thought I should check. At first I thought it was nothing much, but then I watched when you arrived at the compound after rescuing Vision, and your talk with Bruce,” he bit his bottom lip, feeling his face warm up as he grew flustered to keep going, “Is it true… that you stopped caring about how you looked?”
Tony’s self-deprecating thoughts balked, and he turned just in time to watch Steve Rogers climb up the rest of the stairs. The hell? Did his thoughts of the man actually summon him or something? Tony frowned. “Hey Cap. Something’s wrong?”
“Then take him!” Howard yanked Tony’s arm, making him yelp in surprise. The room went silent again as the king went on like a madman, “The heir of the kingdom which caused you so much trouble. That should even things out!”
“I was expecting you to have charmed the boy to our side by now, but since you failed to do that, I thought It was time to give you a little push.” Obadiah took a sip of his drink, ignoring the other man’s unhappy frown at being called an incompetent,
Obadiah clenched his jaw, raising his eyes from the paper he had been reading as Tiberius sauntered inside his office as if he owned it. He huffed and glared at his business partner, “What have I told you about entering my personal office without knocking?” Obadiah snarled, being completely ignored by Tiberius as he plopped down one of the velvet carmesin chairs situated in front of the mahogany desk.
Steve’s change of look had shaken him so much, but he just knew it was surprisingly thrilling. Maybe it was the fact that he had grown used to see the man always looking perfect and not having a single strand of hair out of place, and that it was absurdly exciting to see a different side of him — a more rogue, feral side in a way.
She had fiery red hair that fell over her shoulder until it reached her waist that was covered in intricate braids, and bright emerald green eyes that scanned the room with bone chilling precision. Tony felt himself shrinking in place, and if he was intimidated by the double-edged ax she carried in one of her hands, it was nobody’s business.
"It's about respect, Rogers! Respect!" Tony rebuked, gesturing wildly, "How am I supposed to lead this peanut gallery with you if they don't even respect me!"
“That settles it then!” Tiberius jumped to his feet, turning to leave, but stopping at the last second to turn back to Obadiah with a frown, “One thing, though, why only tell me about this now? I have been asking for you to help me with Anthony for
mean if given the opportunity, and Morgan was stronger than any of them. She was proud to hear that from her daddy, and took his advice to heart, but it didn’t change the fact that it still hurt how lonely she felt whenever the girls refused her or the boys picked on her.
After what felt like hours, the kiss finally came to an end, leaving both panting and breathless as they clung to each other for dear life — actually, Tony did. He wasn't trusting his legs much at the moment.
you, I…” He shook his head softly, seeming distraught, “I’m pretty sure I’ll lose it if it happens again, so I came to a conclusion.” He focused on Tony, “Bucky is family, and he will always be, just like the team, but
The man in question chuckled, the soft and smooth sound warming Tony from head to toe, “There’s nothing great about a man who lies and cowers from his mistakes, and besides,” Steve stepped even closer, shortening the already short space between them, “I think you already proved countless times that I was wrong that day, haven’t you?”
A few hours later after that, the team had left to their mission, and Tony remained behind to help them from afar — which he did, greatly, but refused to accept any video calls from Steve and spoil the surprise. Natasha often teased him about how much of a kicked puppy Steve looked when Tony dismissed his video calls, and Tony always did his best to play the fool and pretend he had no idea what she was talking about. Judging by her knowing smiles, she knew he knew, and he loved her for that.
Peter climbed up the stairs two steps at a time, far too energetic to bother catching the elevator. He just could believe he had made Mr. Stark proud to the point the man would even consider suggesting him to accept an offer to join the Avengers! Sure it had been a test, but still! Not to mention Peter had gotten to see from up close the brand new Avengers HQ and even would be able to get some private training with
Grunting in annoyance, Tony hauled himself off the creaky bed inside the room and sauntered off, not bothering to close the door behind him as he climbed up the stairs that led to the superior level of the barn and gave access to a small clear space covered with tools and the like. Said space had a hatch on the ceiling, which remained open for whatever reason, and offered some good lighting due the new moon’s bright glow and a breathtaking view of the night sky, which was covered in a large arrange of stars that were not obscured by the usual city lights. Tony sat himself on a stack of hay and looked upwards, admiring the view he hardly ever got to see while living in New York. It was truly mesmerizing in a way that caused his eyes to become full blown as he wondered how long would it take for him to reach one of those stars in one of his suits.
“No we don’t, and I know this is stupid, but I can’t afford to let Stane escape.” Steve argued frantically, earning yet another annoyed huff from his friend, “Come on Bucky, help me out here. I know you are just as angry as I am, they were your friends just as much as they were mine.”
Tony didn’t know what response to expect, because if he was honest with himself, he didn’t really expect opening up this much To Steve - a living legend who used to be his childhood hero only to haunt him for the rest of his life as the man he would never become. He wasn’t ready to realize Steve Rogers held so much power over him when Tony had been sure he nothing more than a friend in which he kept at arm’s length, but apparently, his subconscious disagreed.
"Steve, what the hell!" Tony laughed, softly hitting Steve's chest in disapproval, "You put me down this instant!"
A hint of a smile appeared at the corner’s of Steve’s lips as he cocked his head, the heathen, “I don’t know what you are talking about?”
Tony had read about those people. They went by many names, but the one that stuck to his brain had been just one: Vikings. Powerful men and women, who pillaged and plundered as they saw fit. They were pagans who worshiped gods different from the Christian one he had grown learning about, and who seemed to really dislike the rival religion. He lost the count of how many times he overheard Howard and Obadiah discussing the attacks to monasteries or Christian communities in distant kingdoms, or how the Scandinavian pirates seemed to be causing a ruckus at the seas. Tony was pretty sure one of their ships had been attacked by Vikings once, and he remembers that Howard had a particularly nasty mood during those days, but it had been just once. Other than that, no barbarians had been seen around their kingdom, seeing they were strategically far from the North where the Norsemen seemed to reside in; but that no longer seems to be the case, and Tony hated Howard more than ever for dismissing his ideas that would help fortify the castle and better prepare their knights for any incoming threat.
