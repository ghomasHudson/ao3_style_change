“Yes. This is my brother, William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
him of his instincts. Someone who’ll let him grow up into whatever he feels he needs to become after this.”
Navigating the busy walkways past multiple museums while invisible proves a challenge, but I’ve done it in London before on the very few occasions Harry let me borrow her cloak. I have to swerve from the direct beeline route towards Sherlock twice until I finally find a bridge to cross the small river that suddenly blocks my way, then it’s mostly straight on.
“Alright. So we modify our already fake family tree some more, that’s easy. Let’s see… So our mother had an affair with a Russian after John was born, he knew and so did his family. Makes Alexey’s mother my cousin, who’s sporadically been in contact. What’s her name?”
“I might be able to if you take that thing off and kiss me, first.”
“Which one? I thought this was all sorted. What did I miss?”
He stares at me in amazement.
The other seven cards connected to the map with yellow strings all only bear an address on top. Eight locations in five countries, and I try to memorize at least the city names. Four of them are in parts of Europe where my German language skills might be of use, another one is in Bristol. That one is crossed out in pencil, probably because returning to England and then leaving the country once more would be too risky right now. Even more interesting is a card pinned to the right edge of the mat, without any strings connecting it to anything. It simply says: “all <50miles from wealthy city”. Interesting. Maybe the masterminds behind this thing need a bunch of rich customers at their brothels and whatever else they are running? I’ll have to wait and see.
“That should be enough for now. I’ll brief Alexey before he is rescued – mother’s cousin Harriet Watson in London, who they were trying to reach when they were abducted. Anything else they’ll probably ask you, not him. He was too young on that trip, and too much has happened, since. Improvise.”
“Welcome on the team, Harriet Watson. I’m starting to be thankful you’re on our side.”
“You’re better at that sort of search than me. I’d miss all of the most important things. Let’s switch roles for that plan.”
“You let him
I can’t help but smile at that. Of course she tracked my movement, how could I expect anything else from her? She’s always been looking out for me, ever since we were sixteen. Even if she never returns to the field, she still has my back.
Sherlock lets go of me enough to look at my face.
“Don’t worry. I live and work alone, and nobody will find out you were here unless your business necessitates it.”
“You said ruckus, John”, he says abruptly, “What did you mean?”
I put my hand on his arm, and he shrugs it off violently. Then, he slams the door forcefully, almost hitting me in the face. I can only hope Sherlock has made it inside by now, and provide some more distraction from outside, hammering and shouting at the door.
“The name Oxana Vasilyeva has come up in a file about a large Interpol case I received this morning. I’m afraid she has passed away a few years ago, but her son Alexey has given your name as his only remaining relative.”
When I finally spot Sherlock, the sight makes me grin. The way he holds his almost-too-thin body is so very familiar, even from behind, but he’s proving his talent for ridiculous camouflage once more. His curly hair, usually just as unruly as Harry’s, is sleeked back tightly, and a full black beard groomed to within an inch of its life matches it and the clothes from the height of popular fashion. I don’t speak Dutch, but compared to the stallkeeper he’s talking to, there seems to be a strong accent in Sherlock’s voice. It reminds me of Afghanistan, so probably something from Western Asia, maybe Arabic or Farsi, to match the slightly darker skin tone he’s pulling off today.
“How did you see all that, John? How?”
She puts down the dough she was working on, studying me.
“Nehmen Sie mich, bitte. Ich werde alles tun, was Sie verlangen, egal was, aber lassen Sie die anderen bitte in Ruhe.“
“The boy is in foster care with the other children he was found with until the authorities can reunite them with their families. He has been through rather a lot, but has not needed any intensive medical attention so far as I know. I believe he did play a major part in uncovering this network and will be called on as a witness despite his young age. Are you still in contact with your father, Ms. Watson? He would be considered a closer relative and probably the first choice of custodian for the boy.”
Still, my heart is racing. This is it. I’m about to join in a part of Sherlock’s work that I’ve not really been in contact with before, having always rather been one for the direct approach.
When I left for Afghanistan after finishing my doctorate, Harry again tried to stop me. She offered to get me out of my contract in some way or other, but I refused. I knew I had to do this, for my own sanity, and eventually, my sister relented. Soon, I found out just how different she and I were. Both of us were good in a fight and would do whatever we had to – but while she had hated every minute of her war, I lived for mine. The adrenaline of working medical support right on the front line, saving people’s lives in the middle of a fire zone, made me feel alive for the first time in my life. All the risks just helped to make me work better than ever before.
“Hauen Sie ab. Wir haben nichts mit Drogen zu tun. Sie sind hier falsch.“
“Wieso das, Heidi?”
“I love you.”
He turns to smile at me briefly, then back to his work.
“What was it that you said to the ones in Lausanne?”, I ask. “Their reaction was pretty entertaining, but I never managed to figure it out. French isn’t my language at all.”
I sit down in a corner quietly and listen to the heated discussion three of his roommates are having on one of the top bunkbeds. The two girls are probably American college students, judging from their age and accents, the East Asian boy seems to be a few years later. They are grumbling about the new drug laws that prohibit the take-out sale of recreational drugs to foreigners. The legendary coffee shops now only allow the in-store consumption of the Dutch favorite drug through diffusers, and these kids are vastly disappointed. I smile. Some things never change. When Harry and I were here at their age, most of our travel group spent a lot of time with sort of thing, too, though we never felt the draw of it ourselves.
“Morning, John.”
“Heidi ist keine zuverlässige Quelle. Es war ihr erster Einsatz dieser Art, und es war ihre verdammte Idee, diesen Idioten vorauszuschicken. Ich hätte es besser wissen müssen, als auf Anfänger zu hören.“
Then, two weeks into my summer brooding, my teammate’s mother knocked on the guestroom door. “There’s a girl downstairs to see you. Dark hair, skinny, didn’t give her name.”
The dining room is set up in the only room without windows, and has always been our top choice for any discussion that absolutely had to remain a secret from the rest of the world. Originally born from Harry’s post-war paranoia, it has gotten a lot of use ever since I met Mycroft Holmes, who still seems to not have figured out anything wrong with our cover identities. Just like in the hallway, here we can plan however much we want to, no matter who is watching our house.
The card connected to Lyon on the map by a yellow string is one of the few that are almost full, and I try to get close enough to read it without getting too close to Sherlock, but it proves impossible. I have to wait until Sherlock finally lays down on the bed and sinks into his mind palace. I lean over the chart and study it, beginning with the Lyon card. On top is what’s probably the address from last night, followed by a few notes like “only entry: front door”, “guards suspicious now” and my favorite in word choice, though not in content: “lim P(office access) -> 0”. It is very much like Sherlock to phrase such things in mathematical formulae.
“I think I have something.”
Finally, Sherlock gives his companion a kiss on the cheek, then they rise from the bed. He hugs her goodbye, and she whispers a few words into his ear again. He nods briskly, then opens the door to leave.
“I’m ready”, he says, without even so much as a greeting. “I need transport to Amsterdam tonight.”
She snorts.
Sherlock laughs out loud at that.
“No problem. Like my brother, family’s always first for me, and I guess there’s four of us to this family now.”
I pull him into my arms tightly, and he snuggles up to me. Sherlock Holmes, snuggling. Just a week ago, I’d have never believed it, but now it feels just right.
Just around the corner from our room, I portkey back to London and find Harry already in the kitchen making tea. It is 3:15 a.m. here, one hour earlier than in Augsburg. Everything I wanted to talk to her about is suddenly forgotten as I pick her up and whirl her around happily.
Every single other deduction he made about her was ridiculously stupid, and I could have thwarted them all with exactly the kind of logic he was so fond of. It might have brought him down a few notches, too – “I usually get one or two things wrong”, indeed. Try “I usually get one or two things right”. Alcoholism? Ridiculous. Harry doesn’t drink, it would interfere with her hormone medications far too badly. Shaky hands are just as typically a symptom of PTSD, as he could have seen easily from my own hands even if he hadn’t known before. Harry’s case of it is just as bad as mine, and the scratch marks on my phone are probably from both of us equally. And sure, alcoholics have a high rate of divorce – but in almost all cases, it’s the partner who leaves, and the alcoholic who keeps crying and drinking even more because of it. No, Harry’s marriage ended when Clara found out Harry’s birth name and reacted badly, threatening to blow our cover.
“Just that cloak.” It’s not even a lie – any other magical item Harry might have, she either bought or made herself, and even if I could think of anything else useful, I wouldn’t want to betray her secrets. “But if we find out where the information we need is hidden, it might help us get it.”
“Is that so? Do tell. What else did I miss on this?”
“How did you find me? How did you find out I’m not dead?”
I was born as the living impersonation of all middle class stereotypes. A single child in the suburbs, born to a vastly overweight salesman and a housewife whose main fear was that anyone might think her or her family to be in any way unusual. They named me Dudley Dursley, no doubt believing the rhyme and alliteration to be cute. Nowadays, I gag at the thought. I was their perfect child, spoiled and overfed till I looked like a perfect round copy of my father, and the arrival of Harry Potter did not change a thing. My mother had always hated her sister and refused to acknowledge her existence, and she immediately transferred that hatred to Harry, who she feared would fit as badly into her perfect world as his parents had.
Sherlock steps up, and I’m surprised at how much restraint he shows over the next hour, going into details and answering even the stupidest questions that might have provoked a scathing remark even from me. In short, he’s being the exact opposite of every time I’ve ever seen him deal with police forces before, and I can’t figure out whether that’s part of his cover identity or a sign of how desperately he wants everything to go right on this case.
The bus stops hourly on average, sometimes more, sometimes less, and each stop means securing my invisibility cloak and trying not to get crushed by the new luggage that’s being stuffed in. Sherlock’s suitcase next to me assures me that he’s still somewhere above, that I won’t accidentally lose contact despite him not wearing the scarf. It really would clash with Jegor Sokolov’s fancy clothes. Somewhere between Brussels and Saint-Quentin, I dig through my backpack for a big lunch. There is nothing in the backpack to occupy my time, as it’s far too dark for the novel I packed and switching on my flashlight seems risky and a waste of batteries, so thinking about what’s to come becomes the default thing to do.
I shrug, even as she opens the hidden safety box in the hallway closet.
“Invisibility does come in handy, even if you did get suspicious every now and then.”
“I understand. Every second counts for those kids, and for their mothers. Go deal with our third, I’ll come join you when I’m done.”
Sherlock and I and on the bed on the bed snogging when there’s a knock on our new hotel room’s door. I jump of the bed, and pull the cloak over myself. Both of us are half undressed, and we cannot risk anything about my involvement in this entering a report. A strange man in Sherlock’s room just might arouse Mycroft’s suspicion.
Niedermayr studies him thoughtfully.
“Well done, John. I didn’t think anyone but Mycroft would catch all that. You were wrong about one thing, though.”
“Mycroft checked that scarf for trackers before he gave it to Molly. I checked it again in case he had placed something. Everything else is new.”
I groaned.
“Of course it is the best! Your mother made this for me!”
“The ballistic report came back, Mr. Poirot, or whatever your name is. The bullet that hid the guard was not fired from his gun, but his gun was fired, and my team members all agree that they heard two shots. The projectile from the guard’s weapon is still missing. So tell me, Jacques - where is that second bullet? Where is the other gun?”
“And sometimes, it’s far more than one or two things.”
Almost exactly twenty-four hours later, Jegor Sokolov and I are leaving a similar hotel in Lausanne. The train ride was uneventful, and I even found a free seat in Sherlock’s compartment and could relax, if not sleep for most of the journey. Sherlock spent most of the day at the hotel brooding over his chart, then contemplating on which role to play this time. It was obvious even to me that the Arab guy from last time was out, as the two guards might have warned the rest of their network about him, but the Russian aristocrat wouldn’t have been my first choice either. Sherlock probably has a reason for choosing such a flashy, easily-recognized role. Maybe he just wants to finally have an excuse to put those ridiculous sideburns into storage and never wear them again?
From the first time he laid eyes on me, he seemed to know everything about me, and it scared me. There was only a tiny fact about Harry in all of his first monologue that didn’t quite match the facts, but the amount of truths he rattled off in so short a time scared and ensnared me. I needed to figure out how much he knew about our past, and how he knew. I needed to make sure Harry was safe, and was quickly dragged into Sherlock’s ridiculous lifestyle in the process.
“See to it that you don’t hurt those I consider family ever again. Bring my nephew here without even another scratch on him, or might be tempted to tell the world just what your role in your little brother’s fall really was. Wouldn’t your parents love to hear the truth about that?”
We drink tea in silence, and I do not dare to speak of anything until we’re safely inside the bakery. There might always be someone watching outside, and there’s no need to alert Mycroft, just yet. We’ll be alone for some hours until the counter staff arrives, and Harry places me on muffin duty, as there’s not much I can ruin stirring together things from a list and filling dozens of paper forms. She starts by heating up the ovens, then deals with the more complicated doughs.
Since I can’t follow the conversation, I decide to inspect the stall instead. There have to be hints that caused Sherlock to stop here instead of at any neighboring ones, and it has long become my hobby to try following his deductions. Two years of living with Sherlock have given me a lot of experience as to what kind of detail he usually looks for, and eventually, I spot a small plastic sign tied to a corner post of the stall. There are eight flags on it, and at first I discarded it as one of those “these are the languages we understand” notes. But the combination of flags is wrong. There’s Canada on it, but not the US or UK, which would be a weird choice to signal “we speak English”. Austria, but not Germany. Italy, France, Turkey, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium does not even have a national language, it uses the ones of three neighbours instead, which is one of the reasons so much of European politics is settled there. The sign just doesn’t make sense on a stall that seems to sell cheap watches and jewelry, but I can’t figure out what it means. Sherlock probably knew immediately, or maybe even came here looking for it.
Sherlock moving around the room finally wakes me. My watch tells me it’s already late afternoon, and I feel surprisingly well rested. Sherlock is getting dressed, this time as neither of the previous identities but as a very mediocre middle-aged man who looks like he could be Djamil al Marad’s father or uncle, and it’s just as interesting to watch as the previous transformation. Back home, Sherlock never let me see this, usually just the finished product when he came back from one of his undercover stunts. Finally, he sorts through his luggage and grabs the barest necessities, then locks up the rest in a closet. Looks like he’s finally ready to leave.
Sherlock does not bother to dress before he opens the door, only briefly glancing into the mirror to check his hair pieces are still in place. He’s buttoning his shirt while he greets the man in front of him, who even I recognize as plainclothes police at first glance.
That night, I dream of Sherlock, of running and giggling and diving for cover. Of shared smiles and quick touches in the middle of firefights.
“Oh, my poor little Ksyusha… I knew I should have been more insistent when the police refused to file her as a missing person because she lived and disappeared outside Europe…”
“Er hat recht, und das weißt du. Sowohl unsere Heidi als auch dieser alte Kerl den du mitgebracht hast haben einstimmig bestätigt dass sie keine Waffe jeglicher Art auch nur in der Nähe dieses Mannes gesehen haben, als die Schüsse fielen. Und sie wären bereit gewesen, den Wächter zu erschießen, wenn er nicht vorher von der anderen Seite erschossen worden wäre.“
Smooth, Sherlock, smooth. Almost as smooth as your landing here, but then again, Harry does like directness. She sighs.
“I love you, too, John Watson. Thank you for coming to find and rescue me, once again.”
I shake my head with a wide grin.
I laugh.
He frowns.
“Ah. So it’s a three-way marriage now. You, me, and the Work.”
“Why?”
He snorts.
“You’ve already figured out one of the major sources of problems. Flip back that hood and listen to me. Be careful not to uncover any of your extremities, especially when it’s windy. The cloak reacts like any other piece of fabric, it will follow the wind. Don’t run if at all possible, or you will uncover your feet. I was really glad it was already dark and you were distracted when we ran earlier, or I might have gotten into serious trouble. Don’t open doors when someone might see them open on their own and come to investigate. Especially be careful of automatic doors, they might betray you. Don’t let the cloak catch on anything.”
I pull the small jewelry box from my pocket and open it. Inside is a deformed bullet, now firmly attached to a golden chain. I place it around Alexey’s neck.
Harry takes of my jacket and opens the car’s trunk, and I add an apology to my grumpy inner monologue. She dawdles long enough putting the jacket in that I can carefully climb inside, and suddenly I realize she’s had more than thirty years of experience in dealing with the problems that might arise while using this cloak, a few of them in the middle of a ridiculously crazy civil war. She’s subtly using every small opportunity to teach me more tricks that might be useful when every mistake could not only be my last but endanger everyone around me.
“Let me try this out before we decide on that.”
“Of course. Please sit. This is about the children?”
[Alright, alright, mate. I’m leaving.]
“I’ll miss you, Mrs. Hudson, but everything here just reminds me too much of him right now. Would you… could you maybe go to his grave with me again tomorrow?”
“Djamil! You got rid of the beard!”, exclaims the blond one. Sherlock runs a hand through his hair bashfully and gives her an uncertain smile.
“Obviously.”
I nod slowly. This is an offer I’d be a fool to refuse, more than I ever expected from her. She’s quite obviously willing to risk a lot, just to ensure I make it back home safely.
“Don’t forget I’ve been at this for more than a week non-stop. I know exactly what the traps are, and I’ll make damn sure you know, too, before I let you go into that place alone.”
[I thought you were dead!]
“Of course it will, if you practice enough beforehand to avoid risky situations. A few hours should be enough, knowing your speed of figuring things out. And I think Harry won’t rip off my head too much if I tell her why we needed you to be the one wearing it. This would be a case she’d wholeheartedly support.”
“You’re planning something, JD. Please tell me you’re not using an old woman’s grief for some stupid plot, as you always complained about Sherlock doing. I will not let you pick up his morals just to save him.”
“Tempting, but I want to start sorting all this. It’s…”
The man shakes his head.
I might have to warn Harry about that, but she’ll probably laugh it off. She believes Sherlock to be one of the good guys, and she’s right about it, too. He might be deeply curious, but he’s just as loyal as we are.
“Any ideas for an alibi? I drew blanks trying to come up with one so far, but I haven’t yet calculated in your generous offer.”
Things slowly started changing when we turned eleven and were bound for secondary school. Obviously, my parents would never have paid for a “freak” like Harry to go to the same prestigious school they were sending me to, but it turned out that they didn’t have to bother. Ridiculously, the reason for Harry’s “freakishness” turned out to be magic – he was a wizard, and had already been enrolled at the most prestigious school of magic in Britain at birth, all tuition paid.
Also, I've gone back and double-spaced the paragraphs of all chapters for easier reading. You're welcome.
“My father needs new passport pictures”, Sherlock explains smoothly, and I glare at him. I’m only six years older than him, though it does look more like twenty the way we are currently dressed.
I can feel Sherlock kiss me on the forehead lightly.
When she picked me up three days later, she had somehow changed my complete paperwork to the name of John Watson. All the school documents, even my boxing history. Of course, as I had almost expected from her sense of humor, she’d food the loophole in our agreement and saddled me with an utterly ridiculous middle name, but I couldn’t even be mad at that. She’d sold her godfather’s magical townhouse on the outskirts of London and used the proceeds as well as most of her inheritance to afford us a smaller property more centrally in the city, far away from suburbs like the one we grew up in and from anywhere the wizarding world might look for her. Neither of us brought much from our old lives, and we settled in quickly and found a routine. I kept up my boxing to keep in shape, and she started knitting, supplying me with an endless stream of sweaters that I proudly wore and quickly figured out to have more to them than the average store-bought.
“Did the great detective ever figure out how much you learned from him, or is he once again trying to fool you along with the rest of the world?”, Harry asks as she enters the room with a big tray of food. I return the grin.
Sherlock nods, every inch the seasoned investigator.
She scowls.
“I did what I had to do. The war’s over, the monster who killed my parents is dead, and now I’m done doing what everyone wants me to do. I’m leaving that world. I’m leaving everything. Wanna come with?”
“Morning, Sherlock. Figure out anything else yet?”
And Molly Hooper, the only morgue employee to know better, is on a leave of absence until after the funeral, supposedly to give her the time to mourn her friend. I smell a conspiracy.
He stares at me incredulously.
“You’re good at this”, Sherlock says approvingly, and for a moment I get almost jealous. It should be me Sherlock’s collaborating with on a case, not my sister. But this is for the boy’s sake, and she’s very much a part of this now.
Sherlock launches off into a whirlwind explanation that hints at a lucrative combination of smuggling and international terrorism, without ever stating anything truly incriminating outright. He’s far too good at this, and I tune out quickly. The self-proclaimed “IT-specialist” listens with rapt attention, apparently very much in favor of this business proposal. I look around the room and the ones I can reach without opening doors instead, but apart from this one small office, which contains nothing but computers and computer parts, this seems to be the very typical home of a young single man, so I finally go back to watching them. It seems that they come to a mutually beneficial arrangement, as Sherlock eventually hands over a memory stick and they agree on another meeting within three weeks, which apparently is the time completion of the first sample identity will need.
His distrust only seems to grow.
I blush at the insinuation, but Sherlock just turns around to her, grinning.
“You’re damn sexy either way!”, the girl assures him, and her friend loudly agrees.
The front door has hardly closed when Harry grips my shoulder and yanks me around to look at her. Her anger reminds me of Sherlock, burning bright and furious.
I nod, and she drapes the cloak over me. I clutch the edge of it with one hand to make sure I won’t leave it behind when I port.
We end up on the bed facing each other, kissing over and over again, holding hands and looking at each other.
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate before ascending, and I time every one of my steps to fall simultaneously with his. A man who looks too young to mastermind anything worthy of Sherlock Holmes’ attention waits in a doorway on the next floor. Then again, James Moriarty was not all that much older than the apparent late twenties of this man, maybe a few years younger than Sherlock’s late thirties, and he’d been heading an international criminal network for years when he died. Anything is possible.
At “garish”, I suddenly remember something that makes me smile.
“Uh-huh.”
Watching Harry turn into me is a scary sight. The potion seems to turn her inside out, and the expression on her – no, my – face afterwards matches the effect. Pain and disgust show clearly, and it’s disconcerting to see it on those features without feeling it myself. When she talks, it’s my voice, but with her cadence. Our dialects are similar, but something still feels wrong about it. My vocal cords trying to produce her voice. She frowns.
“He deserved it, and he knows it. And it’ll probably help convince him I have no clue you’re alive, no connection to that case you’re in Germany for. And if it helps Alexey get here even one day quicker and with less trouble, all the better.”
“I told him about the cloak. I showed him.”
Sherlock opens the door wider and waves towards the small table.
“What? Then who…”
“So this is it, then. This is how I finally crack. Hallucinating my only friend when the real him thinks I’m dead, inventing ridiculous, un-scientific gadgets to explain his presence. Giggling when I really should be crying about what I had to do today.”
here with soldiers in training, they tended to get pretty rowdy on the weekends. Might need some cover identity though, something along the lines of your disguises. Think you can help?”
I feel torn as to what to feel about the whole thing. Parts of me scream at me to turn away as I did in Lyon, that this is private, while others desperately want to keep watching. Some parts want to be deeply jealous that it’s not me Sherlock is caressing that way, others remind me that Faduma is exactly the type of woman I usually prefer. At the same time, I can’t help but remember over and over again that neither of them is quite doing this of their own free will. They are both forced to do this, even if they have very different reasons for it.
Sensing the presence of Sherlock’s scarf in the suitcase next to me is incredibly comforting. It has come to mean Sherlock’s near, over the years. On instinct, I reach out to Harry instead. I can only feel location, not what’s going on or how she’s doing, but she’s at work, and I know she’s always happy when she’s baking.
His face is still insecure, far beyond anything just about anyone might ever associate with him. It throws me so badly I can’t stifle the urge to react sarcastically.
“Southwestern Russia, near the Ukrainian border. Bright, with the talent for languages children so often have and don’t get to train, and yes, very much like John. Like you, too, from what I saw today. Brave, loyal, protective, starting to develop the cynicism associated with bad experiences. Dark hair, so more believably a relative than if you’d have looked more like John.”
I smile, remembering just how much not silent Sherlock was and is always prone to make things, and how much Mrs. Hudson usually reacted to it.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. I will bring the boy to visit you when he’s adjusted to life in London a bit. I know how much you like spoiling your sister’s grandchildren, and I’m sure Alexey will love you just as much as Sherlock and I always have.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do hope you’ll excuse half of them for a few hours now.”
“Good luck, JD. I’m expecting a check-in in a few days. Try to keep both of you alive, will you?”
Sherlock stares at her in wonder.
I reach out and yank the hood of the cloak off his head, probably taking some of his hair with it. I don’t care. I need something to aim my incredulous glare at – I know something weird would happen if I let Sherlock borrow that thing.
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe the fact that us Watsons are just as loyal as we are stubborn, or the fact that we’d never let anyone close to us go into battle without looking out for their safety any way we can? Maybe the fact that you’re a sentimental fool whop couldn’t help but take a memento, and managed to choose the tracker I placed on you after I was almost too late to save you on our first case together, or that I swore back then to protect you better in the future?”
I smile forlornly.
“Highlighted where they’re holding kids and where women for those places I know yet. Added some notes on the place here in Augsburg, and some of the things Alexey told me. Trying to build a battle plan for today.”
“Give me a few hours, then I’ll be back. Maybe you’ll be done with that by then.”
“And you wouldn’t be the Sherlock Holmes I love if you didn’t. This is a three-way marriage, after all”, I joke.
“Please do, my good man. We will be here.”
After another bite, I nod.
“You do look too proper to be looking for drugs on the street. We’re not exactly the same size enough to be sharing disguises, though. Might have to buy something. Possibly something ratty and garish, to underline the cluelessness.”
“How do we know you’re not going in to warn them?”
I kiss him again, trying to let him feel how much he means to me.
“Of course, Mrs. Hudson. Whichever way you prefer. I’m just thankful you’re coming with me. I really couldn’t stand the thought of going out there alone, and I’m already asking so much of my sister moving in with her…”
Sherlock shrugs eloquently.
He points at the chart.
I smile at him brightly.
“Ist ja schon gut, Kumpel. Ich geh ja schon.”
We talk through the rest of the battle plan again, and I modify Sherlock’s ideas by making him take both his scarf and my gun, just in case. Not taking my backpack feels wrong, but I do realize it would not fit the image I’m trying to portray. It’s not all that late yet, but I think both of us are too fraught with nerves to stay at the hotel any longer. It will be a new method of investigation for either of us, and we decide on another bit of practice, this time for both of us.
Sherlock contemplates that for a while, then nods briskly and turns of the shower.
Down dozens of side streets, over bridges and down more quaint little side streets along concreted brooks. I have rarely seen so much water in one city, and I might actually enjoy it under different circumstances. Not now. Now, I run, not daring to glance left or right for fear of letting Sherlock Holmes out of my sight. I fear what he might do.
A small smile starts to appear on his face, so I rant on.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. That means a lot to me.”
The girls squeal.
I wrap my arms around him from behind.
“Sure, maybe that was part of it. I did work with you for years and learn a few things. But it wasn’t what I was thinking. The first, the most glaring mistake, was Moriarty’s death. It just didn’t make sense, not to anyone with half a brain cell who knew the case. Even if the Yard never seems to have figured that out.”
“Dinner, a shower and some good, hot tea. Not necessarily in that order. A change of clothes and possibly a few hours of sleep before going back into the fray. Think those are possible?”
The guards watch Sherlock closely, but he does not show even the slightest bit of surprise. Either he suspected this, or he is even better an actor than I thought. His eyes slowly move through the room, following first one child, then another, probably deducing things about how this place treats them. One of the older ones, a boy of maybe ten or eleven, steps up in front of him.
“I’ve sort of been following you since Amsterdam.” Anticipating his next response, I continue: “And no, I am absolutely sure there is nobody else who managed to follow you. Nobody else has the means I used.”
It is only a few stops to what I know from our earlier trip to be the main transfer point of the star-shaped network. It is not quite as crowded as in the daylight, but there are still a lot of people here waiting for trams or friends. Grinning wildly, I wave through the crowds, one hand always on the opposite wrist to track Sherlock’s position. He’s having trouble keeping up, and I wait on the corner of a side street at the other end of the plaza.
“I put the tracker on him”, I hasten to defend myself, “and was right next to him the whole time, I promise. And I’ve brought it with me now, too. I had no other chance. He was the only one who knew what information we needed exactly and where to find it. I promise, I made sure everything went as safely and secretly as it could. Ask him yourself if you want, he’d never endanger me that way. You’re safe.”
I nod.
“He stayed to protect the other kids, and from what we saw today, probably somewhat successfully, too.”
I put some meat into my mouth and start chewing, then another bite. It gives me time to think. Unlike Sherlock, who constantly complains about food slowing down his thought processes, keeping my jaw muscles busy always seems to help me concentrate. Then again, it is probably a good thing Sherlock has never picked up that habit for himself – the only thing annoying police officers at a crime scene more than Sherlock Holmes and his deductions might just be a Sherlock chewing gum while he makes deductions at a crime scene. The mental image alone has made me grin at inappropriate times on a few occasions.
“Bulletproof vest? I seem to have missed you putting that on. That’s why I was so uncertain.”
“Harry wants to talk to you. Pack all that, we’re going to London.”
I smile and poke him in the arm.
They drag Sherlock up the stairs, into a room with a young Slavic woman who probably would be quite pretty under different conditions. I watch from the doorway, torn between the needs to rescue Sherlock and not blow my cover. The guard who first opened the door seems to be the more dominant of the two and says something to Sherlock in Arabic. I don’t understand the language, but his leery, malicious tone makes it obvious what he wants. Sherlock’s response is probably meant to sound just as leery and expectant to boot, but I don’t quite buy it, and neither seem the two men to. One of them gestures to the woman, then to Sherlock’s midsection, and they don’t even bother to close the door as she falls to her knees and opens his trousers. Once again I am tempted to intervene, but while Sherlocks struggles a bit against the hands still clasping at his arms, he definitely doesn’t put up even a small part of the fight I know him to be capable of. Maybe he has a plan after all – is he really willing to go this far just for a case?
The guard barks another question, and this time, Sherlock answers with a single word for once: “Exquisite”, followed by a question I guess to be about money, as that is what he hands over a moment later. Then, he steps over the threshold, and for a moment I am tempted to stay in the hallway. Then, my sense of loyalty wins out, and I hurry past him.
Harry gasps and claps a hand to her mouth in apparent shock.
“What do I call you now?”
I have missed that wicked smile, I truly have.
He tries to slam the door in my face, but I reach out with my free hand to stop it.
She is the only one I have ever told about my feelings for Sherlock, the only one except him who knows how badly every life I can’t save pulls at me. And she is also the only one who might be able to help me solve this case – my first case without Sherlock, the case of Sherlock Holmes himself. But it is not safe to talk out here, not with Mycroft’s car still outside and Mycroft himself in control of all security cameras in London. Very, very subtly, without loosening the hug, I push Harry back into the doorway, and she understands. Within seconds, the door closes behind us, and she pulls back to give me a scrutinizing look. The hallway is one of very few areas of the house that are safe from observation.
“Your invisibility cloak, and an alibi for the next few hours. There’s something wrong with this, and I will find out.”
Sherlock and I leave for Baker Street early in the morning, him still in invisible. Mrs. Hudson invites me to join her for morning tea, and I couldn’t refuse even if I wanted to. I only wish Sherlock could join us, too, but it’s too dangerous.
“With all due respect, sir, without my information you wouldn’t even know this case exists.”
“Fine.”
I smile. Nice to know that Sherlock thinks he and I are married, now.
[Nobody must know I’m here. I watch out for Jacques like you do for the other children. That works better when nobody sees me.]
“John joined the army because he felt inadequate.”
I watch Djamil al Marad transform into Jegor Sokolov in a public restroom near Amsterdam Sloterdijk station the next morning. Sherlock actually deigned to have breakfast at the hostel before he checked out, probably because there won’t be enough input to really think about the case until we reach Lyon, so I managed to sneak healthy portions off the buffet when nobody was watching and he was seated at a table, and the big communal bathrooms with multiple shower stalls meant I could actually have a shower without fear of discovery. Two less things to worry about, so I can enjoy watching the transformation. The two identities have next to nothing in common. After Djamil’s beard already disappeared yesterday, the next step was a complete change of wardrobe. Compared to the height of fashion Djamil was wearing, Jegor’s choice of clothes seems almost out of this world. He’s the very image of a stuck-up aristocrat, in finery that might almost make Mycroft Holmes look plebeian. Sherlock only makes it worse by adding huge blond sideburns that make his narrow face look a lot wider, as well as a straight-haired blond wig that almost reaches his collar. The result looks like someone who belongs in the backseat of an expensive car, and the thought that he’ll soon be traveling in something  as common as a long-distant bus seems utterly ridiculous. This is quite obviously not an identity for stealthy operations, but for direct interaction.
She laughs softly.
“Good luck, JD. I really hope you’ll find him. You need each other.”
“Nah. They wanted me to become a new figurehead, marry someone from the sect and raise a lot of good little believer kids. But I called in some favors, new identities, new life. Got close to being discovered some years ago when my new wife turned out to be one of them and found out who I was, but… we’ve managed.”
She rises, turning to Sherlock and unlocking his handcuffs. Her accent is heavy, obviously not as used to communication in other languages as Niedermayr is.
“Why, Molly Hooper, of course. She not only helped me fake my death, that ‘convenient leave of absence”, as you so eloquently put it, was actually used to help me prepare and get me out of the country without even Mycroft’s attention. He would have tried to stop me. But still, well done. Don’t worry, even I sometimes get a thing or two wrong. And I did not realize that they would have Mycroft identify me again after Molly already did.”
Niedermayr sounds unconvinced.
He smiles uncertainly, then drops the rest of the cloak.
“Yes. I tried to stabilize him just by being there, but he was so deeply in shock… he kept thinking I was a hallucination, a sign that he’d finally cracked.”
“From what I know, Sherlock can take a lot of things he usually dislikes when it’s for a case. Solving that sort of crime keeps him going even through really bad experiences. And you know him better than anyone else in this world, probably. Watch him closely, and I’m sure you will be there to intervene when he’s nearing his breaking point. I know you, JD. You won’t let it get that far, you’ll step in before some case or other breaks him, and you’ll know when it’s time. That’s why you’re doing this ridiculous thing, after all.”
Alexey smiles uncertainly and nods. Sherlock keeps running on his monologue, and I catch Harry’s name multiple times. A ruckus starts downstairs, and I can hear someone running in the hallway up here. Only barely do I manage to shrug the cloak back on and step out of the way before the guard from a few minutes barges in, brandishing a gun.
"Did you think that when you took off on your own after we left Kitty Reilly’s place, I’d just go back to Baker Street and drink tea while I wait for you? It was obvious he had to be the one responsible, so I figured confronting him about it might be the only somewhat useful thing I could do. And he really seemed torn up about the whole thing, about trying to buy a confession from Moriarty by trading stories about your life. Use it to blackmail him into getting Interpol to help us or something.”
“I went in undercover as a customer before, and got a lot of information from one of the children. A Russian boy named Alexey. I’m afraid the proprietors of this establishment might figure it out and try to kill him during the raid to eliminate an important witness. I would very much like to prevent that. He risked a lot to help us.”
“Yeah, I… I thought I’d try something new on this trip. I love the beard, but…”
Harry smiles softly, but sadly.
“He admitted to that? My brother actually admitted to making a mistake of that order? I suspected a connection, but… When? How?”
“Welcome back, John.”
Sherlock shrugs.
He clicks around some more, but nothing else seems to catch his interest. Finally, he restores the screen to the way it was when we came in, then sneaks out of the room to inspect the rest of the flat. I press against the wall next to the front door, planning to sneak out in front of him when he opens it. Sherlock returns quickly. Like me, he seems to not have found anything interesting. Nice to know I’m getting better at this.
Weißmüller shrugs.
“Thank God you’re alive… I was afraid I had lost you for a while. I was so scared you were dead, even if there was no blood…”
Hours later, we are ready to go. Sherlock refused to be wired “in case they search me”, and I grinned at the thought. Armed and invisible, I follow him to the door of the establishment soon to be raided, knowing the police is watching. This is it.
The bus overtakes me a half-hour later, but I can’t bring myself to care much. I finished my early dinner while I walked, and I’m getting close to wherever Sherlock’s stopped. Finally reaching a large, cheap hostel surprises me. Is there someone or something here he’s investigating, or is he staying at this place? It seems out of character, but maybe it’s part of his cover identity. The trace leads me to an eight-bed dormitory, but Sherlock’s not in it. He’s locked the scarf in a small suitcase on one of the beds, and I can only hope he will be back soon and not go on his next adventure without it.
“I remember the looks on those guards’ faces when you paid them for their role in that… I almost blew my cover trying to keep in a fit of giggles… that was one of the reasons why I provoked you so much at the bar today. To warn you how hard such things can get.”
“That’s not your mourning face, dear brother. What do you need?”
“They might still get suspicious if another English speaker comes calling so soon after me. Still too risky. How good is your German? Just enough to order tea? “
We port back to Baker Street right from the IT specialist’s office, and I say goodbye to Mrs. Hudson as soon as we’ve gotten rid of our camouflage. She does not need to know that the things in the bag I carry are not from upstairs, but were only bought today.
Yes, sister dearest, I get the hint. Now please tell me how the fuck I’m supposed to solve this mess – are you deliberately challenging me to make me turn back from my plans?! Mrs. Hudson pats “his” arm.
“Forensics is something with dead people, right?”, she asks, and I can imagine the scathing remarks Sherlock would love to make at that perfectly.
“I understand you were the one who uncovered this ring?”
“Did you sleep at all?”
I rise, and collect some of my things, most importantly my backpack and the cloak. I don’t quite trust Sherlock not to experiment with either, even while he’s busy with a case.
“Actually, John, I’m not here about you”, Mycroft clarifies. I pretend to startle. “Your sister’s name has come up in a file that landed on my desk this morning, and seeing the relation, I decided to visit both of you myself instead of leaving it to the usual authorities.”
He thinks for a moment.
I look at my watch. Roughly twelve more hours to drive Sherlock crazy waiting. This will be an interesting night.
Mycroft is clearly taken aback by my sudden attack on his person. Good. That was exactly my intention – distract him from Harry.
This is starting to become fun. I put on desperate tones, hoping they sound convincing.
Shops in the city center are not yet closed, and I end up buying a dark crimson scarf that wouldn’t actually be too ridiculous if it weren’t paired with this cardigan. It picks up the red from the flame motif badly, completing the effect, and offers opportunity to practice talking like the run-down biker I pretend to be while talking to the shop-girls. Meanwhile, Sherlock creeps around the department store doing who-knows-what, and on the spur of the moment I decide to take some pictures at the old-school photo box in a corner of the store for Harry.
“Why?”
“You and him will both learn, give it time. You’ll help him in other ways that we can’t.”
“Is it okay if I don’t want to go any further than this for a while? You do owe me a favor, I believe. I’d be willing to use that.”
She tears up at that, and suddenly grasps me into a hug.
The portkey’s tug on my intestines feels almost familiar the second time around, and I manage to catch myself far more easily now that I know what to expect. I am back in Harry’s dining room, and it almost feels like coming home. I put my coat and backpack on the table with the portkey, then leave the room in search of my sister.
I shake my head.
“He kissed me! He really kissed me!”
“That’s sort of a long story, not really one to be shared in a shower. Maybe… maybe we can take this outside and get dressed first?”
I don’t know what to say to that.
The answer comes so quickly that I know she’s thought about it a while, possibly all throughout my afternoon investigations.
“Alright, now shoot”, she finally says, already arm-deep in another bat of dough.
The evil grin she gives me is contagious even before she starts talking.
We work quietly for a while, both lost in our thoughts. Finally, Harry asks:
He’s starting to get annoyed.
“Losing my balance and almost falling. Well spotted. I shared all of your rooms, I have to admit, even if I did try to give you privacy. But please, never travel by long-distance bus again if there is any way you can avoid it.”
“Believe it or not, it’s the nicest thing he owns.”
He stares at me for a long while, obviously not used to anyone but Sherlock talking to him that way. Finally, he nods briskly.
“They just let you go?”
“Yeah.”
Niedermayr hands him a business card.
[Exactly. And we’ll all look after you the same way we look after each other.]
“Alexey. All of his family are dead, now, and I really don’t want him to go to foster care after what he’s been through. He’s special, that one, and he should have someone who understands.”
“Now that’s something you don’t say often”, I mutter, and they both grin.
Sherlock’s new “business partner” walks him to the door, and I slip out while they are exchanging pleasantries. Going down the stairs either before or directly behind Sherlock has too many ways unfortunate sounds could arouse his suspicion, so I decide to stay on this floor until he leaves. He is still wearing his tracker, and even Sherlock will hopefully not get into trouble if I leave him alone for a few minutes. Both the man who lives here and I wait for until the front door falls shut behind Sherlock. With a sigh of relief, the specialist disappears in his flat, and I slowly start towards the stairs, listening from the slightest sound from below. It would be very much like Sherlock to close the front door from the inside and hide down there somewhere, though I can feel Sherlock’s tracker move away, so my paranoia is probably unjustified this time. The stairs still creak with every step, and I’m very glad I waited. This surveillance thing might turn out rather difficult if he continues to visit places like these, and I have no clue what methods of travel he might use. Some might be virtually impossible to accompany, but I’ll have to cross that bridge when I come to it.
“In this outfit?”, the shopgirl asks doubtfully, and Sherlock gives her his most disarming smile.
“It’s one of our main informants. Ten-year-old Russian kid, incredibly bright and clever. The human trafficking ring we’re investigating specializes on putting single mothers and their kids in different brothels, blackmailing them to comply by threatening to kill the other. But this boy, Alexey… he’s known his mother’s dead for years, but he stayed on to protect the other kids. Went through some bad shit for it, too. Sherlock’s been obsessed with finding him a good home.”
“John? Mycroft Holmes is here!”
“Very funny, John”, he snarls quietly when he finally catches up, and I laugh.
“Will you tell me what he said to you? Even if I turn out just to be a symptom of your madness, it’s always helped you sort things out when you explained them to me. I was there, but I don’t speak Russian, so I didn’t understand a word.”
“I’m very sorry for misdeducing your feelings”, he says stiffly. “Please excuse me.”
I hardly dared to hope, but there she was. I recognized her immediately, even though she had quite obviously gone through and already taken the potions she had told me about. The tiny, cautious smile was still the same, as well as her green eyes and the infamous scar. Nothing has ever made me feel quite as relieved as seeing her alive that day, and I couldn’t help but pull her into a tight hug. For a long time, we clung to each other like two people drowning.
When we get back to the hotel, Sherlock immediately returns to his chart, rapidly filling out not only some of the papers he has already placed on the chart, but also numerous new ones he again grabs from the hotel notepad. Many of them go around the edges of the mat, and strings in various colors follow. When he has finally completed his work and stared at it for a while, he heads for the shower, and I use the opportunity to study the chart myself. New pieces of paper with the names o various unstable countries in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe are lined up below, with some more noteson the one titled Libya.
I swallow harshly, desperately thinking about how much to reveal about secrets that aren’t mine to tell.
It’s very much not what I wanted to talk about, but I guess it’s been gnawing at my subconscious all day. After all, it’s been little more than twenty-four hours since that groundbreaking event, and I haven’t really had the downtime to process it.
“And don’t you forget it!” She grinss and pokes me in the ribs. “Go take a shower, France made you smell bad.”
The discussion between him and the shopkeeper turns more and more heated, yet somehow, Sherlock manages to make his fake accent get stronger the louder he becomes, which tells me none of the heat on his side is real. He seems to convince the stallkeeper of whatever he’s trying to achieve eventually, and the man relents. He passes Sherlock a note wrapped up with a watch. Sherlock pays far more than any of the price tags says, so probably some sort of information bought. With a nod, Sherlock dispappears into the crowd, and I have trouble following him without breaking my camouflage.
“We’re a great team, I’ve always known that. Want to come?”
“The first of which was to underestimate you, it seems.”
“I do like the feisty ones. They fight back more.”
They do small talk and coffee for a while, Sherlock actually stooping to drink some himself. I settle into a corner to watch and wait as another dozen officers trickle in. Finally, when the last man has grabbed a chair, Niedermayr steps up to the front.
That is probably the only way I can force Sherlock to east a full meal – make it part of the new skillset he’s practicing. He probably knows that’s why I’m doing this, too, but he agrees anyways. Maybe he already has a wish in mind.
[what do you want?]
He scrambles up, obviously panicking.
Sherlock frowns.
I run a hand through my hair and grimace.
I nod and stay silent for a while. Finally, I ask:
“We both think he might be better off with someone who shares that protective streak, who knows what it’s like always having to save everyone. Someone who knows what it’s like to fight at that age, and won’t try to
He scrolls through something slowly, probably memorizing the information he’s reading.
I’ve thought a lot about how to phrase this.
“Zwei Falafelwraps zum Mitnehmen, bitte. Und ein Glas Tee für die Wartezeit.” [two falafel wraps to go, please. And a glass of tea while I wait.]
“Thanks, Harry. That really means a lot more than I could say.”
I can almost see things clicking into place in Sherlock’s head. He’s probably linking the story in with his own deductions, both today and before he met her, but his answer is most definitely not what I was expecting.
I find her curled up on the couch with one of her cats, reading. Her whole face brightens when she sees me, and she drops the book mid-sentence to jump up and grasp me into a long, tight hug. I relax into it involuntarily, finally realizing just how exhausted I am now. When she finally lets me go enough to look at my face, she asks:
“Sounds perfect. I do have the best sister in the world.”
“An old family heirloom Harry let me borrow. A way of staying hidden.”
When I awake, the sun is rising, which around this time of the year I’d guess to be maybe 7 or 7:30. The other half of the bed is empty, and for a moment I fear it was all a dream. But the desk lamp is on, and Sherlock is already hunkering over his case-chart. I sigh inwardly. Of course he didn’t sleep through the night. This is Sherlock Holmes on a case, and he would never let something as small as a nervous breakdown waste that much time. But when I climb out of bed and walk over to him, I’m surprised to find him greeting me with a smile and a kiss.
He glares at me a bit longer, but finally, he relents.
“You are one hell of a man, Sherlock Holmes. Don’t you ever doubt that.”
[I just want to forget she’s gone for a few hours. Please, mate. The beer just isn’t enough.]
“Oh, John! That poor boy!”, she exclaims, and once again proves how much she thinks of everyone else’s well-being first. “Help your sister for as long as she needs it, I will keep everything neat her for you.”
He frowns thoughtfully.
In the early hours of morning, after some hours of sleep in a real bed and some more tea, Harry reprograms the portkey I used yesterday to go back to its last location. I’m afraid of Sherlock becoming suspicious of any stumbling noise I might make while I land, but while he does glance over his shoulder for a moment, he obviously believes the sounds to come from the next room when he sees nothing. He turns back to his chart quickly.
Her colleague pulls out a drawer, and I use the noise it makes as cover to sneak up on the side Mycroft will very probably not pass to look at the body. The body that most definitely is not Sherlock Holmes, though it is wearing the exact same clothes Sherlock wore at the time of his death, down to the scarf Harry knitted for me to give him as a present our first Christmas. The body looks very much like Sherlock, but there are too many small differences. A look-alike, but not good enough to fool any of his friends or family – especially not a perceptive mastermind like Mycroft Holmes.
“Shit.”
I have one more stop to make on our way home, one that Sherlock does not yet know about. I have asked Hettie to recommend a jeweler who does custom work some days ago while Sherlock and Harry were busy preparing for Alexey’s arrival, and I would love to hear Sherlock’s deductions when I pick up the small box today. As he’s still invisible, he does not get to make them out loud, nor yet get to know whether they were anywhere near the truth.
“Diner’s almost ready. Go set the table, will you?”
No, it isn’t, indeed. I’m the one with the gun.
The answer is no, and it breaks my heart. Tears stream down my face as I follow them up the stairs, but I know I have to. If Sherlock and this boy can do this, I owe it to their sacrifice to at least stay and protect them in case something else happens.
It was good to see him again, though I didn’t quite feel comfortable sharing much about my current troubles. He figured out the obvious problem of my living situation regardless. Though he didn’t know the real reason why living outside the city scared me so much, he knew I’d want to stay here if possible in any way, and suggested finding a house-share. In hindsight, that’s where I made the biggest mistake I could have made – and possible the simultaneously best and most dangerous mistake of my life. My half-joke that nobody could survive living with me was supposed to refer to my physical and mental health, and Mike’s counter left me utterly flabbergasted. He had heard the same thing from someone else that day, and only ten minutes later, I met the most interesting man of my life. I met Sherlock Holmes.
“Thank you for what you said to Mycroft. It means a lot to hear that, both what you said and what he answered.”
“Make yourself at home. Mind the cats.”
“Gee, Mr. Holmes, well deduced! One could almost think you’re a genius, maybe even a detective!”
It doesn’t feel right to talk about the case here, not when we’re not alone in the bakery, so we keep working till noon, only interrupted by tea breaks every now and then. All the food around us seems to incite Sherlock’s appetite, and he actually eats what we place in front of him. Sherlock dons the cloak before Hettie’s son Adam relieves us at noon. We walk back to Harry’s place, Sherlock invisible for fear of anyone recognizing him, even in this guise. It would be all over the news by tonight, and there are too many who are paying close attention to anyone in my presence.
“What, three-way marriage?”, I grin, and he glares at me. “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.”
“The case we’re on… It’s bad”, I decide to start explaining my actions. “Human trafficking, prostitution, children in situations I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Stakes escalated, and Sherlock had a nervous breakdown some thirty hours ago. I was afraid of what he might do.”
“Janus Cars. I wish from you the same services you offered their special clients. The same quality of work you offered my former employer, Richard Brook.”
We’re in an interrogation room, and Sherlock is handcuffed to the table with both hands. Niedermayr is shouting at him, and Sherlock is shouting back just as angrily, which is never a good sign. I’d have wished this to end on a different note, but once again, Sherlock has managed to antagonize a police force he was supposed to be working with.
Either way, this time we take the metro to the very last stop instead of going on an exhausting bus trek, and again reach a business park on the outskirts of town. It’s as far away from Lake Geneva and the posh areas around it as you could possibly go without leaving the city. Sokolov probably would have fit right in in those parts of the city, and belatedly, I remember that note on Sherlock’s case-chart: “<50 miles from wealthy city”. Geneva is one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, with an unusually high number of foreigners living there, and so is Lausanne itself, hosting the IOC and other huge international organizations. Sherlock is probably betting on the theory that this role might be exactly the sort of client these houses expect.
“Grab this. Don’t let go, no matter what happens.”
I glare at him even more, digging for all the anger I felt when I confronted him about this before. My voice turns to ice, sounding ruthless enough to rival even Mycroft himself.
A moment later, the boy is lying on his belly, and Sherlock is above him. His trousers are around his ankles, but almost nothing is visible of either of them. Sherlock’s shirttails cover his ass, and his lanky frame makes sure that almost nothing is visible of the struggling boy. It looks bad, but from the side I can see none of it is real, that it’s just make-believe for the cameras, even more that the scene between Sherlock and Faduma a few days ago. Even thinking about Sherlock going as far for a case as this is going to look on camera would break me, would make me shoot him and any other adult in this place, no matter the consequences.
“What do you need to do?”, Harry asks finally, after granting both of us a break to eat some. Not “what do you want”, no – like any good soldier, she understands that some actions are pure necessity. I think for a moment.
I grinned at that.
He smiles.
After what might possibly be the most satisfying meal in my life, I catch her up on all that has happened, mostly sticking to the three situations with enemy contact and glossing over the rest. Harry is just as thrown as I was at the thought of how far Sherlock was willing to go at the last stop, and somehow, that gives me back some of my confidence.
“Just like the cloak. Go choose a cover identity, something inconspicuous. Someone I might now. I’ll pack this.”
“I made a promise when I took the name Watson. I promised that I’ll always protect you, and I’m extending that now that there’s four of us. Just because the paperwork doesn’t match who we were originally, doesn’t mean we’re not family.”
I’m deeply relieved when finally we reach Paris and I see Sherlock’s ridiculous sideburns as he fishes for the suitcase next to me. We have almost three hours of transfer time, if I remember the information on the laptop yesterday correctly, and I desperately need a bathroom break as well as some moving around to minimalize the risk of thrombosis after being cooped up for so long. It seems Sherlock has had similar thoughts, and we hit the station bathrooms together after he locks up the suitcase in the provided lockers.
“I need to find him. The ridiculous idiot is probably trying to break down Moriarty’s web solo, to keep everyone else safe. He’ll kill himself for real that way. I need to support him, preferably without either his brother or Moriarty’s henchmen finding out.”
Sherlock Holmes vs. The Invisibility Cloak.
I feel him nod against my chest and turn out the light. We will make this work.
“Oh! My brother is studying medicine! What field are you in?”
Sherlock nods solemly.
She ignores his switch in language, probably because she wants Sherlock to understand.
more Harry. Glad to read you like her - she and you'll have to wait until she meets Alexey, still, but today, she meets Sherlock Holmes for the first time, and that might prove interesting all on its own.
“Alright, let’s try this out around town, get you into some interesting situations to see how you manage. Please try to stay close to me and give me some sort of signal if there is any problem. First time always poses some difficulties. And wear your scarf, please!”
Sherlock Holmes killed himself in front of me yesterday, and everything rings false about it. I saw him jump, I saw his corpse, and I heard his voice talk to me clearly in his “suicide note” of a phone call. He told me it was all a lie, every single thing we survived together, every adventure and deduction. I don’t believe it. Then man I fell in love with more and more every day for two years, though he might never have made that deduction, was not a lie. I can think of dozens of deductions, dozens of experiments he made that do not support that theory.
In the wee hours of the morning, the case-chart is all sorted, and we’ve made progress on putting together a well-structured dossier with all the relevant information Mycroft might need to pass on to Interpol.
Harry and I only saw each other during the summer after that. I picked up boxing as my sport at school, thinking it would be a good match for the bully I had always been. Instead, I suddenly found myself in one team with people exactly like the everyone I had ever bullied. Kids like Harry, who had always been at the bad end of all the jokes and picked up boxing to finally defend themselves. My whole worldview crumbled and keeled over, and it forced me to look at myself and what I had done.
“Don’t worry, that wasn’t what I meant. I couldn’t go through with that, hell, even you almost couldn’t. But I can stage a ruckus at the front door long enough for you to sneak in wearing the cloak.”
I can’t help but be excited when he finally checks out of the hotel. Another city, another country, another adventure, always on the heels of Sherlock Holmes.
I groan at that.
[Sherlock? You mean Jacques?]
I can’t help but tease him.
“Thank you.”
I give her a mock salute and a grin, and her laughter follows me all the way to the bathroom.
“I feel like I hardly know you. Even I never bothered to learn this ridiculous language. Then what are we waiting for? Let me practice!”
“I would like you to join my team for a briefing tomorrow morning. This is the address for the department whose offices we are using here. Eight o’clock sharp. We would appreciate any additional information that might have not been in the files, but could potentially be of use, too.”
“I love you, John Watson. Do be careful about your secrets, I might take an interest when this is done.”
Because there’s never any room to hide unnoticed up in the bus, and those luggage compartments are damn uncomfortable. Also, some of the drivers drive like maniacs – I’m still bruised all over from being thrown around crossing the Alps.”
I want to punch him, I really do – and shoot the guards for the laughter they give him in reply.
It all started some weeks after I got out of the army officially, a few months after I got shot in Afghanistan. I was barely scraping by on my army pension, fearing very much that I’d either have to move in with my sister or leave London entirely. My sister had barely talked to me after I went through with army plans, even though she’d checked in periodically to make sure I was still alive and did not need to be rescued. She knew I was back, but I had refused to meet her. She thought I was angry because I’d got shot just like she prophesied when trying to thwart my army plans, but in reality, I just didn’t want her to know how badly my PTSD had gotten, in fear of triggering her own.
“How was France?”
We pack and plan till hours after darkness falls, and Harry instructs me in all the fine points of using portkeys. I have never used the travel method before, and am now equipped with a total of five bound to “home base” in Harry’s dining room, hidden both in my backpack and on my person, just in case. She shows me how to activate them, and explains how to take people with me that way, if I ever need to. Everyone traveling has to touch the key, and any luggage we take must be clasped to us tightly. There is no risk of losing body parts, nor of ending up at a wrong destination. Harry claims either might happen with other magical travel methods, but she warns me multiple times that there is a very real chance of leaving people or luggage behind when letting go too early. She made all of my portkeys in the shape of scarves, ropes, and loops of fabric, just in case, but the fear of making mistakes still haunts me.
He leads Sherlock into a small office that has far too many computers in it for my liking. I remain standing in the doorway just in case, to avoid any further mishaps.
They share a smile, and Sherlock nods.
The door is ripped open again, this time by the other guard. He scowls at me.
“John…”
He doesn’t believe nor trust me, I can feel it.
With that, he pulls me down the hall and up the stairs, Harry’s bright laughter echoing behind us. I’m guessing that delay he asked for when we first started kissing is over now.
She nodded thoughtfully.
“Twenty-four hours. I want to be in London when Mycroft finds out there’s a Watson involved in this case.”
“Don’t underestimate how much noise you make even sneaking, especially when there’s someone there who knows about it.”
When I finally sit outside on a bench near the shop, I hold out my hand with one of the wraps in it. I can feel Sherlock take it, but not see his hand, and it disappears a moment later. He is learning from his mistakes. When I hear the tinfoil rustle, I open my own. It is even better than I expected, with homemade yoghurt sauce and fresh mint leaves in what seems to be home-baked flatbread. Just as good as in Afghanistan. I studiously ignore Sherlock to concentrate on it, then throw the wrapping paper and foil into the bin next to me. A second wad just like it sails over me to land beside it. Seconds later, a toothpick appears on my lap, and I laugh.
The woman looks ready to smack him.
“Alright. Get Sherlock Holmes here. I want to talk to him.”
Sherlock smiles proudly.
“The sect was at war with a splinter group who wanted to kill or enslave every non-believer. I was forced to kill for the first time when I was eleven, killed the enemy leader when I was seventeen. After that, I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed John and ran.”
He is still adopting that heavy French accent he has used in this guise throughout. Niedermayr nods.
I hand him the cloak. With a smile like a kid in a candy shop, Sherlock steps in front of the large mirror. He drapes the cloak over his shoulders and marvels at how his head seems to float in the air. Then, he flips up the hood, finally raising the hem of the cloak up a bit to see how his feet become invisible.
“Well done. Anything you want to do next?”
When I close the door behind us and turn back to the room, I suddenly feel lips on mine. On pure instinct, I respond, but the kiss is over far too soon.
Harry considers that for a while.
“Thank you, Ms. Wagner”, Sherlock continues and accepts the proffered business card. “I do have a certain attachment to this case. I would dearly like to see it solved to the last detail. You have my number at the hotel, please do inform me if you find out anything new.”
I finally catch up with him in a side street almost five minutes later, barely on time before he rings a doorbell at a small side entrance between two shopfronts. It seems to lead to some apartments aboce, and Sherlock gives what is probably the pass phrase of the day, written on the note the shopkeeper gave him. Luckily, there is a door catcher that keeps the door open, and by the time Sherlock pulls it shut, I have snuck past him. We’re in a staircase that looks older than the house front, and I silently swear to myself. The old wooden stairs will creak badly, threatening my cover.
I smile at her so brightly I fear my head might fall off.
He turns in my arms.
“Thank you, too, Harriet Watson. That was great acting. I am glad I listened to John’s idea of asking you for this.”
Both Harry and I have been in Amsterdam before, back when I was still in University, and it helps us form a battle plan. I caught up with her and Mrs. Hudson at the bakery Harry’s been working at since we moved here, and I was right on time when Harry’s shapeshifting potion threatened to run out. We quickly changed clothes in the staff room, and I introduced her to Mrs. Hudson. Harry invited her to come and visit around the shop whenever she needs company. The two of them got along incredibly well, but that also meant it took us hours to get back home. We quickly decided that I will not travel with Sherlock for now. After staying up almost all of last night worrying, I need a good night’s sleep, and we know where he is going this time. I will travel to the center of Amsterdam by magical means tomorrow around noon, and track and stalk Sherlock from there.
“Real kisses once you’re yourself again”, he promises. “Good luck.”
The guards are waiting for him in the hallway. One of them makes what is probably a lewd remark judging by tone alone, and I almost regret that I don’t understand word of the answer Sherlock delivers with perfect haughtiness when it pulls shocked bursts of laughter from both of them. The guard’s answer is full of grudging appreciation, and that’s a truly rare thing. Usually, Sherlock’s remarks aren’t taken even half that way – far more likely, they tend to make people angry. I do want to know what it is he said.
“I want to kiss you before you put on that ridiculous thing again”, he mutters, and I laugh softly.
“Me, too, Mrs. Hudson. “You were right, you know – you were never our housekeeper, even though Sherlock sometimes treated you that way. You were our friend, and one of the most important people in Sherlock’s life.”
Harry’s house – not ours, not anymore, not since I left for Afghanistan – is located centrally enough that I make it to St. Bart’s on time easily. I know that Mycroft is just as perceptive as his younger brother, so I make a point of already hiding down in the morgue before he arrives. Sneaking in behind him would pose too great a risk at every door he passes through, even when invisible. Either Holmes brother would most definitely notice a door that pauses while swinging shut, and even more one that bounces back open afterwards. I cannot afford even the slightest bit of alarm in him.
It might take some weeks or so for me to start posting that one (I do have novels to work on, and numerous shorter non-fanfic works currently brewing - wrote one near-future urban fantasy short story between finishing this and starting on the sequel, and will probably need to get some more out before I really start working on this again), but I'd be glad if some of you would join me for the ride!
“Ich habe nichts mit Drogen zu tun, tut mir leid.“
He hesitates, but shakes his head.
“I never go armed”, Sherlock responds with a haughtiness that’s more Jegor Sokolov than Jacques Poirot. “My job is getting intel and evidence, not shooting people.”
He frowns once more, then nods.
Harry shakes her head.
“Nope… well, I told him, but he started it first…”
“Sit and calm down, you’re making me dizzy acting like a giggly teenager. I got ten minutes till I gotta leave. Start at the beginning.”
We’re in luck, as the guard opening the door is one Sherlock encountered on his previous visit, and he lets him in almost wordlessly. Sherlock pays him up front, and the guard picks up Alexey from the day room and leads them up the stairs. I stay behind, opening the front door a mere inch wide as soon as the hallway is empty. Then I hurry to follow.
Half an hour later, I am back in Augsburg, landing in the hotel hallway invisibly. Harry and I have argued back and forth for a while, trying to figure out how much is safe to tell Sherlock. He’s good with secrets, but he’s also deeply curious, and I fear he might try to figure out more if he even learns about the portkeys. Harry suddenly doesn’t care anymore, and eventually, I relent. It’s her secrets, her choice. I knock on Sherlock’s door, and when he sees no one upon opening, he smiles.
“Leider spricht Herr Poirot kein Deutsch, so dass wir in dieser Vorbesprechung zumeist auf Englisch zurückgreifen werden müssen. Gibt es jemanden, der dem nicht folgen kann?“
“Sarcasm?”
“I need a shower”, I groan, and it makes Sherlock burst into another fit of giggles.
“Do you think he can deal with that in the long run? He always acts like the great big sociopath who can do anything for a case, but… he’s so much more empathic than everyone thinks, and so tetchy about letting people touch him… I don’t want him to break on this.”
[please, mate. My son says you have the best drugs in the city, I need some.]
I can feel tears running down my neck where Sherlock’s face is buried, and I wrap both arms around him tightly. Sherlock Holmes, crying, again. That’s really happening too often lately.
“I overheard that phone call you made to Mycroft at the cemetery. I heard you tell him you needed transport there. You made a lot of mistakes, Sherlock. It was almost easy.”
“Same family name… I like the sound of that. John and Harriet, brother and sister… maybe even twins? No… I think I like that you’re older than me, I’ll keep that part. My big brother John. I have some favors from less than legal contacts I can pull in, they should be able to work it out. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
“If you want to see it that way. Now, I believe I asked whether I may kiss you.”
Some of you have probably seen I've filled in the total number of chapters, and deduced correctly: yes, I'm almost done writing this, and it did end up being a few chapters shorter than the 20-25 I estimated half-way through. Things just started to fall into place. But as these characters are refusing to let me go, I am already plotting a possible sequel, told from Mycroft's and Harry's perspective taking turns as I think those might be interesting to consider after what is still to happen here. Any thoughts on that, so far?
“This is amazing, John.”
The two of us are sitting in the dining room cutting up vegetables for dinner when the doorbell rings. Moments later, Harry calls out.
“Alright. Let’s get packing. I want to make sure both of you idiots survive this.”
“Of course, dear. I miss him, too, you know.”
“So what are you planning to do about the boy?”
“Das ist die Kugel, die der böse Mann auf dich und Sherlock geschossen hat. Sie soll dich immer daran erinnern, dass wir alle eine Familie sind und auf dich aufpassen.“
“What is that, and why are you carrying it with you instead of shooting it? Expecting an ugly sweater contest on this trip? You’d probably win, too.”
“Please do.”
He sits down on the bed, resting his back against the headboard. Spreading his legs wide, he gestures for Faduma to join him, again holding her from behind. Strangely, the fact that he is still fully dressed calms me. This seems to not be headed towards another disaster like the one in Lyon. Starting with small, innocent touches, he begins to caress her, and she leans into him like a cherished lover. They keep whispering, Sherlock’s head hidden in her hair, probably to hide the fact that he understands her and answers. Slowly, the touches intensify.
“Do you think I could spend the day upstairs alone? I would like to go through Sherlock’s things for a while, see if there’s something in there Alexey might enjoy, but I fear someone might see the lights and come visit.”
She looks at me with that scrutinizing expression again, then she nods.
As soon as he has a firm grip, I activate the portkey. A moment later, we’re in the store-room of the bakery, and Sherlock lands just as badly as I did on my first try. He crashes into some shelves, and a boxful of poppy seeds rains down on him.
Thoughtfully, I take another sip of tea.
“You have five minutes.”
“See to it that you do.”
From that first day, I was raised to believe that Harry was a freak and an abomination, and the right thing to do was to treat him that way. My parents mistreated him while spoiling me rotten, and I was rewarded again and again for treating him like my personal punching ball. Most of the other kids at school followed suit, and I never saw anything wrong about that – after all, that was exactly what my parents had shown me to be the normal way of life. Ever since I found out just how wrong that was, I cannot help but step in whenever I even hear the word “freak”.
Harry nods.
“You were inside without them noticing? How?”
“Thank you, John”, Sherlock says quietly. “That date was exactly what I needed after today.”
“What kind of means?”
I roll my eyes at him.
When I get up, Harry has made us a full English breakfast, as she always does when she’s nervous. I hardly manage a bite. Finally, I will go back into battle, and the thought exhilarates me. This time, I have no clue what is waiting for me, and no back-up. I am the back-up, even though the “main troops” has no idea I am there.
“Ms. Vasilyeva was one of the victims of a human trafficking ring Interpol uncovered this week. I really only took notice of her name before I passed on the file because it threw me that one of the star witnesses in such a case should be related to someone who worked on so many high-profile cases with my deceased brother. I’m sure you understand it is a strange coincidence.”
There’s only one person I know who’s been through that much at such a young age. Someone I’ve realized before is a lot like that kid, and more importantly, someone who’s complained about not having children before. Someone I vowed only last night to talk to more often, and who still doesn’t know what happened between Sherlock and me. I frown thoughtfully.
I stuff the piece of rope back into my pocket. Harry will turn it back into a portkey home when I next return, and I do still have a few spares. Very quietly, I walk over to the side of the desk Sherlock is hunkering over. He is still working on his chart from last night, which is now filled with dozens of papers from the notepad the hotel provides for its guests, most of them with only a few words written at the top and with lots of room for more notes once he figures out more information. There are a few strings connecting the papers with each other and the map, but those connections seem to be another thing Sherlock cannot yet guess at.
[Good evening. This is room 317, could we get a large pot of tea with two cups, please? Yes, 317, thank you. Good evening to you, as well.]
“English, please. Kriminalhauptkommissar Jakob Niedermayr, Interpol contact for the Bundespolizei in Munich. May I come in?“
Meanwhile, Harry found the girlfriend she had always been dreaming about. They had met in the muggle world, and Clara seemed to love her for who she was instead of only seeing “the boy who lived” as Harry exes had. I got a week of home leave when they finally got married, and again Harry offered to get me out. Get me away from being shot at, without repercussions, a nice job as a surgeon back home. I refused.
“You are an evil man, John Watson”, Sherlock whispers in my ear softly when she’s gone, and I grin broadly. The contents of my glass keep decreasing without me touching it, so Sherlock has obviously figured out how to use the straw. It was probably why he ordered a mixed drink, too. When the glass is empty, I decide the day has been long enough for both of us. Sherlock seems to agree, as he follows me quietly all the way back to the hotel. If I wouldn’t check on the scarf periodically, I wouldn’t even know he’s there.
“It does make a great disguise. We could make it semi-official when we go back to Amsterdam, I do need some identities to set him on so he won’t get suspicious, and I already have enough of them myself really.”
I give her a warm smile and a hug.
“Oh yes. The loyal assistant, desperately mourning his fallen idol, avoiding the public who doesn’t believe anymore, stubbornly refusing to admit they’re right… add in the rumors about us dating that kept flashing up… the perfect human tragedy. I like it.”
“Verdammter Verräter!” [Bloody traitor!], he bellows, and on instinct I step in front of Sherlock and the boy. I draw my own gun while making sure to block his line of aim. I’m not sure which one  of them he’s aiming at, but I’d do this for either one. I did swear to shoot this guard on our previous visit, and I don’t even hesitate. We both fire at the same time, and Alexey screams.
“And just who was it that came up with such ridiculous claims? I am just a small IT expert, I really wouldn’t know anything about fake IDs.”
Mycroft is getting rather suspicious, but the combined protective streak of TWO Watsons does not make things easy.
The building he finally struts towards looks to be of one family with the one in Lyon: small, unassuming, two stories and only one visible entryway. Just as difficult to break into as the last, and even with the same type of goon guarding it. This one, though, treats Sherlock with utmost respect and a lot of courtesy, very much unlike the reception he got in Lyon, so it seems that Sherlock has guessed exactly right on which role to play this time.
Suddenly, everything falls into place. The
I can’t help but smile at that, even If it’s a smile tainted with sadness.
“He was going to shoot you, or Alexey, maybe even both. I couldn’t let that happen. You’re both family now.”
He glances at the table, then shrugs.
“Mom?”, Sherlock asks when the door’s closed, and Harry smiles.
The way he botches the name has got to be on purpose.
“Any chance you have any other interesting heirlooms that might help?”
Afterwards, I hurry to follow as he struts down a street. He seems to know exactly where he’s going – he’s probably been to Paris multiple times before. I’ve never quite had the temptation, and I don’t speak a word of French. German was my language in school, and I got quite a bit of practice with that during the few months I was stationed with the NATO troops in Bergen in Germany shortly after I finished my doctorate, and then again on the few occasions we had to deal with the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan. Maybe it will give me a heads-up if this journey continues to one of the German-speaking countries next.
“Alright. Now, may I kiss you?”
Harry perks up immediately.
I narrow my eyes at him.
“Stay away”, I warn. “If you catch these smells, it might blow your cover.”
“Right.” Her sarcasm is palpable.
“So you broke cover.”
“Please, Sherlock. If we go back to the hotel, I can show you, I promise.”
The thought scared me, and we ended up talking about other problems instead. I told him about my newfound sexuality, about having a boyfriend and still being very much interested in women regardless, and Harry admitted that he’d rather have been born as a girl. She hadn’t even told her friends at school yet, and I still wonder how, despite all that had happened between us, I suddenly became the first person she dared to tell. Maybe it was because I was so far removed from her daily life, but suddenly it all came bursting out. That the worst part of being called “the boy who lived” wasn’t everyone’s expectation to save the wizarding world, but the boy part. That she had found a new family who seemed to love her, but that they were just as full of expectations as my own. That the library at her school actually carried old tomes with spells and potions for a complete sexchange, but that her new family would probably never let her use them. She was dating their youngest daughter and wanted to marry her just like they expected, but her girlfriend was very much not into women and found even the thought of having a girlfriend disgusting. Both the girlfriend and her family expected Harry to father half a dozen children and start a perfect family.
“Something like that. I’m part of the taskforce going in. My specialty is securing any computers and parts during the raid to make sure no evidence is lost.”
As the door closes, he asks for the woman’s name first in French, then in English, but she signals incomprehension either time. This does not bode well for gathering information. From the look of her, I’d guess her to be from Northeastern Africa, somewhere around Somalia, Eritrea, or maybe Ethiopia. She has that sort of look about her rather than further south. Apparently, Sherlock has made his own deductions, for he pulls her into his arms from behind. With his face hidden in her bushy hair, he quietly speaks to her in a soft language I feel I’ve never heard before. Definitely not the Arabic I’d have expected him to try next. I know he speaks quite a few languages, but I would have guessed them to only be languages with probable application in international context, not something so uncommon.
Sherlock grins at her.
“Bulletproof sweater, actually. I’ve been wearing them ever since the last time I got shot.”
Again I settle into a corner and wait for Sherlock to do something interesting. It takes hours, but finally he rises and slips back into his Djamil al Marad persona. The beard is back, too, and he wears the scarf when he leaves the room. That affords me enough time to both allow myself a bathroom break and grab some fruit from my backpack before I follow.
“Do you recognize this person, Mr. Holmes?”, the doctor asks. Mycroft nods.
“Es darf keiner wissen, dass ich hier bin”, I explain as soon as Sherlock shuts up for a second. “Ich passe auf Jacques auf wie du auf die anderen Kinder. Das geht besser, wenn mich keiner sieht.“
I smile sheepishly.
“I might know someone.”
The old lady behind the counter wraps up my order to go, and I sneak out as soon as she’s busy with the next customer, with the food packed in my backpack and the cloak draped securely over me, coffee in hand. The 3 line tram northward arrives mere minutes later, and I check on Sherlock’s location before every stop. A few stops before the last, I realize that there’s absolutely no chance this tram will go as far out of the city as Sherlock’s gone. I’ll have to find a bus or track him on foot. Getting out at the next stop, the tracker tells me it’s still more than two miles, though he’s already stopped moving. He must have taken a bus for that much of a lead. Of course, the bus northwest only goes twice an hour, and has only left ten minutes ago. I can probably manage a large part of the distance on foot in the time until the next one arrives.
He looks her up and down – the lithe form, black braid, brightly patterned cardigan covered by a dark red apron. He’s probably making dozens of deductions on the go.
He clings to me, sobbing, not even questioning my presence, and that alone tells me more about his state of mind than I would ever need. Sherlock Holmes does not switch off his glorious mind, not for anything, but now, he’s foregone all thinking. He sobs into my chest for a long time, clinging to my coat with both hands, and I pet his hand wordlessly. Finally, the racking sobs calm down, and he lets go enough to glance up at me.
He grins widely.
The cardigan in question was originally made for men, and it’s covered in a black and white all-over pattern of skulls and Scandinavian star motifs, with brightly colored flames around all the hems. It is also about two or three sizes too small for me, as I only notice when I pull it over my head and feel it cling like a second skin.
He hugs me again, then runs over to show Sherlock and explain. Harry looks at me questioningly, and I smile.
Again, we catch a bus, this time out of the city center. Sherlock seems to have looked up the address and route, as we have to transfer three times before we finally reach a somewhat rundown business park on the edge of the city. Yes, this is more what I expected from an investigation with Sherlock Holmes. Hunting through the seediest parts of town, saving him from getting shot at and possibly shooting back. Of course we’ve also seen the other extreme before, especially on the Irene Adler case, but this kind of case seems to always be more exciting for both of us.
“Sherlock sagt, Harry ist genauso deine Schwester wie sie meine Tante ist, und deswegen bist du jetzt mein Onkel. Und er auch, weil er dein Mann ist. Stimmt das?“
“I couldn’t bear the thought of losing you. Not so soon after getting you back, after finally telling you what I feel. I'm sorry, John. I guess I never realized just how hard my faked suicide would hit you. I only thought I had to keep you and the others save. I didn't realize it would be this hard.”
“Our colleagues in France contacted us and gave us your contact. There is a simultaneous raid on multiple suspected sites of human trafficking planned, and I was told we were not to go in without you.”
“Oui, c’est moi.”
“Might you by any chance have any relatives in Russia, Ms. Watson?”
Sherlock watches me put on the cloak and take it off again multiple times with utter amazement.
I don’t even hesitate before dropping my invisibility cloak and backpack. Harry said I would recognize when things are going too far and he needs me, and now, we’re definitely long past that point. I sink down beside him, not caring about my clothes getting wet, and pull him into my arms.
The boy keeps struggling, keeps what sounds like swearing in Russian, with occasional grunted replies from Sherlock. I can’t watch this, I have to turn away. I watch the door, hoping for someone to come inside whom I can shoot, but it is futile.I can still hear them, and my mind is filling in the images no matter how hard I try to stop it. I don’t want to know how long it takes until they are finally done. It is too long, any second of this is too long. Sherlock says something quietly, and the boy screams at him, though the anger in his voice doesn’t sound sincere. Sherlock smiles, then leaves the room.
Sherlock nods.
“Janus Cars, already solved that…”, he mumbles to himself, then: “boring… boring… obvious, boring… illegal arms trading, should probably stop that… boring… more going into hiding, boring… traditional terrorism, let Mycroft deal with that… boring, boring, boring… huh. Now that is interesting. All single mothers with one child, multiple nationalities…”
As soon as we’re inside our hotel room, I throw the invisibility cloak into a corner and find Sherlock suddenly clinging to me tightly. He is shaking badly.
“I’m so sorry, John”, she mumbles into my neck. “Whatever I can do to help you, I’m here.”
“The work needs you, too. We’ve seen that again today. I guess you were right, this only works as a three-way relationship. No more secrets of that magnitude from now on, I promise.”
Slowly, I keep sipping my tea.
I turn his face back to mine, needing him to see how serious I am about what I say next.
“Ach, bitte… Nur ein bisschen Gras… Meine Frau ist weg, einfach abgehauen…”
“I suddenly feel so inadequate”, she says softly. “Both of you have languages you can communicate with him in, and I… I basically dropped out of school at eleven, never got to learn a language, and the few words of Arabic I picked up at work are totally useless.”
Did he just… I shake my head in amazement, barely managing to stifle a laugh. Yes, it seems like in a spontaneous bout of malice, he paid them just as much as the whore herself for their role in this escapade, to make it look like this was exactly what he wanted when he came to this place. That is exactly the kind of messing with people’s minds that Sherlock enjoys, and it will provide reasonable doubt towards whether he was some sort of spy, covering his ass while ruining their day by making them feel used at the same time. They keep swearing madly, and finally disappear in a back room. As soon as the door closes, I open the front door silently and hurry after Sherlock, finally catching up with him at the bus stop. He glances around almost paranoidly until the bus finally arrives, probably hearing my footsteps and fearing that one of the guards is following him.
He smiles back.
“I think I can manage that. I’ve already eaten, but if lasagna is okay with you, I’ll heat it up again while you’re in the bathroom, and we can have tea after that while you tell me what ‘weird’ entails.”
“Looks like someone is turned on by your evil streak, JD. Do take this to your bedroom, will you?”
He seems to have guessed right, though, as the woman stiffen almost imperceptively, then answers just as softly in the same language. I catch what might be the name Faduma, as that is what Sherlock repeats, but the rest is utterly foreign to me.The way Sherlock glances around the room without moving his head makes me guess that she gave him some sort of warning about cameras somewhere in all that, and whatever he answers makes her almost smile.
“How did you find me in Amsterdam?”
Sherlock nods mechanically, but doesn’t make a move to bring either muffin or tea anywhere close to his mouth. I ignore it for now and sit down on the bed next to him. He stays silent for a long while, then finally, starts speaking monotonously. I diagnose another symptom of shock out of habit, but don’t interrupt him.
“So leicht sterbe ich nicht. Jemand muss doch auf Sherlock aufpassen, erinnerst du dich?“
He jumps up, almost knocking his teacup off the nightstand in his eagerness. I put a hand on his arm.
“I know you’ve always said you wanted to have some. Would you raise one that isn’t yours? Would you care?”
[I’m not dying that easily. Someone’s got to look after Sherlock, remember?]
We end up at a small internet café not far from the hotel, where “Djamil” checks routes to each of the other six locations on various methods of transportation. Finally, we take a bus to the main station, where he buys a ticket for a night train to Lausanne. I thank all the stars and gods available that it won’t be a bus this time. A train might not be all that much more comfortable, but at least I won’t need to cramp up in a luggage compartment – after all, trains don’t have those anymore.
I can almost see his mind starting to work again.
[This is the bullet the bad man shot at you and Sherlock. It’s to remind you that we’re all a family and will look after you.]
“I see the only thing I needed to do to get some consideration both for me and your transport’s demands was to kiss you”, I tease, and he chuckles darkly.
Sherlock looks up at me in surprise.
Mycroft frowns, then spots the black-and-white fur ball curled up in the chair. He sits down on the couch instead, and I take the seat next to him. A moment later, he jumps. Wordlessly, I reach under the couch, grabbing Remus by the front legs and pulling him out. The red tabby hisses at me.
“Uh-huh. So what did you do, John?”
Not for long, if I have any say in that. If there is any way I can without consequences to the children, I will shoot this man, even if it is the last thing I do.
I nod, then decide to finally breach the topic I came here for.
“Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit!”, he mutters. Obviously, this order of events was very much not how he expected the whole thing to go. He lies on the bed staring at the ceiling for a while, obviously trying to figure out a plan of action. Finally, he gets up with a sigh and starts digging through his suitcase, pulling out a large rolled-up puzzle mat and a pile of pins. He unrolls it on the desk and pins a small map of Europe in the middle, marking various spots on it, then writes down addresses and such on pieces of paper and pins them around it. Obviously, this is to become a portable version of the case-note wall he used at Baker Street to sort various clues, and he always took a long time working on that. As soon as Sherlock takes a bathroom break – even he has to listen to at least some of his “transport’s” needs -, I pull out the portkey from my coat pocket and activate it with a few quiet words. This might be the perfect chance to visit Harry and bring her up to date as to what is happening.
I walk over and sit on the armrest of her chair, petting her head awkwardly. She hides her face in my chest, and I glare at Mycroft angrily.
“I will make sure nobody dares disturb you”, she says resolutely. “Don’t you worry about that. Take all the time you need. All this must have been so dreadful for you.”
All throughout the next day, the scarf keeps moving, through stranger and stranger parts of London. Tracking and tracking again compulsively, often just minutes after I last checked, keeps my distracted throughout packing and moving. I’m sure Harry notices the way I keep touching my wrist, but she doesn’t say a word. Mrs. Hudson has ensured me that my things can stay here for a while, until I have decided whether to live here again, and that Mycroft has asked her to keep Sherlock’s things as they are, “in case any new information about his and Moriarty’s deaths comes up and the investigation needs something of Sherlock’s. If things hadn’t already been suspicious before, this would probably have triggered me to think for a while. As it is, it only strengthens my suspicions. I ask Mycroft for help with transport, even though I could probably fit the few boxes I take into a cab, just to make sure he knows I’m moving in with Harry for a while. Our alibi needs to be airtight, and more witnesses always help. The driver without a doubt reports back to him, and suddenly, I know just how to check whether my plans will work out. I make sure the driver’s listening when I say my goodbyes.
