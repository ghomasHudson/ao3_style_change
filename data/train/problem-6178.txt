This would explain Tarleton’s head, but this, this only raised more questions. Whose… Whose blood were they using for this? Most likely an Inhuman. Some poor, unfortunate soul. But were they still here?
It didn’t matter how often he told himself that, he couldn’t stop thinking the Pepper he knew and loved was gone, and this new Pepper — the one who was no longer his assistant, and also, no longer his girlfriend — was someone else. It wasn’t entirely untrue either. As time passed, people changed. Not that much time had passed, and people didn’t change that quickly.
He ran towards him. He couldn’t believe this. He couldn’t believe he was alive. After all these years, he was alive. Alive and captive. Monica was using Steve’s… She was using Steve’s blood. Steve’s blood was the source of the regenerative formula.
Everyone had encouraged him. They’d told him it was a good thing. He was interested and clearly, she was too. There was nothing to fear. For so long, he had been alone. And now, he didn’t have to be.
He found himself reading poetry more and more as the days passed. The scientists and the thinkers were much too considered with minutiae, but not the poets. They understood. Though we could explain many phenomena, we couldn’t explain it all. He knew he wouldn’t be around for the scientific breakthroughs that would change the world. If he were to return, he would hope the world would have progressed. He would hope some of the problems of the past would be no more. But he hoped there would still be love. He hoped there would still be joy.
Normally, he would’ve had his PA arrange the interview, but considering his PA was no longer in that position, and transitioning into a new role, so he’d have to do it himself.
He couldn’t concentrate. Tony had never had problems concentrating. He had never struggled with completing tasks. And yet, here he was. Struggling to complete tasks. He had considered taking a leave of absence the following term. Jarvis and Jim had supported his decision, but then thought better of it.
“I was worried. I didn’t see you in the house, but then I spotted you out here. Don’t worry, no one else took note. I just —”
The day Tony told Jim he’d be leaving, Jim had reached for him and pulled him into a hug. It reminded Tony of that hug in the desert long ago. He wouldn’t cry, not today.
The gyrosphere openly slowly, revealing itself as if it were a blooming rosebud. He could appreciate the beauty, but he was uneasy. Everything about this ship, about the regenerative formula, had him on edge.
He shook his head, unsure what overcame him. He hadn’t had these kinds of thoughts in some time. He was getting better. The edges around his vision were crisper. He was more aware. Aware of his own tendencies, he knew how to keep them in check.
Today was supposed to be a simple day. He’d be sorting through what was left in his office. He had sorted through most things with Pepper’s help. Today, he would be sorting through the various books, magazines, and journals that had lined the bookcases behind him. There was a vast array of information at his fingertips here. He preferred to read from the academics, the philosophers, and the poets themselves.
It was early summer, not long after my tenth birthday, when I met him. I met Stephanos. I didn’t know it then, but this was the best day of my life. And the memory of this day would serve me well in the years that would come to pass.
No one would believe him. No one would believe she belittled him. No one would believe she kept watch and tracked his every move.
Tony disconnected before Steve could respond. He got out of bed, got dressed, made the bed, and gathered his belongings. He called a cab while getting dressed, and a car was waiting for him when he walked out of the building. It was a quick trip to the Tower.
Jim had stood at the door, having overheard most of the conversation Tony had had with Jarvis. He was unsure what to say, or if the words he had would suffice. Jim had met both Howard and Maria and had seen them on numerous occasions. He was in as much shock as Tony was.
He pulled us apart and dragged us home. I was kicking and screaming, but it didn’t matter. The gods wouldn’t answer. This was foretold, I was sure of it.
One morning, Jan had made a snide remark about Tony missing yet another one of their debriefs. Steve replied, “I’m sure Stark has his reason.”
Steve put him to bed and held his hand until his breathing evened. He pushed his hair out of his face before walking out of the room. He returned with a glass of water and left it on the night table for Tony to reach.
His golden hair was like the rising sun. His azure eyes were so clear. I could imagine the nymphs playing in those waters.
He had read a few of the articles she had published before hiring her. She had flown in early and opted for a late night rather than an early morning. Tony didn’t mind. He didn’t sleep much anyway. He had always been a night owl, but now, he just didn’t sleep. Often staying up well into the night before crashing on the couch, or worse yet, the cot in his workshop.
Every time they stopped, Steve pulled out a sketchpad and drew the sky. Every sky, every night. And when, at last, they had made it to the Grand Canyon, Tony had asked about the sketchpad when he saw Steve pull up without it in hand.
I knew he was too good to be true. His presence illuminated everything in my life, and I wanted to keep the light on for as long as I could, but I knew I was playing with fire. And, of all people, I should’ve known those who played with fire, burned.
“Don’t… Don’t say sorry. Sorry isn’t going to bring him back, sorry isn’t going to cure an incurable brain tumor. Just… just get down here and read over these documents.
He cupped my cheek with one hand, turning my head to the side. His other palm raced up my thigh, settling on my hip, and griping it tight. He washed away all my other thoughts, leaving only him. He was the only thing I could feel.
Later that afternoon, Steve found himself in Tony’s office. Pepper was sitting on the desk sliding him documents.
Perhaps, Tony would welcome the conversation. He was often glad to hear Steve was interested in his life and the things he had to say.
He hadn’t never been materialistic before, but months in a cave, and days wandering the desert had cured him of whatever materialism had been present in his system. Sure, he was obsessive and protective of his armors, their designs, and the other technologies he had developed, but those were intellectual properties. Though the armors were tangible, it wasn’t their physicality he valued. It was they represented.
She was everything he could’ve wanted and more. Until the facade started to slip, until her true colors started to show. She was controlling and manipulative. He was ensnared.
Then, Steve opened his eyes. Tony hadn’t let himself dream of it. It was too far-fetched, and besides, it wouldn’t do his aching heart any good. But here he was, on a satellite orbiting the earth, face-to-face with a man he had thought long dead.
Steve had loved the desert. Growing up in New York and fighting fascists in Europe had left him with little chance to see the desert with his own eyes. He had never been that far west.
At night, long after we’d completed our ablutions, and the house settled into silence, we’d sneak away. We never hid in the same place and we never stayed out too late. As soon as we were alone, we’d waste no time discovering each other’s bodies and memorizing the sounds we made.
After tomorrow, he would never return. This office would be gutted. The walls stripped bare, then primed and painted for their new owner. He looked at the glass door that read
I paused. He had moved closer while I spoke. I could hear his slow breaths as he waited for me to say something, anything.
He and Pepper had discussed the changes she would make. The inscription on the glass door already bore her name. The serif typeface matched the name plate on the desk — her desk, he mentally corrected. He hadn’t been here in weeks, not since they had toasted to her promotion. She was shy and hesitant, but Tony assured her, she was the most qualified person for the job. The board wanted someone with her background, and they wanted someone who knew the company in-and-out, not wishing to spend time having to train a replacement, since Tony would be leaving too soon.
Steve fought off the last of the robots. They made it inside the escape pod only seconds before the ship exploded. They were both breathing heavy. They had managed to escape a fiery death, but they were far from clear. The explosion had taken with it their engines. They were sitting ducks.
He left before she could say anything. He leapt off the roof and onto the next one. He had felt exposed, and he couldn’t handle her rejection, though he was the one who had called it off.
His muscles were atrophied. He needed some time to compose himself. Tony kept an arm around him; supportive.
Then, he told me he was also named after his father. Was this our shared curse? Fathers who didn’t love us but whose names were bore.
I couldn't keep the surprise out of my voice. Stephanos couldn't read but if he could, I would've been the book he read the most.
He returned to his studies the next term. He wasn’t old enough to take over his father’s company, and the board of directors didn’t trust him enough, but he was hoping by the summer, to have shown his worth.
I turned away and started to stand. Before I had found my footing, he was at my side, faster than lightning.
He pulled away and I could feel the air seeping into the pores of my skin where, just moments ago, he had been. I was left dizzy: my blood elsewhere. My heart beat rapidly, erratically. I was left panting and I was glad to note, so was he.
We had since returned to the house after our day at the beach. I could still taste him, even after having dinner. His phantom lips brushed against mine. I would never forget how that felt. I would never forget that moment. The whole way home – up the hill, through the trees – we spoke about my mother.
Tony didn’t answer him. He was busy unhooking all the straps, and besides, there would be enough time to discuss these matters on the flight back.
Steve was concerned. It wasn’t like Tony to cry. He usually brushed off everything. Did something happen while he was at Gail and Bucky’s house?
I learned about the Trojan and Punic wars, about Caesar, about my namesake. I read of the bloodied battlefields on which they achieved fame and glory. I couldn't help but think of the gladiators in the arena. Fighting for glory.
For Tony, the rest of the week, was a blur. There were so many phone calls. Phone calls and meetings with lawyers. Everything was urgent; everything needed his immediate attention. Tony was tired of hearing briefcases opening and closing. He was tired of manila folders. He was tired of signing his name on page after page after page. The documents never ended.
Tony continued to support the bulk of his weight as they moved through the ship. They couldn’t linger. They needed to get out. Tony knew there were guards, he just hadn’t encountered them. Yet.
I could taste the salt of the sea in him. It was better than even the best wine or the best cheese. If I could’ve been a parasite, I would’ve lived off him, leaching off his warmth, for as long as he would let me.
Steve couldn’t imagine not wanting to hear what Tony had to say. He was always thinking aloud, sharing plans with Steve. He had plans for all sorts of wondrous things Steve wouldn’t have thought imaginable when he was younger, let alone possible, but Tony found a way. And that was the beauty of being around Tony, he had quickly learned.
Later, I had to watch him cry out and bleed and beg. I was seething, and I was numb. I was so many things, but most of all, I was a coward. I averted my gaze. I couldn’t watch as they tortured him for the crime of loving me.
Tony took another swig of his neglected drink. Pepper didn’t comment though she could smell the whiskey. He had promised he wouldn’t drink excessively, and she wanted to take him at his word.
He was trying to control his temper. He was pissed, but that wasn’t the caller’s fault. How were they supposed to know he was avoiding everyone?
They took one of Tony’s nondescript cars. It was an older black Audi. They stuffed their bags in the trunk, and kept Steve’s shield under wraps, nestled under their pillows and blankets. And then, they drove across the southwest.
He needed to work on his tendencies, needed to work on his coping mechanisms, but he was eager. Eager to see what lay beyond the edges of the atmosphere. He was eager to see what was beyond earth’s gravitational pull.
In a panic, he thought of what his mother would do in this situation. He was having a guest come over for dinner. This called for a home-cooked meal.
Tony looked down, at his slippers. They were bright red and complimented his robe. Steve had been thinking of untying it since he entered the room. He could do that sort of thing now, beyond not minding, Tony actively encouraged him.
He had spent most of the day with Gail and Bucky and was much too tired to talk to anyone else. Sometimes Jan would call to vent about Hank or entice him with phone sex. He wasn’t in the mood for either tonight.
He kept his voice calm and even. Tony was a little on edge, or rather, more so than usual. Though, that was easily explained by Greg’s unwanted presence. Steve was glad he missed him. Greg’s unannounced and unwelcome visits always left Tony in a sour mood. No one could blame him. Greg was a piece of work.
The only thing I could sense, and it was everything I had ever wanted it to be. He had never kissed me before, but I had always wanted it, and now I knew. And so, did he. I had dreamt of this moment both awake and asleep. Very rarely is life better than one’s dreams.
And again, Steve smiled. He smiled more around Tony in the last few minutes than in the weeks he had been away. Coming back was the best thing. He never wanted to leave.
He had wandered the desert, the moon his only companion. And seeing the moon, night after night, as he walked on bloodied and broken feet until Jim found him and he could rest his head against his shoulder, it kept him from going mad.
“Tony’s leaving you with the team, now you’re its benefactor, so these are your decisions to make,” she said.
And yes, this was true. I had noticed. I never would’ve commented on it, of course. I didn’t see in me what he saw, I just knew he loved me, and that was enough. But I wanted to be stronger, I wanted to be like the men I saw fighting in the Coliseum.
Steve felt miserable lying, but he felt even worse watching his best friend slowly deteriorate. For Bucky, the war was decades ago. For Steve, it was an empty void. Reminiscing ushered in other feelings, and neither one of them wanted to dwell on those.
They were both present at a conference. She was one of the students presenting her research. She was a few years older than him. She was quick-witted, charismatic, and beautiful. Of course, Tony was smitten. When she spoke, everyone turned to face her. She met his eyes and smiled, knowingly. They kept dancing around each other, for the rest of the conference.
Just as he finished, he heard the doorbell ring. He looked down. He was still wearing dress pants. He had taken off his suit jacket and had rolled up his sleeves but hadn’t bothered to change.
He let her go, surprisingly. Customarily, a woman didn’t return to her family, not even in times of grief. She belonged to her husband, my father.
He kissed me with such ferocity, but I returned the fervor. This had never occurred before, but it couldn’t have been anything but the Fates.
It was only after that he realized how warped his views were. She had seen a vulnerable young man, and she had taken advantage. He was hurting and insecure and she offered relief.
They were close to the escape pod when robots ambushed them. Steve fought them off as Tony flew ahead.
He missed working on his armor. Though the ship gave him much to do and much more to figure out, it wasn’t the same. He had been Iron Man for so long, and it had consumed so much of his time, he seldom knew what to do with himself, since time was all he had now.
I didn't know what I had expected. It was a Roman name, of course, but not one I had ever heard. And when he said it, he said it as if it were something he hadn’t practiced, as if that name no longer belonged to him. It no longer identified him.
Of course, it wasn’t his fault, and Tony would remind him again and again. There was nothing he could’ve done. There was no way to prevent this. He wouldn’t tell him, if the Avengers hadn’t been forced to disband, maybe they would’ve found him earlier. If they hadn’t been forced to go their separate ways, maybe they would’ve been able to put a stop to Monica’s plan much earlier.
She was hired to be his eyes and ears. She took the minutes during meetings. She responded to calls and emails. She sent missives. And she was great at her job; always attentive.
Tony hadn’t been able to find a suitable replacement. He couldn’t stop thinking he was replacing Pepper, which was absurd. He wasn’t replacing Pepper. They were still friends and she still worked for the company. He was just looking for a new assistant.
It had all felt surreal. From the moment he laid eyes on Kamala, when she and Bruce had found him, back in the desert. He had been sequestered in Golden Acres for years. After… After what had happened in the Bay, Bruce had been called before Congress. His testimony had been the last nail on the coffin. They had seized all his assets. The Tower was sold, the company liquidated, and the Avengers… Disassembled.
He had heard the door slide open and their soft footsteps approach. He relaxed. He knew who it was, would always know when it was her.
He had always enjoyed watching him work, especially when he worked with his hands. Steve had imagined what it would be like to have Tony’s total and complete attention, to have his hands roaming his body. He didn’t berate himself for those thoughts anymore. They were allowed. The future was his, and he wasn’t going to be trapped.
Mount Vesuvius, on Italy's Tyrrhenian coast, erupted on 24 August 79 C.E. burying Pompeii and its sister city, Herculaneum, named after the fabled Greek hero, in pyroclastic ash.
“It’s fine, darling. I can walk,” said Tony, as Steve offered his hand. He stood and started making his way to the bedroom before stumbling. Steve swooped in and carried him, despite Tony’s protests.
Of course, that was my mistake. Even an iron man could break. And I would, when Stephanos was sent away. We had been so cautious, so careful all the other times, but not this time.
Tony had hired Pepper as his Personal Assistant years ago. It had taken a long time to fill the position. He had been looking for someone capable, who was unafraid to call him out when necessary. Most of the qualified candidates he had interviewed were too eager. They were too eager to please and too eager to pacify. He wanted to work with someone who would challenge him. Someone who wouldn’t let him get talked into doing something he would come to regret.
He had been running his father’s company since he was twenty-one. His parents had died in a car crash. Tony would never forget the day, never forget hearing the news. He was in Massachusetts, still in Cambridge, when he had received the call. He fell to the floor, agony washed over him. The last time he had seen his parents, he had argued with his father. It was one of many, many arguments they had had repeatedly.
He smelled divine. Underneath the salt was a scent that was all him; his essence. I was so close to him, I could feel the heat emanating from his body. If he was the sun, I was a chariot gladly waiting to be devoured.
He ran up to Steve and wrapped his arms around his neck. He smiled brightly when Tony pressed kisses to his cheek.
It was a strange sensation, knowing he would depart from this planet, never to return. There were so many places he had never been, so many things he had never seen. He still had time to explore. To walk across the barren tundra, to scale the tallest mountains, and explore the deepest jungles.
Tony was standing on the balcony overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It was dark now. A few, sparse clouds were making their way across the sky. It was not the best night for stargazing. He found he preferred it that way, for in due time, he would be among the stars. He could gaze at them all he wanted then, but he would never be able to see the clouds again.
“Never doubted you, just needed to hear it for myself,” he said. Tony trusted Steve, and trusted his judgment. He needed closure, that was all.
They stood quietly contemplating the air around them. She knew he was lost in his thoughts and squeezed his hand. She was caught by surprise when he pulled her into a hug. He wrapped his arms around her and nestled in the nook of her neck, careful to make sure the drink in his hand didn’t spill down her back.
Bucky started coughing uncontrollably after dinner. Gail quickly went to his side, knowing exactly what to do. Steve offered them privacy. He cleared the table and took the dishes into the kitchen. Steve always helped his mother in the kitchen. He’d be able to listen to the radio peacefully while his mother assigned him various tasks.
It was his mantra. He told me, time and time again, "My father and his father before him were made of iron, and by virtue of being my son, so are you."
They were the color of the sea, and I drank them in. Neptune must’ve blessed him at birth with eyes as clear as the waters in which we swam. And the Tyrrhenian was at its warmest this time of year.
He walked through the opening, checking his gauntlets. The repulsors were out of commission. He was hoping he wouldn’t need them later. He was hoping the worst was behind him, and the rest of this mission would be easy.
Pepper had curated his art collection, and for as long as she was happy to do so, he continued collecting. Ultimately, it was her collection, not his, and he would be leaving it to her once he left. There was a note in the top drawer on which he had scrawled her name. In it, was a handwritten letter informing her of his decision, and the necessary paperwork he had signed.
He hadn’t told Ms. Potts then, and he’s unsure what difference it would’ve made, but Steve made a promise that day. He wouldn’t let Tony die alone and unloved.
They stood in companionable silence for some time. Tony finished the rest of his drink and set down his glass. He hoped he wouldn’t forget it when he went back into the house but would pick it up tomorrow if he forgot. He was watching the waves crash upon the shore and the clouds move across the sky. She was watching him and watching the other partygoers still inside.  After some more time she cleared her throat.
His hands, roughened from years of work, made their way down my chest. I kept my breathing still. He kept his eyes on me.
Kamala was on edge. She warned him of the storm. He was flying right through it, but there was little he could do. He had to trust his instincts.
He was leaning against the banister, enjoying the view offered by the parting clouds. Tony looked off into the distance. Before long, someone had joined him on the balcony.
“They said she was beautiful. They said her long waves danced when she moved like the leaves of a tree. They said her eyes were the bluest of blues and that I was lucky to have them. They said she was kind, wiser than she ought to be. Like the Sirens, her voice brought men to their knees. It brought my father to his,” I said.
She brushed it off. Surely, she knew he was uncomfortable and wanted to go and was gracious enough to allow him to leave on his own terms. He always appreciated that about her.
My tutor was most impressed. I knew enough to read all the old stories: the epics, the poems. And my young mind devoured them with ease.
He treasured people and places. He treasured the moments he spent with his loved ones. He treasured the memories of his mother, the good times with friends, the touch of long-lost lovers, and the camaraderie of his teammates. Those were the things that mattered most.
Steve couldn’t help but smile. He was happy to see Tony and happier still that Tony was glad to see him. He hadn’t realized how unsure he had been. This thing between them was nascent, and Steve hadn’t wanted to presume too much. He hadn’t wanted to think Tony would miss him as much as he had. Though now, of course, he knew that to be true.
“Jan, I have to let you go. I’m getting a call,” he said before disconnecting and answering the other call.
He left Jim a manila envelope on his dresser. Within was a handwritten letter as well as the deed to the house and the numerous car registrations. Tony would be millions of light-years away, where he wouldn’t have any use for these things. There would be no point holding onto things from a past life to which he could never go back even if he were to return to earth after their successful voyage. And he said as much in the letter.
Tony lived his life on the cutting-edge. His armor was a modern marvel. Itself, endlessly fascinating. Though Steve was much more interested in the pilot. He was madly, deeply in love with Tony. He wished he could tell him that. He wished he could reassure him. Let him know he wasn’t like his other partners. They had only been interested in his money, the comforts that money could afford, and his body. They didn’t care about his brain, and they didn’t care about the man.
My mother never returned from her trip. They were all buried in the ash. There was no pleading with the gods. And no sacrifice would bring her back.
The next few weeks were the longest of my life. My father watched our every move, but we had no reason to suspect he knew.
Steve turned to face her. He couldn’t read her expression. She got off the table and walked around the desk. She opened the bottom drawer and pulled a letter from within.
He thought back to those days, when they were still together. He would always love her, would always think fondly of their time together, but they weren’t compatible. They wanted different things in life. She wanted the kind of simplicity Tony couldn’t offer her without sacrificing a part of himself he wasn’t willing to shed. She ended things amicably.
The Coliseum opened the following year. My father attended the inaugural games. We went every year thereafter. He was a senator; it was expected. I don't know what drew me to them. Perhaps it was the cheering crowds or the look of triumph on the victors’ faces.
When he caught us, sitting by the river, hands intertwined, I wished I had been turned to ash. My whole body froze.
To him, my mother's death was the end. There was only despair in his heart. Her death ended love. Everything he loved, everything he would ever love went up in smoke with her. Her death might as well have been mine. I would’ve fared better dead and in the underworld.
He was older than he looked. His small, frail form concealed his true nature. His mother, herself a widow, had sold him into slavery. She was desperate and London was far from Rome. They promised her he'd have a better life. My father didn't care for children, but he saw something in Stephanos, something he didn't see in me. He was worthy.
I paused for a moment thinking of where we had left off, of the question he had asked. When I remember, I began to tell the tale.
It was late summer, my favorite time of year. And I was lying with my arms tucked under my head, relishing the last of the summer sun. It was particularly warm that day and I let the sun’s warmth envelop me.
He wasn’t vain enough to believe she was using him for his body. The sex was good. She preferred to control the situation, and Tony was happy to oblige. Seeing her please herself, knowing he had been the one to make her feel the way she did, it was more than enough validation. It had taken him some time to get used to the restraints she liked to use. He wasn’t allowed to seek his own pleasure. But it was fine, she was happy and satisfied, and that was more than enough.
He dropped his duffel bag and shield next to the sofa and kept his arms at his side. He was exhausted. He hadn’t had a full night’s sleep in days. And though he didn’t need as much sleep as others, he still needed his rest. On the flight back, he kept dozing off, but hadn’t wanted to sleep.
And I kissed him. I wrapped my arms around him and even though we were naked and wet, he was still so warm. He was my very own furnace.
On his down time — often in the middle of night, or what would be night for them back on earth — he’d meander through the halls until he found himself in the observatory. He had always been enamored with all that lay beyond earth’s atmosphere, but it was different here. All his concerns, they felt infinitesimal when he would look out the windows at the stars they’d past. Each of those starts containing all the building blocks of life. Each of those stars, with its own beginning and eventual end.
It was a long time before he could walk on the sand again. But that night, upon returning to the US, he looked up at the moon, and finally understood what the poets said. He finally understood why they sang her praises. He finally understood what drove humans to gaze upon her, waning and waxing.
I wanted to touch him, taste him, feel every inch of his skin. I wanted to feel his pleasure, wanted it to be my own. I can’t say how long we stood there as the water danced around us and the moon shone brightly, but I was home. I was at home in his arms and it didn’t matter.
He could go for a walk along the shore, slid off his shoes just before reaching the sand. If he walked into the sea, none would be the wiser.
Tony turned, watching the waves break just before reaching the shore. It was the only way to distinguish sea from sky.
The artificial gravity generators were failing, which was the last thing they needed. They were already racing against the clock, with the robots gaining on them.
He swerved, but it was hard to maneuver when he was going so fast. Lightning struck and it knocked out his power. He cried, frantically, for JARVIS. He needed him more than ever, but there was no answer. He was on his own.
It wasn’t real. On some level, it had been real, but not in the way Tony had thought. Not in the way he had wanted. She didn’t love him. She loved his ideas, she loved using his body, and she loved having him as an accessory.
Tony had wanted to believe the wonderful woman he had met months ago, the one who had swept him off his feet was still there, under the hard veneer. He wanted to believe she cared. He wanted to believe she had his best interests in mind, but he couldn’t.
Years later, I watched Stephanos, who still bore the scars from the night, enter the Coliseum to thunderous applause. He had a shield in hand, and he used it as an extension of his arm, and I fell in love all over again.
The news came rushing like a tidal wave. Steve had turned on the TV to see if he could catch the day’s weather. Running along the bar at the bottom, Steve read
The lights were off and there was a glass of water next to Steve’s watch and cellphone. They were on the edge of the night table closest to him. The glass of water was a force of habit. He used to wake up in a coughing fit, desperate for something to drink. Coughing fits were exceedingly rare these days, but he still poured himself a glass of water before going to bed. Though, most of the time, he wouldn’t drink it until morning.
I dressed his wounds and half carried him back to our bed. I didn’t know when I had started thinking of it as such, but I had. The pain was too much, he couldn’t sleep, and I didn’t know how to comfort him. I cried until dawn. And when they took him away, I collapsed on the floor.
We'd go about our business during the day. Stephanos had his duties around the house and I had my studies. As my personal servant, he spent much of that time in my company, and I made sure he had time to do as he pleased.
Tony admired her. He admired her bravery, and her dedication. But most of all, he admired her spirit. He knew Steve would too. Steve would love her. He’d say something outdated. “That kid, she has gumption,” or something of the sort.
I spent hours in study. My tutor, himself a slave, was a man from Greece. He told me of the places he had seen. His stories were so captivating. I could listen to him for hours. He taught me Greek and I learned it with relative ease.
She had been wonderful, and the first few months had been the best time of his life. But she had changed into someone unrecognizable. That woman didn’t love him, she didn’t care about. She only cared about what he could do for her. He didn’t miss her. She was manipulative, controlling, and an opportunist.
Tony was sitting in front of his computer. There were screens all around him. His S-shaped workstation made it easy to move around the vast, open room. It was modeled after his other workshops, both the one in Avengers Mansion and the one in Malibu. The vaulted ceiling gave the impression that the room was larger than it was since space was limited on the ship. There were computer monitors beeping and cables connecting various devices to one another. If Tony weren’t careful, he’d trip over a cord.
He had wanted a wife and a white picket fence. He had wanted children and a quiet life, but when he awoke in the future.
Before his arrival, I had never known happiness. My father was as distant. Existing in the same space didn’t necessitate closeness. My father was always near, but it didn’t matter. He was unreachable.
He awoke at dawn to start his day. The slaves had matters to attend to in the early morning hours and he couldn’t be late. He kissed me good morning just before walking out the door and I could swear he glowed. In haste, he left. We didn’t want anyone to suspect.
His pocket chimes, and at first, the sound doesn’t register for what it is. Then it chimes again and Steve realises, startled, that it’s his phone. Which… doesn’t really make sense. His phone doesn’t go off. He doesn’t have anyone who’d try and reach him. No one even has his number except SHIELD.
"Come to me, my sweet salvation," Tony intones, taking the cup, completely oblivious to the exchange that just occured. He takes a sip, and makes that
“Tony, wait,” Steve calls, and Tony turns back to look at him. Tony looks tired, Steve realises, worn out, and a little sad. And in that second Steve realises. Realises that maybe he’s not the only one standing here carrying a burden on his soul. Maybe he’s not the only one who’s unsure about being alone for the rest of the night. Steve steps closer, into Tony’s space, but Tony doesn’t pull away. In fact, he leans closer, until they’re all but breathing the same air. Before he can think better of it, Steve presses a soft, feather light kiss to Tony’s mouth, hardly more than a brush of their lips. He pulls back, and Tony blinks at him in surprise. For a terrifying instant, Steve thinks he’s misjudged everything – that Tony’s laser focus on Steve all evening, the way his smiles and laughs had been abundant, the way he’d grinned at Steve like Steve was the only person on the planet – but then he sees the slow smile spreading across Tony’s face, and suddenly Tony is kissing him back, snaking an arm around Steve’s waist to hold him close. Steve closes his eyes and welcomes the moment, committing everything about it to memory, the way he can feel Tony’s heat, the way Tony’s lips feel against his, the way they reluctantly pull back so they both can catch their breath. The way it feels to drop his head to Tony’s shoulder and let out a shaky breath as Tony’s fingers rub along the small of his back.
Well, obviously, he'd known he'd had a crush on Steve, because the guy is gorgeous, and he's funny and kind of a little shit when he wants to be, but this feeling in his chest… it's more than that. He actually
The good news is, he doesn't have to look far – judging from the outpouring of sentient slime creatures coming from one of the University buildings a few blocks away, and the group of terrified looking, safety goggle-sporting, grad-school-looking people trying in sludge-covered vain to stop the creatures, Tony's willing to bet they came from some kind of lab experiment gone wrong. It would be almost funny to watch, if it weren't for the fact that this whole fiasco has ruined his evening, and left way more clean up than he even wants to consider.
“You made a mistake, trying to double cross us,” a man dressed in black tactical pants and a jacket says blandly. “You could have just kept to our deal and we all could have gone home happy.”
"Great, actually, now that I've actually found someone to help watch Casey. Meet Natasha," he gestures to the redhead, and she breaks off her conversation with Clint in order to offer her hand to Steve.
Coulson doesn’t look remotely surprised, and he doesn’t try and argue. “Alright, I’ll see what I can come up with.”
Tony takes a deep breath, and then another, willing himself calm. "Okay. Right. You're right. He is in good hands."
"Even still, you could have seen that he was into you," Natasha tells him. "I saw it within minutes of meeting both of you. It was adorable, really."
He doesn't take the time to do that as much as he should, Tony decides. It's not like he's going to have a partner any time soon, but that doesn't mean he can't do a little something for himself from time to time.
Rhodey nods his head in agreement and says between fits of giggles, “No, but that doesn’t make it any less amazing.”
Tony looks up at him, and his lip trembles, his eyes well, and Steve can't stop himself – he's jerking forward and pulling Tony into his arms, holding him as tightly as he can.
"One person won't be enough," Strange interrupted. "If we're going to do this – it's going to be a pocket reality. Completely separate from ours, and it can't be tied to ours in any way. We can't just send Vision to an existing reality – Thanos already has the Reality stone, he'd be able to find you too easily. Especially if he finds Loki and gets his hands on the Space stone. We have to make an entire reality from scratch, and it's not enough to just send the two of you. If Thanos gets through us, if he
They were going to dinner after Tony’s meeting with the board. Tony had spent the entire time watching the minutes tick away until it was time to go, distracted and giddy with anticipation.
“Watch it!” The words are hissed in an all too familiar voice. Steve’s eyes widen and he turns to find the last person he expected to see here staring back at him.
"But you're trying. That's important. You fuck it up, you fix it, and if you don't know how, you ask for help. And if no one knows how, you figure it out together. You with me?"
Their whirlwind romance led to a marriage ceremony within eight months, and together they had started a company of their own – Stark Resilient.
undercover. Not really. You’re just going to be doing some investigating. And two, you’ve gotten better at hiding in plain sight. Besides, you’re a white male. You’ll blend right in with the regular clientele.”
"Barnes and I were questioning her," Natasha says, watching as Clint stands up from his bed and moves over to Bucky's side, helping him to his feet as well. There's no hesitation, no awkwardness between them.
. You and your 'super friends'. It's about time someone else got the glory, don't you think? Especially when you're the ones who tucked tail and ran. This would exonerate my dad, it would save the world, and it would make
The following day, Natasha sends him a text informing him that Tony is planning on picking Casey up from school that afternoon. Perfect. Time to put the plan into action. Right around the time that school is scheduled to let out, Bucky excuses himself from the shop and casually wanders next door. Not surprisingly, Tony is already there even though school doesn't technically let out for another ten minutes. Tony is nothing if not predictable when it comes to Casey. It's actually kind of adorable in a weird 'Tony' way. Bucky can see why Steve digs it so much.
Tony swallows his last mouthful of cannoli and takes a gulp of coffee. He would savour it, but he caught sight of the French press on Steve's night stand and he knows there's more where this came from.
"Tony got a phone call," Bucky says grimly between breaths. "They said not to call the police, and that they had Casey."
Steve's fingers trace soft lines along his shoulder, anchoring him, and comforting him. "Of course I am," Steve agrees. "But it doesn't make me want this any less. I want to be a parent with you, Tony. I want to give us that."
have walked away? Tony pauses, watches for a second as Steve charges, and swings, every strike seeming to fuel him even more. Of course Steve wouldn't walk away. He doesn't back down from a fight. He never has. Even when he loses everything, he still fights. Maybe that's why he still fights from his very core, because it's all that he has. Maybe that's the problem – for both of them. They don't know how to do anything else. It's been fight after fight, against enemies, against each other, until they've stripped down everything they have to nothing. They're both wounded animals, have been ever since day one. In pain, lashing out at a perceived threat in the name of protecting themselves from more pain, from rejection, from loss. He thinks about Steve's warm smile on a cool autumn day, bright and carefree in a way Tony's never seen it here in the real world. He thinks about Steve's laugh as they drive the open road. He thinks about Steve's warm body moving against his, and the feeling of
“You’ll live, sunshine,” Bucky says, patting Clint patronizingly on the head. Clint mutters, but he jogs across the room and takes his position. Tony snaps down the faceplate of the lighter model of the suit that he’d designed for practise purposes. The thrusters are less powerful and the repulsors won’t actually do any damage, but it’s enough that he can actually practise his manoeuvers along with the rest of the team without accidently breaking them. Or roasting them to cinders from the vented thrusters. Steve’s call is up on a projected screen where he can see the whole room, but Tony’s also got the audio feed routed through the helmet. It’s not that he’s sentimental, he’s just used to having Steve’s voice in his ear when he’s out in the field.
Steve watches from across the lobby, watches the way that Tony's face shifts from anxious, to apologetic, to a laugh – presumably at something Casey says to him. It's beautiful to watch. "Kid at home?" Fred asks.
"Okay, now that's just manipulative. But, also it sounds somewhat acceptable," Tony admits, against his better judgement. "And… I do feel a
notice when slick fingers start caressing his entrance, sliding over the furled skin. He moans, tries to relax. It really has been a while, so he has to work for it, but Steve's fingers, while large and blunt, are gentle.
Before Rhodey can chastise him, or convince him that he really should talk to Steve (he should, but god, he doesn't want to), the terminal that is running the search algorithm starts wildly beeping. Across the lab, Shuri lets out a whoop and races over to it.
"STEVE!" Tony screams, unleashing repulsor hell on the thing. It doesn't do a damn bit of good, so he swoops in to steal a spare clip from Bucky, and then unloads the entire thing right into what passes for a head. The thing groans as the parts of it that Tony had shot start to dissolve, and it kind of rolls over onto its side. It's not much of a difference, but it’s enough. Tony drops down to the street beside it, and reaches half under, half through the slime until his hands feel a solid body. He pulls, not caring about the way that the goop is seeping into the joints of the suit – that's his Steve in there. Sam hovers above him, and unleashes another few rounds into the thing. It's enough to convince it to let Steve go, and with a final grunt, Tony is able to drag Steve free.
"He's just at the end of the hall, Pepper, but he's still unconscious," Rhodey says, sounding breathless as he tries to keep up with her.
He’s an idiot. They’re both idiots. Each of them pushing the other away to protect themselves because they wanted something they thought they couldn’t have.
From there, it's just a matter of time before they wear the slime king down, and Steve and Tony move to talk to the first responders and the police that have shown up at some point, while the others do one last sweep to make sure that they’ve caught all the stragglers. It’s definitely not the evening Tony had planned, but also definitely not the worst date he's been on, so maybe he can count that as a win.
"You're the best. And hey, can you bring us clean clothes? Jeans got pretty soaked in the snow and I dunno if they'll dry by morning."
"Ah!" Steve cries, and it's not a sexy noise, not really, so Tony rears back, hands up defensively, not sure what he's done wrong but knowing it's
," Tony said, stepping right into Steve's space and jabbing a finger into his hard chest, right in the middle of the black-painted star there. "You're the one who always told me we needed a plan, we needed to think about our next move, and you're turning into the guy who punches first and asks questions later? Fuck you, Steve. As far as the government is concerned, you're a war criminal. You don't
"Daddy! Daddy! We saw a duck, and a doggy, and goats, and I went so high on the swings I almost touched the
"Light of my life," Tony says in reply, blushing a little even as he says it. "The coffee, I mean." Clint wants to strangle them both.
"Fine, fine. I won't fight. I'll give it a shot. But," he stands from the table and grabs the cup and his bag. "If the coffee in Manhattan isn't as good as it is here, I will bury you in a mountain of legal paperwork so deep, you will never again see the light of day."
' is left unsaid, but it lingers in the air. It makes Bucky's chest ache a little to see Steve so down on himself. They all struggle with it still – they're a bunch of used up soldiers with a laundry list of issues and traumas between them. Sometimes it's impossible not to get down on themselves. But that's why they have each other, as frustrated as Bucky currently is with Steve's dumb ass. Bucky slides off the desk and wraps his arms around Steve, pulling him against his chest.
"You think he knows where it is?" Bucky asks Natasha, his voice low but not so quiet Hammer can't hear.
Casey is... he's amazing. There's no other way that Steve can really describe it. He adores that child, with his messy black-brown hair and his dark eyes that shine with curiosity and intelligence. On the cool autumn days, Casey drinks his hot chocolate and nibbles on a cookie. Casey thinks Clint makes the
The bad news is, the biggest creature yet, King Slime Lord himself, is slowly but surely making his way through The Village, picking up all the little baby slimelings and adding them to his overwhelming mass.
Rhodey shrugs a shoulder. "Can't say for sure, I think they have a few things to talk over when the dust settles. But it looks like they'll still be together. Like they still are."
Natasha raised one lightened eyebrow. "I think Thanos might be more than willing to take that trade, if you ask him nice. You might wanna try swearing on something a little more valuable to him."
The rest of them are sitting up now, too. Rhodey next to Tony, and Sam across the room beside Steve. Tony still can't bring himself to look at Steve's bed, or even in that general direction. He can't risk that eye contact.
He showers first, and takes his time doing it. The battle had been long, and he probably should have done this earlier. He'd used a wet towel, hours ago, to get the worst of the blood and gore off of him while he'd been at Tony's bedside, and he'd stripped out of his uniform and into some sweatpants and a T-shirt that someone had brought him, but he hadn't had a true shower.
Steve moves to stand, but the moment he puts his weight on his right leg, his knee screams with pain and gives out. He collapses, barely managing to brace himself against the car to keep from completely ending up in the snow again.
Steve stands, keeping his back straight. Her eyes light around the room, barely glancing at him before they catch on Tony's prone form, his pale skin. The heart monitor is still beeping quietly in the background, and the ventilator is still gently pumping air in and out of Tony's lungs.
who she is. Natasha Romanoff, she grew up in New England, bounced from foster home to foster home and some of them were good, but some of them were – she left young, joined the army, was in black ops – she learned the ballet – no, she doesn't dance the ballet, why does she think she knows ballet? – SHIELD brought her in – who is SHIELD? – but where is Clint? He was here, and now he's not, and she's got Bucky here but where is Clint? And Casey, Where is Casey?
to get this nanny situation sorted out, Casey will be out of school for the summer in less than two months.
And, frankly, maybe a little bit of self care – he snickers to himself – would help with all the unresolved, one-sided sexual frustration he feels whenever he's around Steve.
There's only one place he'd be going – either he's gone to get to Casey before Steve can, or he's running away.
Now at least someone is speaking a language he can understand, and giving him something to do. "Shuri, we need to borrow your lab, and also your brain," Tony tells her.
"Sorry we forgot to tell you, kind of," Bucky says, hugging Steve a little tighter than usual. Clint has always been family, ever since they'd been overseas, and that clearly hadn't changed since they'd been home. But him being with Bucky
"Thanks," Tony says, giving Rhodey as meaningful a look as he can. "I mean that. Thank you, Rhodey."
Tony is sitting on the edge of a chair in the living room, the first room in the penthouse suite inside the door. He looks gaunt, white, and sick. His eyes are rimmed with red, wet with unshed tears.
." Tony's eyes pop wide, and he puts his hands up immediately in a placating gesture, shaking his head forcefully. "No! No, no, no way, that's not – fuck, no, sorry, that's
But as soon as Tony arrives at the shop to pick him up – coffee, after all – all of the anxiety fades away, and the drive upstate is wonderful. It's a bright, crisp, early December day, and while they spend most of the drive talking, they also enjoy a few quiet moments that are somehow still comfortable. Steve finds himself thinking how
Steve feels like the floor is falling out from under him, like the whole world is turning upside down even as his brain is kicking into high tactical gear.
Steve would really like to make it out of this without a body count. Tony, it seems, agrees. And neither of them want to risk the HYDRA team making a getaway. Wordlessly, they enter into the fray, heedless of the fact that they’re both unarmed, and still very, very naked. In the far distance outside, Steve can hear sirens approaching, so really they only need to find a way to hold their own a few minutes until backup arrives. But a lot can happen in a few minutes.
Then he's in a dark hallway, looking around frantically, and before he can figure out where he needs to go, someone is on him. He feels a fist connect with his jaw, hard, but he doesn't care because that means he's
. He should have seen it when Tony had brought Rhodey in for coffee that day, because Rhodey's a good looking guy and
Steve groans above him, hips shifting restlessly as Tony dips his tongue into Steve's foreskin, lapping at the bead of precome that it inspires. He wraps his hand around the base, brushes his wrist against Steve's sac.
"Because it's not going to be enough," Strange replied. "If Thanos makes it here, then having the mind stone and the time stone on different ends of the earth won't even be enough. In order to protect them, I'll need more resources."
was safe from them. He’d managed to duck out from a grilling by Bucky and Sam when Clint walked in with Logan following a few steps behind, looking surlier than usual. Probably that meant that Tony should stay and check in to see what was going on with Wolverine and the rest of Xavier’s team, but self preservation won out.
It's not accusatory, or even teasing. If Tony let himself analyze it, he might even hear a note of pride in Rhodey's tone.
Rhodes makes a frustrated sound on the other end of the line. "Dammit, Tony, you know we had a meeting with the assistant secretary of defense today."
"Didn't you just say you drink a lot of coffee?" Rogers' face is starting to switch from the angry self-righteousness of earlier to mild amusement.
"Why are we back?" Clint croaks from across the room, looking dazed. He glances at Tony, but then his eyes track across the room to Bucky, who's staring right back at him.
Once they've got each other stripped down to nothing more than their underwear – and Tony is proud to say he's wearing normal underwear today, with his ass covered and everything – Steve presses him down to the mattress and hovers over him, his erection grinding lightly into Tony's thigh as they kiss. Steve's own thigh is brushing against Tony's erection, and it's maddeningly light.
"Nothing, just, there was a neat sounding bistro I wanted to take you to for a late-lunch-slash-early-dinner before we headed out. My guy recommended it to me."
"Don't sweat it," Tony says, brushing off the praise. "I like y – doing stuff for you. For the shop, I mean."
It takes them to T'Challa's palace, to a large room scattered with people – including Bruce, the king himself, and Shuri.
Steve had also read all about the tumultuous last few years that SI had had at the hands of its namesake. Howard had died a long time ago, he’d learned. But his son, Tony, had risen. He’d taken the company to new heights, and then, after going missing in the desert for three months, had re-emerged and completely changed the direction of the business. And he’d also donned a flying suit of armour and became a superhero.
"You bet, kiddo," she winks, standing up and heading back toward the front door. "Have a good evening, Mr. Stark."
"Steve!" Casey hollers, when he catches sight of Steve in the doorway, and it's enough to distract the guy holding onto him, and out of reflex the goon pulls the gun away from Casey's head, aims it toward Steve in the doorway.
The next message is a photo of a terrible, low quality Iron Man action figure knockoff dressed in a pink tutu. Steve is still staring at the picture when another message comes in:
If Casey is the most important thing in Tony's world, Stark Resilient comes in second. Ru would want him to make sure it succeeds in all the things she'd wanted for it. For
"Sam, huh? You're the guy from the VA office Steve talks about, right? Nice to meet you, Steve's got nothing but good things to say about you, and what you're doing with the employment placement is just great," Tony says, shaking Sam's hand too fast, talking a mile a minute.
"If he thought something had happened to you?" Steve murmurs. "I think he might go with anyone. He loves you as much as you love him, Tony."
“Well, do you want to start by talking about why you’re stealing all my sheets?” Steve sat perched on the edge of his bed, watching with amusement as Tony plopped himself on the floor and started tying corners of the sheets together, weaving them into a makeshift rope.
But not as much time as he'd hope. The swarm is relentless, and they've all already been fighting at maximum capacity for a while. There's only so far they can push themselves before the stamina gives out, and they're getting dangerously close to that point.
This is it, this is the moment, the split second. They have to act now, or they're done. Tony looks wildly around, but everyone else is fighting desperately against the swarm. Without thinking, Tony charges towards the crippled Thanos, and grabs at the gauntlet. Thanos yells in rage, and tries to fight him.
“That’s Dummy,” Tony says, smiling in spite of himself at his bot’s joyous welcoming back of his friend. “Beside you on the table, Cap. There’s a little ball. Toss it, would you?”
"It's still May," Bruce says, and Tony blinks at him. Bruce gives him an apologetic glance even as he hands out bottles of water for each of them. "You've been gone a couple of weeks."
"What if we called the Guardians back," Tony tried. "They could take him with them, get him away from here."
Steve swallows hard, and for a moment is glad that he can't see Tony's face. He really hopes that he's not overstepping here. But, instinctively, it feels okay.
"They're mine!" Clint and Bucky both call dibs, and Tony watches two volleys of fire from two separate directions, leaving the alley in a slime-free explosion of colour. Clint and Bucky are bickering over whose point that was – apparently they'd started keeping score while Tony had been off playing mentor – and he's distracted enough that he misses what's happening in the middle of the street until he hears Sam yell,
The HYDRA agent slowly turns his gaze around the room until it settles on Steve and Tony, and his eyes narrow sharply. An impossibly long moment of tension hangs in the air. Beside him, Steve feels Tony’s muscles tighten, ready to spring into action. From the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony nodding ever so slightly at him.
They'd agreed the kidnapper would probably keep him close, even if they weren't going to bring him to the meeting with Tony. Steve's counting on the fact that whoever it is, they aren't going to be expecting Tony to come with a team of well-trained special ops veterans.
Steve wants to wish him luck, but the words die in his throat. They're all silent for a few moments.
They lapse back into a comfortable silence, and Steve thinks that maybe they'll both actually manage to sleep, when Tony speaks up again. "My turn to ask a question."
"It's not your fault, Steve," she says, and her voice is soft. He knows she means more than just taking Tony to a different reality.
"I'm saying, the first time we met, you dug your heels in, and you were very outspoken about your beliefs. You have a real strength of conviction," Tony tells him. "That's what I mean by 'always Steve'. And okay, maybe you're a bit scrappy, too, but hey, you make it look good."
As they stumble the last few yards up to the door, Steve glances behind them, and he can hardly even see the tracks they've left in the snow, it's coming down so hard, and blowing around so much. Steve lets Tony lead him inside, and they are immediately greeted by a "What the hell are you boys doing out there? Jesus, get in here and close the door!"
“He is reading about himself. He asked me for relevant information about Steven Grant Rogers, and Captain America,” JARVIS informs him.
His shirt hangs just over his hips, but when Tony turns slightly to slide into the bed, Steve realizes what the problem is.
“You mean, if you gave Tony some space,” she corrects. Steve doesn’t say anything, he didn’t have to. “Come on Steve, don’t you think you’re overreacting a little?”
For weeks, he’s been eating just because he has to, not really taking an interest in it beyond caloric and nutritional need. Before that it had been rations, and whatever else they could cobble together in the field. This is the first meal he’s had in longer than he remembers that he’s
Steve starts thrusting up into Tony's body, and Tony braces himself on his knees, opening himself up wider. Steve picks up the pace, fucking up into him roughly.
One guy left, but instead of coming for Steve where he's vulnerable and prone on the floor, the guy retreats, backs off and runs down the corridor.
The only way he manages to get through rest of the day without it feeling like seven eternities is by throwing himself into the energy project work for a few hours to make sure the information he's handing the prospective partner tomorrow is polished, and after that he spends some time playing around with DUM-E and Company, who all seem just as excited as he is that Steve is coming back.
"I'd like to talk to you about your new coffee shop on East 67th," Tony says, trying to put as much gravitas in his tone as possible.
"Hey, what? No. You have nothing to be sorry for, Steve. You can't control how your brain responds to triggers. And we'd just crashed a car – which I should really be apologizing for. Not exactly a non-stressful situation."
He's loathe to admit it, as always, but Bucky had been right. Steve's feelings for Tony go deep – from before the Haven, before the Sokovia Accords.
make it better. Hyper-protective helicopter parents are among the most irrational creatures on the planet. You're lucky he didn't burn your building to the ground or something."
Fred excuses himself, leaving Steve alone in the lobby, save for the soft side of Tony's conversation he can hear drifting through the quiet space. Tony is still talking, holding the phone out in front of himself a few minutes later when he makes his way back across the lobby, and perches himself on the arm of Steve's chair.
"Right then," Tony continues. "You were trying to innovate and learn. First thing you did right. The second thing you did right, is that when you fucked up, you tried to fix it."
"I'm just going to call Rhodey and see where he's at. He's gonna get us home. And I'll see how the tow truck is coming."
coffee," Steve replies shortly. "I gave him some while we were negotiating, and he seemed to like it."
"I'll pay attention, I promise," Tony says, straightening his spine. He really should be paying attention. He loves the fact that getting busier at Resilient means that it's necessary to have regular meetings with Rhodey. It's a great excuse to have daily BFF chats, and he doesn't want to jeopardize that.
"I checked with the zoning office, that's a residential commercial zone," Rogers says, brow furrowed. "I didn't have any trouble with my permits."
Clint is dozing in the next bed roll, full of painkillers, and Bucky is sitting beside him, one hand resting comfortingly on Clint's thigh. Steve still can't get over how easily they seem to have fallen into the relationship they'd found in the Haven.
Three hours later Steve finds himself sitting at a dark wood table by himself., eyes scanning the busy club as he tries to look inconspicuous. It is a nice place - upscale decor, classy and chic in that modern way. Tucked away in one corner is a VIP area, and nearby is a doorway with a security guard standing in front of it. Steve knows from the plans that it leads back to a private area. Already, he’s seen several of the dancers lead clients back there. Of course, on paper there is no sex being traded, of course not, that would be illegal. But, if certain clients are prepared to tip well in order to arrange for a more… intimate experience, well, now, that’s different.. And off the record.
It’s the sound of raised voices that pulls Steve’s attention away from the book he’s absently reading. His tablet is sitting discarded on the table beside him from when he had it out earlier. He loves that thing – all the news, the journal articles, the unrestricted (but not unmonitored, he’s not an idiot and SHIELD is a spy agency, after all) access to all the information he could possibly want at his fingertips. He’s pretty sure he’s acquired more factual knowledge in the short time he’s been awake at SHIELD than he did his entire time in school growing up. His tablet is great. But when it comes to reading fiction, he wants the actual book his hands. The feeling of paper under his fingers. It feels comfortable, familiar – a feeling which is in pretty short supply these days.
"Sam, Bucky, stay on it. Make sure you herd it into the perimeter," Steve orders. "I don't want it getting any bright ideas and wandering off somewhere we can't coral it. Clint, give them support from above. Everyone else, get ready to surround it, and we'll bring it down." Tony's heart skips a beat. His boyfriend is pretty damned sexy when he takes charge and gets all tactical.
Tony waves his hand out again with a flick of his wrist. "I won't shake your hand because oven grease, but good to meet you. I'll enjoy putting a face to the name later." His voice is echoing a little bit in the big empty oven.
Steve doesn’t have a chance to answer as a raised voice from the far side of the room catches his attention.
Tony kneels down to catch him, wrapping his arms tightly around his child and breathing in the smell of him.
"Right," Tony says, not sure what that has to do with anything. "He's my best friend. But we're not – we're not an
"You know, tub's pretty big, I can always just sleep in that," Steve says lightly, though Tony wonders how much of a joke it really is. But, honestly, it's a terrible suggestion, and as much as Tony isn't sure how he's going to to make it through the night with a practically naked Steve laying next to him, he's not about to resort to anyone sleeping in a bathtub.
"Is everything okay Mr. Stark?" Julie says, snapping his thoughts back to the moment. Casey's gone off to play on the little playground set up in the wide, fenced off yard, laughing as he flings himself down the slide. Tony smiles. It's pretty hard to be upset with Casey around. He turns his attention back to the teacher.
“That’s a sign that you’re healing, a good sign.” Tony could feel himself growing more excited, more hopeful for the first time in days.
“-pining away like idiots. I know. Me, too.” He stepped back from the window long enough to stoop and place a gentle kiss to Steve’s mouth. “I had fun, too. And I have to say, I’m looking forward to a repeat. But I have been getting the third degree from everyone, all day. Everyone, Steve.” He moved back to the window and dropped the chain of sheets outside. The end reached to within six feet of the ground. Good enough. Behind him, Steve sighed.
"Hey!" Tony says, but there's no heat behind it. He's grown to be comfortable with his level of hovering when it comes to Casey. "I think I've grown as a person," he continues. "I found him a nanny that I leave him alone with, didn't I?"
Suddenly, Steve can't even feel his knee anymore, he's too busy feeling his heart in his throat, feeling the rush of adrenaline that he needs to burst forward, running down the hall and into that room.
Without thinking, Steve springs back from Tony and scrambles to jump out of bed, stammering apologies. His foot hits the floor, and he moves to push himself to standing – only to have his injured knee collapse under him. What a fucking morning, and he's been awake less than 10 seconds. He dares to look up from where he's laying on his back on the floor, one leg still on the bed tangled up in the blankets. For a second, Tony stares at him, wide eyed. Then promptly bursts into laughter. Steve feels his entire face heat up, and he wishes a hole would just open up in the floor and swallow him whole so he didn't have to face the embarrassment.
"I am. We're nearly out of the new light roast, it's been way more popular than I expected. How long has this been going on?"
going to go right through us, and then through everything else in his path," Steve said, this time his voice is flat. Like he's tired of fighting – tired of fighting the world, the apocalypse, even tired of fighting Tony.
Tony glances at his watch, and his eyes widen. "Shit, I have to run. I'll see you later. Thanks for the coffee!" He waves and turns to leave in a hurry, dashing down the street toward his office. Steve watches after him until he's out of sight. When he finally turns away, Sandi is staring at him with amusement.
Tony hadn't quite been able to bring himself to call Steve on that stupid fucking flip phone he'd sent. Tony, of course, kept it charged and on his person at all times, because he wasn't an idiot. If he was ever going to need to call Steve for help – and god, he hated that he'd one day possibly have to call Steve for help – he needed to be ready at a moment's notice. The apocalypse wasn't going to give him a chance to find a wall outlet to charge the phone so he could call reinforcements.
It's Friday afternoon, and he's given Natasha the afternoon off. Of course, he has no intentions of getting through the afternoon without a coffee, so on their way to the park, Tony had decided they'd stop in at Brewed Awakening. Plus it would be a nice treat for Casey, who hasn't been inside yet.
Sometime later, once the game of fetch winds down, Tony glances up from his work as Steve takes a seat near him. His forehead is drawn tight with concentration, and he peers over at the files Tony had opened off to the side.
Bucky had stayed with her. The woman had said her name was Hammer, but Tony still has no idea who she is, or who her father is. There's a niggling feeling in the back of his mind that he
He'd given his knee a couple of none-too-gentle pokes while he'd been in the tub, after Tony had left him alone, because there was no way he was going to try to jerk off in the bathtub with Tony just outside the door.
"Thanks, Steve," Tony says with such gratitude at Steve's understanding, it melts Steve's heart a little.
"You are," Bucky agrees. "But we never would have reached that point because I would have eventually just kissed you to get my point across."
Casey nods thoughtfully. "But it doesn't matter, because he's still Bucky, and he still does lots of stuff. Doesn't matter that sometimes his arm won't work, he's special. There's a girl at my school who can't hear. Except she got a thing, so now she can hear, but it's still hard for her cause she isn't used to it. She taught me how to say some words with my hands. Wanna see?" Casey proceeds to teach Steve and Natasha some ASL signs, carefully shaped with his hands. He explains that he needs to speak slowly and clearly when talking to the girl so she can understand him. but sometimes sound is too much for her because she isn't used to it. "When that happens, we go play somewhere quiet together until she feels better."
Steve doesn’t remember, it still stings. “I only have a few weeks’ worth of memories. And none of them are good. At least… until now.”
had fixed it, come to his rescue like a knight in shining armour, that before he knows it, it sparks a bravery in him and the words are about to come out of his mouth –
"He's coming to Earth," Steve continues. "The Guardians are on their way, but we need to find Vision before Thanos does."
Clint groans in defeat and drops his head to the desk, banging it lightly against the wood. Bucky reaches over and gently scratches his head. God, it feels good. They need to find a way to get Steve and Tony together, if only for the fact that Steve deserves to have someone give him head scratches when he's feeling stressed.
It rushes over Natasha like a torrent of water, and then there's nothing but silent, inky black for long moments.
"Clint, I swear to god." Steve pinches the bridge of his nose, and by this point, Sam isn't even trying to hide his laughter.
Tony stays right where he is for a while, watching Casey's breath even out, his little eyelashes flutter and twitch as he falls deeper and deeper into sleep.
Faintly in the distance, he hears a muffled thump, a yell and a crash, and he groans, dropping his head against the counter. Very pointedly ignoring Steve’s cackling.
"No, that's not it," Natasha shakes her head. "The opposite, really. He adores Steve. Respects him, admires him, thinks the world of him, really. "
Tony and Rhodey had stood down, and Vision had done his gliding-flying thing out to the field, and they'd greeted the
"Steve Rogers," he says, taking the call. Tony watches from across the room, studying the curve of Steve's jaw, the way the corner of his mouth turns down into a frown. He knows that mouth, he knows what it felt like to have Steve's lips pressed against his, Steve's arms holding him. The memories make his chest ache, and make him want to get as far away as possible, as if running would get him away from everything he's feeling. But that's not an option.
It takes a few minutes, and a bit of scrounging, but soon enough Steve and Tony both find themselves free and on their feet again, and dressed. The whole situation is a bureaucratic mess and at this point there are multiple agencies on site, and no one can seem to decide who has jurisdiction where. It’s a headache that’s going to take days to sort out. Steve desperately hopes that he can convince Maria to handle the inevitable inter-agency information sharing meetings that are going to result in the coming days.
It's a dangerous thought, so he forces his mind back to the here and now, where he's wrapped up in a Rhodey hug. Which, he has to admit, is a close second in the 'best hugs of his life' running, because Rhodey hugs are
Renovation of the existing space is set to be completed in two weeks' time, according to the development permits. Which means Tony has two weeks to convince them they've chosen a terrible location, and that they should back out of their expansion plan.
“Exactly that,” Stark says like it’s obvious. Steve doesn’t move, or respond, waiting for Stark to elaborate. Stark huffs, and continues. “SI has a small… Arctic Research Division,” Stark explains as he shifts where he stands. “After your plane went down, Howard used to send a crew up there every summer to look for you. Obviously never found you, but they gained a lot of data about the Arctic, which, as you can imagine, not a very well charted area. The team realised there was a lot of potential to be had, so the division grew. On paper it was for exploration, geographic mapping, and as times changed it shifted into resource research, environmental issues, arctic sovereignty. The frozen wasteland is a hot issue these days.”
"But the way you loved him?" Steve continues. "That was all you. And that's what I want to see again."
"It isn't your fault," Shuri tells him. "But thank you. Vibranium is only part of it, what is the rest?"
Sam snorts, squatting down to look into the oven as though the answer will appear out of the darkness.
It's unlikely, sure. Tony does not – nor does he ever intend to – own a van. But knowing Casey is well taken care of during the day means Tony doesn't have so much of that irrational fear to contend with. It's still there, sure, but it's in the back of his mind now, instead of the front.
"Tony's got the place wired, the only people that can come in without his say-so are me and Natasha. And she's got
While helping Steve into the bathroom, Tony regrets all of his life choices that have led him to this moment. Most recently, he regrets having Steve undress before they got to the tub. He hadn't considered what having Steve's bare skin under his hands – even just to help him walk – would be like. It's bad enough that he can see Steve like this, with all his coiled strength; the way his defined muscles move under his skin, the way his broad shoulders shift, the strong, defined thighs. The sight is enough to make Tony want to put his mouth on every inch of Steve's skin, to map it out, to leave a trail of kisses down Steve's back, to suck a mark on the inside of his thigh. But feeling Steve's heat pressed against his body – that's even worse. As cold as they both are, Tony feels a heat and a want surge through him. It takes an alarming amount of self control to keep his body from responding inappropriately. It's okay, he just has to get Steve to the tub, one step at a time. Don't think about how nice Steve feels, or how nice it is to have some semblance of shared warmth. It's the longest 15 feet of his life.
If it had been anyone else, Tony would have been crushed at being stood up, though he would have denied it, brushed it off and gone about his evening. But sitting there, alone at the table with a bottle of wine ready, and an empty chair across from him, Tony wasn’t crushed. He was terrified.  Because Steve Rogers would never stand someone up.
"Nothing happened," Steve snapped, gripping the pen he's holding hard enough that Bucky thinks he might break it in half. "Tony just has more important things to do than worry about hanging around here. Just leave it."
Steve had honestly expected the first few days of the new shop opening to be a bit on the slow side. It takes time to build a presence, or so he assumed.
done," Clint whines, flopping himself dramatically into the chair across from Bucky. "It's what he's absolutely
He strolls up to the counter, hands in his pockets and rocking back on his heels as he waits in the horribly patient line of customers. There's a haggard-looking guy running the register, his longish brown hair tied up in a hipster man-bun and his left arm hanging somewhat limply by his side. His smile is bright and warm and Tony wants to smack it off his face.
Her eyes widen, and it's like she can't quite believe what she's hearing. Tony grins and taps her shoulder lightly. "Your slime beasts are making a mess, doing some damage, but last check, they hadn't hurt anyone. And, you're all out here desperately trying to fix what went wrong.”
Tony and Casey stay for a few minutes more before Tony decides to make good on his threat of making Casey run off all his sugar energy on the playground before they head home for dinner. On the sidewalk, Casey skips along and takes Tony's hand, gripping his tiny fingers around Tony's.
"Doesn't really make me feel better," Tony says, flipping the face plate up so he can see Steve with his own eyes, and wrapping an arm around Steve's shoulders. "Let me look at you."
"The first 24 hours will be critical," Strange answers. "The ideal scenario is that he will wake up within that time frame. The longer he stays unconscious, the less likely it is that he'll wake up at all."
They both know he’s already committed every detail of the floorplan Natasha had acquired to memory, but she doesn’t call him out on it.
The following night, Tony wakes up at around two in the morning from a dream about flying. The night after that, it's a nightmare about losing Casey. He decides to lay off the spicy foods before bed – even though he can't think of anything spicy he's eaten in the past week.
The power of the Infinity Stones is absolute. Strange and Thor had explained it to them. Very few beings in the universe have the strength to wield an infinity stone, let alone four of them. The Guardians had used the Power stone, once, but it had taken four of them, and they had still nearly been consumed by it.
The three of them make it back to the main area of the Palace to find the whole place in total battle prep mode. The civilians have all been evacuated into bunkers, and additional shields have gone up around the city. Okoye and the Dora Milaje are heading up the united band of fierce warriors that have come together to defend their home and fight for their people, establishing a perimeter, and running through various tactical plans. Steve is with them, listening intently, so Tony allows himself a moment to stare, eyes lingering on the man he knows so well, and not at all.
“No. I don’t know. Maybe. Probably not,”  he shrugs. Natasha says nothing, simply raising an eyebrow as a prompt for him to continue.
In the mornings, sometimes he looks out the shop window to see Tony and Casey walking over to the school, hand in hand, and sometimes, Steve yearns to be out there with them. He wonders what it would be like to stand on Casey's other side and walk him to school, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Tony and wave goodbye in the morning as Casey skips up the sidewalk. He's never really thought about it before – having a family, being a parent, but the more time he spends with Casey, the more he wants it. He wants it so much, the thought of it – and the knowledge that it's something he'll never actually have – makes his chest ache so deeply, there are moments he wonders if he'll ever feel whole. He understands now why Tony feels so protective over Casey. He feels it, too. If anyone were to hurt this boy, he would burn the world to the ground to find them. But Tony has worked damned hard to build the life he has for himself and Casey, and Steve is honestly just happy that he's been allowed to become a part of that, even off to the side. He's not going to push for more and ruin the balance they all have. It's too important. He'll never do anything that would mean he risks losing Tony and Casey as a part of his life forever.
Tony hadn't been excited about it, at first. In fact, all he could think about was what a terrible father Howard Stark had been, and how he was destined to follow in his father's footsteps and mess up his child for life.
"And because I didn't think the storm would get that bad that quickly. Casey or no, if I thought it was unsafe, I would have told you. I'm not about putting people I care about at risk. I've had enough of that in my life, thank you."
He grabs the plate and carefully removes the note before popping it in the microwave. His stomach growls loudly, and the few minutes it takes to reheat his meal are an excruciating eternity. The moment the microwave pings, he grabs the plate, barely feeling that it burns his finger tips a little. After years of metal work and welding, a little heat from a plate is nothing. Besides, he is hungry, and he wants food now. Food in hand, he sets himself up in one of the chairs by the large island in the kitchen and pulls his phone out.
right. Tony can feel it in his bones, down to his very core, just how right everything Steve is saying is. He
He'd expected to see a staff member — he can see Steve at the counter, but it could have been Clint or Bucky, or even Natasha stopping in for a tea, since she seems to have become a fixture in the Brewed Awakening crew's life.
Tony almost wants to laugh at the earnestness of the term, but he can't quite bring himself to do it. It's so quintessentially Steve, to say something as old fashioned and wholesome as 'make love', but he somehow manages to make it sound right. Instead, he nods and tips his lips up for another kiss.
"Oh god, no," Tony whines. "Do not let them near my child when I'm not there to tell him what ridiculous humans they are, and they go off and teach him whatever they want willy nilly."
"Definitely," Steve agrees. "I met him at the VA shortly after we got back. I was trying to find every resource I could to help us all settle back. Sam was a hell of a lifeline, and a hell of a friend."
Tony's stomach flips. He's lost the child he'd loved the way only a parent can truly love a child. A child he was never meant to have, and never meant to love. He's also lost a love he'd never been meant to have, either. How could he be so stupid? How could he fall for – and fall into bed with –
Steve slides off the counter and crosses the floor to them. "I really am happy for you," he says, hugging them both, an arm around each. "I love you both."
He picks up the pace, turns a corner just in time to see a heavy steel door slipping closed in the alley there. He bursts forward, grabs the handle, turns it and pulls it open with a jerk.
Steve is livid. How could they just let some strange woman take a child from their care? Didn't they have approved pick-up lists? Didn't they make people show ID? How could someone just go into a school and collect a child?
Natasha gives him a look, quirking one eyebrow in a way that makes Tony feel like he's under a microscope, but she gives him a little nod. "Sure, if you like."
"He – what?" Tony's eyes go wide – surprise and then anger – as he stares over at Bucky. "Come on, Barnes. Don't fuck with me."
is standing behind the counter, his back to Tony, talking quietly to Man-bun and looking every bit as gorgeous as he had the last time that Tony had seen him. Of course, Man-bun spots him first. Tony sees the instant it happens, because the guy's eyes narrow and shift to stare directly at him. Steve stops whatever he's saying mid-sentence and turns around to greet him.
"You're welcome. Thank you for hanging out with me, too." Steve replies. "You're welcome any time. You, your Dad, Natasha, Rhodey. We're always happy to see you."
Steve drops his head on Bucky's shoulder, and Bucky instinctively wraps an arm around him. "Yeah. I will be." Then, before he can second guess himself, he tells Bucky everything. About spinning out, about flashing back, about slogging through the snow, about staying in the hotel, and Tony helping him. Part way through the story, Clint comes in and settles himself on Steve's other side. He leaves out the part where he almost tried to kiss Tony, and the part about Tony's morning wood, and most of the details about Rumiko, choosing instead just to say that Tony told him about Casey's mom, and Steve told Tony about the IED incident. What Tony had shared with him felt... private. It isn't his place to divulge that.
It's not until the third time Bucky calls his name that Steve is able to lift his eyes and work through the rushing blood in his ears. Bucky's face is pale, his eyes wide, and he's grasping Steve's shoulders in both hands.
But this? This is so much worse. He’s still carrying everything he felt that night, but now he knows that it
"His brain waves are shifting, he should be waking soon," Shuri's voice cuts through whatever thought Tony is deep into some time later. He sits up quickly, and turns towards the screen in anticipation. Shuri makes her way over and taps at the the display, humming thoughtfully to herself. "Much quicker than I would have thought. Then again, I guess he's not human."
"So like I was saying," Tony says, resisting the urge to slip his hands into his pockets because if this guy throws a punch, Tony should probably be ready for it, "you're going to have to find a different location for your coffee shop."
The door chimes again, and Steve wants to throw something at it, but he looks up and it's like a cool drink of water on a hot day – Tony walks in, looking handsome and animated and relaxed. He's wearing a three-piece suit that probably costs the same amount as a brand new commercial oven, but Steve doesn't feel the slightest bit jealous or bitter, because it looks amazing on him. His eyes scan the shop and zero in on Steve's immediately, and he smiles that half-uncertain, truly happy smile that Steve likes so much, and Steve's whole body changes. The tightness of his muscles is no longer the kind from anxious, on-edge stress. Instead, it's anticipation, the fluttering of nerves, a feeling in his belly of happiness to see Tony again.
A job that isn’t going well for him, seeing as every time he tries to prod the conversation towards something useful, she turns the tables and comes at him with questions of her own.  It’s enough to make him curse with frustration. He sticks to his cover story, but he gets the impression that she doesn’t quite believe him. She lowers herself onto his lap and runs her fingers teasingly down the front of his chest. It would feel nice, if he weren’t thinking of fingers stained with motor oil.
His grip slips and the wrench he's holding so ineffectually falls from his hand, almost landing on his face, and he bites out a curse. He manages to dodge the wrench, but in doing so he also smacks the top of his head against the back of the oven, and he lets his whole body go limp because he just, for a minute, wants to give up entirely.
"It doesn't sound dumb," Steve tells him. "It sounds like you're a dad who loves his son, and doesn't want him to worry."
Tony makes a quiet sound in his throat, and then he starts moving faster, pushing up higher so that the hot-slick-slide of Steve's cock into him is longer and deeper.
. But at the same time, she feels her pulse jump, feels her thoughts scatter for an instant. It doesn't last long, but a glance sideways at Bucky tells her that he'd felt it, too. Not recognition, not a memory. More like a record needle skipping before it rights itself. A jarring confusion, and then it's smoothed over and everything is fine.
Pepper sighs at the other end of the line. She knows how hard it's been in recent weeks with the both of them having schedules that just don't line up. "If, and I do mean
When Tony gets to the front of the line, Man-bun aims that thousand-watt grin at him. "Hey there, what can I getcha?" he asks.
Tony half nods, half shrugs. "I mean, it's not unreasonable. Kids get scooped from busy places all the time. I just. Look, I don't care if it
Tony doesn't argue. He checks his phone to make sure he has service – which of course he does, even though it's barely up the highway from where he had no service at all – and heads over towards the closed off dining area to make his call.
Rhodey bobs his head in greeting, eyes flicking toward Tony but, thankfully, keeping the smug expression off his face. Tony can still see it, though, lurking behind his eyes. "Make mine iced, man, if you don't mind."
Vision smiles softly, and wraps Tony in a gentle hug. "Perhaps you have both been a positive influence on me." He pulls back after a moment, and adds, "For whatever it is worth to you, you were a good father."
"You're lucky it wasn't further than that," the man says, and guides Tony over to a chair of his own beside Steve before Tony can protest. "Here, lemme look you over."
For a flash of a moment, Steve wonders how they got here from fighting bad guys, but it doesn’t matter, because they
Steve blinks and then, somehow, seems to look a little bit disappointed. "You've never called me anything but my name."
Instead, it's a woman he doesn't recognize. Well, that's not entirely true — after a moment, he realizes it's the woman who has been here every morning for the past week, plugging away on a laptop a few tables away.
"I don't – shit, I might have condoms in a drawer somewhere but they're at least six years old," Tony says, realizing. Fuck, of all the things to not buy. He's got lube because he's not a big fan of chafing, but he doesn't have condoms.
He takes another couple of orders, and Evan works frantically behind him to get the drinks made. He wishes for a lull, for a chance to go back and kick at the oven a few more times, but it's not happening.
"Okay, let me know if you change your mind," Steve answers, and he's already starting to walk away. On the one hand, Tony does love to watch Steve walk away, but he'd rather Steve stay and talk a while. The shop has slowed down, he could take the time.
Tony waves him off and drops into a crouch in front of the oven. It makes his already tight, tailored trousers stretch around his ass and frame it beautifully. Not that Steve is staring. Just, if he
noticed any of those things, Steve probably would consider the fact that he doesn't think he's seen a rear end on a fella like that his whole life, and he wonders how plump and firm and – nope, he didn't notice at all because the guy has a
Stark very pointedly looks from Steve, to the split bag on the floor, and back to Steve again. “Right,” he says, incredulously.
“But you were thinking about it at least a little,” Tony says. Steve can’t argue, because it’s true.
"No need to get weird about it," Tony says awkwardly, but it's too late, and Steve is kissing his cheek, nuzzling against his neck.
“J, where is Cap right now?” Tony asks, sitting himself down at his work station and pulling up his displays.
And the flashback, back at the car – god, Steve wants to crawl into a hole. Yeah, he's been doing the therapy, talking to Sam, the whole nine yards, but still. That doesn't make it any less humiliating to have it happen in front of Tony like that.
Steve nods and turns to follow T'Challa out of the room, but before he does, he looks back at Tony. Their eyes meet, and Steve's are full of pain, confusion, sadness, and a thousand other emotions Tony wishes that he didn't see. The other Tony could just kiss it all away. This Tony can't.
to get hit on. They're talking about work (for once), when Rhodey's focus shifts slightly up from Tony's face, and Tony turns his head to see what Rhodey's looking at.
"Exactly. And you learn from it. So the next time, you get to fuck things up in a new and exciting way."
for is to be Steve's friend, and he doesn't really deserve more than that, so the words stand as they are.
Yeah, okay, Steve might have a point, what with the way that Tony just unloaded on him like that. He's not sorry, but he'd apologise if it got him more of this coffee. And more of Steve's attention – which, no amount of perfect caffeine can fully distract him from the way Steve's intense blue eyes are totally focused on him.
"Bucky's calling Natasha, but we need to close down the shops and meet at Tony's. Do you understand?"
Stark just waves him off and crossed the open space. “You underestimate what a stubborn bastard I am, and how often people are dicks to me. It’s fine, I get it. SHIELD has a way of winding people up tight, and you, my friend, had had a hell of a week.”
"Right. So. That's it. I'm done. We've reached critical mass, and we have got to do something about these two idiots. Because not even
"Tony, come on," says Rhodey, from Tony's other side. "You know they're right. We gotta do this together. It's the only hope we have of getting Casey back."
when you really actually like someone." Tony scoffs, but Rhodey continues. "Lucky for you, Steve was flirting right back."
"I should get back to work," Bucky says, and turns to leave. "I better see you both soon!" he calls back over his shoulder.
This time, when Steve wakes, it's to high heels snapping on tile floor outside the room. The pace is clipped, accompanied by two voices. Peter is gone.
“You know, I built a perfectly good gym for this kind of thing. State of the art training facility.”
"Cap, you done making googly eyes over the crazy rich guy now, or do you need another minute?" Clint asks, snickering as he walks by where Steve is still sitting. Clint moves to bus a nearby table, and Steve realizes he's been staring at the door since Tony Stark left several minutes ago.
do this, but you really… you made an impact on me, Steve. Before tonight, even. You're kind, and generous, and funny and smart, and you work so hard, and you've done so many amazing things. You're basically the perfect guy. And yeah, you have imperfections, but that almost makes you
"Yeah," Steve admits. "It doesn't happen so much anymore, at least not like that. But it does sometimes. If something sets me off. It's been a while since I've had one that intense, though. We all came back with PTSD. Not surprising, really. But, I'm sorry it happened during a crisis when I needed my head in the game."
Peter gives him a blinding, hopeful smile, then settles back in his chair. To Steve's surprise, he actually does stay quiet – long enough for Steve to fall back asleep.
Casey looks at him carefully for a moment, and then smiles bright and wide. The smile that looks so much like Tony's, it almost takes his breath away. "It's okay. I have Miss Natasha, and Daddy has you. So neither of us will be alone, or scared. You promise to keep my Daddy safe?"
"The amount of muscle you're packing, Steve, that seems pretty normal," Tony says, eying his defined shoulders and chest pointedly.
The reply had come only moments later. As though Steve had been keeping his phone charged and on his person at all times, too.
Natasha wants to tear her apart, suddenly – to rend her limb from limb, for daring to talk about Casey at all, let alone for spouting lies. Her carefully maintained calm shatters, and she's got her hand at Hammer's throat, manicured fingers wrapped around it. She doesn't squeeze, not yet. She lets all her anger, all her malice show in her usually impassive face, and Hammer rears back, panicked for a moment before her eyes widen comically further.
this thing. To defeat him, to defeat the advancing horde. It won't be easy, but at least without the glove in the way, it'll be closer to a fair fight.
Hammer stares at them both, and Natasha thinks she can clock the exact moment it starts to fall into place for her. That Natasha and Bucky have no idea what she's talking about.
Casey squeezes his eyes shut, a look of concentration scrunching up his face, and then he pops his eyes open. "Can you see me, Daddy?!"
"Yeah, I really do," Tony admits, grimacing. "I've never been away from him overnight. I know that sounds dumb, and –"
," growled Tony. "If we're going to do something, we need to decide on it pretty quickly, or he'll decide for us."
"Friday!" he yells, looking for the emergency releases Tony builds into his suits. He can't find any – either Tony's moved them, or the new nanosuit doesn't have them. "Friday, get him out of the armour!"
Tony heats up the shower and then slips into it, grateful for the warm, high-pressure shower head. It's one of those rain showers, much like his own at home, so hot droplets of water cascade over his head and shoulders from above.
Just outside the lab, Vision cries out in pain and grabs at his head, his eyes squeezing shut, knees shaking. "Hey, you're okay," Tony says softly. "Stay with me buddy, okay? We're gonna sort this out." Tony looks up at Strange, who'd followed them down, but Strange's brows are furrowed, and a look of deep concern is set on his face. It does little to make Tony actually believe what he's saying, but dammit, Vision will be okay. He can't not be.
"Bath might be easier, you won't have to stand," Tony points out as he crouches next to the chair and helps Steve wiggle out of his pants. The Universe really must hate him, because this is definitely not the scenario he'd pictured himself getting Steve out of his clothes. The ones he'd entertained in his fantasies – quiet moments in the dark when he was alone – involved a lot more kissing, a lot more hands on both sides, and a lot more pushing up against walls and grinding of hips together.
Tony lets himself wallow for all of a day before he decides it’s time to get his shit together. Steve might not remember him, but dammit, this is still his Steve, and he isn’t going to just give up on him.
He stands there for a moment, letting the water heat him to the bone, and then he gets another flash of the highlight reel.
"Not at all," Tony assures him. "Like I said, I'd love the company. I'll bring the car, you bring the coffee, we'll make a day of it."
A stunned silence follows, and Steve presses on before Tony can say anything. “Look, it’s fine, okay? I’m not going to leave the tower, I’ll get over it, and I’m sorry I’m impossible to be around.”  As if this night couldn’t get any worse, now he’s gone and burned the last semblance of a rickety bridge that there was between he and Tony. Just fucking great. As soon as he sees Natasha again, he’s going to give her hell.
Tony hands the car keys over to Rhodey, and sits in the back with Casey wrapped up in his arms. He doesn't let Casey out of his grip the whole ride back to Manhattan.
As soon as he gets close, the smell of food wafts into the room, and suddenly Steve is ravenous. He really shouldn't have waited so long to eat – he'd known his body would need to restore its strength, and that his metabolism would have burned through any previously consumed calories long ago.
Hope, it seems, is a fickle thing, an illusion that likes to taunt him now and again, and his brain seems to delight in its misery because the feeling never lasts long. He wakes up the following morning feeling out of sorts, and it’s all downhill from there. He feels like a stranger to himself, like he doesn’t belong in his own body, like he doesn’t belong in his life, like everything is a dream and he’s just waiting to wake up. Nothing feels real.
!" Casey says, peering up at him. "How are you? How is Steve? Did you know that he and Daddy had a big adventure?"
But Tony knows what has to be done. Thanos has to be stopped. He can be the one to lay down on the wire. Take that, Steve.
"Eugh, you're too sappy, I gotta go," Tony says, pushing up and away from Steve. Steve keeps his arms locked around Tony's back, though, so he can't get away. Even as Steve's cock slips out of him, even as he fights, laughing, to try and get away from Steve's hold, Steve rolls them both so that he's hovering over Tony on the bed again, then grins and leans down to give Tony a real, proper kiss.
Strange's hands create a portal, gold sparks circling it, and he gestures for them to precede him through it. Clint is the first one through, dragging Bucky along with him. Rhodey goes next, followed by Natasha and Sam. Steve glances furtively at Tony, then shrugs and jumps through as well, leaving Tony there alone with Strange.
He is surprised when, on the fourth morning the new shop is open, Tony saunters back in looking far more composed than he had the last time that Steve had seen him. Less like a frazzled parent, more like a suave entrepreneur. It's a good look on him. Not quite as good as Tony in full dad mode with his son, but it's still a good look.
They fall into an easy routine, and before Steve really realises it, Tony has become a regular part of his life and it's hard to imagine what the shop would be like without Tony coming in.
Rhodey is at his side, arms folded over his chest. Strange's expression shifts in a way that Tony recognises as someone trying to work through a problem with a lot of unknown variables.
Steve's finger twists, pulling out a little and pushing back in. He pulls all the way out to add more lube, and then he's back with two fingers, pressing in and out to stretch Tony open.
Steve nods his agreement and looks grateful. Tony figures that Steve just didn't want to make him awkward, which was completely unnecessary. Tony is going to feel awkward no matter what the sleeping arrangements are. They throw back the blankets, and Steve carefully slides into bed, sitting upright against the massive pile of pillows. Tony grabs one of the spares, and slides it under Steve's knee to support it. He then grabs a couple of bottles of water from the fridge, and the plates of sandwiches that Fred had made them, and sits down on the end of the bed. Steve's eyes go wide at the sight of food, and he eagerly takes one of the plates from Tony and dives into the sandwich with enthusiasm. Tony's fairly certain he's never seen anyone enjoy a sandwich this much in his life.
Tony stands, cradling Casey in his arms. Casey has fallen asleep, but Tony knows he won't be comfortable. He's tempted to bring Casey to bed with him, but he knows it will be better for Casey to wake up in his own bed. It might help convince his brain he's safe now. Home. That everything is back to normal.
Steve's eyes swing toward Rhodey, and his face… tightens? But then he's smiling again, pulling out a couple of Clint's cannolis and placing each of them on its own plate, with a little paper doily. The plates are mismatched, which Tony thinks just adds to their charm – even if Steve claims it was never intentional, and the problem is that Clint and Bucky can't go a day without breaking at least three plates, so they've ended up with several incomplete sets.
He reads Casey a couple of books before bed – he always tells the kid he'll read him just the one, but Casey normally manages to wheedle two more out of him before lights out. Tony doesn't mind – he loves this part of the day, when it's just the two of them. Casey is curled into Tony's side in his little race car bed, blinking sleepily as Tony reads to him. Casey is out halfway through the fourth book.
The woman stirs, finally, but neither Bucky nor Natasha move. They simply watch for a moment as the woman lifts her head. Lanky hair hangs in her face, and it takes her a long time to blink her eyes clear.
"It's just, I mean, I thought maybe we were almost – not that I want to assume, but I thought we were friendly enough that you'd – think of me like that. As a friend."
Shuri nods. "That's what it looks like, it's as if snapping back into this reality caused a glitch, so he needs to reset."
He looks up, and gives Tony one of those warm, pure, genuine smiles. The kind that makes Tony's heart melt, and that tells him Steve isn't lying to him when he says he's okay. There is more going on here, more than Tony understands, but what he does understand is that Steve Rogers is one tough son of a bitch. The tub reaches a decent level, and Tony shuts the water off and stands. He takes the towel from Steve and shakes it out into the bathroom garbage. Then, once again, he helps Steve to his feet, praying to every god that may or may not exist that he doesn't blush as Steve tugs his boxers off — Tony keeps his eyes on the ceiling — and manages to step out of them. It takes some work, but they manage to get Steve into the tub. The sound that Steve makes as he sinks into the warm water is absolutely sinful, and threatens to go straight to Tony's dick.
"Who needs a reputation anyway?" Steve sighs, rolling his eyes to the ceiling in supplication as he passes the cup over to Tony.
"We'll have to keep ourselves abreast of one another's projects somehow," Tony says with a knowing smile.
The description of the woman hadn't been particularly helpful. Average height, average build. Long, dirty blonde hair. She'd been frantic, worried about her 'brother,' Tony. She'd said her name was Angela.
"Well, sure," Bucky shrugs. "But they're all going to be a hell of a lot more expensive. This is the best deal for the quality and type that we want."
. He's – he wasn't real clear, he's pretty shaken. He said Rhodes was on his way over, but that's all I got out of him."
Steve tonight. He'd gone quiet, Tony had heard shots, and no one could rouse him on the comms for what felt like a lifetime.
"Don't suppose there was contact info on that flyer?" Tony asks hopefully. He needs to track this hipster coffee shop owner down, he needs to make this whole thing go away. No hipster coffee shop with an open patio, no nondescript strangers sitting at a table all day drinking coffee and watching his son's school. None of it. It's completely unacceptable.
Fred glances at Tony, and hums thoughtfully, but doesn't say anything more on the subject, which Steve is grateful for. He doesn't want to accidentally start spilling his guts to a stranger, telling Fred that it's not in the cards because all he can think about when he thinks of having a family of his own is Tony and Casey. And that's not going to happen, so he shoves it out of his mind entirely.
Steve stares. "I was actually thinking along the lines of one particular child that could use some spirit-boosting, Tony. Maybe by being added to our family."
"Uh. Yes. Yes I am," Clint confirms, and clears his throat. "I think I'm going to need a bigger paintball?"
Steve has a hand resting against Casey's leg, as though he can't quite make himself let go of the boy, either.
Steve shakes his head. "You blew off a meeting with Department of Defence to fix my oven. And I know it doesn't seem like a big thing, but it is, and it saved us thousands of dollars, not to mention the
Rhodey had been his roommate when Tony had been doing his second PhD at MIT, which had been interesting since Rhodey was 23 at the time and working on his first. Tony had been 17, underage, and just starting to branch out past "heterosexual". He'd seen Tony's wild, casual and ill-advised sexual awakening years, and he'd seen Tony's whirlwind romance with Rumiko, and he'd seen how terribly Tony had taken her death. He'd been there through all of it — a powerful support system that had been highly skilled at taking Tony down a peg and slapping him across the face with a dose of reality when needed, or propping him up when he had been at his lowest points.
Steve doesn't wait for him. He heads further up the street, sticking to the shadows as well as he can.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony says as he opens the fridge and pauses. There, staring up at him is a plate of food, lovingly assembled and wrapped in plastic to keep it fresh. On top of the plate is a sticky note that reads in precise, blocky letters: ‘FOR TONY ONLY. JARVIS IS WATCHING YOU.’ Under the words is a little cartoon skull that somehow manages to look both adorable and threatening at the same time. God, Tony loves this man.
Finally, when Tony definitely hasn't had his fill but knows he has to stop staring at the boy and get some work done, he carefully extricates himself from Casey's wiry limbs, and silently leaves the room, closing the door half way.
His initial plan, to tell Tony about his feelings as soon as he wakes, had been the right one. He just has to hope he'll get the chance.
In front of him, the 3D displays light up, and he studies it for a moment before nodding. “Right then. Give me everything we have on Barnes’ recovery, and all the tech stuff Natasha pulled on the Winter Soldier project.”
He glances at the time. A little over 13 hours and then Steve would be all his, and nothing short of the world ending would get in their way.
Tony really is a good, safe driver. He takes all the right precautions, slows down for conditions, the whole nine yards. So it's just shitty luck that Tony hits a patch of black ice the wrong way and the car spins out of control.
"He's, um, he hasn't woken up yet, but they're optimistic," Steve says, shifting uncomfortably. "Would you like to – here, sit down, please." He pulls out the chair –
Steve's hands are pushing at Tony's clothes clumsily, eyes roaming over Tony's body as he reveals skin. His hands are surprisingly soft, except for a few calluses here and there.
The alarm wakes him at 6:30, and more than anything in the world, he wants to throw it out the window.
"If you have time, would you like to join us?" Natasha asks as he slides their finished drinks across the counter to them. Casey looks up, wide eyed and hopeful, as Natasha passes down his cookie plate. How could Steve possibly disappoint him? Besides – the shop is quiet. There's a couple off in one corner chatting quietly and laughing with each other, and the somewhat curt woman that had come in a few minutes earlier when Evan had still been at the counter, is sitting at a table by herself and typing furiously on a laptop, but otherwise the shop's empty. And he could use a break.
Everyone turned to look at him, but it was Bruce who gave him a sympathetic smile. "The Infinity stones, Tony. Thanos is coming for them."
He works on business for a few hours, and then he moves on to the resumes. He throws the first five out immediately – nothing special, no reason to believe they could protect Casey from any threats, real or imagined. There are two that look interesting, though, so he pours himself a cup of coffee and takes a second look. Then he does a little background research on them to help him make a decision.
"Sure, Steve, I got a bum arm and we got a line-up to the door but no, by all means, take a little break to talk to the crazy person," Man-bun grumbles.
"Hey, Steve. Heard you were up here for a shower, and I told the kitchen I'd hand-deliver. How's Tony?"
"Okay, Tony," Steve says calmly. "I need you to take a deep breath, and tell me exactly what happened."
Steve looks at him, blinking slowly, and Tony can see the relief in his eyes. "I'd like that," he says softly. "If you're sure?"
"Clint, we paid perfectly good money for a step ladder, get your feet off the damned counter," Steve growls. Armed with his supplies, Clint jumps down as if it were no more difficult than taking a regular step.
"Steve, I don't know this man beside me, but if he orders a real coffee instead of a minivan-mom version, his name will be James Rhodes and he will be a friend of mine who also
With Tony at his six, Steve surges forward. Subduing HYDRA is his priority, but he’s not about to let the buyers make any kind of get away either. They’re all lucky that both sides seemed to realised that with the fight turning to such close quarters, guns are not a good idea. At least that lessens the chance of anyone getting shot.
Rhodey makes a sputtering sound, and Steve bites on his bottom lip to keep from smiling again. Tony's eyes are drawn right to the plump, pink flesh. He can't look away as Steve's perfect, white teeth dig into the skin.
The kid is short, which Steve supposes is to be expected since he's attending preschool. He's got straight dark hair, flopped over into his face, and he's holding onto Tony's hand and chattering excitedly.
Tony shuts down all those thoughts because it's just not going to happen. It doesn't matter that Steve seems naturally great with Casey. It doesn't matter that Casey naturally adores him, and Tony can already tell that once they leave, Casey is going to be pestering him about coming back and visiting Steve. It doesn't
"Right. Of course," Steve says, and now he looks disappointed again? What the hell? Either the guy wants to be his friend, or he doesn't. "So then, you two…?"
Rhodey snorts. "I can't wait to bring this up later, when you come to me to tell me how madly in love you are."
they want, they just gave me that address." He waves his hand at the piece of scrap paper he'd written the address on. It's out by the docks, because of course it is. "They said to come alone or they'd kill him."
"A nice person with a gorgeous ass who makes goo goo eyes at you and your shoulders." Bucky pats his shoulder to emphasize the point. "Admit it, Steve, you like the guy. And it's okay. It's good for you. Besides, turns out he's not actually an asshole like you first thought, so that's a win.
She blinks at him, and then her face transforms. It's not a look of embarrassment or disappointment, which is what he would have expected. Instead, her face flashes with anger, before she schools it to settle on 'mildly annoyed'.
Tony glances over at Bruce who nods in confirmation. "It's more amazing than you know, Tony. The work she's doing here? It's more advanced than anything you or I have imagined."
"Fine," Pepper agreed. "I'll have my assistant make the arrangements and forward you the meeting time. Do not make me regret this."
that because it's not on the table. Instead, the first thing that comes out of his mouth is, "Of course I think of you as a friend!" Which is entirely a lie because Tony most definitely thinks of Steve as more than a friend. However, all he can
He pulls the waistband up over Steve's erection and pushes the shorts down his thighs, mouth watering at the length of Steve's dick, right in his face. He's uncircumcised, which Tony hadn't really expected. He's not small – he's a big guy everywhere, though, so that's not as much of a surprise.
As it is, things are already dicey. The Dora Milaje are picking off the few creatures that do manage to force their way inside the field, but the creatures, or their Masters, are very quickly figuring out how to use those numbers to their advantage. They swarm around more of the perimeter of the dome, and it's only a matter of time before the whole thing comes crashing down. Shuri must realise it at the same time, because he hears her voice over the comms, telling T'Challa that the'll need to come up with a plan.
Steve stares at him with deep, unbelieving affection. "You pushed off a meeting for one of the biggest breakthrough projects you've done in I don't know how long, just so you could meet me at the airport?"
"'Cept Rhodey was in the air one. He flew planes and stuff. Is that how Bucky hurt his arm? In the army? Daddy and Rhodey say that sometimes people get hurt in the army. That's why Daddy is trying to make stuff to keep the army guys safe, so they don't get so hurt."
doesn’t want to think too much about, lest he end up putting his fist through something. Steve grabs the ball, and lightly tosses it across the room.  Dummy squeals and tears after it. Tony swears he hears Steve laugh softly, and when Dummy returns, he eagerly throws the ball again.
yelling. Tony's voice somehow breaks through the chaos and Steve is so relieved to hear his voice that his knees almost turn to water.
He hovers well above the battle, the HUD scanning and assessing everything in sight to track the little bastards.
Tony pops out of the oven with a grin, eyes sparkling. He's got a smudge on his cheek, and his hair is wildly mussed. His shirtsleeves are rolled up to the elbow so Steve can see the ropey muscles of his forearms, and he looks just disheveled enough to look ridiculously sexy.
