“Hello, Dean,” he managed to say. He kept his face as emotionless as possible. A silence stretched while Dean figured out what to say. “That’s...a nice jacket,” he said. Castiel looked down as if he just noticed the piece of clothing was on his body.
“Yeah,” Alfie said, cutting off Dean’s train of thought, “It wasn’t just sometimes. It was all the time. They went out almost every weekend, sometimes, even week
. He couldn’t believe he’d just...forgotten about it. He’d been so wrapped up in his evaluation that everything else had been completely pushed out of his mind. He felt like a complete and utter
Dean swallowed thickly. “I just can’t believe I almost drove this...you...away for the rest of my life. I was a goddamn fool, and I’m thanking every higher power that might be out there that you’re giving me a second chance. You are...giving me that, right?” Dean asked. He couldn’t bare to look into Cas’s eyes if he was going to reject him. Dean looked down at the zipper on Cas’s jacket instead.
A few minutes later, in the parking lot, Balthazar called out to Castiel before he could reach his car.
“You’re right,” Bartholomew said, “it shouldn’t have to be your choice. You shouldn’t feel responsible for this at all. Naomi and I are adults, and we will make this decision on our own. But, your opinion does matter. I care about you, and your safety, and your happiness. I know it seems like I haven’t lately, but that’s going to change right now,” he walked up to his son and wrapped him in a hug.
The English teacher ran his fingertips up and down Dean’s back, letting himself get lost in the motion. He was encouraged at Dean’s pleased hums. The pair lay like that for a while, Castiel continuing his gentle strokes as Dean snored softly on his chest.
Dean couldn't spot the one he dropped Cas off at. A paramedic came up and helped Benny into the vehicle. There were other people on the bench running along the right side of the ambulance. When they got Benny on, they closed the doors and raced off to the nearest hospital, leaving Dean in the parking lot of the burning building.
“Leave,” the teen choked out. His father looked at him in confusion and opened his mouth to argue, but Castiel insisted more fiercely, “
towards him. He was handsome. He had dark, curly hair and strong facial structures. I couldn't help it. I started hanging around him a lot, and we actually become really close. One night, I don't know what came over me, but I kissed him," Dean shook his head and covered his face in his hands.
“Nothing,” Charlie said coyly, “I don’t want to be late for trig,” she said before turning into her first period class. Dean just shook his head and made his way to the Chemistry lab. As he walked in, his eyes swept over the people in the room and noticed someone new. He had to do a double-take just to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.
Cas looks down as Dean seems to have started moving in reverse, “oh, then you should go, bring back previsions, this calls for a completely different set of plans,” he leans in and pecks the confused angel’s cheek.
he finds himself think and smiles when he feels a flare of warm grace through him. After his shower he walks back to the kitchen and finds Sam hunched over a notebook and decides he could use a beer. He enters and walks to the fridge.
“Yeah, good plan.” With a pat to the shoulder, Sam drops his arm and the two walk back into the bunker.
Dean turns from his duffle, pointing a bundle of clothes at her, “That’s handmaiden,” he says seriously, then breaks into a smile, “And if you don’t mind?”
Alexa’s eyes narrow, and before Sam can even realize what he said, she tells him in a dangerously low voice, “I’m sleeping in my room. Deal,” she air quotes, “with that,” and she slams the door behind her.
He brushes a nonexistent strand of hair from her face, “Yeah, ok. Just be careful,” he leans down and gives her a kiss, “Love you.”
He nods then clears his throat and hoarsely says, “I thought I finally pushed you too far and that was you breaking up with me. I thought you did regret your decision.”
“Then I’ll be tails, that ok with everyone?” he gets a round of nods and tosses the coin. Clapping his hand over it, he looks around one more time before looking at the answer. “Heads.”
“Do you guys do this often?” When Dean just shrugs, a slow smile creeps across his face, “you guys are like, crazy romantic you know that, right?”
“Dean Winchester,” she smacks his arm, “you are in a happily committed interspecies relationship, why are you spying Victoria Secret bags?”
“Oh. Okay,” She blinks a few times before turning her eyes back to the passing scenery. “So why didn’t Sam come with us again? I mean obviously Cas had to stay back.”
He nods, “I won’t say a word. But we both should be getting back to our respective Winchester,” he stands and walks into the hall before turning back briefly to say, “good night Alexa,” and he leaves.
Sam stops at the door, “it actually is Dean. When Cas comes back, tell him Lex and I will handle this one.”
After that they leave him alone, satisfied that their point was made. Although nothing substantial, Sam and Alexa have agreed on a few points. It’s progress.
He continues to walk in hopes something will jog his memory when Cas is suddenly behind him, “yes, Alexa wants ice cream.”
Outside the door Cas can feel Dean’s emotions hitting him steadily like being pulled underwater; wave after wave. Since they’ve become a couple their bond has grown stronger and sometimes Cas is a bit overwhelmed by just how much Dean feels. When a sudden white hot flare of pure fear hits him, he sits up and starts to rush into the bathroom all at once. Angel blade in hand he’s stunned when a wet-faced Dean opens the door. “Dean?”
“I won’t lie, it’s true. But it’s true for every damn couple out there. That’s life, dude. Is that really what’s been holding you back?” Sam nods. “Then you know what you have to do, Sam.”
He nuzzles his nose into the soft strands behind Cas’s ear, his lips placing a quick kiss that seems to make the angel blush.
“Hmm, you could,” he blindly reaches for Cas’s hand. Finding it he gives a squeeze, “but I probably should. Keep me from worrying too much about what we’re walking into,” he lets go if Cas’s hand and stands, walking over to gather clothes for their drive home.
“Be annoying. Don’t let her not tell you. If you have to use your dominate strength, do it. Obviously you know what is too much, but block the door, hold her still, things like that.”
“Hell no, have you met us? We’re stubborn assholes. We snarked and bickered the entire drive to a case.”
“Come on you sap,” he takes his hand back and they quickly gather their things and head into the bunker. They’re met with uneasy quiet causing them to share a look of question. Walking through the halls they finally come across Sam in the kitchen staring off at nothing, a cup of coffee that, being as its after noon, is more than likely ice cold, between his hands. Dean nudges Cas back a few steps then turns to him, “change of plans, talk to him and I’ll see if I can find Lex.”
“Dean,” he lets out a long suffering sigh. Dean removes a hand and runs his thumb across his lip while his eyes bounce to Cas’s lips then back to his bright blue eyes. Cas takes a step, getting impossibly closer, “you’re terrible.”
Dean walks into his room to find it dark, then hands wrap around him. Hands that then traced over his body before there were lips placing soft kisses behind his ear and along his neck. The brush of fingers along his waist as his jeans are undone. Then hands on his hips pushing the clothing to the floor before running up his sides and pulling his shirts up with the motion, only pausing to allow the lips on his neck to move. Once the garments are over his head, the lips are back on his body, this time moving over the freshly exposed skin. Also without the extra fabric, he feels the hard body pressed against his is naked as well, and very obviously enjoying turning him into a boneless puddle on his floor.
When an arm snakes around his waist and pulls him impossibly closer, he finds himself instantly needing more, and all he can manage is a ragged “bed”. The only response a gravelly grunt of recognition, before he’s lowered onto the bed. His own hands and lips making quick work of bringing the angel to the same level of boneless mush pile. It’s hot, and heavy, and fan-fucking-tastic. There’s no need for words, besides breathy names traded back and forth, and a languid kiss neither want to break after.
The fight seems to leave them as more kisses and touches are traded back and forth. Somewhere along the way Cas has moved to sitting against the wall, legs out in front of him, the exhausted hunter in his arms. His lips still brushing against Dean’s hair, whispering that he’s got him, and a hand cradling the back of his head, despite the man having fallen asleep at some point. It may have taken them a while to get out of their own ways, but they’re not going to let that happen again. Cas certainly knows he is not going to let anything from heaven, hell, or anywhere else take this from him.
and turns to him, his hand running through his hair, as he leans in to kiss the top of his head. “I didn’t think you’d be up yet, after last night that is,” his voice is barely above a whisper as if trying to not acknowledge it’s morning.
A few weeks pass and now Dean is finding it more and more amusing to tell Sam to “marry that girl,” every time Alexa does something he approves of. Like now as he eats a cookie from the batch she’s just taken out of the oven.
Dean takes a breath and squares his shoulders. Then, in one breath, looks straight ahead and rushes, “A hunter reached out and said the angel killing hunter may be at it again and thought we could handle it.” Even though he kept the mention of her alter ego under wraps, he can’t look at her either. All he hears is the gasp that pulls his attention back to her face.
Dean wakes to his stomach growling. With a groan he gets up and pads to his brother’s room. Knocking, “hey, want some food?”
“We’ll figure this out and then be home before you know it. But for now let me see your phone, Sam said he sent you the info. I don’t know why he didn’t send it to me,” she stops her rambling when he doesn’t answer, “Dean?”
The lame joke still makes Sam grin, “You got it, Dean. Now don’t get dead, and bring her back to me.”
In a quiet mountain cabin another couple is getting ready to head home. Although that’s the plan in theory. They may still be lying naked on the bed, but they’re talking about leaving.
Sam’s thumb quickly retreats away from his mouth, “What?” He shakes his head, “Dean, that doesn’t make sense.”
“Yeah, probably right. It’ll take longer than that to just gather enough alcohol to get Cas wasted anyway,” he smiles.
Sam still isn’t convinced but climbs into bed as well, “yeah, yeah he always has been. But I’d really rather not talk about my brother and his boyfriend, who is also like my brother,” he kisses her shoulder and nuzzles her neck.
Dean was bored stiff. He decided to rope the Dream Team into playing cards with him. When all five of them were seated at the table, Dean laid out the rules.
It was approaching nine in the evening and Dean was practically vibrating with nerves. He still hadn’t heard anything from Cas, and he was half tempted to drive to the courthouse himself.
“Unfortunately, yes. Even though I stayed until eleven last night, more work is always to be done.” Cas said.
“Yes,” Cas answered truthfully, “if she was going to make me go to that godforsaken place, I was not going to go peacefully,” he informed Dean.
“That was absolutely ridiculous,” Naomi huffed as she got into the car with Bart. The patriarch bit at his bottom lip as he thought of what to say. While Bart was in thought, Naomi continued, “and now I have to show up in goddamn court! I have never been so insulted. I can tell you one thing, my company will no longer be financially supporting the Lawrence Police Department,” she announced.
wouldn’t happen to be the infamous fireman would it?” Balthazar asked. Cas’s lack of answer was answer enough. “Well in that case, you should definitely be with
“Are you kidding me? You get this whole space to yourself? Why the hell are we always cooped up in my room? This place is as big as my entire house,” Dean went on.
“She’s not the devil, you know,” Bart started, trying to make these two see eye to eye for once in their tumultuous relationship. Castiel huffed and rolled his eyes. He pulled his legs up in front of himself and placed his folded arms on top of his legs. He didn’t want to look at his father right now.
Castiel rolled his eyes and got comfortable on his bed again. Needless to say, he'd be taking the ridiculous punishment.
“Ugh, abso-fuckin-lutely not,” Dean groaned out. He put his hands on Cas' hips and pushed him up, breaking the contact between them. Castiel knitted his eyebrows together in confusion.
Castiel was awoken suddenly the next morning. His eyes flew open and the only thought in his head was “oh no”. He leaned over the side of the bed and threw up, cringing at the taste of his own vomit. He praised every deity he could think of that there was a trash can right next to the bed. He heaved a few more times and sighed deeply. When he felt stable enough, he pulled back from the side of the bed and sat up. He looked around and realized he was not in his own bedroom. He was in Dean’s. He looked to his right and was disappointed when he didn’t find Dean on the other half of the bed. There wasn’t even a trace that Dean had been in the bed at all.
He left out the part where he wasn’t in bed alone. It’s not like he was doing anything wrong, but he still
His boyfriend dragged him out when he realized they were out of liquor. He had promised Castiel they would just be out for a few drinks. Then, they could go back his place and...relax. Castiel acquiesced; the promise of alcohol and sex wasn't an altogether bad plan for the evening. The couple went to grab their coats before leaving the apartment.
"Save it for the judge hot-shot. Now, we have about four-and-a-half minutes before he gets back in the car." The other man, Dean, pulls his hands from behind his back and starts uncuffing Castiel. "If we're quiet, he won't notice we're gone." Castiel has about a million thoughts running through his mind right now. All he does is nod, and Dean is stealthily opening the door on his side. Everything is still pitch dark as they sneak out of the car. There's a patch of woods about three hundred feet away. They're about halfway there when the cop walks over to the side of the car with the door wide open.
“It was alright,” he said, disappearing into the hallway. Dean pocketed his phone and gathered up the ingredients for spaghetti. He also preheated the oven so they could have fresh-baked rolls.
“She can be quite intuitive,” Balthazar agreed, finishing his own drink and switching back to his tea.
Castiel was confused; did he just call Samandriel ‘Sammy’? Who was this guy? To Castiel’s surprise, Samandriel’s boyfriend answered the attractive boy’s question.
The next morning, Castiel woke up with a start...two whole minutes before his alarm was set to go off. He groaned and threw the covers off himself, walking to the bathroom to take a shower. His brain couldn’t give him those two extra minutes, huh?
That may have been the first meal they shared in a month, but this definitely wasn't the first bed they would share in that time. The men had needs. Very manly needs.
“And you're gonna walk straight to my room, you hear me?” Dean instructed, leaving no room for arguing. They exited the bathroom and Dean watched as Cas plodded down the steps.
“Let’s grab a cuppa, I’ll tell you all about her,” he said, offering his arm for Charlie to take. Once the pair had left, Dean let out a long breath. He was in deep shit now.
“Good, ‘cause I have no clue where I am,” Dean chuckled, “Can I use your can? I think I had a little too much.”
“Are you joking?” Bart asked. Never, in their four years of marriage, had Naomi ever been so outright unfeeling.
“Well...I called him earlier, to see if he was free at all tomorrow to hang out and exchange gifts, and he was acting kinda weird, and it sounded like he’d been crying,” Dean explained. He was consciously omitting the almost-breakup from his retelling. No harm, no foul; and he didn’t need his family thinking poorly of Cas.
“What day is today?” Alfie asked. Dean was confused. What the hell did the date have to do with anything? And how the hell did Alfie know Dean was upset with Castiel?
Soon the apartment filled with wet sounds and dirty moans. Dean pounded into Cas, reminding him who it was he came home to. Castiel was loving this rough hallway session, and reminded himself fleetingly to let Dean catch him flirting more often.
“Next up is...Castiel and Balthazar,” she said. The two set their wine glasses down and stood in the center of the room. It was a fierce match, but Castiel just beat out Balthazar, chewing the cookie triumphantly.
When Castiel got home, he texted Dean about his safe arrival before he tried falling asleep. He tossed and turned and reprimanded himself for his actions that night. Of course, those emotions were dangerous to fall asleep to. When he finally could shut his mind off, he started into a recurring dream.
“No,” Dean barked, a little harsher than he had intended. He raised a hand in front of himself and then let it drop. He looked towards the entryway and announced, “I’m gonna go for a walk.”
Naomi seemed to chew on her cheek as she thought of what to say next. She lowered her voice so that Sam really had to strain to hear what she was saying.
“I’m sorry, Cas. I sort of...overreacted,” Dean admitted. Cas nodded and went over to the side of his bed so he could plug his phone in. He neglected to do so last night, so it had died while he was at the diner with Charlie.
When Charlie and Dean heard the front door shut and the engine to Cas' car start, Charlie shot off the couch and started yelling at Dean.
“Be my guest. It’s the door at the end of the hall there,” Balthazar directed. While his guest was using the facilities, he rounded up their glasses and placed them in the sink. He put the (considerably lighter) bottle of whiskey back in his liquor cabinet. Dean finished up and they made their way down to the garage.
, you prick,” he said, harshly poking his finger into Dean’s chest to drive his point home. Dean crowded against the vampire and took on a serious tone.
Castiel re-emerged from the bedroom, now wearing a pair of lounge pants and, “is that my shirt?” Dean asked, narrowing his eyes. He tried to look displeased, but Cas knew better than that.
“Cas? Castiel, can you hear me? Please, baby, say something,” Castiel hadn’t even noticed Dean enter the room. He just cried harder. Dean sat next to him and pulled him close. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist. Dean held him as he shook from the force of his sobs. Tears were no longer coming out of Cas' eyes. He just sat there, body spasming because it didn’t know how else to react to the news.
“I’m not seeing a good enough reason to get involved in this,” Balthazar said. Gabriel rolled his eyes.
“So are we driving to this separately?” Dean asked as he stepped out of the shower. Castiel spit his toothpaste in the sink and rinsed out his mouth.
“You asked if I was talking to my old man again,” Dean reiterated. At Castiel’s off look, he continued, “you think this is like college? You think I haven’t grown up since then, Cas?”
The smile didn’t leave Dean’s face as he made his way to the kitchen. Mary noticed her eldest son was in a much better mood. She was happy for Dean.
"Yea, ready for it to be over." Dean grumbled as he opened the door to the living quarters of the fire house. He heard Benny laugh behind him.
"Mmm...most definitely. But the real thing is so much better." Cas replied, rising up to kiss Dean again. Dean grinned into the kiss and his hand traveled down to remove Cas's offending pants. Well, technically they were Dean's but either way, he wanted them off.
“Cas!” Dean yelled, trying to get him to stop. Before Cas could get to the first step, Dean grabbed his arm. He knew it was a mistake but he didn’t know how else to stop him from leaving. Cas yanked free like he did in the classroom and snapped at Dean.
I was listening to Shiver Shiver by Walk the Moon when I wrote this, so if you wanna know the head space I was in, give it a listen!
“Mom,” Dean yelled as they clambered through the front door, “Mom!” he repeated, freaking out about the last fifteen minutes.
“Well, needless to say, you won’t be seeing him anymore. You won’t be seeing anyone. You’re not leaving this house for a long time, Castiel. You know, I have half a mind to ship you off to boarding school, but what would that prove? I’d just be providing you with a paradise of boys twenty-four-seven. I’m sure you’d love that, huh?”
“Well, I usually make breakfast on Christmas morning. The smell draws the boys out sooner or later. I think I heard Michael hop into the shower a little bit ago, but I don’t know about Castiel. He’s not much of a morning person. Not like Michael, anyway. He should be down soon all the same.”
“Anna? Where’d you run off to?” Michael's voice came from the top of the stairs. Soon enough, the older Novak brother walked into Cas' room to find his girlfriend sitting on his brother’s bed. His brother that had obviously been crying. “What’s going on?”
“What the bloody hell was that, Cassie? I demand we get that last point since he distracted us!” Balthazar argued.
While Castiel brushed his teeth in the bathroom, Balthazar changed into pajamas, and climbed into bed. When Cas was finished with his nightly routine, he returned to the main part of his room and faltered a bit.
“Uh, Alfie?” A boy asked from behind Cas' old friend. “Who's that?” The boy asked, stepping up and putting a possessive arm around his boyfriend. He eyed Cas warily.
“Or what?” Dean taunted, waggling his eyebrows for good measure. Castiel raised a single eyebrow in response. He smirked and turned on his heel, practically sashaying back to the house. Dean was frozen to the shed, only able to watch as his boyfriend strutted away. He collected himself and dashed to catch up with Cas. He caught him as he was opening the backdoor and wrapped his arms around his middle, picking Cas up. Not expecting this, Castiel let out a yelp.
to have sex with Dean? Was it the attitude from this morning creeping back up? Castiel was still in love with Dean. He still found him beyond attractive. So why didn’t he want to have sex?
“You’re perfect,” Cas whispered as he caught his breath. After a moment, he slipped out and went to get out of bed to retrieve a washcloth, but Dean stopped him.
“Yes, I do, that was embarrassing as fuck,” he said, not meeting Dean’s eye. The taller boy grabbed Cas' chin and lifted it so those blue eyes were forced to look into green ones.
“You like that?” Dean teased, tugging again. Cas planted his hands on either side of Dean’s head and grinded down hard, both of the boys very much excited about what was to come.
“So, Castiel,” Charlie started conversationally, “how do you like Kansas so far?” she asked. Castiel smiled nervously and looked down at his plate.
He was tired of this. Every time she and Cas got into an argument, he would ask what happened and she would make herself the victim. He was ashamed, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t believe her
“What about this weekend? I can have you guys come in through the back! If our plan doesn’t work out by then, we can call it,” Charlie suggested. Jo hesitated and Charlie added, “If we win, that’s more money in your pocket!”
Cas' smile was almost too wide to contain. He couldn’t believe he was actually going to do this. Balthazar was about 40 minutes out, his dad and Naomi were gone for the
“Can we please get on with it?” Dean begged. Castiel smirked and pulled the plug out completely. Not bothering to take the panties off, he kept them pushed to the side as he slipped into his boyfriend. They both moaned at the sensation, Castiel pushing all the way in before slowly gyrating his hips, grinding into Dean.
Castiel was too exhausted to retrace his footsteps. As he looked to his left, he noticed a glass of water and a couple pills on the nightstand. He hadn’t realized how thirsty he was until he saw that glass of water sitting there, begging to be drunk. He practically lunged at the glass and drank almost all of it in three huge gulps. He pulled back to breathe, and decided to take the ibuprofen that was left for him while there was still water remaining in his glass. After doing that, he realized how full his bladder was. He quickly drew back the covers and darted to the bathroom.
Just around the climax of the movie, Dean turned his head to face Cas'. He closed his eyes and leaned in and…
“We should probably get cleaned up...before my mom gets home,” Dean repeated, holding eye contact with Castiel.
Castiel made a face and defended, “It would get me away from Naomi. And I don’t know how the legal stuff will shake out. What if I have to go back there with her? Or I get sent to a-a foster home or something? At least if I take the deal, I’ll have a place to live and some money.”
Castiel didn’t last long, coming with a shout all over the wall. Dean groaned as Castiel clenched around him, spilling into Cas with one final thrust. He stayed pressed to Cas as his orgasm rocked his body.
“Oh, sorry. I was ...elsewhere. To answer your question, yes. My mom used to take my brother and me to the Lincoln Park Zoo in the summer,” he smiled at the memories of his family. Michael and he used to get along wonderfully.
“Let me see your schedule again,” Dean requested, holding out his hand for the white sheet of paper. “American Government, Psychology, College Prep., French IV?” Dean asked, “I didn’t know you could speak French”.
They made it through lunch, Dean starting to actually contribute to the conversation towards the end. He paid for both their meals as a thank you for getting him out of the house. And for putting up with him when he was like this. He did feel a lot better now that he had food in his stomach, and he wasn’t constantly worrying about Cas. Dean knew Cas would call as soon as he had any news.
“Getting drunk,” Castiel replied, “although, it’s gonna take a bit more than this,” he added on, raising his cup slightly.
“You interrupted me too!” Castiel argued. Naomi raised her hand, signaling that she would not be hearing anything else on the matter.
“What’s going on?” Bartholowmew called out, coming out of his bedroom and heading towards the commotion.
In the lobby, Dean watched as Naomi left with an officer. He connected the dots and jumped into action. He had to go see Cas. Before he could get too far, Mary stopped him.
of the single cards. So if Benny laid down an ace, I could lay down a pair of threes to keep it going. Y’understand?"
“Yeah, and Charlie caught me undressing you in my head about a dozen times,” Dean complained, hand finding purchase in Castiel’s unruly dark hair.
“I am,” Bartholomew said. Castiel slowly let out a breath, his brow remaining dry for the time being. He didn’t know what he would’ve done if his father had planned to be home all weekend. “You’re not planning on throwing a party while we’re out of town, are you?” Bartholomew joked. Castiel laughed a bit nervously.
“Uhh,” Dean chimed in, “Sam overheard your dad and Naomi talking in the lobby a little bit ago. He said she mentioned a tracking device?”
Balthazar passed it to Gabe, who managed to score eight points. It would’ve been nine, but he accidentally tilted the phone up instead of down, so they had to pass that word even though Gabriel had guessed it. They tried reasoning with the other team to let them have the point anyway, but they would never give Gabriel the satisfaction. Castiel and Charlie realized this fairly quickly and stopped pleading for the point.
Castiel was confused. Wouldn't Charlie want to sit next to Dean? When he looked over at her, she had a smug grin on her face. Were Dean and she in a fight? Was this some kind of punishment for Dean? Castiel was growing more uncomfortable by the second. That was when his phone decided to go off, alerting him of an incoming text.
“Just write down what you want, dude! You’re so gungho about wanting her, but did you picture a wedding at all? Like an honest to god wedding with alter and all that?”
In the other Winchester room, lazy kisses are being traded back and forth until a distinctive engine rumbles to life. Quickly Alexa jumps to the window. Throwing her jacket and boots she heads outside ignoring Sam calling after her.
“Dammit Cas, I know you’re up to something. And Alexa keeps asking me if my coat is warm enough, if I heard any good music lately. You two aren’t the subtle twins.”
She sighs into the embrace, “fine. But what do you know? I thought I was the one Cas goes to for the girl talk.”
His lip quirks slightly at the corner, “you’ll make a fine Winchester, you’ve already got the lingo down.”
When the final head is thrown in, Cas and Alexa share a smile. It’s then Mary turns to Sam with her mom-voice, “Samuel William Winchester,” both brothers’ eyes widen at the use of his full name, “you need to marry that girl,” to which he groans and Dean doubles over laughing. “What,” she asks confused.
Alexa sits there for a moment playing with her phone as she hears the water turn on. She hasn’t really talked to Sam since they left, and after finding out how the brothers lied to her, she doesn’t really feel like speaking with him. She tosses it near the pillows and unzips her bag. Suddenly she’d much rather sleep, so she pulls out the t-shirt and shorts, setting the duffle beside the bed, she decides to just undress and get ready for bed. She can shower in the morning. Alexa doesn’t even notice the water turning off as she crawls into bed and turns the tv on. She’s flipping through the limited channels when Dean walks back out, drying his hair.
“He’s fine Alexa. I’m just going to get ‘provisions’ as he called them. Do you and Sam need anything as well?”
Dean sighs and sits across from him, “dude, I get it, but if you really want this, it shouldn’t be that hard.”
“Come with me,” he stands and holds out his hand which Lex takes. Dean leads her to the kitchen where Sam and Cas seem to have ended their conversation.
Dean waits for him to get out of ear shot and then smirks, getting up to go to his own room. On his way out he kisses the back of Alexa’s head, “thanks for the cookies. Night.” He steals a couple more, ‘for Cas’, and walks to his room. “Hey Cas,” he opens the door and explains his plan.
She fills the glass again and takes a few sips, “fuuuuuckkk,” she says softly to the empty room. Finishing her glass again, she returns to Sam, prepaid to at least try to tell him something. Instead she finds him softly snoring with her pillow clenched to his chest. She settles in and kisses the top of his head, “night Sweetie. I’m sorry.”
Sam chokes out a laugh, “Yeah, well, it’s that or drink until we’re distracted enough to not worry. Pretty sure you’d need two liquor stores for that.” Cas sighs and walks back into the bunker with Sam.
“What? Oh god, Sam, that is not what I meant. And what I said about not bringing up a certain subject, that extends to the argument over said subject too.”
“I know. The next day we spent ignoring each other, which is impressive considering we always seemed to be in the same room,” Dean smirks, “what?”
“I can’t do it anymore,” his eyes go wide but she keeps talking, “I love him, you know that. And I know he loves me, I’m not going anywhere,” Dean lets out a held breath, “but, I, I told him to not bring up the wedding, in any form, to me, until he knows what he wants, even if that means no wedding at all. I can’t take the back and forth anymore.”
“Like I said, it’s not that hard Sam. Unless there was something stopping you. And that something would have to be yourself because otherwise you’d fight the son of a bitch.”
“Yeah, think so babe,” Alexa turns to him with a bright smile. She sees his apprehension and steps over to wrap her arms around his waist, “We’ll be fine, Sam. Take care of yourself and we’ll call if we need anything, ok?”
“Hold up, ‘A’ as in Alexa? That’s- What? Seriously?” Dean can hardly believe this is about the same woman that smiled and made donuts, which are currently forming a knot in his stomach, beside his angel last night. There’s gotta be some kind of catch here. “Who sent this?”
“You going to tell me maybe it isn’t about where we end the story? Maybe we make it about where we began, so long as it’s together?”
The girl looked Castiel up and down, more in awe of his outfit than the fact he’d appeared in thin air right behind her. “Is that a trench coat? I saw one in a museum once.” She looked back at Dean then back to Castiel. “Wait, you two do this dressing up thing as like.... a coupley thing? That’s adorable. Is there a club? Are there more of you?” She looked back between the beer and Dean and back again. “I think I’m drunk?”
“You’re going to be fine.” His voice was soothing on its own, but Dean suspected Cas was influencing things a little further than that. “Why don’t you go home?”
Chuck scoffed and drew a few more glugs from his bottle. “Sure, sure. Me, an Academy winning screenwriter, making up forests. Why not.”
“Because he, I,  couldn’t have you,” Castiel put simply. It was undoubtedly more complicated than that, but Castiel didn’t have it within his mind to work through the minutia. “Because I wanted to feel a connection with someone. But wanted to be free to be with you.”
“I… we… can’t keep expecting this of him,” Castiel’s voice cracked slightly. “We’re all he has, and we’re too busy to see him.”
“I hoped… I hoped,” Dean turned and buried his face in the pillow again. “That you kept ordering, I thought might mean something. But you do seem to really enjoy pizza.”
Dean had locked himself away in his back office when Sam turned up to Friday drinks. He hadn’t been in a few Fridays, but Dean always seemed to understand. That was Sam’s memory of their interactions. Sam feared sometimes he was slowly losing his grip on what Earth was, what being human was. Ruling the demons felt somehow increasingly
Sam wanted to protest, but as he moved his hips slightly he could already feel where the pressure was going to lead to an ache. He followed Castiel to the bed, tugging of his own clothes as he went.
His heart, spirit, and (to his small grumble) cock all leapt when the doorbell finally rung at 1 pm.
“The cheese and green onion waffles are my favorite.” Garth stretched back and rubbed his stomach. “Though I wouldn’t say no to some more of those little cakes.”
Dean sighed. “Right, right. Well, breakfast first. And then after that we’re going to go to the hardware store, pick up a few things, and I’ll teach you how to replace the glass.”
“We're mostly going to be responsible for the centauricorns, that's our specialism,” Charlie explained to Dean. “Other effects will go to other companies to deal with, depending on their specialty.”
“Three fingers from my right hand,” Castiel said, wiggling those slightly. “And now two from my left. You, Dean, are a very good boy.”
The joy of seeing a seed germinate and turn into a small sapling had awakened in him something he thought he’d lost. And it wasn’t that Dean was suddenly going to turn down Castiel’s cock or the chance to be tied up and suspended for a little while, all of that made him feel so happy and comfortable now. But the garden… the garden…
, was what Castiel wanted to say, but it felt too mushy. It was hard not to feel himself falling even more for Dean after scenes like the one he’d just witnessed.
Sam gather from the smirk on Castiel’s face he was missing some joke. With a half-hearted laugh Sam picked up his phone. It was hard to feel rude when Castiel had been half paying attention to his emails since they’d sat down.
“Were too.” Dean kissed him on the nose. “Most awesome boyfriend ever. You could forget birthdays, anniversaries and everything like that the rest of our lives and I’d find nothing to complain about after this day.”
“Ellen was the Jones' bros mother's sister, Billie was her wife,” Donna informed Castiel. “The story went that they met while working for the FBI and fell in love. And then they leave the service together when their nephews' were orphaned. So they adopt the nephews and from there on it was cinematic gold.”
Feeling sad and lonelier than he could ever remember being, Dean curled up on the sofa and called his brother.
“You know hair color has nothing to do with personality, right?” Sam carefully spun his fork to get some of the noodles on it.
In the end he text him and tried not to pity himself too much when Castiel replied to say he was busy. He suggested the following Sunday though, if Sam was free. That made Sam feel slightly better.
“Six out of the ten of us so far, honey,” a Castiel told him softly as he pulled out, cock spent and moist. “How much cum is in here?” He ran his thumb around the stretched out hole, enjoying the wonderful softness.
“It just felt good,” Sam stuttered. It hadn’t been a big deal. A little comfort from a stranger in the night when he’d most needed it. A new friend, a new shoulder to lean on. “I forgave you for the prom date thing years ago, Dean. This had nothing to do with that.”
“I shouldn’t say anything but…” he sighed and looked at the ceiling for help. “Dean, past me, you need to look into the people who originally had these time traveling charms. In the present timeline they are causing havoc and we can’t work out how to stop them.”
It was really more poor Eileen who had to put up with Sam being cranky over his disturbed sleep. Yeah, they might be loud, but Dean found it difficult to care while he was busy being so happy. He’d bought Sam a pair of noise-canceling headphones – what else was there for it?
Dean laughed and ruffled Sam's hair. “Sure, Sammy. They're probably all over you to hear about your Hollywood film career.”
“Eileen,” Sam coughed. “How are you…” he tried again to reach out. His arm responded but the movement was sluggish and hard. As his pupils grew used to the light, he could see they were in some sort of cave.
“You heard what Claire said, that they wanted to keep us a bit unhappy. When they tried to give us everything we wanted we didn’t believe it was real and woke up.”
“You should rub your cock against the bark,” Castiel suggested in a manner that Dean would take as a command. He’d made the bark rougher than nature ever intended. It would go someway to grating the sensitive skin of Dean’s cock, leaving him raw, sore and definitely shivering in pain later when Castiel took Dean in his mouth.
Dean debated telling Sam what Castiel had said, but then he'd have to explain the whole thing, and he didn't want more people than necessary knowing how dumb he'd been in picking this particular film.
“I’ve been coming here for fifteen years nearly and you don’t seem to have aged a day, Dean Winchester.”
“I’m sorry about your shirt.” Castiel nodded to the vomit, most of which Dean had sponged off at some point.
“I sent a message to ask if you wanted to get lunch, but I was told you were at home today. Hannah said she hadn’t seen you in a while? I wanted to go over the soul numbers for the next quarter.”
“Cas?” Dean moved so he was sitting a little closer to Castiel who now looked like he was in some level of pain.
Castiel held tighter onto the warm body next to him, hoping that maybe, just maybe the kids would quieten down if he pretended things were okay.
“Hiya Sammy.” He tried to inject his voice with a level of fake enthusiasm so Sam wouldn't know something was wrong.
“He’s just jealous he doesn’t have you and your magical fingers,” Dean assured Castiel. “Cas, oh Cas, fuck, Cas!”
Castiel blinked. “The food? But all these people taking off clothes, indulging you in your favorite kink and--”
“Before you came along, I didn’t think anyone could ever make this feel as good as it does when I do it to myself.”
They were at another production meeting, their second after the failed first attempt. Key actors, Chuck, and Bela Talbot (who was there on behalf of the studio), were all sat around a large table.
“They'll just get another writer,” Dean shrugged. “If it ends up really bad, the studio will push it down and the only people who will know about it after release are the weirdos who buy straight to DVD kinda films,” Dean said, trying to sound matter of fact about the whole thing.
Time was slowly counting down until the big movie premiere. Within the next 48 hours Dean had to introduce Castiel to his family, but more worryingly, he'd have to finally sit through a screening of the movie.
“Possibly,” he smiled back. There wouldn’t be anyway to ever tell, unless they all came in separate vials and measured, but that would detract from Dean getting his fresh cream pie.
“You were so well behaved. But you always are.” Castiel leaned down to kiss Dean on the top of his head. “Hello, Sam. What brings you here?”
Someone from the studio had apologized on Chuck's behalf. They also advised that the studio wanted to do something else with the script so to expect changes.
It had been a weird few months, but maybe... maybe it was destined to happen so that he could be here, at this moment in time, with Castiel right beside him.
“You could just not do it,” Dean pointed out. He understood why Sam added so many levels of bureaucracy back to Hell. Crowley would be proud in a way at how Sam had turned things around to bring order, annual appraisals, daily agendas, and self-reflection worksheets for the demons.
“As it has been, Castiel Ten, in this case me, usually talks first. We know we have three hours to achieve our goal: get Dean fucked as many times as possible. We’ve all done this before, apart from Castiel One. You’ll soon pick up on how things go. And remember, there is just one rule: we are not to talk about anything from our times. We are here to fuck Dean, not mess up the space–time continuum.”
His lower lip was shaking slightly. Castiel wanted to pull Dean to him, comfort him, but Dean needed this time to process things. Eventually Dean nodded. “More than okay. I’d really, really like that, Cas. If you think it will work, and if you’re comfortable with it. I don’t want you to feel obligated.”
Sam stretched and looked over at Castiel. He was sat in the rickety chair, already dressed in the clothes he’d had on the night before.
“Well so the final film would deal with the emotional fall out of all that. If we ever did another, I'm sure they'd find a way to bring their characters back.”
“It is a big movie,” Castiel continued, “and we've not yet seen the finished article ourselves, but even without all the computer generated add-ons, I am already sure this will stand as the proudest piece of work I've been in. A marvel for our times, and a film people will be watching for years to come.”
“This place is pretty cool though. It was worth coming here to see. Feels exactly like it was from the early 2000s. That’s kind of my aesthetic.”
Pie wasn’t really his thing but Sam didn’t want to be the awkward one out. He would have taken the grapefruit segments.
In the back of his mind Sam was thinking about times in the past. Times he wouldn’t have dared ask this of Dean. When his first question would have been
. Like I'm not just this awkward man who has never managed to settle down. As if my experiences actually have meaning.”
There was a warmth in his chest that he’d been missing in recent years as he thought of Jess. He wasn’t ever going to say he was thankful to the monsters that set this all up – they easily could have died while the world around them were destroyed – but he did feel something like closure. The other world showed Sam that even if he and Jess had made it, nothing would have guaranteed they would have been happy forever, nothing would have promised that–
“Yeah well, go to Poland. Go find your man. And you can name your first born after me as a thank you.”
The pizza went uneaten in the end, left cold and still in its box on his kitchen counter. Castiel’s hunger, he'd soon concluded, hadn’t been a desire for food after all.
“I can’t imagine it would. The people who previously owned the relic were interacting with previous versions of themselves to assist in their various robberies. We’d need a day when Sam would be gone – I don’t want to have him lecturing us about this being crazy.”
“I couldn’t see you suffer any longer. We returned you to a younger form of yourself, to help you. You really will have to run the bar, I don’t think your back could have taken it previously.” Castiel looked a little guilty.
Sam sat back and observed happily as Dean and Castiel talked. He caught his mom’s eye at one point and she smiled, laughing a little with a small head nod in the direction of each of Dean and Castiel.
“She’s fostered kids for years though. Most recent two, Alex and Claire,” Dean chuckled. “They’re wild things, but damn, they’re great kids. Alex isn’t really a kid anymore, I suppose. Claire’s going to be 18 soon.”
“I think I got a differential diagnosis for a tummy ache and bright green throw up,” Dean said with a laugh, not seeming to care that he was covered in the contents of Jack’s stomach. “Jack,” Dean asked him calmly, “did you eat the whole gummy bear already?”
“I suspect they were in fact not truly children. If they’d used the device enough over the years, it is possible they are caught in some kind of time flux and are not aging at a normal speed for humans.”
“Goodbye, Castiel Ten.” Dean stood to kiss him on the cheek, aware of the cum dribbling down his thighs.
“I–” Dean took another deep breath. “Not funny.” He took an accusatory finger at Castiel. “Not funny at all.”
“No one has ever done centaurs before,” Bela Talbot explained to the assembled group. “We want to do with centaurs what
Castiel placed a hand over his own mouth and used it to muffle a bitter laugh. “Wouldn’t that have been nice?”
“Unfortunately not,” said Castiel. “But I’m not sure their intents were… malicious. They seemed more like collectors. Curious about angels and the supernatural. We talked for a time after I finally caught up with them, before they escaped.
Castiel put the rest back in his bag and turned round to find Sam kneeling on the floor in front of him. Sam took the opportunity to fist Castiel’s cock, preparing it for the condom. Sam tried to work fast but with a confident manner, very self-conscious of how long it had been since he’d last been the one putting the condom on another person.
“I've had so many offers since it was publicly released in the US.” Dean felt a little guilty he hadn't told Castiel this yet.
The perfect tree for lovers, Castiel had thought while he’d twisted and tied the rope around Dean’s wrists earlier. The drooping branches gave them extra privacy against the outside world too – not that there was much that could interrupt them out there beyond the literal birds and bees.
Castiel hung up the phone. His mouth was dry and his heart beat erratic. He also was as hard as the wooden chair he was sat on. Lately Castiel had found himself going through lubricant like it was water. Both were just as necessary in Castiel's mind at this point. Without the lube he'd have rubbed himself raw masturbating to the thought of the faceless handyman that tempted his dreams every night.
“You can go through to the dining room now. Food’s about done. Can I get you boys anything to drink?”
“It isn't like this when I'm in class,” Sam told Dean after. “At least not now the original shock has worn off for most the kids.”
“We normally identify as a number, depending how many times we’ve done this before,” one of the Castiels explained. “I would be Castiel Ten, as this is my tenth time.”
Castiel pulled his garment back on. It reminded Dean of a robe, but somehow the material closed up along Castiel’s front as each side seemed to turn liquid and merge, becoming one, seamless piece of fabric. Some new invention Dean hadn’t really bothered to follow, though he did vaguely recognized from the little time he spent watching TV between eating, sleeping and having sex with Cas.
“So you don’t want me to be more direct?” Dean pulled forwards, one hand coming off the headboard so he could touch Castiel’s shoulder.
“Sam is still on his case I believe, and we do need to catalog the items we find, but yes, I would like to grope and make out with you in the storage room.”
Swirling his tongue around the top of Castiel's cock once more, Dean also took the opportunity to yank on Cas' balls.
Dean hadn’t even heard him come in. He wasn’t meant to just appear into the bar like that as sometimes it freaked out the visitors.
“That’s understandable, Dean. I’m not feeling completely myself again yet either.” Castiel looked down and could see Dean’s cock was still pretty hard, outlined nicely in the pajamas he had on. “Though…”
“You made this area larger, right?” Sam asked Castiel, halfway through the tour of the dry-climate section.
“I am so sorry, man. Here, I'll take it off.” He started to pull his arms through and went to lift it up when Castiel placed a hand on his chest stopping him.
Dean looked over and rolled his eyes. “You know I’m kidding, right? You can stay as long as you like. I owe you that much. We can be in our sixties and still livin’ together. Wouldn’t that just be swell?”
Dean's soul had never felt so well nourished before. For the first time in a while, he didn't spend every other moment wondering about his future, because all he wanted to do was exist in the then and there. Looking to the future just meant looking to Castiel leaving, and Dean didn't want to start thinking about that.
Sam could only guess at what both the other men before him were thinking. This whole situation had clearly been years in the making from what Castiel had told him.
After another energetic round of sex, which ended with them both messy and muscles hurting in strangely pleasing ways, they both decided to take a shower again. They eventually managed to get themselves clean, after probably the longest shower of Castiel's life. They couldn't seem to stop touching each other, keen to learn about the other on every level.
"Great! And then after, could you can clean the pool like normal? Really get in there, especially around the rim. Where the fallen plant matter hasn’t been cleaned up I’m afraid it might be a little worse than normal."
“Hey, I resent that,” Sam added to the conversation as he entered the bar and sat down next to Castiel. “They aren’t all dicks.”
“Then how do you know?” Dean asked, curious. “How do you know?” Dean prompted again, starting to get suspicious.
“What we think is exciting,” Bela continued, ignoring Chuck, “is that in our version, we're going for a more... naturalistic centauricorn.”
They hugged tighter, Dean breathing in Castiel's now familiar scent, letting it sooth and empower him.
“Well, it was that or… you don’t want to know what Dean had planned for our session if I hadn’t distracted him with this.”
Dean nodded silently, body shaking slightly now from the strain on his toes. He loved being bound in a way that forced him onto his tiptoes, and Castiel did so love obliging Dean’s needs.
Dean sat up at this and scooted around so he was facing Castiel. “Okay, we must have rattled your brain or something because the Castiel I know wouldn’t suggest using a powerful angelic relic for the purposes of
“I don’t know.” It was the honest truth. Sam didn’t think he could pin it down to one issue. “Systematic failure to communicate?” Sam ran a finger along the glass, drawing wavy lines in the condensation. “Have you ever been in love with an ex?”
“I sorta want to run to the airport right now and stop Cas from leaving on that plane,” he admitted, taken aback by the stupidity of his own thoughts.
Dean opened the book and started looking through, getting lost in the text. He looked up after a moment, suddenly realizing he was sitting with Castiel still. “Sorry, I’ll read it later… that was rude.” Dean blushed.
commandments. They’d set it up so no one questioned why Dean never went outside. So no one outside questioned why the building was there. No one would ever try to knock it down for redevelopment, or even build too close to it.
It’d been nearly thirty-seven years since Sam took control of Hell, and twenty since Castiel became de facto leader of Heaven. Dean had grown used to mostly being alone, while his brother and… well, whatever Castiel was to him these days, were busy keeping their universe whole. Cas had been due a visit the previous month. Dean hadn’t been holding his breath he’d actually make it. The way time worked between the realms was weird enough anyway, but coupled with the fact that the longer Sam and Cas spent away, the less important to them Earth seemed to be, meant Dean saw them less and less.
He was nervous. From his perspective he was very clear on what he was happy to let happen tonight. What he was still unclear about was Castiel's expectations. Part of Dean thought Castiel might actually have just come for coffee. Which Dean would have been fine with, but that didn't stop the butterflies growing in his stomach.
Dean moved down to take off Castiel's condom, tying it up and chucking it in the bin. He moved the sheets so they could both get under and then curled into Castiel's side.
“Are you tempted by any of them?” Castiel had no hint in his voice as to if he thought this was a good or bad thing.
The twins were so perfectly behaved when they went shopping for the presents Castiel bought them both a treat. Their exemplary behavior lasted into the evening too when they were both ready for bed before Dean had even arrived. Castiel let them stay up long enough to say hi to Dean before bed.
“And then to keep you compliant, he put you under, pumped you full of that weird gloopy, orange stuff we found, and let you go on dreaming.”
“Yeah, yeah, I can.” Dean slid off the table he’d been sat off, looked around for his keys. His hand hovered over them before he looked guiltily up at Sam.
Dean dropped the glass he was holding. It didn't shatter, but he wished it had just to give him something to focus on.
Thursday arrived at a crawl. At times Castiel was certain the world was teasing him by creating invisible hours to slow down the progress of the week. His novel was coming along well though and he was very pleased with the scene involving cream, edible glitter, and six ice cubes.
Eventually, Bela moved onto other journalists, who had far more interest in the other actors, much to Dean's great relief.
“Well,” Bela explained, “If your script has a green cover, you're a human, if you have a blue cover, you're now a centauricorn.”
There was regret, so much regret, when he looked at so many of the gathered angels. The group who had agreed to help him rebuild Heaven. The group who were aiming to make him leader of them all.
Dean sat back and licked his lips. “In the dream world I was still thinking about kissing you way too much. Even if none of it was real,” Dean scratched the back of his neck, looking flush in the face. He swallowed and tried again. “Even if it wasn’t real, Cas, I still wanted you to be with me. And I don’t just mean for sex, I mean… everything.”
“Well, Garth. By naturalistic, we mean, we've decided to put on show some tasteful naturalism. The human body and beast as they would be in nature, without clothes. We want to separate ourselves from Disney in this regard, make this a more raw take on the centauricorn than anyone else would dare do.”
If Castiel was prone to gasping, he would have. “You really don’t need anyone but me,” he stated slowly.
“We’ve got to wrap things up soon,” Castiel Ten reminded everyone. “The time devices will only keep us here for the next 15 minutes before we’re dragged back to our own time.”
“Goodnight, boys.” Mary kissed them each on the cheek, including Castiel, before she took to Dean’s spare room to sleep.
“Anyway, enough about me and my life, tell me about yourself?” Castiel asked, taking a delicate sip of coffee.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at this. “We have a whole kissing scene? I had to film that one about twelve times pretending some person dressed all in blue was you.”
“Or,” Dean interjected, leaning across the bar on his elbows to put himself as close to Castiel as possible. “You could quit your job instead of doing appraisals let someone else take over Heaven.”
"You okay there, Dean?" Sam propped himself on his forearms to look over the bar and see Dean swoop down to pick up the somehow still-whole glass.
“Maybe I should start doing appraisals,” Castiel pondered. “It’d be a good way to tell them all how they need improving and get their feedback on how things are going.”
Jack slowly looked up and gave Dean such a look of open admiration Cas felt his heart grow two sizes.
When Friday swung around Sam thought about calling up Castiel to see if he was free. Just for a drink would have been a nice evening, but Sam’s resolve to not sleep with Castiel again was wavering even in his own mind. Just because he didn’t want to date the guy didn’t mean they couldn’t have fun. And they had definitely had fun together.
“Oh God, ohhhhh God yes,” Dean played along, back arching slightly, head coming up off the pillow. Sure, the muscles in his thighs in places were starting to cramp up, but he’d put up with that for hours if it meant more of this. More of this sensation of feeling so safe, yet so connected to someone he knew loved him.
“What?” Castiel said, confused. He turned on the bed to face Dean. “No 'but'. I liked it... I really liked it,” he added shyly.
“Listen, Sammy, we’ll get you moved back. It might feel shitty right now, but six months from now, you’re going to look back and see this was just first step to a new phase in your life.”
It didn’t seem to Sam to be the kind of thing Dean’s ex Cassie would say, but Sam realized he hadn’t known her very long. Dean hadn’t even dated her very long either. If dating was even the right term for what the two of them had gotten up to. A series of one night stands with breakfast sometimes was probably more apt.
“HEY!” Dean shouted out. “Go away!” He stumbled a little on his tiptoes, unbalanced by Sam’s sudden appearance.
“We have that time travel device in the storeroom now. We could use it to bring multiple versions of me into one time point.”
. He wasn’t meant to live to 80, but he had. Castiel and Sam would live forever, in control, busy and respected by those they led.
In the end the three of them filmed four, maybe five separate possible endings to the film – it wasn't clear. Dean started to wonder if he was living in a nightmare. He pinched himself after having to do thirty takes speaking to a green ball on a stick, which was meant to be his co-star, Castiel.
“Nnnngggg,” Dean grumbled, reaching out with a hand to feel for his phone. He knew he had to stop the noise and that it was his phone causing it. Answering the call on instinct, Dean found himself talking to his Uncle Bobby.
“And then I tell everyone on Zeely how much I love it, and then suddenly others are coming to try it. The circle continues. The drink sucks, but no one wants to admit they spent so much on something sucky.”
“I have too,” Castiel protested, “and I’ve picked up enough from you to be able to hold my own in a conversation, Dean.”
“It’s cool if you want to stay.” He didn’t want to ask Castiel to stay, didn’t want to pressure him. He did want him to stay though. “We got the room for the night, and I told my, ahem, roommate I wouldn’t be back tonight.”
“With you I never feel obligated. I want to do this for you, and for us. I’d spend the rest of my life trying to give you all the pleasure you deserve, if only you’d let me.”
“That’s… that’s true,” Castiel gasped slightly. “I don’t think the other me enjoyed all the one-time-only sex.”
He was introduced to Charlie and Ash, the special effects geniuses who were going to be fixing up all the computer generated stuff.
It was, Dean reflected, a question he himself had wondered, but hadn't dared ask for fear of offending Castiel.
“I can pick up some groceries tomorrow if you leave me a list,” Sam offered. It would give him something to do instead of worrying about how much he didn’t want to do the presentation for his second interview. The list was essential since Dean was apparently such a homemaker now and Sam didn’t want to be caught out buying the wrong kind of flour.
Castiel Two went next and was taking a very different approach to his predecessors and seemed determined to
By the end of the shoot six weeks later, Dean was probably at his heaviest weight ever, and finding it hard to care. Wardrobe hadn't dared complain more than once about having to refit the three after the telling off they got from Jody about the pressures placed on actors.
Dean bit his lip and hissed a little when Castiel took advantage of the slightly chilled air and tweaked his own right nipple.
“Alex did. She’s getting pretty good at it. She wanted to learn so she can bribe the other hospital staff.”
“And shall we start with... you?” Bela pointed towards a lady in the center of the room Dean knew all too well. A helper with a microphone raced over.
“Very kinky: it’s about two guys who are madly in love and often indulged in a lot of sex. And, get this! They have a shared bank account too. They spend weekends grocery shopping, picking out new towels, arguing over the best color for their new towels, and taking long walks through parks while holding hands.”
“Not today, at least,” Sam pleaded. Not today, not on the day they were meant to be remembering their dad.
When Castiel was starting to feel like he could take no more, he maneuvered one hand free to grip Dean's weeping erection.
Dean nodded in agreement. “Yeah, I’d like to get back soon, too.” Dean dropped onto his bed with a small
"It's mostly the hedges and bushes I need trimmed,” Castiel explained as he gestured to the plants in question. “My old gardener retired and I'm afraid I let it all turn into a mess lately, as you’ve probably noticed. The grass needs a good mowing. A few of the vegetable beds will need to be plowed and seeded deep – but that can wait for now. I have a sit on mower and other tools in the yellow shed. I can take you back there later, show you the ropes."
A couple of hours (and several orgasms) later, they were cuddled up on their bed. Dean always insisted there wasn’t a big spoon and little spoon in their cuddling arrangement. No, they were jet-pack and pilot. Castiel was fond of this arrangement as it afforded him the opportunity to expand some of the protective energy he always felt over Dean. When he was holding Dean in his arms in bed, snuggled up as they were, it always felt a bit like he could keep Dean safe forever.
It was almost a shame Castiel felt like he was in a position of authority over Dean, or he would try harder to be friends with the younger man. They had plenty in common, especially their love of fiction books. Dean was very well read, which pleased Castiel greatly.
“It wasn’t meant to last for all eternity,” Castiel added, voice strained. “None of this was supposed to last as long as it has.”
“I do know that. They didn't even have an ending for the film. We had to film a couple and they're basically making the whole thing up in editing.”
Castiel ran his thumbs against the tips of his fingers, remembering briefly the feel of Dean’s skin as he’d helped him to bed.
“You’re not angry with Sam, you’re angry with me. Even though you know I’ve not been chaste, this is different because it is with someone you know. You’re being forced to confront that sometimes I do have sex.”
Sitting in Jody's trailer at the end of their first week, the three of them commiserated each other.
tempting. In the last few weeks since filming had been completed, he'd done nothing but indulge himself. Stopping for a coffee seemed like a perfect treat. Well, at the time. Now, bladder full of coffee, he had to sprint to the room he'd been pointed towards. Looking quickly through the rack, Dean grabbed a soft-looking orange t-shirt. Pulling his current shirt off, and yanking the other on, he sprinted (with direction given by harassed looking staff) to the waiting area behind the stage.
“It isn’t up to us to fix him,” Sam said, looking up from the notes he’d written as Castiel sat down opposite him.
“Nooo,” Dean whined. “No, just like it when you’re doing it for me, me alone. When I know after there will be cuddling.”
Sam shuddered. He was happy for them, he really was but he still picked up a crutch from the porch for added stability and set off towards town to kill some hours. And more importantly, get away from ever having to hear Dean’s orgasm moan. Besides, he had to think up what to say to Eileen next time he saw her.
“To beef up the production budget. Claim it was all for the sake of the environment. Shooting in a real forest would have cost a tenth of what it will to put it all in digitally.”
There was always a moment in every one of their films when one of them would be in peril and the other brother would cry over them. The fact they were brothers in reality seemed to give the situation an added depth of emotion. It was sort of their trademark in the films.
“I’m sorry I haven’t been here much for things like this,” Sam rushed to say. And he was sorry he’d felt so much like he’d left Dean to deal with the fall out of everything that was their dad dying. Even just the practicalities of sorting his bank accounts and going through his clothes had been left entirely to Dean. It had been a turning point for his brother, Sam felt.
