but for all they called the Men of Letters glorified librarians, they still sucked at collecting the right books, too. At some point, maybe a little after eleven, Sam called it a night and told Dean he should get some rest. Dean just waved him off, knowing full well there’d be no sleep for him even if he tried. Might as well use his restlessness for good right? After all, they’ve got work to do.
Its inhabitants didn’t know all of the pieces to the gruesome puzzle, but they knew enough. They knew the chamber was their last line of defense against the monster on the prowl. The monster they helped create, the one who surpassed them all and became his own beast. The monster currently out for their heads. For
himself stung tight, ready to spring into action. But this was just Benny. Benny wouldn’t hurt him. Dean knew that, and yet he couldn’t seem to relax. He felt like he could tear the whole world apart with his bare hands and he wanted to scream at Benny to run, to get away, to keep his distance so he wouldn’t get hurt, but he couldn’t move.
The third day, they arrived at the town just before nightfall, the previous night pretty much forgotten by Benny. Dean still remembered because judging by the way Cas glared at him, he remembered too. Even so, hearing of the Hellspawn in town both put them on their guard and lent them cause to celebrate. They finally found the Hellspawn, after all.
“Have you really never had to track someone to capture or assassinate them before me?” Cas went silent and sat up straighter in his saddle. Dean deflated a little at the sight, realizing that in letting Cas tag along to track down the Hellspawn, he not only put a target on his back, but would put Cas at risk of becoming a creature like him. Dean tried to console himself by reminding himself that Cas wouldn’t be the first person he dragged through the mud with him and he probably wouldn’t be the last. It almost worked. Almost.
Cas remained silent where he stood, watching. A little too silent, perhaps. Dean delivered one final debilitating blow to ensure Zachariah wouldn’t be able to get away for a few minutes, if ever. Crossing the distance between them, Dean held out his hands to hold Cas’ but decided against it. His hands were covered in blood that wasn’t his own. “Are you okay, Cas?” Dean asked, trying not to sound too worried but also trying to compel Cas to answer him honestly.
He sat there, in the alley, for way longer than was necessary. He could walk just fine. His head didn’t hurt all that bad. He should go get Baby and make camp as far outside of town as he could get before he needed to pass out. He couldn’t, though. For whatever reason, he just couldn’t bring himself to get up.
After he’d finished, Benny let out a low whistle before falling silent. “Shit, Dean,” he finally said. “I, uh. I think you best go apologize.”
per se, but the wood paneling was in fairly good shape and there wasn’t any blood on the walls. Granted, Dean’s only standard for a home base was Hell, so his judgement was fairly skewed.
“Of course.” Dean couldn’t help but smile at how willing the kid seemed to help, but stopped the second he realised
At that, Castiel smiled ever so slightly and wrapped a hand around his cock to line himself up. Dean was so distracted by the way his hand looked so beautiful, fingers so long and slender, that it wasn’t until Castiel was about to push in that he gasped out, “Wait, hold on.” Castiel looked at him, questioning, and instead of actually answering, Dean grabbed Castiel’s other wrist and pulled his hand to his mouth. Castiel got the hint and slipped two of his fingers into Dean’s mouth, letting him suck and swirl his tongue around the digits. As much as he wanted Castiel to fuck him, he still whined when Castiel withdrew his fingers and shoved them roughly up his ass.
for his mother, a woman who had two young boys and almost her entire life ahead of her. As if that wasn’t enough, he killed Cas just to get at Dean. He was simply another useless life, collateral damage.
Three weeks later, Sam sat across from him, feet propped up on the table, sipping on a bottle of cheap beer and scrolling through something on his laptop. Dean could hear some ad play an obnoxious pop song and he ignored it at first, in favor of the thick tome he scanned for any mention of the Empty or the Shadow or how to open a door to another cosmic plane. Eventually, it got to be too distracting and he snapped, “Why don’t you get some earbuds or turn the volume down.
“Benny. You sure your friend here’s gonna be okay with me taggin’ along?” Benny shook Dean’s hand, glancing warily at Cas.
The guy groaned as he woke up with Dean pinning him to the bed, knife at his throat, and Dean repeated himself. “Where did they go?”
I didn’t know all that at the time. Zachariah just told me they were sinners, and needed to be put down. When I saw what they did to them, I thought, somehow, they knew. I only told Gabriel about- about
Dean can’t read the look on Cassie’s face, but it turns out he doesn’t need to. She breaks into a grin, looking back and forth between the two of them. “I’m so happy for you. Both of you. So, Cas, how the hell did Dean convince you he was a real keeper?”
me but it meant…” Dean took two long pulls from his beer, wishing it were something stronger. As if anything could get him drunk enough for this. “He told me-”
He snuck back into his own room early in the morning, just before the sun started to rise, and dozed off for a few more hours in his own bed. The sheets were cold from having gone unused during the night, and they were stained with substances Dean didn’t even want to guess at. The bed was comfy, though. It was enough.
The sun beat down on Dean’s neck and he had a feeling he’d be sunburnt by midday if they didn’t make it to some shade soon. He debated telling Cas to stop after about an hour, but sure enough, a town soon came into view and Dean sighed in relief. Towns meant places to go and people who weren’t (rightfully) pissed at him to talk to and hotels with real beds to sleep in and places to properly bathe. Oh, how Dean missed real civilization.
“-horse --” Dean was cut off by Cas shoving his head underwater and holding it for a couple seconds. He shoved Cas off, spitting water and pouting, “Shit, man, what if I’d drowned?”
“Speaking of which,” Sam interrupted before the silence could grow too awkward, “what, exactly, just happened?”
They turned down another hallway and, sure enough, it, too was barren. Castiel visibly relaxed, his grip on Dean’s arm loosening and his shoulders slumping ever so slightly. He quickened their pace, leaning over to whisper, “One of my greatest fears walking into this building is that they would make me stay and you would be taken from me without so much as a chance to say goodbye, let alone explain myself.”
headquarters, for fuck’s sake. They slept together once but that was a one time deal and Cas was gone and Dean had a chance to escape that he absolutely should take.
Cas appears seemingly out of nowhere next to Dean, pressing a chaste kiss to his cheek and slipping an arm around his waist, long hairs falling partway in his face (That’s another thing about Heaven. It’s safe, safe enough that Cas doesn't feel like he needs to keep his hair cropped short anymore. He’s let it grow out nice and long and Dean pretends he’ll only allow it if Cas wears a cowboy hat, too. Just because. But honestly, Dean likes the hair either way). Dean turns bright red. “Hey, uh, Cas, meet Cassie. She’s an old friend; she stopped by for a drink. Cassie, this is Cas.”
With the occasional embarrassing story from Sam, they’ve got enough dirt on him to make Cas run for the hills. Except he doesn’t, of course, because it’s Cas and Cas loves him just as much as he loves Cas, and after everything he’s been through, he deserves to have something like that. (See? I told you we were working on it!)
Castiel shook his head in exasperation and sat back down on the log they’d been using as a makeshift bench. He kept shifting around uncomfortably for a few minutes, then got up and set up his bedroll without a word. Dean guessed he was trying to ignore him. It clearly wasn’t working if the looks the guy shot him every now and then meant anything. Dean tried to ignore them in return, looking instead to the rapidly fading colors in the sky, but soon enough those were gone and he had to face the reality that was staring at him with brilliant blue eyes.
on the plus side, there are not one but two pieces of art that i'll be able to add to this fic, but i won't tell you when just yet; you''l just have to wait and see, i suppose :)
He wondered what it would be like to have a family like that of his own. He remembered thinking about what it would be like to have that family with Cas. It seemed entirely possible then, as they stood there watching dawn creep over the land. He told himself that with a little more time, they could get there. With a little more time, Cas would grow on him and he would grow on Cas. Well, a little more time after, all they got was their hearts broken by one another. He should have known better. How could he think that being with Cas would be any different than with anyone else? That it would end any better? Not like they were together in the first place, but they almost were.
but I thought… But then Gabriel said that he wouldn’t help them. That what the Angels were doing was wrong. It wasn’t the first time he’d spoken out against them but it was the first time he refused a direct order. They killed him, too. That’s when I finally agreed with him.” Cas folded his hands in his lap and ducked his head. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think Cas was praying.
Then the money ran out and he joined the Hellspawn to make more. To pay for Sam, of course. And everything happened and he ended up here. Pissing on a tree for an audience of one who was only there to make sure he didn’t get away. Sighing, Dean fastened his pants and walked back to the camp where the only person who cared about his existence - for any reason at all - waited for him.
The sound of hooves on dry grass carried across the plains, and Dean rose from his spot by the fire, the night too dark to make anything out other than a figure atop a horse. The owner of the figure soon became clear when a familiar voice called out, “Dean! Castiel! Long time no see!”
Then his dad died and he was left with no one to care if he lived or died, or what he did. He still paid for Sam’s college.
Minutes or hours later, the Righteous Man stopped. Screams still echoed through his ears, and the occasional body still writhed in unparalleled agony. He silenced them with a knife through the heart. A mercy, more than they deserved, but he didn’t have the patience to drag it out. Bigger fish to catch, and all that.
“I think we lost sight of our true mission long ago. We set out to help people, not kill them for our beliefs. I think upper management forgot that a long time ago.”
Cas laughs and takes Cassie by the arm, leading her to the bar and pouring her a drink as they talk. “Are you fucking kidding me?” Dean mutters light heartedly, no real anger in the words. He’s glad two of the most important people in his life—even if it’s been years since he saw one of them—get along so well.
“Did you ever want to get out? Do something else? You know, when…” Cas asked him in a hushed whisper, as if he’d been told his whole life that such thoughts were forbidden. Knowing what he did about the Angles, Dean figured he probably had.
Alistair used his brief instability to shove him flat on the cold floor and pin his arms to the ground with his knees. Leaning over him, Alistair whispered, “You thought you could just waltz in here with a couple weapons and your pride and just get away with it? This isn’t a fairy tale, Dean. Heroes lose.” Fitting, Dean thought, that it was his own knife that plunged into his stomach, guided by Alistair’s hand. There was some sort of poetry there, but the pain took over too much of his mind for him to piece together why. The dagger hurt just as much coming out as it did going in.
“I did, sometimes. But I had to stay, y’know? Promised Sammy I’d pay for college and, well, being a Hellspawn earned me money. Didn’t have anywhere else to go, anyway. So I just...” Cas nodded in understanding. After a long pause and a lot of overthinking, Dean asked, “Do you? Y’know, ever want to leave?”
“We should get going early today. It looks like there’s gonna be a storm passing through here and I’d rather not get caught up in it,” Cas said by way of greeting.
“We- we exact justice on sinners who are unwilling to repent.” It sounded rehearsed. Like he didn’t believe it.
He dismounted Baby and left her just out of sight of the guards at the mouth of the cave. He’d seen a stream not too far off, close enough that she’d be able to find it if she needed to. Dean planned for someone to make it back to her, to either ride her somewhere or set her free, but he didn’t tie her up. Just in case. If he failed, he didn’t want Baby to suffer for it too. He trusted her to stay as long as he’d need her, and leave if he took too long. He’d known her long enough to be certain that she would be safe. And that was that.
“Don’t bullshit me, J- Castiel. You’re not considered the Hellspawns’ equals for nothing. I’ve heard stories of what you’ve done, the towns you left in ruins because your policy is ‘convert or die’. You claim to be saints but you lot are still wanted criminals all the same,” he hissed.
Cas did come over, and he reached out as if he were about to help Dean, maybe support him while he got his sea legs back, but instead, Cas just shoved him over into the dirt. “Fucking asshole!” Cas simply smirked and Dean couldn’t help but want to punch his stupid face. Cas had every right to be a dick to him, after Dean’s whole “one time deal” thing, but that didn’t mean Dean wasn’t pissed. “I’m serious, Cas; I’m gonna get my revenge one of these days and then you’ll regret messing with me. You will!”
Sneaking through the underbrush, Dean pulled the knife back out of his boot, its hilt still flecked with blood that wouldn’t quite wipe off. He savored the familiar weight of it in his palm from the old days as he set about his task.
want him dead if he knew the whole truth. Dean slaughtered dozens of people in the name of revenge. He tortured hundreds more riding with the Hellspawn. Dean was a bad person, and he didn’t deserve jack shit, least of all to be saved from himself by an Angel. Nothing could ever happen between them because Dean didn’t deserve it.
“Cas, I do trust you,” Dean tried to reassure him, reaching his hand out to cup Cas’ cheek just as he did the night before. All he wanted was for Cas to know that it wasn’t his fault, not then, not ever. Cas flinched away. “I’d trust you with the whole world, if I had it. I swear, Cas, I would. But I was selfish and I didn’t want to lose you, so I did what I thought I had to. I didn’t want to lose you, Cas.”
“Well then,” Dean huffed, slowing Baby to a trot. Castiel kept on ahead before disappearing for a moment, then returned into view without his horse. Dean figured there was a stable up ahead, too. That was a really good thing; Baby could use a good night’s rest just as much as he could.
and Sam didn’t take so well to John’s claim that he was giving up. Dean, of course, was caught in the middle, which ended with him having to side with his father just to save his own hide. Even so, it still didn’t prevent him from receiving the beating of a lifetime. Sam didn’t know all that, since he left before it could happen. He still left Dean with a few parting words that Dean immediately internalized, of course. He was a fucking coward, and he betrayed his little brother, and Sam didn’t give a single fuck as to whether he lived or died. It was crystal clear that Sam wanted nothing to do with him, and Dean knew he deserved it.
figure out where they were. Guy’s smart, Dean had to give him that. Hell, if he were escorting a former higherup of the gang that posed the greatest threat to his own, he’d be pretty fucking cautious about keeping the location of his headquarters secret, too. Still, it was frustrating, spending days on horseback with what he was sure was the
he replied, pressing a quick kiss to Cas’ cheek and slipping out of his arms to face Zachariah once again. He heard Cas back away to give him space. He began to lay into Zachariah, and shit, did he miss it. It felt the same then as it did to leave the Hellspawn dead on the floor. It felt the same as every time he got into a fight with some guy at a bar for getting handsy with a girl who told him to back off, for stealing from someone with nothing to steal in the first place, for just generally being a dick. He’d forgotten how it felt to really lay into someone, and someone who deserved it, at that. Dean was one to talk, of course, but Zachariah had done some bad things in his life. Bad things to someone Dean had grown to
Dean punched him again, and Cas’ voice rang out from his spot a few yards away, “They’re not still around. They disbanded, and Dean and I are going to go hunt down all the former members.”
with Jimmy and therefore would probably not do so well to try and get away, not at the speed they were going.
“Research. Lots and lots of research. But not today. You may be God or the Light or whatever, but you’re still part human and that means you need sleep. We’ll start first thing tomorrow morning. How’s that sound?”
Benny, as it turned out, had been right. The town was only a couple day’s ride, granted they only took a few rest breaks. Dean was mostly against that unspoken agreement, but he realized it meant less opportunity for Cas to snap at him or Benny and went along with it. He had to remind himself as they rode in silence that it didn’t actually sting that much - Cas’ opinion of him. It really didn’t because it would mean that he ended up caring for the guy, and Dean just didn’t
is wrong with spilling the blood owed to me? Explain that to me. I know for fucking certain you can’t.”
Putting on his best sarcastic pouting face, Dean responded, “How ‘bout no?” He knocked away the hand holding the knife and reached into his pocket, holding out half the guy’s money. “I’d say half and half is fair.” Usually, he wouldn’t have bothered. But he really didn’t feel like fighting anyone. Hadn’t for a while. Not since… Didn’t matter. He waved the money at the guy who gave in and took it.
Castiel fell silent. Of course he did. Even the bravest of men wouldn’t dare speak in the wake of those words. “It’s not so much a matter of morality, I suppose,” he said at last, quietly, “because in your position, I believe I would have done the same thing. Perhaps. Perhaps I would be too scared. But, Dean, I’m not judging you for what you did, not like other people do.”
He nipped at Dean’s neck, then immediately soothed the spot with his tongue and Dean had to bite back a whine.
“Yes,” he gritted out, “and if you ask me any more personal questions, I swear to God, you’re next.”
Giving the guy a once over (maybe a bit more deliberate than he’d like to admit), Dean glanced at Cas, who glared daggers at both of them. Dean realized having another person with them wouldn’t be such a bad idea after all. “Yeah, alright we’re in. I’m Dean,” he said, holding out his hand to shake.
“I’d hardly call this a house of God, Zachariah, considering how many people are slaughtered by its members in a day.”
One of the men lurking just outside of reach of the doors lunged for the monster, landing what sounded like it could have been a good punch. He took a blade to the heart before he could make another sound. “Who’s next?”
“Out,” he demanded. Then, turning on the stranger, he asked, “You with him?” to which the guy huffed a laugh and responded with a simple, “No,” in a low, rough voice that absolutely did not completely scramble Dean’s brain.
,” Zachariah cut in, “because you could be useful. We need more raw talent like you. Like I said, what you did to the demons was impressive, and Michael thought it would be a good idea to convert you, now that you left them.”
he’d never hear again. But for him to think he had any right to say those things to Cas… Someone had to stop him.
“Dean, you couldn’t do shit to me if you tried,” Cas laughed, sounding so fucking sure of hiself that Dean just
but he had a feeling Jimmy knew exactly where he was and would definitely notice if he made a break for it. Shit.
Cas stepped over Dean’s legs, which were stretched out by the fire pit they’d set up earlier. They’d finished eating dinner hours ago, having stopped early since Cas estimated they only had a day or two more to go anyways. Dean was grateful for the extra time. Time to rest, of course, but also more time before arriving at Angel headquarters. Before he would have to be alone again, without Cas. He’d never admit that, since he’d learned it was perhaps the most dangerous thing to admit to anyone, including himself, but knowing it was enough.
“The stables are through that door, but to get there, there’s a great, open field we have to pass through,” Cas warned him.
The afternoon sun relentlessly beat down on Dean’s neck, leaving him sweaty and probably sunburned, and he’d been saying as much all day. He could tell that Castiel was suffering, too, by the slump of his shoulders and the way his hands twitched on the reins as if he wanted to wipe the sweat off his brow but didn’t want to reveal that he agreed with most of Dean’s griping. Eventually, Dean supposed, even the strongest will must break.
and fuck did he miss this. It had been months, if not years, and, fuck. Dean really fucking missed it.
As they laid side by side, blissed out and panting, Dean brushed a stray strand of hair from Cas’ forehead. It was the first time he’d truly seen Cas smile. It made Dean smile in return. They remained there, holding one another, until Dean began to drift off.
“Maybe. If you were trying to get me to agree just so I let you go, I’ll never forgive you.” And that was that.
“Coward!” he screamed again, trying to tune out his former master’s words. He punched Alistair right in the jaw, just barely not hard enough to know him out.
Dean’s ass was sore as fuck from riding nonstop for the past couple hours and, well, the previous night. Of course, he could go on for the rest of the day, but what could he say, he spent one night in a semi nice place so of course he’s gonna act like a little baby. One never forgets the taste of luxury.
Before he knew it, Dean found himself flat on his ass, with what was probably going to be an ugly bruise forming on his cheek, while the guy dug through his pockets in search of the rest of the money. Fucker. As soon as he found it, he turned and ran off in the other direction and Dean’s head throbbed so bad he didn’t feel all that much like going after him. Shit. Bad really did get worse, didn’t it.
i know that technically this chapter is a day late, but it's only a couple hours for me on the west coast so i'm going to pretend that it's on time. also, speaking of lateness, i may end up going on a temporary hiatus--or at least i'll have to post less frequently--so i can work on my fic for the deancas reverse bang. so i mean, at least you'll have that to look forward to!!
“I’m sorry, Dean, but I can’t. The Empty may be where I go when I die, but I have no jurisdiction over it. I was only able to bring Cas back last time because I woke him up. He did the rest.” Dean opened his mouth to ask a question but Jack seemed to know what he was going to say. “I tried already, Dean. I can’t reach him, now that I have this power. I command Creation, and because I do, I am bound to it. I have even less power over the Empty than I did before, and that isn’t saying much. I’m sorry, Dean, I really am.”
They sat there awhile, silent save for the occasional rustling of fabric as they took a sip from the near-empty bottles clutched tight in their hands. After what could have been minutes or hours, Sam turned to Dean, resolute, and spoke, his words near deafening in the quiet. “Let’s go save Cas.” It rang through the air the same way Anna told them Cas’ first words after leaving Hell had rang in the ears of every angel in Creation. It hurt. It hurt so fucking bad.
“Already been,” he replied. His face remained entirely blank, but his tone was that of someone who truly
“Fuck,” Dean muttered. Save for a quick, “Fuck you, asshole,” called across the saloon, he left without much of a fight, if only because he heard his ex- opponent say something about why the fuck didn’t he get his money back and Dean wasn’t sticking around long enough to see if he would, in fact, get his money back. He let the saloon doors swing obnoxiously behind him, because, well, shit if he didn’t love being dramatic. On occasion.
to say I wouldn’t. None. How the hell could you possibly believe I wouldn’t? I lo-” Dean froze. The world seemed to stop alongside him. No. No, he couldn’t… He
Cas had faith too, didn’t he? He used to. And then he met Dean and Dean fucked that up for him too. He just fucked up everything, didn’t he? Shit.
fuck his luck - Dean found himself pinned to the ground, a gravelly voice cursing him out so colorfully even Dean had to appreciate it. And then the world went black.
of the worst of the worst?” Castiel began to look at him with something akin to awe. Dean couldn’t tell if he liked it any more or less than the alternative. “And even if the how was simple, there’s the matter of why.
The use of his full name broke something in him. He didn’t think it could ever be fixed. “They fucking killed my mother, that’s why! They’re the reason I even ended up in this mess. They killed her and my dad got obsessed with hunting the the people responsible down, then Sammy left us, left
“I understand,” Cas replied solemnly, heading inside, likely to pack up their things. He turned back, looking for all the world like a kicked puppy. “Did- Do you regret it?” he whispered.
than the minimum necessary to survive. He cut away the real old him, until there was nothing left. Oh, how he’d savor the death of the man responsible for that.
“Doesn’t know...what? Dean, what happened?” Sam urged, previous caution apparently thrown to the wind. Dean had to admit, his brother could be an annoying little shit sometimes, but others? He knew exactly how to snap his stupid fuckup of an older brother back to reality.
As it turned out, there was only one bed in the cabin. Big enough to hold two grown men, but barely. Dean joined Castiel a few minutes after he went off to get ready for bed, stripping off most of his layers and crawling beside Castiel under the blanket.
Dean kicked Alistair’s knee, bending it backwards and crunching bone. Alistair crumpled to the floor. Looking down at the figure hunched over itself on the floor, Dean could hardly see a person. All he could see was a
They each set off to do their respective tasks, and Dean made it as far as getting the beans from the cabinet before realizing there was a problem. “Hey, uh, you think you could untie me?” Castiel glared at him. “Seriously, Castiel? It’s not like I’m gonna do anything - I’ve proven that much - and what reason do I have to run off? There’s food here and probably a bed and you can keep track of me easily ‘cause we’re gonna be in the same building all night. Please, Castiel. Just for one night?”
With what little strength he had left, Dean reached out and caressed Cas’ face. He realized he didn’t even know Cas’ last name. Dean was the only one left in the desolate chamber, and as the darkness slowly started to overtake him, he spoke.
“At this point, I don’t understand why I even let you into my saloon on karaoke nights anymore if you pull this shit every time. Go find a better crowd to rile up.”
Dean sighed but guided Baby over to where Jimmy had set about tying up his own horse. Dismounting clumsily, as he still hadn’t quite gotten used to doing so with both hands bound in front of him, he tugged at the rope tying him to Jimmy’s horse. “Either you untie me, or you tie Baby up yourself. Say what you want about me, but I’d really rather she didn’t run off in the middle of the night because someone was too much of a jackass to look after a fucking horse,” Dean said, giving the rope another tug just to be annoying.
Once everyone settled in, the homeroom teacher took attendance, they stood for the pledge, and before Castiel knew it the time came for first period – going into the stampede in the hallway. That was mostly due to the scared freshman on their first day. Castiel made his way through the halls as if it was a maze and into his first class he had with Garth, which was Mythology. It was being taught by Mr. Shurley which wasn’t so bad, quit interesting to be honest.
Bringing up his nose, Charlie had another question for him “Are you sure you even want to go to school today? I thought you should’ve stayed home today. Its Friday and it wouldn’t hurt to have one day off, I mean you’re in pain you should be relaxing.” She was being a caring friend.
"I hope that all of his lost memories never returned to him." Meg hoped "He's better off without you."
It didn't take long for Cas to get an answer. He heard her giggling from down the hall. Cas strutted his way to their bedroom to hear "Oh god, yes! Right there. Fuck, you are so much better than Clarence at this" she was moaning.
She shrugged at me “Don’t you want a first kiss, or a relationship, a real one instead of fantasying about you with fictional characters.? I will find you a good man!”
The sight Castiel was met with took his breath away. The sun was beginning to set casting a beautiful glow of orange and yellow- the scenery looked like the perfect photo.
Castiel never believed that he was good looking, but Dean made him feel good as a smile crept to his face.
Castiel was at home that night with Charlie working at the coffee shop. With no homework to do yet, an enjoyable night for Cas was laying on his comfortable bed reading a good book with an ice pack on his nose. A book he bought after school at Barnes and Nobles: ‘Super Fake Love Song’ by David Yoon. It was a pretty good book getting through the first seven chapters before his eyes started to close, drifting off into a nap as the ice pack slide off his face and the book fall onto his torso.
His heart instantly broke at the sight, crumbling down all the way to the garage "what is going on?" His voice cracking, his hand shaking on the doorknob.
"You can," She insisted "Cas will still be here. You have to take care of yourself, you need to sleep properly, go home."
Benny turned to her acting as innocent as she was "Oh blondie, I didn't see you there" before shooing her off "go away."
He jumped off the car, a little shy from the fact he got caught doing that “No, just waiting for your slow ass.”
Cas stepped closer to him, grabbing his hand "Dean you won't lose me. It was just a dream. I like it here. I see that I have a great life with you. It's taking a while but my memories are slowly coming back. Don't let her bother you, Okay?" Cas kissed him "Now I'm going to shower"
"Maybe you are right, we do everything married couples do except we aren't married" Sam thought "If I went to look for a ring would you come with me?"
“I don’t need you to find me a man. I love you but no. I got my studies, work and my books” Castiel tried to argue. He didn’t really want to be set up. For one, he never even had his first kiss. So, forget about first days and so on. Besides no one at school caught his eye. He wasn’t liked by many people. He also didn’t want to be set up with anyone, considering he never had a first relationship or kiss, he wants to find the right person, not just anyone.
A few moments later, even though to me, it felt like hours, she heard her friend Doctor Dorian tell her, "Just one last push, Charlie. Can you do that for me?"
"Yes!" Cas muttered, his eyes practically rolling back from the electric shocks of pleasure his body was receiving.
“Pretty good I’m looking forward to the projects” she was very creative and artistic. She loved arts and crafts.
"I'm fine mom, getting better" Cas needed to understand this better "Dean, when was the last time I spoke to my mom?"
She had more to complain about yet Cas cut her off "It's my life. I don't want to be like you." She was an obgyn doctor "I like to draw and create things. I'm good at it."
Castiel barely could take his eyes off him as he informed him “it’ll be $8.50” watching his teacher dig into his wallet for the eight dollars and fifty cents. “I’ll get it to you shortly, Mr. Winchester.”
Cas leaned down closer to her before she could say anything else "Yes you can. One more and it will all be over and we can hold him. Do it for me. I know you can!"
"Cas" Dean barely breathed out. His body wanted to collapse, he felt like he was suffocating. He felt sick. He needed to move and get to Sam.
A few feet away at a corner table was Meg sucking face with Dean's ex-husband, yes, he has seen pictures. Cas believed Charlie and Dean when they told him, but he's actually seeing it.
“It’ll be one hell of a year” Charlie continued “Got my friends, signed up for good classes, but mostly I have a goal and that goal is to get myself a girlfriend, fingers crossed” picking her hand up to show she actually crossed her fingers
Cas smiled "I watched it, so I know, but of course you would be, which makes me wonder if you ever get married would I be your man of honor?"
Dean looked towards his younger brother “Really? Well, that is great, Sammy.” He was so happy for Sam.
"We usually do" Dean grabbed another apple "followed by hot chocolate, but I figured because of the bad food and getting drinks later we shouldn't bother getting it."
Charlie wasn’t going to hear the excuses” who knows maybe your luck will change. There will be one hunk of a man willing to date a fine piece of ass like yourself”
To be polite, he didn’t barge right in “Charlie?” he asked as his knuckles hit against the door, knocking.
"I get that, but your wedding band is on your finger. There is proof all around this house. We were happily married. Wouldn't you stick with me? Not with her and what she says?" Dean tried, not wanting him to side with her.
“Time to get up” he announced even if she didn’t hear him. Walking over to her bed, she was laid out of the left side of her queen-sized bed.
“Hey” Cas got a little defensive “I wasn’t flirting” he really wasn’t. Cas only asked him a question.
Cas laughed 'Charlie, I doubt anyone is as good in bed as Dean is." They barely could keep their hands off each other when they are alone. Dean was an addiction.
Jo, Charlie's girlfriend eventually got to the hospital to wait. Dean was waiting with her. Only one person could be in the room with her. Dean insisted Cas be with her, they were closer. So, she was more than happy to have her best friend next to her, holding her hand and guiding her through this.
Humming along to 'Another One Bites the Dust' Cas drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, picking up that little habit from Dean, minding his own business as he was stopped at a red light. Once it signaled to turn green Cas took his foot off the brake placing it back onto the gas, cruising along.
Cas felt his heart sink. His poor Dean. oh my God. What sick bastard would do this? He moved closer to touch the scar "Dean, I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
Cas sighed before asking him what he wondered for the rest of the period “Would I be able to come here 0 period on Monday to work on the machine so I do not fall behind.”
It was the guy that Castiel saw earlier this morning! Getting a better look at his face he noticed the stubble of a five-o clock shadow, green eyes, messy yet spiked hair, and a perfect jawline. This guy was going to be his teacher?! He never had an attractive teacher before. This man was beautiful to look at!
“It is a 78 Lincoln Continental Mark V” Cas even liked the color because it matched his trench coat.
Cas turned right to him "As for you" with so much force, Cas punched him, sending him right down to the floor.
Dean was thinking yep this woman is fucking crazy "You made him miserable. Yeah, he told me all about your relationship. Telling me he used to lay in bed next to you every night wondering if he could find some better, someone who accepts him because you didn't. Then you go and you cheat on him. You screwed it up. He moved on he's a Winchester now."
This was bliss for them, in the moment just them two, but Dean wanted this about Cas, give him all the pleasure. After a few more rocks together, Dean pulled away to once again descend down, kissing his neck, collar bone, and muscled chest planting a trail of tingling kisses until getting down to the prize. Dean used his hands to move along his taint running his finger lightly back and forth.
“I’m coming” Sam rushed down the stairs almost out of breath in his checkered blue and red plaid shirt, jeans, and boots.
Their attention shot to her as Sam stood to his feet. On the other hand, Dean had a lot to ask "Is he okay? Is he in pain? Is he awake? Is he talking? Can we see him?" It was like he drank 10 cans of red bull so energized.
"I don't know what to believe," Cas sighed looking to the ground before back to the Dean "I'm being told different things and I am getting so confused by everything."
"Really?" Cas may have been informed that he doesn't talk to his mom anymore, but she used to make the best lasagna "Well I'll be the judge of that."
Happiness was all Dean could feel, walking straight over to him "Really Angel, it is all back?" He needed it to be true.
Dean had to take a deep breath in to control himself. He wanted to punch her so bad. "We are done here. I mean it, stay away from Cas, you evil demon."
Feeling his presence around, Dean looked up from his phone watching Castiel place down his coffee and pies “Hope you enjoy it, Dean”
Charlie wished she didn't have to say this but they needed to know "He thinks he is twenty-one, living with Meg."
Feeling something wet on his face, Castiel’s vision was blurry until Mr. Rollen and his friends were all kneeling beside him concerned.
“For your information, I get dressed for myself and you know a guy.” Jo crossed her arms, relaxing into the seat.
“You got it.” Dean walked away to pour the beer in the glasses, his thoughts shifting to Cas hoping he was feeling okay with a sprained nose.
Cas actually insisted on going here tonight not that Dean minded. "So, tell me why you wanted to be here?"
Dean ran out leaving his husband to help her up "Cas, this really hurts" the pain was so bad she felt tears forming in her eyes.
Once the coffee liquid poured into the cups, Charlie made her way into the kitchen, hair down, black vans, jeans, and a black “Hermione” shirt.
The bell rang just as Charlie arrived to class seeing Mr. Winchester and Cas outside of the room. “Cassie, are you okay?!”
“I’ll give you a minute or two to look it over” he told everyone going over to his desk, yet as it was said, the girls were more interested in Mr. Winchester’s looks not what was on the paper.
"I don't remember you; I'm not going to keep a promise to someone like you when I have someone like her" Cas kissed the side of her head.
"And actually," Dean jumped in "You helped them design the layout, Cas." Obviously, Cas couldn't help them now, but he did.
The need for oxygen was becoming too great making the kiss break, placing their foreheads up against the other, with the two men short of breath; panting heavily. With eyes fixed on one another, the color in their eyes were nearly gone with their pupils blown in utter lust.
Castiel playfully smacked the hand holding he puppet away from his face “Shut up,” He couldn’t even say that without a smile.
Walking down the hall with his best friend, there was no trouble…. yet which was a relief so far while they walked past familiar faces, who he certainly won’t miss once this year is over.
"No" Dean was explaining as he hit the level four button "I mean we've talked about it, but not yet."
"I did not," Dean informed him, knowing what he was doing "I will say this though you are not one for fancy dates. You like going on dates that other people wouldn't consider dates. Am I correct?"
Cas’ eyes are backlit with grace, and he’s braced with one hand outstretched back to Dean and Benny, but he’s turned to look away from them. The woods are quiet around them. The woods are never quiet— there’s always someone dying. Unless… everyone is dead.
And sorry this is a late update. Euro cup went into OT and I gave myself a stress migraine willing the Danes to win, but alas it was for nothing.
"Physical intimacy isn't a necessity for me," Cas reminds him, "but if it would please you, then yes, I would be interested."
But also lmao Sam is SO GOOD at Dean-fu. Completely disarms Dean by coming at him from a whole new angle (with love) and doesn't rise to Dean's panic attempts to start a fight to hide. Both these boys are growing!!!! We love to see it.
Dean holds Cas’ hand between both of his. Cas has always been sensitive to being different. Dean can’t even imagine what it must be like to go from something intangible to like six feet tall.
“All of the appropriate signs are here,” Death shrugs, “I would even wager Castiel could be your first creation, depending on if you’re done with him or not. You have a sibling, to help protect and nurture you. You’ve gone through several trials already.”
Dean comes to find that he likes the feel of his bed in the bunker. Other than Bobby’s, where ‘his’ room is just a room he’s claimed, that he normally sleeps in when they stay with Bobby, Dean hasn’t had a home with a room to himself since he was four.
Sometimes they play games. Run hypotheticals. How would you kill this monster? What would you do in that scenario? What’s the first thing you want to do when we get home? If you could kill one person on earth, no consequences, who would it be? How would you do it?
They’ve been on a good streak. Sam’s nightmares have either been manageable enough, or not happening, and Sam’s been sleeping fairly well on his own.
With his matted hair and pale, sweaty skin, Sam looks like a body they found in a ditch. Bobby cleaned off his face, so he’s no longer covered in blood, and got him out of his wet clothes and wrapped up in blankets.
Well, duh. Why be queer if he’s not gonna try everything. Wait, what if Cas is stalling. Is Dean coming on too strong?
Maybe if Cas plays bad cop, Dean can be good cop here. Maybe they can change Sam’s mind, but that’s a big stretch. Sam is impossible to deter once he’s decided on something.
Cas looks over his shoulder, back towards the living room where they left Sam, “What a joke. He reduced me to a coffin of flesh!”
The angels lunge, moving so fast that Dean’s eyes can’t track them. There’s sparks, like someone set off fireworks— Sam yells, and drops to his knees, and Dean’s hit with a recoil of angel grace, like a pressure wave, that knocks him back on his ass. His broken leg wipes the rest of his thoughts.
“You smell a little too good,” Benny clarifies, and drops the body to the floor, “we gotta fix that.”
Sam’s still laying on the ground, and now he’s crying. He’s faking it, Dean knows it. He knows that if Sam tries harder, he’ll be okay. So why isn’t he trying? Why doesn’t he want to get better?
Which is true. Despite Dean thinking Cas could be, should have been, so much better than him… Cas has picked up all of Dean’s worst traits. Including fucking things up in huge ways.
him, it was in his lungs! Dean shakes his head, manages to open his eyes against the tar still covering him. He’s wrapped in layers of shit that looks like-- like veins or intestines. He can feel points where it’s gotten under his skin, like it was pumping him full of leviathan goo or— or— it was in his lungs, it was keeping him alive? For later?
“I have to leave the residence to do so,” Cas explains, “the energy released from such an act would kill all of you. And burn Robert’s books.”
And the can makes a neat arc, like it’s been tossed by a hand, to come float in front of Sam. There’s no shakiness to Cas’ movement, he’s a total master of mental juju. It’s pretty weird to see. And kind of cool.
The screaming won’t stop, and Dean’s brain is going to explode, so he grabs Cas’ face in his hands, “Listen to me: you are dying and I can’t lose you. I promise you I won’t let you go darkside.”
Dean lets out a slow breath. Does he want to part ways with Benny like this? After everything they went through? Benny is the only reason Dean found Cas, and the only reason they had a chance at escaping purgatory at all.
“An armadillo avoids…” Cas starts, and Dean can’t help himself from grinning even when he’s trying to rest. An angel is reading him a bedtime story.
“You can’t be hungry?” Dean repeats, “cause I remember you going wild for hamburgers when we were hunting the horsemen.”
to Dean. How Dean’s not worth being home to someone. That he’s wanted it for so long, turned it into such an impossible fantasy, that he can’t comprehend the thought of someone wanting to come home to him.
“I’m not what you think, I’m not— a hammer, as you say. I have… I have doubts,” Castiel says, and he looks at Dean, shares this secret with him, and Dean’s breath catches in his throat.
Sam’s rocking on his feet, trying very hard not to interrupt Death who has decided now of all times to go off on a tangent like an old man with memory issues. Dean also wants to yell at him to get to the point.
Cas’ eyes are still bright from his freak out earlier. It makes them look brilliantly blue, even without his grace.
This isn’t the first time Cas has walked in on Dean sleeping under his bed. Some nights his paranoia gets too out of control, and he needs to feel sheltered to soothe it.
“You want Sam’s fancy creamer, or you want a special coffee?” Dean asks, already hunting for the whiskey, “because I could use a drink.”
Cas’ body is different from Dean’s, different from Benny’s. Dean can’t help but take note of it. He’s not used to having the biggest tits in the bedroom, and the joke is lost on Cas when he shares it. Cas has broader shoulders than him, and is surprisingly muscled under all of those layers. He’s not as hairy as Benny, but he’s got more body hair than Dean, and Dean is surprised to realize that he
Dean, because Dean is special to him. Because Cas is insanely special to Dean. And what if… what if heaven could just erase it all?
“I fit in this vessel? I never realized how… expansive a human form could be,” Cas notes. He rolls his head from side to side.
Dean almost laughs. He remembers sitting on Bobby’s porch, before losing Ellen and Jo, and the two of them saying they were each other’s best friend.
The other awful thing about existing in a primordial dimension meant to house a predator from before things in the water started breathing real air, is that he has to shit in the woods. And because Dean’s life is a constant uphill battle, he’s gotta go dig a hole and all that, well, crap because everything in purgatory is like a bloodhound and Dean happens to be the only thing in this entire world that poops.
"I may never know what I am, and I could spend eons in doubt and fear over that," Cas says, "so I... I thought about it. About us. And I understand your reservations, but, why should I keep myself from what makes me happy?"
Sam looks like shit. Even after Dean got him cleaned up from all the blood on his face. He’s propped up in bed against his pillows, tucked in like some sick kid in a movie about orphans.
“It’s your body, just like every human is born with one. But think of yours as like a cocoon for the soul gestating inside. If all goes well, one day you will be ready to depart it. But if you’re careless with it, and you burst too early… well. I promised to reap you should you be so careless again.”
I’m very excited for the events of s7 though, because this is truly Dean’s pivotal year of deciding who he’s going to be. If this sounds like it’s too heavy or too much for you to read, there is a tl;dr at the end of the chapter to give a brief summary of what happens this chapter.
“To penetrative sex,” Cas clarifies, and he finally strips off his button up. Like the worlds biggest tease, he’s got an undershirt on too, “like in the video.”
“Cool,” Dean agrees, “we get his attention, he shows up, you can put him back to work. Universe goes back to normal.”
Dean waits too long, and Bobby takes it as an answer. He gestures Dean to follow, and heads back to the kitchen.
Sam opens his eyes, and the look on his face makes Dean want to know what the hell he saw. Sam looks from Cas, to Dean, and gives Dean a nod. He’s pissed, but he’s respecting Dean’s brother pact.
Despite being a basket case, Sam is still a strong son of a bitch, and Dean throws all his weight into pinning his brother. He wasn’t fast enough— there’s still a red cut at the side of Sam’s throat, blood trickling out— it’s not gushing, he didn’t hit an artery— Sam head butts him under the jaw. Sends Dean sprawling.
“I’m not leaving here without Cas,” Dean repeats, “so if we want to find him before I die, then we’d better get looking.”
“I can’t see,” Sam realizes, and he whips his head back towards Cas but stops too early and is looking to the left of Cas, “oh my god, my eyes—”
When Sam leaves, it’s Dean who stays. Dean who obeys. Dean, who is the good son. Dean is here, to make his father proud. To prove that family
"No, just me" Dean felt a little taken back by this question, not expecting this, but answered anyway letting Cas step out first when the doors opened.
Who knows how long Castiel was actually just standing there staring? He probably looked like a mannequin if anyone noticed. He was just in a daze with the man again. Why though?
"That is not what she told me." Dean's frustration was radiating to Cas "She said she's been a part of my life for a while."
Charlie sat there in the passenger seat confused, he never runs out of the car to the place he calls Hell before she got out of the car with her purple moondor backpack. She noticed her mechanics teacher that every straight girl was gushing over.
Dean barely looked up, feeling the presence of Sam who came back holding a bag of cool ranch Doritos from the vending machine.
"I'm all right I should stop drinking," placing his empty beer mug down "sober up and take Advil for the pain that I'm feeling."
"Yes" Dean didn't want to do that "but you're trying to remember and being in here in your own bedroom could help I don't mind." He really didn't.
Dean had a good memory, but word for word he can't do "I don't remember every word, but I did say something along the lines of: When I met you, I was drawn to you immediately and I knew I wouldn't be able to live without you. I needed you. We were both in a dark place and we fixed each other, then I talked about our journey as a couple knowing it wasn't over for us, wanting more. I wanted a future with you and so I asked if you'd marry me" Dean grabbed his left hand turning Castiel's ring slightly. "Followed by hot sex in the car."
Cas was pleased “Thank you, Dean.” He went to walk away, but stopped “By the way.” He turned his bookbag around to get better access opening the zipper to get something out of it.
Moving on from that horrible experience, Dean found himself in Ellen's bar enjoying a few beers and a game of pool against Benny when he met another broken man named Castiel. From that moment, Dean's life changed forever.
Dean shook his head “One thing I learned in mechanics is you need to be focused when working on the machines and right now you are not okay. Put down the screwdriver and relax you don’t need to finish this today.”
"Sweetheart, I was getting worried I-..." Crowley appeared looking for his girl that was taking so long.
What was better than making love to the love of his life? "No" Cas jumped off the car only to push Dean against the car attacking his lips, moaning into the kiss.
A little later, they found themselves looking up at the blue sky with the odd shaped clouds floating by lying on the grass. It's been a long time since they've done such a thing "I love watching the clouds" Charlie said a little dreamy now that she was relaxed letting the sun dry her clothing.
Everything seemed to slow down when this man was making his way down the hall and into the main office.
Oh boy did she have it all wrong "He doesn't need fixing! He needs his memories back besides it's Castiel's choice. You came back into his life for him to realize he shouldn't have let you back in. If you think he wants you why do you think he ran off after kissing you? He told me he didn't like it. He then kissed me and I didn't want to stop. Who does Cas want?"
Dean didn't need to stress over anyone yet fate had other plans. Days later an unexpected and unwelcome visitor arrived at their house just as Dean and Cas were pulling from another appointment at the hospital; no Crowley to be found luckily.
Castiel was staring straight ahead at the south entrance needing a moment to silently pray to the angels if anyone was listening up there, so that he could have a better day than he expected. Castiel exhaled deeply not wanting to step through those halls “Keven and Garth should be here by now” walking up those marble steps and towards their lockers which were placed next to one another being in the same homeroom together.
"Hey, Dean" Sam walked through the front door taking off his bag filled with lawyer papers, throwing it off to the side and into the kitchen. Sam and Eileen were staying over at Dean and Castiel's house for the time being as they were renovating their house.
After spending the day with Charlie, Cas came home to hear Dean in the garage, he took a shot going down there "Dean?"
"How about 'All Saint's Day" Sam noticed one of their favorite Halloween movies trending. Sam wasn't big on Halloween, but he enjoyed the movie, knowing Dean did too.
"Yes" Dean went for the philly cheese streak wrap, he was pretty hungry and nothing else seemed appetizing, they didn't even have pie!
"Yes, you do" Dean thought Cas looked good in everything, even that trench coat Cas was obsessed with "but you always do."
"Alright, alright" Cas knew Eileen well enough to know her style "If I'm going to do it that when are you and Dean going to be official?"
Cas wrapped his arms loosely around Dean's neck, softly batting his tongue urgently into his husband's mouth.
“To stop working and not to worry about getting this done today.” Cas plainly told her, he wanted this done yet on the other hand he was grateful because he really couldn’t focus as much as he wanted to.
Charlie had a very good reason “Because Dorothy told me she would be taking that class, and I needed an elective and in that category was the class she was taking so I took it.”
“My bad” Castiel didn’t even realized they were already at the house and parked “oh, we are here!” he announce the obvious.
"For leaving" Cas sighed, knowing he needed to be the one to apologize, it was his fault. "I promise I'll stop doing that."
"After seeing Meg, stuff was coming back to me so I thought I'd make a timeline of my life" Cas was explaining his reasoning but paused for just a moment "sorry went through all your pictures."
Dean grinned and slipped the ring onto his left-hand ring finger. Once it was on Cas had no time to look at it on his finger. Dean attacked his lips "This is actually happening."
He watched Dean slowly move into Castiel’s personal space as he placed a hand on the back of Castiel’s neck. Oh, the sensation Cas was feeling already.
"Can I kiss you?" Cas was now standing in front of him, their eyes locked "I mean we are married we should be able to...."
With his ass up, it was a beautiful sight to see for Cas as he poured lubricant onto his hand and slicked up his whole, Dean groaning in pleasure. The sounds Dean was making was causing Steve to lose control. He needed to hurry! Placing the condom onto his hard cock and lining it up to Dean's entrance.
“Yea, but those jerks did this to you.” She hated them all. She got bullied too, but not anywhere near as much as Cas did.
A soft sigh escaped his lips when Dean questioned "Do you like this?" he was grinning down at him, loving that he gets to see Cas come undone like this.
"Hey Cas, look!" Charlie pointed to the left of them "It's a dog" this cloud looked in the shape of a dog with two big eyes.
"You changed careers, broke off your engagement with Meg, and started dating me." Dean explained the reasoning.
Meg fought back "I pushed him to do the right things to make good money and be the man he should be. You pushed him into something he's not! You got it all wrong"
"It is a night that is impossible to forget," Cas had one hell of a good time "you looked beautiful in your black gown."
“We are going to be divided into two team’s blue team/ green team.” The teacher started to explain “We’ll have two captains” scanning around the room at all the faces “Anyone want to be captain?”
“Castiel, you need to see a nurse.” Mr. Rollen saw blood dripping down his nose and it was starting to swell.
Cas got slightly worried now, everything was going amazingly today, what changed? "Is everything okay?"
Castiel wasn’t given in just yet “Let me go to homeroom first so I don’t get marked absent then I will go.”
That comment had Cas whip his head towards the redhead “What? No! Sure, okay I admitted he is good looking, but crush no absolutely not.” He was becoming awkward, fiddling with his trench coat sleeve.
Castiel brushed it off as he had to then go get his teachers order going back behind the counter to make his specialty coffee and three slices of pie.
The line didn't look so long at Starbucks, which was a good thing. Cas really hated long lines, but who doesn't? The first thing he did was look at the menu deciding what he wanted to get.
Dean lost track of time, down in his garage putting on the last new shiny rim on the wheels of his beloved 'Baby' 67 Chevy Impala. He was so focused he barely noticed that his phone had been buzzing constantly in the last five minutes.
Dean pulled away causing Cas to want him back tugging on his shirt. With their lips connecting, Cas could feel him smiling from his action just to shorten it once again, their noses almost touching.
“I do wonder who this Mr. Winchester is,” Charlie continued “I heard he is new. I hope he is an easy teacher.”
“Yes, but what were you playing that got you a bruise like that?” Dean explained, asking “Is it broken?”
Castiel watched him walk off and take a seat in a booth in the corner of the place. Once he was settled, out came a book.
And with that Cas set the movie up on Netflix so that it would be ready to play by the time the pizza gets here.
Dean's own cock was hardening just by the sounds Cas was making. Letting go with a little whimper from Cas, he brought his hands up to circle Castiel's nipples with the pointer fingers, slowly tracing around before switching it to his thumbs, going back and forth to harden the buds.
He, Dean, Sam, and Eileen were all here, who could be ringing the doorbell. "The doorbell just rang"
“Castiel?” Charlie questioned, seeing that he wasn’t answering her. She let go of him slightly, so he could lean against the locker that was near Channing’s.
Dean noticed what he was looking at as he swallowed the big gulp of food "That is your master's degree, Cas"
Meg threw on a robe running after him "Clarence, you weren't supposed to be home for another 2 hours"
The friends didn't notice nor hear Cas walk in knowing the code now, so from the angle it looked like they kissed "Dean?" which confused the hell out of him. If Charlie is a lesbian why are they kissing?
When a song like this comes on Dean could never resist with his fists going into the air to the beat of the song.
That was until he stood up to get a sip of beer, to find his phone vibrating nearby. "Who is calling me now?" he wondered out loud to himself.
Cas nodded "I figured he wouldn't." He knew Sam wasn't into those types of movies. "But anyways, I do have news," he couldn't wait to tell his husband this, he just didn't sound so excited due to being tired.
Charlie placed a hand on her friend's arm "stay here, let me talk to him. I'll ask him the routine questions."
Sam and Eileen were not surprised however Cas was, tilting his head in confusion "Four large pies?" he repeated "Isn't that a little too much?"
That is when he noticed that Lisa and her friends were looking his way and smiling. Next thing he knew, Lisa got up from her stool and walked over to the bar “Dean.”
Beginning to pump slowly, stroking from the base to the tip over and over again; every single stroke sent electricity through his whole body having him close his eyes tightly from the stars he was beginning to see.
Cas never been called Cas before just Castiel or Cassie. He didn’t mind though, he liked it “Cas is fine.”
Cas grabbed a tuna wrap; it's been a while since he had one and it looked good "And that guy you were with Sam. He is your brother?"
Cas quickly got out his wallet from his pants pocket and gave her the money before receiving change and going to stand over to the side and wait for their coffee.
"Would you mind taking this to the bedroom?" Dean suggested, already turned on. Cas did say he didn't want to stop.
She laughed at him “You were like totally gone. I tried saying your name and that didn’t work. I had to get your attention somehow. Are you okay?”
Was Cas going to finish the job and think of Dean, who he tried to convince to Charlie and himself that he does not have a crush on his teacher!
Castiel couldn’t keep my eyes off him, not noticing that every other girl in the room besides Charlie and Dorothy were practically drooling at the sight of their new teacher.
Cas shook his head with a smile, going back into the closet to find a pair of boxers and sweatpants "Better?"
"And you usually answer emails and bills, but you don't know the passcode, so I'll be doing that." Dean sat down on a stool with two full plates of waffles filled with syrup. "We talk for a bit and then go to work, but you can go to work yet so you can stay here and do whatever you want. I have to go into work for a bit. Your phone is here you can call me if you need anything."
"I know," She wanted to kiss him bad "it is just a kiss. It could help you remember. One kiss it's harmless please" biting her lip.
Dean was already at home after hanging out with Benny, he was on the couch flipping through channels on the TV by the time Cas got home.
Sam was honestly trying to hide a smile “Yeah I am. I been searching for rings, I mean I haven’t found the one I want yet, but I am still looking.”
"What's happening is you are interrupting sex night with my beautiful girlfriend" Cas kissed her quickly.
"I remember everything, Charlie!" Cas cheered "all of my lost memories. These past ten years are fully back."
Keeping at it, Dean climbed off Cas to lower his body to start low at the waist leaving open- mouthed kisses along Castiel's stomach and the middle of his chest, slowly heading for one nipple, slipping his left hand away from the bud only to be placed with his wet mouth. Dean's tongue tracing the bud, giving off a few sucks, being rewarded with soft moans escaping from the handsome man. With Cas enjoying this, Dean started to suck harder with his tongue flicking the bug faster.
From his action, Cas gasped slightly as he felt my heart stop from inside hum. This is it? His eyes becoming watery, almost blurry.
Hearing screeching coming from the floor, Mr. Rollen walked into the gym dragging along a bag full of round red balls “Alright guys, like usual we are starting out the year with Dodge ball!”
Cas felt the pain starting to subside through his back “Yeah I am” he quickly spun around and headed straight for the little door that lead to behind the counter. He had to admit he was a bit embarrassed making my way over to where Noelle was pouring a customer coffee.
Dean didn't have an answer "I don't know. What I do know is that I let my frustrations get the best of me I practically threw him into her arms," Dean through his head sighing.
Dean smiled, picking up the speed to go along with his amazing multitasking skills, using his tongue to lick the underside of his dick.
"What's up, Sammy?" Dean came out of his closet, in a gray robe to be in something more comfortable.
"It was alright. I fixed up a few cars, but better now that I get to see you" Dean bent down to kiss the side of Castiel's head, realizing his mistake as soon as he did it, straightening himself back up "sorry it's a habit."
"I can get you something for that," Charlie slid off the bed, walking towards the door "and I need to get your doctor, so he can run some tests. You probably need a minute."
No matter how hard Cas tried, he couldn’t get that dream out of his head; it was clouding his mind. Not only did it feel so real which made him have to finish himself off, he didn’t understand why he had that dream about Dean of all people. That man was his teacher; a very hot teacher – no Cas stop you can’t think like that!
Passing by some customers who were having their own conversations, Castiel strutted his way passed them and towards his teacher.
The rest of our "Day of fun" they literally laughed at nothing having the same sense of humor just enjoying our time together walking around some more.
Castiel lit up so happy to see a familiar person "Of course I know you Charlie. What kind of question is that? You have been my best friend for fifteen years. And don't call me Mr. Novak, ever again!" he didn't like the sound of that.
Walking out in the hallway, Dean and Sam were where she left them "I thought everything was okay?" Sam questioned her.
“I want to know what happened.” Dean insisted. He was really good at reading people and could see Cas was a punching bag to some ass whole kids at this school.
Cas smiled small towards him "And so we don't have any kids?" They were making their way back up onto the elevator.
“I bet you’re going as Hermione Granger” Kevin told her always knowing what person she would pick to go as.
Castiel didn’t mind it, really “You can call me Cas or Cassie or Castiel…” even though he was used to being called Cassie from her.
For that comment, the older Winchester turned up the volume to bother his little brother “What? Sorry I can’t hear you!”
“Wait” he announced to Charlie during homeroom “So why are you taking Mechanics with me?” he didn’t think it would be a class she would take, but it wasn’t one he would ether.
Dean was content at the sight seeing that his blue eyes glowed at the ring "Glad to see you like it."
Dean was struggling to get free; the cuffs were pretty tight. "So, you're cheating on me? How could you do this to me?"
Castiel shot up in bed, the book falling off of him as he found himself breathing heavily. Why did he dream of something like that?! Feeling a sensation, Cas looked down to see something sticking up, his penis rose from the dream of Dean. Castiel's eyes grew wide at the sight before him.
"We shouldn't tell Cas something he does deserve to know right, Cas" Dean stated to his friend in a sarcastic tone.
“Well I then it’s something I can recommend to you then” Cas thought he should give it a try since Cas was going to try the series Dean was reading.
It was thrilling to hear finally some progress "That's great if it did the more should be coming back to you soon"
"Tell you lies that manipulative bastard!" Meg bad-mouthed him "he made you think you're something else and to drop out of being a rich doctor. He didn't tell you any of this?"
Kevin spoke for Charlie “You spaced out a little bit there and looked like you were about to collapse.”
"Charlie, De and I wanted to ask you something" Cas started, it's why they had her come over, she suggested she'd bring ice cream.
“No, the nurse told me it is just a sprain and to keep icing it as much as possible until the swelling goes down.” Cas told him, wanting to go closer, but he didn’t let his feet move. “But we were playing dodge ball. Got hit all over at once, but my face got hit the hardest” as everyone could tell.
Castiel’s heart slightly sunk, that wasn’t something he was proud of being eighteen, but it was not false. “Yeah…” was Dean going to think less of him?
"Sorry, I can't help" she apologized as if she had to. She did help with the room with the easy stuff but she couldn't with the crib.
He finally looked towards her not understanding why she was apologizing. “This was my fault, Channing not yours. I need to watch where I am going.”
Cas smiled at him, of course he would be used to coming home to kiss his husband he didn't mind honestly "It's alright."
He will probably make it home by 9 - 9:30 tops depending if there is any type of traffic, hopefully they would still be awake.
Dean nodded. He pushed his rolling chair back a little for Cas to let go of him. Cas watched while Dean took off his shirt, on his chest was two big scars that ran across his six pack. "Remember you asked me how I got these scars and wouldn't answer you?"
"Happy?" She let out a chuckle "You're making me miserable! First you drop out of med school without discussing it with me.."
"How can she help you remember when you haven't seen her in nine years?" Dean's voice raised slightly.
Mr. Winchester looked their way giving her a look before turning back at Castiel “Castiel? Interesting name” hearing that Castiel felt his cheeks growing red. Why was that happening? “What authors do you like?” he actually sounded interested as he didn’t even question anyone else on what they said.
Silence filled the room for a moment before most of the class started laughing at her question due to the fact, she got his name wrong. The teacher even chuckled along with them.
Garth pulled out his little friend “Are you sure cause Mr. Fizzles can sense when you’re being a LIIIIARRRRR!”
Cas was sitting with Charlie as she looked around for some chicks. "You know I had a memory come back of Sam and Eileen's wedding yet I haven't had one of mine and Dean's. he sadly took a sip of his beer.
"Cas!" Dean came the moment he felt Castiel's hot cum spurt into the condom, it was an extremely erotic feeling, his body clenching as he came.
“You scared me there a little bit” Charlie commented “Are you okay? Your face is red. Do you need to see the nurse already?”
Castiel did explain himself "I wanted to get out for a bit. I apparently have a usual for lunch and I ran into Meg."
It didn't have a happy mood like it usually did when she entered. It felt so gloomy "Hey Sam where is Dean? Or Cas?"
He could only hope "Can I just stay with you tonight? Let us cool off and refresh tomorrow?" He didn't want to face Dean right now after what happened.
"Can't wait" That made Castiel smile which radiated off of him and onto Dean making him smile back as they gazed into each other's eyes. With the bell ringing again, it snapped the two of them out of it as student's pilled into Dean's last two classes of the day.
Cas chuckled he didn't mind "It's okay we wear each other's clothes all the time. If you want to know your section is on the left of our closet."
Walking through the progressively crowded hall was hands down the most beautiful being he had ever seen wearing black boots, jeans, a plaid shirt, and a black leather jacket.
Other nurses and doctors were very confused to hear excited screams coming from the room they were in.
"Oh, and its Friday so on Friday nights we usually order pizza and watch a movie." Dean wanted to let Cas know "Sam and Eileen might be joining us."
"This isn't like a broken bone brains are less predictable. It seems that due to the swelling tissue pressed against the skull it caused some impact." It was something nobody could control.
Castiel look two Advil’s this morning hoping that it will subside the pain soon. He didn’t really like taking off of school, he didn’t want to make up for missed work. Sure, school was Hell for him, however he loved to learn and his school work was more important that ass wholes who try to ruin his day. “I will be okay. I will just rest later when I get home. If I can’t handle the pain at some point, I will go to the nurse.”
Cas smile at her, he could tell he liked her already "Hello, Eileen, Sam" he didn't really know them right now, so he didn't have too much else to say.
“What kind of car is it?” Cas didn’t know too much about cars. He used his to get around that is about it.
Then Cas realized something "Wait why do I even care? I have Dean, who I'll never leave. You are nothing to me, so you better hope I never see you again. Bye, Meg."
Dean's eyes shifted to Castiel. It's been weeks that Cas has been laying in the same position, not moving. Now Sam noticed Cas shift his body slightly, his eye starting to flutter open trying to adjust to the bright white room. He was in the hospital? With machines connected to him what's going on? There are people here, he's not alone.
"I know" Sam looked up from his phone, he had to ease Dean's mind "he will be" he can only pray and hope for that.
Dean helped him put the rest of the pictures in order until Sam and Eileen came home and it was time for their night.
Feeling a presence in front of her she looked up and smiled "how can I help y-" she paused seeing how attractive Dean was "Oh hello."
"No" she frowned "He has to wake up on his own then we will know when we run tests. He is so lucky nothing else happened to him some scratches but that's about it." Other things could've gone wrong, that seatbelt pretty much saved his life.
Finally having time, Cas and Dean were able to put the final piece of the baby room together- the crib, which never comes already made.
“You work at a bar to serve drunken idiots, you don’t need to do much” Dean joked slightly, getting back into the driver seat.
Dean poured himself a beer, even though bartenders aren’t really supposed to, but it was his family’s bar, so he didn’t care. One wouldn’t hurt.
Making the tea, Meg questioned aloud "What is something we haven't discussed? Do you remember prom?"
So here Castiel was at work wearing a loose ponytail, and a yellow apron over his clothes as some song by Bob Marley played through the speakers.
Within a couple of minutes, Dean pulled over near a secluded area along the water. The sight Cas was met with took his breath away. The sun was beginning to set casting a beautiful glow of orange and yellow looking like a perfect photo. "We're here come on" Dean got out of his side.
"How do I believe you?" Cas would love to know "She told me you broke us up and you're the manipulative one!"
Dean hurried over to him to help him up “Cas are you okay?” he didn’t see what happened if he tripped or what.
Without another word Cas pulled him back in wrapping his arms around Dean's neck, the passion firing up encircling the both of them, lost in a trance.
"Well yeah," She knew the day of "but I was second to know. Tony told Sam first thinking I'd let it slip to you.... I almost did."
“Yeah” at least she helped in a way to get him back to reality instead of him looking like a creep. Castiel don’t know what is wrong with himself.
Without them saying a word with growing grins on their faces, which slightly made them look creepy. He asked one more time “What?”
Cas sat himself down, getting comfortable as he closed the door. When the door clicked shut, Cas got a whiff of his cologne that filled up the car. It was a pretty good smell that hit his nose.
Dean nodded “If you would like to borrow my books you can.” He promised to him “I’ll give you the first book if you really want it.”
"Here you go" Jo placed two glasses in front of them before a person came to the bar to order a drink.
“You know you’ll be spending most of the day reading.” Charlie chuckled knowing him well enough to know how he would spend his day alone.
Meg placed his mug in front of him, smiling that he even remembered the color "Not as handsome as you."
Sam, Eileen, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Bobby, and Benny have all come to visit Cas in the hospital to see how he's been doing. Dean was grateful for them to have done so, caring for Cas and his health.
"Don't make the same mistake" His mom crossed her arms not believing they were basically having the same conversation "Meg is good for you. Anthony is not. You're not gay, stop this fantasy!"
“I get it, I want to see Dorothy.” Charlie really liked this girl and only saw her five days a week, just shy to go up and ask her out. Well, she is unsure of what Dorothy’s sexuality is. “You want to see that hottie one more time before Monday.”
"Dean" His mother had a comeback "I wasn't aware they let your kind wonder so freely around such a nice neighborhood."
Channing seemed to agree “Absolutely.” She grabbed his arm, so he wouldn’t lose his balance to walk down two long hallways where his homeroom was.
Meg did the calculation ten years ago he was still in her life "So you don't remember Dean, is he gone?"
Charlie shook her head knowing that Dean listened to Metallica to calm himself down, but she wanted to talk to him, so he went over to his phone and shut off the Bluetooth. Yes, Charlie easily knew his passcode.
“Ow! Son of a Bitch” Castiel’s right arm flew up on instinct as his hand started rubbing where the pain was to make it feel better.  “Why?”
Then it got to Castiel, so he told the teacher “I am Castiel and I love to read” it was one of his favorite things. He couldn’t help it. Reading helps escape reality for a little while and enter this whole new world.
Pushing him back towards the bed, the back of Dean's knees hit the edge of the bed to lay down. Castiel crawled his way on top of Dean, straddling his hips to take his head in his hands and lean in to kiss those perfect lips.
“Cas?” Charlie mumbled to herself amused. She never heard anyone call her best friend that and Castiel didn’t correct him.
“Thanks for the offer” It was nice of him too offer Castiel had to admit “but I don’t live that far away I-” that was true that’s why Cas usually just walked myself to work.
"I like that, but I feel like we bypassed the first date when we made love last night" they didn't go on dates yet, they went right to making love last night.
"To you?" Cas groaned back "I'm telling you how I feel. I was miserable and now I'm happy. Don't you want your son to be happy?" Aren't parents supposed to be supportive?
"He's out of jail way sooner than he is supposed to be and he's working at the hospital that you go to" Dean finally told him.
Cas did want to know "okay" open the fridge hoping to find a water to quench this thirst as he did, feeling Dean's eyes on him. Cas paused himself "Why are you looking at me like I'm some kind of zoo animal?"
Cas gave his mother a look "You stopped talking to me because I fell in love with Dean and you show up because you care?"
"You'll get there. You will remember that I promise you" Charlie reassured him. Cas was already making amazing progress. "That was a fun day I was your best girl."
“It’s never too early to listen to good music” Dean protested before adding on “unless you want me to put on Asia”
"And I am an architect now?" Last time Cas remembered he wasn't studying for that, but Charlie mentioned that to him a few hours ago.
Dean understood knowing she couldn't "No heavy lifting" it was up to the two of them to figure it out.
Not wanting to drive in silence and have a good ride, he put in Metallica to drum along to, on the steering wheel.
“I better go Mr. W- Dean.” Cas finally stated, he figured Charlie would be waiting for him ether by their lockers or his car.
“What were you talking about when I wasn’t paying attention?” Castiel wondered, since he was in fact not listening with someone on his mind.
"He was upset last night," Sam figured Steve should know, as he opened the front door. Cas didn't have his key.
By the time they finished, the two friends found themselves walking along a fountain in Quaker Park.
"Yes" Cas felt sick and it wasn't because he was seeing them together. He could care less, but seeing the sight of Crowley in person after what he put Dean.
"I am letting you do that, but I'm just trying to help you regain your memories. I can't do that if you're going to argue with me." Dean wanted more than anything to help him.
In Lawrence, Kansas we have a leather jacket wearing, pie loving man named Dean Winchester. He is a thirty-two-year-old, who co-runs a successful Mechanic business alongside father like figure, Bobby Singer, and best friend Benny Lafitte. What else needs to be said about Dean? Well, a big part about Dean was that he had an ex-husband from his early twenties. He was married to a horrible man named "Fergus" Crowley Macleod. Wait a minute.... Dean was married to a man? Yes, Dean Winchester is an open Bi Sexual. He loves girls, but he has a bit of a preference for men. Anyways, with that information, Dean divorced Crowley nine years ago after only being married for two years. They dated around three years before that until Crowley proposed..for all the wrong reasons. Basically, so he can "own" Dean and control him. If you are thinking "Did Dean's family like this Crowley? Did Dean's friends like this Crowley?" It is not that they liked him, they tolerated him. They acted civil around him while Crowley did the same. No one close to Dean could put their finger on why they disliked Crowley up until they found out what was going on behind closed doors. Crowley was abusing Dean mentally, emotionally, and physically. Being the way Dean is, he took the hits and believe all the hurtful things Crowley has said about him because he was so insecure and thought low of himself. That was up until Dean's little brother Sam or what Dean calls him "Sammy," found a deep purple bruise on Dean's stomach. Dean tried to deny it, but Sam knew it had to be from Crowley. After so much talking, Dean finally admitted to what was really going on. Sam was starting out as a lawyer and divorce lawyer wasn't his expertise, but was going to find the best lawyer for him. When that day came in court, Dean didn't want to bother anyone by coming however everyone else had other plans. Sam, his long-time girlfriend Eileen, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Benny, and Bobby came to support him. Where were his parents Mary and John? They died in a house fire many years ago when Dean was only four years old and Sam was 6 months old, but they had to be there supporting their son in spirit. Did Dean win? YES! Crowley tried to deny it all, but Dean had so much evidence to back it up that Crowley was indeed found guilty putting him in jail.
She was never going to let that go? This doesn’t help his situation “Charlie, stop calling him that!”
"I am going to need you in me," Dean begged, letting his hands fall from Cas "I can't last too much longer."
You could say that day by day more memories were flowing back into Castiel's brain some hurting more than others, but for Cas the pain was worth it.
“Uh” Castiel started fidgeting with the strap of his apron unconsciously “It is a coffee I made” one day at work a while back he got bored on a slow day which had him ended up playing around with coffee and came up with an interesting tasting coffee. Coworkers have tried it, Charlie had tried it, leading to the manager trying it. She liked it so much that she had customers taste it getting to the point where they started ordering it. It was coffee with two pumps of caramel, a little pinch of sugar, and right amount of honey. Castiel never knew something such as that would be successful. My coworkers started following my lead, making their own specials to sell here.
Charlie jerked away from Steve letting go of his hand to run away as fast as she could with him charging after her. She had no idea where she was going, but she just ran where her legs dragged her.
The door opened followed by a voice “Sorry I’m late I had to speak to the principal for a moment” the voice was slightly deep as it shot through Castiel as it did the class, well the girls. Everyone grew silent turning their attention the person the voice belonged to.
After a while, he wanted fresh air going out for a walk since he can't drive, maybe get something to eat for lunch stopping into a cafe looking at the menu "can I have a....?"
“It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant. Heat of the moment shone in your eyes.”
"Are you trying to make me diabetic or just fat?" From talking, a piece of pie fell out of his mouth making both men start laughing.
Dean Jumped out of bed, his mind not being able to take it anymore having him come back to reality. His heart was aching. Why did he dream that?
“You should come visit me at work.” Charlie suggested, give her some company, as she pulled into a spot nearby Garth’s car.
It was only a matter of seconds for Dean to begin thrusting his hips upward, rubbing up against Cas; their growing bulges moving forcefully against the other creating wonderful friction in their jeans, only adding more wood to the fire burning within their lower abdomens.
Charlie walked into the room starting her shift, frowning at her friend, who was looking at his husband sadly "Dean, you look like shit."
With a shake of the bed, Cas jolted awake to see Dean sitting up "Dean?" he asked tiredly, "what happened?"
"Just a man and his will to survive" Dean was already so far gone, into the song "So many times it happens too fast" Scratching an itch on his arm, he got up to sit on the roof of the car fixing his shirt in the process.
