He leaned back a little, a smile creeping up his thin lips. “By the way, did you know that Arendsen is mated to an Omega? I’d say that says a lot about his integrity as well as his objectivity.”
Greg’s face was full of compassion. He shuffled in his bag and found a printed form. “Here, I’ll fill that out with everything you have told me, you just need to sign. By signing, you’re accusing Mr. Christopher Jack Taylor officially of drug-facilitated sexual assault and the court will be informed. I have a picture of Mr. Taylor here with me, I need you to look at it and confirm to me it was him that attacked you.” He turned to John. “I need your statement as a witness, too, by the way. Maybe we could do that right after?”
But not him. He was unavailable. For dates. For friendships. For anything, really.
“What? Sherlock, what’s going on?” John couldn’t process what was going on.
But John had seen who had caused the microscope to fall down: it had been Sebastian who had shoved the expensive tool from the table as he passed it, then quickly had stepped around Mason, away from the destroyed instrument on the ground. It was Scott who was standing directly in front of the microscope now, staring at it with wide eyes and parted lips, as if trying to comprehend what just had happened.
“Hey, John!”
The question took Sherlock by surprise and he reeled back a bit, his mouth closing as he came up short with a fitting retort. But it only took him another second to recover and he took another step forward, right into John Watson’s space, trying not to shiver at the growing scent of the stormy sea, rising waves crashing down in building anger.
“John. John, are you deliberately ignoring me? And why are you smiling like a bloody idiot?”
He swallowed down a lump in his throat as he held Sherlock even tighter.
John quickly found the little path and found himself in said St. Edward’s Park. It seemed totally abandoned, he didn’t hear any sounds.
“I can and I will. You’re still too weak to fight me anyway.”
“No, no trouble, “he shouted back, placing the full glasses of beer in front of his friends, “only annoying people who cannot take a hint.”
, he tried to tell that voice, but it was no use since he couldn’t really think. His hands trembled as he raised them to his temples, as he tried to block out these voices in his head, shouting at each other.
“No, please, just sit down, alright?”
Greg had a point there. There were no lights on, so apparently, none of the employees or managers working here was still around. That didn’t have to mean Sherlock wasn’t here, though.
It seemed there was little else his mind could focus on nowadays.
“Of course, Sherlock. That’s what friends are for.”
“And you didn’t fail.” Billy finally looked up from the pictures and grabbed Charles’s shoulder firmly. “I’m so proud of you, little brother. This means so much to me.”
“Yes? You’re really making me nervous here, John, “Sherlock said, his voice rising with anxiousness.
“Sherlock?”
One could think they were still in secondary school.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, dinner would be wonderful, thank you, “Mycroft answered instead, gracing her with something akin to a thankful, honest smile, “Doctor Watson is at the police station, giving his statement. He should be back soon.” She looked at him doubtfully. “Oh dear, “was all she said and after another hesitant look at Sherlock, she scurried off.
His breath hitched and she drew back with a triumphant smirk.
His mind flashed and another scene appeared before his eyes: him returning home from school at eleven, with a bloodied nose and red eyes from crying because he had been betrayed by the only person, he had ever considered a friend, Victor Trevor. They had been friends for about half a year since Victor had shown up one day in class, having just moved here with his family from across the country. They had been assigned lab partners and because Victor had been very interested in science, Sherlock had offered to explain some of the experiments to him, eager to speak to someone who could potentially become his friend, but also cautious because of his experience with other boys. Victor had been enthusiastic and from that day on they had been very good friends. Such good friends that Sherlock even forgot about Redbeard for a while. Until Victor betrayed him and attacked him out of the blue after school with a bunch of other boys, mocking him for being a posh idiot, kicking him until they left him alone on the ground, bruised and bloodied.
John chuckled and he waved the very young, scared nurse standing in the doorway with a tray in her hands, forward.
He drifted in and out of consciousness and he was annoyed at his helplessness, being at the mercy of this sudden unexpected illness taking hold of him. But he was too weak to fight it and he was just thankful that whenever he came to, John was right there with him, holding him, speaking to him, making sure that he was okay.
John scrambled out of his bed, grabbed a knife from the tray, and started to smear butter and jam on one of the toasts. “It’s not. You have to eat.” He offered the toast to Sherlock who stared at it as if it were something toxic.
Greg nodded at him and he laid a hand down on John’s shoulder, squeezing it affectionally. Then he turned and left.
What had he been thinking? He wasn’t usually like this, he was no stupid Alpha macho. He usually respected people’s boundaries and he really didn’t know what had come over him to behave towards Scott like that.
He stared at John and looked him right in the eye. “John, tell me what happened yesterday.”
“But…” Sherlock seemed at a loss. “It’s normal, isn’t it? Touching each other when you kiss…”
“I was extremely lucky, “Molly answered and John could hear the gratitude in her voice. “My parents have these friends, they live a few towns away and only visit once every often. One Easter, they came over and they brought their son with them, Tom. He was 22 and I was 19. He was an unmated Alpha. He has his own repair shop, for motorcycles you know and he works hard, he’s always at the shop and he usually doesn’t go out.  And well… we sort of hit it off right at the beginning. I don’t want to say it was love at first sight, because that sounds kind of lame...but well. We had a few dates and it was just so wonderful. He asked me to mate him after half a year of dating.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, instead, he drew his legs up against his chest and wrapped his arm around them. It was one of his ‘pouting’ positions, although he didn’t even realize it.
“Fine, but I will tell you to stop if you’re singing out of tune, ” Sherlock murmured petulantly.
“Goodbye then….” Scott was already turning away, stopping mid-movement with a puzzled frown on his face. “I don’t know your name.”
Living here on campus did not mean that the world had changed. It just was different people, different surroundings, but the same rules applied. Sherlock knew these rules and he was fine with them. He knew how to get around in this world. He knew how to get by.
When Mike came to collect him for a couple of beers with a few blokes from the room next door, he agreed only because he knew there would be a lot of questions if he didn’t. He laughed along when his friends made fun of some of their new professors while he nursed his bottle of beer but he wasn’t really into it and said his goodbyes earlier than usual, claiming he had a headache.
Maybe going home with Tonya wasn’t such a good idea tonight, he thought as he slowly pushed through the crowd towards the bar. He wasn’t really into it at this point. Ironically, he still wasn’t affected by the alcohol either as if fate had decided that he didn’t really need that tonight.
They turned to see a red-haired girl at the door to the auditorium wave at them, then indicate her watch silently.
He wanted to grab the Beta and pull him away from the disgusting old man. He wanted to shake his shoulder and tell him
Exams are finally over, whew  :) Somehow, this turned out a lot longer than I thought. On another note, this story is more and more turning from "Strangers to lovers" into "Enemies to lovers"... What do you think? I really hoped you enjoyed reading the new chapter. Ah yes, and Merry Christmas :)!
“I’m stupid. You must think I’m an idiot.”
“However, we were both worried about you and wanted to make sure you were alright, especially you, brother mine. On top of that, we have rather agreeable news.”
He cradled Sherlock’s head in his lap and patted Sherlock’s cheek softly. “Sherlock? Can you hear me? Wake up, please.” No reaction. He felt his forehead and found it a bit warm. He was breathing normally though.
Once our valleys were ringin
“Oh, I bet you I can, “Sherlock said, his voice confident, and he started to push himself off the bed to prove it. John tried to stop him, but Sherlock shook his arm off and got up.
“Good. You gave him his antibiotics I assume?”
A single eyebrow was raised haughtily. “Yes. And you’re the bloke from Magnussen’s class who stared at me.”
“John, calm down, we’re gonna find him but it’s not gonna help him if you collapse from hyperventilating.”
There was something he had missed, he realized tiredly. He had to concentrate….
Sherlock opened his mouth as if to hurl more unwarranted insults at the man, but he caught John’s subtle shake of the head, his blue eyes pleading him to please keep his mouth shut – and surprisingly enough, he shut it again.
Sherlock didn’t react. It seemed he didn’t want to talk about the examination and John understood why. He felt honoured that his friend had wanted him to stay, that he needed him as a friend. But he also knew that it had been hard for him, to surrender his dignity – well, at least in his mind – and to let himself be subjected to this – again, in his mind – ridiculous examination. It meant a lot to John that Sherlock had been willing to let him be present for that, maybe it had even given him the strength to go through with it, he hoped so at least.
He softly opened the door and stepped inside. Sherlock lay in his bed, in the dreaded hospital gown, head lying on propped-up pillows, and he was hooked to an EEG monitoring his brain activity. The nurse from before was just handing him a glass of water and a small white pill. At the soft noise, Sherlock looked up and John was touched to see relief and a small flash of happiness in his friend’s green-blue eyes.
“Alright, “he said with another heavy sigh, “would you mind making us some tea, Mrs. Hudson? I’m sure a hot beverage would do Sherlock some good.”
At last he was able to stumble out of the pub and he relaxed instantly at the mild October air greeting him. He hadn’t taken his coat with him but he wouldn’t stay outside for long so that wouldn’t be a problem. He positioned his glass of beer on a spot on the wall next to him, rummaged in his pockets following a sudden craving, and found what he was looking for,
“Goodness, John, you’re falling asleep in your shoes, “Mrs. Hudson exclaimed suddenly, and she got up to pull at John’s jacket which he still hadn’t taken off. “Please, you can tell me the rest of your story tomorrow, please go to bed now, you must be exhausted from your travels.” She was of course right and suddenly John was excited at the thought of lying down in his own comfortable bed instead of a foreign albeit cosy one.
Mycroft spoke up again. “I’ll see what I can do about Doctor Watson’s situation.”
Charles leaned forward into Sherlock’s space, his face twisted into an angry snarl. “Maybe not. I could decide to just cut out your annoying little tongue, no more nonsense spilling from that filthy mouth of yours. Cut your eyes out, too, so you wouldn’t be able to identify anyone. Still seems a better alternative than to die. Your corpses rotting at the bottom of this river. Your choice, mate.”
John smiled as he spat the toothpaste back into the sink and rinsed his mouth. He had always wanted to be a doctor and he was on his good way to becoming one. He had already successfully completed a third of his studies now and he would not let anything get in the way of getting his degree.
They agreed to meet Lestrade in one hour in which he would make all the arrangements for the murderer to be settled at the police station.
“That doesn’t have to mean anything, “Greg tried to calm him down, “maybe he hurt one of them, and he managed to escape.”
Sherlock did not wake, he only sighed in his sleep, pressing his nose into the hollow of John’s throat, his arm a light, possessive weight around John’s waist.
“Sherlock, what’s going on here?”
A short almost hysterical laugh escaped John’s lips. “Are you serious, Mycroft?” he asked incredulously. “I resigned myself to spend at least the next ten years of my life in prison and you ask if it’s alright that you send me nice things to eat and sleep with until you’re having me released? Really?”
He was still pulling out files, scowling at and disposing of them in seconds but still there was nothing.
Sherlock Holmes. Sleep evaded him for a long time until he was finally released into a peaceful slumber.
“I mean it, John. I feel quite good. Still a little tired, howsoever that’s possible. My shoulder is still throbbing a bit, but that’s all. My headache’s gone. I feel fresh and clean and I have eaten my fill. So, really, John, I mean it.”
She saw right through him though. “Are you going to have a panic attack, Mr. Holmes?” she asked in feigned concern, as she leaned forward to whisper into his ear. “Please don’t. That would be just …. boring.”
Tenderly, he took Sherlock’s wrist from his arm and held it in both his hands, slowly stroking him reassuringly. “Of course, “he said quietly. “Always, for you.”
“Oh, there’s a lot.” John wracked his brain for the most important things to ask. “Tell me about yourself maybe? I’ve just recently realized how little I know about Omegas, and to be honest, I feel a little ashamed. Just because I don’t know any personally, doesn’t mean they’re not important. You exist, but I almost don’t know anything about you. So, I’d be interested in how your everyday life is like. You’re studying medicine, right? Why? How did you get to meet your mate? What is his stance towards your Omega status? How does it feel like to be bonded?”
He thought of their first chase through London’s streets and how they had fallen back against the wall at Baker Street, laughing together, next to each other, a warm fluffy feeling in his stomach.
“Okay, great, so you’ll take care of him?” The nice waiter with a name starting with a B or a P asked. “Because I don’t think he’s well, he should probably go home.”
“Yes?”
Then he realized that Sherlock was trembling and everything came crashing down within seconds.
Greg got up as well. “Of course, Sherlock, I understand.”
“Could you describe the bloke who helped our friend a little more in detail, please?”
He stepped forward, approaching a blonde girl in the first row, and leaned forward into her personal space, inclining his head towards her.
One thing remained. A voice, rough and hoarse, telling him
“Thanks, Doctor. Goodbye for now. “Mycroft said quietly, and he left.
John shrugged. “Broke his nose, gave him a concussion. It doesn’t matter. The bastard had it coming.”
John was getting really anxious now.
“John, hey, “she exclaimed, pulling him into a quick hug and kissing his cheek.
“John, I’m sorry, but I need your statement, too, “Greg continued, “and I need you to come to the station with me.”
He opened the door, Greg right behind, when the deep baritone spoke up once more.
He stopped speaking and tipped his head back, considering something. “Yes, I think that was all.” His eyes snapped back to John again. “Did I get anything wrong?”
He wanted to say it out loud, but Sherlock was quicker. “I’m sorry I said that John. It was complete rubbish and not true. I … I was scared and didn’t know what to say.”
“Of course, “he said hoarsely, and he lay down next to Sherlock, after very quickly putting his clothes back on. To his surprise, Sherlock shifted even nearer and then laid his head down on John’s chest. Instinctively, John laid his arm around Sherlock, pulling him closer to his body.
“Hold on love, I’ll be right back, “John murmured before he darted off again to retrieve some more blankets and pillows from the cupboard in his own bedroom. He detested having to leave Sherlock alone for even a second more, but it needed to get done and he concentrated on moving quickly and efficiently because it would certainly not be helpful if he fell down the stairs in his hurry to get back to Sherlock and broke his legs now.
The brothers had a point though. How strange was it that they were having fun when they were about to be murdered?
John leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s still cold lips. He could feel the younger man tense underneath him and for a second he thought he had made the biggest mistake of his life but before he could pull back, Sherlock sighed and kissed him back.
“Here.” He gently grabbed Sherlock’s chin and pulled a little, so that his lips parted. He laid the pill onto Sherlock’s tongue and pressed the glass to his lips. “Drink this.” Sherlock’s head turned, away from the glass but John cupped his jaw and pulled him back towards him with gentle force. “Please, Sherlock. It’ll only take a second.”
“And I meant it then too.” John reached out to cup Sherlock’s face, brushing his thumb against his sharp cheekbone. “But then, I only referred to your brain, your intelligence, the incredible power of your mind. Now...I’m referring to you as a person.”
“No.” John took Sherlock’s face in his hands and spoke slowly, calmly, so that the other man would not miss a single word he said.
“I-I really don’t know what got into him, “John stammered.
John crossed the street at once and jogged up to the two men.
Bill gaped at them both. “I mean, Watson can’t know, he’s basically
They lie in the field together, the air rising with the sound of crickets and their own panting breath. Looking up at the stars, Sherlock says it’s beautiful.
“I like the cut of your jib, Watson,” said Greg. John glanced up at him and then looked quickly back at his plate. He was not used to all this attention from people wearing badges and other such distracting shiny things.
Sherlock had not come to school with an innate hatred of
The moon shone bright through the bedroom window; it was full that night and it gleamed like ivory.
“Well, then, let’s see how well you understand
Not so much as an eyelash flicker. Well and truly asleep, then. Quietly, he set down his violin, but something stopped him from immediately turning the camera on John.
“Well that’s a stup—” Sherlock began, the blush of irritation showing. He cleared his throat and smiled at John again. No one had really smiled at John that way before, and he was too young to know any better. “I mean,  why would I laugh? I won’t. I promise.”
John sucks a bruising kiss on Sherlock’s throat, above the collar line; a visible mark in the shape of his mouth.
House points, and then we’d lose the House Cup for sure.”
John giggled. “Metal-batism? Who’s the drunk one again?”
Head shyly down, enchanting embarrassment on his features, John treated Sherlock to a slow strip-tease, revealing the strong, weathered beauty of his body inch by inch as he pulled his shirt off. Soft and rounded in some places, functionally muscular in others, he wasn’t the artistic ideal of a well-sculpted man, but a life’s worth of chances taken and hardships endured were carved into his body, and they made him a masterwork. Sherlock wanted to drop the camera and gather him up in handfuls.
"Go to sleep John."
he do that with one hand, because John could feel the other on the back of his neck). "You do sound so
John knew that trying to find the purpose in Sherlock's actions was hopeless at times; the fickle man always grew annoyed when he had to explain himself. But he had to admit, he was curious as to whether Sherlock had taken him in out of curiosity, like some sort of science experiment, or out of something far more human.
Some stretch of time later (John couldn't say
"You make things very easy for me, John," he continued, voice lowering from the volume it'd risen to in his burst of emotion, "Easier than anyone I've met in my life. Things that I used to have trouble with are nothing but paltry shadows when I'm with you. Drugs. Routines. Comfort."
"I forgot you-that you slept on silk!" he gasped.
"I'm capable of it in dire situations," Sherlock replied, sitting alongside him with a book and his laptop. At this point, John was resigned to the fact that it was shared property and would never be free of Sherlock's strangely specific search history.
What he didn't consider was the fact that their hands were still linked, and that he was much stronger than a caught off guard Sherlock. John shifted automatically, twisting so he half-landed on his back with Sherlock partly on top of him, chests colliding and forcing out twin whumps of air as their legs entangled.
Cold rain soaked through his thin jacket and into his jumper below, sticking his hair to his forehead and sending a shiver down his spine. John didn't notice though, too caught up in the sentence now emblazoned in his mind.
"Of course
"But my observations are hardly ever wrong. You should take care of this soon," Sherlock said, thumb moving to skim just above the cut on his face, grazing the soft skin under his eye long darkened by their erratic schedules and leftover nightmares of war.
It wasn't a very good explanation for the thoughts that had been crowding his head and the other words that had been heavy on his tongue, but it seemed his echo of Sherlock's previous words helped. The man's lips quirked ever so slightly, and John found himself back in the presence of a more relaxed, if warier Sherlock.
"What do you think," John gasped, hand clinging to Sherlock's, "I'm
John sighed before carefully extricating himself from Sherlock. He didn't have high hopes he'd do so without waking him; Sherlock
of marble.)
He wasn't sure about the eyes in the microwave yet, or the hands in the fridge and all the chemicals on the dining table that John felt might start a fire at some point, but John wasn't squeamish, and he could always talk to Sherlock about the chemicals. He was sure he could, with time and every brain cell he possessed, reason with the man a bit. John had reasoned with many more difficult people in his life after all.
But Sherlock did pull back, a bit of anger in his eyes that turned into something intense as his fingers lightly touched his jaw, so different from the passion he'd showed a moment earlier.
Sherlock's pace quickened, mind back on the chase, and John only shook his head before following, scarf streaming behind him.
a genius after all), but his tone was distracted as his brow furrowed, "John…what are you doing on the
"I'll fret if I want to," John rasped for the sake of being contrary, but his hands reached out to settle gently across the broad, but bony stretches of Sherlock's shoulders. Tentative, but eager when Sherlock didn't shrug them off.
At least John was sure that he could rely on Sherlock to have a tidy enough appearance when he had to go out. Sure, his hair would always be messy, and his coat always left open to flap in the wind no matter how cold, but he managed to look presentable. Sherlock even
"Didn't know you could do this," John murmured, gripping Sherlock's bicep and feeling the new strength in the curve of muscle; firmer than it had been mere months ago.
"So, would you accept my help?"
"That's right," Sherlock confirmed, voice softer than he'd ever heard it. John had heard it be lethally soft and manipulatively soft, but never…
"No, I've figured out where he's going," Sherlock explained, texting adeptly with one hand as he tilted his head this way and that, "Are you

"I…wanted to make breakfast for you," he mumbled uncharacteristically, eyes flicking to the kitchen table.
"Of course. I make a note to remember what you say when I can," he said honestly, "You always say such clever things…"
slowed by it," Sherlock lied.
Sherlock's smile still held no teeth, but his eyes sparkled and danced as he stood and shoved his hands in his pockets, still managing to look regal despite the messiness the night had brought to his appearance as he walked out of the breakroom.
"Am I your mule now?" Sherlock asked, already getting out of bed, and John shrugged, kissing his cheek when he did as he asked.
As such, when John woke entangled in the finest sheets he'd ever had the pleasure to sleep in to the smell of something burning in the kitchen, he moved. Didn't even think twice about it; acting was better in some situations than pausing to think.

"If I bleed out from this little poke, I'd die in shame from an undiagnosed and incredibly unlikely case of hemophilia," Sherlock quipped, content to watch John squirm under the weight of his still intense gaze.
It was not John's thumb put into action, but Sherlock's. John's eyes shut, heart seizing like an animal caught in a trap as it swept across his cheek and caught the single tear that had slipped loose; the only thing that had escaped him instead of the jumble of words that were caught in his throat.
"Hmm," Sherlock hummed, ignoring his sarcasm. A strange expression crossed his face as if he was close to a deduction but was missing something important, "It's just that you look extremely disoriented."
John flushed a bit. He hadn't had a problem being bare-chested until Sherlock had strode up with the cleanest bill of health he could obtain, and now he was hyperaware of the fact that he had
Sherlock chuckled, and John blushed when he realized that he'd said all that aloud.
John swallowed once, then twice when the first didn't suffice in moving the bird that had once been in his stomach and was now lodged in his throat (and when had it ever gotten past his chest?).
Sherlock's voice was low now; soft and almost unsure in the latter half of his statement, and the vulnerability pulled at John in a way that made him want to drag his thumb across Sherlock's bottom lip and tangle his fingers in those damnable curls.
-that's why you can't find your shoes! That's the universe trying to tell you something!"
John leaned back and crossed his arms, nodding at Lestrade when he gave him an impressed look. Sherlock was back on track, motions fluid and dynamic as he spoke to the now largely attentive and compliant room.
The usual place, a hole in the wall diner with atrocious retro tile walls and fabulous cardiac arrest inducing waffles, was about the furthest one could get from the police station. It also wasn't

it there in response.
"And now?" Sherlock asked, the amusement now tainting his deep voice. John didn't think he'd ever seen the man so...
That day, and the day after, passed in a blur of sleep and sweat. John fell in and out of waking like it was an obstacle course, voices coming and going in distant volumes. Sometimes he heard Mrs. Hudson but the rest he could only assume were figments of his imagination or perhaps overhead calls, like Lestrade and Molly and once even Mycroft.
He'd sworn he wouldn't say anything to Sherlock, but that was back when John had naively believed the depth of this

to learn, but he wasn't quite there yet.
"I'm…I can't…put it out!" he exclaimed, voice raspy (oh fuck, he had been screaming) as he raised his hands to shield himself from the desert sun.
John's face softened. Sherlock had been remarkable steadfast throughout his illness, never voicing any complaints, but he could see the signs of sleeplessness and strain under his eyes.
For some reason, these words stood out to John Watson as he laid awake in his new flat, the ambient sounds of London fading as the words swirled around in his mind like water. He hadn't had the time to think upon them before, but now that all was quiet and
"The world would end before you did that, even with romantic intentions in mind."
Sherlock snorted, and John smiled faintly as his fingers clenched tight in the sheets.
red was too dark, too hot, too-
"You just answered the final question in my head," he breathed, feeling Sherlock's hands rest uncertainly on his waist, "I thought I'd answered it myself, but now I understand why it wouldn't go away. It had changed without me even realizing it."
Sherlock scrabbled at the mattress; eyes still shut. His brow crinkled as he realized John wasn't there before they flew open, the book toppling into his lap with a small thud as he sat up.
However, that didn't matter a single bit to John, who was only happy that Sherlock was hungry and wanted to eat. A small goal, minuscule and perhaps more than a little strange to some, but when it came to encouraging better eating habits, John would take whatever progress he could.
for once to keep being stubborn about it.
That is, until he had to handle Sherlock's blood.
"I didn't even know we had bacon."
"That was very graceful, John," Sherlock said, the words pressed into his bare shoulder.
"That's what sick people tend to do," John remarked, trailing off with a gasp when Sherlock sucked at a particularly sensitive spot on his neck.
John had ensconced himself on the couch, wrapped in his comforter as he gazed blankly into the fireplace. He'd had a dream about the war, and while they didn't plague him as often as they used to (he was too busy some days to even
John shuddered, entangling himself from the covers, nearly panicking when one of his feet wouldn't come free, before stumbling towards the door. In his hazy half-awake state, Sherlock sounded a hell of a lot better than the disorienting clash of the two environments around him: one hot, bloody, and dry; the other wet, loud, and howling.
Pressed up like this, everything from their chests right down to their calves aligned, John had confirmation for what he felt. Sherlock had a wholeness he'd been lacking when John had met the man in hastily taped together pieces; a bloom of health that drew him back from dangerous edges with every bit of time and care John had put into him.
, and…and I know that I'm wrong and selfish for it, but that's the way I
John harrumphed but took the opportunity to smile at his back before following. He already knew just how big Sherlock would want the pieces, but he didn't think he'd caught on to that yet.
Sherlock said nothing, and John looked up to see an odd expression on his face. At first glance, it could've been mistaken for a typical pensive Sherlock-esque look, but there was something different to it John couldn't place.
, but he wasn't terribly stiff either. His hands were palm down on his thighs, and his back was straight, but his sinewy limbs weren't held tensely. It appeared as if Sherlock just didn't know what to do with himself, and John hummed as he made the distinction.
"Ah-ha! I
"Come, John."

of all times would be the night for hard liquor.
"Are you
The bridge wasn't the highest in London, but John didn't want to go through the trouble of getting wet in the rank looking water and scaling the concrete embankment. If anything, the burglar they'd been chasing shoving him over the edge with a remarkably well-placed body check was more annoying than fearful for John.
He fell asleep like that, caught in thoughts moving through his head at varying speeds, but eventually settling on the ghost sensation of the hand that had stroked his hair.
His breath sounded too harsh in his ears, and he wanted another long sip from that bottle Sherlock had absolutely no right to have pulled out on a Thursday evening. John could feel himself coming undone; everything outside of him in a jumble that made no sense and only continued to pour out.
"Don't," he said quietly, suddenly getting the sense that the distance between them had closed in a way he hadn't anticipated when doing this, "It might still be hot."
For some reason, the thought amused him so much that he began to chuckle, fingers still drifting through the soft silk he couldn't see.
"Stupid,
Lightning woke him.
"Things could be worse," he murmured, shifting slightly and tugging the blanket tighter around him.
"Are you
"No, I would've. Maybe Mycroft would've swooped in like he did when I was on the streets, but…whoever he would've gotten to tend to me wouldn't have cared for me as you did."
In the morning after John's deep thought session, he unsurprisingly didn't remember much of his original thoughts to begin with. Bits and pieces lingered, intercepted by a faint memory of mournful violin music drifting through the wall. A hazy dream of marble statues coming to life, carved in the form of ancient gods caught him off guard in the very early moments of his wakefulness, but then something very heavy and expensive-sounding shattered in the kitchen and drew his attention. John slipped out of bed, managing to get a robe tossed on before exiting to deal with whatever situation his temperamental flatmate had started now, and in the moment that it took for him to get up and move, the dream slipped away like dust.
"My endurance is quite decent, thank you very much. You're just too embarrassed to admit you were slowed when your scarf blew up in your face."
"Looks like we'll be out of here soon," John said, letting his hands move away from Sherlock's side for the first time. The blood flowed sluggishly now, but his hands still felt strangely empty with loss.
Like a snake shedding his skin. Or, like a man shedding a façade. John didn't dwell on it, as he much preferred the dust to the sands that had drifted through.
"The word sounds like a syllable of exquisite beauty when you utter it."
A memory of sitting on the couch talking with Sherlock came to John, and he nodded as he realized that he'd been asked this once before.
. You…you wanker!" John exclaimed with a part huff of outrage and part chuckle. He was more than aware of Sherlock's dark sense of humor, but this was a different brand of teasing he wasn't used to.
John found that now he could almost relate to the words. In another situation, in another tone, he could almost see
"You're only cementing my point that you're the good man. Are you almost asleep?"
Sherlock gazed at him for a long moment, and John wondered if he could see what lay dangerously close beneath the calm surface he projected. Sherlock was adept at peeling away his layers, and perhaps-
"I started to suspect on this very couch," Sherlock mused, drawing his hand down the knobs of John's spine, "That morning I found you out here and I explained what hypnagogic meant. But it wasn't until later, when you used that word so casually, and correctly, that I knew."
of the information you do is that I persuaded Sherlock to adjourn a meeting like this instead of simply informing Lestrade. I know how peeved you lot get when Sherlock swoops in and out. The only reason this meeting even exists is because of me."
, why is your violin case open?" John asked, keeping down the screech of pain he wanted to let out as he jammed his toes against the leather case and nearly fell face-first onto the coffee table.
"Perhaps," John said, unsure of what else to say and settling on the vague word to buy his sleepy mind a bit of time. "Care to join me?"
"Please step back."
would empathize with my bloody scarf," Sherlock said, but there was no heat in his words. If anything, his odd expression reflected in his tone of voice. "Come. Lestrade will no doubt wonder why we are meeting him at a bakery."
"Sherlock."
(He didn't think about Sherlock dying. The thought was unthinkable, like trying to imagine the moon falling out of the sky or the sun ceasing to burn. In this one instance, John didn't consider Sherlock to be mortal, because thinking of his mortality made his chest ache in a strange way.)
"Perhaps it's because they're Mycroft's medics," he suggested on an exhale that he imagined ghosted across Sherlock's long, pale neck and tickled his Adam's apple. Controlled, small imaginings were what was necessary here to keep himself from burning up like a firework's lit wick.
! I can control absolutely everything about myself, even my addiction to a degree, except when it comes to you, John Watson," he said, eyes cutting to him in a gaze filled with both passion and petulance. "It is
He had misinterpreted John’s question, it had only been friendly curiosity, nothing more.
The nurse seemed not impressed by Sherlock’s outburst. She just met his gaze calmly and replied, “They will be here when it’s your turn, Mr. Holmes.” He tried to speak once more but she interjected at once. “They’re already at the end of the floor. If you could just be so patient to wait a little longer, and a doctor will be with you soon.”
“I can see you’re bitter about this, “he stated matter-of-factly.
“I can only repeat what I’ve already told you, “John replied calmly as he met the other man’s gaze and his mouth twitched as he tried not to smirk when he saw him narrow his eyes suspiciously.
“Are you okay?” the bloke asked and Sherlock was able to discover honest concern in his voice although it made his head hurt just to think about such things. He swayed a little more and then finally managed to really look at the other man.
“It’s less than what he deserves, “John growled out and everyone including Sherlock looked at him in surprise for his rather violent response.
“We have fifteen more minutes, “Magnussen said with a quick look at his watch. “Let’s make the most of it. Now, we’ll start with the very most basics….”
Magnussen continued to stare at him for a few more seconds. Then he nodded, smiled, and returned to his desk. Everyone in the room seemed to sigh with relief, excluding the blue-eyed boy who was staring at Magnussen’s back with barely repressed disgust.
As Sherlock started to get up Greg spoke up again. “But we still have to file your charge against Mr. Taylor. Drug-facilitated sexual assault. We still have to do that.”
“Oh, “was all she said when she saw how many people were in the room. Greg and Mycroft discreetly stepped into a corner to give her some room. She smiled at them thankfully and then addressed Sherlock, still looking at the chart.
“What do you mean, no?” he asked incredulously.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in response. “Oh please. It took me only one look at the crime scene and his bathroom to make the connection to your ‘establishment’. You have committed crimes you need to be punished for and I am the person who brings you that punishment. Why must you criminals always ask such stupid questions? It’s annoying and quite frankly, also very boring.”
“That sounds great, “John conceded, “but doesn’t it irk you that you need his permission to go to university? Or to do anything at all, that is”
When they finally arrived and put Sherlock on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face as a safety measure, at which Sherlock rolled his eyes once more, he was only allowed to ride with them because he was Sherlock’s doctor. He would have liked to hold Sherlock’s hand in the ambulance but didn’t of course. Instead, he was watching his friend’s face closely, observing if his condition was deteriorating in any way. He was worried alright, and he just wished they could drive a little faster to reach the hospital.
Sherlock was obviously overjoyed by this, so much that he grabbed his second toast and bit into it with gusto.
“Well, what happened before that? What happened before you beat him?”
“You just have to deal with it then.”
“Dizzy?”
“He depends on me?” John was shouting now, and he saw Greg raise an eyebrow in his peripheral vision, but he didn’t care. “He hates when I fuss over him and he has almost strangled me since the day when he was first attacked. I was the one who forced him to eat and sleep and have a rape kit done, forced him not to work the case the way he’s used to. I’m the one slowing him down, keeping him in chains and he resents me for it. It’s completely understandable, from his point of view. But he certainly does NOT depend on me!”
But then he was suddenly being addressed by the Professor and his attention snapped towards the older Alpha, instinct and pride taking charge as he pushed the other student out of his mind to meet the challenge presented to him. He was surprised when unlike the other students he was given more than one question and a new kind of heat rose within him when he saw the hunger in his Professor’s cold eyes, longing for him to make an error so that he could be dismissed as well.
He had no explanation for this, but he decided to just go with it. Even if he couldn’t explain this bizarre behaviour of his complicated brain, he was thankful it was finally allowing him to access something it had figured out but didn't let him see before.
John and Greg both leaned forward in unison, shouting “What?”
“So, I take it you don’t know this bloke?” Ben asked a little nervously. “I’m sorry, I thought he was his friend…”
He begged.
At this very moment, the brothers were sitting opposite each other – Mycroft’s luxurious cars naturally had that much space – glancing out of different windows respectively, silence stretched out between them, to no one’s surprise. Sherlock was well aware of the occasional scrutinizing look in his direction, but he did his best to ignore it. He wasn’t in the mood to talk, not with Mycroft, not with anyone else. He was desperately in need of some solitariness, he felt he hadn’t been on his own in ages.
"Oh no, science is cemented in fact, and so are my thoughts on it. Faith is a tricky, guileless thing that
"Shut up," John said mildly, averting his eyes to focus on wrapping Sherlock's hands. He could hear the teasing tone in his voice, which settled his nerves about the slip-up. Sherlock clearly hadn't read anything in it and was playing it off for his sake.
"I did your washing up too," he said, frowning as his mind flitted to a recollection from the day before. "You had another weird stain on one of your shirts. Really, Sherlock, you
"Dammit," he mumbled more audibly through a dry mouth, trying to focus more on Sherlock's warmth instead of the aches that tormented him, but to no avail. He couldn't ignore the fact that he'd woken in a shivering cold sweat in the wee hours of the morning.
"…Touché, John."
into Sherlock was better than nothing. John carried around crisps, granola bars, and other snacks in his pockets for Sherlock on the off chance he could slip one into the man's hand while he was distracted poring over insane amounts of information reports or files (in that state, he was easily persuadable to eat what John gave him). He started cooking more often and storing meals away when there was room in the fridge amongst the various body parts and suspicious liquids when he learned that Sherlock would sometimes sneak out and eat it in some odd respect for John's efforts.
"I'm fine. It's you I'm concerned about," he admitted uncharacteristically, his other hand moving to ghost across his face.
There was a beat of silence where John processed what he'd heard behind closed eyelids and Sherlock took a breath.
Sherlock was wasting away below all that high-strung energy he devoted to cases, and no one except him was
Just one touch would be all that allowed himself tonight. John couldn't say how much he cared; not like this.
Sherlock, however, was still trying to figure out how to show what he wanted to say and say what he thought he should show. He didn't have experience exposing himself because to be loved, one had to be known, and Sherlock was so used to knowing everything about everyone and no one knowing anything besides the pertinent information about him that he struggled opening up. All the convoluted languages that love came in were foreign to him, and Sherlock was
for me in the beginning when I was particularly obstinate and obtuse.
John's grin matched Sherlock's growing one as he tumbled back into bed, laughing when he got pinned to the mattress by Sherlock and his eager mouth.
"Mmm-
you didn't hit your head?"
It was a contradiction of sensation. Sherlock was warm, as warm as any human. Besides being a bit bony and taller, he fit as nicely as John had imagined against him. But his legs weren't even on the bed, and Sherlock was already wiggling like a worm on a hook.
"Is there a space cleared in the fridge?"
He hadn't expected the thoughtfulness at all from him. John was fascinated and attracted and confused by Sherlock at times and was proud to say that he understood him much better than most did. This meant he'd never deluded himself into believing Sherlock was something he wasn't, save for the few times he'd entertained fantastical thoughts of there being something more between them.
"You always sell yourself short. You possess a lot more than you think you know, otherwise, we wouldn't be in this position, now would we?"
feel surprised when the tall man sat down gingerly beside him on the side of the couch closest to the window.
On his left hand, on his ring finger, there was the slight gleam from a well-polished gold ring, although blood now trickled down half of it. He was approximately 37, no, 35, younger than one might expect for a drug lord, designer suit and gold Rolex speaking of one eager to show off his wealth, typical of a person who had grown up in abject poverty, as Kamanev had: a thieving, starving child in the ghetto. He owned a cat - no, two - from the stray hairs on his trouser legs. He wore a heavy, overly gaudy gold locket around his neck. Sherlock didn’t need to look inside to know that it contained pictures of his children. Obvious.
This.
“You’re mine,” Sherlock growled, squeezing John’s dick hard. John's gasp pierced the air, and he came with a shout, unable to control it, the sound of a man pushed to his limit and shattering. His seed spilled out between them, some on Sherlock's belly  but mostly splattering wet and warm on his own. His body clenched around Sherlock’s cock as he shook hard with the intensity of his orgasm. He milked Sherlock's dick like the whole purpose of his existence was to service him and Sherlock surrendered, molten heat twisting deep inside and then pulsing out in waves of pleasure, coming inside of John, spurting hot liquid pleasure deep into his bowels.
“...where the wind comes sweeping down the plain,” John says, unable to resist.
“One, I want it to be private, and two, I hate having my picture taken, it never comes out right. Now stop it!” John said. Sherlock reached up with his other hand to tilt the camera down and aim it at John. John ducked back, a hand flung up in front of his face.
The young man said, “Wanna ride?”
“So what, I’m short and drunk,” John said, giggling a little again. “At least I’m not
The chocolate biscuits were rather good, thought John later, as he settled in with his cup of tea. He looked over at Sherlock, who had methodically combined the creme fillings of all the biscuits he’d been given into one large creme-filled Frankenbiscuit, and was now attempting to dunk it without much regard for the mess. Even Carl was quiet, busy stuffing his mouth full of biscuits and occasionally spraying crumbs everywhere.
things that I could be doing. Yeah, lots of things. Productive things. Good luck, John! I’ll be praying for you.”
“Yeah,” John says, scrambling up to his feet. He is suddenly very sober. “I’m just going to...ah...go back to my bed and, um, sleep.”
Sherlock showed up only briefly for lunch and dinner. He took a few items of food and then disappeared. Nobody paid much attention. Later John found out that he went to eat alone in the Library.
"Yes, it is spiked," Sherlock says. "But not with very good alcohol. Come on. I'll get you much better stuff."
John was being ridiculous. It was completely illogical.
“Sherlock!” John said, and hurried over to the window almost on reflex. (When had it gotten so dark? It didn’t matter.) He pushed the glass up. He could hear himself, feel himself, once again, almost breathless. He didn’t care.
C’mon John, least you could do is have the decency to
John’s hands were so steady, the way they were in times of war and danger. He looked natural with a gun in his hand. Only his insides ever shook. His outsides were so neat. His mind was a mess. Sherlock thought of the barrel of the gun pressed to John’s temple again, the way that it had threatened to make a mess of them both. He reached out and stroked his fingers over the vulnerable spot of the temple, pressed in and took John’s pulse from his temporal artery. 30 beats in fifteen seconds. 120 beats per minute.
aloud, and so threateningly, too. It wasn’t a nice word to say, and if he’d done it at home he’d have gotten in trouble for it, for sure, but there was the thrill of saying something so
“And he was really, really thin and tall.”
“Yeah, yeah,” said John, and watched as he lost his sister again, as the four-headed monster had come back for its wandering limb.
"Something rebellious?” Although he’d said nothing of the sort, Sherlock’s tone brought something sordid to mind, as if John had been out necking with a girl before her folks came home.
John crosses the floor to take Victor’s face in both his hands, and he kisses him. Victor opens his mouth to speak, and John kisses him again to shut him up, kisses him silent. He kisses him until Victor is kissing him back, is pulling him down onto his lap, mouths meeting and parting until they are both quietly out of breath.
Sherlock pounced, pushing John down on his back to loom smugly over him. Oh yes, he looked agreeably mussed; his eyes were even darker than usual, and a lovely dusky flush lay across his cheeks. Sherlock smiled at him and lowered his mouth to the little pink bud he’d so far tormented only with his fingers.
“It says so on your trunk.”
His mouth opened, almost of its own accord, and a soft  “
Wait. What? No.
“You love playing on the beach so much, don’t you?” she said, needing the sound of a human voice in the eerie stillness.
Later he will want to say that it was Victor who kissed him first, grabbing at him, pulling him forward, but John is the one who tilts his face for the proper angle, who presses forward for more of the urgency of Victor’s mouth against his, whose lips part, opening with a small groan, already anticipating. Kissing Victor is familiar and new all at once, like singing along to a song where he doesn’t know any words, only the melody. The words are in another language. But the music is universal, the heady sort of desire that comes with drink and long pent-up frustration, over two months of shared sorrows and tension between them. Victor’s chest is flat against his, his hands strong, his body heavy when he pins John to the couch. The alcohol makes it easy to accept this, to enjoy it, even, the intimacy of another person, the warmth of another body, someone who desires him. He opens his mouth for the kiss, for Victor’s tongue, hot and wet and sliding against his, sucks the taste of Glenfiddich from it. He groans and arches his whole body up, one hand clenching in Victor’s hair and another on his shoulder. If Victor were a bit taller they might still fit like this, perfectly like this, if Victor was a bit leaner he would still feel similar to this on top of him, and Victor’s mouth was the same mouth that had once kissed Sherlock…maybe not like this…
“So you like horror?” Sherlock asked with genuine interest. Every answer John gave him seemed to brighten him up.
He could hardly remember what had happened at school that day, what classes he’d gone to, if he’d learned anything. He’d looked down at the lines of notebook paper, at the Battle of Georgetown and at Shakespeare, at all those letter equations and a diagram of the cell,  and all he could think about was the touch of Sherlock’s lips on his own.
sound like a girl!" John squeaked in indignation.
Not to amount to anything is easy - but to be nothing, now that was an ambition. To be negative space. To be the nothingness in space, consuming all.
“Better Holmes than gardens,” John said, half to himself, and laughed.  He was hopeless, they both were - no hope for either of them, getting out of this, but John didn’t think he could try anymore, when the trying was killing him worse than the having. For now he could pretend that he would never need anything more than this, Sherlock’s arms tight around him and the heat of his skin and the warmth of his bed and the sweaty smell of him and his kisses on John’s face and throat, mouthing
“Not to brag or anything,” Victor shrugs, coolly casual, “But I did play cricket in uni.”
“Are you usually out this late?”
There was no time for hesitation. He forced himself back up, bookbag on his shoulder, pulling his bicycle back up onto its wheels despite the stinging in his palms and the soreness in his knees, and the pain in his leg that made him limp, just a little.
“Geez, you know, too? Does everybody know? He made me promise not to tell anybody.”
John shot Sherlock a smouldering blue glare, and then turned back to punch a few more letters.
“Did you?” Sherlock asked him. “But you must have. But you didn’t. But maybe you did. Did you John?”
Of course, it wasn’t until John had already walked away that it occurred to him what he
Hazel splashed through the water, turning around and around until her head was spinning. Water, water, all around and the blue sky above. No sign of John.
. It screams loud to Sherlock: painful, put-upon domesticity by a woman desperate to keep up appearances.
At first Victor stays on the sofa, neither of them needing to talk about the way sleeping arrangements will go. But the week Victor intends to stay turns into two, and after that the days roll into each other, filled with trips to the various fancy cafes around London, and takeaway dinners, and excellent breakfasts, and easy conversation, stories about Sherlock, or what Sherlock might think, and horror movie marathons, and John is doing locum work again, and Victor has his firm send London cases his way, and there’s the dull ache that has nested in muscle caged by his ribs, and sometimes they laugh so hard their stomachs hurt, and one night John wakes at 2 in the morning from a nightmare to find Victor already up and making his horrible tea because he can’t sleep, and they’re forced to admit that kipping on sofas is not a long-term solution, particularly not for a man like Victor.
“I sleep with Billy sometimes,” Sherlock said.
“It was the door shutting,” she insisted, “the front door.”
“John! John, you little idiot, where’ve you gotten to?
“No, no, you don’t,” Mike said kindly. He paused, thoughtfully, and added, “And even if you did, you would sound like a manly girl.”
here,” John said, “I guess he left.” He tried not to sound quite so disappointed, and so he shrugged after he said it. He had been the one who had fallen asleep, after all. Sherlock probably had better things to do with his time than to sit around and watch over an unconscious person.
Local farmer Frank Stoeber began slowly knotting his way into fame in 1953. In just four years, the ball of twine  weighed 5,000 pounds, stood 8 feet high, and had 1,175,180 feet of twine on it.
"I promise you, nothing," Sherlock says.
It’s not bad. Victor is so easy to talk to.
How utterly dull. “Not believing in a thing doesn’t make it not real,” Sherlock said.
helpful and ended pulling up bunches of parsley and thyme, mistaking them for weeds. His grandmother smiled and shrugged, the way that grandmothers are wont to do, and said, “I’ll put it in a stew tonight.”
"Get in the car," Sherlock says, opening the door.
“What are stitches?” Sherlock wanted to know.
John went around to the back of the car; the trunk had already popped open, like a waiting mouth. It was large and empty and deep, and it could easily fit something like his bicycle, or, say, a body, especially that of someone his size.
,” John breathed, eyes wide and full of wonder. “Are you a...a...mer...thing?”
“Why?”
They stopped searching for the missing boy after one week. The newspaper stopped reporting on it after two weeks. And every night, before and after every radio program, between
wouldn’t forget.”
“I never would have predicted that for him. He was so brilliant it made my teeth hurt to think about it and he had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. He could have been anything and excelled at it. Actor, scientist, philosopher - you know.”
” Sherlock said, with deepest conviction, and obvious approval.
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, like the eyes of a cat, pale and glittering, catching the ambient light. Shadow. Shadow. Light again.
“God! If you’re going to do that-” He reached down to yank at his own pants, but Sherlock was in the way, between his legs.
"Shh," John said, and carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair, feeling the light dampness of fresh sweat. Sherlock said nothing, and squeezed him tight.
“What are you reading?” John asked.
“I guess what I’m saying is that sometimes I feel like your heart just isn’t in it, you know?”
“I’m a genius, John. Sex isn’t that difficult to understand.” The eyeroll claimed its own physical space. John thought he could see sparks go up where it collided in mid-air with the sinister emanations being put out by that lecherous grin.
H was before W, of course, so John would have to wait. “Sherlock Holmes!” they called out, and if Sherlock felt anything - nervousness, excitement - he didn’t show it. John held his breath as Sherlock walked up and took a seat on the stool, glancing up at the hat with interest. Meanwhile, John’s heart was doing its best imitation of a little toy drum, the kind with a monkey doll attached to it, banging away.
Surely this was blasphemy.  John had never heard anyone talk in such a shocking manner. Yet...he’d never had proof of God, or proof otherwise. All he knew was that he’d always been taught to believe. He had never been allowed to question.
“We should keep you tied up,” Sherlock suggested, perhaps a bit too brightly. But, surely, it was a bright sort of idea.
John opened his mouth to speak, and in doing so apparently deleted his entire vocabulary in an instant. His tongue dried up inside his mouth and his vocal chords failed him. His brain stuttered, he couldn’t even get his mouth to stutter because it hadn’t even gotten to that stage, and his heart was puttering away in his chest.
“Amazing!” John grinned at Sherlock.
The siren sounded: a long, slow wail spinning out into blue September sky.
He lifted up, slid his hand underneath John’s head, cradled it - his precious head, the fragility of his skull, his wonderful brain inside, still intact, still functioning and whole, still thinking his John-thoughts and managing all the minute, infinite processes required to be John Watson. It was a romantic misconception, really, to say that people loved with the heart. The heart was merely an organ -albeit an entirely necessary one - its sole purpose for the circulation of blood throughout the body. It was the brain that housed one’s thoughts, one’s personality in the frontal cortex, and one’s emotions in the limbic system, the capability for love buried in the hippocampus and amygdala; in the anterior thalamic nuclei and the septum; the habenula, the limbic cortex, and the fornix.
“And yours?” Victor prompts him.
Downstairs breakfast was waiting, and Harry was in the bathroom messing with her hair ribbon, making him wait for his turn, and he could hear the familiar sounds of paper bags rustling as Momma bustled about the kitchen, packing their lunches with all her curlers still in place.
Sherlock swept straight on past them, as if he hadn’t heard John at all.
Their new flat was in Birmingham; it was considerably smaller than their lovely cottage, and the rent was a touch high, but Tom managed to transfer his position to a bank in town. Hazel found work at a clinic two stops away from home. It would take the children a little while to integrate into the school system, but children were nothing if not resilient. They would adapt soon, and make new friends.
Sherlock licks until John is near-sobbing, writhing and whimpering and making the softest little broken sounds. John is arching up, body drawn tight. The leather of the seat crinkles beneath him, his carefully-styled hair ruffles against it, all his put-togetherness coming undone.
Sherlock didn’t know what it was like to spend Sunday mornings with his sister scouring the paper for coupons to make sure they had enough for groceries that had to last through the week, or what it was like  to eat meatloaf for weeks because hamburger was 50% off at Wegman’s because it was about to go off  and they’d bought it in bulk to freeze.
“Are you stuck?” asked John as he approached. He was a young boy, just about John’s age, maybe a little bit younger but definitely not older. He had pale skin and dark, curly hair, and wide, pale eyes that seemed to almost glow in the low light.
into a pudding. That was Sherlock’s favourite. Why couldn’t it have been
Sherlock snarled at him and made as if to get up, but he was quickly shoved down again.
“-and if you do
He wasn’t the only one who felt that awe. Sherlock's kiss was full of the wonder that he still had for this, in every press of lips amazement that John was his to touch, his to have; in every touch of tongue a discovery. He squeezed and rubbed John's body, enjoying the realness of him, the solid firmness of his thighs, the lush curve of his arse; all this was his, to reach for whenever he wanted. John warmed and softened under his hands, making little noises into the kiss that made Sherlock want to press into him and draw out more. His breath was hot against Sherlock’s wet lips when he drew back for breath. With each parting, John grew more urgent, sucking Sherlock’s bottom lip and the tip of his tongue, while Sherlock rubbed up and down his inner thighs. When they finally separated for air, Sherlock smiled and reached to undo the button of John’s fly...then stood and backed away.
John turned, half-afraid to, half-afraid not to.
“And what do you want to be?” he asks Sherlock. “When you grow up, I mean.”
He slid a finger in next to his tongue, the slide of it eased by saliva alone. He crooked it just right and felt John’s body jerk in response, heard the catch in his throat and the high-pitched noise that was reflexive and couldn’t be caught. He rubbed and pushed with just one finger, his tongue licking along the edge of John’s hole, his own body burning with the pleasure of John opening up for him, with the sounds of John alternating between soft curses and the building, uncontrollable whimpers singing into his brain.
“One and a half. It’s a school night.”
“What made you get over your phobia?” he asked him instead.
“Spoilsport,” Sherlock pouted.
" John whimpers, and his name sounds like a plea.
“You know, sometimes I’d just leave when he went on one of his rants,” John smiles.
John’s body beneath him, his scars and his marks. The slim muscles of his arms, the soft flatness of his stomach, that sharp intake of breath when Sherlock nuzzles against his navel. Right here the umbilicus formed, a scar of separation from his mother, the severing that began at birth and has continued throughout John’s life.
“Well, of course Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs are fine,” said Bill. “But Slytherin...”
Back at the motel, afterwards, Sherlock has his hands all over John before the door is even fully closed, tugging at his clothes and ordering him to strip, saying that he has to check him for ticks. He’s utterly disappointed with John’s lack of reaction when he pretends to find one at the base of his spine; John laughs, no stranger to walking through fields and forests. But they both yelp when they actually find one in Sherlock’s hair and John howls with laughter at Sherlock messing up his perfect hair with both hands scratching, cursing and yelling fit to beat the band even after he’s removed the goddamn bloodsucker - “Are there any more? Are you
“Sherlock, wait,” John said, breathless, pulling back. He felt dizzy, almost, hot all over. Just like a flick being switched he was suddenly aware of his own nudity; he’d never been naked like this before, even in the gym showers and the boys’ locker room everyone dutifully averted their eyes. And strangely, in the dark, it seemed like he could feel Sherlock’s eyes even more, could see them bright, burning when they looked at him. He felt too exposed, vulnerable, flushed pink all over and wanting and embarrassed by it all. It was too much, too soon.
“It’s all a ruse. I fool people into thinking I can cook by knowing how to make a few things beautifully, and most things not at all,” Victor says, cracking two eggs into a bowl. “Breakfast is a
Sherlock realised, with a dizzying surge of lust, that John was coming again, a smaller orgasm tripping on the heels of the first, at the sensation of being filled with Sherlock’s cum.
and John winced three times. “You’re only in your first year, so it’s all House point deductions and detentions, really. And you don’t think people fight in this school
Sherlock felt an answering tumbling in his stomach that may or may not have had to do with the cabbie’s driving.
Sherlock was so close. Their faces bare inches apart. He was close enough to...to do what, exactly? Something boys oughtn’t do. And yet the feeling in John’s belly was roiling, hot. Summer heaviness in between his legs. John held himself perfectly still, he dared not move, or speak, or even breathe. A tremor of pleasure straight down his spine as Sherlock’s hands clenched tighter on his wrists, just this side of hurt, and Sherlock bent his head, moving in, to...to place his mouth at John’s throat-
Sally snorted with derision.
And what Sherlock said made so much sense. A year ago their doggy had died, and everybody cried and was sad for a while. But then a few months later they’d gotten a new puppy, a bouncy and soft thing that John had named Gladstone, and now they rarely talked about their old doggy anymore.
, it’s a school night and I’ve an early class tomorrow.”
“I’d like to see how cocky you are, Holmes, when you have no teeth to speak of,” Carl said, stepping forward and brandishing his fist.
“When my mom was a little girl,” said Molly, “There was no curfew and everybody could stay out as late as they wanted. But things happened.”
“In analogous response, however,” Sherlock says, voice pitched low and rough with desire, "I bet the sensations travel straight to your dick. When I touch and squeeze them, do you feel your body clench? Do you feel your balls tighten? You've gotten so hard for me that it almost hurts, doesn't it?"
“Did we upset you?” Mike said quickly, and then hit Bill on the arm. “I told you not to upset him!”
The air smells like frying bacon.
John was soundly scolded for not wiping his feet when he came in from play, and reminded that he must always bathe before bedtime. She changed the sheets. She dusted and she swept, and hoovered corner to corner, listening to the satisfying sound of tiny grains rattling about in a plastic tube.
“Okay, Sh’rlock,” John said, blinking up at him agreeably. He was smiling as if Sherlock were something of a marvel, that look that he got sometimes when Sherlock had done something particularly clever, only he hadn’t at all. He had only said that they should go home. It felt a bit unfair to take credit.
“And you don’t think Mummy would rather you get a proper education?”
“There’s nothing wrong with Sherlock,” his mother had insisted, which Sherlock all of thirteen had known meant there was something very wrong indeed.
“Shut up.”
He looked anxiously at Sherlock, as if expecting mockery. Sherlock simply nodded in agreement, and decided not to tell John about the monster that he’d kept in his closet for the better part of three years.
He did not understand. He could not understand, and although the shaking eventually stopped, the feeling of wretchedness stayed with him, still, for quite a time afterwards.
Every time he was on screen, there was a thumping in John’s heart he had never been aware of before. His skin was prickling all over while he sat there in the dark. When Jim Stark raced Buzz Gunderson to the edge of Millerton Bluff in a chickie run, John’s stomach flipped as if he were the one about to go over the cliff instead.
Maybe. Getting close. But it was hard to tell if the surprise was subtle enough, or whether he looked like he’d just gotten shocked from an electrical socket.
Harriet was playing with that little neighbour girl… Lara or Laura or Cara or something. Hazel had left her with specific instructions to look after John, and at the moment it seemed that the three of them were involved in a splash fight.
But the road was dark and unknown, and the car leapt forward when Sherlock pushed his foot down on the accelerator. John looked out the window and he could see: something moving in the woods, something pale and strange and blurred…
The children were delighted by the cows, and, later on, the chickens and sheep that they passed. Tom sang along to the radio, only slightly off-key, but with all the wrong words (
“All right,” John said. He looked out to the sea. He watched the waves rise and fall, the ocean pushing steadily towards the shore, encroaching upon the land.
John let out the breath he’d been holding when pale fingers alighted upon the screen. He’d forgotten it was there, that wire mesh barrier between them.
“Do you think people are acting strangely towards me today?” John asked them in Charms class, as they were practising the Summoning Charm.
“And listen,” said Harry, “I know people are spewing a lot of rubbish about you lately. They’re absolute nitwits. Oh, believe me, normally I’d kill you for losing all those House points. But Carl Powers is such a bloody awful git that I think it’s worth 300 House points to see him get punched in the face. So stop worrying your stupid little blond head about those morons, all right? They’ll find something new to talk about next week.”
“Yes, you have to stay overnight for observation,” Sherlock reminded him. And then, a sudden flare of panic that perhaps John really did have amnesia - “Remember?”
“I wasn’t waiting,” Sherlock snapped, but his hands on John were quick, impatient, and his kisses immediately greedy, as he undressed him with the rushed urgency of someone who has already wasted too much time.
It was a terrible expression on him because it made Sherlock’s insides feel all pressed together like that, all tight and unhappy.
He kisses John on the neck, sucks hard to leave a bright red mark that will purple into the shape of his mouth.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Of course I do.” There were two available exits with easy access, currently, just in case this was a trap.
Even so, John had the distinct feeling he’d promised something he shouldn’t have, and bit his lip, as unease squirmed about in his gut.
“And they say that he makes you do gross and nasty things,” Mike chimed in.
What could that possibly mean?
John looked over and through the open curtains he could see someone. A figure, dressed all in black, a shadow, shaped like a person, but it could be anyone, anything, and the yell welling up in his throat-
“One day,” John says, warm and content, curled up on top of Sherlock. “One day.”
“Did,” Sherlock corrects.
“You don’t really need to do anything,” said Sherlock. “I’ve got it all handled. You can just sit there and take notes.”
Saliva filled his mouth, fog filled his mind. And in his body, a pulsating heat, an insistent throb. Spurt of fluid from the tip of him. He was covered with a sheen of sweat and terrified, trembling, stretched open, writhing, lost. No way to run away from the sensation, could only sob and give in to the bright white flashes.
John’s own body making a mockery of his protests.
The wall was good. The wall was fine. John could have stayed there happily kissing Sherlock until neither of them could hold themselves up anymore. Sherlock seemed to have another idea. His hands bit hard into John’s thighs and then gravity up-ended for a heartbeat as they spun and tumbled into the sofa. John was still gaping up at the smiley face, trying to reassure himself that up and down still worked, when Sherlock managed to scramble up to his knees to attack John’s clothes. The jumper went up and then stuck there; John clawed at it while his jeans got pulled down, with rough bone-jarring yanks like he was some kind of prey animal Sherlock was trying to shake into submission.
"’Go away’... Haha, very humorous, John."
Sherlock lowered his gun.
It was only a party, John considered saying for one ridiculous, panicked moment. They’d only been having a wand party, as you do, when a group of chums were thusly gathered together.
John had only gotten detention once and it was for too many missed classes and it hadn’t happened again since Sherlock graduated. He was rightfully worried for Jeanette. “But what about your permanent record?”
Mycroft gave him a Look.
“We’re not selling the house and uprooting the whole family because of a few nightmares!”
History of Magic was taught by a
Sherlock teaches John how to kiss in the backseat of his 1952 souped up hot rod, white leather interior and royal purple exterior. They park at the passion pit and Sherlock shows him how their mouths fit together, teases out the soft slickness of John’s tongue, while Scarlett O’Hara, resplendent in her dress, runs around a razed plantation projected silver in the background.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ghosts cannot be alive, by definition,” Sherlock informed him. “But yes, Professor Binns is sadly very real, torturously boring,
“Right,” John said, understanding - because slugs appeared to be made of mostly slime and not much brain at all - but nonetheless, a little disappointed.
Sherlock practices the words, silent, but repetitive: I’m a fake. Or: It was all a trick. Or: I don’t have friends.
Okay, maybe it was not so much like bubble wrap at all.
"The true name of this sacred place has been lost to the annals of time," Sherlock  deadpans, to hear John giggle.
” John said. And then, with an undeniable feeling of pride, he told them, “
Caught off-guard again, John tipped forward over Sherlock, catching himself on one hand with the front of his jeans firmly in touch with the groin of Sherlock’s expensive trousers. He glanced down to where they came together.
“My head hurts,” Sherlock moaned in his most pitiful voice. “I’m beginning to feel nauseous.”
John guides the kisses then, while Sherlock works on keeping his hips still, buried to the hilt inside of perfect tight heat and his dick throbbing with frustrated desire.
He smiled, also, because that meant that there was a lot that he knew about that Sherlock didn’t. “Well, I don’t know too much about how they work, but they use them to power small machines, like torches and toys and ‘lectric razors and stuff like that. They come in different sizes and provide energy, and they eventually run out. There’s a negative side and a positive side and when they get old they might leak or explode and the acid inside will burn you so you mustn’t play with old batteries.”
“Oh...Bloody hell. What
John had no leverage like this. He felt like he’d just been swaddled, or maybe scooped up in a net. He grabbed for the back of the sofa, intending to pull himself out of his awkward position, but Sherlock casually batted his hand away. Though he pulled at his trousers a bit more, the big git made no attempt to remove them. John kicked his legs in protest, but he might as well have been hobbled; his rucked-up jeans all but bound him at the knees.
you call a slug?” John asked, fascinated by the very thought that there was a proper way to go about such things, and curious as to whether this was common knowledge amongst all Wizarding children, or something just Sherlock knew.
And Sherlock pressed close, then - and then, pressed closer still. His hand found John’s, open and already waiting. Their fingers folded together, each hand one half of a prayer.
Sherlock stepped back entirely, leaving John with his shirt open and the night air cooling the wet spots on his skin. “All right, go on then. Strip for me, wild thing.”
He reached out, with both hands. Heart pounding. A surge of feeling, a sense of inevitability. Something dark and yearning had been awakened inside of him; ever since that first meeting, that strange night, the sleek car with its yellow headlights.  His fate sealed with the closing of a car door.
John couldn’t catch his breath. He couldn’t look away from Sherlock, wound up too tight to move in whatever Sherlock had done with his voice, the images he’d conjured. If he moved...it felt like he might unleash something he didn’t know how to handle.
John makes tea. They eat in companionable silence on the non-experiment side of the kitchen table.
“Why?”
He knew the song she was humming; she’d been listening to it just the other night. The words floated easily to the front of his mind:
you, anyway? Let me guess. Did little Sarah finally get the courage to ask you over to study?”
"Sherlock," John says, tugging at his arm, his shoulder, trying to turn him towards him. "I...I promise."
And John, he stops struggling.
He didn’t even notice Sherlock taking a photo.
Bill rolled his eyes. "Not less beans, Mike,
“I just worry a lot about you, okay?” Bill said, dutifully contrite.
“Goodnight, Bill,” said John.
John’s erection twitches in response, leaking precum down the length of it. The receptors in his brain are flooding with adrenaline, stupidly unable to distinguish between pleasure and danger. Each one enhances the other. He arches back, a ragged whimper spilling from between softly parted lips, flushed and swollen from harsh kisses. The light cotton of Sherlock’s shirt slides against his bare skin as Sherlock fucks him, a smooth sort of friction along his spine. The frission of feeling along his spine, every thrust slick and right. Sherlock’s shirt is already damp with sweat, combination of Sherlock’s and his own, the two of them melding together. The pressure on his throat is heady and ever increasing, and each breath becomes harder and harder to take.
The radiator was hissing while Father Pike spoke, soft and serpentine at first, and then louder and louder, like a kettle whistling as water came to a boil. There was something moving down Jesus’ foot. A crawling black fly, perhaps. John couldn’t help but look at it. No, it was a trickle. A trickle of something...something red? It looked like…
“Promise,” John says.
Behind the wheel sat a young man -
Hazel could not sleep over the noise of the wind and the waves. The wind was howling outside the house, as if it were goading itself into a fury; the ocean an endless roar, so loud and so close it was like a whisper in her ear.
John is silent. Sherlock says, “She means nothing.”
John followed him, his little pail in hand, rattling gently with the shovel and the shells and stones he’d collected earlier that day. Sherlock stopped near the entrance of the cave, where the sunlight still spilled in, and laid back on the warm sand and shallow water, sunning himself.
John held out his hand so that Bill could place a tarnished small gold amulet into it. It was covered with sigils. In the middle of it there was an intricate eye, and embedded inside the pupil there was a deep red stone, that might have possibly been a ruby, although the stone was chipped.
“What do you want, John?” Victor asks him. There’s no judgment in his tone. It would be so much easier if there were.
“And,” Sherlock added, “The only one I want to see.”
It’s too much to process, all at once. The world is spinning around them. He pushes Sherlock off of him, energy uncoiled.
“It’s S.W.A.G.,” Bill replied. “Of course!”
And the types of discussion that followed perhaps didn’t require any complicated concepts, but John always felt illuminated, all the same.
“Look, you don’t have to do this ,” Victor says. His lips part slightly when he looks down at John. His hair is still a mess, spiking up funny in different directions. He looks oddly young in the morning light.
In the school gymnasium, at this very moment, John will be dancing with some girl named Clara. He will be sliding his hand to her waist, holding her in the way that the crooners sing about, the way that most red-blooded teenage girls dream of being held.
, right in the center of his body, rubbing against him just slightly whenever Sherlock moved, that electric jolt of pleasure that sang through his body like a note through a string, thought of kissing Sherlock, rubbed his thumb over the sensitive head of his own cock and felt the wetness of his own excitement, thought of kissing James Dean, shivered hard, stroked himself with a fresh spurt of his own wetness, and tumbled over the edge, belly swooping, and in that moment he was flying,  in sharp, hot pulses of white all over his own hand, getting a little on his stomach.
Professor Hudson’s office was spacious and bright and nothing at all like a Doomy Dungeon where a young Watson’s dreams might go to die. It smelled like what John imagined Heaven might possibly smell like, like a giant bakery where a dozen bakers baked a hundred of one’s favourite pies, all warmth and cinnamony sugary spice. Red and gold tapestry covered the walls, same as in the Gryffindor Common Room. Vases of royal purple flowers (the same hue as Professor Hudson’s robes) sprouted randomly from various surfaces as if the seeds had alighted upon desks and cabinets and bookshelves and decided to take root and flourish there. The room was filled with squashy floral print sofas, all of them covered with assorted doilies, and one sofa was covered with an orange tabby cat stretched over a lace doily, napping in the sunlight.

That feeling that had been brewing, churning inside of him since the start - it was longing. He’d never given it a name until now; he hadn’t known what to name it. He knew he should not have felt such things, yet he could not help himself feeling them.  He could not help the thrill that shivered through him, nor the echo of pleasure in its wake.

“The room was empty when we came in, Bill,” said Mike.
“Right. Let’s just wash it off, then!” Harry said, and she shook her head. Her words were a bit too loud, and they came out a bit too fast. “This might sting a little.” She splashed seawater over John’s arm, scrubbing at the blood. John tensed - would she see the bite that Sherlock had left on him? And would she believe him, if he said that he had only gotten bitten by a very small shark?
Instead of speaking, John’s own hands go to the collar of his shirt. His bowtie is already undone, his suit jacket in a soft heap on the floor, the pink carnation in the buttonhole crushed.
Sherlock would be kicked out of home. And what university would take John, if they knew? How could he ever become a doctor? No one wanted to be touched by a
boring!” Bill said afterwards, as they walked back towards Gryffindor Tower after class.
Coming back to 221B is like that: a waiting embrace, the comfort of home. Similarly, it is also like a punch in the gut, a hand the grips his intestines, twists them around a fist and squeezes.
Those August nights were like dark velvet on the skin; summer smell of sweet grass in the air.  It was late enough that the heat was just starting to lift, night breeze blowing like God’s green breath cooling off the earth.
It was, of course, at that moment that Sherlock’s mobile went off.
“Then
"That’s not drinking!" John said, scoffing.
There were a lot of things that Sherlock understood about people: statistically speaking, the vast majority of them were idiots. Mummy had done her best to shelter him from this hard fact of life, but the early attempts made at socialisation let all the idiocy leak through, and he had been well informed of this upsetting state of affairs by the seasoned age of five. They were also deleteriously dull, and predictable. Even Mycroft could be predicted if you knew right (most, obviously, didn’t).
“I’m just saying, you have an escape if you want to take it,” Victor says. “I won’t hold it against you.”
“My apologies,” Sherlock said, and climbed up on the bed. The mattress dipped underneath his weight as he straddled John’s torso. “It

“All right!” said John, who was perfectly fine not being helpful if his help was so very unwanted. He got up off his knees. “Fine. You’re fine, I’m fine!”
“Why are you both wearing moustaches?” John asked.
“One day,” Sherlock declared grandly, “he will be the most dangerous man you’ve ever met.” He was sure of it. “For now, though, he’s only annoying. Not our problem right now. Over there, the slugs.”
important skill to have. Hang-overs, morning afters, cures what ails you.”
“It’s all right, John,” Mike said, and patted his shoulder to comfort him. “Manly women are to be admired.”
. Do try to keep up.” He calmly took a sip of his tea while Carl spluttered, wildly pointing at Sherlock as if to say,
A look down the now-very long table revealed something John had somehow managed to miss from afar - sitting in one of the armchairs, was Mrs. Hudson asleep at the table, with her place set for tea.
But when he got down the hall, the shower was already running, the bathroom door locked, and Harry’s voice clearly heard singing, “
he said, and tried what he thought might be a smooth smile. Oh, no. That just looked sleazy. He was creeping himself out with that one - not to mention the bakery owner who, upon spying him through the glass, gave him an extremely odd look.
Thoroughly distracted, he didn’t notice Sherlock’s other hand coming around his side to grab the honey-coated spoon and bring it around--not until Sherlock began to drizzle a line of honey over the bare curve of his shoulder.  He raised his hand to catch at Sherlock’s wrist, and then it slipped away again as Sherlock lowered his head to lap away the trail he’d just made.
“And you?” John asked. “Mr. This-is-all-transport is a gay sex expert?” He grinned down at Sherlock, making no attempt to hide his disbelief.
Every Sunday, the talk of hellfire and to beware the Devil; terrors that seemed so real when he was sat in the hardness of the wooden pew, but ridiculous now as Sherlock scoffed.
“You always walk slower to your first class, when normally, you practically run to everything. This past Tuesday you yawned five times during the lecture portion of Potions. It’s
and the chalk tapping away on the chalkboard and all the figures of lines and his teacher’s droning voice John felt the heat between his legs and the itch at the base of his spine, the sudden fullness and aching. It was impossible to think. He was aware of the subtle friction of his trousers - how, when his fingers clenched on his thigh, it dragged, just barely- over him. As if hypnotized by the sensation, he could not stop doing it, struggling only to control his breathing.
On reflex, Sherlock opened his mouth and was stunned at the taste of cool metal on his tongue.
“Hey, “he said, as he stood next to Greg.
“John?”
Feeling utterly restless and somehow not as in tune with himself as he was prone to when he went here, he surged forward, leaving behind a seemingly endless flight of stairs and corridors until he had reached the lowest levels of his palace.
"My name is John. John Watson." John lowers his hand down to his side. "I'm a doctor."
John grinned and Sherlock returned the mischievous look, watching John lean over, open the bedside drawer, and grab a small bottle of lubricant that was half used. The doctor sat up and gestured for Sherlock to roll over, popping the cap open on the lubricant and sitting back on his heels. Sherlock recognized what John was asking as part of the process for what the educational videos called 'preparation' and he readily complied, flipping over onto his knees and forearms. John watched him between glances at his fingers as he poured the lubricant onto his hand, finding it incredibly difficult to take his eyes off of his partner.
As if remembering a question he meant to ask, John blurted, "Oh, how did you know he escaped from the basement?"
When Rosie looked over and saw John and Sherlock on the couch, she beamed. "Dadda!" John smiled warmly as she ran over, wobbling on uncoordinated feet. He reached out and picked her up when she got near, and she dropped her bear in favor of reaching out to grasp at John's jumper.
"Who is he?"
"Do you know him?"
"You pay my crew and I for services rendered and never breathe a word of us, including anything from the layout of the ship to the names of the crewmen, to another soul. If you agree to these terms, we will feed you and keep you unharmed until we reach the harbor of London, in which you will be escorted to your residence by either myself or Peter to collect our payment. If you don't agree, well... It doesn't take a
"If you want me to stop, just say so." John murmured, glancing up Sherlock's body at the man's face. The taller man had his eyes closed and his lips parted, a look that John recognized but had never seen on Sherlock. Sherlock shakily hummed an affirmative, hand still buried in John's hair. "'s alright if trousers come off?"
"I don't know a few of them well," she continued, starting to stand up, "but I can tell you who it couldn't have been. I was with them last night." Isabelle walked over to the reception desk, grabbed a notepad, and begun to write. John slowly stood and walked over to join her while Sherlock surveyed the waiting room. It was clean and oddly homely. Light dust covered the magazines left sitting on an end table next to Sherlock's chair. If Isabelle was being truthful about how defensive and paranoid Oliver could be during an episode, then he certainly didn't go through this room on his way out. Nothing seemed disturbed or out of place.
Just then, someone barged into the tavern. The door hit the wall with a loud thud, and save from a bit of rustling, John pretended to still be a drunkard sleeping. Well, perhaps just sleeping, considering the ale he's drank tonight.
Oliver looked down at the wooden table and thought hard, his eyebrows furrowing. "I remember an alley and a street..."
Rosie looked down in her crib as John stood there, clad in pajama bottoms and an undershirt. She was eyeing her favorite blanket, a bright pink plush one with a teddy bear patch sewn into one of the corners that Mrs. Hudson bought when they moved back into Baker Street. John bent down with a soft grunt and picked it up, hoisting Rosie up and over the crib railing in the process. He set her down on her feet, saying, "Go to the potty and you'll get your blanket, okay?"
John thought, but he kept his thoughts to himself. This wasn't the place or the time to share them, and John was already tired of sharing.
"Are you going to arrest us?" Peter instantaneously asked, wide-eyed.
"I'd like to check your sources for that medical knowledge, Doctor Watson."
"It's okay," John reassured, holding out a hand to signal him to stop as John tentatively closed the door behind himself. "You can stay there. I won't come any closer."
"I'm still alive, am I not?" Sherlock countered softly, trying to lean and catch a glimpse of John's face but grimacing with pain.
"Does this mean we're...?"
"John...?"
Rosie walked through the door opening and beamed at Sherlock, arms raised as she waddled towards him in her purple underwear, pajama bottoms discarded on the bathroom floor. John saw something rare of the old Sherlock, but far more common of the new Sherlock he had come to know over the past few months - this Sherlock smiled, warm and inviting. Realizing the change in Sherlock earlier likely caused the flare up of warmth and peace in John's chest at seeing the product of Sherlock's change in the flesh.
"I know what I want," John licked his dry lips, "but I've got no idea what
"You mean that?"
"You'd like me to decipher the message." Sherlock interrupted, unfolding the paper John handed to him. "Do you still have-"
"You told me earlier that someone took it from you." John supplied, hoping that would spark some sort of recognition. Oliver thought hard about it, trying to remember.
"Oh fuck off." John huffed without venom in his voice, suppressing a smirk that Sherlock still managed to see. Sherlock's joking tone calmed them both, at least before John had to struggle to get Sherlock up the stairs. It took some cursing, shouting, and heavy lifting, but eventually they made it to the top.
He nearly forgot the intimacy of the moment until he felt John's erection pushing further into him.
John shouted at the men, making sure they wouldn't mistake Peter for their personal messenger again, then sent them off to scout the island and return back if they found something relating to a well. John stood above deck for half an hour, watching his men search before they disappeared behind the island's landscape. He was about to head downstairs when he saw one of his men waving his arms about on the shore, holding a bottle in his hand.
. You care, and that's what saved me. Not the doctors operating on me, not how quickly you responded after the gunshot. Knowing that you cared, that you needed me, too... I wasn't just unconscious, John, I was in my Mind Palace, micromanaging what I could control to increase my chances of survival. When I was ready to give up and die... Knowing that you needed me, that you were in danger, was what gave me the strength to keep fighting." Sherlock paused for a moment to breathe, staring at John's face as his eyes opened and he looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled softly.
Sherlock broke the silence, causing John to flinch slightly as he was shaken from his contemplation. It took him a moment to realize what Sherlock said and process it, but even then John was confused.
Sherlock smiled warmly, an expression that became even more frequent since they began this odd relationship, and John leaned down to press his lips against the detective's. The kiss was soft and slow, sending shivers through their skin. Sherlock slid a hand over John's clothed bicep, following the muscle up to his shoulder, and John smirked against his lips.
patients, really." She toyed with the bracelet on her left wrist. "But yes, I'd say so. I spend a lot of time leading group activities and discussion sessions. We grow close with how much time we spend together."
Sherlock nodded softly, understanding. "My leaving changed me, I know. For better or for worse, however, I've not yet decided."
"You do love superheroes, yes." John smiled softly. "What about animals?"
Lestrade swallowed and nodded. "We asked him for it, of course, but... he's so out of it that it's like he doesn't register the question." Lestrade sighed. "I called Doctor Watson mostly 'cause, well... The kid's clearly mentally ill, and-"
John and Sherlock continue to investigate the basement when they run into a slight problem.
John furrowed his brows and opened his mouth slightly. "... You were listening."
"I'm not ill, if that's what you're wondering." Sherlock remarked. "The past few months have taught me many things, one of those being that it's best to say what I...
to handle." Isabelle answered after a moment. "From what you described, Doctor Watson, you experienced one of Oliver's episodes at the Yard?" John nodded. "I'm glad you were there for him, but for us this isn't something all too surprising when it comes to Oliver. That's why the orderlies sometimes aren't as..."
incorrectly?" John wondered aloud, remembering the twenty or so reporters standing outside the crime scene tape yesterday. The poor woman's death was deemed a suicide by the media before Sherlock and John had even arrived, and despite John tackling her murderer to the cobblestone street about six hours later, they were still pushing this narrative.
Sherlock complied, shaking slightly from the shock that was slowly setting in. Looking down, he watched John carefully pull the edge of his coat back to look at where the blade lodged itself into the left side of Sherlock's abdomen. He could feel his legs begin to shake. Judging by the length of the average scalpel and the length of the exposed handle-
Following John's impromptu interview with "Oliver", Sherlock and Lestrade join him outside the office to discuss what Oliver said and what to do next.
‘I’m sorry love, you need to sit up drinking this and I’m afraid you’re still too weak to do it on your own. I hope it’s alright if I help you a little bit?”
“Yes! Obviously!”
Slowly and with a heavy sigh, Scott turned around again, rolling his eyes. He fixed John with an annoyed glare. “What?”
Mycroft smiled at him, in his typically condescending manner. “Yes, Dr. Watson, do calm down, please. There’s no need to be dramatic.” As John continued to stare at him furiously, he added, a little softer “My apologies, if I offended you.”
"Hypnagogic," Sherlock responded without missing a beat (the man
Time seemed to still around them. The faceless people moved in slow motion, leaving only them and the sand moving in what constituted as normal pace. John thought it was a silly question for him to ask, but Sherlock seemed startled by his ready answer, thin cracks spiderwebbing across his fine, flat face.
With that final gasp of his name, Sherlock ceased talking, and John reveled in his victory for a few more sweet seconds before pulling back to admire his handiwork.
soft, "You're not in Afghanistan. You're here, with me, in 221B Baker Street. It smells like laundry detergent in here. You did the washing up earlier."
John's fingers tightened around Sherlock to hide the tremble that ran through them.
"Come now John, it'd be an entirely plausible hypothesis for an average person to toy with if it weren't for the fact that you don't
"Always," John replied, and dove back in to do just that.
Whatever the case may be, Sherlock didn't
, John Watson, was attracted to Sherlock
"I won't pour the tea," he said obstinately, slouching down at the table and picking up what sounded like one of his delicate scientific instruments.
"Good, because you heard me and you didn't say anything until now! Very wily of you, dear John."
"I'm quite alright," John replied instantly, keeping his voice as level as possible. It helped to keep his gaze fixed on his feet. "Let's go home before someone starts questioning us again."
Sherlock hardly ever paused. He was either moving or wasn't; either flitting about a corpse like a crow or completely stock still as his brain worked furiously. Something about a "mind palace" was involved in those still moments, which was something John didn't completely understand yet but figured made sense considering the sheer brilliance of the man's mind.
"Sleep matters little to me. I'm not tired at all," Sherlock proclaimed, and he indeed looked quite energetic considering the time of night.
"You're always mindful of those," Sherlock said, sitting cross-legged before reaching to clasp his hands. "Close your eyes for me?"
Sherlock grumbled but turned them around so John was on his back before kissing him with an intensity that he happily returned.
"John?"
, what with the way he carried on. John had never seen such a complete lack of care for the fundamentals of survival, and it set off every alarm medical schooling had instilled in him when he came to the realization that Sherlock only did the bare minimum to keep his body going, and anything beyond that was for "regular people."
John hid his smile as Sherlock came up to stand behind him and drape himself over his shoulders. Typical Sherlock; holding off on breaching some boundaries to test them first and leaping over others with nary a second glance to what he was breaching. But the point was largely moot as between them, there were very few boundaries.
John shivered at the fluttery sensation before raising the arm Sherlock had partly pinned with his own, squirming so he could wrap it around him. He wasn't sure why he'd done it, because if he had any sense, he would've helped him up and apologized profusely, but instead, he was pulling him

"It's a natural reaction. Emotions are messy, interlocked things. Happy and sad don't exist on separate planes, but rather side by side, and so do the physical reactions that go with them. That's why it's so easy to go from one to the other in a heartbeat."

(John suspected that Sherlock tried so hard to look put together because he'd looked anything but in his days as an addict, but he wouldn't say so out loud. He was ultimately a man of tact, and he knew it would only earn him a long stretch of sullen, brooding silence from Sherlock and screeching violin noises that could barely constitute as music.)
"You're dressed," John continued, nodding to the man's attire before he rested his suddenly heavy head on the back of the couch, "You smell like...soap and conditioner, which means you didn't do any experiments, and the kitchen smelled like food, which means you ate too."
A shiver ran down John's spine, his reaction so visceral at the unexpected depth and fierceness in Sherlock's tone that he couldn't help but comply.
"Let's go home," he said softly, suddenly wanting to be away and wrapped up in 221B, pretending life only consisted of him and Sherlock. Wishful, useless thinking, but tonight, John knew he could let himself pretend. Sherlock would sleep, and for tonight he would be John's to keep safe.
was just about the right word for it. Tenderness to contrast the magnetism, easy companionship to temper the flame that burned in him every time he saw Sherlock smirk or toss curls out of his face or stride with purpose through a sea of faded people.
Sherlock's blood was hot and slippery between his fingers, and John never wanted to see so much of it outside his body ever again. Not like this, in some dank warehouse corner, with scarce light and teeming bacteria hot spots and-
John made it a point to never call Sherlock handsome or other such related compliments for a variety of reasons. For one, Sherlock

If anything, he remembered his dream better. The sand, the dust, the sensation of being lost in a crowd, almost swallowed into obscurity before being pulled free into motion by someone trapped in stone.
John sat back against the couch and wondered why, despite the answers he now had, they didn't seem to be enough to satisfy the last question he had in his mind.
He was aware that his more than normal efforts to care for Sherlock's health were starting to be noticed. Sherlock was ever observant, and John didn't hide his efforts much unless he was trying to trick Sherlock into eating or sleeping. His care naturally extended to medical patch-ups thanks to their line of work; sometimes, it was more practical for John to do it instead of going to a hospital, not to mention the fact that he appeared to be the only medical professional Sherlock didn't immediately dislike upon sight for trying to help him. But full trust?
"I'm-I'm not laughing at you," he clarified before Sherlock could get the wrong idea (God forbid Sherlock thought he was laughing at
All thoughts of gods and monsters drifted away as the violin continued on, and the chill John had allowed to keep him awake was gradually replaced by warmth. It felt like he was almost intruding upon something private, listening to Sherlock play such a mournful tune so softly. Like a secret of some sort, one that he didn't understand as he didn't know the language of music but could still appreciate the weight of through every swooping note. Sherlock was speaking, and John was happily listening, even if he couldn't understand.
"I cannot speak like you John," Sherlock bemoaned, eyes squeezed shut as he shook his head. "I am not soft, or gentle with my words. Oh, what a

if Sherlock didn't cease this wild kiss of teeth and tongue.
"I'm alright," he replied slowly, and for the moment at least, he really
"Cheeky, impertinent bastard," Sherlock muttered, but the affection was so clear in his voice that the humor John had used to alleviate the swoop in his stomach was rendered useless.
"John?"
"It can't be helped-
John blinked once more at Sherlock before huffing out a laugh.
The ice of his thoughts melted into something more like cool water, no longer so cutting and needy for attention. John knew (despite some of his darker thoughts at times) that he wasn't a monster, and therefore neither was Sherlock.
, and I am I."
A tad sulky, but John heard him set down the knick-knack he'd been toying with in favor of clearing a little more space for their breakfast, even though John was satisfied with the amount he'd cleared already.
He was still getting to know Sherlock and the helter-skelter life he'd suddenly found himself in, but that didn't matter to John. He was a doctor for God's sake, and while the war may have given him some rough edges, he still held an unwieldy amount of compassion and care.
. He meant to berate him more for doing so until Sherlock's hand dropped into his hair, gripping just tight enough to get his attention.
"You remembered that?"
-fancy him back (he wasn't even sure how to define the feelings he held towards Sherlock besides a strong, potent magnetism laced with affection that could be perfectly platonic) and he had never been eloquent. The words would get butchered on the way out, so it was for the best that he kept silent.
"Do you know when I knew, definitively, that my feelings were reciprocated?"
However, he wasn't tired enough to
"Right. I'll just…oh, forget it," John said, shaking his head in half-frustration and half fondness as Sherlock buzzed like a bee over his findings, "A storm…honestly."
John was going to explode, or maybe implode; so much
"Why that specific word?" John asked, enjoying the mild shiver his lips against Sherlock's skin drew.
John shifted uneasily in his bed. Besides the insult of Sherlock's words, there had been something
"I…care about you, very much John. I think I have in some measure before I realized your attempts at bettering and preserving my health came from love deeper than that of friendship. Forgive me for being slow on the uptake."
But it was no use, lingering in bed even longer. Mike was right. They shouldn’t be late for class. If the rumors about Professor Magnussen were true, the man was a real arsehole and he didn’t want to be ostracized by him from the very start. ‘Advanced Toxicology’ was one of the most important classes this semester, he couldn’t afford to fail this course or his whole plan of getting his medical degree in the optimal timeframe of six years would be in jeopardy.
“No, dear brother mine, “Mycroft replied softly. “You stop being such an insufferable fool and start listening for a change. You have been assaulted twice in a matter of days. You need to heal. You need to let people take care of you.”
he had said.
Sherlock made a strangled noise in his throat as he buried his face further into his arm. “I...we kissed...and I stopped it. I stopped our first real kiss.”
It had felt as everything had been completely straightforward between them. There were no unmentioned mysteries, no clarifications concerning their relationship needed. They were there, together, happy. That was everything they needed.
“Alright then, “she said, flustered. She quickly put the second tray on John’s nightstand and fled the room.
After looking at them for a long moment, Mycroft didn’t even try to hide his smug smile. “We didn’t mean to interrupt any….intimate conversations or whatever you two have been up to.” With this, Mycroft’s eyebrows arched inquiringly at Sherlock, to which his brother only huffed and looked away.
John had pity on his friend and changed the subject to the beautiful scenery of Devon, its moor and its people, which Mrs. Hudson seemed moderately interested in. Sherlock made a remark here and there and so they chattered away for a good twenty minutes.
He waited for an answer from Sherlock, his eyes expectedly flitting over Sherlock’s face. When Sherlock just stood there, staring at him helplessly and unable to reply, he eventually shrugged and said “Okay.”
“Come on, master detective. Let’s get home and tell Mrs. Hudson the good news. We can celebrate with some tea and biscuits.”
Sherlock was nervous. John could see it from the way his eyes kept flitting upwards to him, then quickly back down to the ground, as if he was trying to avoid looking directly at him. As if he was afraid that John would see something in his face that he wasn’t supposed to see. The fact that he was pacing their living room, picking up random pieces of things his fumbling hands found - a book, a forgotten teacup - looking at them without really seeing them, was a good indicator of Sherlock’s inner anxiety.
He groaned in frustration because the answer was that he just didn’t know. He wanted to scream at someone.
“Oh, nothing, everything’s fine here, Officer Lestrade.”
That’s when the doorbell rang again.
After his second  - no third - unsuccessful encounter with Scott, John sulked for the rest of the day and locked himself inside his room when he returned, just like last time. Mike tried to talk to him through the door, but John declared that he didn’t want to discuss what had happened. If Scott thought he needed to behave like a total nutter, let him. He had really tried to make up for his mistake and he had genuinely wanted to protect the younger Beta when he had been threatened - no, sexually harassed - by those idiot Alphas.
“Yes, I know that! But they don’t so we’ll have to persuade them that’s how it was.”
“No!” Sharp nails dove into his back, stopping John’s movement mid-way. “No, p-please, I-I don’t need any s-stupid blankets, I just need you ….” And Sherlock emphasized his words by burying himself further against John’s chest, a sob leaving his throat as his body continued to shiver violently.
“Ha. Agreed.” John winked at him and Sherlock could feel sudden heat rise to his cheeks. He quickly buried his face in his pillow, hoping that John had not seen it.
Why would such a simple thing between them make his body want this? Why was he suddenly feeling weak with need and lust, just because John had held him close and looked at him as if he was the most precious thing in the world?
He closed his eyes and tried to make that funny queasy feeling in his stomach go away. What was wrong with him?
“I’m sorry, sir, I’d like to collect the blood sample now, if I may.”
Something concerning John.
“You see?” he repeated for the umpteenth time, it seemed, “it was obvious she was going to kill Sherlock right then and there, so it was completely justified that I shot her.”
He pulled and a pang of disappointment swept over him as he realized that the door was locked. He kept pulling and pushing at the handle like a madman as if it would make it open magically but nothing happened. He kept on pulling while the walls around him kept rumbling and the grey kept closing in on him. He didn’t care, he needed to know what was behind this door, even to the cost of his own sanity.
So he did.
Her tongue pushed between his lips and started licking into his mouth. Sheer agony made him flinch hard and he tried to push his head back, but her grip was strong, and she wasn’t letting him go. But he couldn’t go on, he couldn’t bear this, his mouth being invaded like this, he just couldn’t.
They entered the building and worked their way forward. Luckily, John had a torch with him which made it much easier to move without difficulty. They took the staircase up and found the first floor dark and abandoned. They split up, Greg staying on the first floor, John taking the second. When they found nothing and nobody there, they looked on the third floor but there was nothing there either. Everything was quiet, there were no signs of forced entry and no signs of a struggle. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
“No, no, Sherlock, “John said at once, and he squeezed his hand in reassurance, “it’s just the ambulance. It’s okay.”
“Maybe you thought this was the best way to ensure your way into my bed? That I would fall for you, the white knight in shining armour, having rescued me from the big bad Alphas? That’s your thing, isn’t it? You’ve got some sort of twisted hero complex, getting off on it no doubt.”
“John. Did you listen to me at all?” Sherlock snapped his fingers in front of John’s face, startling John out of his thoughts.
He tried to sidestep the taller man but the Alpha pushed a hand against his chest, keeping him where he stood against the wall.
He had quickly realized that John had not really meant what he had said, it had been obvious in the way he had called after him when he had left the hospital room. Obvious in the desperate tone when he had called him from the police station. Sherlock had not completely understood why John had yelled at him like that at Barts but it seemed it had something to do with sentiments again. Not his area of course.
“Yes, “Mycroft chimed in, “that is right, brother mine, so be grateful that Doctor Watson has wisely chosen to inform me, or I would have found out another way and things might have ended less fortunate.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows in an obvious challenge and Mycroft just smirked condescendingly, knowing his brother all too well.
Okay, where did these thoughts come from? John was so shocked, he jolted upwards into a sitting position, breathing hard. His heart was beating in his chest like crazy.
“Oh John, hi, “Greg said, smiling. “What’s up with your date? Has she already rejected you?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry for locking you in the laboratory and making you believe you were haunted by a ghost hound. It was not nice and I’m sorry I made you go through that.” He let out a little shaky breath and looked at John expectantly. When John stared at him speechlessly Sherlock continued ranting.
John nodded apologetically. “Yes, he’ll be here any second now.”
"Can’t you go any faster?”
The call ended and John felt strangely comforted. Here was a man he didn’t like very much. A cold, distanced man who never talked about anything emotional, only about business. And yet, he felt as if they had just made a connection, simply by caring deeply for the same man. A man that was hard to look after and that was difficult to keep close and because this man was so unique and the relationships both of them had with him respectively were also very unique, they were somehow bonded to each other. It was strange because John and Mycroft would never ever have something to do with each other- were it not for one Sherlock Holmes.
John blinked. Yes, of course, he should examine Sherlock, take a look at his injuries. The need to comfort his friend had been greater than the need to be a doctor.
John pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. “No. We were watching telly together and he tricked me into thinking he was just going downstairs to fetch something from Mrs. Hudson.”
Magnussen slowly turned away from Scott, focussing his cold eyes on John instead. “You?” he asked skeptically.
He felt himself be pulled up and he couldn’t help at all cause his body was feeling really odd now - as if there were no muscles in it. He also simply had too little strength to manage on his own.
“I admit that’s a reason, “John conceded sincerely. “But as I said, I was also very impressed by how you dealt with Magnussen. You’re incredibly clever. That’s hot.”
John and he couldn’t go on like before. He couldn’t because there was something between them, something he was sure would get them both in trouble and he had to know what it was to prevent something terrible from happening.
No use pleading or praying
He felt the attacker tug at the buttons of his trousers and more silent tears slid down his cheeks as he felt them being pulled down.
“I can’t wait anymore, John! I have to get out of here!” Sherlock’s chest was heaving in anxiety, his voice sounding desperate and John raised his hands in an attempt to calm him down as he tried to make eye contact.
“Sit down, Sherlock, come on.” Mycroft’s voice sounded nervous and concerned.
? More often than not John found himself seething with barely controlled anger, his fists curled into fists at his side, excusing himself for a walk outside because if he didn’t he was afraid he’d just pounce on his mad-as-a-hatter flatmate and bash his head in sooner than later.
He ignored everything around them and just concentrated on holding his friend. Hoping that his presence, his body warmth would provide Sherlock with some much-needed comfort. It seemed to help a least a little because Sherlock’s breathing calmed down considerably, and his crying turned from desperate sobs to quiet intermittent hitches in his breathing.
