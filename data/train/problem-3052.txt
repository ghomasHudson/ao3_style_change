“That’s not very fair of you, Castiel. You now know that this wasn’t his choice, but your brother’s.”
He can’t help but release what suspiciously sounds like a whimper against his mouth while Cas’ hand travels through his hair, cups the back of his neck and brings him impossibly closer. He has to reign himself in to try and stay conscious as Castiel’s tongue sweeps through his lower lip and finds his.
I’m tempted to pretend that I’ve been trying to get you out of me all this time. But the truth is that’s not what I’ve been doing at all. I’m terrified of letting you go. I’m no longer sure who I am without the pain to define me. You’re not the only thing inside me that hurts, but I guess it’s true to say you still find your way under my skin like you did when I left.
He remembers the offer, how Cas was so scared of him leaving. He remembers choosing Cas one last time, being able to finally make a choice he wasn’t allowed to make 11 years before.
already — resting against his bare skin, and Dean tightens against Castiel’s back, even letting his eyes fall shut again as he instantly relaxes against him.
He waits a while before speaking, cutting through the comfortable silence between them, “you’re gonna catch a cold, babe.”
Suddenly it’s like the strings that have been keeping them out of each other’s space for months have been finally cut. Dean’s arms go around Cas’ waist in one smooth motion while Castiel’s legs wrap around him and bring him impossibly closer. Suddenly all Cas can feel is Dean, Dean,
Cas chugs his drink instead, before turning back to look at Balthazar who’s waiting patiently for his friend to finish having his mini existential crisis.
“Of course I came back,” Dean answers as his other hand travels along the curve of Cas’ ribs. “What, did you think I would leave and pass the opportunity to inflict my cooking on you for the foreseeable future?”
“You drove all day without even checking if I’d be here and not the other side of the world on an op? Jesus Christ, Winchester, sometimes I forget how dumb you are,” Benny scoffs, finally taking a sip of his beer as his eyes grow fond.
Cas dips his finger into Dean’s mouth tentatively, his heartbeat slightly accelerating as Dean’s tongue plays with it, their eyes never wavering from one another.
“It’s Chief Petty Officer for you, honey,” Dean huffs against Cas’ damp skin as he maps out the line of his throat.
“I’m glad we made it,” Sam murmurs after a while, watching as Eileen picks up Delilah and both of them start making their way to them, Cas in their trail. “I’m glad we carried on, if this is the outcome we get.”
Ten years might have passed since they defeated Chuck, and sure they might have gotten older, hair might have turned grayer, but Cas is looking just as fine as he did 10 years ago (which means he looks like
Thunder rolls and I hear the collapse of cities. The ground vibrates and I feel an earthquake. I might be dead tomorrow, and that’s alright. I’ve always had a tendency to fear the worst. To worry about things too awful to speak out loud. Now that I’ve lived through wars and battlefields, what I fear is not being able to see your eyes again. To die without ever hearing the sound of your laugh, or the press of your lips.
Hates the way the panic still rises inside his throat as he tries to gather his thoughts, his gaze still stuck on the orange bottles in front of him.
Bobby’s wife Ellen manages to be there for Christmas Eve for the first time in the history of Christmas Eve, the hospital granting her the free weekend. Even Jo gets home from New York to spend both days with her mom and adoptive Dad, giving Dean a chance to reconnect with someone he once upon a time considered his little sister. It takes an hour for Jo to warm up to him again, but once it’s done she makes both Dean and Cas swear that they aren’t going to run away again. Dean feels his heart constrict at the obvious hurt he’s caused everyone ten years back, and crushes Jo into a hug, watching Cas over her shoulder. The other man smiles and squeezes Dean’s hand tighter, before they all proceed to drink and eat their weight in Christmas food.
I’m right!” Jimmy argues. “You were right there with me telling Dean to apply for colleges back then, you know damn well he would’ve stayed here just because Cas was so unstable he couldn’t fathom leaving Lawrence!”
I have grown comfortable with the idea of being alone, because it seems somehow less frightening than letting another person make a home in my chest. I don’t think my heart can take another absence, and I don’t think I can survive another shot at love. I know it’s only barely been two months, but the way my heart still lurches when I think of you, I know I won’t let myself go through this ever again.
“Missed you,” Dean gasps into his mouth, hips rutting against his, one hand holding onto Cas’ hipbone where there will no doubt be a bruise tomorrow, a reminder of this moment for Cas to cherish. “So bad, babe,
“I’m serious. I was halfway into a crisis and you managed to calm me down and bring me back to Earth.”
“Feeling like I’m getting too old for this shit,” Dean says slowly, enjoying the warmth of Cas’ fingers over his skin, the softness of a thumb following the curve of his lower lip.
Dean chokes up, his forehand banging lightly against the wooden desk when he lets his head fall down, unable to do anything but break down. There are too many feelings running inside him, too many emotions for his brain to be able to compute, and somehow Dean thinks it’s fitting, really.
There are tear tracks on Dean’s cheek and his bottom lip wobbles lightly. Cas’ thumb follows the line of his cheekbone tenderly, letting his fingers graze the sharp cut of his jaw and Dean closes his eyes at the soft touch, exhaling a deep breath. Fresh tears spill from his closed eyes and Cas carefully wipes them up with his thumbs, before leaning close and placing a kiss on his cheek tenderly. Dean doesn’t make a sound, and after a while he lets Cas draw him into his arms and back into bed, and buries his head into Castiel’s chest, still not uttering a word. Cas carefully keeps him close, almost cradling his body against him.
The Novaks’ apartment stands beside the Kansas river and in a quiet part of town (although Lawrence is undoubtedly a quiet city, Dean realizes quickly enough after a decade spent in Virginia). Cas and Jimmy started living here when they were 16, after they got booted from their last foster home (Jimmy
He looks adorable, bleary eyes and all worn out, slightly confused at the sudden lack of people around them, and Dean can’t help but chuckle at the sight.
“What did he tell you?” Dean asks, and Cas knows him enough to know he’s doing his best not to explode.
My point is- Dean Winchester, you’re my most beautiful story. You’re the air that I breathe, the sun on my face and the love that I kept coming back to endlessly. The stars above me might be the stars from yesterday already, but when I look at you sleeping next to me right now, I know it’s you. I know it’s us. With all your broken pieces and our soft edges, with all our love and our flaws.
Dean’s mind is going 50 miles an hour while he races to Lawrence General Hospital in less time than it would normally take for anyone with normal driving skills and no death wish to do so. His mind has been a whirling of thoughts going around and around and around again inside his head, like a song on a broken record. He tries to ignore it but it just keeps getting louder.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean I have any insight on what’s going on inside that pretty little head of his.”
“Because you need some space to think about what decision you’re going to make, and I need to let you.”
“Yes!” Benny lets out in a long-suffering sigh at the same time. “Nothing worth sharing with you, kid. Drink your coffee now.”
“We both learned that uh,” he starts hesitantly, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck to hide his discomfort. “He didn’t dump me ten years ago.”
Not that this was ever your fault. I guess love just has a way of breaking us in ways we never expected, and sometimes we end up becoming people we never thought we’d be.
And this morning, his dark hair completely disheveled, his 5 o’clock shadow and Dean’s shirt exposing the tan skin of his shoulder are making Dean’s mind even more slow to process anything remotely important.
Dean sighs. Picks up the stupid box of rice on the counter and threads his fingers through Cas’ as he makes his way back into the apartment.
“Dean is gone,” Jimmy interrupts, probably a bit too harshly judging by the flash of pain that comes over Cas’ face before only grief is left. “He’s gone, Cas. It’s over. He’s not coming back. We’re on our own.”
Well, this is a new development. He didn’t expect Cas to pick this up immediately, but it’s a breach he can exploit.
Jimmy only feels pain of the past 10 years wasted, away from his best friend and watching his brother trying so hard to stay afloat, realizing now that he’s lying on the floor seconds away from being ripped away from life that he hadn’t really been living all this time either.
Cas takes control then, pushing his head further down and gliding in until Dean is forced to breathe through his nose, his fingers digging into Cas’ hips where there will no doubt be bruises in the morning to remember.
“Well, I don’t want to pressure you or anything. I just- I want him to see us. I don’t want him to learn this from anybody else.”
His breath rapidly starts accelerating as his lack of understanding quickly mixes up with the rise of panic, the “
“You know, when I first saw you across the field during Jimmy’s funeral… I think in retrospect that’s when I
“Okay. I’m sorry for being an ass,” Dean says as Castiel straddles his lap, Dean’s arm automatically wrapping around him, his eyes never leaving the other man’s.
He’s gorgeous and Castiel’s heart aches at the sight, like it always irrevocably does when he reminds himself that he’s not allowed that thought anymore.
“You go home and you tell him the truth. You apologize for overstepping. You recognize your honest mistakes,” Missouri explains, squeezing Cas’ palms lightly. “And you hear him out. You tell him about being scared of him leaving. And maybe you tell him that you’ll give him space so that he can come to a decision on his own.”
“Long. Boring. I managed to get my 4 hours though,” Cas says as they start crossing through the hall.
He lets go of the bullet that falls back onto his chest with little ting, before he drags his fingers over the letters engraved on the frame.
Dean smiles. Here’s an opening to tear Cas away from whatever had him snap in the first place, and finally relax. And Cas has expressed wanting to know more in the past few weeks. So he goes all in.
It feels good. Right. Like everything is finally falling into places. He burrows closer, wraps himself tighter around Dean, finds the spot to rest into the crook of Dean’s neck where it’s warm and soft and tender. Where it smells like all the things he kept missing for so long.
Cas’ hand slides on his arm until it reaches his knee, a welcomed sensation grounding Dean to earth. It’s been years, yet he still has to close his eyes on impact as all the guilt and rage comes back in a swirl.
Sometimes Cas wonders if it’s truly what he’s been made for, if the stretch of Dean’s lips around his cock is a gift or God or whatever, but right now he recognizes the way his stomach curls and his balls tightens as Dean keeps going faster on his length for what it is.
“Just because you’re here and you’re trying to recover doesn’t mean you’re broken. You’ve been… Essentially, you’ve been ripped away from home and tossed into war for the past 10 years. No one expects you to be a regular-Joe in the span of three months, Dean.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Cas interrupts, propping himself up against the headboard of their bed. “I didn’t ask you to come for a reason. I know how busy you are.”
. Mostly,” Dean says, and Cas can feel the edge of exhaustion in his voice, the quiet lull of slumber. “You’ve been gone less than 24 hours and it’s already agony.”
Master Chief Laffite’s inquisitive gaze is on him, and no matter how many times he ponders, Dean is at a loss for words.
He looks around quickly to see if he catches sight of Jess, but all he sees around him are unknown faces. His heart starts beating out of rhythm in his chest.
“Do you even know that he calls me almost every month and sobs about Cas for an hour before he starts insulting himself over it? Every month, Jimmy. Even on deployment, on the other side of the world, he finds the time to call me and tell me that he misses your brother like hell. He called me from Iraq at 2 in the morning and he was crying like an absolute madman at the end of the line, because he was missing
Dean does as he’s told, but somehow his eyes just keep going back to the dark-haired man standing across from him. To the way his black suit seems to be tailored the perfect way to display everything that is perfect about him. Dean mentally smacks himself for even having the nerve to notice this.
But the ache in his heart as he hears Dean’s voice through the phone is something so raw that for a second he considers packing up and going back home right now.
“I thought you were ashamed of me. That you only loved me when I was stable enough, that me being a fucking junkie was the last straw for you to leave.”
Charlie nods. “Yes. I can’t guarantee that he’ll still want to talk to you after that, but he’ll read it. And then this is in their hands. They’re grown-ups. It’s out of your hands once you post the letter to Dean and once you’ve talked to your brother.”
“And I said I didn’t remember, because part of me doesn’t want to remember that time, part of my brain blocked it away from me because it’s too painful to remember. But what I do remember is I slept through the night like a baby after Jimmy stuck those things to the ceiling.”
Tears start rising behind Cas’ eyes at these words. He doesn’t talk about Jimmy, not anymore. Not after everything that happened in the past few months, but damn does he miss him. And Dean’s right, there’s no point in staying mad anymore. Not when Jimmy has been the one bringing them back together. Not when Jimmy’s dead and gone, and they have a new shot at a life they thought was lost forever.
Cas can’t help but let his head fall back against the wall, eyes closing as Dean’s hand quickens around both of them, setting every single cell of his body alight with want and need. Dean’s lips find their way onto the skin of his exposed throat, sealing bruising kisses underneath his jaw, and it’s so good that it feels like floating into another galaxy.
Sometimes it amazes Cas, how easy sex is between them. Even after all this time, after all the hurt and the missing each other, it still feels like the first time. Dean’s hand on him still trails lines of fire on his skin, and it still feels like riding a fucking comet anytime Dean’s lips find him, his hand quickening and tightening around his rock-hard cock. It takes a lot out of Cas not to rut into Dean’s hand, and he concentrates to do the same to Dean, relishing the moans that fall out of Dean’s lips as he thumbs at the head of his cock.
Cas laughs and takes Benny’s outstretched hand to get back on his feet before they both head back inside. Dean immediately catches them as they cross the bay window, and a wide smile appears on his face as Cas makes his way to him.
“When’s the last time you talked to him?” he asks Balthazar as he immediately texts Charlie, asking if she’s seen Cas.
He tries his hardest not to react too dramatically, but the way his heart sinks and the little voice in his head starts cackling that
Castiel just sighs, not finding enough strength to come back with a witty response. He lets his eyes scan the crowd instead.
They don’t train you for this — for the painful choices and decisions you have to take after you get lifelong injuries. They don’t teach you how you’re supposed to choose between leaving and shattering your entire career (that same career you’ve dedicated your entire life to for the past decade), or staying but having to live with the bitter taste of being left behind a desk in a dusty office for the rest of your life.
Jimmy smiles too. It’s been a while since they’ve sat on the deck together quietly. A while since they’ve shared anything really. Between his shifts at the hospital and the last of his exams at school, it’s not like he had a lot of time to spare. And Cas’ job at the different journals he works for keeps him pretty busy too.
When they finally part, Dean feels content to just watch as Cas rummages through the box he wrapped with the camera, containing all the different colorful frames he’s picked for Cas to try.
The world had been quieter ever since they knocked Chuck off the board and rode into the sunset to wherever life would take them. A couple of hunts here and there, nothing too complicated to take care of, and both brothers had allowed themselves to let go little by little, finding solace in figuring out what the rest of their respective lives could mean now that they were finally free.
This is a problem for tomorrow-Cas, not right-now-Cas, Castiel decides as Dean’s leg easily slots between his thighs, keeping him pinned to the wall without effort.
Dean’s cock is leaking with precum on his stomach and he thinks for a wild second that just watching Cas riding his fingers on top of him could be enough to make him come, entirely untouched. But then Cas’ eyes open again to stare right at him, his forehead pressed against his, and yeah, no, he needs to be inside of Cas like, right
There’s a beat. Balthazar looks like he’s been struck by lightning, and then his eyes turn a very specific shade of blue.
We're still at the very beginning of his journey without Cas, so keep in mind that things are still extremely fresh in his mind.
In a surprising turn of events that may or may not have involved Balthazar crashing into their living room the morning after Benny’s arrival, they decide to organize a small party at home with Jess, Sam, Balthazar, Alicia and Charlie the following night as a way for Benny to see everyone. He’s only staying 5 days, and it makes it easier for him to catch up with everyone and meet the few he hasn’t before. Dean makes dinner, Balthazar and Sam handle the booze, and all in all the evening is extremely nice and pleasant, conversations flowing and people meddling very quickly and smoothly.
“No, but it’s nice to see you back in the game,” Bobby snickers. “Sam told me you were a sniper, and you were already as good of a shooter as anyone else before you joined the Navy.”
An idea pops up, and he takes a hold of his phone and makes a few phone calls, shoots a few texts. It takes a little while until all is set, but he can hear the shower spray indicating that Cas is in the bathroom so he doesn’t have to hurry too much. Once he’s done, he makes his way to the kitchen with a plan in head.
He closes his eyes, stays silent for a while and tries really hard to ignore the tears that are prickling at the corner of his eyes.
Cas swallows, wondering how to phrase it before his mind gets away from him and decides to outright say it. Missouri always has a way of coaxing things out of him anyway.
It’s been a month since I saw you last, yet it feels like an entire year passed. Illinois is cold, the sun isn't as bright as it sets on the outline of the city, and there’s no one here that looks at me like you do. Or, used to. I don’t know anymore...
“Did you two conspired against me?” Dean asks against the shell of his ear, a smile woven into his voice.
Yeah, he looks beautiful. Dean's heart misses a beat at the sight, and misses another when Cas finally spots him in the crowd of other people waiting and smiles widely at him.
They’re silent for a little while before Dean breaks it again as they’re closing in on the end of the river track.
I know pretty much no one will believe this, but next week is the fluffiest chapter I've ever written for this. I know, I know, but these two deserve a break don't you think? (Before I throw them through more loops *eyes chapters left*)
He tries to ignore the subtle tremor of his hand after 20 minutes, but Bobby notices. He doesn’t say anything but Dean knows that it’s gonna take a little more than one visit to the range and 3 therapy sessions to get him through his trauma.
He tries to get his composure back but fails miserably, and decides here and there to give up, pressing his eyes into his palm and full-on crying like a kid.
Dean feels it drop to his stomach- the fear that courses through him every time he thinks about losing Cas again is still here, waiting for any excuses to rise back up again. And what Cas is going through, he gets it. Of course he gets it. He’s lived with it for so long that it’s ingrained into his mind- the memory of a trenchcoat floating in a river, of wings burned out in the sand and kneeling for hours over a dead body; of a dimly lit street and a barely standing telephone booth and the giddiest fucking feeling he’d ever felt; of black ooze taking Cas away from him before Dean went and fought to get him back.
It doesn’t matter that they’re at odds ever since what happened after the party. It doesn’t matter that Cas is mad at him. It doesn’t matter that he feels like shit for still loving him after everything. What matters is that Dean finally stops crying, that he opens his eyes to stare at Cas and feel
That’s it. That’s all it takes for Dean to rise to his feet and hug the living shit out of his uncle.
But thinking about bees makes him think about Cas and his obsession with them, and he has to stop before his mind threatens to use every curse in the dictionary to knock some sense into him.
There’s something fizzling inside those baby blues, and Dean leans in to brush a soft kiss against Castiel’s lips then, delighting in the little shiver that courses alongside Cas’ spine, knowing full well it’s not coming from cold.
Dean’s perpetually taking aback by how good he looks, but tonight there’s something more reeking off him. Something about alcohol and despair that paints another look of pain onto his shoulders.
to this story though, because my stupid brain keeps coming up with new ideas every now and then and this story kept expanding because of this. So we should end this ride at 20 chapters, but this is probably going to grow into a verse, seeing as I don't really feel like letting these two go... Be it a sequel, a prequel or various one-shots, timestamps or whatever, I'm not letting these two go anytime soon. ❤️
Cas climbs back into bed and immediately plasters himself against Dean’s side, a sigh escaping his lips as Dean’s warmth seeps through his shirt. Dean turns the lights off and wraps his arms around Cas, bringing him impossibly closer.
It’s addressed to “Chief Petty Officer Dean Winchester”, and call it a sixth sense or a bad presentiment, but when Cas’ heart misses a beat at the sight he knows that can’t be a good thing.
He drops his head into Cas’ shoulder again then, and follows the faint white marks where his shoulder and arm meet with one finger. He knows what these are — track marks where Cas used to inject heroin into his muscle to get off. He has some on his arms still, some more ancient marks on his legs from when he started using. But these look more recent.
“I never knew how… intense humanity could be. How the sun on my skin can burn so bright it lights up everything in me, or how some scents just keep sending me to part of my past,” Cas says and Dean melts against him, closing his eyes for the first time, “it’s overwhelming. But it’s also overwhelming in all the bad ways, too.”
Dean moves into the Novaks' apartment, and for a while things are fine... Until they're not, not really.
Balt rolls his eyes. “I don’t think you telling me that you’ve shagged the soldier once you were drunk off your ass after one night out really qualifies as me figuring it out, Cassie.”
Dean hates the way his heart aches when he thinks about not receiving any texts from Jimmy ever again. Even the annoying one with stupid jokes at random hours. Dean would read them on the C-17, en route to an op or back to base, and it would make him laugh like a maniac half of the time.
He gets up and weaves his fingers through Dean’s, forcing him to get up and follow as he makes his way to the kitchen where all the drinks they need are stored.
He gathers his brother’s belongings and takes him back to rehab a few hours after instead. The last thing Cas asks his brother is to “
Cas goes on. “When you went to see him the first time, you had just started PT, you had just moved in… a lot of stuff has changed in the past month. I think you could at least consider it?”
“I’m okay,” Cas murmurs softly into his hair, his other hand still resting on Dean’s cheek and slowly grazing the line of his jaw. “I’m here. It’s alright, you can let go. I’ve got you, Dean.”
“I guess I don’t understand why you’d want that after the way they treated you after your accident,” Charlie says softly after a while, reaching for Dean’s hand on the table. “And you’ve got a new start here. You and Cas are together again, you’ve got a job with Bobby. I just… isn’t that enough for you?”
“The truth is I’m fucking terrified of fucking you up. Because you deserve so much more than this, and I don’t know how to do any of that anymore. I got so much shit on my back, so many scars, so many ruined pieces. I’ve always been too hard to love, too complicated to want. This is something close to a battlefield. I don’t know how to love without breaking. I don’t know how to want without shattering. I don’t know how to let you in. Even though I want to.”
Later that night, after Castiel has taken him to the city of sins and back at least 4 times, he bites kisses underneath the cut of the angel’s jaw, lying naked against his side.
Like always, Dean wakes up with a jolt and the urge to reach for a gun. Something about a leopard cannot change its spots, yadda yadda yadda. He’d thought it would come to pass, but it happens to still very much be a work in progress. His therapist keeps telling him it’ll come, and Dean keeps working towards this. But habits die hard.
And in retrospect, maybe he did. Only that lightning bolt ripping through his life is named Dean Winchester, and he’s pretty glad.
“No, I’m being serious here. What happened, did Alicia complain about your uptight dressing style again?”
, Cas thinks. The air is still warm, the way the beginning of September always is until it turns into fall. They’ve started Sophomore year and for the first time in 5 years, Dean and Cas don’t share every class like they used to before.
Cas works better at 3 am than he does at any other hour during the day, which means he usually goes to bed late but still rises up early.
He looks so utterly lost that Dean can’t help but slide closer, letting his hand drop on Cas’ knee and trying really hard not to delight too much at the reaction it seems to stir from Cas, his eyes slightly widening at the touch.
It’s already pushing 8 pm, but the lights are out in the apartment. Dean takes his duffel bag out of the trunk and makes his way to the door, ready to take his key out when it opens before him.
Dean sighs, looking up to the sky. The night is clear and the stars visible, and for a brief moment his mind drifts to a dark-haired man in Lawrence, wondering if Cas is awake too.
Of losing Cas over and over again until he couldn’t stand it anymore. And there’s nothing he wouldn’t do to prevent it from happening ever again.
Tears prickle behind his eyes but he won’t cry. Not now, not after everything. The heat and the anger that was coming from Bobby the last time he was here, almost crushing him under its weight, is completely gone and replaced by genuine concern painted on his face.
“Do you even know how sinful you look on your knees in that stupidly small shower when you suck me off?”
Cas’ hand is on his arm suddenly and it takes a lot out of Dean not to flinch at the touch, not to feel guilty about the goosebumps lighting up his skin.
“We should go to bed, you look like you need to sleep for the next 12 hours,” Dean jokes, half-hoping Cas has forgotten about his idea.
The empty dial tone that follows Benny hanging up rings several times into his ear before Dean disconnects the phone and goes right back to staring at his ceiling.
What can he change at that point? He’s got a defunct leg, a brain that refuses to work correctly, a body that’s been shattered by war and tainted by injuries, a heart that denies anyone that dares approaching him no matter how much Dean might want to.
It kills him to see how weak he still is. It’s been a solid month since he got out of the hospital. At least 3 weeks since he got rid of the crutches and he’s still going to physical therapy twice a week, but walking is still a constant work in progress and he
Dean is standing in the corner, tears staining his cheeks, looking about ready to pass out. Cas is lying at his feet, with both paramedics trying their best to revive him. He’s as white as a sheet, his stark hair a vivid contrast with how colorless his face is. He’s wearing the t-shirt that Jimmy bought him for Christmas- the Red Hot Chilli Pepper one from Japan that he’d spent weeks tracking down.
Cas lowers his eyes, seemingly desperate to break from Dean’s intense gaze. “You already have your shit to deal with, I don’t want to drop this on you on top of the rest.”
When he finally bottoms out, his balls pressed against the curve of Cas’ ass, it feels so overwhelmingly
It’s so easy to lose himself in the rhythm of Cas’ mouth against his. Cas doesn’t kiss to bruise, doesn’t touch to take, doesn’t hurt to make a point. He’s soft and slow and gentle and everything Dean has missed for so long. He’s warm and full against him, his moans sending shivers into every single one of Dean’s bones.  Dean groans lightly against his mouth when he feels Cas’ hand rubbing insistently at the bulge of his boxers and pulls away just a second to look at Cas.
He eyes him suspiciously over the screen of his laptop open on the living room table as Dean shucks his jacket off and makes his way to him.
you moved in and the dull look on your face whenever you rise in the middle of the night just like tonight, that’s because you’re a
Cas takes a deep breath. Try to clear his path through his thoughts to figure out exactly how he’s going to get where he wants to get.
Dean scoffs. “Are you kidding? I wanted to quit years ago. Treat myself to some beach vacations with tiny cocktails and matching Hawaiian shirts with you and Sam. I just- Things kept happening and I’ve hunted my entire life, it’s my default state. I just made peace with never quitting because it didn’t seem like we could at the time.”
Call it a whiff of good judgment or instinct, the fact remains that somehow Dean decided to go back home somewhere between Jessica’s apple pie and Sam’s 37th concerned look.
“I know that’s not easy to understand for you guys, but I’ve been working toward this for years. It’s like-,” Dean stops, trying to find the right metaphor. “Say, if tomorrow Sam’s CEO marched into his office and told him “
It doesn’t happen as frequently as it used to, but 4 weeks of therapy on top of physical therapy kicking his butt have found new ways of fucking with him, and it’s honestly not so great.
So I will keep my sunken touch out of your life. I will not force you to watch me fall. Of all the people I have loved and all the people I have lost, none deserved to be happy more than you. Even if that means I’ll never get to hear your voice again.
“And I know you’re hurting right now, and you feel like it’s never going to stop. You feel like it takes so much space inside you can hardly feel anything else… but eventually it’ll ease, and you’ll learn how to live again with that sting in your heart.”
It feels like the weight of the world finally drops from Dean’s shoulder, for a few blessed seconds.
“I got back to his room the other day, after we fought. Found this in a box next to his bed. I didn’t even know he had kept it.”
Cas squirms on his seat suddenly, and Dean looks away from the road to look at him, but the other man keeps his gaze ostensibly on the outside.
“Am I still a felon in your book?” He asks jokingly, and he can almost feel the curve of Dean’s smile where his mouth is pressed against the slope of his shoulder blade.
Castiel glides a finger over Dean’s scruff along his jaw, watching him closely with half a smile on his lips,
“What could I even say? “Hey Cas, do you remember me? You dumped me a decade ago, and I’ve barely managed to be in a relationship ever since. I got blown up and basically booted from the Navy, so now I’m back. How about we grab coffee, try to catch up?” Yeah, that’s a fantastic idea.”
What good would it make? Castiel’s place is in London, with his friends and his love for academics. Not with a drop-out mechanic with a high-school diploma and less than 10 bucks to his name.
If he had to describe it, Castiel would say that suddenly losing your twin brother in a shooting while he was out getting a bottle of milk at the convenience store down the street in the middle of the night, and subsequently being the only member of the family left alive at 27 feels like shit.
There’s something snapping within him, something that if you looked close enough at you’d probably see similarities with how Jimmy decided to leave Gallagher’s a year prior.
Jimmy’s blood boils in his system and he throws the door open with as much bravado as his 16-year-old body can provide. He momentarily forgets about how cold he is, how tired he feels after a full day of work, and focuses on the scene in front of him.
He doesn’t know what he expected- this thing between them, it’s tentative at best. It’s not like they
He’s used to blood covering his hands, to digging graves and burning corpses, to witches and ghosts and vampires and werewolves and ghouls, to awful diner food reheated at 4 in the morning.
They part ways soon after, Dean getting ready for his usual morning PT and Cas locking himself up in his office to work. As he watches him walk away, Dean can’t help but replay their kiss from the night before as if he hadn’t done that all night long already. The way Cas said his name so reverently, so softly, even after all this time; how he still kissed his lips one last time, even after Dean had stopped him instead of getting pissed off. How his beautiful baby blues shone with something almost dangerous.
“Hey Cassie,” his friend Teddy exclaims upon noticing his brother standing there with a bewildered look on his face. “We saved you some pancakes and there’s fresh coffee on the counter waiting for you.”
“Okay, alright. I was just trying to look out for you,” Charlie says, eyeing him carefully while sipping on her tea. She takes  her knees to her chest, and settles more comfortably in her chair.
For the first time since they got back together, Cas has a work conference to attend in Austin for 3 days. Dean's insecurities rise up to the surface.
Dean perked up at the sound of the door opening and closing, and frowned when he saw the cardboard box in Cas’ hands. Holli immediately jumped from the couch to greet Cas, and sniffed around the box with a puzzled gaze.
Castiel sighs deeply, half defeated half relieved that someone is there to help him go through what is probably the worst day of his entire existence.
It’s one of those nights where they went to bed mad at each other that Cas wakes up in the middle of the night to an empty bed. He tries not to freak out; they’re way past the point where finding an empty bed is supposed to make them jump out in fear that the other has run away- at least, supposedly.
Fuck it. That’s not fair. No one should hold that much power over someone else, and yet here he is. Gaze glued to the ceiling in the middle of the night, replaying the 30-second kiss he shared with Dean hours ago.
“I’m going to miss you too,” Cas whispers against him, squeezes him one last time before letting go. One minute and he’s gone.
Little Creek — Joint Expeditionary Base–Little Creek (JEB–LC), formerly known as Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and commonly called simply Little Creek, is the major operating base for the Amphibious Forces in the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet.
He thinks of broken hearts and having to run, thinking there was nothing left for him here in Lawrence, heartbroken and orphaned again as he ran without a glance behind.
“Shh,” Cas murmurs into his mouth before kissing him softly, trapping his bottom lip between his teeth lightly before letting go. “I got you, baby.”
fine. He doesn’t need to be a dramatic idiot about this. He’ll be home and back by Dean’s side in less than two days. He can do this like a normal person.
“Nah. Benny’s supposed to call in a little while,” Dean says, his voice rumbling underneath Cas’ lips where they’re pressed on Dean’s throat. “You know, checking in. He takes this dad gig very seriously.”
The night is cold but clear, and the moon up above shines a dull white glow onto the street. February is just around the corner at that point, and the sky is so clear that you could see the constellations if you tried hard enough. Lawrence is silent around them, and 3 AM doesn’t seem so scary anymore.
“Me too, always,” Cas fires back and Dean’s moan all the way from Kansas tells him just enough about what Dean needs. “Come for me, Dean. I’m-
He rises up on his elbows then, taking in the room around him. The light glow of the moon passing through the blindfold is enough for him to identify the clutter on the dresser- a mess of flannels, Cas’ sports shorts, stranded socks, and a lonely sneaker that thrones from the top of the pile, for some reason. Dean sits up in bed, embracing the silence the apartment seems to be bathed in, before he finally gets out of bed.
“You’re not listening to me, are you?” Cas asks, turning his head just enough to take sight of Dean.
“What do you mean what happened?” Dean plays dumb, knowing very well that Bobby either already knows or picked up on his weird stance.
Anything he comes across that faintly reminds him of Jimmy gets thrown across the room— the boxsets of every single tv show he loved that he made a point of collecting, his books, his fucking stethoscope that for some reason stayed on the coffee table for two months — and Cas delights in the noise it produces.
It feels like so long ago. Like an alternate universe where all the shit they went through didn’t happen. A planet where Jimmy is still alive and Dean never left, never thought about leaving at all. A world where the only pain Cas would feel would be the pain of having to muscle through Dean and Jimmy’s bantering over the breakfast table.
It rolls in and takes him like a wave crashing on the shore. “You,” he whispers against Dean’s lips. “I want
“I can’t believe we’re leaving,” Cas says as they break away after one last kiss, Dean’s hand solid on his hips. “It still feels unreal.”
He barely has time to close his lips around the tip before Cas explodes into his mouth, his hand tightening in Dean’s hair while he fists the sheets into the other, trying so hard to keep his voice down as everything explodes into him. It’s like everything lights on fire, Dean’s fingers resting on his hip bones as he swallows his release down sending flashes of electricity into his nerves. He’s vaguely aware that Dean’s climax rolls over right after him, Dean moaning soundly as he sucks Cas’ cock clean before letting go, completely out of breath.
Dean gulps, knowing that Benny’s about to kick his ass whatever he says. So in the end he says nothing, and Benny ends up picking up the conversation again.
He pulls back to look at Dean, his eyes automatically wary. Dean chuckles, recognizing that look for what it is, knowing there’s a full cross-examination coming.
to let you go,” he adds, his eyes opening again and catching Dean’s, watching as fresh tears spill down his cheeks. “But if you’re serious about wanting to heal... about wanting to try again at some point. I think we need to go our own way for a little while.”
“Well, you forgot the beers and then the whisky, and then the BACON, Cas! It’s like you called it out on yourself,” Dean interrupts, and if Cas wasn’t so irritated already he would’ve caught the smirk and the playful tone, but he is, as a matter of fact, getting even more irritated by the second.
“I’ve never seen you like this in the 10 years you’ve spent at Little Creek,” Benny finally says, his eyes locking in with Dean’s.
Charlie sighs, understanding that the subject is now closed, and says with the most annoyed voice she can find. “Yes sir, I will be your Uber today.”
“Missed you,” Cas breathes out, trying not to make such a big deal about how his entire body relaxes into Dean’s embrace, even after months together. “If you think we should bring it up with Terry, just do it. I don’t think he’s suffering from separation anxiety but it’s better to check regardless.”
“Thank you for telling me all this. I know what it took for you to open up and I… I think I needed to hear all this, to understand better why you act the way you act. But there’s stuff I need to say too. Stuff that you need to hear. Okay?”
And as Dean looks at him as he crosses the living room to the corridor, his ass in those jeans a sinner’s dream. He can’t help but smirk back at Benny.
, look at me!” Cas pleads, tightening his hold on his face, both of his thumbs stroking his cheekbone in a tender gesture to try and soothe him. “Hey. Look at me. Dean,
Even his voice feels softer, smoother. Cas lets his fingers wander down the nape of his neck, grazes the line of his throat, goes up his jaw to finally cup his cheek tenderly.
Once again, Dean does his best not to appear bruised by Bobby’s sarcastic tone. He’d known this wasn’t gonna be a piece of cake, but there’s so much animosity reeking off his uncle’s skin. So much anger and disappointment inside his voice, that he realizes maybe coming here was a mistake after all.
Dean smiles despite himself. It’s not like they intended to keep it a secret, but it had been really enjoyable for the both of them to just keep it on the low-key and spend as much time together as they possibly could. That of course resulted in most of their closest friends to either figure out on their own or being told about them. But Dean isn’t naive. Cas is a pretty known guy within Lawrence, and the Winchester boys are too. Especially now that Dean had come back several months back with half his body in shambles, and military medals and awards that would put anybody to shame.
All of it was different with you. We knew that forever didn’t exist for us, and neither of us cared. However this would end, you’d have been worth every second of pain I might have had to carry with me. The truth is, I loved you from the beginning, and no matter how much time I had left, I would have loved you until the end.
” for the past 6 months to know he can’t even dream of ever going back on the field. But being able to run again is high on his list of things to do and he’ll be damned if he doesn’t at least manage to get back to his regular form.
Dean takes a minute to prepare a cup of Cas’ favorite tea as a way to smooth things out at least a little. Benny’s stare is heavy on his back as he crosses the living room to get into the corridor, and finally when he knocks on the door of Cas’ office where he’s most likely already working.
“Ah,” Cas nods, turning his head to try and get a glimpse of the hunter, “I woke up at 6 and I needed to stretch my legs. Didn’t want to wake you up so early, you came back pretty late last night.”
He trails off then, closing his eyes as emotions overflow him again. His mind inevitably wanders off to Dean’s face when he refused to return his “
It’s 5 am and no one else in the world could bother him at this hour if it wasn’t for Benjamin Laffite.
It’s Bobby that breaks it, eyes glued to the horizon line. Probably because he knows all about Dean not being able to meet anyone’s eyes when he’s asked to talk about these things called
It’s unfair how good he looks, and Cas hates the way it knocks his breath away. The golden light of the sun frames his hair into tiny golden droplets, making his green eyes shine just the right way for Cas’ heart to burst.
“No buts, Cas. If you don’t I’m going to push you in there myself,” Balthazar interrupts, and Castiel finally tears his eyes away from the ceiling to look at his friend. “And then you’re going to answer the hundreds of messages that your phone keeps receiving, and you’re gonna start acting like a decent human being again.”
“I should’ve called. I should’ve written. I know I should have. I don’t have an excuse for that, except that I’m sorry.”
Dean yearns for Cas’ touch so much that it hurts in all the places that aren’t supposed to hurt. He thought he had gotten used to it before, to the constant need to feel the press of Cas’ hands, the feel of his skin, knowing that he couldn’t have him. But it’s worse now that he remembers what it feels like so vividly after two months apart.
He turns his head back to the city lights and Cas can physically feel him breaking down. Quiet sobs shaking into every single one of his muscles, his weight entirely on Cas.
Dean wakes up feeling like he’s missing something. It takes a little while until he realizes that what he’s missing is Cas, and that’s enough to push him out of his haze.
It’s 3 AM but Cas seemed to be active just a couple of minutes ago, and judging by all the partying he and Balt have done for the past month, Dean’s pretty sure he’s wide awake somewhere in town. He tries not to think too much and too hard about what Balthazar and Cas might be up to, tries not to focus on who Cas might spend his night with because it’s not fair. Cas has told him, repeatedly so that he wanted to be with him. Dean is the one that asked for time. Who is he, to selfishly think that Cas doesn’t get to have some fun in the meantime?
Of course, it weighs on him to the point where it’s bordering 3 am and Cas is still wide awake staring at his ceiling in disbelief.
He briefly wonders if it’s ever going to ease up. If the pain is ever going to stop. It’s only been a day since he buried him, only 4 since he found out Jimmy would never cross the door to their apartment ever again, but the pain has been right there alongside him ever since.
Cas let his weight fall against Dean’s chest, enjoying the warmth that radiates from him. The sky above them is turning loaded quickly, and Cas briefly wonders if a storm is coming.
“Good unreal or bad unreal?” Dean smiles, placing one last kiss behind the bolt of Cas’ jaw before straightening up to look at him.
Jess immediately cuts him off and somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind he finds it in himself to feel a tad bit grateful, because he doesn’t feel like he can talk right now. Not with the way his heart threatens to give out, not as tears keep spilling on his cheeks.
“Sure, because having to withstand your freaky kale obsession on a daily basis seems like such a good idea.”
One of his hands is still tucked under Cas shirt and is currently running slowly along his spine, sending shivers into Cas’ nerves.
A copious amount of scalding water later, Dean doesn’t think it’s gonna be nearly enough to calm his nerves down.
He pops into Cas’ office with the box of basmati rice in hand. Cas has been locked in there all day, barely making it out to eat lunch earlier and going straight back to his desk in under 5 minutes. The only thing he did was going grocery shopping with the list Dean had made for him while Dean had therapy this afternoon.
Going to the NA had been a constant in his life for the past decade. And although he doesn’t get to as many meetings as he used to, he makes a point of going there at least once a month. Even when it doesn’t feel like he needs to.
Dean stumbles upon Benny’s porch around 3 am, holding onto his friend, barely suppressing both of their laughs. Dean decides to stop there and sits on the wooden steps. Benny gave up and is lying on the patch of grass right next to Dean’s feet.
“But you two are okay now? I mean I’ve seen the way you act around each other, and I know there’s obviously a shitload of things to work through here, but… you seem solid enough.”
He doesn’t catch sight of the angel’s sweatpants that he was definitely wearing when they both went to bed earlier, and doesn’t find the old ratty Ramones shirt he claimed ownership of to sleep in months ago (despite it being in Dean’s stuff for what was probably decades before), which allows him to breathes a sigh of release. If Cas is still wearing his pajamas, it means he’s probably somewhere in the bunker, reading a book in the Deancave or having one of his night snacks before he strolls back in bed.
“It’s a nice place you’ve got there,” Benny says as he looks around, his gaze catching on the outside deck. “Bet that’s pretty nice in the summer.”
Dean goes for the beat-up couch, the same old one that he’s spent countless afternoons on while listening to Bobby ramble about cars and clients and old stories about how Rufus was an asshole. Some part of him kept going back here for the past decade, every time he needed a safe place to go to, during his training first and all the shit he had to go through, and then multiple times when shit kept hitting him. Every lonely night when he missed his family, every OP that went wrong, every teammate he lost — it’s here he invariably came back to. The safest place, where he felt at home.
“What if I am?” Dean says as he looks back at him, voice breaking. “What if I turn out to be and you’re stuck with me?”
In the end, Dean falls back asleep into Cas’ arms. He dreams of a road trip to Mexico with Jack and Claire in the backseat; of Cas in the seat next to him wearing a Hawaiian shirt; of the waves of the Pacific ocean crashing into their tangled legs and their shared laughs as they fool around in the water; of Cas’ head on his shoulder as they watch the sun set above the mountains.
There’s a beat then, Castiel not answering right away and Dean’s heart threatening to come out of his ribcage. It’s something he’s been asking himself constantly, part of what keeps him up some nights. Does Cas ever regret choosing him?
It’s harsh and not the honest truth. And Cas knows he’s being unfair, but the simple thought of Dean going away is enough to have his heart accelerate again. He can already feel the burn of unshed tears rising behind his eyes as he concentrates on the spot on the table in front of him, trying really hard to keep it together. After all the tears he’s shed today, you’d think he wouldn’t be able to cry anymore.
Dean knows he’s rambling but Cas doesn’t seem to care, his eyes never wavering from Dean’s face, his intense stare heavy on him. Dean breathes, deep and steady, knowing that he has to get through this.
He doesn’t even have the opportunity to really think about what he’s doing until he’s walking into the room and catching Cas. His arms automatically wrap around him in a hug so fierce that Cas gasps against him, his breath ghosting over the skin of Dean’s throat where he’s pressed. He catches the smirk on Jess’ face and the wink she throws at him before she takes off and closes the curtain behind her, giving them some privacy. Dean suddenly remembers the call and his mind jumps to a halt.
For a split second, Dean actually considers leaving, not sure whether Cas wants him here or not. But then he realizes he’d rather tear his own heart out than leave him alone here. He leans against the doorframe instead, letting his eyes wander over the side of Castiel’s face. The light of the sun going down lighting up his features with a dim orange glow.
Castiel used to think sleeping was a waste of time, but this was way before when he was still a Defender of Heaven, a warrior destined to lead armies through the hellfire and battlefields.
For Sam, it meant Eileen. After a while, it meant leaving the bunker for a trip around the world. And now, it means preparing for the arrival of their baby girl in a couple of months, and handling the Hunter Network both he and Eileen have been building for months, with the help of Dean of course, but also Bobby and Charlie. Dean has never seen Sam as happy as he’s been ever since they beat Chuck and it’s been awesome to be able to witness his happiness knowing there’s nothing terrible waiting to jump on them in the darkness.
Jimmy hugs Cas tighter in response, unable to find his voice, words staying at the back of his throat scraping him painfully.
“Are you telling me you want to go to your brother’s funeral wearing JCCC sweatpants and that old ratty AC/DC shirt that’s literally been through war?” Balthazar playfully says. And Castiel doesn’t know if he wants to cry because his friend is trying so hard to cheer him up, or laugh because goddammit, Balthazar truly is a work of art. “I know Jimmy would laugh his ass off if you did, but uh… Maybe the rest of the attendants expects you to wear more formal clothes.”
But ever since Cas became human and (finally) decided to ditch his usual trench coat and stiff suit combo, started to wear jeans that actually hugged him in all the right places and shirts that made his broad shoulder and musculature visible at all time, it’s been a rollercoaster for Dean’s blood pressure and a trip to the city of sins with no hope to ever return.
There’s a tear rolling down Dean’s cheek that Cas swipes down with the pad of his thumb before leaning in for a kiss. Dean nods against him.
The sound of the bullets that fire through the air doesn’t even make him flinch. Jimmy’s picking up a bag of chips — vinegar, Cas’ favorite, because he’s trying to be a good brother even at 3 AM, in preparation of possibly losing him in less than 24h — when it hits him in several places and he collapses instantly, his body hitting the floor heavily.
Fresh tears spill from Castiel’s eyes as his heart burst into millions of pieces he thought he had sewn back together. The green in Dean’s eyes slightly fades as Cas lets go of his hands and leaves him standing alone in the kitchen, the letter resting on the kitchen island a reminder of the choice he knows he has to make.
He can hear Benny’s muffled laugh as well as if he was sitting next to him on his busted couch inside his crappy apartment.
The last thing Cas registers as he falls asleep a while after is the sound of Dean’s breath going back to normal, the steady rhythm of his heart beating underneath his ear where he’s pressed on Dean’s chest pulling him into slumber.
The sadness he gets. But it’s the despair that takes him by surprise. The way his heart seems to have moved down his throat. The way his head keeps playing “you should’ve done more for Jimmy, you should’ve come back to see him, you should’ve been here when he graduated from med school, you should’ve been here for the heartbreaks and every single failed attempt at being a successful wingman”, on a loop.
is what goes through Cas’ mind instantly, but he keeps it shut instead. He lets go of Dean’s hands and crosses his arms on his chest, chewing at his bottom lips as he watches him.
It’s almost midnight and he’s exhausted, it’s probably not the best choice he’s made in regards to his already chaotic sleeping schedule, but there’s not a fiber of his being that’s capable of sleeping anywhere that’s not directly next to Dean tonight.
He doesn’t have to look at the man sitting close to him to know he’s already rolling his eyes. He checks his watch instead, and realizes it’s almost midnight.
He thinks of friendship and love, of drugs and loss, of Jimmy’s hand clutched into his as they waited for a doctor in the hospital hallway.
And truth be told, watching the hunter sprawled out in the backseat of the Impala, the dull light of the moon illuminating his features in the darkness of the night, Castiel is almost sure life can’t get better than this.
But things are different now. Cas doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to forget, he doesn’t think the wounds will ever be able to heal completely. He’ll probably have to deal with that scar tissue until the end of his life, but he thinks that’s okay in the end. He’s already got scars littered everywhere on his body. From drugs and stupid fights and accidents and punching the walls. What one more invisible scar if not a mark of care for someone who’s gone? Dean used to be a scar too, a wound on raw skin that never really healed all those years ago. But they’re healing together now. And isn’t that what it’s really about? Wounds that heal, scar tissue that stays for you to always remember what happened while choosing to do things differently the next time?
Dean lets out a startling laugh, halfway into a sob, and hates the way his voice cracks when he answers.
“What happened?” Bobby says as he sips on his coffee and makes his way to the living room, where the table is covered in various papers.
Okay, maybe bringing these two together was actually not a good idea in the end. Cas suddenly looks at Dean, apologetic.
”. So that, as far as Cas was concerned, had sealed the deal about them ever getting a cat. But somewhere along the way, he managed to forget about it.
“I miss you,” Dean answers, out of breath, his lips still brushing against the corner of Cas’ mouth. “So much, all the time.”
He stops to take a breath. Charlie still isn’t speaking. Charlie’s always speaking. This is wrong. This is
“I don’t know. At least two though,” Cas says, looking down at him with something different twinkling in his eyes.
Cas wakes up to noises that shouldn’t be happening at what appears to be 6 in the morning. He opens his eyes and watches as Dean apparently chases the shirt that Holli has his mouth on, and groans as a sun streak renders him temporarily blind.
Her voice is soft and reassuring, and Dean momentarily forgets about Cas’ eyes shining with unshed tears this morning, and concentrates on putting one foot in front of the other for the time being.
At that, Dean pushes himself off Cas’ chest and onto one elbow, the expression on his face barely readable through the darkness of their room.
One last smile and Dean’s walking through the door, the light of the morning sun framing his body in a golden halo. It should hurt, Cas thinks fleetingly. It should be terrifying to watch Dean leave again. But somehow his mind seems to have registered that this is a necessary step into a healthier relationship at the end of the line. And the taste of Dean lingering on his lips isn’t too bad of a memory to cling onto either.
If anyone had told Dean Winchester 10 years ago that he would be delighted at the simple thought of walking barefoot on the way to his kitchen, inside his own home, only wearing boxer-briefs and a dead guy’s robe, he would have laughed and called them maniacs.
Dean lets himself be pulled toward their bathroom by a hand, laughing as Cas undresses them both like a smooth sailor. Soon enough their clothes cover the floor and Cas tugs Dean under the shower spray, smiling as they both fit into the small space one last time.
Cas smiles. For the first time in a long while, he feels light. The weight on his shoulders that’s been here forever is still here, but he’s not the only one carrying it anymore. He fishes a hand into his pocket and brings out the old polaroid, holding it out for Dean to see. He can feel the curve of Dean’s smile where his mouth is pressed against the line of his hair, and he smiles despite himself.
He sighs audibly, already mourning the loss of warmth and comfort as he starts extracting himself from Dean’s grip. The other man turns into bed which allows for an easier escape. He’s still asleep, and goes right back to snoring lightly as he presses his face into the pillow Cas slept on. Cas can’t help but smile at the sight, lightly touches Dean’s shoulder, lets his fingers wander down his back, brushing against the plane of his shoulder blade.
Dean rolls his eyes affectionately. It’s been a new thing of Cas lately, enquiring about how Dean’s body feels after they have sex. Only because he winced
“I’m just saying you haven’t been able to go on a run in almost a year, your leg still hurts when you get up in the morning and you're still bitching about how your hip feels foreign. I don’t think it qualifies for you to stop physical therapy and go back to work on cars just yet.”
There’s an uncomfortable beat in the room, one that only gets broken once Balthazar rises from the couch and declares that he needs a beer (effectively getting some from the fridge). Cas finally tears his eyes away from Dean to bicker about his friend raiding the beer stash like he owns the place.
The air outside is warm enough for him to get rid of his denim jacket as he starts walking. Lawrence at this time of year is usually Castiel’s favorite. When it’s just hot enough for him to walk around town just wearing a shirt, when flowers start blooming and people start staying outside longer at night. There’s a different buzz to the town, a warmth that doesn’t come only from the nicer temperature, but from people hanging out in the streets and kids roller skating on the pavement.
