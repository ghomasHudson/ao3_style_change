"It's better than pretending she never existed, though.  What she did to you won't go away if you don't think about it." John was matter-of-fact.
"How are you today?"
"No."
"His brother isn't testifying, is he?" John asked.  He couldn't imagine he would; that would truly be a death knell to whatever relationship Sherlock and Mycroft had.
"Do you have any other family?"
"Do you know how she got that?"
"What about him?" he finally asked.
"For how long have you been practicing medicine?"
"Well, I didn't like the woman when she came up to us.  There was something not right about her tone of voice.  But it was the bit at the end that made me think something was wrong.  She didn't just give him a pat on the shoulder.  It was more like a lover's caress."  Victor visibly shivered.  "And he didn't seem to like it, but he didn't seem to think that was wrong, either."  Even now he looked distressed.  "It just felt wrong, for lack of a better word."
For the first time in many hours, John was alone with Sherlock.  John wasn't sure what he was going to say and was almost relieved when Sherlock's mobile went off.  "Lestrade?  I know you had Phillip over at the Yard today for a lineup.  You've already searched the house?  That was fast."  There was a very long period of silence, and what little color there was drained from his face.  "I see."  His voice wavered.  "No.  Don't try to talk me out of it, either.  I'm seeing this to the end."  He disconnects and tosses the mobile on the sofa.  His eyes were suddenly blank.  "They searched Her house earlier today."  He sounded tired.
The man now looked at Sherlock, then the other two again. "What is Arthur going on about now?"
John showered, shaved, and got dressed in record time.  He didn't want to leave Sherlock alone for too long.  When he got out he was pleased to see Sherlock had at least gotten out his clothes.  "Take a shower," he told him.  "If you're not out in twenty minutes, I'll knock on the door."  John remembered well how red his skin had been after that one nightmare.  Sherlock nodded and headed for the bathroom.  He came out in precisely twenty minutes, looking ghostly pale instead of red.  He did get dressed without further prompting.
“Yes he did.  You must be John Watson,” said one of them.  “Is Dr. Martin in here?”  She sounded very businesslike.
"What did she say to that?"
"That Sherlock Holmes was so good with her." Mr. Aherne's voice was still wet with tears, but he looked like he was making an effort to cheer himself some. "He's a good man. Any time he wants to talk to Moira again I'll let him. No wonder the Yard calls on him so often." John and Lestrade shared a glance, but were both able to refrain from bursting into laughter.
"What did you do there?"
When they finally did get out the door, John's attempts at small talk were met with a distant stare, and as a result the cab ride felt even longer than the one he had taken yesterday. Once they were at the hospital proper, Sherlock strode through the doors, past the admissions desk, and towards the lift, as if he were so important that no one would even think to question what he was doing. Of course, the lift was delayed for no reason anyone could see, and John (who knew better than to try any small talk this time) let his eyes wander down the hall and towards a suture room with an open door, where a woman with dark hair was saying irritably, "Look, it didn't hurt, so I didn't realize it was that bad, okay?" as a gash in her arm was stitched up. He never saw who she was talking to, as the lift finally came and they ascended to the correct floor.
"By that you mean more than one finger in one place?"
"It's been hard for him," John offered.
Since Douglas wasn't in the hall itself or the living room, he walked down the hall into the kitchen. He was indeed there, and from what Sherlock could see he had been attempting to make either stew or stir-fry; the meat and vegetables on the counter were however so cut up they resembled an attempt at puree. Once he heard Sherlock enter the room, he turned around. "We need to establish some rules." Cutting the vegetables and meat must have diminished his anger, as he spoke flatly; of course the reason he was so angry was that his relationship with the body (as Sherlock had begun to think of the absent person) was not long-term and he was nervous over previous failed marriages. Of course, that must have been what the cheerful one meant about the extra brilliant part. He meant that he wanted his mother's wedding to be a double wedding with these two. That was the reason for the "Not after six months" comment from Douglas. While the man had clearly not been the brightest, he seemed to understand people well and must have seen something that indicated a bright future for the two of them. Sherlock tried to imagine how he'd feel if this had happened six months after he got involved with John instead of two years. Much to his dismay he could see himself acting like Douglas.
"Yes, I know you did. But how did you get cut?" He suspected at this point he wasn't going to get any further than anyone else did.
"There's a lot of reasons.  The physical sensations are certainly part of it."  He paused to gather his thoughts.  "I would have to say that's a major part of it.  Not just orgasm, but the physical closeness, just touching someone skin to skin.  There's emotional closeness, too.  It's not always there, of course, but when it is it makes things feel better.  That's what makes it pleasurable for me, at least."
"Yes."
She raised her eyebrows before she spoke, like she wasn't sure he'd believe her.  "All I know is that the person who rented it made the offer before my time.  In the past five years I've never seen the renter at all.  Other people in the building have heard noises in there, and the few times I've gone in there myself I've seen some furniture and odds and ends, but never a person.  Very odd.  The tenant - a Dana Lester - sends me checks every month like clockwork, so it's not like I can evict them, and the flat's always clean."
Once again Harvey came up to the stand.  "So Dr. Martin said she'd marry you someday?"
Moira trusts John a very little bit, so a friend of his is someone she feels slightly more comfortable with. She's also trying to make sure Sherlock isn't an ally of K.
John sat there until the others were gone, including the prosecution, and then slipped out the door himself.  As soon as he got into the hall, he saw Jennifer and her father walking down towards the exit.  Jennifer was chattering to him about the hotel they were staying in and about how much of the city they could see from the windows.  It was a strangely uplifting sight.  K had apparently not squeezed all the joy out of her as with some of the others.
"What is it?" John asked.
"When your brother came home, why was he as upset as you say he was?"
"So you weren't present for Phillip's lineup?"
"Because She said She loved me.  No one else did."
"Once I turned eighteen.  It'd be legal then."
He typed in the numbers all by themselves.  "Still nothing."
"And Jennifer never said anything to you about who had been abusing her?"
They sat there like that, John holding Sherlock, rocking him slightly, letting his tears wet John's jumper.  John murmured quiet declarations of affection until Sherlock's breathing eased out.  A few minutes later, John followed him into sleep.
“Unfortunately no.”  Sherlock proceeded to type a few things into the program.  “I think if we enter the whole sequence into this program it will give us the message.”
"No, she didn't.  There were all sorts of things that indicated it, but she never said who it was."
Sherlock is cross-examined and there's a big surprise.
"Pictures of you and her?  Engaged in sexual activity?"  John silently cursed himself for phrasing it in such an awkward way, but there was no taking it back.  Sherlock appeared to not notice that and moved his head in the smallest nod John had ever seen.  "What did you think would happen if she did send them to him?"
"I got to read all kinds of books.  She made nice things for me to eat and let me sit in Her lap and we'd watch telly together.  Even after school She was always glad to see me and wanted to hear about my day.  She let me have a chemistry set there since my mother wouldn't allow it."
"Mycroft – we need to talk. JH."
"Of course I will. I'd like to talk to you again. Next time I would like to have my friend John here when we talk. Do you mind that?"
"Doesn't he go home with you?" The man they called Herc didn't seem to fully understand the situation.
Mrs. Hudson was at the base of the stairs.  "I've seen everything in the papers and on the news," she told him.  "If even half of what they're saying is true that woman shouldn't get out of prison alive.  Especially that poor little girl from yesterday.  They didn't show her on the telly, of course, it was just a reporter reading from the trial transcript, but the things she went through..." She shook her head as she trailed off.
"Well, all right, but you still need to sleep," John persisted.  "If you really, truly cannot sleep, I'll give you some sort of sedative, but you need to at least try."
He really didn't know what to do about that when Sherlock wasn't there - it didn't happen very often - so he just nodded, said "I'll be back," and shut the door. He took two steps away before a kid appeared from a nearby alley.
"Hi," she said cheerfully.  "Me dad moved my bed to his room.  I sleep there now.  He lets Rory sleep on my bed too."
“Did you talk to Mr. Holmes again?”
For those of you following No Final Solution: it is on hiatus until I finish The Ball I Threw. My apologies. I will finish it.
"If she brings it up on her own.  And she does."  He sounded even more angry than before.
"We'd flown to Germany. Frankfurt - I'm a pilot. I was last in my hotel room."
"The boy was the one that didn't speak much English, if I recall.  He said he'd been picked up in a car and taken to a flat where he engaged in sexual activity with the person driving the car.  There were translation issues, if I recall."  He kept his eyes fixed on John, seemingly ignoring Sherlock's presence in the room.
"Can we see the flat, at least?"  Sherlock asked.
"Was anyone there besides you?"
"Not really, but I like to draw."
"February is the cruelest month," John commented as he got tea for the both of them. He knew it wasn't a correct quote, but it was apt enough to make Lestrade chuckle.
"Like what?"
"You'd think at some point we'd stop being surprised."  She clearly wanted to say more, but the office door opened and Sherlock came out.
"Used it right away."
"I couldn't see anyone at first.  Then the woman from before came into the room.  Then I realized I wasn't wearing any clothes."
“Is there a reason why you didn’t tell anyone about this?”  Sherlock already sounded gentle, but his voice had softened even more.
"Then sit on the sofa and lean against him.  They won't see him then."
"But they let you proceed?"
"If I think it's needed."
"I put it up next to my Star Wars poster.  I was going to put this in the note too, but now I'll just say it.  I hope he'll want to see my school project," Moira piped up.
While it didn't feel right to just eavesdrop, he didn't know if any sound of outsiders would make Phillip stop talking.  And if he really found talking to Sherlock so therapeutic, John wasn't going to be the one to stop it.  "Do you dislike sleep for the dreams or for something else?"  A pause, presumably Phillip talking.  "I understand that.  You're not the only one."  Sherlock chuckled softly.  "Yes, I do, but there were a lot of years of isolation in between."  He sounded similar to when he talked to Moira, soft and gentle, but at the same time there was another element to it.  It wasn't exactly paternal, but more like giving advice as an older brother would.  "In secondary school?  Yes, one.  Until I got sent to boarding school.  Then my mother died and I never was able to find out what happened to him."  It was hard to tell whether he was talking about his abuser or someone else who just happened to be his friend.  No, wait a minute, he thought. He mentioned secondary school and he knew the abuser since he was four.  This has to be a friend.
"It's the Wild Duck Cluster. I got it for my birthday. You're smart because most people don't know what the M stands for." John was surprised he knew what it stood for, considering Sherlock claimed ignorance of the earth going round the sun, but Sherlock had shown some strange bits of knowledge in the past from areas he seemed otherwise ignorant of. Or the photograph mentioned what the M stood for; that was possible.
"No.  I told him Her middle name, because I remembered it from all the times I'd visited Her at Bart's.  And I told him about the flat She took me to."
"She was very fond of a certain lewd word.  'Fond' isn't really the right term.  She used it quite a bit, but not like a child who's figured out their parents go mad once they say it."  Mrs. Henderson looked at Susan as if she needed to make sure she understood her meaning.  "More like she'd heard it from someone.  She'd ask if today she was going to get... f-ed, I'll say."  Her face crumpled in distaste at even an abbreviated version of the word.  "She'd ask me to please f her.  She mentioned an f-ing room."
"No, I don't suppose it would be.  Let's go back home, John."  Sherlock spun on his heels and headed for the door.  John followed him.  He thought about taking his hand like he had done when they first met K, but did not.  Sherlock didn't look like he wanted to be touched.
"Yes. He was very angry. Then a few months later my mother died."
"Get out.  Get out now," he snarled.
"It's right by you on the floor."
"Not tell the police about it?"
I have read a lot of books about medicine, and most doctors will freely admit that child abuse is something that they never get used to. John is reasonably quite haunted by this.
"Did you go to that flat again?"
When he woke up, Sherlock was sitting in one of the chairs, violin in his lap.  "I thought that you wouldn't be able to adjust to the sound," he said by manner of explanation as John looked him in the eye.
After hearing that, Lestrade seemed significantly less triumphant.  "He apparently mentioned it to his father.   Said it was important."
As Mrs. Hudson sat back down and placed the mugs in front of them, she shook her head.  "And no one knew for all that time."  From the way she said it it was obvious that she didn't believe that.
"It'd be fine.  Okay.  Yes."  Each word sounded like they had been spoken with difficulty.
"I didn't say it was a credible defense."  Lestrade lay the file in front of them.  "What I think she and her solicitors are trying to do is throw out as many alternate explanations as possible to confuse the jurors.  Remember, before they see any of the evidence they'll see a nice, kind older woman.  That alone is going to make them skeptical.  Throw in that none of the supposed victims have talked before now and the fact they only did so when Sherlock talked to them and you have enough to make them doubt."
"Not yet."  Lestrade looked down at his lap.  "There's... resistance to changing the policy.  Some have said that the vast majority of children will feel better with a female officer, regardless."
"Yes.  Of course."  He didn't elaborate.
"Sometimes She liked to lay on me when I was on the table and rub on me."  She paused.  "Sometimes She hurt me with Her fingers, and sometimes I had to touch Her between her legs."  She wriggled slightly in the chair, clutching her doll closer to her.
And in fact that was what he did for the next few hours, after making himself a sandwich and tea.  (Sherlock took the tea and declined a sandwich.)  Not content to simply do the puzzles, however, he kept up a constant chatter that only seemed vaguely aware of whether Sherlock said anything or not.  “I think this goes near that face.  No, maybe it’s part of the sand.”
He opened his eyes to see Sally Donovan standing before him.  "We were asked to step away from the current case," he carefully said.
"Not at first.  I felt sorry for him because he had no friends and he seemed so standoffish.  I couldn't believe that anyone would be fine with always being alone.  It wasn't until I saw him and his mother out for a walk one day that I realized there might be more to it."  Victor's face clouded with the memory.
"Where did she kiss you?"
"Still, I didn't mean to frighten you."
"I'm aware you have feelings, Sherlock, no matter how much you try to deny them."
"You didn't like what was going on though, did you?"
"I'll take some, thanks."  He had a feeling this was going to be a day where he'd need the caffeine from two coffees.  With a final nod, he walked into the courtroom, sat down, and ate the doughnut and sipped at the coffee.  The buffalo came in as usual, followed by the press.  He eventually fell into enough of a lull that the cry of "Court rise!" startled him.
This is very late. I have no excuse.
“Brilliant!”  He started to read.  Sherlock only half-listened.  Almost against his will, the dog was bringing back memories from when he was a child.  He could even see the family picture on the mantle of the Holmes’ house, an aged Redbeard sitting in the front, tongue lolling.  He scratched the ears of the dog in his lap.
"I dunno. Just happened. Don't remember." Moira broke eye contact and turned to stare at the floor.
The standing man vigorously shook his head, causing his fringe to fall into his eyes. "Not Skip's hat.
"So you didn't try to figure out if someone broke his arm to stop him from doing something?"
"And once that was done?"
"Did the person who broke your arm agree with that?"
"The first time we went back to Her flat I looked all over it and then I went into the bedroom.  It had this really big bed, even bigger than me dad's, and I lay down on it.  She came into the room and asked if She could lie down there too and I said yes.  She took off the blouse and skirt She was wearing first, though.  I looked at Her more than I should have because I'd never seen a grown lady in underwear except me mum and she doesn't count, really.  She didn't say anything, just smiled at me.  There was all this hair near Her knickers.  You could see a lot because they weren't very big, just sort of made out of string.   I knew that happened when you grew up but I didn't think it was going to be that much.  I asked if it hurt when it grew in, like with teeth.  She said no, it was just like normal hair, and I could feel it if I wanted."  Even now, Moira looked haunted.  "I did and then She said I should take my clothes off too.  I did and She rubbed between my legs some more and..."
"They didn't show me that."
John woke up once during the night, not enough to fully register what was going on, but he did hear Sherlock say "You've been crying."
"I think we should go to your room to talk anyway. It would be quieter in there.  Also, Lestrade wants to talk to your father and he'd prefer to do so in private," Sherlock told her.  John knew perfectly well that the reason was that Mr. Aherne might react badly to the photographs, but he also knew that wasn't something Moira needed to hear.
"Does 'not me' mean there was someone the students didn't like?"
"I went back to Her house.  She said She'd see me there in a bit."
Sherlock knew he wasn't in the same place he'd fallen asleep in before he even opened his eyes.  The room smelled like stale cigarette smoke and pesticide.  The mattress was lumpy and uneven.  And furthermore, the amount of heat that the person next to him was generating indicated whoever it was was far bigger than John.  He kept his eyes shut for another thirty seconds, trying to figure out as much as he could about his surroundings without them.  The smell and the mattress indicated a cheap hotel, if one that wasn't in the business of unrespectable guests (none of those hotels would have bothered to spray for bugs).  The person next to him was a large man, sleeping on his side.  He seemed accustomed to sharing a bed with someone, possibly through travel but more likely through romantic relationships.  Not enough information to indicate which of the two had been present before Sherlock had replaced his bed mate.
In contrast to how Lestrade deals with Sherlock, he can be more direct with Mr. Aherne. This is both because he doesn't know him as well and because he connects to him on a primal level, as they're both fathers.
"If a thirteen year old was so concerned about not identifying the person he'd been sexually active with, why would he admit it in the first place?"  John resisted the urge to go and punch Clark.  Hearing him call Phillip "sexually active" when that activity had consisted of years of assaults infuriated him.
In the time it had taken Mycroft to leave, Sherlock's bee had wandered back to his lap.  He folded himself around it before saying, "Can we not have more of that talk today?"
"The solicitors all came up to the judge, argued, and then he closed court."
"What do you mean by that?" Susan asked.  She seemed much calmer than usual, as if she matched his affect.
"I came back home," John said in response.
“I know K must have been, sweetheart,” Mr. Aherne broke in.  “I wish you had told me you were so lonely, though.  You shouldn’t have to get hurt to keep a friend.”
“We'd like to hear anything that you think is relevant,” John broke in.  Sherlock nodded in his direction as he said this, so he clearly thought that was the case as well.
Michael Ogbeide had arrived before they had and was sitting in the room with Lestrade.  When he saw John and Sherlock walk into the room he stood up and offered his hand.  “You must be Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,” he said, in a cultured tone with only a hint of his native language behind it.  He was about John’s size, but leaner, with skin the color of dark chocolate.
"A little less than half a year.  She came in late November and left at the end of May."
"Everything."
"He's only just sixteen.  Rent boy.  Been on the streets for God knows how long.  He got brought in for solicitation and he said if we'd let him go he'd talk to us about K.  He'd seen the headlines.  Apparently he had her for a customer for a few years, from ten to thirteen." Lestrade has returned to a more businesslike tone.  "He was still living at home for some of that time.  Alcohol and drugs galore, and lots of neglect.  A bunch of addicts in the same house and he wasn't ever sure who his father was.  He said running away was the best thing he ever did.  I believe him.  No missing report was ever filed for him."
"What were you planning to do on the street?" John forced himself to ask, although he already expected the answer.
Victor shook his head.  "Not that.  I started to think about what his life had to be like if his mother spoke to him like that in public, and it seemed like the only person who liked him was away at university."
John was out of ideas at this point.  "I can't think of anything else."
"I hope your conversation with my brother was enlightening," he said without preamble.
"Are you going out this evening?" John asked.
This was enough for Martin to look away; he didn't faint at the sight of blood like Douglas did (something he was under obligation to never reveal) but being stuck with a needle was never fun.  Fortunately, Molly stuck him and drew the blood quickly and efficiently.  "I'll have the results tomorrow," she said when she was done.  "I'll ring you with them and if anything is really odd I'll ask you to come in."
"You've interfered enough.  Go away."
"Tell me about the mystery tenant," Susan said.
As he headed upstairs to the place called Martin's room, Sherlock realized now he had severly underestimated how easy this was going to be.
"No.  It is merely an observation."  He hadn't moved once since the conversation had begun.
"People want to know whether I'm in a relationship with you.  Just saying 'no' wouldn't end those questions, but if I imply I'd never be interested at all it ends things.  And it means you don't have to answer any questions."  He paused.  "You don't like to talk about sex or relationships with other people, at least not if it relates to you."
“John.”
"Before I could.  Think I could make it up to Her somehow," Sherlock replied in a staccato voice.
"She's the one," John said right away.  "She might have not said anything to the police, but she and Sherlock exchanged words."
"I'm aware of that.  What's your point?"
"And you told this stranger that you needed money for drugs."
"I divide my time between London and Bangalore.  I'm currently the head of a small firm that is devoted to tablet technology and a selection of peripheral wireless components.  My parents are both retired and also divide their time between the two countries, although they live in a country village when in the United Kingdom."
"At first it seemed really nice.  She'd always have stuff for me to color and draw with and She'd give me biscuits and lemonade.  I got to sit in Her lap and She'd touch me like She did before.  For the first few times that was all She did.  After that She asked me if I knew how to kiss someone, and I said I didn't.  I hadn't known how to hug someone before, either, and She'd taught me that.  Where the arms go and everything, since I couldn't figure it out."  It was hardly the worst thing Phillip had mentioned so far, but apparently it affected the audience; John heard a few gasps of horror.  "So She said She'd teach me that too."
The other man looked at him with a look that was both perplexed and long-suffering. "What?" he said.
Truthfully none of it made a difference to Sherlock.  "Whichever you like."
"She didn't refuse to talk to them.  She just said she didn't know who'd hurt her," Mr. Aherne corrected.
"I'll see you next Sunday, then," Dr. Dodson said as he walked to the door with John.
"What are their names?"
What John really wanted to ask him was what he'd been dreaming about, but he also knew that if he asked he'd be met at best with stony silence.  "Do you want to take a shower after you finish that?" he said instead.
"Tell me about that person."
"Yes, but you very obviously do not." John couldn't tell if it was a good sign or not that Sherlock was avoiding the implications their relationship was now a romantic one.
"Then why didn't you tell your father about it?"
"She walks our dog every day, and she sometimes goes to the little playground nearby. I know it's different in the city, but she's nine and she should have some freedom."
"You'll be staying home on Tuesday as well?"
And that is it.  It's finally done.
"I'm fine, thank you."
"No.  There rarely are.  These pictures were especially bad for that; lots of children doing sexual things to each other and some of children engaging in solo sexual activity, but only a few where there are adults you can see.  Even in those cases it's someone's back or side.  Nothing that can identify the person, never any distinguishing marks, much less a face."  Lestrade pointedly avoided looking at Sherlock.  "The images and videos found on the computer may be easier to track down.  We've requested assistance from a place in the States that specializes in online trafficking of minors."
"That's the easiest thing in the world."
. His last name, Rodgers, comes from yet another missing child, from the UK,
"Can you identify this woman who you saw?"
"For a few minutes.  Then she put both of her hands on my thighs and spread them, hard.  It hurt when she did it.  Then she started touching just my groin until I got an erection.  I tried to say something, at least, but my words were all slurred."
"So she thought that you liked it there."
Mr. Rodgers just nodded sadly.  They ate in silence.  After finishing they both left, and John felt glad that Mr. Rodgers walked off in the opposite direction of the courthouse.  He could only imagine the testimony getting worse.
"Nothing at all.  He's the one who came up to me and said he used to be Debra's supplier.  He even said normally he wouldn't do something like that, but he thought it was important for me to know."
“Several times, I think.  He’s still worried he’ll be arrested for something.  And I think he finds comfort in the fact someone knows what he’s going through.”  He followed Lestrade into the office, and sat down in a chair opposite Lestrade’s desk.
"Mycroft," Sherlock said, clearly angry.
"No, it didn't."
"Her mother?"  John stared at him in disbelief.  "If she's really testifying that she sold her daughter for drug money she'll be charged and will probably lose whatever parental rights she's got left."
"I can't let you boys leave without something to eat," Mrs. Murray told them.  "If you'll wait a minute I'll bring you some dinner."
"Just my daughter Jennifer."
"Unlikely."
he thought.
"Why didn't you say anything else?"  Sherlock said something that wasn't audible, and Harvey said: "Speak up."
"Did she do this a lot?"
"Coffee," John said.
"Regardless of who was responsible, you can see the effect on him. He really had no friends prior to you. You know about his past drug use and you have seen his neglect of his own well-being. I assume he is trying to bury the past with this case of the serial perpetrator." The car stopped at that point. "We are back at Baker Street now. I hope this conversation has been helpful."
"Could he have been the one that abused your daughter?  He invented the story to throw you off?"
"On the cheek."
"I decided to at least try."
"Not exactly, but thank you anyway." John dropped his wallet and keys on the table and sat down in the nearest chair.
"Where have you lived since then?"
"Sometimes.  But I've never asked them to leave the room unless the child requests it.  Usually I explain what I'm doing and why.  It also helps if the parent is allowed to look away."  She looked right back at Clark, making it very clear she wasn't going to be intimidated by him.
"Did you tell your mother about this?"
"So we're going to go see the friendly cows and eat ice creams?"
"He doesn't pull on the lead.  He is very well-behaved.  I made sure of that before I let Moira walk him by herself."
"Texted him too."
"No, never."
"Did you hear from anyone else about Mrs. Bena's arrest?"
"I'd never hurt my children," Mr. Aherne said in horror.
"You said that you hadn't done that before.  That time was the first you resisted."
John visits Ella.
"You're mailing it?"  John pointed to the gift.
As soon as they were back home and in the sitting room, Sherlock flopped down on the sofa and wrapped himself around Hamish.  By now John had gotten used to the large stuffed toy accompanying Sherlock as he went around the flat.  He only occasionally did experiments now, but when he did Hamish was at his side, sitting on a stool of his own.  Every morning he came downstairs with the bee tucked under one arm, only putting him down when something required two hands.  In that event, Hamish would be placed on the sofa, and John knew better than to move the toy.  Most importantly, Hamish got brought up to bed every night.  Sherlock would wrap his arms around the bee and hug it to his chest.  Only then was John allowed to get in himself.
"And you never asked the woman what she and Jennifer were doing on those visits?"
"Monday."  He shrugged.  "She's done it before."
"Where does your family currently live?"
"Did you go back there?"
John stopped halfway in the process of bringing a piece of fish to his mouth.  "I suppose K must have some additional means of income to keep up a flat he doesn't actually live in, but where did all that come from?"
"What's gotten into you?" she asked him once they were sitting down. She pulled out a container of some kind of pasta and a banana and began to eat.
Sherlock could be heard to chuckle warmly. "Tell me what made you think I do."
"Yes.  I just told Mrs. Glenn all about that."
John writes a blog entry.
Sherlock wasn't in the same chair when John came downstairs in the morning, but he was pacing back and forth across the kitchen. He was wearing the same clothes he had been wearing yesterday, and the fact they didn't look particularly rumpled was probably because he hadn't got any sleep. When John said "Morning" to him, he actually responded with a "Morning" of his own, so that was a good sign.
In other notes, there should be updates to both No Final Solution and The Ball I Threw While Playing in the Park soon.
"How did that turn out?"
"Yes."
"No."  Phillip shook his head.  "He told me about a friend he had from school and he said he understood a lot of what I was feeling, but he never said anything about that person."
"One of these sandwiches has your name on it, in any event."  Lou handed him the wrapped sandwich.
"I, um, looked at Her."  He paused.  "Then She asked me if I'd ever seen a woman without clothes before.  I said no.  She said it was normal to be interested and I could look at Her all I wanted."
Sherlock answered before Mr. Rodgers could.  "Phillip, this is your father.  Bruce Rodgers."
“Nothing.  Of course when we got to A&E she was in hysterics and said she didn't want to see the doctor and wasn't sick.  The doctor that did talk to her seemed more interested in me than her.  Then someone from social services came and told me that she needed to go into care while this was all sorted out.  I had to call Debra, and she was furious at me, of course, but she didn't seem shocked by everything.  I didn't want to think then why that might be the case, and as far as I knew she wasn't seeing anyone.  After that I was questioned by the social workers and the police about my relationship with my daughter.”  The last sentence was still tinged with bitterness.  “Nothing came about from it, of course, and the carers for Jennifer didn't ever hear about her 'friend'.  In the middle of all that Debra was arrested for possession.  She still wasn't working.”
"Can I bring anything?"
"Once."
"Not needed," John said.
John jumped into the conversation. "Right now he's reading a book to his children. I think we should give them an hour or so together before we bother them again. He needs the quiet time." Trying to defuse the situation, he added, "Have you eaten already? Neither of us have, and getting a meal would be a good way to pass an hour or so." While Sherlock was probably uninterested in eating, it had been a long time since breakfast.
Sherlock looked down and clutched Hamish to his chest tighter as he began "When I was thirteen..." and proceeded to tell the story of Victor Trevor that he'd told to John all those months ago.
"Different.  Sometimes She'd say She loved me and She wished I was Her little girl.  She'd hug me and kiss me and all that, like me dad does.  Sometimes She'd say She knew She was special to me since She was my only friend and She'd give me gifts and sweets and stuff.  Other times She'd say that if I didn't do what She wanted She knew where I lived and could kill me dad if She wanted to.  A few times when She was nice to me She'd said She took kids in from care like me parents had been and if anything happened to me dad She'd be able to take care of me."  The short break had seemingly done a lot to calm Moira; she spoke with no hesitation or fear.
"I felt it would be useful. He would be able to fit any interviews in on his own time. He wants to be treated like an adult." Sherlock was back to sounding businesslike and detached.
"No, they're not."  Mrs. Bena gave her an irritated glance.
When the train arrived he knew he would have to get into the same carriage as Sherlock, and could figure out no way to make himself less noticeable.  However, Sherlock seemed so distracted that John figured that if he just chose one of the more unobtrusive seats he wouldn't be noticed, and he was right.  Sherlock spent the entire two hour trip staring blankly out a window.  John felt anxious, himself.  If they really were heading to the residence of the mysterious K, alias name Dana Lester, he wasn't sure what they would do.  Even he knew you couldn't arrest the man without some evidence, and someone appearing at his house and telling him they were on to him just provided an incentive to flee.  Maybe Phillip had included something that he could be arrested for, provided the Yarders showed up at the house?  Of course there was the charge about the flat, but could he really be detained for that in the same way for a more serious crime?
"Yes," she squeaked out.
Phillip put down his flute in his lap.  "A little while.  Your landlady gave me a muffin and a banana for breakfast, and Mr. Holmes let me have some milk."
Mr. Ogbeide swallowed visibly, and looked away from the both of them.  “That's – well, I'm not even sure where to begin.  It wasn't just one thing, you know.  It was a series of things.  In hindsight it all fits together but I wasn't able to make the connections at the time.”
"What's that?" John asked.
"Changed their minds."  From the way Sherlock said it it was hard to tell whether he was making a satisfied statement, asking a question, or just giving the facts.
"Good," John said as he turned on the coffee maker.  "You're going to drink some coffee."
"We're going to catch this K, Mr. Aherne, just so you know that," Lestrade said.
"What kind of drink was it?"
"He will be testifying after Moira and her family."
Sherlock tells John how it all began.
"Perhaps."  Sherlock shut his eyes, lay down on the sofa, and put his hands together.  He was obviously thinking about the case, so John knew he didn't need to try to get him out of it.
"I've seen it before myself," she said flatly.  "Do you know the story about how Sherlock and I met?"
The easiest way I could figure out to get Sherlock aware of the case was by John being aware of an abuse victim in the hospital. I invented several other details that never made it into the story, such as how the girl refused to say anything at all to the various social workers, police, and trained interviewers, so they go to a doctor the Yard is familiar with as a last-ditch thing. Obviously not standard protocol, but everything else I thought of was even less plausible.
"On the day that you took her to A&E, was there anything else going on at home, or was this an ordinary day?"  Harvey now stood directly in front of him, looking him square in the eye.
Sherlock's long monologue before this is very deliberately gender-neutral, in hopes of breaking John out of his assumptions. Lestrade is surprised to see him there, but is also relieved in a way - no one else is getting anywhere and maybe Sherlock can break the case. Like almost everyone else, he's very disturbed that the abuser has gotten away with it for so long and is willing to do anything to stop them.
For the first time Thomas looked down.  After a few moments of silence he said: "Yeah.  Once a month.  Make sure all my muscles and bones are in place."
"Yes.  But you're bringing it up for a reason.  Even if it's got nothing to do with what's been going on recently, you didn't just say that because you felt it needed to be said."  John thought it was strange that someone as intelligent as Sherlock would spend so much time talking in circles.  A thought occurred to him.  "Did Phillip call you today?"
"Did she ever do that again?"
"Little," Phillip said.  "I think it was a little after we first met.  I remember She had this blouse with flowers on it and I put my hand down it.  Then She grabbed my wrist and said you had to ask before you did something like that.  Because I hadn't She said She thought I couldn't control that part of me, and when I grew up I might attack people on the street.  If I wanted to learn control I'd have to go to Her any time I felt something like that so other people could be safe."  He paused.  "When I got older She called me that more and more.  She'd say I could barely wait for Her to take Her clothes off, and if I didn't learn some patience I'd be sent to jail.  Since I was doing so much with Her.  But She said She liked me so much She wouldn't tell them how bad I was so I could still be her friend.  If I didn't want to come with Her to the flat or anywhere else She would ask me if I wanted to grow up to be a psychopath."  Another pause.  While he was still leaning on Sherlock he had gone back to looking at his hands.  "You're right, I didn't know what that meant at first.  But eventually I figured it out.  That's why no one likes me."
"Did she have her clothes on?"
Martin's got some more surprises to deal with.
"I suppose. No new dramas. He hasn't gotten high in a while but I'm not betting that will continue. And an old friend has tried to contact him, but he doesn't want to speak to him."
"Just a few more questions. Does this person have a first or last name that begins with a K?"
Moira and Kieran Aherne testify.
“We'll go down to the station now,” he reassured him.  “Do you think you can walk that far?”  John had a horrible thought that Sherlock resembled a soldier after a violent battle.  Sherlock nodded but after a step or two fell.  Fortunately John grabbed him before he hit the ground.  “Put your arm around my shoulder,” he told him.  He was careful to keep Sherlock on the side of the uninjured shoulder.  “We're not far away.”
"Martin Crieff."
"All right."
"Did he tell you anything about this person?"
"What happened next?"
"Chinese," said Sherlock after a minute, though he didn't sound like he cared.
"But why keep it up even after she knows he's not going to talk?" John asked.
"What are their names?" John asked.
"Yes."
"He mentioned a nursery rhyme she'd say?"  John hadn't heard that before.
While he expected Sherlock would remain in his room the rest of the day and this would be one of those nights he would be sleeping upstairs, Sherlock actually emerged around supper time. He didn't say anything but he did drink a cup of tea and poke a bit at the remaing risotto. John didn't say anything, either, and felt almost glad that he wouldn't have to have the headline discussion. As soon as he was done eating, Sherlock went right back to his room, but didn't shut the door that time. When he decided to go to bed, he merely came into Sherlock's room and asked "Am I welcome?" Sherlock nodded slightly and he got in beside him.
K's mistake.  She most certainly was, but not from a long-standing home situation.
"In the margins of your schoolwork?"
"Not right now," Sherlock said.
Instead of looking for Lou and Susan like he had done before, John just went inside the courtroom right away.  Most of the buffalo had not arrived yet, and they trickled in in twos and threes for about fifteen minutes after John sat down.  When the prosecution finally came in, Lou raised his eyebrows at John before going to their table.  "Court rise!" came a second later, and Judge Foster sat down.
Mr. Aherne testifies.
"She started touching my penis.  She'd done that before but this time it started to get bigger.  It might have before but since I always had at least pants on I didn't see it.  After She did that for a bit She lay down on top of me.  She kissed me for a bit and then started to move around, pushing me into the mattress.  The whole time She had her arms around me.  She did that for a while and then made a grunting sound.  She stopped pushing me down but stayed on top of me.  I felt like I was being crushed.  She rolled off me after a little bit and stayed next to me.  We were still kissing. I had all this slimy stuff I could feel between my legs."
"Gene."
"I'll be right outside the door," John said before stepping into the hall.  He shut the door behind him.
"I'll come with you."  And while John thought he'd just lie there awake, Sherlock actually fell asleep before he did.  John hoped he wasn't going to lie there awake like the past two nights.  Thankfully, Sherlock's even breathing was enough to lull him into sleep.
Phillip laughed. "Sometimes. I mostly do my drawing at home. Sometimes I go to the park to do it, though."
"Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena," Sherlock confirmed.  "Brought here by her father.  You stated in your report that you felt her father was responsible."
Lestrade questions Mr. Aherne. John learns something new about Sherlock.
"Yeah," Moira said, her whole body going rigid.
She shook her head.  "No.  He'd been so reticent about the broken arm I doubted he'd talk about it.  So I just asked him what he'd been fighting about.  He said, 'I just made someone upset.'  I asked him then if it was true that he was sexually active and he said it was.  I didn't want to push him so I didn't try to make conversation as I sent him to get an X-ray, gave him a shot of painkiller, and got a cast on him.  While I was waiting for the last of the paper work to be done I said, 'Who are you sexually active with?'  He said, 'I don't know,' and of course I knew that was rubbish but I didn't call him out on it.  Then I said, 'Has he hurt anyone else besides you?' as casually as I could.  It worked; he said, 'I'm just one of a hundred' before he could think about what I had said."
"Moira and her brother both did very well on the stand," John said as he walked to the refrigerator.  He opened it and rummaged for something he could heat up for supper.  Finding a carton of leftover Indian food, he stuck it in the microwave.  "Mr. Aherne did well too; you could tell that the defense wasn't getting what they wanted out of him."
"Eight, I think."
"Did you do anything about this?"
There was tea, and he sipped it, not looking at John at all. Drinks always seemed less horrible than food, smoother and thinner. If he drank enough tea maybe John wouldn't notice him not eating. No, he was still preoccupied by something. He'd been to his group, so maybe something had happened there. Ordinarily Sherlock knew he could have figured more out, but right now he wanted to get away from the food on the table, and if John kept thinking about something else it would be helpful for that. He made himself eat a few bites of the risotto, had a full cup of tea, and then fled the table.
"Yes," Victor said slowly.
"Did you bring this up with her?"
"Just don't go far," Mr. Aherne added.  The three children then left the office.  "What do you want to ask me?" he said as he turned to face Lestrade.
“No.  Three or four.  One may have legitimately gotten the money from their relative.”
John wisely didn't push the issue.
"Yes," said Martin, feeling dread even as he did. Carolyn was the type who would ignore the weirdness of the situation and just be upset that whoever was in his body now didn't know how to fly a plane. Before he could dwell on this, John placed a mobile in his hand. Still feeling dread but knowing he couldn't put it off, he dialed Carolyn's number. Instead of ringing, it emitted a shrill noise and told him that the number was no longer in service. He ended the call and rang the number again. The same thing happened. Now even more worried, he wondered who to call instead. Douglas had left his mobile at home and Arthur had a bad habit of not charging his. Could he call Herc? Martin knew Carolyn's landline number, but he had never used it before. Herc might not even be at the house in the first place. He dialed it anyway. This time the mobile rang twice before he heard a sleepy "Hello?" Unfortunately it wasn't anyone he recognized, and certainly wasn't Herc.
"Married to his work?" John carefully said.  Sherlock nodded in response, and if John didn't know better he would think that Sherlock was close to tears.  "Not if we find him," he said firmly.  "And I'll do everything I can to help."  He had no idea if what he said was comforting to Sherlock or not, as he merely nodded again and slipped silently into his room.  John swallowed the lump in his throat and went upstairs to bed.
"And with that I'm going to see if I can get a few more hours of sleep myself," John told him.  He went back upstairs and was able to fall asleep again in a few minutes.
"No.  I think she liked not having me underfoot.  She's always working."  Phillip sat up a little straighter.
"His brother told me."
Sherlock’s arm brushed against Hamish and his eyes lost that glazed look.  “What?” he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep.
“She was not part of it.”
Douglas didn't take the jacket.  Instead he said:  "I'm going to ask you a few questions, then.    The cockpit voice recorder records for what minimum period of time?"
"Is this your boyfriend?" K went on in a cheerful voice.  "I wouldn't have suspected that, you know.  You were always so enthusiastic.  Was it just that no other woman could compare?"
He suddenly stopped struggling, arms and legs going limp.  It didn't look like he'd come out of it, as he was still saying under his breath, "Stop stop stop stop stop..."
"I try," Phillip said in a whisper.
"He likes it," John confirmed.
"Yeah, because you know. So you can say it."
"Is that how often you usually see a doctor for your PT?"
Mrs. Hudson put a plate of biscuits down in front of him, then sat in another chair.  "Would she have gotten life for a conviction?  I'm afraid I'm not that up on the specifics of sentencing."
"I said what if I told the doctor there what happened.  You know, that She'd done it and what happened after.  But She just laughed and said She'd say She'd been fighting me off and who would they believe, me or Her?  And I knew that She was right and if I hadn't been so greedy I wouldn't have gotten hurt."  Phillip sounded resigned.  "I figured if they found out the truth I'd get arrested so I just told Her I'd say I'd been wrestling.  Then I shut my eyes again and we left the flat and She dropped me off at the front of Bart's."  He paused.  "Now you know the whole story."
"I see," Sherlock said in the same tight voice.
"Some of the time, yes. It's just a matter of knowing how to look."
"That's why he needs to come here," Jason concluded.
Well, he'd have to do it at some time.  "All right.  Just let me shut this down."  Martin shut down the laptop and followed John down the stairs.  He was almost afraid to step foot outside the flat - what if the sky was purple or giant lizards roamed the streets or any other thing that would make him focus on the fact he was in a strange place with no way to get back?  But there was nothing that struck him as being especially odd.  He hadn't spent a lot of time in London, unless you counted the airports, and so he had nothing to compare it with, but no obvious difference was somewhat reassuring.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed.  "You were talking to her about me."
Mrs. Hudson has words of wisdom for John.
"First of all, I didn't know that's how you felt.  If I had known at the time I wouldn't think it was funny."  John paused.  He hoped that Sherlock would have made some response, but when he got none he went on.  "Second, I wasn't thinking about 'how good you had it,' as you said.  There's a world of difference between what happened to you and my own experience."
"At least you understand that."
"You weren't being greedy, Phillip.  It's not greedy to want affection."
“He can stay,” she replied as she clutched the bear tighter to her.
With the satisfied smile still on his face, Lou said "No further questions." As Lou walked back to the stand, both Harvey and Clark came up to the judge's stand.  They exchanged a few words, looking back at Lou and Susan.  Lou turned around and went right back up, Susan following.  An usher led Victor off to one side while the solicitors talked to the judge.  John couldn't hear any of it, but from the facial expressions and the hand gestures, something significant was going on.
"Where else did you meet?"
“For me to do it!” Sherlock firmly replied.
"Not quite yet," Graham said.  He took a seat.  "Is Gloria allowed to be in here?  If not, is there a place she can wait with Angus?"  John assumed Angus was the infant in her arms.  He was almond-colored like his mother, but had faint wisps of blond hair on his head.
"No, I didn't.  Why would you think that?"  John couldn't figure out what the connection between the two was.
“K would give it to him?” Sherlock broke in.
"What's your name?" she suddenly asked.
MJN realizes something's up.
"Do you know why he went to talk to her?"
"J-E-A-N or G-E-N-E?"
"It's not nearly as exciting in person," Sherlock said.  "You won't be there for the whole trial, though.  Just when you testify.  Do you know what that's going to be like?"
"Nothing at first.  I sat down on her bed  and said that whatever she'd seen had frightened her a lot, and I'd like it if she could say something.  But she didn't talk until I mentioned the woman on the telly was in jail now."
John headed out and picked up the mobile on the third ring. "John? It's Lou George. I'm usually not in the office on Sundays, but can you stop by? It's important."
"Your dad is all your family? Besides your brother and sister, I mean."
"I've gone to a few computer places to see if they can retrieve anything off it.  But all they have gotten so far is strange error messages.  That more than anything else makes me think something is on it.  If it was really empty, it'd just say so, right?"
"Sherlock more than me," John corrected.  "He would trust Sherlock with his life."
"What happened with the abuse case?"
"Probably," Sherlock responded.  If he'd really spent the night on the street, and high to boot, he most likely hadn't slept at all.  With no drugs to fuel him now, he was going to be especially fatigued.  Even now his eyes were starting to close.  By the time John had showered and dressed, he'd fallen asleep again.
"And because of that I don't think that there's anything you can do on your end here that would make you go back.  Sherlock was asleep too."
"I'll meet them there."
“Sherlock?” he said quietly.  If he could wake him up before it got too bad he might just fall back asleep and not even remember that he’d had a dream.  (He hoped that was the case and that Sherlock wasn’t just choosing to push it out of his head.)  He switched on a bedside light.
"Can I do that?" John said, more to himself than anyone in the group.
"I looked it up online, of course.  No one in this day and age shops for food far away from where they live if they can help it."
"I want to look online and to see if there is any available information on Mr.  Morstan or Mr. Forrester.  I also want to connect any stories from either India or the UK at significant times in their lives."
"If She wasn't there no one would be with me and I'd be all alone."
“That a parent who was unhappy with his sexual activity broke his arm?”
They hadn't had a case then, not in a week or so at least, but John truly just wanted to share a story he found disturbing. Child abuse was so mundane that he figured Sherlock wouldn't be interested even though the Yard was involved. But he was very interested, and angry. John knew that keeping him away from the hospital was a lost cause, so he simply asked to come along with him. (If he hadn't John suspected Sherlock would have snuck into the hospital himself, and the resulting clash between him and the Yard wasn't worth thinking about.) He expected to have to drag him away from the scared, traumatized girl, but not only had he been good with the child, she asked to see him again. And that time she talked about her abuser she referred to as K. And so did Sherlock. Not much, but enough to make John ring Mycroft to demand answers. Mycroft reluctantly gave them. He told a horribly truthful account of how he had noticed warning signs but wasn't able to do anything about them until his brother rang him one day with a request to come home. How he'd come home and his mother informed him Sherlock was telling "horrible lies" about a neighbor, not saying who was involved but clearly saying it was a sexual issue, and that Sherlock was going away to school for the first time. Mycroft had demanded to know who it was, but she refused to reveal it, and died a few months later. How Sherlock had claimed complete ignorance about whoever it was that he'd supposedly lied about. How he still regarded it as his biggest failure.
Was there a mystery involved anywhere?  He skimmed the next parts until he got to a particularly gruesome murder scene.  (Book-Lestrade was clearly not much like the one he knew; he wouldn't win any prizes for looks, but he certainly didn't look rat-faced.)  It wasn't until he got to the word "Rache" on the wall that it dawned on him this was essentially the same case as the woman in pink if it had been a hundred years earlier.  He skimmed straight down to the end to confirm it was indeed a cabbie.  The motivation couldn't have been the same at a time when divorce was rare, but when he went back up to see if a motive was given, Sherlock was treated to a long spiel about Mormons in the US he couldn't make himself finish.
John couldn't help but sigh.  "It's going to be hard on them."
"Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a British writer best known for his detective fiction featuring the character Sherlock Holmes..."
"Did he say anything about it himself?"  John doubted he had.  Dr. Arthur hadn't seemed like a particularly active reasoner.
"He won't talk.  I'm not sure it's really a 'won't' though.  He's too ashamed, more like."
John wasn't sure why it took him so long to make the connection.  Perhaps it was just because he had a different mental picture.  But the last bit of conversation hit him like a bus, and he suddenly, horribly, realized the truth.
"Then how were you able to get involved in this?"
"Did you bring him here? What possessed you to do that?" Lestrade was staring at John as if in shock.
John, Lestrade, and Mr. Aherne all sat down around the table. There were only three chairs, but Sherlock didn't look like he was going to sit down, and instead began to circle the path from the alcove to the room door. Lestrade put some papers down on the table. "I'll be taking notes." Mr. Aherne nodded. "Some of these are silly questions, but they're for the record."
He looked confused.  "Then how come you could pay off the bills on the house?  Didn't the will say all the money was just for MJN?"
Once he got up there, he gave himself a minute before pulling out his mobile and ringing the number Sherlock had texted him.  "Mr. Rodgers?  This is John Watson," he said as soon as someone picked up.
“That makes our job a lot easier,” said the other officer.  The two of them headed down the walkway themselves, and even from that distance K looked genuinely surprised.  The first officer said with no buildup, “Dr. Martin, I'm arresting you for fraud by obtaining lodgings and bank accounts with fraudulent identification.  You do not have to say anything...”
"Martin?"  He turned to see John standing behind him.  "I know this is still a bit of a shock for you, but I know a doctor who I'd like to have look you out.  A medical examiner, really, but she can be quiet about all this.  I doubt there's something physically different about you now, but it can't hurt."  Martin looked at the clock on the laptop and realized he'd been reading for more than an hour.
"Why not?"
John silently finished his and left without a word.  He slipped into the courtroom like he usually did and sat down waiting for the trial to begin.  As others filed in he noticed that several of the regular buffalo weren't there.  Apparently what had been said already had been too much for them.  He half-expected them to come in late, but when the courtroom was fully packed and the usher called the familiar "Court rise!" they had not arrived.
"I don't think She knew, but She always knew everything else about me, so She probably knew that too." Phillip took a deep breath and added: "She did know about the other bit. Except She said I wasn't really thinking about Her but the other kids that were sometimes there. It wasn't true, it wasn't, but She said it so many times. Like with all the things She said about how I'd hurt other people if She wasn't there, and I know I started it with Her and even if I didn't I kept going back."
Jason sighed before he began.  "We told our eldest daughter.  Yesterday."
"Why not?"
"Not in any significant way, I don't think."
"Of course."  He took the tube of wrapping paper and tore off a large section of it.  Despite not having measured it, it still fit the gift.
"She was a foster child of me and my husband two years ago."
"A few days after it had happened.  I got told at the time she admitted what she'd done and was just waiting on a sentence.  It was right after that that social services had a review of Jennifer's case and decided that it would be best to transition her care back to me.  Her mother's rights would be restricted or terminated.  I'll admit that was a relief; I don't know what I would have done if they'd said I couldn't see Jennifer any more."
He nodded.  "Initially yes, but when I was to start secondary school we moved to a town farther away that had a school with an excellent reputation.  There were of course public schools willing to accept me, but neither of my parents felt it was a good idea for me to be leaving home for long periods of time.  I wasn't too fond of the idea myself."  He smiled.
He turned to look John directly in the eye, as if to make sure he wasn't missing this. "When I left for university, I considered taking Sherlock with me. By now I knew the possible explanations. However, I deliberately refused to make the connection. My reasoning for wanting him to come with me was because I knew he was unhappy at home. Even if everything else in his life was perfect, we both knew that our mother was not concerned with us. She refused my request, however, and since I was not due to inherit any of my father's estate for three years I could not support him without her help." He took a deep breath. "And then when I was twenty-one, I got a call from my brother. All he told me was that his bee had been taken away and he was being sent away to school. He hadn't yet attended boarding school, which was less of a problem than you might think because our town had an excellent day school he could attend. I came home right away. My mother was furious at him. All she told me was that he was 'telling horrible lies' about a neighbor. This neighbor had apparently denied whatever Sherlock had told our mother, and that was enough for her to deem him a liar. I asked what he had said. I asked who the neighbor was. She refused to answer any of my questions. And she had taken away his bee. She burned it." John actually gasped at that, for what reason he didn't know. "I lost my temper at this point and in the row that ensued she told me that the lies were of a…lewd nature. Of course at this point that only made me angrier. I left vowing to never return. I did not. Then our mother died a few months later, and Sherlock decided that this was my fault. If I hadn't upset her she would still be alive. He claimed that losing the bee was unimportant, as he was too old for such a thing."
"Not then."
"Do you know how the insulation came to be installed there?"
"What happened after that?" Lou asked.  The courtroom was deadly silent.
"I'll bring her there, then."
"I was fourteen. Too old for something so childish." That sounded so rehearsed to John that he suspected that it was something Sherlock had heard repeatedly.
"Anything you can say to me you can say in front of Sherlock."
"Try it.  It can't hurt."
"At least fifty.  Several more if you count the ones we've taken for respite or for a few nights only."
Mr. Rodgers took a step closer and held out the frog.  "The last time you saw me, you left this at my flat.  I never got to give him back to you, and I knew you loved him so much..." He trailed off, choking back a sob.
"I wanted to.  I just didn't want to get arrested or get anyone in trouble."
“Yeah.”
"Do you think you've committed some sort of crime?"
"You do everything for them?"
Another very long silence.  Sherlock finally managed to come up with "She said that as soon as I was eighteen we could do that if I liked.  She said you had to be that old to get married.  But if I wanted to now we could start acting like married people did."
"I asked him if he'd mentioned it to his mother, and he said no.  I said then I thought he should tell her about it.  Looking back that was an incredibly stupid thing to say, but I thought if she knew about it she'd put a stop to it.  I was thinking more about my mother than his in that situation, I'm afraid.  He made some excuse and said he was going home, although I think he was really going to that woman's house."
"I suppose that means you've had the sex talk with your older children?" John said. He wasn't sure if he was allowed to say anything, but he hadn't been ordered to leave, so he might as well try to help.
"I'm Dr. Watson."
Mr. Rodgers looked pleased he had remembered that much.  "We'd eat together there and go to the zoo.  You loved the frogs the most."
"I'll ring them up then."  John ordered the food, they ate, watched crap telly that wasn't the news, and went to bed without any discussion of what would come the next day.  He couldn't help but notice that Sherlock kept as far away from him as he could, and that he clutched Hamish to his chest in a death grip.
Out of all the things Sherlock could have said to him, that was one of the least expected.  He turned to face Sherlock and from the look on his face John knew his expression was fierce.  "What?" he said in complete disbelief.
"Anyone who knew them from before they were taken into care say they had behavior problems?"  John asked.
"I don't know."
The woman raised her hands in a gesture of silence. "It is my plane and no one is sleeping on it at all. Douglas, take him back home and lock him in the basement for all I care. We can do problem solving tomorrow."
"He plays the flute, you know," John told him.
"Did you say anything to Jennifer about the visits?"
"John, this is Eli, Peter, Mari, Tammy, Jason, and Rodney," Gloria said, gesturing to each one in turn. "Have a seat." She sat down in one of the vacant chairs. John settled himself down into the one chair no one sat on either side of.
"Our steward."
"Well, I try to make the lives of the people living here easier," Mrs. Murray told him, and John wasn't sure if she hadn't caught his meaning or had but was choosing to ignore it.
Once he got upstairs and into the flat, he noticed Sherlock standing in the hall between his room and the sitting room. His hair was wet, like he'd just taken a shower, and he looked guilty. "Hi," Sherlock said to him in an unnaturally flat voice. He quickly retreated back to his room, and shut the door firmly behind him. John sighed and sat down in the nearest chair. It was going to be one of those days.
"I'm aware of that.  I'm also aware that you met Her at work.  Presumably you met Her there."
"Is he eating solid food?" Lou asked Gloria, pointing to Angus.  He gave everyone a croissant sandwich and a doughnut.  Dominic pushed the sandwich over to Martin, but kept the doughnut.
Phillip nodded.  "Yeah.  A few times.  The last time I did She said She was just about to go back home and I could come with Her if I kept my eyes shut.  I went out with Her to Her car and shut my eyes until we were in Her flat.  She got me some biscuits and a glass of orange squash.  I ate that and She said we should probably ring my mum, since she'd want to know where I was.  I knew she wouldn't care, but I let Her anyway.  She rang Mum and told her that She'd found me outside and took me back to Her flat and I was behaving myself.  I don't know what Mum said to Her, but when She hung up She said She just had to bring me back for dinner."
"Victim One's probably going to testify for most of the day.  The doctor who treated him for the broken arm he had is the only other witness directly related to the case.  She'll likely be fit in tomorrow.  Victim One's a bit of a hard sell anyway."
"Lestrade rang while you were asleep."
This bit is all Sherlock needs to rule out Mr. Aherne as the abuser, for all the reasons he details later. This doesn't make things easier - in fact, he now knows it's going to be harder.  If he had been the abuser, he might have been able to get a confession, but since he is not there's clearly a greater threat over Moira's head than the loss of love from her father. At this point he knows that he shouldn't even allude to the abuse at all and just get to know her.
“Early on February twenty-six, you gave Mr. Holmes a piece of paper.  Can you tell me about that?”
Sherlock visibly tensed.  "Some things."
"All right, let's get started," Dr. Dodson said. "Does anyone have anything they want to bring up first?" After a few shakes of the head, he said: "Very well, let's go around the group. Eli?"
"If no victim talks there aren't going to be any, obviously." John turned in the chair and, with a sinking feeling, spotted that "happy day, I have a case now!" look in Sherlock's eyes. "And no, they're not going to call you. So don't start thinking about it."
"You'll be there?"
When he was finally back and opening the front door he was surprised to see Phillip Rodgers standing in the hall.  "Did you come to see us?" he asked.
As soon as John got out of the cab and into 221B, he paused to take a few deep breaths and collect himself. It wasn't that he'd never seen this sort of thing before; child abuse was depressingly common, no matter where you chose to work. You got accustomed to it. But you never could get used to it. At least, he didn't. With most medical matters, you eventually learned to turn off horror and just work on whatever it was. He'd seen children who had been badly hurt in accidents, children with fatal diseases, infants with cot death. He'd been in the army, for Christ's sake; he'd had seen people blown up on the battlefield! So why was this the one thing he couldn't stop being horrified about? Maybe it was because it wasn't a matter of sheer chance. Most illnesses struck at random, like being hit by lightning. There was no way of predicting it, or anything one could do differently. But something like this only happened because someone had wanted it to.
I knew that the child mentioned was Jennifer and that the doctor that thought her father had done it was also going to come up later, for a variety of reasons.
"What happened then?"
"Do you know what Dr. Martin said to your mother?"  In contrast, Harvey's constant use of K's formal title called up the very image of respectability.
“I’m going to show you some photographs.”  Lou produced a thick pile of them.  “Do you recognize where this was taken?”  He held one up so Phillip could see it.
He handed John a business card.  "That has my mobile number on it.  Please give me a ring to tell me how this all comes down; I'm going to Bangalore tomorrow for a few months.  I'm not going to be shocked if Sherlock never wants to see me again, but I am concerned about him."
"Are you sure he was referring to sexual abuse in his remark?" Of course Sherlock would ask that. He had said a few days ago people always assume, and it was apparent that he was trying not to.
She was right, and he knew it.  He nodded to show he understood, and continues.  "Anyway, he's also told me that he masturbates thinking of her abusing him.  I don't know if this was in the past or not, but recently he's had wet dreams about her, including the nightmare with the flashback I saw.  He's thrown out piles of bedsheets from it.  Once he even slashed them up with a knife."
"Is this woman present in court now?"
Unlike their brother, they gave the distinct impression of living rough.  The one woman, Christine, was at least somewhat put together; her blouse and skirt had clearly been worn for a few days, but her hair was combed and she looked as if she had recently bathed.  The man who sat to the left of Graham wore an ancient blue jumper that covered several other shirts and jeans that were too big for him, even with the legs turned up and a belt tightened as far as it could go.  His hair was short but crudely cut, like he had taken scissors or a knife to it himself, and his skin bore several weeks worth of dirt.  He slumped so far in the chair as to be lying on it with his legs angled to the ground.  The man to the right of Graham had wrapped himself into a long coat and scarf.  He wore gloves and had a ski cap clutched in his hands.  His hair was long, tangled, and matted.
"But it's the modern day. Is this 2015?" It was the only thing that came to mind.
"I have time."
While John could hear that the two of them were arguing inside the office, he couldn't make out any of the words.  He leaned against the wall, eyes shut, and was only brought out of that state when he heard someone say:  "I haven't seen you around here in a while."
"Almost eleven."
"It is a case," Lestrade told him, and when John looked at him with surprise he added: "Not one we're involving Sherlock in, at least not yet. Sensitive subject matter."
"Well, hopefully it won't be for more than a week."
“It’s okay if you stay.  And you can put the recorder on,” she said firmly in reply.
"I didn't think about it until my father asked me that.  I'd seen his mother be horrible to him, but I didn't think that was quite what my father had meant."  The microphone made his soft sigh audible.
When he came downstairs he was expecting to be alone, and was shocked into slightly more wakefulness by the sight of Sherlock curled up in a chair.  He had thrown his dressing gown over whatever it was he was wearing and was talking to someone on his mobile.  “Were they covered with blinds or just shades?”  The person on the phone must have responded, because he nodded.  “Now, you said it was a ground floor flat?  All right.  Do you think you were still in London?”  Sherlock must have just noticed him, because he made a “go away” gesture with one hand.  John retreated to the kitchen and started the coffee maker.  Fifteen minutes and two cups of coffee later, the world had come back into focus and he chanced looking into the sitting room.  Sherlock was still curled up in the chair, but he was no longer on the phone.
"Only when I've counted them out, you know that. I always bake more than people ask for, so there should be plenty left." He smiled as he led them into the adjacent kitchen. Racks of cooling biscuits littered the counter and a large stand mixer was running at full power.
"K is easily able to reach the Aherne's flat at night despite not living in the area.  If K worked a normal day shift position there would be a risk of being seen in the area before nightfall.  K keeps the second flat well maintained but can't be seen there too often.  Therefore K either brings victims there before the day shift ends, so adults are not at home to witness them but children are already out of school, or after the swing shift is over.  Phillip, and presumably several other victims, come from homes where they would not be missed in those hours; distant or abusive parents, and single parents who work night shifts.  They are the ones who will spend the night at the flat, and of course all of them appreciate the closeness that results.  Moira would be missed if she vanished and as a result K decided entering the flat through the window at night would be safer. K's furniture in the other flat is minimal but well-made.  Oak, not quite antique but older items of high quality.  K must have no sentimental attachment to them since K doesn't feel the need to keep them in residence.  They are obviously discards from a collection of furniture, likely from K's parents.  If K's parents no longer need them, they are presumably not alive, and if they were wealthy enough to buy these pieces when alive K would have inherited a significant amount of money on their deaths."  He stopped for a moment and looked out the window, one hand turning white-knuckled on the folder as he grasped it.
"How'd that go?" Mari asked.
Gloria was in front of the building, just like she said she would be. "Good to see you," she told him.
"I thought you weren't seeing her anymore?"
"Yes."
"You're good with your patients," Lestrade said. "We'd like to take you to the ward and talk to the girl. If she talks it would be a big help. And you're the only doctor on the staff we've worked with in a criminal context."
Brothers, drinks, and disaster.
"Said to come back tomorrow. Said, 'I want us to be friends.' Said, 'I like dogs too.' If I came back there'd be a surprise."
"What happened when he did regain custody of Jennifer?"
"Yeah." His voice was low, almost inaudible again.
"Who are Jane and Frank?"
"No."
"And you never got it back?" She sounded sad herself, but John reminded himself that a child would of course mourn the loss of a toy, or even the idea of losing one.
"I ask because some professionals say that even one instance of sexual abuse in childhood is enough to require treatment while others say treatment is only needed for more prolonged abuse."  She didn't seem to be afraid of the ominous-sounding phrase "sexual abuse" like he was.  "But I think any professional would agree that ten years of abuse with corresponding PTSD needs to be treated."
"But didn't Phillip say he would be driven a long way when he went with this K?" Lestrade broke in.
"See, this is the page with the bee. It's got a picture they took with a microscope."
Harvey went to the front shortly after and said, "The defense will now cross-examine Phillip Rodgers."  Phillip was escorted again to the witness stand.  He looked worse than he had on Friday; he was so pale he resembled a ghost.  John could relate to how he felt.
"Brownie."
Thankfully, John came back into the room with a stethoscope and ended the awkward attempt at conversation.  "Got it," he said.
"Hello, Mrs. Bena," Susan began.
"What did she say about him?"
This was clearly going to be more complicated then he originally thought.
"Nothing happened to his friend, did it?" Jason said worriedly.
"Someone has to do it," she calmly replied.  "Doctor Watson, feel free to help yourself to the food."  She took two of the coffee cups and put one each in front of Lou and Lestrade.  "There's two more coffees and an extra cocoa if you'd like something to drink."
books!  And things to build an obstacle course for Snoopadoop!  And of course we can play Charades."
"Did anyone else say something like that?"
"The case has made things difficult," John said carefully.
Mrs. Murray gave him an annoyed look and said: "No, I said before there were several others.  They all left after a few months, though.  Dana Lester stayed and stayed."
When he walked into the familiar office, he saw it was unchanged from before.  That strangely comforted him; it was nice to see that some things didn't change.  "Dr. Watson?" his former therapist said as she came into the room.  "What brings you here?"  They walked into the other room, Ella giving him a look that clearly said:
"Hello, Moira, I'm Mr. Clark and I'm just going to ask you a few questions," he said in a falsely cheerful tone.
"Concerned over what?  It's not any of your business!"  There was a pinkish tinge to Sherlock's face, the most color John had ever seen in it.
"The landlady of the flat?  I met her once," John said.  By now they were in front of the room they had sat in in previous days.  They sat down and Lou extracted the bagel sandwiches from the bag.  He handed one to John.  "Thanks," he said as he took a bite.
John could tell that this was going to go bad very quickly, so he jumped in.  "Victim Twelve.  James Warren.  Tell us about him."
The voice on the other end sounded familiar, but John couldn’t place it.  “This is John Watson, right?” It sounded like a woman.
Sherlock didn't seem bothered by this.  "How is Agra written in Hindi?"
, he thought. He had once been so good at stopping his train of thought before getting to anything unpleasant.
"You're not angry with me?" The way he said it, combined with the stuffed toy he continued to be wrapped him around, made him seem like a scolded child.
"I went upstairs and woke up the children. I told them we had to go see the doctor. None of them seemed to like that, but they got up and went with me. After I got them all in the cab I first thought that it might not have been some sort of… accidental injury." He covered his eyes with one hand and choked back a sob. "That was something I didn't want to think about, so I didn't ask any of the children about it. We got to A&E and I told the woman at the desk I'd found blood on my daughter's underwear. A few doctors came and got them all and they all were given an exam. About ten minutes later one of the doctors came back to see me and she told me that Kieran and Dierdre were both apparently fine but Moira had some… lacerations." Tears were beginning to form in his eyes. "She told me that Moira would have to get a few stitches and I could be there when it was done. I went into the treatment room and Moira was upset; she told me they'd had to give her an injection to numb her up. I asked her if she knew how she'd got hurt and she told me she didn't know she'd been hurt. She cried when she was stitched up but she didn't say anything else. They had a few people who talked to her after that; Sergeant Donovan came in and there were some social workers. As far as I know, she said the same thing every time. After they talked to her I asked her again and she said she didn't know and she wanted to go home."
"I understand that, of course, but that doesn't mean I don't wish it could have gone otherwise."
"Let me go!  It hurts!  Let me go!"  Sherlock stared blankly into space as he struggled, like a sleepwalker.  "Please just stop!"
Just like Clark had been before, Harvey seemed surprised at his candid response.  "No further questions," she said, sounding like she thought the best thing to do was to cut her losses.
"What did she say?"
"She's brave," John commented as the Ahernes stepped out of sight.  "Being able to confront her abuser like that."  He pointedly did not look at Sherlock as he said it, although he was under no illusion that Sherlock had missed his meaning.
Unlike yesterday, the driver of the cab he hailed seemed content to drive along in silence, the radio not even turned on.  John welcomed the silence enough that he tipped the man more than he usually would.  He walked up the steps to the courthouse and when he got to the top the door swung open and Susan was there to greet him.  "John," she said cheerfully.  "You're here.  Lou should be coming with breakfast in a minute if you'd like to wait."
After a pause and a deep intake of breath, Mr. Aherne told the same story he'd told Sherlock that very night.  "You have to understand how angry I felt.  My daughter was being threatened with my death.  She was being attacked in her own bedroom.  The one place where she should feel safe!  I told the officers I'd sleep in her room with a knife if I had to and I meant it.  I considered moving to a hotel, but the expense would have been far too much.  In the end I just moved her bed to my room.  Some nights she'd crawl into bed with me and our dog would get up there with her.  I let her.  She had some very good reasons to want to be close to me.  I even started buying individual sugar packets.  I just... a child of that age shouldn't know so much about the evils of the world."  While he sounded angry when he explained his feelings, it had slowly drained out of him until he merely sounded sad.
"And when the investigation in this case began they called you?"
Whatever else Lestrade was going to say was lost, as at that moment Mr. Aherne walked into the room.  His face was unnaturally white and his eyes were reddened, but when he spoke his obvious distress didn't show.  "The bread's out of the oven and I'm going to start supper now.  Kieran, it's your job to peel the potatoes.  Moira, you'll peel the carrots.  The roast’s already in the oven."   Both of the children got up and passed by Lestrade as they went through the door, their father behind.  That was what seemed to snap Sherlock out of his reverie; he turned off the tape recorder that was still sitting on the bed, picked it up with his free hand, and headed out the door.
"Thank you for Moira's gift," he said before walking away with Dierdre trailing behind him.
"Do you know if they found anything else?"
While John would have taken that as a diversionary tactic most of the time, Sherlock sounded so tired from his brief conversation with his brother that he decided that would be for the best.  "All right."  He sat down next to him on the sofa again.  His hand brushed against the side of the bee.  "Does it have a name?" he asked.
"I was telling horrible lies." He was using the same flat, rehearsed tone that he had used when he said it before. "And I was fourteen and too old for such a childish thing."
"I suppose you'll want this," he said, taking the tape out and handing it to Lestrade.
By now they were at the door to their flat.  John opened it and they both went in.  "Sorry if I shouldn't have just come in.  Your landlady said it was all right to come up here," said a woman's voice from the inside.
Without a look backward she opened the closet door and pulled out a box slightly larger than a pillow.  She placed the box on the bed next to Sherlock.  "When I picked K out of the lineup, me dad took us for ice creams and there was a store nearby and he let us go inside.  I found this there and told me dad we had to get you it.  I'd saved up a lot of pocket money and I used that and me dad helped.  He didn't know if it was a good idea but I told him why I wanted to get it and he said that was okay." The words rushed out one after another.  Sherlock still hadn't touched the box, so she added, "Go on, open it."
"I kissed Her when She was on the table."
"All right."
"A few people come to one or two meetings and then vanish.  One of our more dedicated members, Edna, vanished a few years ago.  If anyone tries to ring her from the group she hangs up."
"No.  There didn't seem a point to it."
"It was really ordinary.  Moira and I had a bit of a row when she got home from school - she wanted to put on a dirty sweatsuit and I told her no.  She yelled that she hated me and stormed out the door with Rory.  When she came back she said she was sorry and that she didn't hate me, and I said I knew that.  Other than that it was typical."
"No one."
"But not in here."
"If a thirteen-year-old was indeed sexually active, would they admit it so readily?"
.  When he talked about his dire circumstances upon returning to London, it sounded just like John did when he related the circumstances he had been in before meeting Mike in the park.  In this version, they apparently met in a bar, and Mike was a dresser (whatever that was).
"Yes I did.  I asked her if she felt all right and asked again about school.  Bullies can be so vicious, especially with someone shy.  She said she just felt like being by herself."  He paused for a moment.  "There were... nightmares.  I should have known something was wrong when she woke up screaming and wouldn't tell me what was wrong.  She said she'd had a bad dream.  Even after her mother died I never heard anything like that."
"It was a while, but she was African, I think.  She had dark skin and dark hair in braids."  From Sherlock's brief glance towards John he knew that Sherlock was aware that could have been a description of Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena.  "She was really little, though.  Not even old enough for infants school yet.  Someone that little should be safe."
"I know that his brother came home and raised hell, but since Sherlock's mother didn't know who I was she never mentioned me and I suppose he never asked that woman.  Sherlock was sent off to a boarding school within the week.  His mother died a few months later, and right after that I read in the local paper that Dr. Martin had married someone in town and they'd moved to London.  I wondered which school Sherlock had been sent to, but after his mother died I never saw his brother again and I hadn't thought to ask him before."
"I don't choose what you would say in any particular situation."
"I think I will go back to sleep," Sherlock said after a minute or so of uncomfortable silence.
"No.  Last time I talked to her she was still sleeping with it.  Lots of people have some old toy they cherish."
"Well, if you're going to be that way about it, come up here.  We can do this together."  There was a quaver in Sherlock's voice, and John thought he looked paler than usual, almost ghostlike.  When the two of them were side by side, John put two fingers on his hand and found it icy to the touch.  Without really thinking about it, he took his hand.  Sherlock looked surprised at first, and then smiled wanly.  They walked the rest of the way to the house like that, silently.
Susan nodded.  "The jury will see him as he is now, and wonder what was going on that he didn't fight back.  And he also has to testify about what the defendant made him do to other children.  That won't be easy."
What Sherlock said made sense, but John still had a feeling that there was more to it than that.  "All right.  Just let me get my coat and wallet."
"Is there anything else you want to know?" Lestrade asked, obviously eager to take hold of the conversation again.  Moira shook her head.  "Then I'd like to talk to your father for a bit.  You three can wait outside in the hall."
"Yes.  I hadn't heard anything about that woman after she married."
"For one, she currently claims that he made 'advances' to her when he was fourteen and her refusal was what caused him to have so much anger towards her."  From the look on Lestrade's face he clearly wasn't eager to add anything, but he did say "Oh, and any pornography found in the house was planted by him at an earlier date.  She says it's yours."
