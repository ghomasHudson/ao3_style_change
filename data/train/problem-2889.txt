Born in a depot during year 1920, L’Utopia was then the dream of one François Joanis and his partner Clément Moreau. Both men were adamant that their establishment would be a symbol of art and progress, a place where all the intellectual elite from Paris could meet. It was therefore, during some years an establishment of some repute.
Castiel had become red on the face immediately and a severe frown had plastered itself on her expression.
“Ok, don’t wait for me tonight, I meet some friends, probably be home very late… I might sleep at someone else place.”
Today she was in a hurry, but she was hoping to have some free time before the first movie, just fifteen minutes would be enough. She texted Sam.
Benny used to say and yeah, she had found them. And if it meant staying up late with her odd friend eating a Greek while talking about some random show or anime or game Charlie was engrossed in? Well, it was worth it.
“I wanted to apologize.” Suddenly blurted the woman, and Dean was speechless anyway, so she didn’t answer that.
Castiel had deflated and her angry expression had turned rather gloomy. Dean had refused to feel guilty for that fact, the woman had been rude
“It’s strange, isn’t it? That your brother and mine know each other. I really wasn’t expecting to meet you here.” Dean engaged the conversation sometimes later.
“I hear you guys!” come the voice of Garth “and not my fault, I was in a rush to find a present for my…”
And this is how Dean formally met Castiel. One night, in a shabby apartment, not that different from her own, after climbing her balcony like frigging Romeo.
Of course, Dean didn’t know the cataclysm awaiting her that day and the consequences one meeting would have in her life and her sanity. She was just enjoying her day during springtime, unbothered and unknowing of what fate was planning for her.
With a happy sight she went for the main hall where a few visitors were already here, waiting to see
“If not, why the fuck are you here?” Dean almost shout. And then “Guess what? I don’t even care, whatever you went for? You’re not welcome here, so get out of here, you and your three hundred euros outfits.”
never forget Tessa, should I recall you who was the last one who let the lights on?” Dean answered, pointing not so subtly to their very own boss, lost in his thoughts watching two different versions of a movie poster.
That seemed to tickle Castiel’s curiosity for she asked immediately “But I thought you were studying in Paris and I thought it was the reason why you were working at the movie theater…”
. Students wore tight trousers and polo shirt or loose shirt. A lot of them had mussed hair and golden circle glasses. Women wore the bobo look, some of them having Dr Marteens and dresses, other very formal dresses.
“I knew it would be great… but seeing it on a giant screen hit different don’t you think?” Gabriel couldn’t keep in place, as per usual, and he was the first one exiting the room while Castiel was still gathering her belonging.
They had talked and Dean had discovered some odd personality traits in Castiel. She often asked Dean to repeat herself, seemingly to be sure she understood correctly what she was saying. She sometimes had difficulties to meet her eyes and when she was looking directly at her, she was focusing very hard on her face as if to read her whole facial’s expression. At first Dean thought it was unsettling, but she soon forgot about it.
“Well, like you probably noted, this shop isn’t really… I mean it’s…” The man had fallen silent. Ashamed?
Truth was… she didn’t. She didn’t have to. She had a tiny list of authors banished from the shop. Cheesy romantic ones, dangerous theological ones, bad criminal novelist… To be honest, the list wasn’t
If you were curious enough, you could find yourself wandering backstreets, narrowed and paved. Strolling along those streets could lead you to a peculiar part of Paris Latin Quarter. Parallel to the Boulevard Saint-Michel and near the Panthéon, you could have the chance to encounter a small establishment, now opened since 1925. But finding L’Utopia was
, the Garden and Saint Michel Quarter… A building here? It could be sold for at least 300 000 euros…
Castiel turned the lights on and immediately she saw Dean’s eyeing everything carefully. Her gaze following the mezzanine, the tiny kitchen below the beams and the living room with its old couch and worn rug.
Walking down the narrow streets that one night, still buzzed, cold and ashamed, Castiel had been thinking. The boots were strange. Heavy but supple on her feet. It was grounding as she was walking the cobble streets. The shop was dark and dusty, only the streetlights illuminating the bookshelves and the pillars. Her apartment too felt lonely. And when she lit her cigarette on her balcony, when the wind blew through her hair and caressed her ears, it felt like the street below was sharing its melancholy with hers.
One thing leading to another, Castiel had bought fifty percent of the bookshop but Chuck and her had a deal. In six years or so, she would buy the other fifty percents if the shop was doing well. Chuck wanted an out, he needed time for writing and he was dreaming of doing enough money with his books rather than with the shop. As for Castiel, she was satisfied to start something new and more than happy to work here, where nobody could find her.
“How could I forget Garth, not like you told me at least one hundred times that you were getting married next year” answered Dean with an affectionate smile.
three streets in the north… one of the biggest book sellers in Paris with the Fnac… Castiel didn’t like dust, chaos and acarids, three things this shop managed to gathered in one dark and packed room… But the obscure website had said
“I realize I deeply misjudged you, Dean Winchester.” She declared eventually and that made Dean self-conscious.
“What’s the problem with it?” she asked, feeling the material with her hand, her thumbs coming dusty.
But for now, she was just a stranger. A stranger working in a dusty bookstore, a stranger quite uneasy and a little bit dreamy.
Dean smiled. The Garden of Luxembourg was a quiet place inside Paris, and near Sam’s college and L’Utopia. It was huge, and a place well known for people wanting to spend a peaceful lunch when the weather permits it.
Brownish leaves spiraled on the ground as the wind blew. It was humid (as usual in Paris) but not cold, and if the benches were slightly damped, both Winchesters didn’t care.
“At least I don’t have anger issues.” Castiel retorted as she rose her chin high, and Dean would have made a snarky comment about pedantry and prejudice if Rowena had not exclaimed, seemingly entertained:
?” asked one of Gabriel’s peer. Brown hair, tall but lean and this charming nature typical of these kinds of social events.
And indeed, the woman was nowhere to be seen. Castiel looked around silently but she could not catch sight of any worn-out boots nor sandy hair.
And in a thunderous voice, filled with fury and rage “Putain! Fait chier!” echoing on the concrete walls.
. Nothing was never certain with him, always changing his mind, always taking three different paths at the same time…
It hasn’t been an easy decision to quit their hometown in the south of France. He had always enjoyed south’s weather and the atmosphere: friendly and cheerful. But even if Toulouse had a great college he couldn’t turn down La Sorbonne’s acceptance. He had been preparing himself to live alone for the first time in his life, mentally dreading the moment when Dean would take him to the train station. What he didn’t anticipate was the stubbornness of his big sister. And again, knowing her he
The bookshop was closed and Castiel had spent a large amount of time doing the account, worrying about the bills and the fact they couldn’t pay it…
She had to wait ten minutes before an answer came because of the metro. Phone service was a bitch and
She then wandered in the crowded hallway to find her brother and congratulated him again. She liked the movie very much, but she still thought Gabriel was better when he trod the boards. Wine helped her to feel comfortable enough and she soon find herself gathering with other people, happily chatting about the movies. She was careful not to state that she found the first one ridiculous, but she was adamant
The prospect of eating with Sam gave her some spirit before starting her errand and she tapped her fingers at the pace of the music wailing in her ears. La Sorbonne was one of the main public college in Paris, and thanks to the French system, higher education was free, well except for rent and food, but it was
Dean didn’t think she deserved it either… But shit, she almost threw the woman down the stairs and if the boots could prevent her to file a formal complaint… well she would give it to her.
thought Castiel and she suddenly felt uneasy. What did you say to a stranger you’ve been unfair to? But fortunately for her, Dean started the conversation.
“If there is a key… then there must be… a lock !” exclaimed one of the actor… Castiel cringed in her seat and decided to look at the program while waiting for the movie to end. Gabriel was hardly concealing his laughter and bumped Castiel’s arm every two minutes to make fun of the actors. Castiel saw that Gabriel’s movie
The projection room was dark and small, and its movie posters were reassuring. So, when she reached the top stairs and pushed opened the door, her heartbeat was erratic, Charlie’s jumpsuit was soaked, and she smelled like expensive champagne. Her skin and her hair were sticky. She felt miserable and so fucking angry. And of course, of fucking course, the bookseller had to be here. Had to witness it all. Not only had she been humiliated during the
“No! You don’t understand.” Chuck had stammered “It had been posted one year ago and you’re the very first person coming here to apply.”
“Oh yeah, it is, but today Tristan doesn’t work, so… hm, here I am.” The blue-eyed woman still stared at her insistently. “It’s a… it’s a pretty bookstore you have here” she started “never came here before, it’s well hidden.”
Dean could see all the nuances: pupils so thin it was just blue blue blue! Slivers of malachite. Dean wanted to bust them! To destroy them! To make them swelled with purple, red and greenish bruises. She wanted them to bleed.
A heavy sigh, Castiel could see her again, turning around, shoulders hunched. Ready to leave the street.
a chick. Gaby was a man, not that tall and with a malicious smile adorning his face. Dean was so unsettled she didn’t notice the person behind Gaby, still focused on his face that looked familiar to her but that she couldn’t quite place.
was a small bookstore with emerald green half-timbering. The sign was written in golden gothic cursive fading a little because of the weather and the window display was kind of dusty.
“What are you talking about Rowena, you’re probably the most charming one in this room, and I don’t even know your age because your keep refusing to tell me!”
Inside the box sat a very old and very dusty record player. One with a little leather handle for transportation, one you could open and close easily.
They were happy to have their little apartment looking like and old film exposition, even if it meant no having any place for plant or anything else.
She then had heard a loud bang coming from her right and she had turned. From a pile of books, dissimulated by the half-light and a wood beam had emerged the most pathetic person she had ever met.
The first one wasn’t starring Gabriel and the plot as the filming were quite poor according to Castiel.
, you know, the movie theater two blocks from here ?  I’m here to deliver the next month’s program. And your bookstore is on my list so…” She stood here for a few seconds, feeling out of place.
That’s how Castiel was greeted the night of Gabriel’s movie showing. She was a little surprised because she didn’t know at first that the event would be hosted at
“No… no it’s not that. I showed up two days ago, and the shop was already closed, just like tonight but I didn’t know you lived here.”
“I’m telling you, we should keep those, people like these books! Why would you want to get rid of what people like to read Castiel! We’re a bookshop! We’re sailing books, in case you had forgotten.”
, tonight we’re hosting a private event, do you have an invite? If so, I’ll ask you to purchase you ticket with my coworker at the register. She’ll take your invite and give you the program for tonight.”
“I’m not giving up anything Sam. Jo, Bobby? They won’t be dead. Just… eight hours from us, that’s all.”
The boots looked strange on the woman. It was a peculiar look: black skirt, black shirt, very classy, like all the guests tonight. It was odd and disharmonious, to have the protuberant boots poking out at the end of her legs. But at least, the woman could walk without falling again and maybe Dean could go to the bookshop in a few days to have them back.
“Now I invite you once again to find a seat and enjoy your night!” Finally, all the guests entered the room and the first movie soon started.
Dean looked closely at Castiel to see her reaction: she couldn’t conceal the redness that spread on her cheek, most likely from anger than embarrassment.
An employee came at that moment to offer a glass of wine that Castiel accepted easily and Balthazar went on.
The man was tiny and frail, Castiel couldn’t discern him through the crowd but his voice was cheerful. He went on for some time before concluding “And now, I’ll invite you to seat yourself in the first room for the very first of the three short movies you’ll see tonight.”
“Yes, you are, and I happen to know cockroaches quite well, I know for example that they love to eat and drink, so why don’t you follow me so I can give you a drink,
“I know it lacks nuance, but at the end of the day, judges have to declare someone guilty or innocent…” added Sam, uncertainty in his voice.
Until television happened. L’Utopia and its other fellow movie theaters slowly began to attract less and less visitors.
“Did you call me to praise yourself? If that’s the case you don’t need me to actually listen to your nonsenses, so I’ll hang up.”
“You should wear that green shirt Charlie bought you last week, it makes your eyes stand out. Oh, and those dark jeans, you know? The only ones that are not frayed.” She advised and a moment later she heard the bedroom’s door shut as her brother went to change.
Castiel didn’t stay behind to hear him complain. She went for the street and pull out her cigarette’s packs. Leaning on the sidewalk’s barrier she looked up the sky while her cigarette’s smoke spiraled in the air. Grey clouds hid the blue of the sky, but she was used to it. Paris was rainy most of the time. That’s why you could find all the Parisian, insensible to the cold, it seemed, rushed to the terraces when the sun deigned to show up for a little bit.
Castiel was suddenly perplex. Did Balthazar liked this movie so much he wanted to make movies of his own? She was a little disappointed … Basing on the short movie he directed, she thought Balthazar had …
The inside was probably larger than it seemed because of all the books, but the walls, the floor and even some stairs were covered with books. Ancients, dusty, faded books. All the shop smelling like mushrooms and dust and Castiel had sneezed loudly.
“Hi Castiel. I’m Dean” she had turned to face her, “But you already knew that, even if I don’t know how you learned my name.”
“So you live here?” Dean asked, looking past Castiel’s shoulder, inside the partially dark apartment. “That must be convenient, living above the place you work.”
Empty movie theaters were always strange and peaceful. Castiel did went to the bathroom before wandering the different hallways. She saw a partially opened door and was curious but the “Entry Forbidden” sign discourage her to climb the narrow concrete stairs leading upstairs… A worn out cat suddenly crossed her path as she was looking for an exit. Its ears were scarred and its tails was bent at the end in a strange angle. But it seemed healthy and friendly nonetheless. It came to rub against her ankle and Castiel gently scratched her ears and soon she could feel it purring against her hand. She vaguely wondered if having a cat in a movie theater was hygienic and asked herself if she needed to make it leave but she decided against it.
It was well past midnight when Dean came home, her bag full of stolen popcorn that she would have thrown away anyway. She also took a lollipop and some snickers for Sammy (that, she really didn’t have any right to take, but hey, if we don’t get found out, we don’t get caught).
Castiel needed stability, she needed to follow one path at a time. She needed to have an organized life, to plan and to compartmentalize everything.
“You might want to be careful sir, I’d rather not drop my tray.” The woman asked politely, but Zacharia suddenly faced her.
Even with his scholarship he wouldn’t be able to afford everything in Paris. This city was expensive! The first thing he did was sending his curriculum in order to find a job quickly. Then he started to search for a place to live. Finding roommates was the cheaper way but it was not that simple, especially for a broke student.
The woman was pointedly not meeting Castiel’s curious (ant quite inhibited) gaze, in fact, she wasn’t looking at anyone at all. She was just staring in front of her, holding her chin high. Castiel took a glass quietly, refusing to say a word but a quiet “Thank you.”
Dean didn’t know exactly how many friends Sammy had invited, he told her about a Jessica and a friend of her, about a Kevin and her girlfriend from the Politic Sciences Institute. And if she recalled well there also was a Gaby from the Beaux-Arts’ School, chicks from art school were always hot, even if a little bit in their own world. Dean had invited some friends too, Charlie, Tessa and Rowena, a regular from
She could now see the white of Zacharia’s teeth as he sneered. But all at once his grimace vanished, replaced by a smirk.
When she found the folder Garth let for her, it was 10:30. If she was efficient enough, she could eat with Sammy at 11:30 but she had to be organized. Thankfully Tristan had a map and a route ready for her to follow. She just had to deliver and be fast. It was an easy job, and one that allowed her to walk in the Latin Quarter, she couldn’t complain.
She wasn’t delusional. And even though Garth never said anything about her clothes, she was aware they weren’t always the most appropriate clothes to work with public. She was not planning on changing all her outfits. For different reasons.
“Dude, it’s awesome, you could totally fix it again and listen to old records. I know a place where you can find some!”
Deciding it was time for some provocation she cleared her voice and stated “I haven’t seen it until the end but from what I glimpse of the movie, I can say it wasn’t that an original concept. I mean, let’s be honest, it’s just the mirror of a verry old and very boring story that many people have already told. Some of you remember the Bible right? Nothing new here…” Sniggers echoed around them and Castiel hid her smile behind her glass.
Standing still, heart stammering like crazy, Dean tried to calm down and shut her eyes for a moment. Her head spinning a little.
“And why would I?” she barked, taking a step closer menacingly. “It’s so true that you gave me reasons to listen to your scornful mouth!”
and so Castiel, who had never worked a day in her secluded life, had found it. And she had immediately understood why the shop had difficulties keeping their employees…
She was deeply engulfed in interpretation theories when a voice rose from behind her “Would you like some drinks ladies, gents?”
Dean enjoyed this job, and she sometimes wished she owned the place. Don’t misunderstand her, Garth was a kind boss, and a person Dean could be proud to call a friend, but she wished she could have study harder in school. She dreamed of running her own place, choosing movies based on her whims and not those of Garth. L’Utopia was a place for people to dream in, and that was exactly what she usually did when hidden in her tiny projection room.
Dean hummed, meditative. “It’s a shame, if it worked you could sell this thing for a very good price.”
“Well, that’s why I’m here for you know!” She jumped from the guardrail and walked into Castiel’s living room without waiting for any further invitation.
. She found the different films rolls with the title written in faded cursives on it. She also took the external hard drive needed for the digital projectors and went back upstairs.
“I… You were right to feel angry. I wanted to apologize and inform you about the events in the hall… I think you should not go downstair right now, Zacharia is fuming and he will unleash on you if you go back…”
But she knew her damn job and she was good at it. She knew how to run the projectors, new ones and old ones. She knew how to look after all the film rolls. Knew not to bring anything inflammable where they were kept. She also knew how to work the register and she knew how to pet Mirza just like she liked to be pet.
“Ah, I’m the fortunate young man who wrote the plot and who directed the movie.” cheerfully answered the man.
“Well maybe I should talk with the owner of the place then”, blurted the man after some blessed minutes of peace. “Someone has to be reasonable in this library, after all…”
They had talked and even though the discussion had been awkward, the light frown on Castiel’s face, her dark hair and her controlled voice had been kind of pleasant. Besides, Dean was curious about the inked patterns she could glimpse on Castiel’s back, just above her top. She had not asked what they were about though.
Castiel frowned and was about to apologies when recollection seemed to hit the other woman. A sneer crossed her freckled face and she inhaled sharply “I remember you! You’re the douchebag from the bookshop!”
The anger Castiel saw in these eyes was probably announcing rudeness and vulgarity but against all odds (Castiel’s odds) what came next wasn’t “Asshole” nor “Dick”.
The girl signed something Dean didn’t understand but that made Sammy blushed when Sammy’s phone ringed suddenly.
“I’m really not but … yes, thank you for the boots, I’ll go.” She was leaving for good, but just before she went downstair the woman abruptly turned and watch her intently, still frowning, blue eyes searching.
There were few things that really annoyed Castiel in this world. First, public transportation, but she was confident nobody actually liked it. It was noisy, smelly and overwhelming. She hated the automatic voice reminding everyone the name of each station. She hated feeling pressed against other bodies. And she hated being underground. Unfortunately, Paris was a gruyere cheese, and it was easier to take the metro than to walk. This city was huge.
Some Paris' quarters such as the Latin Quarter, the Marais (the LGBTQ+ quarter), the 19th and 20th arrondissements can be qualified as "Bobo's quarters". I lived for some times in the 19th arrondissement and studied in the Latin Quarter.
Dean was curious. She took a sip from the mojito, only for culinary purpose of course, she needed to know if it lacked some mint or rum. It was perfect, but just to be sure, she tasted it a second time.
“I can see here the beginning of a well-favored friendship.” Said Rowena before excusing herself, leaving Dean and Castiel by themselves.
“Dean who is this young one? she looks splendid too.” finally asked Rowena and before Castiel could answer by herself Dean said:
So, public transportation she could deal with, she didn’t have a choice. Rude customers that questioned her carefully chosen decision in her (fifty precents) bookstore? She had a hard time remaining composed.
“Ah… that’s the only snag… The old man said it could work again, but he couldn’t keep it anymore. Too many memories associated to it. He said it wasn’t broken, but it just needed to be fixed.”
“God! Would you let me talk?” the bookseller started to seem annoyed, but Dean wasn’t having any of it.
They had talked a little more that night. After Dean had found the problem with the record player and thought about what she would need to fix it. Castiel didn’t have any tools here and Dean had wondered how the young woman had survived in her seedy apartment all that time.
“Well keep going, you’re doing well, as far as I can tell.” Dean had smiled “I should be going now. Maybe I’ll see you another day if you want me to fix your record player” and because Dean was a bitch, she added “Or the leak on your sink, my schedule is tight, but I can get you an appointment.”
Dean didn’t know it at the moment, but the sight of her walking that stairs to the main floor, her tattoos undulating on her skin, her dark hair swaying lightly as she climbed; that sight, such banal and ordinary, would follow her for years, in her dreams, in her nightmares, in her sleepless nights and reveries.
“Yours was by far the best one. You’re actually not bad at acting, though I did know that, I saw you in enough plays during all those years.”
“That is why I came here for in the first place…” The woman alternated from staring blankly at Dean to avert her eyes.
The apartment was cold tonight. After a quick shower she put on three layers of clothes to feel at ease before crashing on her couch. Her old computer wouldn’t work if it wasn’t connected to its charger, so she was very careful when she took it to pass some quality times on the internet. It was so old the screen was cracked (thanks to teenage Sammy’s clumsiness) and it was so loud one of their neighbors once banged in the wall… She didn’t care. Sammy had an almost brand new one. Dean bought it from Tessa which wasn’t using it anymore. Tessa had money, her work at
“Hey you’re smoking! You give me one?” That wasn’t the woman Castiel had met days ago. It wasn’t the rude and crude person who insulted her. It was a completely different one. One, Castiel thought, she could befriend with.
Castiel had some principles, implanted since her earliest childhood by a mother who was -is- very skilled in the delicate art of self-sufficiency and pride.
There was something almost sacred, she explained to Castiel, when she was disassembling and reassembling things. She liked to find the defect and try to fix it. It was her hobby when she lived in Toulouse.
The woman kept staring at her, tilting her head and frowning. “Yes I did.” She explained. But something seemed of.
Dean stared at the woman, taken aback by the fact she was effectively still holding her hand, but the woman too, was holding tight. She released the hand and looked at her whole body, searching for any injury, remembering the sickening
Dean stared at her, unimpressed. When she took another bite of her kebab she moaned even louder, assuring herself that her dick of a neighbor heard her loud and clear.
Dean felt it. The fury beginning to spill over. The frustration and the anxiety were suddenly too much, even for the reassuring smallness of the projection room. But the projection room had another good point: it was well insulated.
Zacharia blanched then turned red. “You probably misunderstood; I might say.” And he then proceeded to explain his work (again), but the harm had been done and no one was listening anymore.
“Hi! You’re Gaby? I’m Dean, Sam’s sister. Your face looks very familiar… We met before?” she added with a smile.
was kneeling down, reaching the bottom shelf. Dean saw her back first. Black jumpsuit, open-back. Dark hair falling on her neck. A glimpse of a tattoo coiling around her vertebrae and disappearing in her lower back. She was rummaging through DVD.
Gazing at this shop had been like looking at a rotting carcass: immediate disgust but also… undeniable attraction. For all her needs of stability, Castiel remained a curious person. That’s what made her pull the door and enter the shop.
And that’s why Garth was such a good boss. Garth was human, he had empathy, as reflected by the very old cat peacefully sleeping in the office… It was fascinating, how all those disparate elements could create such harmony and charm. The old wooden floor, the old chandeliers, the old red carpeting, the old cat and the old movie posters on the wall. That was part of L’Utopia’s character.
something you had to work for. And indeed, flanked by a very old and very solemn hausmannian building and a tiny, packed cabinet of curiosities, L’Utopia could go unnoticed for one pedestrian in a rush. But if you had a spirit adventurous enough and some time to pass, the movie theater L’Utopia was a place to look for.
“Yeah, it has been here for a while now. The precedent owner found it in a second-hand trade, but it never worked, actually…” she explained. “I tried to fix it once… but…I’m afraid I’m not qualified for this kind of job, unfortunately. So, it’s just decoration now.”
It had always upset her; how ready Chuck was to put anything and everything in his bookshop if it meant more customers. Castiel wasn’t like that. She enjoyed quality. She couldn’t stand when people were ready to prostitute their taste for a little bit of cash infusion.
Curious eyes watched her closely for a moment. Castiel felt like a peculiar kind of creature under Tristan’s gaze, even though he was the one kneeling on the floor.
, decided Dean, if the looks Sammy was giving her wasn’t enough to tell her everything she wanted to know, the way he talked about her was evident.
She was finally reaching the last shops she had to visit and if she was fast enough, she could have thirty minutes to eat before running the first movie. The old ally she found herself wandering in was quiet, which was strange considering it was near la Rue Soufflot leading to the Panthéon, La Sorbonne and the Garden. It was a charm Dean appreciated in Paris : you never knew when you were going to found a tiny street and its mystery.
Sure, Dean wasn’t your model movie theater employee. She wasn’t well educated like Tessa or Tristan. She wasn’t trying to enter the film industry nor trying to get to La Fémis! Hell! She hasn’t a full notebook of relations like Garth!
“I am. I have known your brother from a long time now. We first met at Le Thêatre de La Huchette some years ago. A friend of us wanted to put on a show,
, the psychologist had said when Gabriel was young and uncontrollable (not that he was less out of control now… but surely, he gained some control on himself).
Glancing at the building she saw an opened window and frowned. Did she forget to close it this morning? Living above the bookshop had some advantages, such as waking up at decent hours in the morning but it was also depressing sometimes. More often than not she spent her days in the same building… waking up, drinking coffee, morning cigarette, climbing downstair, working, lunch, working and then climbing upstairs … It could be a little boring if she was feeling low.
“Woah that’s cool!” she exclaimed abruptly and Castiel followed her gaze. She was now looking at the old record player sat on the coffee table.
“When the law isn’t fair you have to break it… that’s why we beheaded Louis XVI Sammy.” answered Dean, quite fond of his brother’s elation.
A loud laughter gave her a clue of where to find him. Surrounded by his friends, recalling a story involving a medical TV show Castiel didn’t know, here was Gabriel. When he spotted her he reached for her and kissed her cheeks two times, as per usual in Paris before introducing her to his friends.
“You better take care of this skin of yours Dean, youth is like a bird, it sat down on your shoulder for a second before it flew away. And you never see it again, barely its shadow sometimes…”
The place was lit in a deemed light and whispered small talks crossed the room. Tonight there would be no popcorn nor soda. People were dressed up and Castiel could pinpoint exactly who
Soon, everything was over, and she raised her eyes to look in front of her, where Zacharia was gaping (and dripping on the floor).
“Oh…” she seemed to reconsider the offer and finally answered “In that case, thank you. I don’t know if I deserve your kindness right now but… yes, thank you.”
is a classic for the narrative outline study, in literature, theater, opera and film. Anybody wanting to learn more about film would be wise to read it.” Answered Castiel without looking at the man, but she could feel annoyance in the corner of her eyes. She was great at this... scorn.
Because of the rage running through her veins, she couldn’t see how pallid the other woman was becoming. They were close now, still at the top of the stairs, staring at each other.
When she opened her eyes, her cigarette was half consumed, and she feared the moment when she would have to get back to her seat. She sighted heavily but jumped in surprise when a voice suddenly addressed her.
He lifted his head and smiled lightly as he kept gathering up shards of glasses. “Yes, I am. My name’s Tristan.”
“Actually, you spilled your drink because someone pushed you right, I saw it. It would be reasonable to ask for the waitress to pay for the dry-cleaning. After all, this  mess is her fault, and as I said, this suit is very expensive…” He paused, now glaring down at Castiel. “Where is she anyway? Did she run away?”
“Hello there!” he greeted cheerfully, and Dean regained control over her brain, well partially at least.
Dean recoiled. She didn’t appreciate being underestimated and neither did she appreciate the passive-aggressive manner seeping through the woman’s words.
“My apologies, I tripped over my own feet, I can be so clumsy sometimes…” Her voice might have seemed candid but her eyes, sharp and fierce, couldn’t lie.
climbing. Gripping the bump on the wall, taking hold of the decoration on the facade and in less than a minute she was on Castiel’s balcony, broad smile and messed hair.
“My friend got it at the flea market, but it seemed broken, even though the owner said it could work again.”
A minute later Chuck came back and Castiel peered at the box he carried. It was big and seemed heavy.
Composed, she said instead, all cold fury and feigned detachment “Well, for some people the value of something isn’t related to its price, right?” she didn’t smirk as she kept quoting Castiel “Unfortunately, nowadays you find less and less disinterested people. What a pity.” The woman angrily bent and picked the cat from the floor, gaining an outraged mewling from the scandalized pet.
“Nope, what you see here” she said, pointing at herself “is not student material, at all!” and she laughed self-deprecatingly.
The voice was familiar, and sure thing, when Castiel turned to she met the woman who delivered her the theater’s program a few days ago in the bookshop.
She sighed and began opening the box as she said, “It’s too big to fit in the shop, Chuck, you know it!” But when she inspected the content, she fell silent.
So who was it? The Jessica girl? Or her friend Dean had never heard of? Or the Gaby chick from art school?
“Do you want to know how I knew I wanted to be part of the movie industry?” suddenly asked Balthazar.
“That is not why I called. There will be a projection soon. Three short films including mine, I mean ours. I got some invitation for you. Will you be here? ”
“I’m not convinced, but I have to go now.” The pile of dusty books was still awaiting her. “But send me the address soon and I’ll be here.”
After she putted out her cigarette, she spent some time gazing down at the street. It wasn’t that late, and people were going home. A lot of students with leather bags and earbuds, dressed up middle aged men and women looking important, joggers, teens on scooters or skateboards, owners and their dogs barking and…
“So we’re good, we need to start sorting our things, I don’t want our new apartment to drown in garbage…”
She saw Dean stopped and raised her head to her voice, and then, their eyes met. She could spot confusion in Dean’s eyes as the woman recognized her, followed quickly by embarrassment. She cleared her throat as she balanced her weight on her heels, seemingly hesitant, so Castiel spoke first.
was soon hosting an event for a pretty obscure private film school. And she had been asked to be here to help… She was reluctant, she didn’t like film students, she had always found them rather conceited and Garth had asked her to help to serve during the after showing collation (she had the misfortune to tell Garth she had been a waitress for some time in Toulouse).
“Dude, I’m looking for roommates… This place looks good, but I can’t afford it and nobody would be willing to sleep in the living room.”
No one was speaking. And Dean started to feel uneasy. Her rage had exploded and now it was reduced to something else entirely. Shame for letting herself hurt somebody else.
Soon, champagne and wine freed the minds and the main hallway echoed in laughters and bustling talks.
when she put on the projector. Plus, she could enjoy free movies (and if she could rarely see one until the end, she didn’t complain).
“It could be… I found it here when I first bought the shop, in the cellar. I think it’s cute.” And Chuck struck her in the shin with the infamous duster. “Oh, and also, what about the shoes?” Chuck asked. “Not your usual style. Did someone forget them here?”
And, yes, looking at her shoes, Dean saw that one was missing a heel. The woman was standing awkwardly, one leg bent to balance herself.
“I’d kindly ask you to mind your own business and to not bother me anymore. Your mere presence is annoying enough.” Replied Castiel while inhaling her cigarette.
“Look, it’s awesome, we could put it here, or here… I don’t know, or maybe you’d like to have it in your apartment?” Castiel really doubted it but refrained to say anything.
Without hesitation, she opened the door and climbed the stairs silently. It was darker here, and colder than in the main hall. There was no carpeting, no wooden floor, no antique chandelier. And the moment she reached the last stairs, she heard a loud crash coming from the ajar door.
“Leave them here please. They belong to someone I know.” Castiel answered without looking, still engrossed in her task. But she was wondering if she needed to go back to the movie theater to give them back.
This last part was perhaps a deficit, as angel mates never did warn us of the way humans could fall out of love and even out of desire. The concept of “divorce” took us quite by surprise, even after watching the more advanced primates exchange partners for a variety of social and political reasons.
“Dean!” Castiel didn’t know his tone was going to be that angry, but he didn’t regret it. He stood up from the bed. “I’ve told you what happened.”
The evening progressed predictably from there. Later, when the men were asleep, Castiel found the first of what would be many issues of
In fact, the pride I felt got me through that first bit with pure obedience: I left him in that grave.
With a frown, Castiel wondered whether he included himself in that assessment. Then, with a deeper frown, he reminded himself he knew nothing. Believing he understood more than an angel could had gotten into trouble a dozen times, if not more. He knew nothing. He understood nothing. He wasn’t even a decent angel, let alone some sort of bridge between angel and human (his second-deepest, most ridiculous wish).
Dean looked up at me, sitting across from him, and rather decisively closed his laptop. Usually, this means he wants to discuss a serious issue regarding Sam, or more recently, Jack. I nodded in approval.
“I think I would like anything that made Dean or Castiel happy.” Jack considered his own words for a moment. “It’s dangerous to say I would like ‘anything,’ but Dean and Cass wouldn’t be happy with anything bad, so I think I can say ‘anything’ and be safe. So I think I would like anything that made them happy.”
I looked up at the stars and thought again of Melek and Vangelis, Thertarmiel and Govad, Chamuel and Reuel. Oddly, they brought me comfort, knowing that then angels had roared out their need for each other and been answered in kind.
“And I know the Shadow may be listening, but I want you to be happy, Cass. I want you and Dean and Sam to be happy.”
But of course I have made Dean my entire universe of sexuality. I never wanted to be with anyone before him, and I doubt my fixation will ever change to another.
When the idea first occurred to him, Sam had almost dismissed it. Happiness for a hunter? Good luck with that.
Dean snorted. “Last time we thought that . . .” He frowned to himself. “I dunno. Something horrible happened.”
So when they made it to the Bunker, Castiel drank a beer with the brothers and then made it to his room. He felt like a little reading, actually.
I confess I just frowned at him. Was he talking about sex? It seemed a crude way to refer to it for Dean.
Cass shook his head and put a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Sexual orientation is not a question of bigotry, Jack. Dean’s heterosexuality is central to his personal identity and not some personality flaw.”
Dean, like almost human males, has an abundance of sensory nerve endings in his puborectalis and anal region. It stands to reason that stimulation there, in the right circumstances, would bring him sexual pleasure
But instead of the violence he expected, the next moments gradually, firmly heated up the core of him, pressing against nerves that sang and begged for more. He could feel Cass’ dick slam into him all the ways down to his damn toes, and his toes had never been happier.
Dean had swapped his soul for Sam. Dean had been in Hell and come out sane. Dean was the Sword of Michael. Dean had led an angel to fall in order to save the world. Dean had survived a year in Purgatory. Dean had beaten the Mark of Cain. Dean had told God off to His face for being a dick. Dean had saved the world by talking that God and Amara into having a family reunion.
Dean reared back with another look of disbelief, then shuddered and came all over them both himself.
Jack refused to make eye contact. “I mean, I’ve read all the books, and some of them don’t really make it clear that Sam is much taller than you, and the way the books describe your bodies—”
“Yes, Dean?” I ran over the last few sentences of conversation. They were talking about adapting Jack’s ideas to Angel Radio. “I doubt the application itself would be difficult,” I said. “But considering the limited data inputs these days, I’m not sure how useful it would be. Still, I will pass along the information to Duma.”
Somehow, the same four people who were unable to breathe normally in the Bunker were fine in the car. It might have had something to do with Dean’s metal head concert, but there was also the lunch break where Sam and Dean got tacos while Jack talked about how it reminded him of Heaven. And for some reason they all laughed their asses off at a Texas billboard warning that the Theory of Evolution was the work of the Devil.
Dean looked slightly dubious, but stepped into the bathroom and shut the door. Castiel heard the rustle of clothing, and then liquid hitting the water in the toilet and nodded to Sam while Rowena pretended to look into her bag.
“Cass!” he shouted, and I soaked in the knowledge of that desperate tone even as I came, jumping into the whited-out pleasure of it all.
Dean watched the man, who was slumped just a bit in his posture yet exuded tremendous power, come closer while Bobby fired again.
With a sudden insight, Castiel realized the last time he’d “touched” his “harp” was right after the incident with killing the little female Nephilim, the girl who turned out to be the all-too-human daughter of Lily Sunder. Some part of him must have known even then that something was horribly wrong.
Dean Winchester is my friend, as is his brother Sam. Somehow, this angel with a “crack in his chassis,” this “top of the Christmas tree” failure, has become a pseudo-brother to two of the best humans ever born.
Dean the turned around to see Cass doing something he’d never seen him do before. The angel had backed up against the doorjamb of the open closet and was scratching his back against the sharp edge of the wood.
Castiel kept kissing while he stripped them both. Dean had to make an effort to see this body God had evidently custom-made with him in mind, which meant that he promptly had to concede God was a great tailor.
“I told you. I played for you, said I would always do whatever I could to save you, and said we’re family.”
Yet none of this quite prepared me for walking into the bunker’s kitchen and seeing a pair of wings on Dean Winchester’s back.
“Morning, Cass,” Dean said without turning around. “Can you believe there’s nothing really all that weird going on right now?”
God, that damn voice. It started with the breath against the back of his neck, then to the vibrations through his flesh down to his bones, and then it settled in the heavy heat filling his groin.
Castiel told himself later he really should have expected Sam’s eagerly curious look when he walked into the kitchen the next morning. Ignoring it didn’t work, neither did glaring at Dean.
Cass considered this a moment, looking down at the food in front of him with a mild distaste. “My grace responds to distress in many forms. I have sometimes healed you quickly. I may have done more than was visible at the time.”
“You’re my omega, Dean.” The words seemed to drip with pleasure, like honey. “I want to have you open your sweet pink lips and moan with the idea of having me in your mouth. I want you hard with the thought of it. I want to fuck your perfect face and have you beg me for more. I want you to lie there, not moving, not even breathing enough to choke on me, while I shove this ridiculous human organ I’ve borne without purpose for millennia inside your body and feel you come apart with pleasure.”
“She was a bright soul,” Cass said, then he frowned and looked behind Dean at a line of tall, broad-shouldered figures: a brown dog, Sonic the Hedgehog, a red fox, a white cat with pink ears, and a light brown rabbit carrying a tiny, open orange umbrella.
Sam backed up a step, then did that uncertain smile thing he did. “Let’s get you some coffee first,” he said, then swung around to get to the kitchen.
Their room was slightly better than the cheapest accommodations: a big circular window, a tidy white bathroom that included a short tub, a gray loveseat, a flat-screen TV on the wall over a small dresser, and a queen-sized bed with a white-and-blue bedspread. In a nod to technology, there were outlets under the TV, on the base of the lamp on the small nightstand next to the bed, right at the top of the sofa, and in the top of the dresser.
“Dean!” Jack called out as he entered the hall, then raced up to throw his arms around his father. “I’m so glad you’re awake.”
he is. I believe the universe, let alone his own brother, would be foolish to ask him to change such a fundamental aspect of himself.”
Dean, not killing me even as the Mark of Cain on his arm screamed at him with the strength of a thousand demons that I be put down like a dog.
Dean nodded and leaned in for a kiss, but I asked, “Do you remember when you were trying to live the life Sam wanted you to live with Lisa?”
No, the videos, all about twenty seconds long, were candles and smoke, poses and hands and his skin, runes and chanting, and more damn candles, like some sort of Wiccan Casa Erotica porn. Dean saw his face with his eyes wide open and glassy, his body often painted with makeup and more runes.
“It would have been understandable. Most unmated omegas your age have done so. Hope can be exhausting.”
Dean was on his third slice of “breakfast pie,” as the little sign had said. The crust was flakey, the custard warm but firm, and the bits of fruit and other things were delicious. He’d had to ignore the other “Deans” as he’d transferred the pieces from the buffet to his dish, but whatever. It was frickin’ awesome.
“Yes.” Castiel was back to his monotone. “We had relations, and then they released you. That was the end of the matter.”
“You’re beautiful,” the angel, if he were really an angel, growled. “I couldn’t get this close before. The scent of you.”
With a welcome joy, I remember that evening I watched the Pizza Man and the Babysitter. It took me some time, and an experimental kiss with Meg that I cannot regret, to realize what I had seen. The idea of slapping a partner’s rear was so odd at the time. But after April I know that during sexual arousal all stimulus can add to sensation.
I didn’t want Uriel to be there, or any other member of the garrison. Though I greatly rationalized it to myself at the time, I didn’t want any other angel to be there because I wanted to be there. Or, more honestly, if I couldn’t be there, no one else could.
And here I was, fantasizing about the mere outline of an eagle’s wings on a 100 percent preshrunk cotton men’s crewneck.
I watched Dean as he clawed out of that grave. I did try to speak to him at the gas station, and then later at the hotel, which was my mistake.
Dean watched as the hundreds of feathers in front of him raised up, fluttered slightly, and then settled back down. Castiel’s voice was tight, and Dean realized he’d seen the angel bristle in irritation.
“Let me have you, Dean,” the angel said, and the hunter almost came all over himself right there. “I’ve been waiting to be inside you since the Carboniferous Period.”
When they pulled up, Dean got out of the car, grabbed his bag out of the trunk, got hold of the key hidden under the weathered cowboy boot, and opened the door to the cabin. Cass followed with the grocery bags.
“Cass, if your need for some company is showing up as molting feathers, it makes sense that what would help molting birds would help you.”
He’d timed it well. John was off somewhere, Sammy was at Bobby’s, and Dean was supposed to be hunting some ghoul in Texas. He’d checked into a motel complete with photos of spurs and chaps, warned the front desk he was invoking heat privacy, and brought a suitcase half-filled with sex toys, pretty much all of them still in their blister packs.
Then there was Jack, asking not just questions about Castiel’s well-being, but also about what made for a romantic dinner, and how people typically met up, and whether online dates really were all serial killers, and was he old enough to start dating?
Madame Laveau waited until anticipation just tipped the scales over socialization and stood before the sigils making the performance area. Her timing, as always, was impeccable. Everyone fell silent and took their seats.
Dean made sure he didn’t say he felt like his ass had been introduced to a nuclear missile. “I feel like something is going on. How long have I—” He gestured.
“Angels resonate, which manifests in human terms as stringed instruments. Mine is a harp. Other angels have other instruments.”
But, whatever. So Dean comes into the bunker and strips off his clothes. I watch sweat go down his body.
“In this manifestation,” Cass said finally, “my wings represent the half-corporeal part of my angelic being. When we are in Heaven, angels are celestial beings of pure light. Our strength is measured by our vibrations throughout the cosmos. We can be anywhere, but we cannot be there—cannot manifest there. We cannot—I don’t know how to—”
Sam pulled up the pictures of the current entrants on laptop. “There’s three for each fandom, and for
The thrumming got a little stronger, and Castiel became more aware of the fact that he was truly here, looking at this discarded part of himself, and there was no one else around, no one to judge, no one to make snide comments about “top-of-the-Christmas-tree Castiel,” and no one to talk about how he had erred on a descending chromatic scale.
While he had spent his life, as Cass had said, pacifying himself with a faceless line of beta women, it was strong thighs and broad shoulders he pictured when he got himself off, stripping his cock and shoving a couple fingers up his semi-slick ass. Castiel had a perfect body: tight, fit, pert, and so damn smooth. He didn’t have a single scar or blemish or mole or anything, just miles of lightly tanned skin.
“Right.” Cass’ wing outline fluttered just a bit again. “The cherub made them crave love, and then Famine came, and made them rabid for it.”
Castiel snorted, or laughed, or chuckled. Dean couldn’t quite tell with the ringing in his ears and the renewed
The general sense of revulsion that had been with Dean since he woke up increased a hundred-fold. Cass had touched him? Cass had—oh, God. Cass had . . .
In fact, I have found most of the truly beautiful souls are inside humans who do not fit their current society’s standards of physical beauty. I have wondered whether outer beauty in humans actually discourages inner beauty, but I’m in no position to judge this. My brother Gabriel once told me that physically lovely humans are stunted in their spiritual development because they get everything they want by smiling and “showing a bit of hoo-hah.” I have no idea if this is correct, and I have often wished for an older brother who didn’t sound like he was making crude sound effects most of them time.
“It’s currently small so I can conceal it.” The angel was aware his voice was betraying the insult he felt, but he couldn’t control it. “Because the last thing I wanted to do was show it to you!”
“The reason of my visit dumbass! I brought you kebab! Knew you wouldn’t have eaten anything except popcorns or mars so…”
Chuck used to live here (and it was obvious… what with all the years of filth in the kitchen and in the bathroom), but he had said he couldn’t write here anymore and that he needed a place far away from the shop. Castiel had tried hard not to seem too desperate. And so, one month after acquiring fifty percents of the shop, Castiel had moved in the duplex under the roofs. It was small, it was cold and humid, but… it was hers. And the smallness of the place was quite comforting. Like a nest on the top of a tree or a beehive on a branch.
“I moved with Sam two years ago when he was accepted to La Sorbonne… Paris is expansive… So I found a job and then another one. It’s alright, I was never made for school anyway.”
“Eileen is brilliant Dean!” he told her as Eileen laughed easily, “She’s able to find the flaw in any file almost immediately while I need at least some days to study it!”
of movies DVD aligned in shelves alongside the walls. But the DVDs and the alcove roof were not the first thing Dean noticed as she stepped inside the room.
was still quiet when she dropped her jacket in the office before checking the program for today. She spotted Tessa opening the main entrance and starting the cash register. Today Dean wasn’t selling tickets, she just had to run the projection rooms. Waving hello, she climbed the concrete stairs hidden behind a locked door that led to one of the three projection rooms.
“Well maybe I can tell you when you’ll let me in? You know I’m not a vampire right? Plus, I’ve already been to your appartement hundreds of times so move your ass please.”
If Castiel and Dean were going to get together (Sam thought “Deastiel” and snickered), it would have to be as they were, angel and man. Man-looking angel and man.
Later that day, Castiel decided Dean was definitely not coming, so she took the boots and stored it in her apartment, just beside the old leather couch. The sun was setting, painting the small room in all shades of colors. From a rich orange to a darker green. The mezzanine was only lit by a small ray of sunshine, and Castiel could discern small particles of dust floating in the air.
“Showroom ready,” Dean added, nodding. “I thought we had the wrong place until they flashed their fangs.”
“Dean,” Sam said with the expected tone of annoyance. “There is no other route to getting on this cruise now. If Rowena had warned us earlier—”
magazine in his hands. He could imagine what the Winchesters would have to say about his thoughts about his harp. Sam would probably approve of his appreciation of the arts. Dean was more likely to ask him to play “Ramble On” and then forget about the whole thing.
Dean nodded. Soon they were appearing in Bobby’s front room. The sheriff was kneeling by a dark-haired little boy lying on Bobby’s well-worn sofa so pale and frail looking Dean was worried he was already dead. He was sweating with circles under his eyes dark enough to have been drawn on with a Sharpie. The only actual proof of life was a faint, raspy inhale, then labored inhale.
Many years ago, Dean Winchester asked me what I was going to do with my last night alive and was then dismissive of my plan to sit quietly. At the time, I didn’t understand what he meant about Bert and Ernie’s sexual orientation, but I did understand that somehow he took it as a personal affront that I should die without having experienced sex.
“They’re furries,” Castiel said. Dean looked at him. “Adults who derive social and/or sexual gratification from dressing up as furry animals and congregating.”
“What?” Dean demanded, but I just pushed slightly away from him (thrilling as he resisted), and then I starting stripping my clothes off.
Sitting on the edge of his bed, he put the harp’s knee over his shoulder and ran through a few dozen basic scales. Vaguely, he was aware of some other angel up in Heaven or two warming up. Loren had improved her hurdy-gurdy bit, and the sound was cleaner.
I thought then, oddly, of abandoned buildings, particularly those left to rot when they were still under construction: their half-made hulls, their unmade systems, their vast expanses of nothing. Just nothing.
Something came out of the dark right toward Sam’s head. He was able to duck it, but he felt it whip through his hair. Then came a sort of hic-cup and wail, which he and Jack ran toward (proving once again that hunters often lack basic survival instincts).
Sam was standing there, and in Cass’ body, in his memory, Dean walked forward to stand at Sam’s side.
I had never thought of myself as empty before. Lonely, yes, but not empty. Only as Dean began to fill the hollow of my chest, the emptiness of my thoughts, had I realized how hollow I was.
So Dean was more than a little surprised when Cass shoved him back on the bed with a touch of angel strength, not hurting him all, but definitely making clear Dean could do nothing about it.
