Christ.
He opened Baby’s door and dropped down in her seat. He laid his trembling hand on her steering wheel.
Cas was gone.
He saw Cas making an effort to be calm and gentleman like. “Well, I’ve just informed your brother,” Cas said quietly, not even sparring a glance to Dean, “that since I’m already dead to him, it will do very well if we don’t pretend to have any kind of interest towards each other’s welfare, and cut down our interaction strictly to the level of discussing a solution to the recent problem.”
Cas cupped the side of Dean’s face and lifted Dean’s head until he had no choice but look him in the eye again. ‘’Maybe we should compromise.’’ Cas said with a gentle smile. ‘’Stick to some rules. Like no more ass knocked, knee jerked decisions, no more fucked up choices, before speaking them through with the other.’’
He'd stopped breathing himself, everything suspended, he felt numb and hollow. It was as if Cas had taken his heart and everything that mattered away with him on his glowing lights.
A low blow, but bloody deserved, Sam thought, biting his lip to keep from grinning widely, as something like pride brimmed through his chest for Cas that- at bloody last- he stood up against Dean for himself.
He even managed a soft chuckle that coupled with a hard determination to find a way to patch up this irreversible ditch between his brother and his best, angelic friend.
His legs gave out. He dropped to his knees and crumbled down to the ground, limp like a ragdoll.
‘’He walked away the second, I turned around.’’ Cas points out.
Cas was sitting on the edge of the bed, head bowed, his posture tired and defeated. But when he lifted his head and locked his gaze on Dean, every well-practiced thought leaked out of Dean’s head. The fury in that stare almost buckled his knees.
Dean was a sobbing mess, powerless under Castiel’s harsh pounding, pinned face-down and letting the Alpha ravish him. How many had seen him just like this, taken him like this?
“Actually, there’s one thing, Dean.”
“Yes, yes! Cas, oh, Cas. Please, oh… Kiss me harder, there – there- ah, yes, yes, please, please, suck my asshole, Cas!”
Dean took Castiel’s cock in hand and showing off his skilled hand-eye coordination, managed to guide the stiff shaft right inside his hole without once bumping it on the way.
“No, Dean. You misunderstand me.” He pushed a little, planning for nothing else than teasing the ring of muscle. A saliva-lubricated rim job was not enough prep to fuck Dean, and especially not the way liked to. “You’ll wear your favorite crop top and your skanky shorts to the park. You can show off all you want; I will allow it, for today.” It was cute the way Dean was trying, and failing, to hide his excitement. “But in return, before leaving the house, I am going shove a plug up your ass.”
He retreated hastily and gave his cock a few tugs before falling down on the chair, exhausted and sullen and twelve kinds of horny. The view was good though, Dean’s dusty-pink hole winked at him, still gaping from taking in an Alpha cock and half a knot.
But there was a tinge of insecurity in Dean’s voice. Whatever it was it also marred his, until then, uniquely sensual scent. In spite of his frustration and inner conflict, Castiel’s Alpha kicked in, and all he wanted was to protect and comfort his Omega.
Dean sat on the desk, Castiel’s desk, and looked down at him. His fingers playing with a ring in his finger, but it wasn’t a promise ring, or so Castiel hoped foolishly.
“Morning” Cas whispered. The greeting directed at his clandestine partner, which he latched onto with his lips, kissing it harder.
Mrs. Roberts’ fury should’ve been targeted to her actual spouse instead of her junior student though, but feelings were complicated. Castiel scratched the back of his head.
Cas pushed forward, cock head barely dipping into the all too willing hole.
Castiel hated generalizations, but having been with no Omegas himself and with little sexual experience under his belt, there wasn't much for him to go by except for what he heard in the halls and what he remembered from his classes, and it was this: Omegas, by general definition, loved the knotting part of intercourse the most, it provided them with a pleasurable feeling of completion and it was vital for their health once they’d presented and were subjected to regular heats. Something about satiating a biological need, and the soothing physical and emotional benefits of milking a knot, absorbing the semen through the pores of their internal walls, and remaining locked with their partner to help stabilize their raging, unpredictable hormones.
“Cas.” Suddenly Dean stilled and leaned back to look Castiel straight in the eye. The slight change of position placed most of Dean’s weight on a single point, right on top of Castiel’s swollen knot. Castiel growled and inhaled, forgetting that right now the very air he breathed was intoxicating, his worst enemy if he wanted to get a hold of himself.
The dog suddenly pounced on them causing the three to fall onto the bed. Dean and Cas broke out into laughter as Miracle attacked the two with licks to the face. They were happy
He shot up. He was no longer on the beach. He was in his room in the bunker. Alone. Cas wasn’t lying next to him and Miracle was nowhere to be seen. Was everything just a dream? Did they not beat Chuck? Did Cas really not come back? His mind was racing. Alcohol. Where’s the alcohol? Fuck. He tried his best to push it all down, but he couldn’t breathe and everything started to close in on him.
It took awhile for Dean to calm down. But even then, the two just sat there taking in the silence. He’d poured out everything the night before and it felt like the weight he’d been carrying had gone but somehow it all came crawling back. All those years of bottling everything up, once you start letting it out it just doesn’t stop. Sam used to have panic attacks when they were younger. Was that what he was experiencing right now? It felt so much worse than how it looked. One thing he did remember that helped back then was breathing. In and out. He fought the thoughts that tried to overtake his head, focusing on inhaling and exhaling. “Dean.”
Sorry this one took so long! I got really busy plus with the holidays I didn't have much time to write. This chapter is more like a study in Dean type of thing. I started writing it as like a comfort thing because Dean has always been the one I relate to the most so writing out how I see his story kind of helps(?) Hope y'all like it :)
“What’s it look like I’m doing? Miracle’s not making it back home by himself and
Cas interrupted his son’s rambling with a hand to his shoulder. “Thank you, Jack. I’m so proud of you. This isn’t exactly what your mom and I imagined for you a few years ago but you did so well.”
Why was this so hard? Everything inside of him told him that he couldn't be happy. Not without Cas. Cas always made everything better. He was filled the void inside and now he was gone
Jack and Cas had a lot of work to do. Being the new God, he gave his dad his wings back and decided that he wanted to change some things, for the better of course. The two worked to redesign heaven. Living in your past for eternity wasn’t how people were supposed to live. So they tore all the walls down. Every room was demolished and heaven started anew. It reminded Cas a bit of Earth’s creation. Bobby, of course, was released from heaven’s prison. He didn’t belong there and wouldn't stay there any longer with the new management. Heaven was supposed to be eternal paradise and that’s what they were going to make it to be. They spent what felt like months making sure that everything was perfect for everyone. Cas reunited with a lot of familiar faces along the way. Ever since he rebelled against heaven, he wasn't exactly welcome to visit so seeing everyone again was incredibly surreal. Charlie wasted no time and immediately pulled him into a hug. Ellen, Jo, and Bobby thanked him for everything, especially for watching over the boys for so long. Cas never met Ash before so that was an experience. Everyone the boys had lost were all together because of him and Jack. Cas couldn't help but worry about Dean. He should be fine. He never felt the same way anyways so what was the matter?
He was confused at first but then it hit him. He did stab him. Not even a second into meeting the angel, his first instinct was to stab the guy. Dean playfully shoved Cas’ shoulder. “Hey, in my defense I thought you were a demon. But thinking back to it now, that entrance was kind of hot.”
Cas smiled. “Jack. He told me about what happened. How he’s the new God. He negotiated with the Empty and they let me go.”
----------
. He immediately shot up and made his way back to Dean’s room. Before entering, he stood there for a minute with his ear on the door, listening for Dean. At first he didn’t hear anything and thought he probably went back to sleep, but then he heard heavy pants. Slowly, he opened the door. The bed was empty and Dean sat in the far corner, curled up with his head in his hands. He’s never seen Dean like this. He carefully tiptoed towards him. Dean hasn't heard him come in yet and as he grew closer the light sobs got harder. Cas knew humans were fragile, especially Dean. But what caused him to be like this? Hours ago they were laughing and now he was breaking down. He knelt down in front of him, lightly laying his hand on the man’s shoulder, making his presence known. Dean’s head moved up to meet Cas’s worried gaze. Without wasting a second, he jumped into the angel's arms. Through his sobs Dean whimpered into Cas’s shoulder, “I- I thought you were still-”
God Dean and Cas are so fucking cute right? AND Sam and Eileen? We skipped ahead a bit for Sam but don't worry we'll catch up on the week we missed with Dean and Cas. I'm not letting it go that easily :)
Shit, this shouldn’t be so hot. Not a minute ago, Cas was comforting him and now this? Dean was getting flustered and his cheeks went red. He wanted to kiss him again, but this want was different than before. He’s never seen Cas like this since he threw him around that alley. Sure he was getting his ass kicked, but damn was it kind of hot. Before Dean could do anything, Cas backed away and headed out of the room. “Now, I have been waiting for hours in the kitchen with Miracle for you. Let’s go make you something to eat.”
After long seconds, when he pulled reluctantly back, Cas' eyes were wide, his pale cheeks still cool but the deathly cold was gone. And with eyes still brimming with tears, Dean just grinned down at Cas and grinned... he just couldn’t stop it.
‘’What he did wasn't bad.’’ Cas shot back with conviction, his expression almost defiant, his gaze steadily holding Dean’s, daring him to deny what he believed for the truth.
Sam made a sound— a gasp of shock. Then a deep, scolding voice of his name.
Tilting his head to the side, eyes darkening with hunger, his thumbs brushing over Cas lips, Dean said grinning. ‘’I thought it befitting to seal our deal with a kiss.’’
Despite everything he said, he did, without even realizing it, he’d grown to love the boy.
It happens so fast, like the moment after the shooting of a bullet ...He’s lunging forward and curling his fingers around the back of Cas’ head, he finds himself crouched over Cas and kissing him hungry and desperate before he actually realizes what he's doing ...
‘’Yeah, me too."
"Why not?"
Cas turned his head to face Dean. Although there was no smile on his face—no expression at all, in fact—there was a trace of bitter amusement there. ‘’I won’t be long. I meet you at the car.’’
He loved him.
It was a long, staggeringly deep, possessive kiss, and when Dean at last drew back, Cas couldn’t speak, just stared up, shocked, dazed, at that impossible, controversial, stubborn, beautiful man.
Sweeping past by Cas, the angel’s eyes were still glued on his brother's back. His eyes still jittering with guilt and Sam knew with pain over his brother’s struggle. He sent Cas a sympathetic look and clasped him quickly on his shoulder, then walked down the hallway to his room.
Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s shoulder, letting out a long, weary, shivering breath.
Sam’s mind was blaring. His heart was racing wildly. He called and called, trying to get hold of Dean and Cas for hours.
And damn it, as every time, it had kicked Dean’s conscience, and he would’ve done anything not to have Cas looking at him like that. And he had to turn his back on Cas again and take a few breath, because as always, he was shit scarred he was gonna lose it.
He’d failed at a serious relationship once, and had been sure, so sure, that he would never put himself in that position. The position, where he could fail at something so personal and painful again, and though he told himself he’d be content to drift along with the easy flings with no strings - he knows now, he’d been lying to himself almost from the beginning.
His heart began to beat in a wild, frantic race.
“Yeah, your fricking angel brainwashing and coding.” Dean grumbled, pulling Cas tighter against him, thinking he’d crawl inside him if he could. (But on a second thought, he could do that, couldn't he? But where would it leave them?) Instead, he slid his hands up to cup the back of Cas neck and drew him in for an other searing kiss.
Why was he feeling so wretched, so miserable, so worked up? Why was he so angry with Cas, with himself?
“I’m in love with you,” Dean said again, his thumbs
There was a hint of real anger now over the amusement in the tight smile that curled the edges of Cas’ lips. ‘’You’d know that Dean, don’t you? After all, there might be only but a few in this state, who’d acquired more experience with
dead kept repeating in his mind and it was as if that was the only thing he could hear.
‘’He swallowed hard. ’’Nothing. It’s nothing.’’ He cracked.
And despite the still present harshness in his voice, there, just like so many times before, there was
When they returned to the bunker, after they burned the empty shell what was left of their mother, his head aching, his eyes tearing, Dean set himself straight away in the direction of his room. It was so hard to focus, hard to force himself to set one foot in front of the other.
“Of course,” Sam sighed and placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder again. He pressed slightly down for a moment before he turned on his heels.
………………..
“Cas,” Dean said his name so blandly that it could almost not have been a reproof, except the tight clenching of his jaw.
Sam didn't know how long those two stood like this, lost in each others eyes, but he was just about to make his presents known when Dean’s hand fell of Cas’ arm and he took a step back.
Their waitress arrived then with a tired, bland face, sharpened to perfect politeness by years of practice,. ‘’What can I get you guys?’’ She asked with a tight, professional smile, scrabbling down their orders nonchalantly without paying attention to any of them… That's is… Until Cas cleared his throat and started to place his order.
When Dean’s gaze shifted from Cas to him, the fury pulsing in his brother’s eyes almost buckled Sam’s knees. He could feel the frustration and anger leaking out of Dean, sliding into the stone and the air itself around them, making it crackle with tension.
Cas’ eyes went wide like a fruit bowl, “Dean…” He gasped.
Maybe because his faith never wavering, Cas believed in Jack. Maybe because Cas was so bloody convinced that Jack was about to bring a fucking paradise to Earth. To bring light, something exceptional and good to this world.
‘’I was scared.’’ Cas’ voice, utterly broken, utterly pained came from behind Dean’s back. ‘’I believed in Jack for so long. I believed that he was... He was good. I— I knew that he would be good for the world. And he was good for us. My faith in him, it—‘’ Cas broke off and took a deep, shuttering breath before he continued. ’’It never wavered. And then I— I saw what he did. It wasn't malice. It wasn't evil.‘’ He said like he was trying to convince Dean, convince Sam… convince even himself. ‘’It was like Jack saw a problem, and in his mind, he just solved it with that snake.’’
' He said it at that time with so much surety, so much belief and conviction, but looking at his brother now...
And Sam’s heart stuttered, then crept up to lodge in his throat because there, in the charged quiet, he could hear and almost taste the struggle, the panic, the licks of fear, the desperation and the constant, bleeding present of defeat that coated his brother’s voice.
Cas tilted his head, eyes cool and blank... and waited.
Dean took Cas' face between his palms and getting lost in those endless, shinning blues, seeing the emotions softening Cas' features, the words were spilling of Dean's lips and he no longer felt foolish. “I love you. I’m so very much in love with you, Cas. There’s nothing I want more than to go on loving you and needing you for the rest of my messed up life.” The thrill of the true meaning and potentials of his own words made something hot bubble up in Dean's chest, then it sprinted through him and settled, warm and easy. “You could get used to saying it, too.”
tired,
“Yes.”
“No, no.’’ Cas protested with a tired sight and a tip of indignation. ‘’Asmodeus had my phone, you’ve been talking to him.’’
Dean huffs out a laugh at that. Smiling, he whispers, "
He had Cas alive again, and it was all that mattered. It was everything.
‘’Then I’m sure you understand perfectly how I felt when you flipped through the veil without me.’’
‘’Maybe it was Billie or Chuck-‘’ he shrugs, ‘’or even Jack-‘’ it spills out of him when he collects himself enough to answer.
And then Cas breathed.
“Did you—” Dean began. “That is… What did you say?”
Cas was staring at him as though he’d lost his mind. And Dean thought that in the light of what he was about to say, it wasn’t out of the question right now. He looked down into his fumbling hands and absolutely horrified, he went on with his speech.
When Sam sent a questioning brow towards his brother, Dean gave him a small, nonchalant shrug and a wide, defective, ironic grin, but along the clear sign of anger and irritation, Sam’d detect something close to fear and panic in those hard green of fields.
For a second Cas glanced away, then he looked back at Dean, eyes locked in their famous glaring match, a wordless battle of invincible wills. “You heard me.” Cas gritted out after a long-long pause, his voice only slightly shaking around the edges.
“I really appreciate it Dean,” Cas said in that calm way of his, flashing Dean one tense quirk of his lips.
When his eyes snapped to Belpfegor, “I didn’t say anything,” The demon said with an innocent face and his hands, Jack’s hands, turned guilelessly palm-faced on their table’s surface.
Cas' body jerked in Dean's arms as he was gasping for breath. His eyes flew open, a burning gold that seemed to stare straight into Dean’s soul.
Dean flinches and there is a cold in the bottom of his stomach. Of course, he should have known Sam could see that. Not that he was too subtle with his feeling after Amara and Lucifer and all that shit that happened. He knows Sam’s incredibly bright, obviously, and it’s not hard to admit that he is far smarter than him, but it never bothered Dean in the least. It’s a weird time to discover that actually, he’s very proud of his little brother. And Dean also knows that Sam has an exceptional talent for insights, there’s just too much compassion and heart in that giant body of his not to notice things on instinct. But somehow, Dean still gets lulled into forgetting that he isn’t his baby brother anymore, and keeps falling for that mild, wide-eyed puppy thing Sam does. He would have been an excellent lawyer- and something about that thought makes Dean’s heart hurt with guilt and regret.
One corner of Cas’ mouth curls up and Dean is sooo done...
When it starts to beat again it gives a mighty thud then sets to racing, and Dean takes a long needed, shuddering breath.
His heart dropped like a stone. The air was knocked out of his lungs with a hard jolt. He couldn’t breathe. And when in that devastating moment his cold, accusing gaze flicked to Cas’ face— whiter than bone, expression slacked with grief— despite everything, Dean felt an altogether different kind of jolt.
But Dean still felt like he wanted to break something. Preferably something sharp that he could stab himself with afterward.
He didn’t know why, or what, Cas did to make him feel like that. And it was all very strange, and sort of – nerve-wracking, and confusing, and really, Dean just fucking didn’t know how to handle it.
Dean closed his eyes and thought of the angel behind the other room across his. The angel he’d never believed he could have. The angel, he’d believed dead and for all his prayers and wishes he thought he’d never again have.
‘’That’s the attitude I’ve got.’’ Dean cut in, shouting now. ‘’You’re welcome to accept it, or you’re welcome to fuck off.”
“I’d like a cheese burger with fries. Thank you.” Oblivious as always, Cas placed his order flatly again.
A fact, that was earth shattering no more. A discovery, that stopped turning Dean inside-out a long time ago. Hell, maybe he’s been in love since the moment they met in that bloody barn.
‘Shh,’ He breathed, holding Dean tightly, rocking him. ‘’Dean – Dean. I think, I think— I know, how to bring Cas’ back.
just c'mere", and cups the back of Cas' neck. He curls his fingers in Cas' hair, and he's feeling an unexpected, stupid, giddy kind of euphoria as he leans in to kiss Cas again. And Cas’ hands are hot and perfect as he’s holding Dean's face, and when Dean nips his lips, he makes a noise, so throaty and erotic, Dean wants to push him down onto the ground, slide over him and kiss every inch of that perfect, strong body.
Dean's jaw clenched, his eyes never strayed from Cas’ face as he entwined their fingers, then pulled and pressed the back of Cas' hand against his chest.
Tears started to spill down his cheeks and he didn't move to wipe them away, just let them drip down onto Cas’ face. Reaching out a tentative, trembling hand, he smothered his tears on that dear face, flinching slightly at how cold it felt. He ran his thumb over Cas' full lips and the pad of his thumb caught on those characteristically chapped skin. "God, you're such an idiot. A stupid, brave, beautiful idiot. And I'll never be able to tell you just how much—"
Sam recognized the look. He’d seen and felt it hundreds of times before, and after a quick consideration he judged it better if he kept his mouth shut, because he knew better than to press when Dean got in such a mood.
“Good. Great.” More than a lttle dazed, Dean said. "You want to move into my room? We could, ah, t-take care of… it. Take care of it today or I dunno... tomorrow. Whatever. Yo-you want that don't you? Or you want time… or something?”
“Dean,”
“Alright, alright, got it,” Belphegor said with a resignated sigh. "It's bloody true though, you, Winchesters, are no fun at all." He grumbled with a petulant frown.
.' Chuck said then, and he didn't want to believe it then. He would never-
Maybe because Cas did.
Then, he just stood there...and watched Cas from the doorway.
A hand comes down to stroke over his ribs, and Dean finds that he’s breathing hard, in small, harsh gasps, slumped boneless against Cas, because his knees just gave out as his body transformed into one, long shudder of absolute relief. His emotions are in tatters inside him, adrenaline still coursing through his body, and in the bottom of it all; is the devastation and grief, that’s consumed him almost completely up over the last few weeks …
Usually, against all the shit kind of supernatural things, he’d use knives and guns and blades and every different sort of weapons in his arsenal, but he’d hardly ran through Cas and his fucking adorable head tilt and quirking smile with a blade.
Turning away from Cas’ intent, soulful gaze, Dean swiped a hand over his face. Taking in small, deep breathes against the adrenaline still firing through his body, he was just in the process to calm down himself when Rowena’s call screeched through the heavy silence.
And then Sam found his brother.
Now, just like he said before, after a decade of suffering through of all the UST between these two idiots, after having been in the middle of all their bickerings, giving eachother cold shoulder for days, and all the other crap of their non relationship-relationship issues; Sam wouldn't say he was surprised when Dean shot after Cas like a bullet and grabbed him by his arm again... Then he literally jerked Cas through the dinner and out, toward the parking lot.
Cas’ back jammed straight and Sam saw the hurt streaking through his eyes before it hardened and narrowed as he tossed back. ‘’You are right. Probably that’s exactly what I should do, fu--’’
His breath was coming hard, his heart was thudding like crazy in his chest, as he couldn’t do anything but stare at Cas.
“I’ve got a lot on my mind.” Cas retorted, voice cool, but Sam saw that his eyes lit on with a flick of anger.
“It doesn’t matter.” Cas rumbled, pressing a kiss to the tip of Dean’s head, and Dean would’ve crawled inside him if he could. ”It doesn’t matter now.”
Dean let his eyes roam over Cas face. He looked wretched and tired. His dark tousled hair was in worse shape than usual, and he had big, dark circles under his eyes. Causing another shaft of guilt shutting through Dean.
Cas’ eyes shifted to Dean’s hands, then up to Dean’s face, his brows drew together, and there was a question in his eyes.
By the time he was half through the booze, he felt shit-faced drunk, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t find that place inside, that numbed, untroubled place where he could escape. It seemed like damn Cas could follow him even there.
“With the way we live, it’s never going to be not messy or easy Dean.” Eyes closed, Cas nuzzled at Dean’s neck. “But come what may, you must know, I'll be happy as long as I'm with you. Anywhere.''
“You’ve made you my business,” Dean muttered, bracing his hands on baby's roof at either side of Cas’ head, looking down into Cas’ upturned face.
, hurting him was the last thing he wanted to do.
,,,,,,,,
And he made a movement to reach for Cas, fucking Hell, not that,
And Sam knew it was as good as an apology coming from his pig headed, pride brother. And Cas seemed to know it too for what it was, and he seemed to accept it as the closest and most of an apology he’d get, because his mouth quirked into that characteristic, half smile of his, and his eyes changed, lightened with a humor when he snorted.
Sam goes pale and Dean's hearing the anger in his own voice so he stops, struggling for control. Because the image of Cas falling down lifeless to the ground, the shadow of his wings burned into the ground is not going to fade anytime soon. And it tightens his chest and takes away his breath, and he presses the heel of his palm over his chest as his grief clutches heart in a vice grip again.
Even the thought, just the thought of it terrified him: the sudden epiphany of the chance that Dean was gone, Cas was gone, dissolved in a blink of an eye like all their friend. And after those terrifying moments of finding Eileen’s phone abandoned by her car, after long hours of trying not to think, not to feel, Sam realises he’s shaking, and tries desperately to stop it.
And Dean knew by the way Cas’ eyes and face had gone soft and dreamy, that he did.
“What the fuck, Cas?” Dean asked, his eyes spitting out dangerous, lethal flames. ’’We have to be on our way. We don’t have time for this shit.” He said, at once oddly pleading and threatening.
“Of course there’s blame, because it was a stupid, fucked up decision.” Dean shot back.
But when Dean’s eyes flicked back to Cas’ face, he must have caught it too. Because though Dean's face still flushed and eyes still blazed with anger that jarred, his expression changed, and Sam could observe how much his brother was struggling to get himself under control and not unleash the full storm of his wrath--and Sam knew, it was for the sake of Cas.
He immediately jumped to his feet and on a sudden rush of immense burst of relief, anticipation and hope, like a man possessed, he was running down the hill, stumbling over his feet in his haste.
and he heard himself saying in choked off, raw, desperate kind of voice. “Cas-‘’ he began, because he felt like he was breaking open, like the truth of his feelings were tearing their way out of his chest.
So, he is soaking up the small, soft, measured strokes of Cas’ hands over his back, his shoulders, the little circles of Cas' thumbs over the back of his neck, gentling him through the emotional aftershocks in a wordless
“Don’t do this, Cas,” he whispered, still shocked over the fact that the one thing he wanted above all, the one thing he thought he couldn't have, turned out that- all this time- he did have. And he felt frightened out of his gut and appalled at himself, because eventually, in a real Dean Winchester’s style, he still found a way to screw it all up and lose it in the end.
‘’Who cares what Jack said? We don't know what happened! But I swear, if he did something to her, if she is—‘’ Dean broke off not able to say it out loud what his gut was already telling him. Eyeing Cas intently, his expression grew dark, his jaw clenched hard until a muscle in his face jumped. ‘’Then you're dead to me.’’ He declared blunt and harsh.
‘’Cas, you’ve got your ears on...’’ He started.
Oh, for fuck sake, Sam thought, as a cold stone of familiarity wedged itself inside his throat. He’s seen this before. He’s been there before, watching all this shit, play out.
A chill ran down his spine, as all at once the realization, that he didn’t hear Cas entering the bunker, struck him cold.
than you?’’ Cas retorted back. Then he tilted his head and whispered against the side of Dean’s cheek. ‘’Over the years since we’ve known eachother, I’ve supposed I’ve got to know every streak-- the good, the bad, even the hidden ones-- of your character. But I’ve never took you for a hypocrite, Dean."
For a moment they seemed to be frozen there in the waiting stillness, connected by the one warm spot of Cas’s fingers on Dean’s shoulder.
The need, the want for Cas hit him so suddenly and forcefully that Dean had to grab and press his palms down, hard, on his abdomen against the pain when his body bent itself in half under the weight of his anguish.
‘’As you human tend to say Dean, you can’t choose your family.’’ Cas answered to Dean's statement with a vaguely annoyed and vaguely soft smile. ‘’And speaking of family... You know, it’s not like you waited for me before you charged through that drift. What do you think I felt when I realized, that you went into that dangerous world after Marry and Jack, without waiting for me to get back?’’
He opens his mouth against Cas’ neck and lets his tongue taste and hears the hitch in Cas’ breathing. He can feel Cas’ pulse rocket under his lips, as fast and wild as his.
Dean swallowed, and his gut clenched with an ice-cold fright. “Why does it sound like a goodbye?”
His hand clutched tight on the lapels of Cas’ coat as he pulled him into his lap, cradling that beloved, stubborn head. "You just keep doing this, don't you? Damn you Cas, you have to stop! How many times do I have to see you die? Just— why do you have to be such a pig-headed, fucking dumbass?" he choked, tone filled with affection.
It took Dean a minute to get himself together and process all the other shit about Lucifer, Michael and apocalypse Cas was telling them.
As Dean reached the top, he slopped down on a stone and watched the darkness of night give way to the breaking of dawn. By the time the first glimpse of sunlight appeared to his left, casting a soft orange glow across the bunker below, Dean knew what to do.
“I’m sorry,” breathless, he whispered against Cas lips, “I know, I haven’t bothered to give you much reason to believe how important you are to me, but Cas, if you'd give me a chance—” Dean gripped Cas wrists “— I could make it work. We could make it work. Come on, Cas, take a risk.”
‘’No. I was otherwise occupied.’’ Dean admits with a slow, smitten grin, leaning back in to nose his way up to Cas' neck and hide a kiss below his ear.
He saw Cas’ truck parked in the garage beside the impala, and with a sudden, twisting pain in his chest, Dean remembered the flutter of excitement under his ribs when he came back with Jack, and realized Cas was back. That little vibe of warmth and contentment he felt, a feeling that made him think of Home.
. Because obviously, Cas, the sole person in this world, just had this effect on his brother.
Then he’d breathed in, sharp and greedy and it was loud in his ears, his bloody lungs forced him to breathe despite knowing Cas wouldn’t breathe again.
“Fuck. Sam." And for the first time since his eyes landed on Cas, he turns to look.
''And I know, that all this time, we’ve got something going on here. I know I said it was just friendship and you were like a brother to me. Which you are, I mean you are my best friend—‘’
He didn’t remember entering his room, but there he was, in the middle of it. Shredding his dirty, smoked clothes, defeated, terribly lost, terribly tired, with a big, gaping hole in his chest, he crawled into his bed.
“I can’t change the past, Cas,” he murmured into Cas' hair, “But we can make the future. Our future. Together. Do you understand how much I need you?’’
He went completely still while he listened to what Rowena was saying, and it wasn’t until she lowered her voice and whispered in a faint, deeply sympathetic tone, ‘’I can tell you with certainty Mary Winchester is no longer on this Earth,’’ that he realized his whole body was shaking with dread.
And Cas is
Dean was fine. He had to be fine. Christ, No! He couldn’t even contemplate it if he or Cas was not.
indecipherable look in his eyes.
Cas’ sacrifice mustn’t be for nothing, Dean told himself as he took one shaky step after another toward the garage.
‘’It was the absence of good.’’ Cas went on quiet and cautious. ‘’And I saw that in him. But we were a family, and I didn't want to lose that, so I thought I could fix it on my own.  Felt like it was my responsibility... So I left... And I didn't tell you. If I could go back and just— just talk to him right then and there, I would.‘’ His voice dipped on an anguished breath before he said. ‘’But I can't, Dean.’’
Springing forward, Dean shifted into his path, coming up hard, toe-to-toe with him.
So, it's true.
Suddenly the hand gripping Cas’ arm was pushing, pushing him towards Baby’s side door. Taken by surprise, Cas stepped backwards, his feet tripping a little as Dean pressed him farther till his back and hips hit the glass of the door.
He meets Sam’s eyes again. ’’ What do you want me to say?’’ he asks tired.
The man turns and Dean freezes on the spot.
Her eyes went wide and locked with Cas' ridiculously blue- blues. She swallowed, cleared her throat and asked in a slightly husky voice. ‘’Excuse me, what was your order?’’
And he wanted Cas to confide in him, to share with him every part of his being that had been, that was, that would be. He needed Cas to turn to him when he was troubled or sad, or when he was happy. Hell,
If on the way to the café Cas' hand slipped from the small of Dean's back to somewhere closer to his hip, but which could very much be considered the side of Dean's right butt cheek, well, no complaints were raised.
He tried pulling away, but Cas’ arms held him captive. Then Cas angled his hips just right so that the head of his cock was poking Dean’s asshole.
Ever the fan of cleanliness, the boy propped himself up on an elbow and bowed his head down to get his fill. “Oh baby, you told your dream so good. I really liked it.”
“Dean?”
He proceeded to lick Dean’s ass dutifully, savoring the tiny dips and reliefs that made its texture. Then, Cas pushed it gently with the tip of his index finger. Above him, Dean slept peacefully, oblivious to Castiel’s deviancy. After much wiggling, Cas managed to lodge the finger up to the second knuckle, then used it as a hook and pulled to the side, helping him unfurl the rosebud, like delicate pink petals blooming. Oh, how sweet and dirty, how sublime. Dean’s asshole was perfection, his plump cheeks, and his tight heat. It was addictive, and once tasted, it was impossible not to feast upon it. Drunk by the sensation, Cas went to town. His lips, his tongue, the barest scrape of his teeth, all set in having the tight little hole yield for mercy. He pushed his tongue deeper and spread the globes farther apart.
Dean shook his head and kissed Castiel on the lips. Despite being impaled in Dean, feeling his hole squeezing and relaxing, struggling to adjust, their light kiss felt significantly more intimate, tender and real. He wanted to believe it meant more, but it was better not to expect anything more than what he was given.
“So the rumors are true.” Castiel said, moderating his voice into more than brutish grunts.
They were going to meet with Castiel’s brother Gabriel and his girlfriend Kali for dinner, and then they’d go play mini golf. Granted, their plans didn’t make for a fancy evening requiring a stuffy dress code, but Dean had wanted to wear a long-sleeved crop top with skin-tight leggings, both in mesh, the first entirely, the second with the material starting mid-leg. The clothes were white and, contrary to the brand’s claims, they were very much see-through. Dean didn’t even work out that much, if at all, but he was going through a sportswear phase.
No matter how hard he tried, Sam couldn't help him. Why could he say? That everything would be fine? That he would be okay? We both knew damn well it wasn't true.
his pain, although he didn’t know the reasons of its unmistakable presence. This wasn’t meant to be seen by anyone, it was personal, intimate, telling a story that Dean wished he would understand. How could this man make his movements so gracious and brutal at the same time?
Dean had seen his kids dance so much, whether it was at home in socks on the tiles of the kitchen or a few times a year on stage. He didn’t know if they particularly good at it from a professional point of view, nor did he care. All that mattered to him was how both of them looked so happy when they span around and jumped and endlessly practiced their
"And?"
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's okay. It's okay. He's a friend, all right?”
Dean knew nothing of dance, but this performance spoke to him. Anger and sadness poured out of man, something that was painfully familiar to him. He felt like he
Castiel nodded, “Just worried.”
Jumps after jumps, he continued to dance, oblivious to Dean’s presence. Every movement as he leaped through the air seemed effortless and still, there was a heaviness hidden behind those that Dean couldn’t describe. Gravity didn’t seem to apply to him. It was as if he was trying to escape his own skin, the man looked torn, the gestures of his body looked ragged, sharp one second and light and fleeting the next, a pure contradiction. If he could jump high enough, move fast enough, maybe he could escape himself.
“We have a dance next week Daddy! Will you come see us? Say yes, say yes, say yes”, the boy pouted with hopeful eyes.
What was happening?
He looked mad, and gorgeous.
He hoped they’d have more time, Castiel thought as he opened the door to the bunker. More time to grieve, peacefully, before the next big bad enemy would inevitably storm in. He bolted down the stairs, hopeful to see Sam safe and sound despite the nagging feeling in his gut. His gut proved right, if the blood on the floor was any indication. Wait. Someone is here.
Without a word, Dean nodded and entered the car while Sam sat on the passenger seat. The road was long until they arrived to the bunker. Hands gripping the wheel, Dean was trying to focus on the road in front of him but time to time he just couldn't help himself and looked into the rear-view mirror. Cas's body was still there, unmoving. But when the car hit a pot-hole on the road, Cas' arm previously resting on his chest fell limply beside him, lifelessly.
made sure were to be proudly hung on the fridge’s door. He loved looking at those, they were little pieces of art to him, created by his children’s tiny fingers, so full of joy and color. Yesterday had been a new sunset painting in Jack’s collection -a beautiful however unrealistic picture of a blue sun setting over a red sea- and a montage of geometric figures stuck on a hand-made drawing of -what looked like- a skinny bear (or a horse?) with no ears and the nose of a pig. Dean had no idea where his kids’ ideas came from, but they never failed to surprise him.
His body slowly started to relax under the effects of alcohol as he poured another swig of whiskey down his throat. He was fine. He was fine. He was-
Much love!
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice... a mail."
Sam put the jacket over the back of a chair and, wordlessly, both of them made their way to the crowded bookshelves and started looking for a way to bring Dean back. And when Toni Bevell appeared, they were defenseless.
He hadn't meant to scream but this white light was getting too intense to keep his eyes open, but it was taking Cas away and now he could barely see his face anymore. And he didn't want to let go, he just couldn't let him go.
And here is the second and last part! I hope you will enjoy it!
When Dean went back to his room that night, the longing had never felt so great as he walked through his empty, cold bedroom. He laid on his bed, and after a minute of silent contemplation at the bare ceiling, he reached out to his pocket, and pulled out the mixtape. That bloody mixtape...
"Castiel... I would do anything to bring him back, if I figure out how. I promise you that, Dean"
"Dean. He was stabbed by an angel blade. We have no cure for that."
Dean blinked, once, twice, his breathing progressively slowing down to a more normal pace. Well, that had been something. Dean readied himself to move out of this strange numbness that had settled in his bones and took a slow step backwards.
The long silence that followed was deafening.
Dean could still feel the heat of the fire on his face, and now the taste of ashes on his tongue. He knew alcohol would not erase it this time, and he didn't want to get drunk despite how it would be able to drown the pain and bury it, at least for a couple of hours, but Cas didn't deserved that.
"Dean", said Jack, looking with curiosity at the scene before him.
Finally coming back home. But it would never feel the same way again, right? Because Dean held the Angel's dead body, and lifted him on the library's table, and Cas, his Cas, was dead and... he was never going to come back this time.
Grabbing Dean's shoulders, he pulled back to meet his brother shut eyes. He shook him, cradled his face in his hands, did everything not to lose the grip on the elder Winchester.
Long hair, similar age to Dean (?), but definitely a trained individual. Another of Toni’s crew here to finish the job?
"Tell me. Why?"
Cas had always fought for them, with them, and if he was really going to leave, he would leave like Hunters did, because he was one. Part of the family business in his own angelic way. But not anymore.
"See you then"
, but he couldn’t help himself. His eyes drifted back to the man’s face and his
Loss was always painful but this... this felt like dying and dying all over again, as every beat of his heart against his chest reminded him  that Castiel's own heart had forever stopped. This felt more painful because it was Cas. His best friend, his family, the fucking love of his life even if he hadn't had the guts to admit it. It was too late now. Stupid, stupid Dean. If he had stopped focusing on his fears of rejection, if he had accepted sooner his feelings, then maybe... maybe they could've worked it out. Maybe they could've been happy, together. Too late now, fucking too late.
The tears had fallen, streaming down his face in an endless flood he couldn't stop.
And he never had the courage to tell him that he loved him.  And he broke. Without thinking, Dean grabbed whatever was whithin his reach to throw it violently across the room with all the rage and pain he felt inside him. The books, the papers, the  lamps, everything was being falling apart, just like him. He broke and threw everything he could find, pulling the chairs and tables upside-down, smashing the glasses and the mirrors on the ground with his bare bloody red hands.
“And there was the saut-de-chat too! I know how to do it, look Daddy!”
Cas. Cas was dead.
With a slight tilt of his head, Cas, oh god, smiled, a slight curve forming on his lips.
“Hands, now.”
When he opened his eyes again, everything was still. The silence was heavy. When Dean opened his eyes again, he saw dark, blue, giant  and beautiful wings craved in the concrete, and Cas' lifeless body resting on the ground.
He knew the eldest Winchester did not like him, if the look of pure hatred on his face when he turned sharply towards him was an indication. What he didn't know was... why? He needed to find out.
"I should've told him. He'll never know now, he'll never-"
This gravelly voice again. Dean's look turned down to the speaker and he found it unbearable as he saw Cas' weary face glancing at him, thick red blood coming out of his mouth and Cas' hand, heavy and shaking coming to take his own in a tight embrace.
, counting the rhythm
“Not now, please. Not yet.”
Today would be the same. Dean opened the front door and could already hear the distant excited tone in the children’s voices, running around the old wooden-floor room. How Tessa, the dance professor, managed to keep them all silent and still for a whole hour and a half every week was still a mystery to him. He crossed the threshold and immediately saw Charlie and her red hair leaning against the wall with her equally bright haired daughter in her arms. He approached her and knew the exact moment she had seen him when her face turned into a more cheerful expression.
The woman who faced him, gun out and pointed towards him wasn’t Toni.
Sam swallowed back the lump in his throat. Seeing his brother like this... it was killing him. Dean didn't deserve this, he was a good man, no matter what the man himself believed, he didn't deserve how much crap had been put on his shoulders all these years. And now he had lost Cas. Sam didn't know if his brother was ever gonna come back from this.
"Why do you hate me so much?"
"Do you think it could have worked? I'm just a pathetic little human and you're the Angel here, but I'd like to think... we could have worked, in a way or another. Actually I was terrified that- I would lose you then. I tried with Cassie, with Lisa, and Ben... Every time I let myself care for someone, I always lost them at the end, and I didn't wanted this to happen to you. I suppose it was useless, you're still gone anyway now."
And Castiel understood. It’s okay, it wasn’t their time yet. But it would come, eventually.
“No I want to do it-“
Dean looked out of place in his own bedroom, as if he never expected to be back here, and he probably didn’t.
And here they were. While Sam went out to gather sticks for the firewood, Dean stayed inside. The shroud in hands, he started to wrap Cas' body in the white sheet, covering his trenchcoat, his blue tie. Dean stopped at his head.
Dean was a mess. In his head, Cas being stabbed played over and over again, the memories they shared flashed before his eyelids, all the opportunities they have had and they had done nothing, so much time wasted when they could've being happy.
, and drinking entire bottles of water almost quicker than Dean drowning his bottles of beer. Almost.
She didn’t let up. Nor would he.
"No no. Come on Dean, it's okay" he whispered to himself, his hands shaking when he pushed them against his mouth, forbidding the cry to come out. It hurt, goddammit it hurt but he couldn't let go. If he did, Dean was afraid nothing would save him again.
“Sam!” Eileen called out as she walked down the steps.
The angel nodded in thanks. “Well, what about you?”
He turned back to his father and then glanced up to the door. “Amara’s right. Stop dancing around each other as Sam would say. He’ll be back in a bit. In the meantime, I’m gonna stay with my mom for a little while.”
Dean stayed in front of the bunker for a while. He couldn't stop thinking. Thinking about Cas and what would come next for him. Cas was the one thing that made him truly happy. He had Miracle now, of course, but having Cas there was different. His mind wandered back to that day.
His whole life, he had never had a second of peace. Well, besides the first 4 years of his life, but he barely remembered those memories now. Hell, in all those years he bounced around school, he never even took a second to enjoy the break from his dad because he knew it’d be ripped away the second he settled in. He made that mistake once, so he made sure it never happened again. Growing up traveling across the country was not as fun as people made it out to be. Maybe it was because of his dad. No not maybe. It was because of John. Once he found out about the things that went bump in the night after his mom died, everything was flipped upside down. John was too caught up in hunting that he forgot about his two children. That left Dean to take care of Sam. Even as a young toddler, he was forced into taking care of Sam. It shouldn't have been his job. He was just a kid. He also learned this the hard way. Looking back, his childhood was even more fucked up looking past growing up on the job. Happiness was never a possibility for him and he settled for it. Hunting gets you dead.” That’s what his dad always told him and that’s what happened to the old man in the end. So yeah Dean settled for the idea that he was always going to die at the end of a blade, the barrel of a gun, claws, or teeth. But then Cas came along. He was a stuck-up asshole angel when he first met but over time, the angel grew on him. Dean was John’s obedient soldier. The son who didn't question orders. Cas was a warrior, an angel of the Lord. He was meant to follow orders and never question it. But when John died, Dean didn’t have to follow orders anymore. A milligram of the weight that rested on his shoulders lifted. He didn’t hunt to prove himself to his dad, he hunted to save people. Then the apocalypse was on the rise and he had started it. So he did his best to try and stop it before it was too late. Cas didn't help at first. Free will wasn’t an option for the angel until that one night when Lilith was trying to make a deal with Sam. “Yeah well, we’re making it up as we go.”
“Healing doesn't happen overnight, Dean. Ever since I pulled you out of hell, I knew you were different. Despite the world tearing you apart, you continued to fight for it. It broke you in ways no one should be broken. For so long you’ve been alone to try to pick all the pieces up but not anymore. I’ll be right here with you, every step of the way.” How could he still be with him even after everything? Dean was a mess. He had always pushed people away, especially Cas. Dean treated him horribly. So why was he still here? “Why?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s mind went blank. Those fucking blue eyes. Cas had made his way much closer to Dean to where they were just inches apart, Dean with his back against the wall. “Didn’t want to disappoint.”
Ugh I cannot wait to get everything written. Leave comments or kudos? Or something I don't know how AO3 works but whatever we're flowing with it. I spent all day working on this instead of working on homework and I'm glad people are liking it so far <3
“Because of all the millennia I’ve lived, being with you makes me feel. The moment I touched your soul in hell I could tell. You’re the purest human I’ve ever encountered. The righteous man.”
At those words, the weight was gone. Unknowingly, Dean had made his way closer to Cas and he was now inches away from him. Neither of them knew what to do. Their eyes never left the others gaze. Years of feelings were poured out between them. All the words that were left unsaid for years were now heard. It felt freeing. Before they could act, the fluffy third wheel pawed at their feet. Both let out soft chuckles and the tears turned happy. “Miracle, this is Cas. Cas, Miracle.”
’’Have you not realized?’’ Cas asks then with a fucking adorable, small, confused frown.
The gold faded from Cas’ eyes and he blinked up at Dean in confusion, a frown pinching his brows. “Dean?” he slurred, trying to sit up.
No one has ever looked at him like Cas. Like Dean was the focus point of the universe. Like he was essential. Like he was everything that was there. Even though Cas has freaking literally been there right from the beginning, witnessing bloody everything.
He flinched when he felt a hand on his shoulder, ’’Dean?’’ Sam asked softly, giving him a searching, worrying look before he said quietly. ’'We need to go.’’
“Oh, Hell no,’’ Dean reached out and grabbed Cas’ arm. ‘’I’m in your way because you’re in mine. And it’s long past time to settle this.’’
Cas face remained stoic as he sighed. “Dean, why are you gnawing at this? I’m here now. Luckily, safe and sound. End of story.” he said, his tone somber but his voice was wavering with something more than exhaustion.
And suddenly all the breath seems to have left Dean’s lungs and he watches rather dazedly the way Cas’ throat moves when he swallows… And Dean feels inexplicably dizzy, somehow, while his heart is pounding high in his throat.
Dean’s hands were clasping his shoulders, holding Sam’s body against his chest, because Dean’s body seemed to have collapsed.
Dean tried to quickly push the thought away. It couldn’t be.
“And what it is
‘’Cas,” He chokes out, lifting his head from Cas’ neck, dropping a soft kiss to the hand on his shoulder. "I love you,’’ he says in a crackly voice, and the hands that were still stroking freeze for a second before slipping and clutching at Dean’s shoulders, holding on almost painfully tight.
"Oh, dam you, Cas." Dean grumbled, pushing himself closer till his hip was pressing into Cas’. And when he shifted his hips just so, Cas'd feel just how real and hard and hot Dean's arousal was as it was nudging against Cas' own, rapidly hardening cock.
''You know what I want,'' He answered, breaking off their kiss to slide his lips down along the fluttering line of Dean’s neck, pulling Dean even closer in a sudden need to feel him warm and alive against him.
He shifted his weight and thumped nervously with his fingers on the table’s surface. ‘’Look man, I know I fucked it up…’’ Dean began, despising the slight tremble of his voice.
They won. Chuck was human and totally harmless. Jack the new God. All their friends from the Apocalypse and this world: Charlie, Bobby, Donna, Jody and the girls were back. And Eilleen… Sam reminded himself again with another sudden sharp jolt of happiness.
Fuck. Cas was kinapped, locked up for weeks and everytime he spoke to him on the phone it wasn’t him, and he didn’t even realize it. The thought made Dean sick and light-headed. A sour taste was burning in the back of his throat.
He unwinds his fingers and boneless, slumps down,  his head dropping onto the wheel between his arms as he sucks in a huge, shattered breath. He feels Sam’s eyes on him, and he tries desperately to control the shaking that's wrecking through his body.
“Krissy stepped on her toe during the class, Tessa told me it was nothing, but she’s been upset ever since”
“Who are you, and where is Sam?”
It had always been painful, loving Dean Winchester. Watching him from afar, never able to touch him, hold him the way he longed for. He tried not to stand so close to Dean. But on the rare occasions Dean did get close - a lingering touch on his shoulder, a brush of his fingers at the dinner table - he let the sweet, sweet agony take over him for this half a second of contentment. It was worth it, worth the pain, Cas told himself often.
Not like every other Wednesday after all.
He didn't need that, he didn't need people telling him they were sorry with a sad expression on their faces like he was sure everybody will do, he just- he just wanted Cas back.
On their way back to the bunker, Dean had insisted to drive his Baby despite Sam's concern. After Cas died, the younger Winchester offered to take himself the corpse so they could bury it but Dean wouldn't give in, saying he wanted to hold it until they get to the car.
eyes that made Dean’s heart skip a beat.
"Cas?" He heard his own voice break at the sudden rush of pain in his guts. He couldn't breath. God, he couldn't breath.
"I'm so sorry Dean, I wish I could do something. I'm so sorry" he replied, his voice breaking at the end.
Cas. Cas. Cas...
One day when the world wasn’t collapsing around them, when they would all be safe. When the time would come, he would be by Dean’s side, like always.
Dean’s brain disconnected as soon  as he entered the bunker again. Everything was still and silent. Sam had left, leaving him some time alone.
His body went rigid, his muscles contracting as he block out a new wave of longing and despair. It reacted on its own to the sorrow he felt, transforming the emotions into physical pain. His limbs felt stiff and sore, completely exhausted. He desperately tried to hold back a shaky sob stuck as he listened once again to Castiel's deep, innocent and clueless voice he missed so much.
And it would stay there, forever.
Castiel wondered if this was it. If, finally, the unspoken truth between him and Dean was going to be uttered aloud. He allowed himself a moment to imagine it. He pictured his hand coming up to Dean’s cheek, being able and encouraged to touch the way he wanted to. He tried to visualise kissing him. It was harder than he thought it would be. After dreaming of it for so long, imagining it coming true felt surreal, impossible. He wished kisses into existence, his hands trembling with it. Dean’s fingers combing through his hair, his lips taking him apart.
Dean heard footsteps. Sam? Jack? The hunter didn't have the strength to look up and the look of pity of their faces. Yes, he was miserable, and it was all his fault. It doesn't mean he wanted his brother and that demi angel freak to see him this way.
"We owe you so much Cas. You were family, and you saved us so many freaking times. You sacrificed yourself more than once and you almost died for that. I don't know if we properly thanked you for all you did for us. You were a good man, or Angel whatever. I just sorry it had to end like this. I'm just- I'm sorry Cas."
“Sure, man. You okay?”
He felt a hand try to take him away form the body, but Dean didn't want to move. Shoving it away, he gripped the damn trenchcoat in his bleeding hands and held on.
No answer came as the said Amy quickly hid her face in her mother’s neck. Dean raised his eyebrow questioningly and Charlie winced slightly, managing to whisper quietly so that the girl wouldn’t hear.
“Dean”, she greeted with a smile. Charlie was the closet person he was to among the dance club, both nerdy parents that swore they would force their kids to watch Star Wars when they were older.
"Dean..."
Dean winced back and looked back at the class full of kids in front of him as Tessa told them a last goodbye and counted on them to be here next week. Knowing Krissy, she couldn’t have been gentle, this girl was fierce for her age and Dean knew in his experience that she didn’t like to be messed with. About a year ago after the class usual performance on stage, Dean had attempted to help her by taking off her ballet shoes as a he had volunteered to be one of the chaperons. The bite mark on his forearm he had kept for the next few hours had been a terrific demonstration of force. Every kid in the club was pretty much nice according to him, most parents were as well; except maybe that uptight-looking Naomi that always bragged about her daughter’s
"Where do you think we should bury him?"
He couldn’t erase form his mind the moment in that barn, almost the same in which they met. He was still able to see evey detail of it even through he just wanted to forget. How the demon stabbed Cas in the back, how he fell to the ground, how Dean held him as he  died, and that bright light burning everything around him. And he couldn’t forget. The images kept flashing before his eyes.
I know it's a bit short but don't worry we'll get into it more and more with the next chapters. This was more so a prologue kind of chapter so we'll be off in the upcoming chapters. Happy reading my people <3
Pulled from his thoughts, he asked, “What do we do now?”
Hope y'all are liking this so far because I really enjoy writing it!
The kitchen wasn’t very far from Dean’s room. For a couple more hours Cas sat there waiting. At some point, Miracle had trekked in and lied down in the empty space next to Cas. Having company other than Sam or Dean was refreshing. He could talk to Miracle without the awkwardness that comes with conversations. Although the dog couldn't talk back, it was nice. Eventually, he found himself on his back on the kitchen bench with his hand petting the dog’s head. He lost track of time a long time ago. The two sat in silence and that was when Cas heard it. “No no no.”
