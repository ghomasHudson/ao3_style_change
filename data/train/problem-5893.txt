"I know, little guy, and I'm gonna take care of it for you." Steve had just shifted his leg to step off the bed when he felt a cold, metal hand grip his shoulder.
Apparently they were hungry, yet another thing that Peter could relate to, even though it now took him twice as long to actually eat anything.
Just like the images of Peter falling and being pulled under the water.
"Well… yeah, I guess," admitted Peter. "But that's mainly 'cause we're still learning the whole experiment process, and—"
The girl who apparently liked him back, which was even better.
"Geez, that bad, huh?" Peter muttered. "Whatever happened to 'everyone loves the Avengers'?"
"Dad's right, little guy, there's no sense in pushing things if we don't have to," Papa said in his Captain's voice, which Peter knew better than to argue with. "You can take it easy tomorrow and then go back the next day."
"All right, can we bring out the prototype, please?" Hammer called from a balcony somewhere behind Steve, his voice echoing against the concrete walls and ceiling. He clapped his hands, rubbing them together like an excited toddler. "Oh, this is gonna be so good, I just know it!"
“Uh huh.  That sounds fine.”
And yet, here Steve was, still trying to work up the courage to tell Tony something that he probably should've told him weeks ago.
The M rating comes into play during this chapter 😉.  Enjoy!
"Eh, it was more like I wanted to prove that I was nothing like my father," Tony said firmly. He tapped his fingertips on the table, giving the sprawling mess hall another anxious glance. Steve had insisted that it was okay for Tony to join him in the officer's mess for dinner, and they had even talked very pleasantly with his teammates Captains Wilson and Barnes for awhile, but Tony still wasn't quite comfortable sitting in what he'd always felt was a forbidden place.
The sound of Steve's heavy footsteps approaching broke Tony from his thoughts, and he looked up, his heart doing the little fluttery thing it always did whenever Steve entered the room. He was obviously fresh from his shower, with his flushed cheeks and his still-damp hair combed back, wearing one of Tony's favourite blue t-shirts that matched his eyes and looking so unbelievably sexy that Tony's mouth suddenly went dry.
"Oh. Yeah, that makes sense," said Ned. "I tell you though, my mom is still really upset about what happened up there. She keeps telling my dad that we need to buy this goofy thingy that she saw on the shopping channel so we can protect our house in case there's another attack."
Actually, more like
Peter wasn't quite sure what he'd been expecting Thanos to look like, but he did know that this wasn't quite it. For one thing, he was purple, completely bald, with his chin covered in deep horizontal creases and his cheeks criss-crossed with either scars or age lines, Peter couldn't quite tell which. He was dressed in a metal and leather chestplate and boots that reminded Peter of the armour worn by horsemen during medieval times.
"Just need to tell Tony that you're not dead," Bucky said. "I get it."
The team worked on the speeches for the entire practise, much to Peter's surprise given Liz's propensity for the rapid-fire questions. His speech on the hidden cons of fabric softener went over quite well with the team and managed to absolutely stump Mr Harrington, as did Gwen's speech on solar power vs wind power and Ned's on the scientific difference between a malt and a milkshake.
"I'm—I'm really sorry to bother you, Captain," Gwen said softly as she stepped inside. She paused as she glanced down at Tony, her already pale, drawn face going even paler. "I just—I just—"
"Uhh… so now you're talking about parallel universes?" Scott asked, obviously confused. "'Cause if so, I'm pretty sure we've just jumped right out of
"Daddy," he whispered, his voice a bit raspy and soft, but still stronger than it had been before the Phoenix mission.
He arrived panting and sweating to find the entire team minus Thor assembled in the lab, all crowded around Bruce's workstation. Thor had been summoned back to Asgard a couple of days ago in order to deal with yet another incident involving his brother, promising to return as soon as he could.
"And Peter?" Steve asked. "What about him?"
"All right, Steve," he said, so quietly he was surprised that Steve even heard him. "You have exactly one minute."
Steve bit down on his bottom lip as his belly gave a nervous swoop.
"Oh," Tony said, annoyed that he hadn't thought of that since it made perfect sense. "Well, shit. How in the hell am I supposed to work around that?"
Steve let out a shiver at the mention of HYDRA, just enough for Tony to notice. Even though HYDRA was finally completely dead and gone, Steve still didn't appreciate having to hear its name mentioned.
A knot rose in Peter's throat, and he tore his gaze away, unable to look at her. She was right, and he knew it. But that didn't mean he had to admit it out loud.
"Clint, watch it!" Steve shouted, raising his shield just in time to block the shot that came from somewhere off to their left.
Just 'friends' had never caused Peter's stomach to flip like that before, so…
Sam had told Steve multiple times that he would likely never forget such an experience, but that over time the traumatic memories would fade.
But for Steve, and for Peter, Tony
"Mmm," Tony moaned softly as Steve finished with the soap and reached next for Tony's shampoo, proceeding to wash his hair with such attention and care that Tony couldn't help but moan again. Steve was so physically strong; an attribute that he had demonstrated on so many occasions that Tony had long lost count, and yet he was so gentle with Tony that it no doubt took more of Steve's strength to reign himself in than it did to express it fully.
"Oh, sure, now you wanna run," grumbled Tony. He tapped the container on his chest to deactivate his suit. "You haven't even had the decency to thank us yet."
"Ned didn't tell me her name," Peter answered through a mouthful of milkshake. "Just that her dad's a deputy police chief."
The next chapter will post on Monday, January 18th 😊
felt the need to tell him that he wasn't allowed to officially join the Avengers until he turned eighteen.
"Damn right," added John. "Time for the party!"
"Mmm," muttered Tony. "And I'm sure you didn't even try and convince her otherwise, hmm?"
"Yeah, and that's not gonna happen, and you know it," stated Peter, groaning in frustration when Dad rolled his eyes. "Look, I know you hate it when I say stuff like this, so I'll just say it one more time and then shut up about it for now, okay?"
"Agreed," said Fury. "And let's hope that nothing else goes down. We haven't even finished dealing with the whole HYDRA mess yet, and I always hate having to deal with two crises at once. It tends to make me extra cranky."
Pursing his lips, Peter grabbed his notebook, rubbing at his sore nose as he began writing yet another set of code. In the end, Peter knew that it would really all come down to whether Papa would agree to go forward with the mission once he was told of its parameters, and based on how well he'd gotten to know Papa in the last few months, Peter had a strong feeling that Papa would do it, no matter what the potential consequences were. He was a military pilot, yes, and very much enjoyed being one, or at least he did most of the time. But meeting Peter and Dad had already changed him so much that now he wanted nothing more than to settle down with his family. He wanted what he had called "the quiet life", and Peter desperately wanted him and Dad to have it.
“Thanks,” Dad said quickly, his eyes never leaving Papa’s face.  “Okay, honey, this is exactly what’s supposed to be happening, yeah?  Sam said that identifying what triggers you is one of the best ways to help with your recovery, so what do you say we blast the hell outta this damn trigger and then get the hell out of here, yeah?”
"All right, then," Dad said, flashing Peter his
“Tony!” Steve snaps, cringing as that pained look crosses Tony’s face again.  But in the two-plus years that he’s been living in this century, he’s already heard enough of Tony’s self-deprecating diatribes to fill three lifetimes, and he’s definitely
Because not only had Howard’s obsession with Steve destroyed his entire family, it was now also attempting to destroy the very root of his obsession.
“Um…” tearing his eyes away from Papa’s image, Peter checked the monitor.  “His heart and respiratory rates are elevated like he’s stressed, but other than that he’s okay.”
It was his healing factor, working overtime to try and keep him whole, and just now losing the battle.
They made more small talk through the rest of their meal, including dessert—a chocolate soufflé something-or-other that Steve had wanted to order—and coffee. It was very relaxing and romantic, and after the stress of the Registration Act and the MAUDE experiments, Tony was immensely grateful for it.
"Yeah, that makes sense." Papa had told Peter a bunch of stories about all the trouble he'd had adjusting to his new body, including one time when he’d misjudged a corner so badly while running that he’d ended up crashing right through the plate-glass window of a clothing store.
"Oh, really?" Steve asked, grinning wickedly as he did it again, this time going even slower and deeper. "You think so, huh?"
“Oh God, Tony, I love you,” Steve rushed out.  “I love you so much!”
two more times, the 100-metre freestyle is announced.  Steve stays put in his chair as the rest of the swimmers file out of the room, rubbing his aching shoulder as soon as he’s alone.  He knows he’ll be asking a lot of it over the next couple of days, but with how much he’s been babying it for the last three months—and how much that babying has cost—he’s hoping that it will come through for him this one last time.
"Yeah, hon, I know." Tony winked as he tapped the device on his wrist, activating his helmet. "I'll see ya soon."
"No, he's not." Peter chewed on his bottom lip, his guilt sitting like a giant lead ball inside his stomach. "It must've been something that they put on his workstation. Some monitoring program that would've picked up anything new that he added."
But then tears filled his eyes, and he slumped down so low in the chair that he almost slid completely off.
"Copy that, JARVIS." Steve stuffed the rest of his protein bar into his mouth as he readied his finger over the trigger.
"It'll only be for training, bud, just so you're aware," Tony said carefully. "Papa and I's stance on that hasn't changed. I'm even gonna keep it stored up at the Compound since that should be the only place you're ever gonna need it, but—"
Carrying the food and water back into the living room, Steve found Natasha sitting on the arm of one of the couches warily eyeing Scott, who was sitting so close to the edge of a cushion that Steve was surprised he hadn't slid off.
“Gotta say, I do enjoy that giddy optimism of yours,” he says, his voice just a touch lighter than before.  “Even when it’s being ridiculous.”
"Yeah." Tony got to his feet, carefully tucking the drawing on top of his pile of papers. "It's never gonna leave my sight, honey."
"Uh huh," said Peter. "I love you too, Papa."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I agree, which is why I think you and I should take a trip down to D.C.," Rhodey said. "I need to check back in with the Pentagon anyway, and the Stark Industries building is secure enough to keep HYDRA off our backs, isn't it?"
Despite his grandfather's best efforts to just heal his messed-up heart and lungs with the serum, Peter was now officially an enhanced human like Papa, with the heightened strength, senses, and appetite to prove it.
“Okay, so… it looks like everything’s good here with the documents, so unless someone’s got something else to add, I don't know ‘bout the rest of you, but I’m ready to get this whole shakedown thing over with.”
Tony breathed in, his lips twitching into a smile. "It's perfect, buddy," he said softly. "When I see Colonel Phillips tomorrow I'll let him know that we can go ahead with the construction."
Steve winced as James's words reverberated around in his head, like one of the silly bouncy balls Peter and Pietro liked to play with up at the Compound. Peter would bounce the ball as hard as he could against the wall of the training dome, counting the seconds until Pietro could catch it, the two of them laughing the entire time.
"Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit!" Dad snapped. "So what're you hassling us for?"
"Yeah, I already know that, Dad," Peter said, rather smugly. "So, with the vibranium powering the arc reactors the satellites would pretty much be able to run forever as long as they were in standby mode most of the time, which they would be if we were only gonna use them as a weapons system. But since we're not, then we're gonna need…" He paused, turning to a page in his notebook where he had drawn a perfect rendition of the very cube that lay at the centre of all the controversy surrounding Howard Stark.
And good for him, since the Aminacin had caused most of the people who took it to explode, and almost ended up killing Dad.
"Yes, sir," said Ned. "We got it."
And losing his son, and having to watch as his husband slowly faded into complete catatonic madness definitely qualified as getting knocked down, didn't it?
He was compromised, and a compromised Captain was never good. Especially when they were dealing with HYDRA.
The bell rang then, indicating the end of the lunch period. Peter quickly shoved the rest of his orange slices into his mouth as he gathered up his backpack and tray and followed Ned out of the lunchroom, heading towards their History class.
"Yeah, hon, I get it," Tony whispered, his eyes crinkling as he attempted a smile. "You know I do."
"Yeah, but surviving's not the same as living," said Tony. A soft smile spread across his lips as he remembered Mr Jarvis telling him something similar the day he turned seventeen. "Which is why as soon as Pete's better, the three of us are gonna move out to that cabin on the lake and start doing some living. Yeah?"
"I don't—" Tony broke off, glaring towards Natasha who was standing next to one of the computer stations, the screen covered in the Cyrillic letters of the Russian alphabet. "What'd you find?"
And then, once Steve has his two more gold medals in hand, he can walk away with honour at the top of his sport, just like he’s always wanted.
Was this finally it? Was this the actual universe they had been searching for? The one where everyone, their entire team, was there, together on the battlefield, preparing for Thanos to arrive? Despite all of his efforts to the contrary, Steve's focus during the Battle of Wakanda had been horribly split, as his worry for Tony and Peter's safety had been nearly crippling.
"Yeah, the stones only work with his fist closed!" added Quill. "Gotta keep it open!"
Ultimately Steve knew it really wasn't any of his business, but yet he couldn't help but wonder.
“All right, honey,” Dad said as he kissed Papa’s hand.  “Then that’s what we’re gonna do.”
"Это не работает!" one the Winter Soldiers said. "Он борется с этим!"
"And normally that would be fine," Natasha said. "But Thor seems pretty worried about this, so I'm wondering if you don't want to try and wake Tony up yourself so we can get going. Clint said he can join us whenever you're ready."
"Oh my God," Steve whispered, dropping his head. "No, no, no, this can't be happening. This can't be happening!"
"So, was all this stuff just hiding out somewhere all this time?" Tony suddenly blurted out. "'Cause I gotta say, I can't believe there were only ever two doses of it made, so—"
"Seems easy enough," said Natasha.
Scott's jaw opened and closed. "Well… yeah, I know—of course I know that, but—"
"Then just spit it out already," Tony snapped. "Is it about Pete?"
“Yes, Mr Stark?”
“God,
"Captain Rogers, I'm afraid that I must interrupt," Dr Strange cut in. "We need your help, you and the rest of your team, and there is no time to waste."
Obie huffed, his lips twitching like he was trying to think of more to say.
"She's doing just fine, sir," Steve answered. "Thank you for asking."
Steve let out a rather cheeky grin. "Or something." He grabbed Tony's left hand, kissing his finger over his wedding ring. "I don't buy jewellery like this for just anyone, you know."
Peter rolled his eyes, slumping down into the seat. "Not likely."
"Tony! Are you all right?" Steve cried as soon as he opened the door, because of course Steve would instantly know that he was upset. He was halfway off the bed too, as if he'd thought he was going to go looking for Tony or something.
Peter shrugged as he launched his backpack at the living room couch, cringing when it sailed right over the back and hit the floor.  “Um… just be yourself?  I know it sounds cheesy, but you're a lot more fun to be around when you're not acting like Obie.”
Steve visibly flinched at the sound of Peter's name, and Tony reached for his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "All right. And you still say it'll take another day before we can transfer this information to the Tower?"
Peter thought. Typical Papa, always looking out for everyone's health except his own.
"I want to see your initial reports on my desk before tomorrow's briefing!" Phillips yelled over the loudspeaker. "Dismissed!"
"Yeah," Tony said, a bit more sharply this time. He had absolutely no business standing there ogling a pilot while his son was in the hospital fighting for his life, no matter what shade of blue his eyes were or how broad his shoulders were or how his jaw looked like it was strong enough to cut glass.
"Oh boy," muttered Gamora.
"C'mon, Spider-Man, c'mon Spider-Man!" he grunted, his muscles straining against the thick glass and solid steel of the window, finally working it open enough to squeeze through just as another sentry suit passed behind him.
A single tear rolled down Peter's cheek, freezing in place on his upper lip as he nodded.
Peter swiped at his watery eyes, so flabbergasted he could barely form words. He'd been ramping himself up for an argument, and now he didn't quite know what to do. "Uhh, when did this happen? Wait, you know what? Nevermind. I guess it doesn't really matter when. Um… thanks! I—I really—I mean, thanks, Papa."
"Yeah, hon, we're all good up here," Tony answered, breathing out a sharp sigh of relief when he noticed both Rhodey and Sam flying towards him. "We're all good."
"Yes, sir," Steve said as he entered the vast office space, sweeping past the private who served as Phillips's secretary with a brief salute before making his way into Phillips's inner office.
"Here, little guy," he said quietly. "These should help."
"Mr Tony Stark?" the woman asked as he approached. "Captain Steve Rogers?"
It was real, though. Apparently the many-worlds interpretation had been spot on.
"You said you had news about Liz's dad?" Peter cut in.
Tony cursed as he swerved yet again, trying to compensate for the power fallout in his left boot as he aimed the last of his arm missiles at the back of the Hammer suit in front of him.
"The tall, strapping guy that you are now," Tony finished. He gave Steve's hand a light squeeze. "And then you thought you needed to change your personality to match, hmm?"
Steve swallows his sigh before it can escape.  “I wasn't joking, Tony, and you know it,” he says as he lays back down, pillowing his head on his arm like he has a hundred times before.  “Wake me in an hour, okay?”
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t hesitate to leave me a comment!
"Well, no," he said slowly. "But they are on their way, so—"
"O-kay," Tony said slowly. "But I gotta say, you're starting to scare me a bit, so—"
expected to find himself watching as he and the rest of the team fought in the Battle of Wakanda, the very battle that had ended with Thanos snapping his fingers.
With a quick shake of his head, Tony moved to his closet, searching for something to wear that wasn't either wrinkled or dirty as he tried to reign himself in. Steve had seemed like the perfect gentlemen the previous night when he'd asked Tony out but he was still an Air Corps pilot, which meant that Tony needed to keep his guard up until he knew without a doubt that he could trust him.
"Oh, just making sure," said Tony. "Maybe you can convince Papa here to go get himself some food then, hmm?"
"Well, well, well. It's nice to finally meet you, Captain Rogers," said an older, grey-haired man wearing a white lab coat as he and a young woman with long red hair arrived outside the transparent window of Steve's cell. While three entire walls of the barely five metre by five metre cell were composed of solid concrete at least a metre thick, the entire front appeared to be a window. But despite its glass-like appearance, it was clearly made from a material that was not glass, as Steve was pretty sure that he had busted a couple of knuckles the one time he had attempted to punch through it.
"Really?" Peter squeaked. He cleared his throat, very aware that his face was likely the same colour as his father's armour. "I mean, yeah! That sounds awesome!"
"Um… Sir Bucky?" Gwen asked. "Do I wanna know?"
"Well," Steve said after a short pause. "Then that's good. Thank you, Director."
"And why is that, Colonel?" he demanded, riding a sudden surge of either bravery or stupidity, he wasn't quite sure. "What's in those files that they don't want me to know?"
"It's a go," Steve said, tightening his grip on his shield. "King T'Challa and his warriors will be our backups."
"Uh huh," Peter said softly, his throat tight with tears he was trying to contain. He hadn't wanted to say anything, mainly because there wasn't anything that Papa could do about it, but the fact that he could still remember bits and pieces of his drug-induced dreams where Dad was dead haunted him. Aldrich Killian had forced all three of them to believe that one or the other was dead while they were being held captive down in Miami, but only Peter was able to retain those memories after they were given the antidote. No one knew exactly why his mind refused to let go of those horrible images, other than the fact that he was a child and had been given an earlier version of the drug before, back in Afghanistan.
Phillips gave a single nod, jerking his head in Anthony's direction. "Good. Now, you will all turn your complete attention to Mr Stark while he runs through a few final details. Mr Stark?"
he reminds himself.
"Say, buddy, I've got something else to tell you if that's okay."
But even despite the outward lack of evidence, Steve had already been contacted by both Nick Fury and Pepper Potts, warning him that the team would have to hold a press conference once they returned home, if for no other reason than to simply reassure the public that the Avengers had eliminated the threat and that they were all still alive. To that end, Natasha, Clint, and the twins had already returned to the Compound so the twins could finish out their senior year of high school, and Bruce had left for the Tower just the day before, after taking a couple of days to de-Hulk with Thor's help.
“There's nothing down here to watch for.  And besides, you are injured, and I am not,” Tony says slowly, like he’s talking to a very small child.  “Therefore, you need the rest.  End of story.”
And the last thing that Steve was aware of was the sound of heavy footsteps crunching along the rocky path, right before he felt a burning hot
"I gotcha, babe," Tony replied a second later, followed by the unmistakable sound of his repulsors. "Asshole thought he could hide behind a rock, now that's not very dignified, is it?"
leave them the hell alone.
"Hold on, Joe, I've almost got him on missile lock!" shouted Chester Phillips, Joseph's other wingman as he flew past Joseph's left wing, ducking down underneath to come out behind him. Three seconds later another explosion rocked the aircraft, and Joseph watched through his canopy as the enemy plane impacted against the mountain in a burst of brilliant fireball.
But he was cut off by Tony's armoured fingers pressing across his lips as he leaned in so close that the metal of his helmet brushed against Steve's nose. "Yes, you goddamn
Peter let out a soft giggle. "Well, that's 'cause it did. But I don't think that one should count."
Not surprisingly, Peter's girlfriend, Gwen, was waiting for him by the doors when they pulled up next to the school. Tony had told Steve that she had been instrumental in helping to narrow down the location of the hidden HYDRA bunker, managing to decipher a series of coded HYDRA files that Peter had decrypted after his disappearance during their end-of-year dance. Peter had intended to search for Steve on his own, believing that since he was the only person on the team who could see through the retro-reflective panels that lined the outside of the bunker, that he would have a better chance at infiltrating it without being discovered.
" Tony whimpered, his blunt fingernails digging into Steve's shoulders as he started to move, starting with just gentle rocks of his hips. "
you look like you're ready to take on the world, so… how ‘bout we go get this over with, hmm?  Then we can go grab Pete from school and take it easy the rest of the day.”
"All right," Steve said after a short pause. "Go ahead and tell them they can come in."
The young woman—Wanda, the doctor had called her, who didn't look much older than Peter—gave a nod, stepping back as Doctor List took a slim metal device from his pocket and touched it to the window, opening a hole just large enough for Wanda's hand to slip through.
Tony sucked in a deep breath. He had been hoping for just a quick introduction, thinking he would have plenty of time to actually get to know Sarah Rogers once Project Phoenix was over and Peter had recovered from his operation. But Tony supposed that since she had agreed to take over Peter's rather intensive medical care before even meeting either of them, he could grant her the courtesy of one dinner.
Six brand-spankin-new X-302 aircrafts, all just waiting in the hangar back at the base for the pilots lucky enough to get to try them out, and costing an upwards of thirty million credits.
"We should've started here," he added. "This place is so big, I should've realised—"
"Yeah, I know. But are you
He could build all of the tech that he wanted, but not even his most advanced drones or suits or nanites could deal with anything having to do with time, and it was starting to make Tony feel like he was slowly being backed into a two-sided triangle, stuck in a corner while facing down an invisible army against which he had no defence.
"See?" said Peter. "Piece of cake."
A second later the equations scrolled across Tony's screen, displaying the exact coordinates that the team members would need to calculate their anchor points in the tunnel. Tony glanced up at Bruce once it was fully displayed, trying to gauge his reaction.
"Huh?" replied Quill, looking up from where he and Gamora were huddled together a few metres away. "What'd you say, Mr Man?"
"And? Anything changed that I should know about?"
Like the Stacys.
"Птер, Гвен, you need to come with me," said Uncle Bucky as he yanked them both towards the emergency exit near the front of the auditorium. But they had only taken a couple of steps before the monster roared again and turned, blocking their path as it absorbed the lit Exit sign. It looked like it had nearly doubled in size in just the few seconds that Peter's back was turned, and was now so big that it filled almost half the auditorium.
Tony glowered at him a few more seconds, pursing his lips. "About a week to manufacture enough for both here and the Compound. We'll need about twice as many for the Compound to cover the whole area, so…"
He also couldn't wait to see the look on Peter's face once he saw them together.
"No, I don't," Steve said. "Which only makes it even funnier."
A violent shudder rocks Tony’s body, prompting Steve to tighten his arm around him.
"But I'm gonna be worried about you now until you can call tonight," Gwen said once she released him. "I've never seen you like this before."
Even so… that still didn't help all that much.  Not unless Peter could figure out a way to—
"Unfortunately there's not much to do for mono besides supportive care, as I'm sure you're aware, being as intelligent as you are," Tony said. "And Pete was sick for over a month the last time he had this, so… I know it sucks, but there's really nothing else we can do about it."
Unfortunately, Steve could now understand where she was coming from. He had only known Peter for a few months, and yet it was still so unbelievably hard for him to have to leave Peter there in that hospital bed every single night, all alone, with only a notebook and his monitors for company.
And while he was better now, according to Sam, Steve knew he would never be able to be truly rid of everything he had experienced, which was why it was so important for him to keep working at it.
"So, where're your dads now?" Ned asked as they took their seats. “They still in Iceland?"
"Yeah, Sam, I know that." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. "I honestly don't know what the hell I would do without this team," he said softly. "If it was just me, I'd've already tried to—but I don't—I just don't know if—"
"Well, maybe you shouldn't've waited till the lights were off to finish getting ready!" Bucky retorted. "C'mon, Steve, I figured you'd have a better plan than that!"
"Copy that, hon." Toggling the final switch into place, Tony shot Steve one of his signature smirks. "Going quantum in three… two… one…"
"Yep, I'm ready," he said. "Let's go."
"Yeah, but…" Steve tore off part of the sandwich as he let out a heavy sigh. It seemed like such a stupid thing to hide, now that he thought about it. It's not like Bucky didn't already know that Steve had a sentimental side.
Steve let out a heavy sigh, tipping his head back against the tub. "I hate that it's come to this. How can we have any semblance of a normal life if we're to the point where we need reconnaissance over our own home? Peter deserves better than this, Tony. We all do."
It had been eight years, ten months, and thirteen days since the last time Tony had felt anything more than a fleeting attraction for someone, but really, who was counting?
"C'mon, Buck," Steve murmured as he pulled up with all his might, the burning canopy searing right through the fabric of his gloves and into his skin. "C'mon, Bucky, don't die on me now! Not now!" He let out an agonising grunt of pain as the canopy slid about a centimetre, just barely enough for him to get his fingertips down a bit deeper. "C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
"Aren't you gonna try and sleep, Papa?" he asked after a short pause. He knew Dad had been up pacing the hallways again the night before, and that Papa had joined him at some point, so he had to be just as tired.
"What's his name?" Phillips cut in. "The kid? What's his name?"
Strange's head snapped back in surprise. "Your son?" he asked, narrowing his eyes at Peter. "What the hell is he doing here?"
There was just constant, unrelenting grief. Gnawing. Aching. Chipping away at him, piece by tiny piece.
In fact, Tony was fairly certain that their last three or four dates hadn't consisted of much more than two or three long makeout sessions broken up by a few minutes of snack time.
created it,” Tony said proudly.  “The Stark Relief Foundation was all Pete’s idea, and—”
Steve huffed, tears burning his scratchy eyes as he looked away. Sam had always told him that he needed to talk through his 'stuff', as he'd called it, to get it out there in the open, or else it would just build up inside him, festering and fermenting until Steve did something stupid.
"Hi," Peter said, only slightly wobbly. "I'm Peter."
"Uncle Bucky!" Peter shrieked, jumping back as lava-like flames suddenly shot up through the cracks in the floor, twirling as they rose up higher and higher until they had formed what could only be described as some sort of horrible fire demon.
As usual, Peter was able to read Tony's mind. "It's not only about me, Dad, remember? This is about everyone. This is about our planet being freed from a war that's lasted for generations. It's so much bigger than me."
"All right," Tony said. "Then let's get started."
"What?" Blaster Guy cut in, incredulous. "
"Me too." Gwen took his hand as she pushed the exit door open to find Mr Stacy already there, sitting in his unmarked patrol car.
“I’ll be back in the morning, Ashes,” Steve said as he carefully set her down, petting her back as she dove into her food.  “You keep a good watch over the place for me, okay?”
As Steve's legs finally decided to stabilise underneath him, he gave the immediate area a quick once-over. Thor was also there, completely shell-shocked as he stared at the spot where Thanos had disappeared.
Picking up his pencil, Steve quickly became so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice Peter entering the kitchen until he said, "Good morning," startling Steve so badly that he almost knocked over his chair.
.”  Peter had thought the name was clever when he’d first noticed it, and it sounded even more so now.  “And it’s a used bookstore, so there’s probably some really cool stuff in there.”
"We don't know that for sure," Steve said quickly, his heart jumping as he saw Tony fly by with Peter still crouched on his back. "Just… right now we need to concentrate on taking out as many of the Chitauri as we can. We've done it before, and we can do it again."
"But Dr Strange already said he won't do it!" Peter cut in. "So you're really just wasting your breath by arguing with him!"
“Copy that,” Tony says softly.
"Mmm," muttered Tony as he grabbed hold of his tablet. "JARVIS?"
"Um… yeah," Peter said, stamping down the guilt welling deep inside his belly as he grabbed his jacket. "Ah… thanks."
He also wants to ask if the hundred dollars a week is gonna be okay too, but figures if Dad doesn’t seem phased by it, then he shouldn’t either.
"Got it. Hold onto your socks." Tony held his breath as his targeting system let out a faint
Especially since Tony was going to be stuck on the ground trying to coordinate the mission pretty much by himself. Even with Colonel Phillips there with him, Steve did not want Tony in any more danger than was absolutely necessary. Once he and Carol made it through the atmospheric barrier and out into space they would be relatively safe, their only concern being to ensure that the tesseract and the satellites were deployed correctly. The real battles would be taking place in Langaran airspace and on Langaran soil, making proper support and protection a necessity. Aside from Tony and Peter's safety, there were potentially going to be a lot of frightened civilians once everything began, and Steve absolutely did not want to cause a panic.
"Pete, it's not that simple—"
"Nope. Neither can I, and neither could Pete," Tony said. "It would bring an end to over seventy years of war."
“Tony!” Steve gasped once Tony was fully sheathed, his breaths coming in stuttered gasps as he gripped Tony’s hips.  “You—you feel—Tony, oh my
Peter thought, his heart starting to thud. He pressed his palm over his chest, begging his stupid heart to behave itself for once. The last thing he needed was one of his monitors to start going off and halt the conversation.
, another thing he’d had to add on earlier that day following a mishap with a harried young mother and her overtired toddler, and
"What?" Steve said, gasping as the pain in his hands and feet suddenly ramped up to almost unbearable levels. He looked over at Tony, trying to blink away the shimmering halos surrounding his glasses as Tony carefully guided him to the ground, wrapping him in his arms.
Steve also seemed to love being outside, judging by the various drawings in his book, yet another thing he had in common with Peter. There were several drawings of various trees and flowers, a couple of the ballfield where they'd had most of their picnics, a few of the X-301 and X-302 aircrafts, and one portrait of an older woman whom Tony guessed was Steve's mother. Tony's smile widened as he pictured the two of them sitting there on the bank of that lake that he loved, their two heads bent towards the other as they sketched whatever caught their fancy while he worked on whatever project caught his.
A leap that Tony still hadn't let him hear the end of.
So either someone in Meridia got really freaking lucky with their aim—which was almost statistically impossible, based on Peter's calculations—or somehow their military found out about the mission.
It took almost three hours for the doctors to clear all the burnt remnants of Steve's gloves and boots from his damaged skin, soaking and re-soaking his hands and feet in a solution that smelled remarkably like oranges, for some strange reason. Steve had experienced minor burns in the past, while cooking or when he'd stayed outside in the sun for a bit too long, but they hadn't been anything like this. While the doctors worked it was all he could do to keep from whimpering, biting his bottom lip so hard that Tony had to work it loose from his teeth multiple times, warning him that he was going to draw blood if he didn't let go. Fluids and pain medicine flowed into two separate intravenous lines in his arms, but since the medical staff didn't quite understand Steve's increased metabolic requirements the medicine barely was able to take the edge off the pain, prompting Tony at one point to demand that the doctors increase his dosage.
"Don't you think these things kinda look like the speeders in Star Wars?" Bucky asked from Steve's side, his rifle clutched firmly in his hands.
The ring—a simple white gold band inlaid with three small stones, one blue stone flanked with two red stones—was absolutely
thing a few times when I've been trying to reach my phone," Peter admitted. "The look on my dad's face was pretty funny, I think he thought I was speaking in tongues or something."
that it made sending a violent shiver down Tony's spine. Steve jumped and gritted his teeth but was otherwise silent, likely because he didn't want Peter to see that he was in pain.
"Okay, that all kinda sucks, but what does it have to do with anything?" asked Carol.
have the operation that he so desperately needed, the very operation he should've had way back when the doctors first discovered the problems with his heart. Problems that had grown steadily worse with every single one of his growth spurts.
"Then what seems to be the problem?" O'Brien asked, downing the rest of his whisky.
“Which is why we need to finish the grant,” Steve says.  “I’d like to send it on to Nike by this afternoon, is that enough time?”
Steve gave a nod, downing the last of his superwater before gathering up all of their wrappers and tossing them into the wastebin. Then he got to his feet, pulling Tony up with him and curling his right arm around his waist, his left hand tucking Tony's right hand against his chest as Tony's left hand fell into place on Steve's arm. Steve pressed his cheek to Tony's forehead as they gently swayed to the music, closing his eyes as he revelled in their closeness.
"Yeah, and all that's even weirder when you realise that that very same government just dumped Uncle Bucky like a hot potato, just 'cause he got hurt," grumbled Peter.
But unfortunately, at the moment he still needed to figure out a way to get to the bathroom and back without causing a scene.
that might possibly help. Say he was sorry for not staying on the stupid bus, sorry for not going home when Dad tried to send him. Sorry for thinking he could actually be an Avenger when he was still "just a kid".
"Miss Stacy has not given a specific reason for her call, Master Peter, but I would assume that she is merely concerned for your welfare," JARVIS said. "She does sound quite worried."
Maria Stark hadn't even been home at the time, having left Tony in the care of one of Howard's SHIELD colleagues, Mr Edwin Jarvis, a man who had been honourably discharged from the Langaran army due to an injury and to whom Tony would eventually grow so attached that when he passed away almost fifteen years later, Tony felt as though he had lost the only father who had ever truly loved him. It was as if Mr Jarvis had been sent by the gods themselves for how much he cared for Tony, teaching him everything from how to ride a bike—"
Whatever was left of Steve, he knew that Tony and Peter loved him.  Accepted him as half the man he’d thought he could be.
"Nah, I'm not," murmured Tony. "Gives me some more time to look at your gorgeous face."
"Would you want to go with me?" Peter asked, almost without thinking, which was apparently the exact right thing to say when Gwen squeaked, bursting into an excited smile.
“Okay.  And you just didn't tell me about this… why, exactly?” Tony asked.  “What about all the people we’ve got working in that division?”
“Well…” Peter said again, glancing up at Steve.  “I wasn't trying to brag, but—”
"Yes," Steve rasped, shuddering even harder when Tony did it again. "Tony!"
"Yes, sir," Tony said. He quickly gathered up his papers, tucking them under his arm as he hurried from the hangar.
"And so… you decided to try and burn off your skin?" Tony said warily, backing away when Steve tried to kiss him.
"I understand perfectly, Captain," said T'Challa. "As someone who has recently been through a rather difficult time myself, please allow me to sympathise with you and your son, Mr Stark. Dare I say that you were both able to emerge from that terrible experience stronger than you were before?"
Tony gave him a proud smile.  “Yeah, he’s the best.  Sure as hell don't know where he gets it, but I definitely lucked out with him.  I tell ya what, though, I am sure glad he discovered that store of yours.  It’s good that he’s got somewhere to go after school where I don't have to worry about what he’s doing or who he’s hanging out with.”
Didn't they?
A loud groan of pain and fear worked its way up from Steve’s lungs, only to jam in his throat, resulting in a brief coughing fit that left tears streaming down his face by the time it was over.
“JARVIS, you think you could find me a backdoor into Pierce’s secure SHIELD files?”
Peter grinned, attempting a nonchalant shrug. "Well… maybe. I'm sure having you as a dad didn't hurt too much in that area."
"My mom's dead," Peter said shortly. He looked down at his plate, breathing in and out slowly and very much aware of both Gwen and Mr Stacy's eyes on him. "I never met her."
The scan began again, panning from south to north this time. Peter yawned as he watched the waves breaking against the shoreline, pinching himself every time his eyelids got heavy.
"Yeah, but these guys seem to have some pretty advanced stuff, and Quill did say he was half-god," replied Peter. "Maybe they'll be able to help us too."
"Ah," Tony murmured, nodding. In the three weeks since Scott had showed up on their doorstep, both he and Steve and they and the rest of the team had had numerous discussions about the fact that they were basically "playing God", for lack of a better term.
The shield that had failed to win him the battle against Thanos. Failed to keep his son from dying in Tony's arms.
"Eh, I wouldn't count on that!" Cam said as he took out yet another surface-to-air missile. "You know Phillips doesn't like telling us anything until it's only like two days before!"
He was in that sort of weird stage between sleep and not-quite-sleep when he heard someone knock on his door.
"So we just have to figure out where our timeline branched off, and then go back to just before that specific point," finished Steve. He shot Tony a quick smile. "Isn't that right?"
But even as he said it, he knew it was too late. Tony was already skidding to a stop in front of Thanos, already reaching his armoured hands towards the gauntlet, as if he were trying to pull it off Thanos' arm. With a furious growl, Thanos yanked the gauntlet away, backhanding Tony into a big pile of debris several metres away. Steve's panicked cry of alarm caught in his throat as Thanos sneered in triumph before raising his left arm, preparing to snap his fingers.
From the battlefield behind him, Steve suddenly heard screams, each one piercing his body like a spear.
If not right away, when Steve tried to brush off the rather icy shoulder Ma offered Brock as just her getting used to Steve being gay, then he at least should’ve gotten a clue later on, before things spiralled as badly as they did.
Tony's fingers tightened on Steve's arm, his jaw clenched and his blunt nails digging into Steve's skin. "I said
Little Steve murmured as he checked the bright red handwritten price stickers in the upper right-hand corners. The sketchbook was five cents and the pencils were ten, which meant that he could buy—
Not three heartbeats later, Steve hears the telltale
“Think you’ve found a good one there, Rhodey,” Tony murmured to Rhodey as Happy and Carol dragged Obie from the office, still spewing his nonsense.  “I’m happy for you.”
And with the final preparations for Project Phoenix on the line, being less stressed would only help matters.
"Oh, Pete," he whispered as a single tear snaked down his cheek. "I really wish you could've met him. He would've loved you so much."
“All right, so I’m thinking we should let Papa rest for a bit while we look over these results, Pete,” Dad said.  “And then, I’m thinking we should celebrate by going out to lunch, yeah?”
"It's all right," Steve said quickly. "Don't worry—"
Because, like it or not, there was no way Peter could just sit by and watch his family suffer through yet another massive fight threat hanging over their heads. Not when he'd almost lost his Papa during the last one.
Tony thought, smirking slightly.
"Yep," Quill answered, holding out his left palm. "Held the Power Stone right in this hand. Boy, did that hurt like hell! It also almost ripped me apart until Gamora, Drax, and Rocket grabbed onto me."
"Have emergency services been notified?" he demanded as he tried in vain to blink the circles away.
“No, Obie, that’s exactly where you are wrong,” Tony said quietly.  He was barely clinging to his temper at this point, but he knew they were almost there.  “You thought that since you are who you are that you could do whatever the hell you wanted and never get caught.  Well, you know what?  There’s a word for that.  Hubris.  And I hate to say it, but you just learned the hardest way possible that hubris never gets you anywhere.  ‘Cause it is a pissy, unforgiving master that takes down its slaves in flames, and
"All right, then I think we'll all get out of your hair," Bruce said, gathering up his multitude of references and papers. "And obviously we'll let you know as soon as we find anything new."
“What he meant to say is, yes,” says Dad.  “We’re here to see Mr Rogers.”
"Yes, sir, I understand, but—"
And right there, about fifty metres away from where the palace had once stood, was the Soul Stone, glinting bright orange in the rubble.
"No, not with either of you." A knot rose in Steve's throat at the memory of the first time he laid eyes on Tony and Peter, sitting there in the middle of that endless desert, the horrible blue colour of Peter's split and cracked lips as he lay completely motionless in Tony's arms, and the heart-stopping panic on Tony's face as he begged Steve to do something,
"We have to do it together, okay?" Steve answered. "That's the only way we'll get through any of this."
"Well, don't just leave him in there, goddamnit!" Tony shouted after about three more heartbeats. "Get him out!"
Peter's head whipped up mid-shred, his eyes widening in shock.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony mumbled, rolling his eyes as he shoved his glasses onto his face. "What the hell do they want now?"
He trailed off, looking up at Tony. "You were right though. Based on what my source was able to find we've got over twice the amount of vibranium that's currently reported in the official records."
"See, I told you he was just sleeping—" Howard started, his mouth snapping closed when Tony shoved past him and into the living room, grabbing the telephone.
Just like he couldn't deny Steve taking charge now, even as he'd planned to spoil him that morning instead of the other way around. Again.
They laid there for awhile, just clinging to each other's sticky, sweat-soaked bodies with their hearts beating in tandem. Tony was so relaxed and sated that by the time Steve kissed him on the cheek and rolled him onto his side, he had nearly fallen asleep. He winced as Steve gently pulled out of him, then gathered him into his arms and carried him into their shower, washing his hair and body with the same reverence he'd just displayed during their lovemaking.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"That's a good boy," Grandma murmured. She smoothed the hair from Peter's forehead, carefully cupping his cheek. "Let's get your teeth brushed, all right?"
"Shh," Gwen said as she brushed her fingers across Peter's lips. "It's not Spider-Man that I'm gonna miss, Peter."
"I'm a survivor," Thanos said plainly.
"Guidance systems show no errors, sir," JARVIS answered a few seconds later.
he thought as he breathed in another deep breath, trying to saturate his senses with as much of Steve's essence as he could. With how well the simulator sessions were proceeding, Tony was certain that Phillips would announce the trial missions within the next few days, and once those were completed and successful and Tony managed to build the containment vessel for the tesseract… hopefully everything would be fine.
And hopefully all of that, plus the three woolen blankets he was huddling under and the hot cocoa he was drinking, would be enough to get them through the fireworks show, ringing in yet another new year.
Likely the same fate that awaited anyone who dared to challenge Thanos and lose.
"Oh, that sounds nice!" Peter said. He had been feeling pretty
"No, I guess you wouldn't've," Tony forced past the lump in his throat. While he supposed it was possible that he and Steve would've run into each other at some point after he was found in the Arctic ice, they probably wouldn't have been thrown together in such a way that would've led to Peter latching onto Steve like a baby koala, paving the way for Tony to fall head over heels for a man he'd always believed he despised.
Thor looked taken aback as the Quinjet touched down. "I do not snore. In fact—"
"No, little guy," Papa said, a split-second too late. "Why would we—?"
Shooting another guard away as he approaches the perimeter of the building, Steve runs around to where Tony is hovering near a large window, his ears picking up some kind of low-pitched humming noise.
The thought of there being universes out there where they weren't together, or hadn't even met, did not sit well with him.
"I don't think I know what that is anymore," Tony said, nearly cracking Steve's heart in two. "It's been so long since—"
Strange practically sneered, only raising Tony's blood pressure more. "If we weren't moving at approximately two hundred times the speed of light, then yes, I could. But the amount of force required to connect the portal is too high to maintain it long enough to safely make it through."
"Agent Romanoff is inquiring if you would like her to stop by the floral shop on her way home with Master Peter," said JARVIS. "To order Miss Stacy's corsage for the dance?"
Gorgeous moodboard created by adoctoraday, thank you so much! ♥️ ♥️
"Goodnight, little guy," Steve whispered. "I love you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay, and that's a bad thing, why?" asked Sam.
"Yeah?"
Instead of answering Tony reached for his shoulders, pulling him down for a deep, sloppy kiss.
Steve thought, squeezing his eyes closed as another starburst of pain shot up his left leg to his knee. His foot felt like it had been stomped on by something heavy and metal, which didn't make too much sense since he couldn't remember encountering anything metal that could take steps, but given that this was HYDRA, Steve wasn't putting anything past them.
"Honey, if Fury said whatever the hell this was isn't an Avengers-level threat, then why are you watching it?" he asked. "You know it's just gonna make it harder for you to get to sleep. And don't you try and give me that big song and dance about how you don't need as much sleep as me, 'cause you know it's just a bunch of bullshit."
They nearly tripped over each other in their mad scramble to escape the lounge chair, with Steve grabbing onto Tony's waist once they were upright, practically carrying him inside the villa to their bedroom. As soon as the door was closed and locked behind them he turned towards Tony, backing him up against the wall.
"Haha, very funny," Steve rasped as he wiped the tears from his eyes, trying to clear his throat.
"Are you ready to go check out the telescope now?" he asked as they gathered up their dishes. "I thought we could take some hot chocolate up there with us."
To which Tony's eyes responded,
he thought, almost chuckling at the ridiculousness of it.
"Shall I commence with rendering, sir?" JARVIS asked. "I do believe the diagnostics with the physical nanites will take several days."
"Yes, I am," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "If you've got information, then I'll take it."
The waver was back in Tony's voice again, and Steve kicked himself for asking something that obviously hit a bit too close to home. From what Steve had been able to gather through his extensive research and from Colonel Phillips's carefully constructed non-answers, Tony had been essentially drafted by the Air Corps before he was sent to university with the express expectation that he would do whatever the government leaders asked of him.
Turns out, thanks to the security cameras that covered the parking garage, Obie had found out about Steve, making Pepper the unfortunate recipient of one of the worst tantrums he had ever thrown in his life.  Pepper had confessed that even employees working on nearby floors had overheard Obie’s rant, with many wondering why in the world he was so upset about the fact that Tony was dating someone.
"That sounds great, little guy," said Papa. "I can't wait.
"Yeah, I was afraid of that," Tony muttered. "But without the tesseract would the project still be able to go forth using its original parameters?"
"Yeah, right. No one's gonna be dumb enough to pass on you, and you know it." Peter rolled his eyes as his first attempt at wrangling with his combination lock failed miserably, pursing his lips as he tried again. The hallway behind him was still packed with students yelling every which way, with every single sound scraping across his sensitive ears like one of Uncle Clint's arrowheads. His exhaustion wasn't helping with his eyesight either, but he'd been too distracted that morning to remember where he'd left his glasses and hadn't wanted to bother Papa or Dad about them.
"Which, if I may remind you, sir, is extremely unlikely," JARVIS piped up, sounding rather petulant. "In fact, I estimate the chances of it at less than 0.00000001 percent."
Steve gives a single nod.  “Thanks.  I’ve got a bit to do.”
“Just... don't try to talk now, mo grá, okay?” Steve pleaded. “Not till we get you fixed up.”
“All right.  Go ahead and get into position,” Steve says.  “We’ll move out in three.”
Tony's lips curled into the slightest of smiles. "Yeah, maybe a few."
you feel so incredible," Steve choked out. He slid his arms underneath Tony and pulled him onto his lap, allowing his cock to slip in even further. Tony's chest was heaving by the time Steve was fully sheathed, and he buried his face into Steve's neck, clinging to him for dear life as Steve gripped his hips and began to move him up and down.
"You're more than welcome to try it again if you'd like," said Tony. "We've still got some time."
"Mmm," Steve mumbled, his fingers tightening around Tony's hand. "To tell us that he might know a way that we could—we could fix things."
Quill's eyes went wide as he held up his hands. "Well, actually, I don't even have a son, so there's really no way that you could—"
"You wouldn't," Steve said quickly. "Sorry, I wasn't trying to imply anything. Tony's just really protective of his son, and… I kinda am too."
"Yeah, it's just a hobby," Steve said quickly. He cleared his throat, well aware that his cheeks were about as red as his ma's favourite lipstick. "You know, just something to pass the time in the barracks."
"Good." He pulled back, looking between Dad and Papa. "And the other pilot? How's he doing?"
"Mmm, okay," Gwen said warily. "But you'll let me know if you change your mind, right?"
pacing back and forth, which probably meant that he wasn't ready yet.
Peter was going to be available pretty much the entire summer while Gwen was gone, so all he was asking was to spend as much time with her as possible before she left.
"Goddamnit, Strange, I'm telling you that we need to get going now!" Dad said again, his fingers stroking through Peter's hair. Thanks to the battle—and being strangled—Peter's senses were going completely bonkers, making even Dad's normal conversational voice seem like he was screaming into a bullhorn.
"Good grief, Pete!" Dad exclaimed, rolling his eyes. "You know damn well that I'm never too busy for you! Especially for something as important as that!"
nods as he slipped both hands around his waist. "I've just been thinking… Peter has his school break coming up in about six weeks, so maybe it would be a good time for us to get away for a few days. I thought maybe we could go back to Italy? We've always said that we wanted to take him there sometime, and I know I wouldn't mind going back either, so… what do you think?"
"Yes, yes, I'm sure this is all quite important," Senator Davis cut in. "But as I'm sure you're aware, Mr Stark, our time is both quite limited and quite valuable, so why don't we just get on with it, shall we?"
"But—but—" Blaster Guy sputtered. "How the hell does that dude know my name?"
"Yes, that's definitely something we should start looking into," said Steve. "But first we need to find out where the other stones are."
But he didn't.
"Mmm. Sorry bud."
"Yep! I got ya, buddy!" Screeching to a halt, Tony blasted his repulsors directly into the alien's chest, grinning in satisfaction at the way his body twitched before going still.
"Steady, Pete," Dad said over the comm. "Follow the plan."
"Well, that seems to be the million-dollar question, doesn't it?" Tony retorted, frowning. "But that still doesn't give you permission to insult him."
Peter rolled his eyes. "I finished all of it last night, Dad, you know that."
outside.
"Um, is it okay if I come in?" Rogers asked through the still-closed door.
was the kind of camaraderie they had all managed to forge, despite the Air Corps doing everything it possibly could to keep those types of bonds from forming.
"You go on, I'll be there in a couple minutes," Tony said, planting a quick kiss on the top of Peter's head. "Just wanna double-check a few things first."
As soon as the screen went blank, Peter glanced towards his slightly-cracked door and reopened the document he’d been going over.  He still wasn't sure if he should feel horror or vindication that he had correctly guessed why Dad was being so twitchy about everything, but he supposed it didn't really matter.
"I know," Steve said sadly. "It should only be for a few days."
"That's 'cause he loves you, Tony. Just like I do."
"Nice job, Captain Rogers," Tony said a few seconds later. "You have successfully found your re-entry window."
"No," Tony said, cutting him off with a firm kiss. "Not now babe, okay?"
"So… can we just watch the movie? Please?"
of Sam's Falcon wings. He got to his feet, tucking Peter into a ball right next to him as the armour wrapped around his body.
"Well…" Tony said, trailing off when he realised that he had no argument. After almost four months of marriage, he and Steve's desire for each other hadn't yet waned in the slightest.
And Steve hadn't taken it off once while he'd worked to flush out the remaining embedded HYDRA agents from their foxholes, a feat he had finally deemed successful only a few short weeks before the appearance of Thanos' army.
"All right, good. Tell Happy that as soon as he's gone I'd like him to pack up Beck's office and bring all his stuff up here."
"Ahh, hi," he finally said. "Um… I'm Scott."
"But it was the Winter Soldier who did all that, it wasn't really
“Oh, I do!” Steve said as he drew Tony even closer, releasing his hand to slip his arms around his waist.  “I really do, I just—is it—is it okay if I—if we—?”
"Will do."
"Yes, because Peter is half-god, like he said. But it still nearly ripped us all apart, and that was just one of them," Gamora said grimly. "And like Drax said, Thanos isn't interested in using the stones to better himself. He's only interested in his goal."
he thought desperately. He had no idea what had happened to Papa after he was taken away, but Peter had a bad feeling that it wasn't anything good. Papa was in such rough shape that Peter couldn't understand how he was even still alive, and he knew they had to find him as soon as possible.
Somehow, as if he were deliberately trying to taunt him, Anthony was looking even more handsome than Steve had remembered. He was still dressed in the cadets' uniform of a plain black t-shirt and army green pants, which Steve had noticed him wearing the day before when he'd knocked him over in the hallway, and while the colours weren't usually the most flattering, somehow Anthony managed to make them look absolutely spectacular.
retorted Uncle Bucky.
Stark," O'Brien had sneered. "You are Langara's top civilian scientist, remember?"
Not exactly what anyone would call rational.
"It'll work, Dad," Peter said firmly. "And I'm not the only one who thinks so. Grandpa thinks—"
“Okay.  Care to explain it to someone who doesn't speak technical?”
If nothing else, his back could definitely use the break. Even though the chairs he and Steve had been sitting on for the past week were pretty comfortable, they still weren't a bed.
But since none of the other scientists could corroborate Grandpa's theory—
Lang's jaw dropped to his knees. "Uhh, yeah? I—I guess… yeah. I'm pretty good. Why?"
"Okay, so?" he said once they were seated, pushing another sandwich and a second bottle of superwater towards Steve. "Shoot."
"I know you wouldn't. But—"
"But do you really think Papa's gonna wanna wear one of those thingys on his chest like that?" Peter suddenly asked from behind Tony, causing him to whip around so fast that he nearly tipped over.
“All right, Banner, Stark and I are ready!” he calls.  “You may begin!”
There will be an epilogue posted next Monday that will close out the story 😊
Another noise squeaked its way from Steve's throat, his lips pursing just enough for Tony to notice. Davis was actually going for the jugular, right there in front of God and everyone.
Well, three years ago Tony's first instinct would have been to say he just
Peter’s cheeks flush hot as the assistant smiles and stands to her feet, indicating for them to follow her.  “Of course.  Mr Rogers is waiting for you both in the conference room.”
"I do have something that I need to ask you, sweetheart," he said. "If you don't mind."
Bucky shrugged, giving Steve that sly smile that he had started to see more and more often lately as his memories slowly continued to return, the one that the old Bucky used to give him at least three times a day when they were kids. "Yeah, that is pretty much what you used to do, isn't it." He gave Steve a rather sharp elbow to the side. "But now look atcha."
"See you tomorrow?" Gwen asked as they headed towards Chief Stacy's patrol car, which was parked next to Papa's truck.
"Yeah," Peter said with a chuckle. He cleared his throat, not knowing where the hell this sudden surge of bravery was coming from but deciding to run with it anyway. "I was thinking… there's a movie theatre that's only a block away from your dad's police precinct, right?"
"You got it," Peter said as he squeezed her hand. He didn't dare try to kiss her in front of her father. "I'll call you, okay?"
No matter the mission, the risk that someone wouldn't survive it was always there. Bucky's fall from the train had hammered that lesson home quite well.
Because of course he was.
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," he whispered as tears fell from his eyes, splashing onto Tony's cheeks. "I'm so sorry that I couldn't save you."
"I'm gonna spoil you tonight, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he kissed across Tony's neck and back up to his ear. "You've taken such good care of me lately and spoiled me with this wonderful vacation, it's time for me to take care of you now."
"Oh, ha, ha, ha," Tony said with what he hoped was a playful frown. "I'm just—we don't happen to know the security clearance of any of these people, do we?"
Apparently his gut reaction had been spot on.
"Yeah, which is just fine with me." Peter glanced at the clock, his shoulders sagging when he saw it was already almost three in the morning. But there'd be no way he would have enough time to build a suit and get ready for the dance tomorrow after school, so if he was going to do this, it had to be done now.
"Oh," she said, rubbing her eyes. "I was—I was kinda hoping he'd—that he'd wake up while I was sleeping."
"I'll be sure and let him know," Tony interrupted. "Thank you, Miss Stacy."
"No, it's not fair," Gwen murmured, and a lump rose in Tony's throat at her tone, sweet and kind with absolutely none of the judgement that Peter had faced from a few of his other classmates. "And it doesn't mean that you're weak if you're upset about it either."
“You are!” Tony yelped, gasping as his heart suddenly seized.  He grunted, pressing his palm to his chest.  “Pete,
“So,” Natasha says as she peers at Steve around his dividing wall.  “How did it go?”
"What'd you find?" Tony said tersely as he came up next to Steve, relaxing only slightly when Steve silently took his hand.
"He's on the roof," he said, his hands as steady as a surgeon's as he squinted through the rifle's scope and fired, jumping up as soon as the enemy soldier thudded to the ground. "That's one."
Steve thought firmly, wishing with everything in him that he believed it.
And after all
"Hey, buddy!" Tony exclaimed as he swept into Peter's room, the harsh scent of oxygen and sterile gauze mixed with strong disinfectant assaulting his senses. He skidded to a halt next to Peter's bed and immediately pulled him into a hug, burying his nose into Peter's curly hair.
And he definitely wasn't going to say
"Are they a couple?" Gwen whispered, her breath on Peter's neck sending a flurry of warm fuzzies throughout his body. "Your Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat?"
"Well, you know me," Tony said. He propped himself up onto his elbows to watch as Steve got dressed, pulling up zippers and fastening buckles as efficiently as only a military man could. Once he had finished pulling on his new boots and fingerless gloves, he picked up the cowl, holding it in his hand as he turned to Tony, a sheepish smile on his lips.
"Yeah, but—"
"I don't think I'd call it luck, sweetheart," Steve murmured. "I think it's something more than that. Something like soulmates, or fate, or another one of those things that people talk about in movies and books all the time. You and I were meant to be together. I believe that with every part of me, because if we weren't, all of the challenges that we've faced up until now, there's no way we would've survived them. Any one of those challenges could've killed one or both of us, but they didn't. And I think it's because we're meant to be here, now, together. In this family, with this team." He paused, bringing his hand up to cup Tony's cheek, his blue eyes intense in the moonlight glinting off his hair. "I don't know what this new year is going to bring us. But what I do know, is that as long as we have each other, we'll be able to get through whatever it is. As long as we have each other's back, no matter what, we'll get through it."
"All right." Sucking in a deep breath as Bruce took off again—it was very unnerving for Steve to see an Iron Man armour on the field that wasn't being piloted by Tony—Steve braced himself as he looked up, his jaw dropping as he saw the same alien that he and Tony had fought against in New York step through the deactivated shield, right next to the female alien they spoke with before the start of the battle.
"And that chance was to steal something from our home? Where we live with our own child?" Steve asked sternly. "Not to mention the other members of our team?"
“And now you're thinking that those rifles combined with these bullets are being sent to Sokovia?” Peter asked.
There was a pause of about three heartbeats before Scott's words sunk in.
"That's good, J, tell him thanks for us," Tony replied, shooting Steve a look of relief. They had asked Bucky to send them updates every half hour during the movie, knowing he could do so without Peter finding out.
"All right," Steve said after a heartbeat's pause. "Nat, you stay with her. Don't let her out of your sight, you got that? And I want Pietro standing by. At the first sign of trouble, he gets her right outta there, understood?"
Sweat beaded across Steve’s forehead as he hiked up a small incline on the road, if one could call the narrow, rocky, evergreen-lined path he was currently following an actual road.  He grimaced as his foot slipped on a particularly icy spot, pausing to glance up at the position of the sun as he tried to estimate how much longer he had before he arrived at the coordinates given to him by Brock Rumlow, the leader of the STRIKE team.
There was a short pause before JARVIS continued. "I am afraid, sir, that without the procurement of the tesseract, Project Phoenix as written by Master Peter will not be successful."
Huffing out a sharp breath, Steve tightens the heated towel draped across his shoulders and turns up the volume on his earbuds, hoping that if he blasts
“Was anyone besides the STRIKE team a part of Steve’s mission?” he asked.
"Very well. May I ask what you are hoping to find?"
the RT exclaimed. "
"Steve," Tony said, low and thick. "Honey, I—I don't know—I don't know if—"
Thank you for all of the kudos and kind comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!  💖
"I don't—I don't believe him," grunted Tony as he struggled to break free from Steve's ironclad grasp. "Steve, let go of me, goddamnit! I need—I need—"
“It’s okay, baby,” Tony said on a moan as he curled his long fingers around Steve’s cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts.  His lips found Steve’s in a sloppy kiss, his cock slamming into Steve like he was trying to split him in two.
"All right, Doctor," he said softly. "Thank you."
Dad shook his head as he chewed his bacon. "No, buddy, not now. I've got JARVIS still working on the tracers, Nat and Clint are busy doing their old-school spy stuff and planning raids with Sam, and Bruce is working on the files, but until we find something of actual use, I can't—I just—I'm just gonna keep digging here for awhile, and then—"
"It was the eyes, right?" Natasha asked. "Those irresistible puppy dog eyes?"
"I do not mind at all, Captain," T'Challa said graciously as the four warriors surrounding him all backed off three paces. "What can I do for you?"
“Uhh, okay?” Peter said.  “Going on with… what?”
"Thank you, Mrs Rogers," he said. "I'm sorry if I woke you up."
The perfect soldier, indeed. Just not exactly the kind that the Air Corps thought they had.
If anyone deserved such a life, it was them. And they deserved to have it together.
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves yet, little guy," said Papa. "Let's just take things as they come."
"Yeah, okay," Tony said with a surprisingly straight face. "But anyway. Thanos? What's he like?"
"Yeah," Tony said as he swiped at his eyes. "He always said he never got the proper chance to try and save the world, but… if anyone could've done it, it would've been him. He was… indescribable."
"So, you still gonna bail on Sam and me this afternoon?" Bucky asked as they stepped into the showers. Steve closed his eyes, moaning softly as the hot water pelted down onto his tight neck and shoulders. It had been a long, hard patrol shift that day for some reason, with lots of enemy sightings just across the DMZ line as if they knew that Steve's mind was being pulled in a hundred different directions and were hoping to exploit it.
Tony bit his bottom lip. "Worst-case is whoever this is builds up an entire army of the suits and then uses them as an alternative to Project Insight."
Clearing his throat, Steve squeezed Sam's shoulder as he raised his glass in the air, nodding at Sam, Carol, and Bucky to do the same.
Tony nodded as Steve took his hand, heading towards their penthouse elevator.
"Oh, thank you!" Steve said in obvious relief. He cleared his throat, his eyes flicking briefly to the sketchbook before focusing in on Tony.
"There you go, honey," he whispered into Steve's hair once he was fast asleep. "I've got you."
"Yeah, okay, Dad," Peter muttered. This day wasn't supposed to be about him. "Stay just like that, all right?"
Tony hesitated a second before answering. "No, hon, I'm not. But we've still gotta try."
"Magic with a kick!"
Steve begged, his hands fisting into the sheets as Tony moved to press wet kisses all along the length of him before finally taking him into his mouth. His vision nearly whited out as Tony practically swallowed him down, grunting as Steve wove his fingers through Tony's hair, careful not to press down too hard and choke him. Tony had told him not too long after they got engaged that he absolutely loved giving Steve blowjobs, loved to watch Steve's face as he lost all control and surrendered to the pleasure that he gave him. And while Steve could've also said the exact same thing about Tony, at the moment he was too lost in a hazy sea of sensation to form much more than a few muttered curses and some garbled attempts at Tony's name.
After realising that Tony hadn't been home in over three days Rhodey had decided that he'd had enough, practically yanking Tony's arm from its socket as he dragged him down to the cadets' locker room. Once there he shoved a bar of soap into Tony's hand and ordered him to not come out until he smelled better than the overflowing trash can next to his desk.
Apparently the nanotech suits really did make that much of a difference. Peter's reaction time, which was already lightning-fast, seemed to be even faster with his new suit, allowing him to dodge projectiles and evade capture even as he kept up his usual running commentary. Steve and Tony had both tried to explain that verbally taunting the enemy during a battle maybe wasn't the smartest idea, but it seemed like Peter just couldn't help himself, and since it hadn't gone against him yet, they had ultimately decided to just let it go.
"Aw, don't take it personally,
"Sounds good," Tony said as he made a couple final adjustments to the GPS unit, fitted onto the left sleeve of his suit. He and Bruce had based a lot of their design of the quantum suits on Scott's Ant-Man suit, but Tony had insisted on completely redesigning the helmet, as the 1890s deep-sea diver look had never done much for him.
The cocky smirk finally dropped from Howard's face as he regarded Steve, his eyes following the line of Steve's arm down to his and Tony's clasped hands.
Tony's lips twitched as he nodded. "Yeah, okay. Fine."
"That's it, honey," he forced out through the haze of his waning orgasm, the rays of the morning sun streaming through the thin curtains and highlighting the lighter strands in Steve's hair. Steve's gasps and groans were growing louder and more throaty and his eyes were squeezed closed, which meant he was very close. "God, you're just so fucking pretty! I wanna see you come for me!"
“Tony!” Papa suddenly gasped, all the colour draining from his cheeks as his entire body went as stiff as a steel beam.  “Oh God, Tony, this is—this is—!”
—even Tony's dreams of the Chitauri armies invading Earth would be nothing more than distant memories. After successfully purging both Peter and Bucky's memories of being snapped from their minds, Tony was eager to try it out not only on himself, but on Steve as well.
"Oh, really?" Tony said, his own grin matching Steve's. "Care to share any of those master plans there, master planner?"
"Yeah, we can talk more about that later," Dad cut in. "JARVIS, get him the hell home!"
close, and he'd never been able to come untouched before. "So fucking good, baby, you're too good to me."
“No one else would be able to find it either,” Dad finished.  He huffed out a sharp breath, slapping his palm over his face so hard that Peter winced.  “Holy shit, bud.  I can’t—I can’t… I thought she betrayed me!”
"Oh," Peter said. "Well, that's good." Papa had told him that his ma suffered from arthritis, and Peter didn't want to cause her any more pain than was necessary.
“Ah huh,” says Peter.  “And?  All that, and you didn't once look at his face?”
Steve gulped as he nodded. "Together. Whatever it takes."
Steve’s smile widened even more, sending another bolt of heat down Tony’s spine.  “Well, then I’m definitely looking forward to it.”
He trailed off as Dad and Papa looked at each other again, their eyebrows moving in their silent communication method that was equal parts amazing and infuriating to watch.
And it
For someone who had been so inexperienced, Tony was convinced that Steve now knew his body better than he did.
"I know you do," Steve quietly answered. "So let's get to it."
"No tricks," Dr Strange said, sending Peter's heart to his knees. Through tear-filled eyes, he watched as Dr Strange reached his scarred, shaking right hand up towards the sky, his thumb and forefinger closing around an invisible barrier he'd created around the stone in order to hide it amongst the stars. The stone glowed green as it moved, Strange's eyes flicking towards Dad as he released it.
“All right, buddy,” Tony finally agreed.  He clapped his hand onto Peter’s knee, squeezing it gently.  “Let’s do this.”
"Oh my God, Tony!" Steve exclaimed. "What if—?"
"Yeah, I remember." Dad cleared his throat, reaching tentatively for the coffee cup and taking a small sip. "Well, I guess that is pretty handy. Did Miss Stacy happen to have any other information about that place?"
"No, I'm not gonna forget," he replied.
Steve looked over at Tony, raising an eyebrow. "Sweetheart? It's your call."
Steve smiled, a warm, content smile that sent warm fuzzies fluttering across Tony's insides. "I love you too, sweetheart."
"I don't know, Steve," Bruce said, his voice shaking. "I tried, but… he just… wouldn't come out."
"Hmph," grumbled Peter. "Don't think that's gonna happen."
And see the small dots of sweat beading down the side of his head, pooling on the collar of his crisp uniform shirt.
Because not a second later a huge purple being stepped through the black hole, his left hand and forearm covered with a golden gauntlet embossed with five coloured stones.
Steve's heart began to thud as he looked up and saw an incoming projectile aiming directly for the palace. About three seconds later it crashed into the same protective shield they had just flown through, sending bits of flaming debris shooting in all directions.
"Woohoo!" Steve yelped as he lifted off, the usual bumpy lurch as the aircraft's wheels left the runway barely noticeable in his excitement. "Oh man, and I thought that the X-301s were smooth! This thing is incredible!"
Like most of the Langaran Air Corps widows, Sarah Rogers had been well-aware of the risks that went along with being married to a pilot, and especially one that flew experimental aircraft. But losing her husband when she was eight months pregnant had been devastating nonetheless, and she had always told Steve that she had specifically chosen to not fall in love again because she was certain that she wouldn't be able to withstand another loss like that.
, and now the calculations with which to program it, so as far as he could tell, they had all of the pieces assembled. The only remaining task was to put them together.
"I'm glad you think so, bud. I'll see you later, 'kay?"
He was cut off by Steve's downright wicked grin as his long artist's fingers slid down his chest and abdomen and underneath the waistband of Tony's soft pants, closing around his straining erection.
"Well, not all of us can be as goody-two-shoes as First Lieutenant Joseph Rogers, right Joe?" said Tomis. "Has O'Brien personally offered to shine your flight boots yet?"
Which, Steve knew, was because they
Ms Sharon patted his shoulder, giving him a sympathetic smile. "You're welcome, sweetie. I'm off tomorrow, so I'll see you the day after that, all right?"
“Goddamnit, Tony, let’s go!” Peter heard again, punctuated with a palm rapping against Dad’s desk.  “How long are you gonna make me stand here waitin’ on you?”
As soon as the question left his mind another thought slammed into place, hitting Steve with such strong force that he gasped.
"I'll ask, okay?" Being at Gwen's house surrounded by her parents and very noisy brothers wasn't exactly Peter's first choice for spending time with her, but it was still better than nothing.
“Well… almost,” Steve said, his belly once again swooping with nervousness.  Situating Peter on his lap, he dug into his jeans pocket, pulling out Tony’s ring.  Then he reached for Tony’s hand, looking deep into his startled fella’s eyes.
Giving up on trying to get comfortable, Tony heaved himself up from the chair and plunked down onto the freezing cold floor instead, leaning back against the bulkhead. Then he tapped his nanite case, closing his eyes as the armour slowly formed across his body. The nanites, like him, were tired, so low on power that they probably only had one or two suit-ups left in them before they would be completely dead.
"Oh my
Thankfully, the monitor stopped its incessant noise about a minute later. It was Ms Sharon's day off for the week, and for once Peter was grateful for the lack of interest from his substitute nurse. There was no way that Ms Sharon would've just sat out there in the nurse's station gossiping while one of her patients was in a dangerously high tachycardia.
“It’s Steve, isn't it?” Sam cut in.  “Is he okay?”
"Hey," Steve whispered as the tears he'd been holding back finally welled up and spilled over, dripping onto his lap. He tentatively reached for Tony's hand, letting out a gasp of relief when Tony's fingers curled around his.
In fact, Steve was almost certain that he saw Anthony lick his lips right before he turned away, sending a shock of heat across Steve's chest. Had he been standing up there all that time just waiting for him to return?
"Perhaps to you, Mr Stark," snapped Davis. "But I'm afraid to some of us, it would appear that the Avengers now have control over a rather large and formidable iron army, which is something that I for one am not exactly comfortable with. So what do you believe gives you the right to keep such a private army, and how are we to be sure that the Avengers won't one day use it to turn on the rest of us?"
"Yeah, you guys didn't count on me, did ya?" Peter removed the glasses again, relaxing a bit when the flying suits and the building both reappeared and trying to figure out exactly what he was going to do with this information.
Outside of his nightmares, at least.
“Pete, there are some things going on here that you just don't understand, okay?” Tony said.  “Things that I’ve gotta deal with first before we can—”
Steve rasped as he captured Tony's lips again, kissing and nibbling as his free hand slipped underneath the front of Tony's shirt, gliding up to brush his thumb across his nipple. A soft whimper escaped Tony's throat as Steve's tongue plundered his mouth, finally pulling away to kiss down his cheek and jaw to his neck.
And the battle wasn't over yet. It had only been paused.
"We don't know if he's even a he!" exclaimed the middle boy. "For all we know he could be a girl!"
"Sam!" Steve said suddenly. He pointed to his teammate's left hand, and the ring sitting on his third finger. "Um… do you guys have some news for us?"
Knowing HYDRA, they had been planning on nabbing Steve for a long, long time, and so would likely keep him hidden somewhere that wasn't already documented.
"He has noticed, though," said Natasha. "Tony may not have the ability to show it right now, but you can't tell me that he hasn't noticed. You didn't see him when you were missing, Steve. He was… well… he was a lot like he is now, at least at first. If it hadn't been for Peter, then—"
Peter shot Tony a rather harsh frown.  “If JARVIS’s ‘however’ is his way of saying that you stayed up all night working on that dumb missile schematic instead of sleeping, then I already know.  I just wish you didn't try to lie to me about it.”
Not that Steve needed reminding.  He knew how lucky he was.
Anger welled up inside Steve's gut, so strongly that it almost frightened him. He hadn't even met the child yet and already felt very protective of him. "Okay, but you're not saying that his parents—that they're—?"
"She sure is," agreed Steve, and she truly was. Peter was indeed a very talented artist for such a young child, something that Steve could recognise as an amateur artist himself. But at the same time, Steve could understand why the boy's grandfather wasn't encouraging of his talent. Artists weren't exactly revered in Langara, a society that had become so entrenched in combat and strategy and just war in general, that things like art had long since fallen by the wayside.
But first, he had to make sure they all knew how much he appreciated them, how important they were to him, and how proud he was of them.
"You—you have?" Steve asked.
, right? We just watched it with Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky a few weeks ago?"
He would have to find something else.  Some other method of release so he didn't end up being consumed from the inside out.
"Not now, honey," Tony whispered, his eyes already closed. "Let's just rest a bit first, yeah?"
He'd been doing that a lot in the hours since he'd landed, dazed and confused and half mad from thirst and cold, frantic to see his two beloved boys. Aside from the fact that he simply enjoyed seeing his own creation adorning his boyfriend's—
"So, what's going on? My secretary said you wanted to requisition another computer?"
So maybe what it needed now wasn’t more things that blew it up, but more things to patch it back together again.
"Nat, hit it with your Bites, the electrical charge should help disrupt the water!" Steve commanded.
"All right, but that still doesn't answer my question," said Steve. "Is there any of the serum still left?"
But finally having a good-paying job and the ability to chip away at his lingering debt still doesn’t mean Steve is ready for a relationship.  Especially with the father of the boy he just agreed to coach.
"Conference call go okay?"
In fact, if he never saw him again at all Tony was fairly certain he would be just fine. For almost his entire life Howard had brought Tony nothing but pain and anguish, and Tony could no longer afford the energy it took to try and fix things.
"That is true," she said softly. "But that still doesn't mean that there's no hope for you."
is that—?" The rest of his question died on his lips as Dr Strange began swinging his arm in a circle, forming the portal that would take them to Earth. As soon as it was wide enough, he stepped through, landing on what Peter recognised as the huge field out beyond King T'Challa's palace. Quill frowned as he slowly approached the circle, eyeing it warily.
"You're all clear now, you two," came the voice of Colonel Rhodes—
"Whatever it takes," echoed Carol.
"Yeah, hon?"
"Indeed, sir."
“The drawbridge is down, people!” Tony suddenly says, breaking Steve from his murky thoughts.  “I’m heading inside!”
"Aww, but it's just not fair!" Ned insisted, thankfully a bit quieter. "I mean, I always kinda thought that Wakanda wasn't even a real place. You know, like Atlantis, or that Nidavellir place that you read about in your mythology books, and now you're telling me you guys get to spend spring break down there? And what'll come after that, space? Some other planet that we've never even heard of? I mean… geez! How come I can't have parents who are superheroes? I'd give just about anything to see a place like Wakanda! Just once!"
"Okay, so… you wanna tell me what's really on your mind, or are you gonna make me try and guess?" he asked, quirking an eyebrow. Steve immediately huffed, shifting on his feet. It still unnerved him at times just how well Tony could read him.
"Oh, yeah," Peter whispered, and Tony winced. At only sixteen, the poor kid had already been through enough nightmare-inducing traumas for three lifetimes.
"Copy that, Nat, thanks," he said quietly.
"Ah, whenever it is it won't be able to stack up to these babies," said Rogers. "Pretty sure we've hit the jackpot with these."
"What?" Steve demanded. "You mean—?"
Scanning the smoke-filled auditorium, which now closely resembled one of the lava worlds that he liked to play on Minecraft, Peter raced up the side of the wall to what remained of the ceiling, just barely managing to avoid the monster's swinging fist as he dropped down in front of the stunned cluster of moviegoers, all huddled together in the corner.
Peter thought bitterly.
"Copy that," said Clint. "We'll see ya soon."
"Uhh, okay," Peter said. "Then what should I call you?"
"Holy shit," Tony rasped. "I have no idea what you just said, but it sure sounded sexy as hell." He grabbed onto Steve's ass, rolling his hips up against him and pulling a low growl from Steve's throat as pleasure shot through his body like a spear. He squeezed his eyes closed, trying to get himself under some semblance of control. He was so aroused that it was almost painful, but he desperately wanted to take his time with Tony while they had this rare opportunity.
Narrowing his eyes, Peter watched as Dr Strange clapped his forearms together, generating his sparkling golden shields. "I think you'll find our will equal to yours!"
To Steve’s delight, Tony blushed, for at least the third time that evening.  Apparently Peter hadn't been exaggerating too much when he’d told him that Tony found him attractive.
As always, I can’t wait to hear what you think!  Got any theories about what’s going to happen next?  I’d love to hear them! 😊
"Bruce? What're you doing here? What's going—?" He cut off as his gazed swerved over to Dr Strange, gasping as he recognised him. "You? What the hell are you doing here, you goddamn, no-good quack? Last I heard, you ran your car off a mountain or something!"
The dessert which had turned out to be only the very best blueberry pie that Tony had ever tasted, baked earlier in the day by his very own husband and son. Tony had enjoyed it so much that he'd even had a second piece, knowing that Steve and Peter would happily devour whatever he didn't finish.
"Yeah, I'm fine, but what about you guys?" Peter said. "What's going on up there?"
Wordlessly, Tony pecked Steve's lips again and crawled off the bed, grabbing their discarded t-shirts from the floor and handing Steve his. Then he took Steve's hand, leading them down the hallway towards Peter's bedroom.
"Well, not if it means that we don't pancake ourselves down in those trees, but, okay," Sam said warily. "You're the boss."
"It was just a nightmare, little guy," Steve murmured. "You know how those tend to be."
And he, her.
"So, you feel like telling me what got you so freaked out earlier this morning?" Tony asked as he popped a stray slice of pepper into his mouth. Steve's fork, which had been halfway to his mouth, froze in midair, which Tony immediately noticed.
"But they had my blood samples, Tony!" Steve shrieked, loud enough to briefly draw Bruce and Natasha's attention. "The notes that we found in the Siberian bunker said that HYDRA had my blood samples, and we know the other Winter Soldiers were made and trained at that base. And this base is set up just like that one, and now we've found this list that has Peter's name on it, so—"
"Well, I'm not exactly sure Howard can make anything quick, but we'll see if he can try, hmm?" said Colonel Phillips.
"Not surprising. And when was the last time he had anything to eat?"
"Uh huh. Sounds good."
"Yeah, but I'm sure you know what I mean. You're a pretty smart guy."
"Goodnight, mo grá. I love you."
"I'm pretty sure your guesses are worth a lot more than most people's certainty, J," Tony cut in. "Go ahead and render a new part that matches these specs, yeah? Use the same gold/ titanium alloy composition that I use for my suits."
"Oh, I'm so sorry," Peter whispered. "I can't imagine how hard that must've been for you." Then he gasped, a thought suddenly dawning on him that made all the blood in his body run cold.
It took him a few more seconds to realise that none of the others had bothered to leave any credits behind for their drinks, something that brought a slight smile to Steve's face as he dug into his back pocket, peeling off the required number of bills and laying them on the table. He'd get them all back the next time.
I can't—you just feel so good. I'm gonna—!"
"Got another headache, little guy?" Papa asked as he started the engine, gesturing for Chief Stacy to get in front of him. "Did you forget your glasses again?"
For once Ned wasn't exaggerating about the drinks, and as the three of them talked over punch and cupcakes, Peter actually found himself relaxing a little. Despite all of his ballet training with Auntie Nat, Peter preferred to stay on the sidelines during the fast songs while the more coordinated people tore up the dance floor, which Gwen thankfully didn't seem to mind.
"Whoa!" Peter breathed as a vast body of water suddenly appeared below the jet, surrounded on three sides by mountains. "This place looks awesome!"
fault that Peter almost died that night, and if he can forgive you for it then that's because he's too good for this fucking world that we're stuck in. But I will not. It is way past the time for you to start owning up to all of your goddamn mistakes!"
"You did?" Peter exclaimed through a mouthful of chicken tender. "How? The FBI agent in charge of his case won't even tell my dad hardly anything, and he's the one who tipped them off!"
incredible, even better than Steve had remembered, and it took nearly all of his willpower to keep himself from thrusting sharply up as Tony slowly sank down around him.
"Yeah… I kinda—I kinda forgot about it, actually. It's been awhile since I've had a reaction like that, so…"
"Sleep now, dear," she whispered as she ruffled his messy hair. "Everything will be all right."
"Uh huh," Peter said with a sigh. "Goodnight."
Obie was good with the company's numbers, but he was in no way an inventor or a scientist of any kind.
"The day that you saved him," Steve finished. He curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, planting a kiss on his forehead. "You went there, to that hospital, and you stayed there. You stayed there for weeks while he grew stronger, never leaving his side. Isn't that what you've told me?"
"Yep, that's right," Tony said. "And we'll have balloons, and cake, and even a tree-climbing competition, yeah? And Uncle James and Auntie Carol and Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam, and all of Papa's other teammates will be there."
"Daddy?" Peter suddenly croaked through his mask, his huge brown eyes glassy with pain. "I don't—I don't feel so good. My chest, it hurts, and—"
“You’re sure you won’t forget?” Peter asked.
And now that it had, Tony was at a loss as to how he was going to be able to prevent a similar threat. He could only refine the drone stun beams to a certain point, and he couldn't exactly have them firing at every single ant, fly, or mosquito that happened to wander into their range either.
"Not now, sweetheart, okay? Please, can't I just hold you for a little while?"
"Well, first of all, we're gonna need to keep the suit," Tony said. "At least for awhile."
"Just so long as all of this works," said Cam. "'Cause you know if it doesn't then O'Brien's gonna come down on all of us like a big bag of hammers."
"We'll have to talk about it, Pete, okay?" he finally said. "You, me, and Papa, we'll all talk about it together once it's ready, and we can decide then."
"Which I'll be taking," Steve said in his Captain's voice, his shoulders dropping when Tony frowned. "Please, mo grá, don't argue with me on this."
Uncle Thor's face immediately fell, and Peter winced, glancing towards Papa who was sitting on the opposite end of the couch.
"These are not ugly, Tony," Steve said a couple minutes later, brushing his lips across the worst of Tony's scars. "These scars tell a story, one that demonstrates your tenacity, your genius, and your love for our son. They represent your absolute refusal to give up under the most frightening of circumstances, and for that, I'll always be grateful for them. I wouldn't have found you and Peter without them."
"Try and get some good sleep tonight, okay?" Papa said as he kissed Peter's forehead. "Hopefully we'll get to see Dad tomorrow."
"Well…" Steve said as his smile grew even deeper, revealing the dimple in his right cheek—and oh gods, that
Project Rebirth was very aptly named, as it turned out.
"Well, maybe if you talk about it a bit, it might help?" Peter continued. "My dad and my grandpa never talked all that much when I was little, unless you count bickering as talking, which I don't, but… I think it's partly why their relationship is so bad. Well, that plus the fact that my grandpa's drunk a lot of the time, but… I know that's not a problem with Uncle Sam, so…"
"Okay." Steve let out a semi-contented sigh as he cuddled even closer, kissing the top of Tony's head.
“February 20th, 2019.  Sergeant Barnes undergoes amputation of his left arm three inches below the shoulder.  Blood and blood products for his surgery are donated by myself and one other surviving member of my team.  Following his operation, Sergeant Barnes’ exemplary military career is officially over.”
"Well, we don't need to get into specifics now, do we?"
It was a good thing they had gotten married already.  And had gone on their honeymoon, spending two weeks relaxing on a beach in southern Italy back in January while Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky stayed with Peter.
“Okay,” Peter says.  Placing the lenses against his eyes, he yanks on the rubber strap to bring it over his head, and immediately flinches in pain as the strap snaps right back against his fingers.
them?" James asked. "How in the hell—?"
Hand-in-hand, Steve and Tony headed down the hallway to a conference room, one that had been freshly cleaned from the looks and smell of it. The infirmary floor at the Compound, while as well-stocked as any major hospital and even sporting its own operating room, didn't really get all that much use. In fact, Steve was fairly certain that aside from some minor laboratory mishaps and the occasional illness, Dr Cho and the other medical doctor who rotated through the infirmary didn't see all that many patients, leaving them plenty of time to pursue whatever research projects they were currently involved in.
Seventy-eight days to go.
"I'm okay now, Dad," Peter said as Steve came up behind them, embracing them both. "It's all over."
"Hill, get all of these people out of here!" he wheezed. "This fight's not over yet!"
"Thanks," Gwen murmured, her glorious smile almost enough to chase Peter's sorrows away.
"Oh, sure," Peter said. But before he could take it, his own buzzed in his hand with an incoming text.
It really couldn't have been a much more laid back first date.  Having Peter there to break the ice and fill in any awkward silences meant that the conversation hadn’t wavered for more than a few seconds and that there had been no shortage of laughter, especially when Peter started telling stories about some of the students in his chemistry class.
"Then you've got me," Tony said as he glided his palms up Steve's strong arms to his shoulders. "And it sure as hell beats sleeping in my office, so—"
Now he was with Steve, and if Tony had his way, he'd never have to let go of Steve again.
"Uhh…" Beck paused to search through his notes, although to Tony it almost appeared as though he was feigning not knowing the answer.
"No, I can do that by myself," Peter said quickly. "It's at least one thing I can still do by myself. I just need a little help standing up since I get lightheaded really easily." He held out his hand towards Steve, who took it carefully, as if it were made of porcelain. "Is that okay?"
“Uh huh.”
Loading up a tray with a bowl of the hot soup, some oyster crackers, and another mug of the cinnamon tea, Steve made his way to their room to find Tony sitting up in bed, blotting his forehead with the washcloth Steve had left for him.
After that video, and everything we've told him about being careful, why would he go and do such a thing?"
Which was good, considering at the moment, Steve didn't even feel up to fighting against his punching bags, much less some villain out to gain control of some nuclear arsenal somewhere, or whatever other chaos they would be plotting.
Unfortunately, the next hour that passed didn't prove to be any more fruitful than the hours before it, and soon enough Tony was on the comm, staring at the drawing Steve gave him as he called out to him in a shaky voice.
They were silent as they headed to the elevator, the slight jingle of Steve’s medals the perfect metronome to their matching footsteps.  He knew they were prepared for what was coming.  Thanks to Peter’s tireless research and the documents that Colonel Rhodes had provided, Steve knew their case was as airtight as it could possibly get.
"You are not seriously thinking about—" Tony started, only to be cut off by Steve's fingers pressing against his lips.
"Am I to assume that you are not interested in replacing the drones, but rather upgrading them?" JARVIS asked.
Tony was brilliant, one of the smartest people in the world. If anyone could figure out how to fly an alien spaceship, it was him. Especially since he'd already figured out how to fix one.
"Master Peter is currently located in Sergeant Barnes' apartment with he and Agent Barton, sir," replied JARVIS. "They are watching a hockey game."
Chairman Oklahoma immediately sat upright in his chair, glaring bullets at Davis as Steve's hand briefly closed around Tony's. "Please accept our apologies for that rather invasive question, Mr Stark, Captain Rogers."
"Yes, we do," agreed Papa. "Sam, James, do a quick reconnaissance flight. Don't cross their line, just see what you can see and come right back."
Another series of machine-gun blasts drowns out JARVIS’s response, nearly sending Steve’s heart into his throat at their intensity.  He grits his teeth, taking out three more soldiers with his emergency pistol before jumping from the jeep, rolling to a landing on the frozen forest ground.
Swiping the back of his hand across his cheeks, Peter sucked in a deep breath and forced himself to take a step towards the wizard, hoping his exhausted, confused mind would be able to function well enough to actually have a conversation.

Fighting against everything in his being, Steve finally broke away, pressing his forehead to Tony’s as he tried to regain his lost breath.
And he had. Thanks to Tony's ingenuity and determination while being held prisoner, Steve and James had managed to find them in the middle of that massive desert, and with not a moment to spare. In fact, it was Tony's desperate pleas for Peter to stay with him that had finally alerted Steve to their location. Peter had stopped breathing only seconds before, and his blue lips and freezing-cold skin as he laid limply in Tony's arms were Steve's first clues that he was in very serious trouble.
Also, Happy Thanksgiving to all of my American readers!  💕
"Okay, so… that whole bedtime story that Thor told us about these infinity gems, that was all actually true?" asked Sam.
"Gotcha."
But that was an argument for another night.
Peter shrugged, his face flushing hot. He should've never told Papa about what Wanda had made him see.
Peter cut in, shuddering when his voice cracked like a piece of glass on the final syllable.  He cleared his throat, deliberately trying to lower it.  “Ned’s mom even offered to give me a ride home, and I told her I didn’t need one ‘cause you were on your way!”
"Is that how you felt running your company for all those years?" Steve asked gently. "Like you were trapped?"
"Well, they weren't exactly all that difficult, but I'll definitely take my share of the credit," said Natasha. "As will Clint."
A series of rapid rifle shots suddenly pierced through the air, and Steve glanced to his right to find Bucky engaged with two HYDRA soldiers on top of the tank. He immediately took off towards them, leaping onto the tank and swinging his shield, hitting one soldier square on the chin and sending him flying off the side. He quickly ducked behind his shield as Bucky slammed the butt of his rifle between the shoulder blades of the second soldier, knocking him off with a quick elbow to the chest.
The darkness that still managed to terrify him.
The process of grieving, Steve had learned, was a fickle one, full of fits and starts, forward progress and backpedaling. Growing up without a father, as a boy Steve had watched his ma mourn her husband, killed on the field of battle half a world away, for most of his life. Later, losing his ma at age eighteen had forced him to mourn her in much the same way, all while still learning how to be a man in a time that didn't allow him to seek the kind of comfort that he desired.
"So… what do ya think?"
Sucking in a deep breath, Papa gave a single nod.  “All right,” he said.  “Let’s do this.”
One of the biggest drawbacks to having an eidetic memory, as he had hinted as much to Peter earlier that day.  Steve had spent more hours than he could count lamenting the fact that as much as he would've loved to have forgotten most of his experiences over the last twenty years, it simply was impossible for him to do so.
But Steve had barely rounded the corner when the tank he was aiming for suddenly aimed its turret and fired directly at him, sending him careening into the side of the building. Steve grunted in pain as he landed smack on his face on a second-floor concrete fire escape, watching helplessly as his shield bounced over the side and dropped to the ground.
"Please, be careful," he murmured into Tony's hair. "Don't take any unnecessary chances, okay?" '
"Thanks." Tony quickly gathered his papers, hurrying out of the hangar before Phillips could change his mind. He had no earthly clue as to why the old officer was suddenly so insistent on Tony getting out on time to visit his son, especially since he couldn't recall a single instance where Phillips had ever even met Peter.
Pulling his ancient car into the driveway, Tony cut the engine and tipped his head back, curling his fingers around the steering wheel. He only had about thirty minutes to get cleaned up and get back to the base before curfew, which while normally would've been plenty of time, the fact that he hadn't been to the house in almost two weeks had him dreading what it was going to look like once he got inside.
Steve pursed his lips, shaking his head. "No! I won't do it! You can't make me—!"
"Captain Rogers?" JARVIS suddenly asked, his subdued voice still nearly launching Steve off the bed. "Are you in need of assistance?"
It was a statement instead of a question, which only served to reinforce how well Tony could read Steve. He supposed he shouldn't've been surprised that his nightmares had flared up again now that he was home, but that didn't mean he wasn't trying to ignore them.
"Um, JARVIS?"
"That something would be correct." Steve's breath hitched as he noticed one of the demon-like aliens whisper something to Thanos before pointing towards them. "Get ready. Looks like we're about to have company."
"Hey, you feel like getting a quick treat before we head home?"
"That's okay," Steve interrupted. "Tony, it's okay. You're here now, and—and—"
Tony shot him one of Peter's
Steve shook his head, curling his shoulders in as Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, his fingers threading through Steve's hair.
Do tell me more."
couldn't decide what to wear."
A chorus of nods and murmured assent followed Steve's final words, with JARVIS speaking up a few seconds later.
Peter was sleeping when Tony got to his room, so he slumped into the chair next to his bed and carefully took his hand, his heart lurching painfully at the sight of his beloved boy covered in wires and tubes and surrounded by beeping monitors. The oxygen mask he was wearing covered most of his face, and while his pale cheeks and lips were no longer the horrific shade of blue they had been when they'd arrived, they were still nowhere near what Tony would consider normal.
Tony tilted his head, eyeing him warily. "Ah. Having that good of a time, hmm?"
Tony tilted his head as he studied the drone hologram in front of him, making a few final adjustments to the targeting system. He had been able to almost double the firing range on the various units stationed around the Tower, to the point where they could now reach Peter's school if necessary. This unfortunately came with the unpleasant side effect of revealing their existence in order to fire, but at the moment Tony couldn't see a way around it.
" Tony cut in. "You keep thinking that you're supposed to be immune to trauma or something because you're Captain America, super soldier and leader of the Avengers, but when it comes down to it, you're just as human as the rest of us." His full lips curved into a soft smirk, his brown eyes twinkling. "Well, maybe you're a bit better-looking than the rest of us, I mean, 'cause
With a series of nods and high-fives, the team dispersed, making their way to their aircraft as Steve slipped his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him into a tight hug.
"I definitely will," said Steve. "Dr Banner plans to tackle the cellular towers once he and Colonel Rhodes are done with their work on the power grid."
"Tony, I'm not perfect," said Steve.
"Yep, you're absolutely right," Steve said as he pecked Tony on the nose. "Besides. I think we need to discuss a certain anniversary that's coming up in a few days. Don't you?"
"More like a place to stay forever," Tony said, rather grimly. "With a premature attempt you'd still have a chance—depending on your angle of re-entry—of surviving the trip due to the heat shield. But if you end up skipping off the atmosphere and careen off into open space, well… unfortunately, there wouldn't be much of anything we could do about it."
"Dad, I almost got it!" Peter exclaimed as Dad released the gauntlet to grab Quill's arm, trying to drag him away. The gauntlet was sliding, the end of it almost to Thanos' fingers. "I almost got it, I almost got it!"
"Thanks," Tony said softly. He sighed as he reached down into his shirt, pulling the tags out and pressing them to his lips, trying to imagine that he was kissing Steve instead.
"Oh, hey there, tiny DUM-E," Peter softly said as DUM-E let out another distressed warble. "Don't worry, we'll get you back to normal in a sec, okay?"
"Who the hell are you?" it asked in the most evil, bone-chilling version of Dad's voice that Peter could possibly imagine, only amplifying the nearly-continuous shivers bolting down Peter's back.
"Yeah, and you'd be right," said Natasha. "The FBI isn't the KGB. Yet."
"Now I know you're not putting me in the middle of all this," replied Rhodey. "'Cause you know how much I love being in the middle of things…"
Steve had
"Ah, requesting confirmation, my king?" asked T'Challa's guard. "You want us to open the barrier?"
"You goddamn sick son of a bitch!" Tony spat out over the comm. "Of all the egotistical, assholish ways to—!"
Peter gave a nod, gulping. "Yeah. You're welcome."
Steve's shoulders sagged, his chin dropping to his chest. "Tony, I don't know."
"Of course, Captain," said Dr Cho. "I'll be back in a couple of hours to take out the chest tube, but I'll be in my office if you need me in the meantime."
"You never told me that you used to climb out of your crib!" Gwen said as soon as Uncle Bucky finished the story about how Dad had once found Peter dangling from the upstairs bannister at the Malibu house as a toddler. Peter hadn't realised that Uncle Bucky even knew that story, but based on how much Papa liked to talk about him, he supposed he shouldn't have been too surprised.
Steve let out a chuckle as he curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, planting a quick kiss on his temple. "Yeah, it has. And I have to admit, it was kinda nice seeing that kid panic a bit when Thor got into his face. He hasn't been very nice to Peter."
"Brian, this is Captain Steve Rogers and Mr Tony Stark," said Stacy, taking his coffee cup before it could drop onto the floor. "My daughter is in their son's class at school."
Maybe even
From what Peter had learned in school and Dad had explained to him, Grandpa had been a member of a group of scientists that were attempting to study the tesseract as a means to help solve the worsening Langaran energy crisis. Only three days before the Battle of the Continents, Grandpa had caused a rather minor explosion—as if explosions could ever really be called
Steve didn't ask if Tony had known the specifics of that trip once he returned, but he had a strong suspicion that he did. For how much Tony—and Steve as well—liked to speak of Peter's uncanny perceptiveness, Steve was convinced that it was just one of the many, many traits that he shared with his father, even if Tony never liked to admit it.
"That's right, baby," Tony whispered once he pulled off, slowly kissing his way back up Steve's sweat-dampened body. "You needed that, hmm?"
But on the very next pass, Thanos managed to rip the cloak from his hand and grab Peter around the neck, slamming him onto the ground.
"Yeah, Steve, that was… I shouldn't've said that, it was out of line," Bruce said sheepishly. "Sorry."
"And allowed the military to take over," said Sam. "Boom. Brand new government."
But Peter should’ve known that not even a play-by-play retelling of the events could compare to actually seeing it happen right in front of him.
of the Starks. All three of them.
"Just… I'm gonna need you to do a cross link with Pete's suit, yeah? If at any time you get the sense that he's in anything remotely resembling mortal danger, you activate the Instant Kill. Got it?"
Natasha nodded, giving him such a hopeful smile that Steve's heart lurched. "Copy that. Bruce said he and Rhodey can have it up here in a few hours."
"Which you should be now, little guy," Steve said gently. "It's pretty late."
, he thought as he gathered up his equipment and shut off the lights.
“Steve?” Tony said softly.  “Honey, it’s me.  Oh God, honey, can I—can I—?”
the tree stated, while impaling no less than three of the war dogs with its right-handed branch.
The most important thing was making sure Steve was in an environment where he felt safe.  Sam had described untreated PTSD as being similar to a live wire, dangerous and unpredictable, and ready to ignite at the slightest provocation.
"Yeah, that's part of it, although the suits are a bit bulky for continuous reconnaissance so I'll have to come up with something else too, but they're at least a start. I got 'em out there right now, keeping an eye on things."
"What's wrong?" Gwen asked as they stepped into the lunchroom, her voice laced with concern. "Are you okay?"
Dad breathed in, biting down hard on his bottom lip. Then he clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder, jerking his head in Quill's direction.
Actually, it wasn't quite the truth, but Steve wasn't about to tell JARVIS that he'd just realised that he needed to pee. Nor was he about to wake Tony, who was sleeping soundly next to him on the bed, flat on his stomach with his face smashed into his pillow. Following the battle at the prison, Tony had been so concerned for Peter and Steve's injuries that he'd completely neglected to tell anyone about his own, which Steve had had the unfortunate opportunity to discover once they got home and Tony got undressed for bed. Steve had nearly choked when his eyes landed on the mass of deep blue and purple bruises that covered almost the entirety of Tony's upper back and shoulders, bruises caused by the grenade and missile hits that he'd taken while fighting against the Hammer suits.
As soon as the door closed behind Phillips, Tony sat down at his station, pulling up the orbital trajectories for Steve and Carol as he activated his comm.
"Yeah, don't I know it," agreed Steve. He looked fondly over at Peter, who had already begun drafting out a larger version of his airliner design on the blueprint paper.
Silence stretched across the landing pad, with Steve's thudding heart the only detectable sound as Peter looked up at him, his brown eyes wide with the fear he was trying very hard to hide.
Tony popped a corn chip into his mouth. "Yep," he said, smiling so deviously that Steve couldn't help but smile back. Tony Stark's smile was quite possibly the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen in his life, and right then and there he decided that he would gladly do whatever it took to keep him smiling as much as possible.
