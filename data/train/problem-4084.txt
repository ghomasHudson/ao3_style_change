Castiel rested his head against the window and looked out the window, eyes unseeing, as the world passed him by.
“Look, you’re worried about Cas; I get it.” Sam turned in his seat, leveling one of those concerned puppy dog looks toward the driver’s seat. “But there’s a lot of miles between the last sighting and Buffalo. We don’t have any reason to believe there’s a connection.”
With that, the punk-ass little drama queen turned on his heel, knocking his shoulder into Dean’s chest as he did, then charged out of the room.
Dean grins back, can’t help but grin back at the soft smile toying at the corner of those beautiful lips, and finally has the balls to rest his own hand over Castiel’s.
Happy End Day, y'all. I needed to get this sucker finished before tonight's episode because I fear my heart may not survive.
me.” Sue him. He’s got a handful of angel cock leaking over his fist, and the weight of the cock’s owner pushing him down into the cheap motel mattress, and he can’t be bothered to care about stupid shit right now. Especially not with Cas working to get his jeans undone. He lets his eyes close and just gives himself over to sensation, to the head of the goddamn moment.
“Yeah. Seven confirmed kills in Toledo and Cleveland. He lost the trail west of Erie, Pennsylvania, but he thinks it’s still moving east along I-90.”
Two large, warm hands came to cup his jaw, nimble fingers sliding through his hair to rest at his nape. “Let’s get you to bed then,” Dean kissed the words into his forehead, and it was all Castiel could do not to sob at the soft press of those lips against his skin.
Dean pulls in a thick, heavy breath, and then reaches his hand out. This part is still new and scary for him, to be honest, but they’re in fucking Gay Fairy Tale Village, New York, for fuck’s sake. And Cas is
“Want the dream?” Dean finished for him, letting his head rest against Cas’, who only nodded in reply.
Dean slid his thumb across Castiel’s bottom lip, nuzzled the tip of his nose against Castiel’s. The room was still spinning wildly off its axis, and suddenly Castiel felt a little light-headed. Dean’s breath warmed his lips in a gentle rhythm.
Well, it was barely audible to himself. Across the kitchen, Dean continued to sing, still beautifully oblivious to the intrusion.
Castiel knew pain. Physical pain at the hands of Raphael, the Leviathan. Psychological torment from Naomi, from Metatron. Knew the metaphysical pain of dying and being brought back against his will.
. Just what that something is, however, Castiel can’t quite place. He pauses, mid-thought. Dean’s watching him from across the table, the look on his face impenetrable. There’s a softness to those golden green eyes that rarely lets itself be known, and the corner of Dean’s mouth wavers, as though the muscles aren’t certain whether or not they’re allowed to position themselves into a smile.
he vaguely recalls. Only, as he’s come to expect with most of his encounters with Dean Winchester, he can’t quite seem to keep that angelic detachment. Instead, his mind clouds with the image of Dean licking his lips, and Castiel is suddenly overcome with an intense desire to feel those lips on his skin, which now feels warm and flushed all over.
Cas is so close it takes a few blinks for Dean’s eyes to focus on him, to see that familiar tilt of his head, the squint of those sapphire eyes, the tiny part of those plush pink lips.
Everything progressed quickly after that first kiss, after Castiel let himself relax into the moment, into the promise of
It barely registers to him when Cas dips down, bringing those big hands down to knead and squeeze Dean’s ass before he lifts back up, encouraging Dean to wrap his legs around Cas’ waist. Cas holds him like that, like he’s not a grown-ass man, and
. Cas is holding the box out to him, he realizes, because his brain’s gone just a little bit sex stupid and maybe made him slow on the uptake.
Sam schools his face into his best imitation of neutral before he asks, “Have you talked to Dean about it?” Cas chews idly on his lower lip, darting his eyes up just long enough to make it clear that he hasn’t.
There’s a rustle of wingbeats, ozone flooding Dean’s senses, and a dizzying moment later, they’re back in the room. Cas crowds into him, personal space be damned,
Dean’s tongue is suddenly too big for his throat, too heavy in his mouth to speak, so he nods instead, his mouth gaping like a goddamn goldfish.
Rubbing his hands, red and tingling from the cold, Dean stomps his boots so that snow falls onto the thick rubber mat at the door, and smiles quietly to see Cas mimic his movements. Only without the hand-rubbing, since Cas’ large hands are currently tucked into a goofy pair of bright yellow woolen mittens, which, Dean has to admit, look pretty damn cozy now. He almost feels bad about mocking them when Cas had bought them.
“Good.” Dean tilted Castiel’s chin up and kissed him. Just a soft press of lips, but Castiel immediately deepened it. Licked into Dean’s mouth and groaned at the lingering taste of himself on Dean’s tongue.
Across the room, Cas looked spooked as shit, and for a second Dean was glad that he was standing between Cas and the exit, because he looked ready to bolt.
?” Dean rubs his palm across the short hair at the base of his skull, then digs his fingertips into a knot coiling into the muscle along his spine. His cheeks are flushed, his mouth dry, and his eyes dart around the room, double checking that their conversation isn’t been overheard Which is ridiculous, of course. Everyone else is focused on their own business, eating breakfast and chatting, reading the paper, refilling coffee and ringing up customers and shouting out orders of eggs and waffles and hash browns. Nobody else in this dingy little Waffle House gives a rat’s ass about the conversation of two random flannel-clad dudes sitting in the corner.
’ runs through his lust-addled brain, grateful that they didn’t have to make the trek back to I-90 to find a cheaper place to stay for the night.
Dean noticed his resistance, because of course he did. Even if he did seem to have forgotten their carefully choreographed dance, skirting just on the wrong side of each other’s expectations for personal space. Dean didn’t let go, not completely, but he loosened his hold, allowed Castiel to back a few inches away so that their chests were no longer touching. Just enough for Castiel to miss the heat of Dean’s body pressed against his own.
Castiel struggled in Dean’s embrace, his eyes fluttering closed at the drag of Dean’s lips against his suddenly overheated flesh.
When Dean broke this kiss to murmur “Bedroom,” Castiel allowed himself to be pulled down that nondescript gray hallway. Went willingly when Dean shoved him against the wall, licked up the tendon straining in his neck, nipped and sucked at his earlobe until his knees shook. Castiel whined when Dean pulled away, just far enough to lead him by the hand, tugging him toward the door at the end of the hall, but he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t care that he sounded so desperate, so needy, because he missed that mouth on his neck, those kisses bitten into his lips, and he needed more. Needed them like breathing.
“You,” he breathed, so low that Dean was certain he’d misheard him. He shook his head, tried to clear his thoughts like an etch-a-sketch.
Dean grins and bumps his shoulder against Cas’. “Okay, angel,” he murmurs, and fuck if his heart does go a little melty at the soft smile that spreads across Castiel’s face. Without thinking, Dean brings Castiel’s hand up to his face, brushes his lips against the rough skin of Cas’ knuckles like he’s done it thousands of times before. “Maybe they’re not so bad.”
“My dream was…you, Dean,” Cas answered, as Dean watched the first tear spill down his still too-pale cheek. “Us. That there was an
garment, and not, as Dean had suggested yesterday, a “security blanket with sleeves”—has become damp with it.
Cas is holding him, kissing him, tongue thrusting into his mouth to a rhythm Dean mimics with the roll of his hips, seeking out friction as his dick twitches in the tight confines of his jeans.
, y’know?” Dean scrubs his left hand through his hair, scratching idly at the back of his head. “It’s…it
Cas moves eagerly, almost desperately, through the halls of the bunker dorm; Sam is about halfway to a jog just to keep up. When they reach room 28, Cas comes to an abrupt stop that has him tripping over his own feet to avoid running into what would surely feel like a brick wall in a trench coat.
“Havin’ my way with you,” Dean answered, his voice gone all low and throaty in a way that made Castiel’s head swim, heavy with confusion and desire. He let it fall, and it hit the wall with a thunk as Dean made quick work of undoing his belt and and button. Castiel hissed in relief as Dean tugged his trousers open, giving his erection room that Castiel hadn’t even realized it needed.
At his confession, Dean opened his teary eyes, moaned his pleasure around Castiel’s cock, and the combination of it send Castiel over the edge. He spilled down Dean’s throat for what felt like an eternity, and Dean took it all, swallowing up Castiel’s release like doing so gave him pleasure of his own. Dean continued his attentions as Castiel shuddered through aftershocks, sucking gently and then laving with his tongue, cleaning up all evidence of Castiel’s orgasm until Castiel jerked away, too sensitive to allow him to continue.
One particularly aggressive thrust sends Cas’ cock between Dean’s thighs, the head butting up along his perineum, ghosting his asshole. It’s unexpected and sudden and feels so fucking good Dean wants to cry. Maybe he still is.
Nervous, uncertain, Dean darts his eyes around the room before he dares to do more than look at what he finds within. The set looks so soft, sensuous, and the prospect of feeling that fabric against his bare skin…He traces a single fingertip along the delicate fabric, and can’t control the sharp intake of breath as the intricate lace catches against his calloused skin. His whole body is flush now, heated through with a combination of embarrassment and arousal.
to put a stop to it, but he was weak. Even before he fell from Grace, he was weak for Dean Winchester, and now? So what if it was a lie, if it was some abomination-fueled fever dream? Castiel was weak even before he was a mere mortal, so how on earth could he be strong enough to turn down something he wanted with every atom of his being?
Because that right there is a fundamental truth, even if neither of them have spoken it aloud. Castiel is
Speaking of dicks, he thinks, his is harder than goddamn steel right now, pulsing with need each time Cas’ slides against it. He didn’t even get a
!” He pulls his coat collar up to brace against the wet blast of snow on his neck, regretting that he doesn’t have gloves. “Hurry up, man, let’s get outta this shit.”
“Y-you’re here?” Dean reaches a shaky hand up against Castiel’s face, still uncertain, doubtful, even as his fingers drag against rough stubble, feel the all-too real illusion of Cas’ skin beneath them. It’s not possible, can’t be real, there’s no way. His eyes sting, heavy with the weight of new, not-yet shed tears, as Dean struggles to make his tongue move in his mouth.
They’re both still wearing too many clothes to feel that much, but even so, knowing that vague hot bulge rubbing against him is Cas, hot and hard because of him? It’s a goddamn rush.
“This is unpleasant,” Cas is squinting his displeasure, his voice its usual dry growl, which is all the more hysterical because he’s still breathless from the makeout session. Dean can’t help it; he barks out a laugh, unguarded and joyful, and then leans up to plant a wet kiss on Castiel’s disgruntled lips.
Eventually, Dean worked his way back to Castiel’s cock, licking a wet stripe up the underside before letting his lips rest at the head and driving the tip of his tongue into the slit. “Wanna feel you, angel,” he murmured, reaching for Castiel’s trembling hands and guiding them to his head. Castiel stared down at him, met that clear green gaze with a wobbly, wide-eyed one of his own. Dean smiled at him, coy and seductive, his pupils dilating as Castiel watched.
“Come on, sweetheart,” Dean mouthed the words against Castiel’s neck, a hot tease along the sensitive skin of Castiel’s jaw. “Just wanna make you feel good.”
“The Honey Beanery?” Dean huffs what he desperately hopes comes across as a sound of manly, righteous indignation (and not the petulant whine it actually is), and rolls his eyes so hard he can look inside his skull at the cheesiness of it. “Really, Cas? Can’t we just hit a drive-thru or gas station and keep moving?”
But it’s not just that. Yeah, that ache in his knees—the one that showed up right around his fortieth birthday—is still there, a dull reminder of a life of running himself ragged, but it’s not so intense today. And his head? It doesn’t feel like his brain is trying to punch through his skull; the roar of blood ain’t rushing in his ears; the now-familiar throbbing he’s come to expect from waking up after a blackout is missing.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas doesn’t even look up from the display as he gives Dean his order. “I’d like a large Honey Spiced Latte, please, and a honey glazed cinnamon bun.”
His heart is pounding so forcefully in his chest, the blood rushing rhythmically on the inside of his skull so loud, that for a long moment, Dean worries, remembering the dude whose heart exploded on that one case. Wouldn’t that be just his luck, to fucking explode with need before he even gets his mouth on Cas?
Next time Dean agrees to a detour for Castiel, he’s gonna make sure he checks a map for himself first.
Back at the bunker, hours blurred into days blurred into weeks. At first, he tried to make himself useful with chores. His attempt at laundry got him reprimanded for not separating lights and darks. “Just—
Dean’s breath is shaky on the inhale, his tongue a leaden weight in his throat. He coughs, swallows roughly. Wills himself to look up, to make eye contact with the man he loves.
Dean, glassy-eyed, made no attempt to stand up, or to even move out of the doorway. Castiel stepped around him, careful not to touch.
“You gonna show me something, Cas?” Dean leans forward, resting his elbows onto the table and clasping his hands together. “Make me appreciate these flying poop machines?”
“And I, you,” Cas counters. “That changes nothing about my feelings on the matter, Dean. I trust you, implicitly.” Cas reaches across the table and lets his hand rest on Dean’s wrist, offering the gentlest of squeezes, then brushing the pad of his thumb across the back of Dean’s hand.
“If you could just let me get the door behind you,” he trailed off and waited as Dean rolled, obediently, toward the top of the stairs, “just…be careful.”
Cas talking sweet nothings in Enochian triggers something primal in Dean, has him seeking out Cas’ mouth with his own, desperate and needy. The kiss is wet and messy, their teeth clashing and scraping against each other’s lips, the coppery taste of blood melding with spit, but who cares? Who the fuck cares about a little bit of blood mixed in with the taste of Castiel’s mouth on his? Dean snakes his arms around Castiel’s neck, slides his fingers through that mess of dark hair as he pulls himself closer. Their bodies are pressed together from shoulder to knee, but it’s still not enough.
!” His voice drops to a soothing purr. “Baby, what did they do to you?” Scowling, Dean caresses the metal hood, then takes a slow circle around her, examining the still-gleaming black exterior for any evidence of foul play. “Stupid flying shit machines.”
For the first time in weeks, Dean smiled at him, that same cocksure and rakish grin he’d flashed when he first showed up at the Gas-N-Sip all those months ago. Only this time, Castiel knew the smile is not for him at all.
“I fear my stamina is going to leave something to be desired,” Cas manages to breathe against his ear, and clearly Dean needs to ramp up his game if Cas can still talk in sentences. He grips him tighter, turning his head to swallow the broken moan that spills from that gorgeous mouth. And then Cas shifts his hips just so, and Dean’s cock slides up against Cas’ for the first time, and holy mother of fuck.
“Eventually, you’re going to have to acknowledge that I’m not an illusion.” The fingers caressing his head slide down his neck, brush across his collarbone to rest against his shoulder.
Their shoulders brush as Cas edges past him in the vestibule with an annoyed huff and a roll of his eyes. He stalks toward an available booth, trench coat flapping behind him, while Dean heads for the restroom. Tossing the cup into the bin at the door, he goes to examine the damage to his coat in the mirror. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem any worse for wear. And it’s not like it hasn’t seen its share of gross things over the years.
“Okay.” Dean gulps as he watches Castiel, Angel of the MotherFucking Lord, rip off his holy tax accountant suit, buttons from the rumpled white shirt flying all over the place. “Fuck
It was bad enough that Cas wouldn’t even look him in the eye since they got back. Throw in Sam being all squirrelly and tight-lipped about what he saw inside? Well, that was a bridge too goddamn far. Dean stomped to his bedroom, grabbed his coat and keys, and headed for the door. “Going out,” he yelled, just before he slammed the creaky old door as forcefully as he could manage. Yeah, he was being a dramatic little bitch. Sue him. He needed a drink or seven.
because the kiss has surprised him. When he nods the second time, it’s in the direction of the birds. “Oh yeah,” Dean stammers, “uh, apology accepted. Just…um, just mind the finish. Baby’s not keen on poop. Or…or talons either.” He resolutely ignores the way Castiel rolls his eyes, because a man’s got limits, and Baby’s precious, okay?
“Did you…could you not get through to him?” Dean rasped, unable to tear his eyes from where he cradled Cas’ head in his lap. “Musta been quite the party, huh? Angels singing and shit? Hamburgers everywhere?” His lips quirking into a bitter, crooked smile, he blinked back unshed tears before he looked up at Sam.
“So what are we dealing with here?” Sam looms just inside the doorway while Cas does a quick scan of the room, then kneels down to look under the bed. “Monsters under the bed?” He chuckles a bit at his own joke as he watches Cas disappear halfway beneath the bed, muttering something unintelligible as he goes.
They stood, locked into this weird game of chicken, until Sam’s nostrils flared and, sighing, he looked up. “Just talk to him, Dean.”
Sarcastic angel aside, what Dean says apparently meets with the birds’ approval—what the fuck even his his life? Dean can’t help but wonder—and with a squawk and ruffle of feathers, they take flight. They quickly cover the remaining distance, hands still clasped between them. As Dean slides the quarter off the roof, he does a surreptitious damage check. Well, what he
Hesitant, Castiel reaches forward, lets his own hand, disturbingly moist with perspiration, take gentle hold of Dean’s. And just like that, he remembers the intricate processes necessary for human speech, enough to breathe out a response, soft and surer than any words uttered by any vessel he’d ever occupied in these long millennia. “Yes, Dean.”
he reminded himself, and then hurried toward the building. The temperature had dropped at least another ten degrees since the last stop. Not cold enough to freeze yet, but definitely enough to put some bite in the rain. Dean squinted against the pinprick sting of the rain hitting his face, and tried not to think about Cas getting caught up in this mess.
Um,” Dean says, decidedly not smooth or suave, as he chews nervously on the inside of his cheek. He peeks over at Cas out of the corner of his eye, and the angel’s still got that damn adorable awed expression on his face and it makes Dean’s cheeks heat up.
“You love me for it,” Dean shoots back, grinning like a chipmunk, his mouth full of hash browns and sausage gravy.
“Stop that,” he chastises, loosening his grip so that he can tug Cas’ lip free with his thumb. “These are too pretty for you too be messing ‘em up like that.” He leans down and presses his lips against Castiel’s.
Cas is a writhing mess beneath his hands, his body gleaming with a sheen of sweat, his breath coming in harsh pants. His cock, shiny and slick with spit and precome, is almost purple in Dean’s hand. His own drooling hard-on remains neglected, tenting his boxer briefs, as he brings Cas to the edge again and again.
spot at Dean’s ear, sounding like he gargled with gravel after choking on cock and damn if that ain’t an image worth exploring in much more detail sooner rather than later. But right now? Now Dean just needs to get his grubby mitts on what Cas is packing under those rumpled suit pants. Like,
He opens the box with a defiant huff, then unfolds the tissue paper encasing some sort of soft cloth inside. And then his face feels like it’s caught fire. The package contains a pair of silk panties and lacy camisole, both the same golden green as his eyes.
Dean’s cock twitched at his words, and with wide eyes, he reached to his belt and undid it. Cas watched him with an expression somewhere between intrigue and hunger. For a moment, Dean thought Cas might mimic his actions, but instead the angel picked up the damn pen again and started writing, his eyes darting back to Dean.
“Goddamnit Cas, how many times do I have to tell you to knock?” Dean muttered, futilely trying to draw the sheets up around him, to hide himself.
Hey, feel free to recommend me songs! If they fit with the theme I'll try and find a way to work 'em in. :)
Dean covered his own dick in lube, closing his eyes and resisting the urge to jack himself hard and fast until he got his release. He swallowed, and pulled Cas to his feet. The angel frowned, but let his eyelids flutter as water ran down his chest. Dean shoved him against the wall, and Cas’ eyes went wide. Dean kissed him then, letting his tongue probe deeply into Cas’ mouth, and Cas moaned into him. Without another word, Dean lifted Cas off his feet and pinned him up against the wall, pleased at his own strength. Cas blinked, and then wrapped his legs obligingly around Dean’s waist. Dean swallowed, and then lined himself up with the angel’s open hole, Cas tilting his hips against him.
“No. Some of them make us happy,” Dean admitted. “I don’t know why. It just depends, I guess. Maybe on how you feel when you hear the song the first time, maybe what it makes you remember, maybe it just sounds happy. I dunno, man.”
Dean gulps. He can't say a word. They all sound wrong. Cas seems to understand, and Dean reaches for the buttons of his own shirt. Cas' hands knock them away, and the angel fumbles at Dean's buttons, licking his lips when the bare expanse of Dean's chest is revealed. With two fingers, Dean reaches out and slides the trench coat off of Cas' shoulder, watching it crumple to the floor. Cas throws Dean's shirt into some distant corner before doing away with his own. Dean lets his gaze roam over Castiel's leanly muscled torso, and Cas comes back to him, letting their bare skin touch. Dean lets out a low groan, and his jeans are much too tight. Cas pushes him back against the wall, and Dean's eyes fly wide.
“Mm,” Dean moaned into him, watching him rock against the vibrations. “Are you touching yourself, Cas? Want you to touch yourself.”
“It is not of import.” Cas paused. “You think of flowers as being weak. Fragile. Effeminate. That’s a human construct, a way of perceiving reality which is different to mine. I could snap your spine as easily as picking a flower, watch you die as quickly as a rose out of water wilts.” Dean stared up into Cas’ blue eyes, and he was spinning, spinning into them. Cas was right. Cas was eternal, unyielding, and yet, so – he squeezed Cas’ hand, to make sure that blood still pumped there, that the skin was still soft. That Cas was not entirely a warrior, removed from Dean’s mortal existence. “So?” Cas asked wonderingly, eyes flitting away from Dean’s to scan the sky as if for an answer. “If I was the storm, you sprung up in my path, brave and defiant, brilliant and blazing. I could have plucked you up and tossed you aside. As could any of my brethren. You are something more than impermanence, fleeting beauty and frailty, though.” Cas mused.
“Look around you,” Dean said quietly. Cas blinked once before doing as he was told, eyes skimming over the quickly reddening leaves, dotted with gold and orange in between. His eyes started to widen.
Cas sighs, and tries to put the feeling of Dean’s lips against his out of his mind. God, he’d wanted to give in and kiss Dean when he’d asked. But he couldn’t. Not if Dean didn’t truly want it. He’d wanted for years without reprieve, he could go on that way.
One of Cas’ hands held him by the handprint, and they were flying together on a high of pleasure. Dean was so fucking lost in it he doesn’t notice as every piece of glass in the room shattered and the walls shook, but he saw Cas. Just Cas. Eyes fluttering open and shut, blue and then bright white. Cheeks flushed red, lips swollen. He could feel Cas’ heartbeat through his wings, somehow. Cas cried out his name, screamed it so loud Dean thought for a moment Cas might be using his real voice. The angel’s dick shot cum over Dean’s cheeks, probably in his hair too, maybe on the far wall. Cas rode him fast and hard through their climaxes, and when they were done, they fell the five feet back on to the bed.
It was one of the first mornings in autumn. Sam was off with Eileen again – Dean imagined them slaying monsters while walking through romantic pumpkin strewn fields. Maybe he should take Cas to one of those autumn festivals – they were a thing, weren’t they? Him and Sammy had never really had occasion to go as kids. Pleased with his idea, he jogged up the stairs. Cas had his nose buried deep in a book. “Hey Cas, you wanna go out?”
“You wanna do this, I can’t stop you. I might as well be there.” He scratched at the back of his neck. “And I did promise to teach you about humanity.”
I don't know what it was that prompted me to say it. Perhaps my sanity had been the last barrier to the words, or maybe it was the smell of flowers mixing with the scent of sweat. "I love you, you know."
+ I do a lot of short prose on there about mental health and healing, which after the spn finale I think we all need XD
They were lying in bed one morning, perfectly silent. Cas was sprawled across Dean’s chest, Dean’s hand resting at the nape of his neck, absentmindedly stroking the black hairs there.
“It’s a real human thing, I guess.” Dean muttered. “You never really get used to it, I gotta tell you.”
“It’s by Lynyrd Skynyrd,” Dean shrugged. “Most of their original members died in a plane crash. They’re from Alabama. This song,” he laughed slightly, “Is basically what I’ve had to tell every girl I’ve ever slept with.” He winced then, realizing that you probably shouldn’t mention that sort of thing to the guy you’d fallen in love with. But it wasn’t just some guy. It was Cas.
When he looked over at Cas, the shorter man was staring at him with some unknown expression. He was silent for a few moments, then, "Dean, I like this."
It'd been three days since Cas had closed his eyes. Two days since Sam left - his brief phone call led Dean go believe that he was systematically burning the cemetery - and Cas still hadn't woken up.
Cas sighed, and rested his head on Dean’s. The answer hit Dean right in the core of him and still, he couldn’t be angry. Could only watch as Cas stopped him from wiping his own tears away. “Because I couldn’t bear for you to try to stop me, and I couldn’t bear to stay only to eventually slip away.”
than breakable or beautiful. And loved it, for that and everything else. Loved it despite all logic. Imagine that, and you will have imagined how I love you.”
He could get into the Impala right now and put his foot on the gas until he got to the nearest 24 hour department store and buy all the regular shit. Show Cas Valentine's Day, the 'traditional' way. Pretend he hadn't forgotten.
“Surprise me,” Cas replied, blinking his eyes open as if he’d been asleep. “Just no more Metallica.”
It was maybe a two hour drive back to the bunker. After about an hour of companionable silence, Cas asked, “Why is it that humans are unhappy?”
Cas’ eyes lit up at the mention of a surprise. After thousands of millennia, it was difficult to surprise a guy, but Dean would always find a way.
Trying to save the world, one last time. Over the table, while they flipped through heavy tomes, surrounded by emptying bottles and brimming-up despair, they batted questions back and forth.
Motel rooms in all fifty states. Various prisons. Hell. Heaven. Purgatory. After all that, he’d almost found his way home. It was here, in the bunker with his brother and his friend. Except home seemed just one step closer to Cas.
?" Dean's voice had broken, so the sentence hung open. Wasn't what? Wasn't an angel? Wasn't safe? Wasn't coming back?
“D-dean,” Cas cried out above him. Cas’ hips rolled up, and Dean nearly choked on his dick. He looked Cas in the eye firmly, a reminder of what he’d said before. Cas groaned under the smolder of Dean’s gaze. Dean lapped at the head of Cas’ cock, sliding his tongue against the slit. He pulled away. Jesus, he just couldn’t wait any longer. Cas’ eyes weighed on him hungrily as he slicked his fingers with lube, thrusting two of them inside Cas without warning and crooking them until he cried out.
Castiel nodded. “It… speaks to me somehow.” Dean smiled, figuring that was the highest praise he’d get. “It’s difficult to explain,” Cas said. “But as an angel, I can sense the… essence of things. With people, it’s their soul, and I get a similar sense with music. Dean, that song,” he paused, “reminds me of you.” He ended simply.
Dean’s eyes fell closed. Cas’ tight heat enveloped him, with a little bit of drag that came from not enough lube. It probably would have hurt like hell on the other end, but it felt so
"Come on, Cas!" Sam was coming home tomorrow. Dean took the stairs two at a time as he looked around for Cas. Wherever had the angel gotten to? He'd be happy to have his brother back, but a tiny part of him itched to spend more time with Cas. It'd been the same when Cas had come asking for his help with Raphael and they'd wound up at the brothel. He smiled privately. There was just something about the way things were between them alone that changed when Sammy was there. If Dean had been one for examining feelings, he probably would have said things were more open between them. Lucky for him, he wasn't.
“Uhh…” Dean glimpsed Cas out of the corner of his eye. “Not if you don’t want to.” He eventually said.
Cas stiffened, and Dean swallowed. There it was. The confirmation he’d hoped not to get – that Cas wasn’t telling him something.
They were lying underneath the giant tree, looking up through all the partially glowing branches and inhaling the aroma of pine. Cas' trench coat was spread out underneath them, and it was surprisingly soft. Dean had somehow found himself telling the stories contained in Love Actually. Cas had obviously never seen it, and Dean vaguelly remembered it from one depressing Christmas alone on a hunt, watching cable TV in his motel. Reluctantly, he admitted that it was a classic. A terrible, crappy classic which he hadn't enjoyed. Or cried at. At all. "So yeah, there's these two porn star stand-ins, but while they're filming - completely naked and everything - they start having these weirdly sweet conversations..." he trailed off. "But the one that gets you is these two kids, and there's this epic chase scene at the airport where he's just trying to catch up to her-"
Seemingly satisfied, Cas laid a hand on his shoulder and they appeared in Dean’s room, which was mercifully down the hall from Sam’s room. Another snap of his fingers and their clothes were gone. Dean grunted as he found himself suddenly erect with a throbbing cock, and Cas smirked, kissing the tiredness away with gentle presses of his lips to Dean’s neck. Dean reached for Cas, but Cas shook his head, and said, “Let me. Let me take care of you.”
Sam pushed a note under the door. It said, "There's a garden outside we never found. Overgrown. Mostly for growing spell ingredients. Take a walk there. Just 15 minutes. Please."
Dean was glad the mattress was soft. Cas landed on top of him, his head firmly in the center of Dean’s chest, wings still around him. “Dean.” He said, exhausted. Dean was about to quip,
First because it was difficult to fuck up pancakes that bad, and second because Cas had made them. Because since that first day in the woods, Dean had tried to show Cas what he knew about human, however badly, and now Cas was making goddamn pancakes and he was suddenly, irresistibly proud of them. Cas, for learning that he could feel things he wasn’t ever programmed to, Sam, for finding a kickass girl and seeming actually happy for once, and himself… well, mostly for just not fucking it all up. But that was enough. Dean looked up, aware of Cas’ gaze resting upon him. Cas smiled, as if Dean grinning and licking maple syrup off his lips was the most endearing thing ever. He opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of a camera flash went off before he could. Two snaps in short succession. He looked around, bewildered, only to discover that Sam had turned Cas’ Polaroid on both of them in short succession. “What?” Sam said in response to Dean’s what-the-fuck glance. “Someone had to.”
Cas snapped his fingers and all the candles lit up. Dean let out a low whistle. He sat down stiffly. Cas met his eyes for a second too long, before starting to read the Enochian ritual in a gravelly voice. It sent shivers Dean’s spine, no doubt about it. When he was finished, Dean clasped the dagger and made a cut down his palm. Sharp pain bit into his flesh as cold air met blood. He took Cas’ hand firmly, making the same cut before clasping their bloody hands together. He muttered a few words of Latin over the enchanted cat skull, before he felt Cas’ two fingertips on his forehead. Dean let out a brief gasp of surprise before he sunk into unconsciousness.
Dean groaned in protest as Cas pulled off of his penis, but Cas only paused to lick one of his fingers. Dean spread his legs a little, knowing what Cas was about to do to him. He barely felt the burn, because Cas was swirling his tongue round the head of Dean’s dick. Filthy things were coming out of his mouth, he knew. Cas looked at him just the same no matter what he said. He clenched against the pleasure as Cas found the sweet spot inside of him, crooked his finger and stroked it mercilessly. Dean knew he couldn’t last long with this, not with Cas licking along his shaft and fucking him like there was no tomorrow.
“No, I mean...Cas stole another angel’s grace once. And he was still himself. So what gives? Does he have a soul? He didn’t seem evil when he was human.”
“Elvis?” Dean stared at Sam, jaw not quite functioning. “You got him hooked on Elvis?” After welcoming his brother back with a hug and the usual inquiry if he got laid, Dean had gone out on a beer run. When he returned, Elvis Presley was blasting through the bunker. “Elvis?” He said, as if it might be a new species of monster.
“Oh,” Cas said shortly, finally opening his eyes. Sweat was already starting to glisten on his forehead and cheeks. He blinked, letting his eyelids stay closed for longer than seemed decent. “Dean, it’s hot!” He looked so godshonest surprised that Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
“Yeah, well don’t tell Cas that. He already knows all the words to Can’t Help Falling In Love With You.” Dean stomped past his brother into the room with the cassette player.
Dean pursed his lips, feeling as though he was being ganged up on for no apparent reason. “All right,” he said, waving a hand, and saw Cas’ face relax instantly. “C’mere,” he said, angling for a hug, but Cas walked into his arms and kissed him. It was somewhat more of a heated kiss than he’d expected in front of his brother, with Cas’ tongue darting in between his lips. Cas kissed him like he couldn’t bear to drag himself away, despite his claims. Dean was left confused but pleasantly buzzing when Cas disappeared into thin air.
“The thing is, Dean... life has given you a second chance. And no matter what your choice will be this time, it won’t lessen the way you loved your wife, so stop thinking that way. It only means that you can be happy again!”
Still, he only left once he saw Grace hugging Michael in greeting, waving shortly at his best friend. Right, he’d almost forgotten about that. Michael and Gabe were joining in as well. Satisfied, he made his way over to Luke’s diner, the only place the judges were allowed to stay during the contest.
“Look, I... I also came here, because... damnit,” he interrupted himself, pushing a hand through his hair. Then he tried anew. Honesty was the key.
“Oh, you won’t need to,” Grace replied and when he turned to look at her, he could see the cheeky grin she quickly tried to hide.
Alice’s voice was soft - that of a mother talking to her son - but her words still hit him like a sledgehammer. His heart began to thud wildly and his hands grew clammy from her direct words.
“I will, yes,” Zar said, his voice holding no promise but a darker note instead. His eyes also had grown considerably colder. “You sure you don’t want to talk to him in person?”
his aunt. But then again… what reason would he have for that? So really, shouldn’t they know? Shouldn’t
That was as far as he got. For in the next second, Bobby’s voice rang out from where he stood on his veranda.
If it wasn’t for the innocent eyes in the room, Dean would’ve pushed Cas onto the counter and shown him right away just how much last night’s good sleep had renewed his energy…
“It’s okay, don’t apologize,” Dean told him, clapping his shoulder as the man moved back to the door. “And if the letter is for Grace, it’s none of my business what it says. I trust Cas that he wouldn’t hurt her.” Even if he already had, in some way. But no matter how angry Dean wanted to be with Cas, he knew that had nothing to do with Grace.
Despite that, his hand still found the door knob and when he turned it, the door swung open, leaving barely any time for him to catch himself, which resulted in some stumbling. But before he knew it, they were inside, Cas kicked the door shut, and Dean didn’t hesitate to use the leverage to press him against it.
“Yeah, that sounds great,” Dean whispered, gazing deep in Cas’ eyes while he let his finger map out Cas’ face. “My boyfriend.”
“See you tomorrow, Cas,” he told the man as calmly as he could, forcing himself to follow his daughter once Cas replied with, “Bye, Mr. Winchester.”
Once the call ended, Gracie was quick to plead with her aunt and uncle to ‘pretty please’ stay for the rest of the day as well. When they gave in, she was quick to grab the phone and ring up to the main house, telling Bobby to come down for a day of family games.
Dean had to bite back his immediate reaction, which was to nod and step past the man without a second thought. But this was Cas’ home, his sanctuary, and clearly the place he shared with his boyfriend to some degree and… Dean felt terrible even thinking about invading it.
He had been so naive and stupid. Had been so caught up in his own problems, he hadn’t even stopped to think about how
There were so many questions rattling in his brain that Dean decided to finally, once and for all, get some clarity on the few he could do alone.
’ did not deter Dean in the slightest. Right away, he turned around and marched them back to where Cherry was. At least Cas had the presence of mind to put his good arm around Dean’s neck for some stability - even though Dean wouldn’t have cared if he hadn’t. He had Cas safely in his arms, he would certainly not drop him. Or put him down, no matter how much the man demanded him to do so.
Even though Gracie was clearly depressed, she had still eaten the cookies and when her huge puppy eyes had looked at him, pleadingly, Dean had swallowed the last shred of feelings inside of him and had eaten a few of them as well.
Dean’s eyes went wide and his mouth fell open, his breath left him as though Cas had viscerally punched him in the gut.
After mounting her, Dean took a moment to close his eyes and to take a deep breath, just enjoying the moment. It was early morning in winter, and yet the first birds could be heard. One single car passed by in the distance but it wasn’t enough to disturb Dean’s serene moment.
“Asshole,” he grumbled, moving back to the other side to walk around his car and get to his door from the front. He wasn’t paying attention for just a moment, too distracted by the brand new Chevy on one side and the fear that his Baby was scratched on the other side, that he was taken by surprise when a solid body ran into his. On instinct, he reached for the other person’s elbows to keep whoever it was steady. At the same moment a strong grip buried into the lapels of his coat, the force of this grip pulling him a tad forward and closer to the other person.
Dean lost track of the rest of Gracie’s words as he ignored Alice’s knowing smile. But he did dutifully dug out his phone, pulling up the picture Sam had sent him to show her while Gracie wrapped up her telling of the story. The picture with Gracie and Cas next to their snowman.
Rolling his eyes, Dean sat up straight again, turning towards Sam. “You kidding, right? Why the heck are you filming Taylor’s speech?”
When Patty and Babette nodded, as well as some people around them, Dean turned, carrying his crying daughter to his car. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, no one daring to even say a word.
The door creaked open just far enough for his daughter to slip through. Dean could make out voices coming from their living room but decided to ignore them for now. Either he was imagining things or, more likely, it was Sam and Eileen trying to check in on him.
While Dean was grateful that Cas took that choice from him, he could also tell that Cas had been so very close. Which was why, without hesitation, he let his hand take over. Cas held his gaze for a while longer, until at last, Dean could see the pleasure wash over his face before he felt Cas’ length throbbing in his hand. He didn’t stop the quick movement of his hand, letting Cas ride out his orgasm. Only when he was sure his lover was fully spent did he slow down.
Dean silently complimented Cas for keeping it together for so long, a heavy breath only leaving him the moment the phone wasn’t pressed to his ear anymore.
“It’s the recipe, isn’t it?” Who was he to judge what held special meaning to other people? “Damn, Cas, I’m sorry. If I’d known you would be so protective of the family recipe –”
. Not that Dean had anywhere near the same experience with them that Cas had – but it was still cookies he now so very, very deeply connected with Cas. And more importantly, the pain he had caused him.
Dean was pacing his living room like a caged animal. Every five seconds, he checked his phone, hoping against hope that someone would call him. With how furious Michael had been, he would probably be the last to do so, but at least Inias and Gadreel had promised to let him know once Cas got home.
As you might have guessed... the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas morning will get its own chapter... and it will be here tomorrow 😘
“Ready?” he whispered against his lips and Dean didn’t care how desperate he looked as he nodded frantically.
Dean had to close his eyes against the pain he felt at those words but he shook his head nevertheless.
Yeah, Dean had always been good at making light of emotional situations and when Cas chuckled again, this time very clearly about their own private joke, he counted it as a huge success and damnit, those big eyes were looking at him again, letting all his thoughts go rampant.
A hand on his upper arm held him back, Dean not even realizing he’d been moving. He’d also not noticed Michael getting rid of the mugs in his hands. He hardly noticed anything except for the pain in his chest and this indescribable need of following Cas, catching him, soothing him. Taking away his pain.
“No, no,” he admonished. “Cas and I won’t go away and you’ll have the rest of our lives to pester me about it. Right now, you’re in Dublin and we wanna hear all about it.” When two equally dumbfounded faces stared back at him from the screen, Dean frowned. “What?”
Satisfied with this explanation, he still tried to follow the conversation while silently begging his daughter to get back to him. He wanted to leave, the cold shoulder Cas was giving him and all these weird ups and downs of his feelings beginning to gnaw at him. But Gracie was currently making the rounds within the Shurley clan, hugging and talking to all of them.
He could hear Grace and Cas talking, but it was more like a white noise in his head, and he only snapped out of it when Grace addressed him directly again. “Dad, aren’t you coming?”
With a groan, Dean pushed both hands through his hair, trying to get his thoughts in a straight line.
“Michael, come on man,” Dean begged with a heavy sigh, so completely done with this discussion. “I have feelings too, you know? And right now, they’re pretty much broken. So please
what he would find, his eyes still flicked over to the bed where the phone was lying, his gaze zeroing in on the picture on the display.
“I very much hope,” he began, his voice surprisingly calm as he looked up, “you’re not playing at what I think you’re are right now.”
Letting Gracie hang in anticipation, Dean pretended to think about it before he ‘gave in’ at last. With a put on sigh, he nodded his approval and also braced himself for the enthusiastic hug that came right away.
And knowing that, knowing his daughter already had a place in the heart of the man he loved and vice versa…
“Just one question,” Krissy spoke up, forcing Dean to hang his head in utter defeat and groan out loud. “Please, Mr. Winchester. Just one.”
But surprisingly, he felt no need to correct his words. How they might sound, or what he might have just admitted to her.
“It’s shortly after ten on a Saturday, what do you think?” he replied with a grin. As if on cue, a door down the hallway opened. The shuffle of socked feet was heard and a moment later, a sleepy Grace appeared in the living room, hair still wild and a blanket pulled around her shoulders. She let herself fall onto the couch, snuggling up against Dean while waving at the screen.
“Just one more thing,” Dean interrupted again and even held up one finger. The whole time, he had wondered what to say, how to get all the thoughts inside his head across in an understandable way. But now that the moment was here, now that he was looking into Cas’ eyes, so wide in wonder, it was as if a dam had broken and all that he needed him to know simply spilled out. “I’m sorry it took me so long. I loved Lisa, honestly. But meeting you again, this grown-up version of you... I didn’t know love could be like that.”
felt like he was on display but Dean knew he was just being paranoid. No one was watching him, at least not any more than usual.
what I wanted to ask you,” Dean replied with a grin, sitting at the corner of his desk. “What’s today’s gossip that has pried your attention away from my oh-so-prepared lesson?”
He pulled the blanket back down, unable to find rest when he couldn’t breathe normally. His whole body was tired, it was just his brain that wouldn’t shut up. He kept his eyes focused on the digital numbers, forcing his eyes to grow heavy.
“Alright, fine,” Dean gave in easily, closing his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling of Cas’ lips on his skin. He was definitely looking forward to feeling those lips all over him for the rest of his life. “We’ll order something then.”
The rest of the day was quiet, neither Dean nor Gracie in the mood for much more than movies and some TV shows.
He was so occupied with his own thoughts, he only barely registered as Cas started to sign along while he talked to Eileen, surprising Dean. Not enough though to completely pull him out of his musings.
She seemed to ponder over something, studying him closely. When she finally spoke, her question wasn’t anything he had expected.
He chooses the name Faithless Healer because it seems like something that might make Dean laugh. And because he remembers how when he lost faith in his Father, his God, something had carried him on anyway. Some inextricable grace in the universe that bore no name had kept him alive. And because his one-time wife, Daphne, had told him he had healing hands.
Cas must have carried him inside, because he woke in his bed, the smell of ozone and chamomile lingering round the sleeves of his shirt.
Castiel looked him straight in the face, eyes wide, and offered a single nod. They stayed like that, sitting close together but barely touching, as the last strains of Buffalo Springfield danced around the room. Nothing was really different, but there was a change in the air.
Snowflakes rested in Cas’ windblown hair, and the angel’s lips stretched with a laugh. Dean didn’t even remember what he was laughing at now. They’d spent the morning out in the snow, running after each other and rolling in it like the lovestruck idiots they were. They’d lay down and made snow angels, Cas doing so reflectively without grasping any of the irony. They’d kissed and walked in circles and looked around at the shining world.
Cas sat up, swiftly hiding the book he’d held under his pillow. “Dean.” There were no other words for it. The angel looked pissed. Angry, slightly miffed, shirt rumpled and hair messy. Pissed and oddly human. Dean almost laughed.
The portal was closing, and the flutters of daylight it let through were fading away into nothingness.
That was what did it. Dean walked outside, tears working their way down his cheeks, to the garden. It wasn't anything much. But Cas, Cas he knew would love it. Would sit in this nondescript sprawl of green and rotting wood and watch the bees come. And so Dean stood there stiffly, smelling fresh air for the first time in weeks, for fifteen minutes and no longer, all the while unable to escape the thoughts of
“Exactly. You’re getting’ a refund on your ticket and driving home with us.” Dean announced, beaming.
Cas blinks. “Okay.” Then, emboldened, “Did you...want me to hold you? Last night, that seemed to soothe–”
“It’s about free will. How does one know when one is making the right decision? I’ve… I’ve made the wrong decision many times, and it usually leads to letting you down… how do I… how do I know,” Cas said, not quite meeting Dean’s gaze.
There wasn’t really anywhere to hide, though, that was the problem. There were a few empty shelves, some boxes, the tiny hidden compartments in the walls, their cassette desk, and – oh. Their cassette desk. Which was turned on, and playing the Jethro Tull song from this morning, and that meant Cas had taken the mixtape out of the kitchen stereo and put it in this one. “Gotcha,” he breathed. It was like Cas had some kind of magic, keeping the cassette with him and playing whenever possible. Dean supposed it was highly probably that Cas
“Save it. I don’t want any of that, ‘you’re a role model’ crap.” Dean glanced down at his hands. “Maybe I shouldn’t have thrown myself in front of that girl. But it was the heat of the moment, and that’s what I’ve always done. But I think… I think we were wrong. We can’t just be exactly the same and cram ourselves together-” He smirked at the turn of phrase, “-and expect it to turn out right. Hell, why did I think locking you up in here with me would make you feel better? It’s not like an angelic existential crisis is something a bowl of hot soup can fix.” He bit the inside of his cheek, knowing he was going down the wrong track.
Cas stripped him carefully, deliberately and then stepped off the desk to take his clothes off. Dean watched each piece of fabric fall to the floor as more glorious bare skin wa revealed. Then Cas came back to him, and Dean groaned as their flesh pressed together. Cas pushed him down against the desk, not roughly but insistently. The mahogany wood was cold against his bare skin as Cas licked at one of his nipples, and pinned his wrists back. Dean could tell this wasn’t going to be how they normally did that, but damn if after everything that wasn’t all right with him.
"Maybe. It would certainly explain his soft spot for Lucifer's rebellion. The element of surprise," Michael said, face sour.
Dean cried out, low and needy. Cas was pushing in slowly, too slow. It hurt, but he needed more. “Need you,” he begged in a cracking voice. Cas’ hand found its print, and he pulled Dean back towards him until he bottomed out. Cas moaned, lingering there. Dean tried to stay still, to let him have that moment of utter bliss, but before long he bucked his hips, wanting more. Cas started thrusting, still slow but hard and steady.
“Dean,” Cas panted as Dean sucked a hickey on his inner thigh. Precome was oozing from Cas’ cock, running in thick dribbles down the length of him. Dean looked up, lips parted, waiting. Cas bit his lip. “T-touch me,” he stammered, voice broken and husky.
He coughed. "I -" He stared at me, the look in his eyes at first infuriated before melting into something sad. "Damnit, Cas."
Dean Winchester's never been much of one for surrender. Probably because to him, everything is a do or die situation. Surrender means giving up. And he, well, he fights tooth and nail, every time, even when he doesn't want to. Surrender means adding a handful of sleeping pills to that glass of whiskey before bed. All he's got going for him is being stubborn, when it comes right down to it. It's why he doesn't like Sammy trying to get him to go all touchy-feely with crap and make him talk it out. That'd be like lowering a wall in his head and letting someone else in. Like ceding territory or something, because every day life is a war.
as much as he wanted that reverence Cas brought to sex, that spiritual aspect; before Cas was pulling him to his feet, picking him up and setting him down on the bed. Dean’s eyes were wide as Cas turned him over, pulled out the lube, slicked up his fingers and began methodically making Dean fall apart. “Yes, Dean.” Cas breathed as he opened him, little strings of praise that showed Cas knew that this, Dean asking for this, it meant something. Maybe that finally, both their barriers had been chipped away and there was nothing left but the spikes of pleasure that Cas’ curling fingers sent through Dean.
Cas kissed his eyelids gently and said in a low voice, “Dean, this is my way of promising you. Forever.” When Dean opened his eyes, Cas was holding two black metal rings, a little scuffed up around the edges.
Dean lets out his breath in a low hiss. “She knew about me too. She came to me, taunted me. Said she wished you felt the same way.”
And Dean was reminded of so long ago, when Cas had threatened to throw him back in the Pit, just because he could. Of when Cas went postal and tried to be God, and tried to make them kneel. Of all the times Cas had pulled the
“Dreaming’s part of being human. Come on, what could go wrong?” Dean forced a wide smile. “Meet me in the cassette room in ten.” Gulping, he left the room and rummaged through the storage room for what they’d need. Candles, sage, a nasty looking dagger, pillows and an enchanted cat skull. What was he getting himself into? Somehow, though, he just had to know what Cas would dream about, if he could.
Cas was gone before Dean’s feet hit the floor. He noticed his hands shaking as he buttoned up his shirt, and couldn’t stop them. What the fuck? When he died? Why would Cas majorly fuck with his memories like that? The sappier side of him was imagining his whole life, which albeit might not last that long, not knowing what Cas had said. His thoughts growled
Cas' eyes are lustblown and beautiful, and they flash imperceptibly when Dean begs him. Begged him. That's what he just did. He doesn't beg anyone. Doesn't let anyone take control of him. But the funny thing is, this is Cas, and when he begs for Cas, wants Cas to claim him, to come inside him and pin him down - it feels good.This, this right here - he loves this. "Please," he says again, just to test it out. "I need you."
Dean had launched himself in front of the bullet. Looking at it now, what else could he have done? Too slow to stop the shot in the first place, too far away from the girl to push her out of the way. He wasn’t just gonna let her die. He bit his lip, and finally looked up at where Cas stood rigidly in the doorway. His trenchcoat hung heavy and bloody off his shoulders, and his eyes were dark and flickering with rage.
“Right.” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “Good talking to you, Cas.” He made his way down the stairs, leaving the angel alone. He was beginning to put a pattern together. It started with eye sex, much as he hated to describe it that way, had some desperate trying to save each other in the middle and now included drinking beer in the bunker and listening to Led Zeppelin. He hadn’t thought anything of it until this morning. Something about the way Cas had talked about Dean ‘teaching him about humanity’ and the weirdly soulful way he sang along to Elvis, along with the familiar way Dean and Cas navigated each other… Sam smirked. He had a feeling a lot more Elvis was gonna be played the next time he was away.
The sound pulsed through him, travelling across the space between on the golden threads of consciousness. Cas had become all-encompassing, yet just as Dean sunk further into that sense of his presence, he could feel Cas doing the same. His skin hummed with the contact occurring beneath it, and he could hear his breath coming in ragged gasps. He was floating on waves of feeling, surging forward into Cas and receding in turn. It was like a world-consuming, metaphysical kiss.
“I just.” Cas is caught in memories, in Dean’s blood on his hands, in the way they went limp at his feet as the life went out of them. “Some of them said they loved me. I don’t think I was as subtle as I had hoped.”
Dean thinks the shadows of his wings and his blue eyes engulfed in fire are going to be the last thing he sees. He hopes the fire gets him too.
After all, Cas didn’t know that listening to Elvis was ultimate old dork territory, and Sam had no doubt been too nice to tell him.
Cas looks away, almost shy. “Yes. Dean, your dream...it’s not real. We’re safe now. We can live our lives.”
“What do you want to do?” Dean asked, hearing echoes of their conversation that first day he’d found Cas crying.
Cas slid the first pancake onto his plate, maple syrup and whipped cream appearing on the table with a snap of his fingers. Dean caught his eye for a second too long while he said, “Thanks, Cas,” and it came out throaty and altogether too sincere.
Cas sighed. “I apologize.” He sat up, and with a wave of his hand, the daisies disappeared. Dean frowned for a moment before he saw the picked daisies taking root again, growing once more. When Dean stared at them, watching them, desperately trying to decide if he minded being compared to them, Cas said, “I resurrected them.”
Reluctantly, he untangled himself from Cas’ embrace, and walked to the cassette desk. “Realized I’d never played you The Rolling Stones,” he muttered. He bit his lip. Was the saddest love song he knew really such a good idea? But somehow, it felt like the right thing. He pressed play. When he turned around, Cas was standing face to face. Dean’s eyes travelled up and down the angel’s naked body. “I was thinking,” he began. “I’ve been teaching you about human stuff. Or trying, anyway.” Cas nodded. “You know what we did last night?”
Cas started to laugh, long and loud. “What?” Dean asked several times, panicked, before eventually he just stared at the hysterical angel.
“Things are better with you.” Cas told him gruffly, shaking his black hair out of his eyes long enough to give Dean a piercing stare.
When he answered Cas’ kiss with a barely there thrust of his hips, he didn’t expect the pleasure spiking through them to completely floor him. He could feel what Cas could feel as well as the sensations from his own body, could
Looking disappointed, Cas walked slowly out of the water, wet white button up and a pair of Sam’s old jeans clinging to him. When they’d realized Cas basically only had one outfit, he’d become a receptacle for any clothes they’d bought or stole that didn’t fit. “Idiot,” Dean muttered.
When he opened them again, Cas was standing next to him. Without speaking, they stood side by side, shoulders touching. “Man, this song used to make me feel old, you know?” Dean said finally.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas moaned, loud and unashamed. Dean did what he could to thrust into Cas, and Cas fucked himself down onto Dean’s thick cock. The fact that they were literally in midair, that Cas was holding him up with his grace, that they had both totally lost control –
Oh, and I do not recommend that you suck off your partner while at a gun range or in proximity with lethal weapons. Although I myself would think that sounds pretty hot. ;)
Cherry trees grew everywhere, with smaller plants underneath them and vines climbing along the roof. All the cherry trees were blooming at once, littering the floor with a carpet of white petals.
They stood in the rain for a good ten minutes, Cas gazing up at the sky like every goddamn drop of rain was a miracle. When Cas finally met Dean’s eyes, he said, “It’s washing everything clean.” Then, “We can go home now.” They walked slowly to the Impala. Cas put one hand on the hood and the other on Dean’s shoulder, and then they standing on the stretch of road just in front of the bunker. Dean looked steadily up at the old place.
“I have to show you something.” Cas muttered even as Dean was grabbing the lapels of his coat – it was the blue leather jacket Dean had given him months ago.
Cas rested the book under his knees, taking no care to preserve his place. “I started to read poetry. Emily Dickens.”
Cas had a surprisingly nice singing voice for someone who’d probably never tried it before this morning. He sang like someone who didn’t know anyone else could hear, and his voice had a strange yet pleasant twang.
“You’re sick,” Cas said. Dean was silent. The angel sighed, and after a moment picked Dean up. It happened so fast, all in one fell swoop, and he was off the floor and in Cas’ arms. He glanced into Cas’ eyes, big and blue and full of way too much feeling. “What the-” he started to protest, but at the sad twitch of Cas’ lip, he broke off.
Cas shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s beyond me.” He neglected to sit in the third chair, and opted instead to sit on the pebbles by Dean’s feet.
Dean caressed Cas’ shoulders, making circles along his collarbone. Cas’ lips parted and he leaned into Dean, but he kept talking. It was important, after all. “Dean, you remember when I told you that I felt every touch, all the time? It’s true. But I can feel more than that with you, and I don’t know why. When you touch me,” he paused, and the faintest tinge of a blush spread across his cheeks. “I can feel the intent behind it. And… your soul. It’s unfamiliar, to say the least. I don’t quite know what to make of it. It’s like your soul rises to the surface and every time you…” Dean ran a thumb over Cas’ nipple, teasing him and smiling into the hollow of his neck. Cas sighed softly. “I can feel your soul. And it’s beautiful, Dean. I can feel everything. I love you. You know that. This song is the closest I could come to finding the right words.”
“Sammy and I stayed here one October while Dad was on a hunt. He pestered me into doing Halloween properly,” Dean laughed. “Here. Cut into the top, like this.” He positioned Cas’ hands without thinking twice.
“I thought my powers would’ve returned by now.” Cas muttered apologetically. “Destroying that artefact rather drained me.”
“Do you want to come inside me?” Cas asked, and maybe if Dean hadn’t been so lost in lust, he would have noticed the dangerous edge to Cas’ voice.
Also, I need song recs. *Classic rock* please, added bonus if they're about sex because I have many smutty chapters coming up planned. I may not be able to use all of your song suggestions, but I'm eternally grateful to you for taking the time to read and review :) Love y'all!
He gasps once more and they’re back in Dean’s bedroom. Dean jerks upright to where Cas stood over him, tangling his arms immediately around the angel. Cas falls to the bed with him and lets Dean fist his hands in his shirt collar, in the lapels of the trench coat, in the knots at the back of his shoulders.
Dean didn’t have to think about it for too long. Cas knew the most intimate secrets of his soul, his vulnerabilities, his broken spots. This wasn’t such a big thing, in the face of all that. “Remember when Zachariah zapped me to the future, the one where Sammy said yes and I didn’t? The one we stopped?” Cas nodded once. “I never told you, did I? You were, ah, you were human. And you were a serious hippy,” Dean tried to laugh, but it came out wrong. “I mean, orgies, drugs, the whole shebang.” He looked away. That explanation could have gone about a hundred times better. “I guess I just didn’t want that to happen to you here.”
Dean smiled. “Of course you are.” When Cas looked at him questioningly, he added, “We’re all right, y’know? Sam’s all right, happy even. And we’re together. So I guess that’s why we’re mostly good.”
Cas slammed the Impala trunk, clothes already magically dried, and confessed sheepishly, “I transmuted the molecules in regular paper to make more.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. The pleasure was building inside him, and he panted hard, wishing he could feel this for just a little longer, that blissful heat, clinging onto Cas, everything ramping up until it was too much –
Dean’s eyes flew wide open. He took in the smirk that was spreading across Cas’ lips, along with the angel’s flushed cheeks and forehead shining with perspiration. “Would you like that?” Cas asked, running a finger along the underside of Dean’s jaw. “To come in me, over and over again?”
Dean ran a hand through Cas’ hair, and didn’t answer. He didn’t think he needed to. “I feel like a goddamn teenager,” he said, staring down at their come spattered shirts.
“Dean, tell me about love.” Jesus, did Cas spend every moment of silence thinking up questions Dean didn’t know how to answer? Dean knew he spent too much of the silence staring at Cas. Anyway, he figured he owed it to the angel to try and answer his impossible questions. But God, this one?
, and I can’t keep it together without you, I can’t. You were right, too, I tried to keep you however I could. Saying we were brothers. All that. I guess it was the only love I ever had that didn’t up and die on me. I was quiet, for years, because I said it in that crypt and you didn’t say it back and I thought, okay. Leave the angel be. But then. You said. You loved me. And everything else and I – I guess I got a little mixed up – but I
Dean gave Cas a private smile, and Cas fumbled, forgetting the words, before his eyes flashed and he started singing again. Dean had a hunch he wouldn’t be able to stop kissing Cas once he put the guitar down. He wanted to say it again and again, whispering it into Cas' ear, shouting it, moaning it, choking it out through laughter, and just when Cas was distracted, saying it again.
at six. Dean and Gracie couldn’t care less for either of these movies, but they were both looking forward to meeting friends and spending time at the fair anyway.
Not wanting to disturb any of the handful people already invested in the life story of George Bailey, Dean just sat down in the back, letting his eyes wander. It did not take him long to find a familiar mop of dark hair, the angle just right for Dean to see Cas’ profile.
Maybe it was the weird atmosphere that had hung over the room, or maybe for the first time, Scott had told a joke that was actually funny; either way, the whole class laughed and even Dean huffed out a chuckle.
“Cas, I realized that I never got a chance to tell you and I know I should have a long time ago.” He should have realized it sooner, should’ve let these feelings happen. And he should’ve said it sooner. “I should have run after you all those years ago. I should have come to New York to find you way sooner, to tell you this.”
Gracie’s chatter stopped for just long enough to glance out the window, over to the spot where once the tree had been that had claimed her mother’s life, her hands instinctively moving to check her seatbelt. Alice’s grip tighten on her purse and in the rearview mirror, Dean saw Harry’s hand run through his graying hair. A gesture he knew to be a nervous tic of his.
Not good enough reasoning in Dean's book, but it wasn’t as if any of the hyped kids would listen to him should he tell them to go back inside to stay warm. So all he did was to keep Grace in his arms. When she still wouldn’t let go after a few minutes, Dean pressed her closer and whispered in her hair so none of her friends would listen in.
,” came the shocked cries but still, for just a second, Dean was tempted to go through with his threat.
He hadn’t fully processed any of that by the time Cas began to pull his hand away, trying to free it from Dean’s death grip. But that was never gonna happen.
It was probably a stupid question since he’d seen the shadowy movement and knew it must have been what had startled her. But at least his voice was usually able to calm her down.
Deciding to let the topic of their complicated relationship drop for now, he turned around and leaned back against the railing.
“I love you too, Dean,” Cas whispered back, his voice watery but definitely full of bliss as well. “I’m sorry, I just had to ask.”
By the looks that were exchanged between his boyfriend and Meg – playfully annoyed from Cas, a quick smirk from her – he really
Once again, he reached for Cas’ belt buckle and this time, no hand, no word stopped him. He had it opened in seconds and for a moment, he considered if he should move further south. Parts of him
Even with the disappointment, her reaction was the same as always and as soon as the car stopped, she got out and rushed over, throwing herself into Michael’s arms. Dean was glad for the short reprieve, taking the moment to breathe and to steel himself for what he knew was about to come.
Dean swallowed and went on. “And then, my daughter shows up, in tears, babbling something about you leaving for New York.”
is a highschool teacher and wholeheartedly agreed to that scene with Dean's students - she even added that sentence about the "rabid pack of hyenas" 😬 she really makes the idea of being a teacher SO EXCITING, doesn't she 😂
Although, he also couldn’t change the feeling that something had changed between them when Cas had finally called him
Instead of replying right away, Cas’ fingers started wandering again, as if mapping out every muscle in Dean’s back. “I was so certain you were going to kiss me then.”
He slowly stopped kissing every inch of Cas’ neck, watching his man very closely. It took a few heartbeats until those blue eyes fluttered and even longer until they focused on him. Dean wasn’t sure what Cas saw the moment their gazes met. He was trying for a soft smile – but he could also feel his nerves for the first time. It didn’t deter him though, his hand steadily wandering down Cas’ chest to his side and back to his firm stomach. Wandering even further until Dean could sink it into the front of Cas’ sweatpants. His gaze never strayed from Cas’ and catching his reaction in that moment was just as thrilling as touching him for the first time. His eyelids fluttered but still, those blue eyes stayed open and trained on him and Dean could feel his own nerves calming thanks to the sureness and love and patience he could see in them. His hesitant touch soon became surer, his hand encircling Cas fully before he moved it up and down once, then again.
“Spit it out. What did I do this time that has you all in a buzz? Other than watching a movie marathon, of course - because if you start critiquing my taste in movies, I might have to come up with a pop-quiz.”
Gracie’s hands were on his shoulders. “Dad, can we drive over to Cas? Please? I want to talk to him. I want to see if he’s doing alright.”
And Dean really wished he could. Not just because he would love to know if his soulmate was a man or a woman. No, also because he knew that he could talk with them about everything. He
He had no idea how long they had been like this when he became aware that Cas’ hand was no longer in his hair – which was a shame, really – but instead reaching somewhere. Oh, the bedside table. Which was just out of Cas’ reach, and catching on that he was obviously looking for supplies, Dean quickly leaned over instead. He could’ve probably been a bit more graceful in doing so, but he was eager, sue him. He just hoped he wasn’t hurting Cas with this new position.
“He didn’t want to leave.” Dean had to unclench his jaw to speak, and he hated how wobbly his voice sounded. “If you hadn’t forced his hand, he woulda died in his fantasy world rather than come back to m—us. Sounds like a choice to me.”
Cas glares, starts to speak, but swallows whatever he was going to say. It’s a subtle thing, really, an infinitesimal shift of his jaw. Someone would have to be paying extra close attention to even notice it.
He carefully maneuvers it over his head and slips it on, and every goddamn nerve-ending it touches goes haywire. He shudders as it slides down his torso, his nipples pebbling and goosebumps breaking out all across his back. It feels so good, so goddamn
Dean watches in awe as the love of his life cycles through approximately 347 emotions in a matter of seconds, each one flashing a different micro-expression across that magnificent face. What he lands on has to be the most breath-taking thing Dean’s ever seen. Cas’ cheeks are wet with his own tears, a beatific smile on his lips and those eyes…the sheer love and adoration in those eyes defies all description.
The moment hangs in the ether, the two of them millimeters apart and hungry for more, but neither brooking the distance, and it stretches out for eons before Dean remembers he can move, can coax his head back up to look directly at Cas.
“Yes, Dean?” Cas crowds into his space, so close that Dean can feel the heat radiating off his body, but not quite touching, not giving Dean
“Of course. I understand.” Cas isn’t looking at him anymore, is looking down at the table, and fuck if Dean don’t miss the weight of that million mile gaze. Cas’ chair squeaks against the floor as he pushes back from the table. His voice is barely audible as he continues, “ I apologize for bringing it up.”
more important to me.” There was a defiant edge to Cas’ voice as he spoke, and it made Dean think of nights long past, of those moments when he’d been awestruck by celestial power and the beauty of the vessel holding it. Made him try to remember the exact moment that awe transformed into love. Because he loved Castiel, loved the man now standing before him, and looking at Dean for all the world like...
“Goddamn menace, is what they are,” Dean mumbles to himself, though he knows the angel can hear him.
“Dean…I—“ he looks and sounds flustered, and Dean has to bite back his grin at how cute it is. Cas takes another deep breath, another thick swallow that makes Little Dean wanna say hello, and starts over. “I seriously think you need to reconsider your opinion about ravens. Corvids deserve our respect. I’d like to show you a video that I think will prove enlightening.”
A scratchy choral refrain echoed from somewhere deeper in the apartment, setting Castiel’s senses on high alert. Stepping slowly, in silent deliberation, he moved toward the sound.
He swallowed around the lump threatening the back of his throat, torn between the comfort of Dean’s embrace and knowing he should pull away from it.
“Real mature, Dean.” Sam’s face had gone all red and tense, kinda like a constipated Bible salesman who’d just realized mid-poop that he was in a gay bar. Not that Dean had ever witnessed something like that or anything. “I just think you should give Cas a break.”
But now? Now is for showing off. For Cas. Wearing the slinky lingerie that Cas bought for him. Something that he admits might have to be called butterflies flutters deep in his gut.
Wide-eyed and wild, his lips bitten red and swollen, Cas just nods in response, then thrusts back up into Dean’s fist. Dean tuts his disapproval, trapping Cas’ hips with a press of one forearm, and slides the other hand down and squeezes the base of Cas’ cock.
With one last furtive glance at the deserted hallway, Cas opens the door. Sam braces himself for…for fuck knows what, to be honest, and follows the angel inside.
Cas had promised. Only he was thinking in terms of ‘as the angel flies’ and not ‘western New York backroads during a snowstorm.’ Dean’s been white-knuckling the steering wheel for a good forty-five minutes, ever since they took that exit off of Highway 400.
“I love you, Castiel,” Dean says, with a certainty and self-assurance he never dreamed possible. “You…you changed me, too.”
shoulder. Electricity runs straight to Dean’s spine, making his whole body shiver. Dean throws his leg over Castiel’s thighs and burrows his face deeper into his armpit.
, so he forced himself to rein his shit in. Took a deep breath, swallowed down the bile rising at the back of his throat, sent a silent apology to Baby for the mistreatment.
Wiping the sleep away from his eyes, he blinks himself into awareness. He’s in his room, and can’t for the life of him remember how he got here.
” This time, he spoke more loudly than he’d meant to, unable to modulate his volume as though he wasn’t in full control of his body just yet. Sam’s eyes widened into what Dean disparaged as his “puppy dog face.” Chastened, Castiel ducked his head as heat flooded his cheeks, but not before he saw Dean’s jaw tightening.
“Smooth talk there, Angel,” he quips, closing the distance between them so that he can nuzzle the tip of his nose against Castiel’s cheek. “So whaddya think?” he asks as he ghosts his lips along the shell of Cas’ ear.
Dean taps an awkward little drum solo against the steering wheel and scans the horizon for the breakfast place.
Sam barely has time to register the flutter of invisible wings before Cas is there, all up in his personal space. It’s new and disconcerting; no wonder Dean used to get so worked up about it. Immediately, and unprompted, Cas takes a big step back.
Cas’ lower lip began to tremble, the movement drawing Dean’s focus away from his eyes, and apparently that was the opening Cas needed.
0 for infinity on that one, Winchester. Oh well. Maybe next time. So he huffs out quick breath, dropping his mouth open and shaking his head to loosen things up, and then squares his shoulders.
Staring in dismay at the glob of cloudy white now dribbling down his shoulder, Dean just grunts forlornly.
His own eyes never leaving Cas’ face, Dean leans down and takes the head of Cas’ cock into his mouth. He seals his lips around the ridge, flicking his tongue over the tip as he sucks. Time stands still as he watches Cas careen into his orgasm, those gorgeous lips pursed tight until he he explodes, gasping for breath while Dean’s mouth floods with spurt after spurt of Cas’ release, bitter and salty and perfect. He gentles his touches, releases Cas’ cock from his mouth as Cas shudders through the aftershocks of his climax. It takes longer than usual for him to come down, Dean notes, only a little bit smug about it.
Castiel slides his tongue over the chapped edge of his lower lip. He knows he needs to answer Dean, but for some reason, he can’t quite remember the steps involved to make his vessel speak. Instead, he nods, wide-eyed and mute, a frisson of…of
Cas gets serious, a little anxious, then reaches down to rifle through his bags. He pulls out a small, flat package and slides it across the table. “A little something for you,” he says.
Dean takes a long sip, closing his eyes as the hot liquid soothes its way down his throat. He already feels more human—more energized,
Baby rattles with the sound of it, speakers humming strains of electric guitar, and Dean drums his fingers on the steering wheel to release some of the nervous energy pulsing through his body. He can feel Castiel’s gaze on him, hot and heavy and intense, but he can’t return it. Knows he’ll incinerate if he even dares to glance over at him, and then Baby’s interior would be ruined and he can’t have that now, can he?
“I believe I was promised a show,” Cas mouths against Dean’s neck as he drags his lips up the straining tendon, teeth grazing the skin just enough to make Dean squirm.
Castiel’s lips curl at the corners, stretching his mouth into just a tiny little hint of a smile as he listens.
Dean can’t remember the last time making out had him this riled up, ready to burst; it’s got to have been at least a couple decades. But this? This is something different, something special; it’s Cas and him and Dean didn’t think this was even in the realm of possibilities for a fuckup like him, let alone something Cas would want to, and it’s got him twisted up all taut like a guitar string pulled too tight. He bends his knees and plants his feet on the bed, graveyard muddied boots and all, and Cas settles into that space between his legs like it was made for him, like this is where he’s always belonged. And, if Dean stops to consider it, he’s pretty sure it is.
“D-dean?” Cas stuttered, shy and unsure, as Dean nosed along the hard line of his erection, opened his mouth and let Castiel feel the heat of his breath through too many layers of clothing, then took the pull of his zipper between his teeth. “W-what are you doing?”
“What on earth could be the purpose for semen coagulating like that? It seems like a flaw in the design.”
upset. For a fleeting second, the image of Dean kissing his way along Cas’ jaw floods Dean’s senses, overwhelming him. Dean shakes it off.
And then Cas is kissing him again, wild and hungry, even as he’s pressing Dean down into the memory foam soft and gentle, like Dean’s something precious, something you take care of, and it’s all so much Dean forgets he’s supposed to panic at feeling another dude’s dick rubbing up against his own. Because…because
At least Cas has the decency not to say anything when Dean slumps into the driver seat and closes the door, a bit more forcefully than he probably should. Instead, he rifles through the interior pockets of his coat and pulls out a wrinkled napkin, which he holds out toward Dean, a silent peace offering. With an eyeball and frustrated huff, Dean grabs it from Cas’ hand. Starting from the lowest dribble, he carefully wipes up his sleeve, collecting all the crap, which, thankfully, doesn’t seem to have penetrated into the leather.
“So is loving a human,” Cas counters, biting into the over-sensitive skin of Dean’s neck, “among so many other rules I’ve disregarded.” And, okay,
Pulling into the parking lot, Dean maneuvers Baby away from any possible perches for feathered poop-machines (intelligent or not, their shit is corrosive), and then…well, fuck. He freezes. Because this ain’t someone he picked up at a bar, a one-night stand to love and leave. It’s
True pain, he realized, was in feeling what he wanted more than anything in creation slip away forever, dissolving back into nothing as his eyes came to focus on the snarl distorting the beauty of Dean’s features.
“What?” If his answer comes across as a little exasperated? Well, of course it does. Dean parked Baby in this spot specifically to avoid this situation.
, Sam thinks, filing that little bit of information away for later, before he takes a moment to really look at his friend. Cas is visibly anxious, and that, in itself, sets off a red flag.
Cas rolls his eyes at him. “I would take entire responsibility for its care and maintenance, so you wouldn’t have to worry about ‘cleaning out their shit from boxes.’ And cats are quite intelligent, and with proper training and enrichment, wouldn’t ‘scratch shit up.’”
Dean barked out a laugh in response, closing the distance between them in a few bouncy steps. “God, you’re a dork,” he said, with a wry little shake of his head, before pulling Castiel into his arms.
The sound of the dishwasher closing snapped him out of his haze. Castiel shouldered past Sam, fleeing to his temporary sleeping quarters before he could cause any more damage.
“Good boy.” Cas takes a sharp inhale at the praise, his eyelids fluttering, and fuck, does Dean love him like this. Loves that he’s the one person in the whole goddamn world who gets to see Cas lose himself to pleasure.
Cas mirrored the pattern of Dean’s breath—in, then out; in, then out—and his head began to clear. Reluctant yet determined, he willed his eyes to open and looked up, his vision clouded by unshed tears. His own desperate gaze met with a tenderness in those familiar golden green eyes that was anything but.
Cas lowers Dean onto the mattress, reverent and loving, and then collapses next to him with a sigh. “That was…” Cas drifts off, his eyes closing, and he’s so damn beautiful Dean could cry.
“Yeah, it was,” Dean replies, pressing his lips to Cas’ cheek. “Thank you,” he continues, barely louder than a whisper, “for…for, uh…y’know.”
And Castiel was, after all, a mere mortal. Even though he knew it wasn’t real, knew it in the depths of whatever pitiable simulacrum of a soul Metatron had left him with, Castiel didn’t care. Not when Dean Winchester was looking down at him with love in his eyes, offering up his heart’s desire on a golden platter.
“You’re…what…is it,” Dean’s voice trembles; any attempt at actual words getting lost somewhere between his head and his mouth, leaving nothing but a broken whisper. “Cas?”
“I…I,” Cas stutters, running a hand through his hair, again refusing to meet Sam’s eyes. “Perhaps it would be better if…if I showed you.”
His eyes lingering on Dean storming around the kitchen, Castiel continued back-stepping toward the hall until he met six and a half feet of human wall.
When he’s finished that bite, Dean admits, “Yeah, this was a good stop.” He’s rewarded with a dazzling smile, and yeah, he definitely needs to let Cas pick the pit stops more often.
“Cas,” Dean begins, his voice coming out shakier than it should for some reason, “you okay?” For what feels like eternity, he waits for a response, watching as Cas continues to look a thousand yards past something out the window. The angel’s jaw tenses and releases once, twice, and then a third time, but still, he says nothing.
, he’s okay with it. The thought barely has time to flitter through his mind before Dean is moving, pulling his angel—
tugging inside him, a pressure deep in his chest that somehow reaches all the way up to pull the corners of his lips into a soft smile. In that moment, something clicks. Years of dancing around each other and avoiding what he feels and what he wants have led to this moment, right here, and it’s all because a bird shat near his car.
there. “Cas,” Dean says, in an utterly manly tone that is absolutely nothing whatsoever like whining. “Let’s
Dean licks his lips, realizing half a second too late that he’d shifted his gaze to Cas’ mouth in the process.
With a final kiss to the tip of Castiel’s nose, Dean rose to his feet and held his hand out. “Come on, babe, let’s go to bed.”
“Cas,” Dean whines at it, at the too muchness of it all, because Cas will know what to do. Cas always knows just what he needs, even if he don’t know himself, and so Dean lets Cas take over, take care of him.
Ain’t like John Winchester’s gonna pop out of the carefully restored Victorian shopfront just to question Dean’s sexuality, that’s for sure.
takes care of him. The angel grips his hips tight, angelic fingers digging sharply into the meat of Dean’s ass, and slams him back down as he thrusts up.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says when Dean slides a mug over, smiling when he sees the bee made in the foam. For the next little while, they enjoy their drinks in companionable silence, with Cas happily people-watching the bustling of the shop and Dean watching Cas with just as much delight. When he takes a bite of his honey bun, Dean breaks that silence with a pleased moan that has Cas snapping to attention.
“It’s just past this cross street on the left.” With his gentle direction, Cas pulls Dean from the rant starting to bubble up, redirecting his attention to finding a place to park. Given the weather, Dean’s surprised at how busy the thoroughfare is, but then again, maybe this isn’t that bad for a town in the Snow Belt. He has to drive well past the coffee shop before they find what he
us?” He was babbling, the words coming out faster than his brain could piece them into a logical order, but time was of the essence, after all. What with his heart about to cartoon explode from his ribcage.
“That’s not—I mean, it wasn’t like that,” Sam pursed his lips, not meeting Dean’s gaze. “You gotta cut him some slack, Dean. You know better than anyone that djinn shit is intense. He just needed a little time to say goodbye.”
Dean grins up at her, because yeah, she’s not wrong. His rumpled, bed-headed boyfriend is fucking hot. Ain’t nothing wrong with her appreciating the view.
“Cas,” he whines, sliding his palms up the planes of Castiel’s back, groaning as the muscles ripple at his touch. The skin beneath his hands is hot, hot enough that Dean wonders if it’s an angel thing, but only for a second or three because when Cas grinds down against his crotch, all thought abandons ship, leaving nothing but a litany of
“It’s just…that’s three days, man.” Dean pulled the inside of his left cheek between his teeth and bit down as hard as he could without flinching. Took another couple breaths and tried to tamp down the worry threatening to gnaw its way out of his gut. Tried not to worry about Cas going radio silent on them, especially now that he wasn’t invincible. Stubborn bastard, insisting on going off on his own. Dean reminded himself to breathe again. Then, upon noticing the taste of copper flooding his mouth, he relaxed his jaw so that the chewed up bit of his cheek fell free of his teeth.
Even stranger, he’s sober, but not hungover. It’s been so long since that has happened, Dean just doesn’t know how to process. Maybe he should pass the fuck back out.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam’s voice was gentle. “Welcome back to the land of the living.” He twisted in his seat so that he could reach back to pat Castiel’s shoulder. The touch was soft, nicer than he deserved, certainly, but it still made Castiel jerk away. Sam gave him a knowing, pursed-lip smile before turning his attention back to Dean. “We should take Cas to the hospital, get him checked out, don’t ya think?”
Dean drops his head back against the door with a thunk, offering up more of his neck for Cas to nibble and lick and kiss. “Fuck yeah, Cas,” he pants, pushing his hips forward for more friction, rubbing his hands along Castiel’s sides, “feels so good.” But then those strong fingers are tugging at his hair, the pressure just this side of too rough, and it pulls a groan from somewhere deep in Dean’s throat.
Washing dishes, likewise, had been a mistake. “For fuck’s sake, Cas, we gotta a dishwasher for a reason,” Dean said, rolling his eyes, as he grabbed the dish brush from Cas. “You’re just wastin’ time doing shit by hand.”
Bundling back up to face the cold, they quickly make their way over to the Aurora Sunrise B&B. “Yelp says it’s ‘queer friendly’ and has king-sized beds in all suites, Dean,” Cas had said before they left the Honey Beanery, like he was ramping up for a debate on the subject. But he didn’t need to because he had Dean convinced with “it’s just across the street.”
Castiel reached for Dean’s outstretched hand and rose to stand, allowed Dean to guide him into the bedroom, to
It took some maneuvering, but eventually he wrangled Dean to his feet so that they could fumble down the staircase, Dean’s arm slung haphazardly over his shoulders while Castiel worked carefully to avoid any further contact. The warm weight of Dean’s arm was enough torment, searing like a burn even through the layers of his t-shirt and hoodie.
“Doin’ okay there, angel?” he asks, resting his head against Cas’ thigh and grinning up at him like the cat that ate the canary.
“I-I…how—” he stutters, stumbles over his words; he can’t remember the last time he felt this called out. It’s like he’s trapped in a floodlight or pinned down under a microscope, naked and trembling and completely, utterly on display, touched and excited that Cas has noticed, but humiliated that it’s something there for Cas to notice.
Dean continued to caress Castiel’s chin, his jaw; he stroked a fingertip up the stubble on Castiel’s cheek, then slid his fingers through the tangle of his hair.
Dean looks over his shoulder to where Cas has stopped behind him, and levels an icy glare that he hopes bores right into the center of the angel’s grace. For several long moments, they’re in stasis, green eyes defiantly locked on blue. Sam likes to say it’s eye-fucking, but right now, it feels more like a game of chicken, and Dean’s a stubborn motherfucker. He’s not gonna break, dammit. He’s not gonna look away first.
,” Dean whimpers into the sweat-slick skin at the crook of Castiel’s neck, as he feels his climax approaching from the dual onslaught of the cock against his hole and the friction of Castiel’s belly against his dick. He grinds artlessly into it until he’s at the edge, on the verge of the most intense orgasm of his whole damn life, when the tip of Castiel’s cock catches on his rim for just a moment. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is all she wrote. Dean’s whole body tenses and then he’s exploding, shooting hot and wet between their bodies as he comes.
“Look, I…lemme just get my sorry ass outta your hair.” He offered up a weak imitation of his best shit-eating grin and began to close the distance between them. He could do this.
As soon as they’re both out of the car, Cas starts up, talking as if he’d just pressed pause on a conversation while they were riding.
be his angel—rewards him with a slow-blooming smile, one that starts in the corners of his eyes and gradually moves across his whole face. He opens his mouth, about to speak—
As far as first kisses go, it’s pretty damn tame. Dry and soft, just a delicate press of lips to lips for the most fleeting, blink and you miss it, of moments. Nothing to write home about, and yet…it’s everything. In that moment, Dean’s entire world shifts approximately 7 degrees off its axis. When he opens his eyes, all he can see or think or feel is Cas. Blue eyes sparkling at him, the warmth of his breath heating Dean’s skin, the solid pressure of his body against Dean’s. “Let’s go back to the motel.”
“Lift.” Transfixed, Dean raises his arms over his head, overwhelmed and obedient, so that Cas can slip his shirt the rest of the way off. All he wants in this moment is to feel that perfect golden skin against his own, to get another taste of those perfect, salt-sweet lips.
Dean’s voice is honey-smooth, and it intensifies that fluttering sensation in Castiel’s solar plexus. Castiel’s breath hitches, and suddenly, his tongue feels much too heavy in his throat. Once again, he finds himself baffled by the minutiae of his vessel’s physiological responses to unremarkable stimulae. There’s no reason the sound of a human voice should elevate his heart rate, and yet, the velvety timbre of Dean’s command does just that.
“I don’t have the patience to draw this out any longer, Dean,” Cas says, his eyes gone all dark and predatory as he tosses Dean down onto the creaky old bed. And yeah, it ain’t the most comfortable of landing spots, and Dean’s not as young as he used to be, but how is Dean supposed to be bothered with that sort of thing when Cas is looming over him, all primal and sex growly?
does that make Dean squirm. Held tight by the man he loves, like it’s nothing, writhing against the soft material of his pretty lingerie. Dean’s halfway gone already.
He backs Baby into a spot as far from any potential sky-pest perches as possible, and makes sure to grab the birdshit cup before he locks up.
Castiel, former Angel of the Lord, current human boyfriend (god, that makes Dean sound like a fucking teenage girl) of human disaster, Dean Winchester. And he’s just sitting there, head tilted and squinting at Dean like he’s a riddle, a mystery. Some equation to be solved, a tangled web to be unraveled with enough time and quiet contemplation.
There’s another pulse of that ethereal warmth as the room floods with the scent of ozone, and then the head pops past the ring of muscle, now gone all soft and pliant. With a single, agonizingly slow stroke, Cas buries himself to the hilt, and then just stays there, kissing Dean within an inch of his goddamn life.
The rain beat down on the panels of what was left of the roof, each drop beating its own harsh, arrhythmic contribution to the overwhelming cacophony inside the decrepit old warehouse. Somewhere far above his head, part of that crumbling roof had given up the ghost, allowing the rain to find its way through a rusted out patch of metal. By the time it reached Castiel, however, the rain had slowed to little more than dull droplets that hit, without any discernible pattern, on the inner corner of his left eye.
his eyes never leaving Castiel’s face, Dean dragged that cursed zipper pull down, tooth by infuriating tooth. When he finished, approximately three eons after he began, Dean winked, gave his eyebrows a wicked little waggle, and then poked just the tip of his tongue into the newly opened space in Castiel’s trousers. The tease of it, that delicate little hint of a caress along his boxer-clad shaft, hit Castiel with the force of a bullet.
Dean gulps an awkward breath of air and then let’s go, singing along loud off-key at the chorus. “You shook me alllll night long,” he starts, finally daring to dart his eyes toward Cas, who’s just staring at him all delighted, like he’s a basket full of kittens and pie, “yeah
” Dean’s heart was beating so hard he had a moment of fear that he was about to get Looney Tuned. Cas dreamed of
Cas’ smile grows larger as he carefully moves one hand aside to reveal a small, grey ball of fluff snuggled up against his chest. When Cas scratches at the top of the fluff with his index finger, the ball starts to stretch and purr, pressing its head up into Castiel’s finger.
curiosity, at least not anymore. The white-blue angelic grace that used to shine from those crystalline eyes might be gone for good now, but the light that’s replaced it is warm and human and composed, in its entirety, of pure love. Affection.
“Guess I get to go first.” Dean waggles his eyebrows suggestively, pleased with the soft smile that toys at the corner of Angela’s lips in response. “I’ll have the apple pie waffle and a side of bacon, please, darlin’.” She makes a point to brush dainty, soft fingers against his hand as she takes the menu from Dean’s hands.
“You okay, man?” Sam starts, “did you get zapped by something?” He crosses the room, ready to offer whatever aid he can to…someone with the power to heal themselves who probably doesn’t need his help for that sort of shit.
“Y’know that’s cheating,” Dean breathes, notes the hint of ozone, as a second finger wriggles its way in beside the first, “prob’ly against some angel rule to use your grace like that.”
“Thanks, man. This is perfect,” he says as he takes another drink. Dean turns and catches the eye of the lone waitress, currently delivering an order a couple tables away. She flashes a bright smile and nods their way. “You almost ready to order?” he asks, returning his attention to where Cas is still scrutinizing the plastic-covered menu. He gets only a grunt in response.
Dean said nothing as he drove. Only the tremble of his left hand as he gripped the steering wheel even tighter gave any indication that he’d heard Sam at all.
A ghost in a rumpled trenchcoat and suit, all too familiar except it’s now entirely black, and that beautiful, almost completely new light in his eyes, shiny with unshed tears.
“Well,” he clears his throat, swallowing awkwardly around a tongue too big for his mouth, “it’s just…well,
He’s only vaguely aware of it as Cas untangles his fingers from Dean’s hair, slides his hands down to his shoulders and pushes, Dean’s own arms wrapped tight around Cas’ middle, clinging to him like one of those sloths in the nature documentaries Cas loves so much. It’s not like Cas minds, if the breathy sighs and Enochian words mumbled against Dean’s mouth are any indication.
When Dean obeyed Castiel’s command, Castiel obeyed his, pushing deep into that wet heat until the head of his cock bumped against the back of Dean’s throat. He curled his fingers around Dean’s head as he pulled out, and with no warning, thrust back in. Again and again, at times pausing to hold Dean still, push in even deeper, then moaning at the contractions when Dean swallowed around him. He fucked into Dean’s mouth with abandon, relishing at the sounds Dean made, those little choked off grunts and gasps. Shameless and wanton, he let himself go, did as Dean had commanded. And all the while, he marveled at the beautiful, righteous man kneeling before him, giving himself over to Castiel like this, not only allowing himself to be used, but
“I take it you approve?” he asks with one of his signature head tilts, nodding toward Dean’s plate, and Dean feels that gaze heating him up inside. His mouth is full of pastry, though, so all he can do is nod as he chews.
“I don’t think you understand just how wise ravens are.” His gravelly voice is slightly less monotone than usual. Which, for Cas, is practically the equivalent of shouting.
A blast of warm, dry air greets them as they open the door to the shop. “Welcome to the Honey Beanery,” calls a perky young woman from behind the counter, “let me know if I can help you find anything!”
“Wait, Dean,” Cas begins. “I…I need to know what this…” His voice trails off, a shadow of uncertainty flickering across that beautiful face, dimming the light in those ice-blue eyes. Cas draws his lower lip between his teeth as he glances down at the floor. “I can’t…” he says, voice tremulous, and Dean has to fix it. Has to wipe away the uncertainty, to kiss where Cas chews timidly on his lip, has to make it better. Has to make it
“Shit, sweetheart, what’s got into you?” Dean practically growled, and all Castiel could do in response was whimper, wordless and plaintive. Dean welcomed it, though, rewarded his desperation with another bruising kiss, and then dropped to his knees.
Cas peers at him for a few more moments, maybe an eon or two, and then walks to the passenger side of the car and gets in.
“Close,” Cas manages to grunt, and this time, Dean doesn’t back off, slips his thumb deeper inside Cas as he tugs furiously on his cock.
“‘kay, Cas.” Dean reaches for the box, shy and awkward all of sudden, and then hurries to the bathroom. Cleaning up in the fancy ass spa shower (seriously, what kind of shower has a fucking bench seat in it?) works to settle his nerves, even as it riles him up, thinking about getting himself ready for Cas. So maybe he lingers for a little while, enjoying all those extra shower heads and reconsidering his stance on shower sex. Later.
When the angel’s mouth drops open, Dean responds with a slight grin, equal parts shy and shit-eating. “See somethin’ you like?” he husks, the intensity of Castiel’s gaze sending heat to pool deep in his gut.
“Look, I get it. You’re upset, but it’s not like he was trying to get hurt. It’s not like he went out looking for it.”
Dean goes weak at the answer, his lips tremble and he wants to speak, to respond with words as profound and magnificent and worthy of Cas, but he’s...he’s
it like, Sam?” Dean crossed the kitchen in a few steps as the anger that had been a constant bubbling beneath his skin threatened to boil over. “If it wasn’t like that, then why won’t you tell me?” He stopped mere inches away from Sam, hands clenching into fists at his sides, eyes narrowed into a defiant glare. “Huh?”
Dean feels his lips curl into a smile of his own, warm and content, as he takes in furtive glimpses of Cas browsing the coffee shop website. At how his brows furrow in concentration or widen with delight. The way his lips move, in silence, sometimes as he reads. Dean wonders if Cas even notices that he’s doing it.
suite that takes up the entire third floor of the renovated Victorian house. As soon as he crosses the threshold, Cas is on him like an animal, feral and ferocious, pressing their bodies together, running long fingers through his hair. A refrain of ‘
Just this once, Dean thinks, it’s okay to let go, to lose himself in sensation, to the thousands of pinprick stings of Cas tugging on his hair, to the damp heat of Cas’ mouth against the hinge of his jaw, to the squeeze of those powerful thighs against his own. He lets himself get lost in the moment, and soon he’s floating in it, completely surrounded and protected in the warmth of his angel.
; not now, with Dean so close, his mouth hot against him. Castiel’s hips bucked forward of their own volition, his body seeking more from Dean’s mouth. And to his delight, Dean obliged, pulling him through the opening of his boxers, his fingertips caressing down Castiel’s hard length as he lapped up the liquid collected at the tip with teasing kitten licks and delicate swirls of his tongue.
That smile grows wider, and Cas’ face floods with relief, and seeing Cas like that makes something in Dean’s gut unclench, comforted to realize that Cas was nervous, too. Dean meets that smile with one of his own.
Once he pulled away from Dean’s mouth, Castiel collapsed to the floor in a sweaty, rumpled heap, his legs no longer willing to exert the effort required to remain upright. Panting, his chest still heaving, he dared a glance in Dean’s direction and found him grinning, wide and utterly cheeky.
Castiel’s breath was already coming in ragged gulps when Dean turned his head just so and nosed along the length of his cock, from base to tip. Had Dean not been holding him steady, his thumbs pushing just beneath Castiel’s hip bones as his fingertips dug into the soft flesh of his buttocks, Castiel would have collapsed onto the floor. He was even more thankful for that firm grip when Dean took the head of his still-clothed cock into that sinfully warm mouth, flicking the tip of his tongue against the spot on the fabric that had darkened, damp with evidence of his arousal. The sensation sent a flicker of electricity through Castiel’s body, setting his nerve endings alight with the newly discovered pleasure.
“More, need more,” Dean chants, biting the words into the flesh of Castiel’s neck, his own skin on fire at the burn of Cas’ stubble dragging against his cheek. “Please, Cas,
He grinned, triumphant, at the tinny “whoosh” that sounded as the message sent. Obviously, since he could still send a fuckin’ text message, he wasn’t as drunk as the asshole bartender said. Take that, fucker.
against his skin that he can’t help but smile. And when he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror, he gasps. Because
Dean looked up at him, cocksure and beautiful, those magnificent eyes twinkling from beneath his golden lashes, and grinned. In that moment, he was utterly, perfectly sinful, and for the first time in his existence, Castiel understood completely why the first humans Fell. Because he would give up all the Grace he no longer had for this. Dean Winchester, kneeling before him, plush lips curled in a seductive smile, the metal of Castiel’s zipper flashing between his teeth. If this was what temptation felt like, Castiel would never stop falling.
As she walks away, he takes the crispiest slice of his bacon and pops into his mouth before turning his attention to Cas.
“Alright, Angel,” Dean teases, flashes a flirty grin toward Cas, “let’s go get you something sweet.” And even though Cas rolls his eyes in exasperation, the pretty pink that paints his cheeks lets Dean know he likes it. With one last eyebrow waggle for good measure, Dean opens the door and steps out into the winter afternoon.
Time stretched out for an eternity, the bunker silent as they stood there, watching each other with an all too familiar intensity. Dean hated it, hated the silence, but he couldn’t be the one to break it. He had to know. He couldn’t start trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered heart until it was
“I’m sorry I gave you that impression,” Cas began, “because nothing could be further from the truth. There is nothing,
Dean banged on the rust-roughened metal again, and once again was met with nothing but a hollow echo from within. Turning to lean against the door, he fumbled in his pockets for his phone. He slid down the door until he landed on cold cement, then set to work fat fingering a message to Asshole McGee.
This time, it’s Cas who takes the lead, surging up to lick into Dean’s mouth with a feral growl. He kisses Dean with a bruising force, staking claim with lips and teeth and tongue. Dean melts into it, meets the desperation of Castiel’s desire with his own, sucking on the tip of the angel’s tongue, scratching his fingernails along the back of Cas’ neck.
From what he can make out through the whipping snow, the main drag of West Aurora consists of about three blocks, lined with quaint little lamp posts flying rainbow flags, populated by fancy little shops and cafes that probably charge way too much for fancy versions of shit Dean buys at Walmart. Locally-sourced, organic shit, the kind of stuff that hippies buy with their middle-management incomes to stick it to the man.
From the backseat came a barely audible whimper, and it echoed in his head like a scream. “Cas?” Dean begged, “You hear me, buddy?” Another whimper. Dean scrambled into the back seat and pillowed Cas’ head on his lap. “Come on,” he said, stroking a damp lock of hair off Cas’ forehead, “you gotta wake up.” As he continued petting Cas’ hair, he noticed the tears wetting his temples.
, and Dean doesn’t care a single lick about how the bolt of the chain lock is digging into his back because Cas is mouthing wet kisses up Dean’s neck, teeth grazing the skin straining against the tendon, and Dean’s legs may have turned into jelly. But who cares, that’s abso-fucking-lutely
Pathetic as much as it was demanding, his voice was so high, already so wrecked and breathy, that it took a long moment for Castiel to recognize that the pleas were coming from him. But whatever, it didn’t matter. Nothing did,
Dean let his head fall back and closed his eyes while he waited. Just for a bit, while Sam took the long-ass way from wherever he was to open the stupid magic door. And so what if he started to doze off? Fuck you, Sammy. Whatever.
They may not be in Looney Tunes Land anymore, but Dean’s pretty sure he sees actual stars. Cas fucks him like that for fuck knows how long, Dean’s lost track of time, of space, of anything that isn’t Cas’ cock thrusting into him, the friction of silk rubbing against his own. The entire world has compressed down to this. To the sweaty press of their bodies, to their breath as they pant and moan and gasp, to
into Dean’s mouth, and then Dean’s coming, shooting hot and wet between them, the muscles of his abdomen clenching and twitching as he just keeps coming, like a goddamn teenager, but that’s okay because it sets Cas off, too, and then they’re both shaking with it, wet and messy and oversensitive but still desperate for it, for each other, unwilling to separate.
Leaning back against weathered red vinyl, Dean reaches for his coffee. Because of course Cas has already ordered it for him.
, and suddenly it feels like Cas ain’t just talking about how good Dean looks in a little lace and silk, and it’s almost too much to take.
The ride goes a lot faster after that. Just that small gesture—bringing his palm to slide against the back of Cas’ hand, slipping his fingers between Cas’—soothes the butterflies dancing in his gut, grounds and steadies him, even as it turns the simmer of arousal up closer to a boil. Cas is squeezing the muscle of his thigh now, just a gentle, kneading pressure, but it shoots sparks straight to Dean’s dick, which is starting to get really interested in the proceedings, especially when Cas lets his pinky graze along Dean’s inner thigh.
Cas tilts his head and squints at Dean, curious. He gives a barely perceptible quirk of one eyebrow, encouraging Dean to continue.
But this Dean? Rough edges and solid muscle (and okay, a hint of a tummy) wrapped up in slinky silk and lace? He feels
It’s different. Cas is not a small man, and it’s different from what Dean’s used to. So different to have that extra weight in his lap, to have another hard-on grinding against his own, to feel the friction of Castiel’s chest hair dragging against his own, but fuck if it’s not incredible. Dean’s trembling, feels like he’s gonna vibrate out of his skin at any moment, his whole world condensed down to the press of Cas’ body against his, the sea-salt taste of his skin under Dean’s tongue.
His brain struggles to comprehend, to process everything, even as he body just responds, mindless, to the hot bulge grinding against his own erection. He rocks and gyrates his hips, rubbing their dicks together, seeking out more friction. After all this time, he can’t believe it, that he’s got his angel here, holding him and kissing him and it’s better than he ever imagined and then without warning it’s
. Besides, when Cas drags the flat of his tongue up and then nips at his jaw, Dean’s brain melts, and what even are rules, anyway?
Sam’s brow furrowed so that his forehead made that odd center wrinkle, then visibly relaxed as he breathed. “Alright, Cas. I won’t tell him,” he began, “but I still think you should.”
“Too many clothes,” Dean manages to pant between kisses. “Can we…” he reaches for the trenchcoat and pushes it down Castiel’s shoulders, just far enough for Cas to get the memo. In a flash, it’s gone, along with every other cloth barrier between them. Dean groans at the first graze of skin against skin.
Dean leaned in for another kiss, then nuzzled their noses together. It was painfully intimate, and Castiel was torn between the conflicting desires to flee and to freeze himself in this moment forever.
When they reached the lower level of the Bunker, Castiel tried to duck out from Dean’s hold, but the hunter clung stubbornly, curling the broad fingers to squeeze at the cap of Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean faded, as well, leaving nothing but a cavernous ache in their stead, an ache augmented by the razor-sharp fangs of Dean’s rage. It was too much to bear, to see the thinly veiled disgust in those clear green eyes. To know that he had ruined whatever tenuous bond of friendship that remained between them with his own selfish weakness.
Without realizing it, Dean’s crawled into Cas’ lap, knees bracketing his hips as he kisses, desperate and wild and hungry, more teeth and tongue than anything resembling finesse. But it’s okay, of
“Right.” Dean scanned the warehouse for signs of another djinn, blade held at the ready. “Get him down, Sammy.”
“Dean,” he growls as he levels a stern gaze at the human, “they are not just ‘flying poop machines.’ You should show these creatures their due respect.”
Dean watched his words disappear, into the chasm of doubt and regret that kept driving him and Cas further and further apart. His head throbbed, the pain radiating from where he’d hit it, wrapping around his temples to his forehead and squeezing like vise. He rubbed between his eyebrows, hoping to alleviate some of the growing tension.
Dean slides a strong hand across the chipped formica table, palm up and open, as open as those golden-green eyes boring straight into the core Castiel’s being. “You…uh, you wanna,” Dean begins, shy and almost hesitant, “you wanna get outta here?”
“But they frolic, Dean,” Cas says, all earnest and eager. “They have been known to use tools, and they remember human faces, and they
, and wants Dean. It’s a heady feeling, intoxicating…nerve-wracking and terrifying, if Dean’s honest with himself, because how the fuck is a mess of a man like him supposed to live up to the expectations of a fucking
“So, where were we?” he asks, mid-chew, laughing when Cas rolls his eyes and mutters something about manners under his breath.
, Cas’ mouth on his while he’s stuffed full of angel cock, but Dean starts to get antsy, needs more. Needs Cas to
, really, as best as Dean can figure. He’s looking in Dean’s direction, but refusing to look Dean in the face.
“As you wish, beloved.” Dean feels a slight pressure as Cas rubs his hole, teasing the sensitive pucker with his fingertip before it goes all warm and slick. He chokes off a moan as that finger breeches his rim, throws his head back in pleasure at the smooth glide of it, at the surprisingly gentle stretch.
There’s a delicate sensation, something his touch-starved ass can only interpret as a caress, ghosting along his cheek, soft and reassuring. It’s like fingers gently carding through the hair above his ear, and it’s better than Christmas. Dean purrs like a goddamn kitten at it, snuggles in closer to whatever the fuck beautiful illusion is happening. Hopes he never wakes.
Cas stalks toward the bed, and Dean needs more eyes. Yeah, definitely needs more eyes because he can’t look everywhere at once, can’t take in the slight swell of Castiel’s chest at the same time as he watches the muscles in his stomach stretch and flex beneath smooth skin as he moves, as blue eyes pin him with a look of absolute hunger. It’s too much to take in, and Dean has to remind himself to breathe
A nondescript wooden sign at the side of the narrow road marks the town limits for West Aurora, New York and directs them toward the town center two miles south.
” More tears spill down his cheeks, but it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters but here and now and Castiel is back and he’s got to get this out. “You left before I could—”
It takes a bit, but eventually their movements sync up, awkward rutting giving way to a rhythmic push and pull as they rock together, and Dean can feel the orgasm coiling up at the base of his spine like a snake getting ready to strike. Cas is chanting something in Enochian as he licks and sucks up and down Dean’s neck, and Dean just babbles in response, not sure if he’s actually saying words or just moaning.
Dean opens his hand just enough to get a hold of them both, and soon they’re just rutting together, artless and wild and frantic. Cas wraps one of his large hands around them, too, and fuck fuck
Castiel swallows back a sudden fluttering of nervous energy, and then proceeds. “I seriously think you need to reconsider your opinion about ravens. Corvids deserve our respect. I’d like to show you a video that I think will prove enlightening.” He remembers that he has visual aids to assist in his argument, and reaches deep into his coat pocket to collect his phone.
“Do you want me to fuck you like this, Dean?” The angel’s voice is a low growl, rough and dangerous. “Holding you like this? Just slip your panties out of the way so that I can penetrate you? Would you like that?”
Dean turns to get a glimpse of his rear view, and not to brag or nothing, it’s a pretty good one. The top of the panties rests low on ass, highlights the roundness of his cheeks pretty damn nicely. Now for the top, intricate lace with silk edging, and softer than any lace he’s ever encountered (which, granted, isn’t
“Open your eyes,” he says to Cas. Those ice-blue eyes lock onto Dean like he’s a beacon in the night. “ Take a deep breath, baby,” he commands, and Cas immediately obeys, his chest rising on the inhale as he watches Dean. “Now hold it.” Cas nods wildly.
Okay, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but Dean’s a little on edge, and has been since Cas shifted slightly in the passenger seat and rested his hand on the top of Dean’s thigh. Dean can feel the hot press of each point of contact—Cas’ broad palm, the length of each digit—even through thick denim, and it sends tiny jolts of electricity up and down his body. His whole body is alight with it, with the dull thrum of arousal simmering just beneath his skin, and all from what? A G-rated kiss and hand on his goddamn knee? It’s ridiculous, is what it is, but apparently Dean’s body doesn’t give a rat’s ass about how a grown-ass man is supposed to be able to control himself.
The short drive to the diner is quiet. Dean isn’t in the mood for music, and Cas has learned his lesson about messing with the radio without the driver’s expression consent. Completely still, the angel just stares off into the distance, head tilted approximately seven degrees to the left. Dean’s not sure what Castiel actually does when he gets like that, if he’s listening to angel radio, meditating, reciting an epic poetry in his head…yeah, it’s weird, inasmuch as Cas’ little quirks are weird, but over the years it’s just become a thing that he does. Dean drives; Sam bitches; and Cas stares, unmoving, out into the distance of whatever patch of Americana they happen to be passing through.
“Y’ready to get breakfast?” He asks, voice falsely bright, and rubs his palms together. “Think I saw a diner on the way into town last night.”
“I’m sorry, Dean.” It had become a common refrain, a near constant stream of apologies for messing up, coming up short, for letting Dean down. Castiel folded in on himself as he backed away, trying not to let his mind wander to that hazy golden memory of…no, not memory. The
When a message came back a couple minutes later, Dean squinted at the screen, attempting to make sense of the swirl of letters for what felt like an hour. Okay, maybe he was a
“I believe you can make it to your bedroom on your own.” Castiel’s voice wobbled as he began to prise Dean’s fingers loose from his shoulder, and for the thousandth time since it happened, Castiel cursed Metatron for his humanity. For forcing him to live out a mortal life in a body as frail as his own resolve. For giving him the pathetic existence that he deserved.
to feign disinterest. Something about this human, this Righteous Man, the Sword of Michael…something about Dean Winchester, in particular, makes Castiel
It had bothered him at first, not being able to wipe away the raindrops. Bothered him enough to bring him to the surface, blinking back into this blurred, nightmarish excuse for reality. But that was before.
. He’s warm, warm in a way he hasn’t felt since...before it happened. Before he broke. Before that fucked up part of him decided to sit constant vigil on the cold, hard floor of a goddamn dungeon.
Sam does not have the time or energy to try and mediate yet another one of their stupid-ass squabbles. His jaw clenches of its own volition, and he pushes his tongue up against the roof of his mouth while taking a few slow, deliberate breaths.
Dean watched as Sam rubbed his eyes, then ran his hands through his hair. Owlishly, he blinked back into awareness, eventually acknowledging Dean’s existence. “Whuh?”
“What’s with the whole ‘deer caught in the headlights’ routine, huh?” Dean’s brow furrowed as he spoke, those golden green eyes soft with concern, though his lips still curved into a slight tease of a smile. He brought a calloused fingertip to beneath Castiel’s chin, caressed the front with the pad of his thumb as he gently lifted Castiel’s face up to meet his own. “You okay, angel?”
Cas pulls him into his arms, wraps him up in warmth and safety, somehow making him feel small even though he knows he’s larger than Cas.
Cas’ broad smile is all the evidence Dean needs to know that he recognizes the significance of the offering, and Dean sends out a silent prayer of gratitude that he doesn’t make a big thing of it. They share quiet grins as Cas interlaces their fingers, and Dean lets himself be led through the shop. In addition to standard coffee shop fare and the honey that caught Cas’ attention, the shop is filled with an eclectic assortment of artisanal products from local vendors.
“Before we proceed,” Cas says, solemn and quiet, his hand resting on the doorknob, “I need your word that you will not tell Dean.”
“More,” he grunts, thighs tightening against Cas’ hips as he tries to grind down on those wonderful fingers, “
Dean’s still coming down from his own release when he feels Cas come against his hole, spurt after spurt of it dirtying him up in the most delicious way he’s ever felt. Exhausted, Cas drops all of his weight onto Dean, and Dean just eats it up, stays all wrapped around him like a goddamn baby koala. Because
As Cas lavishes his throat with open-mouthed kisses and nips, Dean rocks his hips up, seeking out more friction against the hard line of flesh in Cas’ trousers. He claws parallel furrows down either side of Castiel’s spine, grunting his delight at the way Cas arches into it, eyes fluttering closed and purring like a kitten.
I believe it’s an offering,” Cas begins, “an apology, perhaps, for what happened this morning.” He turns his attention back to the ravens, nodding solemnly as speaks. “Your kindness is noted. Thank you.”
“Hey there, handsome,” the waitress—Angela, the name tag reads—greets him like an old friend, squeezing his shoulder familiarly as she walks up behind him. “Are you two ready to order?” Her hair, a little lighter red than Charlie’s, is piled up on top of her head, with a couple of errant curls framing her face. Dean turns on the charm, sweeping his eyes up her body just slow enough to pinken her cheeks, and grins. “Mornin’, sweetheart,” he purrs, “and I think so. Cas?”
he realizes as he tries, with only partial success, to tuck himself into the front. He looks at his reflection in the mirror and it’s….it’s obscene, is what it is, how his thickening cock is already tenting the front of the panties, pulling the soft material tighter between his cheeks. Dean swallows thickly, because that tiny brush of friction already has him feeling good.
“About damn time.” Dean spat as he foisted Castiel’s body up and toward the other side of the Impala’s back seat. Before Castiel had the wherewithal to respond, Dean was moving, slamming one door shut and opening another to get behind the wheel. As Baby roared to life, Castiel curled against the car door, sought to make himself as small as possible.
of the Impala’s tires on the seams of concrete slabs. Eventually, Sam began to doze, his head lolling onto his shoulder, muffling his snores, and it left Dean to fret in relative solitude. Somewhere around the exit for Ashtabula, the rain that had been threatening to fall for hours finally broke loose. By the time they crossed into Pennsylvania, it was a bonafide downpour, the afternoon sky dark as night except for periodic bolts of lightning that slashed through the clouds, electrifying the darkness.
“I…I—“ The angel’s whole demeanor crumples as he drops his gaze toward the floor. He suddenly looks so much smaller. “I have a confession to make.”
Castiel watches his the slow bob of the hunter’s adam’s apple in profile as Dean swallows, and suddenly he’s overcome with the desire to feel it, to push some part of himself deep into Dean’s throat. He doesn’t even realize that he’s mirroring Dean, swallowing just as thick and heavy, until Dean turns back to face him, and suddenly he’s pinned in place by the full weight of Dean’s gaze.
“Wait a minute…so you’re tellin’ me they’re paying me off for the poop?” Dean can’t keep the incredulity out of his voice, even if it does make Castiel squint at him. Damn, Cas is cute when he squints.
It’s enough to break Cas free of his reverie. He shakes his head, those icy blue eyes slightly glassy and unfocused, then blinks a couple times. When he looks up, though, he levels a piercing gaze right through Dean, once again watching him with laser-sharp focus. “Of course,” Cas murmurs as he stands, squeezing Dean’s palm with those long, slender fingers, “let’s go.”
Cas cuts him off, swallowing whatever the fuck else he was struggling to sputter out as the angel takes possession of Dean’s mouth with his lips, his teeth, his tongue. It’s primal, the force of however many thousands of years of sheer
Startled, Dean looks up from his phone to see Cas slipping into a chair across the table. Who needs a fucking cat when you’ve got a goddamn angel sneaking around the place like that. He should put a collar with a bell on the feathery motherfucker.
His heart is pounding so forcefully in his chest, the blood rushing rhythmically on the inside of his skull so loud, that for a long moment, Dean worries, remembering the dude whose heart exploded on that one case. Wouldn’t that be just his luck, to fucking explode with need before he even gets his mouth on Cas?
Dean chuckles and leans back in his seat. As he does so, the hunter’s knees brush against Castiel’s own, and the simple, unexpected touch sends a jolt of heat flaring up Castiel’s spine.
His poor Baby. She don’t like the snow, and it’s been coming down hard for a while now. Cas mentioned something about lake effect as they were passing Lake Erie, and maybe Dean should’ve been paying closer attention to what the angel was saying instead of thinking about what he wanted to do with the honey Cas was gonna buy when they stopped.
and all that, right? Only who’s Dean trying to kid here? It’s just him and Cas, and Cas won’t give him shit about liking frou-frou coffee drinks like Sammy does, so fuck it. He’s gonna enjoy the hell out of his Honey Spiced Latte, and if he feels like it, he’ll grab a second for the road.
Dean feels the flush spreading across his face, from his cheeks to the tops of his ears, and there’s never an apocalypse to swallow him up when he needs it.
Castiel swallowed, his cheeks burning at Dean’s drunken praise. “Come on, let’s get you to your room.”
Cas looked up at him from beneath his thick, dark eyelashes, and somehow managed to look simultaneously shy and annoyed. “
“Come on, man, don’t do this,” Sam said, and Dean couldn’t make out who he was talking to at first. He hadn’t noticed Sam was there at all, let alone how he Sam brushed past him to check Cas out. Dean hadn’t realized that he was still frozen in place, just inside the warehouse entrance, eyes locked on Castiel’s limp form hanging in the center of the space. Not until Sam was standing between him and Cas, hands roving over Castiel’s arms and torso, checking for damage, maybe, or for a pulse.
“Shh, you’re alright,” Cas is whispering into his hands, “I promise Sam is a friend.” Cas continues to murmur into his hands because, Sam realizes, whatever the fuck it is is
Cas takes in a long, drawn-out breath, then swallows, slow and deliberate. Dean is transfixed as he watches the angel’s throat, how his Adam’s apple bobs.
Dean gets back to it, releasing Castiel’s hips so that he can brush the fingertips of that hand up along Cas’ shaft. Then he brings his now-wet thumb between his angel’s cheeks, rubs little circles over the wrinkled flesh of his hole.
Then he felt it. A slight twitch of Cas’ head, heavy in his lap. Dean watched that chapped bottom as it began to tremble, felt the warmth of fresh tears as they pooled and fell, catching on the fabric of his shirt. And finally, that low husk of his voice, roughened by days of disuse.
He took in another shaky breath, opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. What could he possibly say to Castiel, who had lost so much because he’d had the bad luck to get caught up in Dean’s shit? With a wobbly shake of his head, Dean closed his mouth and shrugged, useless.
As Dean enveloped the head of his cock in welcoming heat, a strange fire began to coil around the base of Castiel’s spine. The embers of it ignited into flames when Dean took him deeper, began to massage the underside of his shaft with his tongue, then hollowed his cheeks and sucked as he dragged his lips back up to the tip. He repeated that pattern, taking more of Castiel into his mouth with each repetition—teasing with the flat of his tongue, then slowly sucking his way back up—once, twice, before pulling all the way off.
So he sits there, quiet, and stares at Cas the way Cas loves to stare at him. Takes a deep breath in, let’s it go.
.” Cas stutters, his whole body trembling, when Dean gets his hand around Cas’ cock, slides the pad of his thumb across the slit, down the cleft to massage his frenulum. And, yeah, maybe blowjobs will have to wait because hearing Cas swear has Little Dean ready to shoot off. There’s always next time, right?
After he pushed Castiel’s pants down around his hips, Dean buried his face in Castiel’s pelvis, nuzzling his way along the crease of his thigh, then sucking a mark into the tender skin just above the waistband of his boxers. The sensation was heady, a mixture of ticklish pleasure and pain just on the cusp of too much. Castiel threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair, his mind not quite clear on whether he wanted to pull Dean’s mouth away or press him in closer. He could feel Dean smiling against his skin, and that settled it. He definitely wanted to press him closer.
Somehow during breakfast, they musta got stuck in a weird time loop, because it takes at least 300 times longer to get back to the damn motel than it took to get there.
“Up and at ‘em, Sammy!” Taking the key out of the ignition, Dean reached over to pat Sam’s chest, forceful enough to startle him awake, then dropped the keys on his lap. “Gotta hit the head, so you’re on gas duty.”
All the while, Dean played through various worst-case scenarios in his head, the rumble of distant thunder and beating rain on the windshield the soundtrack to a thousand different nightmares that might be awaiting them in Buffalo.
“You look so very pretty in them, you know.” Cas nuzzles his face into the crook of Dean’s neck, “It was truly my pleasure. I look forward to seeing you in more.” Dean’s cheeks pinken at the prospect of more, and ain’t that just ridiculous after what they’ve just done?
He needed to rip the bandaid off, disabuse himself of that delusion before he got hurt worse. “Then why’d you…you were willing to—“ his voice was barely a whisper. “what was worth dy—what did you dream about, Cas?” He pressed his tongue against the roof of his mouth, took long breaths in through his nose, and willed the tears forming behind his eyes to clear.
This wasn’t real, and Castiel knew that. But…but what would be the harm in letting himself believe, just for a little while?
it’s okay, because Cas is here and meeting him, kiss for desperate kiss, broad palms sliding against his back, firm and solid and
Dean’s gonna explode. He doesn’t care how pathetic he must sound, whining and whimpering into Cas’ mouth. He doesn’t care that he’s still got his stupid boots on. All that matters is the man on top of him, grinding against him, kissing him stupid and whispering thinks like
Eventually they had to part, what with the stupid human need for breathing. Cas looked up at him, his face flushed and lips plumper than usual, with a look of pure awe. Disheveled and debauched, but most of all ridiculously, endearingly awestruck. It was a good look for him.
So yes, it made him sad to know he would soon lose him. Just like Dean could see the underlying sadness in each of the Shurleys.
he wasn’t imagining the crowd parting for him, everyone holding their breath as he purposefully stepped up to him. The people around were hardly of any import, though Dean did notice with no small amount of satisfaction that he seemed to interrupt a run-in with Cas’ old tormentors.
“I honestly thought you had a better poker face by now,” Dean told her with a chuckle, but took mercy on his girl right away. “We’re going to have to work on your reaction to unexpected questions. But other than that-” he risked a quick glance at her, his smile honest and full of feeling, “- I’m proud of you.”
Dean was hardly able to suppress rolling his eyes. Honestly, Cas was worse than Gracie at subterfuge - and that was saying a lot, given how well he could read his daughter.
Tried not to think about last night’s dream and how that, combined with the closeness to the man right now, made his heart speed up.
If only because it kept Cas engaged in conversation, his eyes shining, his cheeks colored, as he tried his best to argue for the authors he put in the ring.
Some murmurs were heard, but the others quickly went back to their own conversations. Only Eileen turned towards him, her eyes becoming slightly smaller as she gave him a scrutinizing look.
“So what if I did?” she finally asked back, thankfully keeping her voice low as well. “Why do you care so much for that man? You even let your daughter sit with him all day every day. Don’t you know what people are saying?”
Michael rolled his eyes but apparently had no qualms to just stand there and wait to see what direction Dean would take. He was tempted to screw with Michael, but he knew, in the end, he would lose no matter what stupid idea his brain would come up with. Instead, he simply huffed and changed directions, entering the guest bathroom and shutting the door forcefully.
Dean tried following that direction as best as he could – but he was also unable to stop himself from pressing Cas into the wall a few times along the way, only then able to let at least one hand wander along those smooth and strong planes. He needed to touch him, needed to have his hands all over him – which, of course, was hard when he had to support Cas’ weight with both hands while carrying him.
Dean was thankful at that moment that neither Alice nor Harry said anything further. He was struggling to get out the right words and they gave him the time he needed.
What on earth had he missed? Where was the memo that had the instructions for making his life that much harder?
By now, there was only one present left for Dean to hand out but every time he checked, Cas had been busy with someone else. Sure that now, right after Gracie had exchanged her gift with him, was the best time, Dean was surprised to see Cas get up and leave the room as if fleeing from him once more. But that couldn’t be it, right?
This was getting harder with every minute. “Remember how I once told you how brave it is to tell somebody what you really feel?” When she nodded, Dean needed a moment to find the right words to go on. “I was talking about Cas back then. He … he had a crush on me when he was younger.”
Yeah, that was it. That must be why this distance between them was so painful. Because there had been a time when it was different. When they would have nice conversations and laughs together. When they would play video games or talk about books or just enjoy time together.
Dean had to force himself to take his eyes off the written words, no desire to become a hypocrite after telling Gracie to put the script away. But mostly, no desire to give away one precious second spent in Cas’ presence. Not when the man seemed so comfortable again to be close to him.
After his normal morning routine of bathroom, preparing tea, getting dressed, and bringing Gracie her cup, plus the little extra time he spent to prepare some pancake batter, Dean hastened a bit to make sure he would be on his way just in time. Of course only because he wanted to spend some more minutes riding before he had to go to school.
? I mean, the fact that you didn’t want to let me help you while badly injured – it killed me, okay? And I,” Dean added, struggling still to find the words. When he couldn't find them, he finally gave up. “I don’t know. Just...”
. His movement was slow at first, most likely still adjusting, and Dean was too scared to hurt him and – quite frankly – too overwhelmed to do much more than let Cas set their pace. Cas quickly increased the tempo and it wasn’t long before Dean let go of him so Cas could really fuck himself on his dick.
At her last words, a grin stole itself on Dean’s face as he looked up at her, both dragons carefully balanced in his hands. “You mean without annoying princes to come by and kill them?”
Sighing, Dean leaned against the door, crossing his arms over his chest if only to show her that he certainly wasn’t going to take the first step in this conversation. As always, he underestimated the power the women in his life had over him. Instead of ambushing, Eileen just stood there and waited, staring – glaring, really – him into the ground.
“Yes, I’m sure,” he interrupted right away, slightly annoyed at whatever Sam had possibly told her. “Tell Uncle Sammy not to tell you stuff like that. You know you can always call me.” He would have to have
Instead of Cas, though, Dean saw plenty of other familiar faces, all of which were wishing them a Happy New Year. They politely replied in kind but never stuck around for long. That was until Dean heard two familiar voices.
“Cas?” she asked, her voice not holding an ounce of the warmth she always reserved for Dean and Grace. “As in Castiel Shurley? The boy that –”
“Wait, what?” Dean heard his brother’s surprised yell before he himself could reply to Cas’ revelation and everyone’s attention turned to Sam. He was looking back at Cas with a startled expression. “
He was driving without really caring about a destination, just mindlessly trying not to face reality. He wasn’t even sure how long he had been driving but staying focused on the snowy streets, making sure he didn’t cause an accident, that alone helped him keep his emotions in check. Eventually though, even that wasn’t enough. He stopped the car on the side of the street, gripping the steering wheel hard. In a sudden burst of anger, he hit it once, and then again and again and again and again.
Dean had been skeptical about setting up an open-air theater in the town square, sure that the gazebo would hinder a lot of the premium seating. Sure enough, it was a hindrance in some ways - but just like with the ballet, Taylor had outdone himself once more, Dean had to admit. Sure, not everybody got a chair, but all around, people stood at tables or just leaned against each other, some even braved the cold ground and sat there as if it was a picnic in summer.
Dean let the words sink in, trying to sort out his emotions. But it wasn’t all that easy and inside of him, there was a little war going on between his emotional side that wanted to be jealous; and his rational side that told him not to be a hypocrite.
The words registered and Dean did as Cas requested right away, not trying to chase his lips. Instead, he tried to read his face in the darkness; tried to decipher what had happened. Had he once again misjudged the moment?
Dean almost breathed out a laugh when the answer came to him practically as quickly as the questions formed.
Again, what a hypocrite he would be if he did that! He had no right to judge what these two had and he wouldn’t dare try.
“Guess that’s what I’ll have to do,” Gabe replied, already reaching for a pair of tongs to begin his quest.
“Michael, I’m fine,” he declared, keeping his tone more sincere, all laughter gone. Maybe this way his friend would believe him. “Why would you think I’m not fine just because Cas is back?”
spending extra care to look good today, nope, absolutely not – Gracie and Eileen came back into the living room.
Even if he hoped that it wouldn’t come to that and that instead, he would be able to talk to Cas directly.
Which, by the way, was exactly what made this experience so amazing, what had Dean even more enthusiastic, and what turned him on more than he would’ve thought.
As she followed him inside the house, Gracie gave him a funny look that had Dean confused. Her words did not make it any better.
After taking the long route home in the hopes to clear his head once more, Dean still got home with plenty of time to spare before a certain scheduled Skype call would come in. He took a little extra care of Cherry, then went inside and booted up his laptop before doing anything else. The burning hot shower already helped a lot, and when he got into the kitchen and started puttering about, he was finally able to calm himself down. It was the little things like preparing their teas, or putting together ingredients for their breakfast later on, that helped him out of his mulling over the encounter with Cas.
When neither of them answered, Dean looked up and grinned when he saw their startled and confused faces.
This time, he read it much more carefully, taking his time as he took in the story, letting himself get immersed in the plot and invested in the characters. When he went to bed that night, he was sure that his suspicions were very well-founded.
“Is Mr. James expecting you?” the man asked, thankfully not sounding suspicious, merely as if this was information he needed to know to proceed.
was why Michael had done it. Just to see Gracie smile. He quickly made a video and sent it to his friend.
“The helicopter,” Amara repeated matter-of-factly as if he simply hadn’t heard her. His dumbstruck face must’ve been enough to rectify that assumption, a little smile tugging at her lips. “The streets are still in terrible condition, so I took the liberty to call my company’s helicopter. It’ll drop you off at our publishing building and you can catch a cab from there.”
Dean woke up with a long-suffering groan. At least it wasn’t a startled “I just woke from a nightmare”-awakening. Turning towards his alarm, Dean saw that he'd made it through most of the night. It was after six in the morning and while he didn't need to be up this early on a weekend, he didn't see any chance of falling back asleep. Seemed like early morning rides would become a new ritual of his.
Meanwhile, Dean was sitting on his couch, sipping his tea, and grinning about the antics of his friends.
“Why should I? You wanna know what happened in his room yesterday?” He didn’t even wait for Michael to nod, too wound up to hold it back. “He flat out told me he didn’t want me. He called our night a mistake and that he was just living a fantasy.”
He couldn’t help himself. Hope was rising inside of him, yes… but the argument about sexual orientations seemed like an invalid one in their case.
Deciding to push the thought to the back of his mind, he shoved open the door and stepped into the storm. The cold took his breath away but it also instantly cleared his head. Looking around, he quickly saw a car that hadn’t been here before – and more importantly, he noticed the person getting out of that car. When he realized he really did see who he thought he was seeing, the last bit of air was knocked right out of him.
for taking over beta-reading this fic halfway through, for always being there for me when I need her, for knowing what I wanna say even when my words are all mashed up 😘 I love you!!
God, it felt so good! Not only to feel another person’s touch again but to know that it was actually the touch of his soulmate. Of the one that would be by his side for the rest of their life, now that they had finally found each other. Their gazes found each other again and for the first time, Dean really let himself get lost in those blue, blue eyes, no longer feeling guilty about letting their tenderness touch his heart.
Dean thought as he followed Sam, Eileen, and Bobby into the foyer. Who knew what would have happened had he met Cas alone.
“Alright, you got me,” Dean cheekily replied as he raised his hands in defense, still grinning. Best to make light of the situation - even though he could see from both Gabe and Cas’ look that there was nothing
“Thank you, Sammy,” Dean replied, his voice hardly more than a whisper, as he patted him on the shoulder and moved past him and up the stairs.
his pleasure on his tongue… It was like nothing else had ever been before. Almost maddening in how right everything felt in this moment and that was the only thing that really made sense in Dean’s mind. Everything else, every insecurity, could wait for later, for he was sure that with time – and with Cas’ gentle guidance – they would find their rhythm in this part of their relationship as well.
Didn’t mean it didn’t kill him from the inside. Especially, when Michael had confessed that Cas was packing, thinking about leaving.
“Oh God, no,” Cas interrupted and his grip on Dean’s face tightened by a fracture, Dean not even sure if Cas was aware of it. “No Dean, I assure you. There’s nothing between Zar and I. He’s straight.”
Unable to reach Cas in any way to ask if he was alright, Dean retreaded to his office once Alice and Harry had called it a night and Gracie was getting ready in the bathroom.
As Cas opened the pantry door, Dean could see five big boxes. One after another, he got them down and Dean rushed to hold open his arms for Cas to put them there directly. The last one Cas took himself.
And Dean wasn’t sure he was giving Cas exactly what he wanted but he sure as hell tried, egged on by the sweet sounds falling from Cas' lips and the hand on his ass, squeezing his cheek as if he wanted to pull him closer. Which was probably exactly what he was doing, Dean wasn’t sure. He hardly knew anything anymore, hardly cared about another coherent thought. All that mattered was the man in his arms and the feeling of thrusting into him, again and again, bringing him pleasure and seeking it for himself at the same time.
Still shaking his head, he was quick to catch the tiny golden garment Meg threw at him. It was the third she had given him as a possible option and, just like with the ones Zar was looking at, they looked exactly the same to him.
“Hey, can’t a man just be a little extra happy?” he asked, grinning at them. And knowing full well that in a few minutes the square would be buzzing with the news anyway, he felt no shame in adding, “or happily in love, for that matter?”
“Alright.” The moment he sat up straighter, he could sense the excitement in his students, who all knew what was coming. “I’ll give you a short synopsis and after that, you get your two questions.”
Dean’s heart beat wildly when he saw Cas’ soft smile, possibly remembering all those times as well. But he could also see that there was a lot of doubt and yeah, how could there not? It certainly wasn’t the best of explanations.
“Hhhmm,” Dean replied as if he was really contemplating this. He pulled Cas that little bit closer and rested his chin on his shoulder. “It’s certainly awesome and it inspired probably the greatest movie of all time. But if we stay fair: it
Right away, Dean’s eyes went wide and his head snapped back up, catching his daughter’s worried gaze.
C had to stay at the hospital for another two weeks and every day, Dean had to remind himself not to talk about the fact that he had dated someone. He didn’t even know why it bothered him so much – it wasn’t as if C and he were already together, it wasn’t as if no person on this planet had ever had other relationships other than with their intended soulmate. But somehow, it
“Just fifteen minutes. Are you cold?” When Gracie shook her head but still kept her nose buried in his warm chest, Dean looked over to Miss Patty. “Why are you here so early? Won’t the girls get cold?”
“If I let this happen… if I admit that… that it has been there all the time… I would have to admit to myself that… that- I… that…”
“I love you too, Sweetie,” he replied. “But I should probably make sure Uncle Sammy is handling the camera right –”
He was tempted to just shut his laptop, but that would be childish. Jo’s next question brought him up short anyway. “Why do you belittle his feelings like that?”
“Of course he does,” Meg called out as she searched for three matching white masks in the sea of… well, masks. Seriously, why were there so many to choose from?
Dean felt a cold shiver run down his spine. Not that he was ashamed of anything he had written – but there were certainly some things he’d rather C heard (or read) from him the first time instead of from their family. So he couldn’t help but ask.
For a few more seconds, Dean ran around his apartment, almost headless. He was about to meet his soulmate! It was finally happening and it was all because he’d been gushing about another guy and hadn’t filtered pronouns and suddenly…
“Oh, hush. Honey, you should know that we won’t judge you for who you love. No matter the gender. Or age.”
The man seemed to have his fun with him, though Dean couldn’t shake the feeling that he was simultaneously judging and dissecting him.
He knew he sounded needy, his voice pleading and weak. He didn’t care though; he would bare his very soul to this man if only he let him. He was sure Cas wasn’t being honest right now. Especially since he wouldn’t look at him to repeat his words. So Dean pressed on. “Because right now? I think you’re lying to both of us.”
Teaching that day was hell. Dean chalked it up to the prospect of the Winter Fair starting tonight, or maybe just general Christmas atmosphere craziness, but his students were antsier than usual and hardly listened to a word he said. It could also have been his own mood that let to him not being as in control of his classrooms as usual. Whatever it was, it didn’t help Dean’s own jitters and he was happy when school was finally over. Deciding that in this state, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on any of his papers anyway, Dean quickly packed up and was able to intercept Gracie before she would get to Luke’s to sit down and wait for him in the diner. It was a good thing after all, leaving them enough time for a relaxed late lunch with the family and not having to rush to get Grace to the last ballet rehearsal before the big show tonight. The thought of his little baby girl being able to dance again ... Dean wasn't going to lie, it made him tear up and lightened his heart at the same time. After the terrible accident this summer, after seeing his baby so broken, after almost losing her –
Because… those past few weeks… the way he was sure Cas had warmed up towards him… the way he smiled at him and laughed with him… the way he acted and the way they talked with each other… that almost kiss…
“No,” Cas growled behind him. Dean’s cock jumped at the low sound, and he remembered then that Cas was a fucking angel. Probably the most dangerous creature on earth. Dean laughed, and Cas kissed his neck. A third finger. Dean bucked his hips. “You’re not ready,” Cas added, more gently.
“You do?” Dean found himself suddenly confronted with a pair of bright blue eyes and a slight smile.
“Fuck,” Dean whined at the loss of Cas’ fingers. He felt so damn empty. God, he could barely stand not being able to see Cas. He couldn’t feel him, either. Dean could have been alone on the bed, sweating and hard. As he heard the lube bottle open again, though, he knew he just had to wait. He pictured Cas sliding a slick hand over his penis, eyelids fluttering shut at the sensation.
"Although lights do sound nice," Cas said wistfully, and he waved his hand. Suddenly, every other branch or so lit up like it itself was a string of Christmas lights. Dean's eyes went wide, and the room got bright.
Cas moaned against Dean's lips, eyes wide. Dean leaned in, and captured one of Cas' nipples between his teeth. Cas threw his head back as Dean sucked on it, swirling his tongue around the pebbled flesh in lazy strokes. And then Cas was coming, shooting cum over Dean's hand and on his own thigh. Dean watched him in a rapture, the way Cas' eyes squeezed shut before coming wide, wide open and the breathless moans that escape his lips, those beautiful lips that hang open, begging to be claimed. That's exactly what Dean did, but after a moment of kissing, Cas struggling to reciprocate through his post-orgasmic daze, Cas slid off Dean's lap and came to kneel between his legs. Dean groaned in protest at the sudden lack of friction on his dick, before Cas yanks his jeans open. Dean briefly wondered why he bothered to get dressed at all in the first place, and then Cas is sinking down on him, swallowing his cock up into slick heat. Dean moans loudly, hips rocking. "Shit," he whispered. He was already close and Cas knew it. Cas' nose bumped into Dean's stomach, and he looked straight up into Dean's eyes, a goddamn invitation to come down his throat.
”  Cas gasped. Dean looked up at him through his eyelashes, and saw that Cas’ hands were shaking on the gun, his jaw finally slack.
Cas nodded and joined Dean on the adjacent chair, looking alarmed by its lack of solid substance. They were silent for a moment, Dean noticing the thin sheen of sweat on Cas’ forehead. He was doing that more and more now, Dean noticed.
But Dean’s voice, treacherous, can’t rise to that challenge. Can’t say he meant ‘I need you always and forever’ not ‘I need you to check in on weekends and to kill demons for me.’
So, he makes the gardens grow. He adds the bees. The birds, too. He lets the souls of long-lost friends reunite in brand-new forests they remember from Earth. He and Jack work side by side. Sometimes, he visits Earth. He doesn’t go to Dean. He goes to new places, and watches like he did when he was stationed there. He watches the people and feels the wind on his skin. He comes to love the ocean.
Dean wasn’t sure what sparked the Tom Petty reference, but it seemed to strike a chord with Cas. “Look, man. I can’t claim to know much about… well, anything to do with feelings. But if you like, I can teach you what I know about being human.” Cas’ chin lifted slightly. “I’m not good at it, by any stretch. But maybe it’ll help you figure out… stuff.” He trailed off lamely.
Dean blinked. He didn’t need telling twice. He repositioned his arms and scooped Cas into them, picking him up as he stood with shaky legs. Cas laughed in surprise before wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck for support. Dean carried him to the back wall, Cas looking up in something which could only be described as adoration all the while. He propped Cas against it as gently as he could, holding him up at the waist while Cas wrapped his leg’s around Dean’s hips. He was still loose and open from earlier, so Dean merely kissed him, hard and sweet, and thrust inside him. He closed his eyes against the tight wetness, and Cas groaned as he bottomed out.
His face twisted when I gasped, and he pinned me down and stopped me from touching him, like he couldn't bear any expression of tenderness from me. This, I thought, was within his rights. He fucked against me, thrusting his hard cock against mine. I closed my eyes against the pleasure, but also because I didn't want to see him like this. He was trying so hard not to let any of the feelings seep through. I had wanted this
A few hours later, Dean has vanished from his room. Sam finds him in the back seat of the Impala, staring at the ceiling and tracing the leather of the seat. Sam ignores the weird position and breaks out with, “I think we can get him back.”
“No. It’s just molecules. It makes the effect rather surprising,” Cas said, attempting a wink but failing sloppily.
With that one word, I pulled him down off the hood of the car and down into the grass where I knelt. I laid him on the ground and dragged his boxers off, licking my lips as his red, throbbing cock was revealed. It curved gracefully up to his stomach. I ignored it for the moment and spread his legs wider. He submitted to me, but all the while ran his hands along my skin, into my hair, on the curves of my shoulder muscles. I had some knowledge of what I was meant to do, but beyond that, my actions were inspired solely by his silent encouragements to me, the way his hips shuddered or a flash in his eyes.
"I wish there were lights," Dean muttered, coming to stand behind Cas, circling his arms possessively around the angel.
He ran a thumb over the red marks on his chest and thighs, trying not to cry. He’d lost track of all the things he shouldn’t have done. It was maybe an hour later when Cas reappeared, clothed in black jeans and a rumpled blue, seventies style shirt. Dean glared at his back. He was fussing with the cassette desk, of all things. Not a hello. Just straight in, pushing buttons and whatnot. Dean got up, glad he’d at least put on boxers and jeans.
“Shut up, Dean.” It wasn’t until Cas was gone and Dean had collapsed backwards onto the bed, shoes still firmly laced, that he realized the angel had pressed a quick kiss into his hair before disappearing.
“Seriously?” He said, digging through an old cardboard box, falling apart at the corners and chock full of cassettes. “I threw these out years ago!”
Cas frowned. “Daisies are actually remarkably resilient. I suppose in terms of our respective lifetimes, you could be a perennial flower and I could be an oak tree… All living things, in fact, seem to be a remarkable mix of breakable and resilient… you and the daisy are no exception.”
“You know,” Dean said offhandedly, “What you said earlier doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.” Cas’ eyes were closed, his head tilted back, and he carried on. “What you said on the roof.”
He pushed in gently, letting out a long, utterly deserved moan as the tight, wet heat surrounded him. For a moment, he could barely think. He didn’t stop until he was balls deep in Cas, and then it was only for a second, just to savor the feeling. He could feel Cas’ heaving breaths against his chest, the ache where Cas’ nails had dug into the handprint, and the hot, heavy feeling of everything that was
Neither of us could wait any longer. When he was barely open enough, I coated my cock in the oil. He watched me, eyes blazing. I hoisted him up, my arms trembling with the effort, and he let out a surprised grunt. He wrapped his legs around my waist and then I thrust inside him.
He closed his eyes, and I knew that he would hold me a little longer, but that he would be gone before midnight. That was all right. I would lay here all night, before following that single bee to its home. I wanted to see the sunrise, to see if tomorrow, the sky would be blue.
