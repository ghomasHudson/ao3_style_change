- We will be there, he answered and then followed Sherlock out of the room. He was standing outside the bank, back leaning against the large windows typing away on his phone.
John was still moving his hands up and down Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock hoped he would never stop. Maybe it was the time appart but he was more aware of John’s physical presence now. Or maybe he had just forgotten how affected he got by John. It felt like his fingers were firing a smal electrical current. Still a bit dazed, he met John’s eyes. They were dark and serious. Sherlock grabbed hold of John’s sweater before he had a chance to back away. Then, without a proper thought, just acting on a hunch. He leaned in and kissed John. He had always trusted his hunched, they were just answers to facts he hadn’t processed yet. This one surprised him though, he hadn’t really enjoyed the first kiss. But this one was different, not as rough. John stood frozen, his hands had stopped their wandering. Sherlock hoped that he would snap out of it and take charge of the kiss. He knew kissing could involve more than this simple pressing of lips together, but he had no idea how to get from point A to point B. Then John seemed to wake up and he tilted his head a bit and then they fitted together much more nicely. Sherlock placed his hand at the nape of John’s neck to prevent him from pulling back too soon. This had just gotten interesting, he didn’t want it to end just yet. This was far nicer than it had been before and he thought that his suspicions about John’s abilities had been right. John was touching his face and weaving his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. It gave him goosebumps.  When Sherlock felt John’s toung against his own he made a sound that should have been embarrassing if John hadn’t made a similar sound. Sherlock put one arm around John’s waist and pulled him closer. They both gasped and broke off the kiss when they felt the telltale sign of the other one's arousal. They looked at each other for a moment before they closed the gap between them and kissed again. Sherlock’s head was spinning, he wondered why they had never done this before, and if they would ever do it again. Could he ever live without this now that he knew how addictive it was. He tried to touch every ince of John he could reach. Only above the belt, he didn’t dare to do more than that. John had one arm cupped around Sherlock’s cheek. The other one slid down Sherlock’s back to press him against John. Sherlock couldn’t help a wince as pain shot through his back. He took a step back and John ended the kiss.
You are the most stubborn person I’ve ever met. Why won’t you listen? Sherlock’s voice rose at the end of the sentence. He walked two steps towards John before he stopped himself.
"I think you should leave" John said through gritted teeth. He felt an urge to punch this man in the face but he thought that he might be out of a job if he did.
I thought I made it clear to you that I’m not ready for any kind of intercourse so we can’t seal the deal so to speak. John blushed up to his hair.
- So if not stolen and sold, could your father have given it to someone? Or stored it somewhere else? Mr Jackson stiffened in his chair but it was Mrs Gordon who answered.
"Mycroft Holmes, I believe you have made the acquaintance of my brother?" John took a step back. Had Sherlock sent his brother to speak on his behalf, what grown up did that?
That pretty much sums it up yes. There was so much John wanted to ask about, but he didn’t know where to start, or what kind of answers he wanted.
“Sometimes you can be so stupid, and so blind” John said. Sherlock didn’t understand what he was saying. He was thinking of a reply, assuming John meant that their friendship was ruined now. But then John leaned into him and Sherlock's mind went completely blank. He stopped breathing as John came closer, he had risen from his seat and was now hovering over Sherlock, mere inches from Sherlock. John stopped when he was so near that Sherlock could feel his breath on his face.
“It was true what I said, when I said it. It turned out after a while that I had been wrong.” Sherlock went quiet, trying to find the right words for his feelings towards Irene.
“It has been hell. And I can’t… I can’t just forget and jump into whatever this is now. I need time”
Actually you’re an army doctor. John stod silent, not following Sherlock’s line of thought. This wasn’t news to Sherlock.
I just ran into your special student in the hallway, she said giving John a long look. John tried to keep a straight face but he felt sometime like dread at the thought of what Sherlock had said to her.
John realised that that fumbling flirting he had experienced yesterday was just for show. This was the real thing and it was, frighteningly enough, hard to withstand.  But Sherlock’s smile didn’t last and John found himself disappointed.
John woke by the sounds of the violin. Sherlock was playing one of his own pieces. It was a bit dark for John’s taste, not on of his favourites. But Sherlock preferred dark and dramatic when he was thinking. He only stopped playing when John put a cup of tea in front of him.
What is it Lestrade, I’m busy. Sherlock started pacing as he listened. John thought that Lestrade was the name of the police officer Sherlock worked with. He couldn’t guess what the conversation was about, Sherlock didn’t say anything.
- They are used as payment for post. They usually have the queen on them. Some people collect them. And I think I have some in my wallet if you need some? John could hear Sherlock’s sigh and knew he was rolling his eyes.
“I…” He started and then fell silent again. He had no idea how he would explain what he felt and had thought about his feelings.
- Yes, I’ve had sex, with men and women. But only while I was using. And before you go all doctor on me, I’ve taken the entire test since I got clean. John kept silence. He didn’t know what he had expected, but he was surprised. Luckily they arrived at the restaurant a moment later. When they were seated Sherlock started to deduce the other guests and the conversation was effortless after that. John was reminded of how nice it was to spent time with Sherlock when there wasn’t a case to distract them. He was surprised to find that they soon were the only two guests left, time flew. He took the bill and Sherlock didn’t argue. He had probably read up on etiquette on a first date. They decided to walk home as well. John felt it was a chance to clean his head. He had a lovely evening and he didn’t want it to be over just yet.
What did you expect? He asked, shortly. Sherlock’s eyes locked in his. He seemed to be searching after something.
“But I love you in a want to kiss you all the time, sleep in the same bed, and do a whole lot of other fun things in that bed- kind of way.” Sherlock blushed. He knew what John was getting at and knew why he didn’t think Sherlock felt the same.
“Could you… “He trailed off, his eyes drifting close again. He cursed under his breath as Sherlock tried to suck at one of his fingers.
- I know what you said. But actions speak louder than words and you don’t seem that interested in taking things further. Sherlock straightened up a bit and when he spoke he sounded angry.
Mr Gordon opened the door when they rang. He lead them through a hallway into the livingroom. Mrs Gordon was already there. It surprised John. They hadn’t called ahead, and still it seemed like they were expected. John greeted Mrs Bryce and sat down in a sofa opposite the armchair she was seated in. Sherlock strode over to the mantelpiece. There were a few pictures standing there and Sherlock seemed to take a closer look.
Do you want to know how? John wasn’t really interested in crime solving. But if it would get Sherlock to speak he was up for anything. And to listen to Sherlocks deduction was nice, to get a glimpse inside that man's head. He leaned back and nodded to Sherlock who started talking in a fast pace. John wondered if he ever stopped for breath. Sherlock talked on his own for over five minutes. John got pulled into the story. When Sherlock had finished John was sitting with his arms on his knees, leaning towards Sherlock.
I want to know what you want to do about us. You told me you were in love with me and you show up here almost every day but we haven’t spoken about it. Sherlock turned around and leaned against the bookcase. He looked like he wanted to be anywhere but where he was.
You do? Sherlock looked at him with surprise in his eyes. It looked genuine but John had learned his lessons, he didn’t trust those eyes.
- No, are you? he could hear a chuckle from the door, then Sherlock slipped in and closed the door behind him, the room went pitch black. John could hear Sherlock moving cautiously towards the bed. He moved as Sherlock found the bed and climbed into it. Sherlock moved up so he could lean his back against the headboard.
- Out with it. Sherlock startled him so he almost dropped the milk. Some splashed on the countertop.
“Surprisingly nice” Sherlock said honestly without thinking. Most of his bloodflow had traveled south leaving him a bit lightheaded. He had thought he was kissing John just for his sake. Now he wanted to continue for a lot of selfish reasons. John started laughing, bending forward and put his hands on his knees. He seemed to be having a hard time stopping laughing. It felt to Sherlock like it took a long time for him to silence and straighten up. Then he saw Sherlock’s confused look and started giggling again. Then, at last he pulled himself together.
- First the sister. She is heavily in debt and need the money. When she is sober she seems bright enough to pull this off. She didn’t know her father was going to die so soon and she felt she couldn’t wait for the inheritance.
Iraq or Afghanistan? Sherlock said once more. It was what John had thought he heard but he didn’t understand what it meant.
"There has been a theft in the morgue, someone stole some livers." John looked in silence on Mr Andersson, not understanding why he spoke to John about it.
John stood looking out on the student's filtering into the classroom. It was the usual assortment of people. Most of them young, mostly dressed in jeans and t-shirts carrying their computer bags over their shoulders. There was only one man standing out. First of all he was at least five- ten years older than most of the students, closer to John in age. Second he was dressed in dress trousers and a shirt that looked tailor made. Not that John had much experience in tailor made clothes. But he didn’t think clothes bought of the rack would fit that good. He looked a bit out of place in this environment and John found himself wondering why this man took this class. The man strode to one of the front rows and took the seat closest to the isle. Far away from any other student. He put his backpack down on the floor, a ragged thing that didn’t fit with his overall look. The man sat down, put both of his feet on the seat aswell, it looked terrible uncomfortable for a man his size. But he sat this way the whole lecture. It was the second time John held this course and he felt he did a good job. It wasn’t his first choice of job. But when he came home from the war in Afghanistan with a gunshot wound to his shoulder and ptsd, there wasn’t much else to do with his medical training. He was a trauma doctor but couldn’t stand the pressure in an emergency-room. He could get a panic attack trying to ride the subway in rush hour. When faced with the choice of teaching or taking a job at a health center, he had found the idea of teaching a bit less boring than treating people with the snivels. To his surprise he had found out that he rather enjoyed it. He had gotten some friends at the university as well. He didn’t see himself doing this for the rest of his life. But as long as he woke almost every night with nightmares and had to avoid crowded places he thought this was the right place for him. His first lecture for the semester was really basic. Since the man in shirt was sitting up in front, John had him in his line of vision. He sat motionless, not taking any notes or didn’t seem to move at all in the one and a half hour John spoke. It made John feel nervous, he felt more watched than he normally felt during a lecture. Some students stayed after the lecture to ask questions about the coursework but not this man. He strode out of the room as soon as the lecture ended, not looking at anyone. It continued the same way for a couple of weeks. The man would sit in the front, curled up in his chair, and walk out as fast as John stopped talking. He never took any notes, but he got the highest grade on the assignments. John was intrigued. He tried to tell himself it was more than the man’s looks. He was gorgeous even though he was too thin but there was more than that. He had those eyes that seemed to pierce through John and pull the information out of him. Sometimes he got the feeling that the man, Sherlock Holmes was his name, didn’t listen to a word he said. Instead he just sat and observed.
I don’t know, he said finally and then turned around and walked out of the room. John sat down, weak in the knees.
Sometimes, well most of the time, the police finds it hard to solve even the easiest crimes and then they need help. I help them.
Can I come in? The question was uncharacteristic, the only thing that gave John a hint that Sherlock was nervous. He looked calm, met John’s gaze without any hesitation. It was like nothing had happened between them.
“You should have told me” John repeated. Now, Sherlock was feeling annoyed. It was a nice feeling compared to being scared.
- Isn’t obvious? He continued walking. John tried not to get angry, but sometimes Sherlock made it so difficult.
Sherlock looked at the brown door in front of him. If John didn’t open, it would take him approximately three minutes to get in. It was a cheap sort, fit only to keep flies out. Sherlock would have thought that a landlord in a neighbourhood like this, where the crimerates were high would invest in better doors. He wondered how John could sleep here. He shook his head. Scolding himself for thinking about nonsens instead of just knocking. He was stalling, that was it. He had thought of this moment for two years. Every second since he jumped from the roof of S.t Barts, his goal had been to get back to John. In his fantasy John had stayed in Baker street and not moved to this depressing housing complex. Sherlock hoped that other parts of his fantasy would prove more true. He was suddenly afraid. Angry with himself for the weakness, he raised his hand and knocked. He could hear footsteps inside and the shuffle of two safety chains. He smiled, thinking that some things hadn’t changed. Then John opened and Sherlock could see that other things had. John had lost weight. He had never been fat. But he was well built. His training habits from the army had stuck. And with a diet of beans on toast and takeaway ment that he was never thin. Even when Sherlock met him and had seen how little he had eaten since leaving the army, that weightloss had still been hidden beneath the muscles. He had looked fit then. Now he looked ill. The skin was starting to sag in his face, he had dark circles under his eyes. He had new wrinkles. Not the nice kind that came from laughing and smiling. These were from frowning. Sadness etched into his face permanently. It took John a moment to realise who was standing in the doorway. When he did, he took a step back.Sherlock took one forward and closed the door behind him. Saving himself from the risk of getting the door slammed in his face.  John stood still a few feet from him. Sherlock had thought he would look happy, at least a bit. He could understand that this came as a chock, but still.
"You can borrow this. I’ll be here two more hours but then I need it back." The student took it, flashing a fast smile that to John seemed a bit out of character. Then he stood up.
You were attacked, that could never be your fault, he said. He didn’t dare to move any closer to Sherlock. Even though shame was the most prominent feeling in him, he could still feel the urge to hug Sherlock, kiss him. He walked behind his desk instead, increasing the distance between them. Sherlock rose from his seat, walking towards John.
“You told me that you were married to your work, that you don’t have time for romance. And you haven’t shown any interest in anyone. You didn’t even seem that interested in Irene in that way.”
- Of course I did. I don’t have your experience. John opened his mouth to disagree but closed it again. He was experienced compared to Sherlock.
That was the police officer I told you about, he need help with another case. Sherlock seemed torn. John could easily see that he was eager to go, to work. But the fact that Sherlock hadn’t just kick John out and left told him that Sherlock also wanted to stay.
“You don’t know everything about me and my feelings, John” Sherlock knew he was being careless. He should stay quiet. Let John have his tantrum and then they would move on. End up in their usual habits. But he just couldn’t take it anymore, something had to give.
- Sherlock, he said, pulling his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock sat back on his heels, giving John the first chance to see him since they started kissing. He took John's breath away. Sherlock’s hair was in disarray, his cheeks were red and his lips were swollen. He was breathing hard, John could see his chest rising and falling with every breath and if he let his gaze fall he could see Sherlock’s erection straining in his trousers.
If Mr Holmes had a crush on him, then John had to stop his eying on him at once. He wasn’t going to give the poor man hope.
When John came to work the following day he was greeted by his boss. He didn’t look too happy and John tried to remember everything he had done the last week, trying to figure out what he had done wrong. His boss only spoke to him when something was wrong.
- Saturday is fine. Sherlock gave John a hint of a smile before he disappeared into his room and closed the door. They went on three more dates, all initiated by John. Sherlock accepted the invitation, seemed to have a good time and kissed John at the end of the evening. But he didn’t try to take things further, didn’t even try to kiss John with an open mouth. And he always trembled when John was near. It made John uncertain. He was falling for Sherlock, he could not deny it. But Sherlock almost looked like he was falling out of love with John. It made him second guesses everything. After the fourth date he didn’t ask if they were going on another one and Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. Until the next morning when John was sitting in the kitchen reading the morning paper. Sherlock came in and stood by the counter.
- I’m close; he tried to warn Sherlock and got some murmurs as a response. But Sherlock didn’t stop or slow down. Just a few moments later John came in Sherlock’s mouth. John shouted, gripping the chair tighter so he didn’t fall off as the world spun around him. Like he was far away could he feel Sherlock releasing him, putting his head against John’s knee. Then John could hear a zipper being pulled down and soon he could hear Sherlock groan. All was still and quiet for a few moments. Then John opened his mouth.,
- Where are we going? John asked while looking out through the window. Sherlock was typing on his phone, but glanced up on John. He didn’t answer. Instead he pocketed his phone and looked at John with an urging look.
“Why…?” He croaxed, still struggling to clear his mind. John had tried to end his life. Sherlock could have done everything he had done the last two years and John could have been dead when he came back. He could have lived in a world without John.
- So I need you know John. Did you get angry because I tried to kiss you or because I said it was a game? Were you disappointed? Sherlock stepped a bit closer, his gaze burned into John. He could feel heat rising on his cheeks.
“That was the point.” Tears were rising in Sherlock’s eyes. He hadn’t cried in front of someone in over two decades and wasn’t going to start in front of this John-copy. He turned around and walked back into the hallway, trying to get his breath back. He felt bile rising in the back of his throat.
I need to ask you something, John said to Sherlock’s back. Sherlock didn’t turn around or speak but he had stopped picking out books so John guessed he was listening.
“There are so many things I want to do to you. I want to kiss you, undress you. I want to fuck you and be fucked by you. I can’t tell how many times I imagined you and me together on every possible surface in baker street.” His voice was low and his breath was hot in Sherlock’s ear. His words sent Sherlock’s imagination into overdrive and he had to stop himself from moaning, or just pull John closer and force him to do at least one of those things. He turned his head towards John and John placed a kiss on Sherlock’s lip. A very chaste kiss considering what he had just said.
“You bastard, you fucking twat. You and your fucking cleaver plans. I watched you jump, I watched you die!” For every word in the last sentence he pushed Sherlock harder against the wall. Sherlock didn’t do anything. He had learned long ago that John often showed one emotion with his body and another one with his eyes. His body was all about rage, he was well in Sherlock’s personal space, he didn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes so he couldn’t deduce his true emotions. And still strong despite his weight loss. Sherlock felt something trickle down his back and wondered if one of his wounds had started to bleed. It could just be sweat, the apartment was stuffy. Then John stopped pushing him and just stood there panting. Sherlock tried to meet his gaze but John had his eyes fixed on his hand that was nog splayed over Sherlock’s heart. His heart was beating rather calmly despite the situation. He was confident that John wouldn’t hurt him for real.
Sherlock doesn't even turn around, he just disappears between the dancers in a morbid silence where all the unsaid things and the questions between them seem to be so heavy that it's John's respiration, short and oppressive, which suffers the consequences.
"Well, here is our quite small, and strangely walking suspect," he comments in a powerful voice, quoting the words used by Craig Jennings in the parking lot.
"... I was thus saying, before John interrupted me, I use it for my work experiments. It has already helped me for quite a lot of cases."
"John Watson," the detective murmurs in a sigh, words going out of his mouth as if he's tasting the most delicious sweetness.
He and Sherlock had to wait three days so that Lestrade, with the help of the Royal Festival Hall, could organise this reconstruction in which all the members of the orchestra who were present the evening of the murder are participating, as well as the seven suspects who have taken their seats once again. There are also around thirty policemen, counting the ballistics team and the ones that are guarding the exits, in case there's an escape attempt. It's pretty rare but, according to Gregory, a culprit has already tried to escape after barely entering the crime scene.
"It was only the two of you?" asks John whose eyes remain, in spite of him, more attached to Doris than to her son.
John and Gregory raise their eyes so high in their orbits, Sherlock can only hope their eyeballs will make a complete turn on themselves and finally find the brains they've been ignoring for so long. The brunet doesn't wait a minute more and, with a gesture ridiculously way too sophisticated, he jumps off the stage and walks to the exit. John shakes the DI's hand, greets the rest of the agents and quickly catches up to his flatmate.
"Months, it's been months that you're chasing after a murderer who was in the same room as you! What's going on with you, Sherlock, why can't you solve the case?" he roars, shaking the detective of whom he crushes the throat a bit more without hearing the doctor.
ones, because I don't want to use those kind of commercial artifices. And when I will finally touch you, John,
"You could have died. For fuck's sake, you and Sherlock could have died! Did that cross your mind at one point or, like the two jerks that you are, you really thought you could handle it yourself?" his voice is so strong it hits the walls. He puts his fist against his hips and everything in his attitude reminds John of the DI they didn't remember to call before they went to face Moriarty.
Sherlock enters the debate and his host begins to laugh at the youngest's eating habits - which seems perfectly fine with him going by his amused smile. He is seated at the end of the table, legs crossed in a sophisticated gesture, fingers banging a soft rhythm on the sewn tablecloth.
For the family of the sick person, we dim the voices, we speak slowly, we hide the inhuman muck-up which takes place behind the scenes; between the rooms of the nurses in depression and the operations rooms where we open, dissect and close someone like a piece of meat. So, when John Watson crosses the door of the London Bridge Hospital as a visitor, all which is murmured roars in his ears, and these things that we cannot see jump to his face.
"Is it really important?" asks Sherlock once on the pavement, already catching the file held by his friend to inspect the address of the first suspect.
"Nothing... Well, me. My reflection. A bit twisted, but it's my reflection. But why would Sherrer have been looking at himself?"
"I can go make us some tea if you want," Sherlock proposes with a smooth voice, sliding his hand on the doctor's skin.
?” he asks enthusiastically, saying the last two words with a twangy voice that you only hear in cartoons.
John has never loved hospitals. It is stupid for a doctor, but that is the way it is. As with most children, he discovered for the first time the cold and sterile atmosphere of a hospital one Sunday, during a family visit to see his grandmother with a new hip - however in plastic. He remembers having been struck by the silence, only punctuated by the humming of the machines which held alive the entire geriatrics department. When he wanted to be a doctor - but his parents couldn't afford to pay for him to go to a renowned school - and he ended up doing a training course of military medicine, the silence was not really something that he met again.
The brown-haired man comes into the office and stands next to the windows. He crosses his hands behind his back and is looking at the Cox family with a superiority completely as equal as all the other times he questioned a suspect. John wants to roar, to ask for a little of condolence, but he knows that he doesn't have the necessary energy to explain to his flatmate what that is. It's with a light anxiety that John looks
The detective and Benjamin Cox, their bodies turned to the wall, are standing in front of the sofa which they have covered with papers and photos of all kinds, interconnected by red and blue wires. It seems there is a lack of space on the sofa, and the coffee table is covered under piles of clippings. And John could make an effort not to shout - really, he could - if the rest of the room was not a visual cacophony of falling cardboard, cut papers and clothes thrown like simple rags on the ground.
Sherlock very ironically smiles one second more before relaxing his face muscles. On the bench where he's seated, he crosses his legs and puts his elbows on the table before catching one of the two beers John brought back and inspecting it meticulously:
"Hey..." he smiles to them, crashing his thumb against the remote control to raise the backrest of his bed.
"Sh-Sherlock," John sighs, raising his head by reflex when he feels the hand of his flatmate settling on his cock.
He lowers his hand and raises his nose, and he looks around himself at the three buildings in ruins, where the broken windows let him perceive the walls which are filled with graffiti. Standing there in the middle of nothing, he as the putrid impression of a musician in the centre of a stage that is giving him nausea. A second, then two, pass before he finally understands and tries to take a steps backwards, but the pain is already there and burns his left shoulder. John turns his face and sees his jacket impregnate with his own blood, and dammit, no,
John says nothing, he just shakes his head once and leaves right away. There are many people in the immense open space so he leans against an empty desks and looks at the glazed office where he just guesses at the dancing silhouettes of his two friends, their shouts suffocated by the thickness of the glass. He concentrates all his senses to understand a word, a gesture, but nothing. It's a terrible feeling to be left behind. Put aside.
Sherlock is now on the stage. With his hands behind his back, he gets through to the musicians by looking at them one by one. He tries to recognise them, John knows this because he often goes to the extremity of the scene to see the whole picture from the same angle as when they were in their seats, 14 and 15W. More than the half of the musicians are in town suits because it's still the afternoon and their next representation will not begin until 8 pm. That doesn't seem to disturb Sherlock who continues his inspection for about seven minutes before raising his voice towards the back-scene:
–  is a person of interest, Sherrer’s suddenly the bastard who had us on a wild goose chase for months and Mycroft is trying to knock
It is stupid; they are only words and for a soldier who went to war, it is not a set of consonants and vowels which will put him on the ground like that, but that touches a point in his stomach so deep it seems miles and years away from what he really is; and yet, that calls into question
Not the expected answer. He opens his eyes a bit wider before blinking them quickly and straightens up in his seat. He doesn't think anymore about the porn video, their childish quarrel, and the violin. When he can trust Sherlock Holmes, nothing else really matters.
which made him understand, in a most crappy way, that all of this is bullshit. It made him understand that this control he's imposing on his life, with the same sourness of a rope you put on an unfortunate's neck, will never save him.
"Sherlock, wait, do you know her?" he asks, grabbing his flatmate's arm. He's squeezing a little bit harder than he wished. "How do you know that? How do you know that she's into that stuff? Sherlock do you...
, one of the most known suicides of the theatre. And this costume of Hamlet, the most iconic tragic character: even in his roles Sherrer was morbid."
is running through John's mind so much right now that he fears the moment it will eventually find a way out. But Sherlock just has to impose on him one last will before John forgets everything, without any concession:
"Sheri dragged me to this shitty concert, far from dad and mom, to tell me she had a boyfriend. I was very happy of course, until she told me that this pervert is more than 50 years old. He could be our father, it is yucky! What was I supposed to say? Of course we got into a fight, she's making a huge mistake!"
Sherlock takes close to a minute to retrieve his senses before slowly moving backward. John would like to touch himself and come, right now, but he knows Sherlock's the one in charge so he doesn't move and he waits for the instruction, the tie still in his hand. He carefully watches when the detective takes off the condom and he throws it away, and doesn't prevent himself from shivering when he feels a warm hand catching his shoulder before forcing him to sit down on his own bed.
"Harry would never bear being in a private hospital. You know her, if there are too many people, she becomes aggressive. And I could go to see her more easily in Southall."
"I am going to go make us this bloody tea, but when I come back, I am going to attach your wrists to the bars of the..." he stops, turns around to notice that there's no headboard or any bars, sighs, and starts again, irritated, "my bedroom is
"Don't blame him, it's me who insisted. I'm glad you're in a relationship, Greg. I don't mind that..."
"Sherlock is upstairs and John didn't return from the hospital yet. I'm a bit worried, he left quite early this morning..."
Oh my gosh, 101 kudos and over 2300 hits! You guys are the best! Thank you so much for your amazing support. Extra thanks for those who are commenting - you inspire me so much dear readers :)
Two nurses come to help John dress, even if he waves them away, and he gathers the rest of his stuff in a plastic bag.  He then joins Lestrade in the hallway and the both of them walk towards the car park without a word.
It's immediate, as when the detective shouts to join him when they dash in pursuit of a criminal. John automatically raises his head from the newspaper, where he has been reading the same sentence since the beginning.
“If you want to throw up, just warn me so I have time to park, alright?” worries Lestrade, sneaking side glances as the Astra Vauxhall starts to move.
"Benjamin has Down syndrome," explains the doctor to Mycroft but the gesture is in vain because the oldest Holmes has turned to his brother, of whom he drinks in the words.
"Well, hello big sister," he murmurs, grabbing a chair which he scrapes against the lino ground to take a place next to Harry.
"Pregnant? Ah, no, you are..." but he doesn't finish his sentence and raises his look towards Steele before turning on his heels and coming down again up to the scene. "Where is Anderson?" he asks once among the musicians and the forensic raises a hand, a conceited smile on his lips. "Perfect, please take your place right here," Sherlock pursues, pointing at Sherrer's last chair.
him. He lets his eyes run over the body hidden behind a heap of useless fabrics and seems to pierce through them because he takes an infinite time to delight in it.
People are coming out one after another and the detective makes sure he's as small as his 6 feet allow him. The woman that welcomes them, with excessive red hair and burgundy-colored nails, talks to John as if he's a member of her family. She seems grumpy about the fact that they didn't book a room, but leaning over her laptop, she changes her mind by offering them the last room. Double bed. The words make John roll his eyes. He clenches his fists, swings on his feelings, and discreetly sighs. He insists to have another bedroom, she insists he can’t because she doesn't have another one, he insists again by telling her two beds would really be more appropriate, she insists still by telling him about the trout fishing contest at Lomond Lake. Apparently they're lucky to even find a place to stay.
It feels like a blade being pulled out of his throat. John growls to breath. He spits, his body shivers. He opens his eyes, one after the other. He doesn't see anything nonetheless. It's because it's dark. It's also because his head is imploding.
The engineer nods once and bends slightly forward. He puts his hands on the table and mixes them with strength before beginning his story with a tremulous voice in spite of all the willingness he can put in.
"Good, you understand. Can I go now?" Steele grumbles, looking at the door as if he's looking at a lifeboat in the middle of a storm.
Sherlock turns his head to look at his flatmate, who remains motionless, lips half-opened for a few seconds to try to find an answer. It is obvious that they are going to speak about that evening, first because it's physically impossible to hold on any longer and also because the memory of their bodies so close to each other doesn't give them respite.
"There will be no chains, no dark and wet cellar. No latex, or woman in leather insulting you in German, either. You can remove these ineptitudes out of your head. It's not a question of suffering or shame."
"He was shot from a single bullet between the temporal and parietal zone. Killed instantly. The bullet didn't came out. Calibre... I don't know, we'll have to ask Molly."
He doesn't quite know who has been hit or where, but the dark blood in which he's walking makes him realise the worst already happened. Laid down on his back, arms in shape of a cross and his eyes closed, there's a forty years old man. The left side of his face covered in blood. The doctor comes to his knees and leans two fingers on the man's neck but it comes as no surprise, he doesn't feel any pulse. Slightly, he turns the head of the dead man and pinches his lips when he sees the gaping wound right behind his left ear.
With a slow gesture, because time doesn't really exist anymore, Sherlock raises a hand, stretches out his index finger. He slowly approaches the foreign body which forms under a jumper with big stitches as if attracted to it by gravity. Finally his hand touches its purpose, its ultimate target: the right collarbone of the soldier, where the skin is still marked by the bullet which tore him apart.
He raises his head, discovers a long shelf, and sighs mentally, realizing that it's ridiculously high. With his right hand, he grabs the cupboard door while he stretches his left to try to catch at least one jumper. Too high.
Under his knees the carpet, aged by years and steps, scratches his skin. Under his hands, it's the soft fabric of Sherlock's suit that caresses his palms. He puts his fingers on his flatmate at the same time that Sherlock takes back his influence on the fair head, and the left hand of the detective supports the nape of his neck while the right hand touches his chin, two fingers already in front of the closed lips.
He removes his second sleeve and drops his shirt. He doesn't have time to ask to his flatmate what he's supposed to do next, because Sherlock pushes back the seat from which he has gotten off and kneels down. He spreads the doctor's hands with his own and comes between his legs, his back straight, his face slightly raised to keep looking at him. This reversal of situation has something moving and the simple idea that from now on it is Sherlock's neck which will bend to see his flatmate makes John smile.
. It's in the shivers traveling the naked body, in the muffled groans, in the way the fingers are hanging on the detective's hips. John Watson
It takes a few seconds for the detective to understand he's being called to order, so he politely smiles to apologise and continues:
It's a question mark, an oasis made of troubled and dangerous water, a promise and a trap at the same time. It's a door through which the detective escaped without expressing anything but a smile. A door he hasn't completely closed and which John is scrutinising the small opening fiercely. He could open it, just a bit more, finally learn what Sherlock hides with all the turtlenecks he has crossed in his life. He could ask him.
"No, that's terribly boring," he curses as if he really had a word to say. That irritates John, whom eyes raise to heaven.
He has to leave it closed. With one jump he gets up and leaves the sheets still wearing his scent, which he doesn't recognise anymore, and opens the door - the only one he has the right to touch the handle of - before going down to the kitchen.
He sees Sherlock's shoulders lowering, as if he's down to his last ounce of strength and while John's ready to ask to him if everything is okay, he sees the detective putting first one foot on wooden floor, then the second. It takes no more than four steps before Sherlock is in front of him, and he puts his hands on his cheeks and his lips on his, before invading his mouth with a tongue which John thinks has never been more brilliant.
resonates far behind them. Seated as far back in the seat as possible like two punished child, they try to contain their laughter and pay attention back to the scene where the first violin, standing next to Denosa, excel in a solo which makes the doctor shiver. Does Sherlock shiver too? Or does he know the tune so well it doesn't touch him anymore? And is Sherlock going to cry, like in March? John is not sure if he would like it to be the case or not.
Slowly, with muzzy gestures, John curls up until his knees hit the ground. Sherlock slides the crop under the chin he caresses, and it's enough to make John raise his face to him. Because Sherlock may stand and be dressed as if he's going to a wedding at Buckingham Fucking Palace, his smile is so bright that John feels terribly fortunate. It lasts for a brief moment, but there's a sort of pride in being the one who manages to make Sherlock smile this way, and it makes his head spin.
Sherlock sketches a smile of which the echo ends up on John's lips. Sherlock takes his left hand off the thick blanket and puts it on the fair nape of the neck and John understands the silent order to get closer, until he sits on the detective's fine thighs. He pushes away the cover by moving, and if he doesn't prevent the formless complaint escaping from his closed mouth when he sees in the light of day Sherlock's absolutely perfect chest, he doesn't comment out loud on the fact that his friend kept on his boxers.
"You will never guess who I saw this afternoon!" declares the blond-haired man, already cleaning his cup to have something to do with his hands.
The engineer doesn't react and doesn't even seem to breathe, while he brings out of his inside pocket an ID card, far from those British ones John knows by heart, which he aims at the policeman.
Sherlock releases the microscope and moves back on his chair to watch the doctor gesturing in front of him, and he doesn't need more than ten seconds to understand:
"That's the most important thing. I gave you an order to which you answered without waiting. Of course, I doubt that everything will be as easy but it's a good beginning."
Of course he's not listening to the doctor, he's struggling on the sofa on which he eventually stretches out, John on his knees near him, hands mixed with his to try to unstick the fingers. If the blond haired-man doesn't manage to completely close the screen, at least, he prevents his flatmate from opening it enough to see the video. Good thing their shouts are muffling the groans of both actors.
“I don’t think he intended to kill you. Well, you said so yourself, you were shot in the shoulder, at the same place where…”
And Sherlock seems to believe it so much John's soul breaks into pieces. He turns around when he hears his name and sees the receptionist is giving him a notebook and a pen.
"Yes," he moans as he feels Sherlock's finger pressing between his legs until the first phalanx enters in him.
"Damn, Sherlock it's not funny! It's like the heart Lestrade drew on the plan, in place of seats 14 and 15W;
At least working here isn't too difficult to manage, which really is good news because John's spirit has absolutely no more capacity for concentration on this part of his life, lately. When he asks Mr. Carlisle to cough, for example, he thinks about Benjamin's jerky breath. When he verifies the eczema of Mrs. Lang's youngest daughter, it's Sheri and her shy reddened cheek that comes back to his mind. And when he sits down behind his office and he waits alone for his next patient, it's Sherlock of whom he thinks.
"Okay, I don't give a damn, clearly. Mycroft, given the fact you have your answer, would you have the kindness to leave my bedroom?"
John doesn't exactly see his lines but he recognises the black coat of the detective and doesn't refrain from smiling. The steps of the detective bang in rhythm against the wood. No one dares to speak now that he has arrived and this staging makes John want to laugh, which he only contains because Sherlock doesn't seem to have fun,
"We didn't even speak about Moriarty," answers the brunet, enunciating every word as if he already repeated them a thousand times.
John turns around to look at his flatmate, ready to ask him more about Steele's story, whom he apparently managed to release, but the detective has already raised a hand to explain, his voice a bit hoarse however:
"Yeah, well, this is typically the kind of thing I say when I come across someone I don't want to see again: we'll meet soon anyway!" John grants, folding his newspaper, before getting up in turn.
"Your jumpers are on the top shelf," he clarifies, raising his chin to indicate to the blond to do the same.
John leans in and lays his lips on Sherlock's. The caress is soft. Slow. Surreal, maybe. The fact remains that it really exists. The contact is strange; John doesn't know what to think about it. So he presses a little bit more to help himself understand. Their noses are pressed against each other, it's painful. None of them has the presence of mind to turn their faces. John doesn't think about it because he's not sure if he should stop everything right now. Does Sherlock not think about it either for the same reason? Or does Sherlock not think about it because he doesn't know?
Today John smiles a lot and Sherlock likes it. He is not afraid anymore of a golden chipset incorporated into a plastic piece. He doesn't even ask him to see his driving license. They don't speak, in fact, and that is somehow... relaxing. It's good for once, to have some rest, even if his eyes are open, and see and understand everything.
He takes a small iron ruler out from the inside pocket of his jacket and practically lies down on the ground to put his eyes at the same level as Sherrer's figurine. Benjamin's breath is heavy, and although that automatically makes the doctor's eyes raise, the young man doesn't seem in danger from that. He's fixing the false scene with a look of unfeigned admiration, and John can't blame him for that.
The bonnet closes and the face of a young man comes to light, around thirty years old, with short dark hair and two big eyes made of a hot brown which are looking alternately on both newcomers. The man wears very sober black pants and a shapeless white T-shirt, made dirty by the grease which has invaded up to his hands, which he wipes against a grey rag.
"You heard me very well, come on, third movement," Sherlock repeats by raising a hand, and this time it's too much.
The criminal offered him one last smile, full of honey and razor blades, and with a slow pace, worthy of the psychopath he was, he left the vast room, the suit covered by the reflection of the bluish water, dancing at the sound of a faint melody. It could have been beautiful, if everything wasn't this petrifying.
, thinks Sherlock. His whole body is trapped in this steel cage, two long legs pressed against the plastic pedals, hands tied to the cylindrical object in front of him, staring in turns at the road, the dashboard, and the rear-view mirror, and
They stand and face each other for the first time on this scene of the Royal Festival Hall, before understanding with the same voice:
"Not yet," mutters Mrs. Hudson, looking away. If it has the merit to make Molly laugh, that makes the doctor jump up.
station construction invading 221B while the two men finish their breakfast in front of the mail they're meticulously opening.
It's far past midnight and the idea that a neighbor is tinkering or moving furniture proves that good manners definitely left the British island. He takes three steps to get closer to the wall separating 221 and stops in front of the closet which he now knows intimately.
John flips over in the bed for the hundredth time. The bedroom is plunged into darkness; he forgets the green and red tartan plaid on the other side of the bed, the dotted beige wallpaper, and the dark mahogany headboard. He mainly forgets the teddy bear family that is now remaining far, far away from him. It's past midnight and Sherlock still hasn't come back. He didn't go far for sure, he saw him by the window; he was talking on the phone in the park and the car is still here. Maybe then he went to the lake to see the trout reckless enough to come close to the surface. It's not that John is worried, but he thinks about it, and when John thinks about it he doesn't sleep.
The hands finish their meticulous movements and release him. John doesn't know where they are right now, in the infinite space which his body isn't using, but it's not really possible to break contact with Sherlock's eyes.
“What are you hiding from me? It's been four days that we’ve been ignoring this, but please, talk to me!”
That makes the doctor laugh. He shakes his head slightly, before subsiding a little more in his armchair.
John automatically turns his head to Sherlock because Moriarty is only speaking to him, but he shakes his.
Sherlock hardly smiles before continuing on with his very accurate inspection. He has an incredible gaze, clearer than ever, and it's those eyes that John can't leave. The detective's hand gets up a bit higher, on the left side near the ribs he's guessing to roll under skin that is traveled by delicate shivers. This time he examines a finer scar and his eyebrows frown slightly:
"We're done," retorts Sherlock by coming to shake her hand and before she closes the front door behind them, he turns around to add, "I found that the cello player in the third row was particularly bad."
John puts down the horn with a medical precaution and gets up in his turn to look at their empty seats, a few meters from there.
With his free hand, he catches a box (a blue, simple one) but his look is already on the one to the right, orange and pink.
What did the police report say? Oh, right, Moriarty's nicknames. Johnny Boy for him and the Virgin for Sherlock. A man way too disturbed with an obsession for sex; what a pain. But John buries all those noxious details and pushes his lips a little bit more against the ones he refuses to think of as a virgin. It's his tongue that comes to knock over everything, escaping from his will. He wets the closed lips, caresses them lazily, ask them the permission to cross this carnal and emotional gate. The mouth doesn't answer and John sighs, his stomach crushed under a weight way too painful. His hand comes up to the cheek he caresses and as if he found the soundproof words, the lips open and ask for more.
"Sherlock," he calls, shyly raising a hand to try to have at least his visual attention, because it's likely that his voice will get lost in the melody which is invading the Royal Hall Festival with all its fanciful innocence.
John lightly shakes his head and smiles, and Sherlock can only do the same. There's something unique happening in the living room of 221B this morning and John knows why: for the first time, he feels that Sherlock and he are on the same wavelength. Together.
"Yes, we arrived a bit earlier, so that Benjamin could sit down without having to disturb the other spectators and we remained seated during the interlude. I have a vague memory of the people sitting next to us but I saw or heard nothing suspicious..."
At the corner of Blandford Street, there's a small café painted in a sapphire blue. On the front window, there's an A4 page, soberly framed, which the owner is cleaning with a small duster. Of course, the road hasn't been blocked, but with the three police cars parked on the pavement, the residents are slowing down, taking off one earpiece and trying to catch sight of the reason for the sudden police invasion. There are two officers in front of the black front door that John is crossing before following Sherlock up the building's stairway. They stop on the second floor where the right door is already opened.
He greets them, kisses Mrs. Hudson’s cheek and leaves. Sherlock stands up and theatrically turns around without even noticing it (that’s the worst part of it, he doesn’t even realise he does so) and walks to the bathroom, followed by John. Andy is telling Mrs. Hudson how the dirt caused by the renovation works at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich is daily damaging his asphodel shoots but John barely hears them as he’s entering the room and feels Sherlock catching him by his valid shoulders before putting him against a wall. He kisses him harshly and against his lips, John recognizes the taste of fear. They don’t even close the door and uses each other’s mouth to cover their moans. Sherlock is pressing his body with his own and it’s killing his shoulder - he couldn’t care less. With his valid hand, he holds the detective’s neck and firmly holds it to be sure Sherlock won’t leave.
The detective escapes through the door held open by his friend, whom he pushes by the shoulders to press him into the staircase and bring them to the farthest possible distance of the DI's shouts, who curses with insults so full of imagery that John's eyebrows jump with surprise.
John stops, hands squeezed around the letter while those of his flatmate close around his pectoral muscles and his teeth nibble the swollen skin. The doctor has the reflex to want to move his pelvis but the strength Sherlock's exercising above him is enough to make him understand that he's not supposed to make the slightest gesture.
because that was where he had intended to go, but he fainted before correcting himself. He was woken up in the night by a bloody pain in his neck and an imperious need to let out what upset his heart. His thumb had crushed the remote set on his bed, and when the nurse came, holding out a bowl, he finally understood as he threw up, that it wasn’t his heart which was upset, it was his stomach. That was how he knew he had had surgery – bloody anaesthetic. He would have wished to give his name, but once more, his eyes closed before his lips even opened.
because there was nothing to say anyway. This trip is useless. Really. It's a waste of time, a gigantic joke to which he agreed to take part for John, Lestrade, and those non-stop clients that were asking him to come. So they have to go to the Isle of Skye before Wednesday, no matter if there's no killer to chase.
They get dressed in the staircase and go out in the small yard behind Mrs. Hudson's kitchen. Lestrade offers a cigarette to his friend, who politely refuses with a shake of his head. Even if he doesn't smoke, the cold makes his mouth produce a thick smoke anyway.
"Never ever," responds Sherlock, whose voice is still half covered by the deafening music - his better ally tonight.
John doesn't move any more as the pressure on his neck gets painful. Sherlock's thrusts are quick and dry now and he's moaning in long complaints. He's holding the doctor's head in earnest and keeps both of his eyes open to look at him while he fucks his mouth with a possessiveness he can't hide. His thrusts are slowly getting out of control and his eyes start to close, and John tries to relax his throat as much as possible. Sherlock's sighs one last time, a dirty and yet wonderful praise, before the doctor feels on his tongue the heat of his come through the condom.
They're looking at each other and if John has a shy but false smile which he brings out without really knowing why, Sherlock seems perfectly concentrated, as if he has done this all his life. John doesn't really know if he should be reassured or not.
, he doesn't even have a fly. He slowly raises his head, very aware that Sherlock used this childish excuse so that he could open the computer as he pleased, and it's exactly what he did. He's looking without embarrassment, his mediocre understudy French-kissing the witness, and sighs, as if profoundly disappointed:
The door opens and Sherlock appears with his phone in his hand. He seems to hesitate to exit the room when he sees the doctor but his eyes are automatically attracted to his roommate's so he stays. He puts his phone back in the pocket of his pants (the same than yesterday, with grass and dirt on it).
John wants to hold on, so much, to not show his flatmate he's been so fucking close to climax ever since Sherlock put his fingers on him, and that it's tiring up his muscles, clenching his teeth and making him lose his mind. That doesn't escape from Sherlock, who tightens his hand around the fair hair to make him tilt his head backward.
Seated on the leather armchair in his office, he gets lost in the alternative reality of another encounter with Sherlock, in Bastion Camp in Iraq, one evening before his garrison would have been called to the South of the country. Because it's often that which urged him to break the basic heterosexual education which society imposed on him: the idea that everything can change, even life, which can stop in an instant.
John nods -uselessly- and finds his way to the kitchen where he discovers a clean table, however scattered with crumbs, and an empty sink. He doesn't comment out loud this remarkable change and walks to the kettle he fills to overflowing, smiling as he doesn't have to contort the object to avoid pans and other utensils usually filling the sink.
"Possibly," concludes Sherlock. He lacked concern for this insignificant data before starting again, back to his flatmate, his eyes sliding from the DI to the nurse on his knees next to them. "I think John should go to hospital to have some examinations."
“Are you kidding? Of course we had to. Thank you Andy,” she smiles to her boyfriend when he helps taking off her jacket.
On his right, seated on the ambulance's ledge, John was following with his blue gaze a pen a doctor was moving from right to left. Sherlock, as for him, accepted the blanket on his shoulders at least.
"It is not Harry who put you in this state... She is incapable of understanding you," Sherlock deduces, his nose lost in the fair hair behind the ear of his flatmate, which he inhales (John knows it, because he feels the rib cage swelling against his back). "What happened at the hospital that made you..."
"No, don't. I have to go to see her... You... Well... I have to go," he ends with a firm voice, hand already raised to stop a taxi.
He seals his eyes to the doctor's and John doesn't answer using words. He unbuttons his jeans, still seated, and contorts himself with difficulty to slide them off his legs. He takes advantage to remove his socks at the same time (no way he's keeping them, let's stay pragmatic, for Christ's sake). Dressed in nothing but goosebumps, he's now covered by Sherlock's gaze and by his grey boxers. The detective doesn't even blink and doesn't look down.
. His hands were joined in a silent prayer, his feet exceeding over the armrest, and even if this evening was going as usual, John could have sworn he saw a tear running down the youngest man's cheek. By far, and by his eyes bitten by his age he's trying to forget, the doctor wasn't sure he didn't have a hallucination. He stayed for a while in his armchair without moving, simply admiring the scene that never really left him. He thinks about it often, and the idea that Sherlock really could have cried just by listening to music pulls his lips in a grimace he's not really sure he has to call a smile.
say you could! Fuck, Sherlock, a neighbor saw you forcing the lock and called us, if I had not intercepted the call you would have been arrested as the two morons that you are and I can't have your back any more, you know that! It's over Sherlock, the case took too long, I'm not working on it anymore and you know what it means: you're not on it either! For Christ's sake and say that I risk my job for you!"
"Oh, nope. I just turned my head quickly, you know. I didn't know someone got shot. I had no idea they could be guilty."
"And what did you do during the interlude?" he asks, and if that makes Steele's eyes lower at least that makes those of Sherlock turn to him.
Both men stay silent in front of their breakfast, giving each other the butter when one of them silently stretches out his fingers, until they finish and the blond haired man hints at the idea of having to go shopping, which Sherlock seems to ignore because he says, in a voice still a little bit hoarse from too much sleep:
"Obviously you didn't, because the murderer is still out there and because you were placed a few meters away from him. Unless it was you?"
Benjamin swallows a big breath of air and puts his right hand on his mother's forearm, who gets up automatically. She jumps when she notices his horribly white face, murmurs to him
? It's the scene, it's the..." he puts his fork down and turns his face to his flatmate's, aghast. "You've never seen
John jumps up, by-passes his armchair, Sherlock drops his coat on the ground, the doctor crosses over the top of the coffee table but the detective has already thrown himself on the sofa to catch the computer. The oldest is not passive, he tries by all means to close the screen but the fingers of the brown-haired man are preventing him from it.
The sound comes from a radio and the static make them wince. They look at each other and move, slowly. If the human body did things better, their heart would tell their brain it's time to move back, but they're entering a gigantic hallway with a wooden floor so well waxed that the lights reflect on it as if they are walking in a fire.
The detective by-passes the chair where his brother is still sitting and goes downstairs at a crazy speed, into his bedroom where he slams the door with a resounding noise. John shakes his head slightly, still not very aware of what just happened, and turns his head to discover that Mycroft's still smiling at him - and it's incredible that a human being can be this creepy by simply showing his teeth. Maybe the pact with Satan is a true story after all.
John and Sherlock steps back by reflex, as their body were almost touching and John smiles as much as he can before he answers:
He remembers that one evening when he had returned with Sarah to Baker Street, when his hands started to venture for the first time under her blouse. He hadn't bought new condoms yet and, while the idea that his date could stay overnight was getting more and more tangible, he had imagined himself going to tap at his flatmate's door to ask him to give him one. But the evening had finished earlier than expected because Sarah was working early the next morning and John was finally not more in the mood than that. Maybe she would have stayed if he had at least tried to hold her.
"Sherrer was seated here," indicates one of the policemen, pointing a finger to an empty chair with only a small yellow sign with a
However, facing the huge glass door spinning around, John forgets all of those anxiety dust and comes back to the very concrete reality of the Armani costumes and Ted Baker dresses surrounding him, like caviar surrounds the fly. It's a bit embarrassing, so he closes up his leather path cord vest and lowers his chin in response to all the other raised around him. He has never been in a concert hall this classy, and it smells pound up to the
John shakes his head in spite of him, his teeth molding his lower lip and no, they're not going to fuck here, not in the bedroom of a dead man of whom they have been investigating (and failing, also) the murder of, for months; not among the pictures of a life which stopped in front of hundreds of witnesses, not in the middle of stupid letters and ridiculous costumes, John is sure, absolutely sure,
"Madam Sanchez, you're married to a musician of the orchestra, right?" intervenes John, too comfortably seated in the warmth to be kicked out of the house because of his flatmate's indelicacy.
"About Elisa? Because it's a problem that I know her? Sherlock, what's going on between her and Greg?"
"Thus, he falsified his visa," concludes the detective, apparently highly irritated to not have understood it before.
Funny how you think you can trust technology and then one day you wake up and look at the finished chapter on the application Notes of your iPhone and -
He catches his coat which he puts on without waiting and greets his flatmate before disappearing behind the front door. John sighs noisily and tidies up the room without really believing that it would change something, before grabbing his blanket which he takes back to his bedroom.
"You saw a kid with bronchitis, a case of gastroenteritis, three cases of eczema and a teenage girl who came for you to sign a dispensation for a sport class; how is that saving lives?"
Both flatmates turn their heads at the same moment and look at each other without a sound. Yesterday evening was rather unpredictable.
"No, no, it's you I need this time. I don't trust Sherlock on this one. Benjamin has Down syndrome, I don't want Sherlock to... Well I know that you are irreproachable."
"Angie!" seems to bark the older one, turning her head to her sister. "That's my personal life... We'll talk about it at home, OK?"
The doctor raises the sleeves of his shirt and crosses his hands, looking at the young woman. He is extremely touched by her weakness and doesn't like at all that all this could be a facade.
"But there's somebody who helped him with all this and somebody who pressed the bloody trigger. Sherlock, who can like this...
The information probably won’t arrive to the great big brain, but it seemed wrong not to tell him; as much as looking at the naked shoulder for eighteen seconds seems wrong. John is not sure he’s already seen Sherlock in a short-sleeved tee-shirt. This one is ridiculously up, like a sailor showing a lady of pleasure his “Mom” tattoo on his right shoulder. And this damn gravity that comes back, against which he can't counter. His hand releases the sheet and lands on the cold skin. Gently, articulation by articulation, right before his palm perfectly fits closed over the rounded shape and his fingers carefully grasp.
The heat, it's the main subject right now, and for a nation hit by a low unemployment rate in a Europe in crisis, it's perfectly stupid. Between the small crackling radio in the kitchen and the free newspapers John is able to read in the underground, he learns theories more or less plausible about these historical temperatures. "An anticyclone coming down from the South" says the
"What happened between us… What is happening between us. I would never have... slept with you without having… guarantees, you know."
They get up both of a jump. The youngest man closes the computer without waiting, dusts his jacket, and they both go to the antipodes of the room. It's not really surprising that Mrs. Hudson calls them "my boys", they are not more mature than teenagers when they act like this.
John Watson has been scared of heights since he was a little boy. Emptiness only means one thing: the death call; the siphoned life where they're all going to end. His legs aren't useful anymore, so he comes closer to the ground, his hands hold on tight to the humid mud. Sherlock promised he'd catch him if he was falling, so Sherlock, catch me.
And it's a robotic voice, as cold as their hearts, as cold as the laid down body they just left, that's played in a loop, making both of them dizzy.
"Clothes," curses the younger man, who seems terribly disappointed by this discovery - but John remembers seeing him dancing with joy when they found the livers in a Vuitton suitcase when they were working on the corrupted doctor case, so he's no reference.
"It's about time. Sherlock, it's him, right? All the others whom we questioned cannot have killed Sherrer?"
Soldier that he was, he frowns, keeping silent his own feelings while he by-passes the cupboard to stick his ear to the wall papered with green. The noise is louder. He closes his eyes, tries to know where it's coming from and begins to blink his eyelids in rhythm. One blow after another, in a repetitive pace. Beatings. A pulsation. A
see that coming... That settles the mystery of Sheri Walsh's lie. It's good, for lack of arresting real criminals, we destroy lives of people who hurt nobody."
"Yes, I'm here willingly," he says ironically, looking above him at the neon lights covered with dust.
The word cracks in the air like thunder and John knows he must go back inside to protect himself before being messily hit. But he explores the hurricane by his gaze for a few more seconds without getting to express all those things he knows a friend should be able to say. But he just can't do it. He turns around, puts his seatbelt back on and says with a neutral voice:
They don't speak when Sherlock gets up from the armchair and soars onto the bed. That obliges John to move back, until he stretches out because Sherlock is now on all fours on top of him. He doesn't touch him, hands and knees pressed against the mattress. He's even advancing and John's wriggling to maintain the eye contact until he feels his feet leaving the carpet and his legs settling on the sheets that have already been warmed by his presence.
John comes a bit closer, puts his hands on his flatmate's hips, returns by automatism to the position which Sherlock imposed him in the living-room and waits to feel the hand of the detective holding the nape of his neck to open his mouth and put it around the hot member. It's not really a sensation he knows and the first seconds are long and heavy as the tip presses against his tongue. He takes his time to become used to this situation that he knows much more in another configuration and keeps his eyes closed. Diligently, he widens his tongue as far as possible, feels the latex rubbing his palate and jumps with surprise when his teeth get involved in the equation. It's not perfect, hell it isn't, but John won't stop. It takes him a few seconds to get used to the presence and to dare to swallow the cock a bit farther in his mouth and when Sherlock's first moan sings in his ear, the doctor's heart loses a beat for good.
"It's oppresive how she refuses to speak about it while, clearly, we all know it," replies John, bewildered.
"They took off the bag I had on my head once we entered the pool and it was the first time I saw him," taking the two cups, too tired to avoid getting burnt he came back to the living-room before sitting in his chair, Sherlock in front of him.
"Yes, something like that. And what are people going to say? 'Sherlock Holmes and John Watson together', that's absurd."
"What did you want to tell me?" asks Gregory, because it's clear that John wouldn't have come down with him just for the pleasure of freezing his ass off.
John turns his head and sees Lestrade come in, his forehead as glistening as his, his breath short, his jacket in his hand.
ou mean at the clinic, my workplace, where I save lives? Then yes, I was over there," smiles John instead of getting
"Because Mr. Holmes asked me why we had a row during the interval, so I had to tell him that you were banging an old man."
. She insisted on this word, remember? Yet all the received letters that we read were at least seven years old. Sherrer didn't have any friends, he just wanted to be the centre of attention."
They take the elevator and go to the reception to pay. The brunette is back. She slightly smells like alcohol and she still has some ink on the back of her hand with the logo of a famous club in Manchester. Sorry, John, she's way too young for you.
"Back then, there was a couple, like you, who lived on the second floor. A heterosexual couple, however. Charming people. They left when she got pregnant and when they wanted to buy. They always send me a card for my birthday."
The blond man breathes in noisily, feels the body which was holding him begin to move back, and he raises his right hand to catch the jumpers before they fall. He turns around just in time to see Sherlock waiting for him in the doorway.
All in all, John attended three concerts in his life. The first when he was 17, when he went to the concert of a boy from his class in a bar in West London, where perfectly hysterical girls screamed the name of the singer with greasy hair and dubious dentition. The second one happened the day of his 22th birthday, when the orchestra of his village - not exceptional but however pleasant - played a Rachmaninov étude with an out of tune violin and a harpist with a cold. The third one occurred in Camp Bastion, when the improvised choir sang a Christmas song full of hope in front of an audience wrapped-up in battledress, of which eight died the next day in a muddled and bloody attack which broke out near the camp.
"Well, Cain and Abel, even if it's very pleasing that you forgot about my existence, I'm going to leave you. Move, Sherlock, please," John grimaces, tapping the thigh of his flatmate under the cover to tell him that it's time to think about moving.
“Well, yeah… those are Reichenbach Violets. I know because he make them grow near the Royal Observatory - and it’s a miracle it’s working as the climate here isn’t adapted for this kind of plants.”
Molly starts to ask precise questions to which John didn’t have time to think about so he makes up a story that seems credible and tries by any way possible to not think about the taste of dirt which invaded his mouth when he felt in the wasteland. Mrs. Hudson comes out in her turn with bakeries she did. They all talk about her cooking now and if it reassures John the first minutes, it soon tire him. He lets them talk and sits on his chair, absolutely washed-up, but incapable of closing his eyes now that they’re staring at the leather armchair in front of him.
This time it's Sherlock who leans forward, his bottom barely hanging on the folding seat, his elbows on the guardrail; the reason is Hungarian. In his right hand, John presses a bit tighter the A5 paper where is written the program:
It had been two weeks since Sherlock had asked if he could stay in John’s office from time to time. That had apparently meant that he would show up almost every day, pace around John’s office or sit in the chair facing John and stare out into the air. He rarely spoke, just muttered under his breath sometimes. John had the feeling that this was what Sherlock did at home and now he had just moved location to John’s office. He didn’t seem aware of John most of the time. John didn’t say it out loud because he didn’t want to make Sherlock stop coming but his presence made it really hard for John to concentrate. It was even worse the days Sherlock didn’t show up, then he just sat staring at the door waiting. Now he was giving into his urge to ask Sherlock questions instead of grading papers.
- Dr Watson, he is my colleague, Sherlock filled in. They were shown into a conference room. There were more people in the room than John anticipated. One older man that John faintly recognised, probably from TV. He guessed that it was the CO of the bank. Bur there were four other people in the room that he didn’t recognise.
- I thought you were likely to visit someone concerning the case, that isn’t many. We have already been to Mr Bryce place and I didn’t recognise the address you gave so I guess Mrs Gordon. John could see that Sherlock was pleased but he didn’t say anything. He stared out the window and by the way his eyes glazed over John could tell he was thinking hard. No point in disturbing him then. He had his own thoughts to keep him occupied, because he had just made a disturbing realization. John had gotten butterflies in his stomach when Sherlock smiled at him. That was not good, not good at all. Was it still some lingering feelings from last night or was this something new? Or was it something old and he was just noticing it now? Either way John found it disturbing. His life was complicated enough without him falling in love with Sherlock. He just had to wait until the feelings died out, which they probably would during the day. He had just been dazzled by the attention and charm that Sherlock used sometimes. He had seen countless men and women succumbing to Sherlock's charm when he chose to use it. This was just the first time they were used on him.
There are a few seconds where his body seems to melt against the sheets, where his thoughts are as tangible as the surrounding air. John gives a small cry while he comes, for what feels like forever, in uncontrolled knocks of hips. There's a wave of words invading his mouth, shivering at the end of his tongue, pushed by an orgasm which is stealing away all his strength - but he still has enough to retain them.
The hand of the youngest tightens, he holds him, prevents him from falling and assists him to stand up a little more. But John doesn't imagine himself refusing his help, because he knows that he couldn't make it without Sherlock.
There is no longer anyone in the Royal Festival Hall and the wood smell has disappeared. John only sees Sherlock, standing on the feasible and himself, standing next to the horn. They are in confrontation, soldiers of a war of which the armistice seems to rhyme with illusion.
file tried to make Sherlock believe. He wants to delete this file, but it's too big to fit in the trash and he knows he'll need help to get rid of it.
The doctor quickly looks at his flatmate who smiles like a spoiled kid and answers by raising his eyes to heaven.
! It's no use, they're in a state of shock. Get in touch with Lestrade..." orders suddenly the doctor, looking daggers at his flatmate, before looking at the stupefied troop. "Don't worry, we're taking care of this."
John doesn't answer and Sherlock smiles. It's not his "I've won" smile, nor the superior one which he brings out when a suspect admits to being guilty. It's such a discreet smile that it's necessary to be as close as they are to see it. He just has the left corner of his mouth raised and the edges of his eyes are punctuated by small wrinkles more expressive than all of those which John has already seen in his life.
"I am quite serious," answers the youngest one without breaking eye contact with his friend, cheeks pink from having laughed too much.
, but he does as ordered and squeezes. It probably has to hurt Sherlock, but neither of them will complain about it.
John smiles over the perfumed steam of his hot drink, which he turns slowly to melt the sugar Sherlock thought of adding.
The ex-soldier brushed all of his thoughts aside before coming back to the humid reality of his trousers, which were sticking to his right leg. A quick gaze to his flatmate who was on his feet in front of him, and his face as white as the tiles, permitted a tiny smile on the detective's face. They were maybe going to die, but at least it was perfectly clear that nothing that was happening in the empty pool was even remotely normal. Great; at least John didn't have the impression he became entirely crazy.
“Oh! What a splendid bouquet, it’s rare to find those kind of flowers in London!” he says with delight.
"Fucking Christ, Sherlock what's your problem? If I called John and only John it's because I knew I could trust him and that you, you would blow up the whole thing!"
Clara suddenly closes her lips and breathes for a long time. John swallows, reveals the muscles of his jaw which are contracting under the shaved skin and doesn't shake his head. Not this time. He's in front of his sister's ex, they're the same size, have the same gaze, and they tighten both their fists. But John doesn't want to think of their resemblances. He grabs his jacket, which he puts on, and leaves the waiting room without a backwards glance. Almost running, he feels the pen that he forgot to leave in the back pocket of his pants. He grabs it by reflex and quickly presses the hood.
"Well I won't force you, then. But this is the last time I'm warning you: for the sake of everybody, follow me."
"In the blue waste," he announces, proud to show to his flatmate his teaching on the waste sorting did serve, after all.
Finally, as they’re approaching Mallaig, they accelerate, and accelerate again despite the city. The harbor is a few minutes away. Sherlock knows the road by heart, and he guides John as the best wingman ever. They finally arrive, get out of the car, and stand rooted to the spot. The ship is already far away and leaves them behind like completely perfect idiots. It's John that cuts off the awkward silence.
Heat on the tips of his fingers, against his palm. On his forehead, cheek. Sherlock's hands are holding him. Maintaining him. John, him, still can't feel his right hand.
Both friends look at each other, frown slightly, and approach the car of which the bonnet is opened, hiding an unstable shape which seems to dance on the sizzling air that comes out of the radio.
The psychopath slowly walks down the stairs. Theatrically, he clenches his fist against his chest, under the intensity of the song and he still doesn't open his eyes. He gets closer, a foot after the other as if he's walking on silk and he’s shaking his finger in he air to mark the rhythm. He should stop walking, John is sure about that fact, but no, he's coming closer and closer and now is so near them that John draws back by reflex. Sherlock doesn't move. It's inevitable and it ends like this: Moriarty is facing him.
"No, no, there's no awkwardness. The only embarrassment he caused was telling me details of your private life -whatever you're doing- and that's none of my business," he smiles.
Sherlock nods once and rests the crop against the collarbone which gives in under the pressure. It's not his wounded shoulder but John moves back all the same, and it takes him a few seconds to understand that was the purpose anyway. His grey eyes squint from the leather tip to Sherlock's hand and when his feet bang against the coffee table, he knows they have arrived in the middle of the living-room.
"Bad, otherwise she wouldn't have fallen dead drunk down her staircase - is there some hot water left?"
It's been the case since Sherlock raised his hand, his finger approaching the collarbone marked by a bullet and a bad operation, which the ex-soldier will remember all his life. He hadn't touched John but that didn't prevent the blond-haired man from feeling him, more than ever. It's because the youngest man spoke about the scar without feigned fascination that this moment remains engraved in his memory, as if a bad boy would have written his name on the classroom's wooden table with a Stanley knife. And Sherlock is a brat, everybody knows that.
"020 7371 7600. It's the number of the Thai. Their Som Taï are r-rather good, but I recommend their-r Thai Pat."
Slowly, the detective's fingers release their possessive pressure around the fair hair, before resting the head against the sheets. They seem to both find the use of their bodies (incredibly broken, seeing the slowness of their movements) and Sherlock boldly wipes off his hand against the blanket before sitting down without a lot of grace near the head-board, which bangs one more time against the wall.
It's almost eight o'clock and, hearing the night shift personnel walking in the corridor, he gets up and puts on his jacket. He hardly has time to put his hand on the latch before the door of his office opens wide.
This time it's Sherlock who kneels and while he catches some of the fair hair to get his face close to the doctor's, his second hand rolls up around the hard length already wet with precome.
He threatened me, said he could put incriminating pictures on my computer if i didn’t let you stay. But if you were any other student you would be out from this university at once. Stealing body parts, I have never heard about anything like it.
I solved the case, Sherlock stretched his legs out in front of him, taking a sip of wine. John got a bit distracted with how very long Sherlocks legs were.
- Well, that was tedious, Sherlock said when they settled into the cab. John didn’t reply, Sherlock continued anyway.
My issues as you put it almost got you strangled, said John between gritted teeth. He didn’t want to have this conversation, he wanted to be alone again.
- I’m feeling a bit sorry that you’ve not been on a date before but I didn’t know that when I asked. Sherlock looked at John for a moment before he nodded, relief flooded John’s body.
I think you do, I trust you. John opened his mouth to object but closed it again. What could he say?
- Well, It’s not been as obvious for everyone else. I have known who my father was since my teens. But it’s been a secret for everyone else. On the outside it just looked like a man being extra nice to his daughter's friend. Miss Williams smiled but she looked sad and John thought it can’t have been easy living with that secret your whole life.
- Is this part of the act? he asked, nervous about the answer. Was this one of Sherlock’s mind games, was someone watching them and he was playing his part, of was this the real Sherlock?
“It wasn’t a miracle. It was a carefully calculated plan. I could tell you…” he trailed off. He could hear a huff coming from John.
- As you would expect, caring is not an advantage, Sherlock said and leaned against the wall. John picked up his book again, thinking the conversation was over.
“I don’t know how much of myself physically I can give. However, I didn’t think I liked kissing ten minutes ago. If you want me like this, I’m yours.” Sherlock felt exposed in a way he had never done before. He had never been as frightened over an answer before either. It was both frightening and liberating. He knew that even if John would turn him down, he would do it gently. John didn’t answer, instead he moved so he stood in front of Sherlock, then leaned in and kissed him softly. Sherlock flinched as the weight of John made him press his back harder against the doorframe. John immediately stood back.
- Out with it, whatever it is that is making you stomp around like a grumpy child. John’s hands grabbed the countertop so hard his knuckles went white. He took some deep breaths, trying to steady himself. He knew it was pointless saying that nothing was wrong. Sherlock was bad at picking up on other people’s emotions but he wasn’t blind. And it was like he had grown a sixth sense concerning John. Deducing him so easily it sometimes felt like he was reading John’s mind.
“Means.” He felt out of his depth. More than he had in a long time. John took Sherlock’s hand, but didn’t move closer. Still, Sherlock saw it as a good sign.
- I don’t know,  was Sherlock’s answer. He had a twinkle in his eyes that gave John a warm feeling in his stomach, but also made him weary. That twinkle usually meant more experiments and lots of long nights without sleep.
I have to go, I’m on a case and the clock is ticking. I really didn’t have time to come to see you at all. I just… I couldn’t concentrate when you were avoiding me. Sherlock gave John another quick kiss, then he walked out of the office without a second glance. John sat down on the desk, stunned. He wasn’t really sure what just had happened. Somehow he had gone from breaking up with Sherlock to being in an outspoken relationship with him. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he took it out. “I’ll see you soon. X SH.”. John smiled, he got an x at least.
- John, I’ve already told you, I want all of you. It’s you that need to make up your mind. With those words Sherlock continued walking and John had to run to keep up. They walked in silence the rest of the way home. John was mentally kicking himself, he felt like he had messed up. He wasn’t sure about much these days, but he was sure he didn’t want to mess this up. He didn’t want to hurt Sherlock. He was still thinking about what to do when they entered the apartment. Sherlock took of his coat and headed for the living room. Then he stopped and turned around.
“You’re going to say we can’t be friends or live together because of my feelings but we have been friends for several years now without my feelings being a problem. So there is no need to change anything now.”
- I and my wife are hosting a dinner party tomorrow night at eight. If you want to talk to people that we suspect. John looked at him with a question in his eyes.
“For dying.” It wasn’t what Sherlock had planned to say, but it was the truest thing he could think of now that he saw John. Saw what he had done. It had been clever and it had been necessary. But it had broken John. John made a sound halfway between a giggle and a sob.
“No, I’m not. That’s not why.” Sherlock could see that John wasn’t convinced. He unbuttoned his cuffs and rolled up the arms over his elbows. John took a step forward as Sherlock stretched out both of his arms for John to see. John touched Sherlock’s wrist where there were still red marks from the restraints he had been in just days before.
- Come on over John. We need to see if we can find anything new in the surveillance. I’m stuck, I don’t like being stuck. John sighted but he folded his paper and watched the tv instead. They had gotten the footage from the three cameras in the room of the safe deposit boxes. Sherlock had chosen to start with the one that filmed the entrance, the date was six months ago. They sat in silence watching as people came and went. John was bored after five minutes and after half an hour he was ready to cry of boredom.
John, he said beggingly but John didn’t look up. He was hiding his face in his hands, to embarrassed to look at Sherlock. He felt numb and tired. Like he never would be able to get up. He heard Sherlock move towards him and his body tensed, he clenched his fists. It seemed Sherlock could see this because he stopped, he stood still for a moment. Seemingly unable to decide what to do. Then he took a deep breath and walked away. He closed the door quietly behind him. John felt tears burning behind his eyelids at the sound and shut his eyes to stop them from falling. He had never felt more horrified or scared than now. In the war there had usually been something he could do, something to make his situation a bit better. And there had always been the thought that he was going home to keep his spirits up in dark times. But he couldn’t leave this situation. It was within him. He had just attacked Sherlock, a student and his maybe boyfriend. Could he continue teaching when he could snap anytime? He had thought he had it under control, but that had been wrong. And now he had ruined everything with Sherlock. He thought about how he had given Sherlock his first kiss yesterday, and how Sherlock had liked to cuddle. Would he dare to do that to anyone else now? When his first attempt had ended in him almost being strangled? John sat on the floor until his body ached from the uncomfortable position until it went numb. His mind kept going over the same questions over and over again. He startled when there was a knock on the door.
- As apparent from the sisters jewellery, she is in serious dept. Probably due to alcohol since her hands were trembling. She is trying to drown out the fact that her husband is not so secretly gay and screwing her brother.
The twinkle in his eyes told John what Sherlock was talking about. His heart skipped another beat and he felt like this thing between him and Sherlock was bound to cause heartbreak for his part.
- First of all I don’t like it when you conduct your experiments on me. I’m your friend, not your lab rat. John took a deep breath that was the easy part. Sherlock was still standing at the door leaning against the wall, his eyes closed. He showed no sign of hearing John.
"Did it go okay?" He said. Mr Holmes nodded, his eyes looking around the room, not fixating on anything.
- He knew he was getting older and he wanted to set things right. He came to me a while back with this stamp, the post office. And he told me he wanted to tell his family about me, he wanted to include me in his will. He wanted me to have all of his stamps since I was the only one of his children who collected. But he didn’t expect to die so soon and now I don’t know what to do. She sobbed and John reached out to pat her knee.
- You look nice, he said. Sherlock looked down in his body like he had forgotten what he was wearing.
"Doyouhavetimeforacoffee?" Mr Holmes asked fast. He met John’s gaze for a second and then looked away again.
"But you can come back and borrow my card again if you need to" John said, feeling like he needed to soften the blow. Sherlock nodded and left without a word.
Dr Watson, are you still there? I’m about to lock up. It was the securityguard. John cleared his throat before answering.
"Please, sit down" he indicated the chair opposite the desk. Mr Holmes sat down but started to bounce his leg as soon as he sat down.
“Cruel.” Sherlock said quietly, not intending for John to hear it. But John’s grip tightened telling him that he had heard. They sat in silence while John got his breathing under control.
- Do you want to explain? Sherlock asked uncharacteristically. Usually he would just tell everyone his deductions. Miss Williams took a deep breath before she opened her mouth.
Can I kiss you now? Sherlock asked. John opened his mouth but he couldn’t make himself speak. He had expected to be shot down, for Sherlock to tell him that it was to inconvenient for him to form any attachment and just leave.
“I… “John seemed lost for words. He finally met Sherlock’s gaze. He looked hurt, his eyes full with tears. Sherlock started to realise that it wasn’t just the word cleaver that had been a mistake. He was still trying to find something to say when John kissed him. That it took Sherlock by surprise was an understatement. Both that John was actually kissing him, that was something new. And the fact that it wasn’t a very good kiss. It was more of a pressing of lips against each other, and it was wet and salty. It reminded Sherlock of the kind of kiss he had gotten once when he was twelve. He hadn’t had much experience since then so maybe kissing was just one of those things people did that he didn’t particularly like. But he had assumed John was good at kissing. His girlfriends had always stayed long after they should have broken up with him so Sherlock had assumed he was good at the physical things of a relationship to make up for his lack of emotions. But John’s hand that wasn’t over his heart was now in the nape of his neck, pulling him forward. That was a more enjoyable touch. Sherlock’s hands were hovering over John’s arms, wondering if he should pull John closer or push him away. Before he could make up his mind though, John broke off the kiss and stepped back a bit.
- I’m not sure. I’ll need to process some things first. He sounded tired and John was reminded how Sherlock loathed these kinds of events. Too many people to deduce, too many inputs. If John felt his head was full, he could only imagine how Sherlock was feeling. Sherlock walked closer, still hands in his pockets. John assumed he was going to mimic Johns pose with his back against the wall so he closed his eyes again. In the distans he could hear classical music drifting from inside. He opened them again when Sherlock’s shoes scraped against his own. Sherlock was standing close, very close. Their toes were touching, Sherlock was looming over him, one hand on the wall to steady him. John could feel his pulse quicken. Sure that Sherlock didn’t bother with personal space, but this was something new. But not unpleasant. It felt safe and exiting at the same time. John met Sherlock’s eyes. It was hard to see in the darkness but he looked worried. And it looked like he was searching John’s face for something, some answer.
What? John’s voice rose without him wanting it. He was grateful Sherlock had started to close the door as soon as he entered John’s work room. Sherlock stopped and looked at John, he didn’t seem to think that was an odd response.
"Sure" John said. In his mind thinking of what he was going to say to Mr Holmes when he got a hold of him.
- I want more, John replied without hesitation. Sherlock’s grip on John tightened, and then he kissed him again. But with force this time, letting John know what he had been holding back. John felt his mouth being forced open by Sherlock’s tongue, feel his teeth scrape against Sherlock’s as he leaned into the kiss. He stood on his toes for better reach. He gasped when Sherlock’s hands moved to pull at John’s sweater. His hands were hot on John’s skin. John couldn’t stifle a moan as Sherlock’s hands caressed his chest and back.
- They are the victims of this theft. Sherlock nodded in their direction and sat down in a chair opposite. John took the seat next to him. He could feel Sherlock bouncing his leg, his energy hard to contain. Mr Jackson took a seat at the head of the table and nodded to the man that had shown them in. He quickly exited the room and closed the door behind him. That gave a sense of privacy tough there were large glass windows out to the rest of the bank. They were seen but couldn’t be heard.
Yes, drugs, mostly cocaine. I have been clean for three months. He started pacing again, avoiding meeting John’s eyes.
“You could have died” he had meant to sound angry but it came out as a whisper. John rolled his eyes. In that moment, Sherlock couldn’t see anything of his John in the person standing in front of him.
- Mr Bryce the older last opened his safe deposit box six months ago, since then we have no record of anyone trying to access it. John nodded to show that he understood. He could see why Sherlock was pleased. It was almost like a locked room mystery.
Sherlock, John said after an hour or so in silence. Sherlock was now looking through John’s bookcase. He turned around, a copy of Gray’s anatomy in his hands.
I want you to tell me how much you lied about yesterday, something flashed in Sherlock’s eyes and he sat down in the chair eying John.
Over the following weeks Sherlock acted like nothing had happened and John took the cue. It felt strange going on cases, watching TV, eating dinner, acting like nothing was different. Sherlock acted so normal he made John think he had dreamt the whole thing. The only thing he could say for certain was that he was different. Sherlock had planted an idea in John's head and it grew. More and more of his thoughts was filled with Sherlock. Wondering how it would be like kissing Sherlock, touching him. How would it be being close to him? Sherlock was all angles, bone and hard muscle. Nothing John usually found attractive and still. Sometimes his hands would itch from the yearning of pulling them through Sherlock’s hair. Would Sherlock be as bossy in bed as he was in everyday life? John thought about previous lovers that had gotten soft in his arms, would Sherlock do that? John was driving himself crazy with all his questions. Until one day when he had enough. He couldn’t go round thinking more; he was a man of action. He picked up his courage and went to Sherlock who was sitting at his microscope. John stood in front of Sherlock waiting for him to acknowledge John's presence, that didn’t happen.
too, but that’s another topic.Then this jerk started to follow me when I was going out, without me noticing it, of course. Anyway, when he understood I had different penchants and that I wasn’t the kind to bother with vanilla sex, he started to ask me so many questions about dom and subs, what is okay to do and what is not… That’s how I teached him about BDSM. It was purely theoretical. We spent months like this. I think that’s what got him to gain interest on crimes of passion and started to understand the mechanic of the sentiments. And one night, the theory went out of control and he told me he wanted to practice. We thought it would work, me as his Dom and him as my Sub, and…”
"Sheri," John calls up as if he is talking to an old friend. "Everything is going to be okay. It's easier for us to question you separately. Are you willing to tell me what happened that evening, please?"
Sherlock smiles one last time and that simple movement of his lips leaves a red-hot iron track on John's mind, who only thinks about the kiss he should have blown on it.
bedroom anyway. He almost cried when he saw the sign “Self-serve buffet – CLOSED”. The Auxhall Fiesta still smells of cigarettes, and Sherlock asks himself if it wouldn't be more practical to buy a packet, because he's very close to setting a seat on fire to try to smoke it.
Shit, it's not something he thought about before putting a condom on the member (very well built, by the way) of his flatmate and before pushing it into his panting mouth, but from now on to joke about Sherlock Holmes' sexual life is going to be much more difficult, now that they are... that they are...
John booked two single rooms on the way. The hotel, chosen by the detective, is actually quite chic, with a pretty receptionist and nice decoration. They take their keys and go up together, seeing as John failed to find the right words to please the pretty brunette. With Sherlock around, he just can't seduce. Yes, he’s a pleasant man; he's not the one who says so, but he’s heard it enough to believe it.
Long live AO3. Here's a new chapter already because the last comments just boosted me SO DAMN MUCH. Thank you all, you're awesome!
There are steps walking toward them now, heavy and so slow. The steps don't even slow down in front of the kitchen or the living-room; the intruder knows they're in the bedroom. John has the reflex to close his forefinger against his palm but when he realises that once again both of their lives come down to the first phalanx of the detective, it's a simple prayer that occurs to him.
The thumbs of the detective rest in the hollows of the soft cheeks, the rest of his fingers waiting under his jaw, and as if his neck had no more use anymore John feels his head supported in a way he had never known before. That lasts one second, maybe two, but it's already sufficient to frighten him, because that proves to him that it is possible to get rid of this nasty weight which presses against his back, his lungs and all of his old body, for so many years.
scores in his hands. It's always getting back to him as a gentle but firm slap behind his neck, even if it's bloody obvious, that Sherlock is genuinely beautiful with his almond-shaped eyes which are as offensive as they are cherishing, his milky skin and the brown curls contrasting on the top of his skull. Sherlock Holmes must have been created to drive the world mad and it's not John who'll say otherwise, not when the only thing crossing his mind right now is how much he wants to pull him into his arms and lay him on the bed against which they're sitting - but of course, it's not very polite to fuck somebody between sheets that are not your property.
. They switched off all the lights, until they are only enlightened by the screen of the small television, and while Sherlock's fist is put against the prominence of his cheekbone, John sees in this scene printed in chiaroscuro a sufficient reason to speak:
"We have one right below, let's take advantage of it: MRS. HUDSON! MRS. HUDSON, WHO KILLED PHILLIP SHERRER?" he roars all at once.
"Did you hear that, John? The man takes care of flowers," smiles Sherlock to his friend, who's already rolling his eyes.
, but he needs time. He breathes in, as profoundly as possible and closes his eyes. His fingers are tightening their grip around Sherlock's fine shoulders until he feels his bones. In his head, there are the frank words of Clara, the bruises on his sister's face, the voice of Major Sholto entrusting him with the trip to Marjah along with the new recruits, the confident gaze of Lestrade, and it's piling up, pressing, agglutinating. They represent, as hundreds of other things and people, thousands of grains which are composing these quicksands on which he's been building up his life for so many years, and it's sucking up everything he is. And God, he's suffocating.
! What do you... what are you... Oh my God, you're still worried, right? Everything's fine, Sherlock, I can handle it, okay?" he said shouting, the mere concept of living in the city and being surrounded by sleeping neighbours had slipped his mind.
With a head heavy from sleep pulling him in, his muscles trembled under weary spasms, so close, so close to finally falling asleep, before a voice brought him back to the harsh and exhausting reality in one go:
"Great," he smiles and it's clear with this false grin that he didn't listen to a thing that his friend said.
- he wants to know what it feels like to be motionless. They look at each other, don't even blink even if it burns their pupils - some kind of male pride, as usual - and when Sherlock finally puts his hands on the cheeks of the man he overhangs, it's not soft. It's not violent either. It is a gesture so confident that it looks like they have been making it all their lives.
Once back in Baker Street, the doctor hadn't taken any offense at the faded lights and the silence. He had walk directly to his room, before falling asleep still half dressed, hand tightened around the mobile which he hadn't switched off after his small tour on the terrace. But that's something Sherlock doesn't need to know.
They're surrounded by a smothering heat and the fact that the doctor's mouth is taken doesn't help him to breathe as he'd like. He breathes in through the nose, expires through the mouth when Sherlock pulls out far enough, and swallows when he can, but all the vital acts aren't really their priority now. Sherlock's cock still sinks farther and the hips John's holding begin to move in rhythm, incited by the guttural groans which manage to escape from his throat.
