“To you maybe! Which is what I mean. It’s you who’s always thinking something. Like just now,” John said, leaning back, and gazing at him through slightly narrowed eyes. “You almost didn’t quite look like yourself.”
They are currently crouched side by side across the street from their haunted house on what Sherlock likely imagines is a grand stakeout.
“How did you know I came from London, Mr Watson?” Magnussen deflected, moving away from him to walk around the room. The conversation was apparently not enough to hold his attention.
He could have ridden away, if not for the rope up ahead, suspended between the thick trunks of two trees. It was almost invisible, and had been intended for him to ride off into at a mad pace, only to be knocked from his horse when he hit the line. For a moment, he considered how low he might be if he were to bend over the back of his saddle. His horse’s head would still be in the way. Damn.
That hit a little bit too close to home for John, seeing as he’d been practically living on Sherlock’s blog, and had every intention of following him around that night. Rather than deny it, John decided to circumvent it.
Sebastian turned to him for the first time in the conversation to ease the tension.
However, nothing surprised John more than the concluding sentence, which, of an otherwise detailed and anatomical lesson plan, informed him that his partner would be vulnerable, sensitive and open, and that they might be “in need of quiet affection and gentle words.” Underneath, the guide was signed off with a simple set of initials, “
As John trailed his mouth downward, nipping at his throat, sliding fully down his body, he realized John’s intent. “You needn’t -” he stammered, but John only shushed him and began opening his trousers.
“A dog named Howard? Right. Yeah. I guess unusual pet names go hand in hand with believing in ghosts, why didn’t I see that one –“
“Thank you for all your help,” Mrs Davis said, finally taking her purse back from Sherlock. “My husband and I used to run a business together too, it’s so good to see you two working it out.” She patted Sherlock’s cheek, before descending the stairs with an oddly spry step.

The polite thing would be to not comment on it. But John was not a polite man, and that course of action didn’t quite align with John’s interests. Decided, John went all in.
He also couldn’t put it down.
He dropped to his knees in front of John, the soft ground cushioning the blow. There were still white azalea petals on the ground, difficult to see before through the fog. John made a soft sound in response, wonderingly beginning to ask, “Sherlock, what -”
He made sure to keep his
Had Sherlock intended for him to sleep somewhere else now? He should have asked while they’d been together by the fire, but getting up to find out now seemed silly. After all, every time he’d attempted to discuss the bed situation, Sherlock shrugged him off.
“Please, John,” he pleaded, not caring that he was begging.
“It is,” John said, though without much enthusiasm. It was pleasant to be sure, but he didn’t have any particular attachment to Market Chipping. “It’s nice.”
He pouted at John. “No costume?
“What did she just say?” John asked.
“That’s inevitable,” Sherlock said dismissively, simply glad it wasn’t anything worse - like the Inspector calling to ask them a few questions, before they’d had time to prepare. “Rather forward to directly ask the master of the house. I expected them to skulk around the lawns and grab at the servants.”
Such as, if Sherlock was drinking fluids now, surely they must have to—well—secrete the waste in some way. John considered whether this could be done through sweat alone, or by other means, and assumed that had to be the case. While Sherlock wore coveralls at all times now, John had seen Sherlock naked the first day, and there hadn’t been anything resembling genitalia in their groin area. Not that John had been looking, and not that John was thinking about it.
Sherlock making dark, hot sounds deep in his throat, and Janine would tilt his head up to kiss him harder. Janine, forward Janine, slipping her hands down his straining dress shirt, down until they palmed him, hard in his trousers. (Would he be hard for her? Yes, of course he would,)
John was not in an obliging mood. “Almost half of patients who come into emergency with cocaine toxicity get admitted,” John said, putting the cup back on its tray. “Plus, everything else that was on that list.”
John would usually react poorly to being reminded of his psychosomatic injury and his always present assistive device, bulky and awkward along the side of his leg, but oddly found himself smiling instead. “Well. You’ve got me there.”
“Yes?” Sherlock appeared to be as flummoxed by the conversation as John was by his answer.
“Now that we’ve established that,” John continued, his smile grim. “Either tell me you know how to break the spell that’s on me, or kindly leave.”
“At least those damn reporters might be good for something,” John commented ruefully, causing Sherlock to smirk back at him. Sherlock would always have an appreciation for John exposing his natural anti-socialness.
"There's a local man, always around that cottage,” David said, already triumphant. “He’s odd, sleeps on the beach. I bet you anything he saw it.”
Something else occurs to John.
A woman’s brushes, combs, and all the best scents and powders money could buy were laid out on the dressing table. A satin dressing gown was hung over the back of a chair, with a pair of slippers beneath. The bed had been made.
Sherlock, for whatever reason, needed John Watson to be present at all times. Sherlock had suspected it within moments of meeting him, and had fully confirmed it by the following evening when John had killed for him.
She placed one arm loosely along the back of neck as he began to lead her masterfully to the tune of Roses from the South. The Strauss was endless.
“Sure you don’t want to come stay with me? Won’t you get bored in one of those dreary bedsits?”
Right. John hadn’t thought much about that. Was that a flattering photo of him? He should have picked that photo with more care, but he only had so many, and it was ridiculous for a man his age to take photos of himself. God, what had Sherlock been picturing him like?
Sherlock was thankful his faculties had fully returned to him, otherwise his gears wouldn’t already be turning over how to protect John from the outside forces that would try to pull them apart.
John slid the case onto the side table as if burned, and reached for Sherlock blindly, lifting him up from the floor and onto the chair with him. He was too tall, and the chair was barely wide enough for the both of them, but they managed somehow, and he was glad for it. John clutched at him, and he embraced John in return as much as he was able, with John’s arms like a vice around him.
“I think you’ll find Mr Watson that I can be very crass.”
After an hour of laboured walking, his hand stiff where it gripped the handle and pain shooting up his leg, John came to almost regret that decision. At a particularly annoying twinge, John cursed his leg, and threw his cane onto the ground. The cracking sound that followed was the cherry on top of John’s charming afternoon.
John became so engrossed with finding the rest of Mike that he was caught entirely off guard by the trap he was voluntarily entering.
“I have no idea. Is that all, Jim?”
to say it. There’s always a chance, for us.”
“You said you could see things about people. That you could know things about them, see right through them,” Watson stated.
John stays as quiet and still as he is able. Sherlock is still under him, around him.
The man nearly preened, grinning back at him.
2. This lil guy could go with any chapter, but check out this
“Was he not?” John asked, taken aback perhaps by the news that his servants were squabbling below.
“It will heal over, John,” Sherlock reassured him. When John looked up from Sherlock’s neck, he found himself warmed by Sherlock’s gaze even through his dusty visor.
“An excellent point Your Majesty,” the Royal Wizard conceded with a bowed head. “However, with the recent loss of our Captain of the Guard, the enemy views us as weakened, hence their attacks along our coast. So you see, we need every able witch and wizard we can get.”
He lowered his eyes, and what he saw in John calmed him for a moment, though it didn’t last for long.
Tonight, Sherlock’s coat is in the bed with them. Like a melted man, it sits in a puddle at the foot of the bed, arms crossed over and folded. John doesn’t like the look of it in the dim light, so pulls it up towards him with his feet, and tosses it over them. Wet wool, old smoke, new cologne. Sherlock doesn’t question this, the same way John didn’t question its presence. Sherlock slips closer across the sheet till his head is under John’s chin, and his breath puffs across John’s chest, stirring the few light hairs that reside there. John kisses the crown of Sherlock’s head. It smells like John’s shampoo. They share now, he supposes. Under the coat’s protection, the tale goes on.
Hush. John stretches his arms above his head, hands slipping beneath his pillow. He breathes out hard through his nose. He looks at the ceiling. It’s just, you know that if you want sex, you can just say so. We don’t need this whole song and dance about being a penne and a spaghetti, or a baguette and a bun, or—
Lestrade was uncharacteristically dour. He assumed there was an issue with one of the staff, which Lestrade would hate to bring to the master’s attention.
He turned over, ready to seek John out, but John had fully retreated to the other side of the bed. Similar to how he himself had acted before.
John was in the midst of slipping into his standard issue navy coveralls when he was startled by the sudden high-pitched tone of an incoming signal, causing him to bang his elbow hard against the back wall of his coffin-sized sleeping quarters.
“Yeah, it bloody matters!” John cried out, unable to contain himself any longer. “There are people looking for you now, who you do not want to be found by, I can
Ah, and there was her true motive.
He had two options: he could convince John to fire Moriarty, or play Moriarty’s game. The prior option - while appealing - would be counterproductive to his primary mission, which was bringing Manderley, and therefore John, back to life. In the short term, this meant convincing John to host the fancy dress ball. He had to admit Moriarty’s leadership seemed to result in smooth operations, and he wasn’t entirely sure they could pull a ball off without him. There had to be a reason John had kept him on. The man seemed… ‘off’ to be sure, but he supposed Moriarty hadn’t ever done anything that would justify the harshness of terminating his contract. Moriarty wasn’t anything more than a servant who had grown too comfortable in his position in the house, looking to intimidate the new master - and he wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.
“I’m shaking in my seat,” the Royal Wizard—Mycroft—said, who looked only pitying. “Sherlock, nothing I say will do any harm. And whatever you think those organs you have are accomplishing, you’d be better off—”
“We can likely rely on them to take advantage of the opportunity to act again,” Watson concluded for him, and Sherlock beamed at him with undisguised pride. Watson returned his smile, before turning back to Stamford.
Sherlock’s excitement grew when he found their bedroom empty, and the attached bathroom door closed. John must have been remarkably sore from their morning of standing. However, as Sherlock approached the bathroom door, his initial excitement turned to nervousness. What if John wanted to be left alone, especially in a private moment like this? What if Sherlock’s presence would be unwelcome? Sherlock was still attached to his past way of thinking, struggling to believe that John could truly want him as intensely as he wanted John. After all, John had never initiated physical intimacy between them. It was always him. Sherlock knew it was because of John’s lack of certainty in Sherlock’s feelings, and his guilt over the imbalance in their relationship due to their ages (wrongly inflated in his mind). Sherlock knew that, intellectually, but was woefully unable to grasp it emotionally.
Sherlock returned to observing the rain against the window glass, though briefly considered changing his position for a long deep stare into the fireplace. Better stay at the window - it wouldn’t do to appear like he had put effort into his presentation.
“He has been doing that more often as of late,” Mrs Hudson mused. After seeing the look on John’s face, she hurried to say, “But I’m sure it’s just taking him more time to get here because he’s coming all the way from Kingsbury! Give him some time.”
“I’m not finished. A man of your status could never have gone that route however, so you had actually once seriously considered pursuing a military career. I believe you even trained for it for a time, which might explain your posture and general neatness, before you had to abandon the ambition. Likely due to responsibilities – your parents’ death forcing you to become proper master of Manderley.”
John cleared his throat.
John wasn’t surprised when they traveled far outside the boundaries of any of the current bot routes, and had a feeling he wouldn’t be surprised by what lay at the end of this journey. It was left unsaid, much like John’s many questions, which Sherlock seemed to be about to provide some answers to.
. Not to mention every jerky movement of the car jostling all passengers into one another, forcing him to touch other people. Was there anything more undignified than public transport?
Sherlock examined John’s face, but couldn’t find even the slightest trace of doubt. Amazingly, John did seem to mean it. He wondered whether there was any end to John’s trust and belief in him, and more importantly, whether he was worthy of it.
“Uh, no,” John said, face scrunching in delightful confusion. “Why—? When the hell have I ever said that?”
John stays close to the platform edge while Sherlock moves further back near the wall where he can observe without fear of being noticed. John’s face is truly capable of conveying many different emotions at once – he currently appears to be annoyed and resigned, while also contemplating whether he has enough time to buy a pack of gum from the kiosk further down the platform.
“Catch your breath, sir,” Lestrade advised, and he realized he’d been speaking too fast, possibly too fast to be understood. He did that sometimes.
Sherlock knocked on the door, which was answered shortly after by Doctor Murray himself. A very unremarkable looking man (army medic in the past, struggled when he first returned to English soil, now happily married with one child, a boy of seven, etc.), and yet all signs suggested Murray held the key to confirming or disproving the current life-saving verdict.
This was to be a transient fiction. The house’s appearance began to alter, dripping away like a painting left in the rain. When the illusion was extinguished, he could at last see destitution and the overwhelming evidence of a home gone to waste. There was no light at Manderley any more. No part of its past owner lingered.
The fingers of John’s left hand curled into his palm, halting his typing. He stood from his chair, and poured himself another two fingers. After a fortifying gulp of scotch, John attempted to explain why he had asked anything in the first place.
He didn’t hear any more of this commentary, as he decided to take leave of Wilkes himself. He followed the other man at a similar pace, but Watson was already gone by the time he entered the main hallway. Not that he’d been hoping to catch him. He’d rather avoid more social discomfort than seek it out. He returned to his room, taking the stairs to give himself time to clear his head.
He refused to allow himself to be affected by others. What did it matter how he came across? He preferred his own company; he had no need for the esteem of others. He had his own personal pursuits, and it didn’t matter if others understood them or him. If his fingers of their own accord flipped through the pages to the gossip columns, he of course did not skim them for mentions of a certain name. Before he could find anything of interest, there was a rapping at his door. He opened it to find Wilkes.
He immediately stepped back, closing the door behind him with finality. What was he doing entering dark, unused rooms? What knowledge was to be gained?
“All right, uh, the one with the ginger midget, the one I called the speckled blonde and you groaned, the Chinese acrobat from the circus -”
“John,” Sherlock said, once, an entreaty and a warning in one.
Sherlock flapped his hand in John’s direction.
John rushed to say. That was the last thing he wanted.
“Yes, that would be best laid plans I think,” the Colonel agreed easily, while John turned to Sherlock in suspicion. “Why just the Colonel and I?” he asked.
“You wouldn’t,” John said, straightening his utensil gently. “You’d be cool as a cucumber. Though, probably still somehow manage to offend the judge and the jury.”
Sherlock took some time to gather himself before answering.
Once the transformation was complete, they turned to face John looking mostly human. Specifically like a human man. However, John was not going to be making any assumptions there, as from his very rudimentary understanding of aliens, they did not necessarily align with the human gender construct.
John pressed the scope to her chest and, as she covered her mouth for another coughing fit, her hand brushed against his shirt.
“You’re welcome of course,” John replied to Lestrade, smiling politely. “Though I don’t really do much actual signing, seeing as he never has any interest in what anyone else says.”
“Is it?” John looked closer.
“Because,” John said, “I killed her.”
When Sherlock reached the first outcropping along the crater’s side, John was still several meters above him along the slope, and watched as Sherlock crouched down and gripped the edges of the rock. Sherlock eased themselves along the protrusion’s side, rather than continuing their descent to the bottom of the crater. John followed suit, swinging his body down to where he found Sherlock perched on a narrow ledge at the bottom of the outcropping.
John kissed the trails on his cheeks, and without further ado wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s very hard cock, pulling twice. Sherlock gasped, almost having forgotten how turned on he’d been from their prolonged foreplay, and his eventual enjoyment of being penetrated. John inside of him had been incredibly arousing, occasionally striking upon that spot just right, but it hadn’t been enough, not nearly enough -
over someone?”  Moriarty asked over his shoulder.
“I didn’t mean to imply that, you know I - you must know that I -” John paused, and didn’t continue. John apparently would not be finishing that train of thought.
“How is old Hamish?” Magnussen asked, lowering the cigarette from his mouth.
“Something to look forward to.”
Sherlock was aware that for some the draw of humans and the blood beneath their skin was a constant call, but it had never been like that for him. Even with his own people, he was different. He had never planned to engage in the practice, which made it simple to push from his mind.
The man’s eyes grew heavy-lidded, fingers following John’s along his own neck.
The undercurrent of resentment in his voice was not in any way hidden. The room he was in now was obviously not to the Manderley standard. A lower class room, for him, a lower class person, he imagined.
“'You who swallowed a falling star, o' heartless man,
“Am I?” Moriarty asked, his smile twitching at the corners. Sherlock felt the other man’s madness in that moment like it had its own presence in the room, and realized that he did not honestly know how much Moriarty valued his own life.
The car, of course, eventually came to a stop. The hills of Monte did have an end, and that afternoon there was nowhere further to climb. They had finally reached the summit. Similar to their first outing, they were parked by the edge of a steep vertical slope, with the distance between them and the sea (he estimated) being two thousand feet, give or take.
“Good-bye Mr Magnussen,” he said, rather than make any false promises.
Or so they did, until the hero of the story kissed the heroine, causing Sherlock to drop into silence and, when John looked sideways at him, complete stillness. John was almost relieved when Sherlock started talking again shortly after, of course to provide a rapid fire explanation of how the pyrotechnics in the background had been triggered.
But after that, sleep evaded him. John thought of Sherlock, curled up in the chair outside, and tossed and turned.
“I wanted to do this with you,” John said, answering Sherlock’s question from earlier, which was apparently enough to make Sherlock shudder beneath his hands. “I thought about taking the clever detective who was above it all, and peeling back the cool exterior. I thought about—making a mess of him.”
Sherlock turned back, and rolled their eyes when they saw the direction of his gaze. “I only transferred enough to reform the bone! It was hardly anything.”
“Funny?” John repeated in confusion. “No, Sherlock, Christ  – how would that have been funny?”
> Till your next question tomorrow, then ;-)
“It doesn’t, never mind,” he said, but John was already miles away.
“You’re a very bad man,” Sherlock murmured as the first button came undone.
John drew back, lips pursed. Sherlock wasn’t sure if it was a trick of the eye, but he thought John might have mouthed ‘heterosexual’ under his breath.
Humour, again, John Watson’s favoured approach to many situations.
He was comforted by the fact that at least John was painfully bored with his duties, and would obviously have much rather been doing anything else.
After a beat, John relaxes.
Oi. Now who’s teasing who?
And continued to sleep downstairs.
,” Sherlock snapped, hunger getting the better of him. (
“So you’re him then?” John asked, thinking that he did not seem as soulless as described. “The one everyone’s so afraid of, ‘Wizard Holmes’?”
Sherlock’s half-baked idea might actually work. John stepped forward with the intention of besmirching Sherlock’s fake name, followed by a quick exit.
“There’ll be some curiosity, of course,” John commented. “They’ve probably all been talking about this ever since they heard the news. But you only have to be yourself.”
John nodded for a moment, before returning to his chair, and his paper.
The sound of being connected to his next video call dashed that hope to pieces.
That makes Sherlock’s eyebrows draw together and his eyes get that baby blue, watery look, and John feels like a right bastard. This is why, a voice says, this is why he won’t tell you. Trust. You still don’t believe that things have changed, that it’s not the same as it has been in the past, and you let him down like that. John doesn’t mean to. He loves him. John loves Sherlock, and if Sherlock wants a bedtime story, by God, he’ll get one.
John was out on this limb because the only break from the pain he’d had since his return had been the brief time spent in Wizard Holmes’ presence, and he wasn’t about to pass up the chance for a night of sleep.
He pressed his foot into the handle of Watson’s forgotten cane, causing it to snap up into the palm of his hand in a move he hoped looked smooth.
Had Watson said brilliant?
Watson spoke to his horse, and with a small pressure exerted with his heels, they were off down the forest path the same way Sherlock had been headed. At perhaps the last possible moment available to them, Sherlock remembered why he had not escaped by horse.
He knew exactly where to go, and where to turn. Subconsciously he had been preparing himself for this moment, anticipating the floor plan. He quickly reached a broad landing with another staircase. The wing itself was silent, and rather dark. He sniffed the air - there was no lingering smell of dust from the carpet being swept, a smell he associated with the staff having been through an area recently. No staff, no sound, and no light – all very unusual. The entire hall reminded him of a deserted mausoleum, as though the actual owners had been long away.
It was news to him that Watson had his own theory.
“Doctor Murray,” Sherlock greeted crisply, “our servant Lestrade rang ahead to warn you of our arrival?”
Sherlock swept past John and the fireplace, heading for the table. With his arms stretched out over the wood, Sherlock unfolded the slip of paper. At once, it turned to smoke in his fingers, and the sound of a woman moaning echoed through the room.
“For John,” Moriarty whispered. “What wouldn’t you do for John? You think the little mixup with the party is all I’ll do to him? As long as you’re here, I promise you, I’ll make sure he never forgets. And I barely have to lift a finger, because you’re already doing it for me. You can see that, can’t you? Your presence is slowly destroying him.”
“Sorry,” John murmurs, looking away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about? The guest that came?” John asked, that strange look in his eyes.
The sound of the man’s laughter was lovely, even though it was barely audible, mostly seen rather than heard through the shaking of his shoulders. His chin dipped down from the force of it, forming creases along his neck.
John cupped the bathwater in his palms, and spilled it over Sherlock’s head, sluicing the goo from his still ginger hair. When John rubbed soap into his hair and washed it out, the black colour began to return. It struck John then that, perhaps, Sherlock’s tantrum hadn’t been about hair at all.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, kissing him sweetly.
Archie was pressed to Mrs Hudson’s leg, expression avid, though fearful, entranced by Sherlock’s oozing. Whispered into Mrs Hudson’s skirt, he said, “I haven’t seen him like this since—”
But now, he thought of John approaching a beach, the police lifting a sheet. John having to look for a very long time because it was hard, very hard, so much of her had been taken away by the sea. However, there would still be the things someone who knew her well could see, the resemblance would be there hanging about the corpse, in the shape of her jaw perhaps...
John trailed off, swallowing. He took a moment, and then using both hands, mimed a spreading motion.
“Perhaps you will gather what happens next if we review the details of the case,” Sherlock prompted, the activities of their past week returning to him as if they had never left. How strange that he should have forgotten.
“Sherlock – “ he starts. The dark hair is -
John made to pull away from him, the hold on his hand loosening. John wanted to stride away through the trees faster than before, leaving this all behind. It was so like John to finally voice his dark thoughts, and then to turn away from the words as if they wouldn’t catch him.
John was smiling against him. Smiling. Was it the good kind of smiling, or the mocking kind of smiling?
> No.
“Good boy,” Moriarty praised, and twirled in a small circle with the still opened cannister. “Good thing Johnny took such good notes on that one, hmm?”
“When was the morning-room furnished as it is now?” he asked slowly.
Except, John went to bed inebriated enough to be restless, unable to stop imagining what voice might murmur,
John knew the second he was spotted, as the creature reared back, as if slapped. John stayed still in the chair, hand reaching out for his cane, forgetting he had lost it on the moor.
John had been in there for over three minutes, which had seemed excruciatingly long at the time, while Sherlock was being forced to watch steam fog the frosted glass of the ensuite toilet door. Which had been left unlocked. It was practically an invitation.
It’s sweet. Bedtime stories. It’s worse than sweet, actually, it’s adorable. But first, John has his back up a little. He remembers Sherlock’s commentaries on his blog posts, after all. Is this so you can take the piss?
Well, that had been a faked relationship though, hadn’t it? Probably getting a bit of her own back, good on you Janine. Probably all drivel.
And now John was expected to stay indefinitely, or at least until the main base decided he could return.
“Well,” Wilkes began, his voice dry and hard, and not at all how he had spoken to John. “You work fast don’t you. I have to hand it to you, how ever did you manage it?”
The Captain cleared his throat awkwardly. “What wretched English weather we’re having!” he remarked, waving as if to indicate the light drizzle. Sherlock rolled his eyes beneath his eyelids. The man wanted to talk about the weather while they waited for the discussion between John, the doctor, and the inspector to finish. Just a few meters away from them was a shipwreck and the corpse found within it. Sherlock was truly being tested.
Sherlock didn’t look up from his bunsen burner. “That wasn’t me, that was Mrs Hudson.”
Ah, Watson also smiled when he was angry - if gritted teeth and pulled back lips counted as smiling. Even Sebastian could feel the dig of that response, but was miraculously still able to laugh and brush it aside.
, John thought to himself.
“Oh, that can wait. Their first attempt failed and they’ll need to regroup. That’ll be twenty-ninth on our list of things to do,” Sherlock informed him primly.
Shortly, everyone would know that it was Mary’s body in the sailboat. The diver, the Captain, the harbourmaster, the coast guard… The news would spread like wildfire. Possibly in a few hours, but certainly by the next morning, everyone would know that Mary was not currently in the family crypt. It would be in the papers. John was right in that they didn’t have much time.
“For God’s sake, stop fussing with your hair in the mirror and make yourself useful!”
“I’m Wilkes’ companion,” he said, apropos of nothing. Watson had been curious about that after all.
“The bot doesn’t have hands or feet, John!” Sherlock snapped. “It’s a bot.”
He’s wearing an absolutely hideous jumper. To his place of work. This is the kind of man who thinks growing a moustache might look dignified and needs to be told explicitly to never have that thought ever again. (Oh God, what if he grew a moustache?) Sherlock has warring urges to both dress him and encourage him to never change. Women probably overlook him when he dresses like their grandfather. He attracts less attention this way. Otherwise, a veteran doctor? With his looks? He’d be beating them off with a stick.
John found he was more shocked by the man genuinely smiling at him for perhaps the first time in their conversation than he was by the question itself, which was absolutely the wrong way around.
Their continued acquaintance was uncomplicated, and by neither man’s design. They simply met each day on the terrace or in the hotel lobby, and would carry on from there. Their conversations seemed to never end, even when they drifted into companionable silence. Nothing had ever been more natural than to move from one place to the next, without prior discussion or thought on the hows and whys of their amusements.
“— and we can go as slowly as you want. We’ll need to be married to return together, but we don’t have to – we don’t have to be man and husband. Right away. I know that it’s all a lot, and too soon.”
John burst into a fit of giggles, and he found himself chuckling along as well.
The bots’ main purpose was to search for natural resources, with their secondary function to map out the area around the planet’s base. The secondary purpose had become their main over time, as they hadn’t met with much success in finding anything of use on BAK 2212. To John, the whole endeavour seemed to only grow more costly and unnecessary as time continued, but the project still hadn’t been pulled.
He reminded himself that his observations and deductions put people off and that explaining them in full would only cause awkwardness, or worse, offence.
“It can have, if you like,” Watson replied, eyes sad.
“Oh?” John prodded, turning completely away from his desk in his excitement. “Are you going to send an anonymous tip to the police again?”
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling. He wanted to look at anything other than John stumbling his way through this. “We don’t have to say the word if you’d prefer, John. And yes, that is exactly what I’m suggesting. Or rather, what I am telling you.”
Thanks, as always, to my beta Solitary_Endeavor !
Lestrade suggested he return to the house with him for breakfast, but he refused. He knew that when John came back, John wouldn’t waste any time returning to the house. John would come straight back to the wreck.
Perhaps due to the extreme enui Sherlock had been experiencing at the time, he had devised a scheme for luring the thief out of hiding. Stamford was to act as if he had not yet noticed the item missing, and to invite a party of guests to his home
“It’s possible they won’t be able to raise the boat at all,” Sherlock said offhandedly, grasping for anything to say in comfort. “And in that case, we won’t even need be concerned about what the body might tell them.” That she had been shot and killed by a bullet, for example, he thought but did not say.
John, still slow and careful, was now approaching him in his new spot. When Sherlock extended his wings and shook the elastic skin, John took a step back with a hand outstretched in front him. “It’s all right,” John murmured, “It’s okay, bat. I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I’m not fitting in here, am I?” he asked. “And they can tell. The servants can, and the people who come here and look me up and down as though I were a prize cow.”
), which then meant he needed take a shower, mid-day, when Sherlock normally had unlimited access to him.
First a goat, now Jesus. Are you sure you’re in love with me?
> ???
Watson paused again. His eyes never strayed from looking straight ahead. It seemed easier for him to deliver this speech as if it were a monologue, spoken for no one else to hear.
“Abandoned cottage, clearly at the end of the path Gladstone is used to taking,” he continued, as if deducing one of the patrons at their old hotel. “Been let go to waste, I wonder why?”
Why not pick someone else for your good deed of the day?”
He raised a brow at that - was Moriarty really so good, that he was well known to the visitors?
John is unable to resist beaming back at him, with an expression that is likely overly fond. But he’s allowed to look as fond as he wants, it doesn’t matter now if he gives it away. Sometimes he forgets that, it’s still all very new, he’s still settling into it.  Some days he can hardly believe that Sherlock is his. Well. His boyfriend, he supposes, though they have never discussed labels.
better, shall we say, than anything poor old John has.” He pulled the cigarette from his mouth to lick at his lips. “Tell me, Mr Watson, do you always moisturize your hands with massage oil in the mornings?”
“Her boat,” Lestrade replied simply.
“A heart,” John said while pointing at it. “There’s a real heart on the table.”
Did he turn back? No, he was already too far into the room, meaning Watson had seen him by now.
“Yeah, because you told me to!” John’s exasperation with him was growing, which was rather uncalled for, seeing as John was the one being surprising.
Manderley, as he had predicted, could not be saved from the damage inflicted by the fire. The house had been reduced to bleak sections of its outside structure, a ghost of its former self. If there had been a body buried within the wreckage, there would exist no evidence of it beyond ash.
The first book was only the beginning. Sherlock proceeded to give all the books in the Hudson’s library the same treatment while John watched them work, thankful for the company.
“The other servants will be back now,” Moriarty called, the unassuming helper once again.
“Jesus, Sherlock! Don’t shoot it, for God’s sake!” John cried out, pulling the gun away from Sherlock’s loose hold. Sherlock released it without resistance, but pouted after as if John had taken away a new toy.
And with that, she stepped out the door.
We can’t keep meeting like this, John says. This is when they usually start to meet again, the other little thems. What Sherlock always wants now is the story. He just needs to remember what he learned about the ugly duckling.
‘He must know’. He supposed he likely did know, as he knew most things. John had been unsure if he could make a new marriage work. He would have to convince John that he could, but not against John’s wishes. How was it that something so intangible could cause such an acute physical pain?
John took in the view with nothing but appreciation. Sherlock’s cock, as it turned out, appeared very much the same as John’s, though smaller. Perhaps the arms were already demanding most of Sherlock’s mass, or maybe Sherlock had difficulty maintaining the shape and appearance any larger than it was. It occurred to John that Sherlock was mimicking him, as always, and that sneaking in to see John that one night might have been for this exact purpose.
“Shit!” John said, clutching his chest. “I’d forgotten all about you.”
Their tone was angry, but the part of their face that John could still see was blazing gold, glowing even in the fully lit room. John’s heart kicked to one side in his chest.
The man’s shoes were nearly silent as he moved across the floor, as if he had planned ahead to avoid the sound of a heavier sole.
“Me, too,” John said, squeezing his leg, and then feeling like an idiot, “I mean it’s all like a dream, for me as well.”
He couldn’t stand the defeat in John’s tone. “The game is never over, John.”
“Ah, Mr Sampson, I see you got my note.”
“It’s all one and the same,” she said, pointing to the door behind him. John turned to see there was a diamond-shaped knob by it, with four different coloured segments. An arrow was currently pointed to the green coloured part of the knob. “Facades and bolt holes, but this is the real place.”
“I don't know what you mean,” he said slowly. “Good afternoon.”
Watson’s jaw dropped slightly before shaking his head ruefully. It was now the woman who was all but forgotten in the hallway.
John huffed a laugh. “I mean the film. You didn’t like it.”
“I’ll look it up and see if it sparks my memory, will that make you happy?” Harry pulled out her mobile, quick on the draw, her thumbs already moving over the keys.
They passed beneath a tunnel of flowers, the whole area beyond picturesque, till they suddenly reached a cove. The difference in atmosphere was dramatic - behind them was the valley, azaleas and trees, and ahead there was the sea breaking hard on the shore and white shingle. He could see now why Harry had never swam here. The beach wasn’t overly inviting.
“It’s a pity you don’t ride or shoot,” Harry said, speaking to him once again. “You miss out on so much. You don’t sail by any chance do you?”
And John would be unable to conceal his temper, his anger. He would be completely incapable of dodging a direct question, and of lying about it. The whole room would know in an instant that John had hated his late wife, giving him both motive and opportunity for murder.
He was truly in too deep.
“I’m sorry,” John said, and his voice was wrecked with true emotion. “I know I’ve done this all wrong. I’ve asked you the wrong way. I told you the other day, I don’t know what to do with you.”
And, John had in fact noticed that Sherlock’s additional arms did not make a reappearance.  He’d actually found it strange, given that less arms seemed to slow down Sherlock’s reading.
“We don’t know anything yet,” John said, moving closer to the window to look outside. The fog still hadn’t lifted. There was no wind, and none coming. The sea would be perfectly calm for the diver the next morning.
> No questions today?
Lestrade looked between them with a soft smile. “You’ll also have to choose a costume. Once you decide, we can order it from London.”
“First a wife and now this,” Watson said, still disgruntled. “Are you certain you are quite well?”
Sherlock’s hands were still on him, and the top of Sherlock’s coveralls was still off, bunched around their waist. John wondered how desperate for contact a man had to be to interpret being touched through a suit as sensual.
He was overwhelmed with all that they weren’t saying. And ever since he’d seen the West rooms, he couldn’t help but wonder - were the rooms kept like that, untouched, unchanged as if Mary had never left, under John’s orders? Did John ever go there, like Moriarty, to touch the dressing gown over the back of the chair, or the brushes on the dressing table, or to peer into the wardrobe doors, and at the nightgown on that bed? And was this why John let Moriarty get away with whatever he wanted, an agreement between them, an understanding - Moriarty had been Mary’s man, after all.
Not a visitor, but also not a tradesperson. They knew to go around the back way, by the old stables and the garage. It was also not anyone’s car who had visited before. He’d memorized every make and model for identification purposes. Besides, most people in the county didn’t drive sports cars.
For a moment, he felt the unwelcome and ill-advised desire to tell John about Magnussen. The things Magnussen had said to him, and the things he’d implied. Magnussen kissing his hand, and alluding to more.
He supposed at some point he would have to acknowledge being spoken to, but not just yet. Rather than reply, he lay down across an armchair, curling his feet up onto the seat. Staff was swarming the room, likely judging his sitting position, but he couldn’t be bothered to care.
John hadn’t known Sherlock’s mortality was a bit more robust than that, but the gesture had been... inspiring. Sherlock had needed to keep John, right away, and had needed to be near him as much as he was able. Living together was essential, and wasn’t nearly enough. Sherlock still felt the urge to check in on John during their brief moments of separation, and he had a poor track record for resisting urges.
“And how do I hold up?” John asked. His tongue ducked out from behind his lips to lick at the corner of his mouth. Though he couldn’t recall when, he had assumed parade’s rest.
“What are you doing now?” Colonel Barclay asked. By Sherlock’s estimation, the man considered the situation handled.
John’s focus on him was more inquisitive than he was used to. What John sought to find, he didn’t know.
“Uh, John, what are you– christ, have you and him swapped personalities?” Greg asks, now really looking at John like he’s lost it but also not stopping him from continuing his assault on the frankly awful decor. If Sherlock was here, he’d have snarkily commented that removing the wallpaper was doing the homeowner a favour.
John settled in Market Chipping, by chance rather than choice, where he didn’t know a soul. Even if he had known anyone, the mirror was a constant reminder that they would not have recognized him, as his recent trials had left him aged beyond his years. At first, John wasn’t sure he would last long in the town. There was nowhere for him to live besides the temporary lodgings intended for travelers, and work for a wounded man invalided from war was scarce.
An intriguing servant, to be sure. Irish, but had obviously immigrated to England young. He was from the country clearly but liked to hide it, preferred the city, resenting his rural upbringing. For his class, he had moved up quite quickly, already the obvious overseer of one of the oldest and greatest homes in Britain. Rather impressive, considering. His appearance was fastidious, he took care with his clothing. This was standard with servants, but this one in particular liked to look smart, coveted the articles. He obviously had connections in the city, judging by the new cufflinks. He was very probably up to date on London fashion.
“Simple. You are obviously now master of Manderley, which means you likely were always in line to inherit. You merely thought you’d had more time before taking over. You mentioned earlier that you have a sibling. A brother, Harry Watson – the name was stitched into the handkerchief in your suit pocket, presumably you borrowed it and never returned it. However, Harry was deemed ill-suited for the task. Possibly due to his excessive drinking, judging by the stains on that same handkerchief.”
“You are my best friend,” John began, “it’s not ‘supposed’, and – Wait. No,
Moriarty leaned down close to his ear, staring at him through the mirror. “
He had to make John interpret his silence as fatigue. John couldn’t know he was dreading their arrival at Manderley.
“Oh lord, something scandalous then I hope?”
“I only mind it all because of you,” John murmured. “This has changed you. Maybe for the better, but maybe for the worse. You used to be so brash and careless, in your own funny way, and now -”
. You were the best distraction I’ve had in awhile, I’ll give you that, but now,
“What’s all this?” John motions to his morning offerings.
Watson leaned forward, his forefinger wagging at him. “Ah Holmes, you forget! She married the Colonel before learning that he had been the cause of her previous lover’s long time away at sea. She very likely holds a grudge.”
It was in fact currently occupied by one John H. Watson.
“With that in mind, does it not seem peculiar that not only were the seacocks open, but holes had been driven into the bottom of the boat?”
“You like it,” John stated. “You eat honey because you like it.”
And that at least was true. It was only that being with John caused a variety of extreme emotions. He understood this was not unique to him, but characteristic of people in love.
It was likely this thought that led John to be distracted as he eased himself out onto the narrow ledge, causing him to be unable to avoid the oncoming collision with a large blue boulder.
—only to kiss that sharp cheekbone, the crease above the keen eyes, and the soft line of the jaw. Sherlock accepted each one with an expression of awe. Sherlock looked how John felt, and it made him
Watson was quicker, and arrived at the perfect time to trip the sprinting bellhop, causing him to fall flat on his face in the hotel hallway. Watson pulled the young man up off the floor while a woman and several staff caught up.
“I suppose I’ll just have to pay you back with interest, Mr Watson,” John replied, nipping at Sherlock’s bottom lip as he withdrew.
He passed through the door he had often eyed from afar at the head of the stairs to find himself looking down a long corridor. As he had assumed from judgments made from the outside of the house, it was similar to the East wing. Or it would have been, if not for the dark paneling along its walls and its wider, grander size. As he passed to the other side of the door he realized his usual shadow, Gladstone, would not follow after him.
“Dr Davenshaw, even working as a vet only part-time, this house is somewhat below your income bracket, a one floor house that’s clearly been renovated more than once, I would say exactly three times, with the cost likely outweighing the benefit. It’s not near where you work, so one must assume sentiment. Emotionally attached to the house itself?” he asks as he abruptly turns, startling Dr Davenshaw.
Had Mary honestly put her damn name on everything?
Having confirmed that Sherlock’s wound was well cared for, and that Sherlock was not in a chatting mood, John clapped the back of the chair one last time. “I’m for bed, I think.”
He didn’t, but he didn’t step back either. John cleared his throat. “Yes, I made it back fine with those boots you brought me. I got a dog too.”
He slid down the rocks as gracefully as he could, though the man only took note of him once he’d stepped onto the pebbled beach. The stranger had an unkempt beard and manic eyes, and looked a bit like an idiot.
> Like petting a cat?
Sherlock sighed. “Mrs Hudson keeps taking the skull away.”
not - actually desire his company.
speak before, but I—” William paused, obviously frustrated, searching for the right words. “I made myself forget, so I could know other things.”
David looked very pleased indeed. “We’ll meet at the doctor’s address tomorrow at the same time. And Barclay will follow you in another car on your drive down, so you don’t get any funny ideas.”
he signed.
He wasn’t related in any conceivable way to anyone involved—how would anyone trace it back to him? Impossible circumstances made for perfect murders.
“He’s gay,” John said, perhaps harshly, and without thinking. “Or at least, he might be. I don't know. It doesn't matter.”
John directs his attention back to Dr Davenshaw. “So these are keepsakes then, of the ones your husband used to leave you?”
Sherlock, embarrassed, could only mutter “nonsense” beneath his breath. A beat passed, Sherlock too affected by Watson’s words to further comment.
The perfume bottles were, at the very least, out of date to his own sample collection. He went to inspect the brushes next to them, and caught sight of his own face in the glass. He looked pale and worn, and the curls of his fringe were lying flat. He hated when his hair lost its volume. He reached for a comb, before realizing what he was doing. Even though she was long gone, her presence was thick in the room, hovering over every possession. None of these things were his.
Sherlock met resistance from the arm he had been holding, John bringing their walking to another stop. John eyed the door above them, and looked around, confirming they were quite alone. “I’m sorry,” John said, gripping his arm. “For all of this. I wish you didn’t need to worry yourself over what the jury will think and how this inquest will go -”
Maybe it was hearing Sherlock’s voice for the first time, surprised by the deep timbre of it in contrast to how young the man looked, or perhaps it was listening to Sherlock’s delivery rather than reading it on the page. Either way, John let out the highest giggle he had at his disposal, and had to quickly duck back into the narrow side street from whence he’d come to hide in case Sherlock had heard him. By the time John stuck his head back out, the cab and Sherlock were gone.
He went to stand next to John, and perhaps to counter Harry’s earlier look, he took hold of John’s arm.
It was always a case.
I don’t like this. It isn’t true.
“Here’s to sentiment!” Moriarty cried, striking the match and throwing it in the air. Sherlock had less than two seconds (exactly 1 second 89 milliseconds) to dive from his current position near the dressing table into the ante room to avoid the ensuing blaze. Sherlock skidded across the floor with several milliseconds to spare, and thankful for his long coat, as the fire roared behind him. He had a short moment to watch as the sheer curtains disintegrated, before he was chased from the ante room by the spreading fire.
Once the police arrived, one body was brought out on a stretcher, and the other on his own two feet. John approached the newly erected yellow tape line to get a closer look. Paramedics dealt with Sherlock briefly, and the man John had recognised as Lestrade from the press conference was talking to Sherlock, who sat on the back of an ambulance. Just as John decided he no longer had even a flimsy excuse to stay watching on, Sherlock’s eyes met his across the crime scene.
A sequence of hops seemed to suggest the scarecrow agreed.
John something.
“Jesus
“That was before you had seen me.”
It was just a glitch with this group of bots, John supposed. He wasn’t about to become paranoid.
This caused the Colonel to again turn his attention to John in surprise, and consideration. Sherlock didn’t like that look at all.
Oh God, John thought. What if he had managed to read this entire situation wrong?
True to her word, the dark-haired man reappeared on John’s screen.
He had grown to consider Lestrade an ally. Even if Lestrade was reporting on him to his brother. He might have ruined that tentative relationship with this conversation. He wondered if Lestrade had been absolutely loyal to her. She likely would have been worthy of it.
Rated M (for now..?) for John being a horndog during the goo tantrum
John would rather not say.
He slid back down the stairs to the library, eager to see John, and suss out that queer conversation.
“Dinner? It’s 9am.”
“I’m meant to call you turnip head rather than vegetable head, according to Sherlock,” John told it, though it seemed to not care either way.
“He’s actually told me nothing at all,” Captain Watson answered, with a genial look to Stamford, and a stern look his way. It might have sounded like reproof, but the cant of his lips gave him away. Watson was amused by him, which somehow made everything that much more thrilling.
John sighed, before clicking accept on his computer screen.
> Any more cases on the horizon?
“Sherlock,” John said, firm, but caring. “We did not go back to Baker Street because you passed out in the car like you did on the plane. Please tell me you remember anything that has happened in the last few hours.”
John began, feeling the need to at least set the stage, for God’s sake.
“I'm very fond of Manderley,” he replied tightly, staring straight ahead where he knew Magnussen’s car was covered. He would show Magnussen out, and would not respond more than necessary to any comments.
may have said on the subject, John could often tell from Sherlock’s face if he was fibbing.
It felt like an age passed before he returned to himself. A part of Sherlock had left his body to float up into the fog. Another part was still stuck in a continuous loop of newly acquired information – Mary’s body had just been found. John had killed Mary. John had hated Mary. Mary had not been who she had seemed. John could be discovered as the murderer at any moment. John loved him. John had married him loving him. John had always cared for him, with both small and large gestures. John had caught his release in a handkerchief, and was now using it to gently clean him off. They were lying on the damp ground of the Happy Valley, crushing the azaleas, and he would have to solve this all, somehow.
John was breathing heavily and murmuring,
Something new, something interesting, that’s all he needed. Maybe a quick game of deductions. But of what?
“I’m afraid I don’t have one. Perhaps you’d like to do it for me?” Watson asked.
“Do you mind?” Sherlock asked, turning sharply towards him, despite his intention to not be distracted. “Maybe you hadn’t noticed John, but I’m actually sort of
Another discovery he made, which he was less than thrilled about, was that his brother had wasted no time in seeking out a new spy. His dear older brother was clearly trying to make up for his previous negligence in keeping an eye on him.
“Hey, hey,” John said, moving further into the room. “It’s our room, you can leave things out however you like. Which you still haven’t said, how do you like it?”
There was no denying it. Sherlock was
> Till then.
Sherlock had not included a photo of himself in the email—subject line “Details”—and so John had braved the tube and arrived at the suggested meeting spot in the hopes of seeing the real thing himself.
Unlike Wilkes, John Watson rose to his feet at once in greeting. This was especially gracious, given that he used a cane to assist himself in standing.
“Well sir, you are correct,” Watson said with a dip of his head. “I suppose you inferred it the same way you thought out how to catch the men accosting you on the road?”
Sherlock didn’t return for the rest of the day, and Archie had left after dropping off the mail. John and Mrs Hudson had said their goodbyes to him, as they expected with the conscription, they wouldn’t be seeing him again for quite some time.
“Did Mrs Watson have enemies?” Colonel Barclay asked the room at large. “Money-lenders, blackmailers?” John seemed only able to shake his head, and David was at a complete loss.
“While I do enjoy a tricky curse,” Sherlock evaded, “I can’t make bricks without clay. I don’t have enough information at present.”
____________
Watson looked as though he would have gone further, but stopped short when he glanced directly at him. He realized his cheeks were flushed in shame from Wilkes’ behaviour, and that Watson must have noticed. If he’d been more assured in himself, he and Watson could have shared a laugh at Sebastian’s expense. He could have bonded with him in that moment, both of them derisive of Sebastian, but instead he was mortified.
Though Watson’s hand was in his lap, he could still see that it spasmed based on the tension in Watson’s upper arm. This was the exact moment when he remembered that he had seen Manderley before, from a postcard. He couldn’t quite reconcile the striking image of the grand estate with Watson’s reaction, even if the place did remind Watson of his late wife.
, in matching ensembles.
“Why do I get the feeling that I will be judged based on my choice?”
“Oh, sorry, I’ve just - why didn’t you say anything?” John asked, both apologetic and bemused, while walking towards him.
, his mind supplied, and the shiver that ran through Sherlock’s frame made John feel as if they had shared the same thought.
Watson laughed grimly.
The boy was young, though old enough to be recruited into his Irregulars, if they had met under different circumstances. He was sure he would have done so in fact, as the boy was quite good at faking an injured leg, though not well enough to fool him.
“The bots aren’t exactly sentient, they can’t really communicate at all,” John explained. “Those noises are them, uh, moving about. Inside.”
“Well, there’s only one thing to be done then,” he remarked.
“You want me to get out, got it,” Lestrade replied easily. Lestrade shot him one last parting look that was sympathetic, while also seeming to beg him to not mess anything up further, before closing the door behind him.
"The bishop's wife wants to know when we are going to give a fancy dress ball at Manderley,” he said, watching for Lestrade’s reaction from the corner of his eye.  “She came to the last one, she said. I hadn’t known about the fancy dress dances here, and couldn’t comment.”
He reached behind himself to place a comforting hand on Gladstone’s head, which Gladstone pressed up into.
“Holmes,” Sherlock replied. “Sherlock Holmes. And yes, there is somewhere, though there will be no need to go out of your way. Our destination is the same.”
He had taken up smoking again, though he suspected that had more to do with the occasional looks from John, and their significant lack of follow-up. Now that he’d concluded his business with Mrs Hudson he would only be agitated again.
Lestrade winced at the volume of his voice, but otherwise appeared to be more relieved by his show of emotion than anything else.
John laughed out loud once, turning his head away to muffle the sound, but Sherlock could tell his heart wasn’t truly in it.
“What? Us in the bath together?” John asked, his voice dropping several pitches.
He was grateful for his lack of shame when John rushed back to him at once, one hand holding his hip, the other reaching to touch the back of his neck. John guided his head down towards him once more and Sherlock allowed himself to be pulled, unresisting. He was ready this time, and when John’s lips finally touched his again, he kissed back with everything he had.
At the door, Sherlock’s mouth stretched wide into a cheshire cat smile, with no resemblance to the one John had seen grace his face earlier. One arm fell straight down along his side, while the other knocked with command. Presumably, they were on the case. John peered back at the window. Perhaps there was a dead body inside, or markings on the wall in blood, or—
In a panic, he began stripping off his nightshirt and rushed for the water basin in the corner. The doorknob was rattling.
“You?” Sherlock said, shocked, and then, not at all. “You killed Mary. But
Suddenly, the trees began to thin, and the shrubbery receded, and they were passing within blood-red walls. This was momentarily very distracting, and he leaned over the side of the car to look closer. “Like them?” John asked, smiling.
John repeated the motion. Sherlock sighed.
Not afraid of anything. Had the woman been perfect? In every aspect of her character? Brave, cunning, organized, capable, graceful -
“There’s no figure to name,” John replied, struggling to keep his tone cordial, “because I don’t know anything.” As Sherlock reminded him daily.
John eyed the mechanism by the door, not sure he understood. “I suppose you can’t break my curse then?”
This smart arse.
“Since you called me John at the falls.” Watson’s frown deepened. “If it is too familiar, I understand—”
This would absolutely not do.
He called for Gladstone one for time, before giving up and moving on to the only other option available, the boat house. Though whether he would find anything of use in there was doubtful. There had once been a garden, that had now been let go, judging by the overgrown grass and distinct lack of flowers. The windows had also been boarded up. He assumed the door would be locked, and planned to pick it, though it opened with surprising ease. Due to the low-ceiling, he had to bend to fit through the door.
“And what made it capsize?”
“We’ve just been told that the boat had been purposefully damaged, Mr Watson, and that with the seacocks open and holes drilled into its sides, it would have sunk in a matter of minutes. I think we can agree that rules out the possibility of earlier damage, as the boat would have already sunk before Mrs Watson went sailing. Do you agree?”
“Ms Watson!” he said, “I had not realized.”
John thought the Royal Wizard would see through it regardless. “Who am I, then?”
“Fine, fine! If it’s necessary, perhaps you would see about it for me,” he said while avoiding Moriarty's direct gaze. “Some young boy looking for training.”
“Waiting? You mean, for me to find him?” John’s confusion only grows. “Wait, how did you know there was a him, I haven’t told you why I’ve come.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that. John was aware that the service sometimes got weirdo callers. He also knew it was well within his rights to request that the client put on some clothes before going any further, and that other interpreters would have likely passed the call off right away.
Which was immensely convenient, as he knew exactly where he needed to go. He walked across the well worn carpet of the hotel lobby, passing where John had once caught a runaway bellhop, beneath the high ceiling and decorations he had once thought vacuous, and into the lift. Without direction, it began ascending till it eventually jerked to a stop at John’s old floor.
And John couldn’t argue with that. “Well, just let me know when you want your bed back.”
He walked past John, taking three long strides to stand in the center of the room as John closed the door behind him. He kept his back turned.
“Someone who wanted Mary out of the picture, the well connected partner in your duo,” Sherlock murmured, and Moriarty he noticed bristled, just slightly. “Linked to your animosity and interest in me from the outset - a strange coincidence even I will admit, though perhaps there is no such thing.”
Sherlock hadn’t fed in days and, as per his routine, he had slipped into his room to choke down the cold bag from his mini-fridge. He had only managed three long sips through his straw before the door to his bedroom was forced open, and John’s face was peeking through at him.
“Not much security for a wizard,” John commented, looking back at the living scarecrow. Rain was soaking its long coat, but it was too tall to come inside with him. “Thanks? I suppose,” John said over his shoulder. “Hop off if I don’t ever come back out.”
He took care to never err again by mentioning Watson’s home, but still endeavoured to amaze Watson with his insights. He aimed to surprise, but not to offend.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured. “No. I might have, but I’m back now.”
“God, yes,” Captain Watson said at once, nearly out of breath. “But what do you mean? What thieves?”
While John realized the difference in their ages was not exceptionally large, he still sometimes felt as if he had a burdened a bright young thing with an old man, barely even able to walk. This was especially pronounced in John’s mind when Sherlock’s face lit up in boyish excitement over his experiments, or when his face was softened in sleep, sweetly framed by dark curls splayed out over his pillow. But then, there were also Sherlock's sly glances when John came out after a bath or climbed into bed with him at night, and the way Sherlock still yearned for John’s praise and attention for his work.
“Might have been,” John replied, lowering his gaze to the tiled floor.
John rubbed his brow with one hand, and leaned on his cane with the other. John’s face seemed concerned, though he couldn’t imagine why.
There was a brief moment of silence on the other end of the line. “Mr Watson, would you like to approve the menu for today?”
As a side note, originally I had this end more like [gossip girl voice] spotted: lonely boy seen locking lips with angry short demon man on deck- but, this is better, anyway I just wanted you to know Sherlock is wearing the pink tunic ensemble in my mind. Thanks for coming out to talk my ted.
“More sophisticated,” he recovered. “A social butterfly, she said.” He politically left out the rest of the implication.
Sherlock kisses his nose. We were always together.
He groaned, exasperated. “You acted like a deeply heart-broken man, pining after a love that could no longer be returned! I thought you were constantly reminded of her here, and were always comparing me to her, and thinking how unlike each other we were.”
” The man was going to kill him.
“Did you know the master used to brush her hair for her?” Moriarty murmured, as if reading his mind. “I’d come to the door to help her, and here Mr Watson would be, in his shirt sleeves, running a brush through her hair.”
If Molly hadn’t been looking right at him, John might have given into the urge to smack his head against the side of his desk. Why did it have to be him?
John wasn’t sure what to say to that. He settled for, “Oh?”
the man signed, apparently now interested in being an active participant in the proceedings.
“How strange that the famous painting of Mrs Watson never made it here,” Lady Norton said over her shoulder, her sharp eyes piercing him for a moment. “A great huntress, I understand. Do you ride Mr Watson?”
This could easily be their last night together. Or one of their last nights. Who knew what tomorrow would bring. John must have thought the same, given that he’d been reluctant to let Sherlock out of his sight, even to take a bath.
This was a pleasant change of topic, thought he imagined Harry might be able to twist his answer any way she liked. “No,” he said. “We had no time, with John anxious to get home to settle his business. But I’ve ordered some new things from catalogues.”
He would endeavour to be what John needed of him, even if it meant his own heartache.
When he didn’t immediately answer, the phone buzzed in his hand another three times in rapid succession—alarmingly quick, considering the length of each message.
John was staring at him, reproachfully. John was capable of saying more with a look than there were words in the English language.
“Yes, when you spoke with Moriarty, that doesn’t matter right now,” he said, rifling through the desk for a blank page. “Either you write down everything so I can remember it, and then we burn it, or we wait to talk later in our bedroom. Which would you prefer?”
The next few days, which quickly turned into weeks, passed in a pleasant blur. Wilkes continued to lounge in his room while the news of his illness took its time to travel by post. As Wilkes' companion, this meant he only had to entertain Wilkes for a few hours of the day, leaving him largely to his own devices. Which, to his complete and utter satisfaction, included being almost constantly in the company of Watson.
Instead, Sherlock’s blush deepened till it matched the colour of the pink lady’s suitcase, still lying out unzipped in front of the fireplace.
Then, just as John had said, the phone in the small room attached to the library began to ring.
“Besides, I thought you might kiss it better for me later,” John said with a small mischievous smile. John thought that was charming. It was.
He realized perhaps playing with the dog on the ground was probably not master of Manderley behaviour. He looked up to catch Harry’s eyes on him. Her look was puzzled, almost reflective. He imagined her thinking to herself,
“I think it would be entertaining,” he said, and leaning down to John’s ear, whispered, “and think of all the new people to deduce, while we stand watching over the proceedings.”
It might have been a trick of the light, but John imagined Sherlock’s eyes sparkled, not unlike his jeweled earrings.
Lestrade flushed hotly. “Yes, sir, such a thing was implied, but I did not take it.”
“That’s it?” Sherlock asked, voice flat. “You only wanted to know the killer.”
He felt himself and Gladstone bristle. Only Harry was allowed to poke fun at the dog’s weight. And what had this man done to Gladstone, when he’d been but a puppy? How foul a person was this Magnussen?
Tell me a story. That’s how it really starts. When Sherlock wakes him up like that, John asks too many questions—or rather, he doesn’t, actually, but there’s about a million of them running through his head, and Sherlock can see them in his eyes, or in the crusted custard on his best jumper the next day, or something like that. So instead of answers, John gets: tell me a story.
“I plan to be taxed actually. I’m going to help you plan everything,” he said, thinking of the pen-stained pidgeon-holes in the desk in the morning room. “I insist in fact.”
It was Wilkes. Damn, Wilkes. Wilkes!
Not unlike dance partners crossing a room side by side, they stepped across the sky, high above the busy street below.
“You mean all those things she said about me being amazing in bed? Hmm, yes, how dare she.”
“I did everything for her, you know,” Moriarty said, dragging him away from the bed. “We tried maid after maid, but not one of them suited. She had to have me with her, her servant always.”
John leant forward and reached for both of Sherlock’s hands which were currently resting atop John’s knees. “Well, good, as frankly I’m not overly fond of you poisoning yourself. But if it’s all in the past, what prompted you to tell me this now?”
. “Don’t tell me, I don’t - I don’t want to know.”
His agonizing over the subject must have shown in his face, as John’s expression was beginning to crumple in apology. “Sorry, I’m sorry,” John said in a rush. “That wasn’t on. I know you don’t like to -- sorry.”
The in-ship bot was sleek and white like the rest of the Hudson, and anchored to the ship by a mechanical arm attached to tracks in the ceiling. Despite being essentially an extension of the ship itself, John would still swear the blank oblong robot looked unimpressed with him.
He was still able to hear him, though faintly. John’s queer edginess had returned, and it was that same fear he’d perceived in John so many times before. Whenever Sherlock had gotten close to something, to anything connected to John’s past with Mary, this was how John had looked and sounded. He had finally discovered the source of it, the answer to the great mystery of what ailed John Watson, and it was not something he could have ever imagined.
The boat builder was standing up,
“Oh yes, he loved Nice – he likes to do experiments in the hotel rooms, can you imagine? He was collecting things from the sea every day and doing Lord knows what with them. It’s either that or he’s obsessing over the obituaries in the papers. He’s a strange child, like you wouldn’t believe,” Wilkes concluded, smiling across at Watson, and expecting him to share in the joke of ribbing his companion.
He entered his and John’s rooms, and closed the door behind him. He didn’t lock it. Lestrade was coming after him, wasn’t he? Besides, the worst had already happened.
A brief flash of interest crossed Moriarty’s face, before smoothing out once more into his earlier docile expression. It was enough for Sherlock to grin in triumph, his eyes crinkling at the edges. It was the kind of smile that made people wonder if his oddness was in fact madness.
In one swift motion, Sherlock stood from the bed. John took a step away from him, back against the open door. Once he was certain he had John’s full attention, Sherlock began to shift.
“Please John,” Sherlock said, and it sounded uncomfortably close to begging. “Let me try.”
“How would you convince him? You'll go running to Mr Watson saying, ,
“Sorry?”
Sherlock’s silence extended, prompting John to turn him around to face him, with a hand on his shoulder.
The Wizard sighed. “Don’t be so hasty in assigning me the role of antagonist. The Witch got herself into this mess by attempting a powerplay with the royal family. Not a smart move, when she draws all her power from a fire demon.”
Buying and selling forgeries of that specific artist’s, and checking that the signature and style passed. Obvious.
The witch watched his display of dominance with little interest. “Oh, I can’t break a curse like this one. Hardly anyone can.” Here, she paused. “However…”
> Oi.
John alternated between watching films projected in the cozy living area of the ship, and the video feeds from the bot cameras. This required brief walks between the Hudson and the BAK 2212 base, but as this was his only real exercise besides the work-out machines available, John couldn’t complain. He just prayed that he’d be recalled sooner rather than later.
“Assuming he is interested in assisting, of course,” Sherlock clarified, forgetting himself. He was being presumptuous, and perhaps the Captain would be offended if he continued assuming his assistance.
Watson seemed almost angered by the suggestion, before shaking his head. “I’ll have to turn down the offer. You see, I’m attached to the family motto: ‘He travels the fastest who travels alone.’ I suppose you’re not familiar with it.”
He stopped abruptly, and stood from his perch. He would not speak again until he was sure he was under control. He had almost told John that he loved him, like a little fool. What was the point in declaring things that his own husband couldn’t yet, and wouldn’t, say back?
Except that when he returned his gaze to the mirror glass, the reflection altered. His face slowly became unrecognizable, blurring. The shape was rounder, and his hair lightened, until a woman gazed back, triumphant with John’s hand on her shoulder. The wallpaper behind them began to drip - and then the furniture, the mantle, the bedposts, the flowers, and their vases - as if everything had been painted on, and the colours were being leached from their surfaces, melting away.
John stops looking at the ceiling. Then what is it? About, I mean. You never have just one reason for asking something, do you?
> Need help, drama queen?
I do like. What else are we?
There were slits along the cock, not unlike the gills along Sherlock’s neck, which formed a lattice pattern. The cock when fully aroused appeared almost floral, like leaves stacked in layers that blossomed out from Sherlock’s skin. When John lowered his hand to run over it lightly, the fluid collecting at the edges of the slits released from the slight pressure, slicking John’s palm in Sherlock’s naturally produced lubricant. Sherlock’s hips had stopped their rotating. Sherlock was also staring down at where John’s hand was still resting, wrapped loosely around their cock.
“You said you broke the bots so I would come,” John stated, sitting up on his forearms. “But it wasn’t done maliciously.”
“Yes, I know,” he said, which rather blew his cover.
John smiled tightly, and without humour.
John sighed. He hated his middle name. “Are you going to tell me how you knew it was me, across a crime scene?”
The sounds he makes. John’s sure people going by on the street must hear them going at it through the cracked window, but that makes it—embarrassing, later, but he’s never in that headspace in the moment. No, he’s in between Sherlock’s thighs and putting his mouth on anything he can reach: the lowest rib, belly button, and with a stretch, back to the underside of Sherlock’s chin. John’s fingers slip out, and Sherlock complains, but John has to get back up there, kissing his cheeks, his nose, his open mouth. Sherlock cups his jaw, and John stills. John didn’t know he was—frantic—until Sherlock calms him. Sherlock’s other hand slides around his neck, and holds, along the edge of his hairline. It’s—safe.
“Mr Watson, you don't think people honestly think things like that? About the nature of your meeting?” Lestrade asked, attempting to impart the seriousness of the matter.
Sherlock was a touch shy, a touch odd, frighteningly intelligent, and wholly charming. John was completely taken in. John had the immediate urge to spend as much time as possible with him, and oddly enough, Sherlock acquiesced.
“I tried to tell her off about being in public with another man, but of course she reminded me I was powerless to stop her. I’d never have a leg to stand on in a court of law, if I had ever wanted a divorce. I tried to leave, but I guess she didn’t want me walking out after that, actually thinking I could challenge her. She reached for her purse. She carried one of those small pistols, a derringer. It’s difficult to even remember what was said, or
From there, John was hustled into the back of a cab. Sherlock rattled off an address to an establishment called the “Orient Express”, and afterwards said, “Apologies, John. That wasn’t exactly the most exciting of cases, but I did the best I could on such short notice.”
And the unspoken - why John could not use the nicest room in the house any longer. Even though Moriarty had closed the shutters tight, he could still hear it. The waves crashing against the shingle beach down in the cove.
And it was John. Yes, John pressing into him, in the library. Where John worked and sat and read. He imagined that now whenever John looked at the window seat, John would see himself fingering his husband open with gentle insistence. One slick finger leading to two, both pushing in further, stretching the rim, and pressing against that spot inside that made him gasp and squirm. He was pressing back and down, for the first time wanting more, wanting to be stretched and ready, for John, always John -
The Man (as Sherlock begins to refer to him in his mind) is likely left handed, as he naturally favours holding the book in that hand. Sherlock wonders which hand he uses to shoot a gun. Sherlock has a feeling The Man knows his way around a gun.
His hand was frozen stiff, still gripping the bag. John’s eyes were fixated on it.
“Oh, am I?” John confirmed it by sneaking another kiss. Sherlock kissed back with soft pressure, unsure, but welcome.
“And I told you in Monte, I’m the one who gets to decide who’s right for Manderley.”
Muffled, “Any of the options listed would be satisfactory.”
He pauses before continuing, recognizing this is obviously a sensitive subject.
John clenched his fist. “The door is still behind you.”
Moriarty looked at him as if he were a pet who had performed a rather neat trick.
“Let’s not actually, seeing as you started it. What are you implying? I thought you didn’t spare people from this kind of thing.” John’s hands were clenching and unclenching, and John couldn’t look at him for more than a few moments at a time.
You always like it better when I spread, Sherlock says. The quiet evening living room reading time ends quite quickly after that. The transition from Sherlock in his lap to them in bed is a familiar blur now, both from fantasy versions and reality. After the natural conclusion of any Sherlock innuendo, John lies in the dark with Sherlock on his side—first, he’s tucked against John’s chest, then, he’s tucked underneath John’s back, a shoulder under his, then a chest, and before John knows it, he’s being held. They haven’t fallen asleep yet, but John can feel it coming on soon. He wonders if it’s a bedtime story night, or if those have come to an end.
He delivered it playfully, intending it to be a light-hearted admission, in the hopes that Sherlock might find it a bit funny. He might even feel a little flattered, before the comment was brushed off. If Sherlock wanted to take the piss out of him a bit, John could handle that too.
“Did he offer you money?”
This thought passed from John’s mind as quickly as it had come when Sherlock spat the wire from their mouth, and eyed John with obvious nervousness.
John settled on texting. Anonymous, painless, and Sherlock preferred it. Done.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said, reluctant, eyes shooting to the side. “That you’d see, and be repulsed. One thing would be too far, and that would be it. It would all be too much for the man still clinging to his normalcy to handle.”
Stop. Sherlock pulls the feather from behind his ear, and gives it back to John. I don’t like this story.
Moriarty pulled him to the chair with the dressing gown thrown over its back.
John, puzzled, looked down at his coat. “You mean, the bit of bread and cheese?”
Lestrade returned in record time, with Moriarty trailing behind him. Moriarty bowed his head in greeting, appearing to be in his role as Jim the servant for the time being, though Sherlock knew how quickly that could change.
“There are several possibilities. Mayfair, Museum, etc.” Sherlock finished. “Lestrade, ask the exchange for Mayfair 1895, and if that doesn’t work, try Museum.”
Moriarty paused before delivering what he likely believed was quite the parry. “Mrs Watson always used to.”
. You'll go running to him like you did before, when Magnussen visited.'
John barely twitched as Sherlock stitched up the reopened wounds, neat and meticulous, already well on their way to healing.
His worry spurring him into action, he immediately begins to descend the small ladder. No sooner than when he’s on the lower rungs does his leg make contact with what feels like a body. John reaches out blindly with his hand, feeling his way along a coat. Yes, definitely a body. A very still body.
His own circle of friends though!  What a ridiculous notion. Company with men his own age had never been anything but trouble. He had never met someone like John before, and he felt certain he never would again.
“Looking for this?” he asked, parroting Watson’s words from earlier.
“How did—? The book, of course,” John said, a part of him regretting that this situation didn’t allow Sherlock to do much showing off of his talent.
John watched Sherlock’s gills fluttering, the only sound in the shuttle those small gasping breaths, as BAK 2212’s air was taken in through those thin slits. John lowered his gun.
“So, are you going to explain to me what you told Lestrade?” John asks. He’s embarrassed to admit he’d forgotten a bit about the actual case in light of Sherlock being safe, but now John has a lot of questions. And this was his favourite part - Sherlock getting to flex his intellectual prowess for John to admire.
John rapped his knuckles against the living room desk. Sherlock could hear it from the kitchen.
If things continued like this any longer, John might wake in the night to find his arms full of a surprisingly needy husband.
Next, the stairs leading down to the castle door creaked and groaned, and new steps appeared at the end, one by one, till the door to the castle descended past John’s line of sight.
To prompt him he said, “I imagine she expected someone more -” he paused.
“Great,” John said. “You know, maybe if you ever told me what we were doing, this would happen less.”
John moved his hand, praying away a hand tremor, and the sinking feeling in his gut that was too much like disappointment. That had no business being there.
“Why don't you ask him?” Lestrade replied, somewhat incredulous.
The walk was faster once he had company, and sooner than he had expected they reached the tall gates. The steps up to the palace loomed in front of them, each stair lined with two soldiers at opposite ends.
“Don’t be silly, no one quite looks like you,” Sherlock said, holding Mrs Davis’ purse open for her while she dug through a pile of used tissues for her sunglasses. “It was you, but in my mind.”
Once caught, the scarecrow apparently felt no need to conceal that it was capable of movement, and continued hopping towards John.
“As everything else on that list was carefully selected to balance the cocaine,
“Intriguing,” Sherlock replied, voice lowered. “Do go on.”
Would someone please save him from the misplaced intentions of old ladies?
John reached around to Sherlock’s front, stroking their cock once, and causing Sherlock to practically
Sherlock sighed, but flicked his hand. “Kingsbury door,” he mumbled.
The circular conversation continued. “And, you’re sure this isn’t just a…?”
He flipped back to the front page where there was a written dedication, which read
John asked, as politely as possible.
“... I did know it was Valentine’s Day.”
They traveled past the lawn, with their earlier tension lifted as they climbed the grass bank above it. Ahead, they had only dark forest to look forward to. The rain had started as predicted, and as they trampled through dampened branches and leaves, he was on alert for any moment John might need an arm to lean on.
John turned off the projection. He’d always hated the 6D gimmicks.  “So, I guess that was a bit of a failed experiment.”
“Yes, sir,” Molly replied. Queerly, he noticed that while Molly was still her usual timid and apologetic self, she seemed pleased by the instruction.
“Do I want to know where you got that?” John asked, shooting an accusing look at the Hudson bot, which was currently projecting a block of text for Sherlock to read.
And as easily as that, all was right between them again.
Sherlock scoffed while John spilled the water over his hair. “I’m not a - the fainting was a timed distraction -”
“Evidently not.”
“Sherlock!”
David reluctantly passed the note to Moriarty, who received it gingerly, holding the edge of it between two pinched fingers and showing obvious distaste for its crumpled state.
That unpleasant thought was luckily cut short by Lestrade entering the library, though he did not appear to be in good spirits. “Sir, do you mind if I speak with you for a moment?”
The atmosphere aboard their safe haven had shifted. John wasn’t sure if this was due to the transfer between them, or from being shown Sherlock’s ship, or both. John had been provided with the pieces to the puzzle of Sherlock’s origins, and the possible reason as to why people would be looking for them in the first place; John wondered if Sherlock regretted revealing so much.
“Not a very intelligent remark John,” Harry replied, “considering Lion won two firsts at Cruft’s last February.”
John signed, without thought.
Oh. Right.
“Would have been a little over a year ago.” John paused, expression changing to realization, and then to confusion. “That would have been around the same time that Mary… had...”
“You made yourself?” John cut in. “Seriously?”
Lady Norton eyed him, reassessing. “What are you suggesting?”
Being addressed so directly was a joy and a terror. He felt like an ungainly schoolboy next to this older, confident man. He began answering the question in halting words, saying something obvious about the artificiality of the whole place, before Wilkes once again reared his head.
The Queen, it seemed, was quite adamant that every witch and wizard serve their country.
Sherlock breathed out, and opened the door. John was partially sitting up in the tub, watching him enter with a small smile. There was a wash cloth over his left shoulder, covering where Sherlock knew there to be a scar. He wondered if John had placed it there specifically for when he came in.
He shrugged. He wasn’t going to expose her, as long as thievery wasn’t her (current) inclination. Forcing an invitation from John the evening before, and then sneaking off to see the gallery, after making sure to arrive early, and bringing a crowd with her. A convenient method of keeping the staff busy. Stepping in close enough to one of the most expensive pieces to see the individual brush strokes.
“It’s my face,” Sherlock said, in answer to a question not asked.
Sherlock sighed. “What have I been thinking -- Isn’t it obvious?”
“I believe we have some unfinished business from earlier,” Sherlock said in a low voice, leaning his head down to kiss John’s thin, and very amused, mouth.
His clothing was shabby in comparison to Watson’s and his hair was messed beyond all help from the wind, but none of it mattered. His face ached from smiling. He felt different with Watson, somehow more himself. The shy, awkward, and humble status of being a companion was shed like a winter coat in the spring. Wilkes and his flu were nothing to him.
Wondering about the turn of John’s thoughts was more dangerous than anything they’d discussed earlier. His mind was primed to launch into another one of his imaginings, the hateful ones about what John would have done with Mary in the past. He cut it off before it started.
His phone vibrated twice soon after.
His interest in John does in fact turn out to be much more like a virus, intent on invading and usurping its host. Sherlock has lost any previous semblance of control and is unable to resist the daily temptation of seeking John out. Sherlock begins to test the limits of his previously careful observation approach, such as how close he can possibly get without being noticed. One time he sits directly across from John. He maintains distance by holding a newspaper in front of his face, which allows him brief glances of the other man when he flips the pages. At one point their eyes meet and Sherlock quickly lifts the newspaper to cover his burning cheeks.
When he realized he was both babbling and bragging, he snapped his mouth closed with a click.
“Let me guess, you’re dressing in a period costume,” he said, rolling his eyes for no one to see. “I imagine some people enjoy having variety, whereas for you it detracts from the class of your ensemble. All the fools with their crass costumes.”
These at least had the decency to be less salacious, and did not include the horrible photograph of John with the moustache. This was except for, of course, the paper he now knew to be owned by his most memorable past guest, Charles Augustus Magnussen, which did not mince words on his
Wilkes had at least three almost meltdowns, the worst being at fifteen minutes prior (wrong wine, wrong tablecloth, etc.), but had his dreadful grin firmly in place when the first guests began to wander in.
As he was descending the stairs to the main hall, he just so happened to come upon the very lady herself, alone and at the base of the stairs. Lady Norton, nee Adler, resplendent in white with her dark hair folded artfully into an updo, and whom he had heard far too much about to not be suspicious of her already having shucked her companions.
John’s face, rather than breaking into a look of dawning realization on how Sherlock had gathered intel on their suspect’s whereabouts, had softened. He looked at him differently. It was the kind of expression that Sherlock never felt deserving of, but still made him feel… good. John could look at him a certain way and his chest would heat, like drinking after he’d put the blood in the microwave first.
“I wasn’t thinking of anything,” he lied, and in an attempt to lighten the mood, smiled slyly. “Maybe I was thinking of how you’ll have the surprise of your life when you see my fancy dress.”
“Recovered well? You mean after getting stabbed at my – ” John abruptly stopped before saying
“God, must you always be right!” Sherlock cried, though it sounded too fond to be a true complaint.
“William and Scott,” Sherlock responded, apropos of nothing.
“You asked me to trust you,” John said, exhausted. “And I’m now asking you to do me the same courtesy.”
A smile stretched across the other man’s face. A hand at last slid into his own.
He needn’t have bothered, as the alien’s focus then shifted to John’s leg, and the leg brace newly reattached to his upper thigh and calf. They made an inquisitive sound, which John noted was entirely different from any previous noise they had made.
Sherlock had never wanted to get to this part. Now that it was here anyway, he suspected it would be just as tedious as he’d feared. Sherlock had two options. One was to lie, which would be difficult to accomplish
Sherlock turned back to him with a smile. “Many say so, but mad or not, we only have the two rooms, and I can’t break your spell if I can’t observe.”
“My God man, compose yourself,” the Colonel admonished, ushering David further down the path to the street.
“Why can’t you be more like your neighbour, hmm?” John asked, unscrewing Anderson’s front panel. “Sally never needs repairs.”
“I have a brother. This was his idea," he responded, not concealing his distaste for his brother in the slightest.
Given that the days leading up to the visit with Murray had felt like a continuous awaital of an oncoming death sentence, Sherlock had come to be numbed to it. He went through the motions. He watched John and their enemy, and they all watched Murray’s face as he read through the names in his schedule.
He was fond of this particular attention-seeking ploy of Sebastian’s, as it meant he would be relieved of spending the day with him. He took his leave of Wilkes with a skip in his step, heading to the dining room for an early luncheon. It was his ideal mealtime – in between breakfast and lunch, when he could eat in peace without being distracted by the other hotel guests surrounding him. He was so enamoured with the prospect of being alone that he didn’t realize till he was halfway across the room that the dining area was not completely empty.
That evening they retreated to their room much earlier than usual, as if shutting themselves up in their wing would hold off the inevitable arrival of the magistrate at their home the next day. Once locked away from the prying eyes of the servants however, they easily fell into their recently created habits.
“Oh, so I ought to be flattered then," Watson responded, strangely more amused than anything else. "And why should he consider me important?”
John’s hand beneath his chin tipped his head upward, and still Sherlock resisted, keeping his eyes closed. He couldn’t hear anything over the beating of his own heart and his erratic breathing, loud on the exhale, sharp on the inhale.
Sherlock must have grabbed the bot just as it had undocked for its route, causing the alarm system to believe the bot had been disabled while out in the field.
The Colonel returned the note to David saying, “No, I suppose the note would seem out of place. But then I have no idea what the contents of it referred to, and people suffering emotional distress may do many odd things. Mr Watson, are you aware of what the note means? Why was your wife meeting with this man?”
Manners. He was meant to be playing at manners. The morning had taxed him more than he had realized.
Sherlock startled awake, and took a few moments to allow himself to be calmed slightly by the sight of John’s face turned towards him, lined with worry even in sleep.  Eventually he forced himself from bed, throwing open the shutters on their windows.
“Yes, and if you don’t mind me saying, I don’t think he’ll be leaving without a word with one of you.”
I never get anywhere with the dogs, remember? We could never decide on the breeds.
“Well sorry for getting attached to the thing that speaks to me and looks after me on the regular!” John shouted, annoyance building as he tried to deactivate the alarm via the side panel in the living area’s wall. “It’s only—human.”
He’s a man of many words.
They came to Manderley in early May. John said this was meant to be the best time, or at least it was according to everyone else. John seemed to lack a full appreciation for that sort of thing, but he apparently had many flowers in bloom to look forward to.
“I’ve just come up from there. And we have a bell for that,” John commented, still petting Gladstone’s head and attempting to get him to heel.
They would likely never see each other again. Wilkes was always in search of new wealth and people - becoming bored of Europe was only a matter of time. There was no particular reason why they would ever travel in the same social circles as John Watson again.
John loved pleasing his partners, and if nothing else, this guide had provided him with ample knowledge on how to please someone interested in a bit of fingering, moving forward. John had known himself to be attracted to men, who often had prostates, whether they preferred having them stimulated or not, but he had shied away from going through with anything, many times. When he was younger, it had been due to the lingering shadow his father seemed to cast over his life. Now, it was the fear of entering into an unknown world at his time of life. For example, prostate stimulation. John hadn't known half of this stuff. If he ever got up the courage to try on a relationship with someone who did have a prostate now, he supposed he would owe this SH a certain debt of gratitude.
, John imagined, maybe finally having his way with him.
. If he was wrong, the precaution of leaving John behind would be unnecessary, and the worst of it would be John cross with him later. However, if he was right, he wanted John a world away.
“Mrs Hudson, do you mind taking Gladstone downstairs with you for the evening?” Sherlock asked, kissing both her cheeks in apology, a habit which he’d developed as he’d come to think of her as a mother.
> No, not at all. I guess that answers my question.
He fully regarded the other man; the observations he’d already made drew to the surface once again. Moriarty had worked at Manderley long enough to establish himself, but due to his youth could not have been present for so long.
Sherlock turned in his seat to observe Moriarty at last, his pen still in hand. “Hmm, I find that I rather don’t care what Mrs Watson used to do.”
She answers on the third ring. “Dr Watson? Have you found your partner yet?”
. John’s waiting continued, and if anything only grew more dangerous. But John could have borne anything, if it had meant Sherlock’s happiness. Except of course, John had believed he’d jeopardized that as well.
“You can’t, John,” Sherlock said. “It’s important to know him for what he is, but we can’t allow for any kind of confrontation. Which you already know well, as you’ve been suffering him all of this time.”
“There is no point in exhausting your horse and potentially injuring yourself in pursuit of a common thief, nor would it be in aid of catching the lot of them.”
“But that’s not what I asked you up for. I wanted to let you know I’m getting married.”
John’s attention was drawn back to his computer screen where his delightful client was now snapping his fingers at him.
. I’ve been quite comfortable here. No one thinks of the country housekeeper. No one thinks of them at all.”
A moment later, John’s attention was drawn from Sherlock’s grin to the door by the sound of footsteps outside the entrance to the castle. John stood, back straightening; who other than him would be coming in through the empty moors?
With a firm seat in his saddle and his thoughts elsewhere, Sherlock road along a country path through the forest, soon to approach his destination. Riding helped him think almost as well as the violin, and removed himself from his transport almost as well as the prick of a needle.
John was out of breath by the end of his tirade, and paused before he continued at a much lower volume. “If I acted like a man suffering from unrequited love, it’s because I was, and am. But it was never over Mary, it was always
“Right, yeah,” John said, taking a step back, and allowing the sliding door to automatically close.
John blessed the Hudson for its liveable living area. Off the ship, he spent his time observing self-sufficient operations, which was exactly as engaging as one might have expected.
, but why do you think that means we’ll let you stay here?”
“I’d like to come see it with you, but –“
“Sending the help away so you can yell at me, John?” he asked with as much nonchalance as he felt able to muster. He turned away from John to play at inspecting the line of his jacket in the mirror.
“And?” John prompted, unaccustomed to Sherlock not wanting to spill the details.
While the man’s hand continued its path beneath the sheet, his eyes watched John in open curiosity, silently asking for new direction.
At the neat, crisp turn of his hand, a panel in the wall behind them lifted, and the Witch of Belgravia strolled out from behind it. The exertion of her earlier climb was still apparent, but otherwise, she appeared no worse for wear.
“Ran out of books to read?” John guessed. Sherlock’s eyes looked to the left, before they nodded stiffly.
The Witch reached the top of the stairs first, and proceeded to walk off on her own. When John arrived shortly after, he considered following her, but was prevented from doing so when the double doors she had walked through closed behind her with a bang.
“So then, you don’t want to return to your brother,” John summarized.
“Stripped of his powers? Can you even do that?” The possibility hadn’t even occurred to John, who was now beginning to understand why Sherlock hadn’t come himself.
“You say that now John,” Sherlock said shakily, in a way that made John’s heart squeeze in his chest, “but your reaction to the reality of it may be very different.”
He was overcome by a montage of events, past clues he had unknowingly been accumulating. They flashed through his mind, memories projected at rapid fire onto the tableau of John and Mary at the end of the hall. John saying that something had happened to him that past year, which had altered his entire life, that he had needed a new start. John’s sadness, his guilt, and never, ever speaking of Mary. John’s fear of him going to the cove, to the cottage, thinking that he might find something there that would reveal the murder. John saying not all memories were ones worth remembering. John’s reaction to him mentioning the first murder that had intrigued him, the boy Carl Powers, that had been made to look like a drowning. John not sleeping after Mary died, John pacing, John developing a limp caused by psychological distress. Wilkes, saying for the whole hotel to hear,
Slipping a straw past his lips, Sherlock considered venturing out of his room and into the rest of the flat. He hated this part, and there was nothing sufficiently distracting in his room. It was always worse when he let himself go without feeding for too long.

“John, none of that matters now,” Sherlock insisted, exiting from his dazed state once more to stop John from tailspinning into a panic. “The worst of what you were dreading has happened, and now all we can do is work with what we have.”
Sherlock, who considers himself largely a man of mind rather than action, does not think at all before throwing himself off the side of the platform. He also thinks nothing of grabbing the prostrate man and rolling them both off the tracks into the safety of the overhanging platform edge. Sherlock is distantly aware of shouting coming from above, and that the train is quickly approaching and will soon pass them.
“Well, it’s just… My now ex-wife, she used to go to this psychic– “
He delivered this speech decidedly and somewhat into the wind, but now turned eagerly to see Watson’s reaction.
The words were stilted, awkward in their delivery, but Watson’s eyes on him were steady.
“How’s it going with John, then?”
“To be a skilled wizard, you have to be a puzzle solver. I hadn’t thought of that. And I suppose you’re very good at it?”
“Yes, of course -” the Captain said, but he was already steering John away from the cove, past the stone cottage, and far away from that still, calm sea.
Similarly, John was too preoccupied with Sherlock to realise he’d left his cane outside the door of the restaurant.
John blinks rapidly, willing his eyes to see something besides the impossibility of a form emerging from beneath the bed frame. Despite his efforts, reality does not change. John holds his breath and his body ramrod straight in the tight space behind the curtain. His entire focus is on the thing creeping up from the floor. All John is able to make out is the shape of a person.
Silence grew between them as they continued walking along the drive.
What John liked best was Sherlock’s eyes blown wide, mouth open, his tongue’s usual wittiness lost, mouth relegated only to forming his name. He wanted a Sherlock Holmes only barely hinted at on the page, one never seen before—vulnerable, private, and just for him. If John had ever overthought it, he would have been deadly embarrassed by it, especially given that most fans preferred to exaggerate Sherlock’s darker aspects. But a fantasy was allowed to be a fantasy, after all. And that’s all it ever would be.
