Cas looked wistful. “I do, sometimes. It was inconvenient and messy, and some foods were downright disgusting, but some foods were extremely comforting. I don't miss being hungry though. That was unpleasant.” he said with a grimace.
Sam began shaking again, his hands barely able to hold the flask, he placed it down as carefully as he could next to him. He was beginning to feel a little warmer, his muscles ached from the constant shivering he had endured for two days.
Sam turned the truck and parked it behind Baby. Jack jumped out before Sam could even turn off the engine. He ran up to Dean and hugged him.
“How can I help?” said Castiel, his deep voice dipping even lower as he tilted his head in confusion as to the contents of the table.
Cas breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. “I was in charge of keeping the clan supplied with food and medicines. Basically all of the farming and trading. As an Alpha I was also expected to serve as protection for the clan. We were trained to fight from when we were children.” he said blandly.
Dean smiled. “I don’t think it’ll be a problem in the long run. Just, we’ll take that part slow, okay? I’m not entirely sure what experience you have, but for me, with guys anyway, it’s nil.” he said, feeling embarrassed.
“It's about bloody time you showed up.” said Balthazar who looked unbothered by the blade currently being held to his throat.
Dean has a much needed talk with his mother and receives some wise advice. Sam wishes he was an only child. Mary meddles behind the scenes. And Cas gets his man.
“Wow, and you say that I have bad table manners.” said Dean, pointedly before answering Sam's question. “Garth tells me there are twelve coming, mostly Betas but a couple of Alphas too. They start arriving in a couple of days.”
“Yeah, gettin’ warmer too.” Dean commented, gesturing to the cloudless sky. He was running out of small talk.
“Don't worry about that Sam, I'll do that. Your bath is nearly ready. Just go grab yourself some clean clothes and dump the ones you're wearing in here. The bath water is pretty tepid. I figured you didn't need it hot right now.” said Dean, pouring the pan of steaming water into the laundry tub and adding a couple of handfuls of shaved soap. Sam gave Dean a grateful look and lumbered off to get ready for his bath and Dean returned to the kitchen, intent on his task of heating enough water on the stove top for the laundry.
“Bobby would be tickled pink to hear you say that.” Dean said, his eyes becoming moist and his throat thick with emotion.
“I got blindfolded and taken to meet him. It's in these ruins of some big house and I'm searched for weapons, which I expected. They take 'em all, except the knife I hid in the lining of my jacket. I get told to wait in this room and I'm bidin' my time, when who should walk in, but Andrea.”
“I need a review of our defences, weapons and able bodied fighters. I also want a comprehensive list of our supplies and an estimate of the last of the harvest yet to be gathered. I will excuse you all from your usual duties for tomorrow, in order to bring me the information by tomorrow evening. I have assigned you all a specific task, the list will be handed out after the meeting.”
Dean sighed. “God, he's just so cute. I damn near melted into a puddle when he said that. We'll explain that he has to finish school before he can be a doctor. I think the doctor play set you got him will soften the blow.” he said wrapping his arms around Cas' neck and dropping a kiss onto his husbands nose.
“Whoa! Oh shit! Cas, I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you? I forgot. Holy shit.” he babbled as Jess and Bobby approached slowly, mindful of spooking an Alpha in protect mode. They watched as Cas struggled to tamp down his instincts for a second before releasing his grip slightly on Deans shirt and sagging heavily, his expression agonised. “Not. Your fault” he gasped as Dean looked mortified.
“How are you feeling? You're a little warm.” said Cas, lifting Dean's head up and checking his temperature with the back of his hand.
“We were going to wait, but then with Dean coming home and everything, we were up late talking after you went to bed and, well...”
“Okay, we're gonna do this as quick as possible. You ready?” said Ellen, as she and Benny got into position.
“We all did. I'm so glad you came along when you did, who knows what he would have done to me otherwise.” said Cas, pretending to cry as Jo bent over laughing.
“That is actually really fucking romantic. I didn't think you had it in you.” she said with a sly nudge into Deans ribs.
“I'm melting in this thing. It's your turn next year, either that or we break it to him that Santa isn't real.” he chuckled.
Cas froze and slowly turned to face Dean fully, his expression was unreadable. “Did you want me to do that?” he asked, his voice catching slightly.
“Yeah, no. That one is still worse. You didn't flash your junk this time.” said Dean, chuckling at Cas' embarrassed groan.
I'm loving that people are still reading this, thank you for your comments and kudos. They keep me going when I feel like giving up. My poor, fragile ego needs constant validation or it turns on me like a wild animal.
Jess looked at him suspiciously, before nodding. “Okay, but keep it brief. He's exhausted. Sam and I will be in the kitchen if you need us.” Sam shrugged and followed his mate as she swept out of the room towards the kitchen.
“Thank you.” Cas said, sounding frustrated. “One pair of jeans didn't fit me, but I can't get them back on the hanger.”
Dean grinned. “This is why we’re friends, Cas.” he said, wincing as a particularly deep rut in the track made the car drop on one side. He looked out the window over to Sam who was driving Cas’ truck. Sam gave him a thumbs up and made a gesture to show he would also turn around once Dean had parked.
He saw a listing for a place called Mary’s kitchen and smiled. It promised good old fashioned home cooking. It sounded like their best shot at dinner tonight. It had a four star rating on the info guide and he hoped he could get them a table at such short notice. He walked into his room to get his phone with a grin.
Dean flushed and shifted with embarrassment. “Sorry, I was looking at your scar. It's not all that bad, considering.” he said, looking away.
“I guess.” said Dean, still looking a little uncomfortable. Dean felt a tiny hand on his shoulder and
Cas gave Dean a long suffering look. “No? Maybe when I was a full power I could have done that, but not any more. I was just going to use a sharpened stick.” he said incredulously.
It has come to my attention that someone has stolen this story and is posting it on Wattpad under the user name of Shaygirl1D, as their own work. Don't do that, it's a shitty thing to do. I've reported it.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to come in your mouth.” Dean apologised, his arm over his face and his chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath.
“So, you are going to have to show me how everything works. I have no idea where to start.” he said, sounding excited.
“Jack found us a motel for tonight. It means stopping a little earlier than we usually do, but the next available place would have had us stopping way after midnight. He’s excited because it has an indoor pool and sauna attached. He wants to learn to swim.” Sam said, with a chuckle.
“We’ll talk about this later, Okay?” he said to Cas who nodded. He turned to wave at Sam who pulled up in front of the truck.
“Uh, yes. Yes I am.” he said slowly, looking at Dean for help. Dean just shrugged and mouthed wordlessly that he had no idea what to say.
“Once we set your arm, I suggest you get on the radio to that brother of yours. See if they can get a medic out here. I won't lie, he won't make it if we try and get him there. I'm pretty sure the blade nicked his spleen , he's bleeding out slow. He'll bleed out faster if we move him. Most we can do here, is get the blade out and prevent further damage.” Benny said matter of factly.
Horrified, Cas and Dean broke the kiss and Cas spun away to adjust his beard as Dean turned to see a very confused and tearful little boy who was glaring daggers at Santa, his little fists were bunched and he shook with anger.
“By the way, the river isn't gone. It was just diverted a little further upstream. It's just behind that hill. We can replenish our water supplies and even have a bath if you want, I have some soap if anyone wants it.” said Cas, fighting back a yawn.
Everyone began talking at once and the noise was deafening, when as one the crowd moved forward to inspect the list being nailed to a post by Ezekiel, Michaels eldest Alpha son.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas flushed a little and nodded. “If we were to pursue a romantic relationship, it would be a good basis to begin from, don't you think?” he asked, tilting his head in confusion.
Sam looked confused. “What? Why are you laughing?” he asked, watching his brother fold over with tears in his eyes.
Sam nodded. “Bobby gave me the basics, Cas must be feeling pretty bad right now. They may not have been good people, but they were still his clan. Is there anything we can do?” Sam's concern was genuine.
Enjoy the fluff while it lasts, because there are some heavy chapters to come as the main storyline picks up.
Castiel had slept all night and most of the morning. He awoke to baby Matthew poking him in the ear, his chubby little face just inches away as he stood unsteadily at the side of Castiels bed, gripping the sheets in a drool covered hand. He smiled and booped the boys nose with a finger, making him giggle loudly.
He stood up and approached the aisle where there were dozens of different brands of hiking boots and shoes. He picked up a brown leather pair and inspected them. They were pretty nice, not too expensive. Not ideal for hiking, but would go pretty well with the rest of the clothes he'd picked out. Hell, he may even buy himself a pair while he was here. Would it be too weird if he and Cas got matching boots? Nah. Boots were boots.
“It's just ahead. You'll see it anyyy second...now.” said Balthazar, pointing to the strangest sight that Castiel had ever seen.
Cas nodded. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know how else to-” he choked out. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.”
Once they were at the counter, Jake welcomed them and apologised for his wife again. The bill was pretty steep, but Jake gave them a 25% discount and threw in a wind-breaker for Cas for free.
A surprise laugh burst out of Dean before he could stop it and he looked over at Cas for help to see that he too was laughing, although he was doing a better job of doing it quietly.
Dean shook his head, forgetting that Cas couldn't see him. “Nope. Just a stipulation. Bobby was just concerned you'd get hurt. If he calls you an idgit, it means he cares.”
This chapter is kinda fluffy, but contains some stuff that will set up the main story, which will kick up a gear in the next couple of chapters. Don't worry, Cas and Dean will meet soon, they just have to go through some angst first. This story is going to be kinda massive, so plenty of Destiel to come. And some angst. And some fluff. Aaaand yes, eventually smut. *tries to pretend to be cool about writing smut while sweating nervously*
This is a bit of a filler chapter, it needed to go in here though. The next chapter starts to get a little more of the overall plot, although I have put clues in previous chapters.
The look that came over Cas’s face was nothing short of wondrous. “Oh, I- I love you too.” he stammered out. He clearly hadn’t expected Dean to ever say it.
“Are you still angry with me? Dean, I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to...” Cas started and Dean shook his head and interrupted.
“Bathing in the river. They shouldn't be much longer, the river is far too cold still for more than a quick wash. I was surprised the shrieking didn't wake you up, but you didn't even stir.” said Cas chuckling as he adjusted the skewered meat over the coals.
“When he possessed you, it took away something, your sense of self. He was especially cruel in that he didn't even let you sleep or create a safe dream for you to escape to. You were left alone inside yourself, helpless to stop him.” Cas guessed wisely.
They were beaten and starved for the slightest infraction. But Alistair had one punishment that he favoured above all, there was an old well in one of the outer buildings, it had long dried up and the bottom of the well shaft opened up into a small damp cavern littered with trash and crawling with rats and snakes, it was fondly referred to by Alistair as “The Pit”.
They sat for a little while as Cas turned the pages stating the name of each plant and animal as Matthew babbled and pointed to the pictures, although he seemed to be more interested in actually turning the pages than what was actually on them, forcing Cas to occasionally lift the book away from sticky drool covered fingers.
He returned a few minutes later, carefully handing Cas a bowl and spoon before taking his seat and digging into his own meal. Cas tentatively took a bite, his eyes fluttering closed with a satisfied groan as he tasted his first solid food in days. “Good, ain't it?” said Bobby, smirking as Cas dug in with enthusiasm. “Should probably take it slow though, don't wanna make ya sick. It'd be a waste of good food. Ellen put a lot of effort into makin' it, the least you can do is actually taste it on the way down.”
Dean gave him an odd look. “You’re not gonna pull a miracle or something and part the lake like the red sea are you?” he asked, only half joking. Sam laughed at the imagery.
Dean stayed quiet throughout. Sam kept giving him 'the look' but Dean ignored it. Once Cas was settled, Dean excused himself to bed, intent on avoiding everyone as long as possible.
“I haven’t just kissed someone like that since I was a teenager.” he panted, slightly consternated that he’d somehow ended up virtually sitting in Cas’ lap.
Cas had kept a little distance between him and Dean, he was affectionate, but not overly so. He hadn’t asked to share Dean’s tent, nor had Dean suggested it. They seemed content to just spend time together. Although Dean craved the comfort of waking up with Cas in the mornings, he didn’t feel comfortable in sharing a tent so openly just yet. Cas was just making good on his promise not to push.
“I know, I just wish we’d brought better soda, this is disgusting.” he looked at the can and made a noise of disgust. “Bubblegum flavour? That’s it, Jack is no longer allowed to buy the sodas.” he said holding the can away from himself as if it was contaminated.
Stripping to the waist, he sat on a rock by the riverside and soaped up his face, rinsing and then soaping his beard. He shaved his face from memory, having no mirror to check his work, he hoped for the best, running his hands over his now smooth face he thought he'd done a pretty good job. Hopefully no-one would see him to judge him. Stripping the rest of the way, he waded into the shallows until waist deep, wincing at the near freezing water. He plunged in, soaking himself completely before wading back to grab the soap. He scrubbed his skin and hair vigorously, trying to neutralise his Alpha scent as much as possible before rinsing off and wading out of the river to dry off and dress.
Bobby grimaced “Yer brothers in heat. Jess is... uh.. a little protective. Now, I'm gettin' thrown out of my own damn house. So I gotta go stay at Garth's until this is all over.” he said gesturing back at the house.
Dean let out the breath he’d unconsciously been holding. “Yeah, that’s good. There’s stuff that, I dunno. I don’t even know if I can find the words for them. It’s too much. I don’t know if I can ever talk about those.” he admitted.
He wondered how he himself would cope being back in the regime after the freedom of the last few months. It would be difficult, but he was willing to do just about anything to protect his new family and the life he would be free to plan. He imagined the future, living in the house that Dean had designed with the children he and Dean would have. For the first time, the life he had always dreamed of was within his reach. He was in love, and best of all, someone loved him in return.
Matthew decided that Cas needed a closer look and attempted to climb onto the bed. Getting frustrated when he couldn't quite make it. So Cas lifted him and placed him next to himself against the pillows on the opposite side to his wound.
Cas huffed a laugh and opened the book at the beginning, he licked his lips and began “The principal methods of
Michael turned from talking to Raphael and smiled as Castiel approached, the smile not meeting his eyes, making him look calculating and fake. “Castiel, I'm glad you could join us. Please, sit with us” he gestured to a table with several maps laid out on it and took a seat as Castiel did the same.
Dean cleared his throat. “Um, about that. You really should know how to swim, Cas.” he said gently, ignoring Sam’s warning look. “Cause, you’re missing out. This is something you and Jack can do together, like you’ve been talkin’ about?” he said, congratulating himself on finding a way to say it without offending the angel. “Besides, one of the best things about campin’ is swimming in the lake and having a splash fight. You wanna do all those things, right?” he cajoled.
Dean smiled. “There’s a saying. ‘If you can’t be with the one you love, love the one you’re with.’ I think that applies to this situation.”
Dean nodded. “I like it. Are you sure though? I mean, won’t you be tempted to take on hunts yourself?” he asked.
Cas nodded. “Okay.” he said, his voice cracking again. His shoulders were drawn tight and he looked crushed.
Cas was silent the whole time. Dean thanked Jake for all his help and dismissed any further apologies with a shake of his head and a wave of his hand. The enthusiasm of before was a distant memory though.
It was one of the happiest days of his life, even if Sammy still ragged on him about his manly fainting fit and the tears that came after, whatever. It's not like Sam didn't turn on the waterworks at the wedding, the big moose cried throughout the ceremony, not even manly tears but big gasping sobs that drowned out the vows that he and Cas had worked on for weeks. The jerk.
Apparently I'm still a details whore, I have to edit harshly sometimes, then I always worry that I've taken too much out. I don't want it to be too dialogue heavy, but I don't want to get bogged down describing every little detail about the scene.
Dean went cold. “They...uh. They got a medic stayin' at Bobby's. But they're a day away, man. Will he last that long?” he said, an edge of panic to his voice.
Dean chuckled. “No doubt. Claire's tough, and she's smart. Donna seems like she's all sunshine and rainbows, but put her in a tight spot and she's all steel.” he agreed. “Anyway, we're all loaded up. Jack is super proud to hold the title of navigator. He and Sam are nerding over the GPS as we speak. Just waitin' on you.” he said with a shrug.
“He was so pissed when you did it. But he was pretty proud too.” Dean said, frowning when Cas made a move that took all of his stones on the left side of the board.
“Earth was a paradise, back then. All of nature woven together like a tapestry, each stitch as important as the next. We angels would look down and marvel at the beauty of his creation. So few of us were allowed to step foot on this sphere. Every time I came here, it seemed the Earth had grown more beautiful since the last.” Cas reminisced.
Cas approached him, leaning in close, he whispered in his ear. “Besides, if you are going to brag, I’d better give you something better to brag about.” before walking over to meet Sam, snagging one of the room keys and walking over to one of the room, letting himself in.
“Oh, thank fuck. Let's never speak of this again, or I swear to god I will vomit. I'll even make sure I get it on you. Some of it might even get in your mouth.” said Charlie, bitterly.
“Yeah, yeah. Heard it all before. You won't do it, 'coz Dad would kick your ass, after I did.” Sam taunted back, pointing his fork at Deans face, clearly not intimidated by his older brother or his threats.
Dean silently groaned to himself. Cas was already changing into the clothes they had bought the day before. This week was going to be difficult alright.
Dean groaned. “Uh, I guess you can make up some flasks of coffee and some sandwiches for the road? Just make sure there's enough left for me to have a couple of cups once I'm outta the shower.” he suggested.
Cas paused as he gently placed a vinyl disc back into it's sleeve and looked at Dean. “I've noticed you do all of these things previously. You like things in a particular way and rarely deviate. Sam is the same, although he places all of his trinkets in a box, under his bed. You like to be able to see them. I assume that it comforts you when they are in your line of sight. I assume that Sam feels comfort with them hidden away, where they cannot be broken or taken.” he said, his voice soft and unsure. He looked away and to the floor as if he was worried that he had crossed a line somehow.
He held his cock in one hand and scratched at his rough beard with the other, he had abandoned shaving a while ago. He realized he probably looked feral. He was glad of the cold weather, sweating would amplify his Alpha scent and he was careful to always remain downwind to not give himself away. He contemplated taking yet another freezing cold bath in the river and felt his balls shrivel at just the thought of it.
Cas smiled and pointed to the chair by the fire. “I'm fine. This is actually the most comfortable I've been in months. You should probably sit down, Dean.” he said gently.
Cas stood up and approached cautiously. “Uh, Dean. We have a slight problem. Jack needs the bathroom.” he said, gesturing over to where Jack was squirming.
“Okay son, I think you'll end up wearing this if you try to feed yourself, so we're gonna do it together, okay?” he said gently, he looked as if he was expecting Sam to protest, so was a little surprised when none came. Sam just nodded, his logical mind overriding his pride.
“DEAN! Oh shit! You're hurt, I'm sorry. Oh my god, I can't believe it!” Sam babbled as he almost strangled Dean in an attempt to hug him.
Lying side by side on the floor they panted, getting their breath back and occasionally making eye contact and laughing again.
He sat up and drank the water as fast as the ice cubes allowed, draining the glass and dribbling a little water down the side of his neck. He grimaced and rubbed his eyes, trying to untangle his legs from the blanket now twisted around them. He realised that Cas must have covered him after all and rolled his eyes at the angels mother-henning. He swung his legs onto the floor and placed his elbows on his knees, running his hands through his slightly sweaty hair.
He took a brief look around the room without meeting anyone's eyes. “There is one last thing. You should know that Lucifer is my half brother, he fled our clan after he killed my parents when Hannah and I were six weeks old. My clan Alpha, Michael, is his twin.”
He crawled as close as he dared, just outside of the light, and untied the canvas bag, two of the snakes immediately slithered out and Castiel dropped the bag and stepped on the top to prevent the third from escaping. He roughly tied the bag and slung it over his shoulder. He had intended to release them all, but he might need a distraction to get back out. The snakes immediately began towards the warmth of the fire, instinct driving them to the heat.
“I don't mind taking one for the team.” drawled Jo, slyly. Her eyes slid to Dean and then she winked at Charlie.
“So, little one. Shall we look at a book together? I think I have one with pictures that might pass for interesting for someone your age.” said Cas reaching for the pile of books next to his bed. Selecting one that classified the local flora and fauna. It looked to be handwritten and drawn.
Dean sighed, running his fingers through Cas' hair absently “I know, I'm not ready for you to go either. I get how important it is, everybody will be in danger if you don't go. It's just really shitty timing, I'm gonna be laid up for the next few days with my heat, so I won't see you.”
“It's okay boy. You did good. Y'hear me? You did good. We got you back. Ya daddy would'a been so proud. I'm so proud of you, son.” Bobby crooned quietly into Deans ear as he gripped Dean in his own one armed hug, as he held the shotgun pointed to the ground with the other.
It had been the first time the Alphas had assaulted any of them that way. Until now the Omegas had assumed that sexual assault was off the cards, in case the “merchandise” was damaged. Now Dean realised that thinking that way had been naïve. Alistair had figured out that Dean had a self sacrificing streak a mile wide, the punishment had been just as much for him as it had been for Amy. He had tried to comfort her after the ordeal, but she had been inconsolable and had pushed him away, hoarsely shrieking at him that he shouldn't have interfered, that it was his fault.
“Yeah, that kinda sucks that once he gets better he has to leave to go straight into fighting a war. He's loyal and dedicated, I'll give him that.” said Dean sadly.
Cas was sandwiched between Jess and Dean as they huddled together, the spring afternoon was cool and the dry spell looked to be ending as the dark clouds gathered overhead. Dean was grateful for the canvas covering over the truck bed as they continued on towards Bobby's homestead. The sky opened just over an hour later, forcing the trucks to slow down to a crawl due to the reduced visibility and uneven road surface.
Dean snorted. “No, Cas. I trust you and everything, but it'll never not be creepy to watch someone sleep. No offence.” he said shaking his head.
Dean huffed and swallowed down a little more tea “Nah, it's just unusual to have this many Omegas under one roof durin' heat season. It's also the first time for her without her mate, that's gotta be hard on her. She might not go into heat at all though, some Omegas don't after their mate dies.” said Dean sadly.
“I told her already... knock it off! I'm asking him!...Anyway, as I was saying, I told her already, but she wants to hear it from you, it's okay if I bring a few people back with me, until they get on their feet, right? They got no place else to go.” said Dean, as Charlie wriggled impatiently.
“Dean? Hey, dude! Welcome back. You passed out for the worst of it, I don't really blame you. It took 'em three tries to set it properly. I almost passed out just watching.” she prattled as Dean fought another wave of nausea.
“Ohhh, you are gonna pay, Samantha. You won't need an Alpha anytime soon, 'cause the next thing going in your ass, is my foot” said Dean, as he made another unsuccessful grab for his brother.
“You are.” Cas agreed. He touched a sensitive patch on Deans face. “I may have to shave a little closer in future.” he said frowning.
Dean shook his head. “I noticed too. We uh, did some stuff, and I think he thinks he pushed me before I was ready. He’s feeling guilty.” he whispered, his face a little red.
“Pizza, excellent choice. Can't go wrong with that.” Dean agreed, taking a deep sniff of the food in front of him. “Whoa, this looks amazing.” Cas put the bowl of shaved parmesan on the table and both Sam and Dean took generous handfuls to sprinkle over their food.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Who’s gonna teach him? I only know how Dad taught us, and I don’t think Cas would be too impressed if I just throw the kid in the deep end.” he said with a grimace.
“Jess is gonna take off the splint later, I gotta wear a support bandage for a while, and she says I'm not allowed to push it. But, it means I can help Bobby put up the temporary shelter for the newcomers.” said Dean, who had never done well being idle.
He waited a little longer before picking up the canvas bag and half untying the knot that kept it closed.
Instincts making a decision for him, Cas threw back the blankets and grimaced in agony as he crawled out of the bed and onto the floor, the loose cotton pants he wore twisting around his legs and partially hindering his movement. Panting heavily, he crawled across the floor towards the chair holding Dean.
Dean threw the small hand shovel he had been digging with to one side and wiped his sweaty face with the bottom of his shirt. First thing this morning he'd got up and after drinking enough water to sink a battleship, he'd decided to work off his slight hangover. So, for the last few hours he'd been digging out a tree stump in order to clear the land that Bobby had earmarked for planting next year. The ground was still soft from yesterdays downpour and in places, completely waterlogged. Dean was caked in mud as he wasn't as dexterous with his left hand as he was his right, the cast making it impossible to do manual labour with his dominant hand. So far he'd made a mess and that was about it.
Sam looked at the angel and smiled. “It does. It absolutely does, Cas. I’m gonna need your help to get set up properly. Some of the books need translating into English and there are hundreds of files to go through.” he said grinning.
Cas was blushing furiously and he looked pissed. Dean suddenly remembered that Cas had super angelic hearing and blushed himself.
“He hurt you, I'm assuming you'd like a little payback. Take it.” said the stranger gravely. He stood over Alistair like a sentinel, ready to intervene. The bag had been tied and discarded, the snake was still writhing, furious at it's treatment.
Jack beamed as he scrambled out of the tent and sat near Sam who threw his arm around Jack shoulder. “I also had an idea for a net that can trap ghosts.” he said, a little more confidently. “And a demon trap that you can roll out and reuse.”
“I'm gonna tell you right now, that you misunderstood what you saw and heard, okay? You obviously missed the nuances to the conversation. When you walked out of that changing room, I was not disgusted by you.” he took a shaky breath.
Sam just laughed, singing 'Mr Sandman' as he left the room, closing the door behind himself with a soft click.
Furious barking came from inside the back of the house as Rumsfeld, Bobby's gigantic Rottweiler was finally alerted to visitors and bounded outside to investigate, still barking. Bobby chuckled, the damn dog had probably been sleeping in front of the wood burning stove in the kitchen again instead of doing his job as a guard dog. Better late than never he supposed as he raised a hand in greeting.
“I had to prove myself, take part in attacks. It turned my stomach when I saw first hand the things they did. But I needed to do it, so I could get close to the old man in charge. I wanted to look him in the eye when I killed him.” he screwed the hat up in his hands.
Jess hurried into the room as soon as Dean called, he found himself pushed aside as she finally got some medicine into her patient and between Jess and Sam they got Castiel back into bed where he promptly passed out.
Bobby came back and busied himself over the small fire, raking the coals and placing a small pan of broth on them. In no time it was steaming and he transferred it to a small bowl.
Jack pouted. “Aww. That sucks.” he whined. “Can I open my presents now?” he asked, his eyes lighting up even as he yawned widely.
Cas chewed his lip nervously. “May I hug you? Just as a friend, nothing more.” he reassured and Dean nodded, letting out a faint
“Hey, Sam. Would you mind sharin’ with Jack tonight? I need some time with Cas.” Dean asked his brother in a low voice as he climbed out of the car.
Dean shook his head. “Nah, I found one of those old fashioned ice-cream places. Figured we’d hit that up for dessert after we’re done here. Besides, I’m gonna try and cut back a bit. Maybe go for quality over quantity for a change.” he said with a shrug.
“I'm gonna need your help to get this boy comfortable. You do what I say, when I say it. No more, no less. One wrong move and I shoot you dead. You're just lucky I haven't shot you yet.” her voice was cold.
to save him. He's smart your brother, he pretends he's not, but he's one of the smartest people I know. He didn't betray you by pushing you through that trapdoor, he was ensuring that
Dean leaned in and dropped a soft kiss on Cas' mouth before sitting back. “Okay, so it was totally the best kiss ever. I just don't want you to get too smug about it.” he said primly.
Dean gave a look of mock offence. “Hey, I can be romantic. I’ll romance the shit out of you.” he said, laughing.
Cas cleared his throat awkwardly. “And you are sure that Hannah and I would be welcome in this new settlement?” he said carefully.
Dean hissed as Cas pushed him down flat and took a nipple into his mouth. “Fuck!” he breathed out. “I’m so turned on I’m gonna explode.” he whined.
Dean relaxed his posture slightly but still had a suspicious look on his face. “Why me? You could make friends with the other Alphas, why you gotta make friends with the only un-mated male Omega in the group?” he said, his eyes still narrowed at the Alpha next to him.
Cas chuckled, Jess was a genius, of course she would find a way around her own instincts. She looked apologetic for a second. “I can't do this for you I'm afraid. It could make you sneeze or cough and you could burst your stitches. We can't risk it, I'm sorry.” she said sadly. Cas just nodded. The poppy syrup was beginning to work and he felt the familiar fogginess starting to creep in. He began to sink down into his bed. Jess smiled “Looks like the medicine is kicking in, I'll check your wound and we'll clean and re-dress it with fresh bandages.” she said brightly. “Now, if I allow you some pants, will you promise me that you won't start wandering about? I will allow you small movements today, but still no trips outside to the bathroom, I'm afraid. Jo is moving her bedroll so you'll have a little privacy for that at least.” Cas nodded eagerly, he was not suited to enforced rest.
Cas nodded. “As part of a romantic relationship, yes? If you are not comfortable with that, I understand, and will never pressure you. I just want to be with you.” he said, his expression one of complete honesty.
Dean shook his head. “Cas, babe. He'll be fine. I hate that he's upset, but it's not the end of the world. He's overtired and full of sugar, his reaction was bound to be a little extreme.” he said, approaching his husband and son and wrapping his arms around both of them.
“You slept a whole day, hon. Had us worried for a bit, but Jess managed to get some water in you and you went right back to sleep. I'm guessin' you don't remember that?” said Ellen, standing and putting the kettle on the stove to make tea.
“Sorry, Dean. Claire was a little put out that we didn't invite her on our camping trip.” Cas said, looking apologetic.
Jack opened his eyes and sat up, with a wide fake yawn. “Daddy, I was asleep, but now I'm awake, can I see Santa?” he asked sweetly.
Sam threw the books he was holding onto the bed and flopped his 6ft 4in frame down next to them, running his hands through his long hair in exasperation and dropping his head into his hands, his long hair falling to to cover his face and his shoulders tight.
“Nah, we weren’t going fast, just started pulling on the wheel a bit so we pulled over, went completely flat after we stopped.” Dean explained.
Sam rolled his eyes at his brother and chuckled. “This is really good, Cas. Thanks for helping. Feel free to shop and cook whenever you like.”
Dean sagged back into Cas’ arms, completely spent. He winced as he felt a twinge of pain in his back and ass. Cas wrapped his arms around him, pressing the side of his face into the back of Deans shoulder.
Dean took a moment to explain the next part of the plan in a hoarse whisper “We're going out through Alistair's quarters, it ain't pretty and stinks real bad, so don't touch nothin'.” He smiled and looked at Cas who suddenly froze and turned wide panicked eyes at the group. From the corridor they could hear voices.
“Cas kissed me. We had a fight, then we agreed to take it slow.” he laughed out. “Yeah, that’s about it.” he laughed again, suddenly finding himself unable to stop.
Cas looked thoughtful. “Since Jack arrived in our lives I have been trying to give him experiences outside of hunting. He is so young still, I want him to enjoy living in the world that we save on a regular basis. In doing so, I am experiencing these things for myself. Jody and I took the younger ones bowling last night. It was.. interesting.” he said, taking a sip of his beer.
Jess finally finished her examination and stood in the centre of camp looking tense and spoke loud enough for everyone to hear.
“Well, why didn't you say so?” yelled Bobby, as Sam took off at a sprint towards the house, quickly followed by Jess and Bobby.
“I feel like a child being put to bed after a tantrum.” he griped, then laughed at the absurdity of the situation.
Jack screwed up his face as he considered Dean's answer. “So, one day you will be Santa?” he asked hesitantly.
He couldn't understand where these feelings had come from. They had been best friends for a decade and now suddenly Dean was hot for the angel? He'd seen Cas in other clothes before, hell, he'd seen the guy naked. Although the massive swarm of bees had taken up the majority of his attention at the time, admittedly.
The familiar terrain held no excitement, merely trepidation for what was to come. The mist that he once thought beautiful, now looked eerie. The valley walls that he once found security in, now felt like they were pressing in and suffocating him. He found himself longing for the sounds and smells of the forest that surrounded Singers homestead. He considered it home, the mountains were simply where he was born and lived until now.
Cas immediately obeyed his sons command. Running the flat of his hand up and down Jacks back until he began to drift off again as Dean and Cas stared at each other lovingly.
Mary looked at him in amazement. “I didn’t know angels could blush. I’ve never seen you so self conscious, Cas.” she said with a chuckle. “The clothes suit you, you look great.” she complimented.
Dean bristled and stared incredulously at his giant brother before looking around the decaying room, furniture barely holding together, stained carpet and wallpaper peeling and faded to the point that there was no discernible pattern.
“We're all good, Cas. We miss you too. Sam is being a bitch as always, but no, no signs yet. It'll be a few weeks before we know for sure. The dorm is almost done. It's a little rough, but it's not supposed to be a palace. It'll be done before you get back. Any idea when that'll be?” said Dean, trying hard not to sound excited, under the circumstances it would be disrespectful and selfish.
, right?” said Dean, watching with interest as Cas crumbled some cheese from the bag into the bread and ignoring Charlie's knowing look at Dean.
Dean shifted uncomfortably, picking at his fingernails and chewing his lip until Sam left the room, when he finally met the angels eyes.
“Well, we can't have that, your majesty. So a bath it is.” said Dean, pulling the blanket up around his ears.
“What did I do now?” Dean sighed, sitting up from where he had been sprawled on the other bed, one arm over his eyes to block out the harsh afternoon sunlight streaming in the single window of the room in the abandoned motel in Ohio.
This chapter was supposed to be on the end of the last chapter, but it went better on its own in my opinion.
Castiel leaned against the wall at the back of the room, arms crossed over his chest trying to be unobtrusive, listening to the other Alphas of the clan arguing and posturing. He didn't want to be here, no-one was listening to anyone else, just shouting over each other. He never bothered to join in, someone would inevitably bring up his status as an Alpha with no Omegas and allude to Castiel being “unable to perform”. Then others would join in until the entire clan would be jeering at him. It didn't matter what he said, they would mock him for never taking an Omega. He didn't want to
“Tell Michael to come when he is able. I have news for him.” said Castiel quietly. The beta nodded and scurried off towards Michael's quarters.
“Your sister had a similar reaction, although she aimed very much lower than you did. I believe she also gave Gabriel a black eye. Although, that might have been his mate, she's a bit of a handful that one.” he said, wincing and dabbing at his lip again.
Cas looked momentarily taken aback, then grinned wolfishly. “I see. That’s something we can talk about, absolutely.” he said, looking eager. “Now, lets get a shower. I want to hold you while you sleep.” he said bossily, standing up from the bed, holding his hands out towards Dean.
“I estimate two days journey, three at most. There are places we should avoid. Once we can find some shelter for tonight, we'll firm up a plan then. Everyone ok with that?” said Cas looking around at everyone as they all nodded in agreement.
In the truck, Dean had managed to radio Bobby and Sam, the conversation was a difficult one. He struggled through a brief and vague description of his time as a prisoner and refused to go into detail even when pushed, Bobby and Sam eventually backed off, knowing Dean would cut the conversation short otherwise. Dean did describe the escape in detail however. Charlie gasped as Dean described Cas disabling Alistair with a rattlesnake in a bag and squealed outright as he mentioned them dumping Alistair in the pit to die slowly. It was the first time she had heard the story and she was overjoyed at the poetic justice Alistair had received. Bobby and Sam were similarly impressed and insisted that Dean tell them again in more detail when he got home.
“That’s quite alright, Castiel. I was a married woman, I know what couples get up to, and I’m no prude.” she said teasingly. Dean laughed even harder as Cas’ eyes almost bulged out of his head.
“So. I take it you both talked? Figured some stuff out, I hope?” she said, sitting down at the tiny table against the wall and opening the box of donuts.
Dean stopped and turned, his mouth dropping open in surprise. “Did you just sass me?” he barked angrily.
Everyone had settled into chairs or on the floor, their attention fully on the Alpha who looked uncomfortable.
Dean shifted from foot to foot looking down. “Well, we figured you'd want to get there quick. It'll make it easier for you to ..uh..come back too. What with you bringin' Hannah and all your stuff. I left the radio in there so you can still call us and let us know how you're doin'.” he stuck a toe in the dirt “Y'know, if you want to, 'cause we'd worry about you otherwise. He said, avoiding Cas' eyes.
Sam looked grim. “I get that. But it doesn’t all have to come out at once, Dean. We have time.” he said encouragingly.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed. He stepped up to the truck, grabbing it just behind the wheel arch and lifting the entire truck a few inches with a squeal of metal, his muscles barely flexing with the effort.
Dean nodded gratefully. “So, if I was to Google some stuff to help me figure this out, what would be the best way to do that, without getting a shit ton of porn? Not sure I'm ready for
” he chuckled and continued in his normal voice “The only Alphas that think that, are the Alphas that have never got their knot wet. Anyone else knows Omegas in heat don't go crazy. Cranky, yes. Crazy, no.” Both boys giggled and began to tuck into the meal on the table.
Matthew squealed and broke out into baby chatter as if he was giving his own version of events and Cas nodded along. “Oh yes, the book was interesting wasn't it? Of course I'll ask Bobby if he has any others.” he said seriously to the small child, who smiled , showing off his four teeth and batting the Alphas arm excitedly.
Cas held up a hand to stop her. “I have to tell you all something, there are some things I haven't told you, and I'm afraid... I'm afraid you will ask me to leave anyway once you know everything.” he said, looking at the ground. The silence was deafening.
Cas stopped and turned to him with a raised eyebrow and a head tilt. “You need sleep, Dean. I am merely going to help you achieve that. Will you accept my help or not?” he asked, giving Dean the choice.
“It’s gonna be like pin the tail on the donkey, but with rocks and cans. You put on the blindfold, I spin you around and then you try to nail the can with a rock, okay?” he said, untying his shirt from around his waist and hanging it on the trucks mirror.
“Yeah, I do. Doesn't mean I think he did the right thing. Joining them? That was...I don't know what that was. Not sane, that's for sure. But I can certainly empathise with the guy. Hell, we all can.” said Ellen, bitterly.
Sam looked over at Cas who wasn’t doing a very good job of pretending he wasn’t watching. “I think you both are. You two are gonna be sickening, I just know it. You guys got what it takes to make it, you know? I call dibs on giving you away at your wedding.” he said, pointing a finger at Dean.
Sam chuckled. “All this talk of food and you don't even eat, Cas. Do you miss it, or something?” he asked, straining the noodles and serving them in the bowls.
Sam and Jess both took on slightly panicked expressions at the mention of a nursery, and Bobby chuckled. “Don't tell me, I have to explain how it all works to you young'uns.” his eyes twinkled in mischief this time “Now, when an Alpha and an Omega love each other very much...”
Cas picked up his small backpack and put it on his back, pushing both arms through the straps and frowning at Dean who was trying to suppress a laugh.
It was an effective punishment an an excellent deterrent for errant behaviour. All of the Omegas had been in the pit at least once. Dean had been in the pit several times, he fought at first, punching and kicking until he was beaten into half unconsciousness. Dean realised quickly that blood from his wounds attracted the rats, which in turn attracted the snakes. Stopping the rats from gnawing at him while mostly incapacitated after a beating was almost impossible. He stopped fighting after that, no longer willing to spend his time in the pit continuously fighting off the disgusting creatures inside.
“Awww! Thanks man! I'm so glad Dad didn't listen when I asked for a pony instead of a brother.” joked Dean as he sat at the table. “Asshat.” said Sam, grinning at his brother as he too sat down.
“No, most of them are just watching Sam and Dean gag and heave their way through cleaning up the truck. The idiots could have got themselves killed, they kept everyone awake last night and then they bitched at everyone all day. So no-one has much sympathy for them.” said Jess, her eyes twinkling.
“It was all scary. I was terrified the whole time. But Cas slept like a baby, he hasn't even stirred. Y'know, he doesn't even snore? It actually got a little creepy.” admitted Dean, used to sharing a room with Sam who snored like a wounded bear.
“We all do. We all helped too, it was Dean's idea though. If you want my opinion, I think you'll love it.” she said winking and picking up the bag from the table. “Have fu-unn!” she sing-songed and abruptly left the room.
He sniffed himself and shrugged, not too bad. He doubted either of the others would mind his slight musk. Maybe once he had some food in him, he'd have enough energy to take a quick shower before bed. The two hours he'd just gotten was clearly not enough. But he also knew the exhaustion he felt was not just from lack of sleep.
“Uriel was working for Lucifer, yes, but he was playing both sides. His brother, Raphael started it, he wanted a war between Michael and Lucifer, he planned to have them fight it out to the death and who ever won was going to be bumped off and dear old Rafe was going to mop up the spoils.” he sighed deeply
“I'm sure you will eventually, so I have refrained from pushing too hard. But.. this is not about that.”
The Alphas would be sharing Sam's old room upstairs and the Omegas took over the panic room in the basement. Ellen had looked over it with a critical eye before reluctantly giving Bobby a thumbs up. Dean still had his own room and Garth had merely dusted and put fresh sheets on the bed.
Sam handed the mic over to Bobby, who cleared his throat and spoke into the mic “Dean? I'm here, son. Don't you worry about me, ya idjit. You just come home as quick as you can, you hear me? We'll be waitin'.” Bobby handed the mic back to Sam, who added “Dean? We love you. Call me later, okay?”
“Food. Medicine. Sleep. No arguments, Dean. I'll wake you when Cas is up to company.” and went back to her patient.
Dean blinked awake, his eyes felt gritty and his mouth was dry. He unglued his tongue from the roof of his mouth and pushed himself up on his elbows to see a glass of water on the night stand next to the bed. The ice in it hadn't melted yet, so he assumed that whoever had left it (probably Cas) had only just left again.
He shook his head. No wonder they left no tracks and made no sound. The reason he hadn't put it together was the larger map didn't show the more minor tributaries. Now he knew how they were travelling, he had a fair idea of where they were. He groaned when he realised Michael would not take it well.
“Thank you, Ellen. I wanted to thank you for washing and mending my clothes. You didn't have to do that.” said Cas, taking a mouthful of the delicious food in front of him.
Sam laughed. “Oh, damn. I haven’t seen Tootsie since we were kids.” he said, picking up a slice of pizza.
Sam snorted. “Nah, not these days.” he agreed. “I’m gonna get in the shower, there’s a list of local places to eat on the counter. Pick something we’re not gonna get a lot of for the next week or so.” he said, getting up from the chair and heading for the bathroom.
With a pointed look from Jess, Sam caved. “Okay, but we're staying right outside the door.” he said, clearly not happy.
They had arrived at the camp site in the late afternoon, Jo had taken over driving after a couple of hours and Charlie had agreed to act as shotgun and map reader, Dean and Cas had climbed into the back of the truck with Amy and both had promptly fallen into a dead sleep side by side, only waking when Amy shook them awake as they got close to their chosen camp site.
Dean dipped his head and took one of Cas’ nipples in to his mouth, sucking on it gently and Cas gasped.
He jumped when a large black and brown blur bounded around the corner, barking furiously and almost opened fire before realising it was Rumsfeld. Bobby's enormous rottweiller. Who was now decorating Sam's face with slobbery kisses. He began to sob with relief as the man himself appeared.
For what seemed like hours the rest of the group tried to keep themselves occupied, it was hard to sleep, but everyone tried. At best they managed short cat naps in between pacing or playing card games. All of them trying their hardest to ignore what was going on behind the tarp. None of them felt particularly hungry, except for baby Matthew who was happily gnawing a small piece of cheese that Bobby had brought with the supplies. His chubby baby hands were covered in a mixture of drool and cheese and he squealed in delight when Charlie recoiled in disgust when he tried to share it with her. They talked lowly amongst themselves, trying to block out the low murmuring of Jess giving instructions to Ellen and Amy.
The group sat in silence, all of them could empathise with Benny's story, they were unwilling to interrupt.
“We're gonna stop at Bobby's for a week or so to stock up on dry goods and get a rundown of possible rogue clan movements, then Rufus knows of a place in the wilds that has an intact fishing cabin we can hole up in for winter. The roads will be impassible by mid-November until March with the winter snows. So, there should be no clan movement up there. We should be good until Spring.” said John as he checked the bags quickly before swinging one up on his shoulder as Dean and Sam did the same.
“There, that's gotta be better, huh? Nothin' worse than dry mouth.” crooned Dean as Cas slumped back down and Dean screwed the flask shut.
Dean sighed. He’d hoped to get a few more days to think about what he wanted to say. But Mary was right, leaving Cas hanging wasn’t fair. “Alright, I know you’re right. But..”
Cas disappeared behind the curtain and Dean looked around as he waited, catching Jakes eye and giving the older man an awkward wave.
Some much needed fluff. Family fun for everyone! In which Cas has to give Jack "the talk" because Sammy is too chicken to do it. Dean is more infatuated with Cas than he realised and Jack learns a lesson in moderation.
He had also improved trading relations with the plains settlements and had personally brokered deals that ensured a mutually beneficial outcome. He had a reputation as a tough, but fair negotiator. In just 5 years he had improved the clan's status from near starvation to the wealthiest clan in the region in regards to resources.
Dean thought back over what had been said and he realised where it had all gone wrong. He might have to make a small confession after all.
“Oh, sorry. I guess not having any home cooked meals for a while made me forget my manners.” said Benny sheepishly.
“I've never seen anything like this. How do you all fit in there?” said Cas, a sceptical look on his face.
Sam’s eyes bugged out of his head in surprise, but he wisely said nothing, sipping on his coffee and smiling to himself.
“How's Cas doin'?” he said quietly. Charlie looked grim. “They got the knife out, and bandaged the wound. He passed out too. Ellen's with him now, trying to clean him up a bit.” she said with a grimace.
Bobby cleared his throat, getting Cas' attention. “Before we even knew about you or your mission, we had a plan of our own to form a militia. Like, an alliance with other clans to protect ourselves from raiders. I figure the more we know, the better prepared we'll be. I ain't sayin' that your plan ain't gonna work, I'm just a real big believer in havin' a plan B.” he said, gruffly.
“Bobby, I...we...Dad is...Dean...” Sam couldn't get the words out, his stomach lurched threateningly and he fought to keep the vomit down.
He would lower them on a cradle down the well shaft with the warning that if they didn't step out of the cradle, he would cut the ropes and they would stay down there forever. It varied however long they were kept there, in complete darkness, listening to the scurrying and squeaking of the rats and jumping at a real or imagined touch from the animals. The only light would be a lantern attached to the cradle that was lowered when it was time to be taken out.
Sam looked over at where Cas was making sure Jacks hair was properly dried. “I’m sorry, okay. I was a jerk. I’ll do whatever it takes to help you guys. This is the only family we’ve got, I wanna keep it together. We didn’t fight all of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory only to lose it now” he said, looking determined.
“Okay. Before we get to your brakes, I want to clear the air, we're about to go on a family camping trip and something's going on with you. You've barely said a word since the store and you look miserable. Did I do something wrong? Is it what Kitty said? You're my best friend, man. After what you said the other night about noticing stuff, I realised I should be doin' the same for you. When I said I need a break, I meant from bullshit, not just the life.” he said, looking at the angel.
Dean chuckled. “They knew what they were gettin’ into, you made them no promises, they didn’t make any either. It’s two lonely people just takin’ comfort in each other. As long as everyone is on board, it’s not wrong, Cas. I’d be a massive hypocrite if I said it was.”
Cas rolled his eyes at Deans dramatics. “I promise I'll avenge your death, Dean.” he said gravely, suppressing another laugh.
He chose his favourite shirt, a long sleeved loose cotton shirt that Hannah had made him a few years ago. It was soft with age and faded and had several repairs, but he loved it. Picking it up with the rest of his clothes as well as his wash bag, he made his way to the kitchen.
“Put our things in the room Jack. I’ll join you in a moment, we’ll watch some cartoons together.” Cas promised.
Benny shrugged. “He's strong, and stubborn. Hell, he managed to kill that sonovabitch with a blade in him. If we keep him calm and still, then yeah, I think he might.” he drawled. “Maybe that medic can give us some advice, they'd know more than me anyhow.”
“Uh..” stalled Sam, looking like a startled deer. Jess looked nervous, and moved nearer to Sam in a protective gesture, poised ready to fight.
“He one of those special kids? The ones with the autism? I got a nephew like that, sweetest kid ever. Me and the missus were never blessed with kids, but we love my brothers boy like our own.” he said lowly.
“Oh, it looks like Jack is a good boy after all, Santa. He went right to sleep like we asked him to. I guess he'll be disappointed he didn't get to meet you though. What a shame.” said Daddy, with a sigh and a sad look.
Dean grinned. “I've got a couple of rods that my uncle Bobby gave me and his ancient tackle box. I might have a look at your stuff, I'm thinking we have to catch our dinner at least once to make it a real authentic camping trip, right?” he said enthusiastically, slapping Cas on the shoulder.
Dean shrugged bashfully. “Cas, you're fucking gorgeous, alright? Honestly, that's not the part that's tripping me up. It's the fact you're my best friend.” he said, pushing his hands into his pockets.
As Sam spoke, Dean could feel his own anger growing. He dropped the shovel again and whirled around and got up into his brothers face.
“He's at the truck, I wanted to make sure it was safe first. Let's go get him together.” said Bobby pointing back the way he came and trying to blink away his own tears. “That boy's been twitchier than a dog with fleas all day. He's been so excited.” He kept his arm around Deans shoulders as he turned them both to walk back towards the truck, as if he was afraid to let Dean go in case he disappeared.
Michael had broken him faster than all of the demons in hell had managed. He had taken his greatest triumph and turned it into a waking nightmare that he had been powerless to stop. The worst of it was, he only had himself to blame. Cas had tried to warn him, and Dean had accepted the risk that the archangel might try to betray them. But he had been completely unprepared for the overwhelming presence of Michael. His will had left Dean a ruin of himself. He could feel it, the absence of... something. He couldn't even name what
“You've been talking to Claire, she always fills your head with this crap!” Dean burst out, his fury evident by his red face and his gritted teeth.
“What? Are you telling me, that the all powerful angel of the lord, can’t swim?” Dean asked incredulously, taking his eyes off the road momentarily.
Cas shrugged. “I hoped you were attracted to me. A crush is something else entirely. I didn't realise it was as serious as that.” he said shyly.
Cas moved around the table and stood in front of Dean, he seemed to study him for a moment before shaking his head and placing two fingers on Deans temple.
“Now who might you be, chief?” the large Alpha drawled, looking unconcerned, despite the fact he had a shotgun pointed at him.
“We gotta stop meetin' like this, dude. Never known an Alpha that was such a hugger. Well, except Garth.” he quipped, making Cas laugh and then grunt in pain.
Dean felt a twitch in his cock and his eyes lit up at the thought of Cas holding him down and covering his mouth as he fucked him. “That’s an idea too.” he agreed, winking at Cas. “I’ve got a few ideas along those lines, actually.”
Now, are we done with the death threats, or can I see my patients now?” said Jess, smartly, reaching down to kiss Sam on his forehead and then turning away to pick up her supplies.
“Exactly. So if you would just get out of my way, I'd like to leave.” Cas said, a little anger in his tone.
He had watched from the distance for days to establish the guard rotations and patrol patterns. They were like clockwork. The patrols never varied, same guards, same times, day in, day out.
Cas frowned. “This is where I can purchase camping supplies, is it not?” he asked, tilting his head in confusion.
“Jess, we can't understand you. What's going on?” shouted Sam, utterly bemused at Jess with her uncharacteristic excitement.
Cas nodded sadly. “I understand. It's not ideal, but I understand. Thank you, Jess. You saved my life.” he said earnestly, trying to make up for his earlier outburst.
“Surely you know about your prostate, Dean. It is very pleasurable when it is stimulated. It is actually possible for a man to achieve orgasm several times in a row that way.” Cas said in a low voice, doing something weird to Deans insides. He felt his dick twitch in his pants and his heart rate pick up. Male multiple orgasms? Dean had never heard anything so awesome.
“Well, we know those ones fit. So I'll grab another set and we'll get out of here, huh?” Dean changed the subject instead and gathered up the discarded clothes, hurriedly putting clothes back on hangers and separating those to keep and discard.
The Omegas had all been sleeping, but had woken at the door opening, terrified that Alistair was paying them a surprise visit. They were all in their beds, half sat up and confusion written on their faces and Dean hurried to shush them before they could begin asking questions. He turned to see Cas closing the door and taking up a guard position.
Cas took pity on him. “Jack, masturbation is normal and healthy, but it can cause embarrassment to people when brought up outside of a private conversation.” he chided mildly.
Jake laughed. “Man after my own heart. Just eat the little ones though, big ones got mercury in 'em. You gonna do a trip to the coast too? Maybe get yerself a lobster or two? Went up that way with my grandson last year, ate lobster rolls and drank fancy wine till they had to roll me on home.” he laughed as Dean and Cas both shrugged. “Ain't nothin' wrong with splashin' out now and again. But spendin' time with yer family is priceless.” he said looking at Cas. “Yer boy'll be happy that you're makin' the effort for him. These'll be the memories he'll be lookin' back on when he has his own family.” he looked a little wistful.
“It’s no problem, you just let me know if you need anything else.” he said, dashing off with their order.
Dean sighed again. “Well, I'm certainly all over the map today. Are you sure you're up for this, Cas? Think you can cope with someone as strung out as me for the rest of your days? He said, jokingly.
Dean suddenly remembered Sam's comment about 'riding off into the sunset' and looked over at Charlie as she seemed to remember the same thing. She grinned and Dean blushed.
He approached Cas, who stood facing the cans, squinting at them and tilting his head as if studying them, at the last moment he turned to look at Dean, who suddenly felt shy under the angels gaze. He felt himself flush and his mouth dried as he stood almost chest to chest with the man who occupied most of his thoughts these last few days.
Dean pressed a shaky hand to Cas cock, feeling it through the swim shorts, amazed at how similar it was to his own, how not weird it felt. Cas closed his eyes, biting his lip.
Dean grunted an answer, swinging his legs out of the tent and shoving his feet into his boots. He shivered in the chilly air and grabbed his shirt from the floor of his tent, shoving his arms in and straightening the collar. He groaned as he stood up, staggering over to where Cas sat on the log by the fire, flopping down next to him and shoving his face into Cas’ chest. “Nightmare, shoulda just let you knock me out again.” he mumbled as Cas put an arm around him comfortingly.
Dean sagged in defeat, the anger bled out of him and he looked sad. “Did he really kill your parents?” he said softly.
Dean took a deep breath. “Okay.” he said then groaned. “Ugh, I have no idea what to say. This is so far out of my wheelhouse, it ain’t funny.”
Cas nodded and began gathering up a few items. He lifted his trench coat from where it was laid on the bed and rummaged in the pockets, producing his wallet, keys and a charger cord. He picked up the small backpack that held the few items of clothing he had and carefully folded his new wind breaker into it, he put his phone into the pocket of his shirt and his wallet into his back pocket and looked up to see Dean staring at him, he flushed self consciously and Dean looked away guiltily.
“It's been a while since I felt safe enough to sleep comfortably, I guess I'm trying to catch up.” Dean admitted quietly, not meeting Castiels eyes.
Dean's head swayed on his shoulders as he turned to face his brother. “S'not what I asked.” he said a little aggressively.
interesting, boy. Not just the useful bits. Some of the other stuff has a history we can only guess at. I like trying to figure out what that is.” said Bobby, smiling into his beard, before adding wryly “if you promise to close yer mouth when you chew for the rest of this meal, I'll take you out there tomorrow and we can have a look for anything that takes yer fancy” Dean had the decency to blush when John and Sam laughed outright as Bobby continued, muttering “Damn' boy looks like one of my goats chewin' on a dandelion”. Sam was still shaking with silent laughter as Dean frowned and John snorted into his beer.
Cas scoffed “ That can't be true. You're just saying that.” he said with clear disbelief on his face.
I'm so sorry to have left this for so long! I do have a real reason for it, I dislocated my shoulder (several times, it's a thing now) and I managed to damage the nerve severely, making my arm and hand virtually unusable. It's my dominant hand, so you can probably imagine, it's been a little rough for me. I've been put on meds to combat the nerve pain and the numbness, and it helps, but leaves me a little dopey. I may need surgery, but I hope not.
A strange look passed over Cas' face before his expression shut down and he looked down at the food on his plate.
“Okay, but I swear Dean, we are going to talk tomorrow. No more avoiding this.” he threatened before walking to his room.
Dean grinned. “Bug bites aside, I love camping, Cas. Wakin' up first thing and getting warm by the fire with a cup of coffee. Fishin' all day, then cookin' your catch. Swimmin' in the lake and sunbathing on the rocks. Makin' smores. Lookin' up at the stars. I'm a bit old to be sleepin' on the ground these days, but hell yeah, I love camping. When I ain’t gotta worry about a wendigo or something.” he said enthusiastically.
“Both. To be honest. Sam's cooking is okay, he just likes his food on the bland side. I'll add some salt and it'll be fine.” said Dean, just before he hissed in pain as Jess unwrapped his arm.
Sam swam up to the side of the pool and rested his arms on the lip. “No, there’s a ladder just over there, Jack, look.” he said pointing to the corner of the pool at the shallow end. “I’ll swim over and meet you there.” he said, kicking off the side, his huge arms pulling him through the water smoothly.
“Cas? It's me. Bobby's cool with that. It's fine.” said Dean, looking up to see Bobby ushering everyone out and closing the door.
“It's no excuse though, is it? You don't get angry and take it out on me or Cas, do you? I don't see Cas smashing the place up when things don't go his way. I can't keep doin' this, man. I just can't.” Dean said, looking defeated.
A week after the group had arrived at Bobby's, Dean was serving breakfast and the entire household were gathered, talking loudly over one another and passing plates of food back and forth, when the kitchen door opened slowly.
Dean chuckled. “Jakes right. We'd better get you something a bit more suited to camping.” he agreed.
Dean walked over to Cas and put his arms around him. “I’m sorry.” he said, pressing a kiss to Cas’ cheek, right by his ear. Cas remained stiff, not responding to Deans ministrations.
The sun finally decided to make an appearance, sunlight pouring over the horizon and painting the wispy clouds orange. Dean closed his eyes and basked in the glow, cradling his coffee in his hands.
, I left everything I'd ever known in order to achieve it.” he stepped closer to Sam, who shrank back from the anger radiating from the angel. “You believe in it fervently, until its convenient to forget it.” Cas growled out through gritted teeth.
Between Sam, Jess and Garth they managed to get Castiel inside to Bobby's library, where he would be sleeping for the for the time being. Bobby showed everyone where they would be sleeping, giving Garth a pat on the back as he passed by as thanks for all his hard work.
“I thought it would be too much, that he deserved more than seeing me work on getting better. He deserves someone who isn’t as messed up as me.” he said, as he killed the engine.
Sam shook his head and looked over at Jack who looked bewildered. “Come on Jack. It’s just us for dinner tonight.” he said, looking tired. “But first we’re switching rooms to one at the other end of the motel.”
Mary shrugged. “I thought it was common knowledge. When I first saw you together, well, I thought you were
Bobby narrowed his eyes slightly “That's just it, what were you doing there in the first place? It's these 'original intentions' that have got me concerned.” he said gruffly.
Sam began to move the packed duffles towards the door, ready to be loaded into the car at a moments notice.
Dean put the wine glasses in the dishwasher and switched in on before checking the coffee machine was set for the morning. Cas was a mess in the mornings and Dean wasn't much better. Since having Jack, they'd both had to make a massive adjustment to their morning schedules and having fresh brewed coffee first thing helped them cope with a lively four year old.
He was cut off when Cas kissed him suddenly. In his surprise, he found himself kissing back before his brain kicked in. Cas kissed just like he did everything else, single minded, ruthless and devastating. When Dean’s back hit the side of the truck he barely noticed, his world had narrowed down to the way Cas pressed against him and the clever tongue tangling with his own, his toes curling as Cas poured his whole being into the kiss.
Dean shrugged. “I guess I want the same things. I wanna fall asleep next to you. Wake up with you there. Show you things, learn stuff I never knew. I kinda wanna touch you too.” he confessed shyly.
Dean huffed a laugh. “We'll all load up together, that way we all know where everything is.” he said, clapping the boy on the shoulder. “Saves any of us scrabbling around in the dark looking for torch batteries or toilet paper.” he added, from experience.
Dean ignored him for a moment, his big brother instincts telling him to annoy Sam as much as possible, just for the sake of it. It never got old, no matter that they were grown men with the tiniest hint of grey to their hair and beards. Dean fully intended to annoy his brother when they were shrivelled old men, if they lived that long.
“Good. If all goes well today, we are going to head back to Bobby's tomorrow. It all depends on you. The journey is going to be hard on you so my plan is to dose you up and you'll sleep for most of the trip. Bobby wants all of the injured in his truck as it's the most reliable vehicle. Everyone else will be in the other truck. We're hoping that we can do the journey in one go.” Jess explained as she set up her things next to Cas' bed. That sounded like a solid plan to Cas. He sat still as Jess carefully examined him, answering all of her questions and complying with all of her requests. She finished re-bandaging his wound and smiled. “No sign of infection, you're healing really fast, if you keep going at this rate, you'll be back on your feet properly in a month.”
They were both helpless with laughter, made worse when Bobby stepped out on to the porch with an annoyed expression and a muttered “Idjits.” before rolling his eyes and going back inside.
Ellen jumped up, placing the kettle on the stove again and making tea for everyone. Amy excused herself to go and find where Garth had got to with her son.
His approach had been novel in that he had encouraged the Betas and Omegas to help him turn the barren landscape surrounding the settlement into several small holdings, each responsible for growing specific crops or raising animals. Large greenhouses built from scavenged glass, taken from the abandoned cities or towns, protected the crops from the harsh frosts that would have destroyed them otherwise. Some crops were still impossible to grow here, but what they could grow, they traded with the settlements on the plains for the food and medicine they needed.
Dean was even more confused “So you're not here to rescue us Omegas?” he said, perplexed. “What the actual fuck are you even doing here, man?”
Deans heartbeat thudded in his ears and he felt sick with anticipation, he prayed that this was not some cruel joke being played by Alistair. He sensed rather than saw the cradle coming down the shaft, the darkness preventing him from judging it's exact position. He stood back slightly and held out his arm to steady the cradle as it breached the bottom of the well shaft. He called out as quietly as he could to alert the person above to stop the winch, it stopped almost immediately.
Cas broke the hug first, although his face showed that it was reluctantly. “I suppose we'd better get on the road. I promised Jack pancakes and it's almost nine thirty. I didn't mean to hold us up for so long.” he said, looking guilty.
“Cas, I need time. This is new for me, I'm gonna be honest with you about everything, okay? We'll take some time, just you and me. See if we can figure this thing between us out. I've already figured a few things out. Like, I've probably been attracted to you for longer than I thought.” he admitted.
Amy looked at Ellen who had lost her angry expression at some point halfway through Benny's story and was looking thoughtful.
Charlie looked slightly awed at the turn of events. “You did, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.” she smiled happily and continued “So, Bobby and Sam seem pretty awesome, I can't wait to meet them in person.”
Dean chose four pairs of jeans of varying designs and sizes and dumped them into Cas' arms, before moving on to a rail of flannels. He dug through them, pulling several out and turning around to see that Cas had wandered off again to look at a crossbow hung on the wall.
“I'm Jake, and I'm happy to help ya. So, you gonna be doin' any fishin' on this trip? I got a sale on rods and tackle at the moment.” he offered.
Cas panicked and grabbed the back of Deans shirt, pulling him out from where Dean effectively had his head in Cas' lap whilst reaching to the floor. “Eyes on the road, Dean!” he growled as Dean tugged the wheel sharply to the left to correct the drift. “I thought you said you could drive?” snapped Cas.
I played around with POV and switching scenes back and forth in this chapter, I hope it worked. I don't go into the characters heads too much as I want it to read like an episode. We don't get to see the thought process in canon, and it leaves a lot to interpretation.
The Alphas watched her go and waited in silence as she scrambled out of sight only to reappear a minute or so later with Dean shuffling behind her.
An hour later found the little family all fast asleep in the big bed, Cas and Jack both lying on their backs, one arm above their head and the other down their pyjama pants, identical even in sleep, and Dean lying on his front, drooling into his pillow as the snow fell silently outside the window.
Dean had a dopey look on his face every time he looked at the angel. Cas had smiled more in the last few hours than Sam had seen him smile in the last decade. It made Sam’s own chest ache a little, no matter how happy he was for them.
An extremely obese cop climbed out of the car with what seemed like great difficulty. He took a large handkerchief from his pocket and began dabbing his face and bald head with it as he approached Dean who had remained standing. His heavy panting breaths sounded laboured as he waddled around the back of the truck.
“I talked to my Mom about you. She’s happy about it.” Dean said, loving the way Cas’ expressions were so clear as he smiled happily.
Speaking of which, I started a new fic! It's a fantasy AU with Kings, magic and political intrigue, epic battles and mysteries. I have the first chapter done, and it's over 7000 words. Yikes. It's called Magik Unbound, I really hope some of you will like it. Keep an eye out for it, I'll start posting it soon.
It was Bobby's turn to roll his eyes. “I said so, didn't I? We'll find somethin' for you to do. What was you did in your clan anyway?” he said gruffly.
They sat in silence, unwilling to ruin the peace of the last few days just yet by blaring Led Zeppelin from Baby’s speakers. Dean drove along the track carefully, cursing under his breath occasionally as he steered around the deepest ruts. Once they were on the logging road, Sam turned in his seat to face Dean with an expectant look.
Jack had a sharpened stick and was digging a football sized rock out of the ground, Dean had tripped over it twice as they were setting up camp, so Jack had taken it upon himself to relocate the rock somewhere out of the way. Sam chuckled as Jack accidentally flicked a clod of mud into his own face.
Eventually Amy staggered out from behind the tarp, she looked exhausted. Everyone turned to look at her.
Thank you for the lovely comments and support after my story was stolen. Wattpad have now deleted it and blocked the user. Again, if anyone sees this posted elsewhere, can you let me know? The user certainly doesn't have my permission.
“Nah, they’re over the moon.” Dean reassured. “She gave me some advice. It made sense. She said we should talk, that I couldn’t expect you to just guess how I’m feeling. So, I’m gonna try to do that, okay?” he said, squeezing Cas’ hand.
“Okay, kissing it is, and maybe a little over the clothes action this time.” Dean flirted with a wink.
“How many trips will we have to make to haul all this shit?” Dean asked, opening Baby’s trunk and checking the food they’d bought on the way in.
Cas gave a sad smile. “More like personal experience. Our parents died when Hannah and I were babies. For years we were treated like 'poor unfortunate orphans' by the whole clan, even though we had no memory of our parents and knew no different. We were raised by our Beta aunt and although she was strict, we were loved. It was extremely frustrating.”
The break in the undergrowth led off in one direction and he cautiously followed it, his gun raised and ready.
Cas felt a wave of shame go through his own body, and he slumped into a chair and dropped his head into his hands. “I- I apologise, Sam. I'm a little unsettled by what happened today as well. It doesn't excuse my behaviour-” he started before Sam interrupted.
Ellen and Amy had agreed to assist Jess and both women were busy setting out the sterilised equipment and then thoroughly washing their hands right up to the elbows, whilst Jess covered her clothing in a linen apron and then proceeded to thoroughly scrub her own hands and bare arms.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, I’m looking forward to a cup of coffee. I ran out a couple of hours ago.” he said shaking his empty Thermos.
“I guess all I can do, is start passing off hunts to other hunters. Other than that, I'm lost, Cas.” said Sam, looking helpless.
“Have I upset you? Talking about previous lovers is probably very distasteful. I apologise.” Cas said, looking contrite.
Michaels voice rose above the noise of the crowd, calling the meeting to order. The arguments died down and there were hushed voices and the scuffling of feet as everyone found a seat or a place to lean. Looking up at where Michael stood on the mezzanine floor of the clan meeting house. Eventually silence fell and Michael began to speak.
Okay, some people have tried to guess at how the story is going to go. No one has figured it out yet, although, some of those ideas are pretty awesome! (damn you!)
Cas suppressed a laugh at Deans antics and pressed on. “It's the only way, if you punch him, Jess kicks your ass, then Sam feels guilty for that and the cycle continues. Just tell him what you told me. Once he understands, I can almost guarantee he'll back off.” he said with a smile.
“Use the pocket watch I gave you to check his heart rate every 15 minutes, if it goes higher or lower than what I told you earlier, wake me. I'm going to bathe and get changed, then I am going to take a nap. I mean it, any changes, wake me.” said Jess tiredly to Ellen and Amy. She smiled softly at Sam and then left the tent with Sam just behind her.
“Sorry Charlie, I would if I could, but with my arm like this, I just can't get in there to get it.” said Dean, for the first time thinking of a positive to having his arm broken.
“Oh, no. I know that look. What are you going to do? Couldn't you just punch me again instead?” said Balthazar with a groan.
Jess spoke first “ You're looking a whole lot better. Garth tells me that you want a bath? That's fine, just don't get your wound too wet. I'll be able to take the stitches out in a couple of days. I have some ointment for you, it's probably itchy right now and driving you crazy.”
Dean gasped as Cas lifted him into his lap without pulling out, almost bringing the comforter with him, his grip on it was so tight.
Jo was a tough as nails blonde and had a deadly temper, as one of the Alphas that had dared to get too close had found out.
“I know, son. I'm damn near climbing the walls m'self. I've got the whole network looking, but whoever took Dean isn't advertising it.” Bobby adjusted his hat and sighed. “Garth has agreed to move his distillery operation here, so he can help man the radio and look after the place if we get news. The boys an idjit, but he's got something about 'im.” Bobby huffed a laugh at Sam's incredulous expression. “C'mon, the boy grows on you. You can't deny it, I saw you hug him back yesterday” said Bobby, smiling behind his beard.
“This is harder than I thought it would be.” Cas said quietly, wrapping his arms around himself defensively. “You’ve given me hope and I find myself struggling to hold back. I’m trying to be patient, I’m trying to give you the space you need to decide. But it’s so difficult, when you are everything I want.”
Dean finally took the chance to get a proper look at his rescuer, he was tall, virtually the same height as Dean, but broader. His hair was a rich dark brown, almost black, which complimented his startling blue eyes. He had a light dusting of stubble on a strong jaw and a mouth that looked soft and plush, a mouth that began to curve into a shy smile as Dean suddenly realised he had been staring just a
“Slow down, Jack. I don't want you to fall.” Daddy called after him. Jack ignored him and tore off towards the den, his heart racing with excitement at actually getting to meet Santa.
Looking up from feeding the animals in the barn, Bobby saw them go, but just chuckled and rolled his eyes. They'd held out longer than he thought. Idjits.
“Good.” Dean said, reaching across to the rail where several t-shirts hung. They were mostly plain, but some had prints or designs. Dean grabbed a couple of each of the plain ones and laid them in Cas' arms.
He stood outside Deans door, listening to the sounds of Deans slow breaths and regular heartbeat. He was still feeling unsettled by their earlier argument, they regularly bickered, occasionally fought, but he had never seen Dean break as he had today.
“Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry dude. I don't expect you to submit to an Alpha. I just hate this, y'know? I want to settle somewhere, for good or at least for more than a couple of months”
There were four Omegas, including Dean currently in the dorm. The other three were female and young.
Cas huffed a small laugh. “Perhaps, but you need sleep, Dean. Going without sleep is very dangerous for humans, it can have severe detrimental effects on your physical and mental health. I can help you. All it takes is one touch and you can have uninterrupted, dreamless sleep for however long you want.” he said moving closer into Deans space. “There is no shame in asking for help.” he added softly.
Garth suddenly stood up and threw his arms around Sam and howled, crying huge tears that soaked into Sam's shirt. “I'm so happy for you guys! This is the best day, ever!” he sobbed into Sam's neck as Sam awkwardly patted Garth's back and Jess and Bobby looked on in horror.
“I need to check out that arm. I sure Benny and Ellen did a good job, but I'd like to check it all the same. I want to unstrap it from your chest anyway. It's fine for the first day, but your arm will stiffen up and that will really hurt.” said Jess, now standing in front of Dean with her hands out ready to begin unwrapping his arm, just waiting for his go-ahead. Dean nodded and sat up straight to make it easier for her to reach.
Dean barely managed to stop his mouth dropping open as he saw the competitive side of Cas rear its head. It was hot to say the least.
Dean woke up with a start, the alarm on his phone blaring until Cas leaned over to silence it. He realised he’d fallen asleep while they had been talking, his cheek resting on Cas’ chest.
Dean was similarly absorbed in his findings. He had even found a few engineering manuals in amongst the seemingly random pieces of machinery and resolved to read them later. He had found some items that would be ideal for the car. The first being a CB radio. He knew his father would be over the moon about that one. Contact with settlements for them was sporadic at best and at worst, non existent. With a CB radio, they could be warned ahead of time of possible rogue clan movements and plan accordingly. Of course, Bobby's own CB radio range only went so far. Dean pondered on that for a while, he had some ideas on boosting the range of both radios. It would help Bobby's network immensely if a
Cas looked down at himself. “Ah, yes. I see your point.” he said reluctantly, he looked to Dean anxiously.
Daddy stepped into the room behind Jack. “Hey, buddy. What's with the tears? Did you get a little too excited?” he said scooping Jack up into his arms and squeezing him tight.
I know this chapter is late, but I did spoil you by giving you three chapters in one week before, so I had to play catch up a little bit. This chapter is also the biggest one yet. At 6500 words it's a monster.
Dean sat open mouthed at Charlie's outburst. He put the food down and stood up, looking like he'd been slapped.
He had a few photos attached to the wall above it, several of Claire and Jack, one of Jody and Donna posing in front of Donna's huge hummer, both holding shotguns and smiling widely, their arms around each others shoulders. A blurry selfie of Gabriel and Cas together, Cas was frowning as if he was trying to work something out as Gabe pulled a silly face. There were a few of Dean and Sam, and in the centre, one of Dean and Baby. It wasn't posed, Dean was throwing his head back laughing at something, his smile wide and natural, his eyes screwed up and he had a hand on his stomach, the other on Baby's hood. Dean smiled, it was a good photo. He couldn't remember when it was taken, or even when he'd felt able to laugh that freely. He needed to remember how to be that guy again.
Cas was visibly flustered. So Dean did the bravest thing he could manage at that moment. He fled. Grabbing the soap from Castiels hand as he sped past, he ran for the river, calling over his shoulder “I'll be right back!” in what he hoped was a steady voice. He refused to look back.
“So that was you at the mall?!” Jack squeaked. “But you and Daddy were there with me, how can you be in both places?” he demanded, looking suspicious.
“No problem, old man.” Claire said cheekily as she handed her bag to Cas who placed it on the chair behind him. “I missed out on the camping trip, so I thought I’d swing by and..” she trailed off as she saw that Cas and Dean were holding hands. “Huh. Guess I missed a couple of other things too.” she said, her eyebrows raised in surprise.
He suddenly felt a pang of nostalgia for his brother Gabriel, who had taught him how to capture snakes, even if they were the non-venomous kind and they were put in someone's bed as a prank. He chuckled to himself remembering Raphael's reaction to finding a snake under his pillow, it had been worth the punishment he and Gabriel had received. Cleaning algae from the outside of the old water tower had been an ill advised punishment as it turned out, as Gabriel had scrubbed foot high letters in the algae, spelling out RAPHAEL WETS THE BED, big enough for the whole settlement to see. They were punished again, but Raphael never picked on Castiel or their younger sister Hannah again after that day.
Jack gasped. Santa was actually here! He'd managed to fool Daddy that he was actually asleep and so now he might miss out on meeting Santa. Jack decided that maybe he should wake up from his pretend sleep, so that he could meet Santa and they would still think he was a good boy.
Santa sat down in Papa's favourite chair and patted his lap. “Sure, come on Jack, You can tell me how you and Daddy made the cookies for me.” he said encouragingly.
“That's alright, I was the same with Karen. First couple of months after we mated, I couldn't leave her side. Damn near growled at anyone who even looked at her funny.” said Bobby, gently.
turned in his seat so see that Charlie had pushed her arm through the tiny window in the back of the cabin in order to try and comfort Dean. “Dude, it's ok, fuck all that crap that shitty Alphas spout about 'needy, emotional Omegas', that's just because they're selfish assholes with no empathy. Like those mofos back there, wrong people to listen to, dude.” Said Charlie fiercely, winking at Cas who smiled shyly at her.
“You can say no, at any time. But, I need a yes to continue.” Cas whispered, his hands caressing Deans torso.
“I want Bee-bee.” whined Jack, clearly worn out from the excitement. He rubbed his eyes and yawned widely.
Hi! *waves* I'm back. Sorry for the delay, to make up for it, here is an extra long chapter. This chapter is a monster. Over 5000 words. Due to the subject matter, I felt it needed to be longer than normal.
“Do you want me to make lunch, Dean? We've got some more flat bread and I could grab some of that apple chutney you like from the pantry to go with some more of the boiled ham? Sound good?” said Sam, finger combing his wet hair off his face.
Castiel began to move swiftly, away from the guard post as a scream shattered the silence. He could see the guards on the wall rushing towards the sounds of the panicked Alphas as the guards at the gate scrambled away from the deadly snakes. He made for the rough stone wall halfway along it's length and began to climb quickly. Within 30 seconds he was at the top and crossing the walkway in order to drop down the other side.
Dean gasped “ Garth? Garth, you magnificent bastard! I could kiss you! Is my brother there? Is he ok? Did he get away?” he babbled into the mic.
He managed to put the slippers on and groaned as he sat up again. His headache was a dull throb behind his eyes, and his nose was stuffy and clogged. He hoped he wasn't coming down with something on top of the hangover.
Cas nodded, and placed the album back into the stack, where they were organised by year. He fussed about with the stack, lining the corners up perfectly. He looked as if he was waiting for Dean to explode.
“Sorry, dude. It's just weird seeing you in normal clothes, doing normal shit.” he said, looking embarrassed.
“How 'bout you read me a little bit of that book, Cas. I could probably do with a bit of boring too, y'know?” he said, beginning to slur slightly.
as the Alpha wrapped an arm around Deans waist and pulled him closer, almost into his lap, deepening the kiss as he did so.
“I was unaware that snoring was a desired trait.” he said dryly, smiling at Jess who was not even trying to hide her amusement.
“I know that movie! It came out when I was pregnant with Sam.” Mary said giving her youngest son a soft look as she petted his hair affectionately.
Dean huffed a laugh. “I'll give you a hand in a minute, buddy. Don't worry. Anything else you need?” he asked quietly.
Feeling the familiar pressure in his bladder, he shuffled to the edge of the bed and swung his legs over the edge, gasping as his bare feet made contact with the cold concrete floor.
Dean threw the truck into gear and stamped on the accelerator again, switching on the headlights as he did so, the truck twitched and then gripped the dusty ground and shot forward, straight at the now blinded guards firing indiscriminately at the truck.
“No. I..No.” said Cas, the last thing he did remember was his conversation with Dean and he blushed and smiled at the memory.
Sam showed her his dirty palms. “Cas’s truck got a flat, we had to stop to fix it.” he said, heading over to the small sink to wash his hands, dropping a kiss to him Mom’s head as he passed her.
Cas looked tired. “I saw your face. I heard what Kitty said. I heard what you said. It hurt me, Dean.” he said, his voice hoarse.
Forced matings were nothing like that. A forced mating made only the Omega submit completely to the Alpha. A true slave of biology. This allowed the Alpha to mate more than once. Some Alphas had harems of Omegas, products of forced matings, to tend to his or her every need and produce as many offspring as possible. In some rogue clans it became a mark of status to have more than one Omega. The more Omegas, the higher the status.
Dean proceeded to tell him what had happened at the store and after. He was shaking the whole time and Sam's eyebrows got higher and higher as Dean revealed everything.
“Don't need to, I just know. But I get it, you don't know him like I do. If you want I'll call him now if you need to hear it from him yourself. I promised I'd fill him and Sam in anyway after we made camp. So, now I know what the plan is, I can tell 'em.” said Dean, smiling widely and standing.
“Why did you do that?” Cas said, sounding annoyed. “Those things are meant to be between private, only between us.”
He had forced himself to move, to try to find some sort of cover from the elements. He had ended up in Bobby's box trailer. Not ideal, but it was a roof. He had stopped vomiting around twelve hours after he woke up, he just had a persistent ringing in his ears, nausea and a terrible headache. He just had to get past the worst of the concussion, then he would work out what to do next. He had already tried to call Bobby, but the car had been stripped of anything of value. The radio was gone. He couldn't track Dean, the snow had obliterated any tracks and the scent would have been impossible for even an Alpha to follow by now. He tried not to think about what was happening to Dean, but images tormented him and refused to let him rest.
Sam shrugged. “No-one is stopping you, Dean. But we only brought 24 beers to last the week between all of us. So the choice is yours.” he said, wishing they’d brought more beer himself, if only to stop Dean whining.
Sam laughed. “Don’t you wanna ride with your boyfriend?” he teased, climbing into the passenger seat of the Impala.
Yes, Dean and Cas finally meet. I felt this momentous occasion deserved a huge chapter, just over 6000 words.
“Sam! Are you gonna listen to me or not? You want me to talk? Then let me talk. I just want you to understand something first, I don't owe you an explanation of what happened at that compound. Stop acting like I do. You don't get to make demands.” he stepped back as Sam dropped his mouth open in shock and indignation.
“I stopped trying to figure out why Bobby does anything a while ago. I just know he's prepared for things that no-one has even thought of.” said Sam knowingly. He resumed eating, quickly finishing the second bowl and gulping down the last of his tea. “Where is Jess?”
“Yeah, I bet you didn’t cry the first time you took a dick in the ass.” Dean said nastily, pushing himself up and wiping his face. He grimaced at the slippery feeling between his ass cheeks.
Jess and Sam stood in an uncomfortable silence, barely daring to look at each other until Bobby finally managed to compose himself.
“I can hear you up there, you bastard. Fuck you, and fuck your mind games. Is beating the shit out of me not enough anymore? You gotta mess with my head too? Fuck you, Alistair!”
Cas chuckled. “He's gonna love his new bike. Not sure how he's going to take it that he can't come to work with me at the hospital though.” he said ruefully.
Dean smiled and pressed a hand onto Cas' shoulder, running it down to his elbow in a comforting gesture. “Okay, I'll grab a couple of t-shirts and then you can go try some these on while I find you some boots, 'kay?” he said, patting Cas on the shoulder.
“Yeah, same” said Dean with a chuckle then put on a falsetto voice and batted his eyelashes and waved his hands around “
Over the last few weeks, he had gotten a good look at Lucifer's holdings. The main settlement was deep in the canyon. Cut into the canyon walls either side of a waterfall that powered a giant waterwheel. To Castiels surprise, the settlement itself was well planned and aesthetically stunning. Beautiful archways, pillars and steps had been carved out of the rock itself along both sides of the canyon, creating balconies and covered walkways. The river was controlled by a series of sluice gates and the banks had been built up and paved. A wooden bridge connected the two sides. Carved benches and statues sat in alcoves and although it was still winter, plants grew everywhere, carefully shaped and tended to add to the surroundings but not take over. It was breathtaking.
Benny let out a nervous laugh but sobered quickly as Cas glared at him coldly. “I probably made it sound worse than it is. It's not a bad thing. It's about the war you are gonna be fightin'.” he said nervously.
Dean nodded sadly. “Sorry man. That sounds fuckin' awful. At least I just have the one to deal with. I dunno how I'd feel if it was a whole clan.” he slumped sideways, blinking slowly. “So, oh wise Alpha. What should I do about Sam? I gotta do something, or I'm gonna end up punching him and he's got an Alpha now who'll probably kick my ass.” he grinned.
Bobby rolled his eyes and stood “Well, I got shit to do. Garth's cabin is done. I gotta make a start on the rest of my never endin' list, an' listenin' to you two idjits bicker, is not on it.” he said gruffly.
“When dear Rafe dropped the bombshell that your father was alive, I had no way to contact you. So I did the next best thing. I went to Gabriel. Between us, we got your father out from where he was being held and Hannah is with them now. They're nearby and safe.” he said, holding his hands out placatingly.
Cas’s expression was one of beautiful, terrible hope. He stood with a half dazed look of wonder, staring at Dean as if he’d misheard.
Cas buried his head in his hands, he was clearly on the verge of tears himself at his sons distress.
“Ohgodohgodohgod...urgh. Ew!” she said, her eyes screwed shut. “I got it!” she said triumphantly as she stepped back, the radio in hand.
Cas was blushing hard as he looked at Dean in the face. “I would like your permission to formally court you with the intent to mate.” he blurted looking away. “I'll understand if you say no. It's a lot to ask, especially when I have to leave for a while, I'm sorry if this makes you feel awkward, and I'd hate to lose your friendship over it, I value that above everything else” he rambled. Dean grabbed his hand and shushed him gently.
Garth was virtually giddy with excitement at the newcomers after being alone for a few days, the Alphas enthusiasm rubbed off on everyone else and dinner was a festive affair with everyone talking over one another and when Bobby broke out his home brew, it got even louder.
Cas stepped back, but began pacing instead. He was far from calm. “What could you possibly say that is worse than our entire clan being decimated?” he barked, his hands were bunched into fists at his side.
Dean twitched in his sleep and let out a tiny whine causing Cas to frown in concern as Dean's scent began to change, the cinnamon scent taking on a sour note of distress as he began to whimper.
Sniffing himself, he made a face, washing with a cloth and basin of water only worked for so long. He hoped Jess would allow him to take a bath today, he was desperate for a shave too, his beard was thick and itchy. The thought of a hot bath and soap made him groan out loud.
“That don't make a lot of sense, chief. I think you are gonna have to explain that one to me so that I understand it.” said Benny, looking annoyed.
Dean laughed “Cas, trust me. You did real good. I nearly forgot I was supposed to be teaching you on the way back, felt like you'd been driving for years.” he said smiling.
Bobby growled a little under his breath. “I got ideas, nothin' set in stone. Forgive me, Cas, but if your clan is gone, so has the threat of the two clans teamin' up to take us all down.” said Bobby getting irritated himself.
“Damn straight they would. Holy cow, Karen had a way about her, could put me in my place without a word. When I messed up, all she had to do was give me that look, disappointed and devastated all at once, and I was a wreck.”
“Okay, we’ll set aside some time for just us today. Would it count as a date, do you think?” Cas asked, looking thoughtful.
Dean shrugged. “I wasn’t aware of it, now that I am, I still can’t seem to stop.” he admitted, his face still flaming.
“Yeah, I heard most of it. When you're feelin' up to it, I'll be wantin' the name of the asshole who treated you like that, kiddo. I'm real sorry about your mom. Now you're here, that makes ya part of our family. We might whine like bitches sometimes, but we got each others backs.” said Bobby who looked visibly moved. His eyes were glassy and he swallowed a few times and cleared his throat before he continued. “Anyone treats you like that ever again, you come tell me straight away. I'll set 'em right.” he pointed his finger at the radio and then himself.
Cas spoke to the group for the first time, his face like stone. “We're out of time, the guards are changing shifts, we have to go now.” Dean nodded, any second now the guards would realise the Omega dorm was empty and raise the alarm. “Okay, through that window and around 20ft away is a truck, me and Cas are in the front and you guys are in the back. Get in and cover yourselves with your blankets and don't move, no matter what. It's nearly over, guys.” He bundled everyone into a hug and had to stifle a hysterical giggle when Charlie pulled a reluctant Cas into the scrum as well.
“You're afraid I'll ignore it and hope it goes away.” Dean finished for him. “Or I won't let you come back.”
The lifeguard held up his whistle. “I can be an independent and impartial judge, if you want?” Sam nodded.
For the next hour, Jake took Dean and Cas through everything they might need. Gave them helpful advice and told them stories of his own adventures. Cas listened attentively, and Dean cracked jokes with the older man that made them both cry laughing.
“I'll get him out of your hair and put him down for a nap, thanks for watching out for him, Castiel.” said Amy softly as she reached for her son, who held his arms up eagerly for his mother to take him.
“Guys, he just spent months completely alone and in constant danger after witnessing a massacre. I think that justifies him being sad and lonely.” scoffed Dean. “It's none of our business anyway.”
Eventually Sam sighed deeply and tucked his long hair behind his ears, letting the tension out of his posture and turning to face Dean, shamefaced.
Sam felt an absurd desire to laugh as the angel pulled six beers out and shut the fridge door with a bump of his hip, like a regular guy and not an almighty angel of the lord.
“Y'all just call me Kitty, Jake over there is the pain in my ass and the love of my life. I'm sorry if I made it awkward for you boys. You just come on over to the counter when you're ready and I'll fix ya up a little discount.” she said, patting Deans hand again before walking away.
“I’m gonna head down the road and grab some sandwiches, it’ll tide us over until tonight. Jack’s more like Dean than either of them realise, both of them get bitchy when they’re hungry.” Sam laughed.
“Yes, thank you.” Cas said in his gravelly tone, he returned to Jack and pointed into the cornfield where the stalks would cover him from view. Jack nodded and hopped the fence, almost running into the field and disappearing into the stalks.
Gordon smiled. “Yeah, that's what they call me.” he gestured to the various bits of furniture around the work shed. “Did you make all of these?” he said looking impressed.
Bobby sat at the kitchen table, pretending to read a book on crop rotation and farm irrigation techniques. In reality he was carefully observing Sam and Jess making a mess of breakfast as they pretended they weren't nervous about something. Bobby wasn't stupid, he knew exactly what was going on.
“I wouldn't dream of it, Jack. I'll be right here when you get back. Just make sure you get all the icing off your face and brush your teeth.” he said, wagging a finger.
Cas felt a wave of sympathy for Jess, newly mated, her instincts must be off the charts and virtually agony. He wondered how she was holding herself together. His horror must have shown on his face, when she winked and held up a jar and pointed to her top lip where she had smeared some of the paste from the jar. Camphor.
“Fine. It's a true mating. But if you hurt my brother, I'll kill you.” said Dean, meaning every word.
“Dean pointed out that I would stick out if I went camping wearing the trench coat.” Cas said shyly. “I feel a little lost without it, I’ll admit. But this is comfortable, at least.”
Dean tried very hard not to preen at that, and failed entirely. “I'm pretty sure that goes for me too.” he chuckled.
“One, if we need a quick get away, the car is ready to go.” he finally managed to wrestle the wheel around and complete the turn.
. I'm good, really. I run hot when I sleep. Usually end up kickin' the covers off anyway.” he reassured the angel. “Why? You gonna watch over me like the old days?” he asked jokingly.
He hoped that Santa liked the cookies and milk he had left on the table by the front door. Daddy said it was the best place to leave it because the didn't have a fire place like in the movie they had watched. Papa had suggested they leave some carrots for the reindeer too, after all, they had a hard job to do, flying around the whole world pulling a sleigh filled with toys. Jack had suggested that they should wait up on the roof so they could feed the reindeer themselves, like at the petting zoo, and Papa had laughed as Daddy looked scared and said no. Papa explained that Santa would feed the reindeer, they might get scared by strangers like Uncle Sam's dog, Bones. Poor Bones was a scaredy cat and liked to hide under uncle Sam's desk most of the time. Plus it was dangerous on the roof, Daddy said. Santa and the reindeer had magic to stop them falling off and Jack didn't, so don't even think about climbing up there. Jack didn't think he could get up on the roof without Papa or Daddy anyway, it was too high, even higher than uncle Sam and he was a giant.
Dean was at a loss with what to do with his hands, he reached back and grabbed Cas’ thigh, feeling the muscles move as Cas thrusted relentlessly, the other settled over Cas’ hand on his cock, lacing his fingers as they both pumped him together.
“Dean, it's okay. You've been through a lot lately, we all have.” Sam said gently, coming further into the room.
Gordon grinned. “My apologies. I was just curious about the gorgeous Omega working away all by himself. I thought you might be lonely.” he stepped even closer.
Both Alphas chuckled at the memory as Sam and Dean looked on eager and curious, they loved it when their father talked about their mother.
“Good thinking. Crocotta are no joke. Tough son of bitches to kill. Does she have back-up? Not that I don't think she can handle it, it's just that even we found it hard to take one down.” Dean said with a grimace.
“I was.. I did a lot of bad. I figure if I do my part in taking down this Lucifer guy and getting rid of the people terrorisin' folks, it goes a long way to makin' things right. What I'm askin' is, that when you go, I want to go with you. Help you fight the bad guys.” said Benny, looking determined.
Sam frowned. “So, I've been thinking, We need to organise some sort of intervention, Dean needs-” he started before Cas cut him off.
“So I ran. I thought for a while about going back to finish the job, but seeing her again, like that? It...it almost destroyed me. So, I decided to get a fresh start. I travelled for a while until I came across the Roadhouse and the survivors. I thought maybe I could help, maybe I could make up for the things I'd done.” he paused, then continued in a quiet voice “Maybe for a while, I did.”
Cas chuckled. “Hey, you're talking to the huggiest Alpha you've ever met, remember? Well, except maybe Garth.” he shrugged and Dean snorted out a laugh.
“Yeah.” Dean breathed out. “Yeah, do it Cas.” He went to move and Cas stopped him with a gentle hand on his shoulder.
Dean grimaced. “Guess I cant just hand him some magazines in a brown paper bag and tell him not to make me a grandpa like Dad did, huh?” he chuckled.
Santa stood up and adjusted his belt on his big belly, it was a little lop sided now, which was weird.
Dean nodded and looked up at Bobby and then over his shoulder at Ellen and Benny who hovered in the doorway. “Can you guys give us a minute? You're freakin' me out even more by just standing there and staring.” he snapped and Cas growled again, reaching to pull Dean back towards himself.
Dean sighed heavily. “Yeah, we're just courtin' right now. It's too soon for.. um.. shenanigans anyhow. Y'know 'specially as he's leavin'. It wouldn't be smart. He wants to do everythin' the right way. I kinda want that too.” said Dean shyly as Charlie smiled softly.
Dean felt the panic abating slightly. “I know I’m not makin’ sense. I think-” He took a few deep breaths, trying to settle his panicked thoughts.
Dean lifted his ass, trying to meet Cas thrust for thrust, he could feel his own cock dragging on the comforter as Cas rhythm was thrown off briefly. It took a couple of seconds but they settled back into a steady pounding rhythm that made Dean’s breath come out in tiny gasps.
Balthazar nudged Cas from his shocked stupor. “I'd get out now if I were you, he can only keep them distracted for so long.”
“Oh, fuck off.” laughed Dean as Jess approached the back of the truck, Jo and Bobby just behind her.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, Bobby bet Dad twenty dollars I could tie him up so well he couldn’t get out without help.” he snorted a laugh.
Sam chuckled and slapped the angel on the shoulder. “Lessen learned. Pay attention when bowling. Is there anything else you wanna try?” he asked, turning back to his meal.
Dean turned to face Cas with a warm smile. “He really was. I thought he’d stopped just to give us shit. But he really was just checkin’ to see if we were okay.” he sounded surprised.
Uriel sighed and rubbed one hand over his brow. “Michael will tell us what we need to know, Castiel. It would be unwise to keep him waiting.” He turned and began to walk towards the settlement proper.
“A little, because he doesn't push, and he gets it. Lost his parents before he even knew 'em and got labelled a 'poor little orphan' for the rest of his life. I just want to be me, not 'the Omega that got kidnapped'. It's kinda restricting.” said Dean, softly.
“You got that right, chief. Joanna is cut from the same cloth as her mama. Did you see her back at the camp? Fought like a demon. Slit that Alphas throat like a pro.” said Benny, smiling wistfully.
“They said something about brotherly bonding. I'm not sure why that takes a bottle of whiskey, but I'm an only child, so maybe I missed something.” said Jo with a laugh.
Dean felt some of the wonder himself. That he could have this, be with Cas. “I’m gonna need to take it slow, okay?” he said in a shaky voice.
Sam's mouth dropped open and he looked over at Cas with new eyes. “No way.” he breathed out. “Really?” he asked Dean.
An older bearded man in an alarming amount of camouflage approached Cas with a bemused look on his face. “Hello, sir. You're looking a little bit lost. You sure you're in the right place?” he said giving Cas a look up and down and indicating Cas' suit and trench coat.
The rest of the morning passed quickly. Sam looking comical in the bathtub that was clearly too small for his large frame, his knees virtually up by his ears. He bickered good-naturedly with Dean as he went to and fro with pans of water. Finally satisfied he was clean he climbed out, towelled his still sensitive skin dry and dressed himself in his most comfortable clothes. Dean was now using the mangle to wring out as much moisture from the wet clothes as he could before draping them over the drying rails. Sam leant against the door frame watching Dean wrestle a bed sheet into submission over a rail slightly too short for the sheet.
No warnings except for maybe checking your twitter feed for some salt to balance out all the sweetness.
Dean lost it, laughing so hard he bent double. “I know, it’s ridiculous. It’s- It’s like a telenovella. I’m expecting an ex to show up any moment declaring their undying love.” he spluttered out.
Well, this is it, the last chapter. I actually completed a fic, go me. I'm working on five other fics right now. A follow on from "I saw Daddy kissing Santa Clause". I'm expanding that into a 'verse. Then my other two WIP. I also have a Space AU and another canon based fic that was supposed to be my DCBB. [I had to pull out because of a death in the family.] All of them are nearing completion, I work on them when my health allows me to.
Cas looked torn. “I don't know what to do. I don't want to hang around like I'm putting pressure on you and waiting for an answer that may never come. But if I go...” he trailed off.
“I tried both, I found I preferred being the ‘top’ so to speak. Although there are advantages to being penetrated, I found. It was very educational.” Cas said without batting an eyelid.
Dean paused halfway through buttoning the jacket looked confused, then something clicked and he burst out laughing. “Well, shit. So you did. Man, I was a mess that night. I guess I'm a bit of a drama queen when I'm drunk, huh?” he grinned, trying to cover up the slight blush on his cheeks.
“Alright. We'll talk about it later. And we are gonna talk about it, there's somethin' you ain't tellin' us. I know I ain't in a position to judge, and you probably have your reasons, just like I did. So I'm backin' off for the time bein'.” said Benny, giving Cas a pointed look before picking up his plate and walking out of the room.
“Yeah, you did, and you're right, I've been an asshole the last few days. I'll get over myself. But this ain't like you, Charlie, what happened?” said Dean, leaning a hip on the table and trying to meet Charlie's eyes.
After Dean and Sam had done an inventory of all of the gear, laying it all out on the garage floor and inspecting everything to make sure all of it was in good shape to survive a week of roughing it, they had loaded the back of Cas truck with the bulk of the gear.
He staggered as he stood up and felt a slight wave of nausea. He held onto the back of the chair at his desk and waited for it to pass, knowing he wouldn't actually throw up. He slowly pulled on his dead guy robe and belted it loosely.
Happy that he had a captive audience, Matthew babbled continuously as Cas drank some water, nodding along as if he understood every word. Looking suitably amazed when the child showed him the doll he had been given.
Mary shook her head. “Why exclude him from seeing you heal? Knowing he had a part in it? It’ll make you stronger, having his support. Asking for help is not a weakness.” she reminded.
He didn't have to go far, Bobby and Sam were outside the radio room, both looked pensive and they had obviously been waiting for Dean.
Sam nodded slowly. “Yeah, Dean. It kinda twigged for me after he got out of purgatory. For a while there I thought you returned his feelings, you were so broken up at having to leave him behind.” he admitted.
Dean watched Benny closely, the Alpha seemed to be doing his best to make up for the bandit attack by throwing himself into making the camp-site habitable again. Knowing they would be there for a few days, he had taken the tarp from the truck and made a temporary shelter. He was as skilled as Dean in survival and by late afternoon, the camp was almost cosy.
Charlie nodded and scooted off the porch swing and into the house ahead of Dean, who took one last look at Cas, who was laughing at something Benny was saying. He smiled as Cas looked over, seeming to sense that Dean was staring at him. He gave a shy wave and the smile on his face was visible, even from across the yard. Dean waved back and indicated he was going into the house, Cas nodded and turned back to the conversation with Benny.
Dean covered his face as a sob broke out. “I know. I know. It's all bullshit, and I'm tired. I'm so fuckin' tired.”
Dean tried to hand the knife back, but the stranger shook his head. “Keep it, I have others.” he smiled. Dean shrugged and tucked the knife in his waistband alongside his gun.
No-one knew where the rogue clan settlements were. They would only be seen during a raid, and would vanish again after. Taking the unmated Omegas, any useful supplies and even their dead, leaving no clues as to where they came from or where they went. Tracks disappearing as if by magic.
Cas moved to the edge of the bed and began stripping his clothes. Dean looked over his shoulder as Cas stood up and dropped his jeans to the floor, along with his underwear, his cock curved up towards his stomach as he rolled a condom down it’s length.
Ellen showed him how to measure Castiels heart rate, check his temperature and what to look out for in regards to danger signs. She showed him how to write it all down, so Jess could go over it when she woke up. Then she fell asleep propped up against the crate next to Castiels bed.
Dean heard Cas speaking as he approached the door and opened it. He was talking on the phone and was dressed in one of the outfits they had bought the day before. He gave Dean a sheepish look and indicted the phone as he mouthed
Mary grinned. “That was brave of him.” she said. “What was it like? Good? Bad? He wasn’t one of those kissers that drool too much, was he?”
Cas nodded. “Okay.” he said, stepping closer, his eyes wary. “Then tell me, what do you want me to do?”
There was a flash of irritation across Gordon's face, but the grin was back so fast Dean thought he'd imagined it.
“Do you want this?” Cas asked, running a hand up the inside of Dean’s thigh and up over the curve of his ass, giving it a squeeze as he pulled his fingers out.
Dean let out the breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. “I’m still pretty messed up. I should probably get my head together before I commit to him properly.” he said, not liking the sound of it.
Dean had been put in the pit again for being caught out of bed the night before, he had fallen asleep on the windowsill and had still been there when Alistair had decided to check in on the sleeping Omegas. He had a rough idea that it had been about a day since he had been put here and he had thought a little while ago that he had heard Alistair preparing to get him out. The familiar clang of the cradle being attached to the ring clips on the rope had alerted him, but it had halted suddenly.
but he was glad to have ducked the responsibility. Jack might have the body of an adult, but his mind and his emotions were nowhere near ready to handle a sexual relationship. He hoped Cas would be able to explain that to him.
Cas shrugged. “Maybe, I’m becoming more human everyday. I don’t know if my grace will last the rest of your lifetime, I may end up becoming completely human.” he said, placing the camp kettle onto the grid over the coals.
Bobby moved silently towards the tree line, he could see areas where the undergrowth had been disturbed and the ground had been churned up, the smell of blood was faint but it was all around.
“This, Cas, is the daddy of coolers. We can fit up to sixty beers in this sucker and they'll still be cool eight hours later.” Dean said, admiring a large red and white box on display at the outdoors man outlet.
“I got something that might help with that. It should bring the tension down a notch.” said Bobby, holding up a clear bottle of oil with some sort of flowers in it and an oil lantern.
The newcomers were from Bobby's network, here to begin construction on the buildings that would be the basis for the hub that Bobby had envisaged. They seemed like a friendly bunch, albeit big drinkers. Garth had been working around the clock trying to keep up with the demand, even though Bobby had limited the workers to only drinking after dark.
Mary gave him a considering look. “I never wanted this life for you and Sam. You’ve done more than your fair share, if you want to retire, I say, go for it.” she said gently. “Is that all?” she asked, knowing it wasn’t.
Dean huffed and rolled his eyes. “Sure you are, grumpy. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. I broke it, I fix it. Take as long as you need, Alpha.”
“Everybody okay here? Nobody got hurt didja?” the cop asked, looking all of them over with a beady eye.
“Pinning a tail on a donkey seems unnecessarily cruel, not to mention pointless.” Cas said, frowning.
Cas was crying now. He looked ready to flee at any moment, his hands still over his mouth as he backed away from Dean, his eye on the drivers side of the truck.
Huffing a laugh, Cas passed the flask over to Dean who drank it down and passed it back before slumping into the chair heavily.
Dean was on the verge of tears himself. He knew that he was attracted to Cas, however much of a shock that was, Cas' confession was an even bigger one.
Cas shook his head. “No, don’t worry yourself. I’m just unused to compliments. Thank you, Mary.” he said earnestly.
He sniffed the air, but the mist and the smoke from the fire drowned everything else out. Hearing a soft noise behind him, he turned quickly, blade already in hand, ready for an attack.
He figured the starry eyed looks at each other and blushing this morning meant one thing, they had finally 'tied the knot' so to speak. He smiled into his beard as he remembered it had been the same with his mate, Karen. He couldn't be happier for them, Jess was a good Alpha, and perfect for Sam. After everything they had all been through, it seemed right that some good had come out of it.
Dean sighed. These kind of cops were all the same, they all had some kind of complex and needed to prove themselves or something. Dean just hoped he didn’t get tased again. Cas would probably smite the guy and then they’d have a dead cop to try and get rid of. He decided to play along, he relaxed his posture to be as non-threatening as possible and plastered a tired, slightly frazzled look on his face. He knew he looked like a slightly harried traveller with a minor inconvenience. He should get an Oscar for his performance, shame no-one was handing them out.
“No, Cas. You're right. You said it in a really blunt and shitty way, but, you're right. We have to trust that Dean will let us help him.” he said, reluctantly.
Uriel, one of Castiels closest friends and an Alpha stood a few feet away. His calm exterior belying the seriousness of the situation.
“WOO HOO!” screamed Dean and he pumped his fist as the other gripped the steering wheel as the truck bounced along at top speed. “Everybody good back there?” he called through the tiny window in the back of the cabin.
“That don't look too good, Chief. You're gonna need a medic, for sure” drawled Benny to Cas, as he was sitting up, dabbing blood from his face with the sleeve of his jacket with a wince as he grazed his ruined eyebrow.
“Okay, You really should sleep now. I'll check in on you later, okay?” said Dean, lifting himself off the floor.
A look of understanding crossed Deans face. “I get it. I think I do anyway. Your clothes are part of you and how you see yourself. That's cool, I'm the same with my car. But,
“Well, my Baby ain’t makin’ it no further on this road.” Dean said regretfully as he pulled the Impala over to turn her around.
Bobby led the way in his truck. Dean, Cas and Jo were laid out carefully in the back, Jess up front with Bobby, whilst Sam drove the other truck with the rest of the group following behind. Sam and Bobby keeping each other updated on their passengers by the radios in each truck.
Sam's seemingly infinite patience with the boy was a blessing, as Dean's hangover had his own patience dangling by a thread. He felt like his whole body was on high alert waiting for Cas to appear and he had to bite his tongue several times to stop himself from snapping at Jack unfairly.
“I want to see my family. Then I'm going to stab Uriel in the face. But first, I've got to talk to a man about plan B.”
Castiel looked just as confused, tilting his head to one side as he replied “I didn't actually intend to rescue you, I'm here for a different reason. I have no idea who you are talking about.” He began to check around, working out their exit strategy.
