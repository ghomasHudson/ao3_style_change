“Well, I am your
“I hate you.” He muttered.
“Do you want me to propose to you?”
Sherlock looked from his phone. He nodded.
“You have a strong network of friends and family?” she asked.
“She’s a baby, Sherlock.”
Violet nodded. Maeve squirmed against his chest, still in the midst of waking up and fighting against it. She released a high distressed whine to which John chuckled, Mycroft raised an eyebrow and his parents looked surprised. Sherlock angled his head to get a better view at his daughter. Her blue eyes opened and then closed, the natural light too bright for her. Sherlock jiggled her slightly. She blinked herself awake, wary of the light and confused by the strange settings.
Sherlock sat in the free chair on the opposite side to John and positioned Maeve on his lap.
“The last time was the funniest,” John started.
“If you like changing nappies,” John said with a pointed look.
“I’m not putting it on her,” was all he said in response.
Maeve released an irritated growl and reached towards the table. Her tiny hand landed on the scone and fingers sunk into the cream with a wet squelch. She pulled back, looking far too pleased with herself and attempted to shove her fist into her waiting mouth. Sherlock caught it with his free hand. Violet chuckled.
The priest concluded the ceremony, “Maeve, from this day onward, no matter how dark the world may seem nor how alone and lost you may feel, you shall never be alone again, never without hope of assurance of final victory. You are a citizen of the Kingdom of God and body of believers of Christendom, in this world and in heaven. Our true Lord God shall always be with you; the love of Our Lord Jesus Christ shall always be your salvation through grace in faith, the Holy Spirit shall always minister to your heart and mind; and the multitude of God’s angels encompass you.” at that both Sherlock and Mycroft choked our a quiet laugh and exchanged an amused glance, the priest either ignored them or just didn’t heart them, “The light of God’s Truth surrounds you, the love of God encompasses you, the power of God protects you, the presence of God watched over you and wherever you are God is always with you. So it is and so it shall always be. Amen. Maeve, we bless you and you fill us with joy. God loves you and so do we.”
“So, what will it be?” The other woman asked.
“You didn’t give her the injections.”
“Something like that.”
Mycroft glanced over his shoulder, grey eyes scanning over his younger brother, reading the day’s events from each crease in his coat and suit. He sniffed softly and turned back to the infant, “she is not in the mood for crushed carrots, apparently.”
“I hadn’t.” Sherlock admitted, he kept hold of Maeve with one large hand on her head and arm supporting her back while picking up the tea with the other and taking a sip. He held it out to the side, arm bent and out of the way of the baby on his knees. “It all happened rather quickly.”
“She needs to do tummy time and then she can sit in her bouncy chair.” Sherlock told him. God, he hated the lexis used in kids activities, it was distasteful but needed apparently. Tummy time was a crucial part of her development, to strengthen her neck and back. The bouncy chair was a simple seat for her to enjoy, bright material with an arch and toys to sit above her body that moved with her own movements, she seemed to enjoy it somewhat and it meant that he could get on without holding her (not that he found that a hardship).
“And you?” John asked.
“Is she still involved with her social activities?”
“You didn’t have to come all this way,” Violet voiced politely as she placed the tea pot on the kitchen table between the three women sat there, they had arrived unannounced, something which Arabella had apologised profusely for when she’d drawn her into a long hug at the front door. Beatrice and Cecily had seen the incident in the papers and come to collect her before descending on Violet, completely out of concern according to them.
“And he’s just going to continue this?” John asked, horrified. “Kidnapping, torturing and killing kids?”
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, uninterested as ever. He held the infant out, offering her to his mother. She took her and pulled her close, eyes wandering over her small body. Her eyes then settled properly on her son.
Maeve babbled enthusiastically as though she remembered the door and turned to her father. He smiled at her and she continued babbling in the way she had become accustomed to, a steady stream of ‘d’ sounds which teased at Sherlock’s ears. He was sure that she was close to saying ‘daddy.’
Maeve whined.
“Right, see you in a minute.” John nodded and left the flat.
“Well I’ll be cool Uncle Greg, of course.”
“I’ll escort her home personally,” Mycroft shifted some important looking papers into order and placed them in a perfect pile as he stood up. John kissed Maeve on the cheek and passed her over the desk to her uncle.
“I would like to make it up to you if I can.”
Maeve looked up at him curiously, mouth open.
“The doctor’s arrived. He’s going to come with us and check her over.” He informed the brothers and Anthea.
“The two occasions in which I have featured on the front page were not my doing, I did not consent to having my pictures taken and have attempted to not only keep Maeve away from them but shield her in general. I do not want her in the public eye.” Sherlock told them, impassively.
John nodded again. “Yes.”
“My niece.” He corrected.
“I’m as comfortable as one can be on a train.”
“She was laying in the doorway, I didn’t see her.”
“Constantly,” Sherlock drawled sounding bored.
“Don’t get snappy with me Mr,” John told him, raising one eyebrow.
“Yes” Sherlock said firmly, “she’ll be no trouble. You just have to keep your eyes on her while I look at the scene.”
It was rhetorical. John didn’t say anything, instead he smiled at Maeve and ran his free hand over her hat covered head. She tried to follow the movement but failed and fell back against his tummy. Her blue eyes flicked to John and his smile widened, seemingly happy Maeve continued to rest completely against him, smiling up and pulling her soft toy with her.
“Aren’t you taking her with you?” Greg asked, craning his neck to get a better view over the table at Maeve sleeping in her chair.
“I really wish they’d hurry up,” his mother complained.
Sherlock looked up at John and nodded. He removed her wet nappy and wiped her clean, then placed a new nappy on. John at this time put the dirty clothes in a nappy bag and retrieved a set of clean clothes from the bag. It was a small blue dress with a smiley strawberry at the bottom and a matching pair of pants.
“Yes.”
She giggled in response.
“Yeah.” Greg scratched the stubble on his chin and looked down.
“There’s no reason for my presence here other to exhibit Mycroft’s extraordinary gifts of transformation, the once addict brother now a diligent father.”
“Your parents, Mycroft mentioned that you visited them yesterday, I take it things did not go well.”
Family photograph day!!!
“Obvious.” Sherlock repeated.
John looked hurt by the response, hurt for Sherlock not himself. Greg looked at the ground. Anderson just looked pleased with himself, suspicion confirmed. “I knew it.” He responded triumphantly.
Sherlock fought through the pain in his skull and the nausea threatening to build up inside of him.
“Go away.” Sherlock shouted and Maeve gurgled loudly at the sound, aware that she was not only being ignored but her daddy was close and refusing to pick her up.
“We could get away.” The blonde suggested smugly.
“I knew,” Sherlock announced as though that would help the situation.
Sherlock interrupted with a level tone, “you’d like to discuss the competence of my parenting.”
“Scientific interest.” He corrected sounding bored.
The auburn haired man stepped into sight with Greg, holding hands, and looked up at Sherlock. His grey eyes flicked over his brother and niece. “What do you need?”
“She was very quiet,” the government official flashed a fake smile.
His aunt turned her attention to John, “and you work with Sherlock?”
“That’s not a question.”
“I have some case files on hold from Lestrade. I was in the area.” The government official answered.
Sherlock lifted one hand and gestured in a small relaxed wave. “Somewhat.”
“A serial kidnapper.”
Maeve squealed, less than thrilled that his full attention was not on her and he shifted, lifting her further up his torso and mumbling, “yeah, I know, you need all of my attention.”
John shook his head. “Do you want me to go and get some shopping?”
Maeve whined.
There was nothing of interest. Sherlock sighed and went about changing Maeve, it wouldn’t be a hardship to change her now and he needed to keep up pretences. When he was done and satisfied he put her back in the sling and resigned himself to failure.
“Neither do I” Louise lied.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, abandoning tact and blurting out. “I impregnated someone.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, “perhaps another time, I’ve got to put my daughter to bed.”
There was a moment of silence, then she spoke again, softly, “you have a meeting in twenty minutes.”
“Swimmingly, I’m sure.” Sherlock told her, smiling over the rim of his cup.
“I wouldn’t let them” Sherlock told him, voice sounding strong but broken, like admitting it hurt him more than he could articulate.
Maeve released a soft snore in answer.
“Can you see her?” Donovan asked, craning her neck to look at the busy junction.
“I know you do but still, I’m not ashamed of you.”
Greg immediately started pulling funny faces at her.
“That’s a good girl,” Sherlock cooed from the other side of the sofa.
“Annoying; yes, arrogant; yes, lazy; yes…but never a burden.” There was a smirk on his lips.
“Poor thing.” Emma declared suddenly. “Well, let’s see about getting everything set up for you.”
“Then we’ll see you on Sunday.” His father stood up.
“Mrs Hudson.” Mycroft nodded.
“You’re stuck with me now.” John shrugged, smirking.
“Thank you.” John said, squeezing Sherlock’s arms.
“And you’re?”
“This must be your daughter.” He smiled. “She seems happy.”
“Yes.” Mycroft answered with a curt nod. “I need you to remain calm and understand that the situation has been dealt with.”
Mycroft nodded. He’d expected as much.
Sherlock smirked at him and rose from his chair, he flopped onto the sofa dramatically, “What does that make you?”
John narrowed his eyes.
“You’re biased.” John chuckled.
“Until you find someone, get married and have kids of your own.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer but shut it quickly, he hadn’t even thought about it. He’d been far too busy with Maeve and settling her in to think about the mother who’d abandoned her. He looked to his older brother. Mycroft was shocked by the vulnerability on his younger brother’s face and offered. “In the wind, it is believed that she left for Paris from Heathrow the night she…” he paused, unsure and glanced down at the baby on his shoulder. “abandoned Maeve.”
Sherlock allowed John to be taken by his mother and led towards the house. Sherlock picked up the baby bag and bee lined into the house and up the stairs.
Greg answered. “I would bring him here.”
Sherlock lowered himself onto the sofa with great care, his hold on Maeve firm. She squirmed in his grasp but remained asleep, nose scrunching up in the adorable fashion that Sherlock was so fond of.
“Hmmm” Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement, turning his full attention back to his daughter. She released the bottles teat with a wet pop, milk collecting on her rosy lips. He tried the bottle again but she jerked her head and kept her lips shut. The detective put the bottle down and dabbed her lips clean with the muslin.
Sherlock ushered John up the stairs while comforting Maeve. “What are we doing Sherlock?”
"A milder form but yes," Sherlock answered, "we inherit it from my father."
“I’ll be downstairs.”
The Diogenes club, despite its silence, was a rather warm place. This office, in particular, was something that one would find in a Victorian novel but it suited Mycroft through and through.
Sherlock must have gone out then. It was a bit early though. There was no text, no note. He rolled his eyes and went about his daily routine, he didn’t have to be at the clinic till this afternoon which affording him some luxuries, especially since both Sherlock and Maeve had disappeared.
“I just,” she paused. “I can’t get over the similarities. I know children usually look like their parents but she’s just, a miniature version of him. It’s amazing.”
The gardens were, as foretold, lovely. There was a nip in the air, nothing to be concerned about, but enough to warrant Maeve wearing a white fleece jacket with little ears which John called ‘adorable’ and made them buy last week. She also had on some fingerless white gloves and a pale yellow blanket that cocooned her body. She was asleep, again, and her breath came out softly in even intervals. She was resting in John’s arms as they loitered in the gardens, occasionally point out things that caught the eye – like flowers miraculously still alive and birds floating in the air. There was even a robin nest that took Sherlock’s fancy.
“Being a father?” Harry looked sceptical.
“But it makes sense,” his mother ignored her sons, “you were both christened.”
“No, I just wanted the whole thing, night to be perfect.”
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock said to his brother with a small nod. An unspoken question.
“Did your mother pick it?”
“Who is the mother?” His mother asked.
“Where’s he going?” Greg asked and John looked worried but calm enough to give his partner some space.
Harold cleared his throat quietly and asked, “Do you enjoy being a father?”
“Also, I’m not sure how aware you are of the ‘skin to skin’ contact routine that most mothers do.”
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, a small gurgling cough took his attention to Maeve and he announced. "She's just been sick."
Sherlock levelled her with a look.
“You don’t mind.” Sherlock said simply.
Siger looked up from his book and glanced at his son. The consulting detective was in the exact position that he’d settled in earlier; back on the pillows, reclined against the headboard with Maeve sprawled out against his chest. Her mouth was open and dribble had run in a thin stream down her chin and onto his pyjama top. Her eyebrows wrinkled at the sound but Sherlock’s hand kept stroking her hair softly and she seemed mollified, the wrinkles disappearing and replaced by a long drawn out sigh. Sherlock had his eyes closed but he was not asleep.
“Well, she does seem a bit paranoid but I thought it was better to be safe. She thinks it’s her ex-boyfriend trying to poison her but I’ve run a check and he seems to be clean.”
“You look awful,” Mycroft said after a moment. An observation. Not a criticism.
“It’s a perfect bedtime story.”
A yawn slipped from the new-born baby’s lips.
“That is the problem.”
“What are your takes on the situation, Mycroft?” George asked. The grey haired government official lent back in his chair and removed his glasses, carefully crossing one leg over the other.
John continued with a polite smile to their landlady, “It would just be nice to know where you are.”
“You just won’t listen,” John guessed.
Sherlock’s head snapped to him. John was addressing Maeve directly, her blue eyes opening slowly, long dark eyelashes fluttering against her cheeks. She yawned loudly.
John continued with an amused look. “And prefer not to show that they have any, they prefer reason and logic. They sit in the same room and glare at each other for hours instead of talking. Arch-enemy, I think was the term he used when I first met him.”
She started wiggling in Sally’s grasp which was not too tight as to hurt her but tight enough to be secure, she’d held a baby before. She wore a light yellow baby grow with a cream coloured Gucci coat over the top. The kid was better dressed than her and she was only a few weeks old. Sally had never owned anything with a label like Gucci.
Violet opened her mouth to speak but another much deeper voice cut in. “Untouched.”
“Do you want me to get her ready?” His mother asked.
I want to ask you a question and want your honest opinions. I love this fic and plan to continue it until we reach Maeve's first birthday, then move onto a follow-on fic, but do you think this is a good idea? Like, is it any good or is the quality just getting worse? I need to know honest opinions because I feel like this fic is just getting worse and worse, and I don't want that, and if that's what people think, I'll just edit it or something.
“Yes,” a frown formed on John’s face. “Totally ridiculous of me to listen in on a conversation my boyfriend -”
“Yes, do.” Sherlock agreed.
Siger did not look convinced, he placed a comforting hand on his wife’s shoulder. “What is it?” Violet asked, changing the subject swiftly with a wary smile.
The room was silent when Greg finished introducing Amanda Cole to the consulting detective. She sat in the client chair, her eyes flicking from Greg to the pale man with a baby on his lap. Her hand fiddled with the opposite sleeve and eventually, her eyes dropped to the floor.
“We’re following leads not chasing a criminal.”
“It makes sense.” Sherlock relaxed into the chair.
“The victims, what were they doing before they were taken?” John asked.
"I know" Sherlock responded, tone clipped and eyes severe.
“You invited me into your bed last night.”  Sherlock said simply. “Why?”
“Two secs,” he promised.
“Yes.” Mycroft agreed, conceding, “Now, can we get on with this.”
“In here,” Sherlock called back. He has his back to the door but knew the moment the shorter man crossed the threshold into the living room. He was cradling Maeve in his arms. It struck him how much bigger she was now. The first time he held her in his arms she’d been tiny. He’d been able to hold her in one arm with no trouble and now, now she was a handful. She was in the midst of waking up from a sleep.
“Microwave.”
“We’ll need to get Little Miss something to wear.”
“Do you want me to set up a meeting?” John asked, phone in hand.
Behold, this is a lengthy update and I apologize because a lot of it is the christening, and may be fairly boring (which is why this has taken so long). I am not religious and know practically nothing about christenings, bar the few I've attended so i apologize if the services is not entirely correct but I had to make do with resources.
"If you wanted to undress me John," Sherlock raised an eyebrow, "all you had to do was ask."
He exhaled and watched his breath whisk through the air like that of a dragon after breathing fire. It mingled with Maeve’s breath and evaporated into the grey air. His hand was on her stomach, keeping her tight against his chest in the papoose beneath his coat. It was cold out and his coat, though a perfect protective barrier, was open and failing in its duty. It was the pivotal moment of parenthood, choosing to keep his daughter close and warm and not himself. If that didn’t make him a good father nothing would, though he doubted that Mycroft would agree or John or Lestrade. Apparently, going on a stakeout with a baby was an ‘irresponsible act’ and shouldn’t be encouraged but with a lack of childcare or want for leaving with her somebody else left the consulting detective with little choice.
“Yes, the fruits did seem to be her favourite.” Mycroft agreed.
“Good shower?” John asked.
“You can talk,” Harry muttered. “Two months and you’re already saying the L word.”
John stopped beside the tall Christmas tree. It was large and decorated with large red and gold ball balls, the lights flickered despite the hour. It was light out and in true London fashion, the streets were heaving. Christmas was the busiest time of year in the capital. The masses of people were in a rush to do their Christmas shopping, it was quite last minute with only seven days left to the big day.
It was cold even for him.
Mycroft was close to a retort about the obviousness of her single, childless existence when his mother swooped in, probably sensing his need to be rescued. “Mycroft, I’ve been searching for you, your brother is fussing about a lost blanket or toy, and perhaps you should help him find it.”
Teething problems.
Dinner was a simple pasta dish with pesto, salad, garlic bread and chilli grilled chicken.
“Should I be worried?” Mycroft asked. He wanted to be absolutely clear.
John sat on the edge of the bed. “Who was it?”
John placed his hand on his arm and squeezed. “Everything will be fine.”
Sherlock hummed in response.
“Cherish it,” Sherlock told him. He left the ‘it will never happen again’ unspoken.
He sipped his coffee. It was delicious. The perfect start to his morning, that and the company.
“Yes.”
“I know.” He snapped at the doctor, not taking his eyes off of the screen for a second. “She’s just woven me around her tiny finger without even trying.”
“Will you come?”
“Could be.” He pursed his lips.
Violet smiled. She’d hadn’t imagined a day when both her sons would be in happy relationships and a grandchild, it was rather perfect.
“It’s the Christmas decorations.” The consulting detective said simply.
“He may not be interested in rekindling our liaisons but he will no doubt want to talk about the past a great deal, a past you weren’t involved in and wouldn’t approve of. I didn’t want you getting….” He trailed off.
“Good?” John raised an eyebrow, teasing.
Nine months, he closed his eyes (jiggling slightly without realising) and thought back nine months.
“Yes” John smiled smugly, he knew that Sherlock was out of his depth when it came to emotions and was trying.
“Only Sherlock,” John nodded and squeezed Sherlock’s arm lightly.
“Don’t be smart Sherlock.” She warned gently.
Twenty minutes at the most.
“I was about to get a coffee, would you care to join me?”
“Are you a couple?” Thompson asked. Still no tact, John made a mental note as he looked over the rim of his glass at the larger man with dark hair.
His eyes widened at the sight of John and his parents. “Oh,” his mouth formed an ‘O’.
"It's perfectly normal for babies to be sick." John told him, fixing the dark haired man with a firm look that was also reassuring.
“This morning before we left Baker Street and I reapplied when I changed her, before we left the house.”
“You’re lucky to be alive” a voice told him from the door.
Sherlock hummed again.
Maeve blinked up at him curiously.
John was pacing the flat, his phone at his ear and Maeve in his free hand. She was running her hand over his chest and gurgling loudly, in impatience.
“I’m aware John,” Sherlock snapped.
John smiled.
Sherlock had adopted his customary ‘I’m listening to a client’, his chin resting on his thumb and index finger pressed against the side of his face, though the faint movement of his eyes suggested that he was more than a little distracted by Maeve’s interruptions.
“Stop teasing.” John commanded and Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
“Would you like to hold her?”
“There is no reason that I should be separated from her.” Sherlock spoke up, voice hard but low as he glanced down at his sleeping daughter, cautious not to wake her.
Sherlock glanced down at his daughter, now fully awake and blinking at him. Her eyes adjusting to the small amount of light and recognising her father but still refusing to settle down. “Hungry?”
“It’s pancakes.” His mother said.
“Of course” Sherlock deflected quickly. The longer he could keep his parents out of this the better, they would just swoop in and try to control everything, that’s if they didn’t try to get her taken away from him.
“Chinese ok?” John asked, walking into the room as he dried his hands on a towel.
He perched himself on the edge of the bed and placed his finger in her hand. Her fingers tightened around the digit instinctively. He watched her: the small, uncoordinated movements of her arms and legs, the way she blinked without focus and her mouth opened to reveal her red gums.
“Come on, no need to cry.” John shifted her to sit on his knee so that she was facing him. Maeve continued to cry. He jiggled her up and down slightly.
“Quite.” Sherlock agreed with a tight jaw and curt nod of the head. Maeve released a high pitch whine in her sleep, drawing attention back to her.
“Not yet, homeless network are working on a possible location.” The consulting detective explained, he stepped away from the window and sat down on the sofa in a fluid motion. He gently pried his hand away from Maeve who whined at the loss and looked up at him with a pout, well, what looked like a pout. He smiled down at her and tapped her lip softly with one of his fingers. Her eyes widened, shocked by the action. “Sorry,” he apologised, voice low.
“That would be acceptable,” he nodded his head.
“The baby?” Sherlock asked sarcastically as he got to his feet and jiggled his body to sooth the infant on his shoulder. “According to DNA testing and her incredible good looks.”
Mycroft frowned. “For which, Maeve learning to crawl or the murder of a family member.”
He forced his eyes open, blinking to adjust to the bright hospital lights before darting over the private hospital room. His mother and father were huddled in the corner of the room, talking.
“No, you missed last week and she’ll wake up soon.” Sherlock said quickly, it was important that Mycroft spent time with her.
The moment Sherlock stepped into the grand ballroom there was a round of applause that startled Maeve, she immediately started crying and Sherlock thought about walking back out, instead he shifted her to rest completely against his chest and bounced her gently until she calmed down. He did this beside Mycroft and Greg, who were already talking to Molly with champagne flutes resting in their hands.
“I’m assuming he’s good.”
“We went to university together.”
“You’re not following her routine.” He inhaled sharply.
“Mycroft.” Greg said softly.
John opened the door and allowed Sherlock to manoeuvre his way inside first, he managed with little difficulty up the one step and through the doorway with the pram.
“Ever the eloquent speaker.” Greg jested.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue but the line went dead.
“Like there was any doubt.” Sherlock scoffed as he strode back into the room, freshly dressed and buttoning up his jacket as he walked.
“If you break her, you’ll have to buy me a new one.” Sherlock informed John.
May…”
wouldn’t want to start something that we couldn’t finish.”
“Fine.”
The auburn haired man ignored him in favour of focusing completely on his niece, he gently pried her hand away from her open mouth and once again smiled at her, hoping that she would smile back. Sherlock watched, craning his neck to peek over his shoulder at Maeve, she didn’t notice his presence, continuing to look at Mycroft with deep blue eyes and occasionally blink, dark eyelashes fluttering against pink skin. He watched minutely over his brother’s shoulder as the corners of her lips tugged up faintly, as though she was testing the action and the muscles it used.
"How?" John asked curiously.
“He will call John,” Mycroft assured him and then focused his attention on Anthea. “The phone.”
Mycroft inhaled sharply. “Yes.”
There was a moment of silence. Sherlock nodded slowly and added, “You have two homes.”
“A pint, anything you have.” Harold said.
“No.” Sherlock told him. “He’s victims are adolescents, sixteen or seventeen, they mimic the object of his rage, therefore his desires. He took her because he knew I was involved with the case. This is his final act.”
Sherlock hooked their new baby bag over the handles of the pram and got in position, ready to walk with the pram as John stood beside him. “She likes kids, working in a place like this you’d have to and has extensive knowledge on the babies and what they need.”
“You’ll need to put Maeve on the examination table on top of the sheet and keep her still, you don’t have to hold her firmly, just keep her arms still for me,” the nurse instructed him.
“I’m have no inclination to leave to flat,” Sherlock admitted, “but you’ll hardly notice me.”
“All of Daddy’s attention” John corrected.
“How long have you had her?”
“A little tiny bit of face paint.”
Mycroft clicked the top of his pen back in place and put it on the desk in line with another that was perfectly positioned to the side of his laptop and a notebook. He cupped his hands together on the cool glass desktop. He looked down at his own tie which was slightly off centre but he resisted correcting it in front of his brother, though the younger Holmes had already seen the thought flash through his mind.
“Ok.” John said immediately, not taking his eyes off the infant.
“He’s not coping very well is he?” Greg asked, Mycroft turned to face him and raised an eyebrow. He clarified. “God no, I meant with the separation, he’s coping just fine as a father but the separation, that’s what he struggles with.”
Sherlock nodded once before leaving in the direction of the living room, John smiled at Siger before following.  Mycroft stepped closer to his father and warned. “Tread carefully.”
“Pity. You’re the only person here capable of committing a half-decent murder. Well, you and mummy. Father has some possibility but his ego would let him down.” He went on.
“She been good?” John asked. Mycroft nodded. “Of course she was. Missing direct sunlight though.”
“Maeve.” Sherlock answered.
Maeve only gurgled irritably. John was up on his feet a second later and in the kitchen, warming a bottle for the very hungry baby. Sherlock watched him go, eyes flicking from the blonde to his daughter. Her hands were in fists bashing against his chest in annoyance as she continued to wake up.
“What’s the harm?”
Maeve tested the action a few more times before following through, pink lips pulling into a smile at her uncle in response to his smile. “Good girl, you are a very good girl.”
“You’ll see tomorrow John.”
“Christine? Grandmother Christine?” Mycroft asked.
But even the rich coffee could not distract him from what he had just heard.
Then he got the text.
It was a nice meal.
“Yes a baby” Sherlock scoffed. “A child that has recently been born, the product of reproducing.”
Sherlock frowned. “I know.”
“Bossy much, brother mine.”
"It's amazing," Molly whispered to John.
“Right.” Silvia frowned.
Anthea nodded and gave the driver directions.
“No.” Sherlock pouted.
“In the car.” The young officer replied, voice a mere squeak.
“Till your shift at the surgery.”
“I’ll get us a table and some drinks,” John informed him, unlocking the door and stepping out.
“I’m fully aware,” Sherlock shot the blonde a fake smile.
“You were pretty impressive yesterday.”
“Define important.”
“Of course,” Mycroft managed a small polite smile.
Risk of blood loss.
Sherlock found himself smiling too, “until then.”
“We don’t get along.”
“I’m fully aware.”
“You okay?” John asked.
“Ok” Molly smiled quickly, sensing the subject was sore. “Did you want something?”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and wordlessly took his niece from the younger man. Lewis sighed in relief and ducked out of the room, closing the door behind him. The auburn haired man settled Maeve into her favourite position and bounced her gently up and down, lips touching the top of her ear.
Harry and John walked side by side.
“Almost.” Sherlock nodded and craned his neck to get a better view at her. She was already snoring softly against his chest and her grip slackening slightly but not letting go.
The door shut softly and the only sounds in the room were breathing. Maeve was freshly awake and soon would want to be out of the pram and holding his full attention. He knew there were about three minutes before she was fully alert so he read through the papers in front of him quickly and satisfied, he placed them in a non-emergency pile to be looked at later. He closed the laptop on his desk and pressed the small button on the phone to summon his PA.
“Did you have a good day?” John asked, yawning again as he watched Sherlock undress.
“Spit it out. We’re going to be stuck in here for the next hour.”
Silvia nodded in defeat and gingerly picked up a piece of cucumber from her plate with a fork, she popped it into her mouth and chewed, eyes never leaving John and Maeve.
“As observant as ever.” Sherlock smirked.
Sherlock nodded and looked at the ground.
thing he doesn’t control. This is mine.
“Had.” He corrected.”
Lady Smallwood.
“Let’s hope it lasts,” Mycroft said more to himself than to his brother.
“Do not look at him for help.” Sherlock snapped. “This is the
“I’m a little busy,” he changed the subject.
John looked over his shoulder, “no, we’re fine. You can go to bed.”
Mycroft was glad that he’s decided to place a towel on his lap before feeding the infant; Maeve’s hands were sticky and pieces of fruit were going everywhere including smeared on his glass desk. It was a small mercy that she had gotten any down her clothes, only on all visible skin and her bib.
“Mum, Sherlock has a different outlook on love and emotions.” John told her.
“I’ll get her.” John announced, pushing the covers from his body and getting to his feet.
Obvious. She was having lunch with the usual suspects, the same women from his childhood, they gossiped and arranged various fund raising activities, and they were a committee. Socialites. Or as his father would say, a gaggle of hens led by his mother.
“It can’t be easy not with your career.”
"Hilarious John" Sherlock announced though his tone suggested it was nothing of the sort. "She's four weeks old, she has gas."
“But you have custody.” John deadpanned.
“Right,” his father nodded.
“I intend to make this the first of many successful Christmases which in this case means doing the unexpected.”  Sherlock rambled in explanation.
“I-yeah…it’s just” Molly started, unsure. “I didn’t know that you wanted kids.”
“She’s beautiful, Sherlock.” She managed after a moment.
“Amanda always slept through.” Carol said solemnly.
John scrubbed a hand over his forehead. “It was cute.”
“And ruin the china.”
John looked at the ground. He was definitely nervous. Worried.
“Is she ok?” John asked, picking up the menu out of habit.
“Your name is William.” Mycroft reminded him, raising his eyebrow. Sherlock shot him an ‘I know that’ look. “But I accept you point.”
“She’s not a thing.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, considering it and shook his head.
There was a chorus of disappointed ‘ohs’ and John shook his head in disbelief, he hadn’t expected them to take to Sherlock quite so easily and now he wouldn’t hear the end of it. “Be safe.” John instructed him, leaning towards him slightly.
“Crucial.”
“I’m hardly overexerting myself” Sherlock scoffed; he used the hand that was not currently supporting his daughter to caress the soft hairs atop of her head.
“If I agree, will you guarantee that I will not have to attend a single church service?” Sherlock spoke up, turning to face his mother and narrowing his eyes at her critically.
“You’ve got ideas,” John voiced.
Anthea stepped into the glass office. The elder Holmes was lent against the desk, one leg crossed elegantly over the other while Sherlock sat on the small sofa, focused on nothing in particular. Mycroft glanced up from the file he was reading; the file of Liam Ashcroft that she’d composed for him, and noticed the memory stick in her hand. She handed it to him.
“Lestrade called; Robert Innes was found alive.”
“You’ve been gone three hours.” Sherlock pointed out.
“I know.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over the blondes face for a second. “They’re your family, which means they are mine now.”
“Sherlock, I do need your help but I can’t let you bring Maeve.”
“How are you going to tell them?”
Sherlock frowned. “Isn’t it obvious? Amanda is poisoning herself so that she has an alibi. She’s going to try and kill her sister with poison, something that doesn’t kill straight away but when correctly dosed, will kill.”
Mycroft shook his head. “Has Sherlock responded?”
John shook his head and smiled, “You sit down, and I’ll get my own once I put her down.”
The baby jerked at the sound, startled and began screaming. Sherlock cursed, ignoring the shocked looks from John and Greg, who hardly ever heard him swear, and moved back to the cot. “Shhh” he attempted to sooth her. After a few moments he scooped her into his arms, supporting her head and cradling her to his body. He jiggled slightly until she settled down somewhat and flicked his gaze back to the grey haired man, whose chocolate brown eyes were baring into him like he’d grown a second head. “What are you doing here?” Sherlock asked, tone lacking its usual harshness.
The dark haired man sighed, “It was taken the night I spent in hospital.”
Mycroft opened the door as quietly as possible and peeked into Sherlock’s childhood bedroom. His mother was wondering what Sherlock was getting up to and instead of coming up herself, Mycroft had volunteered.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and climbed out of the cab.
Greg sighed to himself, resting his hands on the handle of the pram and peering in. Maeve was fast asleep, breath coming out in short even puffs, one mitten covered hand by her face and the other underneath her blanket. She was wrapped up, warm and content. Her face still slightly red and scarce black hair covered by her small hat. “You’re just completely loveable aren’t you?” He asked himself more than her.
“That was disgusting,” John announced as he strolled into the living room with Maeve in his arms. From his expression, one might think he’d just returned from a particularly gruesome crime scene and not changing his daughter’s nappy.
“Shall we go in?” John changed the subject, “you can tell me about it later and, maybe, I could tell you about Afghanistan.”
Sherlock frowned and paused in his ministrations, he dropped his hand from his daughter’s back and placed it instead on her backside, supporting her as she drooped against his front. “I was going to say,” he cleared his throat, “that I’m sorry.”
Mycroft snorted. John didn’t bother hiding his amusement as he started laughing, Sherlock scowled at him but it only spurred the doctor on. His mother released him but kept her hand on his arm, beaming up at him. “She is a credit to you Sherlock.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “I know.”
“Thank you.” John stood up and rocked Maeve.
John lent up and pressed a quick kiss to his lips before dropping his head back down onto the pillow. “You are a genius after all.”
“How old?”
“Sweets, really?” Mycroft asked in disbelief.
“I have some.” Violet interrupted.
“A normal reaction to the vaccine,” Sherlock answered, the ‘obvious’ silent.
“You’ll make yourself sick and then you won’t be happy.” He tried to reason. It always worked when Sherlock did that, or it usually did, it didn’t stop her from being awake all night crying, though. “Please, please stop crying.”
“My parents,” John started, clearing his throat, “would like to meet you, if it’s not too much trouble, they’re going to come and spend the weekend. They want to see where we live, spend some time with Maeve and meet you, they’re very interested in you after meeting Sherlock.”
Mycroft looked up with a frown. He was sat on the edge of the desk, his phone in his hand.
The consulting detective did not respond, he walked straight into the dining room where his father was setting the table and took his seat on the edge of the table, beside it sat a large beanbag with straps for Maeve to rest in wile they ate. He placed the carseat on the table and went about unstrapping Maeve.
“I’m not and it was barely a scratch,” Sherlock assured him, turning his attention to the other’s situated around the table, his tone light and slightly mocking. “He worries.”
“We could come up for a weekend.”
“I know,” Sherlock mumbled, “I’d just rather you didn’t say it.”
Sherlock shook his head and picked up one half of his scone. He bit into it and placed it immediately back on the small plate, he wiped the bits of cream and jam from the corners of his mouth with his fingers.
Sherlock snorted and gave John his ‘are you an idiot’ look, he scoffed. “I’m pretty sure she’s the most beautiful baby I’ve ever seen.”
“That’s his stresser.” Greg sighed.
“She deserves everything.” Sherlock muttered.
“She’s tired,” John announced with a yawn.
Maeve gurgled loudly.
He stood up and walked towards his bedroom. The door was slightly ajar and the room dark except for the small nightlight that he’d purchased for Maeve, it projected the stairs onto the walls and ceilings in a light blue light. John was asleep, lain on his back with one arm over his chest and the other around the long pillow he’d purchased much like someone would hug a partner. The pillow was in an arrow shape and inside was his daughter sleeping soundly, her breath coming out evenly with tiny snores escaping her. She was now in a simple white baby grow with a blanket covering her, the pillow making sure she did not move in her sleep or hurt herself.
“Yes, but where is she now?” Sherlock shouted.
“I’m going to have a shower, did you need anything?” John asked, watching his partner and the baby.
“You’re quicker than most John,” Sherlock said simply as though it were a compliment, it was in some messed up way, so the blonde just shrugged. “In penance, she has agreed to pay for anything we need for the evening.”
Dimmock continued, “The CCTV tapes were wiped clean and there are no fingerprints on the body.”
Sherlock took no notice of him.
“Then, wait, why did we come here?”
“Yes but look at you, a consulting detective.”
“Yes,” he nodded and sat up straight, Maeve looked confused now that she was confronted with her papa’s torso but she quickly grabbed at the skin. “Let’s get you some lunch.”
“Yes, two days ago.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, disappointment and a challenge in the one gesture.
“That bad?” Greg asked, sympathy leaking from every pore.
“Why? You want a lay in?”
Sherlock looked horrified by the suggestion and blinked up at his partner. He corrected, “She loves me.”
Mycroft watched a look of disgust flash on his brother’s face. “Anybody?”
“She’s fussy.” Sherlock announced as he allowed John to take her from him, with a small annoyed grumble from Maeve as she settled in John’s shorter secure arms and went back to her bottle with energy. John rolled his eyes at the consulting detective as he picked up the journal and began reading, eyes skimming over the scribbled handwriting with interest.
“She needs clothes Mycroft,” Clarice argued as she folded and placed the new clothes into age-appropriate piles.
“May I?” He asked when he was satisfied.
Sherlock nodded. Mycroft always insisted on manners.
He let his eyes fall shut
He opened his eyes to John hovering above him, a crying baby pressed firmly against his chest with one arm supporting her and the other on his torso, his hand pressing over Sherlock’s in an effort to stop the bleeding.
“Mycroft’s been over?” His mother asked as she crouched down on the floor to get a better look at her granddaughter.
Harold nodded. “You boys have been through a lot it would seem.”
John rolled his eyes. “Stop being difficult.”
Sherlock waved his hand in dismissal. “Whatever you recommend.”
“Never.” Sherlock articulated carefully, glancing at John before removing his jacket and placing it on the back of one of the chairs. He unbuttoned his sleeves and rolled them to his elbows.
“Ahhh somebody is paying attention, at last.” A proud look passed over the consulting detective’s face as he looked at his partner. John blushed and looked down at the ground.
“She was rather…excitable for the better part of an hour. After some difficulties with dinner, she settled down somewhat.” He looked over his shoulder as John came into the room.
“Please” Sherlock rolled his eyes “I’m hardly the childish one.”
John placed the muslin on Sherlock’s lap and they laid her across it. They undressed her, and John quickly changed her wet nappy. Then, they wrestled her into the new. Sherlock ran his hand down her back. It was softer than her previous outfit and he was certain that would help calm her.
Mycroft rose to his feet a moment later, “I’ll accompany you.”
“I finish at Eleven, I could meet you.” John suggested.
“You’re more distressed than she is.” John observed.
“What exactly do you classify a date as?” John asked, expectantly. They had paused now.
“Mycroft, tell us this instant.” His mother demanded.
“How did it go with your parents?”
“At least they’re not projectile.”
“And you think it’s going to help?”
Sherlock gave him a ‘stop being an idiot’ look and answered simply, the voice of the devoted father. “She woke at five and refused to settle back down no matter what I did, I thought it better to get out of the house and enjoy the morning air.”
“You’ve gone soppy” Murray commented with mocking smile, he placed a hand on John’s shoulder and looked at him with doe eyes.
John picked up the bags of presents from beneath the tree and gave Sherlock a look. “Get your coat on you ninny or we’ll never go and your mother will phone and I’ll blame you.”
Sherlock nodded and turned his attention to Maeve.
“She needs breakfast Sherlock.” His mother said. Maeve blinked sleepily, her head resting on her grandmother’s shoulder. “I just thought I’d get her for you, give you some…alone time.”
“There was no need for rudeness.” Mycroft lifted the tip of his umbrella off of the floor and examined it.
Sherlock sniffed. “She is four months old, she needs her brain stimulated
“Quite. Though if I am to gather anything, I will be without sleep for quite some time.” Mycroft managed a tight smile at that.
“You could have woke me” Sherlock announced his presence from the doorway.
John smirked and nodded. He pulled out a clean nappy and wipes along with clean clothes. It was a simple floral romper with short sleeves and a matching hat. John looked down at the hat and the back up at Sherlock, “perhaps we should forget the hat.”
Maeve babbled in response. He nodded, accepting that as an agreement and threw the notebook back onto his chair. He drew his legs round underneath his body and sat on them, placing his hands on his knees. “Now, what shall we talk about today?” He asked.
“You place the newborn baby straight onto the mother’s chest, ensuring bonding through skin to skin contact.” Mycroft summarised.
John’s head snapped up and he looked at the consulting detective with a mixture of amusement and surprise. “What?”
“I apologise for the inconvenience.” Sherlock drawled, voice dripping with sarcasm.
Siger chuckled. “I know.”
John had woken up alone, the bed beside him was cold and he had a sneaky suspicion that the consulting detective hadn’t come to bed last night. Maeve was gone. Sherlock had her then. He sighed, heaved himself out of bed and went to the bathroom before checking. The flat was empty. He even checked the downstairs hallway where they kept Maeve’s pram, it was gone.
“The alcohol.”
Mycroft turned to Anthea and she looked down, a simple gesture. She was staying here then. He stepped forward and Doctor Green showed him through the corridor, his heart pounding against his chest with each step. They stopped outside a room. The door was open. Inside, a nurse was currently wrapping a baby in a light pink blanket.
“I assume you didn’t bring me here to chat.” John broke through the silence. Greg looked taken back. The blonde shut his eyes and sighed, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you.”
Mycroft retrieved a towel from the cupboard and picked his niece up, wrapping her up. She wiggled her arms out and reached out to touch his face, bumping his cheek and nose with her fist.
“Why?”
“I don’t know that scrunching face might be magic.” John joked. He’d caught a glimpse of the face in person and then on Sherlock’s phone, his screen saver.
But she looked adorable and was protected against the sharp breeze, strapped to his chest in the papoose.
Sherlock nodded and left the room.
Mycroft nodded.
Maeve looked up at him. Her blue eyes were wide and curious, there was something else there, almost like love, and she flashed him a gummy smile.
“Dinner? No.” Mycroft admitted with a small smile, turning to face his brother.
“He’s with a patient now, I’ll let him know you’re here Mr …”
John snorted.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded. “She was never the type to slow down.”
“Good day, love?” John asked picking up his tea.
“It’s just around the corner,” Sherlock assured them.
“Good morning,” John smirked at the sight of an overly tired Sherlock. His hair was messy from sleep and his eyes still adjusting to the light, he blinked and rubbed his eyes.
Jim wrinkled his nose, “her clothes were dirty.”
Sherlock glared, it was less effective with his lips pulled into a pout and chin resting gently on his daughter’s head. He was still rocking her softly.
“Then go have your shower.” John pulled a pillow over his head.
“An inconvenience but never a problem.”
“Hello my darling,” he greeted her.
.” A Mycroft's smile was too smug for Sherlock's liking.
Sherlock frowned. “You’re concerned about work.”
Sherlock poked his head round the corner and glared at the back of his brother’s head, “like you don’t already know.”
“Aww, I’m sure something will come up.” She ran her hand down his arm.
“Do you want me to show you to your room?” John asked. “You can get settled in before dinner.”
“Well, behave.”
Sherlock hummed.
Here he was again.
“It’s always the broccoli,” Sherlock said more to himself than anybody else. He formed a hook with his finger and scooped the remaining vegetable out of her open mouth before handing her a piece of cooked carrot to pacify her. He used a wipe from the pack on the table to clean his finger and looked up at Lestrade, he was watching them with an amused smile that looked lopsided on his tired face.
“Explains why he doesn’t listen to me.” Greg voiced.
It was a simple pale grey with clouds on it. Sherlock seemed to like it.
“Maeve.”
“Sherlock,” John said softly, not wanting to shock him from his thoughts too violently. “Do you want me to stay with her?”
"I was in the mood for Chinese," Sherlock added nonchalant, crossing one leg over the other.
“There is nothing that you could offer me right now that would help to calm down my daughter.” Sherlock told her.
Maeve growled loudly. John sighed, “You don’t like it when I tell your daddy off do you.”
“Can we go now?” Sherlock repeated his earlier question.
“Maeve.” Sherlock managed, the air completely sucked from his chest.
“No.” Sherlock answered. John released the breath that he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. “I have never traded sexual favours for drugs, sometimes I would mix the two but I wouldn’t allow someone to have that kind of power over me.”
“Since Sunday.” Sherlock shot back.
Sherlock nodded again. “You’re still coming on Wednesday.”
“Sweetheart,” he said a little louder.
“You tired love?” John asked.
“A consultation wouldn’t go amiss.”
“But they only just got here.”
“Yes, you tend to choose romance over fact through your prose is admirable and the attention to detail is there in some moments of clarity. Give them the facts, nothing more or less. They’ll stop asking and you can write about whatever mystery you chose with your eponymous hero.”
“I understand perfectly well. You’re a sexual sadist. You. Get. Off. On torturing and killing people. You’ve raised the stakes, taken my daughter to extort money from me, you know I’ll pay. I have no choice.”
“That’s a shame.”
“And incredible genes.”
“Neither were you.” The blonde reminded him with a tight lipped smile.
Thank you for all your lovely comments last time, I was feeling anxious and just meh about this fic and you made me realize why I write it and love it. I even re-read a large chunk of it again. So yeah, thank you again, you guys are fab. Let me know what you think and just correct any mistake, their are probably loads in there.
Louise cleared her throat, “it’s just that this kind of behaviour is very worrying.”
There was silence as Sherlock exited the pub.
“You hardly have to ask.” Sherlock drawled. He unstrapped Maeve and slowly picked her up, careful to support her sleeping head and body in both of his large hands. Her face scrunched up in the adorable way it always did when someone or something disturbed her sleep. He positioned her in his favourite way and she sighed in her sleep against his neck, a clear sign that she wasn’t ready to wake anytime soon.
“Incorrigible” Sherlock muttered beneath his breath, to a stranger it would seem like annoyed statement but those better acquainted with him were able to see beneath, the corner of his mouth tugging up in amusement and fondness seeping into his baritone.
Mycroft sighed and sat back in his seat, placing one arm on the back of the chair and crossing one leg over the other. “Yes, I’m rather hoping that the addition of a granddaughter will outweigh my omitting the truth, it’s guaranteed in fact.”
Sherlock works a case for Dimmock and John enjoys an evening down the pub with his army buddies.
“You didn’t tell us anything about her.”
John looked like he’d been hit, more shocked than angry, and slightly concerned. “No, no, no.”
Maeve.
Sherlock didn’t look entirely convinced.
Sherlock chuckled and ran his large hand down his daughter’s small back again. “She certainly prefers to spend tummy time in this position.”
When Mycroft arrived at the flat, Sherlock was in the process of setting up his experiment – the taste test. His notepad was at the ready, though he didn’t really need it, and the bowls were closer to him but not close enough for Maeve to reach. She was watching him with wide curious eyes. He had the first bowl beside him with a spoon in it, ready to go. It was a potato puree. Mycroft paused in the threshold, his face a neutral mask as his eyes roamed over his brother and niece in seconds, drinking in all the information they offered and making deductions in his mind. Any average person would not see through that look but Sherlock did, as he was often on the other end of it, doing the deducing himself. Mycroft’s lips pulled into a thin grim smile, the one somebody may make upon entering a dirty house and being offered to sit down. This smile, in Mycroft’s case, meant that he was pleased to be there.
Sherlock nodded.
The door opened to reveal Mycroft, wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and light blue tie, no jacket, with his mobile in hand and his other resting on the door. He put his mobile into his pocket.
There was confusion written over his face.
“Two?” Violet asked, confused.
Her eyes flicked to him.
“Unequivocal.”
Mrs Hudson levelled him with a serious look, “don’t let him go.”
“Yeah, I’m sure.” John raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock reached out, hesitantly. Large hands reaching round to cradle the baby’s head – he may not know much about children but he was well aware of how a baby could not support its own head, it was fragile – and the other hand reached beneath her to grab her body. She was small, almost fitting entirely in his hands with the padding of the blankets. She made a sound at being moved, barely audible. He pulled her to his chest. A envelope lay on the floor – wet from the cold ground, hidden under the baby’s body – Sherlock shifted the baby to rest on one arm, head on his elbow and body supported by the rest of his long arm. He picked up the envelope with her free arm.
“Time for the secret Santa.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and muttered. “Brotherly affection.”
He knew it was a little over the top but he was dealing with rather a dramatic family. Needs must.
“An appointment?” John frowned.
Mycroft smiled. “Yes, like most things.”
“Solid foods.”
Greg took a breath. “Well, people are crazy.”
“This,” he told her, showing the small green ball to her, “is something daddy has been working on.”
John grinned to himself and picked up Maeve’s bag.
“Your brother is on his way back and your parents will be twenty minutes. The traffic is good.”
“Sherlock.” Both Mycroft and his mother said at the same time.
“Well, don’t.” Sherlock told him simply.
"I'll check her eyes, ears and her heart for any abnormalities." John instructed him on the next steps he'd be taking. Sherlock gave a silent nod and John continued with the examination.
He placed it on the table and dipped his finger into the large dollop of cream. He popped it into his mouth.
Sherlock nodded and watched as the front door opened to reveal John’s parents.
His heart panged but he forced the feeling aside. Maeve was safe.
“Chloe, sit down.” Greg said.
Sherlock’s chest heaved with an impatient sigh. He shifted Maeve ignoring her grumbling as he cradled her in one long arm and took the offered bottle, immediately offering it to Maeve. She suckled from it immediately. John hooked the muslin over the consulting detective’s shoulder, spending a small moment watching her drink enthusiastically before looking up at Sherlock. His eyes were fixed to his daughter, watching her as though she was the most interesting thing that he had ever seen.
John lent forward, mindful of the child between them, and placed a chaste kiss on his partner lips.
“You ordered for me.”
“Well, until then, I guess I’ll just have to get a butterfly painted on my cheek.” His smile widened.
“We appreciate your co-operation.” Louise added.
“She can’t speak.”
The cab pulled away from the curb, travelling at a relaxed pace down the street and into the London traffic. John watched the city pass through the window while Sherlock was lent over the carseat between them, angling his long body round the seat, his arm resting on the side closest to John and face directly in front of Maeve; instead of his usual pristine posture. He was alternating between his usual face of indifference and smiling at Maeve, changing every six seconds and observing his daughter’s reactions.
John couldn’t help but smile at that.
John pushed himself up into a sitting position and stared down at the consulting detective. “I was worried. I’ve been worried all day. Worried sick. You think I can sleep after what happened today.”
She nodded towards Sherlock and mouthed, ‘sleeping?’
“I am aware.” Sherlock snapped.
“I’m going to take her to bed,” Sherlock picked up his daughter, careful not to wake her. He stopped in the doorway and told John, “I love you.”
Mycroft cracked a closed mouth smile and nodded his head in a silent confirmation. Sherlock looked up at the ceiling, “Yes, but none of us is immune apparently.”
“I trust you solved the case then” Beatrice voiced.
“And you?” She asked, eyes flicking over his usual black trousers and pale grey shirt, with the camel dressing gown over the top.
“Fine.” Sherlock answered.
“Deleted it.” He repeated.
“Let me get this straight,” John said. He was spread out on his back across the large picnic blanket wearing a pair of denim shorts and a short sleeve checked shirt. A pair of sunglasses stopped the sun from reaching his eyes. “You solved your first case at nine?”
“I don’t want to disturb you.” His father said in a hushed, almost embarrassed tone.
“Better not to upset her further.”
“The gap between kills?”
“I rather think that I am mother,” Mycroft jested.
“Very productive.” Violet confirmed with a smile. She gestured to the other armchair, Sherlock’s chair, and asked, “May I?”
“That’s nice. I’m sure they loved that, there’s plenty to decorate.”
“Case finished?” Mycroft asked, not bothering to glance up from Maeve.
“Whatever cost it takes.” Sherlock told him. He kept his voice even and it was scary, far worse than if he had chosen to shout.
“Her.”
Sherlock watched Maeve look around the remaining chunks of vegetables and pick up a piece of peach between her sticky fingers. He pursed his lips and glanced at Lestrade. “You haven’t spoken to him yet.”
“No, I suppose not.”
“Put her in the nursery.” Sherlock instructed.
“Screaming.”
Mycroft nodded in understanding and instructed the driver of the change of destination. Sherlock craned his neck to glance at Maeve and smiled in amusement, she was watching the world curiously over his shoulder. He continued to rub her back until she released a series of quiet burps and finished with spitting up some milk over his shoulder onto the waiting muslin. Satisfied with the outcome, Sherlock brought her forward and manoeuvred her to rest in one arm and removed the muslin from his shoulder. There was a small amount of milky white sick on it, he folded it and used a clean corner to dab her mouth.
Mycroft nodded. “A gender neutral name. Also meaning, little bird.”
Sherlock opened all the presents quickly and methodically as Maeve focused on the small duck. They were all age appropriate toys. “This is,” he cleared his throat, “very kind of you.”
“You need help.”
Anthea smiled and nodded, she waited for him to step out of the room and followed, closing the door and locking the office behind them. He walked with his usual air of superiority despite the odd looks he received for carrying an infant through the hallways. The doors to their usual meeting room were open and he walked inside, pausing long enough for his eyes to flick over the occupants of the room and take in their surprised expressions. A smile threatened to break on his lips but he remained indifferent.
“Can we be sure that this was an isolated incident?” Michelle asked.
And, on a side note I've managed to get Hamlet tickets for me and my friends, so happy.
“Yes, and she’ll need to sleep the rest of the day too.”
He ran a hand over her towel covered back.
“I kiss you all the time.” Sherlock frowned, still addressing his daughter.
Mycroft sighed and Siger stepped in. “Don’t be mean to your brother.”
“I’ll take that as a no,” Greg mumbled to himself, pushing out his chair and rising to his feet. He walked around the table, dropped into a crouch beside Maeve and gingerly reached out to touch the tinted pink cheek as she snored softly, mouth parted. He addressed her, “come to your uncle Greg.”
“You’re here about the body.” Molly guessed.
“Well,” Greg cleared his throat. “Keep me updated.”
John nodded quickly. “Thank you.”
A flash of blonde caught his attention. His eyes darted to the source, a woman amongst the crowd wearing a knee length dress and heels. She moved with the group towards the gate. Too fast. Sherlock pushed himself off of the wall and craned his neck in an attempt to get a better view of her. Nothing. She was moving too fast and all he could see was her back. He frowned.
John nodded and opened the door wide enough to reveal the doctor, the same brown haired doctor he’d seen in the hospital the night after Maeve had been abandoned on his doorstep. He was holding a black medical bag and wearing a light jacket over a jumper and dark jeans. He looked up and noticed Sherlock.
He walked over to the first car and opened the door, Sherlock immediately stepped out leading with one long leg and appraised the church with critical eyes before turning back to the car and accepting the carseat from his partner. He stepped away from the car to allow John access out and held the carseat in one hand, Maeve snoozing gently inside it but shielded from the sun with a blanket resting atop of it.
“Come, sit, we’re just finishing lunch.” Sherlock sat back down and pulled his chair forward.
“You have more than a list,” Mrs Hudson said.
“Strangers?” Mycroft asked.
“And Sherlock?” Siger pressed. “Is he ok?”
She growled.
“You don’t have anything?”
“Stop now.” John warned, his voice level, warning them both and not just Sherlock. Interesting.
“Thank you for watching her, I’ll pay your drying cleaning.” Sherlock offered.
John blinked and looked up at the house that they were standing in front of. “Whose house is this?”
Sherlock managed a smile at that and nodded. He lifted Maeve up and away from his chest. She looked around, suddenly worried. Sherlock hushed her, “it’s okay, we’re here.”
“Like that’s ever stopped you before.”
“And I thought it was family, how wrong I’ve been.” Sarcasm dripped from his tone.
“Thank you.”
“Thank you Mummy.” He looked up at her as she crossed the room, stopped beside his face and bent down to kiss him on the forehead. Then, she proceeded to kiss Maeve on the cheek.
Sherlock nodded and John mouthed a quick ‘thank you’ at him. The grey haired detective climbed into the car and closed the door, leaving the pair outside with the child.
John put the bottle down and picked Maeve up, offering her to the consulting detective. Sherlock took her and pulled her against his chest, her head resting on his shoulder. He started rubbing her back in practiced circular motions. He titled his head and kissed behind her ear. “She’s hot.”
John looked up and frowned. Sherlock was being polite.
“Are you just going to stand there?” Sherlock asked, confused. He turned to face his father.
Maeve released a long steady breath in her sleep.
“Greg, you alright mate?” John asked.
“Anthea,” Mycroft spoke first.
“And you, you’re a good uncle, sir.”
Sherlock was sat in the middle of the floor, bum on his feet and hands on his thighs. His eyes scanning over the arch he had created on the floor (freshly cleaned) with sheets of paper from a case file. He wore a pale grey, almost white shirt, the top two buttons undone, with a pair of dark blue slacks. His jacket was still in the bedroom and replaced with his blue dressing gown, undone and hanging loosely on his slim shoulders.
“Excellent and you’ll want to register her soon, you’ll want to be thinking about names for the birth certificate.”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes in the way he often did when he was deducing and pulled Maeve away from his body, and towards the blonde. John took her and turned her around to face him. He looked down at her with a fond smile and asked, turning back to face the front of the queue. “Have I told you about the time your daddy and I met?”
“Ready.”
“Cheeky is not an adjective that should be used to describe a fully grown man.”
Anthea snorted in amusement.
Mycroft grinned and lifted Maeve back, over his head. Sherlock took her wordlessly, replacing his brother’s hands with his own and placing her beside him on the sofa on her back, side pressed against his torso. He offered her his hand to her and she grabbed it, grasping two long fingers in her fists.
“Someone complained.” Sherlock said.
“A childish parent” she corrected.
John sighed.
A knock on the door captured his attention, he looked up and frowned at Gavin Lestrade.
“Yes, the heat.” John nodded, tapping his thigh. “And stress.”
We carry on from where we left off: Mycroft has just told his parents that he is a father, a father of a newborn baby whose mother died in childbirth. Now he has a bit of explaining to do and one thing is for sure, he's not going to be getting rid of his parents anytime soon.
“Because he knows what I want.” Sherlock replied, casual, as he crossed one leg over the other and wiped the drool from his finger on a napkin.
Siger looked up from the page of his newspaper for a moment, eyes flicking from his wife to his youngest son and granddaughter; then back down the paper. Mycroft paid them little attention, his focus completely on his newspaper and Greg looked up from his phone.
She added, “And extra holiday.”
“I hate cats.” Sherlock said simply.
"I know," Sherlock snapped, "I have shirts that can attest to that."
“It may have escaped your attentions mother, but neither of us are religious.” Sherlock announced, voice controlled and not giving anything away.
“Goodbye, Mycroft.” Sherlock picked up his coat and strode out of the office. He made sure to let the door slam on his way out, served him right the interfering mother hen. It wasn’t as though Sherlock wasn’t nagged enough to find a man by his mother, he didn’t need Mycroft encouraging such behaviour.
“And you live…” his mother trailed off.
“And you.”
Siger added quickly. “Something about the flammability of materials, the curtains were the only sample of that particular blend of material.”
"No," the blonde managed a weak smile, "you're right, seeing her makes me wonder when I'll have children and I know that it's perfectly natural."
The baby repeated its earlier whine sound, a sound of discomfort on the verge of crying.
“God. Is she ok?” John asked. He immediately embraced the consulting detective, careful not to hurt the baby between them and ran his finger over her cheek.
Sherlock smirked, he hated the cardigan, it was knitted and pink, he hated the colour pink, even in light shades. He said unconvincingly, "that was a shame."
Mycroft nodded.
Sherlock sat, staring at his mother as she fussed around Maeve, showing her each present before opening it and allowing the seven-month-old to run her hands over it before moving onto the next.
“Nope, there is absolutely no possibility.” Sherlock informed him. “Why else would he kill the victims despite the ransom being paid? He can’t control his impulses, he gets carried away. Their death is his…sexual gratification.”
“He wouldn’t have to,” Sherlock answered. “If he had a weapon, which would have been enough to keep them silent and get them to his vehicle, assuming he had parked it close by.”
The consulting detective moved and acted with practised ease in every aspect of life, including with baby Maeve in toll, he was still capable of running around and weaving through the cIty. The inclusion of Maeve changed very little in terms for Sherlock, he'd adapted his routine to care more about another person though having a child was the easiest thing in the world. Sherlock and Maeve were inseparable.
Sherlock rose an eyebrow.
“Do you like it?” Greg asked sheepishly from behind him.
“No, I didn’t expect you would. She’s a baby after all. I just wanted you to know that your mother appreciates you coming.”
“You go.” Mycroft cleared his throat and his eyes flicked to the unmoving form on the floor. “I’ll stay with him.”
“She hasn’t growled before,” Sherlock explained and if his father didn’t know any better he’d say his son was slightly embarrassed by his actions “it’s a reflex like crying or gurgling but it’s about the feeling, babies enjoy the feeling just like she enjoys the way my chest rumbles when I laugh or talk. It’s based purely on sensation but will later develop to indicate displeasure.”
“How are you going to cope Mycroft?” His mother’s question was tinged with concern.
Anthea nodded. “When he wakes, let me know and I’ll have it picked up or prepared.”
“Does it ever?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock took a deep breath and placed his lips on Maeve’s head. The soft dark strands tickled his nose and mouth but he ignored the sensation in favour of keeping his lips there, in a lingering kiss. He pulled back enough to place his nose on her head and his lips, lingering at her temple. “I love you.”
“What? Where have you been?” The blonde was quickly losing his temper.
“Yes,” Sherlock stepped backwards and looked down at his daughter.
“Home.” He announced, not taking his eyes from her.
“A consulting detective,” Sherlock offered, “the only one in the world.”
“Mundane at best.” Sherlock moved his hand to pinch at the bridge of his nose.
Sherlock is recovering, he shares some tender moments with his father between his mother's fussing and the arrival of her nosy friends.
With a glance of John, still sleeping happily, he left the room. In the kitchen Maeve started to fuss, releasing a cry of discomfort as Sherlock hummed a tune that he’d heard on the radio, it was a ridiculous song that John had like very much though it was designed for teenage girls. He opened the fridge, there was a shelf purely for Maeve, a line of pre-made bottles and soft teething objects for when the moment occurred.
“I’m not a complete idiot Sherlock, I can’t deduce an air pilot by their thumb but I know you.”
“It’s a nice name” Sherlock shrugged.
“And this has nothing to do with the fact she was the only one accepting of your…
“Speak of the devil.”
“Sight-seeing,” Mycroft said with an overly amused tone, obviously fake.
“Are you tired?” He asked as he brought her into his favourite position and started swaying side to side in small consistent movements. He knew she wouldn’t answer but it was fantastic to talk to her, better than John and his skull, she was the brightest conductor or light he had ever known.
“You still working the case?” John asked, yawning.
Sherlock nodded eagerly like a child that had bargained for an extra ten minutes at bed time and Greg reached out to touch the younger man’s arm, running it over his bicep in a comforting motion before dropping his hand back to his side.
Sherlock frowned and looked up at his brother. “Sentiment.”
“Fine.”
He gestured towards the hallway, the blonde looked confused but got up and followed him anyway. The moment he left Siger released a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding. Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “I told you he was attentive.”
Sherlock shook his head.
"Poor thing" John cooed, "starved for attention from your genius father and his partner, what are we going to do?"
Mycroft looked at the ground, “I know of her.”
"And you've had your stitches out?" She continued.
He plucked the monitor from the pile of newspapers beside the sofa and turned it on. The image of his sleeping daughter appeared and he placed it on the table.
“And sexual?” Sally asked, “Sadist enjoy inflicting pain on their partners, right?”
Sherlock goes off on his own, John worries and Mycroft know's everything.
Sherlock’s smiled widened. “Yes, a blessing.”
“Well,” John edged closer to the detective.
“I’ll bring those out right away.” Angelo disappeared with a nod.
“Do you see that?” Claire asked. She was reclined on the sofa, top rolled up and round belly exposed, glistening with the latest anti-stretchmark cream she had brought.
Mycroft let himself into his parents’ house early, he’d managed to get away earlier than expected and thought he should collect Maeve. Though Sherlock trusted his parents with her, he’d want her back as soon as possible and a trip through London at night with a baby was not wise. He would take her back to the flat.
It was then that John noticed the awake infant in his partner’s arms. She was swaddled in a snow suit and looking rather awake despite the hour. Sherlock was wearing his coat and clothes too. He swept out of the room. John turned to look at the clock on the bedside table. It flashed.
“I know.” John smiled.
Sherlock frowned but nodded and picked up the bottle that Mrs Hudson had left.
“Anything else?”
Sherlock manoeuvred the pram through the doors and into the hallway. Maeve was on the cusp of sleep again, wrapped back up nice and warm. He hated to disturb her but needs must. He reached into the pram and picked up his daughter, the same way as before, in one smooth and fast movement towards his chest. She moaned but didn’t wake up completely. He then shifted to hold her with just one long arm and hooked the baby bag over his arm. Then he grabbed the two bags from mothercare they had stored under the pram.
Siger poke his head around the corner. “Morning all.”
“I’ll need everything you have.” Sherlock instructed as he crossed the cordoned off area to Sally, he stopped directly in front of her eyes immediately settling on Maeve. She was wriggling but no longer whining.
Sherlock hummed but said nothing. He wordlessly offered the baby to his brother, Mycroft stood up in a flash and scooped the baby from his little brothers protective hold, cradling her against his torso. Siger’s eyes widened at the sight, his sons were getting along and Mycroft seemed to adore the child as much as Sherlock.
“Gregory,” Mycroft voice was collecting but his eyes betrayed him, he looked panicked “I thought I’d made this clear, I have no desire for children.”
Mycroft admitted.
She released John and stood in the centre of the room. “Mycroft is already at the reception venue with Gregory, making sure the arrangements are in order and that girl -”
“But she’s eating solids now and they’re more…fully formed.”
“Is your daddy ignoring us?” He asked her.
“She’s cute,” The waitress tucked the round tray underneath her arm. “Your starters will be ready shortly.”
“PTSD.” Mycroft said, eyebrows furrowing.
“Neither would I.”
John frowned.
Maeve looked up at him and yawned.
Mycroft was stunned, he didn’t show it. He kept up his mask of indifference, indifference and power. “My apologies.”
“I will be injecting two vaccines in one thigh and two in the other, I will clean and cover the wounds between.” She informed him, “this will be very distressing for her and most parents want to interfere but we find it better to get this done as quickly as possible so that you can be on your way.”
The next half an hour was focused on John and Sherlock with baby Maeve.
Sherlock glowered but remained silent.
“The wife admitted to killing him. She was the one that called actually, I can play you the recording if you want. But she’s not letting on about what happened. Just that she stabbed her husband to death. Apparently, he hit her around but there’s no evidence to suggest that that’s true.”
He swallowed the rising bile in his throat, head pounding and asked, voice sounding alien even to himself. “Where is she?”
“It started innocence enough, asking me for a drink or coffee. Then, she’d just turn up.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the screen and lent forward, placing his elbows on the table to get as close to the screen as possible without getting up and standing directly in front of it. The movement didn’t go unnoticed by Mycroft or John but everyone remained silent, focused on the screen.
“Do we have any more footage?” Mycroft asked, looking at Anthea.
Maeve whined at the sight of her father walking away from her and Greg bounced her minutely, he told her, “He’ll be back in a minute, sweetheart.”
“A rabbit John, really?” Mycroft asked, a smirk playing on his lips.
“Aww, did you used to make it?”
Anthea took another step closer to the pram and hesitantly reached in. She pulled out the small infant and pulled her close. Maeve’s head lolled and Anthea made sure that she didn’t drop it but instead placed a tired head on her shoulder until she was awake enough to support it herself.
“Yes,” Mycroft rose to his feet and smoothed out the jumper he was wearing. He inhaled deeply a stepped into the hallway, sure to leave the door open after Sherlock stepped through after him. It wouldn’t do to leave Evelyn in a room alone while his parents scolded him in the hallway but he had a plan. Well, a sort of plan.
“It’s Celtic” Sherlock admitted, turning to face John but keeping his eye fixed firmly on the sleeping infant. “For Mythological queen, Irish for joy and Gaelic for
Sherlock’s eyes darted to his daughter.
John stared up at him and then sighed and held out his hand expectantly. “Go on then.”
Mrs Hudson nodded and looked up at the ceiling. Her voice was low as though she was afraid of being heard. “Is he ok??”
“She scratched her boots on the rose bush.” Sherlock sniffed. “There pieces leather on lower branches and suede on the thorns higher up, Isabel Marant boots have a suede trim.”
The pathologist turned around to face him surprised by his sudden arrival though she had been expecting him since the body came in on Sunday. The purple pram separated them, his hands firmly on the handle and soft snores emulating from inside. The hood was pulled over the top of the pram blocking her view of the sleeping baby but she could clearly see the blankets covering the bottom half of the pram but not her legs, she was still tiny.
“Reschedule?” Sherlock asked, hopefully. He hated to admit it but his brother’s help was appreciated and he wanted her to be part of her life.
Siger gestured to the seat and sat when Sherlock nodded. “You don’t need to check up on me, I’m an adult.”
“Mummy.” He muttered.
“You do spoil me,” John said thoughtfully.
“Yes, I love Papa too.” He confirmed.
“Sherlock,” his mother scolded, placing her hands on her hips and raising her eyebrows at him expectantly, “you’re just jealous that she smiled at your brother first, there’s hardly need.”
“And pink!” he muttered in distaste.
“She hasn’t left Sherlock’s arms.” Mycroft assured them.
“You can’t blame her either.”
Sherlock answered, clicking loudspeaker and lent forward on his elbows. “Jim.”
“Do you want me to take her while you eat?” His brother asked, sure to keep his voice low as not to disturb Eve.
Sherlock himself was encouraging his ever-growing daughter to run the stick down the back of the wooden frog. It produced a croaky sound that didn’t exactly fit the rendition of ‘I’m a little teapot’ that the mothers of the group were putting on alongside the clanging of instruments from babies and excited sounds. Maeve was babbling along, her eyes darting around the room and back to Sherlock, checking that he was there and could see her. When the song ended, the instruments continued to play and those mothers with their hands-free began clapping.
Sherlock slipped back into bed. John was still sleeping and Maeve was beginning to settle against his chest, she was full and wind free, nappy changed. He pulled the cover back over his body as he remained sat up against the headboard, cradling the baby against him as she defiantly fought off sleep. Sherlock offered her his hand. She accepted it hastily, small fingers grasping at him tightly as she pulled the hand towards her. He smiled down at her, allowing his daughter to pull his hand against her chest and direct his forefinger towards her small mouth.
The sight was quite becoming. He took a moment to take a picture of the pair, Sherlock would moan about it later but he knew the consulting detective would be thankful. He liked pictures and would want everything he possibly could to do with Maeve documented.
“Goodnight John.” He responded. Maeve chewed on his finger lightly, gums pressing against the digit and drool smeared against her face and his hand.
“And plans for the day?” John asked.
Sherlock paced between the two rows of seat his family occupied. He stepped around the bags and gently rocked Maeve with each step he took. His eyes were fixed on her. She was looking up at him, her eyes dropping with exhausting and her mouth parted in the anticipation of the soft even breathing that sleep brought. Her hands were clutching his shirt, fingers grasping the silk as her eyes finally closed and she allowed her overtired body to fall asleep.
“Yes, to us all, and how is domestic life treating you, brother mine?” Mycroft changed the subject, this was not a matter he wished to dwell on.
“Thank you.” Sherlock told him.
John nodded.
“Like a baby.” John confirmed moving on the spot to rest on his side, mirroring Sherlock and watching the baby between them. She had kicked off the blankets during the night, looking slightly flushed in her pale yellow sleepsuit and the small amount of hair on her head sticking up atop of her head. Her blue eyes flicked to John for a moment before returning to Sherlock.
“Little terror made herself sick laughing,” Sherlock muttered.
“The situation will require immediate action,” He answered with a small nod of his head.
I'd love you to let me know your thoughts in the comment section.
“Good, very good.” The consulting detective nodded as they left the shop.
Siger choked back a laugh, “that’s not exactly how I’ve heard it.”
“What day is it?” Sherlock cracked both of his eyes open.
“How did you?” his brow furrowed, “are you on the case?!
“I haven’t spoken to them.”
“Brilliant” John muttered more to himself than anyone else.
“Leave it in here.”
“Can I help you?” She asked, eyes wide and seeking.
“Mycroft,” he greeted.
“Not impossible?”
“But he always turned up?”
“Yes” Mycroft sighed. “He was always like that, life or death, all in or not at all.”
Sherlock nodded. There were few pictures in the lounge, only one of the two sisters as children, almost identical though he doubted they would be now, social factors would have changed that. One of his homeless network had sent him a picture of her, she bore little resemblance to her sister now.
Silvia jerked at the news and Harold took her hand in his own, his own expression was that of controlled sadness and…anger. She stammered. “Do you mind…where…where was she abandoned? If you don’t mind me asking.”
“The lunch will be ready soon.”
“Yes, and you can be little spoon tonight.”
“No DNA on the body, fingerprints at the scene.” Again, it was a statement and not a question.
Silvia was crying now.
“And you got all that?”
“That’s a lovely name.” Samantha cooed, adding “Is your…wife not coming?”
“You’re plastered over the front cover of every newspaper” Greg exclaimed.
John sighed. That was about all the explanation he would get. He reached out and stroked the cat, his hand running over her side, in response she turned and bit him, hissing. John pulled his hand back quickly, not missing the teeth. “She’s lovely.” He commented.
John with his parents.
“Right.” Lestrade sighed.
“Yes.” Sherlock gave a single sure nod.
Victor snorted and argued, “I wouldn’t phrase it quite like that and Emily was far from perfect, the painting isn’t yet finished so you wouldn’t know but she’s rather normal, I wanted to capture that.”
“Yes.” John nodded and frowned, “you didn’t think I would?”
“It’s a bit nippy outside,” Mrs Hudson told him. “I’d wrap up.”
“I wish to avoid an argument John but you don’t cook.”
“Yes, it’s just-I-” she trailed off unsure.
“Just something from the Yard.” Greg explained, placing the basket on the coffee table. Sherlock didn’t look convinced. “Sally organised it, everyone chipped in, and she wanted to show her support.”
“You didn’t have to,” he said. It was customary.
“And you?” She glanced at him.
“Will you require transportation to Baker Street?” Mycroft asked.
“Sunday.” John returned, it had already been decided that he would attend.
“Cute baby,” a young officer declared as he walked by, pausing and bending down to be on level with the wide eyed child. His eyes flicked up to the D.I and he asked, “Is she yours?”
There was a loud splash followed by Sherlock cursing loudly. John smirked to himself from the kitchen and poked his head into the hallway. “Everything ok?” He asked.
“God.” John muttered, cheeks turning a delightful hue of pink.
“If she gets through them so quick, why are you insisting on buying her designer labels?” He asked.
Sherlock and Mycroft rose from their chairs simultaneously. Sherlock had Maeve attached to him in her papoose, facing his chest as she slept. The younger Holmes’ eyes inspected the woman, flicking over her person critically before settling again on her face with a cold expression. He didn’t say anything, instead he brushed by the woman in a detached manner, his body radiating the same abhorrence that he reserved for people he wanted nothing to do with. Mycroft had seen his brother in this manner before, often he was on the receiving end but it was more often or not reserved people of authority, that wanted to throw their weight around, that he had little respect for.
“Good, it’s been a slow week.” He answered. “I’ve had shifts at the clinic.”
“It is.” John smiled at his friend, he liked this side of him. The caring side. Sherlock continued. “She also hit me, right on the nose.”
“Go away.” Sherlock mumbled and quickly turned onto his side, towards the back of the sofa, brining Maeve with him. She jerked and glanced around the room, but remained calm. A few seconds later she continued to run her hands over his face.
Sherlock was like a small animal. He was frightened at the sound of footsteps and he raised his head, eyes widening and training on his mother and father before softening somewhat and looking back down at his daughter. She was fed and now settling down now. Her face pressed into his neck and hands sprawled over his silk covered chest, fingers clutching the fabric. He was on the sofa with John, reclined against the smaller man with one hand on his daughter’s bottom and the other clutching her tiny head.
Harold nodded and accepted his granddaughter. She squirmed.
There was a ‘yoo-hoo’ followed by the sound of voices and footsteps.
“Countries to run.” Sherlock said to Maeve.
Mycroft was left alone. He sighed, the sound was loud in the almost silent room. The only other sound was the soft breathing from the cot. He swallowed around the lump in his throat and took a step closer to the cot. Inside lay his daughter.
“Yes, but what she wants is-” John was interrupted by Maeve’s scream and breaking into tears. Victor winced. John sighed. “Sherlock.”
Once they were past security and Maeve was fed and asleep, his mother returned from her airside shopping with a new soft toy for Maeve. It was a toy cat, closely resembling Jade.
“The man behind the figure.” Sherlock breathed.
“Quite,” Mycroft interrupted with a polite smile.
Sherlock nodded. He was wrapped up against the brisk night air, dark coat pulled tightly around him and scarf tucked in around his neck. He stood with his leather covered hands on the handlebar of the pram. His dark curls were blowing in the wind. Mycroft was stood beside the pram and his brother, wearing a long coat over his three piece suit. Both sets of eyes flicked to him.
“Yes.” Sherlock answered softly.
“No.” John shook his head, the angry smile on his face highlighted in the purple light. “I do not blame you for what happened today, there is no part of me that blames you. I just want you to trust me.”
“And the last thing she’ll want is to kiss you.” John added.
“Hardly secret,” Sherlock muttered to Maeve.
“I’m always worried,” Siger admitted. “Not necessarily about you taking drugs.”
“When will this night be over?” Sherlock asked, eyes shifting to the ceiling.
“Mycroft called, thought I’d pop in and see how you both were.” He imparted in a soft tone.
“She favours the sweet options,” Sherlock said casting a look at his brother.
“You could come over sometime.” Sherlock suggested, feeling out of his depth. Molly nodded. “To see Maeve, visit.”
“You did well,” Siger said as he settled beside his son.
“He’s thinking,” John explained.
“Having a kid.”
Carol Fowler nodded and her husband, David hooked his arm around her shoulders comfortingly. "The police said that her body was…displayed.”
“This is my usual hour,” Mycroft sniffed and stepped into the flat. He placed the bag on his brother’s chest.
Sherlock ignored the blonde and ducked his head down, he began to pepper the older man’s chest in kisses, soft kisses, too soft, and teasing. The blonde took a shaky breath.
“We’ve been together for 11 weeks,” John added for the sake of correctness. “And I love them both.”
“Say hello to Daddy.” John told her softly, lifting her hand and waving to the consulting detective.
John said a final farewell to Mrs Hudson and followed Sherlock out of the building, a plain black messenger bag filled with baby bits hooked over his shoulder and a smile on his face. “Where are we going?” John asked.
“Our victim’s parents.” Sherlock answered, still holding the toy up for Maeve to enjoy. She was lulling despite the stimulation that Sherlock was providing, eyes struggling to stay open as she reached up drowsily for the bee.
He placed her on the bed and selected a simple baby-grow for the rest of the day, at least she could also sleep in it if she didn’t get messy again. When she was completely dry, moisturised and dress, he set about dressing himself. He pulled on a pair of maroon pyjama bottoms and a top, plain white, inside out of course before picking her up again. Maeve’s hair was beginning to dry. The dark strands were still short but beginning to curl. His own hair was what his brother would call ‘a mop’ - it was wet but beginning to take form into its usual curls, without intervention it would dry in a frizz, messy and without proper definition. He also picked up his hairbrush before moving back into the sitting room.
Maeve yawned against the underside of his jaw, dribble smearing across his skin as rosy lips dragged across his stubbly cheek and she settled back to sleep against him. He had yet to shave today. It was a ‘lazy’ day or more specifically, a dull day, nothing to keep him and Maeve entertained and no cases to work. Not that Lestrade would call him for anything under a seven or even understood the rating system of cases, not with the newspapers so interested in him and his daughter.
“Tesco.”
“Are you busy?” He asked. His eyes scanned over her before settling back on her eyes.
“Right, that’s decided then. Dinner?”
The ex-army doctor placed his pint back on the table completely aware of a table’s worth of eyes watching his every moment, he sat back and crossed his arms loosely over his chest. “We are.”
“She’s been fed and managed another hour or so of sleep.” Siger told him as he got to his feet. “That’s the happiest I’ve seen her all day.”
“Everything ok, John?” Siger asked. He had a frosted glass in his hand with brandy in it.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried not to focus on the insane prattle.
Maeve was half-asleep in John’s lap, her head lolled against his shoulder.
Sherlock frowned. His hand was rather wet from his daughter’s attention. Mycroft plucked a clean muslin from the cupboard and chucked it at John, the blonde caught it and held it out for the consulting detective.
The consulting detective’s eyes flicked to his brother.
“Stop fussing or I swear, I will re-admit myself back into hospital,” Sherlock warned, eyes following his Mother as she cleaned the already pristine room of (what she considered to be) clutter, in this case consisting of: a changing mat and changing bag, clothes, bottles, muslins, soft toys, blankets, a bouncy chair, a maternity pillow and a pile of books. She ignored her son in favour of tidying the room around him; he was laid across the plum chesterfield sofa in the lounge room with his head propped against the arm on a pillow and his feet hanging off the opposite end.
“She just hit herself.” Siger explained. “I think she scared herself.”
Sherlock huffed a breath. “You hardly count John.”
“Hmmm” Mycroft hummed in acknowledgement, not looking up from the file he was currently reading while his PA gazed at the infant; her expression a strange mixture of fascination and curiosity, there was longing in her dark eyes.
Maeve gurgled in response.
“Sherlock” John called out.
Followed by knock at the door captured Sherlock’s attention, his eyes widening and head shooting up in similar fashion to a dog’s when intrigued. It must be urgent for them to have rung to doorbell and knocked. But it was too late for a client. Mycroft would just let himself in and Lestrade would use the key John had given him, to stop him from banging the door down.
“Language John.” The consulting detective scolded.
“Right, and you want to do this here?”
“Mine was in the bedroom.” Sherlock waved vaguely with his left hand.
"Change of plans, my little terror."
“Well, somebody thinks that you could do with a drink, don’t know why.” The grey-haired detective smirked and looked at Sherlock. He held out the other present.
“Me? Squeamish?” He raised an eyebrow.
“And a cake.” His mother told him.
“We are very lucky to have him in our lives.”
“Mrs Hudson brought up some steak sandwiches.”
Siger hovered in the doorway, lent on the wood with his legs crossed elegantly and hands over his chest.
Sherlock returned later, he was ignoring his brother in favour of updating his website and simultaneously searching for any interesting cases in the papers. Mycroft was sat on the ground beside Maeve’s tummy time mat, she was lain on her front with toys ahead of her and stealing glances at her uncle every so often.
“Nothing above a four.”
“I can make a bottle while you move her.” John turned to make the bottle.
Sherlock huffed a breath. “Oh, please, she was the only redeemable member of the family.”
She continued thoughtfully, “you have sensitive skin.”
“And she is exceptional.” Sherlock reminded them. “She’ll smile before her third week.”
“Is that the only noun available to those in this house?” He asked curiously, scooping Maeve up from the carseat and pausing for a moment with her just resting in his arms, still sound asleep.
“Small mercies.”
“I believe I said that I’d ‘impregnated someone’.”
“Yeah,” The DI answered with a smile, “She’s much prettier than a dead body anyway.”
“Does she still have a fever?” Greg asked as he shed his jacket, placing it on the back of a chair and rolling his sleeves up.
“Fine. And you’ll pick up everything else today?”
“Call your mother.” She instructed him with a stern look.
“You are a bloody nuisance.” John grumbled to himself. Sherlock smirked but said nothing. “She asleep?”
“This is the most important gift,” Sherlock told him.
“She was practically throwing herself at you.” Sherlock frowned, disgusted by the idea.
Sherlock nodded. “I…”
Mycroft nodded his head and fingered the handle of his umbrella thoughtfully.
“Quite.” Mycroft agreed and walked towards his niece. He dropped into a crouch in front of her and with a smile, he shifted her position so that she was on her belly on the floor. In this position, she could move easier.
“Apologies for the time, there were matters that needed to be dealt with. The car is waiting.”
He looked down at Maeve.
He sighed again, this time louder and far more dramatic than before.
“That’s hardly in your job description.” Mycroft argued.
“Yes” John answered, “But I know you, you only eat when you need to and sleep even less.”
“You’re brining your daughter?” He sounded shocked.
He moved towards the pool steps looked in. He asked Maeve, “ready?”
Mycroft hummed.
“She’s rather precious, isn’t she?” Mycroft spoke after a moment of holding her, looking down at the pink tiny creature in his arms. She was still, hands clenched into miniature fists against her chest. Both legs were bent and slightly scrunched up against her body. She yawned.
John watched her carefully, she fidgeted. “What?”
“She’s fine.” John nodded. “They didn’t lay a finger on her, just upset.”
Sherlock sipped at the expensive tea that his brother seemed to favour, it had become something of a weekly meeting between the two of them now. Mycroft would summon him to one of his preferred locations, this time they were at the Diogenes club. It was a poor attempt by his brother to stop him from causing a scene. Hopelessly, he put the cup and saucer onto the small table beside him and look at his brother.
“I’ve got to hand it to your brother,” John remarked, turning to face Sherlock, “he knows his suits.”
“Okay.” Greg nodded and his face dropped. “I also got you some cufflinks, they’re in the bedroom in case you don’t want to wear the ring, you know, sentiment and all that.”
“I’ll deal with your mother.”
“Mycroft,” Doctor Green managed a small smile.
“Nothing,” John shrugged. “If you’re seven years old.”
There were dark rings under her eyes but she hadn’t been crying.
The room had fallen silent and all eyes were on him in pure astonishment and shock, as though he had transformed into some kind of beautiful creature as opposed to the monster he usually seemed to be, he suspected it was that they had never seen him show concern for another human being or act quite so human himself. He rolled his eyes and said simply, “I need a bottle.”
“It’s ok.” He attempted to sooth her.
“No, thank you John.”
“Can you take this?” Sherlock asked lifting up the carseat that was still occupied by Maeve.
Sherlock used the back of his free hand to check her temperature, pressing it gently against her forehead. “A little clammy.” He announced and walked over to the desk fan. He sat on the edge of the coffee table, moving Maeve onto his lap and waited until the fan blew cold air over them. Maeve jerked and looked up at him, gurgling. “Shhh.” He hushed gently.
Sherlock stepped away from the wall and closer to the cot. The baby squirmed, eyes flicking up to look at him and he lent down, making it easier for her under-developed eyes to see. Sherlock watched her kick her legs contently, stretching out in uncoordinated jerky movements.
The ex-army doctor was pacing the room in a feeble attempt to calm down a screaming Maeve Holmes. His leg hurt, and with every other step, he limped slightly. His thin white cotton t-shirt was sticking to his clammy skin and Maeve was grasping at the fabric as though she were holding on for dear life. She was red-faced, her skin blotchy from her cheeks to her stomach, and clammy. She wore only a nappy, her skin was hot to touch and she was crying into his ear. Her head resting on his shoulder, tears streaming down her face and wetting his top.
“No?” John perked up. “It is a little early for teeth.”
Maeve yawned loudly and dropped her head to rest on John’s shoulder.
“Have you eaten?” Greg asked, levelling the younger man with a concerned look.
He turned towards the cat.
“She is under the impression that I’ve somehow coerced John into a relationship.” Sherlock informed his elder brother, though he had no doubt that Mycroft was already aware. “She does not approve of our relationship or his parenting my child.”
“Quite.”
“Yes,” he nodded.
“I need to shower.” Sherlock offered in explanation. “And to visit my parents.”
Sherlock shrugged and turned to Mycroft. “Just some things from home.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and stopped in front of him, placing the carseat and bag on the floor. “You are aware that I’d reproduced, yet you seem surprised to me with the result.”
Anthea was on the seat beside him glued to her phone as usual, brown eyes occasionally flicking up to look at her boss or someone enter the room. Gregory was sat opposite with Sally and Anderson, as a concerned family member and member of New Scotland Yard. He managed a comforting smile at his partner. John was stood at the door unable to sit or stop himself from fussing over Maeve in an attempt to keep himself busy.
“What on earth have you done John?” Sherlock demanded as he strolled out of the bedroom wearing nothing but some silk pyjama bottoms despite the October chill. He stopped dead next to the fridge and crossed his arms over his chest. His eyes widened at the sight unfolding in front of him. John was stood on the threshold between the living room and kitchen dressed in some plain jeans and a dark blue jumper with small dots of coloured fabric within the wool. Maeve was sat on his hip having just had her breakfast and been burped wearing, what Sherlock could only describe as a monstrosity.
The priest nodded and continued. Sherlock shifted Maeve higher up his body and craned his neck to place a lingering kiss to the top of her head, she squirmed and attempted to look up at him. He took pity and moved her back down into her original position, so that she had more space to look up, using his chest for support of her small head and still not strong enough neck. Her blue eyes met his and her lips tugged slightly into the beginnings of a smile. Sherlock found himself mirroring the action, threatening to but not quite smiling.
The sound of the door slamming downstairs effectively caught all their attention and moments later, there was Sherlock rushing up the stairs taking them two at a time. He hopped over the stair gate and in one fluid movement crouched beside his daughter. She shuffled towards him a few millimetres.
.” the voice taunted. “
“Don’t you mean someone,” came the snide remark as he flicked through the papers.
“Fine, why wouldn’t I be?” Sherlock asked. He instantly regretted it.
There was a soft tap on the door.
“It wasn’t like that.”
“You leaving?”? John looked up at him.
There was a soft tap on the door. Anthea.
“How is work darling?”
“You look lovely,” Sherlock told her and lent down to place a kiss on his cheek before ducking past and heading upstairs in a fluid movement. He took the steps two at a time and paused in front of the door of John’s old bedroom, where the blonde was currently changing but no longer slept in, it was merely occupied by all of his stuff (not that there was a lot of it). He pushed the ajar door and peaked in.
His mother said nothing. She just hugged him and then moved to Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded. “Her husband was sentenced to death in Florida.”
“I’ll give you a few minutes,” the nurse told him before ducking out of the room leaving Sherlock alone with a screaming baby.
“She doesn’t like to be touched.” Her continued.
“Been reading to her?” John asked gesturing to the book that Sherlock had dropped to rest on his knees.
“I wanted to save you the discomfort.” He admitted, not looking up from Maeve.
“I believe so.”
“What, pray tell, are you going to do with your day?” Mycroft asked, breaking the comfortable silence and looking up long enough turn the page of the case file he was on.
“Sherlock and Maeve.” John clarified with a grin.
“I need to see her” He croaked, coughing violently.
Maeve’s brows raised slightly and he bent down to kiss the remaining creases.
“You’re recovering” his father reminded him as though he needed reminding of that fact.
“I’m just trying to help.” The consulting detective said petulantly, clapping his hands together.
"I'll just take these out then" John told him, he pulled over a small leather stool and a table lain with the required instruments,
