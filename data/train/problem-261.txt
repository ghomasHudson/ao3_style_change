“My brother and I went years without speaking. Different reasons, of course. I was purposely evading him. But my point is, no matter how bad it is or ever was between you two, it can always get better. But someone has to make that first move. And . . . even if nothing happens, it will be worth the effort."
He could see Sherlock trying to catch his eye again, wondering what was wrong as John’s face flushed pale.
The tall, metal gate was already opened for them, granting access to the cleared path to the front steps.
Christine. Who was Christine? John thought about calling Sherlock, but the door the ‘S’ passed over caught his attention. He opened it, ignoring the horrendous creak of unoiled hinges, and entered.
They had expected the killer had continued to run, but instead, he was lurking in the dark waiting for him. He shoved John up against the wall. Before he could fight back, he grabbed a fistful of his hair and smashed it into the brick.
The only sounds in the dark room came from the soft kisses Sherlock was placing down his neck. All over his bruises, and brushing over his cut. John ran his hands up his bare back, thankful he hadn’t put his shirt back on after being bandaged.
“I mean, who could blame you, honestly. I really am quite charming, as you so kindly stated in your blog entry about said evening,” he said smugly.
The cases they went on were spectacular as well. Or maybe it just seemed that way to John since everything was spectacular now that he was with Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at him. For the first time, he realized his friend appeared to have aged significantly since Mary’s identity was revealed. The creases in his forehead ran a little deeper, his eye bags hung a bit lower, he seemed exhausted.
“Right, yes. Actually I’ve got to um… sorry,” he stumbled and turned to go back up to the flat. He had to apologize to Sherlock immediately. God, he was awful to him.
“And we sort of work together, yeah.” He felt Sherlock glance at him, and with a twist in his gut he remembered that he no longer assisted Sherlock with his work at all. So what were they?
Above him, Sherlock awkwardly cleared his his throat. Molly and Greg turned their attention to him, and John turned his head in his lap to see him properly.
He was astounded at the vulnerability he saw in his eyes. The weakness, the panic, the desperation. Sherlock continued to rub his arms and back vigorously to circulate his blood flow.
John couldn’t reply just yet. Of all the things he thought Sherlock was keeping from him, he never thought that was anywhere in the realm of possibilities. He had accepted long ago that his feelings would forever be unrequited and had stopped trying figure out Sherlock’s romantic and sexual orientation. But this… it was a good thing Sherlock was repeating it over and over again into his palms or he would have thought he hallucinated it.
They crashed inside, and Sherlock immediately crowded him up against the nearest wall. Not as a means of control and dominance, but as if he was afraid he'd leave if he didn’t hold him in place.
The last thing he heard before slipping into unconsciousness was a bullet clicking into its chamber.
“I’m so sorry. I knew they were burnt. I meant to clean it up, but didn’t have time before you boys showed up.”
Then something caught his eye. He lit the wall across from him to reveal several deep scratches. He stepped back to give the light a larger circumference.
He closed his mouth and relaxed his posture. Sherlock fully entered and removed his shoes, smiling at him. John noticed he was also carrying several boxes. There was no mistaking the smell of Thai food that instantly filled the room.
Now, in their first moment of complete calmness since taking the case, he sized him up for remaining injuries.
Starred as important was an email from a mysterious looking account with only symbols as the address. He opened it and clicked on the attachment at the bottom.
This chapter got ridiculously long, so my beta rightly advised me to split it in two. So stay tuned for the rest of their third night in the Walters house :)
She sighed in momentary relief. Her bullet-proof vest was still safely tucked under her bulky sweaters, along with her ski mask. She fleetingly wondered if perhaps she should start wearing it under her clothes, just in case.
It took a moment for him to notice the light weight on top of him. Glancing down, he found a mess of soft, blonde curls nestled comfortably on his chest. A slight grin tugged at his lips. For a moment, he could pretend this was the Mary he married. The one who’s spicy humor made him laugh at the most unexpected times. The one who gave him head massages when he was sick. The sweet, spunky woman he had loved.
“Precisely.” The corners of Sherlock’s lips twitched upwards in that unsettling way when someone caught his interest. The fear John had seen earlier was gone. In its place was a drive - a set determination to solve this.
He clenched his fist as a bead of cold sweat trickled down the back of his neck.  He could feel adrenaline flooding through his body. The memory caused his heart rate to rise alarmingly. He took a deep breath, calming himself down.
So then what was that day in the kitchen all about? What were all the lingering stares? Why hadn’t they been able to maintain their close friendship after John got back with Mary?
Sherlock was absolutely trying to initiate one of those nights. But this time, after everything they’d been through, there would be a different mood hanging in the air, and they both knew it.
“Come on, Sherlock. I grew up just like everyone else. I pictured my wedding day. I wondered what it would be like to have kids. These are just normal thoughts people have. But I don’t
John turned to fully face Sherlock for the first time since they arrived home last night at nearly 4 a.m. They had instantly kicked their shoes off and crashed into Sherlock’s bed – fully clothed and too exhausted to even say goodnight. When daylight filtered through the window and woke them a few hours later, they had immediately called Josephine, wanting to close this case as soon as possible.
Sherlock gasped and sighed into his mouth as he worked his spit slicked hole open. John kissed his eyes and nose lovingly before returning to his mouth, mumbling, “God, I love you so much.”
“Sherlock.” He didn’t move. He didn’t blink. He didn’t even twitch. John was unsure as to whether or not he was even breathing.
“So, er, any news on the case?” John asked as casually as he could the next morning. Sherlock was bustling around the kitchen while he was drinking his morning tea in the doorway.
He managed to slit his eyes open once again. His vision was blurry, but came into focus for a moment. Sherlock still held him in his shaking hands, tears streaking down his face. His bottom lip trembled as he struggled to form words.
“I think I’m due for a brush up on my skills. It’s been awhile.” Sherlock’s guarded face melted into a beautiful smile that filled John’s heart.
He was overwhelmed with pride in Sherlock for renouncing his plans for vengeance, but also terrified for him. He waited for the men to react, presumably with rage and violence. However, all he heard was a very calm, "Alright, then," as chairs scooted back and everyone stood to leave. He tucked himself into the dark corner as much as possible to avoid being seen as Jackson and Bolt exited the room. Sherlock and Victor followed. Before parting ways, he observed them exchanging a very knowing look. Victor’s expression stone-faced and frustrated, Sherlock's calm and challenging.
“No, Sherlock! Just let me - I need to-” He took a deep, steadying breath and gripped Sherlock’s face tighter. He couldn’t even put into words how badly he needed to explain everything to him. All of it. No more hiding. If he didn’t do it now, it would eat away at his sanity forever.
“But don’t worry. I won’t kill you just yet.” With that, he pulled his arm back and thrust a punch deep into John’s gut, knocking the breath clean out of him. Before he could regain his breath, another punch landed in the same spot. And then a third one on his jaw, causing a sickening crack.
Just as Sherlock was going to ask for his social security number, John and Lestrade burst in the door.
Sherlock stood perched onto the edge of the well, and jumped in, his descent guided by several strong armed officers.
“It’s entirely possible to deal with someone or something as a part of your job without personally knowing much about them,” Holmes said. “Being an arms dealer, you should know this, considering your last business partner sold you parts you failed to recognize as fake.”
“Good, good… Today you’ll be training and working with our gunner. Mopping seemed ill-fitted for you, and I think it’s best that someone keeps an eye on you while you’re up here. Since you can’t stay out of trouble on your own. MOLLY!” he bellowed.
The one where he had whispered those forbidden words against Sherlock’s chest in a moment of weakness, not knowing or caring if he could hear him.
Minor scratches were scattered about Sherlock’s face and arms. He had showered and changed into a shirt and dress pants, but still appeared drained. Splinters covered his hands, which thankfully now had their color restored.
First, a huuuge thank you to my beta, Sandy @yorkiepug, who has helped me with this fic even when it was just a nugget of an idea. Thank you for supporting me!!
“Then I expect to see you here at 8 a.m. tomorrow, sharp. It better be the best day’s work I’ve ever seen from you, understand? One more customer complaint like that, and you’re out.”
He leapt out of bed and grabbed his robe. That’s it. Whether he had imagined it or not, he wasn’t going to get any sleep like this. More annoyed with the night’s happenings than scared, he trudged downstairs and straight to the master bedroom.
He turned Sherlock's face towards him and lightly kissed his tears away on both cheeks. He pressed their foreheads together and tried to find his voice. He so longed to tell him how sorry he was for his tragic past. How much of a jerk he felt like for assuming he had selfish motives for his actions. How much he regrets calling him a machine and how much he wishes he could swallow those words back up and replace them with love and kindness. How unaware he was of Sherlock's past and how sorry he was for every misinformed thought he had about him. How much he wishes he could erase his pain and fill him up with love, security, and the warmth of companionship.
Tony pressed the rod into his right pec. Agony burst from the spot as his skin was brutally scorched. The ruthless heat ignited his body, filling him up. His scream caught in his throat, threatening to tear his body in half, but he refused to release it. The stench of his own burning flesh filled his nostrils, and for a moment, he thought he was going to black out.
He didn’t need to be told twice. He laid down and tried to relax as Sherlock stroked gently through his hair.
Inside were dozens of photographs he had made prints of from his phone solely so he could delete them from his camera roll and put them away forever.
Suddenly, he was painfully reminded of a similar moment with Janine. The two of them were sitting cross-legged by the water, sharing a cigarette and enjoying a single moment of peace in their chaotic lives.
John shook the man once in his arms, knowing he couldn’t do much else to hurt him without getting everyone shot.
John and Sherlock reached their table on the far side of the hall and sat down. No one else was there at the moment, although there were jackets around the backs of a few chairs and some unfolded napkins. They wouldn’t be dining alone.
"What would you like me to make him say next,” she heard distantly. Oh, he was cute. When she saw him run up and grab Jim, she felt undeniably attracted to him. The devotion and loyalty he had for this man Sherlock Holmes, it was heartwarming. It was really too bad she might have to kill them. But he would always remain a fond memory of hers.
Molly shrugged. “Sherlock has his reasons. We just follow orders.” John huffed angrily and stormed up to Sherlock.
John wasn’t sure whether to laugh at the imitation or punch the man for his accuracy. Regardless, Sherlock was clearly enjoying the dumbfounded look on his face. John decided he’d rather punch the self-satisfied smile off of his.
Hang on, he thought. Why didn’t Sherlock invite him along now that he was back? It wasn’t that he didn’t want to wake him. Sherlock had woken him for cases at god awful hours of the night before without a second thought.
She broke into his office, but horribly misjudged the timing. Sherlock showed up and offered to help her. She nearly laughed. Did he even know much shit she’d pulled herself through all these years? What did he think he could offer her that she couldn’t do for herself?
Sherlock tip-toed inside, listening carefully for any signs of life, but there were none. Not even a single passed-out junkie laying slumped against the wall.
“I was going to take you to the park. We were going to find a nice spot, covered by some trees and watch the sunset.” Sherlock opened and closed his mouth, unsure of what to say to comfort him.
He made his way to brush past Sherlock and walk out the door, keeping his head down, unable to look him in the eye. But Sherlock’s arm darted out and closed the door, stopping him from proceeding.
“Something didn’t make sense, something wasn’t clicking, I didn’t realize…” he was muttering under his breath, sounding more and more like he belonged in a psychiatric ward.
And it would be heartless to wake him, he figured. So John closed his eyes and allowed his hand to rest on Sherlock’s forearm on his waist. He turned his face towards his friend’s and drifted back to sleep with a content smile lingering on his lips.
He stormed past the table and settled into his chair instead. Sherlock hadn’t even sent a text that he would be gone, John thought disappointedly. Perhaps their relationship was more broken than he realized.
“I’m saying, now we’ll never know for sure, if some nitwit performed the autopsy and the files are nowhere to be found.” He paused slightly as an idea formed. “Where is he?”
“Yes, I’m fine,” he said, and tried removing it again before Sherlock gripped his wrists and stopped him.
There was a fine layer of dust on top of every surface in his room. No one had cleaned it. Everything appeared to have gone completely untouched in the months he was away. Except the bed, he noticed.  The sheets were clean and slightly ruffled, as if recently slept in.
He came to her one day when she was in her mid-30s. He told her he was looking for a faithful companion with her skillset. He promised her comfortable living, excitement, companionship. She’d never have to worry about anything again. As someone who grew up with nothing and no one, it sounded wonderful. She accepted.
John laid back down. “I was in the military, mate. I can go for longer than you think without food. If that’s all you’ve got, we’ll be here awhile.”
By morning the news that John was now part of the crew had somehow already traveled. When John met Molly up on deck at their usual spot, she practically tackled him in a hug. “You’re staying?! John, that’s wonderful! Oh, I’m so happy!” A hand clamped on his shoulder and Molly released her death grip on his torso. John turned so see Greg smiling down at him.
He tossed the invitation on the table in annoyance. One case, he told himself. He would go on this one case, behave himself, and then explain to Sherlock that he couldn’t work with him anymore.
The significance of choosing Angelo’s was not lost on either of them: this was where their story began. John would never forget the energy that radiated between them that night. It was unlike anything he’d ever experienced with anyone.
He shook out his nerves and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He crouched over Eli’s dead body and fished in his pockets for any loose cash he could take with him. With one last look at the blood-stained kitchen and corpse on the ground, he left the flat, never to return.
He remembered Mary’s threat to kill him and the warm serenity in his chest diminished quickly. He swallowed tightly and rubbed his forehead. Sherlock could tell he was distressed, and pulled the blankets up to his chest for him.
“Oh, don’t give me that. You know exactly what I’m talking about. Why would you not ask me to come along?” Sherlock stood with a gaping mouth, but didn’t interrupt. “You’ve never left me out of a case before. You know I would’ve wanted to help.”
“And…” Sherlock took his hat off and held it tightly, almost like a security blanket. “I soon realized that you really did know nothing. And that the drugs for some reason enhanced your nightmares. You were screaming and thrashing and… John, I’m so sorry.”
John laid on his side in the bed, listening in silence as Sherlock told him everything. He told him about Janine, his best friend while he was working for Evans. He talked about their memories, the way she laughed and smiled, the way she was able to make people laugh even in those dark times. He told him about the night she tried to run away, pregnant with her and her boyfriend’s baby. About how Evans threatened to hurt her, and Sherlock interfered. How Evans shot her in cold blood and made Sherlock and Irene clean out her possessions and dispose of the body. How he was never the same after that. How the look on her face as she dropped to her knees still haunts him.
Thank you all for reading and for your lovely comments! I hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed working on it :)
His feet were chained solid to the bottom. Even if Sherlock were to get here in time, there was no telling how he’d be able to get him out.
The temperature suddenly dropped in the room. A cool draught rushed past him, raising goosebumps on all his exposed flesh. Then came another gust of cold air on the back of his neck. Cold air? Or . . . breath?
They’d never been to Angelo’s in the daytime before. The restaurant was brightly lit with afternoon daylight instead of dim street lights and candles.
The thought cut deep in his gut. Now that he knew the feeling of Sherlock’s lips on his own, the feeling of his hands and mouth on his body, he couldn’t forget it.
John grabbed his face and pulled him down for a rough, hungry kiss. One and two more thrusts, and Sherlock was coming inside him with a loud, strangled cry. He reached down and fisted John’s cock, one, two, three times and finished him off as well.
“I said those things. . . I didn’t mean. . . oh gosh,” John said, struggling to find the words. He calmed himself with a few deep breaths. “I said those things because I never thought it would be something you’d want."
This intrigued John. What were they talking about that needed to be so secret, and away from everyone else? And why did it bother Victor so much when John just barely noticed them? He tried to keep to his work the rest of the day, ignoring the three of them. Regardless of his efforts, he couldn't help but notice how strange they were acting, even hours later. He told himself to stop being paranoid and drop it. With this, he tuned back into Molly, who was still talking to him.
“Sherlock will be bringing the tea in a second.” he said. After a few, long minutes, Sherlock served them tea and relaxed back in his chair. He proceeded to discuss the case calmly, while John kept his reddened, scalding hot face down, not saying a word the rest of the time.
Sherlock stopped and turned, merely out of confusion. A young woman with panicked eyes and a mess of blond curls ran up to him.
“Don’t think you can fucking ditch me that easily, Holmes,” he said lightly, just between them. They shared a warm smile before a horrendous creak snapped their gazes to the front yard.
John’s heart swelled at the sight. He looked precious. Almost child-like. As he slowly reached out to push that stray curl out of eyes, a nurse entered the room.
“I love you.” It was barely there. The faintest whisper that slipped past those plush lips. But there was no mistaking those three words.
He reached the end of the hallway where he had to make a decision. Down the left side there were lights on under two closed doors and one open one. On the right side there was light under one closed door. Ray likely would have wanted them to be as isolated as possible.
Sherlock practically growled at the touch and raked his teeth hard over his windpipe. John gasped at the sudden roughness and lifted Sherlock’s face from his neck to show him he could return it. He kissed him again, all teeth and lips and tongue. Nothing like the warm tenderness from the hallway.
“I have a theory of my own that I’m gonna share, okay?” No response. John was thankful he at least wasn’t shutting him down. “I think Gina used the Ouija board to contact some kind of spirit.”
Sherlock looked into his eyes as if waiting for him to say more. When he realized that’s all he was getting, he cocked an eyebrow in question.
John’s shouts were again muffled by the hand pressing onto him. His kicking and thrashing got him nowhere. Whatever this force was was stronger than any human he had encountered.
He broke out into a dead sprint towards the door. Pulling out his gun, he burst inside without waiting.
Sherlock began kicking at the door with all his might as John searched for something to break it down with.
“Oi, Sherlock. Hold on.” Sherlock slowed to allow him to match his step on the sidewalk. “What the hell was that?”
“Talk to me,” he pleaded. All he got was Sherlock clenching his eyes shut harder and hiccupping softly. John patiently brushed the tears off his cheeks with the pads of his thumbs.
John gazed intently at the man in front of him. He was fumbling with his hat in front of him and looking between him and the floor like a child who had been told by his mother to apologize. Yet, he seemed entirely, one hundred percent sincere. John’s heart went out to him. Before, his fondness of Sherlock had been more of an intriguing infatuation. A physical attraction with a bit of objective curiosity. But now, after what Molly had told him about his past and after seeing this side to him- this trembling, insecure, almost childlike human side- he felt something deeper stir inside him. Much deeper.
He burrowed back into the sheets, wanting to hide from the world. How the hell was he going to explain this? Might as well get it over with. Shaking his head, he allowed himself to indulge in a few more minutes of inhaling the sweet, Sherlock-scented sheets before he pulled himself out of bed, stretched painfully, and made his way to the kitchen.
“Oh, no dear. We wanted to do something special for your first morning back. I offered to do it for him, but you know how he is - so stubborn.” She chuckled fondly. “He insisted on doing it all by himself. Took quite a few tries, might I add.” She dropped her voice to a whisper as if sharing a dirty secret. “He’s really not the best with baking.”
At some point in the journey, John walked ahead of him, seemingly a little affronted. Sherlock didn’t blame him. He remained behind and let John get far ahead of him, watching the slight stomp in his step and frustrated hunch of his shoulders. When they reached home, John turned into the alley first. As soon as he disappeared into it, Sherlock heard an unexpected thud and a light grunt.
Together they swayed and enjoyed the music, the calmness and and serenity of it, the perfect pacing.
Even in the dark, Sherlock’s eye roll wasn’t missed, although it failed to carry any real annoyance. He lifted his arm without separating his steepled fingers and allowed John to settle in against his side before dropping his elbow back down.
He returned his glowering gaze to Ray. “Consider yourself lucky they want you alive for questioning.” His voice rumbled low and dangerous. “Otherwise I’d blow your brains out right this second.” Ray swallowed tightly, his eyes wide in fear and fixed on the gun aimed at his forehead. He opened his mouth to reply but John cut him off.
“You know, the… thing. Back on the tarmac.” John swallowed. Even months later it still pained him to think about the time he almost lost Sherlock forever – again. Except that time, he still would’ve been alive. Just unreachable. Which almost made it worse.
John laughed warmly. “You didn’t seem to think so when you were pretending to be Westley saving the day.”
Sherlock’s eyes twinkled softly in understanding. He then hiked his jumper and t-shirt up and gently guided it over his head before chucking it aside. His eyes roamed his tan, muscled torso, lingering specifically on his two bullet wounds.
“Did I really do that?” he mumbled softly, but his reddening cheeks implied that he most certainly knew exactly what he was referring to.
And the baby. She was almost seven months pregnant. If she had to flee at any point, what would she do with her child?
A familiar silhouette stood in front of him. His panicking ceased, but full body tremors still ripped through his body.
They kissed breathlessly for what seemed like an eternity. Their shared breaths mingled hotly between their lips. They pulled soft, needy sounds out of each other that resonated into their otherwise silent living room.
“Sherlock here has been following my trail of bread crumbs for the past several years. And they’ve lead him right into my arms, just as I want.”
“But anyway,” Molly said, cheering herself up. They chatted mindlessly until night fell and John returned to the brig.

John was confused for a moment before remembering that a moment ago, he was practically drooling at the man with his jaw on the ground.
When they broke apart to breathe several minutes later, John looked up at Sherlock. His hair was mussed up and his pale face flushed. His pupils were blown wide and staring intensely down into John's eyes. The intensity and hunger in his expression filled John's stomach with wooziness and made his head spin.
Once his hands were down by his hips, they slowly swept back up again. He brushed his thumbs over his nipples, and John let his head fall back.
John figured it was about four in the morning. Sherlock wasn’t supposed to have fallen asleep here, but it was too early to get up. And John didn’t have the heart to wake him and tell him to go back to his own bed. Not when he looked this serene and lovely sleeping next to him.
“It really doesn’t seem like that long ago,” he said quietly, looking around as if another scene were playing in his mind’s eye. John smiled softly at him. “But at the same time it feels like an entirely different lifetime.”
However, it was the first time since the party last week that they would be spending this much time together, so it never hurt to prepare.
“Yes, yes, I have it,” Molly said. “Can you not talk so loud please?” She took out a bag with four preserved human feet. Left ones, as Sherlock had requested.
Now that John was chained to a well and almost drowning, he found he hated himself for waiting too long. No, he would not lose John when they were this close to happiness. He would simply not allow it.
Sherlock’s eyes told him he was thinking the same thing.  And that he also remembered the soft touches from last night, when they lay pressed together head to toe.
She suspected William knew something was wrong with that house, and had believed her all those years ago. By not leaving it to her in his will, he was protecting her. Keeping her away from it and all its mystery.
Next to him, Sherlock remained still as a statue as Julia leaned in and began whispering in his ear. John’s vision went red, but focused his attention in on Stacey.
He smiled at Greg and Molly’s little squabble over his hairdo as Molly dragged her fingers fondly through the graying hair, slightly longer than usual. “I think he’s a handsome stud either way,” John responded with an over exaggerated wink.  Greg chuckled as Molly teased, “Well I think it’s safe to say he’s on my side. We all know John prefers longer hair. Particularly dark, ravenous, curly hair, black as midnight, lush as-“
John ran a hand through his sleep-tousled hair contemplating the fact that he had dropped everything and fled a case simply because he hadn’t answered a call.
So it came as a surprise when he felt a dip in the bed next to him and a large hand carding through his hair.
John rose and was led by Greg up two flights of stairs to the deck. Looking around, he realized how beautiful and majestic this ship actually was: the golden brown floor boards, the proud, white sails flapping wildly in the wind, the tropical scent of the sea right under his nose. He must have missed it in all the craziness from yesterday.
"I knew it. He's changed you, Sherlock. Whether you want to admit it or not. You've got a soft spot for him, and we won't stand for it."
The woman looked carefully between the two of them. Her firm expression melted into one of warmth and hospitality.
Two hours later, the cab pulled up to the Walters’ house. ‘Mansion’ was a bit of an overstatement, John thought. It was large, but not overwhelmingly so.
John couldn’t help but chuckle as he watched two massive policemen leap out of the way for the tiny woman.
“But Christine lived to adulthood and had Josephine. It was Gina’s second child that mysteriously went missing.”
This time it was John who cradled Sherlock’s head to his body and rested his head atop the damp curls. And Sherlock who privately whispered the no longer forbidden words into his skin:
“Bag. Here, you take some.” John removed two packets from his handbag and stuffed them into Sherlock’s coat.
Sherlock didn’t move as John aggressively brushed past him, the breeze making him sway slightly on the spot. His eyes were definitely wet.
“He’s done it before, I know. Die for you. And this is how you repay him. Heartlessly torturing him. Leading him on and then pulling away at the last moment.” Her exact imitation of Sherlock’s phrasing chilled him to the bone. “Late nights up together, sharing a bed, dinners, dancing. You two are quite the pair. Too bad none of it mattered.”
John rolled his eyes but glanced down at himself anyway. Sure enough, the bulging tent in his pants was way more visible than he thought it would be. He briefly felt embarrassed for Mrs. Hudson's sake.
Several days passed and no one came for Sherlock. Until one day, Jackson came down to the brig with a different order to carry out. Sherlock rose from his spot to follow him up, but was stopped.
His head surfaced and he breathed in a lungful of air with gratitude. The fire in his chest calmed as he caught his breath, never more thankful for air in his life.
Forcing his eyes further open, he blinked several times to focus his vision. He was in the brig. He recognized it from his first few days here as prisoner. He attempted to sit up, but every muscle in his body tightened in protest. As he let out a groan of pain, a hand gently coaxed him to lay back down. It was then that he realized he had been laying with his head in Sherlock’s lap for who knows how long.
Sherlock’s eyes glistened with the early formation of tears as he continued. “Would you have cried, John? Would you have missed me at all?”
John’s thrusts grew faster and needier. Sherlock’s moans grew louder and higher. They climaxed at the same time, pulling each other in for a searingly hot kiss. They caught their breath, pecking their lips together lazily.
“What’s going on here is far too complex for your tiny, little brain to comprehend, I’m sure, Johnny-boy. So just step aside and let daddy finish his business here. I promise I’ll reward you very nicely later if you’re a good boy.”
“All night and then some. It’s about ten in the morning now. This one here refused to leave your bedside for a moment. We had to pry him away from you to check on his head when you were rolled into the emergency room, but after-”
John’s eyes flew open in hurt. Without responding, he fled out the living room, up the steps, and into his bedroom. He slammed the door shut and leaned against it, panting and grasping at his heaving chest.
As if on cue, the entire house shook again with a deep growl. The lights sparked and two picture frames fell from the wall.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” She hated how weak her voice sounded, wet with tears and worn down with emotion.
He nearly leapt across the living room and fished his phone out of the cushions of his chair. He pressed ‘1’ on speed dial and waited impatiently.
One moment, Sherlock's eyes were fluttering closed as he decidedly gave in. The next, they were jumping apart at the deafening crash behind them.
The soft morning light teased John’s eyelids open. One arm was tucked behind his head, and the other gently clutched the sheets over his torso.
John’s stomach fluttered, what with Sherlock’s sparkling blue eyes looking at him like that, and the weight of his hand settled on his waist.
John scowled in budding anger. “You wanna ease up a bit?” he said, trying to keep his voice at a low volume. “I’ve been here less than a day.”
“Don’t move. Just rest,” said the familiar baritone voice, as the hand gently stroked through his hair.
John mostly kept to his work the rest of the day. But that did not stop him from noticing the stocky, brown-haired man talking to the two thugs from yesterday. Nor did he fail to notice their collective scornful glares and whispers. With this, he thought it best to steer clear from anyone else for a while.
Silence followed as he trailed off. Sherlock stood facing John with his hands folding uncomfortably in front of him. After several moments, he picked up the conversation again.
“Oh my god,” John breathed. It was small. A child’s skeleton. No older than five. “Do you think it’s-”
ahhh sorry that took so long!! Hopefully my updates will be a bit more regular from now on, but can't make promises :)
Sherlock lowered his mouth to the base of his cock and kissed it, giving it a firm, experimental stroke. When John moaned and arched in response, his eyes flicked up to meet his.
“John, move!!” He couldn’t. He was frozen. The chandelier gained momentum as the ‘N’ was etched into the ceiling, right before-
Sherlock moved without hesitation and allowed John to climb in behind him, the movement natural from having done it countless times before.
“Can you remember where they are now?” John could feel Victor’s breath on the side of his face as he spoke, and his voice vibrating in his chest against his back. As much as he tried to keep his head up, he couldn’t stop it from rolling back against Victor’s shoulder as the blade suddenly pressed harder into his skin.
John thrashed on the bed, gasping for breath and trying not to hurt himself. He was already so close - between the warmth surrounding his cock, the wetness of his tongue, and seeing Sherlock down between his legs, his cheekbones hollowed out from sucking
He stilled, waiting for Sherlock to close that last bit of space between them. He convinced himself it was out of courtesy, and not cowardice.
John knew it. Uncovering Mary’s history, the forgiveness, the miscarriage. Sherlock was by his side through the whole thing. Never once wavering.
“You know, Sherlock. You could have told me you were banned from every supermarket in London,” John said as he and Sherlock strode out of the parking lot after being thrown out by the backs of their shirt collars.
“Sherlock,” he started again. “Maybe there’s another way we need to look at this.” When he received no response he continued. “Whenever this thing messes with us, it’s always been-”
At her feet, Sherlock’s breath hitched at the reminders of all the cruel, heartless things he had done over the past several weeks. John wanted nothing more than to rush forward and take his face in his hands. To brush away the soft tears that were no doubt there, to tell him how much he was loved, and how badly he’d wanted to tell him all this time.
Sherlock drew in a shaky breath. John's hand had been covering his mouth throughout the tale, too horrified to speak or even breathe. Two tears slowly trickled down Sherlock's nose and fell into his hands. Unable to find his voice, John reached out and touched the other man's hand, letting him know he could continue at his own pace, or stop entirely if wished.
He nodded stiffly. And that was it. They stared forward in silence watching the credits continue to roll on the screen. A moment or so later, John piped up again with another confession.
Soothing, classic 80’s music was playing. Men and women were swaying hand in hand in perfect synchronization. Colorful dresses twirled around numerous pairs of legs.
“You can call yourself a sociopath all you want. You can pretend you’re heartless and immune to emotions and have no conscious. But at the end of the day, I know you better than anyone, and I know that’s not who you are.  You’re my best friend.”
All his pent up emotion spilled until his eyes had dried out. He cried for Mary being the cause of all this, he cried for the dance he and Sherlock didn’t finish, he cried for almost losing Sherlock yet again, and he cried for the cold, ruthless  words that had torn him apart downstairs.
John gasped and turned around, hiding the single tear that slid down his cheek from Sherlock’s view. Sherlock didn’t mean that. He couldn’t.
He sighed and slid his hands down to grip the sides of his open shirt. “Look, Sherlock. I’d rather not-”
He didn’t go to sleep. No, he stayed up chastising himself for his careless behavior. He had allowed himself to get a little too comfortable, spent just a little too much time giggling with Sherlock, and before he knew it, had lost all sight of his intention to remain distant.
John tilted his head back, allowing him further access. He kissed down his neck another inch or two and latched his mouth onto the skin, humming around it as he continued his ministrations.
He hauled his two stuffed duffel bags up the stairs with great difficulty. He could hear Sherlock screeching away at his violin on the other side of the door. This wasn’t one of his usual soft, sweet melodies. This was sporadic and quick. John could tell he was thinking very hard through something.
“You know what I’m referring to.” Sherlock trailed the backs of his long, pale fingers along the bruises on his throat. John subtly shifted away from the touch. He really wished he wouldn’t touch him like that anymore if he didn’t share his intentions.
The year they spent dating was wonderful. She genuinely liked John Watson. Maybe even loved him. And as more and more time passed with no contact from Jim Moriarty, she grew think maybe he really was dead.
Tony made room as Victor calmly came up and looked him over thoughtfully. Then, he grabbed two handfuls of his shirt and tore it apart in one swift movement.
Going on cases with Sherlock again was the last thing he needed if he was to distance himself from him. Even after the tantrum he had thrown yesterday, he still couldn’t allow himself to accept.
It appeared they had just won a game or something, going by the celebratory drinks going around. Front and center of the group was what appeared to be the captain. He clapped his mates on the back and took a swig of his drink.
When John woke up, the first thing he noticed was the emptiness that still remained in his chest and belly. Part of it was because he was hungry, he rationalized. But as the dreaded memories of the previous night came back to him, he couldn’t deny the primary source of the pain.
“That’s why he throws these extravagant parties every year. In the first one, he observes his people. Listens in on their conversations, sends other confidants to see if they can get each other to spill, evaluates how trustworthy they really are. He decides who is valuable enough to stick around for him another year and who must go. He chooses one person every year who doesn’t make the cut. And he murders them.”
Chills prickled along his arms as his music morphed into a minor key. But soon, a pair of arms wrapped around his middle and a body pressed against his back. John’s warmth served as a reminded that he didn’t need to think of any of those dreadful things. Because he wasn’t overdosing in a gutter somewhere. He was warm and comfortable in his home. The home he shared with the one he loved.
“I gave you so many chances. Allowed you so many slip-ups. But you just never learn. There’s only so many chances I can give before I have to step in. You clearly can’t handle living with him and controlling yourself, can you? Always a slave to your primitive instincts.”
Putting together the facts, he gave his current theory: Gina’s missing child was simply one of the many, and her suicide could possibly have been related to grief. Josephine’s memories could have been the result of dormant schizophrenia being triggered by something.
“Yeah, well, you could’ve done without calling the manager stupid just now, and telling him his wife was cheating on him with four different people.”
Sherlock removed his arms from the counter and stepped back only slightly. John still had to push past him to make his way back to the living room empty handed.
He asked him about what cases he had tackled in his absence and listened to him retell his adventures with glee. There were several, he noticed with a slight pang. He had missed out on much more of Sherlock’s life than he realized.
Sorry again I took so long to update! I'll try to be more regular, but can't make promises :/ I'm starting college in a week so might be busy. All the same, I'll try my best to keep up with this until it's done!
“Moriarty and I have a job to do,” she stated simply. “So I would advise you and Sherlock to not get too . . .
She hadn’t exactly been his faithful servant while he was away. Not that it was entirely her fault. How could she have notified him of Sherlock’s return if she thought he was dead?
“Oh, and John?” She nearly whispered as he began to straighten back up. The smile was still plastered on her face, but the light in her eyes was replaced with a cold blankness. “Don’t take too long.”
“It was.” They smiled warmly at each other, remembering that this was the case that eventually pulled them together. All those parties, the dinners, the dancing . . .
“Nothing. It’s just . . . you with children?” He could just barely see Sherlock rolling his eyes in the dark.
Sherlock quickly unfastened his belt and pulled it loose. He unbuttoned him and pulled his zip down, wriggling his trousers and pants off his hips. They couldn’t get off fast enough for him. Once off, they were cast aside carelessly, and Sherlock lowered down between his legs once again.
His eyes traced down the line of her arm, where he found his phone in her palm, her thumb lazily scrolling.
Sherlock was looking just past his head, his eyes glazed over like his mind was on another planet. He wanted to lean forward and rub those forehead creases out with his thumbs, and tell him to just be here in this moment with him.
One half level up at the bow, Sherlock sprinted to one edge of the ship and bent over the edge, leaning so far overboard he would fall if moving an inch forward.  He sprinted back and forth between sides bending over as far as possible, barking orders and updates at Greg, and then running to another location to look over the edge again.
Shit, he thought. Shit, shit, shit. This was all his fault. Sherlock was in danger because of him. It was all he could do to hope and pray he wouldn’t arrive at the pool to find his dead body on the wet floor waiting for him. The very thought caused hot bile to rise in his throat in sheer panic.
He and Sherlock broke out of their dazes to find two beautiful, young women standing by their booth.
The young girl he saw yesterday with the long, brown ponytail came swinging down on a rope from a high post. She landed flawlessly in front of Sherlock ready to take orders.
“Well, he told me you pushed him out of the way so you could take the bullet. He fell in the direction of your gun lying on the ground. He said he grabbed for it, and then crawled back to you hoping to god you were alright. He saw that you had been shot, and sort of lost all control at that point. He and Mary both reloaded their guns. You passed out, and he shot her first. That’s it, I think.”
“I love you,” he whispered directly into it. He moved lower and suckled lightly on a spot barely an inch below his earlobe. John’s eyes fluttered shut as he sighed softly. Sherlock released his suction and replaced it with soft, grazing, deliberate kisses. Just tiny pecks across the expanse of his slender neck.
But instead of saying any of this he fixed her with a pointed glare. “I have 59 missed calls from Sherlock, Mary. As you already know. I’m going to make sure he’s okay.”
He dragged the light across the whole wall to reveal an entire string of letters scratched into it with unhuman force.
“Yeah, of course.” John chuckled warmly. He resumed his previous careless strokes in the hair right above Sherlock’s ear. He leaned in a pressed another kiss on his lips, this time surer of himself.
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because you are the one behind bars at the bottom of a pirate ship, and I am more than capable of letting you starve.”
John sighed and leaned against the circular bar counter, watching from afar. He couldn’t deny that a part of him was hoping Sherlock had run off the floor in a fit of jealousy. And that when John found him hiding off somewhere alone and upset, they would have some deep, heartfelt talk like something from a rom com.
The beginning of ‘Lucky’ by Jason Mraz played into their living room. He made his way back to Sherlock, his heart filling with warmth at his shyness, and stuck his hand out in offering.
"Oh, don't be like that, love. We go to dinner all the time. It’s our first time celebrating your birthday together and I wanted to do something special.”
Another hour or so into the party, the two of them remained at their booth watching the drunken, wiggling bodies mashed together on the dance floor.
Whereas  in the first part of his tale, Sherlock had been quiet, shaky, and hesitant, his voice was now firm, confident, and more determined than John had ever heard it. His heart shattered at the sight of him. So broken and hurt, yet also determined, angry, and vengeful.
“What? What would it have done to you, John? Please tell me exactly what would have happened.” he shot back, his eyes hard and challenging. “Would you have been upset, John? Would it have affected you so much to have me removed from your life? Would it really?”
But she, Mycroft, and Scotland Yard were all joyously happy for them. And John and Sherlock knew it, no matter how they chose to show it.
John leaned down to kiss him. Normally, on a day to day basis, they would part ways with a small peck to the lips. But this time, John took hold of his chin and held the kiss a little longer.
John still wasn’t sure if what had happened in the mansion had meant anything to Sherlock at all, and didn’t know how to ask him. He had never seemed particularly interested in sex or romance before, and certainly not with him. He had made that especially clear their very first night.
John woke to an empty bed. He lay on his stomach with his arm outstretched as if it had been thrown over someone. Sherlock waking up before him was to be expected. He never slept long, and it seemed that somewhere between the hours of 4 and 6 a.m. they actually had fallen asleep.
Sherlock’s face scrunched up in anger at the colloquial address. He unlocked the door, stormed inside, and grabbed John by the front of his shirt. Bending so his nose was almost touching John’s, he growled through gritted teeth in his deep, baritone voice, "I am not your mate. I am your Captain. And as of right now, you are my lowly, pathetic prisoner. And if you so stupidly choose not to cooperate with me, I will very much make your life here a living hell.”
He knocked firmly three times. He waited a minute and knocked again. No one came. Perhaps Mrs. Hudson was out? He reached out and gave the door handle an experimental tug. It was unlocked.
“Yeah, I know. But not anymore. That was years ago.” John didn’t miss how she turned to gaze sadly towards Greg manning the wheel masterfully. He took the opportunity to sneak another glance at Sherlock, but nearly jumped when he saw he was already looking at him from across the ship. Neither of them looked away. John ignored the little flip his stomach did and struggled to read the man’s expression. Apologetic? Sorrowful? Almost… longing?
He attracted the appalled gazes of several nearby guests. Sherlock beamed down at him, smug that he had gotten him to laugh this hard.
John looked around the room – at Tony watching him expectantly, at Sean nervously fidgeting with his sleeves, at Victor eagerly awaiting his answer. For the life of him, he could not understand how he had gone from being invited to their top-secret meeting to being under such scrutiny.
“Well, then. I’ll get you another.” Another obvious pause, followed by a timid, “Would you mind if I joined you?”
Her voice, as calm and stone cold as ever, replied, “You know where he is John. I thought it appropriate to end this where I should have all those years ago when I had the chance.”
Sherlock finally snapped out of his trance and called out, his voice shaking slightly. “Jackson, Bolt, and Victor! Tie down the sails immediately! John and Molly, secure loose cargo! Lestrade, take us on!”
The corner of John’s mouth lifted slightly as he shook his head furiously. “Just when I thought you were more than just a cold hearted, inhuman machine of a pirate.”
Up at the bow, Victor was holding a death grip on the edge of the ship, still shaken from the anchor’s shove. He breathed heavily, slight panic in his eyes as their ship was slowly, ever so slowly, pulled in.
“I heard all about it, John. You don’t want a future with me. Fine. I guessed from the moment I met you that you were using me for a place to stay. I thought I’d been proven wrong over time, but I guess my first instinct was correct. But if you’re looking for a future with someone else, do us both a favor and stop wasting my time, because frankly, I don’t know what you’re still doing here.”
“It’s your fault,” chanted the surrounding voices. They closed around him once again, pulling him away from Sherlock.
Through the whole next verse, they took turns twirling each other, giggling like children, their eyes bright and twinkling.
They laid back and drifted into a comfortable silence, their content smiles lingering on their faces in the dark.
Sherlock mixing up baby formula into his chemistry set by mistake. The two of them arguing over who gets up in the middle of the night. John having to stop him from performing experiments on her.
“No, John. Um, also… I apologize for my mistreatment of you. And for taking you from your friends. And any inconvenience and hurt I may have caused you.”
Sherlock guided him to gently fall backwards onto the bed and land with a soft thud before climbing up and hovering over him.
Mary hastily pulled open drawer after drawer, rummaging through layers and layers of clothes she never wore.
Sherlock couldn’t answer. He leaned down and pressed his forehead against John’s. He rocked back and forth, stroking his face with his thumbs.
“Yeah, well. I was too busy chasing after you like a puppy.” He noticed the twinge of annoyance in his own voice.
Sherlock reached in again and pulled out a brand new scarf. But this one was different. It was a deep purple, its silky satin glimmering in the rain. Sherlock ran his fingers through the unbelievably soft material, letting it fall through his fingers like liquid.
“Victor,” Sherlock growled low and dangerously. “For just one moment, put your overinflated ego aside and realize that you stand no chance without Molly’s help. And the rest of us for that matter. Release us now.”
“Yeah. And if you want to play that game with me it will not end well for you,” he said stepping forward and puffing his chest out a bit. Not backing off a bit, John decided to see just how far he could push this guy. He looked back and forth between him and Sherlock, who was turned slightly more towards them as if listening with one ear. Pulling his best confused face, he waited for the man’s inquiry.
“Hey, don’t worry about it.” When Sherlock didn’t meet his gaze, he got up and went to the cell door, as close as he could to him. “Sherlock. It’s fine. I don’t even remember a thing,” he chucked uneasily. Sherlock looked up, let out a relieved breath he had been holding, and smiled. A true, genuine smile that John had never seen before. And it was beautiful.
“Shh, you can’t giggle, it’s a crime scene,” Sherlock murmured gently against the corner of his lip, a callback of their first case together.
Sherlock raised his head slightly from his microscope. He was still looking at it, but his vacant eyes showed that his mind was elsewhere. His shoulders had slumped like a guilty child being confronted by his parents.
Also, now that school has started up again, my updates might get a bit slower. I apologize ahead of time.
“That’s good. Cause, um. What I wanted to ask was… Maybe, if you want, you could… stay here? With me. Not as a prisoner. As a member of this crew.”
Besides, even if he did take the plunge in initiating a romantic relationship with Sherlock, who knew if he would accept? Maybe John had just been imagining things these past few months and he really wasn’t interested after all. Perhaps this was for the better. Maybe Mary was just saving him from an inevitable heartbreak.
His wedding day. When he spontaneously hugged him. Desperate for some physical contact after that declaration of love. Desperate to touch him, to breathe him in, to declare it back to the world.
They passed Molly, who was blushing furiously and avoiding eye contact with anyone. The door shut behind them, leaving Greg and Molly alone, awkwardly shifting from one foot to another.
“Come on.” Sherlock gently pulled him back into the bed and settled in next to him. John rested his head on Sherlock’s bare shoulder, and they wrapped their arms around each other in mutual comfort. John could clearly hear and feel their hearts beating hard in their chests.
She eagerly volunteered, enduring Jim’s merciless teasing afterward. “So you’ve gone and fallen for the army doctor, have you Annie?”
“Yeah.” His grin stretched wide as he looked down into Molly’s beaming face. “Yeah. Coffee sounds great.”
“John,” Sherlock said, sounding surprised. The line was quiet for a few seconds. “I’m – I’m glad you called.”
John couldn’t find his voice, but he managed a single, sheepish nod. Evans lips curled up into a sinister smile. The jagged scar over his eye twisted under the movement. “Good man. I knew you’d understand.”
No. He wasn’t going to allow her to manipulate him anymore. He forced her toxic, twisted words out of his mind.
“Sherlock?” he mumbled. There was no response. John swung out of bed, rubbing his eyes as he crept out of the room. The lights in the hallway and kitchen were off, but a single floor lamp in the living room was on. There sat Sherlock in his chair, leaning over with his forearms on his knees and a drink in his hand.
He pushed himself out of Sherlock’s hold and rushed off the floor. Behind him, Sherlock remained rooted to the spot, alone and confused, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back.
“Mm?” he mumbled, cracking his eyes open to see Sherlock kneeling by the couch. His shoulder was violently shaken.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up towards his. They seemed to be begging him to say something more. John could only stare back and hope he’d answer with what he wanted to hear.
In an instant, Sherlock’s eyes darkened. John could practically see the carnal desires and instincts taking over.
He wasn’t getting out of this alive. He just knew it. But the part of him that still believed in Sherlock, that had always believed in him, urged him to believe otherwise.
He descended the stairs and rounded off into the kitchen. There, Sherlock stood in a pair of tight pants and a black button-down. The top few buttons were popped open, revealing just a tease of those beautiful, pale clavicles.
Sherlock hissed approvingly through his teeth before guiding his face back up and sucking his lips back between his own.
Sherlock placed his skull on the mantelpiece – the one he’d had since he was a boy. It was one of his most prized possessions. He’d picked it up from his mum and dad’s house that morning, glad to finally move it into his new home. He straightened it until the angle was just right and then stepped back. It was one of the last little touches the flat needed, like his framed picture of the periodic table and John’s Union Jack pillow. After a month of unpacking and rearranging things to their liking, 221B had begun to feel like home. Sherlock put his hands on his hips, admiring the setup of the mantlepiece and fireplace with a satisfied smile.
But Irene wanted a true fresh start. So she left for America. Sherlock wondered about her every now and then, but never heard from her again. Now, nearly four years later, he certainly never expected to receive a six-page letter from her in the mail.
He suddenly became aware of their hands on the ledge of the ship. Sherlock was standing upright with both hands placed gently on the ledge, and John was leaning slightly with his wrists crossed over it. If he just moved his hand ever so slightly, he could... No. He settled for scooting an inch towards Sherlock as subtly as he could.
he grumbled to himself as he roughly undid the laces. John chuckled to himself as he watched the taller man huff and puff like a child being forced to do as they were told.
He tore the doors open and whirled inside to find Sherlock on his knees with his hands up, and Mary pointing a gun to his head.
“Yeah, sorry. Just, you know, with Mary and the wedding and everything, we never really got to spend time together after you returned. I mean, we went on cases and stuff. But nothing like this.” He smiled warmly. “I really missed you, Sherlock. I don’t think I told you that.”
He thought about the growing wetness in Sherlock’s eyes as he had yelled, but shook it off. He knew Sherlock would be fine. He’d taken a scolding from him before, just not anytime recently. He would get over it, but right now John needed some fresh air and time alone.
But he was bleeding. Oh, he was bleeding so much. He could feel the warm, sticky wetness in pooling in his side.
The three of them were chased down several levels by Jackson and Bolt. Although his own life was in danger, John’s only thought was on Sherlock. He had told him to run, and there had been nothing in his eyes that suggested the possibility of that being the last time they’d see each other. Sherlock meant to survive this. And currently, he and Victor were alone on deck. Sherlock could handle himself against Victor. Right now, he just had to focus on himself, Greg, and Molly escaping from Jackson and Bolt.
Sherlock indistinctly mumbled something along the lines of  “not as hard as you,” and slammed the bedroom door shut behind them.
"I'm really proud of you for calling it off Sherlock. Truly." He inched his hand towards Sherlock's, and Sherlock definitely noticed.
John’s head dropped onto his shoulder as they swayed to his music. Slow and rhythmic. Nothing fancy. Outside, the first flurries of snow began to fall in front of their window. It was a bit early in the year for snow, but the sight was welcome. The yellow streetlights and empty sidewalks made Baker Street appear picturesque and quaint. Quiet and homely.
When he got home, John would tell him he did not appreciate being excluded from cases like this now that he was back, and he most certainly didn’t need breakfast to be made for him.
He turned on her. “You’re absolutely sure you filed Moriarty’s autopsy files here and nowhere else?”
How was Sherlock letting this happen?! Granted, he did appear to be more annoyed than anything else, sitting still with his sharp gaze fixed straight ahead.
he thought with a sinking feeling in his gut. He realized Mr. Daniel Ray was probably what Sherlock had had his gaze fixed upon in the booth the whole time Julia was flirting with him. And he had probably asked them to dance so he could keep a better watch on him, but he got distracted and lost track of him. So he ran off.
But redirecting his gaze towards his sleep-flushed face and mussed up hair only reminded him of the hours they spent awake last night. Wrapped in a cocoon of limbs, softly stroking skin and rubbing toes to let the other know they were still awake and not going anywhere.
The door to Sherlock’s room opened and Molly stepped out followed by a furious looking Victor holding a change of clothes. “John. Sherlock says he wants you moved from the brig to a nicer cabin.”
Sherlock practically tore him away just as the chandelier crashed onto the spot he was just standing. They guarded their faces as broken glass flew in all directions.
“Then how the bloody hell do you explain last night? Did I try to strangle myself? What about Josephine? She just made up her whole childhood, did she?”
“Oh, yeah?” He tried not to sound too shocked. That would be a dead giveaway. “I’m proud of you.” He could feel Sherlock grin, even without seeing him. “What brought this on?” he prompted, hoping he would tell him about last night.
He reluctantly had to agree Sherlock was right. There was no other explanation for all the facts. William Walters probably knew about what his wife did and wanted to protect his dear Josephine from ever coming near the house again. And Josephine was a little girl in a family with a history of schizophrenia when she experienced all those strange things. They couldn’t exactly take her word for it.
When Mrs. Hudson opened the door for them, Sherlock immediately pecked a quick kiss on her cheek and entered without invitation. John followed and apologized with a small smile.
Sherlock looked up at John. The rain was now heavily pouring down on them. John's hair was flattened down on his forehead. Rain was sliding down his face and the bridge of his nose. He suddenly knew how he would tell John just how he felt about his birthday and the gift. He cupped the back of John’ head, pulled him in, and kissed him fiercely, pouring every ounce of gratitude he had into it. When they broke, John gazed up at him delighted.
It was a weak attempt at humor. And a failed one at that. Sherlock’s eyes darted back up to meet his. They showed no hint of amusement.
“I’m not your patient, Sherlock, and I’m not a fragile little flower that you need to keep at home to protect.”
But he stopped himself. He knew himself well enough to know he would be instantly drawn in if he asked.
As their eyes met, their smiles dropped slowly. The unspoken question was written all over their faces. They both remembered.
“It’s alright.” He guided John’s bleeding head into his lap just as Scotland Yard turned into the alley with flashlights in hand.
"Dammit, Sherlock! We don't care! This is the final straw! You've called off seven ambushed in just the past week alone. With no reason. We’ve all noticed this sudden change in your judgement. We demand to know what the hell has gotten into you." John recognized this as Victor's voice.
“Don’t be silly, John. We’ll have plenty of opportunity to dance our hearts out at Julia and Stacey’s wedding next week.”
“I mean, I know you don’t like to do much for your birthday, but it was our first time as a couple, and I really just wanted to do something special. And I know it doesn’t really matter what we do, cause spending time together is what makes it special, but… I still wanted everything to go well. Dinner, sunset… it was supposed to be great.”
Thanks to everyone who's stayed with this to the end and for the kind comments! My next long fic will be a sort-of HLV fix-it, so stay tuned for that
“No, first thing we’re doing when we get home is going the fuck to sleep.” It meant to come out as a playful, yet somewhat serious retort, but the effect was lost through his chattering teeth and shaking voice.
The thought of raising his child with Sherlock had never occurred to him. He wondered what their lives would have been like with his baby girl included. He pictured Sherlock bouncing her on his lap, feeding her her bottle, playing peek-a-boo.
John’s toes curled in appreciation at Sherlock practically worshipping his throat. The way he devoured him so slowly, so lovingly, as if he was something to be treasured, warmed his heart and sent a fresh buzz of arousal flooding through him.
He couldn’t try to have a secret relationship with Sherlock either. Mary would instantly figure that out too. Like she said, she’s not an idiot. She really has him backed into a tight corner and she knew it. No wonder she was so smug.
“I thought you were given a job to do,” said a voice behind him. John realized how long he must have been staring and turned to see a stocky man with short, dark brown hair looking back at him.
She had recalled that as a little girl, odd things would happen when she visited her grandfather. A yank on her hair, breath on her face at night, a sudden temperature drop . . . No one had ever believed her. Everyone just chalked it up to a wild imagination. So when her grandfather, William Walters, died and didn’t leave her the mansion, she grew suspicious. She was his only family left and the mansion had been in their family for five generations. Naturally, it should have gone to her.
“Moriarty can make Sherlock dance like a puppet, John. You know he can. He can make him do anything he wants just by pulling the right strings. He can make him hurt himself, Mrs. Hudson . . .or even you.”
Okay, stop, John told himself. Clearly spending too much time with Sherlock clouded his judgement, and distancing himself from him cleared it. He could never allow this to happen again. He could not allow his carelessness to get Sherlock killed. He would simply have to distance himself emotionally and physically from him as much as possible, as difficult as that may be.
Upon arriving, he was immediately greeted by two familiar, large hands gripping his shoulders, pulling him slightly aside.
I hope you're all having a fun summer <3 Please leave me a comment if you can! I love receiving them!!
Her assault rifle and two semi-automatics still lay there, collecting dust.  She clutched her chest in relief. She knew they’d still be there. But after today, she felt a burning need to check as soon as she came home, just to be sure. She barely even heard John dart back out as soon as they’d arrived. Probably off to Baker Street or who knows where. There were more important issues at hand:
“Get off me, you prat!” He shoved Sherlock hard, rolling him off of him and onto the ground with a thud.
John thought. Sherlock had done something kind for him and he spat in his face. Now here he was in comforting him in the middle of the night.
John’s head was spinning. There was a gap in his knowledge for his mum’s side of the family, so he couldn’t exactly dispute it. Nor could he argue with his mother’s name showing up as one of Gina’s nieces.
Sherlock’s insides ran cold from the moment he saw John in that well, alone, suffering, and nearly drowning.
Not this time. He looked afraid. There was something he couldn’t explain, something dangerous, and it scared him.
Victor returned with a yellow, fuzzy blanket and wedged himself between John and Sherlock. “Idiot! Why didn’t you get the blue one I like?” he spat. Nevertheless, he took the blanket and wrapped it close around himself rubbing his arms. Victor flinched back, clearly hurt at the petty comment.
Throughout the week, Sherlock continued to invite John on cases. And John continued to decline. He spent all day at work, and was quickly running out of excuses to not be home with Sherlock in the evenings.
But when he opened his mouth, he was soft and vulnerable again. "John," he breathed almost silently gazing down at him almost desperately. John remained cupping Sherlock's face tenderly before the world around them came crashing back into reality.
“I’ve thought it over. I have to admit, the three of you plus Sherlock and his thugs made a handsome crew. So instead of keeping you as my…. prizes.” He punctuated this word with a lingering, suggestive glance at John, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “I’ll off you a quite a merciful choice: You can either come on board and work for me…. or you can stay here and die. The choice is yours, lovelies.”
No, John didn’t trust himself to open his mouth just yet. Instead he just held Sherlock’s face in one hand and brushed the curls on the side of his head with the other. “Shhh…” he coaxed, stroking him softly.
John buried his face in the shoulder of Sherlock’s suit. Sherlock clamped his arms around his back, pulling him in tight - tighter than what could have possibly been comfortable. John squeezed back just as hard in response.
"But you could have looted. Taken their valuables. And you didn't. I know you have a great heart underneath all that, Sherlock. I could see it from the start."
John’s mouth pinched into a line as he thought. “I don’t know. I always knew it wouldn’t be too hard to track Harry down if I really wanted to. But I wanted to leave it up to her to rekindle things. Since she’s the one who left."
He took her hands again. “And we can have that again! Just you and me. Like we were always supposed to be.”
Anxiety raised in John’s chest at her threat. At least previously she had tried to keep her malicious intentions subtle. Her sudden switch to being so direct and vicious towards him sent an ominous shiver down his neck.
I hope you guys liked this chapter! :) It was difficult, not knowing what a lot of these locations look like in person, or how bombs work. I did barely any research about the bomb stuff because I didn’t wanna get put on some FBI watchlist for my Google searches lol. So please excuse all the errors that I’m sure are there.
He wondered, what was in it for her? Why would she want to kill him or prevent them from being together? She knew she could never have him back either way.
Sherlock put two fingers to his neck, just as his body fell limp. He panicked with helplessness. He didn’t have John’s medical knowledge. He wasn’t equipped to deal with this. He didn’t know what to do, who to call, where to go.
“Yes, John. I’m coming. Hold on.” Even the sound of that voice was enough to just slightly calm his nerves.
The time he had been taking care of Sherlock after Irene had drugged him. He came to check on him, brought him some water, and before he could stop himself had dropped a kiss onto his forehead. Given, Sherlock was drugged out of his mind and likely didn’t remember. But either way, neither spoke of the incident again.
He stuffed his hands in his pockets and followed Victor to the lounge. If he was lucky, he could make his escape without having to make any excuses.
John smiled and buried his face in between his cheeks, poking at the tiny, red, puckered hole. Once his tongue was wriggled in as far as he could manage, he closed his mouth around it and gave it a loud, wet smooch.
John turned his head back in Sherlock’s lap so he was facing the rest of the cell. Across from him, Greg continued tending to Molly. He occasionally leaned in and whispered in her ear, causing her to giggle and reply in similar whispers. She leaned into his shoulder as they continued their private conversation in hushed whispers and laughs.
“Oh?” Sherlock hummed, looking slightly disappointed in John’s eyes, but maybe that was just sleep deprivation.“Oh, yes, alright then. Goodnight, John.”
John couldn’t put himself through that. He couldn’t be with Sherlock, he reminded himself. Not without getting him killed, and he couldn’t heartlessly lead Sherlock on or torture himself by letting loose with him.
Due to the mishap at the supermarket, they showed up nearly an hour early for John’s dinner reservation for two.  While they were, Sherlock started chuckling to himself.
“Come on let’s see what you got,” she teased, and John began to move with her. She turned around so her back was against his chest and reached up to touch his face. The two of them stepped side to side in relative time with the music. Stacey’s dancing was upbeat and energetic, whipping her head from side to side and shaking her hips, but John only kept on watching Sherlock.
Afterwards, the reception took place in a party tent on the other side of the church. Guests mingled and sipped on champagne. Sherlock stood to the side, watching as the happy couple walked around greeting their guests. He had lost track of John but decided to let it be. They didn’t socialize very often, and if John wanted to chat with other people for a bit, he decided he wouldn’t get grumpy about it unless it lasted longer than fifteen minutes.
He watched that pale, bony hand trail slowly and teasingly down the side of her curvy body, grip her thigh, and pull her leg up against him. He looked back to John and smiled coldly.
But when Josephine told them about her grandmother who was found dead on the property several years ago, he began to lean forward, drinking in her words. The grandmother, Gina Walters, had hung herself shortly after her second child had mysteriously gone missing. And that was when Josephine remembered odd things beginning to happen in the mansion. There were rumors in the family that Gina had practiced witchcraft, and had somehow cursed the family. But they were nothing more than that - rumors.
“Well speak of the devil,” Tony gloated, marching up to John with the knife. John hissed when the sharp blade was shoved up under his jaw. “Did he say I could carve my initials in his face?”
He stopped in his tracks when he reached Sherlock smiled wide. It churned John’s stomach. He began stroking his chin in mock-thought.
The floor beneath them trembled slightly, and another low growl vibrated throughout the house. They stumbled flowered and gripped each other’s forearms for balance.
“How nice,” Sherlock said sarcastically, obviously not caring in the slightest. John kicked him under the table again.
Victor turned the corner and faced their cell. “Sherlock. Come with me.” Sherlock made to detangle himself from John, who was leaning against his chest.
"As a child, I was always fascinated by ships. Pirate ships, luxury ships, military cruisers, anything. I loved them. I would even pretend to be a pirate, the adventure, the danger, all of it. I found it fascinating. My older brother Mycroft was the only one who condoned this fantasy of mine. Come to think of it, he was the closest thing I had to a friend growing up. Of course, the same couldn't be said about today. We've grown apart, you see... Anyway..." Another deep breath.
“I decided to drop the plans regarding Moriarty and avenging my family’s deaths,” Sherlock mumbled into John’s chest.
Instead of pushing him away, John lifted his hand and cupped the back of his head, pushing their foreheads back together.
“Yep. On it. And surely you have one to do as well?” The man scoffed at him with an unfriendly grin.
“I told him that from the very beginning,” Sherlock said proudly, squeezing his shoulder in a quick side hug.
“John. Look at me,” Sherlock said quietly after a while. It was barely above a murmur. Just meant for the two of them to hear even though Lestrade and his officers were standing nowhere near.
“Sherlock. Shut up. Just shut the hell up right now.” Sherlock’s words made John’s blood boil with anger. He could feel his face burning beet red. He couldn’t believe Sherlock was sulking over a segment of a conversation he overhead without context. Not only that, but he’d decided to pout about it like a child instead of simply asking him about it.
The voice got closer, and a petite woman emerged from the hallway carrying another box of men’s clothing. John did an instant double-take. This woman was the last person he’d imagine to be married to Tony. He’d guessed that Tony was in his late-50s or 60s. This woman was at least a decade older than that. Though clearly, she was anything but a wilting flower.
“If you insist.” Sherlock leapt up and dove into their shelves, shoving things about and tossing items behind him. "Honestly, John, if you insisted on doing something for my stupid birthday, a simple dinner date would have done."
Sherlock was now looking at John with a shy fondness he had never seen on him before. His eyes were getting glassier by the second and he seemed to have stopped breathing.
“Memories are unreliable. Studies have shown that nearly thirty percent of our memories are imperfect reconstructions of previous events.”
“Oh John, congratulations!” Mrs. Hudson said, giving him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. “Doctor Watson does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?”
He turned on his side and closed his eyes, trying his hardest to ignore the prickling feeling in his spine that something was watching him. From behind. The same feeling he had gotten in the cellar. He turned on his back and stared at the ceiling so he could keep both sides of the room in his peripheral vision.
So John settled for scooting them both back to the headboard of the bed and pulling Sherlock into his chest, burying his face in the curls on top of his head. He stroked his arms and whispered soft, comforting words into his ear. When the taller man had fallen asleep, John laid him down, pulled the blankets up to his neck, and retired to his own cabin.
With that, he stomped off to his cabin where he planned to stay until this was over. He sat on his bunk and buried his face in his hands. Joining the crew had been a mistake. How could he have been so
The force of his voice made him stumble back a step. He furrowed his brows at John’s tone. He hadn’t been on the receiving end of a glare like that from him in quite some time. For a moment, he thought John was going to scold him, or perhaps get angrier. But John only looked him up and down with a resigned sigh.
Once they were safely in clear waters and Greg could leave his post at the wheel, he came over to Sherlock, who was slightly warmer but still shaking.
I'm SO sorry for how long this update took. But in all honesty, I can't promise it'll get better. This has been the hardest and busiest semester I've ever had.
“Not good enough! You’re the only one here who could have identified his face with 100 percent certainty.  If a stranger performed his autopsy, who’s to say it was even his body?”
Hoping Sherlock wouldn't notice in the darkness, he slightly turned his nose to breathe in the scent of his curls, shamelessly indulging in their closeness the same way he had in front of the fireplace. He shivered remembering how goosebumps had raised on every bit of pale skin his fingers skimmed over. How they had been so close, he could feel Sherlock's warm puffs of breath on his lips.
He saw the outside light flick on underneath the door followed by a pattering of feet running up the stairs.
“God, I love you, John,” he sobbed silently into John’s hands, barely able to hold himself up. “I love you… I love you…” he repeated in broken whispers.
He didn’t fail to see the irony in working their case. His client was in love with her best friend (Pierto) and concerned that he was in a somewhat abusive relationship with Beppo. Little did he know how much his life would reflect this particular situation in the coming years.
This was not how tonight was supposed to go. He was supposed to keep his distance and fucking behave himself.
Sherlock moved lower and hovered over his left nipple, breathing softly onto it. After stroking the hardened, pink nub with his thumb a few times, he swiped it with his tongue and closed his mouth over it.
“You thought I wouldn’t catch on to what you were doing?” Victor kicked him in the stomach. “What kind of idiot do you take me for?” Another kick. He left him on the ground for a moment, clutching his stomach and gasping for breath.
Sherlock looked down at him as he slowly slid himself into the widened hole. John tried to maintain the eye contact. He loved the intimacy of it. But he couldn’t help moaning and throwing his head back once it was all the way in. Sherlock took the opportunity to nip at his neck. He rocked his hips, setting a decent pace as his teeth grazed the already marked up skin. John whined and fisted his curls again.
“We’ve got four guys who are handling most of the logistics. The problem was that none of them knew me when I first approached them. They didn’t trust me. Thought I might be setting them up. And you know, I respected that. I like my men to be cautious. But I needed someone who could act as a mediator between us. That’s where you come in. They’ll trust you as an arms dealer, so you’re going to communicate to them everything I need them to do. Be my eyes and ears so to speak. My representative.”
Confession time: I actually wrote this whole fic because the cheating scene popped into my head (and the idea of rewriting S4 was something I was toying with at the time) so I combined them and here we are!!
Evans slammed the drawers shut and stalked right up to him. “Where were you last night?” he asked plainly.
Sherlock agreed, and was much happier to dump the problem in Mycroft’s lap. Now, as far as the government was concerned, the Walter’s mansion never existed.
“We need to take him back to his room and warm him up properly,” he said. Greg put one of Sherlock’s arms around his shoulders and lifted him up. Before John could get the other side, Victor rushed in and grabbed his other arm.
“Hallucinations, hearing voices, trust issues, all those things she described,” Sherlock said, pacing around the dining table. John sat on one corner with his laptop verifying all his information.
Sherlock sat up, clutching at his chest. He pulled his hand away to reveal three lines slashed through his shirt, over his left pectoral, and blood oozing out of the gashes in his skin.
Just moments ago, he had been recovering from an overdose that should have been fatal, after almost flying off for a suicide mission. Now he was back in 221B. Back in his home, but with no time to even take in the sweet, familiar smell because any moment now . . .
“Yes, but I always liked it better when you go without a cut for a while, and it begins to fall on your forehead like this. It’s more wild and spontaneous”
John’s head fell back onto his pillow just as Sherlock reentered the room. What do you say when you find out your best friend that you love has shot your supposed ex-wife that would have killed you both if he hadn’t?
When he looked back up, he flushed with embarrassment at the knowing amusement in John’s eyes, which were still fixed directly on him as he waited silently. But Sherlock didn’t speak. He only watched. Watched as John momentarily dropped his gaze to the freckles on his neck before settling back on his eyes, eyebrows still raised in almost a challenge.
John slowly stood, wary of his wobbling legs. He took one step forward. Two. Three. Never once breaking eye contact. At last they were standing right in front of each other.
As they locked eyes, John could actually feel the air electrify. He wondered if Sherlock could feel it too. John had been on this ship for several weeks. Weeks of short visits, sneaky glances, and desperate gazing from across the ship.
John’s anxiety spiraled out of control as he struggled to control his breathing. The memory of Sherlock lying on the floor of Magnussen’s office with blood spilling from his chest flashed in his mind before he shut it out.
He put a hand to his chest and caught his breath, beaming back up at Sherlock. But after a moment, his smile dropped slightly.
Sherlock Holmes died the next day, and so did Jim. At least, that’s what everyone was supposed to believe. Sherlock had died for real. She watched him jump with her own eyes, as she once again had her sniper rifle aimed at John. He was just as charming and handsome as she remembered. She couldn’t wait to meet him face to face.
He raised his fist, knocked, and waited. No reply. He knocked again. Nothing. He put his ear to the door, but couldn't hear the normal noises of Sherlock bustling around his room. Pushing the door slightly open, he peered inside. When he still didn't get a response, he pushed it open all the way. Sherlock was gone.
“Go on then, genius. What’s your theory?” John challenged, crossing his arms. He didn’t know what the hell was wrong with Sherlock. At this point he was blindly denying what was in front of his face. It simply killed him inside that he couldn’t explain it away with science and logic.
John turned away here. Sherlock was going to see it up close and personal, and he couldn’t watch. He felt him caress it lightly with his fingertips. Again. And again. John expected him to move on soon, but he surprised him by leaning down and pressing a hard, lingering kiss right over the scar. He opened his eyes in surprise and looked down at him.
Sherlock exhaled and hung his head, like a disappointed parent. The pang hit John in the chest like a lead weight, and he jumped to explain himself. To defend himself. Anything to save what they had.
John’s heart dropped into his stomach. Was this not what he thought it was? Did Sherlock just feel ramped up from the danger and adrenaline and need an immediate release? Was he not supposed to bring feelings into this?
The front doors opened to reveal a grand entrance. Not at all what one would expect from the outside. A circular chandelier hung low from the ceiling, centered in between two curved staircases leading to the same second floor hallway. The interior of the house was mostly wooden, dark in color with an almost reddish glow. The deep burgundy walls were adorned with lantern lights that cast a warm glow throughout the area.
Mary leaned her head back and laughed when she saw what he was doing. “Look at him, John.  So pitiful. Even after all you’ve put him through, he still ends up here on his knees about to die. All for you. I’d say he looks almost glad to be of service, wouldn’t you say?”
“It was lovely meeting you both. Just call if you need anything.” She dropped a wink. “Sherlock has my number.” She chuckled lightly at his expression when she said this.
"I suppose, now that you are one of us, you have a right to know." He paused a moment as if gathering his thoughts before continuing. "Jim Moriarty. The most dangerous pirate mastermind the seas have ever seen. His attacks follow a very distinct pattern, which I've been tracking for several years now. When I find a ship that fits, I take it. My crew searches for any hints, any traces of Moriarty. He leaves clues, you see. It's almost as if he wants me to find him. It's this sort of cruel game he plays. When I get what I need, my crew loots, and I take captives for questioning if absolutely necessary."
John got up and followed him to the kitchen. “No, really! I think you should call Mycroft and tell him how you feel. It would be really sweet.”
“Take in your daughter. Make her our own. Raise her with you. If that’s what you wanted. If that’s what would have made you happy, I would have done it without a moment’s hesitation.”
John automatically stood up, doctor mode activated. His first instinct was to ask what happened, inquire about the case and find out what had gotten him in this state. It seemed like a bloody fantastic tale and he was simply dying to know every detail.
Sherlock wrapped both his arms and legs around him, pulling him in tight. He tended to do that during sex. He seemed to desperately need John’s weight on top of him. They both got off on the intimacy of it.
. . . Except somehow he did. As the two of them hugged in the Holmes’ living room, she vowed to finish Sherlock Holmes. Someday, but not yet. For now, she just had to be thankful John still wanted her.
She was stroking a long, painted fingernail down Sherlock’s cheek and was somehow nearly in his lap.
“I’m always afraid,” he continued. “On cases. Of putting you in danger. I’m afraid because . . .” He swallowed thickly, as if forcing the words out. John allowed him to take his time, tenderly running his fingers through curls on his nape.
When he came to, he was lying on the deck floor, his head pounding audibly in his ears. He could feel his hair matted down with blood on his forehead. And even though he hadn’t moved yet, he could tell his entire body would scream in protest when he did.
“S’okay,” he whispered in reply as he stroked the damp curls on his nape. Sherlock buried his face in his neck again, relaxing as they caught their breath. They lay in bed for what seemed like an hour with the sheets remaining crumpled and bunched around their ankles.
Sherlock no longer wore that self-satisfied smirk from earlier. He looked stony and furious, his expression full of betrayal and bitterness.
“At this point, you are deliberately hurting me, John. You know very well what I want from us. Yet you insist on heartlessly leading me on and then pulling away at the last moment. Do you deny this?”
He spotted a broom in the corner and made his way towards it. "This broom is not usually out like this. It's been recently used." He looked in the trash can. "Broken glass and lots of wet napkins.” After breathing in a huge whiff of the garbage, he continued, “A glass of milk must have spilt and you stayed to help her clean it up." He opened the cabinet which contained Mrs. Hudson's glasses and found an envelope. He snatched it up and tore it open, clearly pleased with himself.
Moriarty snapped his fingers in realization. John’s couldn’t figure out if his hesitation in recognizing Sherlock was an act or not.
Their form was sloppy and loose, unlike the previous dances they had shared, but it didn’t matter. Not to Sherlock, and not to John. Everything about this shared moment, alone in the comfort of their home with the fire blazing warmly, secure in the company of each other- it was just perfect.
“God, we are never taking a case like that again,” John said through his laughter, as they sat up and dusted dirt, grime, and rubble off each other.
eyes fixed on him. When he leaned back, Sherlock seemed to be malfunctioning. His eyes fluttered madly. Was ‘adorable’ an appropriate way to describe a man like him?
