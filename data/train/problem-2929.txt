Dean turns left instead of right and follows the directions Sam gives him until they’re in front of an antique shop.
Dean pulls the fries out of the oven right as Sam walks into the kitchen with a case each of their favorite beer.
Dean freezes like a deer in headlights.  He barely grabs a dish towel to cover himself before Sam comes bumbling in, a yawn stretching his mouth wide, not even attempting to turn the light on. Sam stops, eyes still half shut as he opens a cabinet, hands reaching into the darkness searching for the pills.
The Walmart is an hour southeast, and luckily it’s barely out of the way as they head for the hunt in Broken Arrow.
Dean nods, his throat too tight to speak.  She begins to ring up the total, wrapping the wax set, paper, and journal in a pieces of tissue paper before putting them in the bag.
It is a Tuesday morning when Sam begins packing; when Dean storms out of the bunker in the Impala for three days.
“Dean, I’m doing this for both of us.  I want you to understand, even though this decision is partly about me and my relationship with Heaven, and my choice to break that connection…  The other part of this is for you.” Cas fucking blushes now, and Dean’s legs would have given out if he weren’t laying down. “I’m also doing this so that you know, that no matter what happens, I’m staying right here with you.”
.  The sun visor’s mirror doesn’t lie— there’s the bruise of a hickey peeking out from the collar of his shirt.
Dean all but glares at the coffee cup in front of Cas, still too scared to look up. “You can’t though, it might kill you.”
After cursing the clock ten times for not making time move faster, Cas gathers enough focus and energy to go back to the rit zien.
Dean laughs, trying to remember what it’s like to act normal. “Yeah, man. Well, maybe not hustling as much as actually losing until I taught him how to strike correctly.”
“Did you find a case?” Cas asks lightly, trying to play it off like it’s no big deal.  He’s been itching to leave the bunker, after being stuck for five days straight, he needs something supernatural to distract him.
About three dozen angels are crowded around a table laden with ingredients from the spell used to pull him here, Hannah at the head.  All their eyes on on Castiel as he stands on the far end of space from them.  The energy in the room surges, everything shifts, and suddenly Castiel is standing next to Hannah.  Everyone is looking expectantly at him.
to help, my grace was not being resolutely directed by Heaven anymore…  God gave humans the ability to choose, he did not do the same for us angels.  But for whatever reason, and many of us have theories as to why, my grace’s function has become less purposeful to Heaven.  Some think it is because of the time I have spent as a human, when I was given the power of choice and free will, and that somehow has “infected” my grace.  Of course, there are surely ways to reverse it, if I wished.  But that’s not what I want.
Lisa. Lisa and Ben.  That was a curveball that no one could have accounted for. The more he lets himself think about it, the worse he feels.  He loved Lisa, but he was never in love with her.  Dean fooled himself into thinking that he wasn’t cut out for falling in love, maybe it just wasn’t in his blood.  Lisa offered him that domesticity and family life that he’d been craving since he was four. He couldn’t pass that up, not when he thought Sam was gone forever.  He needed to ground himself in something, not throw himself into the wind and keep hunting.
The first thing Cas notices is that the clipboard is in the same place he left it.  As if his entire world has shifted on axis and broken apart.  He wants to yell, to release the pressure that’s still building up inside of him.
The brothers work a couple more cases together (they even manage to make it to a Van Halen concert in Texas one weekend) before Cas finds a pair of cases, luckily both in Maine.  On the way back from the case— werewolf packs wreaking havoc— Sam asks if Dean wants to drive through Canada.  They end up in Toronto for a couple nights, spending an afternoon as generic tourists at Niagara Falls. They hit up a local concert; Sam bribes Dean into trying poutine— and later Dean ends up ordering another two plates. They even stand on the lakeshore for a while but not going in (it’s too cold and they want their first time at the beach to be a real beach, none of this lake crap).  Cas hadn’t joined them originally but he shows up at their motel room while they’re bickering about whether to see a hockey game or not because Sam would rather go to the museum.  Eventually, Cas ends up accompanying Dean to the hockey game while Sam goes to the museum.  After the game, Cas and Dean forgo food until Sam comes back and end up at the hotel soon after.  Before Dean knows it, he’s pressed against the back of the door and Cas is down on his knees. The hunter slides down the door when his knees give out after he cums; he pulls Cas into his lap, vigorously repaying the favor with hand and mouth.  Sam comes back later to find them both sitting on the closer bed watching Dr. Sexy.
The first few weeks after Sam left are the worst he’s seen Dean.  Most days consist of Dean locking himself in the room with the window for hours.  He won’t even drink most of the time, he’ll just pace, sometimes resorting to yelling on particularly trying days.  When he doesn’t think Castiel can hear, he will call Sam, sometimes leaving lengthy messages.  Not really begging or pleading, more just asking all the questions he didn’t get to ask before Sam left.  Sometimes Castiel thinks some days Dean is just asking the air questions out of desperation, since he left his phone lying in the war room or on his bed.
Cas closes the book, resting it on the seat between them.  He clears his throat. “So that I didn’t interfere with your hunting— your pursuit— of my grace.”
The two of them are so impassioned when they fight, so sure there is no possible way they could be in the wrong.  Cas will hide his fury at first (trying to remain level headed), while Dean lets it spill all over the room, coating the floor and walls until it soaks into Cas too.  Then Cas retaliates, his anger well timed to coincide just as Dean’s wanes.  It’s a push and pull that continues, leaves them frustrated with each other, until they’re both too tired to continue.  They go to bed angry, heads on their own pillows, but then Dean wakes in the morning feeling Cas curled around his back, his phone’s light shining behind Dean’s head as he reads the news.  He loves those mornings just as much as every other morning.
Cas sighs, the rain drops peeling down the window getting bigger by the minute. “I was thinking about all the important information I know about you.”
Castiel turns his attention back to the man in his arms.  His eyes meet Dean’s and he’s happy to find that Hadean-sunset blush spreading across his cheeks.
And like that, he blocks any wandering thoughts about Castiel with a thick wall of liquor and heavy eyelids.
,” he hisses. And he lets out a low scream. Dean jacks his fist harder, wanting every bit of Cas, for him to completely lose his mind. “
Castiel turns his head enough to see Hannah and Hamon out of the corner of his eye. “I will give you my answer in seventy-two hours.”
After a slow breakfast, Dean decides today he’ll finish chores around the house; his head hurting too much to focus on researching a new case. Laundry needs to be done, the kitchen needs cleaned, his room needs organized.  He can keep his mind busy this way; domestic life, he learned while at Lisa’s, can sometimes be mind numbingly dull.
“I am safe now.” Cas looks up at Dean and Dean grips the steering wheel harder. “I did not realize I did that.  I destroyed your home.  I am sorry.”
As they lay in bed later (after Dean comes twice from Cas’s mouth alone and repays him with fervent hands and fingers), Dean finally allows Cas the opportunity to explain.
It has been fifty-three days since Sam left the bunker.  It’s been fifty-three days since Sam has been mentioned between them by name.  It’s been fifty-three days since the bunker has had any semblance of calm.  It has been more than that since Castiel has been able to have a normal conversation with Dean.
Dean spots the the bracelet then, his chest warming. “Cas?” he says, burying his face in Cas’s shoulder again, hand coming up to rest on Cas’s back where the wing joint would be.
“And for the love of god, I’m not blind, I see when you two walk out of the room minutes apart after glancing at each other.  I know you’re not playing
, but if it means Dean gets to kiss Cas like this whenever he wants, then he’s not going to fight it. He can’t, he doesn’t have the strength or the will anymore.
“Dean,” Cas soothes, “it’s okay, it’s going to be okay.” The angel’s fingers brush the tears from his face, the hair from his forehead. He gasps around his clenched jaw, trying to hold it all it. “Dean, everything is okay, it’s okay,” he keeps repeating.
Dean turns over, clinging to the side of the bed because the center is still warm. Uncomfortable while it’s empty. He doesn’t even bother with the covers, he wants to fall asleep as soon as possible.
Cas recognizes an apology when he hears one.  He unfolds himself from the bed and pulls on a pair of sweats from the floor.  He half-expects to open the door and for Dean to be gone.
Once they pass the Kansas-Nebraska state line, with only twenty minutes remaining until they reach their destination, Dean starts getting antsy again. The need to say something boiling hot behind his lips.
They’re back in the Impala and Sam’s resumed reading the paper again. Dean turns on my stereo and stamps the beat out on the wheel as they start driving to their destination.
The vessel lies there, dead.  Cas knows he should feel some remorse for killing a brother, or at least for killing the vessel, but that’s all knocked aside by the rage that flares up inside of him.
, punches Dean in the gut.  In the best way possible, like it’s pushing everything back into place, the way it’s meant to be.
He uncaps the vial and everything is bathed in his grace’s light as his vessel reabsorbs it and his soul once again bonds with its own.  Castiel’s body suddenly feels full and weightless at the same time; the power strengthening him once again.  He can hear the Enochian passing his lips as he revels in his revived power.  The glass window above him shatters but the shards evade his vessel.
Dean scrubs his hands over his face, looking at the clock on the bedside table.  He groans quietly, trying to hide a cough. “Uhh, yeah, just something quick.  We gotta go on a supply run before we head out on this hunt.” He sits up, his joints popping all over.  Cas watches as his hands come up to rub his neck. “I’m going to take a shower then if you’re making breakfast.”
The doctor finds him a chair to sit in, and brings him another clipboard of papers to fill out when he “gets a moment.”
After interviewing coworkers, neighbors, and family.  Dean and Cas can’t seem to find anything connecting the victims.
“You wanna play, Sammy, see who the better player is?  Or how about darts?  I always beat your ass at darts.”  Dean appreciates the easiness of the banter between him and his brother.
He pulls away, smiling.  He rubs the back of his neck and looks out the window, taking in the snow around them. “Yeah, Sam, I think I’m fucking happy.”
Cas looks at his bloodied hands again, understanding what she is asking. “He attacked us...he’s still in the...alley.” Cas has to remember to go back and get his angel blade and…
?  The whole concept of hunting revolves around its inherent danger.  No one, no matter how good a hunter, knows exactly how a hunt will end.  The possibilities are endless when it comes to cases; Dean has been sidelined by a thirteen year old girl, he’s mind-melded with a dog, his life was turned into a television show, he’s had to babysit a shapeshifter.  Not knowing what to expect from a case, at one point, was thrilling; now with the thought of Cas’s mortality in mind, it’s terrifying.
It’s taken him well over a year to reach this point, and four days of battling with himself to finally admit it.
Castiel can barely get into heaven these days, especially if he doesn’t have the help of some angel he happens across in his wandering, and even then they have to feel great pity for Cas in order to break so many rules to smuggle him through the gates.
Dean rubs a hand across his face, groaning. “Just make sure he doesn’t choke on his own vomit, Sam.”
Cas’s hands are fisted in Dean’s shirt, right between his shoulder blades, not really pulling him closer, but making sure he doesn’t move.  Shifting his hips, Dean turns more towards the angel, bringing his hands up to cup his jaw.  He takes a deep breath, then another, their lips ghosting across each other’s. Opening his eyes, Dean sees Cas’s staring right back.
Almost instantaneously though, Cas grabs Dean and turns, pinning him against the door. “I thought these emotions would be subdued once my grace was restored.”
He closes his eyes and leans against the wall, it’s cool against his burning skin, his arm still draped over Cas’s shoulder. “Back pocket.” Some random front porch kissing scene runs through Dean’s muddled mind.
Dean stands behind him and look in the room, disgust clouding his face. There are at least a dozen various body parts strew across the room, and he’s not entirely sure they’re all human.
“One is the neighbor of the first couple that went missing, Henry Bolton, and the other is the owner of three of the six properties that are now crime scenes, Joshua James-Patterson.”
Dean lies on his chest, ear to his heart and arm slung across his waist, snoring because he refuses to admit he’s sick.  His leg twitches when his snoring gets a little too loud.
Cas comes out of the room, bag in hand, face as strong as ever.  The front seat receives a rush of warm morning air as he slides into his seat next to Dean.  He doesn’t know what else to do. “Cas, fix this,” Dean mutters, not meeting Cas’s eyes as he pulls at the collar of his shirt.
“Cas, dude, what the hell happened to you?” he forces out of his clenched jaw, angry that he’s injured and didn’t tell him, didn’t try to mend himself even.
“If I am not wanted here even now then what are the hopes for my inclusion if I become leader?” He has been angry since the moment he was pulled here, the silence just now filling with his outrage. “I have done what I thought was right, time and time again for Heaven.” Some more murmurs at that. “Yes, I have made mistakes, but haven’t we all?  I tried to repay all of those I have wronged.  Jehoel— Kushiel— Penemue— I have saved all your lives in battle.  Hamon— you remember the debt you owe me from millennia ago?  I have not forgotten.  And yet, even after the Fall, some chose to follow me— they
Cas blinks fast, his hands stopping where they are clutched in Dean’s hair. “I want to see your face.”  Dean almost laughs; Cas’s eyes have been squeezed shut for how much of this?
,” Cas moans, grinding his hips in circles on Dean’s cock.  A hand reaches up behind Dean’s head, gripping his neck.
“Are you looking at anything in particular?” a clerk asks.  Dean recognizes the voice as the one the greeted him, it belongs to a girl no older than twenty-five with dark hair and all-too-familiar blue eyes.  Her name tag reads Paige.
No, Castiel found another liquor store and drank it.  Then, he came across a trio of hunters, and could tell they desired a monster to hunt.  He offered himself up.  The angel doesn’t know what he was trying to prove to myself, or disprove.  Being without his grace has given him little caution for his wellbeing and no concern for outcomes.  These hunters had never come across an angel before, didn’t have a clue what they were doing when they were trying to take him down.  Yes, all the blades hurt and the bullets stung as they punctured his weak vessel but he was still laughing when they tried to perform an exorcism on him.
“How?” Dean asks, knowing Sam would have explained anyways.  He needed to see if he voice had normalized. It hadn’t.
Cas asks if he wants to stop for coffee, so they do.  Standing in line should not be as hard for Dean as it is. He’s twitchy with uneven breathing, which he chalks up to not sleeping well.
On a hunt outside of Memphis, Sam and Dean spend the majority of the time staking out a nest of vampires.  They’re trying to teach Cas the value of patience when it comes to the vermin, that waiting for more information on other vampires is worth it.  Cas sits in the back of the Impala, twirling a blade out of boredom.  Dean decides to go on a food run, and Cas tags along, leaving Sam to keep watch from the apartments adjacent to the vampires’ nest.  After pulling into the diner’s dark parking lot, he feels Cas’s hand press into his thigh. Instantly, Dean’s sliding across the bench, wanting this more than worrying about his nerves. The angel straddles his lap, and despite their cramped quarters (thanks to Cas willing away their pants), they are able to reach orgasm within minutes, days of pent up frustration spilling over their intertwined fingers.  Sam either doesn’t notice the smell of the car or it’s masked by the greasy diner food scent. Dean makes a mental note to try not to hook up in Sammy’s seat anymore, it kinda ruins the memory (but really, it doesn’t).
“Live a little,” Dean shouts into his ear, pulling him close so he can hear him. Cas pulls away, squinting at him, and Dean’s heart stutters out an uneven beat. “C’mon, man, loosen up, it’s a concert!” Again Dean’s shouting into his ear, their faces brush and he pulls away instinctually.
“Dean,” Cas says just above a whisper and Dean fights down the shiver that starts in his chest.  He rubs his fingers lightly over the part of Cas’s neck he kissed back at the gravesite.
The games goes as well as Dean could expect, considering Cas’s skills being equal to that of a child’s.  Gratefully the kids don’t suspect anything; they keep making smart remarks about Cas’s skills though.
First it was the research.  Sam and him would pour for hours over texts, manuscripts, news articles, and the internet.  Sam would teach him exactly what details to look for, how to sort through the fake supernatural cases and narrow in on the real ones.
“C’mon, lets see what she was talking about.” They step inside the building, the entrance looks normal enough. “I wonder what she meant by ‘whole damned building.’”
Cas realizes how close November second is— less than a month.  He is not sure what he is supposed to do with this information.  After all of the shit that this case caused, he’s unsure of how Dean will react to the anniversary of his mother’s death.  Unsure if this case has affected him as much as it’s affected Cas.
“I’ll even let you pick the movie,” Cas goads, running his hands up and down Dean’s torso, feeling his warmth.
“Morning, sunshine,” Sam laughs over the brim of his cup, not taking his eyes off the newspaper article he’s reading.
Despite the anger that the two harbored for each other during their argument, neither could deny the physical desires that weren’t being fulfilled in that same time.  Even if all Dean will get when they go back to the bunker is a kiss goodnight as Cas lays beside him,
Cas sighs, propping his head on his folded forearms.  He taps his fingers, trying to find the right words.  Dean stares at the crease forming between his eyebrows, watches as his expression switches between definitive and confused.
Without any sense of shame, Cas somehow manages to get his underwear off while never once stopping the steady grind of his hips.
I'm in architecture school, so posts will be sporadic, I apologize!  Also, beta'd by my awesome friend, Erin.
Castiel hasn’t told Dean how long he’s actually been tasked with the mission of watching him.  Doesn’t tell him he’s been paying extra attention to
“No, Detective Labeaux, we can handle it ourselves,” Cas answers, seeing Dean’s stance change as he prepares to return Detective Labeaux’s
“Do you think they’ll be out of those microwave breakfast sandwiches again?” Cas asks, pulling their supply list out of his pocket.
he looked.  He began to, not exactly embrace, but definitely not push away or ignore what was steadily growing between them.
Now Dean’s gift.  Thankfully Paige wrapped little information cards up with each item.  So he doesn’t have to explain the medieval bees wax seal set, or the pen made from holly, or the details of the embroidery on the journal’s spine. He watches Cas’s face, seeing how his lips move as he reads over the cards, the smile breaking out.
“These are all the confirmed persons somehow involved in this case. People living in the buildings, people’s DNA found at the crime scenes, people’s body parts found at crime scenes, and those who are dead at the crime scenes.  Oh, and those suspected missing from the scenes.” He indicates to the largest pile he has so far.  That means at least more people are either alive or zombies than unsuccessful transformations or sacrifices.
Dean turns, directing the full force of his frustration at Cas. “It’s different this time!” he yells, his chest heaving.
Cas’s hands then bat away Dean’s and he tugs him up.  Hungrily, the angel kisses him, trying to slow his heart. Dean’s hard cock presses against Castiel’s hip, but he ignores it in favor of the angel’s hands cupping his face. He didn’t realize how much he missed the tenderness of it, of someone close like this.  Fingers find every curve and line of Dean’s face, sliding over his jawbone and tracing cheek structures, pushing back his hair and tugging on his ear.  His lips follow the many paths of his fingers, peppering Dean with almost-kisses.  Dean feels like crying but—
Dean’s annoyed Sam isn’t on his side. “Fine,” he grumbles, “I’ll go get supplies from my car.” He turns on his heel and walks to the tunnel where Baby is parked.
Cas grabs his face and kisses him, rough and strong.  Dean can feel the anger leaking into the kiss, but he grabs Cas’s wrists and holds on anyways.
Sam sits opposite Dean in the diner as he reads another news article about the deaths happening a town north. Dean flips through the pages of John’s journal, not really intent on finding anything because they already know it’s a rogue reaper, he just wants to remember his dad.
Castiel’s eyes narrow as he looks around at the crowd, angels he remembers all too well not listening to him when he talked about how beautiful Earth and humanity was.  They laughed at him, said he had lost his intent, said those pests were not worth his time and certainly not theirs. “You want me to help fight against the angels on Metatron’s side,” he infers.
Dean had stopped, now his only movement being the hands rubbing Cas’s back, letting Cas enjoy his orgasm.  He grabs the angel’s hips but doesn’t try to move them.  Cas huffs in his ear.  He wants this to be good for Cas.
Now Dean pulls Cas closer, his hands holding him firm; he brushes his lips against Cas’s hairline, his temple; he presses himself tightly against Cas until there’s no room for air.
“I know, I know, but we’re supposed to be, so it’s okay.  Now though, now I need you to sink balls, not just get them next to the pocket for me to shoot in.  And you gotta shoot like this—” Dean rubs his hand on Cas’s back. “You gotta line up your stick with the ball and the pocket, but you know that— but it’s easier to do it when you’re almost eye level with the back of the stick.”
Not knowing why exactly, but mostly anger-fueled, Dean stands and follows Cas to the kitchen.  The other man is standing next to the stove, staring at the pot from lunch that hasn’t yet been washed.
Dean stares at the page in the book he is reading, it now looks like gibberish.  He can’t read it anymore.  He can’t think.  He’s almost certain he did not hear Cas correctly.
Dean hums along to the radio station for now, as they’re leaving Lebanon, in between his comments about how they need to be quick and methodical about this supply run if they’re going to make it in and out before the storm hits.
with Cas that he didn’t realize Cas was still pressing back.  He looks down again, his dick now buried to the hilt inside of Cas.  Dean loses it at that.  He pulls himself closer to Cas, his lips attached to his neck as he sucks a bruise there. He trails his hand from the angel’s shoulder, down his side, across his stomach, and grabs his cock. Cas all but shouts, the gasp falling from his mouth sounds painful.  He thrusts forward into Dean’s hand, pulling at Dean’s cock in him. Dean has to bite down on Cas’s neck to stop himself from screaming from the pull on his cock. Cas gasps again, pushing back into Dean now.
“I can drink at least ten fold what you did and not feel a thing, you are a lightweight.” He laughs again, Dean’s ears full of his sound despite blood rushing to his head.
Then they’re suddenly in the vestibule of an ER, nurses and doctors hurrying past as they tend to other patients.
“Aren’t you a little confused about why a demon would make a deal with a reaper?” Sam is referring to the crossroads demon they exorcised last night that admitted it was the reaper’s idea for him to offer loophole deals to the locals who came forward. “There couldn’t have been that many people in that town who all made deals at the same crossroads and just happened to have expired deals around the same time.”
“I’ve got this, Dean.” Sam sounds like a teenage who wants to get off the phone with their parent. “It’s simple really.  If it is this witch, then I’ve got her cleaned up in no time. I’ll be back before dinner.”
Halfway through the night, when rain starts to slowly fall outside, and Dean’s hand moved to clutch his pillow, Castiel grabs a sleep shirt and his boxers from the corner of the room where they reappeared.  He pulls the laptop from Dean’s bag and bunched the pillows so he could lean against the headboard to continue his research.
— point of reference in his life.  Dean pulls Cas impossibly closer, gathering him in his arms, breathing his name in his ear, knowing it’s not enough but hoping that it’s a good start to a long overdue apology. Hushed with a hug in return, Dean simply continues to hold on.
Cas joins them in the kitchen while they’re tossing the fries in a bowl, so they don’t have to come back in the kitchen to get seconds.  He tops his burger with the typical BLT toppings.
Cas moans, a low and broken sound pressing past his lips. “No, Dean, please.” He turns his face to look at Dean; his eyelids heavy with lust. “
The angel detaches and sits on the edge of the bed— taking the effort and time to unbutton his shirt.  Dean watches in heated curiosity; numbly follows his lead and pulls off his t-shirt, feeling shy. Cas drapes his shirt over the desk chair.  Dean’s fingers stall as they curl around Cas’s neck.
It’s then that Dean realizes their faces are about six inches apart. He swallows.  Cas’s lips are turned in a slight smile, his teeth exposed, and his navy eyes bright with mischievous excitement.
“— this way, all open for me.  I’m gonna make you cum so good, Castiel.” Cas pulls his head forward, locking their mouths in an awkward but filthy-hot kiss.
“Stop,” Dean demands quietly, kneeling on the side of the bed. Cas throws him an irritated glance before extracting his hand and fisting it in the pillowcase. His legs spread automatically when Dean crawls closer.
The fact that Cas hesitates in answering leads Dean to believe this might be the only point he has to make so Cas doesn’t go through with this
“I taught Cas how to hustle pool, we got a little plastered in the process.” It wasn’t a lie; it just wasn’t the truth.
A stray thought comes from the back of his mind.  Some mornings Dean would wake up, Cas already out of bed, and find him whispering into his phone in the kitchen or between the book shelves in the library.  He always assumed it was Sam on the other line, Cas trying to spare his feelings by not bringing up his brother more than necessary.  It must have been Hamon.
“With all do respect, ma’am,” Dean counters, finally finding his voice, “We’re just going where the boss says.  Now can you show us to the crime scene?”
. He scrambles to find the remote, turning it to the weather channel and letting that run as he’s forced to start his day.  Sam’s already out on his morning run, taking advantage of a break in the snow.
But he doesn’t stop, the smile stays on his face the rest of the quarter because Cas keeps smirking into the lip of his beer.  Laughing silently at his own joke.  And Dean can’t help but find joy in that.
“I told you, Dean, I have been hunting for months now, I know a thing or two.” Cas moves forward, tossing the brothers’ bags to them.
He knows it’s a low blow; he knows he shouldn’t bring Sam into it.  He also knows exactly why the brothers were so intent on making sure to ease him back into the lifestyle of hunting, it was his own fault he went insane before reuniting with his grace.  But that doesn’t stop him from being furious with Dean right now.  Continually, Cas would let Dean, and Sam, do as they please, even in situations involving Heaven and angels.  How many times did Cas have to fix their mistakes because of their foolish actions?  And he still let them choose their own path the next time.  The brothers were reckless in their actions, not learning from past mistakes.
Two hours later, once Dean has scrubbed down the entire kitchen while trying to level out, he decides maybe it’s safe to go find Cas.
“We know that,” Sam interjects. “But you can’t just keep doing stuff on your own because you think we think you’re weak or whatever— by the way, we don’t think you are— because eventually you’re going to do something too big for just yourself and we won’t be there.  Dean and I have been a team for a long time, that’s the only way we were able to make it this far.”
Dean gathers Cas close, cradling his head to his chest and pushing a leg between his, trying to envelop the angel, protect him.  Certainly he is trying to protect that angel from himself as well. He’s been a complete ass to Cas, especially these last six months.  The feelings of guilt and fear are still fighting against the him as he tries to push them away, but he has to keep fighting.  He thinks he might actually be able to win…
For the next couple hours, he stares at Dean from the foot of the bed.  His eyes glued to the point on his chest that proves he’s breathing.  He’s alive, he’s okay.
Sorry this took so long to post (and I'm 3 days past my self-induced deadline) but here is the next chapter.
Cas presses his face into the crook of Dean’s neck and takes a deep breath, before he slides out of Dean’s loose hold, only one hand absentmindedly touching his shoulder.  He bends to pull his pants back on, then throws a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes over his shoulder before slipping out of the room.
A quarter of the way through the four part series on the plague, and the bottle half empty on the couch next to Dean, he thinks about finding his phone to call Cas.
“And what about the others?” he inquires scathingly.  Frustrated and embarrassed that not one of them has spoken yet.
He’s not exactly sure what he and the man under him are going to do, what acts will be completed, but he does know one thing: he wants Cas. He needs his hot hands, his wet kisses, his low whimpers, his vibrating body.  Dean wants all of it.
It’s been almost a year and Cas is now just listening to the pre-downloaded album “For Cas” that he found while scrolling through his iPod.  It’s late, well past three in the morning, and Cas knows tonight is going to be another sleepless night.  Even before the promise of thirty-eight recordings from Sam, Cas had no intention of sleeping.  He still wakes up in cold sweats with a tight chest when he dreams of the battle.
“Cas, if this is about penance or whatever, trust me, you’ve made up for your wrongdoings.  How many times did you save the fucking world?  Man, you’ve saved it like fifty times by this point.  Way more than anyone else.”  Dean’s trying to find any reason for this not to be true.
Dean still doesn’t know how to react.  He’s pulling at his jacket, it’s suddenly too warm in the car.
) and aims a pointed glare at Cas until he sees navy staring back.  It looks painful for Cas to rise from the sofa, his shoulders heavy as he leads Dean out of the room.
Cas grabs Dean’s hair again, pulling his head back so their eyes meet. Dean swears Cas’s eyes are glowing. His thumb swipes hard one more time over the tip— and Castiel is coming.
A nurse notices. She throws the files she was holding onto an empty wheelchair and yells for a gurney. “Sir, what happened?” she asks, kneeling next to Cas, her hands coming up next to his.
This is no new confession. He drops his hand and shifts his eyes, ashamed to even look at Cas right now.
Dean sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. “Just some sandwiches.  We don’t really have all that much.” He looks down the hall before turning to lead Castiel to the kitchen. “Maybe we could run into town in the next day or two.  Or wait until we get back from the hunt?” Another apology.
, Dean thinks. “You know,” he says, half turning to Cas as they walk back onto the busy street, “it probably does.”
Dean thrusts his hips up, slamming into Cas with more force than he thought possible. The angel can take it. Cas is strong enough that Dean won’t bruise his hips with how hard he’s gripping them, forcing them to move at the pace he wants.
A few open their mouths, as if to speak.  One of them even clears their throat.  But again, no one talks.
But Dean doesn’t like the idea of having to go back out and interact with those idiots. He just wants to stand back here in the hall to the exit, talking to Cas.  He wants his hands on Cas again.
A too sharp laugh from Dean is all it takes for Dean to start coughing again.  He pounds on his sternum, failing to loosen the mucus in his chest. “You’re an angel, you asshole, you’re not gonna get sick from kissing me.” He forces the bar of soap into Cas’s hand and turns around.
Dean catch Cas’s eye, he’s still angry. “You have to be a part of the team, Cas, you can’t be a lone wolf anymore and expect to always win your battles. You have to let us in on your plans.”
Whatever speech Cas has written in his head is lost when Dean surges forward and kisses him roughly, mouths not quite aligned.
“Do you want to go see one of the bands?” He stops in front of a store. “I saw a pamphlet earlier that had the lists of performers, there is a cover band I heard playing some Led Zeppelin songs earlier that is to play again soon.”
After letting the car warm up, Dean starts to drive out of town, hoping they have enough gas to make the whole trip, he really doesn’t want to stop. But the snow might make it so that they have to stop.  It’s better than it was the last few days here, but definitely not good driving conditions.
In return, Dean tried his damnest to make the best life for Lisa and Ben. Yeah, he didn’t have a lot to give, but he could work and pretend and try for them.  He found a stable job working construction, normal hours that let him be home for dinner.  Interacting with the neighbors was simple enough; going out for beers with the other guys on the block was actually nice; maybe cookouts, tailgates, and block parties weren’t that terrible.  The hardest part though, was learning not to listen.  He had to change the channel when strange news stories came on, he had to flip to the sports section when he caught a bit of an uneasy “unexplainable” in the paper, he had to ignore the news articles online as he browsed the internet. He made himself a home, even if it was a new him, with someone he could count on.  Lisa was safe, she was predictable.
Dean twists his wrist as he pulls on Cas’s cock, feeling the muscles in his stomach contract.  His thrusting picks up as he listens to Cas’s moans, right in his ear, unable to hold himself back from the pleasure that comes with them.
Dean’s eyes are shut, either trying to fall asleep or trying to stay in his bubble of “don’t acknowledge this and it will be okay;” he isn’t sure. All he knows for sure is that whenever Cas has blinked the past half hour, he marvels at the angel’s eyelashes against his shoulder.  It makes everything real but not feel like a part of reality.  He can’t really explain it…
Dean tries his hardest to not think about Purgatory.  It still makes his shoulders twitch in fear every time he does. He nods, even though Cas can’t see it.
Dean awakes the next morning to the loud Christmas carols from some over-happy-feel-good movie playing
“We have to talk!” Dean yells back.  He takes Cas around the corner so it’s quiet. “Where the hell did you learn to play like that?”
; the list went on and on. Dean would listen for hours as Cas rattled off Shakespearean soliloquies between dry lips.  He didn’t know their importance and he’s sure Cas didn’t either. But to Dean, those quiet words meant improvement and hope.
“I want— you,” he stutters outs, his voice lower than usual.  Dean almost blushes at the angel’s confession.
“Cas, here, sit up, here, grab the headboard, yeah. like that.” He guides Cas’s hot and loose body into the position he wants, now kneeling on the bed, his elbows braced on the headboard.  His head hangs down, his breathing heavy.
He hears the turn of the lock and the scrape of the door as it opens.  Assuming it’s Sam letting me out to use the bathroom, he stands up.  When he turns around he comes face to face with Dean.
Dean’s hands twitch where they lay on his stomach.  There’s too many questions running rabid in his mind to talk.
“Yeah, I guess,” Sam agrees. “But, up until this point, he’s been living a nomad’s life, hasn’t he?  I don’t think he’s used to keeping stuff, y’know?” His expression is still unreadable.
Dean clears his throat. Yeah, it’s been bothering him, but as long as they find the sucker, he doesn’t care. “Once we get the reaper, it won’t matter much, will it? The deaths will stop.”
For months they’ve been not saying a damn thing to each other, always ignoring what was blatantly in front of them.  Or maybe Dean was just ignoring it and Cas had been feeling just as alone as he had. Dean realizes, finally, after months, that he can’t think of Cas from his point of view, but has to see things from Cas’s side.  In trying not to think about someone besides himself, he ended up being selfish.
Cas knows this is just Dean pleading with him not to help Heaven without saying as much.  But he can’t stop the anger that flares up inside him despite that. “So you just want me around to help with cases?” Dean stops pacing. “How many months did I ask you to let me hunt with you and Sam again before you finally let me?  How long did you make me
The girl smiles at him, making Dean feel a little less nervous. “Here, let me show you which pens can be engraved.”
His body drapes itself over Dean’s, filling all the nooks and crannies Dean so carefully leaves empty.  Dean’s hands are soft on his skin despite their calluses and cuts (Castiel reminds himself to heal the cuts later but not the calluses because who would Dean Winchester be without his roughness?).  Castiel can actually feel real sweat dripping down his neck.  He mentally traces the drop’s path until it drips onto Dean’s chest.
The long ride to the bunker is much the same.  Cas rereads the book he brought with him, still marking anything wrong he missed the first time around.  He only puts it down when Dean starts humming along with the Aerosmith coming from the radio. Then it’s back to not interacting. Dean knows he should do something, say something.
Cas rubs a hand over the back of his neck, he sees Dean trace the movement with his eyes. “Since we got here.  I wanted to know as much as possible for tomorrow, when we go talk to the cops.”
He looks up at Dean as he gathers the bloodied supplies from the tabletop. “Not as much as when they were tearing me apart.” His eyes are incredibly distant and Dean has to look away, almost overcome with the pain in them.
Just as Cas is about to approach the desk and demand answers, one of the doctors that worked on Dean turns the corner and walks straight for him.
Sometimes, Cas feels so large and so full with everything that is Earth, the life he’s living, being with Dean, that he doesn’t know how he’s expected to possibly fit more.  But
“We’ll figure it out, I’m not worried about that,” Dean sighs, pulling his food back in front of him. “And there’s still no evidence that these people are being murdered— no bodies have shown up.  So, for now, we have a little time to think about everything,” he reasons.
-Also Claire hadn't been reintroduced yet (okay well yes she had, but her character hadn't been as flushed out yet and I didn't know they were going to do the whole Wayward Daughters angle), but you bet your asses I would have written her in and Cas/Dean would have totally been overprotective parents (same goes for Jack).
Fear has taken up permanent residence in Dean’s chest, settling in nicely amongst his ribs, stretching out until it quakes through his fingers.
Cas bows his head towards Dean and whispers, “I tried to think of something no one else would have.” Dean nods, still too awed to talk.
Dean leans back, sitting on his haunches to reach for a pillow and hand it to Cas. “Hold that, I’ll be right back.” The angel clutches the pillow to his chest as he settles on his stomach.  Dean kisses the dip of Cas’s lower back before he stands up.
of Dean’s knife chopping the various vegetables and he barely notices the movement out of the corner of his eye before hearing Cas ask what is for dinner.
About five months after Sam left, when things finally began to feel normal between Castiel and Dean again, Heaven calls.
Cas knew not to expect one certain reaction from Dean when he finally told him about what the angels were asking of him.  But after arguing about it for the past forty minutes, he’s regretting telling him so nonchalantly in the first place.  He should have given Dean some warning first.
He throws together some pancakes while Sam watches the coffee percolate. The three of them sit down, still in their pajamas, and joke around.  Sam starts throwing his blueberries on their plates, and in return, Cas wills his plate to the other end of the table.  When Sam walks over to get it, as he’s reaching for it, Cas wills it back to the original spot.  Dean can’t stop laughing as he watches Cas repeat this childish joke on Sam. Sam sneaks some salt into Cas’s coffee in return; Dean’s cup receives some as well just for laughing.
He keeps his distance from Cas while getting ready, averting his gaze anytime he feels himself searching for those navy eyes.  With his bag packed and roomkey returned, Dean decides to wait in the car while Cas finishes dressing.
“Good morning, Agent Ashley…” Dean sits through the boring details of the information the officer gives him, about the “miracles” reverting and people coming into the station in a fit, demanding answers.  Dean just wants to talk to the mom one last time, tell her what happened and comfort her the best they know how, then hit the road.
Then his hands are on Cas.  He reaches around, his palm flat against Cas’s lower stomach, his other hand sliding down the cleft of his ass.  Dean stretches Cas open again, fingers rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. The hip twitches in response are almost enough for Dean get Cas off this way.  Turn him back over, bury his fingers in Cas, watch as his cock pulses and drools precum all over his stomach.  Hold his wrists above his head, whisper filthy promises of tearing him apart in his ear.  Fuck him until he’s screaming Dean’s name, hips undulating, grinding back onto Dean’s fingers eager for more.
Cas hurries and slides up behind Dean, slotting against his back and sliding his arms around his torso.
“See you then.” Dean hangs up. “Looks like we can go to the motel, not much else we can do tonight, Sam is going to the coroner’s then he’ll meet us,” he relays to Cas as they head towards the main street and the bustling crowd.
They get back on the road but it’s slow going with all the snow.  Dean’s pissed because they have to stop for gas twice at the rate they’re going.  They make it back to the bunker just in time for Dean to make dinner by a reasonable hour.
Dean’s knees hit the tile hard.  He holds his breath against the renewed panic swelling in his chest, not allowing it to escape.  He’s stronger than this.  He can’t fall apart because of this, nothing has even happened yet.  He’s freaking out at the mere mention of Cas giving up his grace; over Cas disappearing in his anger.  What will it be like if it actually happens?  His knuckles sting from hitting the wall so many times, over and over, only stopping just as the blood starts to spill.
Dean’s hands loosen minutely. “Look, Cas, listen, I don’t give two shits about the fucking Bunker.  I’m just glad you’re back.”
He fucks Castiel slowly, wanting to feel every single atom the angel is made of. Feeling Cas clench around his cock every time he hits that bundle of nerves.  Dean scrapes his teeth across Cas’s shoulder just like he knows Cas likes it. His tongue traces across Cas’s back, dipping in his spine, then kisses Cas’s other shoulder blade before scraping his teeth across that one as well.  The angel shakes under Dean’s touch.
— at bay. Just because Cas initiated what happened tonight...doesn’t mean he actually enjoys what they’re doing.
” Cas repeats into Dean’s mouth as he continues tiny thrusts, as if he can’t seem to make his hips stop. “C’mon,
Cas and Dean walk out of the room and decide to go upstairs, where there seems to be an awful lot of noise.  The hallway on the second floor is lined with body bags; it looks like a scene from some fucked up hospital corridor in a movie.
The last six years suddenly make sense to Dean. Every look they shared, holding more emotion than just eye contact.  Even the first time his eyes met Cas's, he knew in that barn, no matter what was coming, he'd never be the same afterwards.  Every touch; hugs that were just this side of too tight, hands brushing more and more, touching shoulders as they pass in the hallway.  One of the first things Cas told Dean: I grabbed you tight and raised you from Perdition; he never let go after, not really. Every "I need you" meaning something slightly more than the words could hold. He's been so careful these last few years, fooling himself into thinking if he didn't actually say the words then there's no way it could be true.  How wrong he was.
. He presses his tongue to Cas’s tentatively, as if this were his first time doing so, and feels a thrill shoot through him when Cas sucks it into his mouth.  Feeling light headed and heart beating insistently against his ribs, because he’s so overwhelmed, Dean turns away, his lips trailing along Cas’s cheek, catching on the stubble there.  He concentrates on sucking a bruise onto Cas’s throat right under the hinge of his jaw.
“Not right now…,” Dean says, hesitating. “I’m still wrapping my mind around this… I mean, I know what you want and I know that it will happen, but like you said, so many more things are going to change then just our day jobs… I guess, I guess I’m just trying to figure out what else is going to change.”
Dean is right, Castiel has been human this long.  He doesn’t deserve it though, he deserves more than to be discarded once his mission was complete.  Dean saw potential in the angel, whole or not.  If these damned frail humans can see his potential then why couldn’t the Lord or any of the other angels.  Ever since Metatron has been captured the other angels have not so much as whispered his name amongst themselves.
“That’s the longest we’ve been apart since...yeah,” Dean mutters that night, knowing Cas will understand.  He’s not sure why he says it, he never thought he’d be the guy to count the days he was away from his—
“No interruptions, I promise.” He holds his hand up in a Scout’s Honor, pointedly eyeing the two feet of space between their bodies.
He smiles in reply, eyes flitting back to the glint of strong feathers before they disappear in the light of the shitty fluorescent when Cas turns it on.
“No, it’s not.” It sounds like he’s shouting Dean knows he’s not. “Fine, I’ll just leave again until I find it.” The thought of Cas leaving again scares Dean, and he can’t pinpoint why.
“Ah, well, about that.” Sam coughs on the other end of the line. “At first they did just seem like normal suicides— you know what I mean, no unnatural interferences. But I’ve been talking to the coroner, and the weird thing is, each case, the victim strangled themselves the exact same way.”
“Yeah, well, I would expect you two to be able to handle it without one of you traveling hundreds of miles to crash on my couch.”
He needs to remember what it’s like to feel unwavering hope, as he once did, years ago when he first stepped onto Earth.  He had no other choice, he had to believe Heaven and the other angels would win in the battle against Lucifer.
“Also,” Cas pipes in, sitting down across from Sam, “voodoo is clearly involved, but there were no clues left at the crime scene.  Maybe at the rest there will be.”
Cas stills momentarily, then laughs.  Dean can feel his face burning.  The angel turns over, the wing staying in place to cover Dean.
He grabs a twenty-four pack from under the shelves in the kitchen and two more bottles of whiskey that he’d had hidden in the back of the freezer. It’s going to be a long night for the both of them.
“But— and I couldn’t tell you what— something sparked something in you and now I think you’re finally comfortable not always being in your box. And, if I say so myself, I think you’re happier this way.  Everyone needs to push their limits, everyone needs to find themselves. I’m glad you found yourself.” At that his face breaks into a huge smile and he looks like he wants to hug Dean, so he does.
He only hums in response, taking a sip of a coffee he bought for himself though. He notices the confusion on Dean’s face. “The coffee is warm.”
He’d been too ashamed all these years to ever bring up the cast off amulet. A couple hours after he’d tossed it, he went back in a panic to retrieve it, but the cleaning crew had already been through the room.  He pulls Sam into a hug now.
He wants to scream; so he does.  The sound bursting and bell-like as he swears in Enochian; any close windows shaking with the force of it.
He sighs, tired of his brother's remarks about his ‘rabbit food.’ “It has cheese on it already, besides there’s bacon on it too,” he notes, jokingly offering his brother one of the so-small-barely-passes-as-bacon bacon bits.
Dean stops Cas’s hips, letting his forehead rest between the angel’s shoulder blades. “No, angel, lemme,” he slurs, his mouth dry.
More and more moans fill the air as the pair finds their rhythm. Occasionally Dean will crook his fingers, finding Cas’s prostate, and stroking that bundle of nerves extra hard for a few thrusts.  Once three fingers are sliding in and out with ease, when Cas is barely able to speak, huffing out low moans muffled in the sheets, does Dean think he’s prepped enough.
Dean continues to sit, pretending to be engrossed in the after-game coach interviews. The corner of the screen becomes his point of focus, reading every word that runs along the bottom. Not even taking them in, not processing them, just filling his attention.  A distraction from Cas, who’s still nursing his beer in the opposite chair.
Dean grabs the angel's shoulder to catch his attention. “We’re driving to Lincoln,” he says, once he finds Cas sifting through some shelves in the library a while later.
Dean sits between Cas and Sam, his knee pressing firmly to Cas’s. “Youngest first,” he chides, definitely not wanting to open his presents first.
, baby,” he moans, his hands never leaving Cas’s body as he helps him turn over, Cas still skeptical.
A tip off from one of Bobby’s old friends leads them to a wendigo close to the Canadian border in Minnesota.  They’re practically going into this blind it feels like.  The last wendigo they hunted was almost a decade ago and they have to keep referencing John’s journal, which stirs up loads of nostalgia. It feels like they’re on a mini vacation because out in the middle of nowhere they found some family’s fully-stocked cabin and have been using it as a base while they hunt for this damned monster.  While Sam’s outside trying to find cell reception one morning, Cas corners Dean in the bathroom. They make out for longer than it takes Dean to do the rest of his morning routine.  That night, he tries not to think about it because his stomach still twists in uncomfortable ways when he imagines Cas’s lips trailing over his chest.  Turns out, the cabin wasn’t a seasonal getaway for some family, it was their home. The wendigo was actually the matriarch of the family and had long since eaten the rest of them, coming back to the cabin sometimes in hopes of finding more people who stumbled across it. Unfortunately, it met the Winchesters and Cas instead.
He thinks back to when Zachariah had trapped him in Heaven.  He was alone, both Cas and Sam had deserted him at that point. He wasn’t even sure if he was going to get out of Heaven— alive that is.  The apocalypse was about to be in full swing, the angels were going to force him to be Michael’s sword; he didn’t really have a lot going for him.
The case was pretty open and close, the men were able to gather enough information from the locals and talk to the mother of the suspected “miracle maker.” After they located the bones, they found a clearing in the woods to salt and burn them.  Dean suggested the bar down the street from the motel so they could both unwind, and Dean could perhaps pretend he was
He slides out and knows without a doubt that he’d do anything to fuck Cas again. Lucky for him, Cas is turning around before he even knows what’s happening.  Suddenly, he’s laid flat on his back, Cas scrambling to straddle his hips and realign himself.
Dean feels his chest compress itself, his heart swelling, his stomach churning. Being scared may have saved him from a lot of other situations in life, but right now he doesn’t think it will. He has Cas; whether this is Cas giving himself over or Dean finally being brought up to speed on everything, Cas is with him.  And having Cas is worth pushing past the leagues of fear inside the sea of his mind.
“Alright,” the kids steps forward, grabbing his stick from his friend. “Get ready to lose, old man.  I’m stripes.”
Cas looks at Dean like he’s a stranger, mouth still a hard line, but his posture changing.  Dean meets Cas’s eye for the first time since the conversation started. “Dean.” It sounds like a question; Dean doesn’t have any answers.
Sweating hands and strong arms gather Cas back into Dean, shoulders colliding awkwardly as they fight to get closer.  And the hunter loses all sense of self when his tongue explores Cas’s mouth again.
“That does match pretty closely to our numbers here, Dean,” Sam notes, flicking through his notes on the files. “We’ve seen worse, unfortunately.”
As soon as Dean’s breathing evens out, Cas walks out the ER doors; finding his way into an alley off the side of the ambulance bay.  He paces for a few moments, trying to reel in the overwhelming emotions.
The older brother’s eyes go wide as he opens the box Cas’s still holding. He grabs for the one covered in sugar before taking the coffee Cas is offering.
Cas touches his shoulder. “The ceremony will be safe, if that’s what you’re worried about.” Dean shakes his head, looking just over Cas’s head. “And I don’t have to go through with this until I’m ready.”
Dean takes a deep breath, making sure not to look Cas’s direction. “You exploded, Cas. You had a complete break— it’s like— it was like you were going through— through withdrawal or something. I’d never seen anything like that.” Dean feels ashamed but he can’t pinpoint why.
Dean surveys their bodies.  Castiel feels no shame, no embarrassment, as Dean’s eyes hungrily take in his naked form. “How the hell did you get it out of the sheets, man?”
“You never hunted as a human though!” This isn’t entirely true, but enough so that it’s at least a semi-valid point. “You worked at a godforsaken gas station and slept on the floor!” Dean utterly despises himself for bringing it up, for dragging those memories out of the box the both of them so carefully (non-verbally) agreed to keep tucked away. “You didn’t spend your down time learning to shoot a sawn-off or how to set traps or how to track, Cas.  You only know how to hunt as an angel!”
There’s nothing up here.  All the rooms are untouched, no blood or guts to be seen.  Both men double-check each room to make sure, but not one thing is out of place. It doesn’t look like anyone packed in a hurry or that doors were broken down, it’s like the entire floor of tenants just disappeared.
.  He’s not sure if he can remember how to breathe. Cas’s cock slides easily over his, which is still protesting against the strain of his briefs while a wet spot spreads.
And all of the sudden in slots into place for Cas.  He can’t tell that to Dean yet because even if it feels right he needs to understand it better before he can even begin to explain it to Dean.
Dean grabs the bag with the wax set and stationary then heads out the door, not waiting for Sam to catch up.  He tosses the bag in the back and turns the car on, gripping the steering wheel too tight as he waits for the engine to warm up again.  Sam gets in, stomping his boots off outside the car.
Once inside the Walmart, Cas and Dean split, Cas on non-necessities: food, medication, and first aid; Dean finding the essentials: alcohol and rock salt.  They meet back up at the checkout; arguing over which box of breakfast sandwiches to buy.  Dean finally concedes to the sausage ones because he got the El Sol instead of the uppity IPA stuff Cas has been drinking ever since Sam introduced him to it in Nashville.
“Yeah, that’s why I eat the salads too,” Same teases. “Not because they taste good or are healthy for me, but purely to watch your raging carnivorous blood boil.”
“There is a string of suicides in Denver and unexplainable miracles— if you can even call them that— happening in a town outside of Lincoln.” He almost looks proud at knowing about these cases before they do.
Then Cas moans, the sound so low in the back of his throat, sounding as broken and disheveled as he looks.  He pulls hard on Dean’s hair, forcing their mouths back together.  Then Dean can feel it, the warmth of Cas’s cum as it coats his stomach, and the resulting clenching of his ass.
“No, you weren’t!  You think I’m short!” Dean pins Cas’s shoulder down and crouches so his mouth is next to his ear. “Don’t
That evening they go out to dinner, stopping in the small diner across the street from the post office.  They have cherry pie tonight, so Dean splits his piece with Cas, letting him eat most of the ice cream.  As they kiss outside the restaurant, shrouded in shadow, Dean leaning against the Impala door, he tastes the tartness that lingers behind in Cas’s mouth.  He’s grateful to have the chance at this not-so-normal-but-still-normal-anyways moment.
Dean would be annoyed if Cas started to explain how every human gets sick, and how quickly evolving viruses are (especially the common cold virus), and that there is no sure fire way to ensure Dean’s perfect health.  Instead, he holds his tongue, hums a response, and walks to the kitchenette to reheat the Chinese food for Dean.
Cas smile falters slightly. “Oh, I thought this is the part when we left the losers at the table and took the winnings and ran?” His eyes squint, reading Dean’s expression and realizing. “But it is not.”
“Dean, I want to remove my grace,” Cas says, as casually as possible, while both their heads are bowed over books.
“You’re late.” He still doesn’t turn over. “We’ve been wondering where you were for months but you just disappeared on us again. I’m tired, Cas, I don’t want to talk right now.” Suddenly he’s too warm but refuses to take the covers off, trying to shield Cas from his ever-fueling anger. “We can talk about this in the morning.”
The hunter cringes away from Cas’s outstretched hand and makes a beeline for the bathroom. His hands shake as he fumbles with the lock.  There’s no room to pace in there so he resorts to sitting on the toilet, focusing on calming his breathing. It doesn’t work.
Dean wants to— he’s not sure— comfort Cas, wrap him up until he feels better, until everything is alright.  But nothing is ever going to be alright and Dean is the one upsetting Cas.
“Hey, man, what can I say, I go where the music takes me.” Dean laughs lightly and walks to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
-I started writing this before Eileen was introduced, otherwise she would have been Sam's love interest (obviously; plus everyone loves her), but I wasn't going to rewrite the past chapters to make it work.
Dean struggles for words, barely able to grasp enough to form a thought. “Cas, dude, you will make it through this. Just wait until we get your grace back. Besides, don’t you still have ol’ what’s-his-name’s grace?” he asks, trying to comfort Cas but knows he’s not.
He doesn’t know what he’s going to say.  He knows an apology should be one of the first things…  This whole thing is such a fucking mess; their lives are such fucking catastrophes.  If Dean was never a hunter, he wouldn’t have to worry about Cas’s life in tangent to their line of work.  If Dean was never a hunter, he would have never met Cas.
Dean hides his face in Cas’s neck, not sure what to say.  Still, so many questions are spinning in his mind; so many points and defenses as to why he should stay human.  But he keeps his mouth shut.  In the end, this is entirely Cas’s decision, and no matter what Dean wants, it won’t change the fact that Cas has made up his mind already.
Sam and Dean trade a worried glance. “What the hell did you do?” Dean says, the words tumbling out of his mouth much too quickly.  He’s worried.  The coffee and donuts were only meant to butter them up, not to celebrate god-knows-what.
Sam rubs his hands together. “Okay, present time!”  He leans over the arm of the couch and grabs all six presents. “Yours and yours,” he says, handing them to the respective receivers.
Cas was his salvation then, and still is now.  He keeps Dean together and moving forward without Dean even realizing it.  Cas will keep his hand on Dean’s thigh while he drives, calming the nerves he still sometimes gets heading out to a particularly strange case.  He will listen to Dean’s rants about “no good bastards” when they figure out the monster’s motive, his patience far exceeding Dean’s.  He’ll help Dean cook whenever he asks, their syncrosity in the kitchen surprising Dean until he remembers how well they fight together, both when cornering a monster and arguing with each other.
Despite the darkness of the kitchen, Dean finds a bottle of olive oil next to the fridge that Sam will just have to do without on his salads for now.
The conversation has turned from battling Metatron to the inner workings of their relationship.  Cas so selfishly wants to talk about their relationship, but he first needs Dean to understand he’s going to help Heaven.
Castiel licks at Dean’s cock until the hunter is almost whimpering because it’s so sensitive.  Castiel slowly crawls back up, Dean’s fingers ghosting over his body as their lips meet again.
Dean is utterly shocked with himself at this revelation.  Not that Cas needs the reassurance of being held or anything but he has to crave the intimacy of it. Dean knows he himself does. All that fear had been holding Dean back more than he even realized, he didn’t want to realize. He tried for so long to let this continue to unfold without ever stopping to think about it.
“I am joking, Dean,” Cas finally admits. “It is quite a foul smell.  Nothing compared to what Jupiter’s atmosphere smells like though.” Dean forces his jaw to lock so it doesn’t drop open. “Jupiter is composed entirely of gases found in this universe, and trust me, it looks more beautiful that it smells,” Cas explains as he walks through the rooms, while Dean hangs out at the doorways.
