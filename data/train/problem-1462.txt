Sherlock put his glass on the table and rose from the couch. He strode toward his violin on the window sill, fiddling with the bow. Could he ask for a real date? Could he ask for a chance? But what if there was none. John had already forgiven him for two years of unnecessary grief. Could he tell him, that he wanted more? What happened, if the answer was no. Would their friendship survive?
Sherlock nodded and they moved into action. They were finished soon enough. There weren’t many clothes, but John encountered another problem. He had no idea what to do with his gun. He had no gun license, and he didn't want to get Greg into trouble, who gave him the gun in good faith. John saw no chance that he could smuggle it through airport security. He also didn’t trust Stella enough to just hand the gun over. He had used the gun to kill someone. In the worst case, it could be used to tie him to a murder. He wanted to avoid any connection between him and the bullet in 218C Baker Street. At midnight, he and Sherlock came to a decision. They went down to the river, strapped the gun to a heavy stone and let it sink.
“While I don’t need a partner in a classic sense, I sometimes need a hug and some intimacy. It keeps me grounded. And sex is an easy way for getting that. Crazy thing is: it is easier getting laid than getting hugged.” A sad chuckle escaped him. John looked back up at Sherlock, who listen to him with complete attention.
After all that, John still had some minutes left from his internet time. So he checked the news, while munching his sandwich: Nothing of interest – only the always there celebrity gossip. Currently an Arab prince was in London and doing business here. His exaggregated lifestyle gained some press coverage. But for everything that happened to John in the last 24 hours, the world out there seemed to be calm.
The recording replayed the meeting of Sherlock and Moriarty on the roof. They discussed the 'game', how Moriarty engineered the downfall of Sherlock and the consequences if he didn't jump: snipers on him, John and Mrs. Hudson. There was a gun shot and a desperate phone call between John and Sherlock. Then silence, steps and rustling noises.
John took a deep breath. “Well, I am not. I think it's a reflex, because of the history with my dad. And in the army, there are lot of homophobes. I just hate the gossip. I am bi, if you want a label.”
‘No. He left after we had prepared the corpse. I have no way to contact him. I don't know if he is alright. Is there anything, I can do?’ she typed.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, John. You are brave.” Sherlock knelt in front of John. “Thank you that for still being with me. That you gave me this chance to meet you again.” He pressed a short kiss on John's forehead.
John closed the man's eyes and got up to a kneeling position at his side, catching his breath. He struggled to his feet and went to the sink in the kitchen. He spit out some blood, rinsed his mouth and washed his hands. His whole body ached. He might get some nasty bruises, but he didn't think anything was broken. He felt to old for this shit. He returned to the dead sniper and padded his frame for anything valuable. There was the phone, a set of keys, a wallet and some receipts.
Sherlock just nodded. They had already discussed this yesterday. He went to the wardrobe, fished out some clothes and vanished into the bathroom.
Greg stilled. He would have recognised the familiar frame of Sherlock anywhere. “Oh my God,” he whispered. He cast a nervous glance toward John to confirm what he saw, afraid that the long hours at the Yard had made him see ghosts. John just nodded with a small smile on his lips.
“Anyway,” John continued, “I don’t know how long this will take. Let’s use a code. Only trust someone, who uses – “ John thought for a second,” – ’Skyfall’ as code word,  okay?” Matt nodded.
John wrinkled his nose. Something tickled and and it finally woke him up. His eyes were still closed, but he sensed the daylight was illuminating the room. He was warm and comfortable. Slowly all his senses came alive. He had rolled onto his back during the night. Sherlock's head rested on his shoulder, arm and were leg flung possesively over John. John’s own arm was slung around Sherlock's waist. Sherlock's longer than usual hair flopped partly over John's mouth and nose, thus tickling him awake.
Greg opened the last audio file and listened. After a few minutes, he knew what the recording was about. His stomach rebelled violently the more he heard. Listening made him sick and he barely made it to the waste-paper basket in the corner. He violently threw up.
John just shrugged and stuffed the bills into the Mrs Hudson cardigan. She looked slightly exasperated.  She had kept silent so far. “Don’t you need that more?” she asked.
The first few seconds in front of the big bed were awkward. After some hesitation, they decided, to share the master bedroom, despite the availability of another bedroom. In case of an intruder, it seemed safer to stick together, and neither John nor Sherlock were ready, to separate for the night. The bed was huge enough, anyway. They had shared smaller accommodations during cases. They settled in the bed and turned off the light. Despite all the time together in the last 24 hours, there was still a lot to talk about till late into the night.
John chuckled without humour. “I expected something along the line: 'if something goes wrong, we will deny anything.'”
John suddenly understood what plan had just been hatched between the brothers without words. He felt no aversion against it. Desperate times called for desperate measures.
John descenced to the lower levels, where the laboratories and the morgue were located. There he looked for a broom closet to hide in. Soon, he heard the staff starting to leave the laboratories. Every ‘Goodbye’ and ‘See you tomorrow,’emptied the corridors and increased his chances to meet with Molly unseen.
Sherlock cradled his face gently between his hands and looked into his eyes. “What is it, John?” he asked concerned.
During preparation, John switched the telly on. The regular programme had been interrupted and breaking news about arrests were now broadcasted on every station. In many European countries, members of the police force and security agencies were sweeping into national offices to round up Moriarty’s men. High ranking policemen, but also businessmen and politicians were taken into custody. A close up on Sally Donovan showed her escorting a handcuffed judge to a police car. Operation Debeugging seemed to be in full swing.
“Well,” Sherlock said, and pulled some handcuffs from the pockets of his coat with a flourish, “my magic trick includes friends and people that we overlook way too often. Homeless people, women like Molly, Anthea or Irene; add to that friends, lovers, brothers.” Sherlock had one knee at the back of Moriarty and tightened the cuffs. The skin on Moriarty’s hands was squeezed painfully within their confines. Molly stood beside him and grinned stupidly.
Sherlock suddenly felt dizzy. His vision began to swim. He touched his cheeks. They were wet. More tears streamed down his cheeks. He stumbled to the sofa and sat down heavily. The tears wouldn't stop. Sherlock couldn’t understand. He took some deep heaving breaths. There were no reasons for tears.
John straightened up and grinned at Sherlock. They dismounted the rifle, wiped all surfaces they had touched and left the building. The van picked them and their equipment up and drove away into the loud and bustling rush hour of London toward Mycroft’s office. There they handed the rifle over at to a serious looking man in a dark suit. They disposed of their disguise and redressed in their own clothes. Their part was done and they went back to Mycroft’s mansion.
Mycroft was satisfied. “I will send a team to retrieve the dead body from the apartment in 218C Baker Street. Our database could not match a name to his face, but -”
Anderson huffed. “Being gay is just a hipster statement. I bet you that in some years, the so called gays will go back to banging women.” His eyes disparagingly fixed on John’s hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, “you are not the only reason, why I want to keep it discreet. I also don’t want Mrs. Hudson talking; and I don’t want any of my paramours getting attached. Keeping the distance is a good method for that. And it is also good for me to keep things separated.”
He clicked faster and faster through the files and almost missed one: A selfie. Sherlock and John were sitting on the couch at Baker Street. John was holding a newspaper to prove the date. Both were grinning into the camera with Sherlock holding the phone to make the shot. Greg knew the photo. Sherlock had sent it to him almost half a year ago to prove, that he was not chasing criminals across England, but staying at home. Greg couldn't even remember, why he had insisted on the photo and which case they had tried to solve. He felt himself grinning and then it came back: Sherlock’s phone. This was the final proof. He exhaled sharply. His stomach was churning.
Later in the evening, Mycroft joined them as well. He could confirm now that all arrests and investigations had been processed and that every person on the list that Sherlock had procured had been detained - except one.
He needed to call in a favour. He once saved the life of Matthew Tennant. Matt had been his superior on his first tour to Afghanistan. During his first assignment, Matt had made a mistake, which led his squad into danger. He had been willing to sacrifice his life, so that his team could escape. John, still young and eager, had fought at his side, despite clear orders, and had saved the situation and all of his comrades’ lives. At the beginning, Matt had been furious with him, later on, Matt became thankful. In the end, he promised to repay him. They finished their first tour together, but they only met once later on for a beer, despite both being Londoners. John would never have thought he would need a favour. But now was the time.
Greg also let slip that he currently stayed in one of Mycroft’s guestrooms. Since his impending divorce and the discovery of the surveillance on him, he had no safe place to stay. There was no time to go apartment hunting with his current workload and it turned out that this arrangement was quite convenient for coordinating plans with Mycroft. In addition, Greg knew where Mycroft had hidden the good wine and he now went to fetch some from the cellar.
The wallet was also disappointingly empty. It only contained money, but of that a lot: almost 1.000 pounds. John added the cash to his own funds. When he was finished  with all his tasks, he made a short trip to a small corner store for some food. After that, he went over his plan again.
The more Greg read and thought about it, the more wretched he felt. He had enough psychological training as a police man and boss to know how important acceptance and also praise were to every human being. Ridicule and isolation led to despair and depression. Were he and his unit part of Sherlock’s decision to jump? Was Sherlock’s self-esteem really that low despite his show of ego? John had told him once, shortly after Sherlock's jump, that his last eye-to-eye conversation was made in anger. John took it hard, that he called Sherlock a 'machine'. He blamed himself, that his words might have been the final straw.
The curtains on the window were almost completely drawn, only a small gap was open for the rifle and the sniper to peek out. John stepped to the window. There was a perfect line of sight to 221 b Baker Street into his living room and Mrs. Hudson's small kitchen downstairs.
A tide was rising, and he hadn't the energy left to swim. He suffocated but the wish for the next breath was fading. It felt like being crushed alive. No escape was in sight, no fight was left in him. Capitulation was the only option available now. He just wanted to fall into the all-encompassing quiet darkness to join his fallen comrades and, most important, his best friend. He failed them all, as doctor and as a friend. He cleaned the flat, cleared out the fridge, took out the trash and waited for Mrs. Hudson to leave for evening mass at church.
Sherlock stared at it. “Now I understand why my captor was so familiar,” he mumbled. His senses must have been heavily clouded by fatigue then. Now he was able to make the connection between the sniper and his tormentor at once. “What happened?”
John looked at Greg, exasperated. Some seconds later, a screeching noise could be heard and inlets in the wall opened. Water slowly streamed in. From a documentary, John knew how the system worked. When there was a risk of flooding, the inlets could be activated per remote control. The system helped too take the pressures from the dams. In case of high tide or flooding, there was pressure on the inlets and the water would pour in. The room would be filled in 20 to 30 minutes. The water level would rise and eventually would drown them. In a best case scenario, they would be flushed upwards and get blose enough to the hatch to escape, but in February, the Thames was freezing cold. They would probably die of hypothermia first.
Suicide - Greg secretly detested people for choosing this final option. Especially now, after newspapers had retracted their accusations and the deeds of Sherlock were praised again. Christmas papers were full of exclusives about Sherlock Holmes. Many of his clients had come forward and vouched for him and his methods. 'I Believe in Sherlock Holmes,' became a popular catch phrase. Eventually serious newspapers had done background searches of Richard Brook, revealed his faked identity and cleared Sherlock’s name. Sherlock was again respected and his genius acknowledged - but that would not bring him back.
John turned away from the car door toward one of Mycroft’s assistants. He huddled under an umbrella and clutched a backpack. John was drenched now; the leather jacket only provided moderate protection. An umbrella would be of no use anymore. And he hadn’t the heart to harass one of Mycroft minions. He grabbed the backpack and disappeared into the alley he came from.
Greg had watched everything from across the room. “What’s going on here?” he bellowed and made his way to them.
He had done it – the final piece to a complete overview of the network: People, places, transactions, documents. But in the end he got sloppy and made mistakes. He hadn't slept for three days and eaten almost nothing. His body longed for sleep, for food. But he had to stay hidden; he had transmitted all his information to his contact in Switzerland. He would take the necessary final steps to stop Moriarty's organisation.
He took the photos of Nick, the sniper and the crime scene and distributed them on the desk. John and Mycroft kept silent, watching him while Sherlock inspected the photos thoroughly.
“I thought some wine would be nice. Food is still a little bit warm,” John said,gaze fixed on the TV show in front of him. After no reaction from Sherlock, his eyes wandered to Sherlock. He stood frozen in the door way. John took in his attire, raising an eyebrow. “Do we have a case? Do we need to go out again?”
Sherlock looked up disbelieving. Up to now, Sherlock assumed that Moriarty had really killed himself on the roof top; another deception in this sick game.
Molly turned around to keep the entrance of the street in view. She grew restless. The van was long out of sight and but she was too afraid to follow on foot.
John’s heart sped up. ‘They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered’, he once read. He tensed again. Why did this feel so normal? Did best friends cuddle? Why was this okay, even though he had never thought of doing something like that with his army mates?
“Red hair dye and some fake glasses for a start. A suitcase, some clothes and toiletries would be helpful, too.” Sherlock grabbed the teapot and poured some tea for John and himself, while John started to fill their plates. John then began to outline his and Sherlock's next steps to Irene. Irene instantly sent one of her staff into town to go shopping for necessities.
He wanted to make him squirm, gasping for breath and stop thinking. Sliding downward, he took his time and kissed the long neck, pale shoulders and paid special attention to the perky nipples. Sherlock's skin was flushed and hot to his touch. He swiftly unbuttened the trousers, encouraging Sherlock to lift his hips and sliding them, his pants  and socks off in one go.  Standing in front of the bed, John took a moment to appreciate what lay before him. Long legs, lean torso and a straining erection nestled in dark curls.
The following evening, a dam was broken in John. He didn't want to care about social norms anymore. He wanted what was good for him. He hugged Sherlock close to him. He placed short tentative kisses on Sherlock’s hair and his lips wandered down to Sherlock's mouth. The first kiss on his lips was hesitant and unsure, but John gained confidence fast. It was not much different from kissing a woman. While with women however he usually was the instigator. Now it felt much more equal. John had never grown a full beard before, therefore the biggest difference came from the missing feeling of skin on skin. But that change was due to him, not because he was kissing a man. After some moments, they found a rhythm of giving and taking. Sherlock melted into the kiss and devoured him. Neither one needed to impress, but both wanted to please. They experimented what felt good, learning from each other.
The meal was delicious. They were both starved and inhaled everything to the last crumb in a comfortable silence. The rustling of the paper boxes and the clicking of the forks on the plates were the only sounds. The whole time Sherlock threw shy glances at John.
John felt light-headed. Suddenly the jump made sense. The nagging feeling of wrongness vanished. He wasn’t to blame. Sherlock was made to jump. He had solid reasons. Even if John would have gladly switched places with him, the guilt that weighted him down lifted. At the same time gratitude and disbelieve for the sacrifice of his friend for him took its place.
“Even full hard-core BDSM, mostly as dom,” John confirmed. “And role play, gang bangs, public sex, dabbled into medical kinks, asphyxiation, blood play (and I am a doctor, for goods sake), even water sports. I did every position of the Kama Sutra with a yoga instructor, twice. Shall I go on? I had sex with women, men, transgender, with every body type, with people from every continent and I once substituted as a living dildo for a lesbian couple, because they were curious. Is that enough for the beginning?” John drew a deep breath.
They went up to the 30th floor which was currently being refurbished. Plastic sheets hung from the ceiling and covered most of the abandoned desks and chairs. Mycroft had chosen this specific setting, because he knew that the refurbishment had been halted due to payment issues with the contracted company. Therefore, no workmen would show up today. The floor was deserted.
They settled around the kitchen table, snacking away on food from the fridge and brought each other up to speed. The mood was light. After John and Sherlock recounted their adventures, Greg was proud to report on the big progresses they had made so far in the current investigations. He gleefully told a story of how Anderson first tried to protect the superintendent of the drugs division from being arrested, but Sally just marched over him anyway. No love was shared between them anymore.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked disbelieving at John. “You think, Mycroft was right? You think I am a virgin?” Sherlock let his head fall back onto the back of the sofa and chuckled.
"You are partly correct in your assessment. But your sniper is dead. It's the man, you are currently investigating. We know about the other two but I don't have the resources at the moment to take care of them. That is the reason, why I need your help.”
John stared at him. After some seconds, his face softened and he nodded. John strongly suspected Sherlock was still alive. But he hadn't the heart or the proof to tell Mycroft so. What was worse, than giving the man hope, just to be proven wrong? If Sherlock was still alive, then he would forgive Mycroft anyway. If not, Mycroft still had to bear the guilt of betraying his brother. His hatred on top was unnecessary.
“After all the stress in the last weeks, how about some nice dinner? There is this new posh vintage restaurant...”
John stayed like that for some minutes until he was certain that the sniper was dead. He felt calmness settling over him, like all the times in the battlefield, where death was a frequent companion. There was no guilt for the murder: It was self-defence and revenge for his friend. Some of the self-loathing, that was a constant companion for the last few weeks poured out of him. It would not bring Sherlock back, but it assuaged the constant helplessness and he felt closer to Sherlock again.
Back with some coffee and munching a stale biscuit Greg unlocked the computer station that was available in the meeting room. He pulled up the files of the first phone from the server: Contacts, phone protocol, photos, retrieved text messages, etc. He opened the contacts file. Only two entries were listed:  JW and Q. The phone protocol showed some other numbers. Greg startled. One number seemed to be familiar: his own number. On a hunch he pulled up his phone and checked the number beside JW: John Watson's number. After scrolling through all his contacts, he matched Mycroft Holmes to Q.
John looked at the phone. On the screen he could see a distinctive smearing. He turned it into the remaining light. It revealed a sliding pattern in form of an inverted L. That meant only two ways to unlock. Right and up or down and left. John tried his luck: right and up. The screen unlocked.
John sat up and lowered his hands on Sherlock's pants. He tentatively stroked Sherlock’s erection through the material, watching him intently. John still felt a little bit unsure, because his previous sex life had not prepared him for this. It was like being a virgin again. But he was eager to rectify that. There was so much to explore.
“I am so sorry,” Mrs Hudson started weakly. “I should have suspected that the man who picked me up wasn’t a proper police officer. I should have asked for the code word.”
“He was always fascinated by the armed forces. He couldn’t enlist, because he had a bad knee. So I joined the forces instead because I wanted to make him proud. He died when I was deployed for the first time. I wasn’t able to go to his funeral. But with him dead, some of my reasons to do certain things suddenly didn’t exist anymore. I questioned my motives for being in the army. And I questioned my relationship with Anne, my girlfriend then. I never was a ladies' man, but as a doctor and soldier getting dates wasn’t that difficult. My dad had always pressured me to marry her. I never wanted to.” John struggled to continue.
Mycroft blinked, two, three times. His facial features shifted from disbelief, to shock and then relief. After some moments where everyone had frozen in place, he rose from his chair and strode past John towards Sherlock.
“Lestrade, you had worried about Moriarty's surveillance. We are no longer bugged. Dimmock was the one who reported our steps to Moriarty. He knew about Mrs. Hudson’s retrieval, the date when John and I went back to Baker Street and he had you in constant view. But he hadn’t reported on your dead sniper. Why? He was in Brighton at that time. I know, that is all circumstantial, but if you look through his things, you probably find more to incriminate him. It’s the only solution, that makes sense,” Sherlock concluded.
When they arrived at NSY, Greg was standing in the office kitchen at the coffee maker with Dimmock and Anderson and he waved them over. Dimmock had been able to solve his case in Brighton and had returned last week. With the old Superintendent gone, he hadn’t been able to report his findings so far and couldn’t officially close the case. Greg tried to squeeze short briefings like these during his coffee break and had reassigned Dimmock to a new case.
He felt Sherlock hugging him back. John’s senses confirmed this without any doubt: Sherlock was alive. He felt the ribcage pressed to his expanding with every inhalation, and the warm air of every exhalation on his neck. Warmth seeped through his clothes. The hair tickled his cheeks. This was real. He buried his face into the nape of Sherlock's neck.
Sherlock and John entered the apartment as they had done a thousand times before. But as soon as they had entered the living room they stopped, grinning at each other. They were back.
“No, no, no. You wouldn’t.” Moriarty was breathing faster, his eyes jumping around the ledge, looking for hidden devices, anything that could help him to see how Sherlock had survived the fall. The gun trembled in his hands due to suppressed fury. “Tell me! What did I miss?” he yelled. His hands made a wide gesture toward the ledge. The gun was no longer aiming at Sherlock.
The sound of a distinct clatter of shoes, no, high heels and two pair of boots, was intruding into his foggy mind. The bolt was unlocked and the door opened. He felt someone lean over him. “Sherlock, Dear. Time to leave,” a distinctive voice said.
After some time of soft kisses, Sherlock broke the kiss and rested his forehead against John's, looking into his eyes. “You are brilliant,” he whispered.
The cabbie looked around and spotted a small parking space between two cars further down the road. He slowly pulled up and parked.
They both had some individual therapy to deal with all the horrible stuff that happened. Firstly, Sherlock thought it superfluous, but his therapist was surprisingly competent. He made him see the value of emotions, the need to accept them and how self-care was not selfish but essential. This led to more introspective thoughts and the realization that he was finally in a good place and happy.
Mycroft chuckled. “Well, then I must congratulate you. You took care of one of the most wanted killers. The bounties on his head are huge. Almost every western government including some from the Middle East want him dead. There was never a photo nor DNA traces of him. But he has a distinctive custom-made rifle and ammunition. More than 50 kills are ascribed to him.”
Mycroft spoke up again. “I lost my brother, Dr Watson. Don't believe that I feel indifferent about that. Your hostility toward me may be justified, but you must know, that I deeply regret my involvement and my inability to help him. I hope, you can forgive me and we can work together against the murderer of Sherlock.”
Molly watched him worriedly. After John regained his composure he took the keyboard. ‘Thank you, Molly.’ John made sure that gratefulness was shown on his face. He smiled relieved. ‘Do you know where he is?’
“I have a thought,” Mrs Hudson continued. “Does all that mean Sherlock is still alive? If they kept the snipers around, then we must be useful in a way to them.”
Sherlock grabbed the case folder from Mycroft's hand and rifled through it. He stopped at the photo of the young man that was found with the sniper. “That's Nick,” Sherlock stated. “He sometimes helped me with cases; part of the homeless network. Clever guy.”
Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, and pushed his hips into John's hands. Sherlock watched with hooded eyes, his own hands buried in his still red curls. He didn't want to push John, but he was on fire.
Sherlock swallowed at the sudden increase in intimacy. He planted a reverent kiss on John's lip. “I'll take care of you,” he promised.
Upon entering, he steered Sherlock to sit on the bed and stepped between his legs. He cradled Sherlock’s face between his palms, bending down to plant a short kiss on his lips.
John was speechless. He had never dared to think, that the stunts he had pulled in the last weeks could somehow have a positive impact on his dire financial situation. But it seemed that in doing what needed to be done he had made a fortune. It wasn't all legal, but it had been profitable.
John just chuckled. He felt at home again. It was even better. He now not only lived with a flatmate and friend here, but also with a boyfriend.
John was baffled. He had thought Irene was dead. Mycroft had told him so. He gathered his wits. “It is good to see you alive too,” he responded, stunned.
“Well, I’ve checked them now,” Mycroft said. “They were mercenaries. One sniper was found dead in an old castle locked away on the north-eastern border of the Czech Republic. His name was Harry Musgrave.” Mycroft pulled two photos from a folder and put them on the table for everyone to see. One was the photo Sherlock had made with his phone almost three months ago.
Grudgingly he looked up the train connections to Ostrava. Just a look at the travel time confirmed, that the trip was harrowing, it took 22 hours. Additional to that, he had to switch trains seven times. But at least he could take naps while travelling. If everything went well, he would arrive Tuesday evening.
She painstakingly retold the woman on the other line everything what happened so far. But unfortunately she couldn’t tell her what kind of help she needed and where.
John shuffled back onto the sofa and Sherlock was pulled along to lie down with him. Sherlock went along willingly. His head got tucked under John’s chin and the arms hugged him closer.
When the kettle whistled, Sherlock shook himself from his stupor and determination settled on his face. He strode into his bedroom. John could hear the doors of the wardrobe banging. He was glad now, that he never had the nerve to put Sherlock's stuff away. Then he heard Sherlock retreating to the bathroom and sounds of the shower running filled the room. John settled in his chair, tea in one hand and flipping through his mailings – mostly bills and advertising. After 20 minutes Sherlock emerged again. His hair was still ginger, but the dark roots were showing significantly. However most of the old Sherlock was back: bespoke suit trousers, a tight blue shirt, black shoes and a dressing gown. The best thing in John’s eyes was that the clothes almost fit perfectly. All the additional food had been good for him. John had taken great care to feed Sherlock up again.
Tears were gathering in John’s eyes. He turned away from Sherlock. Sherlock stroked his back soothingly.
Sherlock sagged into his bonds. He lost. He thought, he was clever, but now it was over. He was a complete failure; Moriarty still alive, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson and John soon to be dead. All for nothing; he failed them. He failed John. He struggled one last time in vain against his bonds. Tears that had refused to fall earlier started to silently stream down his cheeks.
“I could send somebody to check up on her if you want. But as long as you can't go back to Baker Street, I would keep her where she is now,” Mycroft said. John knew that Mycroft was right. He would just try to get hold of Matt later on and send a short update to Mrs Hudson. She should know that she had been right with her assumption, and Sherlock really was alive.
After thirty minutes of waiting, a balcony door on the upper levels opened and two people came into view. John recognized the Arab prince immediately. He had been featured in the news often enough. A woman with way too flimsy clothes accompanied him. At first glance she looked like an escort. But John knew better: it was Anthea. Despite the blond wig she was clearly recognisable to John. She shivered and stepped back inside the hotel room. There she moved over to a closed balcony window door to keep warm, but she stayed in view of the prince.
Sherlock appreciated, that John took his time and placed his partner's needs before his own. When Sherlock felt John entering him, all the puzzle pieces in his life suddenly fit. He saw John towering above him, aroused, steady and confident. Sherlock lost himself in a wave of pleasure. John's cock and hand kept him trapped between two overwhelming sensations. John readjusted his posture to plant short kisses on Sherlock's lip while thrusting into him. After a few more forceful strokes Sherlock moaned and came. Sherlock's eyes fell closed, but he heard John's breath speeding up till John shuddered and fell on top of him. As soon as Sherlock felt his strength return, he hugged John to him. They stayed like that for some minutes, till John's breath evened out and he rolled off him and dropped beside Sherlock on the bed. He caught Sherlock's hand and planted a kiss on his fingers. He was grinning like mad.
Sherlock was somewhere out there. So he had to get out of London and into the game. He may not want to be best buddies with Mycroft, but this was his chance to get closer to Moriarty's network, and perhaps to find Sherlock.
John was happy. After three years of not being happy, it felt brilliant. He was back at Baker Street, he had cases with Sherlock, and a very flexible part time job that allowed said cases at crazy hours. And he finally had sex again. After the disaster with Mary - assassin on the run, trying to hide behind a new identity - Sherlock’s return, a lot of shouting, alcohol and smashing things he felt close to normal again. The constant grief and vigilance was no longer there and he could concentrate more on his needs again. Two month ago, in a sitting with his therapist he had realized something that cemented his current status of well-being. He wanted to be in Baker Street with Sherlock as long as possible and share his life with him. And that meant he would no longer pursue relationships that would take him away. Therefore he had given up dating. Or better, he would not take up dating again.
“If the car does not get towed and reported within two weeks,” Irene added, “I will tell the owner to report it stolen when he gets back. I will sort it out, don't worry.”
Molly had been waiting for that. She stepped out of the shadows, taser raised and ready. The moment Moriarty acknowledged her she had found her aim and pulled the trigger.
A black van dropped them in front of an office tower. They entered the building under the disguise of cleaners. Their outfit consisted of an overall, latex gloves and baseball caps. They were equipped with a cart that held cleaning supplies. The trunk with the rifle was stowed in the cart and concealed beneath bottles, disposable towels and trash bags.
First she looked confused, but John whispered: “I believe in Sherlock Holmes.” The woman nodded once. With that he straightened and walked back into the station to catch his tube to St. Pancras.
“Well, they drowned some minutes ago in the Thames. Or so it will appear. They will be found along the river banks soon.” Moriarty’s features distorted into a malicious grin. “Not original, but effective nonetheless.”
Mrs Hudson looked at the letter sticking slightly out of her bag. She hurried into a seating bench behind her friends at the right side. Thankfully the mass started, so the whole group had to settle into the seats. Her friends cast her some puzzled looks, but turned toward the priest soon enough.
“Do you have a place outside of London? That would be best. The less you are seen on surveillance, the better. And Mrs. Hudson doesn’t have any spare clothing. You need to go shopping. I can provide you with some money. And if you still have a gun: keep it with you,” John ordered.
Mycroft on the other hand dealt with the coordination of Operation Debugging in other countries, the re-manning of empty positions and securing evidence. He was also responsible for apprehending the more international and border-hopping conspirators in Britain. But despite all the successes, some problems remained. The most pressing was that they still hadn't captured Moriarty. Even they had no clue, where he was hiding.
“Hello, Dr Watson,” a woman on their doorstep greeted him. She was in her mid-thirties and dressed in jeans and a blazer. At a first glance, she seemed harmless, but John saw, that she held herself at the ready and clearly had an athletic build. She looked John over in a similar fashion: “I am Stella Hopkins from Europol. Mycroft Holmes sent me. I have orders to arrange your trip back to London.”
Suddenly, Sherlock felt like a big lump of stone loosened in his chest. John beside him turned toward him and grinned. Sherlock grinned back. Soon they started to chuckle, elated and both glad for having said what has been on their mind for some months.
His mind went blank, but his body moved on auto-pilot, fleeing, taking him upstairs, sneaking into the living room, dumping the bag with food on the coffee table, and leading him into his bedroom. Closing the door, he leaned against it. Breathing hard, he slid slowly down to the floor, head hanging between his knees. He felt hot and he shoved his suit jacket off and kicked his shoes away. Sherlock sat for a few minutes on the hard wooden floor, not able to find a clear thought. Slowly, he was able to take stock of his body: heart  pumping fast, nausea, hands cold. Panic attack? He took some deep breaths, got up on unsteady feet and trudged to the bed. He felt tired and confused. Laying down on his back, staring at the ceiling he struggled his thoughts into some order.
Greg was weary. He slumped into a nearby chair, fingers massaging frustratingly his eyebrows and forehead, trying to ease the tension. During these moments, he longed for help. His thoughts wandered to Sherlock, but instead of feeling exasperation by having to call him and being insulted, he still mourned. More than two months ago, Sherlock jumped from the roof of St. Bart’s Hospital. Greg sighed, because on the heel of grief, there was always a simmering fury. For years he had tried his best to protect Sherlock from boredom by providing him with challenges - ultimately to keep him away from drugs and therefore keeping him alive. But Sherlock got himself dead, because somebody tried to make him into a phoney.
“Sometimes I envy you,” John continued. “I have never seen you with anyone, except for cases. And I wish I could detach myself from my body like you. I don’t know… choose to become asexual. But it doesn’t work like that.” John drank the last sip of his wine. “I will try to keep everything discrete and I don’t want to bother you with them. I’ll try to meet outside of 221b.” He let out a deep breath. “Well that’s it. No need to comment. I just wanted to let you know.” John straightened up from the cushions. “Time to do the dishes,” he said, grabbing his plate and some empty containers and vanished into the kitchen.
Sherlock nodded. John opened the door and stepped inside with Sherlock in tow. John let go of his hand and picked up Sherlock's dressing gown which was draped over the bed to put it on the chair in the corner. Sherlock waited unsure at the doorway watching John tidying up the bed and pushing the duvet away. Sherlock stepped closer and pulled John in for a kiss. He melted into John and his caresses.
Sherlock grinned. “Somehow, too many people were talking too much about vintage leather jackets, and I don’t believe in coincidences. Also Dimmock's work schedule and his access to information concerning us is highly suggestive. It is the only possible explanation, why Moriarty had knew what he did.”
He hoped that Matt was still well organized, checking his mails daily. He seemed to be very active on the platform. Therefore he was confident. Hopefully he would also remember the pub. But John had no other idea, how to keep the meeting point vague enough without attracting nutcases.
John shifted in his seat. “No, see. It is none of my business. It is just you are so aloof, every time sex comes up.”
Sherlock in return told him how he had underestimated Moriarty's insanity and how he had been forced to jump. He explained how he had made it possible to pull it off, with just the help of Molly, an employee from Madame Tussauds and five people from his homeless network. Between the lines, John realized how tight the margin for error had been. He understood the necessity to keep things away from Mycroft, after it became clear how many people had been involved and how close they had been monitored by Moriarty.
“No, I still have some left,” John answered. Mrs Hudson swatted his hands away and stowed the bills into her pockets.
Greg looked at him with tired eyes. „This is about way more, than you can imagine. I am still scratching at the surface. What I will tell you now, will not be easy to stomach. But it will be all I know so far. Are you willing to listen?”
John winked Stella into the living room. Sherlock stood beside the couch, still looking quite different with ginger hair, a cap and glasses. While they both gained some weight, they were still not back to their old frames. On a whim, John decided to keep one secret. “This is Ian,” he introduced Sherlock to Stella. Sherlock just raised an eyebrow and played along. “Nice to meet you”, he said with a Scottish accent.
The press release of Sherlock's survival was, as expected, a sensation. Therefore they were the headline of every newspaper for three days. The paparazzi camped outside of Baker Street day and night. Greg had visited them once to return John's leather jacket, but he got almost torn to pieces so he swore not to stop by as long as the mob was out there. Thankfully, three days later one of the younger royals had gotten caught stupidly drunk on a party and had taken the spotlight away. News was only good when fresh.
With that, Greg opened the door and vanished along the corridor. John took a deep breath, and looked into the bag. He pulled out the mobile, a non-descriptive key, and some bills and pocketed everything in his jeans. He loaded the gun and tucked it into the waist band at the back of the jeans. The few spare bullets went into the pockets as well. He pulled up the cap of the hoodie and left NSY.
‘It was brilliant, and I could do it again,” Sherlock boasted. “You would make the same mistake again and you would overlook the most important details. Therefore, I would survive the jump -,“ Sherlock paused for effect and lead toward him, “- again.”
In my mind, the Yoga intructer was Lena, from the fan fic Classic The great sex olympics of Baker street by XistentialAngst. In another time line John probably got lucky and got another go with her.
“His jacket?” Moriarty spat viciously. “It was Sebastian's. Don’t you see, it's a vintage. Your pet just took it. He didn't deserve it. But he got what he actually deserved. In fact, I already took care of all of your friends.”
While listening, John’s face shifted from confusion, to disbelief and distress. When the recording turned to the phone conversation between Sherlock and John, Greg stopped the recording. John had gotten deathly pale.
After finishing and stepping through the kitchen into the living room, he steeled himself for some idle chatter. However he was surprised by a running telly, and the food laid out for two on the coffee table. John sat on the couch, opening a bottle of white wine.
Everything had happened so fast. He just had left the hairdresser, when he got a message from Greg to meet at St. Bart’s.  First he had been concerned, when Greg was no longer responding to his replies, but soon he had realized, that he had been baited by Moriarty. He even hadn't even found the time to text Mycroft, but thankfully Molly had appeared.  Now he was back at Baker Street. Moriarty was beaten. He survived being captured and tortured and escaped mostly unharmed. His friends were alive. John was alive. John cared for him. He was for a lack of a better word his boyfriend. Everything was fine. Why was he crying? Some part of him knew that high-stress situations could lead to a mental break down. But he had always assumed to be above that.
Molly knew time was running out. She gathered all her courage and took a small step out of her hiding place, so that Sherlock could spot her. The small movement was enough. If Molly hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have known, that Sherlock had acknowledged her. Sherlock quickly returned his gaze to Moriarty, to not reveal Molly's position.
“No. But you know me, trouble finds me. Mrs Hudson can fill you in. It is a long story. Just keep her safe.” John held a small bundle of bills towards Matt.
The rifle however was custom made. After reassembling he tried some aiming, unfortunately some real shooting would not be possible now. Despite not having been trained as a sniper, he was confident, that if necessary, he could also operate it. He was fascinated by the skill level of the snipers. John's aim wasn't bad, and if he really had wanted he could have trained as a sniper. But he had always seen himself in the medical corps. During his days in the army, when most of the days consisted of waiting, he had sometimes used a sniper rifle on a shooting ranges for fun. A mate of him instructed him sometimes, because it seemed he was a natural talent. And in some way, the concentration on the target relaxed him more than any other sport.
He was hooked now and continued looking through the other files. The text messages confirmed the ownership further: There were some messages from him, but most were from and to John. Sadness overcame Greg after reading those. They spoke of an easy going but deep friendship with lots of dark humour, friendly ribbing and teasing, shopping lists, case information and occasionally outrageous exclamations. Greg knew, he intruded on John's privacy, but he felt compelled, to read them all. The whole NSY including Greg had speculated about the relationship status of John and Sherlock. The jokes and insinuation at their expense sometimes had been very crude and seldom concealed. It seemed, they wronged Sherlock again and denied him something so innocent like true friendship.
John dressed and repacked his backpack diligently. He took out his fake identities. His own was already completely done. For Sherlock he needed to choose a photo out of a portfolio that came with the ID kit. It needed to be as close as possible to Sherlock's appearance. Mycroft hadn't known who he had needed to retrieve, and had therefore given him a wide array of photos to fit into the prepared passport with the name Ian Miller. The biggest problem had been the eye colour on the passport templates and the photos. He had had to choose between blue and brown. The ones that fitted best were a gaunt lad with reddish-brown hair, glasses and blue eyes, and a dark haired guy with brown eyes. The other photos were too different. Either Sherlock had to wear contacts or they had to dye his hair. He was too recognisable after all the press coverage of his suicide, too. Before being able to make a final decision, Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, dressed in a chequered button down shirt, blue jeans and converse shoes.
Sherlock looked at John. This could work. They didn't have a driving licence, but if they don't get stopped by the police, that wouldn't matter. It was a risk they were willing to take. Both nodded at the same time. Plan accepted.
They arrived at Heathrow Airport at 2 pm. John was ecstatic to see London again. Despite the bad weather it felt good to be back. However Sherlock had gotten very still and had stared out of the window during the whole flight.
“Shush, John, everything is okay. You are okay. Tell me, what about Harry?” Sherlock tried to calm him.
“John,” he said, “everything is okay. Stop being worried or ashamed. I want you, too.” To prove his point, Sherlock pressed his hips into John's arousal, John could only groan. The friction was exquisite.
Sherlock also confessed his frustration that he couldn’t have gotten close to John due to the surveillance and how any sign of him being alive would have lead to the pulling of triggers. He also explained why he had had to leave London. If he wanted to win against Moriarty, he had had to find another way to weaken him and his network. Sherlock related how he had been able to convince an old school friend of Mycroft of the conspiracy and to help him. And finally he confessed why and how Irene was still alive. She was now living in Canada. When she had heard that Sherlock was captured, she decided to come back to Europe. She had two reasons for helping Sherlock: First to repay her debts to Sherlock and second, to take revenge on Moriarty. She had parted with Moriarty in bad blood – he just played her and she was furious because of that. The mansion they were currently hiding in belonged to a trusted client of Irene and he would do anything for her.
John huffed out a breath. No rest for the wicked. He gathered his leather jacket – John no longer thought of it as the sniper's jacket - and left for New Scotland Yarc. In his hurry, he overlooked the cab that had just stopped outside of Baker Street and Molly stepping out. He turned at the corner and entered a small alley.  He realized to late that he wasn't alone in the usually abandoned street. Before he could react, he felt the impact of something blunt on his head. Everything went dark and he slumped to the ground.
“I might offend or pressure you. It might not appeal to you. You could feel annoyed or disgusted or...” he started to ramble.
His good mood, Sherlock mused, was a constant companion for some weeks now, but he was acknowledging it just now. He faltered a little bit in his steps as he realized that he felt truly light and unburdened. Things were okay, finally. After years of sorrows, running away, lies and deceit, hurried chases, heartache and sleepless nights he felt hopeful and happy.
After a few moments Sherlock grabbed the bottle of wine. “If it is confession time then I need this, too,” and topped his glass.
He arrived at an Art Nouveau-styled mansion. It was impressive even in the dark. The way to the entrance door was lit and looked welcoming. He looked up and down the street, but there was no doubt that he was at the right place. He stepped up to the entrance door and rang the bell. The modern bell system had been fitted with a camera, John noticed, and he doubted that he could surprise the owner. Nevertheless he kept his hand on the handle of the gun at his back. His other hand clutched the strap of his backpack.
After 10 minutes the church was quiet. There was still light in the registry, but probably the priest was just organizing some things. Mrs. Hudson silently went to the confessional boxes, peeked inside and saw a bag. She slid in, closed the wooden door and did as instructed. The darkness wasn’t really helping, but she found everything she needed.  The clothes were not her style: striped trousers, a linen blouse, a thick woollen cardigan, a scarf and sensible leather shoes. Everything was in muted grey and brow colours. But in matters like these she couldn’t be fussy. She had some crazier adventures with her ex-husband Frank.
After that, John took his time to look through the sniper’s phone. There was almost nothing stored  except the few photos he already found and some mails. He was quite certain, that the name of the Sniper was Sebastian Moran, because one E-Mail was sent to him with that name. It would also fit the engraved initials on the bullets. The name seemed to be familiar, but John couldn’t place it. The e-Mails ordered Sebastion to keep an eye on John and Mrs. Hudson, and were signed by someone named Harry. John took his time to open every app and check their history. He jotted down two ingoing phone numbers in the phone protocol. The only other thing he could find was a downloaded map of the Polish-Czechs Border.
He opened it with caution and slipped inside. He definitely wasn’t the first visitor. The flat was occupied. There were beer bottles and wrappers from sandwiches lying around. Somebody camped here. John pulled out his gun. It was a small apartment with two windows, a tiny kitchenette and an adjacent bathroom. They were equipped with basic food and cleaning supplies. He made sure nobody was hiding. A sleeping bag was in the corner and an old table was in front of the other window. A sniper rifle was mounted above it. I was camouflage painted, and the shoulder stock was adorned with an inlay of a lion. Despite having been a soldier and having a fairly broad knowledge in guns, John didn't recognise the weapon. A box with ammunition was placed beside the rifle. The bullets were engraved with the initials S. M.
Greg rolled his eyes to the ceiling. “I think I don't want to hear anything about it. I will go to bed now. I want to be an upstanding police officer and it is probably better if I can convincingly deny everything.”
Greg opened the next folder, containing the photos from the phone. The time stamps of the photos spanned over one year. He took a deep breath before opening the oldest. It showed a snapshot of a detail he couldn't recognize. He exhaled slowly. He clicked through the photos: Blurry details, licence plates, foot prints, stone and gravel, scratches of surfaces, mud blotches, grass stains, and so on. Greg had the urge to giggle. He couldn't decide if those photos proved it was Sherlock’s phone or not. But what other photos had he expected on the phone. Holiday pictures?
After that, John gave a short account. He told Mycroft about the probably now smelling corpse of the sniper in 218C Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson staying with an old army buddy, the 'stolen' car and the gun in the Spree river in Berlin.
Greg nodded his thanks to Mycroft and said good night. He grabbed his wallet and keys and left the kitchen. The remaining men listened to his retreating steps on the staircase and the closing click of a door.
“By accident I once saw two soldiers blowing each other off. I was disgusted at first, but I stayed and watched. I was fascinated and aroused. Never came so hard in my life.” John shook his head to banish the memory. “I don’t know what I am saying here. I just don’t know any more.” He buried his face into the cushion. How could something so fundamental like attraction mess him up like that? He liked women But why was it so hard to accept, that he reacted similarly to Sherlock? It shouldn't matter. They were alive, it felt good and after everything the press had written about them, he didn't care anymore what people saw in them. They only believed, what they wanted to anyway.
“Can I help? What do you need?” John asked. His voice sounded worried and made Sherlock feel even rawer. Sherlock started to shake more, inconsolable. John embraced him tighter.
John already knew, where his bolt hole was located. Sherlock's cases had taken them all over London. He once had to look up tattoo studios for a case. He still remembered the alley, because he was quite certain, that a studio in such a street couldn’t really make business and needed to close soon. He was wrong. The tattoo studio was still there. Probably it wasn’t just a tattoo shop – or it was just really good and lived on its reputation alone.
Sherlock was stunned at the beginning. He hadn’t expected an emotional reaction from Mycroft. Eventually he returned the embrace.
After countless minutes he heard the shower water starting to warm up the water. Sherlock unfroze, pulled out his phone, dialled their favourite Thai-restaurant and placed an order. It would be delivered within the hour.
She stepped toward Greg and undid his cuffs within seconds. Then she took care of John's. Both men tore the tape from their legs. The floor was already completely covered with water. John rushed to the entrance and tried to open the door. But it was looked as expected.
John spent his Sunday with a lot of tedious tasks. First he cleaned all of the weapons and familiarized himself with them: the gun, the sniper rifle and the Taser. The gun he got from Greg was the same as the illegal firearm he had at home: a SIG Sauer. He cleand it and reloaded the missing bullet. John always felt confident using this model.
A short clip of an earlier recorded press conference was shown. Lestrade was the main speaker. He spoke of the operation and what needed to be done. Then he was answering a reporter's question where he explained how all information on the servers was duplicated earlier to avoid data loss due to intentional tampering. John pitied Lestrade. He looked like death warmed over. He desperately needed sleep. Similar press conferences were held all over Europe. Mycroft was true to his word and had coordinated the downfall of Moriarty's web diligently.
Sherlock first seemed a little bit helpless and overwhelmed. “Umm…” he stuttered and patted Greg’s back awkwardly.
‘No. Not at the moment.’ After hesitating John continued typing. ‘How can we keep in contact? It is quite a hassle to sneak in here. Ideally something, where you already check often, and someone who monitors you won't get suspicious.’
John's eyes widened. Well, he thought, nobody would probably assume some communication from Molly and him at a swinger site. And if she checked in there regularly, it was brilliant. He grinned and nodded.
Greg then told of his success with solving the murder of Nick Henley, the case that had led him to the last month's adventure. Mycroft had told him about Sherlock’s deductions and he had followed up on those. Nick’s boyfriend had come in for a short statement, but Greg let him go without further questions. He deliberately let the trace for the murderer of the sniper go cold. He had no interest in solving that part of the case. In the official files the man would stay an unnamed homeless person with an unknown killer. In fact, they should even thank Nick’s boyfriend, because the act of revenge had made it possible for Lestrade to escape Moriarty’s surveillance and start the chain of events that led to the downfall of Moriarty. This was no news to him, so Sherlock only listened with half an ear.
“That explains something else,” Mycroft said. “The Czech forensic team found DNA and blood traces of you in the cell. I told them to redo the analysis. I thought them to be wrong.” Mycroft looked at Sherlock closer, clearly assessing Sherlock for injuries.
Mycroft fiddled with the shiny black handle of the umbrella. “We always knew Moriarty was big. But this goes beyond anything we had imagined. We are certain, that we have zeroed in on the main players now. But I didn't come to chat. I have a job for you.”
“Okay,” Sally’s voice pulled her back into the present. “Keep following the van until they stop. Then get away to safety. You can leave your phone there if you need to get away so we can track it. Don't try to do anything heroic.”
She silently pushed the door open and peeked through the resulting gap. She couldn't see anything, but voices carried over to her position. She slid through the door and closed it silently.
Sherlock creased his forehead in concentration and inspected the second photo more thoroughly. A naked body, in a foetal position with mud and blood all over was depicted. His features softened as he connected the clues. “When I got rescued, my rescuer dropped something beside me. They probably killed Musgrave beforehand, undressed him and left him as a decoy. He could have passed as my twin, if somebody had checked on me.”
Molly stilled her phone and redialled Sally. Only the voicemail answered. While it rattled down Sally’s greeting, she quickly formed a plan. She left a short message, slipped out of the car, and threw her mobile down the road as far as she could. She hoped Sally would understand the hint. She ran back to the cabbie. “Follow the van again,” she instructed the cabbie.
“I made sure that nobody would take closer look at you at the airports,” Mycroft explained. “Well, it doesn't matter anymore,” he pushed the blade back into the umbrella. “Back to the snipers - I think the danger here has passed.” He turned to Sherlock. “The three photographs on your mobile were the snipers put on John, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson?”
While one man started to assume, that his friend might not be dead, another man, in a dark cell, bound for 30 hours without food or water had lost all hope. His most desperate wish was to turn back time. He wanted to have again the opportunity to jump, but for real this time. This way the order to kill his friends would never be spoken, and they could still be alive.
Like the previous day they fell asleep side by side. They slept well into the next day. While yesterday, John slept like a log, he was now more restless. Nightmares intruded his rest. The suppressed grief, fury and anxiousness from the last two months caught up with him. John awoke around ten in the morning. During the night, they had drifted together again, bodies aligned and tangled together, Sherlock snuggled into his side. Warm puffs of breaths landed on his shoulder. The tension from the previous night drained out of him and he just felt peaceful. He enjoyed the rest for endless minutes till his stomach rumbled hungrily.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled John closer. “Don't coddle me. As I told you, I am no blushing virgin. I know what I want, and with whom.”
Seconds later, a loud bang from the roof entrance startled them. Six officers in full armor stormed in and surrounded them. One of them stepped closer and took in the scene. He grabbed his radio set. “Stand down, situation is under control,” he roared into the mouthpiece. He went to Sherlock and gestured him to step away from Moriary. The officer grabbed Moriarty at his neck and pulled him up. A bag was pulled over his head. At gun point, Moriarty was dragged by five officers from the roof down the stairs. The leader remained, giving and receiving orders to and from his head piece.
“Well. It was quite memorable, when you all made a vow in speedos over some vodka to protect each other. Generally forgetting is hard for me,” Sherlock said.
“Well, then I propose a thorough snogging session with a lot of groping, if you are amenable. Nothing crazy. And then we will see, what comes up.”
Stella picked them up as promised and drove them to the Berlin airport. She accompanied them to the gate and almost in the plane. The business class tickets gave them the additional advantage of not having to wait unnecessarily in line. At the airports in Berlin and London nobody was interested in them and they were waved through all security checks with barely any consideration for their bags or passports. No one even batted an eye at the ugly umbrella, John held clutched in his hand.
“Dr Watson,” Mycroft started, “as far as I remember, you are a quite decent marksman. Do you know how to operate a sniper rifle?”
John took a deep breath and released it. “Before my injury in Afghanistan, I was very,” John halted, searching for a good word, “open with sex. I had a lot of casual relationships and very few serious ones. It was a lot of fun and I loved it. But part of the lifestyle I lived wasn’t exactly healthy. Some of the things I did could have injured me or even damaged my career. And perhaps some things I did just to spite my father and his conservative world view. With the injury of my shoulder and the pain in my leg, I somehow fell into a depression. It felt like a punishment for the things I did, the lifestyle I led. And I probably never really recovered till the last few months. I realized lately that intimacy and sex are important to me. But I made some rules to keep healthy and sane. For example: one partner at a time, with a clear understanding of what everyone expects; no dangerous situations that could lead to injury or deseases; and if possible: I try to keep away from toxic partners like cheaters, addicts or people with extreme kinks.”
Finally, the first part of the talking :-) Still no beta, errors are all mine. Comments and Kudos are appreciated.
“I don’t know,” Molly answered. So far, she hadn’t thought about that option. She had tried to block any thoughts about Moriarty after the horrible dating episode. So far, she hadn’t met him again.
Sherlock stepped toward the mirror over the fireplace. After taking stock of his appearance, he shrugged off his gown, dashed into his bedroom again and returned in a suit jacket.
Mycroft and Sherlock stilled. They looked into each other’s eyes. Mycroft lifted one eyebrow. “It could work,” he said after a moment of silence.
The moment was lsot and they stood up to start their day. They took turns in the bathroom and prepared breakfast. It was almost noon, and both decided on coffee, eggs and bacon with additional slices of bread and sausages.
“Someone wants us dead,” John continued. “I need you to take care of her, till I’ll sort out this mess. Can I count on you?”
John scratched his eyebrow. “Okay, perhaps I need to be cruder. Before we met, I was, for lack of a better word, a slag. I don't want to get there again. Regular sex: yes. Danger: no. I am lucky that I don't have any STIs or any scars from some of the stuff I did. And furthermore, I don't want to shove that aspect of my life onto you. You are not into sex, and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.”
He unlocked his new phone and scrolled through the content. One number was saved under L – Lestrade obviously. A memo gave the address of his bolt hole. There was also a downloaded map of London with highlighted areas of heavy surveillance - probably a courtesy of Mycroft. If he avoided the tourist attractions and public buildings especially banks, he could keep off the radar. So back alleys and a baseball cap would be good options. If this goes on longer, he decided to grow a beard, just to change his appearances more.
“Let me help you with that, I am quite a good hairdresser,” Kate offered, beaming at her wife. With that, the whole house prepared for departure: Suitcases were packed, travel routes discussed and passports finalized.
John stilled. Cases were connected to Sherlock, and he didn’t know if he was up to it. But on the other hand, he always wanted to set Sherlock legacy straight, and if he could contribute to that, he would go to NSY. He answered that he would stop by within the next hour. Sleep was not so important after all. The nightmares could wait.
John had finished his shower and pulled on his bathrobe. He re-entered the living room and stopped as soon as he spotted Sherlock on the sofa. He quickly strode toward him and lowered himself beside him. He put his arm gently around Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Shh, you will have me. I'll take care of you. I promise.” John made Sherlock settle back into the cushions. He turned toward the drawer of the bedside table. Unsurprisingly there were a bottle of lube and some condoms stashed. Again proof that privacy with Mycroft was an illusion. He threw his findings on the bed sheet and his eyes focussed again on Sherlock.
John felt paralysed. He heard the blood rushing in his ears. He was afraid that if he moved, the moment would shatter and he would realise that his mind was simply playing tricks on him. John lost his grip on his backpack and it thumped on the ground. He took a few steadying breaths and some tentative steps toward the bed. Tears gathered in John’s eyes and laughter bubbled up in him.
John didn’t struggle to move from his position any more. He just applied pressure to the man’s wrist, to be able to keep breathing shallowly. The sniper still used his other hand to punch John into the face or stomach. More blood came pouring out of the wound and trickled onto John and his hoodie. The sniper was losing strength by the second. The eyes, moments ago still clear got unfocussed and the grip loosened finally. John rolled the sniper beneath him. As soon, as he straddled him, he could feel him going limp, eyes staring unfocussed ahead. A last breath escaped his lungs. John fumbled for the pulse on the neck. I was fading away.
“I'm going to the hairdresser,” he announced. He donned his coat and scarf, bent down to give John a short kiss on the lips and dashed out of the front door.
If he was lucky, the clinic had already wired his last earnings to his account. Best case: he was just broke. Worst case: he had debts with horrendous interest rates.
Last weekend, he had hit an all-time low, wanting to end everything. He didn't want to think about that either. He hadn't stopped working since then, except for short naps or awful snacks. The inflow of patients on the A & E was at an all-time high, and every available doctor was pulled in. It somehow felt like war again. Therefore he was exhausted, emotionally and physically drained. On the other hand, the additional money was welcome. Just tedious locum work would not help to cover the rent on the flat long-term. But his money running out was a problem for another time.
Molly arrived at Baker Street after her shift at St. Bart’s. She had collected so much overtime that she decided to splurge some of it to visit John and Sherlock. They had called her yesterday and told her about their homecoming. She was relieved that everything had worked out: Sherlock was back and Moriarty’s web was destroyed. The game was over.
Sherlock had not been declared alive again yet, but a press release was scheduled in three days. In the evening they would also be reunited with Mrs. Hudson again. Matt, John’s army mate, had her hidden away at his aunt's in Plymouth. It had turned out to be more of a vacation for Mrs Hudson. She had spent her time with Marjorie in a little cottage, drinking tea, taking the dogs for a walk and baking cakes for the local nursing home. The evenings had been filled with Doctor Who DVDs and EastEnders.
He rifled through the content. The phone didn't have additional security. He saw some photos of Mrs. Hudson and him. The landscapes and pictures of children were not relevant at the moment. He would look at them at a later date. The mails on the phone were signed with S. Moran. The e-mails were few, but they proved that the sniper was hired to shadow him and at a later date to shadow Mrs. Hudson, too. One sniper had been retracted to do business in Eastern Europe. He put the phone on flight mode, to avoid detection. It had to stay on and powered, otherwise he would need to unlock the SIM-Card with a code. Maybe he would need the phone later.
John returned the smile. “Never been better.” And it was true. He was deeply relaxed. His mind was quiet. The lingering anxiety regarding his sexuality was gone. He was sticky, boneless and mellow and it felt good.
The prince stepped further on the balcony toward the handrail, put a cigarette into his mouth and flicked open his lighter. He lit it and grinned at Anthea. Even with the distance separating them, John could see that the prince had some very lewd thoughts about what he wanted to do to her later. The prince took a deep pull and then turned back to look over the city beneath him.
With every word, that Molly typed, John felt how the iron fist, that had clamped around his heart loosened. Molly's text got blurred. Tears formed in his eyes. For moments he struggled to keep silent. He fought to keep his breathing even and flat. His hands clenched and unclenched.
“Hi Sebastian, please take care of your charges, and inform your buddy Frank, too…,” the voice died away, as his captor left the building.
Sherlock rushed his showering a little bit, due to one part being hungry, and the other being curious about John's new girlfriend. While he already hated her, he still wanted to know more about John's new conquest. It was foolish to think, John would give up dating forever.
Below the table was an opened trunk for the rifle. A box with gun maintenance supplies and a Taser were stowed there, too.
"May I congratulate you, Detective Inspector? You successfully disappeared from the grid. And this is the reason, why we are now able to meet,” Mycroft smiled. "We have a lot to discuss."
Sherlock gave Mycroft a brief summary of his time gathering the data about Moriarty's network and a shorter summary of his capture. He skipped the part where Irene rescued him; Mycroft clearly noticed the gap but didn't comment on it.
Mycroft joined them some minutes later. His basic surveillance of the police radio channels for the name 'Moriarty' had directed Molly’s call from the cab to his team. He had set up a police squad as fast as possible. He had just been signed an order to confine Moriarty in a safe location. Then he had hurried to the hospital, too.
Greg nodded. ”It is genuine. Mycroft confirmed it, too. They knew, Moriarty planned something, but they never thought he would be this crazy. And it doesn’t stop here. Sherlock’s jump was just a start signal for many operations around Europe. Moriarty is orchestrating everything.”
Mycroft took a deep breath. "I know that you listened to the recording of Sherlock and Moriarty on the roof of St. Bart’s. I have seen you pull the files from the server. And therefore you are aware of the three snipers.  But you don't know about the vast network behind that. Moriarty installed a web with heads in five major European cities. They are specialized on all kinds of crime: kidnapping, blackmail, human trafficking, money laundry, you name it. The government officials that are not part of it are aware of the network. But some of Moriarty's men hold key positions and therefore make us impotent against their doings, until now. You managed to get off the grid. The sniper put on you died an unfortunate death, and he wasn't replaced. Perhaps the news doesn’t travel that fast, or Moriarty got sloppy. Good for us: now, we can get you to ask the right questions from official sides. I know you are well connected. With backup from unofficial units and my connections, we stand a chance against Moriarty’s infiltration. With your help, we could take the pressure from the higher ups and let the broad base of NSY do its job: strength in numbers. You already did the first step, but you won't come far without my help. My brother held you in high regard. And I hope you will support me."
Molly also wanted to return the Taser to John. She had been startled when a woman in ragged clothes had approached her in front of the hospital and had given her a badly wrapped package almost two weeks ago. John had told her via a message in the forum, that she would receive a package, but he hadn’t specified how. She had been grateful, that he wanted her to have a mode of protection but she wasn't really comfortable with carrying a weapon. And now with everything over, she had no need for it any more.
After some minutes John and Sherlock trotted to the bathroom for a quick shower. It lasted longer than expected, because showering together had its own perks. They had nothing to do, so they just cuddled on the bed naked afterwards. When they heard Greg entering the mansion, they redressed and joined him for dinner.
“I have a better idea,” Kate spoke up. “Take the car in the garage, the Škoda. It is unremarkable. Leave it somewhere in Berlin, best in a restricted parking zone. It will get towed and the owner will get informed. Theft happens all the time around here, so no one will be any the wiser of how you travel.”
John’s eyes widened. He hadn’t thought about that. It sounded reasonable, in fact it was the only thing that made sense. Why put a Sniper on them, if Sherlock was dead? There was no logic in that. But on the other hand, if Sherlock was alive, why were they still alive? Could there be more to it? Hope bloomed in John’s chest.
Dimmock looked up from his desk. His face fell in understanding. In a second he turned in his office chair, jumped up and sprinted for the fire exit.
Sherlock drew in a bored breath. “It could be the bounty on Moran's head; or the thank you from some Arab Sheiks for solving their family problem; or the payment from Mycroft for retrieving me. Who cares? Just Mycroft's meddling.” He turned on the sofa to stare at its back pillows.
Upon John entering, Mycroft looked up and smiled tiredly at him. When his eyes fell on the person behind him, Sherlock, he visibly paled. Despite Sherlock being still thin, red-haired, and with glasses, there was no doubt to Mycroft about his identity. Sherlock locked eyes with his brother and stilled in the entry.
John sat up and leaned over to reach across the bed and retrieve a small tube. He poured some on his hand and warmed it a little bit. He draw near Sherlock again and grasped both their erections in his hand. Sherlock let out a groan and pushed into the hand out of reflex. The friction was delicious. John locked eyes with Sherlock. Both found an easy rhythm relishing the sliding of their bodies against each other, joined at the hip by a hand. Small whimpers soon turned into gaps and groans. John changed the rhythm of his hand randomly, denying them a fast orgasm. Sherlock felt like going insane, clutching at Johns arm and back. The intimacy and the feeling of rightness was overwhelming them soon enough. They peaked into a satisfying orgasm and slumped against each other.
Around midnight, they went to bed. Mycroft went upstairs to the master bedroom. His steps were heavy and communicated the fatigue of the originator.
Sherlock swayed and slumped down on his knees. Molly stepped closer to catch his fall. Everything was okay. They had won. The game was finally over.
John looked confused. Mycroft picked up his umbrella, turned the handle, and pulled out a 20 inch blade.
“That's one of my other problems solved,” Mycroft said relieved. “I had Moran on my to-do list for a long time. He had made my work and that of many other governments very difficult.”
After Anne left - no sleep-overs, no good-bye kisses by the door per mutual agreement - John grabbed some change of clothes and wandered down to the bathroom, unconcerned about his nudity. Spotting the bag with take away, still lukewarm, he knew instantly that Sherlock was back. Somehow he felt guilty, like having an illicit affair. He shook his head – first things first: shower and getting dressed. He snuck into the bathroom and started the shower.
