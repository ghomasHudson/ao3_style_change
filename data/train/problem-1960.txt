Mycroft looked at Sherlock and said with a firmness in his voice, “Enter, Sherlock. I will restrain you, but not in the position with too much tension on your shoulders. Not for too long.....and I choose the crop instead of the cane. You asked for submission. So I'm in charge and I decide. Let go Sherlock. I've got you...”
If this book is going to survive out into the future, I have attached micro-films, with a lot of evidence about Baskerville, my role in the investigations there and pictures of Sherlock Holmes and Khan. The photos of Khan are a bit blurred as they are from the media. I've attached microfilm containing my DNA-chart and those of Sherlock, Mycroft and Eurus' Holmes. Maybe some scientists out in the future can use them. And if there should still be remnants of those Baskerville-like facilities left out in the future, I've gathered as much evidence as possible against them. I have this naïve hope that what they did can't even be legal in the future and maybe I can give a small contribution to their down-fall. And maybe make a little attempt of making amends like that.
He opened his eyes and looking at John, Mycroft added, “I admit that I like Captain Watson too. He makes me want to submit.”
“I love yours too” was the answer.
Now Sherlock was giggling a bit as he pointed at the items on the bed, “That the only thing men wear under a kilt is 'Scotland’s future'. That they ‘go commando’ under it...not that I would mind.”
John just nodded and Mycroft continued, “And then you realised how much responsibility so much power asked of you?”
“Give me a push, will you? If I fall asleep..”, said John.
Mycroft smirked and arched his eyebrow, “Are you really asking me to sort of..... bend the law...in your and Sherlock's favour?”
And then he stopped talking and Mycroft said, “He is still drugged. I'll keep an eye on him. And if you can forgive me, then you can forgive John as well. All of us.....if you can't, it is understandable. But you must give him time...”
The small whimpers and moans that Sherlock uttered made John achingly hard himself and he wondered if he could come from that alone himself as he continued to lick and kiss and actually fuck Sherlock with his tongue.
Sherlock had moved to one of the cupboards that separated the living room from the kitchen and John wondered for a brief moment how those cupboards could have survived the explosion and now Sherlock returned with a glass of whisky in each hand.
And the 12th of August – precisely 8 months after Sherlock had said what he thought to be his final farewell to John and had left England and anticipated that he would have been dead for two months at this date in August -  if not before – John was standing at the same airstrip on the tarmac and watching as the plane landed. He smiled as he saw Sherlock descending the stairs and then Sherlock sat his feet on British ground after having left for Eastern Europe the 28th of February, nearly 6 months ago.
“Let's go and talk to him. Maybe I can persuade him not to die for me...again...but to
John could hear that Sherlock took a deep breath and said, “Tomorrow....that is if you would still allow me to do that after I've confessed this, ...tomorrow, when I put the pen to the paper that would make me into Rosie's father......she will not be the first child that I'm the father of!”
“And that is why you should consider visiting that sex-shop. Like that you can relieve some of the stress, before you get desperate. You know by now, what would work....and that without damage. Just take care, right?”
“Curved plugs or curved dildos so they would hit and stimulate both the prostate and the perineum and the balls at the same time and devises with electrical stimulation...”, explained John and as Sherlock tensed a bit John understood immediately and hurried to explain, “Oh God Sherlock, nothing like that! Just gentle...Oh God I would never use anything on you that would even remind the sightliest to torture instruments. Sorry!”
“Whoa...Sherlock. Easy.....be careful....”
And then Sherlock paused, sighed and said, “....drugs. Carefully measured. But at 5 occasions, I used far too much. I admit, that I, at those 5 occasions, was emotionally compromised and therefore not in control. It was at university after Sebastian and after Victor...I'm going to tell you more about that later. Then again after that event in France that caused me to miss my final exams. Then a long pause, where you and I were together and.....and then after I returned and you rejected me. That episode wasn't that bad...and I came to my senses myself. Then you got married and I became 'Shezza' again for a few days. And then again after...after Mary died. This time I didn't care if I lived or died...and yet. In the moment Culverton almost succeeded in choking me, I wanted to live after all. Despite that I did use more than I initially had expected myself. You could compare it to when people drink two to five glasses of red wine too much. My drug-use...except from those 5 occasions, can be compared to people drinking a glass of wine. That doesn't make you an alcoholic. It was totally unnecessary the two times Mycroft had me sent to a rehabilitation-centre. But I accepted it, because such places were just what my mind needed: peace and quiet and regular meals and time for me to meditate. The doctors were always amazed how quickly I recovered.....but that was because I wasn't an addict.”
“I can. By why don't you ask him yourself?”, wanted Ella to know.
“You began with a child-size one as you turned 3...after...the incident...” Mycroft paused and took a deep breath, “That summer, were you were still only 2 and a half, we were staying by some relatives. Uncle Rudy, Aunt Marilyn and their children Sherrinford, who was 2 years my senior, and Marjorie, who was about 5, just like Eurus. Uncle Rudy and aunt Marilyn had this house, similar to Musgrave Hall and with those false gravestones. They were uncle Rudy's ideas of a joke. I never understood the joke, though. That house was close to the sea. And that day we were all at the beach. The weather was nice and you had been placed on a plaid, guarded by uncle Rudy's Irish Setter. She had fallen in love with you and refused totally to leave your side.
“The hospital...I would like to see my sons!”
Now Sherlock’s eyes were sparkling, “And you being a military man....what would you wear under the kilt?”
John nodded, “The 'explosion'...I see. Leaving the flat unharmed. Even the rug. And in reality we didn't jump anywhere. Just slumped down on the floor.”
“Oh yes..”, said Mycroft as he sat down, after he had, as the true gentleman he was, tugged at the legs of his trousers to avoid ruining them, “....since it is unlikely that I would marry, again, and Eurus...well not her either, then I think that my parents, and of course I too, would be more than happy to arrange the wedding. We are squires after all. And the estate...”
And John had to admit....he had always found it a bit peculiar that Sherlock could be that strong without having to exercise a lot.
“You might have to. He thinks that he knows, that he can never be what you need. For God's sake John. Sherlock is asexual. The mere thought of sex makes him almost vomit...and no wonder!”
John shouted after him: “At least you could tell me from time to time, if Sherlock still is alive?”
It seemed as if Mary finally understood and then she whispered, crying: “I told them that they could use Mina as a donor. At least it would give some sense......”
Mycroft pointed at the letter, “That is why I, the second time I spoke with her, suggested to pay for their school, or getting them on an even better school and later pay for their higher education, and she agreed. Maybe because I was totally honest with her and said, that if you at a point would decide that it would be easier to live with her, to re-marry her, I would accept that. I told her that I would do anything to make you happy, Greg. And then she had looked at me and said that that was the reason why I would be a better spouse, than she would ever be....and then she accepted that I...we....would pay for Sophia's and Elisabeth's education. And that was the reason why she accepted, that they should be given the possibility of choosing schools, that could suit their talents even better. So yes, this is the piece of paper that, with your former wife's signature, has promoted me to their legal guardian if anything should happen to her. It is not adoption, but very close and yes...it is her signature that gives us permission to choose other schools for Sophia and Elisabeth.”
And John went out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.
“And then what.....what happened?”
Mycroft smiled, “...'Culture'. Well not that much. It is after all easier for them to be Christian here. I know there are more than 28 million Christians in India, but it was not easy for them and their family, especially since there were not many Christian people in their part of the city and the animosity of the uncle was based on the fact that they were not following the Hindu religion. And 'language'? Both Rohan and Eshan are fluent in English, as they are in many of the languages spoken in India: Bengali, Odia, Punjabi, just to mention a few. Then they speak Iranian, French and German and many more. All in all more than 20 languages. They've picked them up from the other children and the foreign workers at the foster home and wherever they found someone, who spoke another language. So...no language will not be a barrier. And it easier to be handicapped here in England after all. Look at Leuris....she/he is not handicapped, but just happens to have a prosthetic foot.”
Sherlock paused, and looked at Sherrinford, Eurus and Mycroft, “The most pressing question is now. Which of you killed Carl Powers?”
Mycroft nodded....relieved.
Each time mentioning a thing from his list - and ordering Sherlock to count. Sherlock was a bit surprised that it after the first ten lashes didn’t hurt more. It was a sharp pain - every lash - but it quickly turned into a dull throbbing.....and he obediently counted as John had ordered. At no 50 he had been swaying a bit....the pain....he had somehow got used to it but he could feel his body weakening.
And John used the riding-crop on Sherlock's thighs and upper back. Sherlock's arse was 'decorated' nicely enough and didn't need more. The riding-crop did only leave red marks, as John was careful not to hit too hard. He had plans for other bodily sensations and the 6 welts on Sherlock's arse would throb and hurt for days. And bruise.
for me instead? I need you!” And John took Sherlock's hand a gave it a squeeze.
Sherlock closed his eyes and pushed the papers and journal away, further down on the duvet that covered his legs.
“You are, Sherlock. Model-material. Haven't you noticed that people can't take there eyes away from you? That you can achieve almost everything if you turn up your charm? Getting into the flat in the case of 'The Blind Banker '. Do you remember? And Janine?”
As John got that message Mycroft saw the soldier, the killer.... that John was as well. He rose and said: “Where is the operating theatre? If necessary I’ll kill her myself!”
”. The tale of the hired actress and the bomb in Baker Street that was no bomb and the island, that was no island is going to be told. And...John....I can tell you the 'how' and only some of the 'why'. The rest is something you'll have to talk with Mycroft about. OK?”
step, he could hear Sherlock's voice through the open door, “I'm in the living room, please come in, John.”
John slipped out of his role and touched Sherlock carefully. He had noticed that Sherlock slurred a bit...and knew enough about “subspace” to realise that Sherlock probably was on his way into it.
John looked around: “If everybody is ready?” and they all held hands as the light around them grew stronger....
This time Sherlock didn't leave the party early.....and yet. At a point, before the midnight snack, the guests sort of forced both John and Sherlock and Mycroft and Greg to leave by saying, “For God's sake. Leave! You can hardly look away from each other. Leave!”
“Yeah...I know. You told her...”, said Sherlock.
“That doesn’t mean that you can't be careful and have tracking devises on and in you and that we can't have a SWAT-team standing by.” was John's reply.
Sherlock sighed, “Brother and sister. She should have learned from his history. But I believe that 'Mary' did tempt with a rather large sum of money....”
John woke up with a jolt. Where did those very inappropriate thoughts about a naked Sherlock come from? And then he realized that the half-erection he had got dreaming of Mary’s naked body had turned into a very hard and almost painful erection that his trousers barely could contain.....and he had never seen Sherlock totally naked! In a sheet without pants and then almost “no sheet” at Buckingham Palace! Spotting a very delicate outline of a surprisingly muscular and plump arse! And as John had tended to different wounds on Sherlock’s body over the years. Last time as he often came around to keep Sherlock company when he recovered after Mary had shot him. He didn’t even know what Sherlock’s cock looked like! And with that thought John finally....and much too late....... admitted that he loved Sherlock, was interested in more than a platonic friendship with him and that he indeed at least “was gay for Sherlock”.
Hamish smiled, “I wonder if they had the same conversation when Vesuvius started rumbling?”
The car had stopped and then they were carried down into a cellar-room in a apparently big house. And dumped down on a mattress. And left. They could hear the men stomp up the stairs and close and lock the door.
Mycroft smiled a bit, “After the fall form the rooftop at Bart's Molly was very valuable in keeping it as a secret that Sherlock had survived. And please remember, John, that that secrecy was vital for Magnussen's allowance for you staying alive...”
“If lives can be exchanged...can't I.... I mean, I can't say that I wanted to die in Afghanistan and never meet Sherlock, because then I would take Rosie’s life away. But...the rest of my life. From now on. Can't I give that back to Sherlock, so he can live?”
That had caused them to finish each other off in back alleys and on toilets a few times after having left crime-scenes, because they couldn't wait to get their hands and other body-parts on and in each other.. and frankly John couldn't bother if Mycroft could watch them on his hidden cameras. In fact the very idea of that was rather arousing.
Sherlock scanned John's face and said slowly, “You actually think about how my brother look without clothes on.......and...”
And Mycroft called some experts and they very carefully removed the wrapped parcel from John’s bag.
Mycroft smiled back, “Yeah..I did beat you, didn’t I.”
At least she wasn’t on a respirator as she could breathe on her own and had only a tube with extra oxygen in her nose and as she saw John she began to cry: “I’m  sorry....I’m so sorry....” and John sat next to her and began to stroke her right hand. The only part of her that were not hooked up on machinery or IV. He had a short flashback of the several times where he had been sitting in similar situations with Sherlock in a hospital- bed and he realized with a peculiar sadness that he would have been more upset if it had been Sherlock in that bed....... It was so complicated.
“Get your arms around me. I want to feel you.”, ordered John and began to trust into Sherlock again. Hard, powerful trusts that did hit Sherlock's prostate every time and John enjoyed how Sherlock had been taken apart. Sherlock's face was pink and his neck and chest had the same colour. His hair was a mess and he looked like a fallen angel.
Sherlock swallowed and closed his eyes, “Not that I’d say no to that, but I’m afraid it’s not enough.”
“Well, it is not easy to be at your peak of intelligence when you are watching your best and dearest friend apparently killing himself and then in reality just disappear out of your life for two bloody years, without a word. Don’t tell me that Moriarty had snipers pointed at us for two years!!!!! Just a word Sherlock. You were in contact with Mycroft....just a word!!!!!”
Mycroft smiled, “And that was clearly a mistake, that I have rectified. Bill Murray is attending as well. And a lot of your old colleagues from Helmand and Kandahar. Of course you should be there for their 20
It began with an investigation of my own genome. I found unusual traits and decided to investigate my father's and my uncles genome too. I took blood-samples without asking. It wasn't difficult as Sherlock still performed experiments and had discipline enough to label his test-tubes. I found even more unusual genome traits in both Sherlock's and Mycroft's genome and I had the luck to get my hands on some of Eurus' too. The genomes had mostly altered versions regarding the immune system, healing abilities, muscle strength and intelligence. Not that unusual that they couldn't be found in other humans, but not all of them congregated in one...or rather three persons. Most prominent in my biological father. But scientist didn't know how to pamper with genes then, in the 70's, did they?
Now Sherlock was back in the living room already dressed in his trousers and a crisp white shirt...looking stunning: “Of course we do...Mycroft does. It is only blurred IR footage. Seldom sounds...most of the time it is turned down....and only Mycroft and one more minion are allowed to watch! Oh my God John...it is not public!”
And Sherlock obeyed. Crawled over the back of the sofa and positioned himself as John had ordered.
“No wonder, they thought me to be 'an idiot'....or just 'not a genius'. I saw no reason to tell them that I could read and understand just as many languages as Eurus. That I totally understood the math she and Mycroft were solving. Why should I? Then I would have to study with her and Mycroft....and it was so much more fun to study bees and play pirate. There was this boy. From the village near by. He was just as obsessed as I with pirates, so we used to play together. Mycroft 'turned' that boy, Martin, into 'Victor Trevor' and 'drowned' him in the well. But none of it happened for real. When I tell you about what really happened, you will see the...'narrative' purpose. And Mycroft had disturbed memories too. We really had a dog, but Eurus didn't drown him in a well. 'Redbeard' just got ill and he was taken away. Father drove him to the vet and the dog was put down. I don't know why Mycroft could forget that very real dog. The explanation could be that Mycroft was traumatized by those events too, so he...to survive...had to delete something and did delete a bit too much.”
“The pain and the submission!”
The two men didn't say anything for a few moments, sipping to their cognac and then John spoke, “Well...who would have thought that the global warming would be so severe!”
And then they saw how John took on his doctor and soldier personality....and his captain personality, as he began to examine Mycroft's foot and the tourniquet, “You do realise that you will loose your lower leg and foot, Mycroft?”, he said.
Mycroft at least had the decency to blush a bit and he hurried to explain, “We...I...only make sure that it is just you two.....three when Rosie is home...that are in the flat. After that I can assure you that the cameras and the sound are turned down.”
Sherlock tapped absent-mindedly at the screen of his new phone as he answered, “Culverton Smith had made sure that my brother would be framed for a lot of Culverton's crimes. So as Mycroft survived, he was brought to a secret governmental hospital, where he is in custody right now and might face a trial later. Of course this material I have here, including some of Culverton's notes and diaries.....and yes, Jacqui found some of them too, they would clear Mycroft of almost every accusation. But is it enough? Wouldn’t it be easier to let such a man disappear than admitting that you have been controlled through him, by an indecent, manipulative and presumably crazy little ugly man?”
And he didn't even know what he begged for and then he felt how she stretched him even more as the butt-plug was pushed inside.....and now he understood the purpose of the twisting and turning top. It would massage his prostate. He opened his eyes and saw the moisture dripping out of him.....she was milking him!
John looked up and squinted, “What the hell do you know about Harry?” And then he understood, “Oh you...you meddler. You was the one who paid for her rehab! I wondered who had paid for that...or how she could have gotten herself into that expensive rehab-centre. I would have paid as soon as I had the money...but Harriet was already there. Thank you, Mycroft, despite your meddling.”
Rosie was at her boarding-school and Sherlock and John expected to be back in London within a few days. Nothing more than a week the most. Greg stayed in London and Sherlock and Mycroft had left London, heading towards Sofia in Bulgaria. Not as 'Mycroft Holmes' and 'Sherlock Holmes'. But as 'Joseph Vernet' and 'William Scott', the prime-minister's secretary and the foreign-ministers secretary. Of course with the knowledge and blessing from the prime-minister and the foreign-minister. And with 'real' papers and back-ground stories, that could manage a closer inspection.
And John just smiled. Of course Sherlock had known about that ship.
Greg found the cane in the wardrobe and went over to the bed. He could see that Mycroft had partly surrendered and that he tried to be patient, but the nervous energy was still present.
“Only because he has allowed it.....believe me. He is incredible strong...has always been. As a child doctors even wanted to investigate why he was that strong. It is not to be seen on him.....when he has lost weight he is almost lean.....meagre.....but it is all muscles!”
“No! But sit down on the bed. We’ll have to talk...about what we need for now and want to do.....I do not want to overstep some lines right now... That idiot who left those scars on your buttocks must have done that.....maybe in the heat of the arousal....but the scars are not of the same age so: first time is an accident, 2nd time is coincidence, but 3rd time is a pattern. And I most certainly don’t want to add more!”
She made a gesture around in the room and towards him, “And this?”
And those words made Mycroft laugh and despite his sore nipples and that butt-plug stretching his arse, he was now a bit longer away from the threatening orgasm and he smiled at her.
“We've all let Sherlock down....but without that Herculean effort of his....”
John closed his eyes and enjoyed the feelings, but he soon decided to open his eyes to enjoy the sight too....and it almost made him come on the spot: to see Sherlock’s curly head bobbing up and down, to hear his satisfied hum as he deep-throated John’s cock...so deep that he had his nose buried in John’s pubic hair at some point.....the feeling of Sherlock’s throat around his cock.....didn’t Sherlock have a gag-reflex at all?...John grappled after Sherlock’s hair......not to pull it but to warn him that he was close......John could only stutter: “Sherlock...I....I.....”and then he saw stars and the strange floating feeling that followed as an orgasm starts followed and did build up...and up and he came in the best orgasm he had had for years.
..” and "
John frowned, “But if I'm so 'dark', why are you not worried about my relationship with Sherlock?”
John nodded, “What happened to Rudy and Marilyn and ...was the name Augustin?”
But yet again: if they had been those persons that their abductors had thought them to be, or even those secretaries, then they wouldn't have the skill-set that could help them now.
Then he looked at Rohan with his warm brown eyes and smiled, “You don't have to pretend. Just call him 'Mycroft' or Papa...and I'll be happy to call you my son as well! I suppose that my husband has already made sure that the adoptions-papers are ready to be signed.”
So yes Sherlock, I do know about it. Even more so because while I was studying at Bart's, I've aided a colleague, who was working in those mentioned clubs. We went there if something had been a bit rougher than intended. But in the beginning I couldn't understand, why people could enjoy that. I've been beaten by my father a bit to much to understand how pain and submission could be something, that people could want. But the people there in the clubs taught me otherwise. Not that I ever saw sessions, but I spoke with people. So yes. I do understand that the submission is a gift and should be treated accordingly. And that is were I'm a bit concerned, Sherlock. The doctor in me is screaming: welts and bruises and wounds are tissue-damage, whatever you call it. It is blood-vessels being crushed, cells destroyed, scar-tissue being formed...”
Mycroft smirked, “That was what I saw..”
John had that feeling too. Could Mycroft had planned something that false and big, just to have an excuse to use government-money to free Sherlock from Baron Maupertuis' dungeons?
John nodded again and said, “And then finally you tried to...not not 'cure' her, because it couldn't be done, but...”
John told about his father’s uncle, who indeed had been a Scottish Watson, so John was totally entitled to wear the Watson tartan.
“I saw the cuddly doctor and forgot the soldier.”, as she admitted.
John found that he actually liked the angel and he smiled back, “Yeah...something like that. Maybe I just hoped that all the insane trouble down here on Earth somehow would have been solved...”
And John didn't mind a begging detective either.
The first two days of the meeting had gone smoothly and Sherlock had observed and noticed and he and Mycroft had discussed and talked and written clues down. But it was still just vague outlines. Nothing substantial. Not until the third day.
“No, But the cleaning is very profound. Your Stradivarius has been sent to a specialist and all your belongings are being replaced if the cleaners can track the drug and the items can't be cleaned.. That means that John's chair has to go and strangely enough both your coffee-table and your dining-table. Your chair and the couch can be cleaned and....I'm sorry Sherlock, but do you remember Umberto Eco's “The name of the Rose”?”
Sherlock smirked: “Well in that case...and since we are having sex...and if you don’t mind to be a “kept man” in periods of not many cases and we have to live of my money...then by all means drop your job! And...”
Sherlock lay on his back on the bed, with his hands and legs in the restraints so John could abuse Sherlock’s nipples. Sucking, licking and biting and tugging until they were red and peaking, John had smiled a bit dangerously before clamping the nipple-clamps on them and turning the screws tightly. So tight that Sherlock had bucked and moaned obscenely, but hadn’t been able to orgasm because of the straps wrapped around the base of his cock and balls.
Mycroft nodded, “Being an '

“Well. My first big mistake was to let you into my life...”
(Not beta'ed or britt-picked, so all the failures are mine)
The next time John and Sherlock had an enema session, they invited Mycroft to watch. This time, the thanks were heard in person.
“I’ve tested every single one of them. On my hands, that is”, continued Sherlock with a small tinge of red on his cheeks, “I tried to buy them on the net. They are organic and from a very special and small shop in Soho. But as I called to ask why the items could not be bought on the net, but only in the real shop, I was told why, and had to turn up in person. It was a bit embarrassing.“
And yet...he came back...hit me in the head with something and as I fell down on the floor and he began to beat me with that Zimbabwean knife-whip he had taken from the African collection of weapons hanging on the wall....right there I saw everything clearly. The last piece of the puzzle fell into place and I must have yelled at him: “The black suitcase, of course.....” because he gasped and stopped beating me and ran. I got back on my feet again....so happy that I finally had solved the case and a bit angry at myself for not having seen the solution before. I called Lestrade, told him where he could find his murderer and put on my coat, hailed a cab and went home. I suddenly felt so tired.”
“Jesus..”, said John, and continued, “Where did he end up? At the bottom of Thames?”
John found a pair of nipple clamps connected with a rather heavy chain and attached them to Sherlock's nipples after having removed the tiny bars, that Sherlock always wore. Sherlock hissed at the pain but didn't say anything. Sherlock had closed his eyes and his legs were bend at the knees and weighted down with the manacles. His hands were lying passively beside him, resting on the sheet. But John could see that they were still tense. Even the pain from the caning and the cropping and now from the nipple-clamps hadn't brought Sherlock peace. He was still fighting his roaring mind and John could see that Sherlock was trembling with the effort of fighting his mind.
“My pleasure, husband. But if you worry so much, then you can find a way to at least prevent the biggest disasters...”
________________________
Sherlock opened his eyes, “How do you know?”
John sighed, “I had to be a sadist and really hurt him, before his mind would still. I hate that version of myself. I enjoyed it too much: caning him, cropping him, fucking him...and I hate, that I felt like that. That I enjoyed it that much!”
John smiled and cupped Sherlock's face and kissed Sherlock so thoroughly that Sherlock totally forgot what he was going to ask.
And John read and then looked at Mycroft: “Oh God...how could I be so blind?”
'William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes
“Oh...that is why there is not a single hair to be spotted. Isn’t it rather painful?”
“Understandable. But....” and now Mary turned towards John, “I do love you...in my own way. And I saw what Sherlock's, well, 'first death' did to you.....and I hated the thought of him being able to take you away from me. And then it turned out that he would rather rip his own heart out, than make you unhappy. How can I ever compete with a love like that? So, I am actually leaving. Going back to The States.....”
6th of January 1976- 18th of October 2070’
“Here! Some Dutch courage, so you finally can get it said, the thing you came for.” and he made a gesture towards the two chairs in front of the fireplace. His own that had survived the explosion and a new reddish one, that replaced John's old one. The old one had been too damaged. John sat down and huffed, “Well. This might not be wise since I said 'alcoholic'...”
“Oh my God....please do not hang up, sir. Stay on the line!” the young man almost stuttered.....and then John could hear the young man shout out in the room: “My God. It is him....I’ve got him on the phone right now. The man we’ve been looking for for more than 6 years!!!!!”
“Well. As I said, I was in a rough place. To put it short: Victor and I had become friends after the dog incident. We even ended up sharing rooms at one of the colleges. Then that awful Christmas came where I was invited to Victor's home, and I deduced something very unfortunate about his father, that later caused him to loose his job and I was asked to get out of their house. Later, back at Oxbride, after we had all returned from the Christmas holidays at our families, I confessed my feelings for Victor....misguided by Victor's friendship and his mannerisms.....and to use Victor's words 'forced my freakish and unnatural love upon him'. I thought to read more in his behaviour than just a straight man being a bit feminine and to put it short: as we returned to Oxbridge after our Christmas holidays, separately, I was met with a locked door and a shouting Victor, who accused me of various crimes and refused to let me have my possessions. Then he barged out and punched me and kicked me and left me out there in the hall. I had returned before Victor and had just been to the lab to do some investigations and was now standing there, beaten and bloodied without coat, money, or anything. The things he said and accused me off and the beating, made me leave. I was totally devastated. This had just been the last straw and I disappeared in London, just as I did after France...”
“My clever husband”, murmured Greg. And kissed Mycroft. And like that they fell asleep.
Mycroft shook his head, “Not the
He took a drag of his cigarette too and leaned against the balustrade, looking out over the city, before he answered, “Well...'not marrying you'....you are right, it is a bit to late for doing that...... and...”
“I don't understand, Sherlock. Wasn't all this caused by Eurus?”
Last chapter....and this is going to be a part of the first chapter in my next series about Khan Noonien Singh.
John took a firm grip at Sherlock’s hands as he was about to take them away: “Now you listen to me, William Sherlock Scott Holmes and you listen very carefully! Being a masochist...or a sadist......being submissive or dominant.....it is most certainly not being a “freak”. It is the way your body...and mind....work! As I said, the framework for normality is rather loose-fitting. As long as it is between two adults.....and it is safe, sane and consensual...I see no problem!”
He looked down at his hands. The hands that without even a tool in them, had made people talk and tell their innermost secrets. Or the secrets of the organisation they belonged to. And scream!
Sherlock looked at him, “We almost died today. Even if we were not in danger, it doesn't alter the feeling. I want the pain....and to hell with the tissue-damage. I want to feel it tomorrow as well. To feel that I'm alive. Don't you want it?”
Hamish was very intelligent and had been attending a school for very gifted children in Berlin, even if he was only 5....and that had caused him a bit of trouble, as he had gotten a new teacher, right after he had returned to Berlin after the weddings, together with Irene, his mother.
“I see” said John with a grim expression on his face: “and your superiors will insist on sending him away on one dangerous mission after another until he fails...right?! Despite everything Sherlock has done in the past to save lives?!”
“Except from when I was drugging myself into a double kidney failure and a certain death.....I know.”, said Sherlock and continued as he yawned, “My God...I'm exhausted... I love you and would like to cuddle as we always do, but I'm so tired, that I might fall asleep immediately!”
Sherlock had smiled a genuine smile and bowed his head and had said, “I'm flattered. I do think, that I prefer to be the one and only consulting detective, though.”
Mycroft sighed and fidgeted a bit with his napkin. To anyone else he would have seemed fully composed. But not to John. John was very adept at 'reading' one Holmes-brother and found it not difficult to 'read' Mycroft either, most of the time. But Mycroft had changed now and was even easer to 'read' by now...at least for John.
“It is not something that comes for free, John, and Mycroft has never understood the level of that....nor the means I've used to get into that state of mind.”
“You look awful..”, Sherlock said, “My fault?”
Sherlock moved and gave Mycroft a hug and allowed him to rest his head on Sherlock's shoulder and moved his hands in soothing circles on Mycroft's back, as he said, “And I might regret it tomorrow...but right now I can only say that I can forgive you.”
“Mycroft?! Why?” and then John understood: “Oh my God.....cameras! You two have no comprehension of normal privacy...do you?!”
Sherlock laughed, “That was what they were meant for, weren't they?”
They discussed when they could visit the club, in which Sherlock had been submissive and masochistic....and Sherlock made a phone-call and it was agreed that they could turn up there 2 hours from now.
Of course Mycroft could follow John’s arguments.....he was “the smart one” after all... and he looked at John...and now John got really worried, because there was pity in Mycroft’s eyes.
“We have never lived together...only in the holidays.....so we are more like cousins...and that is legal.”, had Rosie said. And she was right...of course she was.
And then Sherlock hugged him, “I almost lost you today. When I woke up and John was in the well and I didn't know where you were...I..I thought you had been murdered! No matter that it was a false set-up. I thought Eurus had killed you!”
“Mmmm...”afternoon” then John.....and a “I’m sorry” offered!”
Sherlock turned his head and pressed his nose against John’s groin and sniffed, “Umm… I like it when you smell of you and not so much soap… And don’t you call yourself an old man. There’s only a few years between us.” Sherlock pressed his nose further into John’s now very erect cock.
He decided that he would risk sitting down on the bed next to Sherlock, who was lying on his back. John took Sherlock’s hand carefully....ready to let it go if Sherlock took his hand back. Right there in that moment Sherlock reminded John so much of a slightly a bit too much inbreed thoroughbred horse...strong muscles rippling under velvet-like skin and eyes and mane wild.
And then Mary told John what had happened to Sherlock.
And suddenly John understood: “
“I can't. I cannot face those two Holmes-brothers. I have let them down. Both of them. So terribly...and most of all Sherlock. Mycroft made me promise to look after Sherlock after he.....something happened on the plane with destination Zagreb. And I didn't....”
“Hmm. Yes I noticed.”
Sherlock just looked at her and she thought for a moment that he wouldn't say a word.
And then, 2 weeks later, Baker Street 221B was again their mutual home. This time for the three of them. But of course there were other changes than them being two men and a toddler. Sherlock's former bed room was now 'John and Sherlock's' bedroom. John's old bedroom upstairs had been re-decorated into Rosie's room and she was safe and happy up there with a baby-monitor in case they wouldn't hear her in the first place. The stairs were secured with baby gates, so Rosie couldn't get hurt falling down the stairs when she would crawl and later walk. And Sherlock's laboratory were now downstairs in the renovated Baker Street 221C. And some of the furniture had been changed as well. Some of it because it had been beyond repair and some of it because it ought to be more child-proof.
“What happened to him?”, wanted John to know.
Mycroft paused and then he said, “No...he was practically untouchable. We had tried, but in vain.”
It was late in the afternoon before both men woke up.
Sherlock smiled and closed his eyes and gave Mycroft's hand a squeeze and the two brothers just sat and lied there in that cellar-room. The only two persons alive in that big house. In all the bedrooms were dead people. And the twenty secret leaders, that had planned the meeting, but most certainly not the abduction of two top politicians, were lying in their beds, just as dead as the incompetent group of Bulgarian people, that had thought it be a good idea to attack and abduct two high ranking politicians.
And then Elizabeth paused, “You do know that that piece of land, she wants to give Sherlock is between that ridiculous little 'posts-stamp' of a farm, that John has inherited and a piece of the old 'Homes'-estate?”
Mycroft wisely didn’t say a word when John had made his remark about his own intelligence.
“No?!” was Mycroft’s a bit surprised question.
John had looked sternly at Sherlock and had said, “But don't feel obliged to do what we talked about so many years ago, Love. You don't have to.”
They agreed on some role-play. Something they hadn’t done often. But the ‘very naughty Scottish school-boy and his very stern Scottish teacher’ made so nice use of both the crop and the kilts.
Mycroft smiled, “That was a small tribute to a story that Sherlock loved as a child.”
Sherlock nodded, “It is just a bit weird, that I did put those words in my dream. But I must have heard them somewhere. It could be a coincidence, but you know my view on coincidences. Well, would you like to see what's in that box?”

“But not Kate?”
And then Sherlock frowned and said, "That is why I thought I had seen you before, when we met at Bart's!"
“Do you know what they are designed for, John?”
“OK. Well...this happened when I was 16. I was home for my summer holiday. Mycroft was 23 and was living at our parental home again, for a short notice. He had finished his education at Oxbridge. Was only lacking his last exams and had cleared his rooms at the university and was waiting for his flat to be available. He was really going to 'occupy a minor position in the government' then. But as you might have guessed it would not be for long. Aunt Marjorie had plans for him, but he would still have to make a few years of 'legwork' before she would finally accept, that even if he was one of her best agents in the field, Mycroft would be so much more of use here in England. At that point I was chosen to take his place. They thought us to be so similar in every way, because he had taught me well and everybody did believe, including me, that I could detach myself from my feelings. It turned out to be a mistake. Well, back to the summer when I was 16. And discovered something surprising about myself...and Mycroft as well.
John went to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him. Savouring the wonderful smell of 'Sherlock'. His aftershave, his shampoo and under that, the wonderful rich and nice scent of Sherlock himself.
The Queen touched his hand: “This knighthood....and a nice annual sum.... has been waiting for you the last 6 years, Dr John Watson. And there has been one waiting for Sherlock Holmes since 2013 and even before that.....he had always refused, but maybe you can persuade him. The Royal Pardon for Sherlock is on its way....the usual bureaucracy will just delay it a bit...and I have an announcement to make in the parliament before it will be completed. But believe me Dr. John Watson. I’ll personally take each one of these politicians on a personal ride in my car here, until they accept it!”
“Sherlock didn't have access to Grand-Maman's heritage. The French lawyers were very strict. Sherlock never finished his education....”
Sherlock smiled and made a gesture towards the woman, “Meet Marianne Hooper. Molly's twin sister....Not a pathologist, but a doctor.”
Sherlock looked thoughtful, “There are a few totally closed countries. He might have hidden in them. And there is a bottom below the 'bottom of society'. If he is there...was there...we can't find him. And shouldn't we just leave it there? He ruined himself and his father and mother too, and finding him will not mend Eurus nor me...”
The angel slumped down on the floor and just looked at John. Then he shook his head and said, “Against stupidity even the angles struggle in vain..”......
Mycroft sighed and touched the ring, “She was beautiful. Looked like you could have imagined Nefertiti would be looking as a living, breathing woman. She was smart and very well educated already. She could speak almost as many languages as I could, and we liked a lot of the same things: chess, classical music, classical literature, but horror films and science-fiction as well. One woman out of...billions. We got married fast because otherwise she would have had to return to Tunisia. And then it happened. The attack, and even if I tried to cover her with my own body....she got shot...and died in my arms.”
John kissed Sherlock and continued, “I want to overwrite that wedding. But...Oh my God...never in a yellow room again. That particular colour makes me want to vomit! I want to have a perfect one, this time with you. I don’t want our wedding to be a ‘second class’-wedding, just going to the town hall as we planned. I want it to be better, bigger, more extravagant.....because it is going to be my last and only wedding...with you.”
Sherrinford nodded and said, “And Eurus moved to Russia. Mycroft stayed here in England.”
John had smiled back, “I'm afraid that you would grow tired of me, if we lived forever...”
John paused to think before he continued, “I've always seen your brother as a very complicated man. When we first met, I thought your brother and you to be rather alike. Cold, calculating and aloof. But with your brother as the total ice-man and you very close to having no feelings too. Not one single warm thought towards others. Then.....I came to learn that he cared for you in his own way. A bit to 'big-brother-ly' and that not always in a good way. Later I rather saw the differences between you. And after we made that prank on him...Oh God, how did you persuade me to do that? There must have been some of that Mary-drug left in my system. Well after that prank and his 'revenge' on that false island set-up, and after he and I talked recently, my perception of him has altered again. He is not as cold and calculating, as he would like to appear. He is almost as soft under his armour as you are. I don't think that you and him can be put in a box labelled 'normal' and I begin to believe that they really tampered with your genes, then...way back at Baskerville. And who am I to judge?”
Mycroft closed his eyes in order to feel how his body was and then he opened them again and lifted the blanket, “You removed the cage.....and the wounds can't be that bad. They don't feel that bad.”
And things settled down a bit. Both for John and Sherlock. And for Mycroft and Greg, who finally ended up confessing their love for each other. Mycroft and Greg did need a little push though to go from 'friends' to 'lovers'
John took a deep breath before he continued, “You were taken from Baker Street and brought to a hospital. Thank God, Lestrade saw that, or else your brother might have succeeded in doing it secretly. At that time Mycroft was still keeping up appearances. And from that point things got rather......intense.
Then he took a deep breath and looked at Mary, “I can tell you, because you can keep a secret. And somehow it would be nice to know that someone knows why I shot Mycroft......and Culverton..”
And Sherlock continued, “I settled down in the firm conviction that I had read you the wrong way. Just like with Victor and that you were totally straight. You confirmed that by dating quite a lot of women. That we just were flatmates and nothing more....even if we protected each other. And then all that with Moriarty...well 'Magnussen-and-Mycroft-united' happened, even if my brother later regretted every move he had to make then. I had to jump to save your life. Or so it appeared then, and as I returned, I finally realised, what I really felt for you. Or rather....being away those two years made me realise my feelings for you.....and then I returned...”
Over the next couple of days, Sherlock got gradually better and better. The tracheo-tube had been removed and the wound would only leave a small scar. And John and Sherlock talked and talked.
“And we should get a cab and be heading towards my flat...”
John just nodded...a bit surprised that Mycroft was concerned about Rosie too.
“But we could make her life a bit more bearable”, continued Mycroft, “... And it worked. She now accepts visits. She can be in rooms, that are not stripped from anything that the most necessary. She can be outside in the nature and listen to music. She can eat normally and she reacts positively to other people without screaming and curling herself into a ball, as she did a lot of times, when the world became too much. And she communicates. Through art and music and sometimes words. She is so much better.....”
Now John had an almost devilish grin on his face: “Oh.. they are rings all right. But not for our fingers!”
And then he had a terrible thought, “Hmm. Are there cameras inside too?”
The only sane explanation was that they did resemble...vaguely.....the French foreign-minister and the Canadian Prime-minister and the threats in awful French, that had been thrown in their direction in the car, did indicate that the goons did believe them to be exactly those two persons. Of course the press would reveal that those two persons were safe and that two British secretaries had been abducted......and then what? They would have to stick to their cover story....no matter what. If the goons found out who they really were, they would be an even better prey, even better hostages.
John thought for a moment and then he nodded, “Yeah...I suppose you are right. Damn it!”
And finally John understood, “You were not the only one given TD-12, were you?”
John blushed a bit: “He is...”
Hamish gave her a hug and had tears in his own eyes, “Because they were the finest and best men in the world...and gave us so much. The best parents you could wish for. And because we loved them.”
Mycroft tried with a: “What about Moriarty!?”
“At the Diogenes' Club I was drugged and everybody, including Culverton Smith, did assume that I couldn't distinguish between real events and those induced into my brain and being very close to reality. But I've always had a trick. It could be things placed the wrong place. A painting with a face turning to the right instead of to the left. A globe smaller than the real one. The more items, the easier to see the difference., because the false reality couldn't keep track of everything ...”
“Yes John....please?”
Mycroft had nodded, “And you know very well that a 'gut-feeling' can be you subconscious mind putting things together. And that, together with that mail, makes me realise, that I need more data.”
Mycroft looked a bit embarrassed: “Well....actually....we are...but have chosen not to use the titles.....It would have jeopardised my mother’s career and it is she who is the “Holmes”...not my father. The “fine” part of my family didn’t want to have anything to do with my great-grandfather as he married beneath his station when he married a French non-aristocratic girl. And my mother continued that line by marrying my father. But as the “fine” part died out my mother turned out to be the sole heir. I do not possess a place in the House of Lords and I have no intention of doing so. Not for the time being. It doesn’t indicate that I do not have the proof that I would indeed be entitled to do so......but it would mean that Sherlock would have to take his seat there too....and in that case......”
John reached for Sherlock and kissed him and Sherlock kissed him back and tried to say something....and finally managed: ”If you are still afraid...then we can get restraints that I’ll be able to get out of. I used something like that in the clubs.....my brain just have to forget that I can!”
“I'm not Sherlock or you. I can't do, what you can do...”
*SAME TO YOU! I MISS YOU. TAKE CARE! I LOVE YOU!*
She smiled a little sad smile: “And now you are going to hate me. But believe me. When I found out how insane Moriarty was and that the people he wanted shot was an elderly woman, a hardworking police inspector and a doctor....well I decided that I’d rather shoot the one who hired me. Strangely enough he shot himself before I could do it. I’ve always wondered what Sherlock said to Jim, that made him shoot himself........and I have followed you for such a long time on Jim’s order.....and I couldn’t help but falling in love with you John. I’m sorry that I have lied about a lot of things. But I never lied about my love for you!”
Sherlock looked at John and wondered if he did dare saying about John and Rosie and Baker Street. And then Sherlock made a decision, because he didn't dare hope for anything so he just said, “You are a good father John. You do have a lot of friends, who would be there to help you. Even me.....”
“And that is the stagnation-situation right now in so many countries, as far as my information goes. Super-soldiers against super-soldiers. The third World War is happening right now......it is just in 'encounters' and small attacks...and letters send between diplomats. Secret attacks on key-positions. Attacks that can be denied on both sides, so the public actually do not know anything. Just.....private organisations is now military organisations...like the internet, like a lot of our means of communication. And it had been like that for years. But now the military is abandoning their bases near the cost. Shouldn't it be regarded as a warning?

“To ask where and when? No. I'll listen if you want to tell me. But only if you want to.”
“Envied me?! What on Earth for?”
“I better begin with the beginning now, if any of this is going to make any sense...”, said Sherlock.
Sherlock told, “The first blow did hurt like hell and I had moved my hands to my buttocks to rub them. Mycroft ordered me to put my hands back on the bed....and to my own surprise, I just obeyed. The second blow did hurt, but there was a pleasant buzz after that. The third blow gave me an erection and Mycroft told me to stoke myself. He continued with a series of small....taps...would be the right word, and then forceful blows..”
Sherlock smiled at John....and he had wanted to make a comment of John’s comparison of him to a horse....but refrained from it and said instead: “You can...I’ve never met a man with a stronger moral or principles. Yes, you are dangerous behind your disguise in your woollen jumpers...but that was what I saw the moment we met....and what Mary saw in you too. Don’t tell me that you haven’t faced the demons inside.....those who had whispered as you were lying in the sand looking through the scope of your rifle...”What if I turned around and shot my friends instead of my foes?”...The same voice which talks to you when you are standing on a tall cliff....”What if I jumped?”
He just, meekly, said, “Yes… I understand.”
“Please, Sherlock. Don't die on me again...” John said and had grappled for Sherlock's hand and had continued, “Rosie.....” and he swallowed, “......she is probably not going to make it. And maybe we should be thankful for that. Her life would not be easy...”
John had risen and kissed Sherlock, “I trust you with my life. And if you’ve deduced that I might need something like that..” John pointed at the collar and the harness, “Well, I’m willing to give it a try!”
And Sherlock remembered. How Magnussen had almost raped him...and how Mary had told him “not to tell John.”
“I like it and find it very arousing, that you are shaved, that your balls are so hairless and the rest of your groin, including your arse, too..”, said John almost conversationally as he continued to take Sherlock apart, taking Sherlock's balls into his mouth and sucking on them. Just with a tiny touch of teeth.
dimension, 'Time', doesn't mean a thing to us more advanced beings....”
It was only John’s immense will-power that prevented him from coming on the spot....oh God...Sherlock’s voice....pure sex! Sherlock could read the telephone book aloud and John would be able to come from that alone!
“But...no offence, Mary, but you are not the woman I married and I'm not going to stay with you....” said John. There was no reason not to be honest now.
“Yeah...and Rosie. But she has no intention of killing us. At least I hope so....” and then John smiled and kissed Sherlock's curls and as Sherlock lifted his head, Sherlock's mouth too. Because they could and it was allowed.
Sherlock finally signs the papers, so now he is Rosie's father. John learns something new about Sherlock and what he did in his youth. They talk about revenge and forgiveness again.
John just smiled a sad smile, “You asked me sort of the same question when I told you about my violent tendencies. You are right . I am not in a state...sometimes....where Rosie would be in good hands staying by me.”
Mycroft nodded, but didn't say anything.
John turned towards Sherlock and reached out with his other hand to touch those beautiful features of the man he finally had allowed himself to love and allowed himself to show that he loved, and John continued, “And here we are. You and me...finally together and I'm giddy as a teenager. Horny as one too. You just have to speak to me in that voice and my refractory period becomes that of a teenager. You just have to look at me like you sometimes do.....and I'm ready for another round. It is going to be quite a problem on crime-scenes, you know!”
“He had a fucking ear-piece, Sherlock. How on earth could I have dreamt something so insane?”
Sherlock always kissed John's scar and said, “It brought you into my life. And even if we had to take a lot of detours, we ended up here. Together! And that is the most important part of it all.”
Now Sherlock looked a bit embarrassed, because he suddenly understood that John actually might not like his job as a doctor at the clinic.
Mycroft turned towards John and Greg, “And I need you two as well.”
Sherlock laid down again and snuggled closer to John, “Well...it did work. Neither of you looked appealed...”
And he continued to tell about how the whole affair had been staged. How he and John had been put on the street after the windows had been pushed out by a forceful air-canon. How a team had entered the flat and begun to 'destroy' things.
And Mycroft could see some of the tension leave Sherlock as he obediently crawled up on the padded cross and positioned himself on it. It fit perfectly to his measurements, but of course it did. It was custom-made to fit him...and Mycroft. That a bit more than half an inch in difference of hight between the two brothers, didn't matter.
The second their door closed in their flat, or even pushed up against the hallway leading towards their door, they went at it. Lips roaming, hands grasping at whatever they made contact with, each swallowing the other’s breath, their moans; their hearts
John may be angered should he find out, but Sherlock knew he’d thank her in the long run
That hand was currently touching her so intimately
He just traced her hips with his thumbs in odd, repetitive patterns and watching her with his dark blue eyes that looked almost black in the lack of lighting, and it was one of those rare moments, were he looked completely focused, as if he could see more than her. She’d only witnessed the look a few times before, when they were in danger and the only solution was the steadying of his hand on his gun, read to fire the second it was necessary
His eyes, though still strikingly gray, were soft, his face kind and inviting
