The bow of the massive ship glided through the calm ocean water with ease as the sun rose high in a clear sky. Tony Stark walked along the ship deck, a pile of notes in hand. They were heading back to America, his body and mind more than eager to be back on solid ground. Their trip to Europe was two weeks long, the majority of the time meeting with Hydra Energy, a company that specialized in alternative power and energy creation. The brunette inventor definitely had his reservations about the company that nobody had really known of. It was 1886 however, and America was rather isolated from the rest of the world, so Tony could understand why American companies had not dabbled with this particular business.
Steve didn’t say a word then, his eyes partly closed as he gazed at his brunette lover salaciously, his dry hand slipping down his come laden abdomen and to his swelling arousal. He stroked his cock with light touches, causing Tony to exhale a faint moan at the sight as he knelt in front of the soldier, staring.
Staying away from everyone was for the best, Tony’s irrational behavior wasn’t anyone’s doing, especially Steve’s. He’d work everything out within his brain and heart. And once that was sorted, he’d carry on as he normally would, a shit-eating grin plastered on his face and an ego to fill an entire building.
The room filled with the heady sounds of Tony’s gasps and erotic moans while the blonde suckled the velvety head of the other man’s cock. Steve hummed around Tony’s length at one point, slowly working it back until the brunette was fully taken in, the super soldier’s nose brushing against his future husband’s well-groomed pubic hair.
“Eager, huh?” Tony observed, a chuckle on his lips as he scissored Steve open slowly, enough for Steve’s head to slump down on the lush pillows, feeling all that Tony was giving him. The brunette hooked his fingers deep within Steve, igniting a strangled cry as he brushed Steve’s prostate over and over. The super soldier was writhing underneath him, and Tony could see his balls tight. Reaching around and lifting Steve’s hips, Tony grabbed onto the man’s penis, pinching it at the base so that Steve didn’t come just yet. Steve choked out a sob, the pressure overwhelming.
Steve, with a happy swirling of anticipation in his chest, headed out toward his living room where Tony was working on some numerical formulas on his Stark Pad. The genius had been busy the last few days with multiple conference calls as well as webinar meetings. So, the blonde decided that this would be a perfect way for his wonderful boyfriend to relax and not worry about things for a while. Plus, with Tony being so preoccupied with work, they didn’t have any romance time, and that needed to change.
“I just am rather off about this business move,” the brunette finally admitted, moving his head away, away from the woman’s enticing touch. “It’s a big investment, the stakes are high. American companies do not often collaborate with the European market.” Tony stood then, taking his leather gloves off and slipping them into his back pocket while still holding the documents. Pepper pursed her lips and nodded, understanding Tony’s reservations. “Why does an alternative energy company want to establish a business agreement with us, a primarily weapon based industry?”
“Alright, well I’m gonna change the spark plugs then,” Tony replied, moving to the hood of the car, careful not to kick Steve’s legs.
Once he and happy got Pepper situated with her luggage into the limo, Tony gave the beautiful woman a tender kiss on her forehead. She smiled at the affection.
The genius eventually stilled his love’s hands, taking them in each of his own and kissing Steve’s knuckles. The blonde hummed in enjoyment, feeling the scratch of Tony’s beard on his skin. The brunette kissed his way then up Steve’s forearm and to his bicep and shoulder before pulling the super soldier closer to him. Tony could feel Steve melt a little more with each press of a kiss, and the genius couldn’t resist nuzzling in the crook of his boyfriend’s neck, rubbing his facial hair there. Steve squealed out a giggle as Tony tickled him, the brunette laughing too. Tony did show clemency to his love though and replaced his tickly beard with soft kisses to Steve’s fair skin, soothing the flesh that was reddening there with little licks.
“That might be,” Tony replied, leaning in and mouthing at Steve’s hard length underneath the fabric, Steve’s surprised gasp spurring him on. “But I do know how amazing they feel. Think I can give it a go,” he murmured before kissing the head of his boyfriend’s arousal.
He hadn’t realized though, that his quietness and distance was doing exactly what he tried to avoid. It was Steve confronting him in the elevator that popped the bubble Tony was trying to secure himself in. When he saw the sense of hurt and betrayal cross Steve’s face when he called Tony out on his actions, his heart sank. He felt like a total asshole for making Steve feel that way, his close friend and teammate. Tony had tried so hard for his and Pepper’s break up to be just between them, to keep others from getting hurt. And yet, he fucked things up again, hurting Steve in the process.
Steve latched his hands on the headboard, his body bent in half as Tony maneuvered him however he wanted. His erection leaked steadily as Steve found Tony’s open mouth to kiss him frantically. He clenched his body around Tony, hearing the man huff out a groan, and he rammed into Steve with all his might. Steve moaned with Tony, their voices ringing into a melodic tune of pleasure. Looking between them, Steve watched Tony’s thick length pull out of him, the fat head teasing his loose wet rim a moment, time standing still.
Stroking a thumbnail down one of the rosy peaks, Tony brushed the scratchy hair of his beard on the other nipple, eliciting a rushed breath of pleasure from the blonde. “You’re so sensitive, Steve. I wish I could play with you like this forever,” Tony said, looking at how the nipple was reddening from the thick hairs of his beard. He swirled and laved at the nub then, soothing the delicate skin with long wet glides of his tongue.
“Well, one quick call, would probably brighten the man’s day. You know he hates those meetings.” Steve knew she was right. He and Tony had only texted each other a few times since he had left. The lack of contact was killing Steve, and he felt it was killing Tony too. He checked the time; it was 9:30pm in New York. So it was 6:30pm in California where Tony’s meetings were. If he waited till 11pm or so, Tony should be done with his meetings and finished with dinner by then.
That following morning there was an Avengers training session that Tony clearly forgot about as he strolled into their gym with a mug, the mug Steve gave him, full of coffee.
Steve eventually raised a hand to comb his fingers through Tony’s dark hair, and the genius smiled tiredly, a sudden yawn escaping his ruby lips.
“Well then, if you’re trying to relieve my stress, then the plans I have for you are gonna be heaven for us both,” Tony growled possessively, capturing Steve’s lips as they stumbled to the super soldier’s room. They managed to get there, lips locked, and only running into a few walls along the way. Tony kissed Steve down into the mattress, the blonde’s hands pulling his boyfriend’s shirt off, revealing firm muscles and that beautiful glowing arc reactor. Steve couldn’t help but to intensify their kissing, slipping his tongue into Tony’s mouth, tasting his teeth, tongue and the lining of his jaw. Tony always tasted amazing, a mixture of mint and coffee. Feeling the brunette’s lithe body slide against his own was enough for Steve to buck his hips up against Tony’s, the rasp of his jeans a pleasant texture to his sensitive arousal.
When he spoke to Steve, his voice was kind and his pearly smile comforted the merman, giving Steve the confidence to trust him as the brunette cut away the ropes and tried to help Steve into the sea. Even when he was escorted away, leaving Steve alone with the seemingly ruthless crew members, Steve could see the kind man did not want to leave Steve, and was worried for him.
They both turned around, and Steve tried to figure out where the snowball came from, only to get hit in the chest with one. He heard Clint’s laughter coming from behind a few of the trees that littered the yard for when they trained for different terrain. It was then Clint ran out from his hiding spot, pounding the two men with snowballs.
Tony’s expression looked surprised, though he grinned mischievously. “Of course it’s alright,” he said then, grabbing Steve by the hands and pulling him to the wide and well-loved couch he had in the lounge area of the lab. “I promise I showered like an hour before you came down here.” And Steve just rolled his eyes good naturedly, pushing Tony gently down unto the couch so that the man was completely flat on the cushions.
“Hi, Steve,” she replied, smiling back and waving at him. “How’s yours and Tony’s honeymoon?” She asked, and dammit, did that make his cheeks warm.
“She’s had better days,” Sharon admitted, her eyes saddening at the dissolving state her aunt was going through. “She speaks of you often, though. If you’re in the neighborhood, I’m sure she’d be thrilled to see you,” she added, shifting a file under her arm.
"Ah come on Tony, you still need to show us your mixed martial arts routine," Steve said, grabbing a towel to wipe the sweat off his face and neck. He noticed his shirt was soaked, and so the super soldier in one movement pulled the wet t-shirt off, flinging it into a corner. The blonde met Tony's eyes then. Tony looked at him, an indiscernible expression on his face. Steve felt shy then, as if he was too exposed to the other man. It was weird. He never cared before, and Tony never seemed to be concerned with his shirtless form before either. The blonde awkwardly tried to cover himself with the small towel and overt his gaze.
Tony leaned in then once more, licking a long stripe up the cleft of Steve’s rump, the flat of his tongue grazing over the man’s tight opening. And Steve just about lost it, his moans becoming quicker the longer Tony rimmed him.
Steve woke up to a low-lit room, the sunset shining through the one circular window in the small space. He went to sit up, only for a wave of nausea and dizziness to wash over him. He groaned from the feeling, as well as the immense pain that blossomed in his skull. He laid back down with a thud, his hand gingerly touching the area where Obadiah struck him. Steve closed his eyes, breathing in slowly to stave off the uneasy feeling in his stomach. The merman sighed in frustration at the predicament he was in.
Tony was sweating, trickles of perspiration sliding down his hairline and down his temples as he watched Steve’s body jar and quake while Tony fucked him. “Grab the headboard,” Tony grunted, shifting Steve’s legs so that Tony was holding them up with his arms and shoulders
“Oh,” Steve replied. “Well, it’s nice knowing another friendly face that’s on the same side. Someone trustworthy.”
“I’m not. She isn’t who-” Steve was trying to form a coherent sentence, his eyes owlish and pleading as he looked to Sharon.
“Fourth time tonight for you, coming up,” Tony purred, bracing his elbows on either side of Steve’s head. You’re gonna be so sore…” The genius kissed the super soldier chastely, surprising Steve when he suddenly sheathed himself fully into him. The blonde’s warm heat was so familiar and yet still so wonderful a sensation. He captured all of Steve’s gasps of both pleasure and pain from being over stimulated. Tony made sure Steve was okay, and was willing to keep going despite being worn and sore. Steve looked up at him, though, beautiful ocean eyes capturing his then.
"This is my choice, Tony. Being with you is the biggest gift I have ever received. You being my soulmate, and you
“I know that you love me, Tony,” she started then, grasping his other hand in hers while she also rested one hand on the man’s shoulder. “But not in a romantic, relationship way. I can’t help but feel that I’ll never have your whole heart.” Pepper began to sway gently form side to side, Tony following into rhythm. “There’s a piece of you that already belongs to someone else.”
Standing abruptly, tossing the stylus onto a random work table, Tony walked to the back area of the lab where he had his cars, one of them, a ’67 Ford Mustang needing worked on. This would be the perfect distraction, nothing Captain America related whatsoever.
In retrospect, it shouldn’t have looked so alluring to Steve. But here he was, swallowing thickly, his hormones taking off.
“I don’t think that’ll be going away for a bit,” Steve snickered, his eyes flickering up to the brunette’s, a coy grin on his face.
It was as if they were fated by the stars, destined to be together no matter the odds that fought against them. They were like the warriors in his mother’s story, Brayan and Ferris, always together in the constellation above.
“That merman,” Doctor Banner said, wiping his hands on a towel. “That is what is on your mind, is it not?”
After Tony worked the fifth bead in though, Steve felt a decent amount of pressure in his opening, catching him off guard by the slightly stronger sensation.
“I’ll be heading to Japan to meet with Stark expansion there tomorrow. I’ll drop by afterwards to go over everything and have you sign all the papers you don’t care about,” she said, her words attempting to be humorous. Pepper’s eyes betrayed her, though, as they watered once more.
“Yes, uhn-Tony,” Steve cried out, taking all that Tony gave him. It was only a few more thrusts and strokes from Tony when Steve’s body arched back, hole clenching around Tony’s arousal, fist tightening in the man’s hair.
“Sorry,” Steve apologized in more of a whimper. He didn’t mean to do that to the man and make him choke. Tony merely hummed around him in response, the vibration resonating through Steve like that of a cello string. “Ah!” Steve groaned, his brows knitting up as the coil in his belly neared its breaking point. He felt Tony’s fingernails dig into the flesh where Steve’s lower back met his bum, the sweet bite of pain enhancing all that Tony was doing to him. His boyfriend was bobbing up and down on his length, his movements becoming faster and faster while pressing his fingers deeper into his back.
“Also, we have already served dinner, but I will be sure to bring up two meals for you,” the young man added, handing Tony the room key.
“Shit, you’re-uhn so hot,” Tony groaned out, resorting to pulling his boxers down around his upper thighs to lazily caress his cock. The agony of his swollen, purply length was getting to be too much, and if Steve wasn’t fully prepped soon, Tony didn’t know if he’d last much longer.
It was a bit strange, Steve figured, looking at himself in vain as he tried to see all that Tony saw in him. It wasn’t that Steve thought of himself as unattractive, he just never was one to pay that much attention to himself. Not when so many others depended on him and the rest of his fellow Avengers.
“J.A.R.V.I.S, black out the windows in here, would you please?” Tony asked then, keeping his eyes locked on his boyfriend’s. Instantly the windows tinted so that Steve and Tony could look out, though nobody would be able to see inside. “Did you like what else I had placed in your basket, Stevie?” Tony asked, leaning in to nip at Steve’s jaw as the one hand of his fingers teased along the cleft of the blonde’s bum.
Tony figured out the creature’s pattern. It was heat sensitive, which meant it was drawn to large masses of people. Tony confined it to a two block radius, though, keeping it out of the vicinity of civilians while Thor discovered that the beast had multiple blind spots. Natasha and Steve rallied the citizens they could, bringing them to safety while Clint nestled on a rooftop, shooting the beast with his best ammo arrows.
Steve’s body was lax, heavy as Tony held him up. It was when Steve seemed more alert and his breathing regulated, did he let go of Tony’s hair, arm falling like lead. Tony leaned down and kissed the blonde’s flush cheek. He was shaking with anticipation. He needed to come so bad it was painful. The super soldier moved to turn on his back then, slow and languid as he stared up at Tony from the new position. He reached forward, took Tony’s hips, and pulled him close, knowing the man was a mess. Also, Tony was basically whimpering at the loss of heat from Steve’s body.
“Steve, you alright?” He heard Tony ask then. “You look like you’re in pain.” Steve was staring blankly at the screen as he focused on his body’s reactions. He turned to see how Tony was looking up at him from where his head had been resting on Steve’s shoulder, his brown eyes liquid pools as the light from the TV screen reflected in them. Steve could see the concern written on his boyfriend’s expression. “What’s wrong, hon?”
He rolled under the car and started changing the oil once more, careful not to make an even bigger mess of things. That would at least help the brunette out a little bit and help get Steve back in his good graces.
“I hope not,” Steve replied, ducking inside the dome and closing up the panel. “How’d you do this?” Steve inquired, looking out of the glass in awe. “Wait, don’t tell me, I won’t understand a word of it,” he said quickly. The genius could only chuckle at that.
He was happy to have shared that with Steve, and he could tell the man was feeling a little better afterwards, his nightmare not so fresh on his mind. Tony had gone to bed, expecting that this time, that would be it.
Tony was close, Steve could tell by the primal notion of the man’s actions. Tony’s thrusts had deepened, his thick length filling Steve up with each pulse of his hips. He drifted his hands back to Steve’s rump, slamming the man down as he rammed into his loosened hole. The super soldier’s sighs and grunts only spurred Tony on as he pounded up into him, squeezing his ass and massaging each cheek with firm caresses. Steve was ready to tip over the edge as well, his swelled cock slapping against his belly, precome sprinkling his abs as he rode his lover like a fucking carousel.
Steve was tired of trying though, and he decided to give up on it. He eventually didn’t try to hang out with Tony in his lab, or ask him to train with the rest of the team. If the genius was too caught up with whatever it was that made him so vile, then so be it. It took him a while, but Steve finally figured that it wasn’t his fault, and there apparently wasn’t anything he could do to help his friend. If Tony eventually came around to being his old self, Steve would still be there for him. But until then, Steve began creating a distance of his own. What made it all worse, though, were those stupid butterflies that fluttered in his chest and belly on the rare occasion that he did see Tony in passing.
“I-I…” Tony trailed off, too fixated on the lovely sight of Steve to form a coherent sentence. “This might be…no, I know it is,” Tony finally began, setting the box down and kneeling on the bed, very close to his boyfriend. “This is the best Christmas present
Steve closed his eyes as Tony kissed his body, knowing Steve’s sweet spots like a memorized equation. The super soldier leaned over and placed a sweet kiss on Tony’s dark, slightly disheveled hair, breathing in the masculine scent of his love. Steve more than wished to be able to hold Tony, to touch him with loving, tender fingers. But he knew his boyfriend really wanted his wrists to stay retrained, and the blonde was happy to do that for the genius. Steve knew that there wasn’t a single soul that he trusted more than Tony, especially when it came to giving someone control over him.
The room seemed to be 100 degrees hotter, and even the lightest of fabric of his nightie seemed too much. Steve lifted the garment over his head then, tossing it somewhere near the foot of the bed.
Giggling in excitement, Steve knelt between the man’s thighs, placing the chocolate sauce on the table next to them. He quickly went to work removing Tony’s shirt over his head, flinging it somewhere before undoing the man’s jeans. Tony angled his hips, helping Steve pull them down, leaving him in just a pair of boxers once Tony kicked his own socks off.
“We don’t have to use them,” Steve said quickly, and the brunette looked up to see Steve’s cheeks flushed deep red. Tony truly hoped the super soldier didn’t get a case of overthinking and embarrassment. “I know it’s different and significantly new for what we are accustomed to,” Steve went on, looking at his hands and shifting his wrists underneath the ribbon. He let his words hang in the air, not sure what Tony was thinking in that moment.
“Don’t try and deflect,” Tony teased, wiggling his finger at Steve through the screen. “But hell yeah I did! Steve, you could read the dictionary and I would probably get turned on by watching you do that,” Tony chuckled. Steve just shook his head and rolled his eyes good naturedly.
Steve merely whimpered out a moan, a pathetic, desperate sound as the heated desire roiled within his belly, swarming in his chest like monarchs that had wings of fire.
“Yes. Colonel Rhodes is being honored tonight. Tony naturally is going there to support him.” The red head took a step back, nodding in approval, before she changed her mind and brushed Steve’s hair a little more towards the side, defining his part.
Steve nodded in agreement, sliding off his lover’s lap and feeling the dull ache from the brunette’s fingers penetrating him begin to heighten in his backside. It was a feeling Steve thoroughly enjoyed though.
“Tony?” Steve said in a hushed tone, making his way toward the brunette. Tony looked up then, his mouth dropped and phone fell to the carpeted floor. Steve wasn’t sure how to take in that reaction, slowing his footing a bit until he stood a few feet away from his love. Tony didn’t say anything still, his mouth now parted a fraction as he took in Steve’s outfit. “What do you think?” He asked, voice a bit shaky. He tried not to ring his hands or fist the fabric as he attempted to will his nerves to settle.
“Steve, baby, you gotta-” Tony said between gritted teeth before he lost every bit of self-control that was in him. Steve swallowed with Tony’s tumescent cock in his mouth, simultaneously caressing the genius’s testicles, rolling them in his hand. The blonde even stuck two fingers against Tony’s perineum, rubbing at the prostate from the outside.
“Who is it that you’ve fallen for?” Steve asked, his cheeks tinting in rouge as he inquired, nerves building within him. He needed to know though. Steve would never entertain the idea before that he was the one Tony’ had been interested in. But now, as their bodies were mostly pressed together, and as Tony pinned his gaze on Steve, the super soldier could feel the shift between them. Something so subtle, like a kiss on the brow of a newborn babe.
“Eh, it’s going,” Steve said shrugging. “Haven’t found too many places that piqued my interest. I’ve got plenty of time to find the right space, though.”
Tony thinking that he just needed time to get over his and Pepper’s break up was the biggest understatement of the year. He also needed a killer cry session. The pain and heartache that had settled within him was almost crippling the morning after the party, the reality of the situation hitting him tenfold. It all just hurt so much. There was a part of him that kept denying it actually happened, that soon enough Pepper would walk back into his penthouse at any moment, her pearly smile glistening, her laughter like a lovebird’s song, filling the rooms. Tony only drank himself into a stupor the day after she ended things, which was pretty impressive in his opinion.
“You know, they lasted a lot longer than I had expected,” Tony said after a bit, catching his breath from laughter.
Letting out a content and quiet sigh, Steve turned his head to see Tony behind him the best he could. The super soldier smiled, feeling so wonderful and loved in his beloved’s embrace. The brunette’s hands gently stroked up over the sheer fabric that covered Steve’s waist and torso, pushing the textured cloth against the man’s warm skin. Tony’s hands then slipped up to where the silk fabric that covered Steve’s pecs molded to the musculature of his chest, feeling the hardened peaks of the blonde’s nipples underneath.
Tony breathed deeply, moving the ribbed neckline of his t-shirt over to see that red mark on his own shoulder. it was at bay now, thankfully; he was ready to claw it off earlier.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve replied, looking back the best he could to see his wrists tied beautifully, the red bow’s satiny fabric loosely tied so the blonde’s wrists would not chafe too much.
“This is new, for both of us,” Steve started, looking down a moment. “But I’ve never been with anyone.
“I can understand why you’re nervous, Steve,” the genius said then, bringing his hands to the blonde’s sides, resting them there. “And if it is any consolation, I am a little nervous, too.” Steve looked at him disbelievingly. “I know, shocking,” Tony joked before his tone became serious. Cradling Steve cheek with a masculine hand, Tony pressed a kiss to his boyfriend’s forehead. “We’re gonna figure this all out together, okay?” Tony said gently, looking at Steve. “It might be a little rocky at first. But we’re two grown men. I think we will be able to manage,” he pressed another kiss to the blonde’s temple, breathing lightly. “Plus, it’s gonna be a hell of a lot of fun as we go.” He leaned back and waggled his eyebrows comically, making Steve grin and chuckle.
But when he opened his eyes once more and met Steve’s stare, looking so sweet and surprisingly innocent as he eagerly sucked his length and stroked him with a strong fist, Tony lost himself. A frantic groan escaped him as his orgasm consumed him, and Steve drank every drop of white release as if it was water, and he had been a parched man.
me on top of it," Steve pressed a kiss to the man's mouth, giggling from the man's facial hair tickling him. "It still doesn’t seem real." The blonde nosed his way down to Tony's shoulder and kissed the soulmark sweetly. Tony gasped at the caress of his lips, and Steve could feel the pleasure it gave Tony.
The genius wrapped his arms around his love’s meaty shoulders, a hand playing with the fine hairs at the nape of Steve’s neck.
Steve eventually came out of his daze, looking around disoriented. He checked his watch, shocked that it was almost midnight. He looked at his notebook to find it partly filled with his writing, about Étienne and Antoine. The super soldier was internally freaking out, extremely worried about these visions that keep getting stronger. He pushed the notebook away as if it was a deadly substance.
happiness with the super soldier, and the knowledge of that happiness becoming a constant in his life was almost unfathomable.
“Why don’t you open it,” Tony cooed, encouraging the blonde. “Then you shall see.” Steve did not understand why Tony was being so ambiguous, but he complied, curiously unlatching the hinge that secured the lid. Opening the snuffbox revealed a deep navy, velvet cushion, a simple gold band set atop it. Steve didn’t speak for what seemed like an eternity, his blue eyes wide, the gleam from the ring glinting in his irises.
The blonde met his thrusts, though it took him a moment to find his rhythm. Once he did though, he closed his eyes and felt it all out, taking all that Tony was giving him.
They were both in need of a shower, Tony’s come slipping out of Steve’s behind and down his thighs as they rested there. “What’re the chances you built a shower or tub in here?” Steve asked jokingly, getting a contagious grin and giggle from the brunette.
“I’m gonna head in, Cap,” Tony said, rising up then and shrugging the blanket off his shoulders, only to drape it around the blonde.
“Wish we could be like this all the time,” Steve said softly, his entrance relaxing some from Tony’s gentle caresses. “Love having this between us, Tony,” he confessed, looking up at him. The brunette smiled, a soft chuckle on his lips.
Feeling Tony’s teeth bite into his skin, while his penis pressed against his prostate was enough for Steve to climax shortly after, his own come dirtying the sheets around him. His body was bent taut like a bow string against Tony, his moans loud and filling the room.
Setting the bottle aside, Steve leaned back so that his hole was once again able to be seen in the camera. Steve looked hesitant a moment, as if reconsidering what he wanted to do.
“You seem to be in a better mood too,” she added, winking at him before grabbing up a handful of cheese and sprinkling it over the eggs. Steve chuckled, giving her a playful nudge.
“Anytime, Steve” Tony’s message read. When the genius used his real name instead of ‘Cap,’ Steve’s belly flip flopped, and his shoulder blossomed with warmth. Steve rubbed a palm over his face and sighed.
“Fuck yourself, Steve,” Tony said breathlessly, eyes big and filled with yearning. Seeing his boyfriend laying there perfectly exposed and open just for Tony’s eyes was almost too much for him to take.
“Don’t harp on me about being reckless,” Steve finally snapped, practically punching the elevator controls. He was in desperate need of a shower, his face grimy, his blonde hair a mess, his suit needing some heavy mending done.  And Tony, who followed him into the elevator car was equally debauched, though his armor he had left for decontamination wasn’t as heavily damaged.
“Never in a million years, Cap,” he said honestly. “But I’ve never been happier and eager about it,” he added, flicking his eyes down to Steve’s lips. He pulled Steve closer and pressed his lips to the blonde’s once more, drinking the man in like a parched man finding water. Feeling Tony’s mouth on his, the man’s rough hands caressing small circles in his lower back, and his facial hair scratching at his chin all felt just so good. Steve likened it to the feeling of falling asleep after a long grueling day. Kissing Tony was like looking at an old picture book, reminiscing on memories past. Loving Tony was feeling safe and protected, like a shroud that allowed Steve to finally let down his walls, where he could be vulnerable. With Tony, as his tongue sought entrance into Steve’s mouth and as he held him closely, Steve could simply be himself.
“And you don’t think we have that?” Tony inquired. He always felt that they did. Pepper made his heart flutter and swell constantly, and he thought he made her heart do the same thing.
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly as the genius kept looking at him, his warm eyes soft. Steve would be the first to admit that he was rather oblivious when it came to people showing interest in him. But the way Tony was watching him now, Steve was sure he’d seen that same expression on Tony’s face before, when he would look at Pepper, a gaze of awe and fondness.
“Speaking of beds, I think I am gonna hit the hay now.” Steve said, feigning a yawn. He beelined it for the little closet near the door where he found an extra blanket. “I will steal some of your pillows, though,” Steve said, grabbing a few out from under Tony’s head, laughing as we walked back to the couch.
Before Tony could respond to him though, Steve lifted off him, settling himself back fully on the man’s erection, working himself back into a rhythmic canter. The super soldier moaned dirtily, his hands tracing over his own thighs, up his belly and to his chest, pinching his pert nipples, rolling the sensitive, pale pink buds between his fingers. The genius let out a strangled gasp as he took in the sight of Steve touching himself intimately. Tony dropped his head back against the plush pillows, digging his fingers into Steve’s muscular thighs.
“What was that?” Nick inquired. “Nevermind, I don’t care. What the hell, Stark? You were supposed to be at the new S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters a half hour ago to discuss the new recruit program. And yet here I sit alone in my office.”
Tony could feel his erection straining against his jeans, the pressure just too painful to ignore. Not daring to look away from Steve caressing his body, Tony blindly unlatched his buckle the rest of the way from what the blonde had started earlier and undid his jeans. He almost fell off the bed in the process, getting the fabric over his knees before throwing them to the floor, belt buckle jingling.
But as Steve got older, technology and science progressed, especially during the turn of the century the idea of soulmates and soul bonds were seen as medieval or rather juvenile. If there was nothing to prove such bonding energy existed, how could it be so?
“Mhmm,” the blonde answered, digging his dull nails into Tony’s taut flesh as he lost himself in the moment of their love making.
“I guess so,” Steve laughed, looking down at his shirt. “I really liked this shirt too,” he added. Tony went to make a comment, but completely lost focus when Steve grabbed the hem of his shirt and hiked it over his head, revealing a firm sculpted chest and cut abs.
“Here,” Steve said, brushing his one side against Tony’s, grabbing up the spatula. The super solider flipped the omelet gracefully before taking the metal tongs on the granite counter and checking the bacon.
pine. “She needs her oil changed. Think you can manage that?” Tony forced a chuckle as he got up from the roller seat.
Steve went to push in his passcode to get inside, only for it to not work. Steve, confused, tried it once more, again not opening the door. “J.A.R.V.I.S?” Steve called, looking up at the ceiling though he knew that wasn’t where the A.I. was.
The blonde fell back against the length of the couch, pulling Tony with him as they continued to kiss passionately. Steve could feel Tony continue to caress at his hardened penis, and he most certainly wanted to reciprocate the act, having Tony experience that sweet friction as well.
Then he woke up almost 70 years later, with a date he never would be able to have with his beloved Peggy. It still pained him to think about her and the memories they shared. Hell, he had an issue with dwelling on the past in general. He didn’t mean to, didn’t mean for those thoughts to take away from him being in the present with Tony. Tony knew though, had understood why the memories harbored on Steve constantly. The man never berated him, never told Steve to just “get over it”, and that made Steve fall in love with him even more. Yes, he couldn’t deny the love and adoration he had for the man.
“What’re the chances you got a small mirror laying around?” Tony asked over his shoulder as he rummaged through Steve’s dresser. He quickly settled for Steve’s Stark pad, switching the camera around so it faced Steve when Tony settled back between the super soldier’s thighs. “This should do the trick,” Tony said then with a smirk, angling the device till Steve could see it clearly before leaning it against his knee.
“Tony,” Steve moaned out as the brunette inserted the seventh bead in, the pressure ripe, his hole taut from the growing bead size.
“Yeah? You want it harder, baby?” Tony huffed out, his eyes squeezing shut, his head tipping back while Steve tightened around him. Their bodies melded together as they made love, sweat forming in random droplets on their skin. The genius’s arc reactor lit the planes of Steve’s strapping back, the divots cast in shadow as the crests of muscles glowed in a pale blue light. He opened his eyes to see how Steve arched and shuttered as he reached his third climax of the evening, his soft moans pleasant to Tony’s ears.
Steve smiled as he reread the article, remembering how he had dreamed of finding his soulmate, someone who was his absolute perfect match. Someone who heightened his strengths, balanced his weaknesses and brought an inexplicable joy to his mind and soul. Steve reminisced of that yearning to provide such happiness for someone else, that he, a skinny, sickly man could be the perfect match to somebody, that he could give that almost etherial joy. During the war, and after Project Rebirth, Steve had believed Peggy was his soulmate. The connection they had, such kindred spirits in the world. She brought him so much joy, encouraged him and lifted him up when the world literally and figuratively crumbled around him. He was sure she was the one, his soulmate. He’d never felt such a connection with anyone before or since.
“Um, I think it’s a salmon. No wait, a big trout,” Steve corrected himself, looking proud for his knowledge of fish species. Tony just rolled his eyes and turned toward the counter. “What, I looked it up before we left,” Steve said, following behind him.
It was becoming rather strenuous to breathe, and Tony had to pull away from Steve’s lovely kisses, only to nuzzle against the super soldier’s shoulder.
“Would you just shut it for one damn second?” Tony asked, his voice soft, no anger in his tone. Steve looked at him with a surprised expression before drifting his gaze down to where their fingers intertwined. “That’s not why I got you this apartment and art studio,” Tony said, letting go of him then. He took hold of Steve’s chin and titled it so he met his eyes. “I did it because I knew you wanted a bigger art space. And because-” he saw Tony swallow thickly, his big doe eyes unwavering. “I’ve fallen in love with you too, Steve. And God, how I don’t want to see you move out of the Tower. Not one bit,” Tony confessed, his voice sounding a little shaky.
With one hand wrapped around Steve’s chest, he hooked the other one under the super soldier’s leg, hoisting it up so that the brunette could fuck the man harder and deeper. Tony changed his pace and pulsed his hips quickly, hitting deeply within his love with all he had.
“Hold on there, babe,” Tony said, his breathing light and airy. “I feel like we should talk about a few things,” he chuckled softly then, reaching for the container that held the intimate toy. “I can’t say I was expecting our love life to go down this route,” Tony began, biting his bottom lip and opening the box.
Tony, set down his tools and removed his safety spectacles before turning to see his personal assistant. “Hello Virginia,” The inventor smiled tiredly.
Steve and Tony settle some miscommunication errors as per usual with this couple XD and then sexy times.
Last week he had been so close to telling the blonde how he felt. When Steve asked him who he had fallen for, all Tony wanted to do was lean down and kiss the man breathless, letting his actions speak for themselves. And the way Steve asked him, so hopeful and big eyed. If it hadn’t been for Bruce hulking out, Tony was ready to tell Steve the truth, not worrying about the possible ramifications that would have followed suit. How Steve was under him, his cheeks red from the cold, his lips so pink and pouty, Tony had felt his breath leave him as his chest filled with an affectionate assortment of fluttering.
“I swear Steve, you and your hidden kinkiness is gonna be the death of me,” Tony replied, voice low and full of lust. He wiggled his boxers down then, letting them pool at his knees before sliding his Stark pad into his lap, giving Steve a clear view of his face, chest and hardening penis.
The man was not awake, and the sight of the super soldier, his friend... his soulmate like that overwhelmed Tony terribly to the point he had to sit down and remember how to breathe.
“Oh, no. I’ll take the couch,” Steve said lightly. In reality, he should be eager to sleep in the same bed as Tony. But that would make it all feel too real, and Steve didn’t want to deal with the disappointment of knowing it was only a one-time thing.
Steve sighed to himself then as he stirred a spoon in his coffee mug, watching as the cream dispersed and lightened the dark liquid to a light tan. A similar color to Tony’s taut and warm skin. Steve’s pout intensified then. Even something simple as a shade of brown reminded him of his boyfriend of five months.
As he became closer and closer to Tony’s lab floor, Steve attempted to will the hammering in his chest to calm down. Everything would be alright. He’d spent plenty of days just drawing or painting down in Tony’s lab while the brunette worked on things. This would be like any other day.
“That’s alright, Cap. But you’re more than welcome to stay down here. I’ll just be finishing up a few things on this beauty of mine,” Tony said, gesturing towards his car.
“Steve?” Tony asked, voice curious as he gazed his deep brown eyes down into the blonde’s ocean blue ones.
“What can I do for you, Obi?” Tony murmured as his overseeing advisor, Obadiah Stane approached him.
“I would have my mom tell me that story as much as possible, until she wanted to change it up. I guess I loved it because, growing up scrawny and an easy target, I would ask myself what would Brayan and Ferris do?”
Slipping out of his shirt then, Tony cradled Steve’s head in his hands, peppering little kisses all over the super soldier’s face. Steve giggled, his nose scrunching up from the way Tony’s beard tickled his sensitive skin.
“It’s okay, Bruce said softly, taking a few deep breaths. “I’d hope I could manage a few jump scares here and there,” he teased. “So, was there something you needed, Steve?”
After a moment, Steve pulled off completely, and he looked up at Tony with big doe eyes. The blonde’s tongue darted out along his red glistening lips, tasting the bit of precome that lingered upon them before moving back in and caressing the weeping head of Tony’s cock with the flat of his tongue. Before Tony could get used to that particular sensation though, Steve flicked just the tip of his tongue in against the wet slit of his lover’s swollen penis tauntingly.
The last file he gazed upon was of Anthony E. Stark, Howard’s son. He resembled him remarkably, appearance and personality wise. Steve heard of this great Tony Stark, the mind behind an amazing contraption known as the Iron Man suit. Tony, like his father, was a genius and also had quite the playboy record, self-centered...
“Captain Rogers appears to be in his quarters, reading a novel,” J.A.R.V.I.S said, his voice echoing through the lab. Tony was tempted to have J.A.R.V.I.S bring up the camera feed of Steve’s room, but he refrained. He’d vowed never to nose into anyone’s privacy unless it was an emergency. Tony stood then, his half eaten sandwich in hand. A part of him wanted to go up to Steve’s floor, to tell him thanks for the food, maybe Tony would actually be okay with seeing and talking to Steve. Maybe he was making mountains out of mole hills; it wouldn’t be the first time he had done that.
Slowly they fell to the mattress, kissing tiredly, Tony’s softening penis still inside Steve. He wasn’t ready to lose that contact with the brunette just yet, and so Steve didn’t pull away. He traced random patterns along Tony’s back, pulling away from the man’s lips to take some deeper breaths.
“Like I’d rather spend time there, when I could be with here with you,” Tony mumbled before lifting his head to meet Steve’s eyes. “We’re on a time limit now I guess, though.” Steve just smirked at him, an eyebrow quirking in a challenge.
They did not say a word as they reveled in their bond, their closeness unparalleled. They knew in their hearts and minds the hardships and challenges that would come their way. But Tony and Steve knew that they would have each other.
The entire scene was so mesmerizing and erotic that Tony was truly beside himself. The brunette’s breath hitched when he saw his boyfriend taking his thumb entirely into his mouth. He could feel Steve’s tongue swirling around the digit. The blonde knew exactly what he was doing, bewitching Tony with pleasure while the brunette resorted to palming at his clothed erection with his free hand.
It was Tony who finally pulled away, resting his forehead on Steve’s, catching his breath. “Holy shit, Steve. You’re so fucking lovely,” Tony breathed, a small chuckle escaping him as he drifted a hand into Steve’s hair.
The next morning, Tony grumbled as he rolled out of bed, bright and early. He wanted to catch Steve before he set out on his run and what not. Seriously, how could Steve get up so damn early? He didn’t care what the man said about how he is used to it from the military. Anything before 10am should be illegal.
Steve’s orgasm left him as limp as a wet towel…the blonde’s breath grew louder and quicker as he neared the metaphorical edge, his body sparking with tingling heat until a sharp cry left him. He came hard, his release dramatically spurting out in white, pearly ropes onto Tony’s bare belly and even onto the waistband of the genius’s trousers.
Shrugging off his coat, the blonde hung it neatly over the back of a chair in the nearby kitchen area and finally got his legs to cooperate. It wasn’t long before he was searching through the other rooms of the apartment, seeing the clean cut lines of a modern interior design.
Tony tossed the file on the table and followed suit. “Is that the only reason you’re glad to see me?” He teased, leaning against the counter. She didn’t answer him, her eyes focused on filling her Keurig. Tony frowned at that, deciding to fix his gaze somewhere else. Her apartment was really quite lovely, furnished to the nines. It wasn’t his penthouse, but it would do he guessed. Pepper seemed to have read his mind then, offering the black coffee to him before taking a sip of her own.
Steve had never felt anything quite like this before. Even when he and Peggy kissed, it wasn’t the same as this, what he was doing with Tony now. Everything about their kiss was tender and sweet, affectionate sighs or a soft moan escaping them as they focused on each other.
Tony ate Steve’s ass with vigor, loving the man’s wonderfully explicit moans as he did so. He swirled his tongue along the textured flesh of the inside of Steve’s cheeks before lowering his lips to suckle on the blonde’s testicles. He drifted one of his hands to Steve’s opening, rubbing at it with the pad of a finger as he continued to mouth at his sac.
At Tony’s new touch, Steve could feel his legs wobble, the pleasure just too overpowering. Tony must have noticed his body give slightly, for the brunette grabbed the chair he had sat on earlier and sat down once more, guiding Steve to sit on his lap.
The blonde observed how Tony’s face twisted in pleasure, his breath warm on Steve’s cheek as he panted and softly moaned with each pulse of his hips. The angle of Tony’s thrusts sent a wave of ecstasy through the super soldier’s body, his hard cock drooling and jerking between the men’s bellies.
“What is it?” Tony asked, his worried tone genuine. He could see that the blonde was upset, and Tony needed to know how to fix it. Steve sat up then, sitting cross legged on the bed. The brunette sat up too, waiting for Steve to speak.
“I love you too, Steve.” And man, did he truly mean it. Seeing Steve smile back at him showed how much the man knew it too.
Tony was circling him then, taking in every detail of his body, as if he hadn’t seen it all before. With the man’s eyes on him, and the fact that he was barely clothed and Tony was still fully dressed had Steve stirring below the waist, prominently seen under his silky panties. “Do you like this, Steve? Tony asked then, standing before Steve, their bodies close. “Do you like the vulnerability of this?” Steve nodded eagerly.
Did this all mean Steve had one too? Did he have a soulmark that itched and burned when he was around Tony? Tony didn't know. And he couldn’t really ask the man, could he? They were a personal, private matter.
“Yes, Steven?” Tony said casually while he continued to knead at the other pec and nipple with his fingers, rasping a nail over that glorious pink bud.
“The guy is from the 40’s. I mean, I’m not saying he’s a prude or anything. But I’d be shocked if he was gay or bi,” Tony said, as if it was common sense.
Steve’s sentimental thoughts left him then when he felt Tony start to slowly thrust into him, the tight drag in his channel sending ecstasy through his veins. His erection jerked under the slip, the fabric wet where the head leaked profusely as Tony rocked into him. Steve pushed back eagerly, wanting to feel full from his boyfriend’s gorgeous cock. He tilted his head up to find Tony’s lips, darting his tongue out to lick at the seam. When Tony opened his mouth up Steve licked into it, swiping his tongue against his love’s and basking in the heat there. Steve continued to kiss the man headily, simultaneously slipping his arms completely from the lingerie straps, and pushing the fabric down around his waist, exposing his pecs completely.
“Impeccable. So damn impeccable, baby,” Tony said, holding him and kissing the man’s temple. “You liked it, I could tell. Especially when I guided you,” Tony whispered. Reaching a hand to turn Steve’s face so that the super soldier was looking at him. Tony smiled faintly before leaning in to lick at the bit of come that still wetted Steve’s bottom lip.  Steve chased after his lips then, capturing them in a searing kiss as he maneuvered over Tony once more. The genius hissed and took in a breath when one of Steve’s thighs brushed against his abandoned erection then, the blonde pulling back quickly.
“Holy shit,” the brunette hissed out, feeling Steve’s entrance clench at the adjustment of Tony deeply inside him. Tony opened his eyes at the gentle ragged breaths that left Steve’s parted lips, the intensity of the sudden heat and connection of his boyfriend leaving the blonde keening.
So, grabbing up the chocolate sauce once more, Steve drizzled it along the lower half of Tony’s spine, the sauce slithering between the brunette’s ass cheeks and over his opening.
Tony swallowed the guilt though, opening the door to see one of his favorite sandwiches, fruit and a glorious cup of coffee. He smiled, knowing how Steve would do this a lot when he meandered down to the lab. One strong arm would be filled with a sketchbook and supplies, the other holding food or a cup of coffee for Tony.
Tony began licking at the hollows of Steve’s collarbone before he nosed further down to Steve’s clothed pecs, mouthing at the bow on the lingerie. He then glided his tongue over to a pink nipple that hid beneath the lace. Steve gasped, rocking up when Tony flicked at the rosy bud under the fabric tauntingly. The super soldier looked dazedly at his boyfriend diligently working at his chest, loving the gentle tease of the genius’s mouth.
“Tony, I-I’m gonna come,” Steve whined, his eyes closed as he arched into Tony’s touch when he pulled and plucked at his reddening nipples with calloused fingers.
With a heavy sigh, Tony looked up at the ceiling, as if it would hold the insight he needed. Putting himself in Steve’ shoes, he could see how his actions would have made Steve feel as if Tony wanted nothing to do with him. Especially because they confided in each other about a lot of things. It would have made anyone feel a sense of self-doubt, even Steve. He needed to make things right with him, to apologize. Not for their argument, because he was still miffed about Steve being reckless. But for making the man feel like Tony didn’t want to be around him and for being so distant. Even if Tony had good intentions for it, that didn’t change how he made Steve feel.
Tony was too late, and when that slimy alien wedged a foreign metal spear into the super soldier's chest, Tony felt every pain the blonde did.
“Yeah, sorry about the one bed thing.” Tony said, sideling up to him. “I mean, it’s a big enough bed for both of us, I think. But if that would make you uncomfortable I can sleep on the couch there,” he suggested, pointing toward a brown striped couch by the TV,
They ate breakfast together, Steve doing most of the cooking while Tony prepped coffee and put bread in the toaster. “So besides paperwork, do you have anything else going on?” Tony asked while munching on that crispy bacon Steve made so well.
"Well," Bruce began, fiddling with his lab coat. "That's the thing about soulmates. They were developed as a survival characteristic in primitive times. But that trait still lives on even in modern times. And with that is love, reliability..." Bruce trailed off before continuing. "It makes perfect sense that Steve and you would be soulmates." Bruce gave a small smile, patting Tony on the back. "It might seem inconvenient now, but in time you'll see why you are destined for one another."
“Wanna have you ride me, if that’s alright,” Tony murmured while he helped Steve take a seat on him. Steve smiled brightly, nodding his approval of the position as he lined himself up with Tony’s erection.
Quirking an eyebrow then, Steve went to the door, opening it slowly, not even thinking to check the peep hole. This would be the first time since the day a SHIELD agent took him to this apartment, that Steve had a visitor.
Steve was beside himself with the pleasure and love coursing through his veins for Tony. He wanted to help Tony relax from the stressful days he was having, yes. But Steve loved Tony’s domineering behavior in the bedroom too, loved it more than he probably should admit. He was slightly ashamed by it for reasons he never wanted to reveal. But Tony knew him better than anyone, and for as long as they’d been together, Steve had no doubt that Tony picked up on his preferences during their love making. So when Tony said what he wished for Steve to do, the blonde was ever so eager to do it, to be commanded by his lover, to please Tony in all the ways he knew how.
But then, Tony moved away completely, standing to his feet, causing Steve to look at him with a frustrated and confused expression. “Wha-what’re you-”
Tony’s elbows bracketed Steve’s head, one of his knees between the blonde’s legs. He stared down at Steve, his dewy brown eyes locking with his. Steve couldn’t look away, his azure eyes searching for something, wishing for all the things he wanted to tell Tony could be simply said in his gaze. The snow had begun to fall gently, peppering Steve’s hair and lashes.
Steve sighed, though smiling and leaned back on his heels. “Someone’s rather hasty, aren’t they? He asked rhetorically. The genius went to speak, only for his boyfriend to put a finger over his mouth and gently push him back against the multitudinous pillows that were wedged against the headboard of the bed.
“Yeah, I’m okay,” Steve said, smiling sheepishly at Tony through his long lashes. How the man could be so cute and sweet, while at the same time looking like a sex god was beyond Tony’s brilliant mind. He only knew that he was grateful that he could call Steve his. “Whenever you’re ready,” Steve huffed then, shifting his weight on Tony’s length, clenching his muscles around it. Tony gritted his teeth, moaning softly and squeezing his love’s ass. “It’s about you today, Tony.”
“I’m glad you’re happy,” he remarked, clearing his throat and peering into his cup. He felt silly being here. Yeah, he wanted to see Pepper, to see her in a new light, as a friend. And yet, there had been something inside him that thought that when they saw each other, there would be a rekindling, a revelation on Pepper’s part, where she would realize that they were the ones for each other, the perfect piece to Tony’s puzzle.
He weaved about the city, swooping low and flying close to the Hudson River, the water spraying around him. Tony let out a gleeful laugh, taking to the sky and soaring like Icarus, as close to the sun as he could. Here, Tony wasn’t labeled a genius, billionaire, philanthropist…and he guessed now playboy. Here he was just Tony, a guy who liked to tinker.
“Please what?” Tony smiled deviously, leaning in close to kiss the man’s opening. Steve practically whined, his body shaking from the pent up anticipation.
Steve finally reached his floor, and it was then that he felt like he could breathe again. Steve flopped on his couch, burrowing his face in a pillow. The blonde had a swirling of confusion in his mind and heart. His reaction to seeing Tony worried him, the gut feeling and heat blindsiding him. He reacted like when he had first laid eyes on Peggy, his heart beating quickly, his chest tight with butterflies. Seeing Tony down in his lab, his brown eyes almost a glow with the natural lighting from the westward windows, and his easy smile as he looked at Steve intently. Thinking about it now made the super soldier swallow thickly, his cheeks blushing. it didn't make sense, for Steve never noticed these features on Tony before, at least not in a way that the blonde thought to be as attractive characteristics.
He turned on his side, eyeing up the empty space next to him where Pepper once slept. They had been through so much together, and now the woman he believed he would marry was gone. Because of Steve.
“C’mere,” Tony cooed, brushing a heavy hand in Steve’s hair before he prompted the super soldier closer to him. The blonde crawled up the brunette’s body, laying against Tony lovingly. Steve laid his head on the man’s chest, his cheek nestled on the one side of Tony’s arc reactor.
“I’m holding you to it then,” Steve grinned coyly before sinking back into a loving kiss with his beloved.
A faint noise caught the blonde’s attention and he quickly turned back onto his main mission. If there was any sign of human activity or presence, Steve needed to report back to his director. He saw nothing gliding on the water though. But the sound had come again, only closer, and without warning, splashing water erupted next to him. Steve jerked back, his hands raised in defense. He calmed though when he realized it was only a fellow mermaid.
“That’ll never happen, Steve. Ya can’t get rid of me that easily,” Tony chuckled, sighing deeply and sinking into the pillows behind him. Steve just smiled at him, his expression glowing. “So are we good then?”
his body being neglected to the pleasurable desire that flowered within him. If he’d been with anyone but Steve, Tony would have been spent to completion by now. But Tony would praise Steve’s body, leaving himself to be second priority. The brunette’s mind only focused on the blonde in those moments.
“Thank you, so very much,” Steve said, his voice less pained. “My, I must sound like a repetitive tune,” Steve lamented, shaking his head. “I feel like I am rather a burden to you and-”
“I appreciate and accept your apology. Thank you,” Steve said, looking to Tony with a close-lipped smile. And it was then that Tony knew that they would be alright.
“That damn fish ate my bait,” Tony huffed with a pout. He heard Steve laugh, shutting his mouth quickly when Tony glowered at him, though there was no real malice behind it.
Tony was grabbing the cushions on the couch so hard that Steve was sure he would tear the thick woven fabric. The brunette pushed back against his face, attempting to bury Steve’s tongue as deeply as it could get.
Once Steve was done cleaning up his boyfriend, he kissed a trail up and over the man’s clavicle, to his neck, nipping at a sinewy tendon there before finally brushing Tony’s nose with his own, chuckling sweetly. “How was that?” He asked then, snuggling his face into the side of Tony’s neck.
After the speech and tribute video to Peggy played, Steve and Tony meandered to the side of the room, hanging out by the glass wall as they waited for Sharon. “That was a lovely thing they did for Peggy,” Steve started, placing his hands in his pockets as he searched the crowd.
“God, he’s adorable,” Tony said, reaching over to open up the one panel that acted as a door. “Are you lost?” Tony asked teasingly, a remarkable grin on his face as he looked up at his beloved.
“Good, I don’t want it to,” Tony said, leaning down and bringing his hands up to cup Steve’s face. “Everyone can see it and be so jealous over the fact that I have the greatest, most gorgeous and kindest man as my soulmate,” Tony expressed, resting his forehead on Steve’s before giving him a loving kiss there.
“You know I do,” the super soldier assured him, placing a hand affectionately over where Tony’s fingers had stopped on Steve’s tricep. God, how that made Tony’s heart flip with fondness, hearing Steve’s pure love and trust he had in Tony. How honored it had the genius feeling. With little direction, Tony maneuvered Steve till the blonde was sitting, straddling Tony’s chest, his back to the brunette.
“Steve!” he heard Tony yell in the communication devices they wore in their ears. Though it was dank within the monster’s mouth, its breath putrid and heavy, the super solider didn’t hesitate to battle. Steve went for the creature’s jaws, beating it with his shield, breaking its teeth with each hit. When the beast finally opened its mouth once more, eliciting a pained screech, Steve hurdled himself upwards, shield held above his head as he smashed the creatures upper jaw, unhinging it from the mandible. With its jaw hanging loosely, the creature thrusted back, causing Steve to lose his footing. The super soldier fell back, falling fifty stories as he watched the tops of buildings become smaller with each passing moment. He prepared himself for impact before his body was suddenly jarred, and his back hit something that was solid, and metal. Looking down to see two metal arms wrapped around his torso, Steve then turned his head to see the Iron Man faceplate looking at him, cold and calculating.
Smiling, Steve looked down at himself. “It’s one of my favorites, Tony,” he said, his tone filled with honesty. Tony had surprised him with a beautiful, navy lace bralette. The straps were made of a fine, silky cream fabric with a matching bow at the center of the lingerie. And underneath the bow embellishment were three small buttons, the closures in the front. The blonde loved how the fabric hugged his firm pecs, his nipples playing peek-a-boo underneath the lacey fabric covering them.
“Yeah, actually,” Steve admitted, appreciating their smooth texture on his skin. “But I think you like me partially clothed while you fuck me,” he added, using a bit of dirty language because he knew Tony liked to hear it.
With the last tiny bead barely grazing one side of Steve’s rim, and Tony’s other hand tugging at his erection, Steve came with a sharp moan, his head falling back against the mountain of pillows, his body arching further into his boyfriend’s touch. White come squirted up his chest and belly as a tear filled the air.
Tony pulled away then, and Steve gave a small whine, chasing his boyfriend’s lips greedily. Tony chuckled and relented, giving his love another quick kiss.
On Christmas morning, the team exchanged their Secret Santas, and Tony felt a childlike nostalgia creep within his chest at the gathering merriment. All the presents were resting under the large tree, and the genius searched the tags till he found the small parcel with his name on it. Instantly, he recognized the neat penmanship, knowing that it was his beloved Steve who was his Secret Santa.
“Yes, more of that, baby,” Tony huffed out. He was so caught up in watching Steve he hadn’t noticed he was almost rubbing his penis raw with his tight strokes. So, he let up, dropping his hand to his perineum and massaging his prostate from the outside. And wow, did that feel good. He went back to fondling his balls with his other hand while he focused back on Steve who was watching Tony’s fingers press into his skin.
Tony also knew that he couldn’t keep living this way, couldn’t keep on wearing this platonic façade when he was around Steve. So, he decided he would lay everything on the table with the man when he got back from this gala. Even if Steve didn’t reciprocate the same feelings, they’d be able to get through it. He just couldn’t lie to himself anymore. He needed to admit how he truly felt to Steve. Tony wasn’t one to shy away from things before, and he had no plans on doing that now.
Steve sat his gym bag in one of the closets in his apartment before spotting a debriefing packet on his kitchen table. The blonde made himself a cup of coffee on the stove before settling himself in a chair to review the mission to retrieve the tesseract. There would be other members involved on this mission, Steve realized as he thumbed through the different profiles in the file. They were all rather fascinating figures. There was a lovely red headed woman who had an impressive record with SHIELD, as well as a man who could turn into a gigantic, green and muscular being.
Hooking those fingers deeply inside Steve, finding the man’s prostate. Tony rubbed at those sensitive nerves, his other hand slipping beneath Steve and to his chest, his forefinger and thumb rolling and tugging at one of the man’s nipples.
“Anthony,” A gruff voice called out to the brunette, Tony turned lazily in the voice’s direction, his eyes still scanning over his documents.
“You liking that, Steve?” Tony said, humming against Steve’s skin, his breath warm against one of the blonde’s nipples.
“Natasha and Clint are on board, as well as Tony and Thor. Bruce decided to sit this one out. You know how congested environments make him uneasy,” she explained, pausing in front of the open door. “Steve,” she said uncertainly then. “Do you notice anything odd about Tony lately?” She asked, a brow arched. Steve only huffed a laugh. Yeah, he most certainly did notice. The man had been standoffish and blatantly avoiding him for over a month, right after that damn party. It bothered Steve, really bothered him, seeing how Tony’s personality had changed so drastically. Steve had tried over and over to converse with the guy, to pretend that he didn’t notice the change in Tony. And every time he walked down to the man’s lab with a book or sketchbook in hand, only for J.A.R.V.I.S to tell him that Tony didn’t want company, he had pretended to act like it didn’t bother him at all. Steve desperately wanted to believe that they were still the close friends that he thought they were, regardless of Tony’s irritation and distance.
With one last nip to Steve’s bottom lip, he felt Tony move back, causing Steve to open his eyes and take a few regulating breaths. Tony literally took his breath away, and he could feel his cheeks and neck rather flushed. He couldn’t help but grin hard, watching as Tony did the same.
"Hey, Cap," Tony bit out, clearly trying to disregard his own pain. It confirmed everything for Steve, however.
Everything came to a beautiful end when Steve looked down to see Tony staring up at him, his tongue licking a stripe up the underside of the engorged vein before engulfing Steve once more. Steve could see Tony’s lips red and stretched around him, glistening from saliva and precome. It was the sight of his handsome boyfriend, and the pleasurable pain from the man’s nails that threw Steve over the edge, his orgasm practically blindsiding him as he came in Tony’s mouth. He felt the man swallow around him, drinking down the white ropes of come like it was no big deal.
"I see your attention has been captured elsewhere," she grinned before getting off the blonde and helping him up.
Once he felt that Steve would be more than ready, Tony coated his erection with lube and lined himself up with his love’s opening. Steve felt the other man nudged up against his backside, and so, he brought his one leg up and bent it at the knee, bracing his foot on the bed for leverage.
Slumping against the bed and cushions, Steve felt both weightless and like lead, that lovely ache settling in his bones from coming once again. The genius crawled over him, his solid chest flush with Steve’s sweaty back, the arc reactor ever so slightly cooler and feeling perfect against the super soldier’s skin.
Tony was away on business for a week, and though Steve was sad not to be near his love, it was that article and photograph that really threw him for a loop. The super soldier was devastated by it. Each time he tried to call or text his boyfriend, the connection would be dropped or lost. Steve was a mess to say the least. Natasha tried to explain to Steve that photos like the one in the NEWS always try to make something out of nothing, and that he really shouldn’t worry.
“What about Anthony Stark-Rogers,” Steve countered, peppering Tony’s face with little kisses. Tony giggled at the affection, loving every minute of it.
They watched the film in mostly silence, sometimes one of the men whispering a comment or two. Steve had an arm wrapped around Tony’s arm, the brunette’s head resting against Steve’s shoulder as the scene played on the gigantic screen. Everything was pleasant and sweet, until Steve felt one of Tony’s hands casually drift to his upper leg, resting it there, only to caress his thigh slowly. It was a gesture that shouldn’t have been a big deal, but the warmth of Tony’s hand was seeping into Steve’s denim covered leg. And soon enough, Steve was heightened to everything that was Tony, the soft noises of his breathing, the press of his cheek on Steve’s shoulder.
Making his way back to the tower, Steve went straight to Tony’s penthouse, eager to see the man. He found the genius spreading the carry out containers on the table in the living room. The movie list on the TV already up and waiting for them to pic from.
Hearing Steve gasp, his voice a sweet melody caused Tony to come back to the present, focusing once more on making Steve thrum with pleasure. The genius caressed Steve’s rim a few more times before finally pushing his digit entirely inside the blonde, appreciating the snug fit of the beautiful man’s body.
The couple kissed languidly, their spent bodies tangled together amongst crumpled dirty sheets. Steve nuzzled into Tony’s neck, the brunette finally slipping his fingers free from his love as the ring of muscle relaxed. There was nothing to be said for a while, the brunette and blonde soaking in each other’s presence.
“Alright, give me an hour and I’ll be there,” Tony said, his eyes never leaving Steve’s lovely blue ones. He felt the super soldier’s hands on the waistline of his boxers, slowly dipping underneath to grab at Tony’s bum. It was his turn to hitch a breath, biting his lip to not let out a sound.
“I still see the ship that took him,” Steve began again, eyes falling closed. The gold insignia on the ship was etched in his mind, the octopus like tentacles that crawled out from underneath a crimson skull.
“I guarantee you’ll fail miserably if you tried to set us up,” Steve laughed, looking at Tony with an easy smile. “Why do you ask though? Has someone new come along that you’ve grown fond of?” Steve asked then, and Tony couldn’t even lie to him. He looked up at the blonde and nodded, smiling sheepishly. “Oh, who’s the lucky lady? Steve inquired, smiling, though Tony could see that it didn’t meet his blue eyes. The brunette just brushed the question off. What would be the point of revealing his affections when clearly Steve was infatuated with another?
Steve was plagued with more dreams, and even voices. Women talking, or men chattering. Visions would pepper his sight too. It was actually inhibiting his sleep and work, and his soul mark went aflame when Tony was around. Steve knew what that meant of course. But he was honestly terrified to talk to Tony. Not because of Tony, but for what the man would say, and the probable rejection that would come with it. Steve just had to bite the bullet and tell Tony of the dreams, the mark and... his feelings for the brunette. Soulmates aside, choice or not, Steve knew in his heart and mind that he felt the most content with Tony. He was truly joyful and whole side by side with the genius.
“Yes. Of course, Tony,” Steve said, his voice strong. Tony beamed at that, and to affirm his promise, Steve claimed the man’s rosy lips once more, kissing the brunette headily.
“I didn’t see it that way. There were other lives at stake. You ignore our tactical plans just to be difficult.” Steve replied. “I knew I would be fine.”
“Lavender?” the genius asked, making sure Steve was positive on his choice. The blonde nodded assuredly.
Maria was there, in a navy sheath dress, a Stark tablet in hand and waiting for him. “Good morning, Maria,” Steve said, taking the tablet in hand. “Is everyone accounted for?” He asked, looking over the information as they walked toward the aircraft.
“He saved millions of lives and helped the Allies win the war...” Fury continued on, basically throwing Steve Rogers’ profile at the brunette. Tony pursed his lips together and took the papers irritatedly in hand. He looked at the picture of a man he had idolized growing up, the man he had wanted to be...the man who had all of Howard’s attention.
“Of course, this is truly beautiful, what we have together, how we are right now.” The super soldier leaned up to kiss Tony on the brow before resting his own forehead on the genius’s. his hands fell to Tony’s ass, his fingers digging into each clothed cheek. The brunette groaned out, unable to stop himself from pressing his hard length and hips against his lover.
It was as if the couple could not be close enough together. Leaning forward as they continued to kiss fervently, Tony guided Steve back against the unkempt sheets, the blonde’s nightie bunching up at his hips. Steve went back easily, his knees moving up to bracket the brunette’s sides, his feet hooking at the divot in Tony’s lower back.
Sweat pooled at Tony’s hairline, the reactor light brightening the brunette’s strong features. His brown eyes were overpowered by blown pupils, never leaving Steve’s face as he stood between the man’s legs.
“I will,” he smiled, and with that, they’d said their goodbyes. Looking at his sketch once more, Steve huffed a breath. That last lead had seemed so promising. And yet, they ended up dry.
“A lover’s quarrel is never an easy on,” the janitor said, adjusting his glasses and putting the broom into his rolling cart. “Best go get back in his good graces.” Tony exhaled loudly, moving out of the closet and closing the door.
He plopped down on one of the plush cushions on the couch, nestling the coffee mug in his hands as he settled in. He didn’t want to watch TV, didn’t even want to begin the sketch that sat next to him on the middle cushion he had put there earlier. Even if he did try to draw, it would more than likely end up being some variant of Tony, his eyes or hands. Two parts of Tony Steve absolutely adored. Granted he loved every bit of Tony, but there was just something so captivating in Tony’s warm and dewy chocolate eyes. And his hands were rough from inventing, yet they were so gentle and delicate when he touched Steve, as if he was something precious to the brunette. That made the blonde blush in fondness before finally taking a sip at his coffee. Strong and creamy. Perfect.
“Yes,” Steve said simply, bringing his own hands up to undo the rest of the latches for Tony. He slid the designer shirt off of Tony’s sculpted shoulders, revealing his arc reactor which cast them in a pale blue lighting.
“You won’t,” she replied quickly, regaining her composure before pulling away slightly from their swaying motions. “I’ll always be your CEO, as well as your dear friend. You’ve always been my family.”
As they sat in companionable silence, Steve thought how nice it was. How a woman so reserved as Natasha found trust in him, and would allow him to be so close in friendship. He never took it for granted, that he knew for sure.
“Clearly the merman being brought on deck was a peculiar incident. We have him below deck being cleaned up,” Stane smiled down at the younger man, acting like the step-in father he vowed to be for Tony when Howard passed away.
“But you never make me feel confined or smothered, Steve,” Tony added. “I hope I never make you feel that way.” Tony could never get enough of his love. Hell, he had his moments where all he wanted to do was work in the lab. But he’d drop that in a heartbeat for Steve. He watched the blonde’s features soften then as he took in Tony’s honest words.
It was then that the elevator pinged, the doors opening to Tony’s lab, and Steve had the sudden urge to head right back from where he came. No, he wouldn’t let his emotions consume him, he was better than that. He’d give Tony the food and coffee, ask if all was well and remain casual. He could do this.
He was ready to start on sketching the creek itself when his phone rang. Searching for it in the pockets of his jacket, Steve saw that Natasha was attempting to video chat with him.
Arriving to the bar area of the ballroom, Tony asked the bartender for a glass of scotch, stuffing a fifty-dollar bill into the tip jar while he waited. There was an overhead announcement being made then, stating that a speech would be starting on the north side of the room in roughly fifteen minutes.
“God, Tony,” Steve huffed out as he pushed back, searching for his love’s finger to fill him. “Want you in me,” he choked out, looking back at the brunette with a lusty gaze. And hell, if that look right there didn’t go straight to Tony’s already hard erection. He really couldn’t wait to take Steve, but seeing the man all hot and bothered really made him ache so sweetly. Playing with the man’s rim with the rough pad of his finger, Tony spread Steve’s cheeks with the other hand, watching as his rosy pink hole tried to clench around him.
“Malt balls! My favorite!” Tony exclaimed, looking to Steve with boyish excitement as he grabbed a handful and started to munch on them.
Tony was absolutely beside himself as he neared the edge. He was reclined in the chair now, his head slumped forward as he gazed at Steve. He’d only looked away when the beauty of Steve giving him wonderful, wet bliss became too much, and he closed his eyes, steadying himself.
Continuing on then, Tony pushed the sixth bead into Steve, who sighed at the now pleasurable pressure within him. He could feel the toy now deeper in his channel, the ecstasy building up the coil in his belly. His erection was fully swelled, the white precome seeping from the fat mushroom tip.
“You want more, baby?” Tony purred, leaning in to nose at Steve’s bum, his lips barely grazing over the deep curve of a cheek. By the way the blonde wriggled above him and ran his hands over the genius’s bent knees, Tony figured that was a yes. And so, the brunette did just that, biting at the blonde’s ass gently as he started pushing the rest of his fingers into the other man.
“Yes,” he breathed,” lungs raspy. Tony smiled, tenderly lifting the bandage to see Bruce’s steady stitching of the merman’s wound. It was clean and looked very good considering a spear had been thrusted into the sea creature’s side. Tony was also surprised by how quickly Steve was indeed healing. The wound was sutured closed, but the flesh already began to stitch itself closed, a puckered red line trailing down the merman’s side and to his scaly hip bone.
So, I guess if this story followed the movie timelines... it would kinda take place between Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron.
“God I love you,” Steve whispered, his breath a kiss of warmth. Tony smiled, his eyes closed, dark lashes fluttering against the crest of Steve’s cheekbone. The genius’s hands slid around Steve’s waist, pulling the super soldier closer to him till he was basically sitting in Tony’s lap.
Tony hissed out a groan, his fingernails digging into Steve’s sides. “Feels good doesn’t it?” The blonde asked smugly, watching Tony’s face wash over with ecstasy.
Lathering his hair, Steve could hear through the hum of the shower the brunette’s voice, deep and resonating. How nice it would be to have Tony in here with him. Steve imagined they’d wash each other’s hair, Tony’s thick, dark tresses white and soapy in his fingers. They would take turns washing each other’s bodies, their skin taut and slippery. Steve’s hands would glide over Tony’s sinewy muscles as his hands trailed down his back…
Kneeling down, Tony wiped the man’s strong thighs, pressing a kiss to the inside of each one before tracing the cloth down the rest of his legs. “You doing okay, Stevie?” He asked, standing to cleanse the man’s gorgeously broad back.
"Steve," Natasha cooed, her pale hand resting on his shoulder. "You're alright. You're okay here." Steve looked at her with big eyes, brows furrowed with confusion and reflection. They'd must have thought he'd had a memory of the war. Sam also told him he was back on U.S. soil and with friends. Steve didn’t correct them, and he was truly grateful for their kindness and support. But he didn’t want to tell them about the vision of these past people, and his emotional connection to them. Soulmates and all its new proof still was a skeptical ideal to many folks. Steve didn’t feel the need to really tell anyone. It all didn’t mean anything anyway.
“Kate?” Steve said, a confused look on his face. No, that wasn’t her name. What did Natasha say it was? “What’re you doing here?” He queried then.
“D-don’t you even think about it, Stark,” Steve warned breathily, trying to sound authoritative, but failing miserably.
Sorrowfully, Steve turned back to the car, sitting back down on the roller seat again. He felt foolish for what happened. But he wasn’t paying any mind when he realized he struck the Howard nerve with Tony. Maybe that was why Tony bolted, he was probably pissed at Steve, and he had every right to be. Steve knew better by now not to bring up Howard. It was his fault, and now he wished there was away he could make it up to his friend. Steve was just so preoccupied with wallowing in self-pity underneath that car, thinking about the lucky dame who would soon be the center of Tony’s attention.
“You look great, Steve,” Natasha assured him, smoothing out his jacket lapels and adjusting his military decorations. “You know, Tony’s going to be there,” she added then, the one side of her mouth curving into a smirk as she looked at him.
“Tell him, I’m busy,” Tony said, rubbing circles into Steve’s clothed thighs, soothing the muscles there. Steve elicited sweet spent noises, his head foggy from his climax.
“I can find my own apartment. Save your money on all of this. I’ll be sure to move out by the end of the week,” Steve remarked, starting for the door. He tried to brush past Tony, only for the man to block him, grabbing his hand.
“Now, you just let me clean you all up,” Steve said with a wink, wiggling down Tony’s body. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s hip before he began lapping at his own come that littered the brunette’s abdomen. It was a little weird, eating his own seed up. But knowing that it would bring Tony pleasure watching him do it made him eager to keep going. He slid his tongue up the man’s body like a dog lapping at water, looking up at Tony while doing so.
The need for his boyfriend was far too great then, and Steve pushed back till the engorged tip of Tony’s cock slipped inside of him. Tony took the initiative the rest of the way, quickly sheathing himself inside the super soldier.
The two stars Steve references are Betelgeuse which burns reddish and the other is Rigel, which burns bluish. The constellation they are a part of is Orion, the Hunter.
Tony held up the blonde’s lingerie panties then, arching a dark brow. “This would have been a tough one to explain,” he said, and the two of them giggled again before Steve snatched the garment from the brunette’s hand.
“Of course,” Steve said, giving a kiss to the top of the genius’s shoulder. A low perk sounded on the other counter, and Steve turned his attention to the coffee pot beginning to drip deep brown liquid into the glass carafe.
“The days you’re here working on art or what not,” Tony started, brushing his thumb over Steve’s knuckles. “Would you come back to the tower at night? I know you don’t see it as home, but… I really like having you close,” Tony admitted a little sheepishly.
“Mister Stark,” Steve interjected then, concern swelling in his chest. By the way Tony was speaking, it made things sound as if Steve would be on this boat permanently, and that could not happen. “I really must return to my pod. They will wonder where I have gone,” Steve explained, feeling a raspy scratch wrack inside his lungs.
“Are you really refusing a Christmas present?” Tony asked lightly, taking a step into the room then. “I wanted you to have this.” Steve looked behind him at all the wonderful art supplies and studio space. It was a lovely, generous gift, something almost too good to be true. Steve’s mind flooded to his earlier thoughts, that Tony had found him a place so that Steve could get the hell out of the Tower and as far away from the genius as possible. It made his heart feel like lead. That must be what this was. Tony most likely didn’t want to hurt Steve’s feelings, and so he found this apartment as a “Christmas gift”, a passive aggressive notion for Steve to start packing.
Steve and Tony cuddled under the fluffy blanket, burrowing together cozily as their body temperature regulated to the atmosphere. The genius took Steve’s wrist in his hand and lifted it from the covers. Tony admired the gold ring on the super soldier’s hand, watching the band shine in the natural light that peeked into the room. Steve watched Tony a minute, beaming at the happiness that danced inside his heart. Tony turned to look at the blonde then, smiling too before pressing a sweet kiss to that gold ring, his eyes never leaving Steve’s.
Maybe, just maybe, his unwarranted affections for Steve would dissipate, and all would be as it had been once Tony waded through the confusion. Surely, he didn’t love Steve that way. Tony tried to justify the feelings being nothing more than the aftershocks of their deepening emotional connection on the trip. Plus, he was still newly dumped, and there was no way he was over
“I’m sorry,” Pepper finally said, her voice cracking a little as she looked up at Tony with so much sorrow in her eyes. God, what had he done to her?
“Yeah, that might be,” Tony replied, yawning widely before working his way under the bed covers. “But I could tell you liked the idea of being watched. Having my eyes on you while you fucked yourself to oblivion and touched those gorgeous nipples of yours.” He watched Steve blush profusely, his softened cock becoming rather attentive by Tony’s words. “See?” Tony said, smirking.
Pepper appeared then, opening the glass door with a smile. Lifting his faceplate, Tony greeted her with his own cheeky grin. It was the first time they’d seen each other since the party. And seeing her standing there, her hair unruly from sleep, her eyes puffy from tiredness, she still took his breath away.
Steve did as he was told, scooching up till his head hit the plush pillows. Tony crawled up toward him predatorily, and Steve’s penis jerked to attention for the third time that day, thinking of Tony owning him, claiming him that way.  Tony knelt between his spread legs then, pushing his knees up to his chest. “Hold them open,” Tony instructed, and Steve obliged eagerly, hitching his arms under his stockinged knees, splaying them wide open for Tony, who hummed in approval of the view.
Steve took a few moments to find his composure, his body gaining its feeling once more. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s chest before bringing his hands up to start undoing the man’s belt and zipper.
“Did I do well with picking out this lingerie?” Tony asked softly, using his fingertips to trace random patterns along the silk covering Steve’s rump.
They went to shower, Steve making sure to clean the mirror from the white mess he made first. When they readied for bed, the men stopped, looking at the poor comforter.
Tony began their pace, planting his feet in the mattress as he gently rocked up into his lover. It took a mere moment before Steve fell into a cadence with Tony, their bodies moving as one, their soft moans like that of a harmonious symphony.
light, rather than platonic friends. I thought the feelings would go away, that it was just Pepper’s voice echoing in my subconscious. But, Rhodes, it’s been weeks and they haven’t subsided,” Tony said. His friend just looked at him with sympathy. “I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” Tony sounded defeated, swirling a fry into his ketchup.
“Ahh! Steve!” Tony hissed out between clenched teeth, the sudden heat of his lover’s mouth intoxicating and overwhelming. He was going to propose Steve ride him, but the blonde seemed to have other ideas in mind. And Tony had no intention of telling the super soldier to stop.
“Evening, Natasha,” Steve smiled, peering at his beautiful friend, her long red hair curling like tendrils over her shoulders as well as on the watery surface.
“We’ve got to make a decision about this business deal, son. This possible new client could be just what we need to get Stark Weaponry in the European market,” Obadiah explained. And when Tony continued to look at the business documents in his hand, the older man snatched the papers from the brunette so that Tony would look at him.
, my love, are the most important thing to me,” the brunette smiled, taking that gold band in hand and holding it in presentation to the dumbfounded super soldier. “Steve…you’ve been my best friend for so long, even when we got together, our bond of friendship only grew,” Tony began, his eyes flicking from the ring that he had between his fingers and Steve’s blushing face. “You are the one that gives breath to my spirit and light to my soul. You are my partner, my confidant. How I have ever known life before you entered it is beyond comprehension,” the genius expressed, his dark gaze now fixed with Steve’s.
“The bottle with the thick brown liquid?” Steve said, voice a bit strangled as Tony played with his ass. He drifted his hands up and down Tony’s strong back, enjoying the firm muscle there.
, love?” Tony hooked his fingers inside him, tugging at his loose rim, wet and throbbing with need, causing Steve to gasp, his breath ragged, hole clenching around Tony’s lithe digits.
“Steve, I wanna try a new position,” he suggested. And before Steve could pout, Tony continued. “Just for your second orgasm. I won’t come till I face you, I promise. I just, wanna try something a little different,” Tony said, smiling sweetly at Steve.
“Morning everyone,” Steve greeted, opening the screen on his tablet and, with the help from Natasha, projecting the images onto a holographic screen for all to see. “Were headed for Queens,” Steve began, playing the newsfeed of what they were getting into. An image of a large beast that kind of looked like a dragon of the ancient world appeared. It was a live feed, showing the creature terrorizing the borough.
“I know. But he really should focus on his meetings. Pepper made it clear how crucial they were for both Tony and Stark Industries,” Steve said with a sigh, sipping at his coffee again.
“Take me apart, Tony,” Steve said, his voice husky and deep. He gave Tony another heady kiss, barely pulling the brunette’s bottom lip between his teeth, nipping and pulling at it. “I want you to do everything to me.”
Steve’s alarm clock sounded at 6AM, the super soldier groaning in annoyance as he fought to turn the damn thing off. Once that tedious task of the morning was accomplished, Steve flopped on his belly, his face smashed into the pillow. Tony always teased him, saying that it should be illegal getting up at such an ungodly hour. Yeah, Steve did get up earlier than most, he’d admit it. But that didn’t mean he enjoyed it. He blamed his early to rise schedule on the military, ingrained into his mental wiring.
