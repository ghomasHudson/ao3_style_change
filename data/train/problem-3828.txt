“Yes!” Dean says excitedly, raising a hand to his hair and brushing it down. He’s nervous. He’s really fucking nervous, but he breathes through it because it’s just Cas, Cas who taught Dean how to build a kite, Cas who Dean taught how to whistle, Cas who taught Dean that home is a baby brother and a best friend. “We are sexy, and we are best friends, and it’s awesome.
and leads him home, kissing him again before finally letting him go and grinning all the way to his room. Sam pokes his dorkish head in after while, catches sight of Dean’s dopey grin, and throws his hands up in victory.
“I love you, mommy,” he says softly, and she tells him she loves him back before standing and leaving. The beginning of the school year passes in a blur for Dean. He learns his alphabet, all the way up to his P’s with example words and silly songs for everyone. “A says ah or aye or ahh. Apple or alien, alligator too,” follows his every step. He learns his colors. “My eyes are green,” he tells baby Sam one night. “Your socks are blue. Mom’s hair is yellow.” He learns his numbers. “Onetwothreefourfivesixseven—mom look how fast I can count!—eightnineteneleven,” becomes his favorite game. He is happy. He is normal, and as Mary puts him to sleep one night early November, no one has any idea that when he wakes, he will no longer be the normal and happy child he once was.
“You do that,” Dean teases and walks outside. He pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and takes one out to light. As he inhales, he sees Cas leave his house, but he is content to just sit and watch. He knows Cas is still weirded out about earlier, and Dean doesn’t blame him. He
“Just where do you think you’re going?” Ellen calls with a grin when she sees him. Dean suppresses a sigh as he stops.
“I’m sorry,” he sniffs. “I didn’t mean to. It was an accident. Please don’t be mad. I can clean it up,” Dean says after a moment, his tiny voice shaking. He wipes at his eyes.
They stare at one another for a long time, eyes wide and shell shocked. Neither move. They are frozen by ten years and the gaze of the other.
Dean, still not remembering that he’s hurt, counts it as a victory. Hell, even if he remembered that he was hurt, he’d still probably count making Cas laugh as a win.
This time when he calls, it rings only twice before going to voicemail, showing that Dean saw the call…and pressed ignore. This time, when he calls, he hears Dean’s voice apologizing, telling him to leave a name and message, that he’ll get back to him as soon as possible. Cas doubts that, but he leaves a message anyway.
No one gets very much sleep the night before the trial, especially, not in the Milton/Winchester apartment. Gabriel spends his night drinking and drowning his sorrows—though
“Thank you, Bobby,” Dean says, stopping behind his chair and laying a hand on his shoulder. “I know it seems like we’re ungrateful little prats now, but we really do appreciate what you’ve done for us. If there’s anything we can ever do to return the favor…” Dean trails off. Bobby doesn’t seem like he’s hearing them anyway. Dean knows the feeling.
After dropping Emma back off at the house, carrying her inside and putting her to bed with a kiss and an extra blanket to fight off the chill in her room, Dean heads back out for Cas. He doesn’t speak to Lydia.
“I’m fallible, too, Dean,” Cas whispers when they separate. “I’m going to make mistakes, and I’m going to hurt you without meaning to, and I’m going to be afraid, and I’m telling you this now so you know what to expect for the foreseeable future, if that’s what you want. Because I will never hate you. I will never not want you. I will never not love you.”
The next morning, Dean is pulled from sleep by John’s gruff voice yelling through the halls, heard even over his blaring Pink Floyd. His first thought, as it often is, is Sam, and in seconds, he has ripped the headphones from his head and torn out into the hall wearing nothing but his pajama bottoms. He heads straight for his little brother's room, but when he gets there, he sees Sam struggling to get out from under his covers and the weight of sleep. John is nowhere in sight.
“That’s all, Emma. You can get down now.” Judge Mills’ voice is sad too. Emma slides down off her chair and takes the bailiff’s hand. She starts towards Dean, and when the bailiff starts to pull her away, both father and daughter begin to cry, Dean begging her to be good, to be strong, Emma begging to see her father, to make him take her for ice cream. The bailiff ends up picking her up, kicking and screaming, and taking her back to wherever she was before, probably waiting with her aunt outside. As soon as she’s out of earshot, Dean begins to break.
“But in the car…?” Dean trails off, the world swinging around him from the alcohol and from the dried tears and, frankly, from how close Cas’ lips remain to his. He never wants to be further from them than this.
“We need to talk, Bobby,” he says, and in the back of his mind, he hears Sam getting out of the car and heading for the house. Bobby’s eyes darken, but he nods inside anyway. They climb the steps in silence, that gun still hanging heavy between the three. Bobby leads them into the kitchen and sits them down at the table before turning to get sodas for Dean and Sam and a beer for himself.
When they get back to that old house, those old memories flood him again. He sees Cas upside down in a tree, running down the street with a cape on, but then he blinks them away, and gets out of the car. Sam’s eyes widen at the car that obviously belongs to Lilith, but Dean is looking at the house.
“You’re so fucking hot,” Cas mutters, his breath hot against Dean’s ear and neck. “You like me fisting your hard cock don’t you? You couldn’t even wait until we got home. You’re such a little cock slut. Did you like sucking my dick? Did you like the taste of my come in your mouth? I know you did.” Cas scoots closer, taking Dean’s earlobe into his mouth and nibbling slightly. “You love this, don’t you? Fucking around in the school bathroom…” Dean is so fucking close. Cas speeds up as though he could feel it too. “Anyone could just walk in and see you with my dick in your mouth. Then everyone would know you’re fucking
time.” Cas grins and pulls her to him in a hug. So what if he’s crying a little? He is no longer using her shoulders to catch tears of pain and sadness. He is using her shoulders to catch tears of joy. He has not been this happy sine he woke up every morning next to Dean.
and—” Cas closes his eyes an instant against the hot and angry tears forming, against the memories threatening to swallow him. Gabe is silent on the other end of the phone.
“I’ve been waiting for you,” Dean murmurs into Cas’ shoulder, his own eyes watery. Cas holds on tighter.
“She was my only friend in the clinic,” he says, sipping the coffee Dean offers him, two creams and three sugars, just like he likes. “She was this rebellious little shit, talking about lesbian porn to get out of group sessions.” Cas laughs, and Dean smiles, taking Cas’ hand. This is the first time they’ve even come close to talking about the past. “I told her about how much you meant to me, and we vowed not to let the other forget how much we needed our partners.”
moving. Oh, I was devastated.” Dean looks back to Cas because even though it’s weird between them right now, he still wants to watch his best friend receive the recognition he deserves. Cas doesn’t look as though he’s enjoying it like he should be.
“Hey Jude,” he sings, swinging Sam slowly. “Don’t make it bad. Take a sad song and make it better.” Sam’s teary eyes widen, his small brows pulling together as he forgets to cry and listens to Dean. “Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better.” Dean sings the song softly, and when he finishes and Sam resumes crying, he sings it again. He doesn’t really mind. Eventually, Sam falls asleep, and Dean puts him back in his crib before going back to his own room and crawling between the sheets, tears in his eyes.
“Can you,” she hesitates, and Cas waits patiently. “Can you tell me what it was like…being with Dean?” Cas’ mouth hangs open, speechless.
“I’m about to kiss you,” Cas says, and Dean nods, wrapping an easy arm around Cas’ waist. So Dean’s jealous. He’s still the one making out with Cas right now. Dean runs his tongue along the seam between Cas’ lips, groaning with the moan Cas lets out when their tongues meet. Dean walks them backwards until Cas’ shoulders meet the wall and Dean is able to push against him, his entire front meeting the line of Cas’, and for three days, they stay in that precious limbo, Dean sneaking into Cas’ window at night to fool around and Cas stealing Dean aside in school to get him off. Then day four comes, and it starts with a flyer.
“No, Dean, of course not. I was,” but Dean is cutting him off again, reading this time from the apology.
“You better,” Dean mumbles, and Cas laughs a bit before forcing himself to let Dean go. Gabe and Sam are already in the car, so Cas joins them and begins the twenty-six-hour drive back with an ache in his heart. It takes the same amount of time as the last, and again, they take the drive in shifts. Cas
“It’s time to bring this ship in to the shore and throw away the oars, forever,” Cas sings, and Dean throws his head back in laughter.
“No, damn it!” Cas spits, eyes blazing and shiny. “You can't just do that!" Cas shouts, hands flying rapidly around his head as he screams. "You can't just make me all angry, and then kiss me like that will make it okay. You can’t! It doesn’t make it better, Dean!” Cas takes a breath, his chest heaving, his hands shaking. “I
“Sammy,” Dean croons, reaching out and pulling his baby brother to his chest. Sam cries there like he hasn’t in years, arms clinging to Dean and snot soiling his shirt. “It’s okay,” Dean assures, but it only makes Sam cry harder.
“The blanket,” he says, frowning down at where Dean’s clutching the thin scrap of fabric for all it’s worth. “You’re still shivering.”
“Look at her, Jess,” he chokes out, laughter bubbling in his chest. “Look at her,” he whispers, but that one is for Dean.
“It’s not like that,” he tells her, still shaking his head, still somewhat sadly. “I don’t even know if he likes guys.”
“What are you doing right this very second, Cas?” she asks, bringing Cas out of his regret, and he tells her they are sitting in Dean’s kitchen. “I’m coming over,” she declares, and Cas laughs. “I’m serious, Cas!” she says, and Cas sees that yes, she is indeed serious.
Cas’ cheeks burn. He knows what he wrote, and he knows that the truth in his words is terrifying. There was a darkness around him when he was with Dean, an ache of anxiety in his gut because he knew it was wrong. Coming to terms with these feelings was hard for Cas. When they were together, Cas was content to live in the delusion that love is good no matter what it's form, and there was no reason to dwell on the problems when Dean was right there, his simple existence more good than Cas could ever deserve.
When the kids are done eating, they scurry back off to whatever game they had invented, leaving the adults alone again. They stare at one another in a vibrating silence before Jess clears her throat and speaks.
He wants it to come out sharp and spiteful, like the Dean who would rip up his anger to stab anyone who got too close. But Cas had been right. Everything he’s ever done, he’s done for love. He’s almost forgotten how to use that anger like a weapon.
Dean’s whole world is spining. It’s too much, it’s never enough, and Dean opens his eyes because he wants to see Cas when he comes. He needs to see Cas. It takes a moment of watching Cas, of seeing him come undone by Dean’s hand to push him over the edge. He comes in hot spurts on his stomach, on his and Cas’ joined hands, and a few seconds later, Cas is coming too, rubbing his dick against Dean’s to draw the last drop of come out of both of them.
“Grumpy puss in the mornings, are we?” Cas glares harder, if even possible. “I brought you birthday pancakes,” Gabe says, waving his hand to Cas’ bedside table where pancakes do indeed wait. As if that makes it better.
Dean sits at Castiel’s kitchen table and eats pancakes doused in syrup from a plate shaped like a frog. He hasn’t been happier in weeks. Sitting at that table surrounded by sweets and Cas and Cas’ family, he doesn’t worry about Sam or about John. When he’s with Cas, he gets to be the kid he’s supposed to be.
to be good, but he can’t help it. It’s just who he is. He has the biggest heart I’ve ever seen, loves like the world is ending, even though he doesn’t think he deserves a shred of that love back.” Dean drops Cas’ eyes.
Dean thinks, anything to pretend the cold on him now is just from the snow trapped in his hair. “How long have you been home, man?” Dean asks in hopes of making small talk. Cas blinks owlishly at Dean before opening those lips and speaking.
“Doesn’t mean it wasn’t real,” Cas counters softly, his lips pressing against Dean’s cheek. Dean smiles, his eyes still on the ceiling.
“Not here for the money, Cas,” he says, hugging Cas closer to him as though he’d been reading his mind. “Just here cause I wanna be.” Cas swears Dean is almost asleep by the time he finds the nerve to speak again.
“Of course they can, just like girls can have girlfriends. But the people in this story didn’t think boys could have boyfriends either. In fact, they thought it was wrong for a boy to have a boyfriend. They thought it was bad.” Emma furrows her brow, perplexed.
“Wait, Cas,” Dean shouts, catching his’ attention. Cas turns slowly, his body silhouetted against the battling streetlight and darkness. Dean begins running, doesn't stop until there is a mere handful of inches between them. “I’m married,” he says lamely, and Cas’ hopeful eyes dull a bit.
Her stubby little fingers almost manage it today, and to celebrate that his daughter is a genius, that Dean is off work, and that his daughter is singing along to classic rock from her car seat—what can he say, the girl
“Dean,” Cas says, turning his head at the last moment so that his kiss presses to Cas’ neck instead of his lips. “It’s
But…but his voice had been almost right, just then. The words were still wrong, and Dean’d have probably shit his pants if Cas had ever said that to him for real.
“Sure, Cas,” he says, and so he does, starting all the way at the beginning. “My mom died when I was four…house fire."
“I’m sorry I said all that about her,” Dean says softly when they pull away, carding his fingers through Cas’ hair. “Really, I am, but Meg’s gotta go.” Dean smiles and kisses Cas’ laughing mouth.
“Don't do this, Cas," Dean says, voice hard even as his eyes become more and more red. "Don't fight me, because I'm not strong enough to win. This isn't easy for me either. You've been my one and only for all my life, the only person I'd ever want to be with, and that isn't going to change. But I can't do this. Emma is where I draw the line." A million arguments flash through Cas' mind, justifications and pleas and the thrumming,
Eventually, they fall asleep like that, Cas’ nose buried in Dean’s neck, Dean’s cheek resting atop Cas’ hair, their hands entwined between their laps. It is a nice rest, one that leaves them both cozy when they are drawn into waking by a passing vehicle honking its horn. Dean grunts as he awakes, his hand uncurling from Cas’ shoulders to stretch above his head and rub down his face. Cas sits up as well, his hair flattened against his skull from Dean’s face. Cas watches Dean blearily as he yawns, his arm muscles tightening as he stretches.
The ride to the hospital takes an instantaneous eternity. Cas tries to stay under the speed limit, but his baby girl is being born. Jess grips his hand the whole way, and when they finally get there, Cas sprints inside. He practically runs past the desk in his hurry to see his daughter.
“I couldn’t think of a thing,” he says easily, as though there were anything easy about this. Dean feels a laugh shake through Lisa.
“Is my client the first partner you’ve cheated on?” he asks, and Dean’s jaw clenches. His eyes flick to Cas, and they are both thinking of Bela, of Lisa.
“Happy birthday, Dean,” a voice says from behind, a hand dragging across his shoulder and up to his hair. Dean, upon the touch, tries to pretend that the voice isn’t female, and the hand is Cas’.
Cas sleeps with Mary’s tiny feet glued to his thigh, her skinny fingers threaded through his. He dreams of Dean.
“Whoa, boy,” Bobby interrupts, putting a hand on Dean’s rapidly heaving shoulder. “What do you mean, what are you going to do? You boys are gonna stay with me. I just didn’t want your daddy knowing where you were in case he decides he wants to bring you back with force.”
“Happy birthday, Dean,” Cas whispers, and so with tears in his eyes, on his face, embedded in his shirt, Dean turns away from the only thing he’s ever let himself love.
“Excuse me,” he asks a cashier when he gets inside. “Can you point me towards the coffee?” he asks, putting on his most charming smile. The girl looks at him, pops her gum, and points to the overhead signs which map the location of nearly everything, coffee included. “Thanks,” he says awkwardly, and sets off towards the aisle that is marked coffee, tea, and herbs. When he gets there, he is faced with five long-ass shelves of coffee. He sighs and steps forward and begins sifting through them in order to find a brand Gabriel won’t bitch about. He is about halfway through and palming a glass jar of coffee beans “Imported Straight from Columbia” when he sees someone in his peripheral vision. He looks up, and for whatever reason, the person walking by looks up as well. When their eyes meet, they both freeze.
But then his panic has nowhere to go as the doors part for him, and he’s skidding inside, staring directly at Dean as soon as he bursts inside. He is frozen in his gaze, chest heaving, flowers in his left hand, card in his right. Dean’s heart is slamming as well, taking in every frazzled inch of Cas, from his sneakers right up to his rumpled hair. He’s never seen anyone so beautiful.
The road beneath Dean’s wheels is hard. It is unyielding, unforgiving, and Dean likes that. He likes that the road will never change, never decide it no longer loves being navigated. Roads are rock. They do not care one way or the other. Dean wishes he didn’t. He wishes he couldn’t feel a damn thing.
“You haven’t changed at all,” Cas says in wonder, heart thrumming in his chest. He has missed Dean. Dear God, ten years of repressing what he felt for Dean, ten years of fake smiles and swearing he was whole. He will never be whole without Dean.
“Why?” Sam asks skeptically. “You broke his heart. He loved you more than he’s ever loved anything, and you told him your whole relationship was a mistake, told him you never loved him, told him he ruins everything he touches. Why are you back
“It’s a big one. Eighteen, voting, buying tobacco products, getting into adult movie stores, ordering crap from late night infomercials, aren’t you excited?” Dean shrugs. “Dean,” Bobby starts with a sigh. He puts Cas’ papers to the side and stands from his chair, crossing the room to Dean in a heartbeat. “Son, you have
"You boys are just growing up so fast," she says, a sad look in her eyes as she brings her hand up against his face. "Your mom would be so proud."
Cas tugs the blanket back up across Dean’s back, and when his hand lingers, falls into the valley between his shoulder blades and stills, Dean thinks about what exactly it means that he’s comfortable with Cas.
“What?” he asks, incredulous at the question. No, he doesn’t think homosexuality is wrong. It’s a part of who he is. It’s not something that can be changed, despite the efforts of this damn clinic.
“Benny, he’s got the flu or something. I don’t know, but we don’t have a Frederick! Dean, this is going to be a disaster. What am I going to do?” Cas sits at the foot of Dean’s bed and runs a hand through his hair as he often does when he’s stressed.
“I was really wanting you to meet Emma," Dean says, putting his hands in his pockets and looking around. He is nervous, caught up in his thoughts.
“I thought I was,” Cas says at last, his own heart beating loudly. “I had a nice job, a nice house, a nice life…It was pretty perfect…but I was all alone. There was no one, for ten years. I mean, there were one-night stands and even a girl I thought I was on the road to marrying, but I was kidding myself…” Cas pauses and brings his eyes up to Dean’s. “You’re it for me,” he replies softly, and the warmth rushing through Dean’s veins begins to boil.
“Could you, uh, excuse me?” Cas asks, not waiting for Dean’s response before he’s stepping away and sprinting to the bathroom. When he gets there, he locks the door behind him and whips his phone out. “
“No problem,” Dean grunts. He doesn’t know why he’d added the qualifier that it had only been a few weeks. Dean knows that, if Cas ever dies for real, if he ever goes some place Dean can’t follow, his room will be untouched forever.
“I don’t wanna wait for it to go down,” he manages to grind out around the ecstasy of flesh on flesh.
He hardly sleeps the week of, and when he finally makes the move to drag himself out of bed in the mornings, he finds his steps heavy, leaden. There is almost always a missed call and a new voicemail from Cas. Dean usually doesn’t listen to the voicemails. It always brings back pain and regret, but as he crawls out of bed the before his court date, he decides the day before he loses his daughter is a great day to be a masochist. Why the hell
“Sit, please,” Cas says, waving to the empty bench next to him, smiling wider when Meg sits closer than strictly necessary.
but at the car seat in the back, and makes his way to the garage. Not many cars come in, so he has lots of time to think about just what it means to be completely alone in the world.
“Because it’s true! I killed my mommy,” he wails, and Cas’ heart wrenches in his chest. He scoots a bit closer to Dean and wraps a skinny arm around Dean’s heaving back, pulling the taller boy close to his chest and letting him cry. Cas doesn’t think Dean killed his mommy. He doesn’t think Dean could hurt anyone on purpose. Even so, he holds his new best friend tight to his chest until his sobs become snores and the moonlight becomes sunlight. They are awoken by a squealing child and thundering footsteps. Dean is jolted awake thinking it’s Sam, thinking it’s his father. Cas is jolted awake because Dean shoots ramrod straight in his bed. He watches with sleepy confusion as Dean takes in his surroundings in a quick succession, his mouth set into a deep frown. When his eyes land on Cas, his face relaxes a bit, realization smoothing his mouth into a more neutral state.
“Dean, kiss me,” Cas whispers finally, urgently, and for a split second, Dean forgets that he is onstage in front of hundreds of people, in front of his Uncle Bobby, in front of his baby brother. He hauls Cas to him and kisses him, opened mouthed and teeth clashing. Somewhere in his mind, Dean registers the many sudden intakes of breath, but all he can focus on is the small gasp he swallows from Cas. All he can focus on is how surprisingly soft Cas’ constantly chapped lips are. All he can focus on is the fact that he is here, kissing Cas, but then, all he can focus on, is the fact that Cas is pulling away. Cas’ wild eyes are meeting with his, and Cas is scrambling away.
and six paragraphs later, he’d ended it with a burst of truth that he wishes he could pretend was a lie.
him, lives in the contact until Cas’ lips press against his collarbone. “We’re here now.” Dean stares at Cas for a moment longer, his heart pounding in his chest.
“It’s a celebratory bottle of whiskey,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “I don’t know what you want from me, man.”
“I don’t think I like your dad very much,” Cas says, and had Dean not been so shocked, he’d have been mad. “He looked like he was hurting you.”
“Well, actually, your brother solicited me into letting him catch a ride to Seattle,” Cas says softly, and Dean’s brows furrow.
Dean convinces Sam to stay for dinner, despite Sam swearing he has friends waiting back at the motel room, and when Lydia begrudgingly begins to cook them all dinner, Sam knows he has lost. He didn’t really want to win. Life here with Dean is so much better than that motel room with the guy who broke his brother’s heart and said guy's annoying older brother. Life here with Dean is what it’s always been, fun, safe, simple.
“Okay, well what about all the mothers who died during child labor? What of them? Are they no longer existent because their baby never met them?” Cas sees her eyes visibly darken.
“Because! Because he’s straight, first of all,” Dean sputters, because, just because Cas is out to Dean doesn’t mean he’s out to everyone and telling anyone around here might as well be tattooing it on Cas' forehead for everyone to see,
“Why are you calling me an ‘idjit’?” Dean asks, turning away from where he totally wasn’t watching Cas drive away.
Dean, still at the register, stands perfectly still, nerves trembling at what just happened. Cas was buying a Valentine's Day gift for someone else. If it had been for him, Cas would have said something, right? An ache starts deep in his chest, and he breathes deeply, trying to ignore the feel of Charlie's eyes on him. A moment passes, then another before he can start moving again, and once he does, he picks up the card he slid under the register when he saw Cas come in. It says on the front,
, when compared with…well, sodomy.” She kneels over Castiel now, eyes hooded as tears stream down his face.
“They aren’t here, Dean,” she says, bringing her hand down and down and down until she’s palming at his crotch. He tries to move away. “Let me do this for you, Dean,” she says, licking into his ear and pushing harder.
“Of course you have a dad. Everyone has a dad.” The kid blinks again, slowly taking in what Dean says.
“Look how that turned out," Cas sneers with a snort. "He’s gone, and your son's fucking another man.” His mother’s face is so contorted with anger that he shouldn’t be so surprised when her hand slams out across his cheek, snapping his head to the side hard enough for him to taste blood. “Hit me all you want,” Cas mutters after the shock and the pain subside enough for him to speak. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll still love him. I’ll still let him fuck me.” She is stunned silent. She has no words, nothing but wide eyes telling him that he did something right.
“Jesus, Cas. You’re really gonna make me say it?” Dean pulls in a deep breath and lets it out in a rush, voice shaking with the terror of losing him. “I fucked her, okay. She came rubbing up on me cause it’s my birthday, and I guess I was feeling nostalgic and vulnerable because I
“Your mother,” she wheezes, and Cas jerks away from her so quickly it looks as though she scalded him.
“He needs you here to support him, Cas,” Sam says, leaning forward and pressing a hand to the counter beside Cas’.
“Doesn’t he know you’re leaving to pick up Emma?” Dean asks, standing back and turning his head towards the back of the house.
“Cas,” he says quietly, knocking on the window, tears still spilling down his face. Cas’ window isn’t as high as Dean’s, so he just stands on his tip-toes to see inside instead of hanging by his forearms as Cas had. He knocks louder, tears falling faster because he doesn’t want to be alone. He wants to be with his friend, with the friend who makes him laugh instead of the father who makes him cry. “Please, Cas,” he whimpers, putting his head down on the cool brick of Cas’ windowsill. He doesn’t want to leave, but he’s getting cold because he left without at jacket and a storm is rolling in. He knows he’ll get sick if he stays outside any longer, so, with tears still in his eyes, he turns away.
“Dude. What is your problem?” Dean spits, jerking Sam’s shoulder so they are face to face. Dean is shocked to find hot tears welling in Sam’s eyes. Sam chews on his lip a moment before speaking, his pubescent voice breaking more than usual.
“I know you miss Cas,” he starts quietly, and suddenly, Dean is not so sorry for yelling at him. As of late, Cas has become a taboo, something to avoid talking about at all costs.
He goes back inside eventually, numb all over and aching like he’s never hurt before. His daughter is gone… When he gets inside, Cas, now dressed and anxious looking, wraps him with a blanket and tries to rub the cold and numb from his limbs. He succeeds, but when the cold and numb leaves him, all Dean is left with is an irrational anger towards Cas.
going to Rachel’s, however, I thought I might need clothes, so I came home only to see my brother canoodling his best friend. Thank God, by the way. I’ve about had enough of you two idiots being all woe-is-me. Mom will be back by nine, so don’t let her see you. Later guys. No sex unless it’s safe sex!” Anna pushes past them and slams the door behind her. Cas huffs out a laugh, putting his head in the crook of Dean’s neck.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean groans with a grin, tucking his dick back into his pants and zipping up. “That was hot,” he says and stands, walking over to Cas and kissing his neck. Cas smiles softly, scrubbing his hands to get Dean’s come off of them.
“I forgive you, Dean,” Cas says, eyes boring into Dean’s, and all at once, the ache of guilt melts off of Dean in the sincerity of Cas’ voice.
Gabriel follows close behind, shutting his door softly and walking around to stand next to Cas. They both stare up at the house. For Gabriel, that house is just the house across the street, but for Cas, that house was half of his whole childhood, and the man inside is the love of his life. The thought sets his heart to stuttering like it used to all those years ago.
They do indeed find a place that’s more private. Granted, it’s Benny’s bedroom, which, thanks to Benny’s recent streak of acting out, has had the lock removed. Dean will thank him later for letting them borrow his room and then bitch at him a little for being a rebellious shit and getting his lock taken away.
“I will, baby,” Dean croons, rolling Cas gently so they are face to face and slipping his tongue out to lap at the head of Cas’ cock. Cas whines and jerks his hips.
When Dean gets back to his house, picket fence and all, he finds a tan, low-riding hunk of metal where his baby should be parked. He furrows his brow at the Kansas plates, but when he sees his gangly-ass, bitch of a brother, a grin the size of Montana stretches across his lips.
“Well, does anyone else want to give these two away?” he asks, and Bobby steps forward, along with Cas’ mother to offer their blessings. Bobby claps them both on the shoulder, and Cas’ mom kisses them both on the cheek.
“I love him,” Cas chokes out around the lump in his throat. He is seeing his best friend. He is seeing the love of his life. He is seeing everything Dean has ever been, everything he ever will be. “I love him.” Cas chews his lips to keep the sobs from taking him over. He knows his has no right to cry, not here, not in front of Sam.
“Benny, you have to! Tonight is the important show! You can’t be sick!” Cas’ voice is frantic, but Benny can’t help but cough over him.
Castiel picks the sign up now, holding it gingerly as he remembers the day again. He remembers the laughter, the tears, the kisses, the sex. He wants to remember, but not for the same reason he did in the clinic. He wants to remember now to avoid those mistakes in the future. Castiel puts the sign in his bottom drawer, out of sight, out of mind. When he straightens back up, he already feels lighter,
The rest of the wedding passes without a hitch, and before Dean knows it, he is holding Cas close, their foreheads pressed together as they sway to the beat of their first dance. Cas is smiling, eyes closed as he listens to the words.
"Your brother," Lydia interrupts, only to be shushed by both her lawyer and Judge Mills. She quiets and sulks.
“Stop!” Sam screams as he runs into the view of the beating, but John ignores him, bringing his fist up again and hitting Dean in the stomach, doubling him over with a groan. “Stop, damn it!” Sam screams with every punch, all to no avail.
“Daddy,” Emma asks later as he tucks her in to bed. Dean has been so spaced out since He left that he barely noticed Lydia leaving to get their daughter.
“He was.” A long silence passes between them before Cas finds it in him to speak again. “So what does it mean that he signed us up?”
“What are you still doing here?” she asks suddenly, pulling away and wiping at the tears in her eyes. “You should be at the hospital!”
“I know it’s wrong for me to love another man,” Cas begins softly, hanging his head a bit because he never wanted to be wrong. It occurs to Cas that he forgot to reject his meds this morning in his dazed Dean-drunk state. He feels clearer because of it...
“You actually did it,” he says, sounding just as awed as is deserved after the fucking two days Dean’s had. The fucking two
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says later, after hours of staring at one another, of convincing themselves that this is real, this is forever. “You wanna get married?” and Cas laughs, voice big and bright.
“Nevermind. How’s it going?” She smiles at him, leaning against the counter. He watches her a moment, remembers the days when he would have hit on her to prove his heterosexuality.
“Ah,” Dean groans, bringing a hand to his head. “I can’t. I told Sam I’d drive him to get milkshakes with Jessica, remember?”
“He’s leaving me, Charlie,” Cas says finally, his voice shaking and teary. Her eyes widen, and the tears fall against Cas’ will. “
“Thanks, Ellen,” he whispers, straightening up and kissing her cheek. She’d gotten it right, too. Dean’s scared that when Cas comes back, he won’t be the same. He’s scared that, despite loving Cas with every ounce of his being, it won’t be enough because it never has been before.
But judging by the way Cas turns his resigned look towards Dean, it doesn’t really work. He tries to remind himself that everything is different, and he’d known everything would
“I’m good, Dean; everything’s fine. I just…I missed you.” Cas’ voice softens, and all at once, he sees Dean’s face, those eyes and that smile.
“No, Dean, don’t do that. Please don’t.” Cas closed his eyes to it, closed his eyes to hurting Dean again. Dean’s lips pressed against his, soft and earnest and Cas had choked on the tears. He kept his eyes closed even after Dean pulled away, closed them tighter.
His hands scrabble up and tug the dress shirt out of Cas’ slacks, and Cas lets a soft sigh out against his lips.
Which is precisely why he’s freaking out. Dean's never before needed someone to love, only someone to fuck, and here he is, thinking of Cas every single moment.
“Your uncle Sam used to beg me to read this book too,” he tells her, smoothing her hair down and opening the book.
“I’m so fucking in love with you,” Dean says before trapping Cas’ lips with his own, leaning over the slightly shorter man.
“Yeah, no, sure, definitely. I don’t want to talk about it. Ever. I mean, I’m completely supportive of this relationship because it’s been forever in the making, and everyone knows you kinda love each other, but lock a door! Balls!” he says and leaves the bedroom, holding a hand over his eyes and bumping into the frame on his way out.
“Good morning,” Dean says softly, wrapping an arm behind his head so that he can prop up and see Cas more clearly. Cas grunts softly and cuddles beneath Dean’s arm, beneath his chin.
“Damn it, Gabriel,” Cas hisses, shoving the plate back into his nightstand and jumping from the bed.
“Can the next dance be a Cassie-daughter dance?” she asks, reaching a hand out to pat Cas’ leg. Cas swallows back his happiness and nods.
When he falls, his knees crack hard against the nothingness below him, and there are a dozen memories nestled familiar in the pain of it.
“Me too,” Dean murmurs, starting back in on his bacon. Bobby leaves him to his breakfast after that, and when he finishes, he picks up the phone and wanders into the garage. He just needs to hear Cas’ voice, so he dials the number. He doesn’t answer, so he dials Cas’ house phone. He doesn’t answer, but Anna does.
Cas shucks his trenchcoat off as he teases at Dean’s head. Loses the suit jacket and the dress shirt. Kicks out of his shoes. His pants.
“Bailiff, can you come here for a moment?” she requests, and the man moves forward, putting his ear close to her lips when she begins whispering. The man straightens after a moment, nods at her and leaves out the way Judge Mills entered. The courtroom is silent for a few moments, the judge staring at the defendants, and the defendants staring back, waiting for some kind of cue. When the bailiff returns, he is holding a small child by the hand, one that takes Cas a moment too long to recognize. Dean, however, gasps a bit, tears filling rapidly in his eyes.
“Gross! No!" he exclaims, reeling away and closing his eyes to burn the mental image and find his question again. "I see and hear
“I bet your birthday present was just delivered,” Gabe says, a suggestive grin on his face which Cas ignores in favor of abandoning the chaos that is his hair and moving to the sink to brush his teeth. The mail person knocks again, and Cas groans around his toothbrush.
But then, Cas’ face changes. It would be damn near imperceptible to someone who hadn’t made a life-study out of Cas’ microexpressions, but Dean
He’d started out into the deep, gnawing emptiness as a perfect simulacrum of his fantasies. He’d stomped and shouted and swung into the blackness enshrouding him. He’d held his chin high, blazed his guns,
always very protective of you,” she admits softly, squeezing Cas’ fingers. “Was he good to you?” Cas nods, the ache growing wider as he talks more about Him, as he grows to resent his mother less.
“I’ve been...” Cas falters. What has he even been? The last ten years have been him running from himself. They’ve been nothing. None of it has meant anything without Dean. “I’ve been mundane.” Cas forces a laugh. “You were pretty much the most interesting thing to ever happen to me.” Cas tries to laugh again, but his voice falls flat with truth. Dean blinks, and Cas’ cheeks flame. He averts his eyes. “I’m a teacher now,” he says to cover up his slip. He should be more careful. He spent ten years without Dean. He does not want to make him run now just because a slip of the tongue tells Dean that Cas is nothing without him. That would freak him out. “Molding young minds and all.”
to be there in that class. Then he has math with Bobby, and Cas isn’t supposed to be there either, so it’s about as okay as math can get, especially because Bobby leaves him the hell alone through the period as a gift to him.
kiss, the single, solitary, most heart-wrenching kiss in the whole play was staged!” Cas sighs and runs a hand through his hair.
They stop by Bobby’s room to relay the story—surprise, surprise, Bobby doesn’t think it’s a great idea to go see John—and then head out with Dean once again behind the wheel of his Baby. He just sits in her for a while, listening to her purr as he revs her. Then he drives he like he’s never driven anything so superb in his life, and to him, he hasn’t. Baby is his, and he is Baby’s, and that is a bond that should never have been broken.
“Well, isn’t that just the most ingenious, cutting-edge idea that I’ve ever heard!” Dean barks with false excitement.
“Thanks.” Then Dean is excluded from their conversation, not intentionally, of course, but that’s just how couples are. When they get together, the rest of the world ceases to exist. It’s not Sam’s fault if Dean just becomes part of the rest of the world when he’s with Jessica. It’s not Sam’s fault that every time he thinks of Cas, the rest of the world ceases to exist, but he’s entirely alone. It’s not Sam’s fault, but Dean doesn’t want to spend his birthday as the third wheel. “I’m just going to catch up with you guys later,” Dean says, rising to leave and being pushed back down by a large and rowdy hand.
” Cas grins, presses his lips to Dean’s, misses the tag line, and laughs as Dean picks up the next one in his low tenor. “
“Alright, alright,” the judge says as she takes her place behind the bench. “Go on, sit down,” so everyone sits. She takes a look at her case file and glances at the plaintiff and defendant. “Alright, let’s get this party started.” She pauses, clasps her hands before her and looks around the room. “I’m Judge Mills,” she says, looking at Dean straight in the face, watching him with narrowed eyes. “And I do things a little differently in my courtroom. Now, I understand that you, Mrs. Winchester,” but Lydia interrupts her.
“Oh my God,” Cas stutters, hands still holding onto the eggs, half his instinct telling him to regather his groceries and get the hell away, the other half telling him to stay and fumble out an apology to the beautiful checker before him. In the scramble and fry of his brain, he choses something in the middle, that being to stand, stare, half-shout, “Sorry!”, and grab everything he can carry before
His thoughts strike the worst reality first: he’s going to lose his daughter. Sam’s a great lawyer and all, but Lydia’s manipulative…cunning. There’s no line she won’t cross to get what she wants. That’s why he’s here in the first place. He made it very clear to her before they ever got together that he wasn’t looking for attachments. She had wanted more than the one night, but they slept together anyway. She
He’ll stare at the wall for hours, blinking at nothing and saved only by a sharp knock on the door. The knocker draws him into the reality he’s been dozing in and out of since yesterday. He doesn’t look up, but Charlie comes in anyway.
” he repeats with a laugh, turning back to look at Dean before kissing him softly. “Let’s reminisce, Dean,” Cas whispers, and much to his delight, Dean kisses him softly again before sitting up and letting Cas curl under his arm to watch reruns of the show they loved together ten years ago. It’s a marathon, much to their joined glee, so they sit on the couch curled against each other until Gabe bursts back into the apartment, his clothes smelling like liquor.
Dean finds himself driving the roads before he even knows where he’s going. He parks in a little turn off that is definitely not meant for him but will do the trick anyway. He’s back to that hill, the one with the little pond at the bottom that swallowed him all those winters ago. Dean pulls a pair of gloves from the glove compartment and looks around at the trees and the hills and the snow just the same as it was back then. Cas isn’t here. That much is different. He has no sled as he makes his way down the hill, that much is different too. Something that’s the same? Dean crashing down to the ice as soon as he hits it. Something that’s different? Dean bringing his knees to his chest and crying, his tears leaving hot trails down his face as they roll. He doesn’t cry for the fall. He cries for
“What?” he asks, blinking at her dumbly. She is bent over a table, washcloth in hand as she scrubs it down.
“Castiel Milton,” Cas says, still looking at Dean. Dean’s mouth hangs open, and Cas tries to tell him how sorry he is just by the look in his eye. What Cas doesn’t see, however, is Lydia’s hushed and frantic conversation with her lawyer.
, but his lips only manage to say, “Just hold onto her.” Cas takes in every freckle on Dean’s face, every scar and line and remembers how he’s kissed them all, worshiped them all. When he turns away, there will be no more laughter in the morning, no more warmth at night, no more light in the world.
Okay. Anyways. I'd love to know what you guys thought of hearing old Deany's perspective on all this. Lots of love!
“You cheated on me,” she supplies, and he had. The end of Bela was the beginning of Lisa, but she doesn’t sound angry. She’s merely persuading. “Come on, Dean,” she croons, right against his ear. “Just one little kiss,” she whispers, and Dean’s head turns without his permission. His lips barely brush hers, a ghost of a kiss, really, but then she’s gripping his hair and kissing him, really kissing him. Then that one kiss becomes two, and the two become five, and the five become them rising and making their way to somewhere, anywhere private, all the while Dean’s mind tumbling back and forth between
He’s struggling so hard to get the words out that they come out near a bark. Cas flinches, and if Dean had more control over his body than rhythmic convulsions from the cold, he’d be flinching too.
Eventually, he thinks of Sam, and Sam, like he always does, helps Dean to remember that he has fucking responsibilities, people to smile to and assure he’s okay even though he’s dying on the inside. So he stands. He scrubs his face with cold water to get rid of the sex and the tears and the general Dean-like mess that is his whole goddamn life, and when he looks up at himself in the mirror, he can almost pretend he’s okay. Almost. But he’s not. And everyone knows it. He leaves that bathroom anyway, head held high and wielding his
But the growl of it had been almost right enough that Dean suddenly doesn’t want to turn away from him. He doesn’t want to get fucked by Cas.
“Sure,” Dean says with a smile, and if Cas didn’t know better, he’d say Dean almost looked excited. They ride in Dean’s car, a low-riding, throaty growl of a vehicle that Dean affectionately calls ‘Baby.’ Cas admires the initials carved into the leather, the army men jammed into the ashtray, and he runs his fingers over them both absently. “Sam did that when he was little,” Dean says when he sees Cas’ hands. Cas looks up, and the look on Dean’s face is a mixture of softness and longing. “The nerd always did get restless on long car rides.”
“Are you sure, Dean?” Lilith asks, her smile slipping away to fake concern. “Sam is getting pretty grown. Big brother constantly trying to swoop in and save the day probably gets a little tiring for him, don’t you think?” Dean closes his eyes against her. “He doesn’t need you, Dean. He’s better off without you.”
“Good,” she says, and the finality in her voice is apparent. Dean is leaving. He’s packing up again, taking what’s left of his life, and getting the hell out of dodge. He is alone. Really and truly…entirely alone. He packs slowly, pulling only what he needs from the drawers and leaving the rest. He takes the picture of his mom, choking back the memory of the day Cas gave it to him. It seems like a lifetime ago, an eternity since they were together and happy… When he’s packed, Dean sits at his desk and begins writing a letter to Sam.
“I’m not interested in sex, Dean,” he says, and the smile drops off Dean’s face. Here it is. Here’s the goodbye.
“Alright, line up, children,” Bobby says, and they all grumble good-naturedly, shuffling in to their places. Sam shows up just seconds before Bobby asks where he is, Emma on his hip. Ellen hands her the little basket she’ll carry with her, and with her free hand, she reaches for Dean. Dean smiles at her and takes her hand.
“What have I done?” he whispers, and Gabe flinches away from the emptiness in his brother’s eyes. Gabe does not know what to do. He knows Castiel is not seeing the liquor he spilled on his big, fancy carpet. He is not seeing the dog left alone at the house. He turns to Gabe with wide and desperate eyes. “How did I let this happen?” he asks, his voice shaking.
“Hello, Dean,” a voice says, and he doesn’t need to open his eyes to know whose voice it is. He’s heard that voice say a million different words, his name being the most common. He doesn’t need to open his eyes to know that it’s Cas, but he does, and it's his ceiling, big and empty and distinctly
“Speak of the devil,” Dean says, spotting Jess walking over, a huge smile plastered on her face, ring on her finger sparkling in the sun. Sam turns, and if Dean thought his eyes were gooey before, they are practically liquid now.
I guess…? Is that I like men. I’m gay, and really, the only thing on my mind right now is my boyfriend.” Cas shrugs, and when he looks up, he sees Charlie’s intrigued green eyes locked on him.
implications of three weeks alone to come rushing back at him. “I’ll have to see what can be done about that,” Cas promises into the phone, drawing Dean back into his worried state. Dean remembers what that voice did to him the first time, how he’d twitched at the promise. “But until then," Cas' voice softens; Dean braces for what's next. "I love you, Dean. Call me back.” Dean pulls the phone away from his ear, presses his head into his hand. He listens to another, one from a couple days later.
“I’m not going anywhere, babe. I’ll be with you every step of the way,” so reluctantly, Cas leaves the bed, hands linked into Dean's the entire time, and together, they head outside. Heaven looks exactly like the world before, tall buildings, green grass, people milling about, but everything moves differently. Cas thinks about the old grocery store they had their first fight in, and suddenly everything shifts so that they are standing in front of it. Dean grins, but Cas is using every ounce of his strength not to think about the bridge. He closes his eyes, and when he opens them, they are standing at the foot of the thing, the place that claimed Dean’s life. Dean flinches, Cas flinches, and suddenly, almost frantically, they are standing in front of an old wooden house, somewhere Cas has never seen. It must have been Dean’s thoughts driving them here.
“I don’t think so… Oh, wait. He did order us a sign for the library that said, ‘The Winchesters’.” Cas pauses, brushes his fingers absently across Dean’s chest. A long moment passes. “I never took that one out of the box,” he says softly, and Dean flinches a bit.
The guilt of what he almost cost Dean is mostly gone, but Cas is still drowning in the sadness. He's happy for Dean, so he offers him a soft smile. “Thank you,” Dean murmurs after locking eyes with Cas. “If it weren’t for you…” Dean trails off, but Cas knows. His sudden outburst bought the time they needed to get the results and sway the judge's opinion. “I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to repay you.”
“Cas, what are you talking about?” Dean’s heart is slamming in his chest. He never thought he’d see Cas again. He thought that their run in the sun was over, but here he is, face frozen in terror and ten years alone beneath his belt. It’s been ten years, and after dreaming of him and being pissed at him and hating him and loving him, God,
“Yeah, I’ve got a major hangover, so he went find me some Tylenol, the sweetheart,” he says, winking at Sam when the blush rises on his cheeks.
“Dad’s getting remarried?” Sam asks quietly, but Dean has nothing to say. “But…Mom.” Dean nods. He knows. His mother has been dead for over thirteen years, but it is still too soon to move on from her. Dean isn’t sure if it will ever stop being too soon. “Are we going?” Sam asks, looking to Dean with wide eyes, desperate for his big brother’s guidance.
there’s no coffee?” Gabriel growls into the phone. His hair is a mess and his morning breath is melting the phone, but he refuses to do anything about any of it until he’s had his coffee. Be that as it may, the motel's supply ran out yesterday, via the bored woman at the front desk.
“Are chicken nuggets okay for you, or do you want grown up food?” he asks Jess, earning a laugh in response.
“Hey, babe,” she says, leaning down and pecking his lips. His cheeks burn, and for the first time in a while, he cuts his eyes to Cas. Cas is looking away.
“No, not you. I was talking to her,” he replies, running his hand over his car’s glossy, black finish. Cas snorts.
“Please, Cas,” Dean moans against the side of Cas’ neck. “Don’t stop,” so Cas doesn’t. He moves against Dean, inside Dean, sweat slicking the slide of their bodies. The only things either of them can hear is the moans of the other and their own heart pounding inside their chests. Cas’ rhythm picks up steadily, going faster and harder and earning filthy moans for his efforts. “Fuck, Cas,” Dean groans, lifting his hips so that Cas’ every thrust hits against his prostate. Cas licks the sweat away from Dean’s neck and pulls a hand around front to grip Dean’s cock. He doesn’t give Dean a moment to ease into it. No, he just starts jerking Dean in time with the thrusting of his hips, hand clenched sure and tight and steady.
“Enjoyed it? God, I was shattered, absolutely miserable!" Lisa smiles again, before turning to Dean, eyes wide. “Oh crap. Speaking of miserable, I have to go. I have a test I have to finish. Hey, do you want to come over after school?” Her fingers are still brushing through his hair, and he really loves that, so he can't help but tell her yes.
Dean walks them backward towards the bed until Cas is sitting down and Dean's leaning over him. Cas doesn’t break the kiss as he leans back, pulling Dean until he’s hovering over him, arms bracketing Cas' body. Dean runs his hands along Cas’ sides, taking a moment to pull away from his mouth and suck at his pulse point, lick into the hollow of his throat, nip along his shoulder, before pushing his lips back against Cas’.
But Dean, he wants more than a silver-dollar sureness. He wants to see it. Needs to see it. He stands there under the buzzing neon of a backalley bar, and he pushes down the lump in his throat, wondering if the shifter is gonna change right in front of him.
“So, you and Cas,” a new voice from behind him says, and Dean jerks around so fast that his head spins. Sam is standing behind the screen door, one of his socks falling to his ankle and his hair sticking up on one side.
“You’re taking everything from me,” Dean says, his back still to his dad, his head held high. “You’re taking my home, my life, my school, my boyfriend. You can’t even let me keep the fucking car?”
“I’m not...but for a long time, I thought I was broken. I didn’t want to be broken, so I forced myself to have sex. Don’t get me wrong. Everyone I was ever with could always tell that I wasn’t enjoying it…” Cas remembers the way Dean looked at him earlier, that exasperation and annoyance blatant on his face. “Even so,” Cas starts, anything to get that look out of his mind. He doesn’t want to remember Dean looking at him like that. “Sometimes asexuals agree to have sex, be it for their own libido or their partner’s fulfilment or just for the hell of it sometimes, and even beyond that, many asexuals do enjoy a few acts that would fall under ‘sexual.’ The line is different for everyone.”
“Oh no, it’s not what it looks like. We’re actually having a secret affair and this is has all been one big, elaborate ruse. Can we go home now?” Charlie asks, pulling her head off Cas’ shoulder and putting a sharpness in her voice that Cas hasn’t heard since the group session.
“My brother will likely be back before then, and…well, I don’t want him to think his gift wasn’t appreciated.” Cas shifts uncomfortably again.
“That would be me,” Gabe pipes from inside. He appears a moment later with his hair a mess, hands in his pockets, and shirt probably back in his own room. “I’m great at fucking shit up,” he mutters, cutting Sam a short look before stepping around Dean and Cas. “Congrats, Cas,” he says before leaving, going back to his own room, rubbing the back of his neck absently. They watch him until the door shuts behind him and Dean and Cas turn to Sam for an explanation.
"Objection, your honor," Lydia's lawyer intervenes, standing back up and waving a wide arm to Sam. "How is this relevant?" The judge raises her eyebrows at Sam, obviously waiting for his answer.
“You said earlier that you couldn’t live without it.” Cas distinctly remembers because the words felt like a knife to his chest.
The trail to the tree house is as familiar as ever, a huge rock tossed to the side, a pesky root sticking up from the ground, the grass worn to death. Dean could walk this path with his eyes closed, and he just might if every time he closed his eyes, he didn’t see Cas running with a cape tied to his neck, Cas laughing with a fishing pole in hand. Cas...Cas everywhere. Instead, he keeps his eyes open and watches the trees crawl by until he spots that rickety little house behind the branches.
you,” Dean snarls. “Castiel has the world waiting for him, and you will not ruin that for him. Do you understand?” Lisa’s eyes are wide, horrified, and Dean walks away. He doesn’t think she has it in her to tell. She cared about Cas once upon a time too. “Come on, Cas,” Dean says when he finds him just inside the door. “We’re leaving. Thanks for the party, Benny,” Dean calls, saluting the drunken Benny who is now clinging to the dark-haired girl’s waist. Dean just catches Benny waving back before he and Cas have made it through the door and into the Impala. Cas is silent for a long while, chewing on his knuckles and watching the miles pass by.
“In Clarence’s play, Dan got to play the main character, so he had to pretend-kiss boys, but when his pretend boyfriend got sick, Clarence had to be Dan’s pretend boyfriend. The play went wonderfully, and everyone cried about how much they loved it, but when it came time for the boyfriends to pretend kiss, Dan kissed Clarence
" He doesn't wait for her response. "I’m coming over.” Dean stands abruptly, cradling the phone between his shoulder and his ear as he jumps around the room, frantic, trying to get his pants on. Anna is speaking, but Dean doesn’t hear what she’s saying. All he can hear is
. Cas pulls away immediately, face ablaze. A look of exasperation washes across Dean’s face before he can cover it, and it is like a punch to the gut for Cas. It is the same look that has passed everyone who’s ever even been remotely
“Cas, I want you to come with me,” Dean gasps, pulling away slightly to stare into Cas’ sex-crazed eyes. Cas nods rapidly, his lips parted and panting. Dean untwines one of their hands and reaches between them to stroke Cas. He never tears his eyes from Cas’, even as his rhythm stutters and the heat in his gut reaches into overwhelming territory. One last brush of Cas’ prostate has Cas coming over Dean’s hand and stomach, eyes squeezing shut as his body spasms. The sight of Cas falling to pieces, along with the tight clench and hot promise of his orgasm, sends Dean coming right after him, his forehead falling against Cas’ shoulder when he’s got nothing left.
“I think it might be best if that, us kissing, was a onetime thing,” Dean says eventually, scared that Cas will be mad.
“You’ve turned into a slob, Sammy,” Dean teases, tossing aside a pair of underwear so he can sit. Cas stands behind him, his hands resting on Dean’s shoulders.
to you. Dean, you couldn’t see out of your left eye for two weeks. Sam, your rib is still broke! Don’t forget what he’s done to you boys.”
“Sure, Cas,” Dean says after a moment. They sit on Cas’ couch with a respectable distance between them, the curtains drawn tight around them. The movie, which Cas offered Dean choose, is an action/thriller, and it has Cas’ stomach rolling. He’s not much of one for blood and guts and gore, so he takes to watching Dean watch the movie and ignoring the sounds of guns and blood spatter. Dean’s eyes are wide and childlike and Cas is once again struck by his beauty. He is struck by the openness he finds in Dean’s face.
“Cas,” Dean gasps, into the darkness. It sounds very loud, louder even than when he’d been scraping his vocal cords raw, louder than the gunshots and the temper tantrums and the cavernous sounds of his footsteps.
“Oh, I have a gift for you,” John says before reaching into his jacket pocket and pulling something out, something that catches the light and jingles. “I know you love this car,” John says, dropping the keys into Dean’s palm. “I changed the deed and everything to your name. Take good care of her, son.” Dean stares at the keys for a long time, too stunned to do anything
“Well what about you?” he asks Sammy, squatting down to his level. “Can I have a hug?” Sammy immediately steps closer so Cas can get his arms around the child. He’s not much older than Mary, a year, maybe, and they get along well. When Jess has finally caught Mary, smothered her in kisses and giggle inducing tickles, and released her again, the children go off to play while Jess and Cas follow them upstairs and into the kitchen. They sit at the table drinking coffee, chatting, and listening to the sounds of their children playing in the next room for a long while. Eventually, Mary and Sammy come wandering in, both crawling into their respective parents’ laps.
“You’re so good for me, baby,” Cas murmurs, brushing a kiss across Dean’s lips and hitting the good spot with his fingers. Dean arches up beneath him, and Cas uses the moment to slip an arm beneath him. “Are you sure you want this?” Cas asks, because Dean’ ass is giving easily, and Cas may be mostly a virgin, but he knows Dean is ready.
“Did you hear her, Jess?” he asks, begging her to see because he really needs her with him on this. “Did you hear how much she loves him already? You can’t ask me to take him away from her.”
But no matter what form his plans and fantasies and whiskey-drunk-whispered-promises took, he was always,
“Very much,” he replies, and whatever the reason may be, a frown pushes to her lips. He does not ask what the reason is.
with,” he amends, and tears well up in Cas’ eyes. “He needs you, Cas.” Cas takes a long moment to answer, and when he speaks, his voice is shaky with tears.
So little Emma rides Dean’s hip back into her room and hides her face in his neck while he checks in the closet, beneath the bed, out the window.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs sympathetically, reaching for Dean again, only to be denied again. Cas pulls his hands back in and stares at his shoes. “I know you’re worried about Emma, but Lydia will come around. We’ll get through this together; let me be here for you.”
“Guess sucking dick isn’t something you forget how to do,” Dean replies with a grin, pressing a kiss to Cas’ shoulder.
His hands shake when he reaches out to touch her, but she  still kisses him slowly, languidly even, compared to the insistent push of the first time. Castiel closes his eyes to her gray eyes because they are not candy apple green. He closes his eyes to her flower blossom scent, her small fingers, her smooth face. He just kisses her, bringing his hands to rest against the small of her back because it is the least offensive place he can find.
’” Dean lets out a broken laugh, one that has Cas’ tears falling harder and harder. “And then you said, ‘I don’t love you. I never did. I should have never let you touch me the way you did. You sodomized me, ruined me,’ and then I told you that I loved you, and you said I destroyed you and that you would never be good again, never be clean, that I was a disgrace, a goddamn felon against goodness.”
“Hey, baby,” Cas says in the recording, voice chipper and scuffed from the previous night. “You’re probably still asleep, and I envy you that.” Cas sighs mournfully. “I wish I could be there with you,” he continues softly, and Dean clenches his eyes shut. “Curled up against your side, watching you dream. You’re always so calm looking when you sleep.” Cas laughs a bit, and Dean’s heart clenches. “Anyway, I got that picture you sent last night,” Dean hears the wistful sound of Cas' voice cut to a mischievous glint, sees the picture he's referring to in his mind’s eye. Yes. It was a picture of his penis, hard and hot and aching for Cas. Cas continues, low and throaty in Dean's ear, “I miss seeing you like that, desperate and begging for me.” Dean blushes, willing himself to be disinterested. This is
The drive back to the bunker is one of the longest of Dean’s life. They don’t talk about it. Don’t even come close, except the moment they cross the state line into Iowa, and Cas asks why he’d chosen Pontiac.
“You heard me. How many people have you raped? And you?” He spits, flinging his arm at her male counterpart, the one who “helped” Dorothy and countless other girls. The guy bows up a bit, his stance defensive like he's ready to punch Cas. Before the guy can swing, however, the doors burst open and what looks like a whole precinct files in, the lead cop yielding a gun.
are the friends Sammy brought with him?” Dean asks, shocked and incredulous. Cas looks up, eyes wide.
“Charlie, this is Dean,” he says, wrapping an arm low around Dean’s waist as his hand stretches out to grip hers.
feel good enough,” Sam says with a biting snort. “We Winchesters sure know how to instill a sense of self-worth into our kids.” Sam turns away from Dean, knee bouncing and tongue sucking at teeth to keep from sniffing.
“I just wanted you to know,” Cas calls after him, his voice shaking. “I want you to know I never meant to hurt him.” Gabe sighs.
” and that is all it takes. He waits, of course he does. Whatever Dean wants. Whatever Dean needs, no matter how much it may hurt Cas to wait. He turns slowly.
“Maybe you should put your faith in me, then. Put your faith in Sam or in Ellen or in yourself for a change…” Dean watches the snow fall from the gray sky.
way to deny it. “Even if I didn’t, I have eyes. I see the way you two look at each other, and so do other people.”
He and Gabriel have a fight the next morning, short and ugly, demanding of their entire attentions even though it is about Dean.
Dean is tired. He has been tired for three weeks, tired for ten years. Every day, he has woken up, looked over to her, looked over to where his wife should be, and she is never there. It is not her that Dean misses. He never loved
“Yes! I-” but then Dean is dragging Cas in by the bare of his shoulders and kissing him, open-mouthed and desperate and needy. Cas kisses him back fiercely, his hands wild and frantic, his tongue demanding, but then everything is gone as Cas shoves him away roughly, eyes shining.
“True. I have been working my ass off to remain extremely gay in the face of all this anti-gay and negativity,” she says with a grin.
“Sure thing, kiddo,” he replies with an easy smile. They fall into the seats around him, and soon enough, they are being joined by Ellen and Bobby, bowls of steaming vegetables and plates of perfectly charred meats. Dean isn't there though. He's once again in his head with Cas.
“Hey, Dean,” he murmurs, fingers tracing over the letters again. “It’s, uh, it’s Cas…but you knew that. Caller ID and what not…” Silence, Cas’ heart beats once, twice, and a third time. “I just…I’m sorry, Dean. I really would like to see you, talk to you, explain.” Cas chews his lip, fighting back the ache and the tears and the need to tell Dean everything. Another moment of silence, another beat of Cas’ heart. “Please, Dean, I love yo—” but a beep in his ear tells him his time is up. He sighs, considers deleting the message, but hangs up knowing that Dean probably won’t listen to the thing anyway.
“Hey,” she says once the pie between them is gone. “Cas was being really weird all day. Is he okay?”
“You really fucked it up,” Cas murmurs, and Dean feels a million pounds lift off his chest. He knows he’s forgiven. He pushes out a broken laugh. He drops his arms from his hips, fingers winding between Cas’.
have they been together like this. Sure, they’ve never been these sweating palms or these frantic lips, these broken cries for more, but they’ve always needed each other. They’ve always been everything the other ever needed, a best friend, a brother, a confident, someone to beat at Call of Duty, but they've never known how much they needed
Cas has doubts and insecurities and those bastards at the clinic found the fact that Dean is a loser boyfriend and pressed and pressed and pressed until Cas shattered. Dean uses “I love you” like the good china, bringing it out for anniversaries and holidays, and he loses the only person who’s ever made him happy to be alive because of it.
“Back at ya,” Dean says, and goes to take his place upstage. In the moments as he stands on his mark, his mind tumbles over his every line. When Cas first showed him the play, it was in its first stages and shined like nothing he’d ever read before. Granted, Dean only read SparkNotes of his assigned reading and maybe a Dr. Seuss or two, but still. He could tell that Cas had put everything into this play, so when he asked if Dean would play the lead’s love interest, Dean was shocked. He was flattered, and some part of him couldn’t help but think he could never do his best friend’s play justice. Still, he glides seamlessly through his lines, all the while thanking God that Cas wrote the tale of the eighteenth-century love story in modern English.
“You wouldn’t talk to me for days. I finally had to fill myself with 'monsters' and banish myself to ‘purgatory’ to get you to forgive me.”
“Castiel, do you understand who this is?” The voice asks again, to which Cas pulls the phone away from his face to check the caller ID.
have forgotten my birthday,” Sam cries, spit flinging from his lips and spattering into Dean’s shirt. “I miss her so much,” he says, then apparently, he tires of talking, instead taking to only sobbing into his brother’s shoulder. Dean just holds him tight, running gentle hands through his hair and rubbing soothing circles into his back like he barely remembers his mom doing for him. Eventually, Sam’s sobs slow, and after a few moment of mere clinging, he pulls away, wiping at his eyes. “Jesus Christ,” he says, pushing out a broken and fake laugh. “I’m thirteen years old. I shouldn’t be sobbing like that.”
They barely make it through Cas' front door before they’re clinging and kissing and pushing against each other. Dean makes quick work of urging Cas’ coat to the ground after shrugging out of his own. Their sweaters go next, followed by their undershirts, leaving their hot-skinned chests to press entirely together without restraint. Dean’s fingers begin to fumble blindly with Cas’ belt, but Cas becomes a giggling mess before Dean can get the buckle open.
you, and she seduced me, and I fucked her. I’m so sorry, Cas. I never meant to. Please. Please, forgive me. I’m so fucking sorry, I—” but Cas cuts him off.
“This was never supposed to happen,” Cas mutters, lips barely moving as he speaks. Gabe opens his mouth to speak, but before he can, Cas is snatching his keys off the table and running for the door.
“Okay,” Cas says with a smile, putting Dean's worries at ease. "If that’s what you want, then that’s what I want.” Dean grins at his best friend, a huge weight lifted off his shoulders and a horrible ache unfurling in his gut. The silence they sit in is no longer awkward. It is simply the silence of two people who have spent their entire lives together, who don’t need words to talk. After a moment or two though, Dean decides he wants to talk.
“You don’t get to talk to him like that,” Cas says when he hears the front door shut. His voice is firm, resolute.
“Hey,” he says softly, drawing his thumb across Dean’s face slowly. “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.” Cas stares at Dean for a long moment before a small smile finds its way to his lips. “Just being here with you is enough for now,” and those words are enough to get Dean’s heart rate skittering back to normal.
“Why are you crying?” someone asks, a soft voice that stands over Dean. Dean pushes his face further into his arms. “Come on. Why are you crying?” the kid asks again, and Dean finally pulls his face out of his elbow. The boy before him has a big tuft of light brown hair attached to his skull and big blue eyes.
When Cas opens his eyes, he is confused because he could have sworn when he closed them, he was lying in bed, Mary cuddled against his chest like she hasn’t been in years. Now though, he is standing downstairs, light filtering in through the windows with an ethereal beauty, making the whole library seem to glow.
“Of course, Emma,” he tells her, but for now, he stands back and watches as Dean pulls Emma up to him, sets her on the toes of his good shoes and begins to spin her around. Everyone watching is alight with the sound of her laughter as they twirl. Cas never knew he could love this much.
"Look, lady," Dean starts, sitting up and cocking his head at her. "You don’t know anything about my life or what he’s put Sam and me through."
“No,” Dean admits, laying his head against Cas’. The feeling from last night races through his veins, the feeling that what they’re doing is riding awfully close to the line separating “purely physical” and “full of feelings and shit.”
Its takes him forty minutes, forty minutes of hitched breathing and blinking away tears just so he can see the road. He never thought he’d end up here, running to drink Dean away. In the beginning, he thought Dean would not need to be drowned in alcohol, he thought Dean would be with him forever. Then the clinic happened, and Castiel thought that the end of Dean would be as easy as finishing the steps. He never thought ripping Dean from his veins would be a battle, and it has not been for nearly ten years. Nearly ten years have passed since he left Dean, and only now are those green eyes coming back to haunt him. He cannot do it. He cannot handle thinking of Dean again, cannot handle his many years of hard work becoming nothing.
“They’re having so much fun," she points out, following his train of thought. "We can’t just go home.”
“Needed a little liquid courage to watch the man I love lose everything he cares about,” Cas replies shortly. Gabe says nothing, and Cas looks around. The room is mostly empty, a couple sitting behind Lydia, likely her parents, and a couple behind Cas and Gabe sitting with a young woman. Cas turns slightly to get a better look at them, and when he does, he flashes back to the Fourth of July at fourteen.
The day starts normal. It starts as Steve the Dog—often referred to as such—barking Castiel awake as the coffee pot spews its last drop. It starts as coffee and their morning run and grabbing the mail on the way inside. It starts as a warm shower before sitting down to breakfast and skimming over today’s newspaper. It starts as the crossword, the weather, the finances, and it ends with the letter stuck between the comics and the classifieds. His whole goddamned world ends with that letter.
“Sorry,” he says, voice small. His phone buzzes beside him, it’s Dean, and Charlie stares at it pointedly for a second before continuing.
“I-I would love nothing—ah!—nothing more than to fuck you,” he bites out, panting as Dean sucks hickey after hickey into his neck.
“Not yet. Everyone except Clarence thought the kiss was pretend, but Clarence got scared and ran away from Dean.”
His dad’s voice is harsh, but he is no longer staring at a poor gay couple crossing his path or a TV broadcast about same sex marriage. Instead, he is staring his son dead in the eye telling him he’s worthless because he likes Cas.
“Rise and shine, sleeping beauty,” Steve calls, and it occurs to Cas’ hammering brain that maybe this isn’t Steve, that maybe he’s being robbed or something. In any other circumstances, as in, any time a nearly a quart of alcohol isn’t trying to burn its way out of his system, he might be concerned. Now though, he groans and rubs a hand down his face. He’s too damn hungover to keep his eyes open, too damn hurt to care about anything… He’s never been this hungover before in his life. He’s never had a reason to get as drunk was he was last night before. In fact, the only reason he’s
“Shit,” Dean hisses, closing his eyes and trying to think through the relentless push and swirl of Cas’ tongue. Cas eats him slowly, lapping at his insides again and again just because Dean wants him to. Eventually, he removes his tongue and pushes a tentative finger inside. Dean hisses again, this time recoiling slightly.
“Dean,” Cas says gently and scrubs across his face again. Dean refuses to open his eyes. And then, “Dean, please, look at me.”
“It doesn’t come on until 8,” Cas says with a smile. “Do you think an ice cream date will last five hours?”
“Bela, please,” he gasps, leaning away from her seeking hands and teeth and tongue. “I don’t want to do this.” Bela laughs, her hands demanding of their conquest.
is going on in here?” Bobby shouts above the sound of the one-way fight, coming into view from the back of the house. John, keeping his injured hand tucked to his chest, picks up his other fist and swings at Dean, catching him across the eye because he was distracted by Bobby. Sam is still kneeling dazed on the floor, and Dean sputters blood every time John will give him a moment to. John swings again, but this time, it’s Bobby who jumps in, throwing John off balance and stopping the blow from meeting anything but air. John struggles against Bobby for a moment, but he is too busy screaming profanities at Dean to be
"Define occasionally, because I bet that if we were to go to your home right now, we would fine copious amounts of alcohol."
angry. I understood, understand. I told myself from the very beginning I was just here to apologize, never to try to win you back, unless it was explicitly clear that you wanted it.” A moment passes, Cas staring at Dean. “Is that what you want, Dean?” he asks softly, and Dean scoffs.
“Jesus, what did you make them do? Write a math dissertation?” Dean asks, picking up one of several pages written in the same familiar script. His eyes narrow at it. He flips around for the cover page, one that hopefully has a name on it.
Dean is on a lake, his back to the setting sun and a fishing pole in hand. His eyes are closed. He doesn’t need his eyes open to catch a fish. The breeze ripples the water slightly, coaxing the afternoon heat into a milder evening. It’s nice.
He stays gone for the rest of the morning, only resurfacing to have lunch with Dean and to insist that Dean fix his hair before coming to the school. Dean obliges simply to take some of the stress off Cas’ shoulders, and the next time the curtains part, Dean is ready for the glare of the lights. He is ready for the sudden silence of the crowd. He is ready for the immediate attention, and he works it. He knows Cas will be out shortly, so he performs. He squares his form into the soldier Cas wrote him to be, and delivers his lines. He loses himself in it; so much so that when the curtain closes for intermission at the end of act one, he is left upstage breathing heavily.
Dean hangs up the phone, puts the voicemails away. He barely leaves his bed that day, doesn’t leave the house at all.
before Dean finally decided he was ready, and Cas, having been waiting patiently the whole time, was tickled pink by the hand alone that Dean slid into his.
Dean thinks of his father, of his angry fists, angry words. He thinks of every missed game, every missed birthday. John was never there except to yell at them and beat them. John was never there except to remind them that they were nothing. Cas made him feel like he was worth the whole damn world, and the cycle begins again.
“Dean,” Cas whispers, brushing his finger across Dean’s prostate again, making him jerk. Dean hums an affirmative, and Cas adds another finger. “I love you,” he murmurs, and Dean laughs.
"Did you love her?" he asks, and the look of confusion on Dean's face deepens. "Just trust me, Dean. Did you love her?"
“I’ll be there in a second,” he says, catching a glimpse of his reflection in the windshield. He barely recognizes himself, eyes bloodshot, face pale, hair wild. He closes his eyes, wipes away the remains of his tears and puts his head back on the steering wheel.
Dean hates himself. And suddenly, his own heart stutters up-tempo, arms tightening around Cas just before he finally pushes himself up enough to gaze down at him.
“I see you found her,” she says, and Cas tears his eyes away from his daughter long enough to spare her a smile.
“You got dried drool on your chin, doofus,” Dean says, rolling his eyes and turning away from Sam, his heart rate skipping back down to normal now that he knows his baby brother is safe. He scrubs a hand through his hair and pads off to see what’s gotten John’s drunken undies in a twist, following the sound all the way to the front door. When he gets there, he sees that John is standing in the threshold, arguing with Bobby.
to say. He glances down, and, ah ha! He sees his much needed cocoa powder being held captive within the long, beautiful fingers of the cashier before him. He must have left it at the man’s register in his mad dash to escape his mortification. “Uh, is that mine?” he asks, voice sharp in the awkward silence. The sound makes him cringe, the man before him too, apparently, for he lets out a soft shudder.
Dean's whole body, despite the past and the regret, is singing with the closeness of Him. If Dean thought he was buzzed from Sam, he is positively wasted off Cas. He is completely caught up in the moment, in the movement and the pull of Cas, like it’s all he’s ever known. His life between then and now never existed. All that he is, all that he ever will be, is Cas and the smile he tosses back to him when Dean’s hand reaches to open his door.
“Glad you’re…home,” Dean manages after a bit, glancing over at Cas. The shallow cut on his neck has clotted, but he looks garish and sunken.
“Right, because I don’t hear you two at night,” she says with a roll of her eyes. Dean flushes a deep red, fumbling to think of some way,
“Don’t go, mom,” he pleads, sobbing against her. She strokes his hair and shushes him, tears of her own streaking down her cheeks.
“Hey! Dean!” Garth calls, face lighting up as though he hadn't just seen Dean getting his brains sucked out.
“I don’t appreciate this, Dean Winchester,” Lydia snarls when Emma is out of earshot. “She makes a mess and you reward her for it.”
“You want me to read to you?” Dean asks, smiling at her amusedly. Her eyes sparkle with that undying Winchester mischief, and he knows she will not be sleeping again tonight, monster in her closet or no.
“Castiel,” he hears Naomi call as he passes her office. He pokes his head inside her door, only to see her smiling at him. “Step seven has been completed,” she says. “Are you ready to begin step eight?” Castiel nods, so she waves him forward to sit at her desk. “Step eight is to make a list of your trespasses, in other words, make a list of those you’ve harmed because of your sickness. Write them apologies. This step will take as much courage as your moral inventory, so be proactive about it.” Castiel nods, eyes wide as though he is taking in directions for making the perfect cheesy garlic biscuits. Naomi passes Castiel several sheets of paper and a pen to match. Castiel takes that as his cue to leave.
“You like the pie? Cas made it,” Sam says a couple days later, watching as the pie Dean was enjoying becomes ruined.
Once the tickets are bought, they sit shoulder to shoulder in silence through the previews and when the movie starts, Dean manages to turn the thoughts of Cas into a mere nagging in the back of his mind. The movie Sam picked actually turns out to be pretty funny, so naturally, he glances to his little brother, hoping to share in the joy. What isn’t natural is looking over to where his little brother just sat and seeing bright blue eyes staring forward in wonder, lips busted and parted. Dean reels, the memory washing over him.
” Naomi spits, interrupting Charlie's verbal porno. Cas watches at least half the girls in the room shift, crossing their legs a bit tighter than necessary. “You are dismissed from group.” Charlie whoops and stands.
“Cas,” he shouts, pushing through the people until he is standing directly in front of Cas, that dopey grin still on his face. Cas smiles at Dean, stubbly cheeks almost swallowing his eyes. “Do you want a drink?” Dean asks, leaning close so Cas can hear him over the music. He smells like cologne and strawberry shampoo.
,” Dean snorts in playful contempt, following Cas' eyes to the colorful animations on the screen. Cas glances up to Dean and smiles.
Dean would deny it, if he were regaining motor-control at all. As it is, all he can do is shudder beside Cas, the warmth of his knee pressed to Dean’s the only warmth he’s known in what feels like eons.
CURTAINS FALL WITH A SWOOSH. Okay, so... What are you guys thinking? Love me? Hate me? Secretly planning to murder me? Not so secretly planning to murder me? Any of the above, I would not blame you for. (Except maybe loving me, cause like, did you read that chapter? I am a terrible human being.)
Driving back to Him is nothing. It is a single heartbeat, the flash of a camera, one instant indiscernible from the next. It is the space between one word and the next. Dean blinks, and it is gone. He blinks, and he is there at the motel, fist slamming against Sam’s door because he doesn’t know which one is Cas’. Sam comes out almost as soon as the banging starts sporting eyes wild and hair rumpled.
Dean grins and jogs back to his garage. A few moments later, he is staring back up at the sign, tools in hand and an itch to take.
“My mind is made up,” Dean says firmly, staring back at Bobby until the old man looks away, sadness on his face.
Cas rolls out of bed, showers, kicks the foot of the couch to wake Sam up—can't let him be late for his shmancy lawyer job—, and takes Steve out for a walk. He dresses, makes breakfast, eats, and heads to work, all the while singing some song Dean has been humming for days. When he gets to the office, he begins work on the play, and before he knows it, his script has reached the halfway point and Charlie is telling him to take the rest of the day off, so he does. He calls Dean, and one after the other, they pull into Dean’s driveway.
