“Do you want to watch a movie or something?” Dean called from the kitchen. “Or we could go out for ice cream? It’s still early.”
“Hm, yeah,” Dean said, “Why would I? Every orgasm you have just gets me that much closer to putting my cock in you, doesn’t it?”
Castiel eyed Dean warily, taking a step back as Dean looked at him with such intense honesty. He felt this pull towards the King, like something inside him was telling him to go to the alpha.
Cas set the note back down before checking the time. Seven fifty six. He immediately brightened up know that Dean should be here rather soon so he walked out onto his balcony and waited. The fresh air helped to clear his head and ease some of the pain he felt.
. And the only thing you’re going to be able to focus on is my cock inside you, slamming into you over and over again with no rest. You got that?”
Dean sucked in a breath, “Stop it.”
“You remember the safeword and colors?” Dean asked.
“Dean,” Cas whined, feeling heat start to pool in his abdomen. He gasped as he felt Dean pull out. “No!” Dean shushed him as he turned Cas around and hooked his arms under his knees.
to my ears.” Cas grinned and blushed, bringing a hand up to run through Dean’s hair. “Helps to push me over the edge faster, squarely.”
— as Dean called it earlier that night — on Dean’s face. He brought it to his mouth and smiled when Dean’s eyes darted down to watch him suck his finger clean.
“Did I do that?” Cas asked, pointing at Dean’s neck.
“Meg, it’s getting late. I’m tired, I know you are, too, so, let’s go to bed for the night and we can talk in the morning, okay?” Castiel said, and he couldn’t even be bothered to try and keep the hope out of his voice.
“What about her?”
When Castiel had heard the knock on his door, he practically ran to answer it, smiling so wide his cheeks hurt, as he saw it was Dean.
“I want that, I really do, but I need you to know I’m not—I’ve been with o-other omega’s…before,” Dean said, and his voice was full of some kind of worry. It baffled Castiel because of course Dean had to have been with other omega’s before. Not only was Dean physically attractive, but he was a beautiful soul, too. He was bright and kind, and if Castiel had fallen for him, there was no doubt that others had fallen for Dean, too.
“And love you, we do,” Charlie interrupted, stepping up behind the two and giving Dean a hug. “Happy birthday.”
“What?” Cas’s heart started to drop. “You don’t like him?”
“His Majesty has... Omegas on his council?” Alfie said slowly.
Dean nodded. “I do.”
“No,” Cas groaned as he sat down to pull his shoes on.
“I’m sure I don’t know,” Cas said, trying to wriggle away from this man. “Can you please get your—”
“How will I know if he’s ready or not?”
“That was

your father’s son,” Castiel said, and he almost felt bad at the look of utter shame that crossed Dean's face.
Dean looked at him with an amused look. “You do understand you’re about to set foot on a pirate ship, right? There’s nothing “professional” that goes on on my ship. Well, except Benny’s cooking.”
Castiel rested his head on Dean’s shoulder and smiled apologetically.
“Do you?” Dean laughed, quirking an eyebrow.
“It’s…tough,” Rachel said, and there was a weird edge to her words that didn’t track with the grief they both had to be feeling. “Cas, are you… Are you inching away from me?”
“We’ll clean up in the morning,” Dean whispered, “Got to sleep, angel. I got you.” He turned onto his side to rest his forehead against Cas’s.
“Knock or sound the bell, Dean,” the woman said. Dean looked away from Castiel.
“No,” Cas pleaded. “Please just take me already. Just fuck me so hard I black out.”
Cas smiled. “I’d agree.”
“You’ve been mopey for the past two months since we left. You used to joke a lot more than you do now, you know.” Dean felt like she was accusing him of something. “You’re not your regular self. And if I say so myself, it’s a little annoying.” He immediately went on the defense.
“H-huh… H-how?” Cas asked, feeling the heat in his abdomen, not building or falling; just burning. Dean kept him there with every movement of his hips.
“You,” Castiel said. Dean stared at him, unblinking as he processed that.
“Yes,” Cas spoke, “You gave me a family. You gave me something no one else could.”
The man who attacked him turned his attention to Benny. It gave Castiel just enough time to catch his breath again and get up. He saw Benny fighting the man and the man wasn’t actually holding his own. It threw Castiel for a loop because there had never been someone that could stand up to Benny’s strength and speed, but this man was… Castiel watched as the man was able to lift Benny up and slam him back down on the ground. And Benny didn’t get back up right away.
“I love you,” he whispered, rolling them onto their sides.
Castiel put his hand on Meg’s shoulder to comfort her. She gave him a smile in thanks, and then continued.
still interested, I think you’re ready, too,” he said, tugging on Dean’s cock just enough to get his point across.
Dean said, and Castiel was glad that they weren’t talking in person because with how hot his face was it would have been embarrassing. He wanted to answer, he really did, but he couldn’t get his voice to work.
Amara scowled at him. “Everyone has a price.”
“Please,” Cas begged. “Please, Dean.”
my type.”
“Yeah?” Cas said, yawning.
“It’s good to finally meet you,” Amara said, smiling wide. Her teeth were almost too white and if Castiel hadn’t chugged some of that absinthe, he probably would have been slightly worried. But in his buzzed state, he was just upset Amara came and messed up his time with Gadreel. “I’ve been trying to chat for quite some time, and I had hoped it would be in a more private setting than this, but you are a hard one to catch.”
“Is Jane there?” she asked, and Castiel tried to keep his distance and not eavesdrop despite the way voices always tended to carry in the library. “I want to talk to her!” Rachel almost shouted. “Inias, she’s my daughter. I have a right to—Inias!”
“Oh, no,” Cas shook his head. “I’m the one who put the extra pepper in it.” Michael gave his son a long look before standing back up.
“It’s hardly morning,” Cas groaned. “It’s two A.M.”
“Yes, he has said that since he met you. Although, I do recall him deliberately not saying those words
Rachel gasped, and Castiel smiled up at Dean as he nodded.
“I’m okay,” Dean said, lifting his head. He had a smile on his face as he straightened his spine. “I’m just processing everything.”
"I..." Lisa took a moment to look into Dean’s eyes before she nodded. “Thank you.” Tears falling from her eyes. Happy tears. Dean grinned as he took Lisa’s hand and they walked in together and got Ben.
Cas buried his face in Dean’s hair and cried. “I was there for nine years, Cas.
“Well,” Cas bit his lip, “There’s no reason we can’t go somewhere else.”
Chapter Eleven
Cas’s back healed up nicely. Gilda had said it was almost too quickly; even for one of her spells. Neither Dean or Cas were complaining though. Cas’s self-healing abilities just made it easier for them to be intimate in the way they both wanted.
“Today has been the best I have had in a long time,” he said.
“What about stop?” Cas asked, furrowing his brows at Dean.
“Where do we go now?” Dean asked, coming to a slow stop when they reached the spot where the gate opened into the city of Heaven.
“Yeah, why not? We already share a room and we’re basically married anyway—did you know that if you live in the same house with your partner for seven years, a common law marriage is issued,” he said, coming over to press Dean up against the counter by the sink.
“Okay,” he started. “If I help you with your homework will you forgive me?”
Cas was getting so into he almost didn’t notice when he felt Dean’s length push into his hip. It made him smile to know that he could do that to Dean. Cas reached his hand down and felt Dean, making the taller man grunt again before pulling him into the dark of Cas’s bedroom.
“Please,” Castiel said, “Please knot me, please?”
“Dean!” Cas managed to get out. Dean turned his attention back to the whimpering mess before him and smiled.
“It does look like we’re true mates,” Castiel said, darting his eyes between the greenest green he’d ever seen.
“I don’t want to hurt you more,” Dean argued.
“I cry your mercy?” Alfie exclaimed. It was Charlie’s turn to look perplexed now.
“Yes?”
Castiel shook his head. “No, I’m quite ordinary.”
“We can’t keep the cat.”
“Heya, Cas,” Dean’s voice pulled Castiel out of his own head. “I got you a coffee.”
“Cas—why—when—what the
Castiel rolled his eyes, but smiled still. Cain smiled amusedly and nodded.
Castiel grabbed the change of clothes and the towel and quickly showered, feeling better than he had in years as he put on Dean’s old clothes, even if his stomach was growling at him. And when he made his way through the house to the entry hall, he saw Dean standing there holding two sandwiches.
Castiel’s stomach twisted, and what scared him to his core was that it wasn’t twisting in alarm. It was churning with something pleasant and warm. “So?” Castiel heard his voice break. He had to cough to get it back to normal. “I don’t want anything to do with you. You’re an alpha.”
“Please fuck me,” Cas whispered, blushing slightly at the dirty word. “Please, I want to feel your cock inside me.”
“He just kneed me in the stomach,” Cas cried. “Please make it stop.”
“What that’s?” Cas asked, scrunching his eyebrows together.
“I do,” Cas whispered. “And I did.”
“You don’t have the right to speak, here, Castiel,” Jo said, and the iciness to her voice made Castiel want to disappear.
jump through time. This is the product of jumping through time. Today.”
Dean was determined to make his angel feel as amazing as possible. He wanted to show Cas how much he treasured him. Dean hummed around his angel and pushed his hands under Cas’s shirt, running his hands over Cas’s sensitive nipples. He pinched and pulled on them before massaging his thumbs over them.
Dean groaned, closing his eyes and letting himself relax into Cas’s touches. He could feel each and every one of his nerves on fire and his lungs start to burn from the limited supply of oxygen he was getting. The feeling of Cas’s mouth working over the head of his cock and his hands squeezing and pumping along his shaft was divine. Dean started repeating Cas’s name as if he was praying. “I’m gonna come, Cas,” he gasped, moaning loudly and gripping Cas’s hair. “I’m so close.”
“I don’t have a boyfriend at the moment,” Castiel said softly, “a-and I heard that birthdays were a good time to…do it.”
“Yeah, I can feel you,” Dean said, and Castiel collapsed against him, shaking and whimpering for several long minutes until Dean gave one last thrust up into Castiel and emptied another load in the omega.
just come. You sure you’ve been fucked before?”
Castiel looked past Dean’s frame and nodded behind him. “I’m going that way,” he said, surprising both himself and Dean that he was agreeing to letting a perfect stranger walk him home. Well, part way home. Dean was, after all, a stranger; an alpha stranger, and Castiel figured he should probably err on the side of caution.
“I am very happy to meet you,” he said without thinking. Gilda smiled back at him, and her smile was like nothing Castiel had ever seen. It was like she was casting a spell on him.
Castiel gave this little cry of surprise against Dean’s mouth and Dean groaned in appreciation as he felt the omega slick even more.
“Gotcha,” Dean said, smiling at Cas.
Dean shook her off, “Cas bit me when I jumped off his house. I was too far up, I should’ve gone down farther before jumping. That’s probably what made his spleen rupture.”
Cas closed his eyes and blocked out the rest of what Crowley kept on saying about
Castiel looked up at her. “This is...” he searched for a word. This was all so new and overwhelming. He’d never had such fine foods given to him and now he had what looked to be everything for him to choose from. He even figured he could ask for wine or ale and be given it. “This is a lot of cheese,” Castiel settled on saying. Jess pursed her lips and nodded in understanding.
“Alfie?” He said. Castiel looked from the man to Alfie, frowning in confusion.
“For someone who hangs out with pirates, you sure are an old maid.”
Castiel closed his eyes and replayed that over again in his head.
“But I do,” Dean whispered. Cas brought his unoccupied hand up to Dean’s hair and ran it through, just the way he knew Dean liked. “I do. I want to. I want to tell you. I trust you.”
Castiel immediately looked up at Charlie, desperate to learn the secret of how to make his own heat go away. “How do you make them?” He asked, “What do you use?”
Cas was still standing in the middle of the room, shifting from foot to foot and watching his father warily. “I’m sorry, father,” Cas whispered, expecting his father to just glare at him. But the next thing he knew, his father’s hands were on his shoulders and pulling him down to violently knee him in the stomach.
“Do you want to take a shower?”
“Leave,” Castiel said. “Leave now and stay the fuck away from me.”
Benny sighed. “Maybe. Dean?”
“Your mouth,” he got out, “H-how?”
The look in Cas's eyes had Dean fighting even harder for breath. And the emotion in Dean's made Cas want to melt.
“He’s not here,” Dean said after a solid half minute of silence.
“Oh, my god, Dean,” he gasped, eyes wide and heart pounding. “I—” Cas choked, a blush coming to his face. “I’m sorry. I tried to get the words out to tell you I was going to come, but—”
“My father doesn't care that deeply about pirates,” Cas said quietly.
“I can see nine so far, but there are more coming in from behind them,” Benny said quietly.
“Lucifer,” Dean said, smiling as Cas came over and molded himself to his side. “Meet Cas.” He pecked Cas on the lips, sliding his arm around Cas’s waist as he looked back at a pale faced Lucifer. “My one and only.”
“I almost killed them.”
“Cas,” Dean moaned, placing sloppy and wet open mouthed kisses all along the soft skin of Cas’s neck. Cas inhaled quickly as his hips jerked of their own accord into Dean’s with no real coordination. He panted and gripped onto Dean’s hands tightly.
Cain’s eyes widened and his face broke out into a smile. He laughed heartily and slapped Dean on the back hard enough to make him stumble.
“Oh, and take these,” Gadreel said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small plastic bag with two small pink pills. Castiel nodded, and Gadreel let go of his arm. “In other news, Rachel rescheduled the fight tomorrow tonight.”
“Because I’m more than just my status, just as everyone else is. I’m an alpha, but that’s not all that I am.” Dean gestured to Castiel. “You’re an omega, but you’re not
Castiel had to pinch himself to keep his mind from drifting. “You can’t?”
“I missed you, too, Cas,” Dean breathed out, picking Cas up and ignoring the shooting pain he felt emanating from where he'd been shot. He tilted his head back to keep their lips connected as Cas was lifted higher. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and kissed Dean desperately. “I love you, Cas.”
“Really?” he asked.
This time, Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
“Knot me,” he cried, barely aware that it was his own voice saying these things. “Alpha, please, knot me!
“It doesn’t matter,” Rachel said, and brushed past Castiel briskly. She paused at the exit and didn’t face him as she said, “You’re an adult, Castiel. You’re responsible for your own life.”
The older omega took a step back and nodded for the rest of the women to do the same. She put her hands up in a gesture of something like surrender.
“No, don’t beat yourself up about this,” he said, throwing a leg across Dean’s hips. “It’s not your job to pay attention to every little detail about me or my behavior or whatever.”
Dean breathed out, smiling as his thoughts ran rampant about Cas. All the things they had already done together and all the things they still yet to do. He thought about their first night together. The way Cas had looked at him like he’d been shown a new world. Which in a way was true. In another way, Cas had shown Dean a new world, too. A better world.
Dean took him to the dining hall, and Castiel felt even giddier as he saw that Dean had the table prepared already. There were two diner plate cloches, one at Dean’s usual head of the table seat, and then one at the spot to the right of Dean’s. Castiel’s usual seat at the table.
Cas’s eyes blinked slowly, still coming back from his pleasure trip. His neck was peppered with light pink spots and his mouth hung open. Dean wanted Cas to not regret this night. He leaned down and kissed him lovingly. Cas responded rather quickly, yet with sloppier precision. But it didn't bother Dean in the slightest.
Meg and Charlie shared a look, both nodding once before they grabbed Castiel and rushed him back to his room, ignoring his questions of what they were doing and the stares they got from anyone they passed. They practically slammed open his door when they got to his room, and then threw him onto his bed, sitting down with him mere moments later.
“Cas, wait,” he said, “We should talk about this.”
“He said I had the prettiest bones he’d ever seen.”
“Hm, you should see yourself,” Dean said, bringing his hand up to suck his fingers into his mouth. Castiel gasped softly as he watched Dean, letting out this small sigh of contentedness. When the taste of the omega’s slick exploded over Dean’s taste buds, his eyes rolled into his head and he moaned deeply.
“Anything for you,” Dean added another finger and rubbed against that special spot that made his boy writhe.
He imagined Cas beneath him, panting and begging for more. More of
Castiel gasped sharply, sobbing a little as he begged, “No! Please!” Dean looked back up at his omega. “Oh, please, Alpha!” Castiel chewed on his bottom lip. His eyes fluttered as Dean gently dragged his nail across his rim and he cried out, “Alpha! Please!?”
Castiel looked into Ellen’s eyes. He looked deeply, searching for any tiny sign of deceit. Only sincerity and other soft emotions shone back at him, and he slowly moved to grab the bread from Ellen.
Dean sighed. “She rigs the fights. Makes deals with fighters who are doing well. She tells them to lose a fight that she sets up against someone who would never stand a chance against them if it were a fair match. I’ve never known someone to refuse because people are too scared to say no to her,” he said, “She’s been trying to make that same deal with you for the past year, Cas, it’s why she would visit your trailer. It’s why I was able to spend so much time with you.”
“Well, Cas,” Dean said as he took Cas’s shaft in his hand and pumped his fist. “You disobeyed an order.”
I? If
Castiel looked back up to see Dean staring intently at him, a concerned look on his face.
Dean turned around slowly, waiting until he was completely facing Castiel to answer. “No, I don’t. I never have.”
“Alright,” Dean breathed out, closing his eyes and gripping Cas’s thighs. Cas could tell he was having a hard time controlling himself.
Dean was silent for a short while. Castiel could tell by his scent what he was feeling. Anger and disgust—towards the alphas who’d hurt him; sorrow and sympathy—for what he’d had to go through; and weaved through it all was love—for him.
Castiel groaned and swung his legs over his bed to stand up, grabbing Gadreel’s shoulder to stabilize himself as his vision blurred.
Castiel darted his gaze between Dean’s watering eyes, blinking away the itch he felt behind his own eyes. “Okay,” he said, and a tear finally fell down Dean’s face, “Yeah, of course, Dean. I promise.”
Dean smiled and then looked past Castiel to Jess. “And you, Jess?”
It wasn’t until Dean pulled away from him that he finally remembered where he was, and his guard went back up immediately. He turned around and pressed his back to Dean as he wrapped them in a protective barrier.
“Let me just ask you this: how
“Go slow, babe.”
Alfie jolted forward. “Benny!” He cried, stumbling towards the bar. Castiel gasped in utter shock. The man—Benny jumped over the bar in one movement and ran to Alfie, scooping him up off the floor as they reached each other. Castiel could feel his eyes begin to itch, and happiness flooded him because that man, the owner of this tavern was Benny Lafitte. Alfie’s true mate.
“Me, too,” Dean said. He slid his hands to the back of Cas’s thighs and hoisted him up, carrying him to his cabin swiftly and laying him down on his bed gingerly — like Cas was a priceless piece of art.
Cas stayed quiet and let Dean cry into his neck. He closed his eyes and cradled Dean’s body into his for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry he did that to you. You don’t deserve that… You deserve so much
“They are called sunflowers,” Dean said.
“I don’t invite my friends over because I’d rather be in bed with your brother—”
Castiel winced and gagged at that bit of information. “That’s…”
“Dean!” Chuck yelled in surprise. “They’re raising their flags!”
“What do you care?” Castiel said, an odd feeling of indignation flaring up inside him because who was she to question who he spent his time with? It wasn’t like they were close. He hadn’t seen Rachel in six years, and now she felt like she had the right to question him?
“Please,” Cas whined, pulling at his restraints. “Don’t tease me.”
“Cas,” Dean warned, because he didn’t need his boyfriend waxing poetic about his dick in the middle of the kitchen while his brother was just down the hall.
“What?” Castiel asked, wrapping his arms around Meg’s waist and holding tight, “What does that mean? What do I do?”
“Are you going that way, though?”
“Oh, great,” Rachel said, sighing and turning to go back inside. “Let the show begin.”
“I am good.”
“Meg!” he sighed in relief, “You scared me!”
When Castiel woke up again, he didn’t bolt right up like he had last time. What woke him pulled him from sleep peacefully. It was like he stretched himself awake. And when he was completely awake, he couldn’t ever remember feeling this well rested.
“Trust me, the way I’ve done it will be more comfortable,” he said. “Do me a favor and push against the slats in the headboard as hard as you can while I tighten these? And tell me if it’s too much, okay?”
“You’re so
Cas's birthday is approaching and Dean seems to have something planned. Right as things are about to get steamy between the two, a woman comes along and is hysterically asking to see Dean. Long story made short (as to not give away key details) Dean's got two more people in his crew by the end of the day.
The reason is because I'm not entirely happy with how I've written this fic. I don't like my actual writing, and I don't like the plot points that I've added and how I've strayed from the tumblr post that inspired this fic. And I believe that there's way to much smut. (It's in almost every chapter. It's gone past too much smut.) I can partially attribute that to the fact that I did start this fic right when I got into writing smut, so I got totally carried away. I really want to apologize to you all for that because it’s probably been very tiring to read.
“Please,” Cas whined again. Dean rolled his neck and crawled up to sit between Cas’s spread legs.
“You haven’t,” Sam laughed a little. “I’m
Rachel growled in frustration and slammed the receiver down, staring at it in a rage. Her anger was powerful enough that Castiel could begin to detect hints of it in her scent. It made him cough and his eyes water. Anger wasn’t a pleasant scent on anyone. It made it feel like you were inhaling smoke.
“I have a friend who owns a tavern with great food,” Dean said.
The mother cradled the crying child into her, rocking and shushing him. She looked up at Dean with watery eyes. Recognition set into her features and she tensed up. Dean took another step back.
“Sh,” Dean whispered, kissing the corners of his mouth. “You’re doing so good, baby, so good.”
“What is that supposed to mean?”
“Thank you,” Dean said quietly, hugging Charlie tightly. After he pulled away, Dean was bombarded with hugs and wishes of
“Oh, Dean, please!” Cas begged his voice sounding like a sob. Dean pulled his fingers out and undid his pants, pushing them down enough to get to his own manhood.
“Of?”
“Really?” Dean asked, pushing up Cas’s shirt to take a look. “That’s nice of him.”
Michael paused, darting his eyes to Cas before he cleared his throat and answered.
“Castiel,” Alfie’s voice pulled Cas out of his thoughts. “Uh, well, her Royal Highness, Princess Meg is here to speak with you.”
“I got you, baby,” Dean whispered, pressing Cas down into the mattress with his body.
Castiel arched up at the same time as he squeezed down and grew even slicker.
“Does this hurt?” Dean asked, lifting his head to look at Cas.
A few minutes later, Cas gasped, “Dean.” And pulled at the ropes around his wrists. “I wanna touch you.”
“Yes,” Alfie said, looking at Jess expectantly, waiting for her to continue with a better explanation. Jess’s only further explanation was her face turning pink and a string of incoherent words. She looked about five seconds from spontaneously combusting when the door to Castiel’s room opened, and in walked Charlie and then Ellen.
“Yes,” Castiel said. They passed patch of tall yellow flowers, and Castiel had to pause to look at them. They were absolutely beautiful, and so bright. Like the sun itself had colored the petals.
“Oh, aye; you best believe it. He didn’t used to be handsome. He used to be downright
“I bet I could’ve made it really...” Cas paused, making Dean looked up at him curiously. “...special for you.”
“I got you,” Cas soothed, pulling Dean into him and rolling onto his back with Dean on top of him.
“How often?” Dean asked, brushing past Cas’s prostate and making him jerk himself into Dean.
Cas smiled at how happy Dean looked, filling his plate with a slice from as many of the dishes as he could. He sat down across from the Captain and felt an overwhelming surge of warmth flow through his body. This was Dean…
being truthful, and that Dean was a good man…
“Honestly?” Cas asked, feeling the corners of his mouth pulled upwards.
Cas snorted and nodded his head. Dean did do that. He was humble when it came to himself, but if it was about the people he loved, there was no limit to how far he would go.
“You can fall asleep if you want to, babe.”
“You’re joking, right, Jo?” Benny said, “You can’t be serious.”
Dean mocked innocence. “Oh, I haven’t proposed yet?” he asked, grabbing Castiel’s hips to pull their bodies together.
“No,” he said, “Not yet, I mean.”
bit of a jerk.
Castiel recognized those voices. The first had been Dean, and the second had been one of his trusted advisers, an alpha named Robert Singer; everyone called him Bobby.
“What?” Fear flashed through Cas’s eyes. “Is Dean alri—” he cut himself off, schooling his features again. “What are you trying to tell me?” He asked.
the only thing he knew.
him — threatened the man
Dean laughed, as well; he moved his arms around to encircle Cas. “Thank you.”
“Yeah?”
“How do you feel?” She asked softly. Castiel could only groan in response. Ellen smiled softly at him. “I understand,” she said. Castiel buried his face in his pillow and groaned again.
“I mean, back in my early twenties I would pop cherries left and right but I turned twenty-six in January, and now that I’ve had six months to let that sink in…oh, I don’t know.” Dean shrugged. “I feel like I should really be trying to settle down and have sex with people who know what they’re doing.”
Benny rolled his eyes, “‘Cause you’ll probably want one tomorrow. Or the next day, or sometime in the future.”
Rachel just glared. “We need to talk,” she said through gritted teeth.
“What are you doing?” Dean asked, watching Benny.
“Cas,” Dean said, making Castiel jump and put his hands out in defense. Dean immediately backed up and hunched in on himself in an effort to seem smaller. “Oh, jeez, I’m sorry!”
Castiel opened his mouth to answer, but stopped himself because the sentiment Alfie had left him with replayed in his head,
Castiel looked towards the door. Having Alfie here would help him calm down. He also hoped his mother might come, too. Friendly faces to be around during this time would be greatly comforting. “Will... Will my mother come too?”
Crowley only laughed, raising his wine glass in Meg’s direction before downing the rest of it and then calling for more. Meg scoffed, again, and rolled her eyes. Again. She took a moment to stretch out before turning to look at Michael.
“Just,” Dean paused, he wiped the tear from his face and rubbed at his eyes to stop more from falling. “Just be careful, please.”
A child’s scream had him shooting his head up and looking in the direction of the noise. He saw Dean catching Ben as the boy fell and then throwing him up again, eliciting another scream from Ben. The happy grin on Dean’s face and the laughing from Ben had Cas forming a smile of his own. Dean was a great man. He was fair and just. Which, unfortunately to some, meant that he had to bend the law.
Castiel’s watch beeped, and he begrudgingly started getting off the bed, but Dean stopped him.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Attractive, boyish, slender, little to no body hair.”
Cas saw Lucifer roll his eyes before craning his head around to look at Dean. “Is it against the rules to try and get with a pretty little twink on your ship or something?”
Castiel groaned. “What about?”
~  ~  ~
“God,” Dean muttered kissing up Cas’s body before capturing his lips again. He smirked before quickly flipping Cas onto his stomach and pulling him onto his hands and knees. “
want to call? I’ll give you the phone, Cas, I’d understand because I feel like a fucking pedo—”
“Yes,” the King said, making the move to turn around. Castiel immediately looked to the ground, but kept his ears open and his body ready to move if anything changed. “Is that what you wish to do, then?”
, Dean!” Cas begged, thrusting his hips up again. Dean had to take a moment to comprise himself. Cas had just cursed in front of him. Cas - the walking definition of innocence - had
“We could watch a movie?”
“No! Do not leave me,” Castiel whimpered, “Please. Do not stop.”
“I have news for you, Winchester,” Cas said, smiling. “You’ve already got me.”
Then, Castiel saw a glimmer of his future with Dean. Of the pups they would have, and of how happy he was being mated to Dean. The last thing he saw was Dean as an old man, smiling at him like he’d hung the stars.
stunning
“No, please! Please don’t stop!” Cas begged. “Please, I was so close!”
“I understand,” Crowley said. “Seeing as my daughter’s previous husband came to an…untimely demise in a hunting accident before producing an heir, I’ll keep that in mind while I think this proposal over.”
None of the other safe places were viable options to leave Cas because only Bobby knew where they were and now that Abbadon had been to visit him, there was a major chance she had the map of where each house was, and if the positions were reversed, Dean would have a team staked out at each place in case Abbadon or Abbadon’s loyalists showed up.
Dean didn’t know him. How could he be in love with him?
“Yeah, probably,” Cas said quietly. He let Gilda guide him to his and Dean’s room, waiting until she left and after she said goodnight to undress and get into his night clothes. After that, he snuggled under the covers of his bed and closed his eyes.
“I do not want to accept Dean’s—” Castiel cut himself off as he doubled over in pain again. His omega was going utterly savage and would not let him finish that sentence.
’ Winchester.”
Castiel took no pause and laid flat on Arkangel’s back, rolling to the side. He felt the swipe of claws tear into his side and he wanted to scream out because it hurt, but he ignore it. Instead, he pushed up with the arm he had left and spun Arkangel around Abomination so that they were both facing away from each other. He kicked his foot out behind him with all his might, feeling it connect with Abomination’s spine. A loud crack sounded through the arena and Abomination screeched. The crowd’s cheering seemed to pause for just a breath before it doubled. When Castiel righted Arkangel he spun around to see the beastie on his hands and knees with the middle of his spine caved in.
Amara screeched and Castiel felt a burst of pain near his cheekbone. He vaguely realized she’d gotten a punch in, but he just ignored the pain and kept hitting. It wasn’t a great plan, Castiel knew in the back of his mind, but he didn’t care.
“Yeah.” Dean nodded. “My brother, Sam, he’s getting married next month.”
“Cas.” Dean let his eyes drift closed. Cas looked up at him and watched his face until the pirates eyes snapped open again. His hand fisted itself in Cas’s dark locks. Dean’s lips twitched up in a smile as he moaned. “I don’t know how you do it, but I can’t seem to control myself with your mouth doing the things it does to me. I hate it.”
“I think part of the size of everything this year is because Benny wanted to show off to the new crew members,” Cas said, poking at his food. He’d taken several bites of his food, but that was all. The food was good, but he didn’t have an appetite. “That or it was Dean who told him to make so much so that Dean could show off how great Benny is at that he does.”
“Are you kidding? Of course, you should’ve!” Rachel hugged him again, and the way she smiled at Castiel as they pulled away for the second time made him smile, too. “It’s been too long.”
Though, the only reason he was even allowed into the kitchen was because he needed to be schooled as if he himself were royalty and the kitchen was perfect for that when things were slow.
“You’re gonna have to make this up to me,” he said, grabbing his wet clothes and heading into the half-pantry/half-laundry room connected to their kitchen. Dean could hear the washer door being opened and then a few seconds later it closed again. “You’re gonna make me hot cocoa—a lot of it, and with those mini marshmallows—while I go and take a warm bath.“
“Um, I guess,” Castiel said, “I didn’t really have the best relationship with him, if I’m being honest.”
“Cas, I… You… We…” Rachel started, and before Castiel could react she was surging forward faster than Castiel had ever seen her move and wrapping him up in a hug. “Thank god! We were so worried about you!”
Castiel looked down to the floor. This was a lot to take in. Almost too much. He wasn’t sure what to do with this information.
“Well, you’re not a bad person,” Cas countered.
“They
“What do you mean?”
Metanoia - a transformative change of heart. | Song Recommendation (and title inspiration) - None
They stayed like that for a long time before either of them moved. Cas felt something wet on the tips of his fingers. He looked at them and gasped in panic. “Exactly,” Dean pushed his face into Cas’s neck. “Breakfast should be ready by now.”
Cas chewed his bottom lip in an effort to stop from breaking out into a huge grin, but it didn’t work well and he ended up just dragging Dean down to kiss him, whispering against the man’s lips, “Yes.”
Dean smiled as he rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to call you out for all the lying because it’s not my business…but you should know you are
“Well, you know now,” Ruby said, just a slight sneer to her voice. “Anyway, when would you like to have the wedding commence? I suppose you’ll want another summer wedding?”
“Hush,” Castiel said, smiling. “Let it go.” He went over to the refrigerator to grab a drink.
“Absolutely not,” He said, and this time the shock was clear on Abbadon’s face. Dean called over his shoulder, “Benny!” And then smiled at Abbadon. “There are some people who deserve your blood more than me, and no matter how much I want it to be me who kills you, I want more to live through this day.”
“No.” Jo stood up and shook her head. “This was what I wanted to talk about.”
“Is everyone out?” Someone else yelled from the other sides of the carriages.
Cas didn’t have to do much to make Dean feel good, though; but he was always so eager to try new things to please Dean, anyway. It warmed Dean’s heart and made him love Cas even more. A feat he thought impossible. Cas always had a way of showing Dean a new depth to something he’d thought he’d already explored, though.
“Hey,” Sam responded back, smiling as well.
“I’m sorry father,” Cas turned to face his father, not meeting his eyes. “I woke up early and went to the library. I lost track of time again.”
“My father— ” Cas convulsed as a wave of pain shot through him. “—hit me in the stomach.”
“Okay,” Cas almost sobbed. “Okay, can you just hold me now?”
Just like Dean’s first week back, the second one — the one leading up to Cas’s nineteenth birthday — went by faster than either of them would’ve liked.
Dean snorted, because no way had Castiel actually been blown or eaten out. And Dean could prove it. He shifted his weight back into his knees so he could snake his free hand down to tease at Castiel’s entrance. A smile came to his face because what that got him was slick, more slick, and even more slick as he slowly started to ease his finger into Castiel’s tight hole.
Castiel inhaled sharply, like the notion that Dean would please him again surprised him. He nodded his head, and hummed happily as he felt Dean’s hand start moving again slowly.
Castiel scoffed, anger rising in him. “What is it really that you want to know, Dean? You want to know my
“It’s Cas,” Cas stated. “And you can come, too, you know? You don’t have to stay here either.”
“I love you,” Dean laughed, kissing the top of Cas’s head.
“It’s easy, Cas,” Ava said, using his nickname. It sounded like a threat coming from her. “Just tell me that when Dean comes back you’ll get me on board. And then, you’ll convince him to take me.”
“Have you?” Cas began tapping his foot nervously. Those flags were the flags Dean used to signal his status to other pirates in the sea. They had the same sun and pentagram all his mates had to get tattooed on themselves when they joined his crew. It was the Winchester Insignia.
“Yes,” Cas breathed out, nodding his head vigorously. He slid his hands down Dean’s arms until he could encircle the man’s wrists. “
“I know what you’re going to say,” Cas interrupted, leaning forward to brush his nose against Dean's. “Don’t.”
“I love you, too, angel,” Dean replied. “And out of bed, you’re really good at keeping me sane when things get rough,” he said, almost like he was shy.
First, Jess and Alfie did his hair. Jess trimmed it, and helped him tame it as much as possible, but when she couldn’t get it to do what she wanted, Alfie stepped in. He had years of practice with Castiel’s hair and it took him no time to get it brushed out to look nice.
“No!” Cas gasped, trying to rock up into Dean. He felt the faintest brush of skin on skin and that’s when he noticed that he and Dean were naked. “Please, I want to.”
“My father—”
“It’s not… You’re… Cas, this stuff is dangerous,” she said carefully, still not looking at him. “And you’re—”
“I thought you said you were done?”
“You’re here,” he whispered, smiling and kissing Dean again. “I missed you, Dean. I
“Please,” Cas lamented.
“Yes,” he said breathlessly, “Yes, you can use your alpha voice. You can do whatever you want to me.”
“Relax, then, and just breathe. I’m gonna take your jeans off,” Dean said. Castiel nodded vehemently, letting out these little noises that went straight to Dean’s cock as Dean undid the button and zipper. Castiel raised his hips to allow Dean to pull his pants off his legs, and as Dean was busy with dropping them off the side of the bed, Castiel quickly pushed his boxers down too and threw over the side to join his jeans.
Dean was silent for a moment before he exhaled very quickly.
“Sure,” Gabe laughed. “But anyway, they don’t know that and it’s their job to find wealthy men. If it makes you feel any better, he doesn’t seem to be reacting to it. He seems like he’s ignoring them, Cas.” He shrugged.
Dean scoffed. “I don’t know
“Aye,” Dean responded, pushing all the pie in his mouth to one side and speaking out the other.
Castiel inched away from Dean. “What about Amara?”
“Yeah?”
“You’ve never had an alpha’s cock inside you before,” Dean said, grinding into Castiel until the omega was shaking. “You’re a virgin—or,
“Don’t let me go,” Cas whispered, on the brink of crying.
“If you want,” Cas said, a laugh in his voice. Dean rolled his eyes and smiled fondly as he stood up, making Cas gasp and dig his fingers into Dean’s shoulders. “God, I’m so sensitive!”
Dean and Cas never broke eye contact with each other as they moved. Even when Dean moved his hand up to cup Cas’s face, his thumb resting on Cas’s bottom lip and tugging it down to expose Cas’s teeth before he let go and kissed Cas hard. It took both of their breaths away faster than they thought it would and they had to pull away not long after their lips first touched.
“What’s the first thing you remember?” Cas asked, keeping his eyes on Dean’s.
?” Castiel asked slowly, his panic turning to anger. “No. You can’t.”
Castiel’s eyes widened at her boldness. He took an involuntary step back and grabbed Jess’s arm in an act of protection. Meg either didn’t notice, or didn’t care, because she stepped forward to stay close to him. She opened her mouth to keep talking, but Jess pushed her back and stepped in front of Castiel.
Cas shook his head. “No... I just... I like the voice you just used.”
“Lisa?” Dean questioned the lady once they were able to see her. She was sobbing to some of the swabs about how she needed to see Dean.
But after a while, Dean shifted and the movement shifted his fingers inside Cas and made him gasp.
“It is not like he could have arrived any sooner,” Jess said, “Changes were being made that kept us all too busy.”
And tried to push Dean’s mouth back onto his painfully hard cock. Dean sat up, moving back to connect his lips with Cas's as he blindly reached out for the oil. Cas gripped at Dean's hair and scratched at his scalp, whining unintelligible pleas into Dean's mouth while the man coated his fingers with the oil.
“Let’s go to your room,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand in his and pulling the man with him as he walked into the cabin’s hallway. “I have some things I want to say to you.”
Dean laughed, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh along, too.
“I was told—I mean, do you like, um, virgins?”
But Cas must’ve tightened his grip on Dean’s hand because the taller man leaned down just slightly, “It’s okay. We’re almost there.” He ran his thumb across Cas’s knuckles soothingly.
“Good,” Dean said, smiling as he closed his eye again. “How long have you been up?”
“That good, huh?” Dean asked, adding a third finger. Cas’s thighs trembled and he moaned brokenly.
Dean thanked them profusely, wiping at his eyes still as the tears just kept coming.
“That is so good to know,” Dean laughed as he stroked Cas’s back gently for a while before speaking again. “Do you want to go to sleep?”
that made Dean make that noise… Well…
Castiel’s twenty fifth birthday was his favorite. After months of dropping hints for Dean—so many that he was one more week away from doing it himself—Dean proposed to him. Castiel immediately said yes, of course, and that night began making preparations for their ceremony. Jess, Gilda, Charlie, Meg, and Alfie helped him get everything together, and three months later he was woken up at sunrise to get ready for his and Dean’s big day.
“Hm,” Dean hummed, smiling to himself. Cas wasn’t hard to work up. You just had to know which buttons to push, and Dean knew the
“Oh? And what’s that?”
“I—I want you to be my first,” Castiel said, his face heating up just enough to make the corners of Dean’s mouth twitch up. “I know it’s soon, but… I want you to be my first…if you want that too.”
Instead, he just made his way to the victor’s suite, and he let himself in, locking the door and checking several times that it was locked tight before he dragged himself to the master bedroom. Before he was even halfway there, though, he felt
“Father,” Cas started, “It’s five o'clock now, would you rather not stay here instead of going back to the house only to leave again?”
“Maybe I’ll tie you up while I’m at it. Make you watch yourself get fucked,” Dean leaned down to growl into Cas’s ear. “I know you’d love that: to see yourself completely under my control. Completely helpless under me with my dick pounding into you and my hand on your cock.” Cas let out a desperate noise, a cross between a cry and whimper. “I wouldn’t let you come, though. No matter how much you begged and pleaded for me to get you off, I wouldn’t let you. Not until I came first.”
“You are not!”
“That’s him,” Cas said, smiling shyly. He quickly picked up something from the table he and Gabe were standing next to — startling the vegetable stand owner — and held it up as if he were examining the item.
The next thing he knew he was searching through the minds of everyone he could find as far as he could reach out. He could feel his power thrumming and building inside him so he could stretch farther and farther, but Dean wasn’t anywhere to be found! It was like he’d vanished into thin air!
~  ~  ~
“Won’t you be sore tomorrow, though?”
His silence only seemed to egg Dean on, and before he could say anything about it, Dean’s tongue was pushing inside him, making him cry out and move his hand down to grip Dean’s hair tightly again. He felt every little movement of Dean’s tongue working inside him, pushing him closer and closer to that edge he loved. And then Dean added a finger and stroked that spot inside him that made him absolutely hum with pleasure. It only took a few strokes for Castiel to find his release, letting out a loud mewl as Dean pleasured him through it, adding a finger each time Castiel’s breathing began to slow. The sensations were almost too much for Castiel, and every a handful of pumps of Dean’s fingers, he was coming again and again and Dean only began to pull away when Castiel’s legs started shaking around his head. Before he removed his fingers from Castiel’s hole, he gave a few more pumps of his hand, stroking Castiel’s prostate each time before deciding he was slick enough and ready for him.
“Yes,” Cas replied, smirking as he fumbled around in the nightstand drawer for the bottle of oil. Dean trailed kissed down Cas’s back as Cas placed the bottle in his outstretched hand.
“Don’t these flowers go so well together?” One of the maidens asked.
“Please,” Cas heaved. Dean slid the head of his cock against Cas’s rim, “Please! Captain, please!”
Six months in, Castiel told Dean that he’d been physically and sexually assaulted when he was younger. Dean knew sometimes he had bad days, but they’d been together for three years and had a sex life more active than most couples, he would say. Castiel trusted Dean enough that Dean could initiate for sex whenever he felt the want. Castiel didn’t always say yes, but Dean had gone out of his way to make it so Castiel didn’t feel any pressure to say yes or any guilt for saying no.
“Yes, I suppose” Castiel said uneasily, “I do not know how to feel about him. He said many things, and I do not know how to respond to his proposal.”
“Really?” Castiel gasped, he was about to ask more about what new things people were allowed to do now, but Alfie spoke first.
Charlie leaned forward and began, “We understand that being an omega of servant status and working in the castle under a Winchester’s rule was... Indescribably terrifying. Starting with the first Winchester to rule, each new Winchester King grew more despicable than the last. John was...” Charlie looked down at her hands, “Awful. He... He hurt so many.”
“Bed,” Cas said breathlessly, doing his part by wrapping his legs around Dean's hips and his arms around the man’s shoulders. Dean picked him up and carried him over to the bed, laying down with Cas on top of him. The two stayed like that; not needing to say anything, just listening to the other’s breathing.
“Not at all,” Dean said, raising an eyebrow.
“I think you misunderstood me,” Cas said. “You’re not enough reason to make me stay… Gabe, no one is. If you and Dean’s places were switched and he was on this island while you were the one with the ship, my love for him couldn’t make me stay here either.”
“I always keep my promise,” Dean said, pulling Cas against him. The taller man grunted when Cas started to suck on his neck with no real pattern to where he put his lips. Dean ate it up, though. He made quiet, low noises that persuaded Cas to continue.
“You were supposed to be my pawn in changing
“Cas, run!” Benny choked out, and Castiel jumped into action. He looked around and decided his best option was to hide behind the bar.
“Dean,” Cas sighed, putting his palm on the man’s forearm as his hand disappeared into Cas’s trousers.
“Sure.”
In the corner of his vision, he could vaguely register everyone standing as he entered the chapel and started the long trek down the velvet aisle, but he didn’t see any of them. He could only look at the handsome, green-eyed alpha standing at the altar. The alpha who was waiting for him to stand by his side.
“A little,” Dean responded quietly. He rolled Cas on top of him and then maneuvered them until they were both under the covers.
Dean put their clothes into his hamper and then came back over, sliding his hands around Cas and holding him close. Cas could feel himself blush as his skin was pressed flush against Dean’s. Dean chuckled softly. “Are you embarrassed?” He asked, kissing Cas’s forehead.
“Do you even know what you’re talking about?” Castiel said.
“What?” Crowley yelled, pulling at his bindings. Sam pushed himself back up and walked over to the other four pirates. They conversed quietly for a few seconds and then broke apart.
“You can look up now,” Dean informed Cas, not letting go of his hand; not that Cas wanted him too. Dean was a comforting presence, and—maybe because the man took his virginity, maybe some other reason—Cas craved his touch.
“Where have you been?” Alfie asked, running his hands through Benny’s hair and resting their foreheads together. “Where have you been all these years?”
Castiel followed him, helping Dean to pick out everything they’d need, and all the while he thought about what he could write for the contest. His normal niche didn’t seem appealing to him, and he thought, maybe a new genre would get him out of his slump. It was a real make-or-break decision, and Castiel figured: why not try; because like Dean said, what did Castiel have to lose?
“Shut it, Jo, let’s get this over with,” Rachel said, and Jo scowled at her.
It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t have good memories of his childhood. It was that the good ones he did have didn’t include anyone but himself and the absolute worst memories all included his father, Zachariah, and his siblings. And now that Zachariah was dead, as bad as it sounded, Castiel wasn’t sad. He wasn’t happy or relieved, either, no, he really wasn’t. But he wasn’t…sad.
was going to happen. He didn’t know what exactly would be going down, but something was set into motion the moment Castiel picked that ball of fur up and brought her into their apartment.
“Oh!” Cas gasped, jerking his hips. “Dean, stop or I’m gonna come.” Dean pulled off with a pop and crawled up to kiss Cas.
“You never gave me an answer.”
“Let me go you bastards!” The man screamed, trying to shake the hands off his shoulders.
got them for him?”
Cas perked up at that announcement. King Crowley was not one to make decisions in a timely manner. He preferred to...well, abuse his power and push peoples limits. It took just over six months for the King to even accept Michael’s first appeal to meet years ago. Since then, Michael and Crowley’s relationship had mostly been Michael asking a simple question and then getting an answer months upon months later. It was ridiculous, if Cas said so himself. But right now, Cas couldn’t be more happy about that fact.
Cas hugged Dean tighter in return. Both to get closer to Dean and to hide his face because he knew he was just about to cry. He was tired and it made everything Dean was saying was so overwhelming. “But, squarely, love isn’t a strong enough word to describe how I feel about you.”
“Happy to do it,” Dean said, continuing with eating his own meal. Castiel pushed his plate away and slyly scooted closer to Dean. He planted his elbow on the table and put his chin in his palm.
“Of course,” Dean responded, giving her hand a squeeze. “Just give me a couple of minutes.”
“I’m so sorry, Cas, I’m so sorry,” Dean said, sprinting up the dock stairs to get to his boat. He took two at a time to get there faster. “Sam!”
“Ah! Dean, slow down, or—” Cas cut himself off with a harsh gasp, “I'm gonna come.” Dean only moved his head faster, reaching up to play with Cas’s nipples. “I’m… I’m… I-I’m coming!” Cas heaved, coming hard enough that he wasn’t able to do anything
— special. And that it was my duty to protect you.”
wasn’t coming with them. It took everything in Dean not to turn the ship around, then.
“They do. Granted, they are not the real thing and therefore does not make the heat go away. Despite that, they are a close second to the real thing,” Ellen said.
It wasn’t until the child first stepped his foot onto the uneven wood of the docks did Dean speed up his pace. The child was getting rather close to the edge of the walks and wasn’t looking where he was going.
A man, Cain, came to stand next to Victor. He nodded to Dean as a greeting.
The husband either had the driver stop at one of the taverns on the way back to get a few drinks, or he was lying about taking the carriage. However, the constable that helped him when he arrived at the police headquarters did say he smelled alcohol on the husband's breath. Meaning that inconsistency could be crossed off and the motive behind the husband lying about time of arrival and/or departure could be added.
Ben stirred and sat up, looking around before yawning and lying back down with his back against Dean’s chest and his hand clutching his mother’s fingers. Dean sighed and closed his eyes, loving the warmth he got from having Ben next to him.
“Oh, my gods!” His arms gave out as Dean fucked right into his prostate; the only thing holding him up was Dean. Cas gasped for breath as Dean continued to move his hips hard enough that Cas was sure he wouldn’t be able to sit right from the way Dean’s hips were slamming into him.
wanted to have sex with you. No other ‘nefarious’ reason.”
“I don’t understand the question,” Cas said cautiously. “I love him.”
Cas smiled at the man. “I admire that,” He said, “Thank you. I’m glad Dean has someone looking out for him.”
Castiel stared up at Dean as a million thoughts ran through his head too fast to decipher, or even process really.
Cas moaned, feeling the man’s tongue circle his sensitive rim, “I thought about you… Fucking me senseless; sometimes tied up, sometimes you held my legs open and told me not to move my arms. I thought about you putting that cock ring on me and then ordering me to ride you with my hands tied behind my back. Another time, it was the same fantasy, except you had me touching myself and I was begging to come, but you didn't let me — not until after you did.”
Castiel bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from saying it, but as soon as he opened his mouth to form a different response, it came pouring out.
“Cas,” Dean said, startling Castiel out of his thoughts. “I should go. Amara—” Castiel bristled at her name. “—will be wondering where I am. I’ve already been here past curfew.”
I just want you to fuck me stupid,” Cas pleaded, moaning as he felt Dean’s tongue flick against his neck.
“You know, I would swear to you that I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, but I would be lying because I know I’ll love you more tomorrow. Every day I fall deeper in love with you than the day before,” Dean said, hugging Cas even tighter. “I love you so much, Cas. I will until I die. And if there’s a life after that, I’ll love you then, too.”
“I need you two to stay in here, lock the door, and get cozy. There’s another ship coming our way,” He said, staying quiet so Ben wouldn’t hear him. “It’s probably nothing, but I want to be ready in case they decided to try their luck and attack. No matter what happens, do not unlock this door for anyone, okay? Not unless they say the code word.”
big!”
Cas let out a deep breath and wasn’t able to do anything but nod. Dean backed up and slid into his spot with a smirk. Now Cas was the one who looked flustered and out of it.
? This was the woman responsible for the beastie fights? Dean’s employer. Confusion set in as to what she was doing knocking at his trailer door. The general population wasn’t allowed down here, and especially not this soon after a fight.
Dean sighed, “You’re right. But I’m still pissed, Jo. She… She…”
you. You’re my true mate.”
“You should’ve told me about your father sooner,” Dean said.
“I’ll be hanged,” Dean said it like it was nothing.
“What?”
“Dean…” He said, eyes wide and glazing over with lust. “Now.”
“I love you,” he said, pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s lips.
Cas soaped up his hands and raked his eyes over Dean’s front as his hands left trails of soap where they went.
“As much as I don’t mind you being on top of me, the ground is actually quite cold and uncomfortable,” he said, and it took a moment for the words to process in Castiel’s brain before he realized what was happening and surged into action.
“Don’t leave,” Cas whispered, “I love you.”
“You doing alright?” Dean asked, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh because of course he was doing alright. He was doing better than alright.
“Just let me do do my thing,” Cas groaned in frustration and batted Dean’s hands away.
The carriage came to a stop and someone from outside yelled loudly.
“Of all the years on your ship, do you know how many people from our crew I’ve seen die?” Jo asked, looking at Dean’s face with a hard expression.
“It means a lot of things,” Gilda started. “Blue is associated with stability, and symbolizes trust, loyalty, and confidence. Green symbolizes growth and hope. Red indicates courage, love, and power. White is rare. Cas’s aura is almost completely white; it’s angelic and it means goodness and divinity.”
Even then, when Castiel was barely keeping upright on top of him, Dean didn’t stop. Instead, Dean gave up control to his own wolf and moved his hands up to Castiel’s hips, using his strength to push and pull Castiel so his cock rubbed the omega’s walls while his knot massaged that spot inside Castiel that made him see stars.
“I am,” Dean said quietly, his voice shaky. “I’m so sorry, baby.” Cas sobbed out a laugh, shaking his head as he pulled away and crushed his lips to Dean’s.
“I still feel icky,” he said, pausing to look through his tea. “I have chamomile, green, black, and peppermint.”
” Castiel could barely get a coherent thought to go through his head. “Why are you sorry? Why are you guilty? What did you do? Wh-why—what are you ashamed of?”
“Everything is annoying to you when you have to do something you don’t want to,” Cas said. Dean nodded, placing a quick kiss on Cas’s forehead before he sprang into action. He got off the bed, helping Cas up, too, before walking over to his dresser and pulling out clean clothes for himself and Cas.
“Cas, wait!” Lucifer’s hand clamped around his wrist and yanked him back and he glared angrily into sickly blue eyes. “Cas, look, I’m just worried about you. I don’t want you to get taken advantage of.”
“Color?”
“What are you going to do if I don’t?” She asked rhetorically. “You have no power over me.”
She smiled back at him. “Of course.”
“I don’t think you do,” Cas said, slowing as they came to turn onto the pathway leading to Novak Manor. He walked up to the door, hesitating before opening it. “What do you get?”
“But I’m cold and you’re warm,” Cas protested. Dean batted his hands away and stood up, pulling the articles of clothing with him to rest on Cas’s hips.
“Sweetie,” Dean laughed, walking over to her as she stood. “You’re about to find out just how wrong you are.” In a sudden movement he raised his leg and kicked her straight in the chest, sending her flying backward again as Dean turned and walked swiftly back to his ship. “
Castiel looked at the food longingly. In truth, he was famished. He’d never had a heat before, but he’d been around when Alfie and the other servants had gone through them and they always needed extra food.
“Okay,” Benny nodded, he didn’t put away the supplies though.
“What’s your favorite part of foreplay?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Dean,” Gilda interrupted, sighing tiredly. She pulled a blanket up to cover the man and whispered something to him before moving away. She came over to a small station next to Dean and began packing up a bag. “We’ll be coming with you.”
“I have a small vessel I keep docked at an island two weeks south of here,” he said. “As long as you take good care of it, I’d be happy to let you use it for as long as you need.”
“You’re right again.” Dean sighed and ran his hands over his face. Jo came over and took his hand in hers, staying quiet and looking out over the water.
“Yes,” Dean whispered, dragging his thumb across one of Cas’s nipples, “Cas? Do you need something?”
“Yes,” Cas gasped, moaning loudly as Dean bottomed out. He closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip at the pleasure that coursed through him at being so full again. The stretch Dean made him feel, the feeling that he would never be completely ready for but he didn’t want it any other way.
Cas woke up the next morning to the feel of Dean behind him and their hands laced together. He decided it was his favorite way to wake up and the perfect way to start this day.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, and took a bite of his own sandwich as they walked. He was surprised how good the sandwich really was, but he also thought maybe it was partly how hungry he was. When he’d finished his bite, he continued, “And thank you, again, for last night. I don’t, um, I don’t have a lot of friends and as you know, I have a complicated relationship with my family.”
“It’s okay,” Dean said and smiled. “Teamwork, right?”
Cas smiled. “Scoot back,” he said. Dean did as he was told, watching Cas sink to his knees and pull at the knot of Dean’s pants, letting out a frustrated groan when he wasn’t able to undo them and had to sit back to let Dean work the knot out.
so much
“Thank you,” Dean said, both to Jo and Gilda. Jo nodded her response, and Gilda slung a bag over her shoulder, tossing one to Jo as well.
“Lisa, it’s okay, really,” Dean said, putting his hand on her back. “You two can stay in here, if you want. I’m just doing some work. I don’t mind.”
“Six inches?” Dean asked incredulously, and Castiel quickly shook his head.
“Have you heard of the old story about the Novaks being descended from Angels?” She asked.
“I know what he did,” Cas interrupted. “What did
“No, we need to talk now,” Rachel said. “What the fuck happened yesterday, huh?”
“You wouldn’t have fucked me. Even though I was
“Because you’re an alpha!”
“My dad’s leaving for a business trip the night before and won’t be back for a few days. He’s been talking about it non-stop. He’s going to meet with the Crowley family from the Royal Kingdom about a new proposal to make Heaven an extension in their kingdom. He’s trying to offer them a priceless heirloom we’ve kept in the family for generations to make up for me missing the previous meeting and
“And I’m not blonde,” he snorted. “C’mon, tell me what’s wrong. You can trust me.”
“What are you doing piloting? You’re an omega—you’re just a breeder. That’s all you omega’s are good for,” Alastair growled, “taking a knot.”
father... Sold
Castiel stretched his wings up behind himself, not caring of the damage he caused as he pushed off and soared. Wind rushed past him and the world around him changed at a blinding pace.
“Cas… I…” Dean shook his head, trying to get himself to move forward to embrace Cas, but he was rooted in his spot, unable to do anything but stare at his lover adorned in just a robe that was borderline transparent.
Cas speedily shoved enough clothes into his bag to last him a week, throwing in another two outfits; just in case. Afterwards, he raced down to the carriage. Or rather, carriage
!” Dean screamed and sat straight up in bed, clutching the sheets, sweating, and breathing hard. “
“Because you’re not like all the other alphas in the world!” Castiel shouted, unable to look at Dean for a moment.
Charlie looked at him with a frown, “C’mon, I’ll fix you up.” She said.
Dean walked slowly inside, a deep, thoughtful look on his face. He took a seat on the edge of one of the couches in the living room, and looked at his feet. Castiel closed the door quietly. He didn’t want to jolt Dean from whatever thought he was having because it seemed important. Castiel could tell.
“You’re human,” Cas said. “You’re a human somewhere between good and bad. I happen to think you’re more good than bad. You’ve helped and saved so many people, Dean.”
“It’s okay, baby, just keep going slowly, you’re almost there.”
to be in here.”
“She’s gone,” Rachel said. Castiel felt all these emotions surge through him, and the only thing he wanted right now was to be with Dean so he could process it all.
Even still, Cas held onto that tiny sliver of hope, despite the fact it was dying fast. Part of him thought he’d never really completely lose it, rather once—if? hopefully—he was married to Meg, it would become just a pang of pain he felt every now and then. If he even was around long enough to feel it. Meg and Crowley barely kept the first one around long enough for him to settle into life in Hell before he had his accident. How long would they keep him around once they found out he couldn’t be excited by Meg? Cas couldn’t imagine long. They were both impatient people.
Dean stepped forward, looking like he was about to walk over to Castiel and Castiel’s fight-or-flight response kicked in.
planned for you tonight.” He hummed, “That is… If you’re interested.”
“Because I thought you knew we were already dating! For two years!” Dean threw his hands up. “And none of you even responded! I brought y’all fucking homemade cupcakes and caramels when I got back! Why do you think I did that?”
“I-I’m not—”
“So in two years we’ll be married in the eyes of the law?” Dean asked, a smile forming on his face as he wrapped his arms around Castiel. Castiel smiled back, sliding his hands up Dean’s arms and into his hair.
“You just had an orgasm, basically,” Dean explained, “But you didn’t ejaculate.”
“I think you just don’t have any friends to invite over,” Castiel said under his breath.
Dean sighed and closed his eyes, “Thank you.”
Michael came over to him and yanked him up by his hair. “Don’t ever let this happen again, Castiel. Do you hear me? You missed the most important meeting of your life.This arrangement could have changed everything for Heaven and for
Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s, just wanting to feel the angel that he got to call
Cas whispered, looking into Dean’s eyes as the man lowered them onto their bed, “Gods, I missed you so much.” He smiled for a second before frowning as his eyes traced the cut long Dean’s face. “What happened?” He asked, lightly running his finger over the red line. Gilda had obviously had to stitch up the cut where it ran over his cheek, bridge of his nose, and through his eyebrow. Cas closed his eyes, concentrating as he ran his fingers over the cut. When he opened his eyes, he smiled warmly.
“How can you be sure?” Cas said. “Emotions are fickle and they can change in a day. You could wake up tomorrow and I could say something and then, bam, you hate me. Or two years from now we could start drifting apart and then one day… Bam,” Cas looked away, his eyes welling up with yet even more tears. “You don’t love me anymore and all those quirks that you used to love about me you now hate them and they drive you insane. How can you be so sure that you’re not going to stop loving me?” Dean didn’t even hesitate to respond.
Just a quick little note: this chapter may read like the characters are acting out of character, but just hang in there. It’ll be explained.
“Please, you have to help me — I’ll do anything! You don’t know what the orphanages are like.”
Castiel frowned again, but nodded and looked up at Dean to meet his eyes.
“No, no, no!” Cas slapped his hands over his ears. “Hush! I don’t want to hear about your sex life!”
|~~~|
Dean let himself drift into having less than pure thoughts about Cas. About all the ways he could make Cas come undone, the noise Cas made just after he bottomed out inside him, and about how beautiful Cas always looked after sex.
“Did you come without me knowing?” He lifted his eyes back up to see Cas shake his head as he sucked his fingers into his mouth. If Dean hadn’t come before this, he was sure he would have come just from that sight.
“I’ll find him some other time,” she said,  walking away quickly. She called over her shoulder, “Don’t come back until curfew, Dean. I need time away from you.”
“Forever?”
Dean gave him a smile in response and then nodded to something across the street. Castiel looked up and was slightly disappointed to see that they’d arrived at his campus and it was time for class.
This chapter may get kinda ugly towards the end. Just a warning.
“I have,” Meg said. She looked over to Cas, quirking an eyebrow up. “It’s the flag of Dean
“You’re getting closer.”
more before Castiel was ready for him.
“Oh,” Castiel said, defeated. He looked down to his tray of food and frowned. “I think I am done eating.”
Castiel giggled and pulled Dean into another kiss that was more smiles, teeth, and tongue than a true kiss. Dean wasn’t complaining in the least, though, because if Castiel wanted it, he would gladly give it.
“Aye,” Dean nodded, “But there was something that told me that you were special. I mean,
“What do you not understand? The world is going to die.”
“How are you feeling about going back soon?” Dean asked, kissing the top of Castiel’s head.
“Yes!”
“I brought some.”
-husband,” Rachel said, “Inias won’t let me speak to my daughter.”
don’t get to speak
“And it’s doubly okay because I’ve had Kevin write a letter up to your father from ‘Crowley’ asking him to come back right away to discuss some legalities.”
“I’m just heading home now,” Castiel said.
“He’s right,” Lisa murmured, scouting the crowds to see where Dean was with Ben. “They take this holiday the most serious out of all of them.”
“What happened?” Dean asked, worry evident in his voice. “Was it Michael?”
pleasure… But he knew what he was doing to me. And I didn’t want to, Cas, you have to believe me; I didn’t want to enjoy it — I tried to hard to get him to stop
“Perhaps you should get some rest, huh?”
Castiel looked around, noting the bullet holes in the parlor and the stuffing from the couch scattered everywhere. He slowly walked into the room, looking around for any sign of anyone when he heard footsteps to his right.
“Good?” Dean asked.
“Color?” He asked, nibbling on Cas’s ear lobe.
“Thank you, Benny,” Cas mumbled shyly and blushed, walking over to Dean and leaning into his side.
“None of us are leaving!” Someone yelled, drawing everyone’s attention to him. Dean recognized him at Victor. Victor Henriksen, one of Dean’s oldest and most loyal mates. He’d been with Dean almost since the beginning. “We’re not abandoning.”
“Yeah,” Gilda laughed. “I love Charlie and she loves me, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a little fun with someone else from time to time.”
Dean chuckled. “My employer is the owner of a lot of the arenas around here and she comes to fights to...monitor, I guess. B-but she also gambles on beasties. And I go where she goes.”
“I’m Cas, it’s nice to meet you, too," he said. Charlie and Cas shared a moment of eye contact, making Cas’s shoulders relax and his grip on Dean’s hand loosen.
Dean watched his mouth intently before tensing. “
“Not now,” Dean said, experimentally dragging his nail gently over Cas’s rim to see what noise he could pull from Cas.
“I mean it, Cas,” Dean said. Cas opened his eyes and looked up into Dean’s.
“Dean,” Sam coughed, “He’s the son of Michael Novak.”
“Don’t answer her,” Castiel whispered. Dean swayed forward and nodded. “We’re going to be okay.”
Cas shook his head, “No, father.” He heard his father grab one of the fire pokers and come to stand behind his son.
“You called me baby,” Castiel said.
“Those weren't birthdays,” Cas whispered, gripping Dean’s arm tighter; as if he was plagued by the awful memories of Dean’s past instead of Dean. “Here… You’re surrounded by the people who love you.”
“You better,” Cas laughed, looking back down at his book as Dean went back to the paperwork for his Demon Deals. Dean was able to get some work done before Cas got bored again. The kid started shuffling around on the bed and making suggestive sounds that had Dean almost snapping his pen in half.
King Dean
“Excuse me?” Dean seethed. Castiel could see his mate’s eyes turning a deep shade of red and he stood up quickly, his chair scraping against the floor and drawing the attention of everyone in the room. He gave Dean a look that told him he had this handled, and then addressed the rest of the room.
When Castiel finally started relaxing down, Dean slowly lowered him back to the bed. Castiel’s chest heaved and he let out these harsh, stuttering breaths that made Dean’s chest swell with pure pride.
“Hey, listen, let’s make a rule that you don’t have to apologize for things you shouldn’t be sorry for. Especially when you’re around me, because look, from my perspective you’re awesome and everything you do is awesome, so I don’t think you have to be sorry for just being you. Because you’re…” Dean paused and took long enough that Castiel had to take a peek to see what he was doing. Castiel’s heart thudded to stop when he caught Dean’s eye and he felt like electricity was running through his body. “You’re
you.”
“What else do we need?” Castiel asked, looking back over his shoulder at his cousin, Gabe, who quickly pulled up the list on his phone.
“I’m sorry, I just wanted to meet you,” Dean said, “You’re amazing and I have a brother who—”
“Boy, you really got a spook,” She said. Castiel nodded and Ellen gave him a soothing smile, “There is no reason to be frightened, not anymore,” she said, “No alpha will be coming in here until your heat is over and you have had time to recuperate.”
Amara’s smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. “Well, I wanted to discuss a deal with you.”
“Mh-hm,” Dean hummed, already starting to doze off. Cas lifted his head to look at him and smiled softly.
“Calm down, Cas, I’m going as fast as I can,” Dean chuckled under his breath, oiling up his manhood as quick as he could and pressing the head of his cock against Cas’s rim. “You ready?”
“I’m so proud of you, Cas,” he said. Castiel felt tears prick at the corner of his eyes, but before they could begin to fall, Ellen ushered Alfie and Benny to the doors for their cue.
“I can ask Bobby if he would be willing to take over a few of my duties,” Dean said, “Or I can carve out at least one night a week for a dinner like this with you? Perchance—”
Dean nodded. “That’s cool.”
“Th-that’s not—that’s not true—”
Castiel’s thoughts were cut short as Dean’s mouth enveloped his member. All the air was pushed out of his lungs in a single soft moan, and his hands shot down to thread into Dean’s hair.
, had begun construction on hundreds of arenas around the world. He left everything to Amara when he passed.
“How long will it take for that to dissolve?” Sam asked.
“I don’t know if Dean has told you about him and I…” Benny started, obviously not sure how to approach this subject. Benny opened his mouth to continue, but Cas cut him off.
Dean’s arms wrapped around Cas, almost holding him too tight. “Of course.”
“Dean, you need to go. I can’t have you stressing Cas out right now,” Gilda said, looking at him pleadingly.
Amara’s smile fell off her face and her lips pressed into a thin line. “Throw the next fight you’re in,” she said. Castiel took a moment to process that, looking at Gadreel to make sure he’d heard right.
“I have work that I need to get done,” Dean said, “Important work.”
“As you wish, angel,” Dean whispered, making quick work of shedding his shirts and trousers.
“So,” Dean said immediately, not missing a beat. His eyes were glued onto the knife in Ava’s hand. His features hardened as he saw blood stain Cas’s coat. “What is it you that you wanted?”
Usually they didn’t meddle in the affairs of other kingdoms, but there had been a huge migration of predominantly omegas and children from this particular kingdom to theirs in the past month. It had left the economy in Purgatory vulnerable and the royal family wanted to discuss having Winchester send their people back to their homeland.
“Of course, Cas,” Dean whispered. “I’m so sorry I didn’t notice this sooner, though.”
When Castiel was thirteen and he walked into the ale cellar and saw King John redressing himself as one of the omegas from the kitchen cowered in the corner, dress ripped and bloody in certain places he didn’t care to think about after that night, dark bruises on her neck, chest, and face, Alfie was there to listen to Castiel tell him what happened…
“You want me to…?”
“Mh,” the younger man moaned. “I like it when you do that.”
Charlie let out a breath of air. “It is of no matter anymore. John cannot hurt anyone again, not where is he now. He got what he deserved.”
“You do not have a choice either,” he said. Alfie opened his mouth to protest, but Castiel stopped him with a hand on his arm. He pulled Alfie into a hug, and whispered into his ear that he would be alright. After that, the guards ushered him out of his chambers and up the stairs to the kitchen.
“No,” Cas whimpered. “Want you to come.”
Castiel laughed, but nodded his head. He gave Ellen one last
“What the-?” Gabe gaped, looking around. “Damn, your ship really is massive.”
“I can’t — ah! — lose you,” Cas cried. Dean quickened his hips and looked into Cas’s eyes.
“Oh, well, how
“Heats are not to be taken lightly,” Ellen said, “Alas, still no dessert until he has eaten enough food to get him through the spikes of his heat that are to come.”
“Eh, I’m tired now,” Dean said. Cas could tell he wasn’t actually tired. His voice was awake and alert, but he wasn’t going to try and convince Dean to leave. Instead, he was going to be a bit selfish and keep Dean for himself.
“Your Majesty.” He nodded to Crowley. “Your Royal Highness.” A nod to Meg. “Father.” He gave a final nod to Michael and stood up. “Pardon me, but I’m exhausted. I’m going to take my leave and turn in for the night. Thank you for the lovely dinner and excellent wine. It was all very delicious,” Cas said, turning to nod at Alfie in a silent asking for him to follow. He got a quick, almost imperceptible, nod in return.
“I… I am.” Dean looked at the ground, his entire posture crumpling in on himself. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, and the next thing Castiel knew, his nose filled with the scent of shame and guilt.
the word echoed in Cas’s mind. “In that particular area.”
you’ve come into Dean’s life.”
Still. One could never be too sure. God knew Dean had some underage omega’s try way too hard to get into his bed before when he was younger, despite his deliberate and calculated attempts to reject them.
Cas had to silence a groan that was threatening to spill out. “Actually, I already have plans.”
“It’s fine.”
“Absolutely not,” Dean said, a tone of finality in his words. “Cas, there’s you. And there’s me. And then there’s you and me. I don’t want you and me to overshadow
“I guess I can’t argue with that logic,” he said, “Sorry to offend, but I’m not stupid, I know I’m attractive—dare I say charming or enchanting, even—” Castiel laughed under his breath. “—and I know the effect I have on omegas. Unfortunately, that effect can attract some underage omegas.”

Dean nodded. “He’s coming only out of retirement for one fight. Against you.”
“So that was a bribe? The cupcakes and caramels?” Cole asked and Dean rolled his eyes.
it. I thought y’all were mad at me.”
is so
“I love you,” Dean said, kissing Cas again. He stopped as soon as felt himself starting to harden, because it was too soon to jump right back into being together. “Okay, we, uh, need to stop,” Dean said, sitting back up so he could move off the bed, but Cas snapped his arm out and grabbed Dean’s wrist.
The Angel’s Academy. That was the school his siblings attended while he schooled himself. They were taught how to harness their powers and sent on crime fighting missions while he was told he couldn’t go with the others because there was just nothing special about him.
“Put up the sails,” Dean responded. “Red and white.”
“Oh… No. That would be torture.” Cas shook his head a little. His breath caught when Dean teethed at his pulse point before speaking.
Castiel froze for a moment.
“Well, you never said, was it a good birthday?”
Dean’s eyes grew wet again.
love pie,” he finished, just as he heard Jack begin his round of grunts and gurgles that signaled he was waking up. “Well, Mr. Sleepyhead is waking up now.”
“Dean—”
The loud bang was deafening and left him feeling a little dizzy, but what he was really focused on was the fact that the color drained from Amara’s face and she was looking down at him in shock.
, looking for you,
Cas yawned and shook his head. “‘M fine. You go back to the mess. Come to bed when you’re tired.”
Cas rolled his eyes before bucking his hips into Dean.
“Dean, please, I’m ready,” Cas begged, scratching at the wall desperately.
talents do I get? You get to be really good at pleasing me, but what do I get?”
Castiel turned away from Dean and squared his shoulders. Dean could practically see the look of calm but murderous rage in his eyes already, and he sighed in defeat.
“Oh, you poor thing,” Dean laughed, “Your life must be so hard.” Cas smiled, kissing Dean’s neck.
“Go to sleep,” Dean whispered, wrapping his arms around Castiel, and holding him close.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you say?” he asked.
“Merry Meet,” He said, and everyone took their seat again. Dean waited again until everyone was comfortable before continuing, “It is a pleasure to have you here today, your Majesty, King Alastair.”
“Okay,” Dean whispered, looking into Cas’s eyes.
Dean smiled, squeezing Cas’s hand, “I’ll won’t let you go for as long as you want,” he said, “Don’t you ever let me go.”
“I think he’s perfect,” Dean said, using the edge of his sleeve to wipe away some of the drool on Cas’s cheek. “I couldn’t bring myself to care if he was half troll. I love him.”
“Well, then he couldn’t have had someone send a message to me or something?” Cas asked. “He couldn’t have had Kevin or Ash o-or Chuck or
Dean broke out in a grin, “Okay.” He put his hands on Cas’s hips and rubbed circles with his thumbs into the skin there.
Next, he’d set about hiring alpha, betas, and even omegas to help with construction of housing all around the kingdom for omegas and children who had nowhere else to go. At the same time, he had heavily fortified and guarded, safe lodgings built for omegas to go when in heat if they had no mate. These inns and hostels were scattered throughout the kingdom, Ellen had explained, from the smallest village on the very edge of Winchester land, to the biggest city right outside the castle walls.
Cas whimpered, “Please.”
But mostly, Castiel was thankful; because she was the one who’d let Dean out. She was the one who’d saved everyone when Castiel had lost control. Ellen was the only person who understood how Castiel felt about Dean. Castiel could feel the love she had for him and his siblings, and Castiel could tell if the situation were reversed, if her children were in danger she would do whatever she could to save them. Just like Castiel would do anything to save Dean.
“Yeah, that sounds good. It’s off of 115th street. I’ll text you the exact address, so you know where to go,” Dean said.
“Really?” Dean asked, opening his eyes to look at Cas. He found himself smiling a little at Cas’s confession. If Cas didn’t want to leave because of him… That was… Great.
“No,” she said, “he has not. You are not of age and therefore he cannot court you.”
“Yes,” Cas said, bucking his hips into Dean’s. Dean got the message and sat up on his heels. He took his member in his hand and caught Cas’s eyes as he lowered his hips to Cas’s to grip the smaller man’s cock in the same hand.
Dean coughed out a laugh. “Okay there,” he said, his voice coming out quiet. Closing his eyes, he concentrated on catching his breath. A smile tugged at the corner of his lips. “You don’t need to be cocky about this.”
Dean paused his movements, drawing a wanton cry of denial from Cas. “Okay,” he said and pulled his fingers out of Cas’s hole.
was even more damaging.
“I can say I was at the library,” Cas said, as they approached the Ports Quad. “It’s happened before.” Cas heard Dean chuckle and he smiled to himself.
“You made me wake up when I was almost asleep,” Cas said, yawning.
. He hadn’t realized that’s where he’d been walking until he was stopped in front of the store.
“You’ll have to wait,” Dean said. He gave Cas a peck and spoke into Cas’s hair. “I want it to be a surprise.”
Cas's voice cracked and filled with tears as he said, “You’re
inches.”
“I’ll stay here,” Sam called after them. Dean smiled back at his brother and gave him a nod. He was glad Sam was staying.
“Do you like it?” Charlie asked hopefully.
Cas pulled at the rope around his wrists and went silent for a second before he spasmed forward violently. Dean watched Cas’s face as he came a second later with a violent thrust of Dean’s hips into his prostate. The look of
Now, Castiel was used to being harassed. He was a male omega in a world where male omega’s were so rare they were seen as a delicacy by alpha’s and nothing more. Hell, Castiel wasn’t even a newcomer to rape. His own brother and father had both stolen his virginity during his first ever heat in his eleventh birthday, and from then on out during his heats they had found him just too tempting to resist sometimes.
“Anything and everything,” Dean responded. “What about you? What made you want to see me again?”
“You can’t promise that, Dean.” Cas turned his head away, feeling more tears spill out of his eyes. “You don’t know what the future holds.”
“What do you mean, I—”
Castiel smiled to himself and shrugged. “I know that Dean will never not be there for me, and I never want to not be there for him, either.”
Dean felt himself smile.
“He was scared I wouldn’t be able to control my emotions?” Castiel asked. Before his anger could rise, he felt Dean squeeze his hand. And for the millionth time Castiel couldn’t help but thank whatever was out there that Dean Winchester was part of his life. “I don’t understand why he couldn’t have helped me. I was a kid. I was supposed to throw tantrums. He should have
Cas felt Dean grab his hand, holding onto him tightly and keeping him close to his sturdy frame. “Where can we go?” Dean asked, leading his team off the ship and onto the docks. “Keep your head down.”
“Tell me about it,” Dean asked softly, expertly uncapping the oil and dipping his fingers in before he brought his hand back to Cas’s entrance.
“Really?” Dean asked, looking up and meeting Cas’s eyes. Cas nodded.
“I’m sorry, he just…” Dean sighed.
at all like the rumors.
“F-foreplay?”
Castiel paused at that. The way she’d said it irked him; like the idea of them being family was some profound connection that couldn’t be severed. Like it meant more than his bond with Dean just because they were family.
“Stop,” Dean said quietly, “Cas, Stop. You’re shaking. I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m sorry.”
“Shit Cas,” Dean groaned, tilting his head up to kiss Cas desperately. Cas kissed back for a brief moment before he had to pull away to breathe. Dean kissed down to Cas’s neck, sucking bruises over his skin.
“You don’t have to apologize,” Cas responded, squeezing Dean’s hands.
Castiel smiled at the corny joke. “It’s hardly been even twelve hours,” he said, and Dean made a soft noise on the other side of the phone.
Dean jumped down from his spot, landing with a thud a few feet in front of the damned man. “P.T. Sandover?” Dean asked, stepping up to kneel in front of the man. He pulled the sack off his head and smiled menacingly. “Welcome, my name is Dean Winchester.”
Dean’s face fell as Castiel trailed off. He reached out to take Castiel’s hand and laced their fingers together. “Cas, I don’t know what to say…” he paused to squeeze Castiel’s hand. “Thank you for trusting me with this. I know this isn’t easy for you to share—”
Please! I don’t want this!
Chapter Two
“Please?!” Cas shouted, futilely trying to push his hips back to take the man’s cock inside him.
Dean sighed,
“Jo still didn’t have to punch me.”
“And that’s...bad?”
The feeling of being incomplete was horrible. It distracted him from what he was supposed to be doing with Amara and got him in trouble. And, well, it wasn’t like Dean really cared if he got in trouble, but he wasn’t fond of the cuts and marks she left when she got mad at him. Furthermore, Dean definitely wasn’t a fan of the worried scent Castiel gave off when he saw the wounds. He hated it when he worried his omega.
Cas could feel more tears slip out of his eyes. “I have to.”
“Understandable.” Gabe stepped back to let Cas into the carriage first. They sat next across from each other and were about to speak more, but Michael entered the carriage. He looked at Gabe with disdain and made a point of sitting next to Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean swept his hand out, “The whole ship actually used to be about ten times smaller than when I bought it. My cabin was just a small cot and a chair at first, but Sam and I expanded it. Plus with all the money we make from contracts, we don’t need to worry about shortages of anything. Plus the occasional pillage—”
“You okay?” He asked. Dean nodded his head minutely, shifting his posture before looking up at Castiel and searching his face seriously. Castiel felt his face grow warm from the intensity and looked away. “You’re acting odd tonight.”
After reinforcements had come and Lucifer wasn’t able to give Abbadon any information, beating Abbadon was more about simply getting through her soldiers than using strategy. And that had been easy. Some Abbadon loyalists, upon seeing that Dean had reinforcements, fled. They would be hunted down later, but everyone now was just glad for the upper hand again.
“I missed you,” he said. Cas closed his eyes, hugging Dean tightly and inhaling his scent.
“Are you okay?” Cas asked. Dean dug his fingers into Cas’s ribs lightly as he inhaled shakily. “Dean, look at me, please?” Cas canted his hips up a little to get Dean’s attention.
Castiel looked up at Dean as he lead them back towards where they’d left Alfie and the guards. “Were you really that vocal about having a true mate?” He asked. Dean glanced down at him, a light blush staining his cheeks.
“What about tonight? It will be the night Dean and you mate for the first time,” Meg said, “Not to sound vulgar,” she added quickly. Castiel shrugged again.
“Prostitutes?” Gabe supplied. “Paramours?”
He snapped his hips forward, smirking as Castiel writhed in pleasure. He set a pace that had Castiel mewling and crying out to Dean,
“Tell me what you were thinking about while you were touching yourself.”
Dean swallowed his laugh. “I can make
“So,” He started, “About Dean...”
Castiel wrung his hands together for a moment, and Dean was about to take pity on him and say it himself, but Dean apparently didn’t give Castiel enough credit.
Lisa shot her eyes between Dean and Jo, scrunching her eyebrows together. “Thank you.” She said, walking over to gingerly sit down on the edge of Dean’s bed.
Castiel’s eyes snapped open and he stared into bright green orbs.
Castiel’s eyes rolled up into his head at the thought of Dean moving. Of Dean pulling out all the way and pushing back into him, because he knew,
“Yeah?”
“How did you kill her?” Cas asked, setting his book down and rolling onto his stomach to look at Dean.
Dean looked over Castiel’s ID, and it had all the right information. Birthday was today, September eighteenth, eighteen years ago. Right name, and he looked to be roughly the same height and weight, right address... Everything checked out.
“You kept me on edge for an hour!”
“Cas, your libido is fucking insane,” Dean said, . “You know this. Everyone knows this. We leave every party or whatever early so we can have sex.”
“Dean!” Cas lifted his head and caught Dean’s lips with his own, pushing his tongue into the man’s mouth. Dean met Cas’s tongue with his own and massaged it until he needed air.
Castiel looked over to Sam, and shook his head.
“I don’t care,” Cas gasped, trying to push his hips into Dean’s. “I just want your cock inside me.”
Amara was quick to react to that and straddled his middle, raining down hits and scratches wherever she could. After another hit below his eye, Castiel yelled and shoved Amara off of him. He rolled over to get on top of her, but she jumped up, kicked his side and knocked the air out of his lungs.
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean said, “I’m sorry.”
overwhelming, and Castiel didn’t know how to cope. The only thing that helped even a little bit were the voices he heard around him.
“No!” Castiel almost shouted, “No, I don’t want you to wear one. Dean, please, I just want you.”
“Well, I’m here now,” Dean answered, smiling as Ben nodded and rested his small head in Dean’s neck. “I’ll protect you.”
Castiel ripped some more bread from his loaf and chewed it slowly, savoring the delicious taste. He’d had bread before, of course, but it had always been the burnt and undercooked loafs; the ones unsuitable to give to King Dean and his court.
“O-okay,” His voice came out in a whisper, only a little bit breathless. Cas realized then that he liked when Dean used that voice; the dominant and commanding one.
“You’re right,” Dean said, nodding.
“Oh, um, well, I guess I’ll leave you to get home safe, then,” Dean said, and Castiel felt this swirl of unpleasantness in his stomach. “It was nice meeting you, Cas… I… I had a nice walk and talk with you.”
“Those are—”
The butterflies wilted and fell into the pit where Castiel’s stomach used to be, because he knew that voice.
“Hmm,” Dean murmured. “Okay.” He immediately dived down and took one of Cas’s nipples into his mouth, sucking gently and flicking his tongue across the little nub.
As Dean walked back to him and Gilda, Castiel realized that for as much as Dean doesn’t know him? he really doesn’t know Dean as well as he thought, either.
“I’ll see you at home,” he said, giving Castiel another quick peck to his cheek. Dean waved bye as his family started walking out, smiling happily at the scene before him. And then he remembered why Castiel had gone to the doctors. “Wait! How did the appointment go? Is everything…” Dean flicked his eyes down to Castiel’s stomach. “Good? Everything okay?”
“You’re right,” he said, nodding. The pit in his stomach started to lessen as he saw Lisa finally come over and take Ben from Dean’s arms, pretending to be put out at their antics but smiling as she walked towards the sleeping quarters. She gave Benny and Cas warm smiles as she approached and then said a quiet
“Only slightly,” Dean mumbled, moving his finger away and flicking his tongue out against the reddened bump. “You’re higher pitched and it’s both one of the cutest things ever and one of the hottest things ever.”
Winchester of the Impala 67.
Castiel approached slowly, the cheering from the crowds going ignored as he looked in Abomination's eyes. The rage and hatred from before was replaced with defeat and Castiel knew what Lucifer was thinking now. It would’ve been the same, had Arkangel been in Abomination’s place. He would have accepted Arkangel’s fate just as Lucifer accepted Abomination’s.
Unfortunately for that kingdom, Dean, Castiel, and several other trusted Winchester officials had met with every single woman, man, and child to figure why they came to Winchester, and where they would fit in best, and each and every person had a story heavy with abuse and maltreatment of omegas and children from the alphas in their home kingdom.
Castiel set the kitten down when it began to squirm and he smiled as it darted into their living room.
But…he was an alpha. And sooner or later, Dean was bound to show his true colors.
Cas started to worry. He started to think that Dean wasn’t telling him something, and it scared him. His mind would wander during the day and go to the illogical extremes.
“I guess not this time, omega,” Dean said, nipping at Castiel’s mating gland. “It may push you past your limits.”
“Just about anything?” Cas asked. He stretched his arms up and hooked his legs over Dean’s shoulders. “What wouldn’t you want to see me in?”
“Cas,” Dean tsked him. “Where did your manners go?”
—not a good idea to knot you again.”
When he was done, Dean kissed Cas, slow and tender before pulling out of him and rolling off to lay beside Cas; reveling in the post orgasmic bliss and catching his breath before talking.
Castiel heard the soft noises of people sitting down, and it all really hit him then. He was getting married to his true mate, his best friend, the only man and alpha he would ever love. That knowledge calmed his racing heart, and gave him such peace.
“I have class Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from noon until six. And sometimes I go to a lecture on Tuesdays at one, but other than that feel free to call any other time,” Castiel said, and now it was Dean’s turn to nod.
“In-inside,” Cas gasped, shivering as Dean’s breath tickled his neck. “Inside me.”
Dean couldn’t wait to feel that around his cock.
~  ~  ~
“Do you like them?” Cas asked, his voice catching just slightly as Dean dropped him on the edge of their bed. Dean smiled before slowly pushing Cas’s shirt up his torso and then getting rid of it all together.
Dean moaned quietly, running a hand through his hair and moving his other hand faster over his manhood. He thought of the time he’d made Cas come four times back to back just by whispering dirty things into his ear and massaging his fingers against Cas’s prostate. That boy was honest to Gods the single most sensitive person he’d ever met. It was unreal how sensitive Cas was. Dean knew a lot about sex. He knew where humans held pleasure spots and how responsive each spot could be, but Cas was showing him new extremes. And Dean
It started storming three days before Dean had to leave again, and it hadn't let up since. Cas had been worried about the crew going out on the water in the weather. He’d heard of horror stories of ships capsizing and whole crew’s dying. He didn’t want that to happen to anyone on the Impala.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas moaned. He rocked his hips faster still and laughed at how Dean had to reach out to stop them from moving back any farther.
“So not an every time thing, then,” Dean suggested, pulling Cas closer into his body.
God, how he ever thought he would be able to live without Dean was beyond him. He loved this man so much, and for all he could say that he had truly moved on, there would be no denying that if things had worked out differently and Dean instead came for him in a year, two, five, or even ten, Cas would have gone with him. Cas would always choose Dean.
“What’s what like?” Dean asked, “Having a family?” Cas nodded. Dean frowned and searched his eyes; Cas felt as though his soul was being examined. “I didn’t always have a family, either,” Dean whispered, not breaking eye contact. “I know how hard it is to feel alone; like you’ve got no one. I’m sorry, Cas.”
“If you stay still, then I can finish faster and we can get under the covers of our bed again,” Dean tried to reason with a tired, cold, and cranky Cas.
“Y-yeah,” Cas stuttered.
After a minute of this, a deep voice called the children away by telling them to get back to their chores. The kids had pouted and moped as they left Castiel alone and trudged back to the wagons.
He looked back to the window, opting to stay there for another hour or so until it got dark. After that, he decided he’d go to meet Dean. Although he knew his father would be upset about him not being home for supper that night, he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Yes, we will come around to talk about that when Ellen returns,” she said, “in light of that, the next thing I need to tell you about is that when you wake up again it will more than likely be because of the fact that you have reached the final steps of developing your own sense of scenting. Which means you will be able to scent each alpha, beta, and omegas individual scent. It will be overwhelming, especially in the beginning due to it being so new and foreign to you,” Jess gave Castiel a moment to process before continuing, “Other than that, you will begin to notice your body change in slight ways. Your hips, waist, face, and chest will round out in varying degrees—”
“Oh, yes, I know,” Gabe said with fake enthusiasm. “So many that it occupied every waking moment of your time and the time of the servants who’d been hand picked by the King to deal with the plans for this wedding.”
Cas’s father had left early for a day trip to a neighboring town to prep for his trip to the Royal Kingdom next week; meaning, Cas was excused from his schooling and court observations around midday. Furthermore, he got to meet with Dean and have a hike in the woods together.
“Yes father,” He said timidly. Michael set his jaw and walked over to his door, stopping in the frame and speaking over his shoulder.
“I love you, too,” Dean whispered back, smiling like a sleepy idiot. “Now go back to sleep. I’ll keep the sticky-monster away.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, chuckling. “It’s restored antiques and collectibles. It’s what I do. Well, one of the things I do. I do play around with other things.”
The cannons were as ready as they could be, but they hadn’t been tested. Now was as good a time as any, he supposed. He just prayed to luck that they would work, or else they would be blown out of the water faster than he could get letters to other crews he was friendly with asking for help. On the other hand, if the cannons worked, they could hold their ground until help arrived, if it arrived. If it didn’t, it would be hard, but Dean was confident in his crews ability to fight.
“Fuck,” Dean chuckled, pushing his hips down and thrusting. Cas almost screamed at the friction it caused.
Cas woke up to darkness. Usually, even in the wee hours of the morning, he was able to see a little bit. The moonlight always provided more than enough light to see when it would filter in through the window in the cabin. But now he couldn’t see anything. There was something blocking his vision.
“Oh, my gods,” Dean whispered. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before opening them. A hint of a smile came onto his face. “Okay, new plan. I—”
“Cas?” Rachel’s voice filtered into his ears. It was grating, and Castiel ignored her as he stepped past the threshold into the parlor. The gasps he heard fuel his anger, and he could hear when the rain and thunder started.
sound…” Castiel shuddered and shook his head, the faint memory of those screams made his eyes itch. “Anyway, uh, yeah. That’s what happened.”
Cas whimpered out, “F-feel what?”
“I’m sorry,” Cas wailed in pain, “I’ll do better!”
“You just got scared when Inferno had Arkangel trapped against the edge of the arena and Castiel didn’t fight back…” Gadreel trailed off for a moment before looking back to Castiel with a questioning gaze. “Hey, Cas, what happened then? When Inferno stabbed you? It looked like you and Arkangel gave up for a snap there.”
“You bet,” Garth replied, standing up and almost skipping out of the brig.
“How does your chest feel?” She asked, looking into Cas’s eyes as she used her hands to press against where his father had hit him.
Castiel looked over to where the voice had come from and a tall, lanky man greeted him with a smile.
Castiel looked down at his shoes, feeling shameful and exposed.
“If it counts for anything, I did most of the work,” Dean offered.
.” Jo clawed at his hand, but she couldn’t even get her nails against his skin. “
“It’s not a fake ID is it?”
“Excuse me, I’m sorry. I had no idea,” Michael said, “I’ve only ever been as far as the castle.”
Chapter Thirteen
Cas struggled to his feet, holding his stomach. “I’m sorry.” He coughed and wheezed. His legs shook and his knees felt like they were about to buckle.
Thanksgiving was tomorrow, but Cas was having just a tad bit of trouble feeling very thankful. There was this bone chilling feeling of dread that hadn’t left him since the night he had had that nightmare. The only good thing that had happened in the past few days was that Michael got called to a sister city of Heaven that was across seas by at least two days. It meant that Cas got to spend the next few days with Dean.
He froze as he heard the tell-tale signs of his father walking into the kitchen. But he couldn’t turn around, or his father would know he’d been crying and he didn’t have a good excuse as to why at the moment.
“Fuck, Dean,” Jo exclaimed, exasperated. “You’re letting your past affect you! Anyone with eyes can see you two are bloody soulmates. Cas is head-over-fucking-heels in love with you.”
“If you say so,” Dean chuckled, resting his hands on Cas’s thighs.
Jo, Tessa, and Cole were looking at him with shocked faces, Charlie was blushing, and Benny wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Oi, I will not leave your side, Cas,” Gilda said. Castiel smiled softly, and let Gilda lead him over to the fountain. Dean greeted both of them as they approached.
Two short hours after that, Castiel had his arm linked through Dean’s and was exiting the castle grounds. Dean guided him through the streets and stopped at just about every vendor. He bought Castiel and Alfie small trinkets that caught their eye. He told Castiel that it would be a good idea to get to know some of the people who owned shops in the city and introduced him to them. After that, he took Castiel to the town square so he could meet the leader of the gypsy caravan group because they were the unofficial trade link to other villages in Winchester, as well as other Kingdoms. Castiel agreed, and they decided that would be their last stop before finding somewhere to eat.
“What happened to your neck?” Charlie asked, coming over to inspect Dean.
Dean you always make me feel so good,” Cas gasped and strained against his bonds. Dean smiled to himself. He crooked his fingers and watched as Cas sharply inhale a shaky breath and shiver. “Oh my god, right there, please. Right
Dean barked out a laugh. “Yeah, right! Over my mother’s blue-ribbon-winning pecan pie recipe,” he snorted. Castiel looked up at him with wide, confused eyes and Dean’s heart did a little flip at how cute he was. “Okay, look, I’ll fuck just about anyone—and I love being someone’s first because, I mean, come on. I’m not stupid, I know I’m
“Oi, Cas, well met!” she said, draping her arm over his shoulders.
“It was the intruders from last night,” Rachel said, “Jo and I found her this morning. Jo’s working on getting a diagnostics test done on her to get her back up and running, but it’s slow going.”
“Yes,” Cas sighed, letting Dean unwrap his legs from the man's waist so he could clean them both up.
Castiel could almost hear Jo’s frantic thoughts, but he ignored them.
“What?” Dean asked, moving his hand to grip Cas’s hip.
Dean saw ships. Lots of them.
Luckily for Castiel, it was easy to start school work. Even if it was tedious, he’d always had an appetite for learning anything he could and since he’d stopped his medication, it was even easier to bury himself in homework and studying.
“For the past few months, dad’s been acting weird. He’d been withdrawn, unresponsive to me, and has been in his study at all hours of the day and night. He—”
Castiel looked ‘Dean’ over, feeling an intense longing to be wrapped up in his arms right this second wash over him. “I-I don’t know. Is this—” Castiel pointed his nose. “—you?”
“You are still so young,” Dean said, “I feel as if I am taking advantage of that youth.”
“Do you know who I am?!” Crowley yelled angrily as two more people—Sam and Ash, Cas deducted—pulled him and Meg out of their carriage. “I’m the bloody King!”
“Then it stands to reason that my true mate would be my perfect other half, hence the perfect fit to be Queen,” Dean said, “Whether or not I am mated to him, it does not matter. I never had it on my agenda to mate unless he desired it. And I do not need him to be my mate in order for my mind to be clear enough to be a successful king.”
“How are you going to do that?” Dean asked.
“I missed you,” Dean whispered, turning his head to kiss Cas. “I missed you so much.”
The group was so invested in talking no one but Cas noticed when Gabe came back out with a plate of candy and sat down next to his nephew; he slid into the conversation easily and seamlessly. It was like he belonged with these people.
On his way to the kitchen, his phone rang and upon seeing the caller ID, he couldn’t help the cheek-hurting smile that broke out on his face.
Dean turned just in time to see who he assumed to be Ben’s mother run over to him with her arms out. He gave the kid over to her quickly, and knowing how people felt about him he immediately backed up to a safe distance.
Sorry for such a short chapter, guys. Next one should be longer!
“I got you,” Dean turned his head to kiss Cas’s forehead before he wrapped his arms around him and rolled onto his side, pulling out of Cas as well. He carefully laid Cas on his back and put his arm under his head. “You okay?”
Gilda sighed, “No, Dean, no.”
“Father,” He sobbed, falling back onto the floor, hitting his chin against the rough wood and feeling his teeth rattle. “I’m so sorry!”
“Cas… I didn’t mean—”
“Dean is yours,” Gabe smirked. “And only yours.”
“Would it be alright if I tell you how I remember the day I met you?” He asked.
. Something alphas and betas didn’t have to worry about. “What is he?”
strong. He’s gotta be strong for his job. He owns and operates his own contracting business after all, and installing air conditioners and building houses requires a lot of heavy lifting.”
Lastly was Castiel, himself: Number Seven. Nicknamed after the angel of Thursday, Castiel was only a regular omega. No powers, no talents, nothing to make him special. He was just… Ordinary.
“I love you,” Dean said between kisses.
“Perfect.” Dean smiled. “Can you have Kevin write the letter and one of the swabs — Chuck or Becky, maybe? — can deliver it.”
Cas considered her words, eventually sighing and nodding his head. “You’re right. I’ll tell him.”
“I know,” Cas whispered. “But I’ll be okay.”
He leaned in, stopping so his mouth was right next to Cas’s ear, and whispered, “C’mon darling. Don’t be like that. Why not save the time and just go find somewhere we can be alone right now. Your so pretty and you need to be taken care of. You deserve a real
Now all that kept him up till twelve in the morning was thoughts of Cas. He felt increasingly guilty about not taking him with and finding somewhere for him to stay until it was safe to come get him again, but he couldn’t risk it. Bobby’s house wasn’t an option because if Abbadon was as smart and connected as Dean though she was—and she was—Bobby would already be found out. Dean’s intuition was proven correct because once they got to Bobby’s place, they found it in ruins. Bobby was either dead, being held hostage, or he’d escaped to some uncharted safe place. Knowing the old man, the third option was the most believable.
. No one’s heard of it; but it’s there. You know what it means?” Dean asked. “It’s latin.” He paused and shook his head in spite. “Pit of Abominations,” he laughed bitterly. “It’s an island full of monsters; the scum of the earth.”
The next thing his omega had him remember was the Easter carouse Dean threw the week before Easter, and yeah, Castiel had celebrated Easter before with Alfie and a few other kitchen maids, but he’d never seen anything like when he was at the Easter celebration. There had been dancing and skits, mountains of food and drink, and even some of the castle’s servant staff had attended. Castiel’s omega—after Meg had answered his question of why the servants were attending and he’d been told that Dean invited everyone in the castle to holiday celebrations—had puffed its chest in pride that his—
“I’m not finished with you, angel,” Dean said. “I wanna see how many ways I can make you come without touching your cock.” Cas’s eyes widened.
Dean put his hand on Cas's stomach to still his hips and slowly pumped his finger into Cas, curling them only slightly. "Did I hit your prostate?” Dean asked, licking his lips. Cas nodded and let out a broken whine. “Do you think you could come from just my fingers?” Cas arched his back and bucked himself down to meet Dean’s hand. “I’m gonna take that as a yes.” The pirate added another finger and made sure to bend them in just the right way. Cas started to let pitiful whimpers out and Dean realized then he was too good at his job.
Castiel let out a short scream and Dean felt him coming, squeezing impossibly tight. Dean watched as Castiel’s cock jumped and shot out a load of his release, and Dean took that opportunity to lean back over the omega and start fucking him slowly, drinking in the squeals Castiel let out every time he bottomed out.
“Maybe,” Cas whispered, “But only because of the circumstances you were forced into.” He rested his forehead against Dean’s. “But you know you’re not, don’t you?” Cas felt Dean nod his head.
“No! Because you sound absolutely crazy.”
“Dean,” Lisa spoke quietly, not wanting to wake Ben, “May I ask you a question?”
“Sorry,” Dean said, totally not meaning it, “Duty called.”
“I won’t, Cas.”
“That was one of my favorite shirts,” Dean gasped. He wasn’t exactly sure what to do with his hands and found that he left them hanging at his sides while Cas pushed his shirt to the floor.
“Gods Dean!” Cas heaved, fat tears falling from his eyes.
by threatening Cas. Do you know what I do when I feel threatened?”
~  ~  ~
Castiel smiled as Dean looked up at him with wide eyes. “You’re not going too fast,” Castiel said, climbing up and settling himself on Dean’s lap, “And no, I don’t want to talk, it’s not enough for me.”
“That’s just precome?” Dean asked in disbelief. “Fuck!” The pirate’s resolve broke and he pounded into Cas with reverence.
is crazy, not you. The world ending in a week is…I just—I can’t believe it. It doesn’t make sense.”
“No way,” Castiel said, blushing madly and looking away.
“Yes, alpha! Please!”
“Use your hands for most of it,” Dean said, pushing himself onto his elbows. “How about—” Cas shushed him. Usually he found Dean’s concern with his well-being very pleasant, but right now he was being a nuisance.
The man was breathing hard, biting his lip, and gripping the headboard so hard his hands were turning white. Cas smirked and crawled back up to Dean’s face. “You gonna fuck me now?” He asked, pushing his clothed length against Dean’s and making the older man’s eyes snap open.
Something clicked for Cas then. He reached across the table and took Dean’s hand in his own. “I understand.”
by the way!” Rachel almost sounded hysterical, but Castiel knew there was some truth to her words.
“Son of a bitch,” He mumbled to himself. Cas walked back over to the table with a plate in each hand. He smiled at Dean as he set a plate in front of Dean and then in his place.
“Anna Milton.”
“What?” Dean asked, opening the door to the cabins. “What’d he say? Does he not actually like me?”
texted me back and if I hadn’t just gotten married, I would have obsessed over what I said wrong for the entire week.”
. “Fuck, you’re so ready, aren’t you?”
“M-March,” Castiel said. Meg came to stand at the head of the table with a loaf of bread and peanut butter. She looked at Castiel and smiled fondly.
“Gabe, this is a family store. Please refrain from cursing,” Castiel said absentmindedly, looking over the cereals. “What about this?” He pulled a box off the shelf and turned to show it to Gabe.
“We’re doing the memorial now. In the courtyard. Jo told me to get you guys.”
“I thought so,” Cas said, smiling even more.
“You like having our cocks against each other?”
Crowley guffawed at that. “There is no budget! Only the best for my daughter! Even if it is for a second time,” he said, giving Meg a big, creepy grin.
“Oh, yeah, no, I stabbed a kid with a screwdriver.”
“It’s Castiel,” Ash said, terribly out of breath. “His father…” Ash couldn’t finish.
Dean smiled, scanning Cas’s adorable face, “I’ll be here when you wake up,” he said, running his hands through Cas’s hair, earning a smile from his angel. “We can talk then.”
Dean gingerly untied his wrists and rubbed the light pink indentations from the rope and laid Cas down on his back.
“That’s where you’ve got to be patient with him. You have no idea the horrors he’s had to live through,” Benny said. “And you have to give him time to confide in you with them.”
“That’s what I want to hear,” Dean said, rewarding Cas by thrusting into him, slow and deep. Dean pushed himself up on one arm while the other came to grip Cas’s hair. He pulled Cas’s head up by his locks and fucked into him. “Keep talking.”
“Dean, that pie was supposed to be for Charlie and Gilda. You know Jo is trying to...woo them, I guess.”
“No,” Alfie whispered. Castiel looked to him, about to ask what was wrong when he took off running into the tavern.
It still made him feel a little gross, but Dean figured that may have to go away with time; because there was no way he could stop himself from seeing Castiel again. That little voice inside him told him that Castiel was it for him, and Dean knew to listen to that voice whenever it spoke.
“No, Dean,” Cas said, his voice barely above a whisper. “No…
“Absolutely. And when he’d wake up in the mornings, that’s when he was cutest.” Cas’s eyes came up to meet Benny’s for a split second, a brightness in them, before going back to Dean’s face. “But don’t tell him I told you.”
“That’s great,” Cas said.
“You’ve been fantasizing about me since you were thirteen? I was…” Dean did some quick mental math as he found a band and quickly put it around his wrist. “Fucking—I was
” Rachel utterly shrieked, her voice so high it had to have hurt her throat coming out. “I’m worried that this fucker is gonna come back and rape Cas! I’m afraid he’s gonna come back and break him like those pirate scum did!”
“Better than I know you, actually,” he said, and the hurt and guilt in Rachel’s eyes and on her face spoke millions of words. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—”
Three months out at sea had gone by. Three months without Cas… Torture.
“Dean?” he whispered, and he let go of his siblings. The energy that’d been seeping out of him and building around them rushed into him and the force of it snapping back to him propelled him towards Dean.
“It’s been storming for three days,” Cas stated, wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders. “The sea is going to be dangerous.”
“What do you mean by that?” Jo asked, pushing herself off the wall.
Dean laughed, “Oh, Sandover,” he started, putting his hand on his shoulder. “You know that’s not true.”
“I’m not jealous,” Cas grumbled, picking up his pace.
Dean looked at the ground and shook his head, “No, no, no. That’d be too easy.” He looked back up into her frightened eyes. “I’m going to make you
She tugged on Castiel’s arm to get him to move. Castiel nodded distractedly again, and forced himself to stop looking at the sunflowers. He, Gilda, and Dean moved on. They passed a planter with tulips, another with roses, and several filled with tulips of all different colors. Castiel saw peonies, lilacs, lavender, hydrangeas, and gladioluses. Each batch of flower complimented the next, and the way it had been designed, the colors seemed to transition seamlessly into the next.
was a godsend. It put his nerves at ease and made it easier to sleep at night.
Jack yelled happily and reached for Dean’s mouth again, but Dean blocked him.
to want you.”
“Yes,” Castiel said, “I will give you a chance, Dean.”
like you.” Dean heard the layer of emotion in Cas’s words.
Amara liked knives, and she liked using them on Dean almost too much. He didn’t have scars because Amara was smart. She didn’t want to mark him, she just wanted to hurt him. And seeing as he’d just upset her, tonight would be hard to get through for more than one reason.
“I don’t know,” Dean said, taking a hesitant step forward, inhaling deeply before bolting over to Castiel and burying his face in the man’s neck as he wrapped his arms around his waist.
“I work here,” she explained. “It’s my
“Some interesting bee facts for you,” he said, smiling wide. Dean smiled back and took a deep breath.
Castiel shook his head. “Thank you, Dean,” he said, frowning at the thought of telling Dean who his family was, because as soon as Dean knew who they were, he wouldn’t be saying Castiel was special. Dean would look at him like everyone else when they found out and would make some excuse to leave him walking alone. But it was better to say it now than let either one of them invest more thought into each other than necessary. “But I really am ordinary compared to my family.”
“That was—”
“Let me go. I can walk on my own, thank you,” Cas snarked. Ava shot him an unsettling look as they made their way through the kitchen and out the back door.
“I hate this,” Castiel blurted out, “I
“Please?” Cas asked, gripping onto Dean’s hands while they made love. “Please stay; just one more week.” Cas ended his words with a gasp as Dean thrust into him.
“A gang of pirate raiders,” Castiel said. “Three of them had waited to get me alone before they grabbed me. And then four more appeared and… You can fill in the rest.”
“Dean couldn’t have taken me with?”
“Who doesn’t?”
~  ~  ~
“Hey sleepy head,” Cas greeted, smiling warmly at Dean.
“He told me he killed you!” Benny said, holding onto Alfie like his life depended on it. Castiel guessed maybe it actually might. “He told me he killed you as punishment for what we did!”
When Castiel complained to his mother about not wanting to be betrothed to the Prince, she told him there was nothing she could do about it. And when Castiel asked why he, the son of a scullery maid was betrothed to the Prince of one of the most powerful kingdoms known in the western world, the only thing she would tell Castiel was that he had been betrothed to him since he was born. It wasn’t until some time after he’d turned eight, the granddaughter of the omega who’d helped birth him, Anna, told him the twice handed down and rumor-influenced story of his birth.
“Dean,” She said, sounding worried. “We heard a bell, what’s going on?”
Cas shook his head softly. “No. Not right now, at least. Can we just go to our room?”
“Perfect,” He said, moving his hand on to Cas’s stomach and slowly sliding it farther down.
Abbadon screamed, making Dean turn around and snarl at her. She raised her arm and a loud bang rang in everyone’s ears. Dean felt pain explode in his shoulder as the impact of the bullet jerked him back.
Dean’s face softened and his eyes turned a little glassy. “You choose me?”
thought it too difficult, too trivial,
“You not being able to talk does sound appealing,” Castiel said, threading his hand into Dean’s hair.
“I can walk you part way home, maybe?” Dean offered. Castiel looked back up at Dean curiously and was surprised to see Dean’s face morph into a look of uncertainty. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable or think I’m some knothead,” he quickly said, laughing under his breath nervously. “I guess I just want to make sure you’re okay and get at least part of the way home alright.”
“Where is he now?”
me understand the big emotions and deal with them. He should have—”
“The honeyed fruit,” Castiel said softly. Charlie quickly turned to grab something from another tray behind her.
Cas had to take a few minutes to collect himself before he could open his eyes and look at Dean’s own length, still hard and precome beading at the slit. He groaned as he tried to push himself up to help Dean take care of it, but Dean stopped him.
“Cas—” Jo tried; her voice so hoarse it almost made Castiel cringe.
“Lisa,” he started. “Drop this nonsense. You’re not a pirate. You’re a whore.” His eyes scanned her body hungrily. “I’ll even buy you right now.”
“Castiel doesn’t want this. He doesn’t love Meg and he never will. You’re forcing him to do this. You’re using him as a trading piece for your own game and I know that is common for people of our status, but you don’t have to be like everyone else,” Gabe said pleadingly. Michael shook his head again.
“I’m not jealous,” Cas insisted, his head twitching a little to look at Gabe. “I’m not.”
Dean furrowed his brows. “No...?”
“With how much sex you one-hundred-percent definitely have had, I find it hard to believe you don’t know that knotting feels fantastic and alphas love it… So…”
“Did you know that bees never sleep? And that there are three types of honey bees: the queen, the workers, and the drones,” Cas said, seeing Dean smile a little bit. “Honey bees fly at 15 miles per hour and their wings stroke 11,400 times per minute, thus making their distinctive buzz. And they’re the only insect that produce food for humans. They will usually travel approximately 3 miles from their hive. They’re the only bees that die after they sting, they have five eyes: 3 small ones on top of the head and two big ones in front. They also have hair
“For what?” Benny finished the question.
“Cas? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Did I say something wrong?” Dean asked. Even in Castiel’s haze he could hear the worry in Dean’s voice. But he ignored it because
“I need you out of these offensive garments,” he said. Dean chuckled and leaned in to kiss him, but Castiel blocked him and did his best to growl at Dean. “No kisses until you are nude.”
“...Ever.” Dean heard Cas’s heart even out and fell asleep listening to it.
“I mean, I do have to be a little humble. Your hands aren’t that big to begin with so—”
Partly because of that, Castiel could see Dean had already started to worry about him. Their sex life abruptly stopped three weeks ago. The same day Castiel and Dean ran into the two of them at the mall. Now, Dean was lucky to get a short, halfhearted make out session between work and classes.
Note: I talk about Don Quixote in this chapter, but I have never personally read the book, so take what I write about it with a grain of salt.
, I mean.” Dean ducked his head, and Castiel couldn’t help the huff of laughter that slipped out. “And I’m clean, you know, I always wore condoms and still I get myself checked at least once a year. And I’ve never been with an omega in heat or when I was in rut. I was kinda ‘saving’ that for my mate,” he said, and Castiel smiled. He reached up and cupped Dean’s face gently, some emotion swelling in his chest when Dean turned into his hand. “I… I wanted you to know.”
“Benny and Sam have been by your side since you bought your ship,” Jo pushed Dean to look at her. “Do you know how many crew members they’ve seen die?” Dean looked at her with a pained expression. “Three, Dean.
“What do you mean?”
“Really?”
“What do you mean by that?” Dean asked, leaning into Cas involuntarily.
“I’m sorry,” Cas turned his head to look at her out of the corner of his eye. She smiled warmly while she worked.
Lisa nodded, looking at Dean’s face and feeling like she was about to cry. “He was talking to me the other day about how he wanted to give
“Cas?”
“Why not?” Dean sounded like a child asking that. “It gives you plenty of time to really consider your options.”
Castiel looked down at his hands. “Jo is saying that she thinks one of us killed dad,” he said.
Dean smiled, closing his eyes and holding Cas close to his body. “Happy birthday, my angel.”
Cas moved one of his hands off Dean’s shaft and slid it to push against the man’s abdomen, drawing out a whine from Dean’s lips.
“We all did, Cas!” Gabe said, and he sounded like he was crying, too.
Dean’s posture tensed and he took a step towards them, never taking his eyes off Ava, “Who do you think you're talking to?” he said.
“I can’t feel my back,” Cas said. He grabbed the hand Dean had on his side and pushed it into his groin while taking the pirates other hand and bringing it to his chest.
“Dean,” Cas breathed out, smiling as he turned around and saw Dean. His smile fell immediately as he saw the man’s face and the nasty cut starting from one side of his face, and ending just above his eye on the left. “Dean?”
“It was
“D-Dean?” Castiel whimpered, grabbing ahold of the quilt under him and gripping it with all his strength.
Castiel sighed and looked away from Dean, frowning as he sat up and slid off the huge bed.
and impressionable and Dean had gone and fucked some omega close to his family. Jesus, Dean was glad he'd given his food to Castiel because he was certain he’d be chucking it right back up if he’d eaten it.
“Cas, no answer is needed,” she said softly, “We are your friends, and we will understand if you have no desire to explain anything.”
Now, Castiel wasn’t entirely certain why he was so tired and why his body felt like his bones had been replaced with lead. A lot of times he was mentally tired after a fight, but he was never physically exhausted. And he didn’t know why that irritated him so much. The past few days had been some of the weirdest he’d had in a long time, that was true, but even still. Things were relatively back to normal. There was just this itch somewhere inside Castiel that he couldn’t scratch.

“But in more pressing news, Cas, look,” Meg began, “You’re the only one that I can trust right now.”
“You wouldn’t understand,” he mumbled, looking straight ahead as they exited the market and walked along the path back to the Novak Manor. Gabe looked at Cas’s profile, letting out a small laugh.
I did anything, it was only because you helped me out with Alastair. If it was anything, all I had for you was just a trauma bond. Nothing more.”
Dean laughed breathlessly, but did as he was told, kissing, licking, and biting over Cas’s neck. He stopped every few inches to suck a purple blotch into Cas’s skin, making Cas moan softly with each bruise. Cas begged for more when Dean was done. He got worked up the more Dean kissed him, and the more worked up he got, the closer he was to coming.
“True mates?” Gadreel supplied. Castiel ignored the pang from his omega in his stomach and nodded.
Dean chuckled, pumping his hand over Cas’s cock again. “Sh, Angel.” Cas shook his head, biting his lip and moaning softly. Dean smiled again and sped up his hand, making Cas writhe and pull against his bonds.
was ready. It wasn’t just you —  they came out of nowhere
Dean moved his hand to look at her, “You know why.”
Cas nodded his head, “I wouldn’t want to hurt him.”
“I really love you, too,” he whispered, placing another kiss on Cas’s collar bone. “Night, Cas.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Cas asked, scooting closer and sliding his hand from Dean’s face to settle over his heart.
“Get out of the way, Dean. I’ll kill him, and we can go back to how we were.” Amara shrugged. “Or maybe we can make some different arrangements in our sex life. I know you don’t like my knives so, maybe, I can find someone else I like for that part.”
Lucifer stared at him intently, huffing after a second and shaking his head. “Okay, forget my question from before, let’s go this route: why don’t you like me?”
“And we need to be ruthless. We need to be absolutely—”
First, though, he wanted to make her squirm.
lying to me!” More hits against Cas’s back. Cas was on the floor and trying to keep his sobs in. “So you must think I’m a fool!” Michael punctuated each word with a violent whip on his son’s back.
Castiel grabbed handfuls of the bedsheets and bit his bottom lip so hard he was sure he was about to break the skin as Dean’s tongue trailed over his hip bones. He could feel Dean’s hands sliding down his body, and it made him want to both push into it and pull away because it felt so nice yet so foreign.
“WHOA!” The yell of the driver and the carriage lurching dramatically cut Gabe off. “What are you do—”
“Castiel,” Michael’s voice cut through to him. “We're starting up again. Pay attention and take more than copious notes.”
“Whatever Dean, just
“I love it,” Dean said. He looked at all of his mates and smiled gratefully. “Thank you.”
“Alpha!” Castiel gasped, his whole body tensing as he felt his pleasure crest once more. “Oh, alpha! I wanna see you!” He cried, his body undulating only in slight ways because Dean’s much larger frame was keeping him boxed in.

Dean kissed Castiel passionately as he laid them down on his bed, settling himself against Castiel in the best way possible. Their hips were flush against each other, and Castiel felt so vulnerable because, both physically and emotionally, he’d never had anyone be this close to him. He was still a virgin, technically.
It was like lightning was sparking through his whole body, and with every movement, Castiel couldn’t help but vocalize his pleasure to Dean. Each time Dean pushed into him, his eyes rolled up into his head because, Lord help him, indescribable pleasure coursed through his body. Then when Dean pulled out, Castiel moaned and forced his eyes open to look into Dean’s eyes because he couldn’t bare not seeing his alpha for even that long.
That thought; the thought that he couldn’t control himself—and it was because his
“Dean,” Dean said, nosing at Castiel’s neck. “My name is Dean.”
“C-Cas,” Dean rasped, throwing his head back and moaning loudly.
“Yeah,” Cas whimpered.
“Okay, go back to your book,” Dean chuckled.
Dean let out a shaky laugh, “We’ll agree to disagree about my goodness, then.”
“Cas!” Dean smiled brightly at Castiel and stepped aside to hold the door open for him. “Come in!”
“Yeah?” Cas asked, curling into the taller man’s side and scratching Dean’s back. “One could — and should — say, I’m the one who made you sore, too.”
Dean said, and Castiel could hear frantic rustling from his end.
“Yeah?”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked, “What’s going on? Why me?”
“Okay, angel,” Dean whispered, “You want some more water?”
Castiel looked around at his siblings, but he couldn’t find it in himself to feel upset that no one raised their hand or spoke up. He certainly didn’t have anything nice to say, so he wasn’t going to say anything at all.
Dean let out a steady breath before he answered. “Ask away.”
Castiel saw what Dean saw the first time his mother held him. He saw Dean growing up with his mother and Ellen. He felt how happy Dean was when he was in his mother's arms, and he felt how sad Dean had been as he saw his mother whither away and eventually pass. Castiel felt the resentment he had towards his father, and how it grew as he got older.
“You look so fucking amazing doing that,” Dean said, his voice thick with arousal. Cas looked up at Dean through his lashes and moved the hand he had on Dean’s thigh to his own clothed erection. He palmed himself furiously, whining around Dean’s shaft.
It startled Castiel just a bit when Dean spoke again, a soft element to his voice. “I am not stupid,” he said, “Despite whatever disparaging—yet still loving—sentiments Ellen, Jess, and Charlie may have told you, I do know when someone is holding back or lying.”
Castiel forced a small smile onto his face. “Thanks.”
, Dean wasn’t moving away.
“Hey, why the long face?” Rachel asked Castiel, giggling as Gadreel tickled her. She took another drink of the celebratory tequila the arena gave to them as a prize for winning tonight’s fight. “We won, didn’t we? And the arena threw this party for us, didn’t they?”
They quickly made their way through the halls to the beautifully decorated chapel all the royal weddings had been conducted in since the castle was built. Castiel could barely contain his excitement as they arrived. Benny, Sam, Jo, Victor, and Gadreel met them at the entrance and each apha linked arms with the omega they were walking down the aisle with and got in line: Sam and Jess, Jo and Gilda, Victor and Charlie, Meg and Gadreel, and lastly, Benny and Alfie. .
“You are?” Dean pushed his hips into Cas’s in a long, slow drag that had him gasping for breath and his thighs quivering.
“I do not?” Dean asked, his voice wavering just barely enough to be noticed.
“Wanna help me shower?” He asked, a pleased smirk on his face.
“Okay, but you’re sick... I’m not going to hold it against you if you can’t do this, Cas. We’ve been together for five years, it’s not like we haven’t had other crazy nights of birthday sex,” Dean said. Castiel huffed and pushed himself up onto his elbows.
Dean cut Gilda off with a bitter laugh. “That’s why I think Cas can do better.”
“Fuck,” Dean groaned and followed in his release, looking up at Cas’s face as he did. He thrust once more, almost collapsing at the whimpered moan that came out of Cas: completely wrecked and blissed out. “I love you…” Dean breathed. Cas panted, trying to catch his breath enough to respond. Of course, he didn’t need to. But he wanted to, and Dean gave him the time he needed to be able to recover.
“What’s the matter?” Dean asked, looking from Sam to Chuck and back again.
or reason for leaving or anything.” Cas’s eyes changed and Sam saw nothing but fury in them. “No letters, no messages in a bottle, nothing!
Dean had never been with an omega who’d come so hard they basically emptied their entire body of slick
“You know how long I can hold off my orgasm for,” Dean said, smiling before nipping at Cas’s skin. “But this time I can hit your prostate as much as I want, make you come time after time, without release.”

By the time Dean turned fifteen, it had been long since he had lost hope of ever getting out. He often found himself dreaming and wishing for death. That’s when Benny showed up. He was also meant to be another slave for the monster, but in reality, Benny was just another tool to torture Dean.
“I saw you talking to Lucifer the other day,” Gilda said after a while. “You didn’t look very happy. What was that about?”
say you’re sorry!” Castiel snapped Benny’s arm forward, trying to ignore the sickening
“That’s good for him. But as painful as it is, I got to the point of moving on.” Cas sat back down. “May I have some privacy now? I’d like to change into some clothes.”
Dean was toned. And tan. And it was everywhere. It was like Castiel’s own personal wet dream, and he wanted to touch and kiss and lick everywhere he could.
“Yes!” Castiel moaned, raking his nails down Dean’s arms as Dean freed his legs from his panties. He felt Dean’s teeth press into his neck at the same time and the sensation made him cry out in need and jerk his legs open. His heart
Castiel came back to the present, but nothing had changed... He still saw Dean looking at him like he was the most beautiful thing in the entire universe. Like he’s hung the stars in the sky.
It wouldn't work, though. Dean was…committed to this…whatever you want to call it.
“What are you doing here?” Castiel asked. Dean smiled at him nervously and rubbed at the back of his neck.
Cas groaned as he felt himself waking up. “Dean?”
“I think Gabe fits in really well with your mates,” Cas said, looking up at Dean.
“Will you tell me if you want to stop, Cas?” Dean asked as he lifted the covers and got under them, sliding closer to Castiel.
“It is exquisite,” she said, “Dean has an eye for gardening. He designed the layout himself.”
“I told you you were going down,” Alastair said, “one way or another
Gadreel nodded. “Sounds like his scent is just activating your mate and nest instinct.”
“Y-yeah,” Dean rasped, not able to tear his eyes away from Cas’s face.
Cas tightened his grip on Dean as he went over the edge and Dean came at the same time Cas did, with a quiet shout of ‘
“Oh, boy; you’re so spoiled,” Dean joked.
Cas swallowed Dean’s cum, sucking gently for a few beats of his heart before pulling off and standing up. He pushed Dean’s pants down to the floor and Dean immediately kicked them off, allowing himself to be guided to the bed and to be roughly pushed down onto it. Cas told him to sit at the headboard and Dean followed through, watching Cas as he stripped quickly.
“I-I don’t want to be able to close my legs,” Cas clarified, biting his lip and thrusting up into Dean.
“Safer, but not smarter.
“Tomorrow is a free day, so we can stay in here as long as you want,” Alfie said. Cas hummed to let Alfie know he heard. “Or we could go to the garden? I know you like to smell the flowers and watch the bees. I saw you smile last time.”
Dean moved his fingers in a ‘come hither’ motion and arched and eyebrow as Cas’s body convulsed and he came, his mouth falling open in a silent scream. He didn’t stop until Cas was panting and clenching his legs around Dean in an attempt to get the older man to stop.
Until he really thought about it and thought about Dean’s employment to Amara. “That’s why you’re with Amara?”
Another tear fell down Dean’s face and Castiel wiped it away. He stepped forward into Dean’s personal space, cupping the alpha’s cheek. And then that feeling from before sparked back to life. That heat inside him ignited and it made him surge forward to kiss Dean.
Cas nodded, taking a few step backwards out of the kitchen. “Thank you,” he said one last time before turning and walking briskly out into the mess and then onto the main deck.
Cas eyes him suspiciously, “What have you got behind your back?”
tired?” he asked.
“Amara is dangerous, Cas,” Dean said, “And I’m not saying that you have to lose your next match, you just—you have to be careful because Amara will come after you. I’m not supposed to know this, but she’s sending you up against Lucifer.”
“But you are, Dean! You are a hero. You’ve gotten rid of some of the nastiest people on earth because of your Demon Deals.”
Castiel didn’t know what to say. What Dean was offering was exactly what he wished for growing up. A mate who didn’t claim ownership of him. Who let him be his own person, but didn’t neglect him. A mate who was his equal.
TW: Abuse, rape, torture (all done when Dean was a child so it's in the past, but still.)
“Ah,” Dean chuckled, smiling. Cas started to giggle, but it turned into a yawn.
Dean’s first week back from sea went by in a blur. The two saw each other whenever they could and spent the majority of the time talking and laughing together, as well as getting to know Dean’s crew better. At one point Cas even risked sneaking out of one of his father’s town meetings to see Dean and his first mates during the day.
