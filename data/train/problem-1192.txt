When they were out of earshot, the silver-haired man let out a chuckle. "He always looks like someone has rammed something up his arse," he commented lightly. John almost stopped walking, shocked. "Authority means too much to that man," Lestrade continued, as though unaware of his quarry's shock. "Needs to be knocked down a peg. Do you prefer John, or is Watson all right?"

"I will send someone out to have a look at her," he promised. "Horatia is in the group by the cemetery, correct?" The girl muttered another
And that,
other men fight."
Sherlock caught the eye of a woman standing thirty feet away from them in the square, a child clinging to her hand, and beamed at her. She gave a long, lingering look up and down both of their bodies, smiled back at him, and then led her child out of the way. He wondered what she thought of them. Whether she saw them as lovers, or whether his possessive lunge for John had made her think of them as master and slave.
John frowned. "But you said he did not come in through the door," he said slowly. "With one leg, Small cannot have been capable of getting in another way, can he?"
"I am supposed to be fighting in the next round," John murmured.
He liked most of the gladiators in Lestrade's arena; they were skilled fighters and they appreciated fighting with someone whose skill rivalled their own – for the joy of fighting, not for that of killing. Nevertheless, he jumped at the first man who attempted to attack him with a challenging gleam in his eyes; parried a few blows before executing a quick flick of his wrist and disarming the gladiator, pointing the sword in his left hand at the man's throat while keeping his right hand ready in case someone attempted to attack him before the gladiator could signal surrender.
?" he repeated incredulously.
John raised his remaining weapon between his eyes, inclining his head politely at the other man, and then flicked it off to the side and bent his back slightly in a tiny bow. He wasn't sure whether he expected Tonga to return the salute until he did, that confident half-smile still on his face.
Sherlock closed his eyes and pressed the heels of his hands into their sockets, trying to ignore Mycroft's smug smile eating at him from the corner, sensing the moment his brother lost interest in the conversation and turned back to his tablet. The problem afforded considerable thought. He wanted Watson as his, wanted him to smile because Sherlock had made it so, wanted him to
his brother to abdicate the Empire to him, but he had to admit he wasn't entirely surprised that he had. Mycroft understood the importance of having a leader the city could get behind. And Sherlock understood what made the people live happily from day to day. So having Sherlock on the throne, at least ostensibly, made sense.
The Emperor tilted his head to one side as John finally looked up. "May I ask where you gained your impressive knowledge of human anatomy?"
"I wish to conduct an assessment of trust," he said, his voice slightly clinical underneath the halting timidity.
"You are the Emperor," John reminded him, grabbing his rear and grinding them together. "It does not matter whether he
It took Sherlock a moment to break through the haze of conflicted arousal and realise that his brother was talking to him. The realisation that he would have to face Mycroft solved the problem entirely. "Of course," he replied. "It is working exactly as I planned it to."
John winced as Sherlock's knee bumped the gash on his thigh. "Please do not be sorry," he tried to say, but the Emperor was already letting him go, bending down to examine the thigh with an intent expression, his unfathomable eyes flicking worriedly up to John's face.
Holmes offered him a brief sympathetic smile before turning back to the stain. "And they did not clean anything away? No attempt was made to remove this stain?"
There was more blood on the floor, a more substantial smear in which the clear shape of a footprint could be made out. John knelt beside him and whistled lowly at it.
," Sherlock pronounced carefully, "am not. The Saturnalia games are five days away. You will be placed in that arena with only your hands, and then you will die."
He tried to stop himself thinking about the reason John had smelt like that last night, like sweat and exertion and contentment, but it was useless. He inched his groin away from the gladiator's side instead as it began to twitch and swell, hoping the older man wouldn't notice and it would perhaps go away on its own.
Sherlock pictured it, the two of them sitting on this same bed, their hair gone to grey and their skin to wrinkles with the weight of years spent together. His hands clenched on John's hips, bunching toga and skin between his fingers. "I love you," he gasped out, burying his face against the shorter man's chest, trying to hide the way his throat had closed and his eyes were prickling.
The gladiator stood a reasonable distance away from him, frowning heavily. "No," he said finally.

"I think so," John replied, but there was hesitation in his voice; Sherlock bent to kiss him softly.
Sherlock didn't get anything done all day.

in ways I probably should have expected but completely didn't. I'm not quite sure what we're going to do now that it's over...
. I often feel that since I took the lanista position you barely know which weapons each of your gladiators favour.
All the hesitation, regret, hope and trepidation leaked out of Sherlock as John relaxed his posture and gave him the same friendly, mischievous grin he'd displayed the previous night. "Of course. Sherlock."
"Cerberus?" John repeated questioningly, accepting the kiss Sherlock planted on his temple.
It hit Small's crutch. With an undignified, high-pitched shriek, the one-legged murderer overbalanced and – minutely, agonisingly slowly, so that John could almost document it as it happened – toppled into the river Tiber. John watched in awe and amazement as the sails buckled and swung inwards, the ropes flailing where the tug of Small's collapse had yanked them out of line.
. "Yes, it is," the younger man said slowly, turning back to look at it. "The sign of four, in fact."
John dropped respectfully back to one knee in front of the Emperor as he approached; Sherlock Holmes lifted a facetious eyebrow at Lestrade before rolling his eyes at the prostrate gladiator. "Oh, Jupiter," he said dryly. "Get up." John hastily recovered his footing, keeping his eyes averted. "John Watson, is it?"

"Her name was Mary," he growled, jabbing the sword just hard enough to draw blood and watch the dark eyes widen in the sudden fear of the man who knows he has lost. "And she was my entire world."
John did not laugh; he smiled for a moment, and then frowned as though having second thoughts about Mrs Morstan's reaction. "I believe that would be the case, were her daughter still living," he said slowly. "But if you are worried, we do not have to tell her that we are lovers."
to be Sherlock's lover. And perhaps, given time, that could mean the same thing.
all my life finding out. You must understand what I mean," he said slowly, frowning hesitantly at him. "You
To distract the man as he gently slid his finger through the tight ring of slick muscle, he adjusted his face against John's belly and scraped his teeth against it. John shuddered and lifted his hand back to nest in Sherlock's hair as he kissed and bit and licked his way across the arenarius' stomach, his finger twisting and sliding between John's legs.
"My Lord," the lanista greeted when they were close enough. "John, I am afraid I have some alarming news." John reflexively clutched Sherlock's hand tighter, raising his eyebrows questioningly. "They have found Bartholomew Sholto."
There had been a puddle of blood spreading slowly from her head, sticking in her auburn hair. John had got his knees filthy with it, mixed into the dirt, as he had bent to cradle her head. The blood had come from a relatively small wound in her neck – the jugular, he had realised later when he had recovered enough thought to consider it. He had closed his eyes and kissed her forehead, blood smearing across his lips.
Watson jumped a mile in the air and almost knocked it off its stand. Personally, Sherlock wouldn't have minded if it had shattered. "Y-your Excellency," the gladiator stuttered.
John smirked at the trembling man underneath him and kept his mouth closed as he bent his head to Sherlock's inner thighs. The Emperor sighed, his eyes closing again. John was quietly surprised that he had not attempted to push John to go faster yet. As a reward, he stuck out his tongue and licked a long, firm stripe up the seam of his balls, resting his nose at the base of the long, proud erection he found at the end of his tongue. Sherlock made a guttural sound in the back of his throat; when John looked up at him around his penis, he had twisted his hands to grip
"And many of them would chose death," Sherlock agreed, unable to keep from smiling even though John would not see it.
"We are very different people," Sherlock said simply, shrugging. "We always have been."

The gladiator hummed, rolling himself until he was splayed between Sherlock's legs, resting his chin on Sherlock's chest, underneath his folded arms. "What about when I am not training, but you are elsewhere?"
the respect of these men rather than inherited it. And that was another thing that Mycroft could not understand, having been bowed and scraped to as the future Emperor all of his life.
"He... he did, my Lord," Watson ventured timidly. "I was aware that such a request was possible when I was summoned. I simply was not expecting you to put it so... bluntly. Most people would attempt to be delicate about such things."
John understood perfectly what he needed, and so he thrust his hips forward sharply, making Sherlock yelp and clatter the bar above the bed against the wall. As he rested there, fully seated inside the gloriously tight warmth, Sherlock let out his breath on an abandoned moan. "John –"
The Emperor watched him for a moment before answering. "Had you died, I never would have forgiven you," he said quietly. "But I… I
Sherlock chuckled slightly derisively as he stood up.
of John. "Thank you," he whispered. John chuckled. "I promise to be gentle. Would you…" he closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. "Would you rather I did not attempt to give you pleasure? I understand it may compromise you, morally."
John looked up at him, and Sherlock thought on his first look that the gladiator was crying; a second look revealed that his eyes were simply bright with some strong emotion. "You took the brooch off your toga and gave it to her, telling her not to accept less than she needed to repay the debt, free her husband and survive for the next few years for it.
Watching the disturbingly fast, focused attack on the unsuspecting warrior, Sherlock felt his groin begin to stir and swell under his toga.
"You cannot know
John tried to smile, but the lanista had already looked away, discarding John's sword and picking up the other one, twisting linen around his palms. "I am capable of wrapping my own sword, sir," he reminded him. Dimmock looked up, his eyes scathing. John smiled as the man thrust the blade in his direction.
There was, of course, the matter of the act Holmes had asked him to perform. Taking penetrative sex from another man would earn him more disrepute than joining the gladiators had. And yet, it was not as though the Emperor was about to scream it from the top tier of the Circus Maximus. And besides, he was already
John sniffed faintly. "So he was killed in this room?" he guessed.
Oh, Sherlock. Your eyelids flutter shut as I work my way up your legs and I can feel my own heart quickening when I find the firm swell of your bare backside instead of the folds of fabric I had expected. Your skin is smooth and warm and beautiful, and I want to bury myself inside it, wrap you all around me. I slide my fingers over your rear, down into the delicious dip between your cheeks and –

have cheered, or perhaps jumped up and kissed his Emperor until they were both horizontal and gasping for breath, had he not been rowing as hard as he could to catch up with his confederate. The barbarian did not appear to have noticed the absence of his companion, though John could quite plainly see Small's crutch – and, a moment later, his flailing arms and shaggy head – bobbing to the surface in his wake.
"What?"
The two fighters watched in silence as the tall Emperor strode away across the sand. "What was that?" John asked finally, when the iron grate door had creaked shut behind him.
Sherlock looked at him intently. "So what happened to the brooch?" he asked.
Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief and squeezed John's hand. "I was afraid my heart would stop," he admitted. "I could not bear to lose you."
not also be in danger?"
For a moment they lay there, side by side, panting and trembling with the tentative spasms of excitement still flooding their bodies. Then John huffed out a long, satisfied puff of air. "I will find something to clean you up a little," he said matter-of-factly, getting up. Sherlock would almost rather that the two of them simply fell asleep there, a tangle of sweat and other body fluids. But he understood John's discomfort, so he nodded.
Only you enjoy it when I am demanding, or we would not be here. Lie back and pass me that bottle; I want to own you, so brittle and godlike on my rickety slave's bed, surrounded by
At the very least, he wanted to be able to simply spend some time with Sherlock without the pressure of catching anyone's killer.
John blinked. "Are you sure?"
The gladiator chuckled. "So am I," he said firmly. "So many of us in the city are. And not just for the Empire, but for the
It was a breach of the trust that surrounded the arena, and strange as that trust seemed to someone newly introduced to it, the breach had startled everyone. John supposed he ought not to feel so bad about being caught so thoroughly by surprise.
John darted forwards, crushing his lower lip between his teeth as his leg screamed at him, his sword aiming for Tonga's neck. Sure enough, the moment he had begun to move, the bigger man had stepped forwards and to the side, his body shifting smoothly out of the way of the strike and his own sword corkscrewing towards the soft flesh of John's belly.
like him were John and Lestrade. He smiled tentatively back; John took his hand and squeezed it.
Perhaps not right outside the Circus Maximus, though, he reasoned. With one last suckling press of lips and tongues, he withdrew his mouth from John's and rested their foreheads together, blowing a quiet laugh against his cheek. John chuckled back.
John's arms slowly clutched tighter around him. "Goodnight, Sherlock."
The tablet the elder Holmes had been perusing clinked against the wood of his desk. Sherlock stuck his chin out obstinately. "That would be unwise."
With a tiny smile, Sherlock bent and rummaged in the trunk at the foot of the ginormous bed. Lazily, John slid out of his toga as he watched the supple curve of his lover's back. Then Sherlock came up, still looking tremendously, adorably nervous, clutching tightly in his hands a length of rope.
Go on, then. I would never turn down an offer like that – and Venus knows it will not take long enough for me to worry about hurting your knees. I have thought about this as well – even naked and glistening with sweat and seed you look like something precious. On your knees like this you could be praying, except that your deity, the one to whom your worshipful upwards gaze is directed, is

Suddenly they were kissing, though Sherlock could not quite recall moving towards it; John's lips were warm against his, his tongue pleasant. He grasped the gladiator's waist and yanked him flush against his body, revelling in the familiar weight of him, the way he fit so neatly into Sherlock's curves and angles.
of it was overwhelming; no way could John hold back now, and he thought that Sherlock might actually feed him to wild animals if he did. He gasped out a desperate iteration of the Emperor's name and reached down to take hold of his purpling erection and that was it. Sherlock threw his head back in an exultant scream, his toes curling so tightly that they brushed John's back, as he shuddered with pleasure. John somehow found the presence of mind to reach up and pull the fabric tying Sherlock's wrists undone before his own climax exploded through him, blinding him to everything else until his lover's screams died down into sated whimpers and their slick, sweaty chests heaved together.
to give him up – and wouldn't that put him in quite the situation? He resolved to train harder; quite apart from the fuss that the Emperor might cause if Lestrade had to talk to him, John himself did not want to give up the arrangement.
when they would sleep together? Had actually sounded
Lestrade slipped past them to fix his torch to a bracket outside the door. "If they did not come in through the door, then how did they get here?"
Sherlock seemed to calm down slightly, though he still insisted on probing it carefully with his fingers to ascertain how deep the gash was. "You are right," he said finally. He stayed on his knees, staring up at John with those incredible eyes, his chin resting tantalisingly in the softness of John's abdomen. John swallowed. "John, what I said that night, I did not mean it the way it sounded," the Emperor said slowly.
John could hardly help the smile. "He seemed incredibly... human."
John smiled back. "He wants to help," he said softly. Claudia stepped aside to let him into the house, and Sherlock smiled at her, stooping to avoid bumping his head on the low doorframe. The hood covered his eyes, but his mouth at least should be visible.
The cage door at the opposite side of the arena rattled again. John, swords still held aloft, turned back to the box where the Emperor sat. He could just make out the shape of Lestrade and the tall, thin silhouette of Mycroft Holmes on either side of him. He smiled reassuringly. He knew Sherlock couldn't see the smile, but if he could read his lover's expression in the way he was holding his body he knew Sherlock's sharp eyes wouldn't miss the sentiment in his.
dangerous bouts at the Circus. And a whole new layer of responsibility, of course, one that John would relish. Sherlock could picture him planning new training exercises in the afternoons while Sherlock read over new suggestions from the senate. Could they have a life together, a proper one, a
He closed his eyes for a moment to better regain his breath, leaning over Sherlock with one hand on his chest, feeling the frantic
He looked up at his lover, sliding his hand up John's thighs to find the beginnings of his loincloth. "John, the entire reason we are in this alley is because no-one will see," he assured him. "You knew that when you pulled me in here."
John grinned. "In front of powerful people?" The silver-haired lanista smirked back and jerked his head in the direction of the stands.
Before he touched it, though, he placed a tiny gentle kiss on the inside of Sherlock's knee where the bottom of the fabric fell; the taller man sighed contentedly. John hooked his fingers under the toga and began to lift it slowly up the Emperor's legs, pressing kisses to each new inch of skin as he revealed it. Sherlock's sighs became more pointed until they developed into a single impatient groan of,
It hurt to sit down.
. But I cannot look him in the eyes and
The big man gave what might have been a shrug, even though his hands were bound. "Sholto was a soldier. A murderer in war."
The Emperor smiled brightly, clapping his hands together again. "Well, then," he said, his voice sharp and clear and delighted in a way that made John smile involuntarily. "We had best do that tonight."
Sherlock blinked at him.
my desire to give you everything you want outweighed my desire to keep you safe, this cannot simply be about you and me."
"I want to do it," John said immediately.
Sherlock blinked. The gladiator watched him, his face carefully blank, but he thought he could almost catch a trace of nerves, of a longing for approval, in those blue-green eyes. He smiled slowly. "Would you
Sherlock didn't let him go, not releasing his fingers or removing his weight from pinning John's stocky body to the column. "I wish you would not," he said softly, kissing his jaw hard enough to turn his head. "I wish there was a way I could give you the excitement of the arena without taking the risk of losing you."
"Well, sir, we ought to get this man to the cages at the Circus," Angelo said abruptly. Lestrade stopped his speculative staring at John in favour of a worried look at Angelo. "I can carry him myself, sir, but if you would keep an eye on him in case he wakes up? I am certain that John can escort his Excellency back to the court."
John was very aware of Sherlock going still beside him. "Could you take us there?"
Angelo had come up to stand behind him, tall and broad and generally imposing. John smiled at him. "What have I got to be nervous about?" he asked, but his heart wasn't in it and he knew it showed.
"But I
Sherlock shrugged easily. "There was no need. John and I had business to take care of, and we were sufficiently distracted to take the route through the forum without thinking."
I can feel your eyes on me, you know. You are not here to watch

The fisherman ducked his head, his hands rising to the ropes holding the canvas sails in place, but he said, "It is likely it will be too late, your Excellency."
And it was startling for him to realise how much he respected – liked –
Watson swallowed nervously. "Very well, my Lord. Lestrade is an exceptionally fair and good-natured man."
Sherlock smiled at him. He'd known that the offer of justice for Mary would tip the scales in his favour, but he hadn't thought it would be quite this certain. He had assumed that Watson would have more care for his dignity and the offer would be more of a battle between his conscience, his loyalty to his wife, and his pride. Apparently pride wasn't so much of an issue.
John reached up to his own hood and pushed it back, smiling. Instantly, the woman's face relaxed, and then she was wrapping John in a welcoming hug. Thin and petite as she was, John emerged from the hug looking as though he were having trouble breathing. Claudia Morstan's red-brown hair – evidently the source of Mary's – had begun to tumble from the tight bun she had scraped it into and fall about her cheeks. She had the look of someone who would in her prime have been both beautiful and kind, and Sherlock found himself relaxing in her presence, as though she were somehow
The older man's eyes landed on Watson and the frown intensified, his eyes narrowing in interest. Evidently Lestrade, too, saw something different about the auctoratus. He let his lips rise into a smirk, and his hand rise into the signal for the trumpeters to start the fight.
Sherlock nodded. "He has nothing to lose. He welcomes the danger." He couldn't stop himself – and wasn't in the habit of trying – from sitting up closer to the edge of the box, peering at the cage on the other side of the arena. "He enjoys the adrenaline."
whether John consented to repeating the incident in the future, and counted that as progress. If the Emperor could not realise how much John had enjoyed himself then he could not be nearly as intelligent as John had credited him with. "As you wish, my Lord."
is that it works because the people involved believe themselves to be equals, personally, no matter their stations." He reached out and smoothed the frown that had formed on Sherlock's face. "It terrifies me for someone in my position to be addressing

behind it. Where did you learn to throw like that?"
Sherlock, though, opened the activity with a stroke of long fingers down John's jaw and a whisper of slightly sour breath: "Do you mind?"
The Emperor held out his hands in an innocent gesture. "Problem?"
Sherlock studied him for a moment. "Would you look at the body?" he asked carefully. "I understand if you would rather not. I can summon a physician. I wish to ascertain which of his wounds caused his death."
was not a word he'd heard describing him before; striking, perhaps, but it wasn't the same thing. He reached up a hand to cup John's jaw, the skin smooth: he'd shaved before coming, then. "May I kiss you?" he asked softly.
Sherlock made an inviting gesture. "Please." John flashed him the grin that always made his stomach wobble and let the fabric fall to his feet, exposing Sherlock's torso and legs.
John smiled absently, staring through the bars of the cage once more. Angelo let him stare for a while; at first John thought he would leave, then the bigger man clamped a hand amiably on his shoulder. "It is important to him that you do this one thing his way," Angelo said quietly. When John looked up at him his face was genuinely concerned. "
Underneath the hood, Sherlock Holmes brought pale fingers to prod tentatively at lush lips. "Interesting," he repeated softly.
"No," John admitted, "but in a fight to the death, there is not much that you can do unfairly. I have been trained as a gladiator, Sherlock, the entire purpose of our profession is to be prepared for the dirty moves of desperate men. In the Circus Maximus, there
Overcome, John climbed back over him to claim those lips. Sherlock gasped into the kiss, his body arching into John's, rubbing their groins together, fabric into flesh. "Oh, you," John whispered into his lips, their mouths forming the same upward curve. "Oh,

"Yes," John agreed, chuckling again in a satisfied manner. "You will."

– but the other man merely shoved him out of the way onto the floor of the boat and made a running leap for the short stretch of open water between the boat and the shore.
John forced himself to snap out of it. "Of course," he replied. "It was… easier to look at under full cover of darkness."
"I take it you are satisfied with your new gladiator?" Mycroft ventured, a smirk toying with the edges of his cruel mouth.
I'm sorry – my visualisation of 'downtown' Romans as having Cockney accents is a long-term thing stemming from too many episodes of Horrible Histories.

Sherlock felt his eyebrows shoot into his hair. That certainly
You do not think we will only do this once in here? The gladiators will not be back for several hours. You and I have been expecting this all morning, to drag it out much longer would be agony. Let go, Sherlock.
Sherlock politely placed his chin on his fist and watched her with an attentive expression. He was surprised at how warmly and
"Him," Sherlock breathed, leaning over the edge of the box, green-grey eyes blazing and fixed on the dimachaerus staring determinedly back up at him. "I want him."
Sherlock lifted a doubtful eyebrow. "I am the Emperor," he told the man again.
John loved the noises Sherlock made. When he had first heard the man speak he had liked the sound of his voice, deep and smooth and now, in this context, unbearably sensual. He smiled around his mouthful, redoubling his efforts to receive more uninhibited groans of his name. When finally he pulled away, working his jaw to relieve the ache, Sherlock stared up at him with wild eyes, his curls a frenzied mess around his head.
Lestrade threw his head back and positively
True to his word, John spent a considerable amount of time considering the Emperor's offer over the course of the day. It wasn't that there were
John chuckled. After a while Sherlock began to relax and the conversation to flow more easily; hours passed without him realising them until John sat up suddenly. "We should leave," he said. "There is training in the morning, it is far later than we intended to be here."
Sherlock nodded after a moment's further evaluation. "He missed everything vital," he confirmed, wincing as John's fingers probed harshly at it. "Leave it, John – you cannot see anything in this light."
He barely had time to register the arm being yanked out of his grip before the man's next punch hit him squarely in the face.
The Emperor looked up at him. "Small splashes of blood," he explained as though it were obvious. "If she was not killed there, then it follows that they must have killed her elsewhere and then carried her to where she was found. That stomach wound must still have been bleeding, therefore when they carried her blood must have dripped. It should be a trail back to the original scene, which with any luck will be far more telling."
It was different because the way in which he owned John now was different.
Holmes stood up at this, crossing slowly to stand in front of him, his eyes wide. "Watson…
John Watson was easy enough to spot; his lack of a shield made him stand out among the others. Anderson, too, he picked straight away, slinking at the back of the group with his large round shield held up around his face.
It was a strange feeling, the warmth flooding his stomach at the knowledge that John wished to prolong their contact for as long as possible. It made him feel oddly vulnerable, and yet he found himself loath to complain. Allowing the smile to show upon his face, Sherlock held John's hand tighter and picked up his pace.
The boy was pointing at a small fishing-vessel a few boats down from where they were standing. "I thought mebbe we should stop afore they see us, your Excellency. You 'specially."
He tried to gently remove the long, probing fingers from his leg, but the Emperor only clutched harder until John had to bark out his name quite sharply to get his attention. "Sherlock!" he cried. "It is quite superficial – merely a flesh wound."
Sherlock Holmes was sitting at the window again when John entered, perched on the edge of the sill with the black hooded cloak from the previous night draped over his knee, his longsword clutched tightly in his hands. He looked as though he, too, had been barely able to wait, and had been sitting in the utmost preparedness for quite some time, fidgeting in anticipation.
He had had to edge inch by inch from underneath the Emperor, who had manoeuvred himself in the night to lie almost entirely on top of John in an endearingly possessive manner; he was surprised, in fact, that his shifting had not woken the man. Sherlock Holmes slept with the air of a man who did not do so often, and whose body therefore compensated by sleeping like the dead in the rare moments that he did choose to succumb. John had smiled to watch him there, his elegant face smoothed with sleep, his body wriggling in the sheets as though attempting to account for the loss of John underneath him.
They stood like this for long minutes, before John could recover himself enough to nod. "Thank you, my Lord," he said briskly. Reluctantly, Sherlock Holmes let go of him and turned back to the only physical evidence that John's wife had existed.
Sherlock jumped at the first touch of the cold cloth; John ever-so-gently wiped the sweat from his face first, before moving on to his torso and right down to his feet. He mustered the strength to sit up just in time to see John neatly and efficiently clean the mess off his stomach and between his legs with a second cloth. He smiled lightly. Somehow being allowed to see the gladiator like

love, and not simply some expectation forced on him by his mother's fancies. Somehow, John was something that Sherlock had been missing all his life without knowing it.
John yawned, stretched, and curled into Sherlock's side, his naked chest warm against him. "Juno, I wish I could stay here forever."
Sherlock smiled at him, looking up to see Lestrade frowning at the boy and beckoning John and his burly sparring partner over. "I would not be so sure," he replied smugly. "I find it helps to have something to
Lestrade smiled at him as he approached, lowering the sword to point harmlessly at the ground. John smiled back.
That wasn't going to work.
"Yes, I know." The lanista paused for a moment before chuckling. "But you will put it to him in a way he cannot refuse, I know you. And I am not sure he will have the strength to say no."
They stood together in the dark for a while, hand in hand. Then Sherlock sighed. "Do you want to look at the docks tonight? It is unlikely that we will find anything."
In a fit of desperation, John jerked his body to the side; the blades of the trident gouged long stripes of blood and muscle through his thigh instead as he dived into a sort of roll to avoid the back-swing of the weapon, stumbling as he attempted to climb back to his feet. His thigh screamed in agony as he cast about desperately for a sword; the Black slave appeared to be snarling in anger, his thick lips curled up over his yellow teeth, eyes dark with fury. John ducked the next swipe, narrowly avoided the slash to his neck from the trident with a backwards lunge and settled a few feet away from his opponent, breathing heavily and keeping his eyes on the slave.
Wisely, the defeated warrior dropped his shield and held up his free hand in the signal for defeat, Watson's blades both pointed at his throat.
" he replied, his eyes pointedly fixing on the proud bulge pushing out his loincloth.
He stilled. "Oh? Who did he recommend?" he asked. Sherlock thought that there was a note of something in his voice – was it trepidation, or jealousy? Did John
His lover smiled for a moment, but his sturdy face quickly fell back into a frown. "And, of course, it would stop me from fighting to the death in the Circus Maximus," he said, studying Sherlock's face closely.
in return.
Slowly, Claudia Morstan sat down. John leaned forwards. "I am here because my friend has been helping me to discover who it was that ended Mary's life," he said, in a soft and even voice that Sherlock envied. If he could speak like that, of
He smiled softly. "I am sure you have realised that your performance in the arena impressed me."
Lestrade smiled sadly. "And he will not intend to hurt you. And yet, it happens. He is a gladiator. Even if everything goes the way you want it to, what will you do when he dies? You cannot protect him from his profession, and he would not wish you to."
He could see the insinuation dawn on Sherlock, and it hurt
could come back alone, so that you would not be recognised."
When he looked up, John was staring at him open-mouthed. "You are incredible," he said softly.
"Oh, Bacchus," he cursed softly. Sherlock nodded ruefully. "Why?"
He let the other man stew for a moment longer. "I can barely believe that this is…" Lestrade tried finally. "I wish to… I want to retire."
To his surprise, it was Lestrade whose hand was on his shoulder as he recovered, smiling sympathetically. He held his breath a moment to ensure his stomach would obey him, then returned the smile weakly. "Where is he?" he asked.
Then the running footsteps grew near enough to be audible, and John's brain began to very slowly kick itself back into gear. Sherlock's scream at his climax presented itself to him from the perspective of the soldiers stationed near his room as the footsteps made a clear beeline for the door; John drew a sharp breath in. "Sherlock –"
Sherlock hummed, a long, low, gravelly noise of contentment, and shifted his head in a manner that somehow wedged his hair even further up John's nose. The urge to sneeze rocketed from uncomfortable to unbearable; John quickly shoved the Emperor's face out of the firing line and succumbed. Sherlock chuckled lowly. "You need a haircut," John teased, running a hand soothingly through the curls.
Terrifically awkward, Sherlock patted her on the back and attempted to disengage the hug. "I am not sure where you get your conviction, Mrs Morstan," he told her softly, "but I have not done much to live up to your predictions."
"But your time in the military gives you experience with, and knowledge of, a wider range of weapons than anyone else in the court," Sherlock countered, crossing his legs and placing his cup of wine back on the tray. "Lestrade believes that the only style of gladiatorial combat you do not have sufficient understanding of is the
had actually
I have you, Sherlock, I have you - I have your arousal in my hand, pressed against my own, and it still baffles me how when I am with you my mood bounces between sentimental and desperate, between how much I love you and how much I want you, like they are one and the same thing. You are an enigma and a storm and I want to spend the rest of my life in the middle of you. Pick me up and never put me down.
He fidgeted nervously on the front doorstep for a moment until John nudged him lightly on the arm. "You do not have to be so nervous," he said softly.
Sherlock began to twitch desperately as he watched John, a hand between each of their legs. "John, please," he said, his voice breaking into yelps of pleasure, "please, you must stop –
John snickered. "Really? I thought it was the way I looked brandishing a sword and covered in sweat and blood," he countered in mock-surprise. Sherlock shrugged judiciously. That certainly had not

John smiled. It
John tried to confirm it, but all that came out was a strangled squeak.
John grinned at the man pinned beneath the gaze of his swords before casting the weapons aside and helping him up. The taller, younger man smiled back at him, accepting the hand and climbing fluidly to his feet; he clapped John on the back in a friendly manner as they walked away, laughing raucously to each other about the various wrong moves each had made in the early-morning training. It was difficult to focus one's mind so soon after rising from sleep, especially if the night had been as interesting as John's.
, and yet Sherlock believed it when John said it.
He nodded sharply. "Dimmock." His dark eyes - a shade lighter than Dimmock's, which somehow made them volumes warmer - slid slowly over John's body before resting on his face. "John Watson, is it not?"
The dimachaerus had sat down at the rickety kitchen table, so Sherlock sat beside him and was slightly surprised when John reached for his hand again beneath its surface, where Claudia couldn't see. He squeezed it as John took a deep breath. "I loved Mary very much," he said quietly. Claudia's face softened. "I was lost when she died. I could think of nothing else to do – and I do honestly believe that it was the right decision."
"Would you… mind if I… I mean, would you like me to stay?" the older man asked hesitantly, folding the black cloak nervously before replacing it on the trunk.
"Do you know what his occupation was, Lestrade?" he asked briskly.
Carefully, after an age of this, John slid a second slick finger alongside the first, coaxing a slight discomforted groan from his younger lover that eased into more pleasurable sounds as he grew used to the sensations and began to relax into them.
The man's lips were soft and pliant; they bent and curved under the gentle touch of Sherlock's own as he carefully opened and closed his mouth, one hand holding his jaw steady while the other remained gently on his hip, urging their lower halves close. He could feel his heartbeat running away with him, feel the animal impulse to push harder all at once, but he ignored the itch. Had he wanted a rough, animalistic rut, he would have requested a prostitute. He wanted to take
Thankfully, the younger man nodded, and John gripped himself steadily and sank into him.
Should he not take this chance to show Sherlock the same strange, shuddering pleasure?
"Please, Mrs Morstan," Sherlock said, panicking slightly. He had known she would react similarly to this, but he didn't want her to think that she

"Sherlock," he said softly, stepping forwards helplessly and reaching out a hand. "Your

Sherlock smiled coyly. "You could always hand it to me and I could take it back myself."
him the way he wanted him to, but there wasn't one, so he squeezed John until his arms ached and thought from the way John was squeezing him back that perhaps it was enough.
"I am not that short, my Lord," John retaliated, barely thinking. The Emperor let out a delighted chuckle.
For a heartbeat Sherlock did not answer. Then he said slowly, "Was it… pleasurable? For you?"
, and John was right to need to protect him. But Sherlock could not understand what his hulking opponent made him feel, how badly he needed to
The cages at the other end of the arena rattled and John caught a glimpse of a hulking figure waiting, its head bowed. He placed a reverent kiss to the blue flower on the handkerchief, and then dropped it in the sand beside him and drew his swords, thrusting them into the air amidst the cheers.
"So Bartholomew Sholto knew Mary's father," he continued as John caught up, flicking his eyes quickly to the side to acknowledge him.
Sherlock smirked. "I have never been most people," he commented. "It is what I want. Why should I bother skirting around it for useless hours?" Watson smiled slightly, but Sherlock could still tell he wasn't about to say yes. That was fine; he would have been disappointed if the man had given in so easily. "I would explain precisely what I require before you answer, Watson, and what I am willing to offer in return."
He shook his head slightly, his lips pressed so tightly together that it hurt. "No, my Lord, I can manage," he said, after clearing his throat. "Yes, that is where…"
They had left Tonga's hands bound together with thin rope; John had been there when Sherlock had impressed upon the men guarding him that he was dangerous and not to take any chances. He appreciated the Emperor's unwillingness to let the guards get hurt – and did not doubt that Tonga would have hurt them – but how did Sherlock expect him to execute the man with his hands tied? The Saturnalia games were meant to be a spectacle. The murder of a man who didn't even have the use of his hands was not entertainment.
Sherlock frowned mightily. "Can we drop our sails, then?" he asked.
"Perhaps not. We shall see." He cast an identical cloak around his own shoulders, settling the hood across the back and clasping it shut over the pale dip in his collarbone. Completely lost, John did the same. "And will the dagger you carry be enough for you, should you need to defend yourself? I can offer you a sword if you need it." The curly-haired nobleman supplemented this point by affixing a longsword underneath the cloak and eyeing John's nether regions.
"Sholto," the woman replied without hesitation. "Bartholomew Sholto."
It felt like preparing him took forever, Sherlock's whole body thrumming with impatience, but he kept the agonizingly slow pace because John's own fingers were clutching at his arm with the same rhythm and his eyelids were fluttering and he looked so
after a public bout. He had known of his brother's attraction to the lanista when he was barely a man, but he had thought that the fire of lust had largely died out over the many years of denial. "Oh," he said simply. Lestrade nodded. "And that is what you want?"

Sherlock chuckled, cupping John's face in one hand and pressing a goodnight kiss to his forehead. "
suggested it was something that John
"You do not have to do it yourself," Sherlock said, but he already knew that John would not step aside and let someone else do it, and sure enough John was already shaking his head. "I am sorry," he told him quietly. "But this is the best I can do."
win it, he was easily the best gladiator in the arena – he would apologise properly and everything would be all right. He bowed, the customary gesture, and then they took their positions to begin the fight.
"Like this," he said to the lanista, placing joined hands over Small's chest. "You must squeeze the water out of his lungs, force it back up his throat so that he can breathe again."
John frowned mightily. "He had injured his foot?" he began, flashing a wry grin in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "All right," he continued. "It is a big footprint, so… a large man? Flat-footed, I would say."
John's hand on his toga tightened. "Take us there," Sherlock said abruptly, patting the boy gently on the back once they were level with him. "You have done excellently."
Tonga grinned horribly. They rested for a moment, John courteously allowing his opponent a moment to put the stinging pain of the cut out of his mind. He casually swung his blade around behind him so that Tonga could not see it and flexed his wrist. When the bigger man lunged, he flicked the sword out and slapped his thigh with the flat, twisting it as he drew away and leaving another long, shallow cut across his dark calf. Tonga growled, but the pain had made him hesitate slightly in his lunge for John's neck and John moved his head out of the firing line and blocked the sweep easily.
John laughed as his own eyes made the journey to the admittedly impressive appendage. "Not
Sherlock smirked around John's length, which he had taken into his mouth without warning. He had not intended the dimachaerus to fall silent, however, and so he quirked an eyebrow at him teasingly. John groaned again, but after another moment of acclimatising to the sensation, his mouth opened to another torrent of praise that made Sherlock's stomach flop and his groin ache.
John pulled him into a tight hug. Sherlock clutched as his back, blinking tears away from his eyes. "I am all right," the gladiator murmured into his ear. "It is over now, everything is all right."

of John, and to have John take care of him. All the same, it was difficult to ignore the rush of blood to his extremities.
John looked at Sherlock – had the old woman recognised him? But he only caught the merest glimpse of the puzzled slant of Sherlock's mouth and chin before he ducked his head back out of view. "I am sorry, my dear woman," Sherlock rumbled after a moment, his voice fluid and deep and soothing. "Would you happen to know whether the gentleman who lives here is in?"
Then someone managed to lock John's left hand in a tight parry, pushing a short blade away from his face with his own sword, straining to keep a hold on it. So distracted, John could mount only half a defence when he felt the point of the trident sidle into his grip on the sword in his right hand, and then he was defenceless.
After that, Sherlock had to let him go.
"Her name is Hudson, your Excellency. She is waiting outside the arena – she said that you would recognise her."
magnanimous," he complimented dryly. "It is no wonder you are Emperor. I cannot imagine your brother being so gracious in bed."
he whispered, smiling gently, the tiny scratch of stubble from where he had not shaved that morning rubbing against Sherlock's jaw.
Mycroft's lips curved cruelly, obviously sensing the direction his brother's thoughts were taking and the need to move them away. "Brains to go with the muscles, do you think?"
Sherlock stretched indolently. "I am fine," he shouted back, turning his head towards the door so as not to shout in John's ear. "I apologise for disturbing you. Go back to your posts."
The gladiator's breath stuttered. "Liar," he replied, his voice slightly shaky. "It is the neglected genitalia of an old fighter."

you –"
Sherlock glanced at John; the gladiator wore a pained expression. So he reached back and knocked the hood back onto his shoulders.
Sherlock shook his hand off mock-irritatedly. "Yes, all right," he dismissed, unable to keep the smile off his face. "You may be slightly biased."
John took his hand and yanked him into his former bedchamber, pressing him up against the bars of the cage and kissing him. "Would you want me in gladiatorial dress,
Sherlock shifted impatiently. "Nor will you," he assured him, his voice cold.
will fight fairly?" he asked.
"The Emperor's lanista is a man named Lestrade," the small man told him, neatly and efficiently wrapping John's sword in linen for the walk. "He will accompany you there and show you where you will sleep." His dark eyes shot up to meet John's. "Do not think you will enjoy better living conditions there, Watson," he said sharply. "Lestrade has been at the Emperor's court for almost twenty years. He does not believe in soft treatment."
The gladiator clapped him on the shoulder. "Can you walk?" he asked.
The kiss was unhurried, their breath mingling along with their tongues. Sherlock tasted of sweetened wine until John's tongue had carefully laved the traces away, replacing them with the heady combination of each of their own tastes. When he began to rock his hips forward with experimental precision, Sherlock made a lazy contented noise and copied the gesture.
The lanista nodded, stepping back. "Of course, my Lord."
– are you certain you cannot remember the names of the other two, John?"
to take care of my own life."
Tonga's snarl flattened somewhat into a grotesque smile. "I make him very angry."
Sherlock cast his eyes back to Lestrade, whose dark eyes were flickering quickly between the arenarii below, a critical frown on his face. He'd always thought his lanista was strangely attractive, handsome in a rough, masculine sort of way. Or maybe it was simply the way he wielded a sword; Sherlock had always known he had strange tastes. Another reason, guiltily, that he watched the gladiators with such fervour. Or perhaps it was simply familiarity and admiration: Lestrade had been a part of the court – first as a gladiator himself, and then as the court lanista – for as long as he could remember, and as a child he had been fascinated by him.
The elder Holmes' right eyebrow twitched. Sherlock knew his brother had something of a soft spot for the lanista. He'd always been jealous through Sherlock's childhood when he'd happened upon the young gladiator kneeling behind his brother to correct his stance or his grip. Sherlock had always thought it was quite pathetic; back then he'd thought he would be Emperor. If he'd wanted the older man, he could have spoken a few words and had him. Now, though, he was starting to understand his hesitation.
The barbarian spat at his feet. "I have done nothing I have cause to be ashamed of," he said in sullen, broken Greek.
Sherlock couldn't help but glance at John, whose smile hadn't faltered. "Could you find Lestrade, please, Angelo, and inform him of our intentions?"
"Before last night, had anyone ever told you that you were beautiful?" he asked, his voice soft.
Quintus frowned at him. "It is likely they will fade before long as sand from the streets clogged the wound, my Lord," he explained. "But for a way, at least, he should be able to lead you." He took the rope from Lestrade and fondled Cerberus' drooping black ears, the stern exterior flickering minutely into fondness. "Cerberus," he murmured to the hulking animal, and pointed firmly at the first bloody print. "Seek."
He nodded, still averting his eyes as a lump grew in his throat. "More than my own life."
John's eyes hit the floor sheepishly. "I… had assumed you simply meant to re-open the investigation amongst the townspeople. Perhaps announce to the city that you had taken an interest in the matter to encourage anyone who may have information to come forwards. I did not think…"
Sherlock nodded agreement. "Extremely so. And wide-footed, as well – look at the placement of the toes, spread much further apart than my own." To illustrate, he placed his sandal-clad foot beside the print and wriggled his toes. "This is the foot of a barbarian," he concluded.
He made to turn away, but John reached up and caught the curve of his jaw in his fingers, and Sherlock could barely move with the gladiator's hands on his skin more than turning back in the direction they were guiding him. When he was once more facing his shorter counterpart, John's hand reached up to knock the hood back from his face again. "I am more upset with you hiding now than I could ever be with you kissing me," he said quietly, his fingers toying with a stray lock of hair over Sherlock's forehead.
Sherlock smiled at him; surprisingly, his eyes had dropped - almost as if he were reluctant to stop their conversation. He felt a thrill of anticipation.
"Not at all," he replied. "Wiggins?"
Looking around, John realised that Holmes in his running had led them right back to the court. Distantly, he felt his heart sinking; he was not ready for the night to be over. "When… when may I begin fulfilling my end of our agreement, my Lord?" he asked tentatively.
that John returned his feelings, that John would never leave him, that he could have this forever if he wanted it.
Eventually Sherlock pulled away from the soft noises and warmth of the kiss. "Would you - do you - may I touch you? I will not last much longer, and if you are not uncomfortable I would like to see you finish. Unless you do not - mmph!"
Within minutes, John's gold-tanned body was gleaming with sweat and Sherlock was trying not to watch him dart back and forth, jabbing his sword at his large opponent's body but always stopping just short of injuring the other man, twisting acrobatically out of the way of similarly-controlled blows from the gladiator.
It hardly took moments before the lanky body folded undignifiedly into the sand, the spray of red decorating the leather undergarments of the men on either side. Lestrade tutted as the crowd erupted into cheers. "About bloody time," he growled. Sherlock chuckled.
"I would try not to mention that to him, my Lord," Lestrade advised. Sherlock gave him another half-smile. "Personally I do not think either of you stand a chance."
After a moment, though, he pulled his mouth away and rolled them over until he could carefully disentangle himself from John and with his usual unfathomable elegance step away from the bed, breathing heavily.
The lanista looked at him for a moment; Sherlock kept his eyes resolutely on the gladiators, trying to keep his expression neutral. Once again, though, the silver-haired man was not stupid.
Sherlock melted. He was barely aware of his knees buckling until the hand at his waist tightened and John quickly changed his stance to support both their weights; as the other man's mouth started to leave his he tried to chase it back before he quite registered the position he was in. John calmly propped him back on his feet. "Are you all right, my - Sherlock?"
After a few minutes of this – turning around as quickly as he could while still making sure he had eyes on everyone making calculated dives towards him – he had eliminated a few of his attackers and the others had begun to attack each other as well as him, taking advantage of their distraction and proximity to flick the weapons out of each other's hands.
I am good at it."
Sherlock had stood up; he could see the figure in his peripheral vision, his dark curls bobbing as he shouted furiously at someone John couldn't see.
For never having done it before, John's mouth was unfairly talented; Sherlock could do nothing but grasp handfuls of his sheets and John's hair and scrabble against his shoulders until one sword-calloused hand came up to grasp his fingers and prise them away from his neck. John's lips tightened around Sherlock's arousal and he thought he might actually be seeing a fond smile stretching out his mouth. Giving up the plot entirely, Sherlock let his head hit the pillow and his eyes close and the sensation of John's tongue flicking against his tip overwhelm him.
was completely at ease around him, but as she spoke of her loneliness and the sweetness of her eldest child her eyes flickered to Sherlock every now and again and she smiled warmly. When she started in on how worried she had been for John's safety – and his sanity, she added with a slightly stern look – the gladiator reached out for Sherlock's hand again.

trust you, John."
Sherlock hadn't wanted him to do this. If Tonga defeated him how would it look for him? And what would he think of John?
"John, if you could train the others to fight even a little more like you, the court arena would become a far more interesting place," he finished firmly.
made us for each other."
Sherlock Holmes smiled. "No matter. You will need a garment with a hood, in any case. Here," he said brightly, bending to muddle through a trunk of outer clothing at the foot of the enormous bed. Smiling as he straightened, Holmes held out a thick black outdoor cloak to him. "It may drag on the ground a little, but it will cover the thickness of your shoulders compared to mine."
So the older man shed his clothes until he was clad only in his loincloth and sat cross-legged on the bed, waiting patiently while Sherlock relieved his bladder and splashed the cold water from the basin over his face. He noticed that the other man did not avert his eyes while his Emperor disrobed, and wondered suddenly whether John expected to undergo some form of sexual activity. He had simply expected to repeat the exercise of the night before in falling asleep with his head on the gladiator's shoulder and his long legs tangled with shorter ones, but stripping to his loincloth with those steady eyes on him caused a flicker of desire to spark in his gut.
that he realised he was no longer simply holding the other man's hand to ensure they were not separated.
He grinned, slightly stunned. "Thank you." His own hand covered John's, feeling the callouses worn by the twin swords, rough against the smooth skin of his chest. He pulled them closer together and kissed him again. John tasted of seeds and oil and the warmth of a fire in a grate, and Sherlock delved deeper, immersing himself in it.
Hearing his name in that rough voice spirited a grin onto Sherlock's own face; he wanted, more than anything, to hear it gasped or cried between sheets in a moment of passion. But he couldn't allow himself to think that would happen. John agreeing to this higher level of intimacy did not equate to John desiring him sexually. "Come here," he requested anyway, turning in the window-seat to properly face the gladiator as he approached until he was looking up as John stood before him.

The children eyed John warily, but eventually chorused,

Sherlock kissed him again. "I wish for you to want to stay as long as possible," he explained, stroking a finger across the gladiator's cheekbone, down his chin, through the dip of his collarbone. "I am afraid that if I do something to make you uncomfortable you will leave."
Personally, John doubted that he would be any less intimidated when the moment came. He allowed himself another brief glance towards the man; now that he knew he was there, he was impossible to miss, the purple and white of his toga stark against the grey stone of the stands. It was enormously distracting.

we are equals."
Mycroft opened his mouth to reply, but whatever rebuttal he came up with was drowned by the horns surrounding the box, and the swell of the cheers from the stands, so loud it was almost a visible wave of sound. Mycroft grimaced. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"She certainly had impeccable taste," Sherlock remarked, wondering if talking about Mary was really a good idea and how he might draw the conversation elsewhere. Or stop it completely in favour of more non-verbal pursuits. "Take it from me."
"Oh," the man who had called out grunted to his companion. "It is only some rich pig and his whore."
was not a murderer," he persisted.
Someone had evidently announced him, because the arena had erupted into noise that very clearly split into male and female, a solid wave of noise that threatened to knock him off his feet. A cotton handkerchief floated from the sands and landed on his sandal; it caught when John lifted his foot to shrug it off and he had to bend and tug it free. It had been embroidered with a blue flower in one corner – John knew nothing of flowers, but it looked similar to the ones Mary had used to pick and put in pots around the house. There had been one beside the bed the day she had miscarried their child.
, my Lord," he replied, standing up with an exaggerated creaking of bones. "But I do not think that I will try. I happen to adore every recalcitrant, obnoxious bone in his body just as it is."
They were sitting close to the arena today – as it was training only, the two of them and a young slave sitting cross-legged behind them with a jug of wine were the only spectators. Sherlock liked to sit closer, to be on a level with the gladiators. When was smaller and Lestrade had been painstakingly teaching him how to handle a sword, Sherlock had occasionally fancied that one day when Mycroft was Emperor he would run away from the court and volunteer as a gladiator. He had grown up knowing that he would not survive in the Circus Maximus, but the dreams of glory in battle had remained with him. In his early teens he had watched his father sentence a group of rogue sailors to death for pirating and briefly entertained the idea of defecting to the seas after the leader of their band, dressed in gaudy fabrics Sherlock had never seen anything like, had bent his head to him and winked. Sherlock had recounted his image of life as a pirate to a chuckling Lestrade, who had patiently listened until the point when he had speculated that the man's clothing had come from beyond the borders of the Known World.
only looked down at John and exhaled shakily, his hands trembling as they clutched at each other. John grinned cheekily at him as though to illustrate that he had no desire to speed up, certain that Sherlock would protest at the gesture.
, naked and unabashed without even the expectation of sex, was perhaps more intimate than what they had just done. Though not quite as satisfying or pleasurable.
John nodded. "Her brother and I. We came looking for her – we were on our way to the square."
Sherlock reached out and caught the arm of the first man to attempt a punch. "John, you cannot –"
everyone would like him. "If it is too much to remember, we will drop the subject. But we believe you may be able to help."
John replied, already withdrawing for another solid thrust. Sherlock cried out as he made it, his fingers twisting desperately against the fabric binding his wrists together. John gave him no time to recover before thrusting again, setting up a firm, fast motion that Sherlock struggled to match, hooking his legs around John's waist and crying out loudly –
"Yes, my Lord," John confirmed quietly, attempting to hold back the automatic movement of his right hand to rub the mesh of scar-tissue. "At Ctesiphon."
The man pulled back his sheets and pummelled his pillow briefly, readying the bed for him like a servant might. Sherlock frowned at him, but climbed into the space he had made nonetheless, patting the pillow beside him. "Lie with me," he ordered softly.
Sherlock considered the idea, surprised. "John?" he repeated. Lestrade looked at him steadily. "I see where you are coming from. He fights like no-one I have ever seen, it was what caught my eye about him. But… he is the newest gladiator to the arena."
John grabbed his hair and pulled it until Sherlock, panting, surprised at the reaction in his loincloth to the gladiator forcing him, was face to face with his auctoratus in order to press their lips together again. "Please, Sherlock," he whispered against his lips. "Just do it. I will survive."
Sherlock smiled at him. "We shall see when we get to Sholto's house whether he will be necessary," he replied. "If not, Quintus here will remove him for us."
"Lestrade," Dimmock grated out through tightly-clenched teeth. John couldn't help the smile etching itself across his face at the lanista's discomfort; if his wide grin was anything to go by, neither could Lestrade.
Sherlock nodded sharply. In the Circus Maximus the fights were not nearly as frequent as they were in his court, but the audiences were bigger and they expected blood, not skill. Sherlock tried to avoid death and serious injury in his court bouts. He understood Lestrade's hesitation to throw a man trained for the Circus into one of their more civilised fights, although he doubted that Watson would have trouble adjusting. "But you prefer this style, do you not? The chance to fight people who understand the mechanics of it as well as you do, rather than people who have been thrust into it like lambs for sacrifice?"
The fisherman gaped at him for a moment. Then, "Yes, your Excellency," he stuttered, dashing for the mooring line. John dropped quickly to one oar and Angelo followed suit; at the
John was half-hard, and that in itself made Sherlock thrill with joy:

It did not take long for him to grow impatient with kissing, though; soon enough Sherlock twisted his body violently, almost throwing John off him with a bark of, "Enough!"
The older gladiator gently disentangled himself from the hug in order to frown at him. "I do not think that we should mind them," he said slowly.

alluring that John could barely have stopped himself sliding down his lover's body and hooking his fingers into his loincloth.
"May I?" he asked, raising an eyebrow at Lestrade. Close to, his voice was a low, pleasant rumble that made something in John's chest spread warmth right down to his fingertips.
The elder Holmes made a gesture of impatience. "As a consulate motion, I doubt it has any other option. Minerva forbid you be tasked with the actual
When the boat bumped the side of the dock John jumped from it immediately, leaving Sherlock and the fisherman to affix the mooring line. Lestrade was knelt on the wooden floor of the dock, Small's prostrate, dripping body splayed out before him. Clearly at a loss for what to do, he was administering small slaps to his inert cheeks. John dropped to his own knees beside the man who murdered his wife.
The Emperor whimpered slightly and folded him into his long arms, clutching him close and making his leg scream in pain. "Ouch," he said quietly into Sherlock's neck, and the taller man let go immediately. John snorted and shifted so he was almost sitting in the Emperor's lap, his injured leg stretched out in front of him and one hand resting on Sherlock's chest as the younger man wrapped protective arms around him and placed comforting kisses over his neck. "Thank you."
He had drawn breath to reply when the bars of the gate clattered against the wall; John looked up to see a stocky, silvery-haired man wincing at the noise as he leaned against the gate. When he realised he'd been noticed, he caught the lanista's eyes and smiled tightly. John glanced at Dimmock to see him return the expression. It was easy to tell the two men were not friends.
, I love you. I am sorry it has taken me so long to realise it."
The previous night Sherlock had been completely in control the whole time, guiding John and cradling him and taking care of him. That bore almost no resemblance to this, to John's warm hand resting on his side as a warning not to move, to this
look. John frowned at him. "Why would someone attempt to murder me?"
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow at them. "He has very clear anatomical knowledge." The bigger gladiator jerked forwards in a sharp feint, laughing easily and throwing what was clearly another jibe at the shorter man which Watson ignored, legs set in readiness. Sherlock crossed his legs to hide his arousal, not looking back to see whether Mycroft had noticed the gesture. "There are few occupations which afford such education; it would be all the more remarkable if a physician had chosen to –"
The stocky warrior pouted. "You could have sent them away for longer, Sherlock," he said pettily. Sherlock lifted an eyebrow at him; John snorted and shook his head. "Perhaps I share your fantasy," he admitted, looking up at Sherlock through lowered lashes. "I must admit the idea of taking pristine, perfect
Tonga lunged for him. John sidestepped the thrust as easily as he would avoid a charging bull. The crowd was cheering again; he registered this as though it was happening to someone else. The lunge had been clumsy, and he knew that his opponent was not a clumsy fighter. He stood still, trying to look calm and careless rather than exceedingly watchful and wary.
"That depends on how ridiculously stupid you insist on being this afternoon," he retorted. The lanista laughed.
. After everything you have already done, I hardly think it will take long."
Your mouth never stops moving even when I am inside it; your tongue strokes the base of my erection and your mouth shifts, sliding up and down the length of me, firm and hot and fast and I cannot – Sherlock, please, I cannot hold on, I need – your fingers slide from my hip down between my legs, into the crease of my rear, and the added sensation pushes me over. I shout but I do not know if it has words, bent over, clutching desperately at your hair until it surely must hurt you, watching as your eyes slide closed and your throat works to swallow my essence, taking a part of me inside of you forever.
After a glance at Sherlock, John grabbed the coil of rope from the bottom of their own boat and carefully stepped with it from boat to boat where Angelo was still holding them together.
The arenarius gave a soft sigh as he allowed Sherlock's tongue between his lips, relaxing against his Emperor and letting a huff of breath out of his nose. Sherlock tightened his arms around John's waist as his toga slid down his torso and onto the floor. John's tongue fluttered against his, not resisting the kiss, but not really participating.
that he had experienced had shocked him. He had lain in the Emperor's enormous bed long after the younger man's breathing had evened into sleep against his chest, pondering the way that deep, charismatic voice groaning his name into his ear had made the hair on his arms stand up, the way his heart had twinged when a simple kiss had caused the ruler's knees to give out.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Unorthodox," he repeated slowly.
Angelo occupied the cell beside the one that had been John's; he grinned as the two of them approached. "Pleasure to see you here, my Lord," he greeted cheerfully. "And you, John – the amount we see you, it is as if you no longer keep quarters here."
him, not simply execute him.
The lanista looked up from where he was seated on the bottom tier of the stands. The two gladiators lazily stepping around each other paused and nodded to Sherlock as he entered the arena to sit beside the older man. "Your Excellency," Lestrade replied, raising a hand in a lazy salute.
John's hand nudged pointedly against his wrist. "Look, my Lord, it is one of your street children."
"Right now, I just want to see what you can do," the lanista said once he had reached hearing distance. "Many of the fights in this arena are not intended to kill, but merely to show your style and prowess in front of some very powerful people. Today I want you to experience that without so much pressure."
"Yes," Sherlock replied, not sure what he would do once he got there. He would have to explain to Mycroft why he had left the arena, and he would know exactly why Sherlock's lower lip would not stop trembling.
The Emperor chuckled languidly. "Of course," he replied easily. "I have thought about it. This way, I must trust that you will take care of me, and you must trust that I would not have you punished for what you might do to me."
Sherlock thought back. "Watson," he mused. "
"Mrs Hudson?"
Lying in Sherlock's arms –
watch the residence of Claudia Morstan, and her son Arrian. If John is in danger, it is likely they will be."
He tried not to doubt it, tried to keep his face neutral and his mouth shut, but confusion won out quickly. "Where are we going, my Lord, that I may need more than a dagger to protect myself?"
After he and John Watson got back the night before he hadn't even tried to sleep; pacing fitfully around his bedchamber seemed far more productive. How could he be expected to lie still and think calm thoughts when
," Sherlock choked helplessly. John slowly let go of the bar above the bed, letting himself down until his head fitted neatly into Sherlock's neck.
He kissed there. "
Then Sherlock turned his head back and shifted his body timidly underneath John's. "Would you take me?" he asked. "As I took you on our first night?"
," he cursed quietly. "Your mind works so
"Small," Claudia replied with a tiny smile. "I remember finding it amusing because he was a very tall, broad man. Jonathan Small."
The Emperor shrugged. "Exactly. Come along, Watson, or we shall leave the night behind us entirely and have got nowhere."
But Sherlock smiled delightedly, placed the rope in John's outstretched hands and climbed back onto the bed, putting his own hands together at the wrist and resting them against the wooden bar that held the bed against the wall. He looked up, his eyes bright and expectant.
And that,
know," he replied, his deep voice nothing more than a growl. "It was
the knowing sneer directed towards him from his brother's direction and it rankled slightly; why should Mycroft look at him like that when he had no idea what Sherlock had done and why he had done it?
Immediately, his target lunged forward and dealt him a ringing blow to the side of the head. John staggered, shaking his head to clear it of the sound and the fuzz of disorientation, but the hulking black fighter was already gone, leaping past him onto the other boat; Sherlock took a step towards him and John cried out to him – he was unarmed, he had no chance whatsoever and John
Sherlock snorted. "It certainly was that." He supposed that if he ignored his overwhelming panicked response from the fighter lunging for John's throat, the chase had been exciting, invigorating. If he could do that sort of thing again with John at his side – but perhaps with a criminal less personal to the both of them, one that would allow them to relax enough to enjoy the adrenaline – he would be more than content. "You were not hurt, John, were you, when he ran at you?"
possible for two people as different as Mycroft and I to have a true relationship." Lestrade shrugged, beaming. "Apparently he thought the same thing."
even more extraordinary. Mary's and my love was something that we made ourselves, but I feel as though you and I were
"Can you do that?" John asked. "I always find my mind filled with things that are not important and yet that I am unable to recall the important things."
When he parted his lips against the unforgiving angle of the taller man's cheekbone and lightly swept his tongue against the skin there, Sherlock's hands on his toga pulled him down without opening his eyes and blindly mashed their lips together.
kind of detail. "And he worked out the thing that I wanted most and offered it to me in return, so that I could not refuse him."
"Oh, dear," the elder lilted, turning the tablet he was looking at over idly in his hands. "You really are besotted."
Sherlock snorted disgustedly. "I cannot imagine why," he said dryly. "And yet despite everything that you have done, he still does not wish to face you unarmed. He wants a fair fight."
The taller man did not breathe until John was fully within him, and it was his frantic exhale that made John remember that he had not breathed either. Sherlock gripped him tighter than he had ever felt before, and he had to close his hands on either side of Sherlock's tied ones until his knuckles went white to regain a semblance of control.
The woman pursed cracked lips. "He en't," she said finally. "He en't been in for days. Just sorta vanished, like. Never done that before, neither. He en't the disappearing type."
Rowing hard enough to pull both boats through the water was not easy, but John felt as though he could achieve almost anything; he rowed as fast and hard as he could. The one-legged body that Lestrade eventually fished from the water looked decidedly unconscious, and John wanted Small to at least see his face one more time before he died.
Sherlock had to work to keep himself from crowing with delight. "So where is it now?" he asked.
, had told him so many times that he
John made a faint noise as they rounded on him; they had assumed, most likely from the stronger, bolder set of John's shoulders and the masculine curve of his jaw that
"Is there enough rope to bind this man to the mast?" Angelo asked. "Then I can help John to row."
Sherlock's voice was calm, and yet it rang across the dockyard with so much authority John's knees twinged with the schooled urge to buckle and prostrate himself. Small's face contracted as though they had plunged a torch into his backside. He stared, apparently dumbstruck, from Sherlock to John and back again.
Sherlock paused, frowning at the cripple struggling to stay afloat. "No," he said finally. "Lestrade will have finished training by now. Mrs Hudson will doubtless fill him in and he will join us here with the city's lawkeepers – they can retrieve Small from the water before he drowns, I am sure. Our priority should be his rather violent companion."
had enough; much more and the vivid pleasure spiking quite obviously through Sherlock's slim body would turn agonisingly painful. "As you say," he murmured instead, drawing his hands through the last of the oil half-absorbed into Sherlock's chest and applying it gingerly to his prick, biting his tongue as hard as he could to hold back the pleasure.
The Emperor gave him a wry smile, and then stepped boldly out from behind the boat that had hidden them from Small's view and snapped the heels of his sandals together in front of the slightly larger fishing vessel the two had commandeered. John wondered whether it was Small's, or whether they had stolen it.
Secretly, of course, he had to agree. Watson's sudden grin in the pit after Sherlock had complimented him had completely and utterly disarmed him. It had taken him a moment to recover.
to do. He'd been so careful to keep the gladiator informed of what he wanted from their 'relationship', and this wasn't the first 'out' he'd offered him. John had turned down the others this quickly, too. In a weaker man, it could perhaps have been dismissed as fear of displeasing the Emperor, but John Watson was not weak.
