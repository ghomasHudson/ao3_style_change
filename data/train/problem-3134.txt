Dean strides quickly to the door and shoulders past Castiel, clearly intent on leaving without saying another word, but Castiel stops him with a hand, a look.
It’s sadly true-- Sam had managed to find probably the only girl in the world who doesn’t have to stand on her tiptoes to kiss him, and Dean thinks he should propose on that basis alone. It also helps that she’s unbelievably smart, hilarious, and best of all: two months ago, Sam had told her everything about their life,
David can feel himself shaking, but he forces himself to look into Charlie’s sweet brown eyes. A lock of grey-streaked red hair falls into her eyes and she tucks it away, smiling softly at him.
“Well, now you’re just sweet-talking me,” Alastair grins. “Come on, Dean, let’s see what we can do with little Castiel here...”
He calms down once he finds the note written on the cracker wrapper: “TALKING TO DAD. BE BACK SOON.” Not demons. Not bears, or drowning. He won’t lose Dean to nature or evil. It remains to be seen whether he’ll lose him to his own father.
” His breathing is coming faster and Garth is hurrying him to the bathroom, where he collapses in front of the toilet and empties his stomach. He’s aware that there are tears streaming down his face, and he doesn’t try to stop him when Garth gently wipes his mouth and takes him up to his room and tucks him into bed, saying, “I know, it’s a shock, I’ve seen this happen to a lot of kids, don’t worry about it, just get some rest, David,” He shuts off the light, and murmurs, as he closes the door, “Good night, Castiel,” and when he says that, despite that terror and horror and shame and betrayal he feels, something lights up inside him and he falls asleep feeling very, very different.
“Dean,” Castiel says. “Being human is exhausting. It’s dirty, and it hurts, and I’ve got scars now that I can never make smooth. I’m terrified every day that if I make one wrong move, I’ll wind up dead and none of it will have mattered anyway.”
The rest of the year leading up to David’s eighteenth birthday is slow but anything but boring. He’s constantly tagging along on hunts with Aaron, Ben, and Claire, and he even goes on one with Krissy and Aiden. They all comment on his prowess and how far he’s come, and they even start referring to him as a member of their team. David glows basking in their attentions; he should have known it was too good to last.
This is supposed to feel normal. This is supposed to be what he does best. Why does it feel like he’s pretending to be somebody different?
“Just leave him alone, you black-eyed bastard. I’m coming. You’ll get what you want. Just leave Jude alone.”
“No, don’t stop,” Castiel gasps again, rocking his hips down onto Dean’s finger. “Keep going. It’ll get better.”
“Hey,” Claire says. “Don’t. I know you’re about to apologize for my dad, but don’t. Don’t. It’s... it’s okay.”
“That’s the last box,” Sam says, shoving it into the backseat and slamming the door shut before anything has the opportunity to fall out.
Melissa isn’t like the girls Dean usually sees Sam with. She’s tall, almost as tall as him, and she has long, blonde hair and a wide, brilliant smile. Dean is struck by the intense feeling of deja vu when he sees Sam look at her-- he remembers a night so many years ago, when he was twenty-six and scared, being introduced to a girl Sam had truly loved, seeing that same expression on his little brother’s face.
“Bye-bye, Dean,” June says mournfully, face blotted and red. Dean had already hugged and kissed her thoroughly inside, but she’d cried the whole time.
“So, that’s it, then?” he asks tiredly, and Dean nods. John straightens and fixes Castiel with a look. “Well, you did okay, Dean. He did good today.”
“Inias, Ingrid,” the woman calls, and suddenly the angels are at their side, holding Sam and Dean back.
Castiel doesn’t know whether to kiss Dean or punch him very hard in the shoulder. He settles for the latter.
Castiel doesn’t realize how close he is to telling Dean he doesn’t pay much attention to rumors until his mouth is open and the words are on his tongue. He quickly snaps his mouth closed.
Garth takes Kevin by the upper arm and leads him out of the kitchen-- “Ow! Ow, lemme go, old man!” “Kevin Tran, I known you for a long time but I will not hesitate to smack you!”-- leaving David at the table, mostly confused but intrigued, the name
“I’m not gonna lie, Cas, I’m not--” Dean breaks off, on the brink of being ready to lay it all out, bare, for Castiel to accept or reject. “The last time we saw each other. Did you--?”
“Don’t be mad, dude,” Dean says, a grin still plastered across his face. “I’m not making fun of you, I swear. It’s just-- you’re an angel, and--”
his soul, more intimately than anyone, he held it in his hands and breathed life back into it. And now it feels like Castiel’s eyes are looking right into him, into the core of his body and breath and blood and life and Dean wonders how it could be possible for someone to look at him that deeply, see all the mud and mistakes, and still look at him like he’s the most precious and important thing in the world.
“Paul told us how elusive and mysterious you are,” she says, narrowing her eyes at him playfully. “He thinks you’re a war veteran, but I think you were a spy for the government.”
Katie tilts her head, confused. “No,” she answers. “I think I just… felt it. When she touched me. And she told me that if I needed her again, all I needed to do was call her name.”
“Hello, Winchesters,” Meg says in a cool voice. “Isn’t this fun? We haven’t all been together like this since--”
Dean begins to position his arms so that he’s holding the gun the right way, but he seems dissatisfied with the result. Finally, he steps up behind Castiel and guides him into the proper stance. Castiel shivers at how closely Dean is pressed up against his back. Dean sighs a laugh into his ear.
The drive back to the house is silent. Dean doesn’t know if Castiel is as nervous as he is-- he’s drumming his fingers on the steering wheel, but that could just be a habit; his face is as cool and calm as ever. They pull up in front of the house and once again, Castiel leads him inside. Dean stands awkwardly in the living room while Castiel appears to go about his nightly routine: letting the dogs inside, making sure the gate is closed, turning off all the lights. He finally turns to Dean, who swallows.
feds are on the case. Either way, he’s got to tread carefully, because if there’s one thing hunters and feds both have in common, it’s territoriality.
The bloodhound lunges for Dean again, panting happily, and the movement seems to shock Castiel into action. He shoves the dog into the house with a muttered, “Stay, Jonah,” and steps onto the porch, slamming the screen door behind him.
“Look, our dad yells a lot, but he won’t throw you out if Dean and I both want you to stay,” Sam says. “And I want you to stay. So come on.”
“And here he is!” the man shouts, and Castiel cowers. “The civilian! Dean, goddamnit, what were you thinking?”
“Because you are somebody different,” Sam says when Dean mumbles this thought over breakfast. “Dean, you’re not twenty-six anymore. And you’ve been through Hell-- literally-- and Purgatory and now... well, maybe this just isn’t
“I don’t remember,” David says miserably. “I want to. I think I remember little things, like my name and his eyes and... and maybe a little bit from before, but I don’t remember the big things. I don’t remember Sam or Dean, or being friends with them, or loving them. And I don’t remember why I chose this, this forgetting.” David bites his arm to keep from crying. “I hate it.”
Sam immediately starts shrieking about how it’s four o’clock in the afternoon and Dean’s been missing for hours and this is why Sam needs the phone numbers of all of Dean’s friends, and it sounds like he’ll be screaming for hours if Dean doesn’t stop him.
“No, Dean,” he says, stroking the other boy’s hair. “You have a wonderful father who wants the best for you. Your brother adores you and worships the ground you walk on. And,” he pauses, not wanting to overstep with his boundaries, but then he throws his caution to the surrounding trees, “and you’ve got me. Always,” he adds. “You’ve got the three of us, forever.”
Kevin and Krissy are immediately at his arms, holding out hands for him to take. He accepts them both, gripping their fingers tightly, and he nods. Charlie nods back, and he eyes flutter closed.
John grins, and it’s the first time Castiel has seen him smile. He thinks faintly that he might enjoy the scowling more.
The pain reminds Dean of why he had passed out in the first place, and when his brain recalls the last thing he saw before his world went black, he almost pulls the sheets back over his head again. And has a horrible realization that he’s been in this bed before under very different circumstances.
“They took off into the woods,” Sam says. “You should go after them. Come on, Dad, let’s get Azazel into the devil’s trap.”
Dean’s face gets hot with embarrassment. It’s not up to these guys to protect him. Hell, he used to drink every day. He’s not a freaking
It only happens every so often that Dean catches Castiel’s eye over a salt-and-burn, or their arms brush as they’re walking in their fed getup to interview a vic, and Dean gets a shocking reminder of why, deep down, he’s still so angry. Dean’s been through Hell, literally, and been chased through Heaven by righteous angels, been ripped apart by hellhounds, and died more times than he cares to admit, so it’s just not fair that getting kicked out of bed by his best friend should hurt so much.
“Oh, sorry,” she says, pulling back and blushing. “I forgot you don’t know me like I know you. Well, I don’t know you, but we used to play when we were babies.”
Dean’s arm is about an inch from Castiel’s fingers, so he stretches slightly to play idly at the frayed material of Dean’s sleeve. He can feel Dean watching him, so he glances up. He means to stick out his tongue, make Dean laugh, but the impulse is lost when he sees the look in Dean’s eyes. He recognizes that look; he’s seen it on the covers of the books he reads. That’s truth. And it’s aimed at him.
“You don’t know that,” he says, frustrated tears gathering at the corners of his eyes. “One of those demons killed my mom. They’ve killed my dad’s friends, and my friends, anyone who was close to us. They could kill you, too. It’s not safe to be important to me.”
be really ready. It’s my job to get you prepared, and that’s gonna take you at least four more years, kid.”
It’s only when he doesn’t have Jude to focus on that Dean’s brain starts to process what happened, and his knees get so weak he would collapse if Sam wasn’t there to catch him.
,” he mimics Dean’s earlier words, and then, with another whistle, he has the dogs leaping up and clambering over each other to get into the house.
“I slept enough,” Cas grunts, shaking bones out of a bag into a large wooden bowl. “I want to get this done.”
“It’s not the same thing and you know it,” Dean says. “You’ve been human for five years and you think you’re a goddamn expert. But you’re not.”
Dean nods. He has no idea what Jude is telling the police, but they look very sympathetic so Dean imagines it must be good.
After a few moments, Castiel pulls away, his hands still framing Dean’s face. His eyes search Dean’s, and it’s like it’s always been with them-- the real things, the important things, they don’t need words, and Castiel finds what he’s looking for in Dean’s face because he leans up again, to press their lips together, and it’s less urgent this time, sweeter, and Dean feels like he could wrap himself up in this and never let go.
“And you figured showing up on my doorstep is what I would prefer?” Castiel asks, his eyes finally finding Dean’s.
“We’ve actually known each other for a couple years now,” Sam explains, running a hand through his hair. “She’s in my class, and she’s older, like me. She has a kid.”
“You don’t get to completely disappear and take a random three-day cross-country trip to see someone we haven’t talked to in two years and then come back looking like you’re going to kill yourself and then not talk about it, Dean,” Sam rattles off, fast and angry. “You don’t get to do that. I’m your brother. You’re supposed to talk to me.”
Castiel presses a knee up between Dean’s legs and Dean can feel how completely and totally aroused they both are, and he tries to move, tries to find friction, but Castiel shoves him to keep him still, snarls “
“Don’t make me pump you full of rock salt,” Dean says. “I guarantee, it won’t be fun for you. Go on, you’ve played scout... go back to your brother and your sister and tell them we’re ready.”
Dean wakes with the sun, but Castiel has seemingly been up for hours, assembling ingredients for a summoning.
Several hours, and several Jack and Cokes (and then just Jacks) later, Dean’s head is spinning. He and Paul have their arms wrapped around each other’s shoulders as they wobble down the street, and he knows Nick and Jude are right behind them, as he can hear Nick’s wild laughter.
There’s more blood, Dean is sure, but he can barely tell what’s going on. His vision is starting to vignette around the edges, like an old movie.
the way Cas is saying his name, laced with pity. He feels Cas lift his arm so he’s half-carrying him through the streets, and by the time they make it home, Dean just wants to sleep and forget any of this happened.
Castiel shrugs. “If she was lying, we’ll know soon enough. But it’s good to know she’s operating alone.”
It is Ben and Aaron, as well as Claire and Kevin, and David tries not to feel too insulted that they’re basically sending four people to babysit him while he conducts a very simple salt and burn. He obviously can’t interview witnesses or impersonate police officers, but he can sneak into the old house with Ben, find the old scraps of the dress the ghost was buried in, and burn them before she can kill any more people. After that, Claire takes him to the graveyard where they dig up the body just to be sure, and David is shocked by how unaffected he is by the acrid stench of a burning body.
“I’ve been tracking some anomalies up the coast,” he says, flipping through some pages. “Odd lights in the sky, people going missing.” He quirks an eyebrow at Dean. “Miracles.”
Castiel’s throat works, like he’s holding back a sob. “That’s what I thought,” he says. “I thought I wouldn’t trade it for anything.” He leans down and kisses Dean’s bloody lips, just once, so quickly it barely feels real. “I was wrong. Shut your eyes, Sam.”
Castiel looks up at him with eyes so sad Dean’s heart almost breaks. The sadness of two men, neither of whom have any idea who they are.
Castiel feels much safer after this, and a little part of him feels warm knowing that Dean can hear  him when he doesn’t speak.
Dean’s been driving for hours before his mind clears enough that he thinks to call Castiel. They haven’t spoken since their fight but Dean knows it would piss both Cas and Sam off if he went into this without backup.
The world looks the same. Charlie is smiling at him, rubbing her hands together as if to rid herself of residual power on her fingers. Castiel turns his head to see Krissy and Kevin at the table, their hands being wrapped up in splints by Garth.
“Oh, so you’re the new mechanic!” she throws back her head and laughs, revealing her white teeth again. “We’ve all theorized about you!”
He stomps back towards the house to raid Castiel’s fridge and is almost to the door before he notices that his car is sitting in the driveway. He gapes at it while Castiel breezes past him, his lips hinting at a grin.
“Now that you’re an expert shot,” Dean says, sliding his hands around to rest on Castiel’s back, “and we’ve got some alone time...”
Castiel chews on his lower lip (such a human trait; Dean wants to reach across the table and pull it free) and sits back in his chair.
Castiel smiles to himself. That sounds like Dean, his beautiful, weird, goofy Dean. The only terrible thing about remembering is that it makes him miss Dean with a constant emptiness that didn’t exist when he was just David, just the eighteen year old kid. The emptiness was there, he supposes; he just couldn’t name it. Now it has a name, and a face, and a date of expiration, when Cas dies and joins his friends, human soul and all, back in his old home.
Garth’s eyes are sad, but his tone is light when he says, “Nicked it off an angel, whaddaya think?” He ruffles David’s hair, and says, “Now go again.”
Dean works late doing accounting stuff, and by the time he locks up at quarter to ten, the last place he wants to be is Gina’s apartment, forcing small talk and ending the night with sex. So he goes back to what is technically still home for him-- he and Sam’s apartment close to Stanford’s campus.
“Well, where’d you get this one, then?” David asks, pushing down the urge inside him to reach out, grab it, and run.
“Sure is,” Dean nods. “I’ve fought enough angels for several lifetimes, thanks very much.” He pauses, wondering if this is the right time, then just decides to go for it. “Speaking of…”
His eyes are open in an instant, and terror floods his veins. He thinks about how stupid it was of him not to have crafted some sort of weapon: there are dangers in this world besides bears and snakes, as he has discovered in this past week, and if the demons are looking for the Winchesters, they might just find him by accident. He scoots as far back into the cave as he can go, hands scrabbling the ground for a rock or a stick, anything to defend himself. The crashing continues, getting closer and closer, and Castiel sighs and closes his eyes, preparing for the worst, preparing to die--
Castiel glances over at Dean, sees that look in his eye. He wishes he could wipe it clean; he wishes Dean could be young.
“I don’t want to scare you away, Cas,” Dean says, avoiding his eyes. “I don’t know what I would do if you went away and you thought I was some kind of--” He stops, but Castiel sees the word painted plainly across his face. Monster. “Everybody leaves me,” Dean sounds like he’s speaking more for himself now. “Everybody. And everybody will. And I’ll be alone.”
“I don’t read these books for the romance, or for the sex. I read these books because I’m sick of the way people speak to each other. In these books, people say what they feel. People care about the things being said to them. In the real world, nobody cares about what other people say. You are perfectly content to carry on a conversation without me. In these books, words matter. People matter.”
“Um,” Dean glances around at his surroundings. The reason he’s vibrating is because he appears to be on some sort of vehicle moving at top speeds. “I think I’m on a train.”
“No, don’t pull that,” Castiel says. “I know you talked to the sheriff, he told me he spoke to an Agent Plant. I know he told you there were already feds on the case. You
“Can I... get you something to drink?” Castiel asks unsurely, as if he’s read somewhere that one must ask these questions when one has a guest, but feels like it’s not exactly right for this particular situation.
Castiel yelps and bats ineffectually at Dean’s head until they both roll off the couch and onto the ground, where the wrestling recommences. Only this time, it progresses to Castiel’s dick in Dean’s mouth, and it’s very late when they tumble into Dean’s bed, tangled together like twine.
?” David demands. “Was I born this way? What am I? Am I human?” When no one answers him, he asks, “What happened to the witches?”
They chat some more, about their families, siblings, significant others. Paul is married to Sally, his high-school sweetheart, and Nick is just about to tell Dean about his love life when his face lights up and he waves at the door.
“And you don’t need to worry,” Ingrid continues. “They have no idea where you are, and your grace is safe.”
“Slow down,” Garth puts his hands on David’s shoulders, which are quivering. “Do you really want to know what happened to Dean and Sam?”
A moment later, the bell above the door jangles, and in stumbles a young man, covered head to toe in blood.
“Sam?” he says breathlessly, and Dean cannot believe that his stupid brother sat there on the line while Castiel chased him all over the house. “Yeah, I’ll call you back. No, I will not promise that. If I maim him it’s his own fault.”
“You’ve got such a long trip ahead of you,” Castiel says, stretching a little. “I thought you’d want to get an early start.”
“You don’t want to stay here with me?” Azazel puts on a faux-offended voice. Castiel wants desperately to turn around-- the faceless voice is more terrifying than anything else-- but he follows Dean’s instructions.
The next day brings Krissy to the door, and she stomps into the house with her big boots and almost shoves Garth through the wall. David watches from the stairwell.
Dean quiets, but Castiel can see in the dying light that Dean looks absolutely paralyzed with fear and relief, like he was expecting to find Castiel’s skeleton, picked clean of flesh by wolves or something.
Castiel’s not an expert in flirtation, but he can read body language, and Dean seems to be hinting pretty heavily. His tongue keeps sweeping out of his mouth to wet his lips, and his eyes are lidded. He’s practically got Castiel backed up into the bed.
Claire gives a short laugh. “Nothing,” she says, but when David glares at her, she says, “It’s nothing, really, David. You just... you’re starting to remind me a lot of my dad. I’ve seen pictures of him when he was a kid, and you look just like him.”
They brush their teeth and change into their pajamas, and as Castiel slides between the cool sheets, the lake making soothing noises, he thinks about Dean underneath him, and he hates himself, just a little bit.
“But what about...?” Dean gestures with his hand. Castiel’s been a living, breathing human for two years now, and he’d said he went to that bar a lot...
“Coming right up, angel,” Melissa says, and Dean feels a stab of hurt in his gut. He can feel Sam’s eyes on him, but he refuses to look, focusing on June instead.
“Yeah, some place in South Dakota,” Paul says. “I don’t remember the name. Something Falls? You were adamant, man.”
“On Paul’s birthday, the night we met,” she says. “We were talking, and then you dragged Paul out the door and when he came back, he said he’d put you on a train to South Dakota. So that’s what I’ve always called it in my mind. The South Dakota Thing. The Thing that made you desperate enough to get on a train in the middle of the night to get to South Dakota.”
Charlie nods. “When I was younger, I was one of the best computer and internet hackers of my generation,” she says, studying David’s face. “Turns out, hacking into a human brain follows many of the same principles.”
“Her name is Melissa,” Sam says, and his cheeks color slightly when he says her name.   “It’s, um... it’s actually our third date.”
don’t like this! I don’t want to think about what would have happened if I’d arrived a few hours later, or if I hadn’t been on the hunt at all.”
“Azazel and Alastair probably tracked me up here,” he says. “We had all the salt lines rigged up so they couldn’t follow us, but Dean and I just cut them, so once Meg joins them, they’ll probably head up here to finish us off. They won’t want to attack without her-- they hate being outnumbered.”
Bingo. There’s a sizable shed in the backyard of the house. It’s like a demon’s hostage dream come true. Only one entrance, so it’ll be pretty hard to take it by surprise. He does see a window, so he sneaks over to it, peeking carefully inside. Sure enough, Jude is tied to a chair, his face bloodied, a rag shoved into his mouth. He looks unconscious.
A ghost hunt in California takes Dean and Castiel too close to San Francisco not to visit, so Dean calls Sam and tells him to expect two more for dinner.
They don’t say anything (or rather, Dean doesn’t say anything) again until they start winding into the mountains, and Dean points out landmarks.
One morning, Dean is sleepily drinking coffee in the kitchen when Castiel slams a very large book in front of him.
to be hilarious, watching an ex-angel of the Lord attempt to connect with a precocious and bossy little three-year-old. But when he sees Castiel smile gently and walk the dog up June’s arm, Dean feels a pull in his heart that is way,
He bites his lip and waits a moment. He knows Sam is going to freak out when he drops the next bomb.
“I don’t,” Dean says, and then stops. Castiel can feel his jaw stiffen. “I don’t get to keep much, Cas. I’ve lost a lot of people. I don’t want to lose you.”
“Every time I think we’re okay,” Castiel says, his voice low. “Every time... you say something like that and I just think--” He looks directly into Dean’s eyes and Dean hates  himself so wholly in this moment, knowing he put that look on Castiel’s face. “Are we ever going to be okay?”
“You’ll what, brat?” one of the witches snaps. “You’ll unchain yourself and come over here and stab us with one of your little knives? I’d like to see you try.”
Krissy rises from the table, her eyes wet. Castiel opens his arms to her and she comes into them, squeezing him tightly. She’s so much smaller than him, both in stature and in his mind (with millions of years to remember, she’s no more than a short blip at the end of a long timeline) but he is relieved to realize that he still loves her, with fierce protectiveness, the way a son loves a mother. She releases him and thumbs his cheek.
He doesn’t know why seeing Nick and Jude together tonight, holding hands, laughing into each other’s mouths, threw him over the edge, but he tells himself it has something to do with the fact that Jude had blue eyes, bright with affection, just like...
that flashes across Castiel’s face to know he’s crossed a line and spoken of the things they’ve spent years walling off.
“I learned from the best.” Castiel’s voice is free of irony and it makes Dean want to reach through the phone and hug him, as chick-flick as it sounds.
David learns who Jessica is at lunchtime when the doorbell rings and in bounds a tall girl who’s probably about his age.
Dean hears the screen door slam again as Castiel comes bolting out of the house, tugging on his pants, and grabs his arm. He tries to pull away, but Castiel is strong.
“That was great,” the woman (Jenny?) purrs. She has blonde hair. He met her at the garage. She’d asked him out while he fixed her Prius.
Dean shoves this thought away with vehemence and punches his pillow into it’s proper shape. It doesn’t matter that he’s single again. It doesn’t change anything.
“Why?” Castiel asks, his eyebrows scrunching together, and Dean suddenly becomes completely incapable of having this conversation because
It’s like giving something away and getting something back at the same time, to have Castiel in his arms like this, smelling like suburbs and blood and lake water and angel, all at once. To maybe have someone to belong to again, and to have someone that belongs to him. It’s years and years of never saying anything, never seeing it, never understanding or acting or even acknowledging the existence of this
He spends the next day sleeping, reading a dumb mystery novel he bought at the train station, and fretting obsessively over this idiotic decision. Castiel is probably going to take one look at him and slam the door in his face. They hadn’t exactly parted on the best terms, and that phone call a couple weeks ago probably didn’t help much.
Castiel thinks about the moment he hurled the wine bottle at Lilith’s head to save Dean. Up until this point, he had believed that to be his bravest moment. But now he knows he was wrong. Back then, he didn’t even think about throwing that wine bottle. He just acted.
Whatever it is, it’s painful, and David screams, but around his screams he can hear something even more piercing and powerful, louder than anything he’s ever heard before. He squeezes his eyes shut, but something forces them open, something golden and bright and it hurts so much and David doesn’t understand how something can destroy him and complete him at the same time, but it’s here now, in his body. The witches scream, too, but the sound barely registers over the wild noise pouring out of David’s throat.
Castiel pulls away from him to fumble at his bedside table; he returns with lube, but no condom. Dean eyes his hands and raises an eyebrow. Castiel rolls his eyes.
She turns over and leaves Dean to his thoughts. Part of him is cursing himself, because she’s a beautiful woman who wanted him, and this is what he’s supposed to want, this is what he gave up his old life for. But he shoves that part down, because he knows that they don’t just understand each other. She doesn’t get him. She doesn’t get that as much as he likes sex, he doesn’t want to do it before breakfast. She doesn’t get that he’d rather go hungry than eat leaves slathered in dressing. She doesn’t get that he
Paul’s-friend-Gina is having a party, and her apartment is already full of people by the time they all stumble in. Paul wanders off to hug a group of people, all of whom scream, “Happy birthday!” at him, and Gina takes his arms gently to guide him to a couch.
“Well, that’s not very good for you,” Gina says. “Chicken is healthier. I’ll see you at home around eight, Dean?”
Shockingly, Dean’s mishap doesn’t wreck the tenuous truce he and Castiel had built over the last few months, but he can feel Castiel looking at him carefully whenever they hunt together. He’s not sure entirely sure why, but it feels a little too close to pity for Dean’s taste, so he refuses to turn and meet Castiel’s gaze whenever he feels it, sure it will lead to more apologies and explanations of how Castiel can never be with him. Probably has to do with him being a repugnant human failure or something fun like that. Dean’s well aware he has nothing to give. He doesn’t need the reminder.
He hears Dean sigh, but then the other boy seems to shrug it off, because he says in a bright voice, “You tired? I’m beat. Let’s get to bed.”
The next morning, drowsy with old tears but fueled by anger and excitement, he asks, “So that’s what I’m doing here, right? Learning how to be a hunter?”
He wakes up slowly, his vision black around the edges. He can hear something coming from the other side of the barn; raised voices? Gunshots? Maybe something else. There’s a loud yelp and a scream that sounds like the girl vampire that licked him, and someone is yelling. Then a few
“Why don’t you wait ‘til you’ve sobered up, Dean,” Paul says, patting his arm and trying to walk away, but Dean pulls him back.
“You breaking up with me, Dean?” Sam jokes when they sit down at the diner, but he sobers instantly when Dean doesn’t laugh. “Dude, you okay?”
“Dirty bunch of kids,” the bartender shakes his head. “They come in here sometimes, drink their collective weight in tequila before I kick ‘em out. There’s something real,” he shivers, “creepy about ‘em.”
Dean is gone when Castiel opens his eyes the next morning. He panics for several minutes, his mind going everywhere at once: Dean was eaten by bears, Dean was killed by demons, Dean drowned in the lake...
much), but it appears Castiel does, so he’s not going to make the weird weirder by refusing. “Sure.”
“Well, it’s probably going to be Aaron and Ben that take you on this hunt,” Krissy says. “So listen to them, okay? They’re going to be trying their best to protect you, but if it goes wrong, and they say run, I want you to run. All right?
“Sam, I am being so serious right now,” Dean says as best he can when his face is mashed into the table. “If you don’t stop asking me questions about what happened this weekend, I am going to punch you in your gigantic head. Do you hear me?”
“Dean!” Cas says, shocked, but Dean is already out the door, down the stairs, crossing to the front door, the screen clattering behind him as he strides out into the yard.
“I hated the Apocalypse,” Dean corrects. “I hated Eve. I hated the Leviathan, and Purgatory. But driving around the country, hunting ghosts and vamps and shifters? Saving people? I never got tired of that, Sam.”
“Nothing I say is going to change your mind, is it?” Sam asks, sounding very defeated, which makes Dean feel so very guilty, but he shakes his head.
Dean’s mouth snaps shut in surprise, because this is one of the very few times in his life that he’s wanted to talk about something and been shut down, but if Castiel doesn’t want to talk about it,
Dean swings his feet over the side of the bed and feels triumphant when standing up doesn’t result in him swooning like some kind of damsel. He creeps on socked feet into the hallway, where Castiel is standing with his back towards the bedroom, talking on the phone.
“You idiot,” Castiel says when they break apart. “I can’t believe you let me get out of the car. I can’t believe you almost let me walk away.”
Dean isn’t sure what happens next, except that he suddenly can’t breathe. His clutch on Jude loosens, and he topples backwards onto his ass. Except he can’t feel it. He can’t really feel anything. It’s only when he looks down and sees the long blade protruding from his body that he realizes that his lungs are slowly filling with blood.
It’s both more difficult and far easier to shoot the gun without Dean snug against him, and with the exception of a couple practice shots that hit the surrounding trees, Castiel manages to shatter every bottle on the fence.
He strikes gold when a bartender tells him that there’s a whole bunch of weirdos squatting at the old Cleveland place up the road.
Dean slips briefly into unconsciousness, but Sam shakes him awake with a yell, and moments later, Castiel is kneeling beside him, holding a glowing blue vial.
“I’ve missed her,” Sam says, reaching out with one hand to rest a few fingers gently on her hood. “I’ve kind of been telling myself that taking the BART and walking is easier, but...”
Dean’s eyes snap up to meet his brother’s and a guilty pit settles in his stomach when he sees that Sam actually looks
“No,” he says. “I’ll come back for your wedding, man. For Junie’s birthday. I’ll visit as often as I can. But... I just can’t live here anymore.”
There are still restless spirits, demons, werewolves, vampires, shifters, ghouls, every other terrifying monster that dwells in the dark. But there’s a whole new generation of hunters out there (Dean wonders how many of them are kids he taught about the dark and what lives in it) and that means it’s time for retirement. The dark still exists; it always will. But someone else is taking care of it this time.
“I spilled my guts all night, Cas, you gotta give me something!” Dean whines. “And just so you know: offer from before still stands. If you’re interested.”
There’s nothing local he can find (a couple weird deaths, but sometimes weird deaths are just that: weird) but when he branches out into more national papers he finds something good. With a big red pen, he circles
Dean watches the dogs peer worriedly from him to the house back to him, their big eyes sad, and he turns on his heel and stalks out of the salvage yard.
Alastair’s eyes spark with flame the same way Lilith’s did, and then they slowly fade, but Dean doesn’t stop. He keeps bringing the knife down into Alastair’s broken body, now riddled with knife holes. He doesn’t stop when blood spatters his face, or even when Castiel gently calls his name. The look on Dean’s face is manic, animalistic, and Castiel can hardly see the boy who held him tenderly just the previous night. Dean keeps going, stabbing what used to be Alastair, until his arm strength fails him, and then he falls, in a slow arch, onto the ground.
Dean resists the urge to argue. Two workaholics in a relationship might seem like a good idea, but for he and Gina it means that they really only see each other on weekends.
Dean feels about a hundred times better the second time he wakes up. His eyelids don’t feel like they’re permanently glued to his face and the swelling on the back of his head must have gone down because he can no longer feel it.
“No, sir,” Castiel says, quiet but firm. He’s completely terrified of this huge, bearded man but he refuses to be thought of as a powerless plaything. Even if that’s exactly what you are, a voice inside his head taunts.
Dean tries to fight back the wave of jealous nausea before it can hit him, but it crashes down with the weight of a thousand tons and he can almost feel the vibrations of
He’s prepared for Dean to say, “Why?” He’s prepared for Dean to say, “That’s stupid.” He’s prepared for Dean to say, “We’re basically partners in crime here, buddy, if I go down, you’re going down with me, now is hardly the time to cling to some stupid habit you clearly only use to get attention, so man up and let’s talk about where we’re even going right now.”
“I thought so. I’ve, uh. I’ve seen you around. And... I’ve heard of you. Sort of. I’ve only been in Westborough for a few weeks, but I’ve heard you don’t talk.”
David pushes that thought out of his head. He’s only fourteen. He has time. He’s not going to worry about why he didn’t want to kiss the sheriff’s daughter.
“I’m hoping it won’t come to that,” Cas says, measuring out spoonfuls of a reddish powder. “Ingrid is a friend. I’m hoping she’ll cooperate.”
“Drink?” he asks Castiel, but he can tell before his friend even answers that Castiel is only thinking of his bed upstairs.
“Because I don’t want to!” Dean resists the urge to scream in Castiel’s face. “Cas, you and I were family once, you were my best friend. Why is it so bad that I want to keep you in my life?”
“You’re so cute, I might let you live,” she breathes in his ear. “Keep you around, tied up somewhere fun...”
always wanted to have your powers. Can you look me in the eye and tell me, honestly, that you’re completely happy being human?”
“I think you and I need to have a talk,” Garth says. “Krissy, Kevin, make sure those splints are working okay. Everyone else, there’s fixins’ for sandwiches in the fridge, help yourselves.” He beckons to Castiel, who rises on shaky legs and follows him to the library.
Gina is beautiful when she and Dean have sex, and it’s good, it really is, but afterwards he doesn’t want to do anything but roll over and pass out. So he does.
He thinks briefly of this mother. He feels a pang of guilt that he hasn’t thought about her in days, wonders if she’s called the police. He wonders bitterly if she even cares. She has to care, Castiel thinks. I’m her son. This thought does not give him much reassurance. If his mother only loves him out of obligation, how can he expect anyone, especially Dean Winchester, to want him around?
The birds twitter back to him in their language, and for some reason, this heartens Castiel, and he sets off into the forest again.
David feels a lump in his throat. He knew Sam was probably dead, judging from the way everybody talked about him, but it was another thing completely to hear it spoken so frankly by someone who was close to him.
like the sound of a machete being swung very hard, and a couple thuds. Dean hopes it’s vampire heads hitting the ground. Then... silence.
He walks home, needing the time to think. He’s done an excellent job of pretending that his life here in California has everything he wants. Granted, it has a lot of things he wants: Sam in school, a home that’s not on wheels, an honest, steady, paying job as a mechanic, but it’s getting more and more difficult to ignore the gaping, fallen-angel-sized hole in his world.
Why are you even trying to stay alive? the traitorous part of his brain thinks. Are you going to go home? Back to silence and a school full of people who don’t listen and don’t care, back to a disappointed mother and a shelf full of books? The only good thing you ever had was Dean, and he was never really yours.
Meg’s eyes slide around the room, taking in all the devil’s traps, and they harden when they reach Castiel.
“Good,” Dean says. “I know it’s selfish, and I should tell you to go, get out, hitch a ride back to town, save yourself, but I don’t want to. I want you here, with me.”
There’s something in Garth’s eye, but he sighs and says, “Let’s say for sake of argument that they are.”
“This,” Garth says proudly, pointing to a knife with a wooden handle and a jagged, scalloped edge, “can kill demons. It’s the only thing that can. There ain’t many demons around anymore, since the gates got closed, so I keep it here in case of emergencies. And this,” Garth hesitates for a moment with the second blade. It’s long and sharp and looks like it’s made of glass or diamonds. “This is an angel sword. Can kill near just about everything, but it was made for killing angels. Each one is special to the angel it belongs to.”
Castiel takes off out the open door of the cabin, his shotgun ready in his arms. He stops to listen for sounds of struggle, but the woods offer only the normalcy of twittering birds and rustling leaves. Castiel begins to run, not knowing whether he’s even headed in the right direction. He knows he’s making too much noise to be able to sneak up on Dean and Alastair, but at this point, his main objective is finding them and he doesn’t care how he does it.
Dean and Sam live about a half hour away from campus. He wonders how Sam can come back to California. Back to Palo Alto, where he lost Jess. Back to San Francisco, where he lost Madison. Dean can’t bear to go back to the places where he’s lost people. It’s part of the reason he had to stop moving around: he’s lost people everywhere.
Dean wants to look at everything at once. In some ways, the living room looks just like it did when Bobby was alive: books everywhere, desk covered in a number of spell-work items, the ratty old couch that Dean is convinced is the root of all his back problems. But it’s not the same, a point proven by the fact that Castiel is standing there, looking at him like he’s the outsider, when it’s always been the other way around. Dean gulps when he thinks about the last time they stood here together, and said horrible things to each other, and he tries not to run.
“Just finished the devil’s traps by the porch door,” John says. “That’s the last one. The only way they can come in is the front door. We’ll be right here waiting for them.”
“Circumstances as in your demon buddy kidnapped them and traumatized them to the point where I had no choice but to erase myself from their minds?” Dean snaps, and it doesn’t take the look of absolute
“I thought things would be different after everything that happened,” he says softly. “I thought maybe you’d trust me more. I thought...” He looks furious with himself for a moment. “But you didn’t change. You were still the same Dean... selfish, unhappy, and you took it out on me.”
) and then the screen door bangs open and Dean almost gets knocked over by a large, slobbery bloodhound, and then someone is yanking the dog back by the collar and there’s a voice saying, “Sorry, sorry, he looks mean but he’s a big baby,” and Dean is saying, “Cas?” and then there’s silence.
“Fuck you,” Castiel says, and if Dean wasn’t literally in the middle of passing out, he would hear the hurt and tears in Castiel’s voice. As it is, he’s already being swallowed up by darkness, and everything is lost to oblivion.
Mark laughs, and it’s a fucking inside joke again, and that asshole is so lucky Dean doesn’t want to stab anyone tonight, because he’d be first on Dean’s list. Mark saunters away and Dean’s sure he’s swaying his hips slightly more than necessary, but his jaw drops when he realizes Cas is watching.
“Yeah, about that. What’s the plan here? We’ve confirmed this is angel business, but what does that mean for us?”
“Those things?” David repeats softly, his voice shaking. “You mean the monsters? The vampires, the ghosts, the demons, it’s all... it’s all
Castiel nods, and he lets himself be wrapped up in one of Garth’s classic bear hugs. Garth exits back into the kitchen, and Castiel sinks into a chair to read the letter on top of the stack of papers.
Castiel doesn’t say that he doesn’t give a fuck about school. He wants to say that his mother would probably be happy if he did something scandalous like run away from home-- it would give her something to gossip about. He doesn’t say that all he wants is to spend the rest of his life in the passenger seat of Dean’s car, doing whatever Dean is doing. He just bites his lip and swallows hard so he won’t cry in front of Dean.
She grabs her shirt from the floor and pulls it back on before slipping into her shoes and leaving. Dean listens for the click of the front door before he flops back onto the bed and stares at the ceiling.
Castiel spins and his heart drops into his feet. Alastair has Dean by the throat up against a tree, and there’s blood all over Dean’s face.
People don’t really talk to Dean at school, either, which surprises Castiel, because Dean is very attractive. Normally, the attractive people go right to top of the food chain at Westborough High School. But Castiel can’t think of a single person who he would call Dean Winchester’s friend.
“From... Hell, I guess. They’re real. They have black eyes and they possess people and they’re nasty sons of bitches, and it’s my job to kill them. Me and my dad’s.”
and taken care of. Right now Dean feels like a cheap, used whore. He feels like a toy, played with and broken and thrown away. Who was he even kidding, anyway, to think he could have this? To think it would all be so easy after so many years, to think there was one thing he wouldn’t completely and totally fuck up?
There’s a buzzing in David’s ears and he feels like he’s not in control of his own voice when it emerges, low and terrible, from his throat. “
?” he asks, knowing his voice sounds awestruck, but he’s never met someone related to Sam or Dean before.
There’s a hand on his shoulder, and there’s Sam, looking incredibly smug, and Dean tries to wipe what he knows is an terribly sappy look off his face.
“I like your voice,” Dean rumbles in his ear. “I know I said I didn’t care, but now that I’ve heard it, you have got to talk more.”
Dean wakes up just outside of Boise. It’s the end of the line for the train, so he has to get off and buy a new ticket. It’s going to take him about twenty hours to get from there to South Dakota, and he thinks longingly of his car, back in Palo Alto. He almost decides to go back and get it, but a little part of him knows that if he goes back to California, he’ll never leave again. He buys a ticket for Pierre, hoping he’ll be able to rent a car once he gets there.
Dean is suddenly hit with a wave of nervousness. Is Castiel going to beat him up in the alley and leave him for dead? Or (his heart lurches at the thought) something else?
Castiel smiles, letting himself be pulled up against Dean’s body, and he winds his arms around the other boy’s neck. Dean dips his head and presses their lips together, soft at first, and then more demanding, persistent but relaxed, sweet as sugar. They wrap even tighter together, and Castiel’s not sure he’ll ever be able to tear himself away from Dean ever again, not if Dean keeps doing that thing with his tongue...
The demon stands up fluidly. “That was almost too easy,” it declares. “You’re disturbingly out of practice.”
“I know you don’t believe in yourself right now,” he says. “But I believe in you. I carried this coat with me for six months. Because part of me always believed that you’d come back. And I knew that when you did, you’d need this coat.”
They get into the car and they drive down the mountain in silence. Dean turns on the radio to fill the quiet, and every song sounds like it’s playing during the rolling credits on the film of Castiel’s coming-of-age story; after a nice adventure, the changed boy goes back to the town he came from and finishes school and becomes a businessman. Castiel doesn’t want that to be his story. He can’t go back.
He tries to stand, and immediately slumps, winded. It takes three tries to get out of bed, and then he has to hobble like an old man across the room and down the stairs, leaning on walls and doorways and bannisters for support.
Castiel has a hand on the door handle, the door cracked open, a foot out on the street, and then two, and then he is out of the car, slamming the door, standing on the side of the road, pointed towards the last place on Earth he wants to be.
“Thank god,” he says, “We aren’t even close to being ready. Here,” he shoves a flask at Castiel, “it’s full of holy water, it burns their skin. They have the power to throw us, but it weakens them, so they’ll only do it as a last resort. We’ve only got one of those daggers that kills them, and Dad has it, so the best we can do it shoot them until they fall into one of the devil’s traps, and they’re pretty much everywhere.”
“I think it had something to do with Jude and Nick. They were standing off in the corner, you know, doing... what they do, and it made you really upset. Not like, angry, but... I don’t know, and then you made me take you to a train station.”
“Morning, Dean,” Melissa chirps, setting a pile of eggs and bacon in front of him and ruffling his hair affectionately.
“Sam,” Castiel says once the entire table is filled with completed shells. Sam turns to look at him and raises his eyebrows in response.
“Do we need holy oil?” Dean asks, gulping down his coffee and wincing at its bitterness. “I’ve got some in the trunk.”
Castiel takes a deep breath. “I want you to fuck me,” he says finally, and hearing those words fall from Castiel’s lips is pretty much the hottest thing Dean’s ever heard, so he can’t stop himself from surging forward and kissing Castiel with more abandon than he’s ever kissed anyone, sloppy and wet and edging into rough.
“Thank you,” Castiel repeats, stiffer this time. “Be careful, Ingrid. You drew attention to yourself with this miracle and that’s not acceptable. If you’re going to live on Earth you must live as a human.”
Castiel throws the phone onto the counter and fixes Dean with the most murderous glare he’s ever seen.
David feels like he’s eating, breathing, and sleeping hunting. He’s starting to have dreams about it, although he can’t tell the difference between The Dreams and just dreams, because Dean is in both of them, and they’re hunting together, with Sam, taking down demons and ghosts and other weird anomalies.
“Can you see me?” Castiel asks, his fingers still dancing across Dean’s forehead and the side of his face. “Does your head hurt? Are you dizzy at all?”
“I’m fine,” he says, his earlier fears of the day banished in a moment by the look on Dean’s face when Castiel cards fingers through his hair. “I caught a fish.”
with him, why he’s so insistent on hurting Castiel, even though they promised to forget about everything, including the night they spent together.
June looks mildly grumpy from being woken up and she’s rubbing her eyes with one baby fist and clutching Sam’s collar with the other.
“You’re real,” Dean is saying. “I’ve lived my whole life with nightmares and darkness and shadows and besides my family, you’re the only light I’ve ever seen. I swear, Cas, I haven’t laughed this hard in years, and you haven’t even said a word! I don’t even know what your voice sounds like! And I don’t have to, because honestly, Cas, it doesn’t matter, I don’t need to, I want you anyway, so much--”
He tosses the phone down on the seat next to him and floors it, the speedometer needle edging into 80. He only hopes he can get there in time.
He texts Gina to tell her he’s not coming and her response text is short and snippy, but he can’t bring himself to care. Sam and Melissa receive him with open arms and tuck him into bed (in the room that is still his room, even though he usually stays at Gina’s) and he sleeps better than he has in weeks.
Maybe it’s because Dean seems so much older than everyone else. He looks their age, certainly, but there’s something in his eyes that suggests maturity and age. Castiel thinks back to the way his knife pierced the back of that little girl and thinks that makes sense. To be able to stab a child in the back with such determination requires knowledge of true evil, the knowledge of what would come should the child be allowed to live.
Castiel doesn’t think. He just watches as his hand moves of its own accord, picks up a bottle of wine from the shelf next to him, and hurls it at the girl.
Dean swallows and refuses to look at him. Castiel’s heart drops into his stomach and he feels like he’s going to throw up.
“Good boy, Jonah,” Castiel says approvingly, strolling up next to the dogpile and grinning down at Dean. “Esther, good girl.”
It shouldn’t affect him this much, watching Nick and Jude together, but it does. They’ve kissed before, in front of him, smiled soppily at each other, had entire conversations with their eyes at the bar about when they should leave and go home. And Jude has dark hair and blue eyes and sometimes when he looks at Nick, Dean sees something so familiar it makes his gut ache.
Castiel’s body responds faster than his brain, leaping into action and fleeing like an escaped animal. His legs take him out of the cabin, down the gravel driveway, out into the forest. He darts through the trees, almost stumbles on a couple of loose roots, loses a shoe along the way, runs and runs and runs until his legs are burning and he knows he’s completely, hopelessly lost. It comforts him to know that he couldn’t find his way back even if he wanted to. He won’t be the week, impotent civilian who wanders back to John Winchester for help.
It doesn’t feel anything like anything Dean’s ever felt before; Castiel rips all of these new feelings out of him that he’d usually rather push down, rather keep locked away, far from the sun, to be safe; Castiel pulls him open, brings those things to light, but somehow makes him feel taken care of at the same time, and Dean doesn’t know when he started trusting Castiel with his entire life again, but when he opens his eyes and looks at Castiel, flushed, panting, beautiful beneath him, he feels nothing but safe, trusting... home.
But they say it’s over, and they take the machetes and shotgun shells out of the trunk, and Sam applies to Stanford, and Dean pays first and last month’s rent on a little house.
Melissa is ecstatic about meeting Castiel, to the point where Sam has to draw her gently away because Castiel is starting to look alarmed. Dean resists the urge to remind his little brother how he stammered like a preteen with a crush the first time he shook Castiel’s hand.
He doesn’t know how long he stands in the yard, staring at the house, but the sky has only grown darker by the time he finally drags his heavy feet up the front porch steps and knocks firmly on the door.
Castiel lights a match and tosses it into the bowl. The ingredients catch fire, emitting a sickly sweet smoke that curls into the air. There’s a whisper of wings on the air, and then Ingrid is standing before them, looking less surprised than Dean would expect.
“Does Dean do this often?” he asks, and Sam doesn’t need clarification of what Castiel means by ‘this’.
he is about all this; he knows himself well enough to say pretty firmly that if this had happened four years ago, he would have found himself sneaking out before the sun rose and leaving a vague note on the kitchen counter.
“And then we had to save the world, but it wasn’t the apocalypse, it was a nuclear reactor or something and we had to climb all these stairs so you could fix it, so we were just climbing and climbing--”
Garth strokes the scratchy stubble on his chin. “You’ll be eighteen soon, technically, and we can set you up doing basically whatever you want. So read through all this crap, think it over, and let me know what you decide.” He places a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and grins. “You may have all your angelic knowledge, Cas, but you’re still human. And so we’re all going to be here to take care of you for as long as you want. Okay?”
An hour later, the paramedics have been called, Nick has been rushed into an ambulance, and Jude is talking to the police, covered in a shock blanket. When Sam and Dean woke him after being exorcised, he hadn’t remembered much, only that Nick had some kind of psychotic break and tried to lure Dean to the house.
“You have grown,” he says finally, “into a wonderful, brave, strong woman. Your father would have been proud of you.”
He gives the phone one long, last look, and then shoves it none-too-gently off the table. Leaving it there, he stalks up the stairs to his bedroom. If that’s how things are going to be, then fine. Dean is awesome at forgetting about one-night stands, and this is no exception.
But Castiel is gazing up at the light with such a fierceness that Dean suddenly doesn’t even believe himself.
There are footsteps, growing louder as they get close to him. His potential rescuer rounds the corner.
Castiel does not kiss with sugar and milk; he kisses bitter, mean, burning, livid. There’s blood on both their lips now, blood on their tongues, blood on Castiel’s hands that keep Dean pinned to the wall. But this is a war that Dean can win, so he attacks Castiel’s mouth with equal fury, pouring frustration into the kiss, reaching up to grab ahold of Castiel’s hair.
Dean’s not sure which part of him hurts the most: his nose is definitely broken, and his back is probably scraped up pretty good from being thrown against a brick wall. Castiel hits him again, and again, and again, and his shoulder blades feel like they’re cracking, and his ribs are crushing his heart, and the worst part is, he wants it. He wants to beg Castiel to break him into a thousand little pieces and scatter him across the world.
He almost expects Dean to laugh at him, but when he looks at the other boy, he is scanning the trees with a determined look on his face and strategy in his eyes.
He removes his hand from over Dean’s mouth, but he doesn’t lean back. They sit staring at each other for a moment.
He’s right: Sam and John have painted entrapments all over the cabin, by every door and one large one in the family room. Dean pulls Castiel close and slides an amulet on a thin black cord around his neck.
“I haven’t asked you for anything in two years,” he says quietly. “Why couldn’t you just leave me alone?”
Dean screws his eyes shut, preparing for fingers on his forehead and the horrible squeezing feeling he gets in his gut from being angel-zapped, but it doesn’t come. Instead, there is a hand on his cheek, a rough palm, and then lips on his, quick and hard and sorry. An apology.
There are a million things Castiel wishes he could say to Dean in this moment. He says none of them, but he wonders why Dean uses the word ‘job’.
“That couch is bad for your back,” he says tiredly, and folds himself into the bed, leaving an entire side open for Dean.
And then they’re kissing, and Castiel is suddenly bursting with thousands of unspoken words about every little sensation: the fumbling of inexpert mouths to find a way to move together, tongues that push past lips, licking into warmth and wetness and wow, it’s a good thing his mouth is occupied, because Castiel wants to let every word he’s kept inside for the past three years babble out of him like a river, so he just presses harder into Dean, giving him everything, everything he has.
Then they’re in the car, Castiel in the passenger seat, speeding down the highway. Dean puts on music again, but this time it doesn’t feel like the credits are rolling.
Dean’s alarm goes off a couple hours later and he drags himself out of bed to get ready for a day at the garage. When he gets there, Paul is working on a Camarro, his hands already stained with grease.
“They were monsters and they needed to be put down,” Dean says. “You expect me to ignore a case just because it sounds hard?”
“We’re going up to the Catskills,” he says, seemingly reading Castiel’s mind and answering his unspoken question. “My dad’s up there, in a cabin. We can hide out for a while.”
“Sam agrees with me,” Castiel says sanctimoniously. “Neither of us have any idea why you would want to hunt again, much less start out hunting with an entire nest of vampires!”
The year passes quickly, full of weapons training and sparring. Garth may be old, but he’s scrappy and he knocks David to the ground more than once (more than ten times) the year between his fourteenth and fifteenth birthdays. He sees a lot more of Kevin, but very little of Krissy, Aiden, and Josephine, to his disappointment. Garth consoles him-- the bunker is close enough for visits, but his three childhood caretakers are most often on opposite ends of the country hunting. David sees a lot more of the other hunters who drop in on Garth to ask questions. A couple months before his birthday, Garth puts him in charge of answering the cell phones (not the F.B.I. one, he still sounds too young) but he loves the excitement of participating in the hunt by looking up antidotes to venom and spell-breakers and research on creatures. It is through many phone calls that David becomes close to Claire Novak, who starts popping in on her off days to have lunch with him and tease him about going through puberty.
“You’re just as charming as ever,” Castiel says, nonchalant, but there’s a bite to his words that makes Dean burn with embarrassment.
“I was going to kill you quickly, Alastair,” Dean gasps, his eyes burning. “But if you hurt him, I will torture you for years and never let you die.”
He can still see the lake through the trees, so he figures as long as he sticks close to the water, he won’t die of dehydration.
They’re fine, for a while. The breaking point comes not during a hunt, like Dean expects, but when he and Cas are just sitting in the bar in Sioux Falls, the same bar that they went to the night they— well, Dean’s been here before. They’re chatting amiably, discussing the various ways they prefer to get rid of a ghoul infestation, when the door swings open and a man walks in. He’s built kind of like Dean, but his hair is a much darker brown and his face rounder, open and friendly. He strolls up to their table, and Dean’s about to tell him to get lost, they don’t need any Bibles or vacuum cleaners, when he notices that Castiel is smiling at the man, a real smile, a welcoming one.
“Don’t burst into tears just yet, Dean-o. When you knew him, he was all Nicky. But I’ve been riding around him for a few months now while you’ve been off finding yourself or whatever. And speaking of riding…”
“I know, right?” Dean says, incensed. “He didn’t even give a good reason. So what if we’re retired? And South Dakota and California aren’t
