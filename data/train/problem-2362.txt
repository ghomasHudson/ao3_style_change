I never bothered to dress cause I always shift before you wake up, and I need to be naked to do it anyway. And I would have to steal something from your wardrobe to do it.
It's raining. Just like it happens at funerals in every movie. A light drizzle is covering the coffin of one of their childhood friends while it slowly disappears into the ground.
Scratching under Cas’s neck, he dropped on the bed and cradled his head in his hands, the cat still respectfully sitting beside him.
“According to your mad plan, you would have left me without giving me the occasion to see this beautiful face. That would have been a real shame honestly” He grinned, still running his thumbs across Cas’s face, earning a hesitant smile and a blush on his cheeks.
He also soon discovered he didn’t have to worry about his allergy. The cat was a in fact a black and white Sphynx, completely hairless, with enormous deep blue eyes that never failed to show all his curiosity and vitality.
It's eventually Castiel who breaks the stillness, scooting closer to Dean and placing his head on Dean's shoulder. Immediately, Dean's arm finds its place around the angel's waist and, after a brief hesitation, he turn a little his head to leave a trail of soft kisses on Castiel's forehead. This has become a once-in-a-lifetime occurrency by now. Dean putting aside the mask of emotionless, firm leader, and allowing Cas to see his true self, the one he never dares to show anyone else beside the angel; the caring, passionate man, with a heart crushed under the weight of every awful thing he's been through. and Cas intend to enjoy every moment of it, until life dawn again on their fragile bubble of serenity and they are forced to leave and face another day, fight another battle.
“Oh man..” he is clutching at his stomach “you know, just today, six people asked me if it hurt when I fell from heaven, and then you show up, say the most awkward thing you could have possibly ever said, and still you indeed have my face tattooed on your leg! How is that even possible?”
He is distracted for a second, wiping his teary eyes with the back of his hand, when someone steps in front of him, and then arms envelopes him, strong and still familiars after years.
“Cas? My cat Cas? I’m sorry buddy, but if you were looking for a plausible excuse, you could have tried told me you were an ex.
They exchange small talks just like old friends do, and Dean is drunk with the sensation of maybe being on the way to reconstructing something.
“My family!” he shouted with bitterness “Those fucking cowards thought I had been marked by the devil himself, they didn’t want a monster under their roof. The first time I talked to them about what had happened to me, they gathered all my things and throwed me in the street. That’s why I’m telling you the man I was before is dead.”
“I’m sorry, Cas, but you’ll have to help me in this. Yesterday morning I didn’t even believe in ghosts and now I find out my cat is some sort of magical creature that can change his form; I’ll need some time to get used to this.”
They quietly ate together, as they had done so many times before, except that now Cas would laugh at Dean’s jokes, and Dean would ask about Castiel’s past, his transitionings and his life as a cat.
Oh, of course, asshole, do you even listen what comes out of your mouth? He chides himself. Do something, damnit, don't leave him waiting!
Dean's plan of running from Benny obivously backfired on him the moment he rounded a corner, as, entering the main room, he tripped on his shoelaces and fell on the ground like sack of potatoes.
It was a late afternoon, and Dean was heading home after a walk in the local park when, from a neglected alley, he heard a cat desperately calling for help. He immediately started looking for it, since nobody else in the street seemed interested by the meowing, and after some seconds of frantic searching, he found the cat slumped under a trash can, all bloody and almost unconscious.
The following moments were a rush to get to the first vet doctor he could find, almost tearing down the door of the only one he could find still open this late in the evening, crushing against them.
Dean almost choched on the beer he was drinking. "Cas?! What the hell are you talking about buddy? He's not.. he's not my boyfriend! He never was!" he stuttered.
The couple ran past them, towards the bedrooms, hand in hand, not even noticing the men pratically howling at them like fans at a football match.
Castiel stood in the middle of the room, unsure of what to do and still a little shaken, then, once Dean turned off the light, he transformed again and softly jumped on the bed.
It's only when they are both in bed that Castiel hugs him and says "Oh, baby, I'm not going anywhere till the end."
You may have lived with me for a year, but I lived with you for a year as well. Nothing you had done have ever made me think you were bad.
That's how, two grown men, a vampire and a hunter no less, found themselves, shoulder to shoulder, fighting for who should spy the couple through a keyhole.
There was a time when they were inseparable, when Dean could throw an arm around his waist, and Cas would sit on his lap every time it was possible, sometimes because he wanted to, sometimes just to piss people off. They would excange classic books to read at day and write graffiti against society's oppression at night. They were two souls intertwined together as they were one.
After a brief visit, the vet reassured him; the cat was dehydrated, and he had lost a lot of blood consequently a deep cut below his rear leg, but with some intensive cures, he would be out of danger.
Castiel even goes as far as pulling his phone out to do what looks like wanting to exchange numbers, only to hastly change idea and put it back in his pocket.
Every doubt sorted out, Dean covered the already little space that divided them and hugged him, whispering "It's so good to see you again brother"
"Of course it can!" Cas squeals his fake horror in a way that shouldn' be possible for his deep voice. "I thought we had established that years ago.
“I’m sorry you had to find out like this. I’m always really careful, and you always sleep like a hibernating bear, I never thought you would wake up. “
“Cas?” he called. But he didn’t have to wait for an answer, for, when he entered the kitchen, a man with raven black hair stood at the counter, his back at him, busy pouring something in a frying pan. At least he was dressed now.
There's a comfortable silence hanging above them, and, actually, there's not much to say. They both are exausted after another long day at the camp, and it's such a rare opportunity to have the time to enjoy a moment of quiet peacefulness, when most of the time there are screams, sirens wailings and dogs barking in the distance as a constant reminder of the living hell they are in.
How could this be real? Yeah, Dean had only knew him in his cat form, but Cas was the sweetest, most adorable cat Dean had ever had the luck to know.
He approached him carefully, still afraid of a rejecting reaction, but Dean was already almost asleep, lying on his side towards the centre of the bed.
“You said it yourself, I am a freak, and I’ll understand if you’ll ask me to leave. I fooled you and I deserve nothing. I am so sorry Dean.”
“Ca.. Cas” He shily placed a hand on the man’s shoulder “Let me take you a blanket, you’re shaking, man.”
Goddamnit he couldn’t be seriously considering this. This is real life, not a fancy movie. There are no such things as shapeshifting cats.
"So you're telling me" he got up from the chair "that you" grabbed the knife from the middle of the table, "made me walk for miles and miles, for an entire year" rounded the table to come near to Dean "when we could have left after a couple of weeks" he lifted the knike, pointing it right to the man's chest "just because you couldn't leave without your oh so platonic "BRO"?"
Dean didn’t mind very much about relationships. The long list of disastrous relationships he had had during all his life had a certain weight in Dean’s mind, who one day realized it wasn’t that bad being single. He would have some fun sometimes, but nothing more. He had a beautiful life even without a partner.
The two men are sitting on the cabin's porch, Castiel's legs spread over Dean's lap; the latter absentmindedly massaging his feet.
Okay, you may have forgotten to mention you weren’t a cat, but you’re my family too Cas. I was so fucking alone before meeting you, if you still trust me even if now I know your secret, I’ll never ask you to leave. Having a doubled version of you is better than don’t have you at all.”
His grip is firm while they shake hands, but then, instead of letting go, Castiel just turn his wrist and lowers their hands down, intertwining their fingers together with a soft smile gracing his face.
Do you remember the day you found me, in that alley? That was the work of an old.. friend” he air quoted
“Wait.. no.. yes.. you are right, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable, but I really meant what I said, look!”
"Excuse me! Do you care to explain me what just happened? What was that, and how are you even alive! Wha- why are you looking through the keyhole now?!
"Brother, why do you think he keeps coming back? It's not like he's getting paid. Don't you think he keeps coming back to you because he likes being with you?
“Go where? Dean! What’s the matter? I’m never gonna find you again in this crowd!” but Dean is already too far to hear the complains Charlie and Dorothy are throwing at him.
Talking with someone after work. The joy of preparing a special meal to someone who would appreciate it. The comforting sensation of knowing there is someone waiting for you at home.
When the doctor announced it was finally time for the little patient to go home, Dean carefully cradled him in his arms and brought him home.
Face already red as a tomato, with a shrug he pushed Benny off him, and once on his feet again, he mumbled something that resembled "Yeah, don't worry Sammy, it's alright",looking anywhere but at the men.
Rather, what have you done to him? He always sleeps with me. If you’ve hurt him I swear to god I’m going to kill you.”
Holy mother, that voice, he has just barely heard a couple of words and he is already.. wait a second, he hadn’t planned for the man to watch at him with a bit of unease in his eyes.
The music slowly creeps back into their ears, and their surrounding is perceivable again. Castiel face is still smitten, and they are so near to each other now they could almost hear their fast heartbeats if there were a little more silence.
The boy beside him has changed so much since he last saw him; his voice is deeper, his body is muscular and tanned. Dozen of new tattoos cover his arms and, presumably, his whole body.
The feline tilted his head on one side, as if concentrated thinking, and then jumped on his lap purring, rubbing his nose against Dean’s stomach.
Bright blue eyes, soft, full lips, curly dark hair and a pair of fluffy wings hanging on his shoulders.
“No, actually, I was wandering, how about se sit somewhere and you tell me all about that tattoo of yours?”
“I’m sorry if this is all so sudden, but I need to ask you, man; what would you say if I told you I have your face tattooed on my leg?”
“I can’t believe you Dean. After all I’ve told you you’re not batting an eye.  You’re not even pissed I lied to you all this time. On the contrary, you’re sitting here planning your day with your cat-monster. How can you be so calm?”
Dark curly hair, muscular body barely hidden under a white tshirt, and two fluffy, candid wings hanging above his shoulders.
I feel horrible and I wish things were different but that's it for now. These people needs me, and if we leave now that would mean the end. No coming back."
Actually, it’s been a perfect day so far. Hot girls. Hot guys. A cold beer in his hand. He had waited a whole year for this day, and he will enjoy every second of it.
"It's alright Dean, I love spending time with you. And besides, it's not like I have 10 orgies per day! I always have time for you.
When Dean woke up the following morning, he was alone in bed. Weird. Cas always waited for him before heading downstairs.
What the fuck was going on here? Not ten minutes ago he was comfortably sleeping in his bed, and now he was sitting beside a crying, shaking man, that apparently could transform into his cat. When had his life transformed into a young adult novel?
All is quiet for some minutes, but Cas can still sense the tensness in Dean's shoulders, and the shuddered breaths he takes, as if opening his mouth to say something, but thinking against it the very same moment.
While walking to a quiet café where they can chat, Dean thinks he should probably call Charlie and tell her he’ll be late to the party in the evening. Or probably he won’t even make it there. They’ll see him tomorrow hopefully bearing good news.
"I AM OVERREACTING? I AM OVERREACTING? I SHOW YOU OVERREACTING!" His body tensed for a second, and the next moment, he was chasing Dean through the bunker's hallways, knife raised, screaming like a mad man
Dean cleared his voice, panic in his eyes, and stepped forward, closer to the angel. This was it. The showdown
"But I still don't understand how can you be here, did you find a human transport?" asked Dean, moving away and gesturing Benny to follow him into the car.
On Dean’s calf doesn’t stand a perfect image of the man, obviously, it’s still a tattoo in “traditional” style, after all. And yet, the resemblance is unequivocal.
With one last jump he is right beside him, and he takes advantage of the moment when he’s still unnoticed to run a hand through his hair, trying to smooth ‘em down.
He should have taken more seriously the idea of owning a sentient creature. He had fed him with food scraps sometimes. Now he felt almost ashamed by it.
"What kind of idiots are you two? Even a kid can see the heart eyes you make at each other. Do I really need to come back from the dead to stick your head out of your ass?"
Three weeks later Castiel was settig the boxes that contained his whole life in the car while Dean just stood there looking at nothing.
Listen, it’s four in the morning, I’m exhausted and I’m not even sure if I’m dreaming all this. Now I’m going to sleep, you do whatever you apparently do while I’m asleep, and then we’ll talk tomorrow morning. Okay?”
“Yeah, you’re right” Dean said, placing his hands around Cas’s waist, love shining bright in both men’s eyes
The sun has already set, and, even if the street is still pretty packed, the crowd is already starting to disperse; young teenagers are waiting at the bus stop and families with sleepy children on their shoulders are gathering their things and leaving.
Only then Sam noticed his brother was lying on the floor, and coming closer, surprise of surprises, he saw on top of him there was Benny! The vampire! With a knife in his hand!
Maybe one day you'll wake up and you'll decide you don't want to put up with my shit anymore, and you'll go away. Or worse, one day I'll have to decide between us and the rest of the world, and i will have no choice.
One day, Dean suggested they went out shopping, together “You need to get out of this house, man, I’ll be with you, you won’t have to worry, and we need to find you something to wear. My wardrobe is kinda starting to feel the pressure of being shared by two people even if intended just for one.” he had said.
It's been eight years now since that happened, and Castiel is slipping away from his vision again, walking away, saying those same fucking words again, like Dean doesn't die every time a bit more.
He glances at Dean and then subtly roll his eyes. Oh, yes, what a shame being seen with the person you shared half your life with and then abandoned.
Dean hadn’t even stopped to think that this wasn’t his cat, he was allergic to cats no less, he agreed immediately to sustain every cure himself, the only thing that mattered was saving the cat’s life.
The phone rang a couple of times before Dean could pick it up, busy searching for informations through the lore in the bunker's archives, about this south american pagan god which was currently terrifying a little town in Ohio, slaughtering people as ritual sacrifices.
“You’re confused, I know it. But I can explain. Well, I had hoped this would have happened in another situation, but we’ll have to roll with it now I guess.
I haven’t had a home in years, and you gave me the world, Dean. You have always been so kind to me, and I thought I could pretend I was just a normal cat, live a little slice of happy life before I was forced to leave you and hide somewhere else.” Castiel’s voice broke, his eyes now filled with tears that he angrily wiped away.
He would never forget the immense amount of gratitude directed at him that transpired from the little animal’s eyes the first time he woke up and blinked at him.
“Alright then..” He squeezed one last time his shoulder and then got up, heading to the top of the bed to lie down again.
"You try spending one year with a man that only seem to talk about his angel; how he needs to find that angel, how much he miss that angel, how he would rather die than leave without him. How does it sounds Dean Winchester? Certainly not a walk in a field of flowers for me!"
And I was a coward. After I left I told myself 'it's not a big deal, I'll go back, 'cause they love me, and they'll understand me.  But then months passed, and you never called, and i got angry. You were rightfully pissed at me 'cause i turned my back at you. but I didn't understand why you'd rather stay with the asshole that was your father instead of leaving this place and beginning a new life. Sam could have come with us, we just needed to think it through. But you closed that door as soon as I mentioned it."
"You know what, Castiel? You're a hypocrite. You had my heart in your hands, all those years ago, but instead of handing it back you crushed it and crumbled it and took its remnants away with you, and I guess you still carry it around, or now I wouldn't be here stomping my feet like a fucking idiot. When you left i did what I could to survive! Alone, withouth the person i loved, with my brother to raise and my father who died just a bunch of years later.
"Goddamnit Castiel, stop please!" Dean yells, and he doesn't care if he's making a scene in the middle of the street, and people are coming out from the house to watch him funny. He's not letting him out of his sight again before getting some answers. "I swear if you take another step I'll punch you, you son of a bitch!"
"Why, how do you know what's best for me? Don't I deserve an explanation after all those years? Some kind of closure, then I won't bother you again."
Back at home, later in the evening, both exhausted by the tiring session of shopping, they collapsed on the sofa, and Cas, gathering all his courage, kissed Dean for the first time, hesitantly, not quite sure of what to do.  Dean grinned like a madman, hugged him, and peppered his face of small kisses, Castiel blushing furiously below him.
With the minimum effort and renewed boldness, he lifts Castiel up bridal-style, and, quoting that old Rolling Stones' song, he sing softly into the angel's ear "
Dean was speechless, and out of breath. He knew this moment would have come, sooner of later, and he had dreaded it the whole time.
Dean watched him, taking in all his tall figure, from the pointed nose to his toned body. And to think that, as a cat, he could fit perfectly curled above his chest.
In his bed, right beside where he was mere seconds ago, was a man, a naked man, clutching at the sheets, eyes wide with dread.
“WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THIS NOW? A STRANGER BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE AND THEN HE TRIES TO MOLEST ME WITHOUT ME NOTICING?”
“No, I’m here with a couple of friends. They’re here somewhere throwing glitter at the heteros probably” he chuckles, but his smile soon turns mischievous “Why, are you planning of getting rid of me already, angel?”
I ran away, from you, from everything. Everything I touch I break! We were just a bunch of high schoolers too busy to pay attention in class, I couldn't handle something as beautiful and perfect as you.
"What has gotten you into such a good mood tonight?" Cas can't help but ask, the first words spoken in hours.
He must have been so embarassed back then, being with the poor city drunk's son. Pitied by half the city and despised by the other half. Finding freedom only after moving into another city and never coming back. He tells him that, and by the twitch of Castiel's eye, he can tell he striked.
He curled in the crook between Dean's stomach and legs and started purring; the only way of saying “thank you” he could think of.
He turn himself, showing the man his left calf, and, even from this half twisted position, he doesn’t miss the surprised gasp that leave his mouth.
"Dean.. Dean, look at me." he says firmly. If Dean's thoughts are going that way, there is no time for softness. "Do you actually think I'm being held here against my will? I know I could go wherever I want, i just have to ask.  I'm staying here because you're my family, and I love you.
Fate wanted them to find a blood bank not too far from there and, once his hunger  had been seated, Benny fell death asleep in the car, leaving Dean alone for the rest of the trip.
he had said one afternoon while they were lying in bed, almost nonchalantly, like it wasn't a big deal.
Time's over you chicken, when he comes back, I'll be here, and you better not fuck this option up this time, cause next time I won't be this merciful with-"
he knows what she means. She continues. “But I think I really started to take notice when I was maybe eight or ten. I had a crush on this girl in my class, her name was Annie.” Charlie smiles, remembering. “It obviously didn’t work out.” Dean chuckles, nudging her.
. Dean takes another sip of his drink, attempting to swallow his fear. Instead he’s left with a small pit forming in his stomach.
“Jack caught a butterfly.” Cas explains. Dean peers into the glass jar, and sure enough, there’s a small, brown butterfly opening and shutting its wings.
“Yeah, sorry I didn’t see you. Uh… I was busy, looking for jobs.” He lies. There’s no way he’s going to involve Jack in this any more than he already is. Jack nods.
“Just shut up and try it. I promise it’s good.” Dean’s taken back to a moment not so long before, when he was having Cas try pop rocks and cotton candy. Cas licks the cone, then pauses thoughtfully.
Dean attaches the hose to the pipes and spicket. He glues on all of the nozzles for the sprinkler heads to screw into. He would have tested it today, but the adhesive needs to dry overnight. He had to stop Miracle from eating it a few times. At first, Miracle spent most of his time in the ditches, digging further and further down, which wasn’t a problem for Dean. But then he started gnawing on the pvc pipes, so Dean had to bring him inside for the last hour. Tomorrow he’ll add the sprinklers and test them, and if it’s good to go, he’ll bury it he pipes and add the timer. After he cleans up his tools, he heads inside for a shower, done for the day. He sees Cas and Jack in the dining room, coloring.
Dean stops. Is this the problem? Is he all squeamish because he knows his dad wouldn’t… well. John wasn’t homophobic… was he? Dean remembers him making comments every once in a while, but, surely he wasn’t actually
“What? No. Maybe- I, I don’t-” Dean hates stammering, but he can’t help it in situations like these. Cas sits, listening intently, waiting for Dean to explain.
Cas was awake. Cas never went to sleep. The constant flow of tears down his face had overwhelmed him. He’s never had to deal with this before. He’s been upset, but it was never this heavy. This… deflating. He hugs his pillow close to his chest, squeezing his eyes shut, hoping that will somehow dampen the wells inside him, beckoning for the streams of tears to trail down his cheeks. But it brings no relief. This pillow isn’t as comfortable as the one he’s gotten used to resting on in Dean’s bed. It’s not as soft, or welcoming warm. Cas isn’t frustrated by the lack of sleep as much as he is by the lack of guidance. Of direction. He’s spent hours racking his brain for a way out of this, but knows it’s only up to Dean now. Still, he finds his brain refuses to wind down, or forget about the events that took place a few hours before. So Cas turns on his side, staring at the wall in front of him, stuck in between action and inaction. Thought and after thought. Wondering if Dean ever meant any of the things he told Cas before it all erupted into ruin.
“Is he yours?” She asks, pointing to Jack with the hand that grips her child’s. Her tone is less one of curiosity and one of judgement. More of a challenge than a question, really. Dean can feel his blood start to boil. Cas is tugging his arm ever so slightly, and Dean, in a split moment of either insane brilliance or stupidity, grabs Cas’s hand, shocking both Cas and the woman that stands next to them.
“Mm. How?” Dean mutters, not entirely sure what Cas is referring to, but far too exhausted to try and figure it out.
“You usually fly? Wait- Cas, how long have you been doing this?” Cas looks down, feeling something, shame, or embarrassment, perhaps.
. He grabs his comforter, wrapping it around him, and taking it with him into the hall, as he makes his way into the dining room. He hears a sharp chuckle from the table.
“Awww.” Jack says, scooping up sand in his hands, running it through his fingers. “But I don’t want to go.” Cas rises from the bench.
“Hey, Buddy. Good morning.” Dean manages, ruffling his hand through Jack’s hair. Jack peels away, and grabs Dean’s hand dragging him into the kitchen.
“Everyone says that like it’s a curse word, but in reality, he was just a man.” Cas says, crawling up to the top of the bed. “And his name wasn’t pronounced like that. ‘jee-zus’. He wasn’t caucasian. He was born in Bethlehem. It was pronounced ‘hey-zoos’.”
“Her loss.” She rolls her eyes at him. He continues. “So usually you’d have to know pretty early on if you’re not straight.” Dean says. Charlie furrows her brows.
” Dean exclaims, barely above a whisper, “You almost got stabbed, you know that?!” Dean points his knife at Cas, before slamming it down in his nightstand. He rubs his eyes with his hand, laying back down on his bed.
“Jesus, Cas, just take this and shut up.” Dean grabs another pillow for himself, and sighs out of frustration.
“I suppose. Here, let me show you.” Cas proposes, “What emotion are you feeling right now?” Dean looks slightly taken aback by the question, but answers it.
“And when he does, we’ll have everything prepared for him. Amara and I have agreed to make all the necessary changes together while Jack grows up, so that by the time it’s his turn to take over, he won’t have to change a thing. In fact, think of it like closing a chapter of a book, the book being the story of Chuck.” Billie proposed, “That way, Jack won’t have to insert himself into the story. He can be the God he was always meant to be, and save humanity like he always hoped, without making the same perilous errors as Chuck. Amara and I are already in the story, but Jack doesn’t have to be.” Now, Dean could’ve only thought to ask one thing.
mean compassion. I… I mean empathy, and I don’t know, Cas it’s hard to explain.” Cas doesn’t seem to understand Dean. A moment passes before Dean has an epiphany. “Wait, wait, wait. I got it. I know exactly how to explain this.”
“Dadda fell asleep. But Charlie showed me her… her… um… her game.” Dean loves the kid, but it’s excruciating trying to listen to him try to get through a sentence sometimes. Jack started calling Cas “Dad.” A few weeks before. It was weird for Dean at first, hearing Jack call Cas “Dadda” is like a reminder that there’s a being depending on the funny guy. But at least Jack hasn’t tried calling Dean that yet. Wouldn’t want to break the kid’s heart when Cas moves out, taking Jack with.
“Depends on the memory. For example, killing Mary, your mother. He probably won’t remember that until he’s in his teens or early adult years. When he can process that information properly. But memories like who you are? Those will come a lot sooner.” Amara replied. Sam nodded his head.
“Thank you.” Amara said, once settled back into her prior form. “Now just one more thing before you give me that power, Jack. You know what to do.” Jack nodded. This confused Dean. He didn’t know there was a secret phase two and a half! Then he heard it from behind.
“He spent all morning following it around. He finally caught it on one of the fuchsia buds.” Cas explains. He turns to Charlie.
Dean thinks. He fights a smile, taking another sip of water. “Just try one bite. If you don’t like it after that, I won’t make you eat it.” Cas offers. Jack sniffs at it again, but still refuses. Cas looks to Dean for help.
“Um… well, I guess that sometimes, you… kind of… pray… in your sleep.” Dean is taken aback by this answer, which he was not expecting.
“Like… I don’t know. Things.” He pauses. “Sometimes things happen, small things, that I didn’t really notice before, but when it all adds up, it seems… I don't know. Like I'm helping Cas raise Jack, right, that’s normal.” She nods, encouraging him to continue. “But like, that’s also a thing people who aren’t just friends… that couples do. But, that doesn’t make it weird that Cas and I are doing it, right? But then there were the nightmares, and I would sometimes go out, alone at night. Ya know, taking walks, getting my mind off things. But then Cas started coming along, he couldn’t sleep either, so we started driving around, and playing games. And having his company was… nice, but I dunno. It feels different. Or maybe it doesn’t, and I’m just making it up. Does that sound insane?” He continues before she can really answer. “It's insane, right? Like if you didn’t know Cas and I, you would look at that and say there’s something I dunno… romantic about it. Or something.” She nods.
“Yeah… me too.” He says, glancing back at the bunker himself. This makes Cas feel a little better. He’s not alone in this. But he’s still worried.
“Well, after you…” He trailed off, but started again, trying not to lose it. “Lucifer and Michael killed each other, Uh… Jack took Chuck’s power, and brought everyone back. He brought back Billie, and he gave Chuck’s power to Amara, who became ‘Life’ instead of just the darkness, and she turned Jack into…” He pointed at the toddler, who was preoccupied with climbing the stairs to the door, one at a time.
“It’s kind of funny,” Dean started, “doesn’t he look like Cas, a little?” As Dean said his name, tears threatened to claim paths down his cheeks, but Dean hastily blinked them away before they had the chance. Sam looked back at Jack.
“Yeah, why don’t you color outside?” Dean wants to keep an eye on him, last time he caught Jack trying to eat the crayons, he damn near had a heart attack thinking he was gonna choke on them. Jack grabs his box of crayons and a piece of paper, heading down the stairs. Dean walks behind him, helping him take them one at a time.
“You know, dream about the future. Figure out what you want. Maybe it’s the apple pie life, maybe not. But wherever it is, figure it out. And then go for it.” Sam advises, “You deserve it.” And with that, Sam gets up and leaves Dean alone. Dean raps his knuckles against the table, thinking. Trying to make sense of it all.
“No, Cas,” Dean gives him a look that portrays annoyance. “Have you ever heard of the expression ‘heart of gold’?” Cas nods.
“Yeah! It’s a flower. It looks kind of like…” Dean thinks for a moment before pulling out his phone, plugging “chamomile” into the search engine. He hands Jack the phone, which is now littered with images of the flower.
“Gimme one good reason not to kill you again.” Billie forced him on his knees with the powers from her staff.
“Ugh, I don’t know. I think it went okay, I was super super nervous though. And a lot awkward.” She explains.
“Just like Spider-Man.” Dean offers him a high five. Jack returns it, and walks back into the living room.
“But you want something..?” Cas half asks, half states, as if he’s getting a read on Dean. As if he’s Dean’s shrink.
“Thank you.” Cas takes the pillow from him. It’s finally quiet. After a few moments Dean feels himself about to drift off, when the bed shuffles. Cas is scooting down, so he’s curled up at the foot of Dean’s bed, so as not to disturb him. Dean rolls his eyes. Cas is the most stubborn being on the frickin planet.
Dean wasn’t expecting anything intriguing to pop up as a result, but then again, he wasn’t expecting a lot of things to happen these past few weeks that have happened. He reads the top link:
“Angels, mostly.” Billie answered. “The angels went too far this time,” She explains, “we need to put some measures in place to make sure that doesn’t happen again.”
“That explains why his mom’s a b-” Cas shoots him a dark look, and Dean catches himself. “A very nice woman.”
away. And you always give up on things before trying. You never give yourself the benefit of the doubt. I’ve never seen you do that. Not once. Throughout all the years, I’ve seen you fight vampires, ghosts, even God! And you always come out on top. But you know the one monster you’re never willing to face? Your own demons.” Sam stands, “You’ve spent so many years helping me through my crap, Dean. And you know what? It’s my turn. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend there’s not something eating at you. For once, we don’t have something to fight, or save, or kill. We can deal with this stuff now. So please, Dean, let me
“Jack is going to take both of our powers. That's why he’ll be life, death, darkness, and light.” Amara answered.
“Maybe?” What was sorrow is now replaced with something else… not exactly anger… frustration. “So you
“What, about Jack?” Dean asks, still not prepared when Cas meets his eyes again. Dean’s never been really good with this whole vulnerability thing.
“How did you even hear me? These walls are cement. Literally, cement.” Dean inquires. Cas was not prepared for this question. Cas feels his cheeks grow warm. He averts his gaze from Dean, who only moves to face Cas, in an attempt to read his expression for an answer. Cas has no choice but to meet Dean’s eyes.
“Crazy 8’s? What are you, a child?” Dean scoffs. Sam raises his eyebrows at Dean, not changing his mind. Dean reluctantly deals each of them a hand of 8 cards, setting the rest in between them.
“Hang on, Buddy, you gotta let it cool down first.” Dean says. “You gotta stir it, and blow on it like this.” Dean lifts the spoon, blowing on a small pile of Spaghetti-Os that spill from the sides of the spoon.
“You keep sending me mixed signals! One second, you’re upset because someone mistook us for a couple, and the next you’re holding my hand in a park! One minute, we’re stargazing and splitting cotton candy, and the next you’re pushing me away. One moment, we’re watching a movie together, and the next you can barely look at me. One night, we’re… kissing on a bench, and the next, you pretend that I don’t exist!”
Dean startles awake, thrashing around, wrestling his blanket as if it were a monster. When his eyes focus, he sees Cas staring at him pitifully, the same yellow-tinted book in his hand. Dean can’t make out the title. Dean sighs, laying back down.
“Dee, look!” Dean takes the paper from him. It’s one big rainbow. And under are a bunch of multi colored scribbles that Dean can’t decipher. “It’s me and you and Cas and miracle!” Jack explains, pointing at the splotches. “And we’re all eating ice cream!” Dean kneels down, pulling Jack into a hug.
. Not just any random “boy” as if he was in the seventh grade and just found himself kissing boys. Dean’s never done that. If he had, boy John would have ripped him a new one.
“I’m sorry, Cas, but this… it’s not going to work. I never meant-” he stops himself. “I’m sorry. But I can’t.”
“It’s not completely dark.” Cas nods toward the window, which has a small slit of moonlight spilling onto his pages.
“Nonetheless, I don’t want to do that anymore.” Dean rises, pacing. “I don’t want to drag you through my problems anymore. It’s not right. It’s… it’s toxic. Narcissistic. And-”
. Dean wasn’t prepared for that. It’s silent for a moment, and though she says nothing, Dean knows Charlie too well. He decides he’s already dug himself into a hole, why not jump into it? He’s just going to pretend this whole conversation never happened anyway.
“Mi-wah-call!” Jack exclaimed, using grabby hands to communicate that he wanted to be set down to pet the dog. Dean stood, staring, not being able to process his prayer incarnate. He reached out, unable to control the well of tears in his eyes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. Dean grabbed the Trenchcoat with his hand, realizing that what he was seeing was real. He pulled Cas into a hug, his tears escaped his eyes, and flooded down his face. A few seconds passed, and Cas went to pull away from Dean.
“Hmmm. I dunno, I think I kind of always knew, in a way, without knowing. Does that make sense?” Dean wishes he could say no. He only nods in response. At least he
“Don’t mention it, I’m kind of a genius.” Dean jokes, taking his hand back. When Cas doesn’t laugh at his joke, Dean grows concerned. “Something’s still wrong. What’s on your mind, Cas?” Cas looks Dean in the eye, sending an unidentifiable feeling through Dean that he was not prepared for.
“You’ll be missed.” Charlie says. “We’ll be sure to grab extra.” Dean nods, and the timer goes off. He grabs Jack’s lunch, stirring it. Jack stands on the tips of his toes, hands on the counter, trying to peer over. He’s what he lacks for in height, he makes up for in determination. He tries climbing the cabinet, impatient.
Dean feigns his unconsciousness, ignoring how Cas’s exhale tickles the hairs on the back of his neck. Dean shuts his eyes, trying to slow his own breath enough to look like he’s fast asleep, which is difficult, since his heart is beating at a thousand miles an hour. At least he wasn’t the one with Cas wrapped in his arms, though it may have been easier to escape without raising suspicion. He feels Cas’s arms slide off of him, and the bed shifts as he stands. Dean doesn’t dare move. He sees the shadow of Cas pass him through his eyelids, silhouetted against the light in the room, as he opens and shuts the door, leaving Dean alone. Dean waits a few moments before opening his eyes. Sure enough, Cas is gone. He rubs his face.
“Oh… gross!” He gets up, running to the kitchen for paper towels. He wipes the sticky mess from his hand, and returns to the couch to clean the mess. He scrubs the spot with soap water so it doesn’t stain, and takes a seat further away from the spot. There’s not too much room on the couch, and Dean’s arm brushes against Cas’s. Dean tries to ignore it, but about ten minutes in, decides it’s better for him to move it so it’s spread out on top of the couch behind Cas. Dean moves his other arm up for extra measure. There. That’s not so suspicious. Dean almost doesn’t even notice when half an hour later, Cas starts nodding off, head slumping into Dean’s shoulder. Lucky for him, Cas turns his head another fifteen minutes later, so he’s no longer resting against Dean. Dean feels the spot on his shoulder grow cold in the absence of Cas, but the relief flooding through him knowing there won’t be an awkward moment later in the film is enough to make him forget about it. Cas managed to wake up just before the final scenes. The next Movie begins automatically. That’s the beauty with streaming services. Dean grabs the remote, ready to switch it off, when Cas stops him.
“I’ve never… well what am I supposed to do?” Cas asks. Dean starts laughing. Cas squints at Dean, tilting his own head in confusion.
“You don’t remember?” Dean nods no. “I think you said ‘woah dude, your eyes are, like, really blue.’ or something like that.” Charlie answers.
“Did you just bite into it?” Cas asks. Dean nods. “I believe that is something akin to psychopathic behavior.” He says. “Doesn’t it hurt your teeth? Do you have a brain freeze?” Cas asks. Dean waves him off.
“Does it really matter?” Dean asks, extending his arm to try and grab it. Cas only pulls it further out of reach. His eyes narrow.
“Have you ever tried zucchini?” Cas asks, patiently. Jack nods his head no. “Then how do you know it doesn’t taste good?” Eileen and Sam, who have finished their pizzas, get up and leave, sensing an oncoming tantrum.
“I’m making smoothies.” He explains, returning to the kitchen. A few seconds later, a dreadfully loud grinding noise erupts from the kitchen. Cas drops his head back down onto the table, the sound of the blender overstimulating his brain, which feels like it’s pounding against his skull. A few moments later, he takes a sip from his mug, scrunching his face in disgust.
This time the trees around the forest bench grow arms, pulling Dean away from Cas, as he falls from the cliff into nothingness. Dean wakes, still feeling the branches wrapped around him. He slowly begins to realize that those aren’t tree branches, but Cas, who has somehow managed to tangle his arms around Dean, like a hug from behind. Dean weighs his options. He could try to detangle himself from Cas, and risk waking him, which would be embarrassing for them both. Or, Dean could just fall back asleep, and wake up later after Cas is already gone, and pretend this never happened. He tries to decide which is better, Dean successfully slinking out of Cas’s arms, so Cas doesn’t even know it ever happened, or staying and leaving Cas to think Dean never had a clue. His stomach fills with dread, when Cas inhales deeply, stirring awake.
He scrambles down to pick them up, scanning the surrounding aisles to make sure no one else noticed. He feels his face get hot, and his stomach twists. He shoves the books back into place, and darts out from behind the aisle, hugging the “ultimate guide” to his chest. Luckily, no one else seems to have noticed his little misadventure. He manages to sneak off to a small corner with a table to read.
“Don’t leave. You still have more to say, I can see it.” Cas rises, approaching him. “You’re scared,” he peers into Dean’s eyes, which are filling with the tears he can no longer fight. “You’re afraid I might… be angry at you, or push you away. Don’t be. I won’t.” He points Dean back to his spot. “Just tell me how you feel. All of it. I’ll listen.” Dean returns to his seat next to Cas.
“So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?!” He shouts into the fake mic, making exaggerated expressions into the mirror at Jack, who is laughing so hard, his face is turning red. He turns the mic to Cas, who reluctantly sings along.
“Oh, look! You guys are twins.” Dean says, before turning Jack back around, and dropping him into Cas’s lap. Cas plays along, and wraps his blanket around Jack, as if to shield him from the cold outside temperature. Jack giggles louder, tapping Cas’s arms with his hands, chanting.
“That is the best tea I’ve ever had!” He tells Jack, who beams with pride. Dean would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little proud that Cas liked it, as well. He tries a sip. It doesn’t taste exactly like how when he was a kid, but it’s enough to bring a warm smile to his face. He checks his watch. 6:30 pm.
“Ohhhh, Baby, can’t do this to me, Baby, just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!” He starts head banging along to the guitar. He starts drumming against the wheel, “Nothing really matters, anyone can see. Nothing really matters, nothing really matters…” he looks at Jack through the mirror, smiling at him, and the two finish it together.
“I already told you, man, it’s not worth it. It’s not. I’m fine. Just go back to sleep.” Cas thinks for a moment before responding.
“Dean. Wait.” Cas commands, before Dean is able to swing around the corner of the hall. Dean stops, glancing at the floor. Cas approaches him. Dean’s heart jumps, unsure of what Cas is planning on doing. Cas stops, standing barely a foot away from him, a solemn look on his face. His crystal blue eyes burn into Dean, who finds he can’t bring his eyes to look away from them. “
Dean has made BLT sandwiches for all of them, and even Charlie snacks on one. Jack crawls up on his chair, a sippy cup of grape juice in front of him.
“Thanks.” Dean’s learned to just take the compliment. They find a place under a shady oak tree. Jack curiously picks up an acorn and tosses it as far as he can. “Careful, Jack. Here. You’re dripping. Eat first, play later.” Dean says. “Cuz if you drop it, Miracle will eat it.” He nods toward the dog, who Cas is currently tying to a low enough hanging tree limb. They picked up one of the small ice cream cups and a water bottle for him. Cas pours a little bit of the water for Miracle, who laps it up quickly. Cas returns to Dean and Jack, and Dean passes him his cone. Orange sherbet. Dean takes a bite out of his own ice cream, which is chocolate raspberry truffle. Cas smiles.
“About normal, I suppose.”  Dean scoffs at this answer, amused. He takes a sip from his own mug full of coffee. Sam sets Cas’s mug in front of him. “Thank you.” Cas smells something fruity… like pineapple. “I smell pineapple. Is that normal?” Sam laughs.
“Bullshit, Dean.” Sam says, knocking Dean’s arm off him. “I’ll take back what I said about Dad, when you can look me in the eye and truthfully say that you’d let Dad raise Jack the way he raised us.” Sam points at Dean.
“Are you gonna play? Because I’ll just pack this whole thing up if you’re getting bored, and then we can play a real game like Texas hold ‘em.” Dean says.
“Hey, Dean. We’re all downstairs trying to solve a mystery, care to join us?” She asks, passing him to get a glass and fill it with water.
“Aw, dang! I would, but I should really finish up with the sprinkler today so Miracle has a yard to run in again.” He says.
“Yeah, I’m sure your response definitely helped to de-escalate the situation.” Cas says, sarcastically.
After Dean emerges from his shower, he heads to the kitchen. Today is the perfect day to make sun tea. Especially since Sam is gone and can’t make fun of him for it. Dean learned from one of Bobby’s friends. Another hunter who was passing through while Sam and Dean were staying with him. Her name was Vanessa. Dean couldn’t have been older than nine or ten. He saw her placing the pitcher of tea outside and he asked why. She explained to him that “sun tea” was the best tea ever. Showed him how she made it, and let him try some when they had dinner, which Bobby helped her cook. Dean still remembers to this day thinking that was the best sweet tea he ever had. Jack waddles in as Dean’s finished filling up a pitcher with water.
“Not today.” Is all Dean can manage. “Not yet.” And the silence that spills over the room lasts the whole night.
What Cas didn’t anticipate was Dean having multiple nightmares in one night. This time, Dean’s screaming is so agonizing, Cas feels as if his head will split open. He leaps out of bed, shaking off any remnant of sleep that had overtaken him before. He checks the time again. 3:26 AM. He hastily makes his way to Dean’s room, rids his dreams of fear, and returns to his own bed, his body feeling heavy. Maybe he’ll try that coffee substance Dean drinks unholy amounts of in the morning.
“I’m just… worried.” He looks at the bunker behind him, toward the direction of Jack’s room. “I’m scared.” He corrects. Dean follows his line of sight.
“Cas! Stay with me, Cas, please.” Cas rises, once again flying into Dean’s room. This time, Cas was already awake, staring at the meteor shower in the sky outside his window. He had been keeping track of all of the astronomical events that are taking place this year. Especially now that it’s starting to warm back up outside again. Oddly, tonight wasn’t the peak of the April Lyrids, but Cas chanced upon seeing a meteor shoot across the sky during another bout of insomnia around a half an hour ago. Since then, he lay awake, staring outside the window at the night sky in hopes of seeing another one. Cas hopes to be able to show Jack a “shooting star” as many people refer to it as. But right now, his main focus is on bringing Dean peace. Cas wonders if Dean is aware that he prays during his nightmares. Or if he remembers his dreams at all. He hopes against it, ignorance is bliss, afterall. And Cas knows that if Dean knew about it, he would become embarrassed and insist that Cas not waste his power on something so insignificant. But to Cas, this is exactly what his grace is for. If he can’t help those who he loves, what’s the point of having his grace at all? However, he knows this solution to Dean’s nightmares won’t last forever. Eventually, Cas’s grace will diminish, and fade away, with only enough remaining to sustain his wings. The longer he stays out of heaven, the more he finds himself depending on human things to sustain him. Food, water, and sleep. And he knows that staying on earth will age him, unlike his brothers and sisters who remain in heaven. As Dean’s cries turn to silence, Castiel flies back to his room. This time, Cas crawls under the covers on his bed, falling fast asleep.
“Sam and Eileen left for a hunt.” Dean explains from the couch. “Vamps in Oklahoma. Should be back in a few days.”
“That’s called guilt-tripping, Cas. Not cool.” Dean hears a page turn. “Well if you’re not gonna sleep, then give me back my pillow.” There’s a beat before Cas responds.
“But he’s back now. Jack brought Cas back.” Sam reminds him, as if Dean was somehow oblivious to the fact.
“Woah! Slow down, Cas!” He approaches Cas, who is no longer adding sugar to his coffee. Dean laughs, “Don’t dump it all in, next thing you know, you’ll have a sugar crash!” He grabs the sugar from Cas, shooing him away from the mug on the counter. “Let me.” Cas grabs the ends of his blanket, pulling them together so he’s warm again, and waddles back to his chair, defeated. He watches from the table, as Dean empties the mug into the sink, and refills it with fresh coffee. He then uses a small spoon to scoop a few mounds of sugar into the mug, stirring it. He then goes to the fridge, and grabs the milk. Cas watches as Dean pours the smallest amount of milk into his drink. He stirs it, then brings the spoon to his mouth, taking a sip. He nods his head, satisfied by the concoction before him. He brings it to the table, and sets it in front of Cas. Cas takes a sip of the sweet drink. “Better?” Dean asks. A smile creeps across Cas’s face. He likes this very much.
“No, Dean, he didn’t.” Sam now stands, his own chair scraping against the floor. “You know how I know? Because I see the way you are with Jack. It’s different. Dad was a revenge-obsessed bastard who put his own kids’ lives on the line. He handed you a gun when you were 8 years old.” Dean stands slowly, to add emphasis on his next words.
“No, its-” Dean stops himself. If he had to talk to anyone about this, it would be her. Charlie is a lesbian, so she would know all about this stuff, right? He lets out a breath. “Actually, you’re right. There’s something that’s been bothering me, and I just can’t… I can’t seem to figure it out.” She nods.
“What was that, seven?” Sam asks. “So the storm should be seven miles away.” He pulls out his phone, looking it up. “Okay, so apparently it’s every five seconds, which means that this storm is just under two miles away.” Sam explains.
“Haha! Hear that, Sammy? I am the king of coffee. Coffee-King, right here.” Dean declares, pointing at himself. Cas’s attention is called to a sleepy toddler, who has just entered the dining room, a blanket pulled over his head, just like Cas. Dean picks him up, grunting as if Jack is growing heavier, which he usually does to make Jack feel like he’s somehow growing up quickly.
“BILLIE!” He started after her, “YOU BITCH. YOU DID THIS TO CAS! YOU BRING HIM BACK, YOU HEAR ME?!” With a wave of her staff, Billie sent Dean sprawling on the grass.
! And he never should have treated Dean like that. Never. No kid deserves to go through that. To think his own father hates him for everything he is. Even the parts of himself he won’t show. Dean feels tears stinging his eyes. And when he wipes them away, he notices the pipes are completely buried. He pats the dirt with the shovel before tossing it on the ground. And with it, he drops the facade. All of it. Everything he’s buried about himself comes to the surface. He wipes his brow, looking to the sky, a bright shade of orange, dotted with pink clouds. He hears a chair scrape behind him. Jack is at the patio table, scribbling something on a paper. Then he turns, seeing Dean watching him. He scrambles out of his chair to show Dean his creation.
“I’m still getting sleep. I’m going to outlast you. You’re suffering far more than me. Soon enough, you’ll become annoyed with my presence, or the nightmares, and cave.” Dean has almost forgotten what led to this nightly ritual.
“Yeah. Dean and I are just gonna go get some ice cream, but if you wanna stay here instead, you can. We’ll just eat it all for ourselves.” Dean has to bite back his smile, following Cas, and turning his back to Jack.
. Dean had gotten so used to the nightmare with Billie and Cas and the Empty that he somehow forgot that other nightmares do exist. He sighs, trying to rub the images from his eyes, but no matter how hard he presses against his skull, he can’t be rid of the sound of Cas screaming.
“Jack, Sam and Eileen worked really hard to make this yummy pizza for dinner. It might hurt their feelings if you don’t try it.” Jack reconsiders the plate in front of him, but still refuses to eat it. Now Cas tries to reason with him.
“Of course, when I said that, I hadn’t realized how terrifying of a thought it actually was for any of us. I’m starting to realize now, this may not quite be a ‘piece of cake’ as Dean often says.” Miracle licks Cas’s hand, begging for more pets. “Anyway, that’s the story of how we beat god.” Cas tells the dog, petting him, “I hope I didn’t bore you.” The dog yawns, and lays at Cas’s feet, rolling over to expose his belly. Cas hears a door slide open behind him.
“I understand.” He turns his head, peering at Dean. “Dean, of course I’ll be here. I’ll always be here, no matter what happens. That’s what I promise.” Dean lets out a sob that he didn’t know he was holding. Cas pulls him into a hug. “Dean, I will never leave you. I’ll always be here to help you, always. You know that.” Dean lets out a shaky breath.
“I’m good. A little nervous, I have an interview at three.” Dean cocks his head in something akin to pride.
“It’s not just any compassion. It’s ‘Castiel CompassionTM.” Cas furrows his brow, signaling that Dean has lost him yet again. “Think of it like this, what you have isn’t just regular old compassion, or empathy. It’s like it’s your own special compassion and empathy. It’s like… it’s like god had a bowl, and in it he put in kindness, compassion, loyalty, all of those good things, but then he added ‘extract of Cas’ to make it extra special. Like it’s its own thing. It’s different. It’s different because it’s specific to
“Look, I'm just saying I don’t want to take advantage of you. I can’t tell if this,” he grabs Cas’s hand. “I can’t tell if this is what I want, or if it was just me coming to terms with who I am.” Dean releases his hand. Cas nods, understanding. “Cas, I can’t tell you what I want, because I don’t know what I want yet. You want to know right now, but I can’t tell you, because I don’t know right now.” This seems to hurt Cas. “But, I do know what I need. I need to figure it out. And…” he looks down at his hands. “And I need you. I need you here, because I can’t… I can’t do it alone.” He looks at Cas. “I don’t need you to do anything, and I don’t want to try anything with you, but… I just need you here, man. While I figure it all out.” Dean feels Cas’s hand rest on his shoulder. His grip is firm, but gentle.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled, “I’m Dean.” Jack’s face then twisted in confusion. He pointed his finger up at Dean’s face, poking just under his eye.
” Dean doesn’t click the link. Instead, he just tries to process what he just read. Dean knew that some people existed that liked both, but he never assumed that there were nearly enough for them to get a whole category on their own. He continues reading the other fine print.
"Oh! That's new! Mister Dean-faithful-to-my-partner-Winchester turning down an offer of sex. I can't decide if I should feel flattered or disappointed."
He put some flyers around just to make sure he wasn’t stealing someone else’s cat, but when no one contacted him, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had in fact grown quite fond of him during this little time, and he would have been distraught to give him away to his real owners.
"Please, just stay here for a night, we can talk like old friends and see what we missed of each other.
He had started soothingly rubbing his hand along Cas’s arm without even noticing, and the man had leaned towards him looking for comfort. Cas nodded.
But you needed your space, all those years without one word from you, I swear I would rather have had one call in wich you told me I was suffocating you, that you had other plans for your future than the silent treatment you reserved me. Because at least I would have known it was over, you would never came back to me.
Castiel would still spend a lot of time in his cat form, too fond of scratches on his belly and naps under the window, but would also prepare dinner for them both, and they would have real conversations, not only one-sided monologues on Dean’s side, while eating it.
“Are you here alone?”  the man asks. There is still a glint of mirth in his eyes, but, at the same time, he’s scanning the crowd as if expecting someone to pop up any moment and snatch Dean away.
While he speaks, Dean unconciously thightens his arms around Castiel's figure, and his forehead drops on top of soft black curls.
Silence settled between the two men, only interrupted, halfway to the bunker, when Benny suddenly begged Dean to stop at the first hospital. "I haven't eaten in years, and, for as much as I like you, I could rip your throat out right now. Let's go find some blood bags."
I was no one, I had lost all hope, I was just a stray cat waiting for death, and you showed me happiness again. I learned to appreciate the little things that happen to us, and I learned the real meaning of family.
Dean would come home after a long day at work, and he would find his cat, stretching after his countless hours of sleep, greeting him with a bump against his nose.
If a facial expression could say “are you fucking kidding me?”, the one the cat was giving Dean now was definitely the perfect example.
“Stay still, Dean. I’m trying to sleep” A sleepy voice said from beside him, while a hand softly poked him on his forearm.
"Well, for starters, you're not high, or having an orgy" he says matter-of-factly, "and since there are no impending missions that require my supervision i thought i could just.."
Yet, he would recognize him anywhere. There is no way to forget the man which face is printed on the back of your eyes, vivid like a mark.
Before he could grab the mug to take a sip, he found himself squeezed in a bone-crushing hug, the former cat whispering thank yous like a mantra in the crook of his neck, leaving Dean unable to do anything but to hug back.
“Dean, I’ll try to explain, but you need to calm down. Please, you don’t need to worry.” The man got up from the bed, one hand still clutching the sheets, the other raised in the air as if trying to approach a growling dog.
"Sam! A pleasure seeing you again! You don't need to worry, i mean no harm to your brother. We were just.. remembering the good old times? Tell him Dean, we were having so much fun!"
They would eat together, and then watch something on the tv, Cas curled over Dean’s chest, purring like a kitten.
"No no no Cas!" Dean mentally kicks himself for being so fucking emotionally constipated to not even being able to finish a sentence withouth summoning Cas's anxiety. "I'm still okay with that. You're not the problem, angel.
Their meeting had been something completely unexpected, but Dean now couldn’t even remember what was like life before adopting Cas.
"Why, does that make you feel bad? Where has your though exterior gone? Has New York softened you? I thought you didn't care about us after all. After nine years, one is left to wonder.."
“Apparently he wasn’t happy of a work I had done for him, and decided to settle the score. You stepped in in the right moment.”
“Sam is not stupid; I think he’ll figure out those can’t all be odd coincidences. And we could tell him, one day.”
"Well Sam, if you don't mind, i'd like to stick around here for a bit, before i sort things out, and I think you have bedrooms for an army in here, but mainly, I want to see the two lovebirds faces tomorrow morning when they'll decide to join us again."
"Don't mention it baby, it's alright. And who says the night is over? We still have till dawn to make this night worth something, don't we?" His sly voice matching with his hands, suggestively wandering below Dean's shirt. "Unless you want to sleep here on the floor?"
Dean is surveying the crowd, breathing in the feeling of happiness and belonging that this day specifically can give him every year, when his eyes fall on the prettiest angel he’s ever seen.
Dean had asked wide-eyed, falling abruptly back into reality form the state of drousiness he was in.
There was a shift in the air, and when Dean looked up, again the blue eyed man was sitting beside him.
I know I'm not the best Cas. I'm stubborn, and relentless, and I feel like I'm not giving you all the attentions you deserve. You're human now, and how am I helping you? To cope with all this shit you took on drugs, and all I do is run around the camp barking orders.
"That's right! You better not forget that." He point his index finger in the middle of Dean's chest to emphasize his statement, and then he lowers his head again to resume their previous position.
Wait a second. I’ve just read this book, the main character is an angel called Castiel, what do you say of this one?”
What he doesn't expect though is to Castiel to go near him during the reception to ask him if he's okay. He is uncertain and embarassed, but honest under all the external layers of harsheness he put upon himself. That did't change much in ten years.
It's been a long road since they were 16 and getting their first tattoo in the basement of a party 'cause they were punks and wanted to change the world.
He didn’t even stop to think about the fact that he had just called him “baby”. He had called him like that for a whole year, after all. It wasn’t his fault he didn’t knew he was human underneath that cute cat skin.
Sometimes I like to stretch my legs, these legs, so at night, when I’m sure you’re deep in your sleep, I shift back and.. take a walk in the kitchen or.. sleep.  As I said, you kinda sleep like a bear. Last night I must have been too tired to notice you were waking up.
The drive was shorter than he had expected, and when he arrived there he saw him: cheeky grin and crooked hat, sitting on top of an abandoned car.
Last time I made it very clear my place was down there, but apparently someone thought it different.
Every night, Cas sat on the table while Dean spoke about his day, making them dinner, and then, when finally heading to bed, he would snuggle beside him, a soft and warm ball of love he would pet until falling asleep.
"Alright! Alright! I got it angel! If I fall asleep here not even one of your japanese massages will make me walk tomorrow."
“I.. I am a shapeshifter, Dean. I was born human but one day I got bitten and I transformed into this animal form.
"Thank you Dean, you're a real friend. I'll waith you here."Benny added before he could end the call.
Dean has a flower crown draped around his neck and a blue, purple and pink badge that says “I’m proud” pinned at his t-shirt.
