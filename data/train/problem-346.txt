What’s long leave?
“Why?” John asked and they didn’t pretend to think he was asking about why a fifteen-year-old addict would need to learn how to give blow-jobs. They weren’t that naïve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dear god-“
Hamish opened his mouth to scream and then suddenly the man was leaning forward and stuffing something in his mouth. It tasted like cloth and when Hamish moved to pull it out, he realized his hands were tied.
“We don’t really
“Mr. Mycroft Holmes?” it asked, a she, and she was in her early thirties. It was a soft voice, a sickeningly sweet voice and he knew exactly who she was seconds before she said it.
“I did,” Hamish nodded, a bit caught off guard. “You-“
“Who was that man on the phone? Mycroft, you need to arrest him, he may have attacked him-“
“John, look!” Jordan suddenly interrupted, tugging on John’s sleeve, and he quickly turned to note the bulls-eye in Jordan’s target.
She was so earnest. Sherlock knew that if she asked for space, or time, or even to never talk again, Joan would give it to her.
Now, at sixteen, she feigned sleep when he opened her door, both of them knowing she wasn’t fooling anyone, but Mycroft only sighed, whispered a soft ‘good-night’ and closed the door behind him. Something in Sherlock felt loose and unbolted so she rattled around in her night table for a sleeping pill and swallowed it dry before turning over and trying for good dreams.
John spotted a swatch of curly black hair in the middle of the lake and smiled at the sight of Sherlock sitting cross-legged on a waveboard by the slide. John lifted one hand and waved. The boy hesitated a second, as though unsure John was waving at him, before tentatively waving back.
“Don’t be upset,” Sherlock brushed off, reading his mind. “Nearly everyone is.”
“Sherlock, my first time was shite, and I’ll be damned if your first time isn’t perfect,” John promised, reaching up one hand to push back Sherlock’s hair.
“Please John, they all
“Up you go,” he ordered, helping Sherlock on the stairs and into his bedroom. Sherlock could feel John’s hands working on his jeans and then his shirt before he was in his pants and being led into bed, John’s hand gentle in his.
“I’m gonna go make sure he’s okay,” John said to Sarah, noticing how very
Hamish puzzled it out. “So I have a mommy too?” he asked and John paused, unsure.
The sound of sirens cut him off and then an ambulance pulled up alongside, a man in a paramedic’s outfit jumping out and running over. The second he was within range, Hamish stopped gasping and bolted, running until he could hide behind the man’s legs.
Lily snuffles like she’s agreeing and Sherlock suddenly wants more than he ever has in his life. And then Lily opens her eyes and bursts into tears, bawling loud enough to wake the neighborhood and Sherlock screams for John.
And when he walked on stage to greet his “cousin,” he glanced out into the audience to find his parents, covered in what looked like mud mixed with blood, sitting proudly in the third row.
“What’s up?” John asked, tugging at the sweatshirt he’d pulled on as he’d left the bunk.
“Sherlock pick up your phone! Sherlock please, I’m scared to death right now. Can we please just talk about this?”
“I never told you,” Sherlock said softly, his words a tremor on John’s skin.
“Not a bad likeness,” Sherlock grinned, leaning in closer. “I assume that’s me; he did my curls wonderfully.”
“John,” Sherlock had to stop this inane ranting.
Joan was waiting for her, just as she’d suspected, by their usual table. She looked surprised when Sherlock sat down, then hopeful, and finally drawn as she took in Sherlock’s overall appearance.
Harry nodded, oblivious to the wordless exchange of dirty thoughts the two counselors were having above his head.
And the voice in his head that always said
Hamish tucked the folded bills into his breeches, useful things really, and hugged his fathers one last time. “Bye,” he murmured, letting John kiss the top of his head for a minute. “Thanks so much for coming.”
Sherlock begged but her brother met her eyes and held her gaze.
what anyone else thought that it blew him away and filled him head to toe in pounding love that rushed through his ears and lit him on fire.
“I think so,” Hamish confessed, adjusting his rucksack so it sat more comfortably on his back. He took John’s hand and the two of them left the school grounds, waving goodbye to Mrs. Emily. “Mrs. Teacher said she’s gonna send a note home to all the parents once she figures out all the beetles. But she types even slower than you so I think it might take a while.”
“John,” he said and John looked up, his face flushing.
“Sherlock-“ Joan tried, stepping forward, and Sherlock held her hands out in front of her, terrified.
They arrived at Sherlock’s apartment just before ten. Mycroft wouldn’t even be home yet, he worked awful hours on the weekend for overtime pay, and Joan refused to leave Sherlock alone.
All my love, always.
“Go home, you spaz,” she grumbled and Joan let out one of those giggles Sherlock was starting to find herself working for. “Eight am, by the office?”
“Goodrington ma’am?” the driver asked from the front and Victoria nodded, pulling out her usual business newspaper and opening it up. Cynthia took out her sewing and the two sat comfortably next to each other, pointedly ignoring their children.
“Why not?” Sherlock shrugged, studying John’s face. “I was a 7
“I adore you.”
“Then I suggest you go to the bathroom,” Sherlock said evenly,
But it's also incredibly time consuming. Anyone who has moved can tell you how much energy and time it takes, especially when you're moving internationally. It might take weeks till I'm settled, it might take months. And in that space, I don't want to leave anyone hanging. The truth is, I could keep writing this forever. I have enough ideas (war stories) to do this till I'm 90. But time is a trickier thing and I don't like the word hiatus. So this seemed like an okay place to end.
and John obeyed, jumping over the seats to lay down across the back seat. Unceremoniously, Sherlock ripped John’s jeans and pants off. John had barely pulled in a breath before Sherlock took him in mouth and John shuddered.
“Ah yes, just a year younger than my Mycroft,” Victoria nodded. “What are your plans for after Uni? Mycroft has been offered a very prestigious position in the British government you know.”
“Jesus,” John swore, turning red. “You’re gonna get us killed, Sherlock!”
too little space. “They’re flying him in tonight.”
Sherlock groaned and strode over to the connecting door. He’d told John never to use it but obviously such restrictions didn’t apply to him, right?  “That was the dinner bell-“ he started, opening the door and then stopped at the sight of a shirtless John Watson.
Sherlock had no idea what that even meant. “No,” he found himself saying and John nodded. Right answer then. Was it perhaps a reference to Sherlock’s own, actual weight? Did people charge admission by weight to these things?
“Mum, I’ll be okay in London,” John promises, kissing her. “I couldn’t leave this city.”
"I think I'll get Pa to make him say yes," Hamish strategized. "If my A-levels are good it could be a reward, you know?"
Sherlock looked over at Joan sat beside her. Those blue eyes still held fear, and nervousness, but also something patient and unsure. Joan didn’t know, Sherlock realized. Not completely. She suspected, clearly she’d suspected for a while, enough time to set up this elaborate r
Sherlock hadn’t expected to feel so wiped out, standing by the exit and waiting for the car to come. And yet he was practically falling asleep on John’s shoulder, towel in hand.
Sarah was the first girl he tried to date who didn’t look like Sherlock. That did not last long and not for the first time in his life, John wished you could make yourself fall out of love. It didn’t help that everyone and their mother thought they were together, the yarders included.
“I got you something, for the next time I come back.”
As it was, his parents burst in after only twenty. Hamish was still draped in the orange shock blanket a medic had unloaded on him after checking him over and he watched John’s eyes immediately narrow to it as he rushed over.
I just wanted to say, cause I feel like i don't say it enough, that you guys are the best. The wind beneath my proverbial sails. The Jack to my Rose (I'll never let you go). xoxoxo
“When you first knew that you liked Papa, on that Valentine’s Day did you give him a card?” Hamish pressed.
"I came as soon as I heard," he gasped out but Sherlock only smiled gently up at him, one of the rare, real smiles that reached his eyes that he always seemed to save for his family.
86 days.
I don’t mean about that.
“Yay!” Hamish cheered as his father set him down, oblivious to the questioning looks his Papa was giving his Daddy. “Can I go play now?”
It was a slow sort of kiss, soft and gentle, and Sherlock sighed into it, sitting up to wrap his hand in John’s hair. John’s thumb traced back and forth across Sherlock’s cheekbone as he kissed him, smiling all the while.
“You’re not ready. Trust me. You had your first kiss months ago. These things take time.”
“Hamish Watson,” he repeated. “My Daddy and Papa are famous de-de-detectives,” he stuttered, tears slurring his words.
“Hamish-“ Sherlock started and then cleared his throat. Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Greg and Sally take a step back. “Are you upset with me?” he tried again and John squeezed Hamish’s hand. The boy shook his head quickly, watching his father through calculating eyes.
They banter so
They spoke in tiny increments. Little things, like the weather, their plans. Once, a big thing, like when John told Sherlock he wanted to be a doctor. That had been a highway night, they’d been resting by the gravel edge when John had shared that detail.
Counselors were not only allowed but encouraged to swim with their kids, help keep them under control. But John had a feeling that if he went in that lake, he really wasn’t going to be focusing on his kids. And yet, the idea was ridiculously appealing.
“Which is?” Richards bit out, desperately trying to stay dominant in the conversation and failing miserably.
“I only have one nice suit, you poncey bastard,” John says as his breath hitches and he doesn’t move out of Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock thought a minute. “I’m sure Annemarie wouldn’t object if we-“
“Don’t cry Sherlock, please.”
“Here is your bloody piece of evidence,” he snarled, baring his teeth. “Now if you’re done undermining my husband and I in front of our son, in our home, kindly GET OUT.”
"Want her to have grandparents?" Sherlock filled in, never one to shy away from unpleasant thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
*phone call- 2 am*
130 days
He gazes down at this soft thing, the most vulnerable creature he’s ever seen. She lies hot against his chest, breathing out little puffs of air that tickle his face and make him unbearably happy for no reason.
John detached himself from Sherlock in time to see Harry Watson jump out of the back of the silver Chevy in white shorts and a Metallica tee, helped down by Mycroft in his usual tailored suit, the two of them making an odd pair.
John sighs. “Picked up on that, did you?” he says, sitting on the couch, not asking how, not denying. Sherlock wanted him to deny it so badly, he would have believed it. John runs a hand through his hair, breathing out through his nose.
“Bull’s-eye,” John said softly, looking at Sherlock in newfound wonder.
“I forget how much of a kinky bastard you are sometimes,” John laughed. “You have such an angelic face, it looks so weird when you say those things.”
“If it was not for that man, I have no doubt I would be very drunk and very unhappy in the cesspools of London. And instead,” she smiles down at Clara, who squeezes her hand. “I am six years sober, and never going back.”
“Welcome to middle class,” he smiled and Sherlock shook his head.
“How young?” Sherlock asked.
“Our son has a girlfriend,” he whispered, a bit heartbroken and John rubbed his back.
There was a beat of silence before Hamish mumbled, “He went to Cambridge.” Neither of them bothered clarifying who ‘he’ was.
John laughed and then looked at Sherlock, freezing. “You’re serious,” he said in shock, eyes widening.
“That may actually the best we have on such short notice,” he rationalized and Sally looked scandalized. “Do either of you have any experience dealing with an abused child?”
“Of course.”
“You’ve apologized to me.”
tolerate this anymore.
Mycroft led him to a guestroom, one of the smaller ones with a single bed and green walls. “I shall bring you a shirt; wait here,” he explained and Hamish was already bounding across the room, jumping wildly on the bed.
“Of that I have no doubt,” Mycroft said, getting up. “It’s John Watson I worry for.”
"You're taking your day off on Wednesday," Sherlock said silkily, looking down obscenely at John.
“I’m sure to hell he doesn’t.”
He was sitting on the edge of the ambulance wrapped in an orange blanket when his Papa ran into the scene. The paramedic has given him something to help with the pounding in his head and a nice lady had wrapped the blanket around him when she’d seen him shivering. He had red marks on his wrists but he was otherwise unharmed.
Hamish said nothing, only dug his fingers into Sherlock’s thin tee-shirt and whimpered. It was the whimper that woke Sherlock up and he moved to stroke Hamish’s head before he realized what was wrong.
Joan’s eyes were lit up. “You are brilliant!” she cried and then bent her head down with a quick “sorry, sorry,” as the library hushed them. “This is amazing,” she tried again in a softer tone. “All we need to do is write up a petition, get record of this from the public state board meetings, confront Richards and he’ll be forced to do the right thing!”
John kept his mouth firmly shut, covering a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and starting to swab at the cuts and burns.  Sherlock hissed as the cleaner made contact with his skin and bit his lip to keep from yelling.
Are you pouting?
I could spend hours just looking at something and I would never be bored. It was the most glorious thing John.
“Are those my boys I hear?” Cynthia called from inside and John followed Sherlock into the den when Cynthia and Victoria lounged on the couch. Cynthia got up to hug John and Victoria spared them both a smile from above her magazine.
“You really think I want you-“ Sherlock started in her cruelest, harshest tone, but captain Joan Watson would not back down.
“No!”
“No!” Hamish screamed, mashing his fists against the floor.
“Fuck you,” John says, dangerously, standing up. “You bastard, you have no idea how bad it was out there. How hard we had to cling to anything, any
“Hey guys,” he smiled and the fourth graders cheered at him. “We’re gonna split you guys into groups of six to each raft. Every raft will have a counselor and all three of us lifeguards will be on the water with you to help if you need it. Sounds great?”
“Barely,” John reminded him. “Look Sherlock, this isn’t our business. We stay out of it. Got it?”
“Better than I expected,” Sherlock crowed but John cut him off.
They go back to the Holmes flat in Mayfair. They’re barely through the front door when John is up against Sherlock, backing him painfully into the door.
“Margaret,” Angie’s mom introduced herself, shaking John’s hand. “Thank you so much. Children- you turn around for one second and they’re gone.”
“Fine, aright,” Sherlock gave up, giving Hamish his full attention. “You’re more like your father every day.”
Sherlock finally could not
John stumbled a second before handing Jordan his towel. “Sorry, you wanna go swimming with them?”
He expected the woman to look shocked, or surprised. If he was honest with himself, he was hoping for a little frightened. He was not expecting Sherlock to arch one eyebrow and smirk.
“Your mother doesn’t live here anymore, does she?” she said instead, lashing out, changing the topic like a car changing directions mid-freeway and damn the casualties. This time, Joan’s hand did pause on her ankle but it started up again before she could swallow her own tongue, back and forth like nothing had changed.
“You taught them to me,” Sherlock said, like that was the most obvious thing in the world, and John’s face lit up like sunlight.
He doesn’t know what he feels when he looks at Victor. If he never met John, he would call it attraction. The boy moves in carefully calculated steps, graceful to the point of an art. He’s like Sherlock, not as brilliant but just as sharp, just as cutting.
“Well, did you?” Anderson pressed, his gaze flickering to where John laughed.
"Because, I'm taking my day off Wednesday," Sherlock smirked and John's eyes widened in the near darkness.
The door swung open with a soft groan as if to punctuate that statement. Sherlock stood with a wicked grin and pocketed her picks. “Practice,” she shrugged, ushering Joan into the dark hallway and shutting the door behind them. “I used to do this all the time at my old school.”
“Hey Sarah,” he grinned at the archery counselor. He’d met Sarah the year before, but in a year she’d gotten near gorgeous, in a pair of jean shorts and white tank-top. “How are you?”
Sherlock didn’t say a word. He got out of bed and untangled himself from the sheets, letting himself stand in John’s line of sight. He wasn’t in his Eton uniform but instead in jeans and a gray tee-shirt
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer and then closed it, considering his husband a moment. Finally, he said, “Yes. He would like a train set instead.”
It was like Déjà vu. Sherlock could vaguely make out familiar landmarks. There was where he’d talked to Irene, there was where he’d first found alcohol, and behind that curtain was the bathroom where-
They had just finished pulling the bed out and setting up the sheets and pillows when Chloe came out of the bathroom. She was a warm pink and her hair looked an entirely different shade, like filtered sunlight. She had been wrapped carefully in a pair of Hamish’s pyjamas, the two were roughly the same size, and Hamish proudly presented her with the cup of tea.
“John-“ he tried, a fractured sentence, and then a piercing ring cut through the moment.
“I mean, it’s not that I don’t find you attractive,” she babbled and honestly why wasn’t someone
, in his military-regulation haircut, his most tattered jeans, and a worn tee-shirt of Sherlock’s he put on after they shagged on the couch.
She shook her head, laughing. “Should have figured. If you wouldn’t kiss
It was a lovely letter.
“You’re not forcing me now,” Sherlock pointed out and Joan fell silent again. Joan knew enough, anyway, knew the basic shape of it. There was no point in hiding the details, it would sit between them forever, this lump of a secret, and who was she trying to protect? If Joan wanted to run, she had enough to go on already.
“He never told me shit.”
“Dad?” Hamish called out cautiously and John put a hand on his shoulder.
“I killed someone, Sherlock. Took a life like I was some kind of god, like that was my decision to make.”
her brain whispered, supplying the title everyone else in the school applied to them, and Sherlock realized just who made and joined feminists clubs. Lesbians.
Just a quick one for now. Kisses <3
“They actually rhymed day with day, such lyrical creativity, I see why this is so vital to my education,” Sherlock drawled but at this point it was only for appearances as she pulled back and led Joan in a twirl of her own. Joan beamed at her as though she’d done something really clever and Sherlock felt it hit somewhere low in her belly.
“Hamish love, bring Laurel upstairs,” his father called and he grabbed her hand, leading her up the stairs. Somehow, John had made the whole house smell like baked bread and spices and Sherlock had taken up position by the window with his violin, looking over casually as they walked in.
“I do apologize,” Sherlock offered. “I’ll try and make it better.”
“And Bart’s-“
At the Yard, Hamish strolled into Greg’s office without so much as a by-your-leave. John and Sherlock had prepped the inspector before, naturally, and he was waiting behind his desk pretending to be busy. He glanced up as Hamish barged in and lent him a smile.
“We can get real glue-guns-“
“I think I’ll survive,” Sherlock drawled but John wasn’t satisfied.
“Hey!” a voice chirped out by her ear and Sherlock whirled around, arms raised protectively, right before they landed on Joan Watson’s chest. “Checking out the sign, are you?”
It hurt more than she expected it to. For one long minute it was like falling down the stairs and getting punched in the stomach all rolled into one. Her breath left her in a gasp and her heart-
So she was studying all on her own with Sherlock keeping her silent company as the genius fumbled her way through her poetry portfolio for English class. Stuck on a sufficient rhyme for ‘imbecile,’ Sherlock looked up to watch her study partner as Joan muttered to herself under her breath about chemical bonds at their table in the school library, tucked near the heater and still shivery-cold. Sherlock watched her for a long moment, noted the stress-wrinkles just there in the corner of her eyes, her chapped and callused knuckles curled around her pen, her bottom lip half bitten to bleeding, held in her top teeth as she worked.
“Forever,” John promised and as they kissed, the park applauded.
“Don’t your parents ever notice you’re not home?” Mycroft cut him off, glaring at his nephew.
“That sounds like them,” Hamish agreed and Annemarie began fishing through her jeans pockets.
“C’mon,” John urged, grabbing a towel. “Let’s get downstairs before they come looking for us and find Mycroft shrunk four inches.”
, like nothing he’d ever felt before, and he shuddered under John.
“Sometimes people do things they really don’t mean when they’re drunk. At least let him explain.”
John grinned. “I don’t know boys. This is a food party. And he didn’t bring a snack.”
“Go on,” he prompted and Hamish played with the wrappings on his right hand nervously, looking down.
to you alone.”
“Are you,” Sherlock froze before her nose proved her right and then wrinkled up distastefully, “high right now?”
“Fully charged,” Hamish promised.
“We are done playing around with our son’s life,” he said firmly. “Nothing is worth this.”
“Christ knows you should get started,” she advised and then got up, leaving John on the sagging couch, lost between the overstuffed cushions in a leftover cloud of cigarette smoke.
“Looks like John-the-Bear had an adventure,” John tried a joke and Sherlock spared him a small smile.
“Sherlock-“
The night they graduated secondary school, they got drunk on the floor of Sherlock’s room with a bottle of wine they found in the Holmes’ basement. They had two months until sixth form started but those months felt endless and John felt endless too, laughing on the soft carpet on Sherlock’s floor, staring up at the ceiling with wonderment.
“I am yours,” John promised, squeezing his hand.
“I just want a little water; fridge right?” and then proceeded to pull back and open the fridge.
“Hands in the air.”
“Technically, this is a bathtub,” Sherlock pointed out and John laughed against Sherlock’s wet skin. “Are you okay?” Sherlock asking, remembering he’d just effectively blue-balled John.
“Climb it, Tarzan,” Sherlock grinned and Joan giggled back at her. They stood there for a beat longer before Joan said,
“We’re gonna have to sneak into the house covered in come,” John muttered against Sherlock’s chest, who had chosen to drape himself boneless on top of the older boy.
-message deleted-
thing to prove we were human.”
“That would be wonderful, thanks,” she said, trying out a smile. It sat weird and Joan, appropriately laughed at it. “You can shower first though, I’ll finish up the letter.”
I have my own room?
“I think I’d like that,” Sherlock coughed, turning shy for the first time in his life, and John beamed at him.
John shuddered around him, never closing his eyes, and Sherlock could see the very moment he collapsed inward, and imprinted it in his mind, pasted it on every wall of his mind palace, nailed it to the door as his own personal thesis.
“John,” Sherlock started, letting his hands rise up from his side and settle on John’s hips, “maybe we could just stay home?”
Sherlock realized and could have smiled. He wanted to tell Mike he needn’t worry, Sherlock was hardly about to snatch any girls out from under him, but that didn’t seem like the best way to make introductions.
“It did,” John agreed, striding inside.
“John, I’ve investigated murders in these clothes. If they’re not scared of blood and brain matter, I’m sure a little dirt won’t horrify them.”
Sherlock?”
“Sherlock, you can tell me anything-“
That would have been the end of it, if Sherlock had not suddenly hissed and grabbed John’s shirt, yanking him into the alley.
“Leave me alone,” she ordered, curling in on herself. Why was Joan even here? P.E. was over for the day—classes were over for the day- but there she was in all her wet glory, still walking over to Sherlock by the sink.
The cab ride back was the hardest part. Leaving the hospital had been brutal but the cab had just reminded Sherlock of how alone he was. Cab rides after cases were stolen moments between him and John. Now John lay asleep in a hospital bed, a neat line of stitches across his stomach, and Sherlock sat in a cab alone.
Sherlock twirled him to the music, stooping down to whisper. “The first time I saw you, I was sure I’d never seen eyes as beautiful as yours. Like oceans,” he confessed and John smiled at him softly.
And she was still here. She hadn’t fled in the night or in the hazy morning after but was here, in Sherlock’s kitchen, laughing with Mycroft and cooking…pancakes?
And if they kept their fingers entwined between them, no one mentioned it.
“Yeah,” John said, unsure of where she meant to go with this.
They finish stitching the leg and John spends a few moments showing her around the medical tent.
At two on the dot, John slid silently out of bed and padded to the bunk door. He opened it silently, mindful of the heavy snores echoing through his bunk, and let it close with a small noise. Camp Baker was utterly deserted, but John wasn’t deceived. He knew patrols went around every hour or so to make sure counselors were actually adhering to the curfew.
“What are you doing tonight?” Sherlock asked him suddenly and John found himself able to focus, now that those gray eyes had moved up to meet his own.
“They told us you dug the bullet out yourself,” Sherlock asks, the image haunting him. John, crumbled and broken, hands deep inside himself as he tries to stop an inevitable progression to his heart.
John smirked fondly at the memory. “So you need to decide if it’s worth playing square games and giving up your pudding cup for Marcie to be your girlfriend,” he advised.
“May I have this dance?” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, his hot breath making the words far more sexual than they were already, and John shivered.
“I will,” Irene smiled back and disappeared with Mike.
“That’s it, hospital,” Sherlock ordered and John sighed. Every damn time.
It felt like they’d walked for
John laughs, little more than a puff. “Same damn shoulder,” he groans, trying to sit up, and Sherlock helps him, hands cold against John’s body. “Same fucking shoulder.”
“Jesus Christ-“ John swore as Sherlock clambered into the stall and it was all he could squeak out before Sherlock crowded him against the shower wall and kissed him breathless. Stunned, John could only open his mouth to let Sherlock in, thoroughly exploring him and it was Sherlock’s tongue alone that muffled the very pressing moans eking their way out of the poor counselor.
Sherlock was silent. That was his only defense now, his silence. Jim had enough to destroy him with as it was.
“John Watson?” a voice called above the music.
The train ride to the Woman’s Center was filled with that same, quiet tension. Sherlock had expected Marcie, or Kelsie, to meet them at the train but Joan had plunked in their tokens without waiting for anyone. Joan was only taking
“If you didn’t want to get expelled,” Sherlock pointed out, very reasonably she thought, “then maybe you should have just done your work on your-“
“What do you want to ask me?” his Dad's voice called out without even looking over and Hamish internally berated himself for even trying to be subtle.
“What matters is she’s safe now,” John replied after a moment. “And we’ll catch the bastards who did this. But we’re no good to her exhausted. Come to bed.”
It didn’t feel like a miracle. It felt like someone had snatched from his hands the only career he’d ever trained for. And wasn’t that just bloody Sherlock, keeping him alive when most nights he wished he hadn’t been wearing his thimble at all.
He probably would have kissed him, right then and there and damned the consequences, if the teen hadn’t said, “You needed something, right?”
Sherlock bent and picked Hamish up from his own curled-in position. His reaction was immediate- Hamish began raining kicks and fists on Sherlock’s chest and arms, wailed and screaming bloody murder. But Sherlock was stronger than him and he carried him off to the bathroom and held him tight between his legs, stripping him of his overalls and shirt.
“We’re kidnappers, you idiot! We can’t call the coppers!” he bellowed but George was already pulling out his mobile.
,” John cursed, head lolling back as Sherlock’s tongue sent sparks straight to his cock. “Fuck, baby, where did you learn that?”
He was having his wrists gently wrapped by his Papa “just in case,” and falling asleep against the side of the ambulance, when he saw his Daddy run up to their ambulance. “Sherlock!” his Papa called and then Daddy strode over, his long black coat billowing behind him. Hamish loved that coat.
That night it takes him a half hour, as opposed to his usual ten minutes, to put the gun down.
“I don’t think I have leave in December.”
“It’s not heavy like that,” Joan said once they’d peeled apart with an obscene wet noise between their mouths, petting back Sherlock’s curls from where they’d escaped into her eyes. “It’s heavy like deep, or serious or just fucking overwhelming. Like she’s everything to him. She’s his whole world.”
“Hey yourself,” he smiled back, self-conscious in his plane-ride trakkies and tee. “You’ve grown.”
“Did I ever tell you the story of how Vivi and I met?” Cynthia Watson asked over her red wine and Sherlock noticed Mycroft start to color. Suddenly, he was
“Sherlock?” he asked, “have we had drunk sex yet?”
“But I want to go on holiday with you!” Hamish demanded. Behind John, Sherlock was loading their suitcases into the back of a cab while Mycroft supervised.
"Patrick," Sherlock greeted, standing up and striding over to shake the nurse's hand. "How is he?"
“Sherlock this isn’t funny.”
“Sherlock, I’m gonna come,” he got out, his brain flashing warning signals as the technicians at his various brain stations put on seat belts and shut everything down.
It was almost too much, the tension of how good this was pressed against how bad she’d thought it might be. It couldn’t last, she figured, but Joan had a habit of catching her in those sorts of thoughts and coaxing her out of them willingly or otherwise. “Do women generally enjoy being called overweight in bed?” Sherlock said through a hanging breath, just to get her bearings, to contribute something to this mess of wonderful, and Joan left her stomach with a wet kiss before crawling back up to kiss her stupid for that comment alone.
“Yeah,” John confessed, even though it’d only been the once and he’d been the one on the giving end. But Sherlock didn’t seem to want details as he prepared his fingers.
“You should just join the team,” Joan offered one Thursday after practice. They were alone in the locker room, Joan always stayed later than the rest of the team to clean up. Joan was in the shower with Sherlock perched on one of the wooden benches outside, talking through the curtain to ‘keep Joan company.’
He’d watched his Daddy do this so many times before, it came as nearly second nature. In under a minute he had a messy but very black fingerprint slide. John, after being brushed off by a furiously blushing Sherlock, took it carefully as Hamish held it out to him.
But Sherlock only shook his head, watching the scene with eyes that John would never have admitted shone with unshed tears.
“I was nervous at my first house party,” John went on as if Sherlock hadn’t spoken. “You a lightweight?”
“Now who’s stating the obvious?” John muttered, backing up. “Now what?”
“But good,” she promised, and Joan leaned in to kiss her shoulder again.
Subject: He couldn’t play rugby, could he?
like a fucking taunt and John would go insane if he did not get to the bottom of this (and did not get the thought of Sherlock
With a performer’s air, she lifted the corner of the fence and it gave just enough for two, skinny girls to crawl underneath. She held it up for Joan, who shimming across on her stomach, and then followed her.
“- and you- Sherlock?” Joan finally paused, gazing up at her in concern but it was still there.
“I certainly wasn’t going to miss the indoors part of the evening,” she said back, feeling a bit unsteady and Marcie laughed a hint too loud- three beers in then.
“Of course,” Mike promised and they ran down the main road to the parking lot. Two white vans sat parked with a bunch of counselors hanging out around them. John spotted Sarah, chatting to Sally, one of the assistants in the nurse’s shack.
“Okay,” John says again and gets up. “It’s okay.”
“I want you to remember this,” Sherlock asked as John whimpered. The boy’s eidetic memory was paying off as he hit John’s prostate every time, the angle mapped out like geography in his head. “When you lie beneath the open afghan sky and burrow beneath hot sand, remember the feel of me, inside of you.”
“Alright then, less for me to worry about I guess,” John said and that cleared up absolutely nothing.
He hadn’t even thought about Nanny Hudson. He hoped George and Harry hadn’t been mean to her too. “Where’s Daddy?” he snuffed.
“Saw, yes,” Sherlock brushed off with that same ever-suffering look that made John feel incredibly small.
And that was how Sherlock found himself standing sullenly in the driveway of their expansive summer home with Victoria and Mycroft on either side of him, watching a small Chevy pull into the driveway. The sound of gravel under tires sounded remarkably what Sherlock was sure his face sounded like rubbed up against gravel.
Guys I love you. Like actual love. You are all the reason I update so frequently. Love.
“Imagine how loud you’re going to scream my name tonight, how badly you’re going to
His fingers scramble at the wound. He can feel the shell, lodged in his shoulder. Same
“Not funny,” Sherlock sulked and John parked the car, leaning over to kiss the offended boy.
“That I’m a different person now,” Sherlock said and John dropped the list, letting it flutter to the ground like any old harmless piece of paper and not the thing that almost took Sherlock from him.
“No, if you’re busy it’s not important-“
“A lot?” Joan filled in when Sherlock trailed off and she nodded.
“I love you,” John whispers, letting it fall into Sherlock’s curls. His poor, broken heart wrenches as he says it because he will never hear it back. He is destined and doomed to love a highly functioning sociopath who will let him fuck him senseless but never love him. And it ruins him.
“We never talked about it,” she said. “I always thought she must have known, but maybe she didn’t. He really was careful, until the end.”
It was on a Thursday, about a week after what John had decided to label “The Case of the Detective in the Bed.” They were sitting in their favorite tree, the great oak that sprawled out over the Holmes lawn. John rested comfortably on a branch, back against the trunk, while Sherlock practically dangled upside-down.
Sherlock sat silently and Irene sighed. “Oh, don’t be temperamental,” she chided. “I’ll just find out anyway. Might as well be from you.”
“No, we should get back,” he choked out and John laughed.
“Are you putting regular food consumption on the agenda?” she asked, incredulous, and Sherlock looked down instead at the table.
job and now-
“And your brother?” John pushed and Sherlock’s eyes opened lazily, like a cat’s, blinking in the starlight till they landed on John and made him hot all over.
can delete memories, facts, trivia, anything,” he explained, starting to pace franticly. “Ask me who the Prime Minister is. Go on, ask,” he demanded.
“Thank you Mr. Hamish’s Papa,” he said and Hamish turned his beaming smile on him.
An executive decision had been made that breakfast weas required, and Joan was stationed by the kitchen stove cooking the fourth round of eggs. Marcie was on bacon watch and Kelsie was passing plates around. Sherlock had been roped into chopping duty, and was stood by the kitchen counter cutting up potatoes to be fried. Someone had popped on a record while they waited for the news, and The Carpenters floated through the packed apartment. Sherlock caught herself humming along as she sliced her potatoes into perfectly neat squares, swaying just slightly to the music, the sun from the window warming her shoulders in Joan’s softest flannel.
“Well that’s not-“ Joan tried to protest but Sherlock kept going.
“Sorry Unc,” Hamish said automatically before he remembered he was mad and then moved to pouting. “How long do I got?”
“Sherlock, you are acting like a child! This is so immature, you have no idea. Be an adult and pick up your phone! Sherlock, you are better than this, you utter twat.”
“I’m not in your face, I’m in my tube,” Sherlock countered.
“Yeah, the den,” John put in and both men turned to look at him, still hovering on the stairs. “It’s empty,” he said, flushing, and they make their way over, closing the door behind them.
Sherlock said nothing, just turned around and ran. But that morning, as they sat around the breakfast table, the women chattering to each other, Harry and Mycroft planning some plot or another, Sherlock turned to John.
“It’s not hard Sherlock, just a lot of walking,” he assured him and Sherlock jumped down with the grace of a cat.
“I’m proud of you,” Sherlock conceded and he had the pleasure of watching Hamish turn beet-red down to his neck.
She teaches him breathing techniques. She teaches him how to roll out of a hold if John tries to strangle Sherlock in a nightmare. She teaches him how to hug without overpowering, how to silently call across the ocean. How to not push. He kisses her goodbye and tries not to cry on her shoulder. She gives him her cell-phone number and he promises to call.
“They called me ‘Three Playrooms Watson’,” he teased and Sherlock growled at him before they kissed and kissed long enough for John to forget about making dinner.
“I don’t know; I haven’t deduced her,” Hamish returned and Sherlock met his gaze.
They settled on the floor, John leaning back against Sherlock’s bed and Sherlock on his back, eyes gazing at the ceiling, making a point not to look at John. He’d heard that helped. He hoped it would.
“God, don’t say that. Please love, never say that.”
“I’m going to shower,” she bit off, and Joan nodded, standing unsure in the center of the living room as Sherlock walked the few steps and shut the bathroom door behind her. Alone, surrounded by the cool, white tiles, Sherlock just wanted to curl up at the bottom of the bathtub and fall asleep. But she made herself strip off her vomit-splattered clothes and shoes before climbing into the shower and turning it as hot as the water would go.
“Amazing,” Joan whispered, looking up at her and Sherlock was grateful for the poor light as she flushed.
“God, I missed you so much,” John moaned against Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock could have died, right then and there.
he thought, a tad incoherent.
“-and your Mum said we’re invited to your house in London for Christmas so that’ll be fun,” John was talking but Sherlock was only catching every other word. He kept watching John’s arms place clothes and it should have been the reverse, John should have been unpacking- moving in permanently.
Hamish slid into the empty seat on the other side of the café table, smiling genially at the man across from him. ”Sup, Unc?” he greeted with a wry smirk. His tee-shirt was wrinkled and dirty, his jeans were well worn, and the black curls he was so fond of were an uncouthed mess. It would seem revisions were well under way.
tell Mycroft about this.”
Sherlock crawled across the carpet to take the papers from her, skimming them quickly. “Not copies,” she murmured. “It’s two separate orders. Look, it’s not the same handwriting. The second person is clearly trying to copy but their F’s don’t have the same flourish.”
“I- Sher- can we-“ he stuttered as the soapy water acted as lube and Sherlock moved so slowly, desperately trying to remember what John had done last night to make this feel amazing.
But this was a soft dream, quiet and lovely, and it was with a lazy ease that he awoke to the hand on his shoulder.
“What movie?” Sherlock asked and John raised one eyebrow. He highly doubted the incredibly posh boy would enjoy whatever movie the camp wanted to show its kids.
“Right, yes,” the boy nodded, taking out a sign-up sheet. “Your kids are getting life jackets from another guard now, right?”
thing to say to Sherlock. Of course he wasn’t alright.
“Are you happy?” he asked and Sherlock shot him his ever-suffering-vexed-by-mere-mortals look.
“Is everything alright?” John asked, knowing that if Sherlock was behind him, he would be sighing, clicking his tongue at such a stupid question.
“Well, at least two of our boys are taken care of,” Cynthia smiled down the table at John and Sherlock and the two teens blushed in unison.
“- I agree, yes. We need to prove we’re not all show and no go,” Marcie was saying and Joan was nodding.
Hamish blinked. “No,” he breathed and John came over.
Dinner was a loud affair, especially for the Holmes household. Victoria Holmes was laying into John, asking him about his college plans.
Then she missed her period. And the one after that. That wasn’t what tipped her off, she was taking a mixture of heroin and ketamine that made the days blend together. Her father had loved her like that, wiry and willing to fight back so it felt like a victory when he took her. When the morning sickness started, Sherlock assumed it was her seven-percent solution acting up, so she tried to play with the measurements but she kept getting sicker, and bloated, and dizzy.
“I really don’t have that many people lining up for a snog,” Sherlock pointed out. “But you do,” he said carefully, holding his own hand.
Nobody spoke for a long moment before Sam said, “I think he can stay.” There was a chorus of “here, heres,’ and Sherlock was handed a bag of Maltesers. Thus settled, every boy turned to John expectantly.
Mary noticed. “Trouble in paradise?” she whispered and John groaned.
“I-“ he tried and failed, words escaping him. “I wrote you a piece. When we first… fought. I wanted to-“
comforter, clearly inferior. Besides, I know blue is your favorite color…“ Sherlock all but rambled as John helped pull him up.
“When did it happen?” Sherlock prompted, and they both knew he wasn't talking about the stabbing anymore.
“If you two are done traumatizing the children,” he said, holding back a laugh, and John and Sherlock let each other go reluctantly, twin blushes gracing their faces. They both sat back down, filling Sherlock’s small seat, since there was no way John was swimming against the current back to his own raft.
“Henry, Sam,” Sherlock nodded, once he’d reached them.
. With Joan came members of the dyke club- god, she needed to stop calling them that- and of them usually Marcie and Kelsie but, often it was just her and Joan. Joan seemed alright doing most of the talking but, when Sherlock got going about some idiot in her class or when she couldn’t stop her hands from fluttering about as she explained a new experiment she was planning out, Joan seemed quite content to just sit back and listen to her talk with a smile on her face.
“It’s
He whispered the last part; it was always a bad idea to mention the end of camp in front of the boys too early. When they got here, they were painfully homesick for a good week before they finally acclimate and had fun, only to go back home as camp ended. It was a rather vicious circle.
“Eleven and no arguments,” John settled. “Do you have money?”
“Tell me something no one knows,” John said, looking at him.
Ridiculous, Sherlock didn’t have friends. But he had to test, had to
“Still not sure what that means,” Sherlock laughed and then doubled over.
“Fucking hell, get your hands off me you poof!” someone yelled on the other side of the phone and Hamish heard what sounded like a kick to the ribs.
There was silence as the inspector drove off and then Sherlock turned to his brother.
“Harry, you were going on two at the time,” Cynthia started and John leaned forward, interested. “We were in Regent’s Park; I had you in a stroller. You were a rather adorable baby, you know. All brown curls-“
There was a suspicious looking bulge under Hamish’s duvet that would’ve taken Sherlock seconds to deduce but he purposefully didn’t look. In this, he would allow some element of surprise. Although, if the glue on his son’s hands was any indication, he would be getting something rather sticky and rather useless, yet inexplicably precious all the same this year.
“You okay?” John asked gently and Harry nodded. “Good. Now you’ll have a cool story to tell at dinner,” John smiled and Harry gave him a watery smile back.
“I’m glad you could make time to see me,” Mycroft smiled back, crossing his hands before him on the table. “I know you must be busy with tests.”
Hamish had gathered a shaking Chloe into his arms, sitting up with her in her bed. “Shhhh,” he eased, rubbing her back as she sobbed. “You’re safe here. The not nice evil men can’t find you here. My fathers are the toughest men in the whole wide world and my uncle Mycroft had more eyes than a Durga! Do you know what that is?”
“You know your grandparents,” Mycroft started and Hamish nodded gravely. “Well when your grandmother was still teaching, they weren’t home very often. We lived rather out in the middle of nowhere and your father was so much younger than me, I had to find ways to amuse myself. So I took up baking. I reasoned that if I loved consuming baked goods so much, I might enjoy making them.”
“Yeah, summer break,” John explained. “This is Sherlock.”
“But, I’m eighteen now and I’m going to Uni,” Hamish attempted, ashamed at how his voice shook. He’d faced down bullies and kidnappers cold-turkey but
Now it was Joan’s turn to look disoriented. “What?”
“Yeah?”
“Chloe’s shy, isn’t she?” John prompted gently. “She’s scared of loud noises. Coppers make her nervous. She had a very bad thing happen to her Hamish and she’s-“
“Let’s get you dressed, yeah?” Joan offered, with that same small, patient smile, and Sherlock allowed herself to be led to the bedroom. Joan found a pair of her pjs in a drawer and handed them to her.
“It’s sad,” Hamish said after a moment.
“When I was six years old I did an experiment on every tube of lipstick in the house,” Sherlock informed him casually as though they were not hunched around a bowl of his sick. “Learned how to identify lipstick by shade for nearly eight brands- hold on,” he excused and then vomited again. John looked away.
“Oh stop preening,” Sherlock glowered and then turned the page. “This Christmas, all I want is a new baby bro-“Sherlock froze, looking up. John met his eye across the table and with a swallow, he went on, “a new baby brother. Or a sister if you’re all out of brothers-“Feeling slightly sick, Sherlock set the letter on the table.
“Sherlock and I want to go camping,” John announced at breakfast. Harry had, mercifully, not announced her morning discovery to the table, but it was obvious from her rapid whispers and Mycroft’s barely contained snickers that she was recanting the tale to him now.
John looked up from his book. He’d been reading that book the whole summer.
“How did you-“ the boy tried and then cut himself off. “Of course,” he muttered and Sherlock tried not to preen. Hamish sighed and met his father’s eyes over the table.
“So you abandoned him?” John said sharply and he hadn’t meant to attack the girl but she stepped back, not meeting his eye.
-          John
“Spectional progress,” Hamish struggled, tongue tripping over the words.
on my to-do list today, didn’t think I’d get to cross it off so early,” Sherlock quipped and kept walking.
Sherlock looks at John. “I like her,” he whispers and John smiles back. Baby steps.
“Like this, Grammy?” he checked and she smiled indulgently.
She had a head wound, a new gaggle of girls who hated her and a possible concussion.
“I know love, I’m sorry. It was just very out of the blue.”
It was the bottle of lube, sitting innocently on the table a week later, that finally blew John Watson to pieces.
Hamish took the jab in stride. “So, I told them I wanna drop one. I really only need three and what with rugby and Trudy and sixth form play, I don’t think I’ll have time.”
John hung up and Mycroft stared at his mobile a moment before Hamish nudged him. “Are they coming home now?” he asked.
“Course I did,” John says and walks out. He sleeps on the couch. Sherlock doesn’t sleep at all.
“Listen very carefully, you little fucker,” John whispered, leaning in close. “That
“I thought I made it clear I didn’t want you contacting me,” Sherlock said in monotone from the bed and John’s insides twisted so tight he couldn’t breathe.
“One of us should go, to represent us and all.”
She was so lost in her thoughts, Sherlock didn’t notice Joan had caught her staring for several minutes until she blinked back to herself and found Joan watching her with a warm expression,
“I am the paradigm of seriousness,” Sherlock droned, walking into his room. Mycroft followed without asking and closed the door.
John finds him, hiding in the underbrush, and they raise their guns to meet each other. Sherlock knows he can’t shoot, knows John wants to shoot. Cocks his gun. John fires, a splash of yellow paint across Sherlock’s chest, covering his skin. And then John is on top of him and they’re kissing and Sherlock’s murmuring sorry’s into his mouth.
And the iceman’s heart melted.
Hamish’s hair held a light dusting of flour from the day of baking and his tee-shirt was caked in blueberry and apple stains. “Um…cherry pie delicious!” he cried out proudly. “So we multiply the diameter by pie and that’s the cherry- I mean circumference.”
was the unspoken word and both boys heard it, loud and clear.
He didn’t let himself bring up the argument that he slept very little as it was because it was the
and took out a sheet of paper. He handed the list to John wordlessly and John took it, reading it quickly.
Joan was still staring at her and Sherlock couldn’t read her, there was too much in her eyes so she said it again. “I wanted it because I look at you too, like that, when you’re not paying attention and it felt…ridiculous for both of us to be looking at each other the same way and neither of us doing anything about it so I did,” she said and it then, because she wasn’t sure it was clear, she added, “Something. About it.”
He hadn’t actually expected anything specific, just the generic blank stares of shock and perhaps a few tears. But Hamish only grinned at him. “Silly Daddy, I know Father Christmas isn’t real,” he disclosed.
The inspector gaped at him, eyes widened to just pupil. “How?” he breathed, staring at Sherlock like he’d just punched him.
“Intelligent people can do them in their heads,” Sherlock’s voice drifted in from the living room, dark as, well, a thundercloud.
Nina Gonzales was murdered, by her brother-in-law of all people, and by Sunday night all the details were being written out on a piece of drugstore paper by a triumphant Sherlock. Across the Bushwhick Public Library’s plastic table, a muddy and disheveled Joan was still smiling at her like she couldn’t quite believe it. Frankly, Sherlock was half writing to keep herself from staring back.
“Is not an advantage, I know,” Mycroft finished softly. “And yet, look at me.”
“Told you,” Sam whispered to Harry and was promptly shushed. Grinning, John went on.
“But you told everyone you were mugged,” Sherlock said.
“Peachy,” Sherlock smiled back and they kissed lazily, all soft touches and hazy sunlight. Slowly, Sherlock climbed on top of him, never stopping their kisses as their hands roved over each other’s bodies. John was just starting to properly wake up and give back as good as he was getting when-
she considered.
“And besides,” Hamish started, taking a large bite of his sandwich, as Mycroft had known he would, “who says no to Cambridge?”
“John Watson,” John introduced because he was polite and he wasn’t sure what else to do, sticking out his hand.
“Taps,” John corrected gently and four pairs of eyes swung around to stare daggers at him. Caught, the doctor held his hands up in surrender and Hamish went on.
“All the interesting ones,” Sherlock amended and John sighed.
Sherlock shook her head. “No they won’t,” she said and then pressed into Joan’s shoulder as a train flew past. “It’s fine. I don’t mind.”
“You don’t fancy
“Sherlock, you’re grinning,” Mycroft cut her off and she was. She hadn’t stopped grinning since Joan had walked out of school with her, given her a quick hug, and headed home. “Are you well?”
“Neither do you,” Mycroft reminded him but Sherlock wasn’t done.
“Yeah,” John said, standing up. “It’ll be fun. Chance to get out.”
“They looked properly in love and everything,” John hissed and Sherlock walked out of the alley.
“What if you don’t come back?” he asked, surprised as the question left his lips.
“You’ll wish you hadn’t,” he predicted and then sat back. For a minute they merely studied each other in the darkness, soaking each other in. John thought that if he tried hard enough, he could graph the slope of Sherlock’s cheekbones, keeping it his mind like a piece of logic to remember the lifeguard by. And then he lay down, gesturing for Sherlock to lie down with him, face to face, so their ankles could cross and their fingers could move between them, tracing patterns on flesh.
“No, it’s simply-“ Sherlock seemed unsure how to begin. “I had this desire, when you were small, for you to be a chemist when you were older. You seemed so interested in your father’s Gray’s Anatomy and you would sit and watch me experiment for hours- it calmed you down. Absurd and sentimental, I know, now can we stop?”
“Thank you,” John said gratefully. He glanced over at the children before whispering, “They found Chloe’s aunt. She’s coming in tomorrow.”
“Hello?” he asked, sounding a bit dazed to his own ears.
“I have some idea,” he promised, crawling up to kiss Sherlock.
“What flavor is it?” Hamish demanded.
Have you been practicing… you know. That thing with your tongue?
the alarm by the side of John’s bed went off and Sherlock realized he’d been cataloguing John’s breathing patterns for four hours as the morning sun had made its debut in the bedroom.
in my teeth-marks, would you like that?” John asked, before leaning in to make another mark below the first.
Later, after Mycroft’s left and they’ve showered and dressed, they go to the grave. It’s incredibly simple and classic, like the woman herself, with the simple engraving
He watched John replay that moment on the roof, their conversation that he must have replayed a thousand times, and winced inwardly. And then John’s eyes shot open and he looked near close to tears.
And for all of my fellow masochists who feed on feels, don't worry. This thing isn't over yet.
“No, of course not,” John agreed, heading out of the cave and through the fall. “He is, though.”
I'm terribly sorry! Don't worry though, John and Sherlock still have much to do. All my love- Shay
“I was moving to sit on the bench, as was she,” Cynthia said. “I offered her the bench and she was about to offer it right back when her little son looked at her and said, ‘Mummy, you should let her sit. She’s pregnant.’”
- Shay
“I’ll come,” Sherlock said quickly and Jim grinned.
Hamish did and John set to making small, slow strokes, calming the tiny child until his breath began to even and his eyelids fluttered in sleep.
“The man works for our government, he is not easily scandalized,” Sherlock notes but he gets undressed anyway, laughing into John’s mouth.
“It’s alright sir,” Anthea promised, standing. “I’ll finish it up. It’s just a bunch of signature work; I can do it in the car ride home.”
“John- I’m gonna,” Sherlock warned and John could have died, he had been waiting, hoping they could do it
The afterparty was at Kelsie’s house. It was a bring-your-own beer type of party and it felt like half the school had crammed themselves into the Petroni’s small apartment, spilling out into the hallway outside and onto the fire escape facing the alleyway. Sherlock was dragged in with Joan’s arm warm and heavy around her shoulder, the blonde already on her second beer since the locker room and carrying a pack of four more.
The esteemed members of the Bushwick High Young Feminist Club were celebrating loud enough to shake the city, and in the push and pull, Joan and Sherlock finally made their way across the sea of bodies to pull each other into a shaky hug that could have lasted hours. Sherlock breathed in and out and allowed herself to collapse into the strong hold of Joan’s arms around her waist and back, into the perfect smell of Joan’s skin that had become as familiar to her as her own, and into the promise of years to come bursting with music and friends and food cooked for her because someone loved her enough to see her fed. Sherlock breathed in and out and felt her own body and knew it was hers, knew it belonged to only her, that she could let others touch it and come close to her in pleasure and in warmth but it would never make her body belong to them. Her hands and feet and lungs and heart were hers alone, this beautiful transport that carried her brain and her mouth and yes, even her womb.
When Sherlock was in his junior year of college, and still in rehab, John joined the army. Sherlock never forgave him for abandoning him for a larger version of hell, even though he wrote letters home every week and visited on major holidays. And even though John never took the thimble off.
“And why is that?” Sherlock asked conversationally, holding the tiny cup up for Hamish to drink.
Sorry, didn’t mean to worry you. Call me when you have time. I miss you.
John couldn’t help the next question that tumbled from his lips. “Are you still?” he asked and immediately he knew it was the wrong thing to say and Sherlock turned on him with the most abusive look John had ever seen on a person, not since his father, and he could feel his stomach clench.
“You’re alright,” John said breathlessly and it was such a stupid
“With two kids!” Sherlock shouted after him.
John shrugged at Margaret and moved to follow Sherlock. “Sure love,” he smiled at him, gathering their shirts.
“She wasn’t my type.”
“Not if we feed it,” Sherlock suggested and before John had time to grab him, he’d opened the car and pulled out the cooler.
“Do you have your mobile?”
“I am,” John tells him, smiling, and they kiss, right in the graveyard. Sherlock thinks it would’ve made her smile.
“Didn’t feel appropriate,” John muttered and Sherlock turned to hug him better. He could feel his own heart pounding in time with John’s and before he could stop it, before he could remind himself that John had just told him about his terrible sexual experience and it was a
John’s fingers slide up and into him, pushing, stretching, scissoring, until he finds Sherlock’s prostate and
” John murmured and Sherlock looked at him confused.
“Then where?” Sherlock shot back, his eyes small fires in the blackened tent. “In a bed? In a hotel bed in Paris by the Eiffel Tower?” The genius sucked in a shaky breath and John unconsciously ran his hands up and down his thin arms, calming him.
Sherlock looks mildly disappointed. “John, I’m not some insatiable teenager who has to be buggered regularly or they explode. Lord knows, if I was just dating you for the sex, I would’ve left ages ago.”
“Daddy, can we have a cuddle-pile tonight?” Hamish requested fuzzily, nestling in closer and breathing in the scent of his Daddy, his fists lost in the folds of his massive coat.
Sherlock didn’t know how to explain to her that no, this was never how anything she’d even tentatively titled a ‘friendship’ had gone before and no, this wasn’t about brain or brawn and Joan was so much bigger and suffocating and electric than that but passionate words were Joan’s department. So she bought the snack that day at lunch, wax lips they could barely get their mouths around, and that seemed like enough.
“Don’t worry, you were still brilliant,” he promised and Sherlock looked at him with a mixture of awe and joy. “Well, goodnight then.”
“I missed-“ Sherlock tried but he suddenly couldn’t put words together as John’s breath ghosted against his neck.
It was Hamish’s cry that had John and Sherlock’s heads spinning towards the doorway.
“Can you stay quiet?” Sherlock asked but he didn’t wait for a reply as he wrapped his lips around John and the boy bit his lip to keep from crying out.
“Do you want something from me?” Sherlock asked suddenly and John froze.
of the poor counselor. John had the distinct impression that somewhere in that great mind of his, Sherlock was undressing him, pulling off his swim trunks and John couldn’t
“My pleasure,” he smiled, reaching out a hand. “John Watson.”
“Does that mean something? Because it’s not French,” Sherlock insisted, jumping down and following John to the car. “I should know, I speak French. Fluently. John?”
“Oh really? As far as I can tell, you did just as much as I did. How were your boys back in Afghanistan, John? Tight asses, good fucks?”
“And now, what?” Mycroft pressed, carrying the double boiler over to the sink and busying himself with washing it rather than make eye contact.
They didn’t hear the doorbell ring, why would they? That’s not their department. But the maid called up,
“Deliriously,” John grinned, and then he kissed Sherlock, all wet lips and damp fringe stuck to foreheads and hands clutched in the wet slivers of shirt beneath bulky lifejackets. Their noses brushed and John might have felt Sherlock’s teeth clink against his own but he could have gone on kissing the lifeguard forever if a loud “Oi” hadn’t come from the front of the raft.
John grins at him lewdly. “Shut up,” he advises and kisses him. They sleep in Sherlock’s bed, a tangle of limbs, sweating and screaming each other’s names in their dreams.
Three days of sitting in his room, running his experiments, trying not to notice John outside his window- exploring his gardens. John in the dining hall- laughing at a joke Sherlock whispered about Mycroft’s weight. John in the living room, his feet curled under him, reading a book- eyes twinkling as they skimmed pages.
before, unless it was at him. But John never laughed at him.
They cleaned up silently, dipping into the lake to wash each other with gentle hands, and then they climb out shivering, clinging to each other for warmth. They curled up in the summer grass, wrapped up entirely in each other, lying beneath stars.
“I couldn’t miss your graduation,” John murmurs against his hair. “It was meant to be a surprise. Are you surprised?”
“Yes,” Sherlock echoed, rubbing his hand soothingly down Hamish’s back through the blanket, rocking back from foot to foot in Hamish’s nursery, the room that had once held John so very separate from him. His fingertips felt over-sensitized from the rub of the fabric against his skin but he rubbed anyway. He’d amputate an arm, in that very moment, to keep Hamish from crying again.
“That’s why I’m here,” Lestrade sighed, wearied. “You need to stop sending letters to the Met.”
I need to get you more up-to-date on pop culture references.
of me-“
“John, you know I can’t-“ he said fragilely and John nodded, mortified. “I don’t…feel that way-“

Cynthia turned back to the table and finished. “Of course, that week I took a pregnancy test and found out I really
You’ll be bored in class too.
“I think we should name it Smokey,” John suggested as they walked towards the foods area.
The room was huge, with two beds, an on suite bathroom and a bathtub big enough for six people. They quickly claimed the bed closest to the balcony, which overlooked the sea. John couldn’t help grinning like an idiot as he changed into his swim costume, looking around at the room.
“In English, please?”
“Did it do anything for you?” Chloe asked tentatively and Hamish paused before shaking his head honestly. Chloe’s whole face relaxed in relief and she knocked heads with him.
“Hello Wendy,” Sherlock smiled weakly and John wanted to punch him again, like he had that first time.
At nine a doctor comes out and they flock to him like vultures on a carcass. He smiles at them and tells them.
“Sorry,” John said softly, his breath coming out in gasps. Sherlock shot him a cold stare before turning back into his room and closing the door behind himself.
“Your
“Look at you. I’d kiss you but I think you need to focus on breathing right now,” he pointed out, one hand reaching up to brush the sweat-soaked curls off Sherlock’s forehead.
Subject: Neither can you, you dead git
Hamish had taken trains out of kings cross station plenty of times. He’d taken photographs with the joke trolley stuck in the wall and he’d even stopped by the movie-set museum once with friends. But nothing had quite prepared him for walking through the manufactured hole-in-the-wall and into Diagon Alley.
“Okay here’s what you need to know,” John explained softly as he helped Sherlock’s hands find his hips and settle. “It’s all about pressure. Trying hollowing your cheeks if you can. Keep your tongue moving at all times. And above all- no teeth. For any reason whatsoever.”
“You don’t do that with me when we’re working, do you?” he checked and Sherlock did not take his eyes off the road.
“But not because of her, no. That would have been cowardly. It was because we hated the damn subject,” he joked and Hamish laughed, easing up. Mycroft looked his nephew in the eye and forced him to focus.
Year Eight was when John stopped going home altogether, preferring to spend it on street corners and park benches with Sherlock, or by himself if the boy couldn’t be bothered. He rarely was alone though; Sherlock had no reason to go home either.
“Yes right, got it,” she said and Joan smiled at her, an unsaid thanks in her eyes. “See you in a bit?”
Sherlock was hunched over the toilet, his thin shoulders sweating themselves through John’s tee. He retched as John entered and John rushed to him, kneeling next to him.
Sarah grinned at him. “The lifeguards are coming. They need towels and clipboards.”
“I’m just nervous about holding a protest here, right now with the soccer team so new,” she cautioned. “Let’s win something first, then we’ll have firmer ground-“
Joan seemed to come back to herself somewhere in the middle of Sherlock’s ill-planned speech and the smile that began to fill her face was unlike one Sherlock had ever seen. It was small, and private, and filled with so much, Sherlock couldn’t begin to dissect it.
“You didn’t listen to anything I said, did you?” Sherlock said, his voice incredibly fragile. “You didn’t arrest any of the murderers.”
Sherlock shot up to find Mycroft in his doorway, hands resting against the frame.
“Show me how,” he ordered, notching an arrow as he’d seen John do.
“They will soon,” he said, pointing to the mouth-shaped bruise forming on Sherlock’s collarbone and they dissolved into giggles, perfectly content in that moment.
“Will you be alright if I leave?” Joan asked, looking genuinely conflicted and Sherlock wanted to scream no with everything in her and held it back with only the bite of her teeth.
“Harry, I need Mycroft’s number.”
So maybe I got saccharine. And maybe I defied the laws of nature, gravity, and water currents. But was it worth it? Yes. The answer is yes.
Protests against the Vietnam War started already in 1955, when The US government was just beginning to get involved in the region. By 1972 there had been hundreds of protests almost every year, across college campuses and in major city centers. On November 7th of 1972, which was the day of the general election, protests against the war and Nixon (who was running for, and would win, his second term) were staged across the country, including New York. Feminist organizations were heavily involved in this protests, and you can read more about the complicated partnership between radical feminist groups and anti-war movements
Hamish puzzled it out. “Um, apple pies are too- so that’s pie multiplied by the radius squared!”
sat there with her.”
“We really need to-“
“How bout Daddy explains it to you as he puts you to bed?” he encouraged, ushering the two boys, one larger than the other, up the stairs. “It’s late.”
he reminded himself.
“Christ, who hangs a dead man from a tree?” John muttered.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John says, a tiny breath, as he holds the canvas.
Joan wad waiting for her with a massive hug. “Thanks for your question,” she said as she squeezed the life out of Sherlock. “It was so good. And your group’s poster looks awesome!”
“So that’s where Sherlock went,” Mycroft muttered and John laughed as Sherlock sulked out of the car.
The room went cold. Sherlock could hear her own heart, deafening in her chest, as it sped up. Joan’s hand in hers was limp and foreign and suddenly Sherlock understood. They weren’t here for Joan.
*phone call 3:45 pm*
John looked down at Sherlock’s outfit for the first time, his usual pressed pants and button-down. “Perhaps we should get you in something a little more… wearable first,” John suggested but Sherlock merely crossed his arms.
Hamish understood about every other word of his father’s sentence but he heard the sorry and he nodded soundlessly, bending in to kiss his father’s cheek.
“Remember, it’s a very delicate operation,” he cautioned, calling up the recipe from memory. “No jumping about while it’s cooking or you’ll end up with chocolate soup. Now go get eggs and a lemon. And see if I have bittersweet chocolate.”
“Sherlock, relationships aren’t scorecards. You don’t have to be
Joan paused and then sighed irritably. “Oh don’t pull this cliché with me,” she begged and Sherlock just stared at her. “Okay I admit, I’ve been a bit zappy these past few days but can we forget about that for a second and not do that whole thing where I offer to help and you refuse and I offer again and you insult me and then you finally give in? Can we just skip to the part where I help fix the bleeding wound on your forehead, you turkey?”
“Sherlock, I’m so sorry,” John cried, kneeling down next to him. “Are you alright?”
“Hey Uncle Greg,” Hamish called, aware the goons were watching his every move. As a precaution, he cocked the gun and suppressed a smile as both men drew back. “No, I’m good. School’s great yeah, thanks for asking. Just got home. No, I know my parents are out with Dimmock, they texted.
“Do you mean that?” John moaned into Sherlock’s open mouth, hands digging into the younger boy’s hipbones.
“Congratulations Hamish, you solved the case!” John cheered and Hamish preened for a moment before sobering and turning his gaze on his Papa.
Chloe stood, too-thin legs shaking slightly beneath her. “I will walk,” she announced, grasping Sherlock’s hand, and he led her slowly out of the building.
John laughed, relaxing back, and soon enough Kitty, a G221 counselor, came to relieve him. He stretched, yawning comically, and walked back to his tent. The counselor tents were placed just close enough to their kids’ tents that they could hear if there was any trouble, but far enough away that they could snore in peace and get away with it. It was practically a mini-vacation, the privacy of the one-person pup tent, and John relished in it, climbing into his sleeping bag.
John turned to glare at him. “Did you just ruin the movie?” he asked, not even close to angry.
Hey friends! I'm sorry this chapter took so long. I have some real good excuses but nOT GOOD ENOUGH
“Um, okay-“ John tried but he was cut off as Sherlock slid one hand around his hip and put the other one on the wall behind John’s head, trapping him. And then his mouth descended on John’s and everything faded because
I do expect that will change.”
“But you were a kid,” Victor reminds him and his voice is soothing, like butter. “You were still doing heroin. You were an idiot. Granted, the smartest idiot that ever lived, but an idiot. You couldn’t know.”
“Papa?” Hamish inquired cautiously.
“Partner, I have a good idea,” Hamish said, turning to his Papa. “Maybe we should bring the body to Aunt Molly for an auto-apo- so she can cut it open.”
She found herself distracted for a moment by the newspaper sticking out of her bag. She’d turned it to the obituary section during third period and read it all in fourth but something about it was still bothering her. Joan’s whistle sounded again and she shook herself and went back to her problem set as Joan’s string of curses grew longer and more creative.
“Shut up and kiss me,” Sherlock demanded, but John knew the teen was smiling. So he kissed Sherlock, hard, insistent, and with every ounce of passion he had in his arsenal, flipping them so that it was Sherlock’s back that thudded against the wall, Sherlock’s hand that had no choice but to grasp weakly at his shirt, pulling him closer, Sherlock’s tongue that he drew into his mouth, sucking at with such suggestiveness, it made the lifeguard gasp, open mouthed, into John.
“I think I’ll clean out the second bedroom today,” John tells him over toast.
“You imagined this happening?”
"Angelo's should be open," Sherlock offered.
“Did Daddy have any strange dreams?” Hamish pushed and John sighed.
Who loves you? I love you.
those condoms out of his head).
A voice in the back speaks up. “I think Jackson is.”
“Bart’s is dismal without you,” Sherlock tells her and it’s the nicest thing he’s ever said to her. She grins.
“Jesus Sherlock.”
Mycroft said, as if it was obvious.
“Shit,” John cursed, sitting up. “Hand me your shirt.”
sorry?” he asked incredulously.
“My pleasure,” John smiled and all was well.
“Didn’t mean you should stop or anything. Just pointing it out,” Joan said around a smile. She’d started following Joan home more after school, now that the cold had made it too unpleasant to loiter around their outdoor haunts. It was about the same it’d always been, only now Joan insisted on feeding her and they sat unbearably close to each other when they ate, a hazy sort of intimacy coloring the nights.
But this wasn’t that at all. No one here wanted to be men. They just wanted things to be fair. And what on earth was wrong with that?
Hamish was waiting by the microwave when the doorbell rang. With an almighty sigh, he started for the stairs and stopped short as footsteps pounded up to meet him. The front door swung open to reveal Greg Lestrade.
“What accent?” Sherlock glared, self-conscious but Joan only smiled.
"While this chatter is nothing short of stimulating, may I see my husband now?" Sherlock cut through and Patrick snapped back into professional, nodding.
“Alright then,” she settled in. “I was twenty-two. I was young and studying for my doctorate and very, very poor. I was looking into more loans and better jobs and it was difficult. A friend of mine suggested surrogacy; I waved her off. That was never really something I’d considered- carrying a baby for other people. I wasn’t even in a relationship myself; I couldn’t imagine pregnancy. But the idea was in my mind, you understand.
Maybe they’d all been going about thundercloud moods the wrong way for years. Maybe all one had ever had to do was just cuddle the genius.
Joan pulled back to rest on her knees, one hand still sitting atop Sherlock’s chest, rubbing the imprint of her ribcage through Sherlock’s shirt. She looked transiently beautiful, Sherlock thought, in a black tee that had been Harry’s and her denim overalls with the rusted buttons. Joan had let her hair grow out shoulder-length during the semester but she’d pulled it back into a ponytail when Sherlock had made eyes at her over the kitchen counter and they’d abandoned their snack to mess around on the couch.
The paramedic lifted him up, settling the skinny boy on his hip as two cops pushed the would-be kidnappers into the car. “Let’s get you set up nice and snug in the ambulance- how’s that sound? We’ll wait for your daddies there,” he suggested, carrying Hamish to the waiting ambulance.
“You can’t actually delete memories Sherlock,” he said, an easy grin filling his face but Sherlock wasn’t done.
“He said,
“Don’t,” Sherlock warned and Irene turned to look at him for the first time.
“Um, Carl. And Harris, “John tries to recall, but he’s been home for a year, it’s slipping. “Maybe Dane, he was always hanging around with us for pity’s sake at least.”
The child was heavier than he had expected, all dense bones and tangled limbs, but he clung to the man and buried his head in Mycroft’s shoulder. Wordlessly, Mycroft carried him to his bed, struggling to lie down. Hamish wound himself around his uncle, small head resting on Mycroft’s chest so his breaths tickled his cheek in small puffs.
Mike answers the door, grinning tiredly. “Hullo,” he says, hugging them both. “Molly’s inside with Lily. Come in; let me get your coats.”
“Delete?” John asked, confused.
he begged her.
“unique.”
“But Hamish,” he said, stooping to a whisper and his son leaned in. “People were very mean to Chloe. She might not talk very much. She might also get nightmares.”
“There was this army recruiter-“
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh,” Sherlock shuddered as John nipped at the skin along his neck, leaving hot bursts of pain he quickly soothed with his tongue.
“I was excited,” Sherlock excused, starting to sense this may have been a bit not good.
Chloe nodded, even though the word ‘required’ was a bit above her. “I’m not scared,” she lied and John knelt in front of her to kiss her head.
“We don’t have four CCs,” she reminds him, grabbing the end of the gurney and helping it inside. They’re surrounded by soldiers, boys in green with white faces, covered in soot and blood.
"You are a menace, John Watson," Sherlock groaned but he reached out to touch the offending wrist gently, as if assuring himself all was really well.
“Anyway,” Sarah said, hands in her shorts’ pockets. “A bunch of us are driving to ASDA tonight. If you can get away, you wanna hitch a ride?”
“I didn’t-“ John tried, hoping to avoid the verbal abuse he could feel coming but it seemed it was unavoidable.
“You are beautiful.”
“Anything,” John promised, voice rough with lust and desire, and that voice sounded so wrong coming out of John’s face, so innocent and sweet, and Sherlock asked.
“Shame, I have been informed I am a most excellent lover,” Joan said, taking care to pronounce each syllable so as to not sound overly high and sounding twice as high for it in the process. “It’s true. Babes have lined up just to mess around with me.”
The car served violently left and Sherlock was sent hurtling back against the seat.
but that was a bit not good, but John would understand that was how he loved, that was the only way he knew how.
“What did I say?”
“I love that one. I actually got it cause of you.”
He wanted to
“Says who?” John protested, trailing kisses down Sherlock’s offered chest.
Joan stood up with her while she headed to get her shoes but she waved her off when Sherlock started to sweep up her muddy clothes. “Wear mine home,” she insisted, fishing out a plastic bag for Sherlock to carry her muddy jeans in. “You can bring them back to me tomorrow.”
“First day of school tomorrow,” Mycroft said carefully from across the tiny kitchen table. It wasn’t all that late, just a bit past ten, and the windows were open to let the last of the summer air filter into the cramped apartment. Across the way, their neighbor had his radio on and the soft notes of “Oh Girl” drifted in with the wind.
“What on Earth are you two talking about?” she asked, aiming for bite but barely managing gruff, thanks in part to the morning grogginess that had yet to fade. Joan just beamed.
The field erupted into twitters and whispers and Joan put up a hand to silence them. “It’s been hard, finding anyone to compete with us. We are, essentially, the first public school in Brooklyn with a girls’ soccer team. And without a bus, it’s been hard to figure out travel. But, the girl’s team at P.S. 291 in the Bronx has agreed to come to us!”
“It’s just not proper,” Sherlock insisted and John looked up at him from beneath his eyelashes. Sherlock felt himself go hot. John was utterly… beautiful. There was no other word.
“Don’t look so unhappy,” he teases, squeezing John’s hand under the table. “You look ravishing.”
“It’s normal, for this age. I had four when I was in infant school,” he informed his husband.
I sent you quite a slew of pictures.
He knew he should confront Sherlock, talk to him, explain to him that he didn’t judge him. He had an alcoholic little sister, for god’s sake, who was he to judge another person? But John’s cowardice won out in the end and he stayed hidden behind his campers and their activities and it all went perfectly. They didn’t even have swim on Thursday, which was a veritable sign from the gods the he was justified in avoiding the cutting boy.
“Always have been,” Sherlock grumbled and John laughed again.
Hamish grimaced as he remembered the conversation he'd had with his agent that morning. "He's not pleased," he summarized nicely. "I'm trying to spin it to him that I'll get great father parts once I come back but he's worried if I stay away too long, West End will forget me."
Sherlock met John’s eyes over the candles, their hands interlocked across the table.
“Morning Michael, if you would be so kind as to close the tent, John is busy,” Sherlock said, not even opening his eyes as he held John tighter, running one hand through his bed-hair. “Although I must ask how on Earth you knew what John was shouting last night?”
“Always a pleasure, freak,” Sebastian called. “Why don’t you come over here and say hi?”
do try and make up your mind,” Sherlock said dryly and then turned John around to kiss him soundly.
Sherlock was cut off by John’s lips on his, hard and insistent and Sherlock opened his lips to the sweep on John’s tongue and his hands came up to rest in John’s hair, pulling out groans with the twist of his fingers.
Dinner was an awkward affair with Victoria and Cynthia wrapped up in each other and Mycroft and Harry already thick as thieves. They were leaning into each other, blonde hair mixing with aurburn, and Sherlock hated them furiously. He couldn’t tell if Mycroft was shamming or not and then hated them more.
, John ,
I'm just as sad to see Chloe go as you are, but we'll find a way to keep bringing her back in. Thank you guys for making me do this. Y'all have the best possible ideas :)
they played, but it was absolutely beautiful. Mycroft played notes grounded and strong, unwavering and brave and unerringly patient as Sherlock’s notes danced around them in flights of fancy, passion and crazed brilliance.
Sherlock stood outside on the gravel driveway for what seemed like ages until he felt his cell phone vibrate. The sensation was so unfamiliar, no one ever texted him. He pulled out the phone and paused at the text.
“I’m sorry,” she said somewhat uselessly and Joan reached out to rub her socked ankle.
“Sherlock, yeah?” Cammy checked, reaching for a half-empty bottle of gin stolen from someone’s parents’ liquor cabinet. “Let me make you a gin and tonic; think you’ll like it. Dry and direct, like you.”
Mycroft sighed. “Will it ease your silly female mind if I take the boy to my house?” he gave in, and Anthea took the jab in stride.
John stared up at the taller boy, pupils quickly dilating. “I’ll have to say no,” he said calmly, holding his ground.
“Are you sure? We could just kiss if you want,” John offered but Sherlock was shaking his head.
Hamish seemed comforted by that. He dropped his head into John’s shoulder and sucked on his lower lip for a few minutes, sedating himself.
”I think it’s best we delete last night,” he said and his voice did not shake. Inside though, his whole
“Doesn’t matter,” John sighed. “None of it matters. I will always blame myself. That’s how these things work.” He drank the whiskey like it was medicine meant to fix him.
“Sherlock!” John snapped but Hamish just blinked. He didn’t yet know what the word “intelligent” meant. He did understand the tone however.
Hamish had shaken his head, unconvinced. “Bathtub water comes from the trapeze,” he’d insisted, and it’d taken John a minute to realize he’d meant
him. He is
“Yeah Sherlock?” he said, looking up from his book.
“You knew John was coming home, what did you
Just then the words began again and Joan lifted her head to meet Sherlock’s eyes across the expanse of her body and loudly belted “I want you!” in the ridiculous, strained tones of the singer. Sherlock couldn’t help herself, she burst out laughing, dissolving into giggles as Joan continued to serenade her from by her hipbones.
Call me. Now.
“John,” he says softly, unsure of himself. He wants to hold him. He’s scared to touch him.
“Jesus, you went out and bought these?” John wondered, eyes wide, as he came over to take the items from Sherlock’s hand.
“You’re a right wanker, you know that?” John laughed, pulling on a pair of trousers from yesterday after an investigatory sniff.
“Yvette, maybe we should clarify why we’re marching on Washington,” an elderly woman who’d introduced herself as Ruth spoke up, sparing a glance to where Joan and Sherlock were exchanging confused but hesitant glances.
So he’d taken to doing outside business during Hamish’s allotted practice time. Sherlock would be glad of the day Hamish was experienced enough that they could fire the tutor and Hamish could instruct himself. Michele had been with Hamish for nearly two years now- that time would come soon.
"And her mum's working and happy to be doing it!" Hamish justified. "We're not in any trouble financially. In a few months yeah, I'll have to start looking at scripts again but right now-"
“Not till Sam gets back,” John yelled back and smiled at Sarah. “God, I love this job.”
Um, hi.
“We can be
coming from the room two
“Mycroft Holmes,” Mycroft said, shaking his hand firmly, and then looking John up and down. “I expect we shall meet again.”
“Sherlock?”
But as they’re shucking off their tuxes, and John is standing in front of the mirror carefully removing his tie, a comfortable silence descends around them. A silence that doesn’t have to be filled.
“Hm, read me the whole obituary,” Joan asked, already confident in what Sherlock was wrestling with without having to ask. Obligingly, because the question nearly bordered on a deduction, Sherlock pulled the newspaper out of her bag and read,
“Should we send them back to bed?” John asked softly as Hamish launched into a long and factually incorrect speech on the god Shiva.
It may very well have been their first leisurely kiss since they’d met and John savored it, the offered blowjob quickly forgotten. He turned fully and tilted his head and Sherlock moaned appreciatively, prompting one very loud shush from the second row that they velmently ignored. Sherlock tasted like a mix of cinnamon and something else and John let himself fold into it.
Jim laughed out loud, shaking his head, and the sound chilled Sherlock.
“Quite lucky you’ll never have to,” he said and he helped his brother off the dusty ground, leading him silently into the house.
“We’re leaving our trousers on, you pervert,” he advised and then grabbed the younger boy’s hand. “Let’s go!”
“Thursday? Thursday? Meeting this Thursday?” one of the girls suggested and suddenly they’d switched into planning mode.
He smiled at the emerging memory. "Yesterday, as we were getting dressed to go out, she smiled at me. Not a gassy smile or a just burped smile- a real smile! How can I miss that, Pa? How can I give that to a babysitter?"
"Quite a bit," Patrick laughed. "How's her mum?"
Sherlock felt everything inside her clench and refuse to release as all her organs rearranged and her throat throbbed. Joan was speaking, something about greyhound busses and tents, but she sounded like a voice at the end of a very long tunnel.
“John-“ Sherlock started and Jim cut him off with a wave of his hand.
Sherlock gave him a look. “He just looks like a John. And besides, he’s going to have to keep me company when you’re-“
They’d all agreed to meet at 7pm by the Knickerbocker avenue stop to take the train together over to the meeting and Sherlock and Joan ran up, panting, just two minutes past the mark with their hair a mess, dirt on their palms and, in Joan’s case, a pair of fake eyelashes only on her left eye.
“Come here,” John says, voice hoarse, and he sets the canvas down. Sherlock comes, straddling him into the couch, and up close he realizes John has tears in his eyes, glistening traitorously.
“Listen here you sick son of a bitch, let me talk to him right now or I’ll-“
“Sherlock-“ John said, following him into the bedroom, as Sherlock began rooting around in his desk drawers.
We're also gonna ignore the consequences of two boys kissing in public, especially camp counselors. Happy world where everyone gets along, remember? ;)
“In a minute,” he promised, looking at Sherlock and Sherlock felt his world flip. “I have something to do first.”
“I have had years of practice.”
“John,” he begged, eyes locked into oceans of pleasure. “Make me come.”
-          Mike
“Joan.”
Subject: Still breathing
John heals slowly. Sherlock reads books about PTSD, about trauma, about psychosomatic injuries. John goes to therapy. They both hate Ella, it unites them.
“Hey Pa, I just-“
Cor. You’re not kidding.
“Thank you.”
“I’ll be just as blind as you. I’ve never done it with a bloke.”
“Listen to me Hamish. We will be there,” John promised. “We just need to- Sherlock, he’s running!” he yelled off to the side and Hamish heard what sounded like two bodies hitting the ground.
Joan beamed at her through half-lidded eyes. It had been a weekend of little sleep and even Sherlock was crashing. “Most definitely.”
Sherlock winced. “My brother’s picking me up with the busses. I have to be in Windsor by tomorrow afternoon.”
at him. Puberty seemed to be a bitch to everyone save Sherlock, making him taller and elegant when it just made John gangly.
“Then give me that,” he cries, exacerbated. “I need a transfusion going. Is anyone-“ he scrambles at the boy’s dog tags
Within seconds there were warm arms around his middle and he bent down to kiss the top of Hamish’s head. The boy looked up for another kiss on the nose and then let go in favor of penguins.
But then they moved smoothly to the kitchen for dinner and Hamish was just able to push down his uneasy feelings and try to enjoy when suddenly-
“How much did you drink?” he checked. Did he need to take Sherlock to some kind of hospital?
She felt Mycroft shift, as though reaching for her, but no touch came. Outside the window she could hear the couple across the way talking softly in Italian, the parents two doors down beginning to argue, a baby somewhere starting to cry but inside the apartment was silent.
“Shit. Christ, how’s mum?”
“If we ignore him, maybe he’ll go away,” Sherlock suggested and Mycroft’s indignant “I will do no such thing,” sent them back into peals of laughter.
Mycroft was anxious to escape, chose to go to Columbia instead of Harvard or Yale because it was the farthest he could go and still choose a school their parents would approve of. Sherlock called and wrote to him, too proud to beg him to come home and visit, but asking for him to in their own way. But he didn’t want to be near their father, who could blame him, and so he wasn’t home to notice when-
“Um, can I go down?” James asked him timidly and Sherlock snapped back to reality, turning back to James with a nod.
“Yes you are,” Harry said, coming over.
“I believe the colloquial term is
- “I’d like to meet my birthmom.”
“Papa, I’m not scared anymore!” he announced, running over to hug his father.
By the time Sherlock could breathe again, she found herself still lying in the small bed, the apartment silent save for the hum of the record player. Joan lay with her head against Sherlock’s hipbone, rubbing soothingly at the skin of Sherlock’s left knee. She looked up when she felt Sherlock stir against her and smiled. Sherlock couldn’t help noticing the wetness at Joan’s jaw and chin, the way her skin gleamed with it.
“Couldn’t we have this discussion at say, the tea table? Not my bed at 4 in the bloody morning.”
Free hugs anyone?
“Fever’s starting to go down,” he smiled softly. “It won’t level out for another half hour at least but he’ll be okay. We’re gonna have a tough day tomorrow; this is probably a 24 hour thing.”
was doing it, purely on instinct. “It’s quite all right Hamish,” he said softly, hesitantly. “The lighting is a few miles from us.”
“Yes you do,” Sherlock said, nonplused. “Goodnight John.”
“I need to go, it’s getting late,” she shouted back over the noise and Joan nodded.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John cried, cutting him off. “We are not having another child just because Hamish asked for one!”
“Yeah, I do, but those aren’t chemistry,” Hamish pointed out and Sherlock looked affronted. “They’re not! Dissecting a sheep’s brain- that’s biology,” Sherlock actually grimaced. “Comparing mould growths on sheep’s tongue, also bio. Synthesizing a hydrogen combustion- okay that’s chemistry. But most chemistry is not like that! It’s balancing equations and memorizing formulas and I’m pants at it.”
Hamish woke up on the morning of his eight birthday to the sound of a loud argument downstairs.
“Oh it’s alright, I’ll wait till Pa comes home,” Hamish brushed off, opening the fridge. He peered in curiously before turning around. “Maggot experiment is going well.”
“That’s all it takes to wake you up?” John laughed but he helped Sherlock strip as the bathtub filled behind them and after a minute, they got in. Sherlock yelped, it was hotter than he expected and John sat down across from him, laughing softly.
“Did you forget what happened last time we went to a house party, John?” Sherlock asked sarcastically.
Sherlock looked at the organs trailing across the kitchen and then back to his son. “Do you think this will freak her out?” he inquired.
“Ginsburg,” Sherlock corrected, unable to stop herself, and Joan’s head shot up to face her.
But there was something different about it too, something in the thrill of watching it get darker and darker outside until the clock read long past their usual hour and Joan excused herself to change into pajamas in her bedroom, coming out in sweatpants and a vest and politely pretending she didn’t know Sherlock had taken the time to snoop through her mail.
“Sir, why do I hear
“I have to go,” John said and Sherlock nodded, still staring at him as though not quite believing him real. “See you tomorrow?”
“Where do you plan on going?” Victoria asked, her eyes never leaving the business newspaper she held between her manicured fingers. After her husband had left, Victoria had taken it upon herself to provide for her children. All of them were rich; Victoria had come from a wealthy family in its own right and still had a sizable account after her husband had taken his share of the Holmes fortune and both boys had trust funds set up by their parents years before their split. But Victoria had never wanted her family to want for anything and within six months in the stock market she had doubled her funds. Well, as she explained to her shocked accountants, she certainly hadn’t married a Holmes by being
“Do you have any idea how much it must be messing with his head, all these people trying to hurt him?” John ground out and Hamish missed a bit of the last part, only hearing,”-negligible, Sherlock. Abusive even.”
“Oh no, love. Of course he’s not,” John promised, kissing one tiny tear-track. “Daddy and I love each other so, so very much.”
“I fail to see how your collection of American stamps is doing either of us any good,” Sherlock pointed out and John was too tired for this.
, her hands running up and down his chest, her mouth on his.
“You didn’t think, or we wouldn’t be having this problem now,” his father seethed and Hamish cast his eyes down, properly chastised and slightly frightened.
Annemarie met Hamish’s eye and hers were twinkling, shining with the glamour of a really good memory. “But then a week later I get a knock on my door and your parents are standing there, trying to smile. Your Papa is blushing fiercely and your Dad says, calm as anything, ‘I realized you were considering surrogacy. We’re interested. May we come in?’  So I did what any sane woman would do.”
They spent close to four hours, just playing every sport and stuffing themselves with ridiculous fair food. As the fair started to wind down, John suddenly stopped.
Now, back in the van, Harry was yelling something else at George and Hamish started coughing. It was really hard to cough around the gag but it caught George’s attention. “Shit, all you alright kid?” George asked, taking out Hamish’s gag.
“And we need to work on your treating our child like an idiot,” Sherlock countered, following him leisurely.
Sebastian stared at Sherlock a minute before saying coldly, “I don’t know how much you’re paying him freak. But enjoy it while you can because soon enough he’s going to realize no amount of money is worth putting up with you.”
“Very well,” he offered cheekily. “Do your worst.”
. “Cause sometimes it’s real nice,” he murmured, not meeting his father’s eyes. “Like at naptime, Marcie puts her sleepy-mat right next to mine and we get to whisper together. And during snacktime, she held my hand. She has tiny hands!” he exclaimed, suddenly excited. “Even smaller than mine on account of how she’s shorter than me and they're soft like kitty fur.”
“Everyone hated me. But that was okay, I was used to that. I knew how to handle that. But
Anyway, here it is. I hope its length makes up for its lateness
“Are they a thing now?” John asked, suddenly interested. It wasn’t that exciting a story, couples happened all over camp. It was hardly surprising, Sherlock certainly was good-looking. Someone not as straight as John might even say he was handsome.
“Oh my god, you’ve gotten someone pregnant,” John blinked, horrified.
Neither of them talked about their home life. That was one of the okay things about Bushwick- everyone was just as poor and had just as shitty a home life as you did. It went without saying neither of them had anything exciting going on back in their respective apartments so, no one thought it weird that they rarely brought up their families and no attempts were made to try and visit each other outside of school.
“Do you want to- are we having sex?” Joan asked and Sherlock swallowed and looked up at her and tried to figure out if she was scared or just extremely turned on.
“Friend? Oh, that’s rich, we both know you don’t have friends,” Sebastian reminded him coolly.
on the other hand, he’s fascinating,” Jim grinned and Sherlock tried not to show as his heart began hammering in his throat. “He never told you just what his job is, did he? Oh,
Hamish stood on the steps of Mycroft’s house in a terrific pout. “Why do I have to stay here?” he cried, glaring at his father.
“For goodness sakes, Sherlock,” he drawls, rolling his eyes. “That sofa is from Italy.”
and John sighed, wrapping his hands around the back of Sherlock’s neck. The moment turned tender so quickly, John almost held back. Almost being the operative word.
*Phone call- 11 pm*
When John walked down in the morning a good month after the last present to find a box of condoms on the kitchen table, he actually gave up.
“He goes on for a whole two more pages explaining why it’s a good idea,” John finished for him, coming over. “He even suggested a baby wouldn’t take up as much room in Father Christmas’s sleigh and therefor save him money on fuel.”
He sat back down in his chair to face the genius and smile so wickedly, it chilled Sherlock to the bone.
And then Sherlock came, shuddering against John, as John unraveled beneath him and it was fireworks and sunshine and pure bliss.
“I was wondering,” he stuttered and stopped himself. Holmeses did not
It was then that Sherlock’s mobile buzzed and he flipped it open to read the message, eyes moving impossibly fast. “There’s been a case-“ he started, but John expression stopped him, the quick glance to his children on the floor and his wife behind him.
Sherlock, despite her protests and whining during their afternoons in the warm library, huddled by their new table near the old heaters, came out too. She sat in her spot, scarf pulled up around her nose, and did her sums to the soothing sounds of Joan cursing at a squadron of shivering girls.
“You really are Sherlock’s son,” Bossman confirmed, coming closer, and armchair-goon stood up to follow suit. He hadn’t pulled any sort of weapon but Hamish couldn’t assume, not enough
“I’ve cut all ties with him, I swear. John- I don’t know why I-“ Sherlock stutters, distraught. This is beyond a bit not good. This is true sociopathy, to take a trust as whole and valuable as John’s and to shatter it into pieces.
“Well-” Sherlock started, tilting his head and John glared at him.
"The best," he nodded and then, with a clap of his hands, he was turning around to grin manically at his family, eyes alight with brand new plans.
“We’re just taking you to a nice little place where you can relax,” the man went on, oblivious to Hamish’s inner planning. “We’re not gonna hurt you. My name’s George.”
Violet kissed her grandson’s head. “And that’s why I’m happy,” she said finally. “Do you wanna see a really funny one?” she teased and turned to a snapshot of Sherlock standing by the back door, drenched in water, with a leg that looked suspiciously like Mycroft’s running out of frame.
“Shame we don’t have more time,” John murmured against Sherlock’s lips before licking at his tongue obscenely, sucking it lightly. “The things we could do…”
“Alright boys, let’s get you in the water!” Greg yelled suddenly, running down the hill to the lake, and John released Sherlock’s hand, an unexplained flush creeping up the back of his neck. He blamed it on the sun.
“I could probably even push it into a sleepover if you’ll wash my uniform,” he offered and Mycroft clapped him on the arm.
him, should
“Of course,” she says, gently sliding Lily into his arms and John cradles her, absolutely perfect. John turns around to face Sherlock, baby in his arms, and Sherlock knows he’s done.
“Heeeeey Sherlock,” Joan beamed up at her from the sofa. “You look lovely up there, all covered in light.”
“You might not, she moved in ‘64,” Mary said, keeping conversation going as they swiped in and went down to wait for the train.
“You promised not to,” Sherlock said, petulantly, but the hurt was near audible.
“You’re studying chemistry?” Sherlock said, brightening with interest and then doing the sort of sweep she’d forgotten to do initially in her uncomfortableness. “Right yes, of course, father a doctor, mother an engineer, always a high-achieving family.”
“No, not yet,” Sherlock said and the older boy grinned sinfully.
So yes, John thought they’d been happy. Happy sorting out rancid milk from contaminated jam, happy sharing tea duties, happy pretending John wasn’t hopelessly in love with Sherlock and Sherlock pretending not to notice.
“I am now you git. What’s wrong?”
“Mayfair is just so pretentious.”
can John.
“And you’ll stay nice and close to the man with the gun, alright?” he ordered Sherlock and the detective nodded sullenly. The two men, joined by Donovan, raced from the room and Sherlock was almost out the conference room door when Hamish called “Daddy!”
“She could have stolen pills,” Joan nodded, catching on. “But maybe she didn’t want to burden her family-
He hadn’t counted on her recognizing him and the teen stood frozen on the doorstep for a minute before Annemarie seemed to come back to herself and directed,
Friends. Her, Sherlock Holmes, with a large enough group of girls to fill a Bushwhick apartment who didn’t want to hit her, or get her expelled, but make her drinks and chat with her in poorly-lit kitchens. Unexpected to the extreme.
“Amen,” John smiled softly and then Sherlock was falling apart, breaking into tiny pieces and shattering across the sky like a shooting star, blazing and extinguishing in an epicenter of love.
“Don’t pretend like you don’t know, you’re brilliant,” John said, his eyes never leaving the younger boy. It was disconcerting, this much eye contact. Normally it was Sherlock inflicting a thick gaze and someone else squirming beneath it.
“No!” Hamish struggled to explain. “But I know there aren’t cause I can watch the water come out of the trapeze-“
Sherlock rarely though about the thing that would have been her baby, but she thought about it now. A miserable thing, it would have been born hated and despised by its own mother. Sherlock thought about the last two years of her life, her escape from a waking nightmare, meeting Joan, the dyke squad who were now her closest friends. She thought about soccer games in the snow and getting beer-drunk in someone’s apartment, about soil-sample collections on the muddy banks of a polluted river with a cackling Joan by her side, seconds before the two of them had lunged at each other and come up soaking wet and laughing. She thought about all the pieces of her life that made her want to wake up day after day, all of them impossible if she’d been forced to let the thing that had once been inside of her become a baby.
” he moaned as Sherlock’s teeth sunk into his neck, sucking on skin hard enough to make bruises.
Joan nodded. Around them the student body pulsed as kids rushed off to their lockers and then their classes. Sherlock loved these moments, where she stood apart from the endlessly boring stream in all her genius, a shark in an ocean of guppies. Only this time, it wasn’t just her standing full and superior in the midst of the herd.
“You are brilliant,” John smiled, reaching up a hand to rest against Sherlock’s cheek.
As they drove along the highway, lamplights granting them faint glimpses of each other’s faces, John turned to Sherlock.
“And what if there had been two guns?” Sherlock pressed and Hamish didn’t bother asking how his father knew that tidbit of information.
“What happened?” Mary whispered and John tuned Riley out
“Right, cool, thanks for that,” Sherlock said, at a loss for anything to respond, relieved when Anne’s voice echoed over the room.
And for one delicious moment, Sherlock let himself hope. Let himself dream about John holding him like this, kissing him- back against the tree. Letting himself love John.
He comes home, grinning madly, and Sherlock gets up to take his coat. He does that now, acts more thoughtful than he used to. More considerate.
“How do you do Sherlock,” Mike smiled, sticking out his hand and Sherlock shook it on John’s prompting.
“We’re part of the Bushwhick High feminist club,” Joan offered, forcing confidence into her voice. “We meet Shulamith at the rally on Monday and she invited us-“
“We can’t go to the police,” Mycroft insisted, not turning around. “Moriarty will just buy himself off and then he’ll be angrier. Let him think he’s won this round.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was hugging Jordan outside the bus bound for Norfolk, telling him what a wonderfully creative soul he had, when there was a soft tap on his back. Sherlock stood there, hands clasped awkwardly behind his back.
John says it once. He’s so careful not to scream it out during sex or to say it casually at breakfast or to declare it publically after Sherlock is just utterly brilliant at a crime scene. But he whispers it, just once.
and there was no easy way to shut it off. So he settled for dialing it down until his synapses ran as background noise and he could focus on John’s breathing, the rise and fall of his chest beneath Sherlock’s head.
“Who said it was pretend?” he asked sadly but Hamish just smiled winningly at him.
“Sherlock, my kids-“ he tried to protest but Sherlock silenced him by letting one hand drift down, leaving scratches down John’s back, and John arched into him, begging for more pressure. He could feel every point of contact between them even better in the near-blinding darkness; Sherlock’s hip against his, their chests pressed against each other, Sherlock’s fingers in his hair and on his back-
“What do you want?” Sherlock asked, trying not to notice as he held the bear tighter.
The meeting seemed to rush past. It was decided that they’d put up the signs from the protest in the hallways afterwards and that if anyone tried to take them down, ‘fucking sock them in the jaw’ Kelsie suggested, they’d hold in a sit-in at lunch. Flyers were passed around with the words to protest songs meticulously copied over by hand – “save them for Monday!” Joan urged- and then everyone split into groups to draw up their own signs. Sherlock was leaning over her group’s sign to gently correct the spelling of Vietnam, when she felt a tap on her shoulder.
They kiss and the band starts playing as everything in Harriet Watson’s life falls perfectly into place. Sherlock takes John’s hand and leads him to the dance floor, twirling his incredibly manly partner in a waltz.
“You gave me a key!” he exclaimed pitifully, puppy-dog emerging from his eyes and Mycroft did his best to resist.
“I want you so bad it’s driving me mad,” Joan plucked out, punctuating her sentence with a nip at the band of Sherlock underwear and Sherlock was so caught between amusement and arousal that she almost felt split along the seams. It hurt, it ached, the laughter and the beating need fluttering both together in her stomach and it was the most pleasurable ache she’d ever felt. Was this sex, she thought wildly, staring down at Joan. Was sex supposed to be this good and this fun- all at once? Joan gripped her waist in a false grip, steady but easily escapable, and sang along with the record,
“I don’t-“ Sherlock tried, confused, and Mycroft went on.
I have a picture of us by my bed too
“I feel like a penguin,” John comments, squeezing back, and nearly gasps at the look in Sherlock’s eye as he bends over to whisper in his ear.
“You kinky bastard,” John let out in a sigh and he could feel Sherlock grin into his hair.
And now the moment you've all been waiting for:
“Don’t make me fight you,” Hamish threatened and Sherlock laughed out loud like that was amusing. Hamish bristled.
“Yeah, he denied us, that sanctimonious asshole,” she gritted out. “Said we didn’t have the money in the budget which, fine, this school is deadass broke but we don’t need anything ‘sides a net and a few balls, and we can bring that from home! I already said I’d coach for free. And we don’t need busses to games like the football team gets. We can train! Or a couple of girls have cars they can borrow. He’s just doing this because he’s a misogynist.”
“Eat your corn dog,” John ordered and Sherlock did. It was good.
“Okay.”
When Sherlock gets up to get more biscuits from the kitchen, John finds himself leaning over, arms on his thighs, to whisper viciously to Victor,
“From a desk,” Mycroft reminded him. “Your father believes any job that does not involve legwork is slovenly,” he explained and the rest was rather drowned out as the mixer was switched on. “Keep at that until the eggs are stiff peaks,” he called out over the noise and Hamish nodded back, holding the bowl steady. Mycroft kept to his chocolate until Hamish held the bowl out for inspection and he approved.
Hamish looked horrified. “But then Daddy’s gonna feel sad!” he protested. “Like one time when Mrs. Teacher was choosing who was gonna be the best cleaner of the day and norma- norm- on every other day she only picks one person who cleaned the bestest out of everyone but then that day she chose two and both people were sad cause they didn’t get to really be special so you should only pick Daddy so he feels special and I’ll be alright cause a lot of people in my class are gonna give me cards, I bet.”
“Sherlock I will literally do anything you ask, just pick up your phone. Sherlock, I know you’re mad but please, can we talk about this first?”
“You guys have a crest?” John stopped and Sherlock ignored him.
The grounds were huge and the surrounding woodland stretched on for miles. Sherlock knew it like the back of his hand, even in the inky darkness, and he set off at a brisk pace for the lake at the edge of the property. He didn’t have to turn around to know that John was following him, his footsteps heavy in the night silence.
“Exciting announcement,” Joan said, full of pep and energy and Sherlock honestly had no idea how. “We are going to have our very first competitive game this coming Saturday!”
“John!” Sherlock demanded, louder, and he finally shut up. “I spend around 80% of my time with
Sherlock smiled, brilliant and electric, and it made John feel alive the way nothing else could. “What’s it like?” he asked, brimming with scientific curiosity. “Sex?”
Sherlock’s face turned a horrified white and he ran to the couch, staring down at the offending pictures of him and then turning to his mother. “Mummy, why?”
John looked over at Sherlock. “Crisis avoided?” he asked and Sherlock smiled.
“Leave him, Sherlock.”
Sherlock stopped and looked up and John, eyes so fragile behind a wall of grey and John wanted to kiss him.
“Thank you so much,” he said again and then paused before saying, “You’re really good with him, Mycroft. Don’t doubt yourself.”
“Night Sherlock,” John sighed and let sleep overtake him, all sweaty limbs and bruising kisses and soft murmurs of
He’d seen Sherlock’s birth control before. It sat, non-threateningly and unassumingly in their medicine cabinet in the upstairs bathroom, never uttering a peep. But now it seemed to scream at him; reminding him violently that Sherlock was a
“That’s not what I meant, you brooding Byronic,” she said, picking up her underwear and setting her towel to the side. Sherlock turned her head obligingly. “I meant, it’s nice as in a ‘things don’t usually go this well for us,’ kind of way, not a ‘what’s gonna go wrong?’ type of way.”
Sherlock wanted to protest that John was as far from ordinary as one could get but Jim had to monologue. That was his thing.

“I can work with that,” Sherlock smiled and that was all it took. They second they drew up in front of the park, the kids were out with a bang, running pell-mell to the slides.

“I hear that part gets fun eventually,” John encouraged and Sherlock scoffed.
“Detective Hamish, what can I do for you?” she asked, perhaps laying it on a bit thick, but Hamish just soaked it up.
“Sherlock,” John said again, firmer, and Sherlock turned around. John was close,
“Of course I know what your name is,” the woman, Annemarie, choked out, her eyes oddly wet. “Oh my lord, Hamish.”
“Hush,” Sherlock eased, running his fingers through John’s hair soothingly. “I’m alright. We’re both okay.”
Chloe spared him an excited smile. “Nope. We’ve only got day passes- we’re gonna use ‘em. Now do you plan on driving us or should we switch sides?”
He was quiet, looking out over the parking lot. The sun was setting, casting bright rays over the asphalt, and it caught Mycroft, making his hair look positively red.
Oh no
“I don’t feel any different,” Sherlock said suddenly.
“None,” Sherlock said, surprised John hadn’t figured it out. “I just thought it’d be nice.”
“Five minutes,” he gasped out and then John smirked. He knew Sherlock couldn’t see it in the darkness, but he knew the other boy felt it from the way his breath hitched.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock finished, face angry.
It was a testament to Hamish’s Sherlock-imbued wisdom that he considered it. “I don’t think so,” he finally said honestly.
John stopped to breathe and Sherlock reached out a hand to stroke his ankle lightly. He felt John relax against the touch and then he went on.
for it. You’d be fantastic at begging, I bet.” He licked his lips unconsciously and Sherlock followed the motion, mouth open. “Your voice is sin; I feel like I never tell you that.”
He flies in, like hell on wings, coat billowing out behind him. They’re told John’s in surgery. They’re told he’s doing well. They’re not told much else.
“How’s Victor?”
“How did you-“ Lestrade struggled and then seemingly gave up. “You’re Sherlock’s father?”
Some fun historical notes!
” he finally gave up and John looked at him for a very long time before saying,
more, but now it seemed rather crucial. A flash of something,
“She’s changing, we’re going swimming,” Mycroft admitted like it wasn’t some divine revelation, and Sherlock stared at him. He had very distinct, very vivid memories of Mycroft standing at the edge of the dock by the lake in blue swim trunks, refusing to be moved.
he reminded himself, but John didn’t need to know that. John needed to think he was perfect.
, Sherlock pronounced him ready and John swore. “Thank
“Yes, two, but then why couldn’t they work here as a junior counselor? Involved in something, drugs unlikely but perhaps drinking. Boy then, more likely. So younger brother, heavy drinker. Just like father.”
“The boys will love that,” Mike smirked and John smiled back. They both knew their kids would just end up eating the raw dough. There would be a line of tummy-aches by lunch.

“He’ll be sad he didn’t see her go in,” Sherlock noted as they sunk into chairs stationed against the wall. Hamish had actually run down to buy Chloe chocolate, claiming, “it makes everything better, like in Harry Potter!” John had started reading them the series years ago, but he was plateauing them at book three, to Sherlock’s chagrin. John just wanted Hamish to at least be nine before they introduced him to major character death.
“You didn’t want that,” Sherlock said, and it was not a question.
“They have so much energy, it just makes you feel so old sometimes,” Mary admitted and John laughed. She was holding one of her camper’s hands, a shy girl John thought was named Keera.
“At a legal shooting range with legal guns,” Sherlock finished and the inspector seemed to quiet down. But John was shaking his head and glaring solely at his husband.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s just closed his eyes when he feels a rustle underneath him and suddenly there are lips at his ear and a whisper so soft he can’t be sure he didn’t dream it.
“She wanted us to use her married name,” Sherlock tells him as he lays the flowers they bought by the ivory tombstone. “Said she was more Holmes than anything else.”
"Basically," Hamish agreed. He propped his daughter up on his lap, carefully supporting her head with his spread hands, and leaned into her smiling face to brush noses, prompting a fresh bout of giggling. It made this conversation easier, not making eye contact. "I'm not telling you to move into a home and take up knitting but maybe leave the serial killers to someone without the beginnings of arthritis-"
Sherlock looks up. “God, we’ve been dating ten years?” he smiles, holding John’s hand across the table.
“Yes,” Hamish responded just as he’d responded to nearly everything she’d ever asked from him, and followed her blindly as she ran with him to the dance pit by the water, spinning her around in the light from the moon.
John shot Mycroft a glare. “Thanks a lot, mate,” he grumbled and Mycroft smiled good-naturedly back.
“Tell me when I can look,” Sherlock said oblidingly, covering his eyes with his palms. There was a moment of rustling and then Hamish announced,
But what he said was, “I’ve never been kissed before.” No, that hadn’t been what he’d meant to say, but his brain hadn’t been obeying him for weeks now. Why had he even expected it to start behaving now?
“Nothing yet, but not enough data. Need to figure out motive first, before I can untangle the specific nature of the distraction.”
“How are you doing, love?”
“Yes, yes, that’s it,” he said, clicking his tongue. “Now, do you want-“
“So when he’s sick he’s suddenly
Hamish thought a second. “I was supposed to go with Sam and Chrissy to the-“
Hamish shook his head. “All alone?” he pressed.
I’m outside.
that boy could be.
“Relax, he’s a big boy, let him do his own dirty work,” Mary smiled easily and John felt himself relax in her grip. “Besides,” she whispered, suddenly in his ear, “I want to
Sherlock ignored him. “So I just notch it like so, and then point?” he clarified.
True to form, Hamish kept coughing. “Do you need water or something?” George tried and Hamish did his best to remember how the boy in the park had coughed, large and loud. And then he’d stopped coughing and had started gasping for air. So Hamish mimicked.
we’d be doing?” Sherlock cries.
Cammy paused, turned away to take someone’s order and for a second Sherlock was sure she’d fucked this up too, but then she turned back with a small grin. “Right yeah. Joan said you do that. Well come on, how’d you do it?”
“Sherlock, the world does not revolve around you,” John sighed, sinking his head into his hands.
“John, we’re in public!” he cried over the music.
“Thank you for telling me,” he said, not meaning it in the slightest and Sally had the good sense to look ashamed.
“Great, so. Mike’s having this summer house party. Would you wanna go?” John asked and Sherlock raised one eyebrow.
She took Chloe out for pastries and told her all about her house in Florida, the school Chloe would go to, the therapy dog they would buy together, the yard she could play in, and the lake just ten minutes from her house. Sherlock busied himself with reviewing and re-reviewing her file and John and Hamish assumed the heartbreaking task of packing the meagre possessions she’d acquired into a tiny bag.
“Don’t drown,” Joan shot back and it really was a pretty weak retort but Sherlock made her way down the hall with a smile playing in the corner of her mouth. After all, this was her first time over a friend.
Sherlock looked incredibly small, dwarfed by large white machines and plush white blankets. One wire attached him to an IV, another to an oxygen mask, and his skin looked near translucent, black hair spilling onto the large pillows beneath him. John sat in the chair next to his bed, holding his hand until he woke up.
Victor smiles at him lazily, as if John’s amusing. “Let me explain this to you, Johnny. Can I call you Johnny? I regret what I did. Sherlock clearly loves you and while he does, I will not touch him or kiss him, out of respect for him. But should he ever change his mind, should he ever decide he’s tired of being shagged every eight months or so and waiting for the phone call that you’ve been shot, I will not feel the least bit of guilt in shagging him senseless. Do you understand?”
He’d been thinking about it since the opera. Obsessing over it really. John never pushed and it was driving Sherlock mental just how
“Irene,” he smiled at his classmate and hugged her.
Mycroft wasn’t home when Sherlock walked into the apartment and she hadn’t expected him to be. Their three room apartment always felt largest in these few hours alone and she used them carefully. First she did her homework. She’d never done it back when she’d been at boarding school, back when they hadn’t lived here, but now the need to stay out of the principle’s office overrode the insane boredom that came with basic math.
"Yeah, how did you know?" John asked, trying desperately not to get distracted by Sherlock's lower lip. He waited for an answer involving no less than his his hair, his clothes, and one of his wrists.
“Papa’s coming home,” he repeated, even though he abhorred repetition, and he let Hamish sit on the toilet cover while he took down the smaller bathtub and filled it, taking out the shampoo. “Papa’s coming home.”
“The hospital? Why the hell is he in the hospital?”
“You’re only encouraging him,” Sherlock protested from his spot on the floor, sprawled out unceremoniously and unhappily.
why was he so good at this? Sherlock let one nail skim the underside of his cock and
“Well?” John whispered softly, leaning across his armrest so his voice was barely heard. “There are the flutes,” he pointed with minuet motions. “And there’s the harpist. The percussionist is in the back.”
. He had to look over to believe it, John’s hand on his, John’s eyes never leaving the road.
“Because forcing them to peel you off the sidewalk is so much kinder to them,” she countered and Joan winced. “No, too many variables.”
“Da, it’s not-“Hamish tried but Sherlock gave him such a glare that he sighed and moved to sit in John’s chair. Once he’d settled, Sherlock gave him a pointed look.
“What are you doing?” John got out evenly as his pulse practically raced and all his blood rushed to where it really wasn’t welcome.
he offered his nervous stomach.
“It wasn’t a problem,” he brushed off, uncomfortable. People rarely thanked him for things, let alone child-care. “Will you be by to pick him up?”
It was essentially pure, only a hint of teeth as John nipped at Sherlock’s bottom lip for entrance and then quick, wet slides of tongue against tongue but it was full of such staggering
“I’ve decided to take a more aggressive approach to ensuring my sleep,” Sherlock cut him off as John turned redder under his gaze. “Now get dressed and meet me downstairs in ten minutes.” And with that, Sherlock shut the bedroom door and ran downstairs before his knees gave out.
John stared at him, confused. “Then how did you know all that?”
*Phone call 1:00 am*
Hamish considered the problem a minute, head cocked to the side in concentration. “I think so,” he decided finally and John grinned.
Sherlock followed his line of sight and blushed furiously, his already red and panting face turning neon. “Sorry about that,” he gasped out and John laughed.
calm day.
“Hey, we should get going,” John advised and Sherlock turned red. John didn’t seem to notice, or
“Put those on,” Sherlock ordered. “We’re going running.”
She hated the way her stomach lurched watching Joan’s face light up, but Joan kept her hope to herself. “I’m gonna get you some water,” she said, standing by the door. “And some toast maybe, if you have bread.”
“They made him take his finals twice because they were so sure he cheated the first time around,” Sherlock whispered to John and John held in a laugh at the thought of Mycroft taking his finals in minutes, handing them off with no less than a sneer.
Cynthia looked up from her toast. “That sounds lovely. You can borrow the car if you want John.”
Sherlock hadn’t thought of it in those terms, the cold November wind mussing her hair and leaving her hands cracked, her voice all scratched up from singing and shouting, her arms and legs sporting small bruises from all the pushing and moving. “Yeah,” she said and meant it. It had been. “It’s…good. Being a part of something bigger than yourself. Even if it doesn’t succeed. At least it was heard.”
Here now in the library, Joan across the table with the sleeves of her men’s sweater rolled back to show the rough bruising on her arms from breaking her falls playing soccer, Sherlock nodded both to show she was listening and to shake herself out of her own memories.
that his theoretical sleep might be interrupted that was upsetting. It was the principle of it all.
“John,” he called, his voice sounding loud and sleep-rough. “John, wake up.”
Joan now, in this city with this Sherlock a year-and a half sober, seemed fully blissed out, her eyes half closed and her mouth stretched in a permanent smile as her head drooped to rest on the breast of the girl squished in next to her- Grace or something religious.
“Good, sir,” Sherlock said respectfully and then swallowed. A full year and a bit of keeping her head down and not making trouble, not getting herself noticed, was about to go up in smoke- all over Joan’s stupid, feminist, soccer team. She hadn’t felt more herself since moving to Bushwick.
Joan sighed, turning to stare at the TV. “She hasn’t lived here in almost a year. Her new husband doesn’t like me very much, me or Harry, likes to pretend we don’t exist. She lives over on the Upper West Side with him and sends me money for rent and food every month.” Joan’s mouth was a small line, her body a heavy curve. “It’s not so terrible, really. A bit like living on your own without having to worry about working three jobs to survive.”
John looked at his husband encouragingly. Sherlock took a breath before going on, fiddling nervously with the handle of his mug. “We would have rather waited to tell you but Anderson," here he paused to grit his teeth, "rather let the cat out of the proverbial bag. They used a drugs bust because for a
“I’m sorry,” he whispered and Sherlock said nothing but strode forward and snatched the sheet music off the stand. He tromped over to his collection of sheet music to slide it away when Hamish’s voice, hesitant and small, called back to him.
“Of course you wanted an escape,” Joan said softly. “It makes perfect sense, anyone would have done the same.”
about him, made him warm and cold all over.
“It’s just,” he fidgeted nervously as Dara Carmen raced past him in her petticoats and a bra and he swallowed. “My play is tonight. The one I told you about,
“Oh shut up, you prat.”
“Oh of course not, that’s what I have you for,” Sherlock said back and John grinned, pulling on a shirt.
“No thank you,” Hamish smiled back. “It’s just sums. Sums are easy; I can do them on my fingers.”
“I have to tell Ms. Hudson,” he excused, not meeting the careful eyes of Hamish, who peeked out from behind his father’s legs. “And Lestrade.”
“Let me talk to him. Can I talk to him?”
Hamish stood in the kitchen doorway, watching him with wide eyes. “Papa come home now,” he repeated, undeterred, and Sherlock needed him to stop saying Papa right now because all he could think of was John in the alley and a knife and blood all over his discarded scarf.
“That’s what friends are for, yeah?” she said, like it wasn’t much of a revelation. “We look out for each other. Guess you’re the brain and I’m the brawn, yeah?”
Sarah comes over for dinner and John cooks. They laugh, telling old stories. Sherlock feels rather like a third wheel, or an unnecessary chair. He watches them, the way they smile at each other over lasagna, and he feels wrong.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No,” he says and leaves, walks out of the DI’s office and back to the flat called home. It feels like hell.
“Of course,” he promises and Sherlock kisses his forehead, gently. Hesitantly. John is broken.
“Who the hell is this?” Lestrade had asked as John tried to appear as inconspicuous as possible.
“You’re a morally centered person,” Sherlock excused. “I thought you’d object. I thought you’d stop talking to me.”
John climbed down to stretch out against the bottom of the boat and Sherlock followed, fitting himself under John’s arm and against his chest. Sherlock was the taller boy by far and yet this was the position they always took. John was simply too much of a nurturer. Sherlock assumed his usual task of drawing pictures on John’s side and John laughed.
“Oh I’m sorry.”
The crowd, it seemed, was willing to cheer at anything Joan said. Sherlock could hardly blame them, despite the fact that Joan's speech seemed more like of a mess of quotes than anything grandly penned. She’d barely taken her eyes off the blonde the whole time, her arms just a mess of gooseflesh. But Joan wasn’t done.
-call disconnected-
“God, I miss you.”
With an almighty internal sigh, John came over and wrapped his arm around the counselor’s shoulder. “What’s this then?” he pressed. “You saw us kiss in a raft.”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow as though sizing John up. John could understand why Jamie had wanted to hook up with the boy. He wasn’t just good-looking, he was far too sexual for his own good.
Sherlock can’t meet his eye. “He doesn’t mean to.”
"Perfectly fine, minus the fractured wrist," Patrick said. "He still calls his injuries perfectly, your husband. And is this Annie?" he beamed, peering behind Sherlock to where Hamish still sat, a bit shell-shocked, bouncing his daughter.
“He must have heard them arguing and assumed the deal was off!” Sherlock was ranting, gathering steam, and John retreated to a corner with Hamish. “But how could he have-“
“I abhor dogs,” Sherlock protested, sinking even further in his seat than John though possible, just the tips of his black curls visible over the dash.
“Expect her to be quiet tonight,” Amelia murmured to John and Sherlock as Hamish chattered to Chloe about all the different sweeties in the machine downstairs. “The session was hard but she handled it very well. Maybe just stay in and coddle her. You have my number if you need me.”
Shut up.
“Well that’s this one explained,” Mrs. Emily smiled encouragingly as Sherlock hissed something to John that sounded like “Don’t you
“What is it, love?” John asked blearily, immediately concerned.
“Half hour?” Lestrade estimated and they sat down to wait.
“So,” Joan called out. “Who’s on board?”
“-drifting awayyyyy, waaaaaaaaaave after wave-“
“Yeah, sorry, just- in my head,” she coughed, trying a weak smile, but Joan indulged her and just squeezed her hand again.
“Wait here a second,” he said and ran into his room. He was back in a minute with what looked like lube and a box of condoms.
she thought back but didn’t say anything as the M train sped on into Brooklyn.
“You go to sleep,” Sherlock said, moving to take the chair next to Hamish from John. “I’ll stay up with him in case he needs anything.”

“He will be more interesting than me, one day. And when he is, people will want to hurt him. They’ll hurt you, John,” Mycroft told him, looking firmly at the teen. “They’ll kidnap you and torture you to get to him. You’re his heart John, and they’ll try to burn you.”
There was a little murmur of admiration after that statement and the circle kept moving. The first hour passed that way, with Siobhan giving them question prompts that were mostly general, with a little personal pry at the end, warming them up to each other. All fifteen of the women were fascinating, Sherlock thought, as she deduced them herself in between turns. But all had that vague discomfort about them that Joan had been carrying, something nervous in the eyes. Sherlock hated to feel like she was the only one who didn’t know what was coming, but every time she tensed, Joan squeezed their joined hands and she remembered why she was here. Soon, Sherlock knew, they’d come to the whole point of this meeting and then wouldn’t Joan see how much she could trust Sherlock, how good of a friend she was, how deeply-
