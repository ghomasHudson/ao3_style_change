Dean pursed his lips but didn’t say anything.  He gave Jess a smile.  “My name is Dean Winchester.  I’m looking for someone who works here.  A doctor?  Called Castiel?”
Castiel sat on the edge of the hospital bed and lay down.  He focused all his will into reconnecting with his flesh and bones, visualizing the blood in his veins and the air in his lungs.
Dean felt as though he was being smothered in an elderly aunt’s voluminous bosom: every inch of the place was decorated with furniture, throw pillows, replicas of that statue of a naked guy, thick tapestries, area rugs upon carpets, tables, arm chairs, buffets, paintings and framed pictures – there was nowhere to look that didn’t have a thousand things crowded into a too small space.  And the smell.  It was as though every particle of fabric had been doused in lavender oil.  It clawed at his throat and made him want to open a window or rip off his nose.  He sat on the couch and thought he would disappear in the soft pillows as a puff of scented powder exploded into the air around him, setting off a coughing fit and amplifying his headache.
Castiel nodded.  This was where Dean would accuse him of interrupting his sex-capades.  “What did you tell her?”
Dean turned and startled as he realized the idiot was standing in the same spot as Castiel, their images superimposed resulting in a strange double vision.  “Uh… Do you feel a cold spot right now?”
He hadn’t expected the frown to form on his face though as he glanced around behind him.  He wondered at the reaction as he let his hand drop back to his side.
“You’ll have to excuse the mess; it’s been a rough couple of days and it’s amazing how quickly things get out of hand with two little monsters running around.”
He straightened up suddenly as he heard the scraping of the key in the lock behind him.  He turned in time to see Castiel pushing the door open and walk in, home from a long shift at the hospital.
With a jerk of his head, the bottom of the glass was drained, and he clunked it back down to the wooden counter, gesturing to the man behind the bar for a refill.  Dean’s head bobbled on his shoulders and Castiel took a closer look at him.  “You’re inebriated.”
Dean turned his head in time to see the green bouncing fairy wings run away from the table and behind the open pantry door.  He turned back to Gabriel though, his conversation with him what was most important right now.
Dean shook himself out of his distracted funk and turned onto Valencia St.  He found his destination a few buildings in, the spacey, hand-painted sign announcing “BOOKS” in golden brown lettering sticking out from the store front was the first thing he saw as he approached.  The storefront frame around the large windows was quite uniquely painted itself with a new-age-feel, space blue with stars and planets like the accent wall in the bedroom of a space obsessed child.  In the window display, Dean spied old antique furniture and shelves filled with books, the old and rare mixed right in with the new and popular.  The lettering on the window announced that he had arrived at the Abandoned Planet Occult and Metaphysical Bookstore.
Dean shifted from one foot to the other, keeping his eyes on the photo.  “You look great.  Happy.”  Castiel nodded remembering the night.  “Who’s the dude?” Dean asked tapping the sable-haired man with the fake black mustache who had his arm around his shoulders.
The instruments on the tables fell back to their original neutral positions and stilled.  Sam’s eyes were drawn to the card sitting on his desk, the twin flames of the soulmates writhing together until they were but one.
In the meantime, Dean tried to regain some form of control over the conversation.  “I’m not looking for money, sir.  I’m just trying to find my friend—”
The sleek black Impala drove away, the engine rumbling loudly and then slowly fading into the distance as Jody Mills came out of 426 Alvarado St.  She gazed off down the street absently as the last of it disappeared, drowned by the rest of the traffic sounds.  Then, her mind returned to the patients she would be meeting within the hour and she quickly locked her door and made her way down to the nearest MUNI stop that would take her to St-Matthews.
Castiel spent the rest of the day devising new ways to make sure Dean didn’t have a moment of peace and quiet.  Dean was too stubborn to do anything but dig his heels in and show the insufferable dickwad how impervious he was to his childish tactics.  Didn’t stop him having a mild heart attack though every time blue-eyes appeared out of thin air right where he least expected him to be.
Castiel walked slowly, marvelling at the beauty that had miraculously sprouted on his roof.  As he approached the spiral centre of the deck, he realized that he wasn’t alone in this dreamland.  A man stood with his back to him, bent over at the waist as he worked a trowel in one of the larger pots. He straightened up and turned and Castiel recognized the man from the hospital at the same time that his eyes found him. He put the trowel down and started walking towards him, removing his gloves and tucking them into the back pocket of his jeans.  Castiel felt that uneasiness take hold of him like it had at the hospital, prickling his scalp.
Dean leaned in towards him.  “That matchbook had more than some random address as a clue.  It came from somewhere, which means maybe you were there too.”
Dean swallowed forcefully, stunned a moment by the man’s passionate intensity on the subject.  He recovered quickly though and raised his eyebrows, returning to his more comfortable skeptic sarcasm.  “You’re like a walking encyclopedia of weirdness, you know that?”
“Dude, come on, seriously?” she said, looking up at him like he had just insulted her, her parents and all her ancestors.  “We’re friends.  I’m not charging you here.  Besides, helping damsels in distress is kinda my thing.”
Castiel glanced at him, but didn’t dare linger, “Maybe the dry cleaner was right about me.  Let’s go.”
“Is that pie?” Dean asked, looking at her expectantly, forgetting his momentary disappointment that she wasn’t a blue-eyed man in a stupid trench coat.
Castiel looked up from his wallowing, only slightly surprised that they were no longer in the car, unsure what to answer.  Dean had agreed to help him only because he had bullied him into doing it, and for what?  “I’m sorry, Dean.  This isn’t turning out like I had hoped.”
Fear gripped Dean as he looked down and realized that it was true, there was nothing left of the breathing apparatus that had been forcing air into Castiel’s lungs.  In his attempt to save him, he had unplugged him as surely as if Crowley had done it.  He felt his heart squeezed, and he could barely breathe.
“Pretty sure that apartment was vacant,” she informed them.  “But you’re more than welcome to drop in any time.  I make a mean roadhouse chili.”
Dean nodded, taking a few steps towards the door but then turning back.  “It just feels weird, okay?  Leaving you here, alone.”
The waiting emptiness and silence sighed with relief as the sound of a key in the lock signaled the occupant’s return.
Dean cautiously walked through all the rooms in the apartment: kitchen, hallway, bathroom, bedroom… when he got back to the open space of the living room and there was still no sign of him, Dean could only conclude that the man had disappeared as suddenly as he had arrived.
The quiet of the apartment pressed down on him again and a part of him considered turning on the television just so he could banish it for a time.  He glanced around the shadows in the hall and in the further parts of the living room area cast by the bright lights in the kitchen and the muted light over the dining table – the only ones he had thought to turn on.  He realized that he wasn’t put off by the dark and quiet as he had been for such a long time now.  They were peaceful for the first time in many years and he breathed deeply before standing up to bring his plate to the sink.
“No, this is him!” Charlie told him, incapable of keeping the surprise out of her voice, though she was speaking softly.
“What does it mat…” Cas’s speech was cut off as Dean suddenly turned and toppled them both onto the bed, Dean landing right where he wanted between Castiel’s legs, and crushing the rose petals under their bodies, releasing their sweet perfume.
Dean was about to make a snarky response when one of the four weirdos walked up to him while the rest dispersed all over the apartment with gadgets that blinked little lights and emitted strange whirring sounds in some strange language only they could understand.  The one holding the camera had followed who looked to be the leader and was now aiming his lens right at Dean.
Gabriel came back into the room and Castiel turned to watch him.  Dean glanced at the drawing in his hand and he quickly folded it in four and stuck it in the back pocket of his jeans.  When he looked around so he could talk with Gabriel, it was to find that the other man had pulled a long knife from the butcher block and came right at him, slashing the air.
Dean stared at the closed doors, a steady whistling sound in his ears as his mind registered just how completely screwed he was.  He couldn’t just wait for another elevator, and he pushed against the slippery tiles to get Castiel’s body moving again; he would have to try for the next wing again.  As he moved into the open area near the nurses’ station, he realized just how trapped he was.  He stopped the momentum again, spinning the gurney as he turned to look down each of the five hallways branching out from the centre.  Guards and nurses and attendants, visitors and patients blocked their escape and Dean repeated, “No,” with each turn as the panic took hold.  As he came to a full stop, his eyes landed on Crowley, holding a bloodstained tissue to his face. Beside him stood Jody and Gabriel.
Castiel rolled his eyes. With a blink he was on the street, intercepting Dean on his way to his car.
“Alright, chill,” Charlie pulled a small notepad out of her royal blue blazer’s inside pocket and unclipped the pen.  “So, when you saw this guy, were you drinking?”
Dean should have been relieved that there was no answering “Hello, Dean,” from the corner by the door.  Just like he should have been happy that searching through the rooms revealed that Castiel’s spirit had done like he had said he would and stayed behind with his body.
“Is everything under control there, Ms. Tran?”  Dean called out to the woman a bare second before the strident sound of the smoke alarm filled the apartment and sent the two running out the door.
“Uh, hi.  I just moved in on the top floor.  I was wondering, if you know anything about the guy who lived there before me.”
“Oh my,” slurred speech, unfocused gaze, “Has anyone ever told you that your eyes are as blue as the deepest ocean?”
The dry cleaner’s shop was a tiny single floor building flanked on one side by an eightplex, much like Castiel’s own apartment building, and on the other was a simple hardware store with a residential loft above it.  Castiel followed Dean as he made his way uphill from the apartment and walked into the squat, white building with the forest green awning.
“Okay, Dean.  Here’s what we’re going to do.  We’re going to take a walk upstairs.  There are people there who can help you.”
“Doesn’t it make sense?” the man hunched forward a little, a light sparking behind his eyes as his voice took on a hushed, urgent tone, “So, get this, if a human is only flesh and bone, then yeah okay, when the body stops working it decays and returns to the soil.  But how do you account for the twenty-one grams?  MacDougall theorized in the early twentieth century that the human soul had weight.  He concluded that the loss of weight on the moment of death was a direct result of the soul departing from the dead vessel.  So, if that’s the case, it makes sense that that energy, that 21 grams of soul, can continue to impact and affect the world around it… if it chooses to stick around that is.”
Castiel stood in the kitchen watching the spot where Dean had disappeared and wondered why he felt so empty inside.
The morning after the encounter with the stranger in his apartment, Dean had found himself unusually motivated.  He’d gone down to the hardware store and picked up a deadbolt for the front door to keep out any other lunatics who might wander in.  The whole thing had taken an hour of his life, and as he stood pulling on the door handle to test the bolt’s effectiveness, he barely felt a glimmer of accomplishment before whatever energy he’d had was sucked out of him and he sank back onto the couch to resume his binge of daytime TV.  Before he knew it, another day had come and gone and he had headed into the bathroom to try and shower away the achy, cruddy, exhausted feeling that seemed to have taken a firm hold of him in the past two years.  Ever since…
Gordon Walker was in the antechamber with ‘The Flight’. He was still in human form, shoulders tense with aggression.
“He may not be as well-known as Merlin, but I’ve heard the name before. What does it say about him?”
Perhaps encouraging Dean to take off his coat had been an error. The waistcoat he wore fit him quite well, cut in a way to accentuate the breadth of his shoulders and the strength of his arms. Castiel cleared his throat. “Would you care for something to drink? I don’t keep much here, but there is water, and I think I have some beer still.” He headed towards the kitchen, feeling uncomfortable in his own home.
Dean went to Cas’ place on Sunday to help with prepping the garden, now that the weather was getting steadily nicer. It was going to be a couple weeks before he’d be able to start the addition, with other clients and his woodworking commissions to catch up with, but he could still allow himself to hang out with his friend on the weekends.
“So… the guests who will be staying at the estate. There will be Grandmother Shurley, of course. Anna. Her parents, my aunt and uncle Naomi and Zach Adler. Their other two children, Michael and Lucius, along with their families.”
Cas couldn’t breathe. His eyes went wide, staring at Dean for a long moment before he flushed and looked away. “Oh.”
“Yes. Expanding the kitchen, adding a proper family room and attached garage, expanding the master bath upstairs and adding a second floor above the kitchen as well, with two additional bedrooms. I don’t need them right now, but… well. Perhaps someday I will have need of the space.”
“So we have leftovers.” She grinned. “It’s all good. We can bring some in to work and leave them out in the break room with a cutely lettered ‘Happy New Year’ sign. And I can bring some down to Mrs. Horndoggle, too.”
Cas enjoys watching Dean at the country club. Cas knows him well enough to know that this type of setting hits all of his buttons, everything that makes him feel inadequate and out of his league – and yet, almost no one can really tell. Cas knows because his smile gets brighter, his laugh louder, his body language more exaggerated.
Gabriel worked the lower cabinets. “You’ll need a car,” he said, making a face at an old cookie sheet that was stained and warped. He set it aside in a ‘toss’ pile. “You’ll need a lot of things, but a car will be a pretty high priority so that you can get the other things you’ll need.”
Once they’re in the room they share, Dean kicks off his shoes and flings himself onto the bed. It bounces three times before settling.
Dean winces sympathetically. Cas not going to his cousin’s wedding isn’t really an option. He’s close to his immediate family, not quite so close to the extended family. Dean’s known Cas’ parents and siblings since they were in college. He hasn’t seen them often, but they’re good people. On the other hand, he’s never met the aunts, uncles, and cousins — though he’s heard plenty of stories.
It’s one thing to share a bed with a good friend. It’s quite another to share one with someone he’s attracted to, and has been for years.
Dean was in the middle of painting the kitchen walls when the front doorbell rang. Cas looked out the windows of his study to see a delivery truck in the yard. He frowned. He wasn’t expecting any deliveries, was he?
Dean came to his side, bare arm pressed against Castiel’s, and looked at the open book. “The drawing of the object said to hold the essence of the sorcerer Malak?”
Castiel felt uneasy, but rationalized that perhaps he had gotten delayed. It didn’t have to mean he’d run into trouble.
“I don’t particularly like it either, but I don’t see a hell of a lot of other options. Look, I won’t take all day. I’ll be back here before dinner, and we’ll decide what to do. Oh, and while you’re studying ways to disrupt their ritual, maybe see if you can find some other magic spells that might be useful, hm? We know you can do it, now.”
Dean nodded unhappily. “As an investigator, you’re trained never to tell what you know. You need to listen to what people say, figure out who knows what, try and get corroborating evidence without prompting it. Doesn’t mean I don’t feel horrible about it right now.”
The book lay there, tempting Castiel with its mysteries. “I can translate it,” he finally said. “It will take some time, and my rates are not inconsequential.”
The tour ended where it had begun, in the vast courtyard where the reception after the ceremony would be held. He looked around, impressed despite himself. Lord Michael had reigned over the humans of North America for over two hundred years, and had spared no expense in the construction of his royal palace. The courtyard was open to the sky and large enough for Lord Michael to enjoy in his immense draconic form. There were elaborate fountains and gardens, pathways paved in marble and inlaid with semi-precious stones forming intricate designs. One entire section was cordoned off and transformed into a staging area for the event design team.
“Not long. I just have to boil the pasta. The sauce has simmered long enough for the flavors to be fully integrated.”
“I have no doubt of that. I didn’t say anything. I love your vocabulary.” No lie there, either. Cas uses words the way Dean uses physical tools – precisely, exactly, specifically. It’s ridiculously hot.
“Thanks,” he said, pulling out a chair. It rocked slightly when he sat down. “I always sat in here when I was meeting with Mrs. Albright, too. From what I learned from her you hadn’t spent any time with her recently.”
Mildred chuckled. “Oh, you’re a rascal, aren’t you. Don’t tell me. Sales.” Mildred’s eyes sparkled with amusement. He got the feeling she thoroughly enjoyed a nice little game of flirting. She was clearly an older lady, late 50s or early 60s, and warm. Good choice for a receptionist position, he thought. Good first impression for the company.
Dean poured Cas a glass of ice water. “Man, that’s crazy. I just… I can’t pretend to even begin to understand that.”
Adler picked up one of Dean’s pens from his desk and started playing with it, set it down, then picked up the weird stress ball Sam had given him a couple years ago. When he squeezed it, its tongue and eyeballs popped out. It was the ugliest thing on earth.
“Huh. Wouldn’t have pictured you in a high rise. You don’t seem like the glass and steel type, especially not with how you’ve taken to this place.”
Sam smiled softly, reached out to brush his fingers against Cas’ elbow lightly, briefly. The merest hint of contact. Cas appreciated the restraint. He was far more comfortable around Sam and Dean than most people other than Gabriel.
“We broke up a week ago,” he admits. “Dean offered to step in so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the aftermath.”
Chuck lightly bumps his shoulder against Cas’. “It makes me happy to see you with Dean,” he says softly. “I always thought it was a shame that the two of you hadn’t gotten together. You’ve always seemed so right for each other. But I didn’t want to be one of those people who assumed that just because you were both open to dating men, that you should automatically be dating each other.”
There was a bar not far from the apartment the Wing kept in the city. Castiel and Charlie found a table off to the side and ordered, craft beers that she chose. “You’re going to like these,” she promised him. “It’s a honey ale. You and your honey thing.”
“Dad…” Cas can’t help but protest. “A gay man can live with another man without their relationship being sexual in nature.”
But if Dean died, and he did nothing? If the ritual was completed successfully, and the spirit of Malak was loosed upon the world?
“Eileen? Oh man, Eileen is awesome. She totally kicks ass. Keeps Sam in line just by giving him a look, and that is so cool to watch. I liked her a lot. She’s deaf, so took a little bit for me to remember to face her when I was talking, but she reads lips quite well. I need to sign up for an ASL class, though, so it’s not all on her. That hardly seems fair.”
“I know I will. Damn, do you know how hard it’s going to be to finish up working this afternoon, knowing that’s here?”
The image on the tablet was so much less than the reality, however. Seven months. Seven long months since the raid on Enoch River had succeeded in ripping the Novak Wing’s greatest element of Hoard away from them. The cost had been dozens of lives. Most of those lives had been human, people who had chosen to become part of the Wing’s community. Those lives were, in the end, far more important than ‘The Flight’, yet the painting was more than just a magnificent piece of art. The artist had woven lost magic into every brush stroke, imbuing the piece with the very essence of what it was to be a dragon. The image was a representation of the mating flight of the greatest of their ancestors, Novak herself, claiming her mate and founding their Wing with the ideals of community and coexistence with the humans of the world.
“Especially when the new people are reclusive and avoid making public appearances even in such simple, ordinary locations as the grocer.” Dean could hear self-condemnation in that tone.
Castiel blinked once, twice, and shifted. His neck and shoulders were sore, as was his ass. He wasn’t entirely sure how long he’d been sitting here, but it was getting dark out now, and it had still been morning when he’d retreated to the turret room. He scooted forward and reached back to turn the handle, cracking the door open slightly.
“Why?” On the surface it was a simple question, but Castiel suspected the answer wasn’t simple at all. “Obviously you don’t owe me any answers, but… I would like to know. If you are willing to tell me.”
He picked up a frozen turkey roast, one of those meatloaf-shaped things that came with gravy in a plastic packet. No need to go any fancier than that, really. It was still turkey. Buy a box of instant stuffing, another for mashed potatoes, toss in a can of corn and a pre-made pumpkin pie and they were golden, right?
Cas quirked a smile at that. “I have little doubt she will be a formidable opponent once she understands that game pieces are to be moved on the board, not chewed on.”
She laughed. “Yes. Anyhow, he’s a manager. Supervises the maintenance staff, so that means that we’re on the wrong side of the rules.” She shrugged helplessly. “What can you do? It makes more sense for me to leave than him. He makes more than I do, and I’d have the easier time finding something else. He’s worth it.”
In the end it didn’t really matter if he was a reliable source. It wasn’t like Dean was devoting extra manpower to hunt Walker down. Should he be doing that? No. His fingers twitched with the urge to do just that, but… no. The wedding was today, all of the important venues were covered, everyone had been alerted to be on the lookout for either the human form Gordon Walker or, worse, the dragonkin.
He looked up through his lashes, shy and weirdly vulnerable. “Are you sure? I… am generally not very good at this kind of thing.”
Something felt off. He frowned, centered himself, even closed his eyes for a moment. People tended to rely too much on their vision. When he closed his eyes he could hear better, smell better, even taste better. Taste. Taste and smell were closely related. There was something different in the air, the faintest flavor of acrid smoke.
She helped him to his feet, then led him around to the front of the house, carefully avoiding any of the area that might have any evidence. She took a couple pictures of his injuries, for evidence if needed. “Doesn’t seem like you’re injured enough to send you to the hospital, but let me take a look. I’ve got first aid certification.”
Fuck. The heat rose again in his face. “Thank you?” He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. But somehow his traitorous mouth opened and started talking anyhow. “You’ve read Steven Emmanuel?”
Cas’ expression crumples briefly before he gets control again. “I just…” He clears his throat. “I’m sorry, Dean. I don’t mean to be so dramatic. But I miss you, illogical as that is when you’re right here.”
Cas’ smile turned fond. “Claire is beautiful. I have some new pictures, if you want to see them later.”
Cas turned his hand under Dean’s so that he palm was up, and circled Dean’s wrist with his thumb and forefinger, rubbing the knob of Dean’s wrist briefly before releasing it and clasping his hands self-consciously in his lap.
, and he would be most unhappy if it met the same fate as his office. Thinking of his office still made his stomach turn.
Cas nods slightly. Lord knows he has no idea how to sell this. Dean, however… Dean is entirely charming and has the glib tongue of a snake oil salesman when he wants to use it. He should have gone into sales rather than becoming a radiology tech. He would have been quite successful, between his extreme good looks and his engaging charm. Cas would certainly buy anything he chose to sell.
Dean got to his feet and took cover around a corner, sighting down the barrel of his sidearm, looking for a shot — and wondering what the hell was taking the backup so long to get here. Surely that trumpeting dragon roar would have caught someone’s attention.
He’s propped up in the bed, reading on his Kindle, when Dean returns. Cas can’t help but look at him. He’s seen Dean in his sleep pants and tee a million times, yet somehow this feels different. His hair is a little damp around the edges, where he splashed water onto his face. It’s a little longer right now than he sometimes wears it. Cas likes it this way. It gets tiny little curls that he very much wants to play with, but knows he’s not allowed.
“She likes you,” Sam’s quiet voice drifted over the sound of the baby’s breathing. “She doesn’t always relax that way with people she doesn’t know.”
Dean picked at the seam of his jeans. “What kind of an ‘oh’ is that? The ‘oh’ bisexuality is gross kind of an ‘oh’? Or a ‘my world just shifted on its axis’ kind of an ‘oh’?”
While Cas pulled the plate of sandwiches and a pitcher of freshly squeezed lemonade out of the refrigerator, Dean found a couple plates and set the table. “Another couple weeks and it’ll be warm enough to start planting things.”
. It looked like a really soft sweater, too, in a rich blue that brought out the color of his eyes. The fit was amazing, stretched slightly across his chest without looking tight, clinging to his shoulders and biceps before tapering down to his hips. It was a v-neck, a shallow one, but enough to reveal the hollow of his throat. He was wearing jeans, too, worn jeans that… yeah. That should be illegal. Dean swallowed hard, biting down the urge to ask him to turn around so that he could check out his ass. Were they actually the same pair he’d worn on that casual day, a couple months ago? The ones he couldn’t look away from?
He had the vegetables cooking away in the kettle when Dean knocked at his door. He wiped his hands clean on a towel as he went to the entrance. “Welcome, Dean. Please come in. Did you have any difficulty finding the house?”
“Good places to eat, some nice local bars. Not too far from Charlie’s place. You’ll like her. She’s awesome.”
“Right. I don’t know that he wouldn’t. I’m not sure that treating him with kid gloves is the right answer.”
Cas swallows and leans forward. Dean made the first small breach in the walls they’ve erected between themselves. It’s his turn to smash them into oblivion.
“Gotta tell you, one of the strangest things? Seeing the new sales associates starting fresh out of college. Was I ever that young?” Dean asked, sitting at Burger Heaven with Cas and Charlie. He dunked a trio of fries into his ketchup.
Cas obeys, and Dean is right. It’s that easy. It helps that it’s a slow song, and Dean isn’t trying any elaborate choreography. It’s not like Dean is a trained dancer either.
More often than not, Cas stayed at Dean’s late enough to share dinner. That was bittersweet. He was growing to enjoy the company far too much. The only other time he’d regularly shared meals with someone, after leaving his childhood home, was with Bartholomew. These dinners were vastly different. Where Bartholomew had insisted on gourmet meals presented on a perfectly set table, Dean was perfectly happy with paper plates and a table that hadn’t been completely cleared from Cas’ work earlier in the day. He was more interested in talking to Cas, discussing how the house had progressed, what they’d done, what was coming up next. He also asked questions about what Cas had done during the day. It was amazing, and satisfying, and sometimes, when he thought about it, utterly terrifying.
“Somewhat. Mrs. Crombie does keep me informed about local events. I understand that he’s moved to Havenport recently, purchased the Debensham estate and undertaken some renovations. I further understand that he comes from a wealthy family, though I’m unclear as to what industry they have made their fortune in.”
Cas wasn’t expecting the tremor that hit him as soon as he saw Dean — nor was he expecting him to cross the space between them and wrap him up in a tight yet careful hug. “You okay?” he said gruffly against Cas’ ear.
Dean just looked up at him through those ridiculously long gold-tipped lashes. He didn’t say a word.
It was late; Dean should call it a day soon and get his four hours. Still, he should make one more circuit of the courtyard. He’d just gotten back from the cathedral and a long discussion with Garth. The guy was even worse with the puppy dog enthusiasm than Sam. It was fucking exhausting, and then there had been the parting hug. He was annoying as all hell, but somehow he was growing on Dean.
“Yes. It is.” He brushed his hands off on the seat of his trousers. Cas looked uncomfortable, even nervous.
There isn’t time to get it tailored, so it’s a good thing he’s able to find one off the rack that fits him really well. He’s lucky that he’s got the proportions for that, the sales clerk tells him. He can still get the trousers hemmed and the sleeve cuffs adjusted to fall at the perfect length, and as long as he doesn’t button the jacket it’ll be close enough to a good fit. The shop can do that for him in time for him to pick the suit up on Tuesday – the night before they have to leave for the wedding.
“I wanted to tell you in person, before the rumor mill hit,” she said, stepping inside and closing the door.
“Whatever it is that he’s involved in, you think that magic is a part of it,” he slowly said. “Especially since Mr. Tran gave you this book. Are you thinking that you’ll work one of these spells? Most of them seem relatively innocuous, so far.”
“No kidding.” Cas could see Gabriel’s ear-splitting grin as clear as day. “Anyhow. One more thing, before I go.” His voice went more serious, which was quite unusual for Gabriel.
Dean placed his hand on his sidearm, loosening the strap that held it in place, then stepped forward with purpose. “Hey. Do you have a reason for being back here?”
“Hi Dean. Almost done here, if you want to put out the glasses. Jess is probably going to want a quick shower. I don’t hear the mower any more. Is she done?”
It’s obvious when they reach the Blue Sitting Room. There are lots of people around, mostly the adults, but also the smallest children, the ones too young to leave to their own devices. And ok. Blue sitting room. It’s very blue. The walls are a combination of blue paint, blue watered-silk wallpaper, and dark wood trim. The large rug on the floor is a soothing pattern, clearly old. Even the furniture has a lot of blue in the upholstery, with silver accents.
Cas goes still for a moment, then deliberately takes a breath and swallows. “Yes, I suppose that may well be required if they are to actually believe us.” He turns his head towards Dean, regarding him seriously. “We don’t really have to do this if you’re uncomfortable. I have endured my family’s questions for this long. I can get through another weekend.”
Dean’s met Chuck Shurley before. He’s a strange dude… but then, Cas has to have gotten that from somewhere. Both Chuck and Becky Shurley are good people, though, even if they’re a different breed from what Dean grew up with. Becky is sunshine and optimism, though if you hit her bad side you’d better watch out. It takes a lot for her to move someone to the ‘naughty’ column.
“You know what? I don’t even give a fuck. This place isn’t what I thought it was, and if this is the way it is now? Then I’ll happily burn my bridges. I quit.”
He shook his head to clear it, not as a negative. “I… it resonated with me, that’s all. My family has a certain amount of wealth.”
The service was on their second day in Kansas. There was a stream of people from Caroline who came to pay their respects. Luc thought it was morbid curiosity about the old lady’s house rather than any genuine caring. Castiel wasn’t so sure, but then he spent most of the time either in the turret room or out in the gazebo rather than interacting, so how would he know? Being around that many strangers wasn’t an option. Gabriel brought him a plate from the food people had brought, some sort of rice and hamburger dish, another with odd cylindrical diced potatoes --
“Bookshelves. Yeah.” Focus, Winchester. You could possibly do this in your sleep, but working with power tools? Focus and concentration is always a very good idea.
When he’d gotten home, Dean threw himself back on his recliner, putting his arm over his eyes and groaning. He knew he was being dramatic, but damn. He definitely knew himself.
“They do not qualify as gifts when they are my belongings to begin with,” Cas pointed out acerbically. “But yes. The delivery truck arrived and brought the boxes. Is there any sort of labeling system?”
“It’s not so easy to pull back the charm when you’re as awesome as I am,” Dean protested, more because it was part of their little shtick than because he particularly meant it.
“As I said, used to non-traditional options. I’ll be fine. I’ll see you in the morning, you heading back to the archives?”
Cas had arrived the very next day, uprooting his entire life to make sure Claire didn’t have to uproot hers any more than absolutely necessary. She’d lost her parents. He didn’t want her to lose her home, her friends, the rest of her life too. Dean couldn’t help but admire that. Then, as he’d gotten to know Cas better, his admiration had grown into something more. Friendship, sure. Different from the friendship he’d had with Jimmy and Amelia.
“There are over sixteen thousand known species of bees,” Castiel suddenly said just when Dean was starting to think of him as no more than an oddly shaped lamp.
“Why don’t we try telling him the truth?” Dean asked, brainstorming with Castiel, the atmosphere in the car a whole pendulum swing away from what it had been on the way out to the estate.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up again and he licked his lips absently.  Castiel rolled his eyes.  “She’s not exactly subtle,” he said, taking note of her posture and of her needlessly low neckline and exposed cleavage before shaking his head.  Her eyes were moving all over Dean, lingering on certain parts of his anatomy, like his plump lips, the splash of freckles across his nose, the long dark lashes around his eyes, his wide shoulders, his long legs, his…   Castiel looked away again.
“You can’t possibly understand.  All you care about is watching dumb soap operas and… and drinking yourself into liver failure.”
“I’m Sam, by the way,” the man said holding his hand out towards him.  Dean slipped his hand in his uncertainly.
Dean glanced up at Castiel, who frowned at him.  “All right. So, my imaginary friend?  Not imaginary.  He’s actually the spirit of this guy who’s in a coma.  But I’m the only one who can see or hear him.”
“Fine!  I was wasted, alright?  That doesn’t explain why the hell my mind would conjure up some asshole in a trench coat, chewing me out for messing up his apartment!”  Dean saw Charlie mouth the words “Trench coat” as she scribbled in her notebook.  “Stop that, don’t write this down.  This isn’t some session.”
“I’d like you to stay on as attending physician.  You’re of a great value to the hospital, and the team, and unlike some people, you spend more time actually saving lives than kissing my ass… so there is that.  A risky play!  But I like it.”
The door of the room suddenly opened startling Castiel and making Dean turn to look at who was coming in.
Sam bent to pick up the card where it had landed face down on the ground.  He flipped it over and brought it to the table.  The card face was as dark as the back, but it had a strange symbol drawn on it in a dark red like dried blood.  It was a diamond with an arrow pointing straight out of the bottom of it with a swervy 5 drawn through it.  Sam tapped the card with a finger and looked up at Dean.  “This card represents an Unwanted Visitor.”
“Dean,” Charlie whispered angrily as she grabbed his arm and turned him around to face her.  “If you don’t tell me what the hell is going on right now, I am walking out.”
“Drugged out twat wrinkled my Armani suit,” he heard Crowley mumble as he moved away to return to work.
All the fight drained out of Dean, leaving behind sadness and failure as he hunched over the desk taking a deep breath.  Castiel reached his hand out tentatively and laid it on Dean’s shoulder, stopping before he passed right through him.  The man relaxed and then straightened and turned, making his way back to the main door and out on the sidewalk.
Gabriel and Claire caught up to the group and together they continued on their way, leaving behind the bench to wait for someone else to fill the empty seat.
Just as the doors began to close, Ash jammed his hand between them and forced them to bounce back.  “Dr. Masterson, I’m really sorry, but can you maybe check out this guy I’ve got in curtain six?  Bowel obstruction, I think.”
Dean walked around Castiel and pulled off the towel, finally able to dry off the remaining water droplets.  Despite his affected casualness, he was feeling awkward and self-conscious, and he quickly slipped on a pair of black boxer-briefs to hide himself from view.
“Go away!  This is just a dream,” Dean whined between the pillow and the mattress feeling like his head was going to burst.
Dean could feel Castiel watching him.  He looked up, noticing Castiel’s pensive expression.  “What’s wrong?” he asked him as he looped a tube around the handrail for later.
Dean slammed his hands down on the parapet and pushed himself away, straightening up suddenly.  His face was twisted in a snarl so fierce, Castiel knew before he opened his mouth that he would be shouting.  “I don’t want to talk about it!”
: just a quick walk away from his destination.  Dean could remember a time when the whole messed up transit system had him completely turned around and lost.  Coming from a college town in northeast Kansas, the crush of people, some pretty strange to say the least, the never ending traffic, the constant detours because of this festival or that random event had made him feel completely out of place.  But she had loved it.  You could never be bored in a city with so much character, she used to say.
Caught between shame and confusion, Castiel settled for defensive. “You don’t really think I slept with that man.”
“That’s really sweet,” Castiel said with a shake of his head, “but we have to hurry.  Gabriel could be here any minute.”
He glanced up at her face but looked away quickly from her calculating look.  “Oh, you know, same old.  Fighting battles, winning hearts, making maidens swoon.  Made a deal with the Yesteryear Weirdoes.  We’re going to team up to stomp the Shadow Orcs.  You’re still coming to the Mid-Year Jubilee, right?”
Gabriel nodded like he had heard him and Castiel chose to believe he had, even though he could not.  The door opened again and Castiel turned to see who had come in.  He was not pleased to see Crowley.
Dean slouched on the couch, his bare feet up on the makeshift table, legs wrapped in dark grey lounge pants, a simple black t-shirt finishing up the ensemble.  His stubble was growing out, his hair was unkempt, and his eyes were bloodshot – striking a balance somewhere between homeless-chic and lazy slob.
“Oh, and you’re not coming with me anymore,” Dean suddenly declared, walking through to the next room and straight into the kitchen.
He’d been startled out of his wits as he’d wiped the condensed steam off the mirror to find the man in the trench coat standing right behind him. “Get out!” he’d said, his gravelly voice ringing in Dean’s ear as he spun around expecting to be toe-to-toe with the man but instead finding the room empty.
He gripped Castiel’s arm tightly as his other hand came up to cradle his face, his touch so gentle, so warm, so
“Mr. Masterson, I don’t know if you’re aware, but when we come to work at the hospital, they ask us to sign certain release forms.  Do you know your brother’s thoughts on artificially maintaining life?”
Castiel could feel his slowly mounting distress at hearing his friends discussing him so openly.  He knew that if they were aware that he’d heard them, they would feel horrible, but how could they know?  He was imperceptible to anyone.  He moved away from them, to avoid hearing any more of their comments on his non-existent love life and all the things he had missed out on in his thirty years of being alive.  Because they were right in the end.  All that time, and what for?  What was left now?
“One day, I’m gonna need help moving a body, and when that day comes, I don’t want to hear any shit from you.”
“Okay!  Sorry.  Seeing each other is maybe the wrong word for it.  We live in the same building.  We were getting… close…er, um.  It’s not like we had gone on a date or anything… uh. Damnit,” he finished under his breath as he ran a hand through his hair in frustration.
The little fairy came tearing back, drawing all eyes to her as she plopped cookies in front of Dean, her sister and herself, then a fourth one right in front of Castiel.  His eyes met Castiel’s for a moment.
From around a bend, Alex came running and he caught her as she threw herself into his arms, the carefree happiness of a four-year-old impossible to resist.  He smiled as she babbled about the fish in the pond and the dragonfly that had landed on her arm.  As they passed an empty park bench, Castiel was struck once again with that feeling of emptiness, or loss.
Dean revved the engine as the light turned green, “V8, baby.  400 pounds of torque.  Just listen to her purr,” he said smiling like a proud father.
Dean let out a very undignified yelp as he jumped a foot in the air while turning on the spot to face where Castiel’s voice had come from.
Dean frowned, why was that familiar?  He looked down at the coffee cup and saw again the childish hand painted designs around the colourful squiggly letters that spelled out the man’s name.  “Wait.  You had to read that.  You don’t even remember your own name, do you?” he said as he took a step around the coffee table and towards the spirit that was looking less and less intimidating.
Castiel could barely contain his excitement.  He reached forward and took Dr. Shurley’s hand in his, shaking it vigorously.  All of his hard work was paying off afterall. “Thank you, Doctor Sh-” The man frowned at him and smirked. “…Chuck.” The smirk turned to a wide smile and Castiel continued, “Thank you, so much.  I will not disappoint you.  I have so many ideas I want to get working on right away.”
Light was coming in through the frosted panes of a door set a few feet from the main entrance and Dean turned the nob and pushed it open while Donna’s voice drifted from inside the apartment where she was still gushing about light and space.  Dean walked up the steps and found himself on the roof of the building, sun shining down.
“You might be resigned to watching the sunrise and experiencing things for the last time, but what I felt last night?  I’m not giving that up without a goddamn fight.”
He figured that was worth another lick and this time, he got a jerk of Cas’ hips.  “You like that?”  Castiel moaned long and low.  “How ‘bout this?” Dean asked softly just before wrapping his lips around Cas’s head and giving it a quick suck.  “Oh, God!”
“Oh God,” he groaned contentedly against Castiel’s skin and he felt his tentative kiss on his sweat slicked temple.  Dean’s eyes were already closed as he fought the pull towards sleep.  Castiel leaned his head down towards Dean’s face and he turned his head just enough to feel the press of his lips against his in a soft and intimate kiss.
Castiel didn’t have the chance to express his condolences.  In an explosive huff, Dean turned around and headed straight for the staircase that would lead him back inside the apartment and away from him.  Castiel could feel Dean’s pain, camouflaged as it was under a layer of anger.  He turned back around to look beyond at the muffled city’s beauty, and he could not feel the victory at Dean’s lack of presence.  Except for the guilt starting to eat away at his gut, he could only feel numb and tired and fuzzy.  It felt like he was slowly slipping away from himself as his sense of self became more and more vague and out of reach.
A build like this boy had, lying prone on his back, his ribs should have been at least partly visible, certainly easy to feel.
“Hey!  You are not backing out of this dinner, mister!  I have been cooking this damn lasagna for over an hour while the monsters just run rampant all over the house.  DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN HERE?” Castiel pulled the phone away from his ear with a wince, “Go bug mommy you… rugrats.”  More excited squealing growing distant.  “I’m losing my mind here, tell me you’re on your way.”
“Uh, yeah.  Of course.  I wouldn’t miss it,” Dean answered, absently scratching at a stain on the side of the coffee cup.
“You can’t touch me, but I feel you. It’s like you’re touching my core… whatever part of me this… “ he gestured to himself from head to toe, “… is, it feels you.  Your… essence.  We connect and it’s like my whole being is singing, or shaking.  Sometimes it feels like I’ll explode if you touch me.  But then, when you don’t, it’s worse.”
“I’m…” The blue eyes frowned a moment before scanning all around him, jumping from object to object like someone looking for something familiar to anchor themselves to.  Dean found himself pitying him, it was getting clear that the man had no idea he wasn’t flesh and blood. “Castiel.  I’m Castiel.”
Dean pushed back from the mattress, letting his chest hover above Castiel’s as he kissed him long and deep, lazily licking at his lips before pushing past them, dipping quickly into his open mouth and pulling back out again.  He did it a few more times, until Castiel was lifting his head from the mattress trying keep him close.  Dean laid a trail of wet kisses down his jaw, over his chin and down his neck, pausing to give the hollow below his Adam’s apple a lick and a nibble.  Castiel sighed in Dean’s ear.  Dean’s hips thrust forward, digging into Castiel’s pelvis with his hard member.  Castiel’s sigh turned into a groan and Dean did it again, just to hear it.
“It’s too late,” Castiel said calmly as he stared down at himself, wide-eyed, scared.  “My breathing tube is gone.”
“Hey man!” Dean yelled at the barman, effectively stopping Castiel from finishing his suggestion, “Make it a double this time!”
With a determined set of his jaw and a frown in place, Castiel raised his hand and stuck it through Dean’s head.  His reaction was instant as he stood up from his stool swatting at him like he could bat away his hand.  Castiel jabbed at him again, ignoring the numb tingle in his arm as it passed right through Dean again.
“Oh, Dean!  This is…  breath taking!  And with a private access?” Donna had followed him.  “I mean, okay, they didn’t really do much with it, but imagine the possibilities.  It’s like having a whole other floor.”
Dean was fixated on the scene in front of him like he was watching the most realistic 3-D movie ever made.  This was some next level weird.  Castiel huffed, his composure in hand again.  He turned to leave the room mumbling, “The guy can’t hold onto his cards and I’m labeled hostile?”
Castiel looked around the office then back to the black suited man, “Is it everything you thought it would be?”
He released Gabriel, who kept his hand on his shoulder as he looked him over with a nod. “I’m happy you’re back, bro. Just wasn’t the same without you.”
Things could not have worked out better.  Which is maybe why, looking up from turning up the volume on his radio, the bright white headlights didn’t quite register in his mind.  Those could not be there, they could not mean what part of his mind was telling him they meant.  Not now.  Not
Sam quietly pulled a card from the deck and glanced at it.  His eyebrows shot up in surprise and he looked back up at Dean who was arguing fiercely with the empty space in the kitchen.  He put the card back in the deck thoughtfully, then pulled the top card.  “I don’t think I can help you with your ghost,” he declared, staring at the new card.
He was reminded of that as Castiel’s sharp, blue eyes flitted around the room and landed on the candles all laid out, half of which were quietly sending delicate tendrils of smoke up into the open space.  A shy smile spread on Dean’s face and he scratched at his head as he thought about his half-assed attempt at romance, but seeing Castiel’s responding joy suffusing his face, Dean was reminded of why he had set out to woo the man he had been living with in the first place.
“Castiel,” she called after him as he moved back out towards the busy hallway, “There will always be more work.  You have to stop and smell the roses too.”
Castiel turned back to the stillness of the room and took his wallet and keys out of his blazer pockets and put them down on the table in the dining room.  He smoothed his hand over the wood feeling a twinge of discomfort.
Castiel settled back down trying to feel… anything.  He could no more feel his body than he could feel the people and things he moved through without a shock or tickle of connection.  He remembered the feel of moving Dean’s body before when he had pulled him out of that bar and he tried to force that feeling into his own hands raising first one arm and then the other, but his hands stayed obstinately inert, laying at his sides.
Dean slipped his arms under Castiel’s coat and suit jacket, seeking out the warmth of the man’s body to hold tight as he parted his lips, giving his tongue access to lick and explore.  Dean let him set the pace, as he always did, letting Castiel do what he was comfortable doing, without rushing him, but finding it hard to ignore the effect these new wet kisses were having on his body.
When the volume of the television could go no higher and finally Dean could almost not hear the thousand and one inane facts, he thought he had won.  Then Castiel stood up from his armchair beside the television and sat directly in front of him on the edge of the wooden chest that was still overflowing with trash.  He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his intensely blue eyes focused and unwavering, holding Dean’s stare prisoner.  He felt like he was being invaded by those eyes, they were all he could see.  He could barely breathe.
“Nope.  Had to cut him loose, his wants didn’t match with my needs, so goodbye and good riddance!  I’ll be checking out a few bars, maybe make a few calls, see what kind of trouble I can get into.”  Meg leaned back against the edge of the counter on which the coffee machine sat and gave Castiel a once over, “What do you say, Clarence?  Wanna join me for a drink…  or six?”
Dean drank in the sight of him, with his dark hair already tousled, his mouth open to accommodate his heavy breathing.  He was already looking so beautifully sexy, aroused, and…
“Or YOU could!  Why are you tormenting me? You’re the dead guy!”  Castiel didn’t respond, and didn’t leave.  In frustration, Dean threw his arms in the air, sending water droplets flying.  He pulled open the bathroom door as he called out, “Stay!” over his shoulder.
Dean sat down on the couch beside him.  “Don’t say that.  We’ll figure this out.  We got to keep grinding.  That’s how we win this.”
Dean frowned, a sudden thought going through his mind and he reached forward to prod Castiel in the shoulder.  When his hand went right through him, he confirmed his suspicion that he was still not reconciled with his physical self.
Then Charlie grabbed him by the chin and forced him to look at her again.  “Dean Winchester, swear to God, if you don’t start talking, I’m leaving.”
Back at the apartment, Dean pushed open the door with the number nine, pulling his key out of the lock as he looked around cautiously in case the apparition was waiting for him.  But he wasn’t.
The black Impala navigated the busy San Francisco streets of Haight-Ashbury with more grace and dexterity than a car that size should have the right to.  The sleek black heavy metal on wheels slipped fearlessly into gaps between cars that were barely gaps before it wedged itself in, trusting the cars around it to accommodate its size.  Dean looked alert, but relaxed as he turned the wheel this way and that and somehow managed to parallel park the beast one street over from Haight.
“Um, yeah thanks,” Dean said, glancing towards him then back to the guy.  “You think I can get those pants?”
Castiel opened his eyes and was assaulted by the over brightness of the solid white light above him. He closed his eyes; red behind his eyelids. Voices boomed in his ears and that sharp beeping sound, both familiar and alien, was growing more steadily frequent, insistent, impossible to ignore.
They clung to each other, each trying to pull the other closer, trying to pull each other inside, so they would be together forever, so they could feel their souls mingling and fusing once more.  Dean forgot all notions of being gentle as he responded to Castiel’s passion.  Dean could feel the rising need to feel connected to Castiel, to feel him wrap his arms around him like protective wings and it was driving him mad, his movements become much rougher and less controlled.  He nipped at his lips and dug his fingers with bruising strength into the other’s skin, clinging to him.  He could feel his stiff erection growing uncomfortably swollen and he shifted his hips pushing against the skin of Castiel’s stomach, searching for somewhere warm to rub against.
He was fairly certain this wouldn’t work, but he could admit to himself at least that he hoped it would. He took a breath, traced his finger lightly over the Enochian script. He found the start of the spell and began to read aloud, in Enochian.
A sick chill ran down his spine, settling in his stomach like shards of ice. He didn’t… that didn’t mean what he thought it did, did it?
Cas hands Dean a flute of champagne before taking one for himself. “Anna makes a lovely bride,” he observes, watching her with her new husband on the dance floor. The live band is alternating classics for the older crowd with newer music that resonates with the younger people.
Dean closed his eyes briefly. “Fuck,” he swore under his breath. “That’s not only possible, it’s highly likely. God, Cas, I’m sorry. I should have warned you about him, but…”
The people responded to his assertive words and parted the way for him.  He crouched down beside the man, Castiel kneeling beside him as he tried to take stock of the situation without being able to touch. The man was barely more than a boy, slender and youthful.  He had a shaved head and a clean face and looked like the least likely candidate for suddenly not breathing mid-shift.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, looking alarmed, “I didn’t know what else to do.  They’re trying to make my brother sign papers to take me off life support.”
“If you think I’m going to leave you alone in my home, you’re wrong.”  The man was clenching his fists at his sides and Dean suddenly felt the dire need to defuse the situation before the ghost went ballistic on his ass.
The brunette rolled her eyes in response and straightened up to throw away the plastic her now eaten sandwich had been wrapped in.  Lisa turned from the coffee machine with a steaming cup in her hand and Castiel moved up to take her place.  “This is the only coffee I’m going out for.  After my shift, I have to go home and bake twenty-four gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, sugar free cupcakes for Ben’s classmates tomorrow.”
“How do you know this?” Dean asked as the point of the small knife started pressing into the puffed-out skin.
“The ambulance will be here in a moment.  Do you really want to explain to the EMTs how a man with no medical background was able to successfully do a thoracostomy with only rudimentary equipment?”  Castiel watched as Dean opened his mouth to respond, but then closed it again looking flustered.  “He’ll be fine.  Let’s go.”
, he found himself thinking.  There was a split second when he considered letting her down easy and sending her on her way, blue eyes swimming to the forefront of his mind suddenly, but he banished the intruder with disappointed dismissal as he thought about the man calling him a slob.  They had said their goodbyes, what more was left for them?
The shrill sound of the portable heart monitor stabbed Dean’s ears and heart.  The flat line on the screen as Castiel faded ever more snapped Dean out of his haze.
Dean had backed against the edge of the dining room table and he found himself unable to move out of the way as the man continued to walk towards him, eyes narrowed and shoulders hunched like he was about to attack him.  He stopped a handbreadth away, staring him down, the intensity in his eyes stopping Dean from moving, much less thinking.  “You should show me some respect.  This is my apartment.  I was gone a few hours and you broke in and made a mess.”
Eventually, Castiel walked off around the bend of the path and Dean snapped out of his reverie and looked around like he was seeing the estate garden for the first time.  Flowering shrubs and ornamental trees served as frame and backdrop to the curving stone path that coiled into a tight spiral; pink azaleas and blueblossoms, silver lupine and bright fushia all swirled together in controlled chaos.
A strange numbness came over him as he neared the break room where he had spent his few spare minutes here and there to recharge or converse depending on who else was present.  He moved through the wall, no more feeling the plaster and concrete than he would the air on a still day.  Meg was sitting, slumped in the same orange plastic chair he often had found himself dozing in.  In her lap, was a limp salad from the hospital cafeteria, forgotten as she looked off to the side, lost in dark thought.  He could remember the different exchanges they had had over the years, all of which had bordered on the obscene.  She had once called him a unicorn, seeing her now though, he realized how lonely she must have been, all that thorny pain she kept hidden under all her sass.
Dean turned the collar up on his green military jacket and stuck his hands in the pockets as he made his way down the steep incline of the street, moving out of Russian Hill and into North Beach.  He was meeting his friend for a coffee that he’d much rather be a drink, but considering the circumstances, he didn’t think alcohol would be such a good idea.
They pushed the cart into the designated room and following Castiel’s instructions, they set up the equipment on the gurney.
He couldn’t even bring himself to wave at her, feelings of guilt and shame joining the cloud of sadness and loneliness that had been hanging over him for some time now.
like he belonged there.  He grabbed a nearby utility cart and started piling supplies onto the top shelf like he was going through a medical grocery list.
Castiel could almost feel his airways constricting even though logically he knew that he had none to breathe through.  “She’s trying to find someone else to tell you I’m dead.  I am dead.  You were right all along.”
Broken and ruined, the flyer could no longer dance with the wind and it sat on the lawn discarded, ignored, and forgotten.
“Thank you,” Dean said, his hand on her arm, the sound of the ambulance siren wailing as it got closer.
He finished dressing quickly but when he turned back around, the room was empty.  How long had he been left alone?  With a suspicious frown, he looked around, expecting him to be standing behind him, or in his blind spot, but there was no sign of him.  He cautiously opened the bedroom door: maybe he was waiting on the other side of it.
Some time later, more time than it should have taken to drive the four miles, Dean pulled up to the inclined curb and pushed on the parking brake, before climbing out of the car.  Castiel was waiting for him as he stood on the sidewalk looking up at the front door of the Victorian house, lost between the houses going up and down Alvarado street with barely a space between them to make them separate entities.  The only thing that differentiated this particular white wood siding house with the pitched roof from the others was the large 425 nailed just above the garage door.
“Alright!  That’s enough.  We’re going home.  Mommy’s going to cut up your fingers and use ‘em to summon a minor deity to eat you up.”  Gabriel gathered his girls, who had burst into another fit of giggles at Gabriel’s absurd suggestion, while he mutterer under his breath.  Castiel distinctly heard him say “
“Dean.” Castiel waited for him to look away from the shell on the bed and focus on him.  “It doesn’t matter what my body looks like.  I’ve been in a coma for three months.  Persistent comas… people don’t just wake up from them.”
Lydia’s lips pressed against his jaw and suddenly the whole sordid situation hit him like a brick, and he pushed back against her shoulders, forcing her back to arm’s length.
“How would you know?  Just go away.  Go haunt that damned apartment now that you finally got me out of it.”
“Yes, an amazing coincidence,” Crowley said like he couldn’t care less.  “Might I have a quick word?”
Dean could feel a plan starting to form along with the hope that came of the certainty that they could not fail.  He was going to save Castiel and then together they would figure out how to put him back together again.
At first, after returning from his coffee with Charlie, he was jumpy, looking around every now and then because he thought he’d seen the man out of the corner of his eye, but after a little while he grew too exhausted to even remember to be on his toes.  The longer he didn’t appear, the more convinced Dean was that he’d made the whole thing up in the first place.
“Get it together Winchester,” he mumbled as he closed the door behind him, kicked off his boots and took off his coat.  He made his way to the fridge, unable to stop his eyes from darting all around him as he moved from one room to the next, alert, aware, on edge.  He made it to the couch with no incident and by the time he was settled in front of the television, beer on its way to his stomach, he had pretty much convinced himself that his mind had made up the whole thing.
“What is this?  Is this a trick?” the man asked, losing that coolness to his voice momentarily as he tried to grab the phone again and his hand went right through it.  Dean could only shake his head as he stared at the strange phenomenon.  “You wait right there,” the man told him with a glare like all of this was his fault.  “I’m going to use the one in the kitchen.”
Castiel could feel that excitement from Dean, it was almost palpable, like when the air is heavy and charged before a thunderstorm, only he felt so light, almost euphoric.  Dean smiled at him and it was like he was filled with helium.  He suddenly turned, heading for the stairs that led back inside.  “Where are you going?”
“Um… I was… I’ve been away.”  Dean’s voice faded along with his surroundings and Castiel was swallowed by darkness and a total absence of sound.  The nothing pressed in against him like cotton earmuffs making his head feel like it would explode.
With a purse of his lips Castiel raised his hand again and passed it right through Dean’s face.  It felt so strange, almost like someone was stuffing his brain with ice cold, cotton candy.  As it amplified though, it joined forces with his growing headache, and he back up out of arm’s reach, dodging as Castiel tried to jab at his head again.  “Alright, that’s enough.”  Castiel looked down at his hands and his confusion was palpable.  “Listen, buddy, it’s not my fault you’re like this, alright?  I just want you out of my house.”
Dean suddenly sat up and glared at the apparition, the room neither dark nor bright, illuminated as it was by the outside lights.  He noted that the man was wearing that same tan trench coat as before.  “It’s you who’s in here!” he told him angrily, tapping the side of his head with his finger.
He turned his head and looked at the mother-son duo.  She was tiny in stature but had a commanding presence.  On the phone she had practically bullied him into giving her his address not accepting no for an answer when he had called about the purification ritual she had advertised in her listing.  The son was taller, but not much.  He didn’t look like much, an older teen, maybe getting ready for college…  definitely AP.  He had that look.  But maybe under that reedy exterior and flop of hair, he was a fierce fighting machine that could take down a moose.  Currently though, he was busy setting his place on fire.
His booted footsteps echoed in the empty room, no amount of furniture or garish artwork on the walls could ever make that place feel like anything but an empty cavern.  He had made his way to the TV area, its boundaries defined by a contemporary style, red couch, a low metal and glass coffee table, and a blue area rug, the whole thing was lit by a downright terrifying floor lamp designed to look like the Pixar desk lamp… He quietly named it Godzilla.
Castiel moved closer looking down at the smear of red on Dean’s finger and palm.  “That’s just blood,” he told him.
The scattering of pinprick lights along the streets lay spread out all around like a picnic blanket made of stardust spread out from the shore to the wooded hills rolling upwards into the blacked-out heavens.  In the distance, the Golden Gate Bridge stretched from shore to shore like a string of miniature suns.  Shooting stars made their way up and down the various streets as they traveled one path or another and disappeared in the distance.  Beyond the edge of the city shoreline and the many piers, it was pure darkness, as though nothing lay beyond, no spark of life, just a gaping hole the city was forever on the edge of falling into.
Castiel didn’t answer, keeping his own uncertainty to himself.  The next person to open their door was a woman: middle-aged, ash-brown locks from a bottle and brown eyes that looked at her visitor suspiciously at first, but warmed up quickly enough when Dean explained the reason for his visit.
Castiel felt the sadness inside him again and he looked down at his body.  “I don’t know where else I belong.”  He turned to look at Dean again who was just standing at the foot of the bed, one hand on the footrest as he stared at him, at his spirit, where he stood.  When would he be seen like that again, he wondered?
Dean laughed. “He does that.”  He moved past Charlie, walking up to Castiel and standing right in front of him holding up his left hand.  Castiel lined up his palm with Dean’s and held it there.  Dean leaned forward a bit until he could feel the gentle prickling of Castiel against his forehead.  He closed his eyes, just trying to hold on to the feel of him.
Dean watched her sashay her way out of the kitchen and into the hallway and he breathed a sigh of relief.  What had he gotten himself into now? he wondered.  He bent down and picked up his plaid shirt from the ground, feeling a little exposed.
Dean stared at the cards feeling betrayed and angry and hopeless all at once.  “No!  That can’t be it! That’s crap!”
The crystal pendulum on the table suddenly spun in the air without anything touching it and Sam stiffened, his eyes fixed on it.  “He’s here,” he said completely seriously.
“Dean, hi!” the ever enthusiastic and bubbly Donna responded.  “I have some great news.  You are going to flip your lid when I tell yah.”
With a devilish smile and a wild gleam in his eye, Dean walked out of the room.  Castiel thought about blocking his path and suddenly he was standing in the middle of the hallway facing him.  Dean looked behind himself as he slowed down.  “Hey! You’re getting really good at that.”
A grin plastered on his face, Dean thanked Lydia who gave him a wink and blew him a kiss before closing the door.
Castiel pulled away his hand and Dean felt the loss of it like the shore misses the ebbing wave.  “You should get that,” he said, and Dean finally pulled the phone out of his jeans.
Dean wrapped his lips around him again and sucked in his cheeks, pulling him deeper into his mouth.  Dean felt him swell and he pressed the flat of his tongue directly on his head, swirling it around and moving his mouth up and down as Castiel’s come spilled into his mouth with a cry and a groan from the man.  Dean worked him through his orgasm, lapping at the semen and swallowing it down greedily, slowing his motions as the stiffness drained away, leaving Castiel limp and spent.
Charlie startled back away from the bed.  “What did you just call me?  I changed my name.  How do you even know that name?”  Her voice was getting shrill again.
“Hello,” Castiel answered, he did not know this doctor who was smiling down at him, his green eyes dancing as he looked at him, his brown hair disheveled.
First, the sky went from a darkness so complete, only the brightest of the star specs could shine through.  All at once it was aglow with a fresh dawn.  It turned lighter still, the wisps of clouds floating like strands of cotton candy turning shades of pink.  The heavens caught fire, golden light flooded the streets one by one; the fog confined to floating thinly above the water of the bay.  Windows reflected the light blindingly and every piece of metal turned into beacons.
Castiel extended his right hand into the space between them and Dean looked down at it confused: it’s not like they could shake on it.  Dean smiled though, thinking about what it would feel like to touch him, to feel the warmth of his skin, to wrap his fingers around something solid.  With a wistful smile, Dean raised his hand to meet Castiel’s, but instead of clasping the empty air, he lined up their palms, so he wouldn’t have to feel the disappointing reminder of the other man’s lack of physical presence.
Dean sat on the custom sofa that was built into the rounded bow window in the living room with books scattered and piled all around him.  He sat in the semi-dark, the only light coming from the kitchen, the city lights outside and the dozen candles the book in his hands had told him to light.  He sipped at his cup of hot coffee, the headache forming behind his right eye making him wish it was bourbon instead, but he had decided that he would do this thing sober and though he regretted that idea, along with the whole ridiculous séance B.S., he was determined to see it through.  Every time he’d seen the ghost he had been wasted, he needed to prove to himself that it wasn’t all a drunken hallucination.  He put the coffee cup back down on the closed book beside him and looked over the incantation he was supposed to be saying out loud.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, slowly standing up from the couch.  “Let’s start over.  I’m Dean Winchester.”
Castiel looked down at himself fully dressed in enough layers to survive the coldest of San Francisco days.  “I don’t think I can even remove my shoes.”
Castiel moved in on him slowly.  Dean turned his head away, his feelings boiling and bubbling in his stomach ready to erupt.  “What’s wrong?  You can say and do whatever you want to get rid of me, but you can’t handle a little truth thrown your way? The only downside I see to her leaving is that you ended up in MY apartment.”
Dean turned his head suddenly, like he was worried someone walking by would see him.  Slowly, he turned back to look at Castiel, his eyes moving up and down his body and scouring his face as though he was trying to decide if he was real or not.  Finally, with a resigned sigh, he said that he preferred option one.
He wasn’t going to make him ask twice. Dean settled himself comfortably and took him in his mouth again.  He took as much of him as he could, keeping his hand around the base and he started to move up and down, coating him in saliva, making him slick as he increased the speed of his ministrations.  Castiel was reduced to short gasps and moans as Dean worked him with his mouth, the erotic sounds swimming around in Dean’s head as he wrapped his left hand around his own erection and slowly massaged himself.  He moaned around Castiel’s cock and his reaction was instant: he arched against him, thrusting into his mouth out of instinct, making Dean gag slightly as the head hit the back of his palate.
“Hey!” Dean said, moving to stand by the passenger door and opening it with a squeal of hinges.  “I don’t need any drunk prejudice from you, buddy.”  His tone sounded gruff and annoyed, but he smiled as he held the door and gestured for Castiel to get into the car.
Dean dropped back to the pillow with a sigh of relief, his chest heaving.  Castiel smiled at him and then stared out the window again to see the sky finally turn bright blue as the sun rose beyond the frame of the window.  “I’ve never just watched the sunrise before.”
Dean moved off towards the side of the house, walking between the brick wall and the encroaching trees.  When he reached the black wrought iron gate, he checked to see if Castiel was following.  He had a scowl on his face like maybe he did think they were out there to rob the place after all.  Dean smiled in anticipation of what would come next.
“Move out?  That can’t be the solution.  Help me out, here.”  Sam looked at him, his expression unreadable.  “Can’t you… Can’t you talk to him?  Tell him to… pass on or something?”
None of what he said made any sense, and the more the man looked at him, the more uncomfortable he got.  There was something about the way he looked at him, something intimate and desperate.  The man’s hand left the guardrail and reached forward like he was going to take his hand and Castiel was overwhelmed by the certainty that if this man touched him, something terrible would happen.  He shifted his arm away and turned to look at Gabriel again.
The apartment building’s hallways smelled like all such hallways: a meeting of the worlds.  Knowing what goes on behind closed doors is not given to everyone, but a quick run through the smells of close-quartered living in an old Victorian building and you can guess fairly accurately which neighbour likes to fire up the bong, who has too many cats, who can’t be bothered to bring their trash all the way to the bins in one go, and who has a penchant for curried foods.
“Christ!” Dean exclaimed, as he quickly put the coffee cup down on the table.  Dean couldn’t believe that it had worked.  “I think we need to talk,” he said, looking up at the man standing before him.
Gabriel’s tone changed, a hardness in his eyes that showed he was losing his patience with him.  “Listen Dean-o, this is what he wanted.  And I’ve spent my whole life being a selfish jerk, and Castiel, he just went with it, because he was such a good little brother.  It’s time he got what he wanted.  I’m honoring his wishes.”
“Listen buddy, I ain’t buying what you’re selling, okay?  So, who are you really?  You know what?  Scratch that, I don’t care who you are, just get the hell out!”
Lydia started laughing again and he enjoyed watching the affected control she had exuded during their first meeting disappear.  Dean went back to his pie, surprised to find himself glad of her friendly company.  “So, dating right? Ugh.”
“Oh come on, he’s a distinguished looking gentleman.  You’re not into the hot neighbour, maybe you're gay.  No shame in that.”  Dean leaned back on the car and smiled at Castiel expectantly.
Ignore the woman’s bare breasts as he examined her supposed malignant melanoma…  It was melted chocolate… and had nothing to do with the mild tendonitis in the elbow she came in with insisting it was broken… and had since forgotten while she stared gapingly at his face.
Castiel stopped and turned back fixing the man on the window seat with renewed attention while Dean’s eyebrows scaled his forehead.  “What else do the cards say?” he asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“They are oracle cards.  They can be used to tune in to certain energies and vibrations that the human senses can’t necessarily perceive.  I got them off a Salem witch who came to the shop once.”
The look of pure dumfounded confusion on her face would have been funny under other circumstances, but Dean was having a hard time finding humour in anything at the moment.
Castiel pulled the shirt tails from his trousers and let it fall away from his bared torso as he moved into Dean once more, pressing himself against him and pulling him in for an increasingly searing kiss that Dean returned hungrily.  He lay his hands on Cas’ waist, the feel of his skin so soft and warm, his muscles contracting as he turned his body to press even closer.  The bulge in Dean’s jeans was starting to press against the fabric painfully, but he didn’t care.  He would endure all the pain if it meant that he could be like this, with him, forever.
“It was the truth.  All of it.  I was dead, Cas.  I couldn’t feel anything, I was drowning in my own uselessness.”
“That’s really not…  I mean, I don’t want anyone dead…  I just,” Dean stammered, trying to maintain the conversation while his brain was going a mile a minute adding the new information to his understanding of the situation.  If the guy had died, then he really was dealing with his ghost.  What was he supposed to do about that?
Sam from the bookstore straightened up and rubbed his hands together as he looked around, checking his set up.  “Spirit boards can be used to communicate with those who are caught in the veil between worlds; between being alive and moving on.”
“Besides,” Dean went on, turning back to face Sam, leaning his hands on the edge of the desk.  “If we fix his unfinished business, won’t that just make him go poof?  What if I want him to stay?”  Dean cleared his throat and kept going more calmly. “How is it, that I can see him when no one else does?”
Castiel looked around at the shelves of books and followed Dean as he made a straight line for the more open part of the store which was set up with tables overflowing with precariously stacked metaphysical devices and gimmicks.  Castiel looked around semi-curiously then drew up to the desk behind which the tall man was sitting studying something in his hand.  Castiel narrowed his eyes when he recognized the deck of cards from before.
Dean pulled open the door to Caffe Trieste, and spotted the redhead right away.  She was standing at the counter having a seemingly heated argument with the barista.  Knowing Charlie, they had probably managed to get on the topic of Harry Potter and were either now disagreeing fiercely on some inane detail or agreeing fanatically.  He walked up to her with a “Hey,” that made her turn and wrap her arms around his neck in a show of affection he rarely tolerated from anyone else.  “Okay, okay.”
He could barely look at Dean.  He didn’t want to see his pity.  He turned away from him, looking out towards the curtained windows.  Lost in his own despair, just trying to come to terms with the delayed inevitable, it took him a moment to notice the tingling in his arm.  He looked down at it, confused, as the feeling intensified until he could almost feel the hand smoothing down his forearm and squeezing his hand.  He turned to look at Dean and found the man holding his body’s hand.  He had a gentle smile on his face as he looked up at Castiel.
The play park across the street from Gabriel’s was small, but it was green in a neighbourhood otherwise choked out by buildings packed tightly together at impossible angles and paved roads like rolling waves.  It had a breathtaking view of the city stretched out below it: leafy trees with a 3-D puzzle beyond their branches.  A cold breeze blew in from the distant bay as the sun played hide-and-seek amongst the cotton clouds above.  Parents called their playing children to add a layer to their backs so they wouldn’t get cold swinging their feet and sliding on their bums.  Castiel stood watching them, neither warm nor cold, and unseen by those he watched.
Dean turned to look at the bedside dresser, confused, “That was empty when I got here,” he said, feeling his confidence return like he had just broken through hypnosis.
“You need help, Dean,” Castiel tried to say again, but he turned to him and shushed him before he could get any further.
“Oh, yeah, I remember him.”  A shimmer of hope ran through Castiel and he leaned in towards her expectantly.  Maybe, even with the excessive flirting, they had been friends.  “But he was kind of a loner.  Anti-social, you know?  Like a cat-lady,” she suddenly added with a chuckle, “except without the cats.”
Dean moved confidently towards the door, his mind calm like a stream running over polished pebbles.  Castiel moved behind him feeding him information that he absorbed as best he could getting ready for the most important con of his life.  The man in the white lab coat turned when he heard the door open behind him.  He had receding, chestnut coloured hair and a stylish three-day beard.  He looked at Dean with expectant, arched eyebrows.
Dean nodded as he looked around at the shop.  “Anyways,” continued the tall bookworm with the stature of a moose, “What brings you to Abandoned Planet today?”
Castiel looked around, continuing to search for clues and hints of memories.  Dean walked up to the counter where a middle-aged man sat in a chair to the side reading a book.  He had a trim brown beard that was starting to go grey and a stern face hidden under the bill of an old, battered baseball cap.
Jody gave him a sympathetic smile and let the door close behind her.  Castiel turned around and took a closer look at the windowsill.  There were a few picture frames and flower arrangements and every space in between was covered in drawings and crafts all labeled with Uncle Castiel.  Some were clearly meant to be portraits of him; generic round faces with black hair and blue eyes all done in bright wax crayons.  Castiel smiled, warmed by the love of his nieces, memories of them rolling through his mind like a strange montage of family videos.  He remembered their mother with the hair like fire and their father; his brother.
Castiel liked the Japanese Tea Garden the best, with the beauty of the architectural accents and traditional flowers, ornamental trees and shrubs, the many koi ponds and quietly burbling creeks, he found it beautiful and peaceful as he strolled along the paths, tendrils of fog criss-crossing them in various places.
Pleasantries were exchanged between the man and Dean while Castiel waited, increasingly impatient.  It seemed to have been worth the trip though when the man looked down at the dry-cleaning ticket.
“I’m not moving!” Dean yelled, aiming his yelling at Castiel.  On the couch, Sam had stopped moving and was just watching, with raised eyebrows, the part of the drama he could follow.  Dean turned his attention back to him and saw the look of surprised disbelief on the guy’s face.  “Whatever, man.  Screw you.”
Castiel turned in the same direction to see what they were looking at.  Dean was waiting for the doors to open and seeing him, Castiel felt that pang to his gut again.  But it was better this way.  Better for Castiel, and better for Dean.  He would be able to go on with his life and Castiel would just become a strange memory.  The doors opened, and Dean stepped in without a backward glance.
Feeling the weariness starting to dig into his bones, Castiel pushed the door to the break room open, seeking out yet another cup of coffee, the bitter aftertaste of the last three still lingering in the back of his throat.  Did he have any gum?
Castiel howled at Crowley, the man remaining impassive as he tried to convince Gabriel to let him go.  He raged at his situation, being unable to communicate his wishes.  He had been young, and naïve when he had signed those papers.  He knew better now.  There had to be more.  He just needed time.
.  He read on and found other words that together made the flyer even more interesting: Furnished.  Hardwood.  Mason St and Green St.
Castiel looked up to see the man with the rich brown hair and neatly trimmed beard who ran the hospital.  As he turned his light blue eyes towards them, Castiel noticed Crowley squaring his shoulders, a self-important smirk on his face.  Castiel stood beside him, shoulder to shoulder.  Dinner would have to wait; he would not be seen stepping out when lives were at stake.  Dr. Shurley looked at them both in turn, his sharp eyes veiled, revealing no hint of emotion or thought.
Dean shrugged, “Alright then, get your butt over here.” He rolled onto his side and patted the mattress beside him.  Castiel lay down on his side facing him.  Barely half a foot of air was all that separated them and yet Castiel did nothing to close the gap.  Dean liked looking at him, enjoyed the shape of him laying beside him, liked the shade of his eyes in the filtered city light coming in through the curtainless bay window, loved the undisciplined strands of his hair sticking up in the front.
“I don’t know what’s happening to me, Dean.”  He could feel the confusion growing inside of him as more and more he realized that whatever it was that had caused him to be this way… it couldn’t last forever.  He had been so determined to get rid of Dean, he hadn’t really thought beyond what would happen if he succeeded.  He couldn’t even remember who he was, or what kind of life he had before now.  No one could see him or talk with him.  He couldn’t do something as simple as hold a book or turn off a light.  The more he thought about all this, the more the feeling of utter helplessness threatened to overwhelm him, and he stared off into the distance, paralysis setting in.
The impossibility of the man freaked him out and he could feel that twisting panic in his gut: how did he know the things he knew?  A sad smile pulled at his mouth as he dropped his eyes once more.
Dean put the picture back down and Castiel looked again at all the drawings and the flowers.  His family had been watching over him.  It made him happy, but also a little sad.  They had spent three months keeping an empty body company.
“I… I have no idea,” he turned to look at Dean who’s face went from anger, to surprise and then quickly reverted back to his more usual indifference.  Castiel frowned.  “Why are you the only one who can see me?”
“Yes.  All of it.  I worked here.  That’s why the neighbours never saw me.  I was almost always here.”
A male attendant dressed in forest green scrubs and who looked like he was halfway between stoned and drunk handed him two folders, “You’re on in five and eight,” he told him, oblivious to whether or not Castiel could handle the workload.
Dean’s smile is soft and a little shy, and he ducks his head slightly, his cheeks flushing a pale rose. “You think so?”
“Something like that, yeah.” It had taken him a few years after Dad’s death to admit his bisexuality even to himself, but it had also been a few years since he’d told Sam and a few others he was close to. Sam honestly didn’t care at all. Intellectually Dean had been certain he wouldn’t, but it still had been a terrifying thing to admit to. Bobby and Ellen didn’t exactly have a problem with it, but it took them a little longer to decide it was a non-issue.
“I have a meeting scheduled for later this afternoon.” Director Holloway had left a note in his office requesting his attendance at 3:00 this afternoon. The meeting was undoubtedly about Mr. Roman’s intentions regarding the rumored donation.
“Yeah?” Dean looks around. He can’t see that it’s much different from what they’ve been seeing, from the time they left the Washington DC urban sprawl behind them. “Do we need to talk more about how we’re going to do this, before we actually get there?” He probably should have brought it up before this, but he was too busy getting the time off and making sure he had clothes that wouldn’t embarrass him at an east-coast high society wedding.
There was a studied indifference to Roman’s tone. Castiel looked up. “Oh… nothing particularly noteworthy,” he said. “A personal memoir. My personal opinion is that writing it in Enochian was a pretentious choice.” He shrugged. “May I see the Assyrian papyrus?”
Dean snorted. “Happens when your dad takes off for weeks at a time, leaving you on your own. Ellen and Bobby looked out for us once they realized what was going on, but that hadn’t happened yet at that point.”
The first few efforts had been questionable, but now? Dean could honestly say Cas had improved immensely. He loved the way the guy applied himself to anything he took an interest in. There were no half measures where Castiel Novak was concerned. If he was going to do something, he was going to master it.
He couldn’t believe he’d done that. Months of keeping his feelings carefully hidden, and then just like that, he blew it all. He was mortified – and worse, terrified. He had no idea how Cas was going to react to that news.
Dean looked sharply at him, then grinned. “Now that is a sound I don’t think I’ve ever heard before. I like it.”
“Breaking and entering, destruction of property.” He stepped further in, carefully avoiding stepping on anything. After quickly looking around he turned back towards Castiel, stepping close and placing his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, squeezing. “Is anything missing?”
Dean studied his face a moment, then nodded in agreement to let the topic go for the moment. “Very well. What can you tell me of what you saw when you were inside his home? Anything of note, anything that stood out?”
“True, and you can always add some artwork on the walls too. Awesome. You have the paint chip nearby? I want to see it.”
“Good point.” Dean considered for a moment. “You know anyone you can ask to watch the place for you?”
Just as she’d promised that first day, she was always the first face he saw when he came in to work each morning. She always had a smile and a pleasant word. Honestly, she was one of his favorite people at Sandover.
be a blow to both. Not the crippling blow they undoubtedly hope for, but a serious one. Do we have anyone else in the area?” He knew the answer to that. They deliberately kept their presence small. Charlie was here because Castiel needed some support, and her skills with electronics would help when it came time to execute the retrieval of their Hoard.
“Okay, so obviously I don’t know all that much. But news gets out. The Walker dragon was killed, looked like another dragon took him out. The security cameras weren’t working for some reason, so there’s no footage of it. Still, there aren’t too many things that can break a dragonkin’s neck when in draconic form. So there’s that.”
Missouri hums musically down the line at him. “Your brother’s gonna be a lot easier for you to read than yourself.”
Dean knows better than this, too. From the moment Elijah laid eyes on him in that tent, he’s had that stripped-down-bare feeling of being studied crawling over his skin. He’d let himself get drawn in by a pair of pretty blue eyes and a plea for help, overriding everything he’s been taught. If Elijah had been a werewolf, Dean would have shot him without daring to second guess.
For now, though, he’s stuck here, walking the three miles from the hotel to the little ten block area that makes up what this place probably calls a downtown. Layla’s standing under an umbrella outside the pharmacy on Main Street, exactly where she said she’d be. He walks a little faster and ducks down under the wide curve of plastic when she tips it up to accommodate him.
“Oh yeah, it was believed he used the seal to command demons and spirits, so the pentacles were an expansion on the idea. This one in particular? It’s meant to do exactly what the seal did. Funny thing is the rest of the text here. It’s written in Aramaic and talks about binding something specific.”
Sue Ann is standing at the desk, looking at the massive book opened on it. She glances up when he steps into the room and looks deliberately back down towards the text.
Sam doesn’t question the reality of Lucifer. There’s demons, there’s angels, there’s God, and that must mean Lucifer exists. Of course. He feels warm from the trembling in his arms and legs.
“You wanna talk about feelings and braid hair, Cas, I’ll put on Lifetime and call Sam to bring some beads and nail polish when he comes back.”
There had been options. The doctor hadn’t shrugged helplessly at Dean and pronounced him dead in a couple weeks. It was 2006, for fuck's sake. Not the Dark Ages. He’d brought up medications, which Dean had balked at when he’d asked about prices and the nurse had come back with estimates. But, the nurse had argued, they could add time he needed to schedule for a stent and pacemaker, which could give him more time to last through the wait of a transplant list, and maybe, with some luck…
The knife's been sharpened recently and slices cleanly into his flesh, blood welling up and dripping down into the inside of his elbow. Something unfurls in his chest and presses against his ribs, cold and tight. Before he can prod too much at the sensation, Bobby hauls him into a hug and Dean sinks into it gratefully.
The name repeats in time with the beat of Castiel’s grace and Castiel pulls Dean Winchester closer and whispers that his brother is alive.
“I’m still me, damn it!” Dean yells. Bobby debates putting himself between Dean and the windows or Dean and Sam. Before he can decide, Sam breaks out of his grip and launches himself at Dean, grabbing the collar of Dean's shirt and hauling him up. Bobby braces for the impending brawl and takes a step toward them. The TV on the dresser snaps on and fills the room with a blast of static, and something shoves him away from Dean. It's like being struck by a car. Bobby hits the dresser and rolls onto his side as the mirror on the ceiling and windows crack and shatter. He lifts his arms up to protect his head and neck from the falling glass.
Castiel tries not to show his surprise, but it echoes through his body and into Dean’s, eyes widening slightly. He nods jerkily and asks, “What has God commanded of me, Uriel?”
He’s heard about the seals and Lucifer from Castiel when the angels were screaming for him, but Sam fills in him in on what he and Bobby were going through on the ground while Dean was half a country away. Thirty hunters are dead and Dean grieves every damn one with a barked curse, Castiel’s guilt over the lost battle a sharp note in the silence that follows. Ellen and Jo are alive, both still scattered to the winds somewhere out of reach. Dean wonders if Sam told them about him being alive yet. About Cas.
“Not talking about that,” he says firmly. No, they’re not doing that, now or ever. He’s not having a heart to heart about his humanity with the voice in his head. “I want to know if there’s anything else you’re messing with because, uh, we gotta have a long talk if you shut me down completely. Plumbing wise.”
The TV on the shelf to his left clicks on with a hiss of static and the light from outside is bright enough that when he turns to shut it off, he can see the shadow of wings on the wall behind him.
Like him. She doesn’t even know him. It’s aggravating on every level even while Dean’s agreeing with her. Especially because he is.
Castiel drops his eyes obediently to the ground, forces his wings to relax into a vulnerable position. “Unwavering. God’s will is mine.”
“So, there’s a guy out in Nebraska. Hooked up with a reverend and his wife last summer, claiming he could heal people.”
His gaze drifts back over to Elijah, feeling strange talking about him like he’s not part of the conversation. The healer’s turned slightly away from them during Dean’s distraction, staring out the window. He looks like he's two states away from all of them.
It’s still raining when Dean pulls up to the Le Granges' farmhouse; a steady deluge of water that plasters his hair to his skull in the time it takes to walk from the car to the front steps. The crowd of vehicles in the yard has thinned since yesterday, but the RVs are still sitting where they were, and he spots at least one person sleeping in their car when he passes by. All these people have probably been here for weeks, maybe months even, hoping they’ll get lucky, and Dean strolled in and scored without even trying.
“The circumstances of our first meeting were unfortunate,” Castiel says. Sam flinches slightly at the rough gravel quality of his voice. Like Dean when he’s trying harder than usual to sound like Dad, but utterly alien with the way it reverberates in the air. Castiel reaches out and takes Sam’s hand in both of his, pressing it between his palms gently. “Excellent job with the witnesses.”
“I’m alive, ain’t I?” Dean's voice is raspy with sleep and lack of oxygen. He reaches out for the cup in Sam’s hand. “Gimme.”
Dean coughs and blood wets his lips. He winces at the torn up feeling in his throat. The anger on Cas’ face collapses, the pinched corners of his mouth softening into something Dean could almost mistake for concern if he didn’t know better. He steps closer to Dean and presses a hand to his cheek. The bones in Dean's jaw fit back together and he exhales shakily at the soothing wash of healing energy over his tongue and down his esophagus. The tightness is still there when he tries to turn out of Cas’ touch.
Sam shoves his laptop into Dean’s face and lets him look at the electrical storm map. It could be naturally occurring, but Castiel rises up while he reads, so Dean finds himself nodding and passing the laptop back up.
She pulls away. “It’s not just me you have to worry about, Sam. What do you think angels are gonna do when they find out what
Winged figure. Sam lets out a breathless laugh. Angel. It’s an angel. He has to be right. Flipping a few pages further reveals a collection of folded newspaper clippings. He pulls them out and pockets the book. They’re articles about the victims, from the openly gay teacher, Marshall Hall, who died the same day Dean was healed, to a woman, Patricia Wine, trying to open an abortion clinic in the area before her untimely death by lightning strike a few weeks before they got here. The most recent one is an interview with a guy named David Wright about Le Grange Ministries and his firm belief that they’re swindlers trying to take advantage of the good people of Ford City.
Sam can’t help but look down at him, blinking in surprise. He and Dean have never really talked about religion outside of learning what works for killing the monsters that are tied to one or another. Christo works on demons, but not all of them, apparently. Just the ones that believe in it enough to be frightened. The ones that don't, though, well, Pastor Jim had said they'd been lucky it had.
Instead of answering right away, Dean goes and retrieves his jacket. He slips it on, then dumps the hotel room keys on the bedside table. He pauses. “We’re not telling Dad.”
He blinks and the tent sharpens back into focus around him. Elijah is just a man, pulling his hand away and stepping back so Sam can haul Dean back to his feet.
Sam squints suspiciously at him. They’ve been on too many hunts where he’s found a way to wiggle out of research so he can mess around.
“Oh, you should have said we had a guest,” Sue Ann admonishes pleasantly when Dean’s led into the sitting room. It's quick, but Dean catches the way her face twists into an angry frown in Elijah's direction out of the corner of his eye. She smiles at Dean when he looks at her fully. She’s standing at a desk stirring a pitcher of tea while her husband sits in one of the chairs. Le Grange rises to offer Dean his hand, shaking it firmly and leading him toward the couch.
Sam’s in fucking Pontiac. Which is so close to where Dean was buried that he probably could have walked to whatever motel he’s holed up in, if he’d just known where to go. If Dean hadn’t already thought his brother was involved in his resurrection, he’d be dead sure of it now.
“Look, Layla, if anyone deserves it, it’s you,” Dean says, believing it as much as he does anything.
He’s gone before Sam can muster up another word. Maybe he can write a list or something of stuff to ask Cas about when he, uh, apparently flies back in. There’s so much more they could add to Dad’s journal, including a new entry about angels.
That’s something Dean can’t exactly argue or apologize for, so he nods and lets himself accept the gratitude that Cas is trying to express.
“The triumph of the wicked is short,” she quotes, reaching up to touch the silver chain hanging around her neck with the tips of her fingers. At least, Dean assumes she’s quoting something. It sure sounds pretentious enough. When she finishes, she looks back up at him. “The Lord led me to this when He sickened my husband. He sent me an angel to command so I could reward the just.”
“He’s safe with me,” Castiel answers. He looks up at Sam, pinning him into place with a look. “Lilith is attempting to break another seal. Be ready.”
“I’m not passing judgement on you.” Elijah’s clearly trying for reassuring, and it might have worked if he hadn’t followed up his first sentence with, “Your father didn’t abandon you because he found out about the prostitution, Dean. He believes he’s protec—”
Dean’s chest thuds painlessly and the icy cold of his extremities floods with blood as his heart pumps, healthy and strong. His cheeks and neck flush warm under the cool touch of Elijah’s hand and heat settles between his legs. He’s never been more glad to be wearing loose-fitted clothes.
Her mother barrels up the steps toward Elijah, crowding close to Layla’s side in the process, desperation trembling through her body. “This is the sixth time. Elijah, please.”
, Castiel answers when the weak and tortured soul pulses with question after question. It flickers in Castiel’s grip.
“Uh, well…” Not here in front of all these people and helping them fall a little bit more for the shit Le Grange’s preaching. He glances around, eyes landing on people struggling to breathe even with the help of oxygen masks, and then looks back up at the healer. “Maybe you should pick someone else, Eli.”
Uriel subsides, but the glitter of anger and blasphemy in his mouth sticks, held back only by his deference to Castiel’s rank.
He adjusted his shirt collar and stood before Castiel, their eyes nearly level.  He raised his hand and brushed the back of his fingers against Castiel’s jaw, it was like sparks were igniting his whole being, a touch as simple as that one.  “Did you hear what I told your brother?  About you bringing me back to life?”
“What are you talking about?  Looks like every damn house in this city.  Hell, it looks familiar to me.”
“I don’t know, Dean,” she sounded disappointed, maybe she was as done with him as he was with her.  “Alright.  Well, I have a couple places we can check out in Pacific Heights, I just… Okay.  Lemme make a couple calls there.”
“You’re going to make an incision in that exact place.  It’s going to relieve the pressure and he’ll be able to breathe again.”  Dean shook his head so quickly it looked like he was trying to clear a ringing in his ears.  “Dean.  This man’s life is at stake.  Put the blade against his skin.”
“The way I see it, Dean, you have two choices.  One, you can choose to believe that you happened to meet someone, granted unconventionally, who needs your help.”
“Uh, no,” Sam said, rubbing the back of his head, “but I saw you coming.”  He pointed to the instruments on the table beside Castiel.  He turned at the same time as Dean and realized that every precious stone hanging from a pendulum was pointing right at him.
Castiel just stood staring at Gabriel looking completely crestfallen.  No words could describe the horror and chest clenching pain that ripped through Dean in that moment, once again unable to help him, unable to save him from this cruel twist of fate.
“That’s awesome,” he said with a smile, as cupid pulled his hand away and the image faded from his sight but remained in his memories.
“What?  Oh yeah, exactly.” Dean glanced at her sideways.  “Hold on,” he added, almost as an afterthought as he tore around another corner, throwing Charlie against the door again.
“Hey,” Dean said gently, drawing him back to him.  He was glancing back at the door.  “I’m gonna have to go.”
Golden sunlight chased away all the shadows in the room as Castiel pushed open the door to his apartment. He looked around expectantly.  He had spent a few days in the hospital as he recovered from his coma, the whole time driving his friends and colleagues nuts with his restlessness, suddenly showing up at patients’ bedsides and making suggestions to their attending nurses and doctors.  They had finally sent him home, declaring him miraculously recovered but forcing him to take time off away from the bustling hospital.
“This goes far beyond any medical studies and findings.  All my training has taught me that this… shell is as good as dead.”
Dean turned one last corner and went careening into the hospital drop off zone to the soundtrack of Charlie yelling “Whoa!” repeatedly and at an increasingly higher pitch, while he narrowly avoided a couple of pedestrians heading inside.
Dean hurried to put down the bars on both the bed and the gurney.  He slid his arms under Castiel’s shoulders carefully, hyper aware of all the tubes and wires connected to his body and that could not be dislodged.
“I don’t give a crap about the lore!” Dean said loudly, slamming the book shut again.  “Tell me how to fix this!”
“Hello?” Dean called out tentatively and emptiness and silence gathered around him in greeting as he entered the apartment and closed the door behind him.
“No,” Dean said.  In the pause between his words, Castiel looked at him hopefully.  “I don’t think there was much sleeping involved, Cas.”  Castiel’s hope petered out as he watched Dean pump his eyebrows suggestively and then break into another fit of quiet giggles.
“If you’re right, and fate is a real thing and not just a series of coincidences, then maybe… I was meant to find you.”
Dean looked around at the barely controlled mayhem of the kitchen and dining room: the floor was a minefield of scattered dolls and ponies, forgotten crayons and half-finished drawings.  More drawings and finger paintings covered every inch of available wall space, going far beyond the confines of the traditional refrigerator door, although Dean could see there were plenty on there too.  Sitting in the midst of it all, at a pink, child-sized Fisher Price table with matching chairs were a princess and a fairy having imaginary tea out of a plastic tea pot.
Castiel shook his head and felt comforted by the terrifying expression in Gabriel’s normally playful face as he aimed his anger at the stranger.
Dean kneeled between Cas’s legs and kneaded his inner thighs gently with his fingers as he looked down on his swollen member – curved up towards his abdomen, the tissues engorged.  Dean felt a responding twitch in his own cock as he considered how it would feel to bury himself inside Castiel.  A quick glance at Cas’ face revealed that he was watching him with his intensely blue eyes, and if Dean had needed any more encouragement, that was it.  Dean knew he wasn’t ready for him to push inside though.  Plenty of other things they could do though.
“In case you weren’t sure, what this looks like,” said Castiel as Dean opened his eyes again, “is that you have a naked woman in your bedroom and I’m getting in the way.”
Castiel looked around, feeling the realization come upon him suddenly, but knowing it to be true as though it had always been there.  “I’m a doctor!” he exclaimed straightening up suddenly.
He stepped aside and gestured for her to come in.  Dean accepted the still warm pie and led her to the kitchen so he could cut them a couple wedges.  Lydia took her piece and a proffered fork and leaned her hip against the island counter.
With a roll of her eyes she turned away to leave the break room, returning to the hustling, bustling hubbub of the hospital.  Castiel stood up and turned to the life-giving fountain of youth, staple of the break room, pushing the dark roast option.  He fixated on the sputtering stream of coffee as it poured into the cup.  He breathed, thankful for the extra minute the slow machine was allowing him before he got back to work.  The door to the break room opened again and he looked up to see Jody walk in dressed in a white lab coat over her brown slacks and light tan shirt.  Jody had been his mentor from day one working at St Matthews, she was always in his corner, cheering on his progress through his residency.
Castiel cocked his head to the side and glanced around again before looking at Dean, standing in the room holding a burnt-out match and wearing his usual jeans and black t-shirt, his bare feet planted on the wooden boards.  “It doesn’t look like nothing.”
Another pause, and this time Dean dared to check his watch like he was the one whose time was being wasted.
“This.  Life,” he said gesturing to the children at play, “Life is precious, Dean.  This experience, it’s changed my view on so many things.  Family, happiness, love… I never really got to experience them for myself.  Regret I feel deeply though.  I was so busy making a living, I forgot to live my life.”  He turned his head to look at Dean standing beside him staring at him like he was weirdness incarnate. He would never know what it was to love and be loved by a man, by this man, who felt so deeply and completely.  “Too late now,” he said softly into the breeze, his words carried off to distant places where they could not be heard by anyone anyways.
“You do?”  Dean had a better view of him as he moved around the foot of the bed.  He had dark, almost black, unkempt hair, like he’d gotten caught in a windy updraft and equally dark stubble on his jaw.  Under the trench coat, he looked to be wearing a dark blue suit, his blue tie almost matching his eyes making them that much more dramatic.
“Are you at, like Navi, ‘Hey, listen!’-level voices?  Or has it evolved to straight up Deadpool arguing with his split personalities?”
Castiel was frowning at him.  “Why are you half-naked?” he asked him, his gaze lingering on Dean’s bare torso.  Dean looked down at himself and quickly shook out his plaid and threw it back on.  He heard the clinking of his untied belt buckle and he quickly hooked it back up again, feeling a blush creep up his neck.
Gabriel swung the blade again, slashing just in front of him and yelling his outrage.  Dean scrambled to his feet and ran out of the house, pelted by plastic ponies and Barbie dolls until he was out and jumping down the front stairs in threes.
Together, Castiel and Dean left the restaurant their new destination clear.  Castiel could feel that they were finally moving towards some answers.
Castiel opened his mouth to argue but found that he could not.  His conviction was wavering.  All throughout his neighbours’ assessments of the recluse who lived on the top floor, and with every new information they gathered, all Castiel could think was that they had him all wrong.  He could feel it.  His essence, his soul, or whatever was left of him that was floating around, following the only person who could see and hear him, that part of him knew, with absolute certainty, that he was not what those people imagined him to be.  And yet… he could not deny that though he felt they were wrong, they all seemed to agree with each other, painting a bleak existence.  Maybe he was better off not knowing.
As he moved towards the kitchen, he was vaguely aware that outside the sun was setting and the city lights were flickering on.  He reached out and felt the wall for the kitchen light switch, wincing at the glaring, over-bright light over the island counter.  He opened the fridge and pulled out one of the three remaining cans on the otherwise bare shelf.  He contemplated calling the beer runner again but dismissed it along with the other things he would do later.
“Son of a bitch!”  he’d said, rubbing a hand over his face before turning to look at the mirror again.  His face and torso had been the only things reflected in the glass and after steadying his pulse, he’d called Charlie.  “Can we meet up?  I need to see you.”
Gabriel looked up, a rare look of anger on his face as he leveled a glare on Crowley that should have had the doctor trembling in his expensive suit.  “I said, I’ll think about it, bucko.”
“Tell me you told her what you’re doing!  You can’t just involve someone like this without telling them.”
Charlie looked surprised for a moment, but then quickly narrowed her eyes.  Castiel called out “Scissors,” and Dean repeated it again, feeling smug.  Charlie turned to look behind her again, but quickly came back.  “Paper,” said Castiel.  That was quickly followed by scissors again and then rock.  Each time Dean told Charlie and every time he did, she looked that much more agitated and freaked out.
“Castiel!” he exclaimed when his heart had stopped trying to escape his chest, and he felt his scalp tingle with his smile as he looked upon the man standing in front of him.  “I didn’t think you were coming back.  I thought you were gonna stay at the hospital, with your body.”
Dean’s smile didn’t waver as he kept his eyes on Castiel, “Then how are we having this conversation?”
“I’m Dean Winchester.  I just moved in, uh, upstairs.”  He gestured behind him towards where the top floor apartments were.
He did the only thing he could think of, more instinct than plan, as he turned away from the wavering spirit and looked to the flesh and blood man on the gurney.  He leaned down over him, taking his face in his hand as his lips closed onto his, firm and warm.  Dean was locked in that moment, the terrible sound of the flat line screaming in his ears, his own heart still and empty as his angel slipped away from him. He breathed into his mouth, a single tear breaking free from his eyelashes and landing on Castiel’s cheek as he leaned his forehead against his, feeling his time slipping away.
Several days passed in much the same way they had for a while, but was made easier since getting the apartment: Get up around noon, crack a beer, settle in front of the television, order delivery (thai, pizza, sub, burgers, whatever), watch more television, drink more beer, shower to get the stench of his own uselessness off, more TV, more beer, eventually pass out sometimes on the bed, repeat.  The whole lather, rinse, repeat nature of it was dragging him further into himself and away from the outside world, but he was powerless to stop it.
Dean conveyed the information as best he could to the people around him and then asked for the knife and vodka.  Castiel guided him again to find the spot between two ribs near the bottom of the chest.  Dean was doing well, following instructions, splashing vodka onto the skin without question, until Castiel asked him to take the knife.
After the initial outburst of passion, they had spent the night sitting at the little bistro table Dean had set up amongst the garden he had built for Castiel.  He had leaned back against his chest and Dean had wrapped his arms around him and they had watched the evening fog roll in over the city from the bay.  They had decided to take it slow.  This was all so new to Castiel, who had told him he had never felt that way about anyone and had never known a man intimately.  Dean wanted to respect his pace.  There was nothing he wouldn’t do for him.
Dean was aware that he’d gotten a little carried away and he risked a glance at Castiel, worried about his reaction, but he was just watching him with his eyes wide, not saying a word.  Not another second to spare, Dean met Gabriel’s gaze.  The sadness in his face was heartbreaking and Dean was sure he wouldn’t like what was coming next.
Dean moved up to stand beside his body lying in the hospital bed, sheets covering him up to his waist.  He had wires running out from under the blue hospital gown connected to the nearby heartrate monitor, an IV drip plugged to his left arm and an intubation tube forcing his lungs to keep breathing.  Castiel moved up to the monitor set up on the other side from where Dean stood looking down at his body.  He read the numbers displayed with a frown.
Castiel turned around to see the tall blonde fussing with a clip to tie up her hair as she rushed into the room.  She drew up to the bedside to await instructions as Castiel turned back to the patient.
After Dean ripped open the man’s shirt, sending buttons flying with his stiff movements, Castiel guided him through a basic examination of his chest, asking him questions.
Lisa walked up to him with papers and he squeezed the phone between his shoulder and cheek while he signed off on a request for x-rays.
“What?  Like mine?  Thanks.”  Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head breaking out of the crowd to cross the street.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Dean’s jaw was twitching as he ground his teeth together, trying to maintain his self-control but feeling it slip with every grating syllable the black-haired man uttered.
He confusedly put the bottle back in the refrigerator and instead pulled out the egg carton and red bell pepper that had mysteriously appeared in his food order.  He searched through the cupboards for a cutting board, knife, frying pan, and a spatula and before long he was full on Chef Emeril shaking spices onto his omelet and letting out an excited “Bam” as he transferred the finished product flawlessly onto a plate.  He poured himself a glass of water and brought his feast over to the dining table, humming
Cas turned to kiss him deeper. Cradling Dean’s jaw with his berry juice and whip cream covered hands, “Merry Christmas Dean.”
“Last minute escape,” he said, “I burned the wife’s bones, but it wasn’t her. Then, her husband came after me at the cemetery.” Cas frowned, ran his tongue over his lips and continued, “He got me by surprise, and pushed me into the burning grave. I got out,
Sam sighed, throwing his hands up in defeat, “You’re right. We can’t leave him alone. Fine. Dean, be careful.”
It’d taken all of his self-control to not walk up to her, and tell her, yes, he did have people who took care of him. He had an older brother who had looked out for him all his life more than he did for himself, a best friend who would give it all to protect them and a kid who chose them as his family despite everything.
Their drive home was peaceful. The newfound content they found with each other, even in the silence, was comforting. It felt like a breath of fresh air.
He sighed and reached up to rub his eyes with the heel of his palms. They were right, Cas could do this on his own, but he didn’t have to. The guy was still injury prone in a world where all things supernatural knew our name. One wrong move and - no, he thought, he needed to hold it together. There was no use being negative, “I sure as hell hope he does.” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and gave them a defeated look. “Y’all should have said something is all I’m saying. I was fretting to myself over why he didn’t show up for breakfast,” he said.
candles littered about. Between those and the sparks, he was able to access the physical damage Cas had endured.
“He freaked out for a while but he will be fine, Sam is with him at the bunker. You scared us, man.”
Dean grinned at him. Cas was radiant, like a star in the night sky, brightening his life. He stared down at Cas' tilted head and thought that it was downright adorable. “I’m sure we can fix that with adequate practice. What do you say?”
A hand settled on his shoulder and then was Cas half-bowing in front for him, offering his hand in a dance.
Cas disappeared down the hall for a minute, returning with a bundle of wool and an extra pair of fuzzy socks.
Legs moving on their own accord, he crashed into Cas and buried himself in his arms, repeating: “Yes, yes, yes. Of course, I’ll marry you. I love you, Cas,” like a pray. They were both crying when Cas placed the ring on his finger, near shaking with bliss and excitement.
It sat proudly next to Jack’s purple roof cottage and Sammy’s blue apartment. They looked nothing alike, but each was a home. Their homes.
