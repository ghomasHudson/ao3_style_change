Dean hauled up and slammed him against the wall. “Listen to me. I’m not a demon.” He reasoned with the older hunter, noticing Rebekah approaching behind him. “Think, Rufus. All those omens.”
He thought in frustration as he watched his grandparents head the kitchen with the shopping bags and empty his second beer today.
Sam and Rebekah didn’t normally take any during crises like this either, but he knew they needed painkillers to get through this alive. He wished both wouldn’t be so impulsive and nearly get themselves killed more times than he could count.
“What about me? I don’t know.” The older Winchester said. “Honestly, I’m good. I can’t believe I'm saying that, but I am, I’m really good.”
Dean knew that Sam and the three time-travelers were going to meet up with him at his hotel room in Kansas City. He didn’t want to team back up with Sam, though. He knew that all of those angels, demons, and everything in between would use their bond against them, and he didn’t fully trust Sam, despite exhausting himself recently to prove that he could trusted. The older Winchester remembered back in Colorado when Samuel defended his younger brother’s actions and declared him blameless for the whole thing. The boy didn’t understand at all what it was like, even though Sam was going through withdraws from demon blood at the time, to choose
A trio of time-travelers contemplate their plan to go into the past and help their ancestors, Sam and Dean Winchester.
He was taught that people—excluding him and Emma, unless they followed the code—chose to be good and do the right thing, and no one was destined for any sort of fate. Secretly, he wished he could have that kind of free will he and his twin had been denied, but if the hero Sam were right, then how could he learn to rely on his own judgment?
The communication between Klaus and Samuel had become scarce when the then-eighteen-year-old decided to go to college and studied pre-law at Wichita State to better his namesakes’ image. They didn’t have a fight at all, it was actually Klaus who encouraged Samuel to go out and live the life he wanted. D took a job offer to work for one of his father’s friends at an auto shop in Petoskey, Michigan, and hunted locally there with his new manager, whom he allow lived with by the time he turned eighteen. Previously he’d lived and worked with Kyle at his auto shop in Kansas City in remaining high school years.
Anyhow, I decided to deviate a bit and throw in Sam’s POV on the time-traveler who defended his actions since I’ve mostly focused on Dean and Castiel’s perspectives. I should have focused more on his perspective more in the last couple of chapters instead of zeroing in on Dean and Cas’ profound bond, so my apologies there.
The kid shook his head again. “I’ll be fine. My siblings should bring us help soon.” He whispered, trying to sound hopeful in his weak voice, but it seemed to fail in his despondent tone. “How about yourself?”
“That’s just peachy.” He said sarcastically, his anger rising in his tone, turning toward the futuristic hunters. “We’ll find Sam and the kid, then I’ll make sure he doesn’t pull shit like this again! I bet they’re talking about demon blood, aren’t they?”
“Yeah,” the older of the two brothers answered. “Oma, would you and Opa let Emma and Danny know what’s going on?”
, a news channel when she came in, and broke the salt line upon wincing before passing it, and fixed it with the canister on the sidewall table beside the door. “Did you see anything?” He said, setting the beer back on the sidewall table as she slipped her shoes off on the mat, and sat down across from him on the sofa. “When I was about to get us both an
The time-traveler thought irritably, keeping hand in his pocket, gripped around the revolver’s handle.
5 “You’re safe here, I promise. Do you still feel comfortable with taking your namesake’s place tonight?”
He thought in horror, glancing down at the ‘demon,’ then looking over at Rebekah who didn’t seem to notice.
Dean didn’t argue, nor did he disagree. There were some things about his older brother that he couldn’t change, and this was one of those things. “Okay, but you can’t constantly supervise Rebekah on cases either.” He said. “We’ll stand out too much and you know there’s more discreet ways to keep her safe.”
refused. They were stuck with two younger hunters, who stubbornly went on despite their minor injuries, and the four of them reached the gas station.
There are hints of abuse, brief arguments of gun control, and one mention of school shootings in the characters’ dialogue in the second cut scene in this chapter.
Shaking off his thoughts, Sam decided that he would show them that he was bigger, better, and stronger than he appeared to be. He wasn’t going to stand by and let anyone else treat him like a frightened puppy any longer.
Rebekah followed suit, expecting her husband to grab everyone’s attention with a short speech. It would be unlike to him
He leaned down to Donnie’s and chanted in Enochian. “I’m here, Raphael. Come and get me, you little bastard.” The angel demanded and walked out of the oil circle. “Just out of curiosity, what is the average customer wait time to speak to an archangel?” Dean asked him.
He offered her the last of his whiskey to wash it down and she was smart to not turn it down as she normally would. They knew that the others’, including Ellen and her daughter, didn’t trust them. Reasonably so, as they were here before the attack and had been prepared for it, understandably not blaming the other people for staying away from them warily.
“There used to be twenty of us.” She elaborated, wishing she’d listened to the warning. The boys checked the room and realized that, excluding the six hunters, only ten remained.
Had she been manipulated by someone else for this, or was Ruby the genius she proved herself out to be? Sam was ashamed of himself, he let Lucifer out in the world, but wasn’t Heaven in on this, too?
“Hey, are you okay, Samuel?” The hero Sam asked as the young man approached the younger Winchester at the table located away from anybody, where he could safely explain himself and his abnormal ways. Not even his own namesake could entirely understand him, who
difficult, especially with the awkward tension about him and his younger brother’s names. He didn’t want to lie to either of them anymore than he had to, as his wife and brother felt the same in that regard, especially to the hero he was named after.
The time-travelers had become on the edge upon hearing that voice, and the kid named after Dean had a murderous look on his face. Austin checked the peephole and opened the door.
Everyone else, except for Ellen, weren’t on board at all with the time-travelers claims or believed them about War putting everyone against each other. It was expected that they would be reviled for calling out War, and not believed.
I struggled with coming up with what to call the time-travelers’ Sam and Dean in my spare time lately without deviating too far from their birth names, so I decided to call the time-traveler Sam by the full form of Samuel and the time-traveler Dean by the letter D. I can thank my love of Death Note for coming up with that.
The gentle blue paint remained on the walls, as if his mother were never taken in the first place. That colorful rug had been gone a long time, he imagined, and that beige rug in its place over the soft brown carpet complimented the innocent paint on the wall. It was if the walls were taunting him as it seemed to remind him that the peaceful times were gone, and never coming back. Sure, Danny had peaceful moments after his mother was taken, but her absence was the elephant in the room nobody wanted to address.
Sam remembered that as he fought against her less forcefully than he wanted to, as they were about to approach him, despite back-up coming to capture them, too. He wished they would just go and get help already, and he knew that he would be fine.
D shook his head in agreement. “Yeah, but not just you, Sammy. All three of us need to be more careful.” He said with concern and sapience in his voice, glancing over at the other two time-travelers. “None of us can afford to get any excessive attention right now.”
1 “I’m sorry, Dad. You raised me in the hero Sam’s image, and I failed you. You tried to change me for the better, but I don't know if I can ever be a good person.”
“No, I only one killed of them. My namesake the killed the other one.” He answered, glancing over at Sam, as if to ask him to justify his actions. “I killed Reggie to provoke Tim into being distracted enough to drop the beaker of…blood, and my namesake killed Tim when he had me against the wall.”
“People, cease fire!” Rufus called out, behind the other man. “Stop shooting, stop!” The older hunter grabbed the gun from the other man and slammed him in the head with it. “I’m getting too old for this.” He commented, frustrated. The other young man aimed out of the window at the pastor and the young woman, who ran for shelter behind a trailer. The pastor came out and the other young man fired, and the bullet went right through the pastor, who fell.
a bad thing? The hero Sam didn’t believe his own morals shouldn’t be taught? Samuel thought it was insane that the most moral code he knew of and was personally taught to follow, or else he would become evil, was something his namesake didn’t encourage to pass on. That’s what it sounded like to the young man anyways. Maybe he was just being modest.
The title change is inspired by “King of Misery,” by Saul, which gives me a lot of Sam vibes. I don’t ship nearly destiel as heavily as I used to, for future reference, and I’m more of a sastiel shipper these days, but I still like s4-s5 destiel.
Sam and Dean, had come along with him to the past, but there was no sight of them. Castiel tried to find them in the far distant future of 2056 to find out that Lucifer had been released once more, though not intentionally, by Sam’s namesake. The young German man, American wife, and one of his younger brothers were fleeing the country to avoid getting murdered by hunters while coming up with a plan. The other two siblings, Emma, and Danny were going to catch a later flight, as this Sam was angry about.
Still, though, knowing somebody would die and letting happen wasn’t going to fly with the younger Winchester, nor D and Rebekah. They had to come up with something, and even the kid reluctantly agreed to keep an open mind about this.
He began to head upstairs, and Dean reached out to stop him. “No, no, no. It’s gonna go a lot faster if you stay and help, okay?” He insisted, then shooting the tall German kid an annoyed look. “Take the kid with you, too.”
When they left Germany years ago, they left behind any normalcy that remained after Hanna was taken by Azazel there, and had to leave it for dead. Revisiting the home that they practically grew up in was a remainder of their childhood innocence that died there when stepmother was taken from them.
“I’ll have to check his stitches and see. Sammy should be fine outside of that.” The older kid answered, glancing at his brother tensing whilst getting up. “Are you
The youngest Winchester tried not to think about the bits and pieces of the childhood he could remember
Emma felt like a foreigner when she purchased a metro bus ticket, and boarded one to get off at a local
I had no real direction in the beginning for this story, hence the earlier chapters are a mess and I should have realized that the alternating third person POVs within the chapters would get confusing for readers. Admittedly, I had got confused by them at times and for consistency's sake, each chapter will have a single POV, usually either Sam or Dean.
“I did it. I started the apocalypse.” His namesake admitted with pain in his voice, and it felt strange for the younger-looking hunter to be able to emphasize with somebody else on this strong of a level. Was he more better off than his namesake in this case? The hero Sam didn’t have a twin, or any other sibling who also had demon blood.
Dean was frustrated with what how life on Earth was determined by angels who thought the Apocalypse was a way to get things back to how
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
Thank you for reading, subscribing, and bookmarking this story as usual. Just like in the previous chapter, there’s mention of addiction, suicidal ideation, self-harm, the Gadreel plotline, Sam’s Cage trauma, Lucifer mentions, suggestion of involuntary commitment, and emotional abuse, also mentions of child neglect and physical abuse. This story will get a lot heavier in these topics henceforth, any additional trigger warnings will be put in the tags and before each chapter.
Tonight, the younger Winchester was at the bar next to the bartender while Lindsay threw darts. Thankfully, Samuel was minding his own business reading one of his law books on his break, and not in too bad of a mood tonight.
“No, we’re not. Your opa and I can imagine how badly he’s overreacted with you kids.” Angelika answered promptly with sympathy in her voice. “We’re aware of the physical and emotional abuse allegations a few American social workers suggested.”
“No, he doesn’t believe he did. He believes himself capable of protecting your brother, and to be fair, he protected me and Danny throughout out childhood.” The older boy defended, though sympathetic in his tone. “He protected Rebekah at Stanford, so I believe that he’s more than capable. I tried to tell him that we should inform you first, though, but I’m sure you know by now that he’s stubborn.”
He was ninety-nine percent positive that Samuel was stalking them and listening to every word of his and Lindsay’s conversation right now. Sam sat at a table opening, trying to block out that image of the kid spying on them, and Lindsay broke the awkward silence.
Sorry it took so long to update, I’ve had on and off again writers block for months. I’ve been working on fixing any grammatical errors, personalizing this fic with quotes during the beginning and at the end of a chapter, etc.
“No, but I do believe he’s made mistakes.” Angelika admitted feeling a heavy sweep of dread come over her, based on Emma’s petrified reaction. “I know he’s done things he wishes he would never have done, and there’s things he wants to make up for, right?”
He thought worriedly about his brother and wife and kicked the distracted hunter in the stomach and pushed him to the floor right when Sam came out and put the older hunter in a chokehold.
He nodded. “Yeah, of course. They don’t believe that I trust them, but I do trust them.” He answered indignantly, then sighed in frustration in his quiet tone. “I trust you and my brother’s namesake just as much, and…You’re my namesake, so if you have advice, I’ll do my best to adhere to it.”
Peace wouldn’t remain when seven years later, when the twins were seven, Dean’s namesake was five, and Danny was three. Specifically, on the twins’ birthday, Azazel attempted to take Samuel and Emma once more, who had no idea of the supernatural, what he did to them, or how their mother actually died. Though Dean’s namesake was only five at the time, nor was he in the room, he knew what transpired based on his older brother’s first-hand account. Emma ran out of the room before Azazel could catch her, and the yellow-eyed demon grabbed Samuel’s shoulder to keep him from running, too.
Sam couldn’t believe what he’d just done, he let Ruby manipulate him into freeing Lucifer, and he hated himself for trusting her. What about all the times he drank from her possessed skin, did that make him a monster, like Dean said?
Sam walked to the Impala and the kid followed behind him with a duffel-bag in his hand, as if that weren’t creepy at all. He grabbed his backpack out of the backseat and looked over at the kid. “Why are you following me, dude?” He questioned and shutting one of the backseat doors of the Impala. “I’d rather be alone. Is there some other danger you need to tell me about?”
who undoubtedly had a gift for pissing people off. Not many people had the patience to tolerate Sam in the long-term in the first place, which is why these Winchester’s couldn’t have nice things like hunter contacts and allies outside of the family.
Thank you for reading, subscribing, and bookmarking this story. This second part, like the first part, is inspired by “Helena” and “Ghost of You,” by MCR, and this part is particularly motivated by season 7 of Criminal Minds. The song from the beginning of CM 5x13, “Enemy” by Flyleaf, and “The Moment I Said It” by Imogen Heap from CM 3x5, partially inspired this chapter amongst different things, including Spn 1x16. It also contains brief mentions of Spn season 12.
know about clothes, given that he valued his outward appearance, hence seeming to prefer the nicer things he could afford. He had to tell them about his conversation with Lucifer via dream, and as he was about to tell them, the waitress from earlier came over. She put four paper menus on the table and pulled out her notepad and pen from her hoodie pocket. “What can I get ya’ll?”
“What happened?” Sam asked, wondering if one of the Wolff siblings were psychic to possibly know beforehand what happened in the town if they were lying about Cas telling them everything. He doubted they were.
Taking present Cas to a brothel couldn’t have ended up better than it did. After leaving toward the opposite end of the corridor, Dean laughed as he closed the door behind himself and his,
She appeared shaken, reasonably the thought of War making his appearance, and he put his hand on her shoulder. “
Dean walked through an empty cabin, looking through John’s journal. He set it on the table and turned toward present Cas, who was holding a ceramic jar. “Where’ve you been?” He asked.
War held up his right hand and twisted his ring, then pointed to Dean, Ellen, the older kid, and Rebekah. “Look at their eyes! They’re demons!” He said in faux panic.
The streets of River Pass, Colorado, were desolate and had an eerie feeling to it. Sam and Dean Winchester walked through the empty town with their guns close. Not a person was in sight and it was disconcerting. There was a sporting goods store on the near side of the street and the far end seemed to be residential. Unexpectedly, but not surprisingly, they found a blue Sedan with two doors was overturned and discovered to be empty. A sprinkler in front of one of the houses was running and tan car ahead was a tan car turned right side up with the driver’s door open, engine running, and the radio was playing ‘Spirit in the Sky,’ by Norman Greenbaum.
They watched Sam work his magic in silence as Rebekah had begun to calm down, and it seemed to surprise both Ellen and his namesake. It caught them off guard, and there
he thought somberly, wishing he could just speak it out loud and just be put down like the monster he believed himself to be as he and Dean walked through the barren streets of Rivers Pass, Colorado with their guns close to them,
He put the knife away in fear that he might not have killed a demon at all and decided to his less lethal gun. He needed to let Sam and Rebekah know that, since his brother was preoccupied.
Any fellow Hannibal fans might recognize the tidbits of that influence in this fic, but the source material of the fic won’t change. All I want to do is improve my fic and once more special thanks to @misha-moose-dean-burger-lover for beta reading, supplying suggestions on Tumblr. I still haven’t heard from @mystic-voyanger (sorry if I misspelled the url!) on Tumblr, who also gave suggestions and quite helpful input, but I want to thank them, too.
There had been more things that would transpire around the same time as the demon crisis in Oklahoma. Present Cas would ask him to help him find God and the only other being who could help them was Raphael, who had killed him before being restored to life. Even if he still had room for doubt, present Cas confirmed that fact and they would need to look. How would they do that when Samuel was hellbent on going forward with his plan? It’s not that Dean didn’t trust him; he knew the kid’s goal was to protect Sam, but the kid was a recovering blood junkie!
He was going over and talk some reason into Dean when the angel grabbed the younger Winchester’s shoulder, to stop him. “Let go of me,” he snapped at Cas, who gave Sam a look of concern, shoving the angels hand off him.
. I promise.” Rebekah defended with intense worry in her tone. “I know Sam—the one I came here with—is strong, but I’m worried about what they’re doing to him.”
Rebekah was in deep thought about altering the past when the grandmother spoke up toward her. “Rebekah, do you need to lay down?” She asked.
I should eventually be able to write the German conversation parts on my own instead of relying on Google translate.
Shocked and taken aback by such an admission, and though he wanted to know more about the apparently bleak future, Sam knew better than to push the kid for more information. He didn’t ask Samuel anymore questions that evening, who wouldn’t offer up a nearly as much detailed answer on his other questions during the first week.
“My younger brother with you right now. From what he told me, our dad died on a hunt a couple of years ago, and Dean sold his to bring him back. I had no idea that my dad died in the first place, and by the time I found out, my brother was given two years…When I found out that he’d already been…He was already back. Nobody had to sell their souls because the Archangel Michael brought him back a days later, and my family meant well…But they left me not knowing a fucking thing! Not even my twin, Emma, or youngest brother, Danny knew.”
The older Winchester turned around and present Cas was inches from him. Honestly, the closer the angel was to him, the more tempting it was to do things he didn’t want to think about. He had forgotten all about this as he’d been worried about Sam this whole time.
I’ve been waiting for a while to get this point in the story since I started writing chapter nine and it’s finally starting to kick up the pace. Plus, I’ve been wanting to find the right time to expand on Rebekah’s background.
He noticed the kid slowly lift his head up and the younger hunter noticed him. “Hey, man, how long have you been here?” He whispered. “What did they do to you?”
The youngest Winchester scoffed. “Of course, they did.” He said, moaning. “Why did we have to miss the earlier flight?”
This was happening all over again the future, he recalled in his mind, only except it being him and Sam, it was D and Samuel instead. Whatever happened for the angels to have to re-set and start over again with a couple of kids born in the future twenty-three years from now.
Sam Winchester wonders why Dean won’t bring up the tragic voicemail and just kill him already and he wonders why Dean even sticks around him, hoping he’s plotting to kill Sam for trusting Ruby and inadvertently releasing Lucifer from the Cage.
“So, odds are you’re a dead man tomorrow.” He concluded, shoving that thought of his mind, then present Cas confirmed his fear.
“Surely you remember Zachariah giving you stomach cancer? Do you know what he could do to them?” The archangel asked, and the older Winchester turned around and removed the beer from his mouth.
“What the hell did War mean about asking about the kid’s blood, Sam?” Dean asked his brother and seeing his brother sigh. “What’s wrong with the kid? It can’t mean—”
Emma and Danny arrive in Germany and improvise a plan on how to deal with Lucifer. With Sam, Dean, Rebekah in the past, Emma and Danny are at a standstill and try to figure out why the present hasn’t changed at all. Old wounds from their childhood are reopened when investigating for leads on Lucifer doesn’t go as planned.
“Yeah, Samuel told me all of it, the call from Bobby about a demon crisis, and the attack…Next week.”
“Yeah? I bet you didn’t imagine one thing.” The older Winchester taunted, and Raphael approached him now.
“Earlier tonight, two men who haven’t been identified at this time were found dead in Garber, Oklahoma, buried in a ditch. The local police believe these deaths are homicides, both were shot and have defensive wounds.” The newscaster said, and the screen shown sketches of what the men would have likely looked like while living. “If anybody knows who these men are or may have seen anybody suspicious, please contact your local law enforcement or the FBI tip line.”
“I don’t care what they said! I’m not leaving without them, Dean.” Sam said. “We can’t fix the past with just the three of us. I’m concerned with Rebekah coming along.”
“Honestly, people don’t need a reason to kill each other.” War replied. “I mean, you seen the Irish? They’re all Irish.”
Sam wished that the time-traveler didn’t jump the gun and go straight for intimidating them before anything happened at all, but it’s not like he could blame the younger-looking hunter for being angry at his namesakes’ would-be attackers.
Everything was going as planned, although Samuel thought it was a waste of time to pray to future Castiel about saving Steve’s life. Although they probably knew it was a long shot and it wouldn’t work, but either way, he had been planning the torture that he’d exact on Tim and Reggie a few days prior to this. The hero Sam was waiting, hidden in the kitchen, and waiting for his cue. Dean and Rebekah were waiting outside for when Reggie would try to grab Lindsay, he was waiting by the entrance and waited at the table trying to figure out how to send a text to two people at once on his new outdated flip phone.
Rebekah thought about it for a moment. “Don’t I need a back-story first? How would we work in your dad having the time to have another kid, or are we using one of the usual covers?” She asked carefully. “Klaus doesn’t seem like the type of person to do one-night-stands.”
This is the longest chapter that I’ve written for this story yet and the tags of it will be updated.
Regardless, the direction I intend to keep this fic on remains the same, with the influences of the Spn (aka the Sam Stan Side of) Tumblr, Criminal Minds, and Dexter unchanging. Other new outside influences include Hannibal, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Heathers (movie and musical), and The Path.
of pain and guilt, and in his successful attempt to relate with the younger Winchester once more, they were more alike than Sam thought. It made him think back to when the younger-looking kid admitted to how unclean his father made him and his twin feel, like they couldn’t be trusted to use their own judgments, it made him sick at how poorly this kid and his twin were treated because of demon blood they had no choice in being fed.
“Oh, like I care about your feelings, you little infernal thing.” War taunted, chuckling. “You can’t stop thinking the blood dripping off your knife earlier, can you?”
Emma had begun drinking demon blood and became estranged from Klaus and went off the radar for a few years when she started using her powers. A couple of years later when Samuel and Rebekah were in their second year of law school, she moved out to California, and stayed in a motel room next door to Danny’s. Sadly, she still drank demon blood and used her powers regularly, and still estranged from their father.

Once more, the chapter will be broken into different parts if things go as planned for in my ADHD-ridden mind. This chapter was difficult to brainstorm for with coursework and studying amongst a few other things going on now.
Sam was just planning on going out to find Jo with Ellen, and he figured the three of them would want to come back out. He knew that kid wasn’t lying, and he needed to ask them what bad thing would happen next.
Dean and present Cas stood in front of Raphael in the ring of ignited holy oil aflame, and he could tell that his friend was getting angry and worried. “You’re lying.” Present Cas accused him.
“Tell me something. You keep saying we're gonna trap this guy.” Dean asked, trying to figure out exactly what his friend was expecting. “Isn’t that kinda like trapping a hurricane with a butterfly net?”
He whispered, trying to calm his brother as things began to return to order amongst the other survivors. “
“Would not have believed my eyes if I hadn’t seen it myself.” Framingham elaborated with disbelief in his voice. “We’re talking a riot. Full scale.”
“Alexander.” He answered, then looking toward Sam. “I’ll more than likely just go with D to make it easier to remember. You need to be called
Dean turned around and leveled his gun as Sam turned, and lowered his gun upon noticing a familiar face.
He appeared to be around twenty-three or twenty-four, or perhaps closer to twenty-two, depending on who one asked.
If she had never met Sam Winchester’s namesake and inadvertently became involved in the world of death, demons, and tragedy, she’d still be normal. Not that she blamed him or his family, she felt dirty taking stolen narcotics for pain and washing it down with whiskey, knowing what doctors say about
—friend Bobby informed you three about.” He stated matter-of-factly, rather darkly. “I’m a hunter, too, so you’d do well to not test my patience.”
“Thanks…Here’s to stolen time,” He said, extending his bottle and she followed, clinking the glass bottles, and both took a drink of their beers. “Time we’ll never get again,” Emma remarked, sighing.
At the dining room table, there was tension and frustration in the air. There were three small duffel-bags by each person’s feet and all three of them wore house slippers. “Couldn’t we have booked a later flight?” The first of them said in English, distressed and with a German accent. He was by far the tallest out of the three at the table with ebony black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin, dressed in a black Henley shirt and black jeans. “We would’ve been fine if we waited fifteen minutes!”
Sam and Dean. They’re hunters, too. Here to help.” Ellen stated the awkward introduction, glancing at the Wolff siblings in the back, skeptical about their motives.
“Yeah, Samuel, but you’re not me. You have to decide what you want to do with your life, and how you do things. It’s not up to me how you want to live your life.” The hero Sam explained with the righteousness about freewill the boy had been taught since childhood. “It’s good you’re open to improving, you know.”
, man? We have food and everything else we need.” He asked skeptically, though concerned for the kid. “What the hell are you trying to hide, Samuel?”
on the TV, which shifted from one video of a hailstorm to another to another, then to a video of trees on fire, then to the reporter live with fire and fireman in the background. While the reporter was on screen, there was a box that says ‘Live Report’ next to a scrollbar repeating, ‘Fire consumes town, residents forced to evacuate...’
let Lucifer out, and because of that, it was up to him to fix it one way or another. There was always a way to do it.
Explaining of this had been a pain for Dean and presumably for the two time-travelers as well, given their tired facial expressions. “So now you’re saying that there are no demons and War is a guy.” Austin commented.
Emma didn’t believe torture was moral, even on a demon who deserved it, and Sam took pleasure in inflicting torture on a non-human monster who deserved it. She didn’t like how he screwed with people’s heads and drew out their fears, all for creating a daunting reputation that he believed kept their family safe, whilst she believed that it did the exact opposite of what he wanted to do.
disturbing, and then realized that he and Dean would (and have) done the same for each other if it came down to it, but killing another hunter was something they avoided. Maybe Samuel wasn’t as different from him as he seemed and maybe his arrogant behavior was hiding something much less intimidating and disagreeable. Something painful.
If he could make a difference right in this moment, it’d be that he could help Samuel through the internal torment and shame the younger-looking kid was feeling, and it must’ve taken a lot for him to confide in Sam. The boy, from what he knew of, never struck him as the type of to talk about his feelings, and trusted Sam with them.
10 “What problem would you be helping me with, if I even had one? You’re aware of how insufferable you are sometimes, right?”
His brother’s voice brought him back to reality, and unsurprisingly, his namesake looked back at hearing the nickname. “Huh?” Sam said quietly, shaken out of his mind, as he looked at Dean. “What did you say?”

maybe relapsing, too? Either way, they had work to do. At the bar that night, a patron was playing pool whilst Sam took a tray of empty glasses and trash, and the guests of honor would arrive soon. Samuel was on edge, keeping a watch while he served drinks at the bar.
“Like I said—” Sam tried to get to them to stop, but Reggie interrupted. “Yeah. You’re sorry.” He said. “Heard it the first time.”
“They think we’re demons, we think they’re demons.” The older Winchester continued, then turning to the time-travelers. “What if there are no demons at all and we’re all just killing each other? Is that right?”
He ran his finger along the blood of the deceased demon, collecting a little bit on it on his finger, contemplating it. The kid looked over at him, unexpectedly concerned.
“It was hard not to notice; how different things are between you guys these days.” Ellen said and he was silent. “Lot of bad road there, huh? What happened? Some girl come between you or something?”
Of course, it wasn’t Sam’s fault that his bipolar disorder had worsened in the past few years and refused to take his prescribed Lithium for since leaving college. His older brother would take it for a few years, then suddenly quit taking it for around the same time span, and the circle would repeat since he began attending American high schools.
Now, Dean seemed to be holding a resentment toward him and he did say what John said when he left with Ruby supposedly to stop the Apocalypse, so what was the point of even sticking around with his older brother? It was clear Dean didn’t trust him by his body language and he kept that voicemail of Dean calling him a “bloodsucking freak” he would kill, so why hadn’t he done it by now?
8 “No, I’m not. You’re afraid, Sam, and it’s alright to be! You’re human, just like your namesake. Why do you think you should always be strong?”
“When the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies.” Present Cas told him, bringing Dean back into reality. “Okay, so we trap him in a steel cage of holy fire, but one question.” He said. “How the hell do we get him here?”
“If you ever get arrested and charged with any crimes in L.A., I’ll be your public defender or if it’s somewhere else, I’ll refer somebody I or Rebekah trust to represent you.” Sam said, smiling faintly back. "When Lucifer’s stopped, screw what your namesake would do and have the normal life you’ve always wanted, too, Dean. You won’t have to worry about getting arrested or going back to prison if you’re not a hunter.”
“Sam, I need you to listen to me. Your brother needs time alone.” Future Cas said urgency with more than concern on his face, especially in his remorseful blue eyes. “We can still keep him safe; I just need you to give me more time.”
If he lied and say any other angel’s name, or said they didn’t identify themselves, the three of them would be caught in a lie that could increase suspicion. He thought for a second, then turned to his older brother who seemed to be starting to return to his meticulous and arrogant self.
War faked panic and fear, effectively able to fool Rufus and Jo. “Both of them said they’re coming!” He said in faux frantic tone. “Both of them said they’re coming to get us!”
I have had a fascination with Germany, German history, and the culture of Germany since I was fourteen, and that's why I wanted German characters and intend to write them as respectfully as possible. I'm even learning German on the Duolingo app, so if any translations from Google on the original fic were wrong, I should be better at spotting any mistakes that the Google translator might have.
“But why?” Sam asked as neither Cas, nor the time-travelers told them why the attack was happening, glancing a look over at Samuel, who must’ve known
Their namesakes will soon be referred to by their aliases when in the presence of Sam and Dean and referred to by their real names in separate sections when alone, which the POV will alternate a bit. It’ll be indicated by the line break, to prevent any confusion. Instead of narrating all events of the episode with unaltered dialogue, except slightly altered with mentions of my characters, so the POVs will cover both sides.
Sam woke up in the passenger’s seat of the car and glanced over at Rebekah driving, who seemed rather drowsy. He looked toward the voice of Samuel in the back, clearly irritable and tired.
A couple of hours later, the four of them arrived at the Century Hotel in Kansas City. Sam booked one room for himself, and offered D the other bed in his room, in case Samuel and Rebekah wanted privacy, who accepted the offer, and wasn’t in the mood to sleep in a room that smelled like a cannabis den.
When Chasity had taken him in the brothel’s back corridor, it was natural that his friend had limited exposure to humanity and interacting with people outside the Winchester brothers and the three time-travelers would inadvertently get him in trouble.
“Here’s a hint. I was in Germany. Then in Germany. Then in the Middle East. I was in Darfur when—” It started to explain, but the young man cut it off with a scoff.
He thought, hiding a smirk. “The bar’s closed, asshole.” He said, flipping the phone back to its primitive state and putting it in his jeans pocket, looking directly at a pissed off Tim.
It felt odd for Castiel to be speaking with his friends’, one of whom he had a profound bond with, who had kids named after them being total opposites. The one named after his love, no, he meant
“Not you, too, Rebekah! Jesus fucking Christ, my siblings are rubbing off on you more than I thought.” He complained irritably as he snorted. “Anyways, what last name are we gonna use? I prefer our real one, so whatever we come up with must start with ‘w.’ It’ll be easier to remember that way.”
In my mind, Sam is like Derek Morgan to Samuel like Spencer Reid, despite being the same age. Without giving any spoilers away, Morgan is like an older brother to Reid, and more experienced in different areas that he helps Reid with, like picking up girls.
Dean wasn’t a fan of Samuel’s plan to use himself as bait for the two hunters seeking to harm Sam. Honestly, he never that plan coming from the kid, or that even past Cas cleared him as
For anybody who follows my Tumblr, I’ve stated that I like s4-5 destiel, but I don’t care for it beyond that. In my last author’s note, I stated that I like sastiel more. I know I’ll probably lose readers over this, but from this chapter henceforth it’ll gradually shift into a sastiel fic. My goal for this fic isn’t intended to overly focus on the ship(s) in any case.
She became family to him, and he would rather give his life for her and his siblings rather than allow them to die. Unfortunately, he couldn’t reason with her, and he had made sure she didn’t get herself killed. Now was the time to fight, and he considered it necessary that Dean made the initial mistake of revealing too much information. He realized they were sharing too little with people in the past, especially with their namesakes and the Harvelle’s.
Dan and Angelika could remember a time when Klaus only wanted to give his four kids a normal life in Germany, and never bring them into the hunting life. They thought Klaus had moved on after Fiona died, but what happened to Hanna drove him down a similar road that his uncle went down.
Anyways, since there are different locations, and I switched up the POVs, it’ll somehow make sense. If not, please let me know and I will fix that. They will be called that in the authors notes here on out, and in their own POVs to make this as least confusing as possible. I hope that any of the previous chapters haven’t been confusing. The full, director’s edit music video for 30 Seconds to Mars’ song, “Hurricane” served a major motivation and inspiration for this, and Persona 5 Royal, as well.
Sam couldn’t hear her, being a rather bored spectator, but he figured she was trying to calm the woman and help the pastor out. He knew that normal people, including probably most hunters, should be appalled, and bothered by this display of pointless violence, but he wasn’t.
“I’d honor your request if your life weren’t in danger from the minute you go on your own. Hunters will come to attack you and I’m staying with you to make sure you’re safe until you and my brother’s namesake start hunting together again shortly.” The younger hunter explained rather protectively in his adamance. “My brother and Rebekah are staying with yours to make sure things go smoothly on their end. Believe me, I’d respect your privacy if your life weren’t in danger.”
“No, I’m fine. Thank you, though.” The younger woman answered politely. It seemed that the two brothers calmed down enough to have a civil conversation and their grandmother sent the three Winchesters concerned looks. “Don’t overthink the aliases, you need to pay attention to what’s important.” Sam looked over at his grandmother. “Thanks, Oma.” He said quietly, but politely.
Sam thought in remorse after seeing the suspicious look of his and Dean’s namesakes, too ashamed to think it in the same native language as his namesake, nearing the church.
and we’re still calling Rebekah by her name; we need a last name. I’m not lying to our namesakes’ any more than I have to.”
It bothered him immensely that the hunter would die as well, and the boy explained calmly in his extremely limited set of emotions that no matter what they do, some people will die. Also, that it wasn’t worth risking the lives of family for somebody who they might not save that served them no purpose, although the kid didn’t phrase it that cruelly.
“How do we explain why Rebekah doesn’t seem like she's had enough training?” Dean asked, then looking over at her. “No offense. You’ve gotten better over the past year.”
The first chapter of "Reclaiming the World" is already up on this account. My ADHD wasn't under good control, nor did I start this story with a plan. I started it with an idea and decided to let the direction for where it would go come to me, but that was a mistake on my part. The story has been edited so many times, it was messy, disorganized, and what was I thinking with the POVs altering so much within a chapter? Now, I have a direction and I intend to steer this fic in the direction I want to. @misha-moose-dean-burger from Tumblr is currently beta reading and helping me out with the WIP.
The younger Winchester they had more help to do with the Apocalypse, but everything felt so damn bleak. Nothing could undo the fact that
Could it be that God thought he deserved a second chance in freeing him of his demon blood cravings and was it a test to see if he could resist any upcoming temptation? Why hadn’t God intervened and stopped Lucifer’s rising, or even given Sam a sign not to trust Ruby? His angels surely, for the most part, thought of him as an abomination for what he couldn’t control!
Only sixteen years ago, the four of the siblings were ten, eight, and six. They were so innocent, compared to now, just learning how to hunt the supernatural. There wasn’t anything like that Apocalypse, or getting rid of Lucifer, back then. It was just about finding the yellow-eyed demon Azazel, and saving Hanna, nothing like how things were now.
I hope that I wrote the canon characters correctly, and none of them are OOC. I’m feeling more confident in writing Supernatural characters, especially the boys, so hopefully I didn’t make any mistakes there. This chapter is a bit shorter than the others, so when I have more time and more energy, I should be able figure out how to write the episodes (with alterations) without having to break it into a few parts.
Not long after this, Klaus was a changed man, and not in a good way. Ever since that day, he was just a shell. He was already a strict parent who would occasionally let punishment slide if one of the kids were upset, but he became overly protective and severely more restrictive in his parenting. His obsession with finding Azazel gradually consumed him more and more, to the point that Samuel was the only parent his younger siblings had, and more drastic parenting decisions were made. He didn’t always notice when the results of his ‘drastic parenting decisions’ unless it ended up with him needing to apologize to one of the kids.
of shit from people I worked with when I was a paralegal, I’m not about to put up with more of yours.” He argued frustratedly, ignoring his wife. “Her parents were going to let us live with them, too, and we could’ve been lawyers by now!”
“I used to be in business with my brother. Truth is I was pretty good at the job. But...I made some mistakes, I did some stuff I'm not so proud of, and people got hurt. A lot of people.” Sam admitted. “Including my two cousins here.”
More suspicion is coming upon them, and as a result of their carelessness, they may be exposed sooner than imagined.
Dean let out an irritated sighed. “If I tell Sammy no, then Zachariah’s forcing me the future they want me to see.” He asked, and the angel nodded. “So, if I don’t get killed there, no one here gets hurt and I get back safe, then I don’t have to worry about them getting to my brother, right?”
Dean tries to take present Cas out to a brothel to get his friend to relax and ignores his own feelings toward the angel and concern for Cas’s life. They plan to trap Raphael at sunrise and spend tonight together.
He thought, not pleased with the time-traveler now, who glanced at him like a kicked puppy, then turning to the other three hunters.
She rolled her eyes as he turned around, facing the older hunter, pushing against Dean’s grip. “Rufus! The polluted water, the shooting star, the red Mustang—it's War.” He tried to reason with the older man. “I’m telling you, it’s War.”
“You won’t believe me.” The kid answered with a defeated look in his eyes, widening with shame. “It’s true that Castiel informed us of when and where this attack would happen…. I’m from the future and I was named after you.”
I worried while writing the original that I could’ve been writing an inaccurate portrayal of what that experience is like, and that the information I read had been fully factual. I’ll update the original statement below in the other five parts of the story as well.
Dean looked over at Castiel. “Let us get our shoes on and grab our duffel bags, we’re ready to go.” He answered as stoically as usual, but with a clear gratitude for the angel in his tone as his older brother turned to him with a remorseful look on his face, like a puppy upset that their owner was sad about something they did as he often came across to people when seldom feeling guilty.
Aside from that, he buried his fake IDs and got a job as a bartender at a local bar, and Samuel got a job as a janitor under his middle name. They stayed in separate rooms at a local motel, and to true to his word, the younger hunter gave him as much privacy he needed.
“That’s why I can’t stay here for long.” The seraph explained with urgency in his gravelly voice. “You don’t have a lot of time before the attack begins, Sam. Make your preparations.”
Dean hung up the phone and he felt like drinking until he’d pass out. All this Apocalypse business couldn’t get more complicated than it was right now, and he prayed in his mind for Cas. He needed to see the angel, and to see the face of the trench-coat wearing Cas who would give him to relief he needed
Both lay their heads on the table, using extra jackets they brought for just in case, thankfully they didn’t have to use and get blood on. Sam and Rebekah were tired of walking around looking like they barely survived a bloodbath, and they were beyond worn out.
understand. “Come on. You were hooked on something; I know the look.” She said, pulling a medallion out of her pocket. “Three years sober.”
Before he could protest at this, and reason with his brother, Zachariah appeared in the room with holding a struggle Samuel’s arm. “You would leave without saying goodbye to your favorite pet, Dean? I sent the other two pets of yours back already.” The angel mocked him as the boy hopelessly tried to break Zachariah’s grip on his arm and glanced at the displeased time-traveler. “He’s a feisty little abomination, isn’t he?”
“I just can't figure out how he’s doing it.” Dean said as he cut his brother free at the same time as the time-travelers cut their brother free. “Is the kid okay?” He asked, glancing over at them in concern.
His namesake rushed in one direction, and he and Rebekah followed behind while Ellen when in another direction. Now that they knew where Sam and his namesake were, then they could take care of War.
“Stop it, boys!” She said firmly in her German accent. “You need to be ready when the angel to get here.”
First off, I would like to credit Clowns_or_Midgets for their Spn fic, Of All the Burdens I Must Bear, as an inspiration for this story as of recently. Thank you for reading my fic, and for leaving comments, kudos, bookmarking it, and subscribing.
Emma shook her head. “Why would Michael or Castiel only answer Sam and Dean’s prayers?” She asked him, dumbfounded. “He’s not the hero Dean, so Castiel would be less inclined to answer, and just because Michael’s answered Sammy the last few times doesn’t mean—”
Meanwhile Dean’s namesake recalled that after doing what Klaus told them to, that the medics took the three of them to their father and brother. Neither suffered any physical injuries, and Samuel was too shaken up to speak. Upon asking where their mother was, Klaus was silent and gently explained that he didn’t know, that she must have been taken from the fire.
Now, what was the kid telling his brother that he couldn’t convince Sam to stay with him, instead going off God knows where to do it? Could it have been related to that short monologue defending Sam back in Colorado?
This is the final part of episode three, and I apologize if it’s frustrating that I keep breaking everything up into parts, but I should be able to write longer parts soon. My attention span has been just shot lately and I reuploaded two more of the earlier chapters to this fic on fanfiction.net and coming up with anything write at all on this update has been difficult.
There were things he did that his grief couldn’t excuse, and now, that resulted in all four of those young adults having been accustomed to the hunting life since childhood. They were
In her opinion, Sam always managed to ruin about everything he touched, often without even trying, not that she’d tell him that. Emma knew that her twin really wasn’t a bad person and that he meant well, but sometimes, Sam was so damn selfish. He cared more about his hair and clothes than civilian lives, and he hid his vanity very well with a sensitive and kind act. She had to admit she liked wearing more than thrift store and cheap Walmart brand clothing, but she wouldn’t want to assault or murder somebody over ruining one of her outfits, like he’d be tempted to do. Plus, she didn’t care if anybody knew how poor she and her family was, unlike Sam who was too vain for his own good.
“Maybe I will quit hunting, I don’t know.” His brother responded positively as the three of them went to grab their shoes. “I like the idea of not worrying about getting caught and risk going back to prison every time I work a case.”
Regretfully, Rufus (with black eyes) was closing on them and they fled. “At least we got you, kid.” He said, as looked at the futuristic hunter, making Sam wish he didn’t let Jo catch him off guard in the first place.
He looked undecided. “Yeah, for further evidence if we have to prove our identities, if they’ll even believe it.” He said. “You can’t order me around like you normally do since they’ll think you’re younger.” Sam scoffed as he rolled his eyes. “Age has nothing to do with authority.” He said distastefully. “You know I’m the one who raised you, right? You can’t revoke my right to keep you safe.”
had conditioned you like this and took away what childhood you had left to be raised like soldiers.”
Plus, he was a bit drowsy from the Vicodin and washing it down with whiskey, but he was too energized and motivated to feel too much of it. Rebekah seemed a bit more tired, and he knew that if he weren’t with her, Dean would take her back to the church and stay with her if she needed to doze off.
“No, I’m trying to keep you safe. If they know that I have a bad side, then they suspect I could be a threat or assume that I’m overcompensating for a weakness. Even other hunters can be controlled with fear once they know who they’re up against.” Samuel reasoned in a serious manner, yet no concern for those hunters’ lives in his voice. “They’ll be less inclined to harm myself and my family unless they’re suicidal enough to try. More will be unlikely to try once word is spread that I
date. Plus, thanks to his slip-up and the improvisation that followed, they had to make sure to contact the present version of Castiel instead of the one from this time-period. He tried to put that worry out of his mind as he needed to tend to calm his older brother’s manic episode, or maybe it was a depressive episode this time.
“It’s been so damn long since I’ve seen you kids.” Their grandfather said with relief in his voice, breaking the tension as the four of them sat in the living room, in a slightly German accent, and appearing a bit surprised by two silver drop hop cross earrings in Danny had on, yet not saying anything about it. “I wish it wouldn’t be like this, though.”
Dean seemed to be deep thought for a moment. “Of course. How about you’re our sister?” He suggested. “We can say you’re our step-sister or adopted sister. It makes sense you’d keep the same last name as us.”
“We had to, Sam.” The other young man at the table said in English with a solemn pitch in his soft German accent. He was by the far the second tallest out of all four at the table with soft black hair, brown eyes, and fair skin dressed in a buttoned-up blue and white flannel shirt and loose blue jeans. “Emma and Danny said they’ll call Oma and Opa when they get here. Castiel should be here soon.” He looked about two or three years older, or maybe four years older, than the taller man at the table.
, all of that stuck with him and it still hurt to this moment. His perspective wasn’t listened to and he was treated like an unhinged monster, and from what he’d seen of the boy, he suspected that the boy had been treated similarly.
soon. It was likely that he was getting money from a dishonest source, which may have made him feel ashamed, despite living normally as possible for the moment.
Dean saw them leave the room with a devil’s trap and salt line at that door as well, and he internally sighed in relief, speed walking over to them. This gave him time to wake up Sam and Rebekah, and maybe a little bit of time to get awake.
realize that he was making the hero Sam uncomfortable? His namesake didn’t seem to think himself worthy of his important status, and out of respect, the young man reframed from mentioning it.
The older Winchester sibling glanced a look of annoyance at him. “I don’t know, maybe quit bitching and try praying to Michael or Castiel?” She snapped. “That’s what I’m gonna try doing outside and get my blood.”
This will be written in third person, focusing on the boys’ figuring out who these mysterious hunters are. Hope the quality of this one surpasses the lackluster quality of the original.
Sam knew he was injured, despite his shoulder back in place, but some cuts and a little shoulder pain that weren’t deep enough to need stitches would keep him out. He knew what his limits were, though Dean would try to reason him and Rebekah out of helping. His wife, on the other hand, needed to rest for as long as possible, even though she wouldn’t admit it. The Winchester pride was starting to rub off on her, though, she was better off not having their bad luck streak rubbing off on her, too.
Little things set the boy off, like people continuously calling him a ‘kid,’ and a ‘boy,’ and even the slightest implication that he had a big ego angered him. It
The guy opened the door, and the boys headed out with the three Wolff siblings following them. “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.” Dean said, stopping at the foot of the stairs, looking at Sam and three hunters who invited themselves.
Emma got up and put her wallet away and double-checked her dress pocket to make sure her canteen full of holy water was there and slipped on her black pointy-toed flats by the door. “Sure.” She said with a faint smile as she put on her trench coat, then heading out toward the door, involuntarily wincing before stepping over the salt line as she usually did for the past few years, and Danny didn’t comment, knowing her insecurity regarding that aspect of her demonically modified body. “I’ll keep my phone on, and keep you posted if I see anything.”
“Where’s Sam at, kid?” He demanded the young man, who shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know. I think he went on a smoke break.” Samuel answered in an intentionally naïve tone. “What do you need?”
“You don’t like how I protect my family and you likely believe it’s a complete invasion of privacy.” Samuel admitted quietly in reluctance, looking at the older-looking hunter with remorse. “That’s what my siblings say it is anyways. If I knew another way, I wouldn’t have to do it in this manner.”
For a second, Sam thought he noticed a few burn scars on the kid’s arms and track marks as Samuel became nervous, noticing his namesake seeing arms, turning around to put on the black and pink stripped shirt and buttoning it up whilst Rebekah put on the other shirt he gave him. Sam felt an immediate concern for the boy, seeing the scars and track marks, and decided not to bring it up whenever the two time-travelers came inside, given the lack of privacy as he and D walked inside the diner. He would bring it up later, though, in private.
Still alive here and fixing mistakes that I should have fixed earlier, and after thinking about it, I felt like it's a good idea to put short quotes reflecting on the tone of the chapters before and after the chapter. With so many things out of my control in life, at least one thing I have control of is my writing.
“Ambien? Seriously?” Sam asked in disbelief, hoping they actually weren’t serious about drugging their brother, and if they were, it was messed up that they would attempt that. “Is there a motel nearby, Rebekah?”
Emma could care less about what brand of clothing she wore, and nor did she pretend to look like she was more important than she actually was. Honestly, she thought that getting in Stanford and having a legitimate income in for eight years made him more self-absorbed, while she wasn’t vain at all. Aside from that, they didn’t have similar thoughts when it came down to morality.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their grandfather looked at her with his concern overlapping his worn-out frustration toward his granddaughter’s unusual addiction. At least Sam was able to kick his blood addiction after a year of nearly turning himself into a serial killer on quite a few occasions whilst Emma had been an addict herself for a few years now.
I have had a fascination with Germany, German history, and the culture of Germany since I was fourteen, and that's why I wanted German characters and intend to write them as respectfully as possible. I'm even learning German on the Duolingo app, so if any translations from Google on the original fic were wrong, I should be better at spotting any mistakes that the Google translator might have.
The younger Winchester stormed past future Cas, and out of the hotel room, slamming the door behind him.
It was clear right away that Samuel was afraid of him, which was why he clung to the younger Winchester like Dean would harm the boy, for inadvertently re-releasing Lucifer in the future. If the kid spoke to him, it was with hesitancy and fear, and he stayed close to Sam whenever he was in contact with Dean. The boy looked at him with fear, distrust, or both at the same time, whenever he did make eye contact with the older Winchester, like he was waiting for Dean to pull out his gun and shoot him. Well, he did threaten the boy for getting Sam alone, and put in potential danger, and accused him of being Lucifer.
I noticed the lack of clothing descriptions I gave for Emma and Danny, and at the time, I didn't have a clear idea of how they'd dress. I couldn't think of anything distinctive and I overlooked those details in this chapter, like Samuel's attire I think is distinctive, with an arrogant persona to match his style meant to make others think he's more important than he actually is.
“That is it. Enough with the kung fu wandering the earth thing.” She said stubbornly, glancing over at Samuel, who was on alert. “I’m gonna buy you dinner and we’re gonna talk.”
I should eventually be able to write the German conversation parts on my own instead of relying on Google translate.
he did that. It was still a sensitive topic, and neither of them wanted to upset him more than he already was.
“At least that’s better than death.” She said, letting out a sigh of relief. “Where’s your namesake at, Sam?”
“I’m sorry.” Dean apologized. “Are you all right, Rebekah? I’m about halfway done.” She nodded, feeling the stinging feeling fading, thanks to the Vicodin and whiskey.
When she’d been away for a few years after turning eighteen, she’d allied herself with a demon, but not just any demon. Ruby, of all demons! Somehow back to life and putting herself on the right side of the war this time around, Ruby lent her a hand in acquiring demon blood and kept Emma in the loop for what was going in the Apocalypse.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
normal. As a result, doing just about anything even remotely normal was forbidden. Although he let Sam and twin go on dates occasionally with a classmate in their later teenage years, and Dean himself was never interested in going out with anybody himself.
much. “Come on, then. Somebody should have room for an extra person wherever we end up at.” He said grateful but honestly needing alone time. “You have money for a motel room somewhere, dude? I need a shower and some sleep.”
“You think I’m a monster. I’m jello shots at a party.” War said flippantly, unbothered by Sam’s arguments. “I just remove inhibitions.”
“I trust you finished your planning. We need to leave now.” He said urgently in his gravelly voice, alerting the three Winchesters of his presence. “Are you ready?”
?” She asked skeptically. “Angels, really? You won’t give up on avoiding explaining yourselves, will ya?”
“You’re not a hunter at all, aren’t you, pretty boy? No hunter would be worried about his clothes in a fight!” Tim snarked back, grabbing him by his shirt and pushing him firmly against the wall, and the younger hunter scoffed at the insult, noticing Sam come by from around the corner. “You better tell me where Sam is, or else I’ll rip those designer jeans of yours.”
Right before the seraph headed off, Sam looked at his brother. “You should be honest about your name as well, Dean. It shouldn’t jeopardize the past too much if you use it.” He said, knowing how overly cautious his younger brother could be.  “Of course. Letting them know about our first names shouldn’t compromise our safety.” He answered, feeling terrible for not thinking of how hard it would be for the heroes Sam and Dean to trust hunters they didn’t know, especially if they didn’t even reveal their real first names. “We’ll be fine.”
“Not you, too, Rebekah! Jesus fucking Christ, my siblings are rubbing off on you more than I thought.” He complained irritability as he snorted. “Anyways, what last name are we gonna use? I prefer our real one, so whatever we come up with must start with ‘w.’ It’ll be easier to remember that way.”
“Emma,” her grandmother said gravely in concern as Danny shut his bedroom door whilst she was about to close her, and turned around, “
In the case of this story, Sam realizes that Samuel has a limited capacity of understanding non-familial relationships, despite faking those emotions for years when he must. That’s where Sam comes in, he helps the kid named after him to understand concepts like that foreign to him.
Sam realized his mistake when he saw the strange glances his and Dean’s namesakes gave him upon his effort to comfort Rebekah. He knew that mistakes would be made, yet he didn’t expect himself to tune out of their surroundings in comforting his wife.
The bartender shut the TV off, who said, “Damn. Is it me or does it seem like it’s the end of the world?”
He appeared to be around twenty-three or twenty-four, or perhaps closer to twenty-two, depending on who one asked.
A group of three people sat inside a small, two floor house in a pleasant German suburb in Berlin. They sat in the dining room of the home at a moderately long black table with a worn out, black railed chandelier with a dimmed light on it. One could hear a middle-aged woman in the kitchen listening to a German-spoken podcast on her phone whilst cooking a meal on the stove, not too far from the dining room. Also, one could also hear an old HD TV on in the living room, where a middle-aged man was watching football while unwinding in a comfortable recliner.
“He’s not saying yes to Lucifer. I’ll make sure of it.” She said stubbornly. “Unlike me, Sammy has a chance to have a life without hunting. He can still take his bar exam and make his namesake proud.”
“You’re fast, Rebekah, I wonder what else you can do with that speed?” He complimented suggestively with a wink.
his, angel wouldn’t give away information like that to a few hunters who seemed like they had knowledge of this before it happened. Where would they even get this information if they were lying? Plus, how did the younger kid know Sam wasn’t trying to release Lucifer? Seriously, how many angels would know the intimate details about this whole Apocalypse fiasco? It was more like a ‘you had to be there,’ sort of thing to understand, so how would the kid know?
“Very simple. There’s, well, almost an open phone line between a vessel and his angel.” His friend, just his friend and not his, never mind, explained to the older Winchester. “One just has to know how to dial.”
“I need to buy weed.” The boy said quickly, visibly anxious. “Smoking weed calms my nerves, and it’s more expensive here, and I also ran out of DMT and shrooms.”
The time-traveler assured him that he’d find a dealer around to illegally buy it until he could obtain false paperwork to get it from a doctor in the present. He was getting more concerned about the kid with every piece of unpleasant information he learned about Samuel, or surprising ones, like Rebekah wasn’t his sister.
She smiled as she stood up, along with her husband, and gestured for the two Winchester siblings. “I need to go check something,” Dan said vaguely, then walking over to by the front door, and grabbed the older Winchester sibling’s bag, and brought it over.
23 “He doesn’t care about us, or our namesakes, whose lives are in more danger than ours are right now! If anything, he should take accountability for the dicks he put in charge and end them himself.”
As for why I’ve decided to diverge from following the episode plots as closely as possible, that’s because the chapters of when I did that, proof reading that format felt uninspired. I’m not gonna diverge too far from the episodes, of course.
not to stare at it and hoping that he didn’t give himself away. He hoped Dean and Rebekah were okay, and all of this in here would end soon with no harm to his namesake, or the civilian.
“You’re not fine, Samuel.” The younger Winchester disagreed with concern and guilt rising in his voice as he knew the boy’s body language when he wasn’t actually alright after spending a few weeks around him. “You and your brother said it’s not my fault. It’s my fault, if I did what I was supposed to, Heaven wouldn’t have used either of you.”
“Yeah, are you and Dean serious gonna drug me?” Samuel demanded incredulously. “I’m not sedating myself on the road just for you both to have quiet, and I won’t be used as your practice torture dummy either. Can’t you guys just wait until we find a demon to interrogate?”
Sam learned that Samuel was bipolar on the same day upon arriving and that the kid took prescribed Lithium, but he would be out the next day. He asked the time-traveler what dosage he took and wondered if this was what it was like to have a younger brother.
making them tired now. They were both too tired to argue with him, nor was Sam in the mood to tell them about what happened while with his namesake.
“Who ran off and disappeared.” The archangel lamented. “Who left no instructions and a world to run.”
. He had an inkling that either Samuel was possessed by Lucifer, or the kid was keeping more secrets. Either way, when Cas would answer of his prayers, he could probably tell if Lucifer was using the boy as his meatsuit.
Dean grabbed his jacket and walked toward the bed and put his jacket on. “How’d you find me this time? I thought I was flying below the angel radar.” He rubbed his ribs to show his point. “You find God yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?”
instead. Thus, allowing them to save Lindsay, and Sam wished that he could fill her in on everything. She wouldn’t believe him, and it would put a dent in the plan, and furthermore put her at risk.
“You can’t pick up a phone? What are you, allergic to giving me peace of mind?” She asked incredulously, clearly upset. “I got to find out that you’re alive from Rufus?”
Sam looked dejected with his rather innocent guilt-inducing blue eyes. “Do I have to use my middle name? I hate being called Henry!” He complained childishly with a groan. “I want something that at least sounds like my first name.”
The older hunter would’ve chuckled at the irony, but the kid being a law school nerd aside, how does his college girlfriend get involved in all of this. Unless it involved…
Sam scoffed as he rolled his eyes. “Age has nothing to do with authority.” He said distastefully. “You know I’m the one who raised you, right? You can’t revoke my right to keep you safe.”
Well, originally, I planned to refer to the time-travelers by their aliases starting last chapter. I changed my mind last chapter and thought about series. Sam and Dean kept secrets from each other, and it caused distrust, and the time-travelers don’t want to cause any distrust to interfere with their goal of stopping the Apocalypse.
As he diligently worked, getting drinks for the few customers inside and wiping off the bars, Sam noticed that the two of them were arguing over something in German before they both seemed to calm down. He noticed D was about to leave the bar and approached them.
“Got you, son of a bitch! I knew you had something to do with demons coming here!” She snapped, aiming his own gun against his head, then turning to them for a moment. “Why’d you wait so long to let one ‘em possess you?”
Samuel and Rebekah both lay sitting up on the right bed, close to the door, back against the bed mantle whilst Sam sat on the edge on the left side of the other mattress and D sat on the edge of the right side. She lay her head on her husband’s shoulder and begun to fall asleep on him. They’d just sat down and got comfortable whilst waiting for the futuristic angel to arrive fifteen minutes ago. “Let’s see if we made the news,” D said, reaching for the remote on the bedside table, and turning it on, and the small flatscreen TV was set on a local news channel.
Austin exchanged bullets from behind the car, huddled alongside a few others, with another young man in an upper window of the house. The older woman crossed herself and folded her hands whilst the shaggy-haired man hurried along beside a fence. The young man peered around the corner and another man shot at him, who pulled back, keeping the pregnant woman behind him. The shaggy-haired man and the other man exchanged fire.
“What if we just said that Rebekah graduated from secondary school early and got accepted into a university, so she had more time away from hunting than you?”
“Show him Castiel some fucking respect, Sammy. He didn’t have to turn to us for help, and I’m sure he didn’t sign up to deal with your sacrilegious attitude!” Dean snapped at him, surprising the angel, given that the older-looking brother of the two had a very calm nature. “I don’t suppose a narcissist like you would care if he decided to not let us help at all now, right?”
Dean thought with remorse of having to wake them up to go back out, despite he wanted to not wake them and let them sleep.
There was a sporting goods store on the near side of the street and the far end seemed to be residential. Unexpectedly, but not surprisingly, they found a blue Sedan with two doors overturned and discovered to be empty.
The coffee maker was loudly brewing, so alongside the employees moving around on the dirty white and pink stripped floor, an older-aged man sitting at the green painted bar with pink edges flipped the pages of a newspaper in his hands. The yawns were inevitable as well from a waitress refilling the older man’s coffee from behind the bar.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam knew his violent tendencies and difficulties with containing them, oftentimes requiring one of his siblings or Rebekah to hold him back. He was especially keeping them the most vulnerable people save from himself, as he was considered dangerous for more than a few good reasons. It’s not like anybody outside of the family would understand if he would ever be drunk or high enough to talk about it with somebody. It worked efficiently for Sam and had recommended his three siblings to do the same as kids, and naturally recommended it for Rebekah as well.
“Oh, nothing. Whoo. It’s been a long time since I’ve laughed that hard.” Dean said with enjoyment in his voice as they got in the Impala, and it was with Cas. “It’s been more than a long time. Years.”
Either way, the question of how Samuel could speak of non-familial people in such apathetic and flippant manner ran through his mind, but both tragedy and psychological trauma could change people. By his description and implication, he seemed to deal with people who harmed him or his family by harming them, or God, even
Now that Sam and Dean have gone their separate ways for a few days, both accompanied by one or two time-travelers, they learn more about the future and a few of their secrets slip. The time-travelers named after them, now called D and Samuel, alongside the ever attractive and mysterious Rebekah, tell them things that the boys now wish they didn’t know about the future.
“No, it’d be my fault. I wanted to look more in the first place. He wouldn’t get killed that easily, you know that.” The kid argued with guilt in both his voice and in his blue eyes widening with fear. “Either way, we’ll find him, or he’ll find us. You know death isn’t really permanent with us, Rebekah.”
I hope none of the characters were OOC in any way and I apologize for the long wait for this chapter!
It didn’t mean if his father was wrong about his evil, it was still right to defend family no matter what, because that’s what Winchester’s did.
Sam and his namesake were in the bar that night working, and Lindsay didn’t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary with either of them so far. After the first couple of days of being alone here, Samuel was
Demons killing Sam and his twin’s mother, and then kidnapping and holding his mother hostage years later, made their father paranoid about letting his four kids do about
“Sam, it’s quarter past four.” Dean frustratingly reminded his brother, who rolled his eyes and gave him a bitch face, coming into the room. He shut the door after Sam came in, who was more than upset with him. “What are you—”
about something, then they’d return to find you if his namesake wanted to.” The boy named after him explained remorsefully. “I assume Sammy must’ve already told him, and your brother would already be on his way along with mine.”
She nodded. “Yes, I will. You three just stay safe and come back alive, or your opa will raise hell.” She answered.
He thought a bit worriedly and frustratingly, starting to feel like the boy’s older brother more than anything, despite being the same age.
“Black-eyed demons are the least of our worries; they’re probably just distractions as for why they’re here. Anyways, we’re up against something far bigger.” He said, somewhat nervously, setting the room off in alert. “Have any of you heard of one of the Four Horseman, War? My siblings and I have knowledge of him, but I’m afraid it’s not sufficient enough to rely on.”
“Alexander.” He answered, then looked toward Sam. “I’ll probably just go with D to make it easier to remember. You need to be called
Sam’s wife, not his sister. It’s easier to say that I’m their sister because he treats more like a sibling while on cases.”
“Fallujah. Two tours. Got back a little over a year ago.” Austin answered. “Takes one to know one. Where’d you serve?”
“You’re gonna go out again?” Dean asked his younger brother, knowing why he wanted to, but didn’t think it was a good idea with what just happened. “Well, crap doesn’t hit the fan with coffee breaks.” Sam retorted.
Admittedly, he had only known the kid for a week and half, and after practically living with him, he quickly learned that Samuel had a fragile ego and a need for constant attention. Honestly, this tendency of his could seriously get him hurt or even killed if he angered the wrong hunter at the wrong time.
” Dean said in German, looking up briefly at his brother for a moment, before going back to stitching her shoulder back up. “
“And I thought you were supposed to be impressive.” The older Winchester taunted. “All you do is black out the room.”
Things don't go as planned when going out to find Jo. Sam and his time-traveler named after him end up getting caught and tied up by Rufus and Jo, who think they're demons. Dean, Ellen, and the two other time-travelers must figure out what do and save the two hunters in time. Now, the time-travelers' insight for what will happen in the future comes in handy, and they know what they must do.
22 “Stop there. How many times have you prayed and still never got an answer from him? I still can hardly believe he exists, but anyways, if he cared, he’d put an end it to it before it’d get this bad.”
“So do you. Look, Keith.” She said with kindness in her tone to match the seriousness in it. “I don’t know you and I’m the last person to be giving advice, but I do know that no one has ever done anything so bad that they can’t be forgiven. That they can’t change.”
2 “No one’s to blame here. Let your brother’s namesake calm down and think clearly before you accidentally agitate him more.”
Sam looked dejected with his rather innocent guilt-inducing blue eyes. “Do I have to use my middle name? I hate being called Henry!” He complained childishly with a groan. “I want something to at least sound like my first name.” Calmly with no surprise on his face, Dean looked at him. “We could just call you Samuel instead.” He said in a slightly teasing, only half-serious tone. “I’m using my middle name, or maybe just
“He’s not lying, Ellen.” Sam’s namesake said, coming to his aid. “No offense, but didn’t him, his brother, and sister tell you something would happen, and it did? It’d be stupid to not let them help.”
I decided to put in my own headcanons of Jess, namely that she came from a wealthy family. Given that it is an AU, of course, the canon divergences will kick in fully later on, while maintaining the show’s canon up, except for the changes in my ideal s15.
Sam struggles with his own self-loathing by distracting himself from it while waiting for the current disaster about to come to be prevented, and plus, he should have a talk with Samuel about what boundaries, privacy, and not drawing attention to himself. Thankfully, the time-traveler is a handful enough to keep him busy.
Sam had a hard time believing it, despite the young man having a point. “How do you know all of this?” He asked, yet his gratitude for the kind words remained. “You said Cas told you all of this, right?”
“I’m sure that’ll go over smoothly, Sam. We’ll go in with a suspiciously identical last name.” Dean snapped back at his brother with frustrated sarcasm. “As far as anybody in the past knows, there’s no other Sam and Dean Winchester. Can you stop being so goddamn bitchy about everything?!” Rebekah was about to intervene when the woman from the kitchen entered.
The heroes Sam and Dean had hunter contacts and they were ambushed by hunters who attempted to kill them before at different points in their lives, so if the stories were accurate, then not all hunters outside of the family were bad. Steven Archer, the four Winchester siblings’ godfather, wasn’t a blood relative and he’d been considered family since he played a large part in raising their father and his twin brother, Blaise, when their grandparents were still hunters.
“Padré, you know what she's talking about—the water?” Dean said, turning to the pastor, who answered, “The river. Ran polluted all of a sudden.”
At least Emma wasn’t as irritable and irrational as Sam was when he was still a blood junkie, and she didn’t get into homicidal mood swings, like he did. Emma could get clean from demon blood if he could. Either way, complaining about what-ifs and the injustices that their family had endured would only waste time. It wasn’t like he didn’t appreciate having a break and unwind for a little while, but the urgency of the situation made Danny too anxious to enjoy his break from the family business.
“We can’t say,” D interrupted his brother as he was about to speak, “we’ve already intervened enough to disrupt the future, and if we tell you what happens, there’s the chance of giving you a false hope of them happening. We’ve already interfered enough.” His brother scoffed. “Dean, we should—” He tried to reason, but his brother shot him an irritated look. “I know we should, Sammy, but can’t you see how much has already changed?” He said, looking at Samuel with an urgent look. “There’s a chance we can be overheard, too!”
Rufus backhanded him as Jo splashed him with water, looking at him confused. What, did they think him, and the kid were demons? The older, possessed hunter grabbed Sam’s neck and forced his head back.
Sam didn’t feel as alone and he looked over at the corner of the room, seeing a familiar blued-eyed Winchester in the shade almost expertly hidden away from sight peeking over at them with realization on his face in the corner before turning away. He was going to have serious talk about privacy with Samuel later, as a side note.
The younger Winchester couldn’t hold his question off about what War had suggested to him and older brother any longer and asked the boy about it. Samuel immediately tensed and hesitated, before giving another shocking admission.
“Yes, it is.” The older Winchester said as they all sat down. “You mind just, uh, running us through what happened?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“You’re War, I know that. I’d rather not hear about how you used my country for your own entertainment!” He snapped at the Horseman, pleasantly surprising War.
“Whoa. Okay. That’s a sweet little knife.” The Horseman taunted them, glancing over at the younger kid in the back with amusement. “But come on. You can’t kill war, kiddos. By the way, ask Samuel back there about his blood, you’ll find his answer interesting.”
She sighed after she got off the bus and decided to look up where to find the closest black market, running her hand through her shoulder length hair. Sometimes she’d hated Sam so damn much and wish he’d go on a vacation far away from her for a month or two, but then again, she’d miss him just as much.
“Sit down, alright?” His namesake asked the boy, who didn’t believe he deserved that right, and sat down across from his namesake. “Do you trust them to call or text when they need to, if they can reach you? Do you trust me, too?”
At the dining room table, there was tension and frustration between all three people. There were three small duffel-bags by each person’s feet at the table, where all three had a pair of house slippers on over their socks. “Couldn’t we have booked a later flight?” A young man said in English with distress in his German accent. He was by the far the tallest out of all three at the table with ebony black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin dressed in a black Henley shirt and black skinny jeans. “We would’ve been fine if we waited fifteen minutes!”
“Yeah, I’m fine, dude. We’ll get out of here alive, okay?” He reassured the young man in a whisper. “My brother’s probably on his way and he’ll be here, too. I know it’s hard, but keep your head up, alright?”
Sam shook his head. “No, he’s not. How about he adopted you after, say, your parents died in a hunting accident and you had no other relatives able to take you in after we moved to the States? It’s a more interesting cover than usual.” He suggested after a moment of thinking. “The other ones are getting boring.”
The original chapter title was “Sins To be Tortured For,” and I realized that it seems unfitting for this chapter. Samuel’s secret he tells his namesake but tries to keep from it his namesake’s brother out of fear in the meantime.
Earlier, Sam helped the time-travelers dispose of the bodies and got his backpack from the motel room. He carjacked a moderately worn out vehicle from the motel parking lot and dropped Lindsay off somewhere discreet. He felt terrible for the psychological harm he’d caused her, only by showing his in Garber. He felt like just a profound apology and disappearing wasn’t enough, but there was nothing he could do.
The oldest Winchester brother, like everyone else, heard bullets nearby. They had to stop this pointless bloodbath, cut the ring off War’s finger, and save Ellen and Jo’s lives. He was merely following behind his namesake, Dean’s namesake, with his brother and Rebekah.
Dean and Rebekah told them that War couldn’t be killed and one of them had to use their demon killing knives to slice the ring off his finger. Without that ring, War would be weak, and the town would return to normal.
Nobody was expecting the younger Wolff brother to stand up and state why he wasn’t giving up, like he was expecting a Nobel Prize for it. The kid was driven, that was for sure, and so was Rebekah. Dean could’ve gone without listening to the short monologue, though. Sam thought a bit longer about what they could do; he could save figuring the tall kid out later. “What if we get everyone guns?” He suggested to the group, and his brother replied, “What, are you gonna arm up baby bump over here?”
At last, the second to last part of episode two. I’ll get the hang out writing out episodes better, hopefully not relying on the transcripts of the episodes too often, and I think I’m doing okay as far as that goes. I hope nothing in the canon characters’ have been OOC, and if so, how can I improve that?
“I—I apologize.” He stammered. “My siblings and I were informed that the Winchester brothers would be here sometime today. My younger brother suggested we wait until they get here, so we don’t have to repeat ourselves.”
If Dean hadn’t known that angels exist, then he would have thought the young man was crazy. That knife looked just like theirs, only with the handle worn out and the edges of the blade itself a bit rusted.
Dean was worn out himself, but he wasn’t tired enough to crash at the time like Sam and Rebekah were. He didn’t need any painkillers today either, or in general, only took them when in severe pain.
His older sister rolled her eyes. “You’re starting to sound as bitchy as Sammy.” She remarked dryly, then spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. “In defense of Germany, why do you think America has so many mass shootings and there’s so little of them here?”
Samuel knew that Tim would pull out the vial of demon blood and he tried to shield himself from looking at it, but he gulped when he first saw it.
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
the recipient of Samuel’s snobbish attitude and spoken to him like Sam was his superior. Dean’s own namesake was protective of him and Sam, but not like Samuel was toward Sam. The kid gravitated toward his brother, especially when he was around. Seriously, did Samuel really think that the older Winchester would harm him?
Sam paused for a moment upon heading toward the empty front desk and grabbed a couple of plastic bags for putting the cans of rock salt in. He knew that time-travel was possible through angels, but what did the kid mean by being named after him?
The kid shook his head. “I don’t remember how long,” the young man whispered back weakly, “but they poured salt, holy water, and tried to exorcise me. What about you?”
Thank you for any leavings of kudos, bookmarking, and subscriptions. I’ve been watching a lot of Criminal Minds lately and I’m working through season three now in between my online classes. Episode five, “Seven Seconds,” is primarily what helped with my recent writer’s block.
“So, your parents were drunk when they named you and you shoot Bambi?” She asked him, then glancing at the time-traveler. “Your middle name is Samuel and that’s his first name, too?”
Quickly thinking, Sam pulled out Ruby’s knife and stabbed the demon in the neck and didn’t notice the normal side-effects of the knife used on the demon. The blood on it and on the floor was enticing, and he looked at it intensely.
4 “Don’t you fucking start on that, Sammy. You don’t control what happens in the past, present, or future, and if you did, I’d hate to be one of your enemies.”
Ruby will get the redemption arc that I believe she deserves and will her relationship with Sam be salvageable? What about his feelings for Castiel, though? My influences as of late have been from Criminal Minds, Dexter, Hannibal, and Final Fantasy Vii, but I will make it as true to Spn as it should. Spoilers from any of the above will be mentioned in the authors notes and most chapters will probably remain unchanged.
By the time Emma and Danny Winchester boarded their flight and arrived at their grandparents home a few hours later in Berlin, Germany, they were informed of Sam, Dean, and Rebekah’s trip into past. Emma and Danny found the story how the three of them ran into Castiel, who escaped from 2020, and went into the past with him to change the truth
“No.” Dean answered, then he grabbed a shotgun and headed for the door with the older kid and Rebekah expectantly following behind him. “Everybody sit tight. I got to—”
“As good you look in linen and silk sweaters, I suggest buying cotton sweaters next time.” Samuel complimented, yet critiqued her pleasantly. “Don’t you have cashmere sweaters? I remember buying you one a few months ago.”
“Wait, you don’t believe your code is righteous? Your way of doing things is moral if my dad taught me correctly.” Samuel asked his namesake quietly with confusion heavy in his usual stoic tone. “Don’t you believe that doing what’s best for your family, even if they don’t like it, must be done?”
“Yeah. Call your brother and get him to get mine here.” He demanded furiously, despite his suspicion about why the boy named his brother wanted to go alone with him. “I don’t care that the kid needs alone time with Sam. He doesn’t know he put my brother in danger, does he?”
The younger Winchester opened his laptop to a calligraphed page of the Book of Revelations in Latin and highlighted a section and magnified it. He realized that neither of them had told Bobby about the time-travelers yet as he picked up the phone and scrolled past a few names until he reached Bobby’s.
“No, man, you’re the first people we’ve seen here.” Dean answered, aware of their surroundings. “There’s gotta be a place without any freakin’ demons! We’ll take care of the rest.”
Emma nodded in agreement, then realized something. “Wait, Sam, Dean, and Rebekah had their guns when they left.” She said with frustration, turning to her twin. “How’d they get theirs past airport security? Maybe they gave their guns to Castiel and he dropped them off here.”
“I need your help because you are the only one from the present who’ll help me.” Present Cas insisted and who was the hunter to resist such an attractive—no, such a desperate friend. “
“I thought someone should go out and see what’s going on!” War kept up the act, looking fearful toward the time-travelers. “What’s wrong with those two? None you can seriously believe them, right? They’re crazy!”
It seemed so in their most recent interactions as he was skittish around Dean, and not nearly as skittish with Sam, who had a few days alone with him. It was like the boy was afraid of him, or maybe felt safer around his brother who was on the same boat as far as the Lucifer situation went. Now wasn’t the time to be thinking about all of that, and everything was set in place. To give that illusion that nothing was going on before Steve would die on that demon case, Sam and the boy were working in the bar that evening, after giving the excuse that they had to leave for a family emergency.
