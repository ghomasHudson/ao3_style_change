The nurse says, and John thanks her, feeling relieved. At least they would skip that awkward situation, of them trying to send John home, and John insisting he stays.
“She is… dangerous, John. She must have been the link between Moriarty and the group in Serbia that I was missing. They contacted her, I’m not sure when. She arrived and recognized me immediately. The men wanted to keep me as a bargaining chip against my brother. She didn’t like that, and poisoned their drinks at the next opportunity. I saw their corpses. She told me that she would bring me back to England, and that something terrible would happen if I didn’t comply. Not that I had much of a choice, she kept me drugged and tied up in the boot of her car. Next thing I knew, I was in the room in your basement. And …” Sherlock closed his eyes tightly for a second. “I heard your voice, John.”
Sherlock says, feeling weirdly pleased with John harbouring murderous feelings towards Sherlock’s enemies.
first wives throw open their coat to press their husbands enthusiastically, while the girlfriend is engaging in a long shared kiss with her girlfriend. Two minutes later, and all the waiting people have found their person. Everyone is hugging and laughing, while Sherlock is still standing there alone, feeling stupid with his lilac poster and the cactus.
Sherlock did end up coughing a lot during the night, and finally John took him by the hand and rolled him on his back. For a second Sherlock stiffened with fear, but John rubbed his arm. „It’s okay,“ he whispered, „now you can breath better, right?“ Sherlock quickly nodded.
rubs her head against his arm. It gives credit to these creatures that they did not run away when the spider attacked.
so changeable like the sea. Sherlock has long curly hair, bound together with a thin piece of seaweed, a too thin body and a mouth so kissable that John couldn’t resist long.
Find yourself a partner. Everyone throws and catches the ball five times, after that I want you to run between the pylons Professor Holmes will put out. Throw the ball to each other while running, and don’t lose sight of your surroundings.
. Sherlock’s cock jumps free, erect with the newly experienced excitement. John gets up to divest them both of their socks and shoes, before sliding on top of Sherlock.
John explains, then discovers Sherlock’s predicament and hurriedly presses his quivering head against his chest.
Suddenly, Sherlock desperately wants to tell John about Mary’s threats, about the potion he hides in the secret cupboard next to his bed, and most of all what is going to happen to Sherlock tonight after he drinks it.
Sherlock fidgets in his seat. He has no one to talk to, every person of his delegation had to leave after the ceremony, and he doesn’t speak the language well enough (the language spoken in this kingdom had been forbidden by King
And now he is here, and he is either starving or going mad. It feels like he is the only living person on this planet right now. Who knows, maybe something terrible happened in the outside world, humanity was wiped out, and he is the only survivor.

“It is just for one night. I will survive, and tomorrow we can go straight home. Or you can just go home now, put Mrs Hudson’s mind at ease and sleep comfortable in our bed.
The man raised his gorgeous eyes and for a moment John was blinded with the light in it. On the slave market they seemed almost subdued compared too now. They shone in all forms of cover, from light green to deep blue. Something primal in John wanted the young man right on this table, NOW, but he restrained himself. Soon.
hospital. It was only logical. The world needed John Watson, Sherlock needed him, and after all, he would be back soon.
Sherlock Holmes is standing at the window, playing music. The flat is absolutely wonderful. It reminds Paddington a bit of Mr.
Sherlock lowers his head to hide his face as he answers quietly: “What if something happened to you while I am gone?
Sherlock gaze meets his eyes. He stretches out his hand and starts drumming on John’s shoulder (how John had missed his soft touch!).
Mary turned out to be not pregnant (and John stills feels an immense sense of relief when he thinks about it). Mary ran away, and Sherlock and John persuaded her, finally a team again.
The employee asked him if he wanted to see his dead wife as well, but John declined. He will not get her face out of his mind for the rest of his life. She will surely haunt him until his last day, he didn’t need to see her body. He is a hundred percent certain she is died. John did shoot her, after all.
Sherlock asks, and hands the ladle around. In a matter of minutes, everyone has flower in their hair, and after some enthusiastic convincing, Sherlock puts one flower into his hair, behind his ear.
John tips Sherlock on his shoulder, and Sherlock nearly blows himself into space, so startled is he.
John presses the boy to his chest and scoops him up. The movement is so familiar, it takes his breath away. He marches through the gaping crowd with his precious charge flush to his chest.
With that done he fired off a short text to Lestrade, asking him if he was home and if John could come. John didn’t feel like facing Mycroft right away, that pompous ass hat probably knew everything, and Lestrade was a police man after all and more than capable of creating a safe space for them.
The merman doesn’t immediately answer, which is unusual for him. He sits in John’s lap and stares silently ahead.
That’s when he knew that the bastard had done it again. Survived the non-survivable, first too many drugs, then that encounter with the cabby posing as a serial murderer, then the pool and then the roof of St. Bart’s. John had hidden is face in his hands, his shoulders shaking, swearing. When he had calmed down a bit, pale as a sheet, hand not shaking, he said to Lestrade that he would destroy the person who did this. He promised the soldier, who never looked more terrifying than at this moment, to not stop him.
warns them. Each year, on some night, students will decide to walk into the Forbidden Forest anyway.
Sherlock says into John’s ear while his boyfriend is clearly adamant to carry Sherlock around for the rest of the evening.
Sherlock mumbles and carefully sits up. They are lying cuddled together on the couch, the credits from their third Halloween that night still playing.
“I’m fine. It was just scary when you were suddenly gone, and there were strangers everywhere! Eventually I made it, and an elderly lady helped me.
John laughed, but it was not happy laughter: “No, Sherlock. For now, I don’t give a fuck about how you did it. I want to know why.”
. I think there is a country south of it, where people may speak a different language, but own unbelievable riches.
She had planned this after she had heard the news that Sherlock miraculously survived her bullet. A bolthole and enough of the Devil’s Foot hallucinogen that would knock a man out for several days. Supplied by the always helpful
He groaned and hit his pillow with his flat hand. The lies parents tell their children! His mum persuaded him to drive to Wiltshire, saying it would be nice to have one last family holiday together before
He had been a gladiator for nearly two years, after the war had ended. An arrow had hit his shoulder on the last battlefield, and the army didn’t want him any more. His shoulder had slowly healed, his search for a fulfilling life not. He preferred a certain death in the Colosseum over a boring life in the streets of Rome. He was in the middle of his twenties and John already regarded his life as over.
The students stare remorseful at their desks and nod. Sherlock sighs and rubs his aching forehead. He contemplates skipping the flowers experiment, but he does not want to ruin their first school day any further.
“How about I stay there in the corner with my tea, and you come over to me in your break, and we will continue talking?
“Mary took him as her hostage, she drugged him, we don’t know what yet, and he likely has a concussion. A few scrapes, too. Sherlock is resting now.
“Citizens of Rome! I got a very special one for you today. Fresh from the British Isles, a man of 21 years, in perfect health, has all his teeth and has had no sicknesses.
The delivery boy blushed. His face turned into a charming colour of red, like his jacket. With an awkward movement he handed Sherlock the four pizzas. Unfortunately his hands suddenly were not able any more to carry some food because Sherlock immediately dropped one box. The pizza fell out of the box and landed face down on the floor. Both boys stared at the mess for a long second. Sherlock had never felt so humiliated in his life.
‘. It must be a sibling because you don’t seem to be the type of man who has many friends. It looks like it has been touched and then let go again several times, there are blotches all over it. You wouldn’t need to send a letter if she still lived in Rome, but you definitely have issues with her. The letter also addressed a Claudia, maybe a friend. It could be that you were interested in her, or something else. Maybe gambling, but I guessed alcohol.
"This is something I have thought about for a long time, and well, I tried to find a spectacular method, but I think, nothing could be more perfect than this moment. Us, under the stars.“
His mother would die two months later, and the police would rule it as a suicide. John himself was not so sure. Their father disappeared with a small pension and John hopes he drank himself to death.
"Mycroft should have let me go on that secret mission. Then this whole mess wouldn't have happened."
He was now sitting together with Bill, his oldest friend, on one of the uncomfortable wooden chairs next to the pulpit where the priest was waiting.
John says, takes Sherlock’s hand brushes gently with his fingers over Sherlock’s hand to calm him down. Crowded rooms can be a challenge to Sherlock’s finely tuned senses, and this hospital room is especially annoying with all the extra noises.
Mary has kidnapped and drugged Sherlock for days. Sherlock has weird hallucinations about a baby, a secret sister and a John Watson he doesn't recognize anymore. Fortunately the real John Watson is on his way for the rescue, always prepared to protect and heal the love of his life.
That was a naive dream. He was still a slave, and John was his master. A master that looked hungry and disappointed every night Sherlock slept on the couch.
His kidnapper didn’t waste much time with working him open. He showed him a huge and wide plug (really, what a terrible word).
After about five minutes of this, he regrets the fact that he forgot to bring his smartphone. He has a map app on it and could also watch the time, but without it, he is lost right now. He is hungry, he is tired and John is nowhere to be seen.
“Sherlock, I would love to carry you right into our bed, but this cactus is poking right into my stomach.
John laughs. “Maybe there was someone in there who wants to give their visitors a special fright. Though, I think I have enough for today. Do you want to head home?
His trousers and pants were now down to his knees, and John saw the abomination at once. His face did something complicated. Shock, horror, sadness and then so much anger. His eyes were shooting sparks.
John gulps. He promises Mrs. Holmes to call her immediately, then ends the call. He ignores the worried glance the cab driver throws him and stares out of the window.
. He would have recognized those halls anytime. “It’s our annual Winter’s ball! I now recall again how much we loved them!
John decides to walk there and quickly pays the cab driver. Fortunately, the hospital is not far away. Most people catch a quick glance of him and jump out of his way. The sun is shining and the street looks beautiful, but John doesn’t register any of it. He is praying with his every step.
Yet, Sherlock could not risk it. He had never tried being in a relationship, or kissing. Or, anything else.
Sherlock never believed in stuff like that, but it did sound very romantic. Surely John would enjoy it as well? They need all the luck they can get.
’s office, shooter unknown. That day he drove like a maniac in the middle of the night to the St. Mary hospital and sat in silence next to a suffering John Watson for over five hours. When the doctor came out of the operation room to announce that the patient’s heart was no longer beating, his heart stopped for a few agonizing seconds too. Greg couldn’t even remember John’s reaction, he only heard a soft, whispered no‘. Then someone shouted for the doctor from the hall, and she ran back, looking shocked.
John begs and tries to get hold of him, but the merman just crawls over the sand like a crab  and vanishes into the sea.
He licked Sherlocks chest from navel to his collarbone and Sherlock jerked back so hard that his head was knocked back to the edge of the table.
Someone announces and Sherlock is unbuckled. He immediately kicks in the direction of his captors, but they just jump aside and laugh at him. Sherlock’s face is burning with shame. What will John think of Sherlock when he catches sight of him, shamed and brutalized like this? It does not bear to think about.
Paddington Bear always believes in the good of people. This is how he reformed the Brown Family, the prison inmates and guards, and maybe even Mr Buchanan.
A new voice addresses him from the side. Sherlock turns his head so quickly that he hits his knee under the table. Professor Watson wears a cuddly, brown jumper under his dark robes, and there are a few grey streaks in his blond hair, which makes him look more sophisticated.
That’s why he cannot understand who steals his precious orange marmalade every morning. Every day of the week, his breakfast had gone missing, and Paddington could not figure out who the hell would do this to him. His orange marmalade is loved by everyone in the street (except of course Mr. Curry), and if they wanted some of it, they can just ask. Judy is busy with her girlfriend, Jonathan with his grades, Mrs Brown with her paintings and Mr Brown is strangely avoiding him, so there is only one person he can talk about this.
I’m glad I get to work today. You meet the best people and see the most wonderful things on these shifts.

The church was crammed with people in non-white clothes and funny hats. Yellow and white flowers decorated the seats. The floor was hidden under a red carpet.
’s house. The last years he and Molly had always left again after two hours and spent the rest of the night watching a spooky film together. They were not traditional party people. Now that Greg was there, she would most likely go with him, Sherlock thought. Everyone would have a nice night.
The other three go back to their initial conversation about the last Champions League game of the year, when Greg suddenly shouts.
Sherlock had grown paler and paler over the last two hours. Mary had made herself another cup of tea and now played with the buttons on the detectives white shirt. The man was sweaty, shaking and whimpering every few minutes.
Sherlock walked back into the room, feeling numb. He pressed the box into his mom’s hand and sat down on his bed, right next to his dad and
Sherlock asks, and John accepts gratefully. They spent a wonderful evening on the sofa together, the clouds wander away and the stars are shining.
He tries again, and this time someone answers, but it does not put Sherlock’s mind at ease, on the contrary.
The slave was now shaking all over, obviously terrified, while the other man was inspecting his genitalia. The inspector tugged at his cock, his other hand wandered around the slaves
She admonishes them. “I want to take my shower in peace, and John, you should have been in bed half an hour ago.
He must have fallen asleep quickly, because it is around 1 o’clock when he is woken up by the sound of small stones being thrown at his window. Sherlock rolls himself off his bed with a grunt and rips the long curtains open. With the bit of sunlight falling in, he can make out an impossibly handsome John Watson, who is standing in front of his house and waving his hand. Sherlock scrambles to open his window.
The Santa says, and there goes Sherlock’s last hope that he may still be undercover, “Welcome to my home!
Sherlock perks up a bit: “Of course you can.” This will probably keep him busy for about an hour. One less hour of staring at the wall and listening to Mycroft screaming at his weak internet connection.
His parents moved back to Sussex, weary with grief and John had moved into Sherlocks bedroom. He wanted them to wait, to give Sherlock time, but the detective didn’t want to hear anything about it. We waited long enough, he said and then kissed John breathlessly.
The fingers were small, but strong, and surprisingly warm despite the cold weather. The boy helped him back on his feet.
Sherlock snorts into John’s chest, he can not help it. The vision of that happening helps Sherlock to get a clearer head. John takes the gauze from Anderson and presses it on Sherlock’s eyebrow to stop the bleeding.

and later also a teacher, who taught John and Harriet how to read and write, to play chess and to speak Greek.
Sherlock’s hands are shaking, and he tugs them between their chests. His secret may be out, but he no longer has to hide.
is the main event leading up to it. After getting thrown out, I found a grimly and overpriced flat in London. I was… it is difficult to say, but you’ve seen how I was a few weeks ago.
A bookstore is a magical place. You wander in either with a specific purpose or for just for book browsing. The shelves, if white, brown or black, if old, expensive or new, are filled with hundreds of new worlds. Whether it is s snowing, raining or (less often in London) the sun is shining, a good bookshop will make you forget what is happening outside. So, when you are leaving a few minutes or even a few hours later, you will be blinking confused to the darkened sky. Hopefully, you will be clutching a bag in your hands, because leaving a
They make their way out of the airport, and Sherlock decides that their reunion was much more romantic than anything Love Actually could come up with.
The Room of Requirement opens the curtains to a newly made window, and the moonlight envelopes the couple on their bed.
John is on the other side, hunched over, panting. Sherlock deduces that the other teacher was awakened by
There is of course Mrs. Martha Hudson, the proud owner of the store, bookworm and baking enthusiast. After her return from Florida, about 30 years ago, she used the money she got from the divorce to buy the house (back then, central London was still somewhat affordable) and uses it for the store and the café, her flat and a flat above to rent it to tenants. She is in her mid-sixties, loves to dye her hair and gossip about the neighbours. She used to be a dancer and sometimes, during cleaning, you can still catch her showing off her exotic dancing. Most of the time in the store, she provides the customers with hot beverages, cookies, muffins and sometimes pizza. Mrs. Hudson loves to read cookbooks, especially the grand volume by Julia Child and also all the classics, favouring Jane Austen.
Sherlock answers, not wanting John to ever think less of himself. John blushes a bit, and Sherlock makes a mental note to do this more often from now on.

Sherlock wonders if John will still smile at him when he finds out he is a potential drugged monster, then disregards the thought. John will never find out, easy as that.
Mummy had joined them, and now all three were nearly shouting at each other about something Brexit-related. Apparently
Now, he has a problem. The handsome medical student with the short hair is slowly moving along the line, and it looks like that Molly will make him his drink, and that is unacceptable.
The curious eyes are still there. Greg is talking to a colleague, but he keeps looking at them. That’s fine, these are friendly eyes. Unfortunately, there is also Anderson, who somehow got his job back and is now running around, telling conspiracy theories. Worse, dozens of neighbours are standing around the police barrier. John is only waiting for someone to just climb over, people have been losing more and more respect for authorities nowadays. About all of them are filming the whole scene, maybe also livestreaming it on Twitter, YouTube, whatever. This is a good neighbourhood, so people are hungry for a spectacle, especially something involving someone as famous in London as Sherlock is. A few reporters have arrived too, and they are calling out questions to the policemen and paramedics walking around.
Sherlock laughs at John’s enthusiasm. They do another turn. After a few weeks of training, John is quite good at it. His favourite part is the moment when he gets to spin Sherlock around and catch a glimpse of his delightful smile. He did practice another move alone in his room (Harry helped too), and he cannot wait to surprise Sherlock with it.
"For one, you are not an internationally wanted assassin or a lying snake, but you are not a substitue either. We know he work, we know we can do it, and I believe in us. Also, I want the whole of London to know that you are
His captor had chosen the short drop for him. He would die slowly and in agony. The man stood on his tiptoes, caressed his cheeks and pressed his (disgusting) lips on Sherlocks. It felt revolting and made Sherlock shake more. This was the last thing he would feel and this monster would be the last person to touch him.
Then, of course, Mrs. Hudson. He went to Florida originally to find Victor Trevor, he wasn’t sure why, didn’t allow himself to think about this kind of sentiment (Sentiment is a weakness, Sherlock.). He saw her first a gas station, and the rest was history.
John says and kicks at a non-existing stone on the path. The two British wizards stand there in the forest on Halloween, not knowing what to do with their limbs.
Sherlock had come to the conclusion that kissing John was the best thing ever. A simple touch of their lips fired up a thousand fireworks. It was salvation and damnation all at once. He would be happy if only he got to kiss John Watson for the rest of his life.
Of course, Sherlock is so stupid! He should have made a poster or at least a sign too, John would have loved that. The doctor adores romantic gestures almost as much as Sherlock.
immediately after my healer training was finished. Finally, I felt like I belonged somewhere. We were all comrades together in the fight against the Dark Arts. For two years, everything fit into place. It all came crashing down one night. We were travelling through Scotland, searching for a criminal fugitive. The criminal surprised us, and my superior, James
The words just fell out of his mouth. What was about John that brought out all these conflicting feelings in him?
Sherlock puts his aching forehead on his table and tries to blend out the loud noises around them. He barely got any sleep the past nights, the cramps kept him awake.
Sherlock’s head hurts like a bullet had just entered it, but he nods anyway. Anything for John Watson.
John was standing a few steps away from Sherlock, unarmed. He and Mary looked like they were in a heated discussion.
’s man had driven her home, after the detective tried to overdose on the plane and the video on Moriarty was broadcast all over the country. Mary still had no idea who did that. Probably
“Jesus Christ. Some rich asshole pushed me away and I lost sight of you. I first reached the exit, believing it's the most logical point, but I was just about head back.
His determination changed when the sound came through the heavy door and into the dark chamber. It was Old Marley. His grey hair was bound in a thin ponytail, he wore tights and boots and the white dressing gown he died in. Thick bandages were wrapped around his head and chest. The chain he carried was wound around his waist and
John busies himself with sorting through his discarded food trail, before sitting on the bed. Sherlock’s body heat has a soothing effect on him. John wishes he can comfort Sherlock, but he doesn’t know if the other man would accept touches right now. Not after what happened.
Mary knows she can be short-sighted with her plans, but so far this one had gone well. She only needs new Human Shield now. Fortunately, her new protection is just running up the stairs.
“Turnips first, the rest later.” Sherlock says and starts sprinting, following John’s instructions (“Oi, don’t step on my flowers!”). John’s character, dressed in a doctor’s mask and wearing army trousers, is running behind. Just as they always do in the outside world.
Sherlock presses a combination of buttons and his character sends out a couple of flowers around his beaming head.
. The gladiator grabbed the slave, and they disappeared into the night, not caring for the bleeding out man. John knew he had done a serious crime, killing a citizen of Rome for threatening a slave was non-negotiable, murderer or not. The man should have been brought before a court, but Sherlock would have been dead
The Themes is right in front of them, and a few students are making bets on who is brave enough to jump into the dirty river. They all had a bit too much to drink at this point.
The Ghost of Christmas Past finally landed again and their surroundings were getting more clear. They were still in the orphanage, which now had more holes than roof.
“I could have been with you, at your side. Like we always were. Together. You wouldn’t have had to fight this alone.” John said, whispering now too.
“Don’t worry, it’s only a sedative. You can rest for a bit while I move you to a different location.“
Sherlock shouts over the crying students. The two fighting children are whisked apart by their classmates.
The mood still screamed more funeral than wedding for John, but whatever. This was just the way the English reacted on occasions like this and Sherlock wouldn’t like a too lively atmosphere. The ceremony was just a thing to get over it, he told John yesterday, before they parted. The fun would happen at the party after. As soon as
Paddington says happily. He has a very good feeling with Sherlock. At first appearance, he is a bit overwhelming and aloof, but his heart is kind. This man will help him find the marmalade thief better than Scotland Yard ever could. Sherlock turns on the tea chain and sits down the black chair.
The baby had to come out sooner or later sometime in January, and so Mary’s time was running out. One cold evening, John drove to Baker Street (always at the beg and call for the detective), and Mary could finally end this game.
It had only got colder over the last - hours? Days? Sherlock’s stomach had stopped grumbling and now he is suffering through cramps. He tries to curl into himself, but this movement just pulls at his forcefully stretched arms and make the gashes on his wrists rip open again. He sacks back against the wall and groans. The thirst is killing him. Even if he would be working on a case, he would have drunk something a long time ago. Most likely, John would have made him drink something, but John isn’t here right now (thank god for that), and maybe John would never do it again.
The next time he senses anything, he is shoved with a brutal trip to his back into a cold (damn it) closet. He gasps at the pain that is surging through his right wrist he landed on.
Before Sherlock has the chance to gather his strength to ask something, Mister Watson closes the door and Sherlock is left alone in the dark. The little boy wraps the thick blanket around him and wishes with his whole heart he were back at home, with his family sleeping next door, with a bed frame, a full fridge and his bumblebee toy.
John whispers in his ear as they approach the ambulance. “For now, I’d like to get you away as quickly as possible from this creepy Santa Claus.
Well, if Santa is correct, it will be better for John. Sure, the sight of his dead boyfriend of two months laying on the doorstep of Baker Street may be a shock shortly before Christmas, but afterwards… John can get a normal life, with the 1.4 children, a nice wife who is neither like Sherlock nor an assassin like Mary. Someone he deserves.
Of course, the festivity is not only in the Great Hall. The knight statues are tasked with patrolling every night and maybe to sneak up on a student or two. The figures in the paintings are visiting each other and singing weirdly scary rhymes to everyone who walks upon them.
Snape, who bullied every student he did not like, used discriminating slurs and joined the Dark Side. He may have acted as a spy, motivated by a crush in his teenager years, but he remained a fear of many students. His successor,
body double, Jeanette (he thinks that was her name) breaking up with John and John destroying Sherlock’s socks index. Not a perfect evening, by all means. At least they still lived together, although the mystery around Irene Adler weighted down on them. John now knows that neither Sherlock nor Irene were ever romantically interested in each other, but then he believed Sherlock to be heartbroken
Silence, John can hear Mr. Holmes voice in the background, then: “We have received a message from Mycroft’s office that he is involved with that ghastly incident, but nothing has arrived since then.
“Just go the left of the museum on the main island. Honestly, I thought we could spend some time together. I build a new park yesterday, and I can show you the fish I caught in the museum.”
Sherlock opened the door, and saw the most beautiful boy he had ever seen. It felt like being hit by a lightening bolt. It felt like staring directly into the sun, the boy appeared to be glowing. The world stopped turning for a second.
“John, please don’t.” He pleaded. “She is a highly-trained professional killer with contacts all over Europe. She has hidden weapons all over your house.”

“I’m here, Sherlock. I’m here, and you will be fine.” He said. Sherlock closed his eyes, a soft smile on his lips. John pressed his lips on Sherlock’s forehead.
He asks, and is shocked at how weak his voice already sounds. Sherlock tries to suppress a shiver. God, why did he had to throw him into a
, he stuttered and bend down to clean, but the boy had had the same idea and both of their heads crashed together.
Today was Saturday, and normally Sherlock would sleep in, but it was also the first of December. He and John had this little tradition where they would watch Hagrid bring in the giant Christmas Tree into the Great Hall, and later watch Flitwick decorate it.
stared at John, open-mouthed. The soldier was heavily breathing, then hurrying to the dead detective. He dropped down to his knees and rolled Sherlock’s body on his back. Greg was searching for his handcuffs when the detective began to cough and opened his eyes.
John spread one of his blankets over them both and blew the candle out. Sherlock was still lying curled together on the far side of the bed, facing the wall. John decided to spare him from any more unwanted touches today and closed his eyes. 'I hope he won’t try to throttle me in my sleep', was his last thought, before his eyes fell closed.
John frowned. A man, only two years younger than him, who didn’t have had sex already? He glanced back at the slave, whose face was red with shame, while dozens of men were openly leering at him.
god, he had not even uttered the vows, and he was already terrible at this! Mary really deserved better, so get it together Watson! John imagined Major James
is either on a very long holiday or writing a book, depending on the moment you decide to ask him. The work keeps his mind from other, more dangerous subjects, which is welcome to him. As a nice advantage, Mycroft will keep his curious nose out of Sherlock’s business as long as the younger Holmes is at Hogwarts.
pretty much in your school bags. What I will require from you is to work precisely, patiently, and most importantly, don’t ever drink anything without me saying you are allowed to.
“Your guess is as good as mine.” John shrugged and blew on his hot tea. “Maybe she wanted money for him.”
Sherlock is so far away in his mind that he does not concentrate enough, and promptly spills the hot, steaming water all over his hand.
“Your Majesty! Your trusted subjects believe that the Holmes have hurt our treaty. The hostage needs to be punished for the crimes of his family.”
At night, when he is laying in his bed (they haven’t shared a bed yet), John dreams of them twenty, thirty years in the future, with a small house and garden somewhere close to the sea, with bees in their backyard, a dog and a silver ring on Sherlock’s finger. This may be somewhat new to Sherlock, who never had to care (much) about money, but John is aware that his dreams cost a lot of money, and so he is driving to the clinic every day, instead of working cases. Well, they still do that together in the evenings, on John’s free days, on weekends, or whenever Sherlock needs him, which is always (John is pretty charmed at this).
Sherlock whimpered, both as the new feeling of weirdness and also because of a sudden wave of pain in his belly. John kissed his shoulderblades and whispered his name into his skin. They waited for a moment until Sherlock’s uneasiness faded, then John drove deeper into him, inch for inch. When Sherlock was fully stretched, the gladiator punded into him and the slave finally groaned in pleasure. It felt so good to have John inside him. He felt grounded, like he belonged somewhere. Thoughts of his elder brother and his dad were uncomfortably nagging on his mind. What would they say if they noticed him, as a slave, getting fucked by a Roman soldier?
“Sure.” Sherlock says and bites his lip in disappointment. The abrupt end of their conversation upsets him. It is after all not that late.
Mister Watson grumbles as they walk through the ground floor of the mansion. He points to a relatively clean looking cupboard: “This will be your room for a while.
Against the Dark Arts teacher has hung up a few posters with helpful commentaries on how to approach that dangerous situation. There is a big picture of a
Sir Walter sneers. They shove him into a metallic chair. Sherlock squirms against their iron grips, but they buckle him down with leather straps fast.
For many children in the United Kingdom, Santa Claus is a wonderful old man. He wears his big red and white coat, his hat, his dark boots, two friendly eyes and a long, white beard. He is waiting in front of the shop, reading stories on the Christmas Market, and on the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, he climbs down the chimney and places all their presents under the tree. During the month, parents use Santa Claus both as a warning and as a promise. They tell them to behave well, or they won’t get presents. If they are good children, do what they are told, make their homework and clean their room, they will receive their wishes. On Christmas Eve, millions of children go to bed and are looking forward to a visit from Santa Claus, the friendly gift bearer.
grasped his shoulders again and handed him a small leather purse, full of gold coins. He winked at John happily and disappeared somewhere in the crowd.
They dance for a few more seconds, and finally they play something slower. John can feel his big moment getting closer.
“At the start of each training, I want to do some warming-up with the kids before they climb on their brooms. Meaning, some running around, maybe a few push-ups, and I want to practice throwing and catching the balls of course.
Maybe now it’s time to panic. John flags a cab down and skims the article again, but there is no mention yet where they have brought the victims. He throws his phone on the seat next to him and tells the cab driver to just drive to the closest hospital as quick as possible. Traffic is horrific on a normal day at this time, but now it’s a single traffic jam at every corner. The radio is on and between speculations about the attack there are worrying news about diplomatic accidents all over the world.
“I have no comfort to give. I cannot stay here much longer, every second is torture. I can never rest and I can not stay anywhere.
„If the little one survives, maybe. But I am looking for a heir, and if Mycroft is the better candidate, I will only take him.“ answered Ernest and stood up. He beckoned the boy closer.
He says, the name sounding weird in his own mouth. It has been a while since he last introduced himself to someone new. Molly and Mrs. Hudson have known him for a while, after all.
"Of course. See, I don’t have as many assets as you. I will always want to kiss you, because you are the most beautiful boy in the universe, but what about me?“
He kisses John, just a quick kiss on the forehead, but John pulls him closer, and they kiss for a long time.
kept it in a bucket under his own desk. John Watson knew he would get fired if he requested more coal, and so he tried to warm himself with his sole candle.
The virus had creeped up to Sherlock like a clever -and very deadly — serial killer. When the first cases of
If you are interested in more Modern Royal stories, I also wrote a fanfiction about John marrying Prince Sherlock.
John growls, then turning to Sherlock: “I try to be as gentle as possible, please tell me if I’m hurting you.
does not know that John knows that Mary is definitely not pregnant. Maybe that secret will help John.
Somehow, time passes. Sherlock doesn’t know if it’s slow or fast. Of course, there has to be a sunrise and a sunset outside every day, but there is no way to be sure.
For these hours in the waiting room the two men were as close as never before, in their shared waiting for good news. The night never seemed to end, but Sherlock survived. Another miracle. Greg drove home in the early morning, thinking that he understood John Watson now a little better.
John gave her a short kiss and smiled at her. Then his hand went inside his coat, found something and stabbed a needle into Mary's neck. Her sufficient grin was gone, replaced by pure shock.
„It is unfair that you have shown me this! I was only a child too, and it was either this or me staying at the orphanage too! What was I supposed to do?“
Thankfully, nobody protests, and the students are slowly trickling out of his room. Sherlock gathers his work together and climbs up the stairs to his room. A few kids wish him a good weekend, but he barely hears them over the ringing sound in his ears.
She says and pulls up Sherlock’s arm. The blood around the letters is sticky and dry. The arm looks mangled, but the letters are still easy to read. Sherlock moves a bit.
John says, his tongue licking his lips while staring at the fighting buttons on his chest. Sherlock manages to stammer
Behind it, he found more moving boxes. He groaned, but decided to work on nonetheless. John threw away one box after the next, not really caring at this point, and he was already down to the last box when he noticed what had been hidden behind it.
The detective was even more pale than usual, his face gaunt and cheeks hollow, lips bloodless. Someone had shaved his unruly curls to a short, prison-like hairstyle. There was a yellow bruise under his cheekbone and a deep cut on his upper lip. Both eyes were sluggishly held open by pure will, rolling around the room until finally stopping on John. Sherlock always looked at the doctor like he was the only person in the room, the only important noteworthy person on this planet, and today was no different.
Sherlock’s gaze is hiding under his long eyelashes, but he looks up when John presses a kiss on his land, like a gentleman would do to his lady.
She doesn’t sound too thrilled (still angry about him arriving late then), but Sherlock quickly stands up and bows his head. He is secretly pleased to hear that the students are clapping and some are even cheering. Maybe he isn’t so bad at his job after all?
Gladstone did not really enjoy the last couple of days. Sure, it is always wonderful when Mrs Hudson gives him special treats, Molly cuddles with him on the sofa and
John let go of Mary’s hands and turned around to face Sherlock. If the man had been pale, now he was ghost-like. The detective was shaking all over, his perfect lips formed into a shocked round form.
Mary held Mycroft in a sort of embrace, her small gun pushed to the back of his head. His brother was kneeling on the ground and Sherlock stood before them, feeling so damn helpless. He was unarmed, because he didn’t expectMycroftt to fall like this. They weren’t close since their childhood, always fighting and competing against each other, but a small part of Sherlock always knew that his big brother would always have his back. Whenever he got into trouble, he relied onMycroftt to get him out of it, and Mycroft always had. Now Mary was here, grinning at both of them, wagging her eyebrows. She was enjoying this. Killing them both was going to be her greatest triumph, her golden medal.
The Forbidden Forest lies in front of them. No light from the sky shines through it, and it is eerily quiet.
believes that Mary has already killed Sherlock, and he doesn’t want to see his brothers body. John bites his lips and hits the gas pedal. He starts praying for another miracle.
(3) Had she worked for/with Moriarty, had she acted alone or was she part of a bigger criminal network?
It will never be me, Sherlock realizes with a sudden clarity. He will never choose me. I blew it by jumping from that bloody roof and nothing has ever been the same.
Mary shot Mycroft in the heart. John shot Mary in the leg. The circle is complete and John held him for hours to save him from falling apart.
Sherlock sprints down the hill, but a spell of dizziness hits him and his knees give in. He falls down hard on his hands, a surge of sudden pain radiating through his wrist. Sherlock rolls a few more meters before he can stop himself.
He closes the curtains with his wand and throws the blanket over him. Tomorrow, dozens of students will expect him to be healthy, interesting and engaging, and Sherlock needs to sleep for that, no matter what he would prefer.
John orders angrily, and Sherlock notices how much he likes hearing him speak with his authoritative voice.
John is there now. He and Mary are screaming at each other, but all Sherlock can fathom is Mycrofts eyes on his and his smile.
"You were tortured for four days in Serbia. They chained you up, beat you, deprived you of sleep. And yet, you didn't tell them anything. You came back to your friends."
The lack of sleep, the stress and his strained friendship with John has strained his patience and tolerance for his students.
He is not expected to govern it alone, though. As a crown prince, he has to marry whoever his parents and their advisors choose. In this case, John counts himself as the luckiest man in the whole of Scotland.
Holmes was lying on the plush red carpet in his private office, eyes open, unseeing. A red line of blood was still flowing from a dark hole in his forehead. Lestrade stares at the wound. It was a clear head shot, like an execution where the murderer wanted to look in his victim’s eyes before they killed him.
“I may not talk for days and I play the violin when I’m thinking. Possible roommates should know the worst of each other.
John says and starts unwrapping the man. His skin is cold, but he looks otherwise unharmed. How did the man land into the Themes, naked? Did he get got into the net on his journey?
They shouldn’t have waited. When will they ever learn their lesson? Danger was looming everywhere and fate was never kind. John would have made Sherlocks first time spectacular. He would have opened him, finger for finger, carefully, reassuringly, and then he would have entered him and they would have come together in domestic bliss. John would have cleaned them both up and they would have cuddled and probably fight for the blanket. Maybe this vision was a bit too perfect, but everything else would have been better than this reality Sherlock was slowly waking up to.
Sherlock asks to get away from answering. Having the Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts on their side would certainly help.
happened to be so expensive, he feared she would throttle him in sleep. John mused if her extreme confidence made her so attractive.
Sherlock was crying now, tears were running down his face. The once so proud man dropped to his knees and folded his hands into a prayer. Lestrade stood by, watching helplessly. What was John doing and why was no one coming to fix all of this!
Sherlock turns off the small lamp on his table, snuggles deeper into his bed and tries not to think about how tomorrow will be exactly as it was today.
Sherlock turns on his side and buries his head in the pillows. Now, John even feels the duty to check up on Sherlock, as if the former healer has not more things to worry about.
Yes, he had done that. He came back from two years away and this woman had mended John Watson together. She made him smile and he loved her. So how could he hate her or try to take John away from her? Loving John was so easy and being loved by him in return was the greatest gift he could imagine. Sherlock truly believed that Mary had loved (loves) John, because how could she not? But her love was not good. John had called it a selfish form of love and Sherlock agreed with him.
There was Victor Trevor, his first and for a long time only friend, until he moved with his family to America. There was Sebastian Wilkes and his friends, taunting him at every corner in university.
John spent the next hour watching slave auctions in the Septa, where the most popular slaves were sold. A woman with long brown hair and dark eyelashes was sold for thrice the coins John had received from
“It may be unexpected, but I couldn’t be happier. I have you right here with me. It’s enough. What about you?
Nevertheless, John persuaded him (with a nice smile, not that Sherlock can say no to him) to join him and a few members of Scotland Yard at a
"I had to throw it all out to make room for the gingerbread.“ Sherlock explains, as if that’s a perfectly normal sentence you hear everyday. The detective is sitting at their kitchen table, drinking his tea.
The seller handed John the keys to the chains and a leash. He clipped the other end to the iron collar of his slaves and directed the stumbling man from the platform.
Mycrofts life had always been his work, but surely this couldn’t be it, right? How could you be on this earth for 45 years and not impact more people?
). They are going to miss their final exam in Divination, but Moriarty does not appear to care much about that.
Sherlock rolls on his back and stares at the dozens of papers. His student will expect their graded work back next Wednesday. They want to know how much more they will need to study. They will be disappointed if he doesn’t grade them.
It ended, but at what cost? They will visit another gravestone this year, with the difference that this one isn’t empty.
John gently helps him on the narrow hospital bed, and they both throw their arms around each other. Sherlock buries his head into John’s neck, and finally the surrounding noises subdue a little.
He was massaging Sherlock’s face when the detective’s eyes suddenly opened. For a long, long-expected moment, the two reunited friends could only look at each other. Sherlock’s lips moved, and John had to come closer to understand what he was whispering.
She ignores his question, although Sherlock would have liked an explanation. Does she think John is interested in him?
Sherlock stutters and quickly puts the note into his old black purse, before another accident can occur.
Finally, done with the restraint, John decided to not wake up the detective and instead just bring him into a nicer environment. He slipped one arm under Sherlock’s bony knees and another around his back. John expected much more difficulty, but the detective felt as light as a feather. John congratulated himself on keeping up with his jogging and arm training, and then carried the detective out of his prison.
Sherlock was about to leave again when suddenly a man loomed behind him. A meaty hand landed on his shoulder and pinned him to the wall. The slave John had fought against in the morning was now before him, a sleazy smile on his face.
“Try not to attack her, John. Sadly, we still need her in one piece.” Mycroft warned him, and John stepped in.
The dinner for their wedding is already taking way too long. He had tried to eat something after the beginning, but the stress is making his stomach cramp. He doesn’t want to throw up on his new husband.
John laughs and Sherlock hides his smile behind his glass. John did not appear to be someone who often smiles, and Sherlock has made him laugh several times now!
He grabbed his waist and pushed him against the wall. Sherlock tried to push him away, but unfortunately the training had already been effective. The man overpowered him easily.
I have been severely neglected these short stories this week and am now trying to write at least 2-3 more stories this month, so naturally I will skip a few prompts.
had visited John at his insulae and told him about the fourth poisoned victim they had found near the Colosseum that night. When he left, Sherlock suddenly developed an interest in that case, he even showed a morbid fascination and asked John if they could go the crime scene. Everything was better than the crying slave he had seen the night before, and with that reasoning the two men found themselves on a spectacular chase through Rome, a very fancy dinner and a missing Sherlock. John had been actually sick with worry, and he told himself it was because of the lost fortune he spent on him, but to be honest, he had learned to care fast about his slave. John managed to find him and the murderer through a series of cleverly dropped clues by Sherlock. The future victim and the predator were engaged in a play of
Right, Christmas. Sherlock feels a surge of panic. Molly is knitting a personal gift for her boyfriend, and what is Sherlock doing? Not concentrating on his boyfriend’s rugby game, that’s for sure.
“Obviously, the criminals didn’t like that, and they soon started to figure out who I was. On my last stop in Serbia, they captured me.” The detective shuddered. John reacted instinctively and scooted closer to Sherlock. Their shoulders brushed together, and Sherlock threw John a look of gratitude.
The detective slowly shakes his head, the panic in his stomach rising. Stupid, stupid, stupid. He assumed she needed help, and John obviously still loves her he is her husband and right now at probably at Baker Street, sleeping. The last two weeks have been emotionally and psychically exhausting, although John has taken the news of the not-existing baby rather well. After a glass of scotch, John admitted to feeling relieved. Sherlock had only nodded. He didn’t want to say it out loud, but he is glad that he won’t have to ban his experiments from his fridge and make the flat baby-proof (he would have done it of course, and gladly, but it is so much easier this way).
Ten years later, Sherlock first injected heroin into his veins. He still managed to graduate schools with good grades, thanks to his intelligence, but somehow, finding a job and his own flat ended up being not as important as the drugs.
’s corpse was laying in the next room, the unconscious Mary was a few feet away from the happy couple.
Now, it’s time for their sixth Christmas, and John is determined to finally make it a good one, for both of them. A lot has happened in the last 12 months. The baby is now safe at David’s, and they both are very happy with the arrangement. David had sent John a photo of them in July. John had moved back to Baker Street, and soon into Sherlock’s bedroom as well.
Sherlock desperately wants him too. He wants to be kissed by John, because that one, short, interrupted time was definitely not enough. Seven years of Hogwarts and the eight years after it, he never experienced any of these feelings he is having now. But then, he has met John only just now. This must be what thousand of books, films, and his parents always described.

). John ended the call with the promise to take care off their remaining son, and let them mourn in peace. There is the guilty feeling again, of being grateful that the older child died, and not the younger.
John rubbed his hand over his aching face and groaned. Any wish he may have harboured about their relationship died when he found Sherlock chained up in her basement. However, this would also hopefully give them answers.
Sherlock watches John sprint through the empty street and wonders how the earth could create something as perfect as his boyfriend. Probably a compensation for giving him Mycroft as his big brother.
She says in her best authoritative voice, and her two children nod quickly before slipping under their covers. Mrs. Watson shuts their door carefully and wonders if a glass of wine will be worth the headache tomorrow.
. He had then stepped close to the older Holmes, had grabbed his collar (John was short, but strong) (Sherlock liked him working out) and told him to keep his noise out of their relationship, give Sherlock some fresh air and actually leave him in peace for a bit. The man was angry, but secretly impressed. They had a similar talk after the engagement, and another one this morning.
Mycroft asks. Well, he never really asks because he knows everything thanks to his security cameras anyway. He only does it to drive up Sherlock’s nerves immediately.
A few numbers are called, but the event quickly runs out of steam. Finally, the auctioneer knocks on wood and declares Sherlock as: “SOLD! For

cup? Or him, wearing the Healer uniform? A sober Harry? Or maybe even… John stops his thinking process. Surely no mirror can look that deeply into his heart.
Sherlock notices a few tears appearing in John’s eyes and kisses him gently on the mouth. John kisses back enthusiastingly, but soon stops.
“That’s very kind of you, but I believe a good nights rest would help me much better than any Ghost ever could!
Mary sank back into the chair. She looked defeated: “Moriarty told me to keep an eye on you, in case Sherlock tried to do something stupid. Like faking his death, for example. I studied you, and after I while, I decided to get closer, in case you knew something.”
had to admit there were similarities. “Our friendship was not dangered by evil nurses, and we always had enough coal in our fireplace, and enough food in our stomach.
Sherlock whispers. They spent another few minutes in the cooling bathtub, then get out and dry themselves.
‘ to mention it. Nevertheless, he was here now and needed to be as prepared as possible. Gregor was adamant that the man would at least earn him back the money he cost, and asked John to train him. John didn’t have the heart to protest, given the fact that he had been rather busy the past weeks.
Mrs. Hudson announces. “We need groups of two, and someone who reads the questions out loud and who checks if everyone is playing fairly. Absolutely no cheating allowed, so please put your phones into this box.
Mary loads her guns with steady hands. One foolish message was all it took to trick Sherlock Holmes once again. He still believes that she wants to return to John and that he can save her from troubles.

who taught John everything about medicine and it was also him who gifted John his first sword. He didn’t remember much from his past life and his parents, only pale faces, but Harriet told him that they were British people, who had migrated to the rural area around Rome. Harriet decided to be called 'Harry' when she was 9, and John, being the younger one, didn't dare to refuse.
“Oh, that will come quite naturally. When we are searching for the first student who is lost at night in the Forbidden Forest, you will have entirely forgotten about it. You are not haunted by danger, you miss it.
He knows that many people are not happy with him being here. Sherlock is the enemy, and cannot be trusted with anything. Sherlock shivers in horror as he remembers the humiliating procedure he had to endure only hours before, after he had just arrived from the long journey. An old man had ordered him to undress, lay down on the table and pull his legs up so that the doctor could test if his virginity was intact. The mere act had only taken a few minutes, but as soon as the doctor limped away happily, Sherlock had retched behind the door. The man’s touch was invasive and disgusting and the doctor had clearly enjoyed Sherlock’s apparent discomfort. Sherlock hopes his newly-wed husband would be more gentle.
“Then tell me.” John demanded, already fed-up with this. He wanted to go back to Sherlock and finally get some sleep, god-damn it.
, which Sherlock realizes now was a stupid mistake made by his foolish father). His only chance of getting back home was his older and only brother Mycroft, the heir to the throne. Maybe he would not give Sherlock away so easily and try to bring him back. Of course for that, their father had to die.
Mrs. Hudson welcomes him with a kind smile, and Paddington climbs up the stairs. Music is coming from the upper rooms, a violin solo.
Mike Stamford says, drawing groans all over the room. “I know, not a very popular category, but we save the better categories for last.
He sounded so angry, even Mary looked impressed for a moment. His eyes were glaring at Sherlock, and he smirked in a terrifying way. Sherlock shrank a step back.
The other three help Greg lay the figure on the stones. It’s a tall, pale man, approximately their age, with dark hair. He is naked except a long fishing net that is tightly wrapped around him. John is the first to act. He searches for a pulse and let's out a long sigh of relief.
He hurries back to the counter and ignores Molly’s inquiries about his hand. Sherlock quickly finishes up John’s tea, and then pulls out the fresh chocolate cake as a present for John’s quick action.
Mary was waiting for John, cuffed to the table in the interrogation room. John had to take the elevator down to meet her, and it all reminded him of James Bond films.
“Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.” John said and rubbed his head nervously. Lestrade glanced at them and closed the kitchen door for some privacy.
His enemy was wearing a peacock plumbed crest and was armed with a heavy net and a sharp trident. John always thought such extravagant armor was ridiculous and had chosen his usual leather protection for his chest, his arms and his legs. Both of them wore helmets. It was unusual that someone fought without a shield, but John’s fighting style was better without it. That way he was able to move much faster. He knew he had to be careful that the net didn’t catch him, otherwise his opponent would simply stab him to death.
“He speaks and writes multiple languages, Latin, English, Greek, Arabic, you name it! He also plays the Lyra perfectly and memorizes new information very quickly. You can use him as a teacher for your children!
The wife pressed his hand reassuringly: “Don’t blame yourself darling. You tried to do everything you could.
The man purrs. Sherlock wonders if the serial killer is trying to be funny. Sherlock has not been able to take a breath in what feels like ages.
“I am, but I don’t take much interest in what I learn. Most other people are barely scraping my vision. My passions lie elsewhere.
I also have watched Season 4 only on time, on the day they aired (and actually stopped watching TFP after five minutes), so please forgive any mistakes. Sherlock is just very drugged.
Sherlock asks softly, and John doesn’t pretend to try to control his emotions. He gulps, and looks at the kissing Sherlock in the Mirror and the gangly teenager who is right next to him.
Somewhere between a sunset and a sunrise or maybe between a sunrise and a sunset, the heavy metal door flies open with a loud bang. At first, Sherlock is not sure if the person in front of him is a friend or the enemy, but the person wears a warm jumper under his
"I broke up with Mary when I finally noticed what nasty character lies behind her smiling persona. I also ended our relationship because I stopped being a coward and understood what I really wanted all along.“ He plays with one of Sherlock’s soft curls. „It’s you, it’s always you, and no Sarah, Janette, Kara, Lina or Mary could ever compete with you.“
He was ratcheting his neck back more than he seemed to recall usually having to. Sherlock hadn't grown, had he? Dear God, what a wretched thought - like the taller man needed more ammunition to loom menacingly over John's smaller body. His gaze finally reached Sherlock's dark brown eyes and stopped.
“C'mon, Sherlock. Get in here and help me,” John chided, the irritation level in his voice rising somewhat.
“Yes, John. You put it that way then, yes. I'm glad you came to this conclusion, however you did,” Sherlock shyly leaned into John and they met halfway, lips pressing warmly into each other.
“Wait. You must be Jo- uhm, Dr. Watson's flatmate, yeah? Sherlock? I've heard him talk about you. I'd recognize the coat just from his description. He says you hate the summer when you can't wear it. It really DOES suit you though. Quite a handsome picture.” Hamish flicked an appreciation to the line of the coat and to what could be seen under it. He speculatively dragged his gaze back up to the upturned collar and pale neck. He grinned slyly at Sherlock's dangerously arched eyebrow, acknowledging that he knew that Sherlock was aware of what he had just done.
John offered the bag to Sherlock, who immediately started rummaging through the contents. John then took the opportunity of the brief distraction to wander off into the kitchen to put kettle on. The rustling bag sounds abruptly stopped in the sitting room and alarm bells went off in the military man's head. Silence was usually not  such a golden thing in 221B. He knew this MUCH too well.  He craned his neck to see if he could spot the cause of the lack of noise on Sherlock’s part. The detective had abandoned the bag carelessly at his feet and was carefully scrutinizing a folded slip of white paper that he had discovered inside.
Using the leverage in his legs and his hands on John's arse, Sherlock managed to switch their positions so now he was the one pressing down on John, nothing between them except for the flimsy material of his pajamas and the hardness of both of their now aching erections.
?, Sherlock. I'm really not feeling all that well right now, just tell me,“ John weakly began, as he looked up at him further.
That was all he remembered until he opened his eyes to the uncomfortable brightness that was hitting his face. It was morning light coming through the windows. John had slumped down in the night, resting his head on the arm of the sofa and Sherlock was now draped halfway on top of him, his head no longer in John's lap, but on his chest, with one of his long arms flung across it. He then became very aware that both of John's arms were wrapped around his own torso. Startled at this realization, Sherlock started to pull himself away from John's body, only to feel John tighten his grip on him in his sleep. Sherlock, after an anxious moment, relaxed his long frame back into the sleeping man's embrace. He was much too comfortable and enjoying the feel of this, so he closed his eyes and took in a deep lungful of morning sunshine and the delightful smell of John's skin wafting up to fill his nose and his thoughts. After a good half an hour, John begin to stir and they both looked a bit flushed as they peeled off of each other slowly, mumbled morning greetings and then set off in opposite directions in the flat - John to the bathroom for a shower and Sherlock to his microscope, just to clear his head a bit.
“I've been home for about an hour now, not that you noticed,” John started techily. Almost out of habit, he lifted his body up, slowly plodded into the kitchen, and started the kettle. Tea had always been John's remedy of choice for anything unsettling. He absently set out two mugs and went to the business of brewing tea for the both of them.
Sherlock stalked reluctantly into the kitchen. He pulled the boxes from the bags and peeked into everything more for his own edification than to be actually helpful. Angelo had tucked in a package of warm focaccia in a bag all on its own. Sherlock eagerly ripped it open and the piney, garlicky smell enveloped the kitchen.
Sherlock tried his hand at looking remorseful and contrite. Sarah wasn't quite biting yet and the annoying Hamish was still standing there curiously. Pity he wasn't selling this to him. He clearly could have told the naive man any tired story and he would have been taken in.
Up at the front desk, Blondie and Hamish were chatting. There wasn't much to do this early in the morning usually. They both heard the ruckus in John's room over the phone's speaker and looked at each other in horror.
“That my line, you know. S'ok. I’ve passed out happily so you can have it…” John trailed off weakly. He lifted ducked his chin and kissed Sherlock’s shoulder tenderly.
“So glad you have caught up, John,” Sherlock gave him a scathing glace while rolling his eyes heavenward.
John's head snapped up rigidly. He hastily scanned the room for his flatmate which he was just now realizing, was no longer in said  room. He replayed the last five minutes quickly in his head. He had basically pushed himself inches from Sherlock, stared into his eyes, and then, oh
Sherlock burrowed deeper into John's neck and closed his eyes. Sleep didn't come to him as quickly. He almost fought the heavy sensation threatening to engulf him for fear he might wake up, discover this was all a cruel dream, and John would be gone from his arms. He chided himself for such feeble imaginings. John was really here. Of his own volition.
“You got me there. I just thought the old gal was playing hard to get when she wouldn't let you into her room. Who knew it was because she was hoarding fuzz balls on the sly. That orange one did NOT like you. Stupid cat.”
Sherlock feigned appreciation. “I know where -  Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Please do,” he caught himself and allowed Hamish to lead him back to the staff kitchen area.
Hamish, as casually as he could, ambled into the kitchen after he had been listening at the slightly opened door while Sherlock and Sarah were discussing the day's events. He was admittedly puzzled at catching Sarah telling John's flatmate about his dinner plans for the evening and his intentions.
“Yes, um, yes. John Watson.” He stumbled back a bit breathlessly and automatically stuck out his hand to shake the long fingered hand that was placed firmly into his grasp.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose in consternation. This really wasn't going how he had hypothesized. John was being entirely too agreeable and he had a number of important, salient points to bring up in his defence.
I attempted to include a picture of "Not Sherlock", but alas, technology refused to cooperate fully. Forgive me. A quick Google search of "Eliot Waugh" can save the day. It's worth the look to see how John got his wires crossed. Rrroww...
Sherlock chuckled darkly as he made his way back up towards John's needy mouth. He paused a moment and rested their foreheads together.
The younger man continued, breath hitching a bit as he locked his gaze on John's again. “She didn't write all that. It was just an explanation. It makes sense now John. I wrote this note. The one that I'm holding right now. Tell me if I'm saying it properly.”
John changed his clothes for bed, all the while pondering distractedly about the older woman and Sherlock's reaction to her. He WAS a tad overprotective, wasn't he? John smiled to himself. Kind of nice, actually, though he could hardly blame Sherlock for seeing potential threats lurking everywhere when it came to the two of them. He got into bed, eyes growing heavy, barely aware that he was picturing the two of them sitting on the sofa tonight, pressed tightly together, Sherlock working manically on the laptop and John carelessly stroking his fingers contentedly along the subtly muscled top of Sherlock's thigh. A smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he drifted into sleep.
He dragged the tip of his tongue across them, then nipped the jaw, and dove underneath to taste the thin, fair skin at the apex of that long, elegant throat.
“Yep. Yours are much plusher. Why didn't I see that right away?” John wrinkled his brow and looked insulted.
Sherlock opened his eyes from his thinking pose and seemed a bit surprised at John's presence in the flat.
After some time, Sherlock became abruptly aware of a cool sensation on his leg as John got up from the sofa and announced that it was his bedtime. Sherlock frowned in consternation. Their legs had been side by side - was it the lack of warmth now? No. He recalled that John had touched the top of his leg as he had been working while the other man watched repeats of that ridiculous car show that he loved. Had John left his hand on Sherlock's leg the whole time? Strangely, the leg in question began to tingle a bit with that thought. He had been aware of the placement of the hand while using the laptop, but he did not find it objectionable. How unlike himself. The loss of the extra warmth John's palm had provided now felt empty and almost sharp- like it should just BE there. Sherlock shook his head, as if to physically clear it. “Transport,” he snorted with derision.
John nearly fell over backwards onto his arse in his panic to back-peddle the fuck away from the increasingly vocal man writhing on the sofa. He tossed the blanket in Sherlock's general direction and hoped it made it onto his body and concealed it in some capacity. He hoofed it out of the sitting room, up the stairs to his room where he closed the door hastily behind him and threw his back against it trying make himself breathe normally again.
Sherlock knew she was not being entirely serious, but there was a bit of truth in her words. He felt as though he would honor them, if she ever asked for some inexplicable reason.
Sherlock felt he deserved some sort of reward for NOT rolling his eyes and spewing out the most embarrassing deductions he could muster at the nurse as they stood, still in the middle of the hallway.
“I couldn't help but notice the miniature placemat that is now on my chair. What the bloody hell did you do to my blanket??”
Sherlock had been stymied at the door of the bakery. He couldn't enter without being completely visible to most of the patrons inside and was unfortunately wearing very recognizable outerwear that his quarry would immediately identify. He settled for standing by the propped open door, pretending to text on his phone before entering the cafe. He watched John's broad back at the bakery case then as he went deeper in the cafe to the back bar where he approached a seated man with a Burberry trenchcoat with what looked to be scrubs underneath. A bizarre combination. Sherlock watched with his head turned halfway towards the interior, so it was just a portion of his profile he was risking. John was in profile as well, so Sherlock was able to read the words from his lips as he greeted the seated man.
Sherlock opened his eyes and drunkenly focused on John's perilously darkened pupils. He slowly let his mouth furl into an evil smirk, dangerously akin to the Grinch after he had stolen the last can of Who Hash.
“Who even knows if what he told you was true, he could have just said anything to have you keep plying him with your oh, so inappropriate attention!”
“Yes,” Vida continued. “Easy to germinate, but requires meticulous hand pollination and precise measured watering to set fruits and then to have them mature and ripen. Insects and other pests can destroy an entire grove. But the palm will faithfully produce fruit and shade and life for many, many years with the proper conditions. You hold that seed in your hand, Mr. Holmes. Think of it as a heart. THE heart. The caretaker must be very passionate and vigilant about his date grove. Tend it wisely.
John with his soft jumpers and marmalade and that pervasive woodsy and citrus scented shampoo from Boots that he bought in bulk whenever it went on offer.
They had both started to gravitate to the sofa in the evenings. Sherlock experimentally draped his legs across John's in a seemingly careless fashion as they read or watched a program. Seemingly careless at least until John started to caress the feet that were now nestled in his lap. The first time it happened, Sherlock sharply jerked his head towards John as he registered the sensation of fingers slowly inching their way along the sensitive skin of the dorsal and plantar aspects of his feet. John's attention was still on the television screen. Was he even noticing what he was doing? It felt nice, he allowed himself to consider. This continued on for a few nights until Sherlock decided further experimentation was in order. That evening, John sat on the sofa first. Sherlock carefully sauntered over to join him and instead of placing his feet across John's legs, he timidly- just for a moment - met John's inquiring gaze and then sat the opposite way.  He placed his head in John's lap facing into the room, grabbed the remote and picked something hastily at random. He both heard and felt John's body stiffen and suck in a startled breath. The detective held his own breath, stilled and after a few glacially slow moments, he felt John’s body relax and his fingers tentatively slide into his hair. Sherlock closed his eyes and blew out a long, heavy puff of air. The fingers felt even better on his scalp than they had on his feet. They eased their way through his luxurious locks, stroking them languidly and in an almost sensual fashion. Without his permission, Sherlock's mouth let out a contented sigh and his head furrowed deeper into the warmth of John's lap. He was faintly aware of the low, husky chuckle that drifted down to his ears as he grew more and more content and comfortable.
“Why do none of my clothes fit, you utter arse?? And why is Mrs. Hudson giving you thread?? What the hell are you on about THIS time? You’d better make this right, damn you!”
“Hi, Sarah! So sorry to disturb you. I know John is busy now and I could use your assistance. I rather, erm,
“تاسو ستاسو په لاس کې د زړه وکړي. د اوبو او ميلان لري او د خپل ځان د دا پروا او مينه به ستاسو د ميوه وي.”
Sherlock snapped back to attention. “Dr. Watson stated that your grandmother was some sort of healer in her village when she was young. Why would she seek medical attention from a western doctor then and more importantly, why one very specific doctor quite a distance from her home?” Sherlock countered Vida acilly.
His knee ran into the coffee table - that was going to bruise. His eyes reluctantly were adjusting to the darkness as he moved forward. The amorphous shape on the sofa was indeed Sherlock who seemed to be sleeping fitfully.
John patiently waited. He trailed his fingers in light circles over Sherlock's pectorals.  Privately he was sweating bullets. He desperately wanted Sherlock to say yes to pressing themselves together and rutting and tasting themselves into oblivion, but he still wanted Sherlock to know that this MEANT something to him. And he SO very much wanted it to mean the same thing to Sherlock.
John tore himself away and stuck his left palm into the path of Sherlock’s ridiculously kiss-swollen lips.
to fathom.” He sent his eyebrows into his fringe with a chuckle at that. “I am unbelievably happy to finally start this “US” thing. I'm just so completely knackered and I know you must be too. Come sleep. If that's ok.”
“Did you do the seed is a heart bit?” the older woman pressed. “It is always effective. People love a melodramatic image to set their teeth into.”
John reached out to spin the infuriating interloper around by the shoulder, grabbed his shirt by the front to shake him a bit before he booted him out. The long body straightened suddenly and pivoted right into John's chest, only stopped by John's grip on the vee of the scrub top. John huffed out an impatient breath of frustration and looked up. Pale skin, sinfully long neck, yeah, yeah. Then looked up some more.
As if conjured out of thin air, The sound of John's footsteps on the stairs rose up into the flat and the man himself burst into the sitting room.
Upon searching the Mr. White's bedroom, Sherlock had discovered the man was a collector of vintage scientific laboratory equipment and was an obsessively clean germaphobe. The first he could understand. The second is what could have possibly  killed him. While Sherlock was caught up in a moment of covetousness at the expanse of glittery glassware, John had wandered over to the bedside table where vase of garden flowers was arranged prettily. The doctor absently swiped at the table which was covered in a fine layer of dropped pollen. Sherlock, drawn to the sudden movement, saw the evidence of a previous hand through the messy yellow particles on the dark table, the contents of the vase itself, and immediately pounced on John, ripping his shirt up to cover his nose.
Hamish heard the escalating, shrill, unreasonable complaints of the patient. John was trying to walk him out of his office, into the more open area of the hallway. The army doctor was hoping Mr. Chamberlain would feel less threatened in the larger space and that the police would be in a better position to escort him out from there.
Sherlock breezed over to her and clasped her arm in a friendly manner. She startled for a moment before Sherlock hurriedly smiled his calculated, “Just relax, I'm a harmless, toothless old crocodile,” smile at her.
Sherlock then felt another hand rest gently on his rib cage. He twisted his head slightly up towards John and was met with a sleepy half-lidded gaze from the doctor's deep blue eyes. Sherlock smiled at the soft expression and shuddering slightly, slipped his head back down into John's lap.
“Ah. Good. Well, good night then. *Ahem*.” Sherlock blurted out rapidly as he edged his way in an almost hesitant manner towards his bedroom.
He marched downstairs and belligerently planted himself beside Sherlock's lounging form there on the sofa.
“I needed a fine filtration mechanism to separate some sensitive particulate I am working with. The fine metal sieve I would have normally employed was unfortunately, unavailable.”
“Go ahead and have a seat,” she simpered. “The doc should be with you in a bit. It's been a bit mental today, might be a little longer than usual.”
Sherlock frowned at the retreating back of his flatmate. This morning was proving to be most unusual.
Sarah knew about hostage situations first hand. She wasn't going to let herself feel as out of control as she had then.
John had suddenly been sitting there too; He handed him a cup of the citrusy, floral brew and smiled softly at him.
John lifted the beautiful bowed head with his hand, just as Sherlock had done to him in the restaurant.
Mr. Chamberlain listened for a brief moment,  took that deep breath, and then lunged at John with the sharp blade.
like this,” he huskily returned, easing his hands down John's chest to caress the skin of his pectorals, one smooth, the other rough from scar tissue. “I love the sounds you make when I touch you.
Sudden peripheral awareness flooded his overtaxed senses. John was, in an uncoordinated fashion, trying to peel the rogue bottoms and from his body. The sound of ripping fabric filled the air and finally, Sherlock was divested of the vexing clothes and John's hands were pressing harshly against his hips and groping his bare arse.
. One that rarely fell from the detective's mouth, followed by his own name, did it for irrevocably for John. He arched and every muscle in his body tightened. He hastily wet his other hand and pumped the two of them with both hands as Sherlock raised to meet him with an uncoordinated thrust of his hips.
He fixed his eyes on Sherlock, who seemed to be unsure as where to settle in the room. Knowing his flatmate, he was probably less concerned about John than aggrieved that he had fallen asleep where Sherlock wanted to stretch out and think. Nope. Not happening.
“So, then. Erm. Tell me more about yourself then. What's an American nurse doing in a NHS clinic in Central London?” John was pleased he got back on track again and his head out of thoughts of Sherlock. It seemed the man filtered his way through John's existence like osmosis. Ever pervasive and persistent, thy name is Sherlock Holmes.
John stopped walking and looked up with puzzled expression. The bar was now in view and he could see Hamish sitting on the less populated side facing away from him. A gin and tonic sat beside him, half empty.
“What do you think I'm here for?” Vida shot him a feral look and laughed. “I have an other message for you, Mr. Holmes. Do you know much about planting a date palm?"
He could hear Sherlock shifting to an upright position. He looked up to lapis eyes almost right in his face. His breath caught.
The spell was dispelled when Sarah briskly trotted from her office to the front desk. She must have heard the disturbance over the phone in her office as well. She leaned heavily over the counter and eyed them both with frank disdain.
John whipped his head back now to the sounds of Sherlock now slowly sucking the tips of his dexterous violin-playing fingers in between those full lips.
John halted mid-expletive and barked, “What the hell? Where do you think you are going, just waltzing off while I'm trying to get through your thick skull and shove some damn sense in there??”
“Mrs. Greene?” A heavily pregnant woman with another child hanging off her hip and other assorted dangling baby accoutrement, waddled up and followed Hamish down the hall. He could hear them faintly as they walked further away from the waiting area.
As for the inconvenience… Sherlock was on the way to Tesco to buy the milk. John had been a bit grumpy this week due to stress at work. He wanted to do his new boyfriend (it still felt weird to think about it, to name it) a favour.
Someone like him! Ha. Sherlock may be blind since his fifth year, but surely he can navigate through a simple tube station, when John is walking right next to him.
Santa shouts in panic and Sherlock eyes fly open like he was just electrocuted. The door to basement has been thrown open, and a certain Captain Watson is running down the stairs, pointing his gun threateningly at Santa. It turns out that Santa is not the bravest man around. He rushes up and tries to storm away (where to?), so John pulls the trigger.
“Hogwarts has never allowed the prime minister to influence our school, this won’t change now. Besides, I have the good feeling we have someone powerful on our side at the
“As a doctor you can deduce the reason of his injuries. Look at your patient! Didn’t you think for one second that it’s not wise to restrain a victim of torture?
John asks. Nobody answers him, and Sherlock stares in the sky with a bad feeling. He spies two broomsticks, high above the field, certainly much higher than they are allowed.
Sherlock felt John’s shoulders move slightly against his. The other boy was trying to stifle his giggles.
nights and his experiments in the fridge and their talks at breakfast and the way Sherlock said his name like he was the only person that mattered in this world, this amazing man who called the stars beautiful while looking at him, he would mourn Sherlock until his last breath, when he would finally die.
John snarls to his cousins, rubbing Sherlock’s back with his gloved hand. Sherlock imagines John sending them to the wilderness, so they may be ripped apart by bears. It helps to calm him down.
“May I remind you that my husband and your future king will arrive back home in most likely a few hours and will definitely notice when I‘m missing a limb or twice.
Brown leather restraints were applied around his arms and legs, restricting his movement to a minimum. They were wrapped around his wrist and ankles and tied to the side of the bed. Greg could hear John preparing with the doctor Sherlock’s discharge, but Lestrade could only focus on Sherlock's face that resembled a ghost.
The snow was laying deep on the ground, but two boys didn’t care. They were dressed in thick coats and boots.
“Don’t worry, he is single now. Rumours is that his last girlfriend, Mary I think, cheated on him during the summer.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock shushes, leaning a bit more out of the window, so he can see his boyfriend better.
John resigned: “Fine.” He said, a bit disappointed. He fished out his phone and dialled Mycroft’s number.
John finally found what he was looking for, stood up from his chair and suddenly kneeled down next to a shocked Sherlock.
The next round they fought with spears, and it was a bit more successful than the swords, but Anderson still moved to slow and John managed to predict every move. This really was no fun, he decided, and told the slave to work with
“You can use him for simple housework, like cleaning or washing, or as a simple companion for your own children. We’ll start at
As it turns out, Imogene had the gardner put a nice little bouquet of “think of me” flowers on her husband's bedside table before she left on a “spontaneous” trip to Paris. Sherlock imagined she put in the final touches herself - a bit of greenery in the form of poisonous yew branches that grew in the formal garden. The yews began to droop after a few days and started to litter the table with their noxious pollen granules. The compulsively tidy husband either used his hand or a handkerchief to remove the offending botanical mess. He thereby stirred up enough of the pollen to irritate his sensitive bronchial mucosa and thus triggered the fatal attack.
Most of the children mumbled a quick greeting and returned back to their game. The nurse left John alone, and the boy wandered through the room, stopping on different groups of children, but never stayed. Finally he approached Sherlock’s corner. He observed the hidden boy with big eyes, then kneeled down next to him.
The crown prince is indescribable handsome, with short blond hair and deep blue eyes, and Sherlock prays that John isn’t too disappointed with him. John carefully puts his hand on Sherlock’s left cheek, and they both breathe each other in for a moment.
“I would have blackmailed you with something, I’m sure there is something you hide, everyone does. Or, I would have bought you a monthly supply of sweets from the
„Sherlock, please look at me.“ Sherlock did what he was told. John’s beautiful blue eyes met his. „I have to be very brave to do this now, so please bear with me for a second.“ He took a deep breath, then exhaled.
One hour later, Sherlock was offered a couch that could be fashioned into a bed, two drawers and a third of the bathroom closet. Mrs. Hudson offered him a place to sleep, her food and a safe space in exchange for a few hours every day working at her
John throws in quickly, “I don’t have children. The dog is for my boyfriend, he had one as a boy, so he definitely knows how take care of them.
John is a realistic man. He always knew that Sherlock’s and his time on the beach will come to an end one day. They lived in two different world, cultures, hell, they don’t are the same species. It is still painful, more so than John could have ever imagined.
wasn’t very saddened about his father’s death. Their relationship had been mostly business-related. He had attended the funeral like a good son, and that was it.
Sherlock realizes. He could try find a bank and sit down there, but he wasn’t in the mood of feeling himself around. Of course his phone doesn’t work either on the underground, and it’s still too crowded to effectively use his walking stick.
started the priest, but Mary interrupted him with a rude hand gesture. She addressed Sherlock directly now.
The first row was reserved for Mrs. Hudson, who wore a dangerously large hat, Molly’s fiancé Tom, who looked bored, Molly in a cute yellow dress and Greg in a grey suit.
’s office. Sherlock was not able to run as much as he usually does, because the bullet wound Mary gave him burns like iron today.
Molly has sent him a letter this week, telling him about her new black cat, Toby. Sherlock should be polite and answer her, but his bed is much more comfortable than the world outside it.
John stroked Sherlock’s white face and said a final sentence to the other doctor, who left the room in long strides. The retired soldier then started to unbuckle the restraints around his friends limbs. They had left faint red marks around his skin. Next,
Sherlock wants to thank John for visiting and staying with him the night, but he does not know how. He presses his palms against his legs and fidgets around on the seat.
Mary presses him down to the ground between the seats of the car. He feels something cold on his wrists and realizes that she is handcuffing him. The motion of the car coupled with the drug they gave him is making him dizzy, and he closes his eyes, just for a second…
Sherlock whispers. His eyes remain blank, but John knows him good enough to not be fooled. Sherlock is feeling hurt and vulnerable right now, and he needs John reassurance.
"Then, you planned their wedding. You wrote a beautiful best man speech, organized a fun stag night, taught John how to dance, and played the violin for them."
replied the ghost. “I made it link by link, chain by chain. I worked on it all my life, and so did you. Your chain is much longer now than it was two years ago!
John stepped again in front of Sherlock, shielding him from any view. The doctor was always very protective of Sherlock, but now he is even more so, building a wall between them and everyone else. Maybe not only a result of whatever happened to the detective, but also because he couldn’t be there for him yesterday, when he had to suffer through a panic attack, was drugged and then pinned down onto the hard mattress. John muttered something to Sherlock, which actually made him smile a bit, before curling his arms around the thin waist of the detective. Sherlock put his own arms around John's neck and Lestrade could hear a low “Ready?
The man wonders aloud while his eyes wander over Sherlock’s body. Sherlock ignores the temptation to pull his shirt tighter around himself.
The two are on their well-deserved holiday. October has been a difficult month for them. Or, better put, the whole year has been difficult. At first, John suggested a week in Spain or Greece, so they could catch the last warm and sunny days on a beach somewhere. Sherlock did not feel fit to fly for hours though, and in the end, they decided to stay somewhere comfortable and familiar: the little house in Sussex, which Janine has sold to them when she moved to France. Sherlock’s parents had stayed there the last week, to ensure the place is warm and clean. The weather had been good and the older Holmes enjoyed quiet walks at the beach. Margaret phoned John last night, when John was busy throwing all the books he plans to read into his and Sherlock’s shared luggage.
The two concentrate on eating for a while, allowing the general noise and festivity around them to dwell on. John appears to think about his next question very carefully.
Mary takes a few steps closer and is now in Sherlock’s private place. Sherlock resists the urge to push her away.
. His grey hair, the round spectacles, observing eyes and without a smile on his face. Everything about him was completely motionless, except for a few strands of his hair. All of this looked terrifying, but when
ends the evening and sends all the students away. The newly made perfects run around to collect the frightened first graders, and the students trickle out to their common rooms. Sherlock pretends to finish drinking his tea until everyone is gone, so John won’t feel embarrassed because of his limp (not that there is anything to be ashamed of, but John Watson must be a proud man). John gathers the hateful cane in his hand. Sherlock and John slowly leave the Great Hall together, and Sherlock is just about to leave to his rooms, when John stops him with a hand on his arms.
Sherlock Holmes, his best friend and love of his life, is a beautiful and temperamental merman. They spent most of their days together, swimming in the summer side by side, resting on a couple of large rocks in the sea, and in the colder months John joins him with his boat. Sherlock showed him seals, delicious clams (Sherlock himself is, as all mermen are, vegetarian) and even one time a whale. John has shown him his smartphone (getting Sherlock dry enough to touch it is a hassle), his dog, Redbeard (who Sherlock adored), and the internet. John had taught Sherlock how to read and write, and later the merman had helped him study for his A-Levels, and the merman was soon better at every lesson than John, with only one exception.
Soon, the large mountain with the waterfall is looming in front of them. Sherlock laughs excited behind him when they approach it. Unfortunately, they don’t have enough time to climb to the top, so half of it has to be enough. They tie Aidan right to a green meadow, and Aidan whinnied happily. John gets off him and catches Sherlock when he falls to the ground.
They flew quickly over the roofs of London and the river. Where there was fog, there was now a clear night, with snow laying on the ground. The two landed on the outskirts of London, in front of a large house that was desperately in need of repair.
“Just please, John. Don’t go with her. She was working with Moriarty, she has too many enemies who are hunting her. If you go with her you will die! I won’t ever contact you again, I will disappear from your life, but please, stay in London!
Sherlock is eternal thankful to make the proposal so that Sherlock won’t have to. He nods, and the couple start their short walk to the older Holmes.
The last weeks have been trying for them. With Mary returning out of the shadows, taking Sherlock as hostage, hurting him until he fell unconscious and then killing Mycroft with a shot in the head, well. They haven’t got much sleep. Mycroft’s funeral was two weeks ago, and Sherlock has just now started resting, trying to recover from years of neglect, drug abuse, torture, malnutrition and dangerous injuries. On top of that, John had to spent days laying in bed, resting his bad shoulder, which was strained pretty badly when he killed his wife.
A year later, he met Mary, a fellow nurse, funny and smart and kind, and John figured that this was his best and possibly last chance to find happiness. If he could not have Sherlock and crime-solving and Baker Street, then Mary and a job at a local clinic and house in the suburbs had to be enough.
He did not even struggle. Sherlock had just accepted his death, like a sentence he pleaded guilty of. He had trusted his best friend not to hurt him till the bitter end. How dare John Watson destroy something so beautiful.
This year, I am happy to announce that Professor Holmes has agreed to continue his position as the potion teacher.
Sherlock sinks down deeper into his chair, fiddling with his collar. He resists the urge to touch his lips, where he can still feel John’s touch.
, and after a few more movements he comes, his cock buried deep into Sherlock’s body. John collapses on top of Sherlock, who pulls his arms around his chest to keep him right there.
Believing in the good of people is his special gift. That and his angry stare that makes everyone nervous around him and start confessing.
Sherlock said his name like a prayer, and John was reminded of a similar but reversed situation down in the basement just minutes ago. He scooped all of his courage up from the floor and cupped Sherlock’s face with his hands.
famous sweet department. They always spent a lot of time together, but it was their first time in the capital without any parental supervision, which made it of course the best trip ever.
The walk back to his rooms is endless. The staircases are running wild today, and Sherlock is tempted to just throw himself off. Finally, the door closes behind and
„Don’t cry, Sherlock. Parents hate it when you do. I am sure someone will come pick you up soon too.“
Of course, at some point or other, John and her had to reconcile. Luckily, John only hugged her once and had not touched her again since Christmas. Sherlock’s favourite addict drugged them all and Sherlock shot Magnussen, which Mary has to admit was nice of him. Not necessary, because Mary would have taken care of it, but nice. It would not save him from her wrath, though.
“Good, that school practice was an awful idea. Anyway, what all the winking was about… I want to ask you if you are up to starting regular
Sherlock doesn’t answer. He opens his mouth, tries to move his lips, then turns green. John gets out the bucket under the bed just in time before Sherlock vomits with a groan.
"I think that’s where you are wrong. People would be running after you if they knew that you have the personal contact information of whoever owns the Tate Modern.“
The children in the orphanage were kept busy with trying to mob the wet floor, while a few nurses were parading around them. His little brother was wearing a dark coat, that was way too long for him, and trousers with holes over his knees. Sherlock was trying his best, but his thin arms were not fast enough in their washing movements. He had managed to fill a bucket with water and stood up to bring it out into the white storm outside. Maybe the brace around his leg had been too short or it was stolen, because his weak right leg was now entirely unsupported. He slipped on the floor, his right leg gave out under him, and he fell down hard. The bucket partly drenched him, the rest landed on the floor.
Lestrade grumbled something about ungrateful brats and wandered off to the kitchen. This left Sherlock and John suddenly on their own, and things got awkward. Sherlock fiddled with the blanket that Lestrade had thrown over him, and John stared at his shoes. Did he even pack his toothbrush?
The audience of about fifty listen attentively to the auctioneer, who is reading aloud from his piece of paper. The small boy with the curly head and frightened blue eyes is standing next to him, his little hands bound behind his back.
Today, he is going to adopt a dog. A few months ago, Sherlock had shown him pictures of him and Redbeard, the Irish Settler he had in his childhood. The dog had been his only companion for years, following him on every adventure and sleeping next to his bed. They had sorted through

child‘ and no one wanted to bother with a constantly sick child. A few months after John arrived, a rich couple visited. They loved his blond hair and blue eyes, and they wanted him as a son, but John made such a mess at their home that they soon sent him back.
Then, the last one. The one scar they rarely mention. Sherlock has talked about his made inflicted through torture in a cold chamber in East Europe, with a therapist, John and once Mrs. Hudson. The nightmares and flashbacks will probably never truly disappear, but it is with his hard emotional work manageable now.
Beer. How terribly pedestrian. They all clunk their glasses together and congratulate each other on their newest solved case. Sherlock’s beer tastes terrible, and Sherlock hides his disgusted face behind his glass. John throws him an amused look and then throws an arm around Sherlock. John’s arm is warm and emits a reassuring feeling. Sherlock breathes it in with delight. John has touched him more often in the last weeks, now that the fiasco with Mary Moran is behind them, and Sherlock wishes wholeheartedly for something more, something deeper. He hopes that John shares his wish. Maybe when they are back home and both pleasantly drunk, Sherlock could take the first step into the new path of their relationship.
Fortunately, the knife shouldn’t have hit any of the organs. He ripped his suit jacket into smaller parts and started to wrap them around the wound. Sherlock was panting, his otherwise smooth face crunched in pain.
The body. Would John ever find him? Maybe the man would burn him or throw him away. Maybe his corpse would be discovered weeks from now. Molly would probably do the autopsy to spare him from another stranger touching him. She would notice the marks a rapist makes on his victims and John would know. Would he be able to move on? Sherlock desperately hoped so. Making John Watson happy was his main goal of his life. John would be devastated, but surely he would manage to soldier on. Maybe he will find a new person to make him happy. Someday.

Gregory sighed. “You have grown more distant, you barely talk to anyone anymore, you seldom acknowledge me. All you care about is the work and the profit, and that’s no way to live.
was so very happy for them. When he had some time he would probably throw back a few drinks, call Sally and Anderson and look who won the Yard’s pool.
John says quickly. Not a good moment to tease Sherlock about his pop culture knowledge. “I didn’t you like Jane Austen.
There was another thing: John genuinely liked Sherlock. He liked his quick answers, his smart wit, his rapidly whispered deductions in his ear, the tales from Britannia and his vast knowledge about literally anything than the stars (and sex, apparently). He feared if Sherlock dared to run away, John would not be able punish him.
Sherlock sighed and went up to the door. His mother knew how talking to new people made him nervous, and yet she wanted him to do it again and again. Mummy called it practice. Just say hello, thank you, and goodbye, reminded Sherlock himself. Four words, that’s not hard. Four words are totally manageable. He forces himself not to count the money, because surely his mum gave him enough.
John scratches his head. “We discovered too many… differences between us, so I ended it a fortnight ago.
drove them both to the hospital. The nurses checked John’s head, gave him a quick scan and pronounced him healthy, but they advised John to stay for one night for observation. This naturally meant that Sherlock would stay at the hospital too.
John unclipped the leash and put it on the table, then opened the chain around his ankles. At last, he removed the gag from his mouth. His fingers brushed not so accidentally over the pale lips. Everything about this man was desirable. Thank Jupiter it was all his now.
Harry presses her pillow on her head and tries to tune out her little brother. She loves him dearly, but he can be a bit stubborn sometimes, especially when she just wants to fall asleep.
It didn’t take long until John called him back in. Sherlock was completely dressed, and only then did Greg notice the weird way he holds his legs. They didn't look broken, they looked mangled. The doctor was standing between his legs and cradled Sherlock's head, fingers carefully brushing over the fragile cheekbones, avoiding the bruise. The detective led out a painful whimper and John cupped the back of his head and pressed him into his wollen jumper. Sherlock's body was wrecked by a hard shake and he only calmed down when his doctor began caressing his back.
“You are my friend Sherlock. In fact, you have become my best friend. If anything bothers you, you can tell me. Whatever you are going through, you won’t have to do it alone.
In front of them stands the small house, their new home. It’s nowhere as grant as the Holmes’s mansion, but John decided they didn’t need so much place at the moment (although Sherlock will surely adopt a couple of dogs in the following years). It consists of a small kitchen corner, a massive bed (very stable, of course), and most important, a fireplace.
The room they wheeled John in is crowded with seven other patients, all with only mild injuries, but the noise and the chaos grates on Sherlock’s raised nerves. He shuffles on his hard chair and tries to find a position which is a bit comfortable, while patient number 2 is phoning her sister, patient number 5 is watching a show about zombies way too loud and patient number 7 is hollering at number 4 to hurry up in the bathroom.

John is staring out of the window. He hopes that he or she (the caretaker at school said he has to marry a girl, but John will not allow himself being tied down by those funny standards) will like him to, because that’s the most important part, right?
After a lot of moving, more swearing and accidentally dropping a box on his toes, John still had not found anything that could have caused the noise. He sighed, frustrated, and let his flashlight again wander through the room. John noticed a corner he hadn’t searched yet, because there was a huge table placed in front of it. He fought his way through the chaos and experimentally tugged at the table. To his surprise, it wasn’t as heavy as he feared, and he moved it aside. It was not as dusty as the rest of the stuff, so maybe Mary had placed it here recently.
Sherlock did what he was told, face burning. He starred up to his captor, eyes full of hate. The man didn’t notice or ignored that.
The three friends watch and listen to the game in silence for a few minutes. The commentator’s voice disappears completely due to the cold wind, and Sherlock has to depend on Irene’s and Molly’s comments to gain an impression of the game.
Hanging was seen by many people as a quick and painless death, but there are actually four different ways for this method. The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is “specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck.“
I have noticed that the first chapter has gained next to no attention, and I'm not sure what I did wrong. If you enjoyed reading, please give kudos or write a comment!
They reach the large throne room, with spectators standing everywhere. A loud gasp goes through the room as they spot Sherlock’s sorry state.
too for a while, but he wasn’t interested in marriage or children. Fighting in the arena was not life-fulfilling, it would be unfair (and very boring) to bring a wife into his sort-of suicide plan.
’s common rooms. Sherlock can spy multiple bottles of scotch behind a glass door, but they are all unopened and untouched. Maybe Sherlock is not the only one with a past addiction.
table, he swore to everyone that could hear him that he would avenge his fallen friend. Thinking about revenge was better than coming to terms with the grief that was threatening to overwhelm him. Again. The 18 months would only be a taste of the many years that were left in his life, because he would mourn this amazing man, this combination of handsomeness and cleverness, the soft curls and full lips and colourful eyes and the smart brain and the long legs and the pale skin and his sexy voice and his catlike walking and his fast deductions and the swirling of his coat and his beautiful laughter and their
He says quickly. He can hear Irene preparing herself for a comeback, and he really wants to avoid that.
was off to London all the time. Soon Sherlock would join him in the big city, when he attended university. Actually one of his biggest worries was how to find a volunteering flatmate for him. Most boys in his age didn’t like him, one of the reasons was their common internal homophobia and fragile masculinity, but it’s also because Sherlock tended to be a bit of an arse (or so Greg put it, Molly’s boyfriend).
Sherlock couldn’t stop the muffled scream that came out of his (gagged) mouth, which resulted in more saliva (humiliating). The rational part of his mind told him that Marys bullet hurt much more than this, but the other half of his brain was in full panic mode. The plug was pushed deeper and deeper inside of him and (oh god) it burned so much. His hole was slowly widened and it just felt invasive and so wrong. The man shhhhhh-ed at him again while he was invading his body and Sherlock felt (with deep shame) tears rolling down his cheek.
Unfortunately, Sherlock was not the only student at Hogwarts who harboured romantic feelings for the hot Quidditch player. John and Sherlock had become inseparable when they first met on the train to their way to Hogwarts. During these years, John had 6 relationships. Six different girls, small, tall, blond, brunette, black, curly, straight, shy, confident, smart, stupid. Six different girls and six different break-ups. The longest lasting relationship had been with Mary Morstan. They’ve spent nearly all of Year Six together, until John had spectacularly broken up with her. It had been the number one topic of gossip for weeks. Unfortunately, the public opinion had soon sided with Mary, and turned against Sherlock. His fellow students speculated that Sherlock had come between them and bewitched John so that he would break up with seemingly perfect Mary Morstan. Sherlock believed privately that Mary had started the rumour herself. He had carefully approached John, wanting to know the real reason, but John had always randomly changed the topic, until Sherlock stopped asking. He had learned that sometimes, it was best not to press the other boy into answering.
“It’s tradition! You’re meant to kiss the person you love at midnight. It brings luck for the relationship and for the new year.
The Ghost shrugged: “You deleted all your memories of him. You were no longer interested in Sherlock’s fate."
He tried to go extra carefully now. Just about thirty minutes, then Sherlock would walk down these steps, hopefully smiling at him. He just had to survive this thirty minutes, then Sherlock would be here. With him at his side, John could face everything. Even
"Listen carefully, Sherlock.  In a few moments, we'll be forced to stop and we'll have to move fast if we want to survive.   The best I can offer you is this--there is a gun in the passenger glove compartment and another in a holster under my left arm.  If I cannot make it..."
Sherlock leaned into John, eyes flashing fire.  “Now you have the unmitigated gall to stand there and tell me
Sherlock backed off and gestured toward the mirror.  “If you wish to view the heartless one here, look no further than that.”
Sherlock breathed in deeply, wiped his eyes, and felt an unexpected warmth bloom within him.  No matter how bitter this parting, he now knew John loved him.  More than a best friend, more than a best man...in another life, he could have simply been
The official picked up Sherlock's shirt, shook it in his direction, then threw it at him.  Carefully, Sherlock dressed as best he could with ripped fabric and missing buttons.  The official nodded, confirming that was what he had expected Sherlock to do.  Once put together, the official shouted more commands to Sherlock's captors.
Mycroft smiled, almost fondly.  "I have no intention of keeping you apart any longer than necessary, though it
Mycroft used his good hand to remove his pocket square, shake it out, and dab his pale, damp forehead.  It seemed as though merely standing to speak to John was an incredible strain on his body.  The doctor in John hoped Mycroft would be receiving additional medical care of his own before the day was out.
Seconds before he lost his trousers, an urgent, panicked voice shouted from the hall, joined by a second.  Translating quickly, Sherlock realized they were shouting, "Commander!  The Commander is here!"
“Barely! The whole thing has been a sham…and you did it in the first place to escape my absence in your life."
Sherlock remained in his chair and regarded him.  John moved to the door, opening it and standing still for a moment because he did not know exactly where he could storm off
Sherlock was having none of it, though his expression was more beseeching than smug. “Tell me what you came to tell me, John.”
and now that we're here, I have so much to tell you that I'm at somewhat of a loss. I suppose I can and must start by apologizing for what I've put you through.  Had I understood the impact it would have had on you, perhaps we could have sorted some other way.”
John’s laughter died down to a huff and he looked down at his clasped hands.  “I walked for about an hour before the rain came.  Spent another thirty minutes getting a terrible coffee and took a cab back here…all of which I’m sure you already knew.”
Sherlock and John broke apart.  Sherlock fleetingly wondered how long they had been standing and clinging to one another for Mycroft to feel the need to intervene.  He looked at John and saw him--for the first time in a long time--open and unguarded.  What he witnessed filled him with an odd comfort, as shocking as it was.  Were he to die tomorrow, he could do so finally knowing what it was like to see unquestionable romantic love for him in John Watson's eyes.  What a shame that it had to happen now.
between them, and now he was on a plane.  He didn't tell John exactly what this was all about, but he knew Sherlock did not expect to return.  It didn't take a, well, a Sherlock Holmes to know this wasn't just Sherlock in exile.  It was possible he just put the man he loved on a plane to--
"He asked for you repeatedly.  He also made various threats towards me as well as the whole of the British Government if I would not relinquish his phone while he was conscious, though his doctors have since kept him mostly otherwise since his arrival.  Now you know he is alive and why he had to put you through thinking he was not, I'm confident I can trust you not to stress his present condition with demands of further explanation at this time?"
Sherlock nodded.  “Its occupation was no longer under threat.  Additionally, I had thought you would be sitting in it more frequently.”
Mycroft motioned to his bodyguards.  One came to stand next to him while the other two stepped aside for John to exit.
Mycroft explained Sherlock's terrible decision on the rooftop, how he had been forced to make it, and why he had to keep John in the dark.  Mycroft informed him Sherlock had had his phone returned to him just ahead of leaving the country, though he could not use it without discovery.  When Mycroft got to the part describing how he had to go undercover to get Sherlock out (and the aftermath of their nearly-botched escape), John gripped his arms where they were crossed so tightly he would later have bruises.
Sherlock observed John set his face like he had dozens of times before.  John was clearly preparing himself.  Sherlock thought he was ready, having practiced this moment all the way to the plane, but he felt emotions swirl within him that he could not seem to settle.  He needed to focus, but John was rattling him without saying a word.  Sherlock thought this was his opportunity to finally admit how he felt and make the deathbed confession he did not make last time.  True, this was not yet his deathbed but it was close enough--John would not be there to see this seemingly inevitable fall later on.  John still looked at him, steeled and ready.
His voice sounded rough and when he paused to clear his throat, John jumped up to help him with some water.
"Bind his hands and his feet."  He leaned into Sherlock, and though he didn't believe Sherlock understood him, he still snarled, "You are going with The Commander.  If you behave yourself, death will be mercifully swift.  If you cause trouble, you'll beg for the end days before it comes."
--Sherlock began to stir.  John fancied it was because Sherlock sensed his presence.  Slowly, Sherlock came around and blinked blearily in his direction.
“I realized I do not live anywhere anymore,” John said.  “It is a rather sobering thought to realize one has nowhere to have a good strop.”
He had prepared himself for about any sight, yet his gait involuntarily seized and nearly caused him to stumble when his eyes landed upon Sherlock.  It wasn’t because his scraggly beard and abnormally long hair made him look different (though they did) or because he looked like he had quite been through it (also true), but because John had spent months expecting never to see him again, period, and no amount of hoping, planning, pep talks, or fantasizing came close to preparing him for every possible emotion surging through him from simply laying eyes upon Sherlock again.  John carefully moved into the chair next to the bed and while he itched to reach out and touch Sherlock, he made himself wait.
Slow minutes crept by and frigid dread seeped into Sherlock's very bones. Over the past several months, he'd had only too much time to reflect on his life--and John. If only John was there now, or if Sherlock could have had the courage of a man with nothing left to lose when they were still running up and down the streets of London...
Sherlock heard the door close and John’s familiar footfalls on the stairs.  John walked in with hair mildly wet from the rain (
John supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised Sherlock had read his resolve—was it the set of his jaw or the corners of his eyes that gave him away, he wondered?  Still, he played coy.
So anxious was he, he did not pause to change, comb his hair, nor simply cast a glance in the mirror.  Running down the stairs, he could not even string his thoughts together in coherent sentences.
"Relax, John.  I have no intention of addressing this without Sherlock.  I've got some calls to make, if you'll excuse me," Mycroft said, climbing in his car again.
Mary held his hand, occasionally rubbing her thumb over his knuckles.  It made his skin crawl.  Perhaps the stories of the things she had done as a child, the records she listened to in her teens, and the goofy friends she had as an adult were all true and simply told through her Mary persona.  It could be that whomever she was really did love a certain shade of lilac and that she honestly found Simon Pegg movies ridiculously funny.  Maybe she let him know true bits and pieces of her, but he would never be certain.  He couldn't trust it.  He would never know what was pretend and what was real with her.  He didn't think she truly even loved him, or if she did, she did not love him as selflessly as Sherlock.
"Do you see now why it is a matter of security that he is transferred?  The Commander himself has chosen to do what needs to be done.  He trusts no one else, not even a driver.  Now," the official turned to Sherlock.  "Dress.  Quickly.  Do you understand?"
Sherlock gazed back out the window and imagined best-case scenarios of what it would have been like if he and John had done this properly long, long ago.  He was shaken from his reverie not long after.
Sherlock took a few steps toward John.  John took a couple of his own.  He did not remember closing the distance after that.  The next thing he realized, his feet were off the ground and his nose was full of Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock looked around rapidly, assessing his situation as quickly as possible. There was nothing at his disposal.
Sherlock’s eyes swept over John’s face again.  “No, and I would go further in saying since that is indeed the case, I don't see the point in waiting.  Let’s just get it out now.”
The door to Sherlock's left opened and Mycroft pulled him out.  There was a flash of metal in the darkness, Mycroft groaning in pain, then another glint.  In less than ten seconds, Mycroft had cut Sherlock loose with what had to be an incredibly sharp knife.  He turned to make a remark noting as much but Mycroft cut him off frantically.
Mary looked at John, suddenly wide-eyed and terrified.  "John, do not leave me alone too long.  I have good reason to be afraid of James Moriarty and I don't think that I--" she stopped to caress her swollen stomach and glanced back up sweetly, "that
and I was told I flat-lined once before recovering.  You stayed by her side in spite of knowing this, however
John virtually launched himself through the rear door of the black car that awaited him at the curb, mind clearing enough to locate several more words than he had had on his way down--though woe be to Anthea when he unleashed them.
“Is that what this is?  ‘Let’s see how far we can push John Watson before he snaps?’ After all I’ve done for you?” John moved back into Sherlock’s personal space.  “I didn’t think even you could be so cruel.”
John had no idea what sort of horrifying road was ahead of them, but he felt much better knowing they were going to face it like they always did:  Sherlock Holmes and his blogger.
Sherlock was unfazed.  “If you would have looked at the bloody flash drive, you would’ve known what questions to ask!”
Once again, he was forcibly dragged away from the common room, eventually intercepted by someone who led him to a familiar face in an even more familiar reception area.
John noted it took him a few moments longer than it might have at full capacity, but ordeal or not, he was
Sherlock and John both hit a brick wall on their way to hope...though Sherlock hadn't had much to start.
Sherlock stood.  He had spent most of John’s absence pondering John and not Moriarty.  He told himself he really should devote the next several hours to lining up the clues Moriarty had given them to find out his latest game, but John was close and warm and Sherlock’s own body was traitorous.
He rolled his lips in and took a breath to calm himself.  The worst part was the likely father was not even a heavy such Magnussen or Moriarty themselves, but one of Moriarty’s lower henchmen.  He wasn’t even sure  it was done at Moriarty’s request.  It had been hinted she knew him when they were contract killers.  John's rage flared anew.  He stepped into Sherlock’s face and spoke with a placid tone Sherlock well knew hid some of John’s most volatile emotions.
"I did not give you permission to address me," the official barked.  "Orders have changed.  This man carries sensitive information that can neither be trusted to you nor lost by your...overzealousness in interrogation.  If you were to inadvertently kill him before we found out what we needed to know, your own executions would be next."
John turned the knob and found it unlocked.  He walked into Mycroft's office.  Every thing was unnervingly neat and the air smelled almost musty, as though no one had been in it in a while.  He glanced back at Anthea, sheepish and disheartened.
While a stranger drives Sherlock who-knows-where, not knowing anything at all drives John up a wall.
Sherlock faded in and out of consciousness.  He fought to retain the pitiful amount of awareness his body would allow, annoyingly unsure how much time had passed since he had been shoved in the backseat of the vehicle.   A wave of adrenaline brought his mind back online quite suddenly, aided by a sharp noise--some sort of machinery--followed by the sound of gunfire and a gut-roiling swerve of the vehicle.  There was a shout from the driver.
"In no condition to deal with your inevitable temper over the present circumstances and their obvious, undeniable conflict with the story we have had to pass off as the truth for the past several months, Dr. Watson, which is why you are here with me first."
Sherlock was carried to a waiting vehicle and shoved ungently in the back.  There was no one else with him.  Though it was dark, he did his best to take stock of his surroundings.  A black (and doubtlessly bulleproof) partition separated the driver from the back seats.  Like a luxury vehicle, there were two bench seats where he was, one facing front and one facing back.  However, like a police vehicle, there were no handle mechanisms on the door, nor visible and unlockable locks.  Interesting.  There was nothing Sherlock could possibly utilize for escape in his position, not the odd way they had him bound.  His hands were tied together, and tied once again up near his heart, with the rope around his chest.  They had not thought to confiscate his phone, but they certainly made sure he couldn't get to it.  There was nothing to do but wait.
the bottom floor of the flat to smell like you after you have a shower.” He hummed a self-deprecating laugh.  “I’m so ridiculous.  Having the unbelievable second chance to tell you any of this supersedes my wildest dreams, and yet I’m still shaking with fear even while saying it.”
“I love you, have been in love with you, and if the misery of the past several months has taught me anything in this world, it has shown me I always will be.  I also need you, need you more than I ever let myself believe before I lost you.  I need to bug you to eat dinner with me and I need to hear your rants of disdain for the general populace and I absolutely, positively
John cocked his head, pursed his lips, and pointed toward the sky.  "You've got to call that plane back," he said forcefully.
"Good.  You definitely received more information from me than you would have Sherlock, anyway.  I will not be going with you, but two of these gentlemen will take you to him directly from here and are under orders not tarry on their way.  I have made sure the hospital has paperwork and clearance in order for you to be allowed to see him, any time of day or night."
John tilted his head, raising his forehead in question.  “What do I have to do to get another kiss, then?”
"Nothing so mundane," Mycroft replied.  "I cannot allow you to stroll up to Sherlock with your verbal guns blazing, if you'll forgive the metaphor.  Additionally, if I know my brother, he will naturally omit details I think it crucial for you to know about how and why he came to be there."
He clenched and released a fist, stretched his neck, pulled in one more lungful for courage, and opened the door.
“I think your suggesting I’m a latent homosexual takes a little precedence here!  I’m a married man!” John realized he was so angry he was shaking.
He paused about halfway up before he remembered.  He descended a bit slower, declaring at the bottom,  “I don’t live here anymore."
In her usual spot was a man.  Though seated, it was obvious he was tall, fit, and John did not doubt the fellow was also armed.  They made eye contact, sizing one another up.  John surmised this man, whomever he was, either had strict orders to tell John nothing or knew nothing himself about the current situation.  Therefore, he sat in silence for the duration of the ride.
Sherlock had said as much in that final mystery text, and Mycroft had spelled it out the rest of the way when he explained to John exactly why Sherlock had put them through all the nightmarish things they had endured, but hearing him
“Just so I’m clear--simple little mind and all that--you did just admit that you loved me enough to appropriate my wedding?” asked John.
John stood next to Mary and watched Sherlock's plane grow smaller in the sky.  He was shocked and sad.  For years he had told himself Sherlock was incapable of love.  He had been working especially overtime to convince himself of this since Sherlock's undeath, but he couldn't remain fooled when Sherlock shot Magnussen.  Since then, he had been in a state of numbness as he looked back on his life decisions and realized he had made some very large missteps.
“Goddammit!  This is not a fucking game, Sherlock!  This is my life!  This isn’t one of your stupid gambits and I’m not an experiment.”  John grabbed Sherlock by the collar.  “So bloody help me, you are going to tell me what  I want to know.”
"John, there’s something I should say, I’ve meant to say always and I never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now."
