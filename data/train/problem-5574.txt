“I’m not trying to be an asshole,” he complains, and Steve pulls his wrists away from his face. His expression when he looks down at him is kind, albeit sad.
“And if that child joins the swim team?”
Tears well in Tony’s eyes. His eyes flicker wildly from side to side, searching the room, and so Steve takes his messy hand and puts it on Steve’s face. He sucks Tony’s thumb into his mouth and imagines the taste of him, and it’s enough to make him moan.
“Right. So he recovered easy, and I’m stuck like this after a two-day coma,” Tony said, and Bruce had sighed.
“Yeah,” he says, and Steve colours, scrambling up and away with his hands raised.
"Okay," Pepper says, softly.
“Sorry, sweetheart. Some alpha I’m cracking up to be, huh?” He laughed, small and bitter, then jumped off the bed and padded towards the bathroom. “I’ll run you a hot bath, round up some breakfast…”
“Should I deploy?”
“I am your ASI, sir, not your dog.”
He steps back through the wall.
“Being a poor, disabled, Irish Catholic in the early 1900’s shaped your political beliefs and moral principles,” Tony says. “Just like becoming able-bodied after the serum did. Waking up in the future and suddenly finding yourself the epitome of ‘privilege’ by every measure—white, ostensibly straight, tall, blonde haired, blue eyed, financially stable, educated, well-connected, Christian, alpha—in the future is affecting you now. Everyone’s affected by their identity. What does being an alpha mean to you?”
the voice coos, and Steve is crying, curled and small, over Peggy’s dead body. She took the bullet for Erskine before the experiment could be completed, and he knows this wasn’t how it went, he knows, he knows Peggy is old and greying and still so beautiful-
“What the fuck is that?” Tony skirls, and then, “Oh my god, Bruce. What the hell did he do with my schematics? Why didn’t you use that earlier?”
"I want to negotiate the terms of my surrender."
“Call Stephen,” Tony says, “and tell him I said thank you, and he was right; it all worked out.”
“Did we ever brief you on Pleasant Hill?” Tony asks, tilting his head to the side. His eyes don’t move to look at Steve, but that doesn’t matter. They’re the only ones in the room. Both Bruce and Clint had elected to be elsewhere.
“Guess I’m just so used to listening to you,” Tony says, shrugging, and Steve blinks at him. “I didn’t even notice, if you can believe it. Ask J.”
“I think I’d have to examine her power in person to know, but it seems likely that lowered inhibitions could be a side-effect. But I think we both know that your relationship with Stark is already fraught, and often needs the barest spark for combustion.”
“Feel better?” the priest asks, and Steve smiles.
Steve stares at Tony with wide eyes, silent even as Tony removes his hand from his mouth. “Is that…you’ve been just…doing all of this? By yourself?” But even as he says it, he knows it’s a stupid question. Because of course Tony has. Of course he’s been shouldering all of this by himself, of course-
Steve freezes. His heart stutters in his noncorporeal chest.
She probably will, but Tony’s not going to tell her that to her face.
“Tony?” Steve asked, stepping forward, but Tony only backed up another step, and another, until the kitchen island was between them. That hurt, and a flash of it must have shown on his face, because Tony’s expression turned placating.
He can see the quinjet’s shrinking distance in the corner of his display as he speaks, shooting Loki’s hands as he tries to raise them. Loki hisses, then whispers something foul, and Tony lets out a shout as he begins to sink down into the ground. He shoots at Loki again, but Loki deflects it this time, so Tony shoots past him and hits Amora in the back of her pretty blonde head, knocking her into Barnes. Another shot hits him in the back from behind, rattling his teeth, and JARVIS flashes warnings about damage to the armour’s plating as he struggles to get up. The woman in white must have woken up.
“Ask me nicely.”
One day from sight, the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark.
Tony let out a quiet sound, almost like a stopper being pulled on an airtight jar. It was enough to make Steve’s chest feel like something was squirming inside of it, and he stepped around the island to wrap his arms around Tony from behind, resting his chin on his alpha’s shoulder. He pressed the newly filled coffee mug into Tony’s trembling hands.
Steve raises his eyebrows, flipping the little tin disc over his fingers. “That’s ‘cause I usually don’t bother. Yes or no, Tony?”
Tony stared at her like she was a particularly confusing piece of code. “Okay?”
Tony nods. Swallows. “Okay. Well, I don’t know where this is going, but if you’re trying to endear yourself to me-”
Surprise breaks over Tony’s face like a wave cresting smooth rocks. “A surprisingly sentimental reason from you, Hill.”
“Is that my penance, father?” Steve asks. This priest doesn’t seem quite like the ones he’s used to, but he finds that he likes his way of doing things much better.
Tony wasn’t going to win any ribbons, that was for sure. He didn’t think any two pieces of onion were cut the same. He sliced canned tomatoes, added some garlic, some spice for warmth. He couldn’t tell the difference between the paprika and the chilli, but Rogers said the stew needed both so it didn’t matter either way. He cubed potatoes, carrots, added dried red peppers. He tossed in a few cubes of beef from the icebox out back, added some water, then covered the whole thing and let it bubble on its own.
“Of course I can see you.”
“How long have you been doing this?” Tony asks him, and Steve sets the remote down with the kind of deliberate care that means he’s trying not to break it. Tony’s seen him do it before, with objects or people, when he doesn’t trust himself to control his own strength.
Steve hasn’t been alone since he woke up in this body, but he hadn’t seen Tony once. When he’d asked in SHIELD medical, they told him Tony’s team was still on mission, and he’d accepted that. But Bucky and Carol were here, and they’d gone down south with them. So where was Tony? Where was Peter?
“Hey, okay,” Tony said, pulling away. He took Steve’s head in his hands, forced his face up to meet Tony’s eyes. “I push you every fucking day, Steve. Is that what you’re worried about? You know better than anyone that nobody makes me do anything I don’t wanna do.” He pressed his forehead to Steve’s, breathing deeply in a way that made Steve echo him. He concentrated on Tony’s breath, the feel of rough fingers on his cheekbones and jaw.
Eventually, Maria Hill appears at the door, about seven minutes into Tony’s usual checks on Steve’s status logs. She leans against the wall for a long time, not speaking, and Tony doesn’t bother to acknowledge her. Finally, she clears her throat, just once.
“You’re going to have to be hospitalised yourself if this keeps up. Once Tony’s bloodwork comes back, Bruce can tell you how long it will be before you can be with each other again. You can calculate if it’s worthwhile to take suppressants, but in the meantime, sleeping with a fellow pack omega will stabilise you a little. Enough for you to get some badly-needed rest.”
“I can’t do this,” Tony whispers.
“I’ll have Bambi send you the info on the float,” Pepper says, and Tony nods at her. Then he steps out of her office, and closes the door behind him, because emotions make him break out in hives.
“Nope! Not talking about this right now,” Tony says hysterically, glancing around. The majority of the SI employees are still milling about in the street, mixing with the other parade members, but there are people lining the sidewalks. The control panel is cleverly hidden, mostly for aesthetics, but Tony doesn’t trust the press to not be out with long-range directional mics. People are always so desperate for Avengers gossip.
Something cold slides into his skull like a knife, slipping smoothly through his thoughts and deeper down, into his fears, his dreams. It takes every image of Tony’s smile, every cherished moment with Bucky, and crushes them down into the spaces between his nightmares. His mother wheezes her last. Bucky falls from the train. Tony plummets to his death from the wormhole. Tony is announced dead on CNN, his Malibu mansion rubble in the Pacific. Bucky stares at him, flat, without recognition. Bucky drives a knife into his lungs, and he splutters, copper blood.
There’s a chorus of boos and laughter from the assembled group, and Steve grins at his family as they heckle him.
“I couldn’t say.”
“So I ran with the info you gave me, put some feelers out. There have been two deaths in the last year that match the MO, but they’re pretty low-level, which is why it took a sec for them to register.” Beth gestures to a holoscreen and does something on her phone, obviously sending Friday the files. A photo of an androgynous young East Asian person with short green hair pops up. “Thanks Fri. This is Avery Yamashita, an environmentalist lobbyist and podcaster. Killed quietly on their way home from work. It was investigated as a possible hate crime, then mysteriously classed as a mugging gone wrong, even though there was $36 in cash left in their wallet. Supposedly the cops couldn’t find a phone or laptop and that’s the motive. Can’t really tell if it’s corruption and someone was paid off or it’s just your garden-variety transphobia from the Baltimore PD, but I’m betting on the former.”
“Because I just ordered you to let me have you?” Steve asks, bitter, and Tony shakes his head.
“Perhaps,” Loki says, stilling, “I chose you because we are both liars, Tony Stark.”
Tony groans softly at the images that assail him, and the laugh that Steve favours him with is knowing, delighted. “You’re a fucking menace.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Rhodey asks, folding his arms across his chest. He and Bruce are standing on the quinjet ramp, flanking Natasha. Bruce is staring at him with narrowed eyes, the blanket wrapped around him like a cloak. He looks dangerous.
Something passes over Loki’s face––
Steve whines and tucks his face into the side of Tony’s neck. “Oh my God.”
There was a long silence. Steve couldn’t bring himself to meet Tony’s eyes, instead staring at the shift of Tony’s weight telegraphing through his bare feet on the padded floor of the tank. Against his will, Steve could feel his throat tightening, despair at even the thought of finishing what he came down here to say making him feel like he was coming apart, like something sharp was trying to claw out of his chest, but he had to. It wasn’t right.
Steve cracks a smile. He pulls his last boot off, then his shirt, and Tony watches the play of muscles in his back with his tongue pressed hard against the back of his teeth. Steve’s body is magnificent, a miracle every single time.
"What are you working on?" Steve asks, laughter in his voice, and Tony wrinkles his nose at him without looking away from his work.
Thor throws up a hand and turns back to his food, brows perhaps permanently fused together given how hard he’s frowning. Tony makes a note to give him a wide berth.
TonyandSteve. SteveandTony. They become partners. In battle. As friends. Somewhere, through all the bickering and the drag out fights and the alcohol and coffee and the laughter, they meld together to form something new.
Tony blinks, his eyes tilting over to where Peter’s perched at the island. Steve can’t bear to tear his eyes away from Tony. He’s still got two fingers in his mouth. But whatever Tony sees there makes his eyes crinkle. He looks a little smug, and Steve can imagine exactly what Peter’s face is doing. MJ or not, Steve’s seen him flirting with Wade.
“That why it hasn’t left your rooms in a fortnight?”
“Helloooo handsome,” Tony drawls, grinning. “Well, well, well. I didn’t know you’d graduated to this level of technology 101. Have you been practicing sexting, too? Who taught you? Romanov?”
“Is it too late to call Stephen and tell him ‘never mind’?” Tony asks, and Steve barks out a startled laugh.
“Her signature is much more easily traced than Mr. Laufeyson,” JARVIS says, and Tony grins wickedly.
“Spidey…”
“You’re not gonna like it,” he admits, because he might as well give it up now. Natasha always gets what she wants. Clint raises an eyebrow at him. “I feel stupid for getting caught in the first place.” Clint’s mouth is open, ready to argue, but Steve holds up a hand. He stares down at the table, at the amber liquid in his glass. “I know what you’re going to say. But you wanted to know how I feel, so. That’s how I feel. Tony got me these tickets to the Botanical Gardens as a peace offering and I took my sketchbook to see the sakura festival and I don’t know what happened to it and I’m…pretty upset about it, honestly. I had some drawings in there I’m pretty sore about losing. And it was stupid, because I was completely unarmed and I left without telling anybody, but I just wanted some time to be myself. To be Steve Rogers, the artist, who-…”
“Yeah, laugh it up,” Wilson says, voice rough. Bruce hands him a glass of water, and Tony flops back down into his seat and polishes off the rest of his meal while Sam rinses his mouth out in the sink and gets himself settled. “We traded Cap for a genocidal psychopath?”
around anyone he likes. Erskine’s genius could give him muscles that can stop a moving vehicle, but it couldn’t give him any kind of charm to speak of. He’s got eidetic memory and he still hasn’t learned how to talk to a handsome fella like a normal human being. Buck would call him tragic if he could see him now, and he’d be right. Steve is a tragedy. He’s a travesty.
“All the more reason why it was important that people were made to go and fight for what was right,” he argues. “I’ll admit not every soldier I met was…well. The term now would be politically correct. But once you got to the camps, you couldn’t deny what was happening. I saw battle hardened men who’d used words I don’t feel comfortable repeating sobbing like babies over piles of emaciated corpses. That kind of thing changes a man.”
Tony flinches. "Nobody. So, about Loki-"
“Jesus!” Steve shouted, because he’d seen Tony do it ten, fifteen, thirty times over and it still scared the hell out of him every time.
“I know,” Tony said, sounding amused now. “For science.”
It was very hard to think about anything else after that, especially when Tony tonguefucked him in the shower, and then Steve carried him up to the penthouse, and, well. He could be forgiven, he thought, for forgetting all about the conversation that had started everything. It hadn’t seemed important, in the face of Tony’s undivided attention.
Steve nods. “Howard saved Bucky’s life,” he says, and Tony closes his eyes.
Tony laughs nervously. He stares out at the smoking rubble across the plaza: the crumpled town cars, the limping civilians. “I think the phrase you’d use here would be: ‘not as such.’”
What will I hunt
Steve loosed a skirling whine, hips rocking forward without his consent, and Tony growled straight into his mouth.
Like Steve was suddenly worth something, to Tony. Like he was someone Tony would want to be tied to. He thinks about Tony calling him a
"Sure," Tony says, smiling a little. "But how do you feel about moving downstairs a floor? I'm setting up suites for all the Avengers. When the renovations are done you'll have your own floor, and so will Bruce."
“Remember what I
“You just thought of something,” Tony insists, and Steve quirks a small smile. Tony’s hyper-focussed attention is a beautiful thing. He’s desperately wanted a piece of it for himself for weeks. So of course he’s getting it at the absolute worst time. He’s good at that. Always in the right place at the wrong time.
Because Bruce, too, had tried to make himself better. He’d tried to turn his great and terrible privilege of a mind onto a cure for all mankind, and instead he walked out a monster. He knows what it is to make yourself into a sword and find that there are only sharp edges left, and no guard: dangerous things, who only know how to let the blood of the ones they love.
It helped that Steve hadn’t had much time to explore as a child; being sick all the time and working whenever he was able didn’t leave much for exploration. He remembers the moment he went to the Met for the first time, alone and brimming with expectation. He’d already been in love with fine arts, but his first brush with the classics had left him a goner for anything else he might have dared to pursue. He can still feel the way his breath caught in his throat at the sight of smooth marble, of bone white fingers pressing into skin that dipped under pressure, supple as real flesh to the eye. He can remember his first encounter with Van Gogh, the bright colours and the tangled, whimsical lines crafted by a man wrecked by a world that did not want him, the beauty pulled from anguish like a magician’s unending colourful scarf. He’d walked until his feet ached, until a museum guard came and told him that it was time to leave, still standing open mouthed in front of Degas’ ephemeral ballerinas like he was seeing God for the very first time.

Steve was a fascinating, complicated combination of guilty and avaricious about the bruises he’d left on Tony the first time they’d had sex. He kept ghosting his fingers over them, gentle and adoring, but he’d apologised, too.
He expects Loki to be desperate, or maybe shove him away, and he’s not disappointed. The kiss is less of a kiss than a biting at mouths; a gasping, wet thing with no control, Loki’s hands scrabbling at his shirt buttons before finally just tearing the last few off, pushing the whole thing over his shoulders and climbing into his lap. He’s biting at Tony’s neck, leaving deep, painful bruises that Tony knows he’ll be feeling for days, pulling at Tony’s wrists to force him to cradle Loki’s hips in his hands. He does not need much prompting. He slides his palm up Loki’s abdomen, brushes his thumb over a nipple, tangles his hands in Loki’s thick black waves. Loki sinks down into his lap, grinding them together, and Tony tips his head back and groans.
“Steve-”
"Ignore me," he tells Steve. "What's up?"
The scent was overwhelming. Tony was everywhere in this room, even worse than in the penthouse. More than anywhere else in the tower, the workshop was his space. It was where he sweated, and slept, and breathed. Every single object in the room carried him on it, and Steve nearly went to his knees as soon as he stepped inside. His entire body felt like it shifted out of place, like someone had taken hold of his soul and just moved his body two inches to the left. He felt like he was being torn open, vision swimming so badly he swayed.
More accurately, Steve wasn’t even out. Tony had been outed in the papers when he was a teenager in college, and he’d never tried to hide himself since. He was unabashed. He’d even been called lurid. He was unapologetically himself, all of the time.
He goes through his morning ablutions slowly, luxuriating in silly things that he’d forgotten about. The way warm water feels on his skin. The sweep of his shaving brush over his jaw, the satisfying scrape of a straight razor. The feeling of his tongue sliding over squeaky clean teeth. The joy of scrubbing shampoo into his hair and using his nails a little, massaging his scalp under the hot water. He takes his time getting dressed. Khakis. Good shoes. A button down shirt. He thinks he’ll probably save the exciting stuff for tomorrow. Right now, he wants breakfast. Bacon. Eggs. He sniffs the air, a familiar scent wafting through the elevator doors.
“Fuck him,” Tony mutters. He hisses as Bruce’s fingers hit a particularly bad knot. “Asshole abandoned me in my time of need.”
“Ouch.”
“I do,” Steve says, and it’s true. “It…there’s so much more to learn about him, I know that. But I do.” He laughs a little, brokenly. “Thank you, father.”
By the time he gets home, Steve’s planning to head straight to his rooms and take a shower. He wants to wash off all that airport grime. After washing up he’d like to see Tony, maybe bring him some of the stuff he’s reading. Maybe they can eat dinner together again.
“Is that a hint?”
“I have spent all this time desperately wishing for my brother to come to me, to speak with me even for a moment. Yet he chose you.”
. “If this were any other day I’d lock us up in the penthouse and cancel all my meetings for a week.” Steve lets out a small growl, just loud enough to send a skittering shiver down Tony’s spine. “But I can’t. I have this float, and I won’t really have time, and I want to take you out properly-”
“I’m, uh. I’m gonna go now.”
“Drop the martyr act,” Steve laughed, nudging him with his elbow as he moved into the kitchen. “I just got back from my run. Was thinking omelettes.”
Steve had no idea that was how Tony experienced it. That’s fascinating. Why is the sensation so different for him? Does it have anything to do with Steve sometimes feeling like he’s feeling what Tony is feeling?
Steve shakes his head, jogging in place as he circles back to the park edge and waits for a light. “Thank you, JARVIS,” he says, meaning it. His chest hurts a little, but the truth always does.
“I’m not sure I understand you,” Steve says, slowly, but Pepper is already shaking her head. She slides her purse on her arm, then steps by him and heads towards the door.
There was something slimy and wet in Steve’s stomach, just waking up. He could feel it slithering inside of him, making its slow and steady way up into his throat. “No,” he choked, and it was like watching a tornado take a town. It was horrifying, but he couldn’t look away if he tried.
“And you’ve met Logan, and Scott, and Rogue,” Xavier counters, a bright smile on his face, and Steve laughs because, yeah. Yeah, he has.
“Great,” she deadpanned, and Steve winced. “Now you’re definitely sleeping with Clint.”
“He doesn’t,” Tony says, confidently. It only hurts a little. “He doesn’t even want me.”
,” Steve says, pronouncing the word carefully as though he’s trying to get a feel for it in his mouth.
. He thinks that they may have both miscalculated. He thinks about Loki calling him
“I have lost every round and I am not half as angry,” Thor pointed out, amused. “You should admit that Stark is the better warrior, and concede with honour.”
for us to bond!”
Clint made them both pancakes at 3 PM, claiming that time didn’t matter because they hadn’t gone to sleep until “9 o’ clock in the fucking morning, and even later for you, Cap.” Steve wasn’t complaining. He was ravenous, always was after a long battle. When the pancakes weren’t enough for him, they made their way up to the communal kitchen to raid the fridge. Steve ate his way through: most of a pack of bacon; a four-egg omelette with spinach, sweet peppers, and cheese; a stack of toast; and two glasses of mango-orange juice before he was properly satisfied. At some point Thor wandered out to join them, so Steve had doubled his own portions, knowing Thor ate about as much as he did. Clint had watched them both for a few minutes before shaking his head and pushing away from the kitchen island with a huff.
“There was a statistical possibility, sir, but your chances of being severely injured were also quite high,” JARVIS says, and Tony throws up his hands.
“Hmm, yes,” Tony murmured, and then he was pressing his cock inside, and Steve could barely breathe with how full his mouth was, the way that Tony’s fingers were pressing down on his tongue. “Beautiful.”
Tony stills. He turns around to look at Reed with what Steve can only describe as incredulity.
“Yours,” Steve slurs, and Tony shivers. He leans in, takes Steve’s mouth again.
Steve nods.
One night, he can’t help but kiss Tony while he’s sleeping: slack and sickly pale, dark shadows laying out the shapes of his bones. Tony wakes with Steve’s name on his lips, wide eyed. He touches his mouth, sits up gasping. His eyes are wild in his face.
“Steve,” Natasha said, and Steve turned back to catch her gaze. She looked dangerous, in the way only she knew how, silent and ready for one of the strings in her web to twang in just the right way, to signal the need for an attack. “Tell me to take the gloves off, and I will.”
“I didn’t mean it,” he says firmly, and he hates this, he fucking hates it. That apology should have come from him, not a spell. It’s not real, and Steve deserves better. “But I can’t…I need more time. Okay?”
He imagines Tony’s face softened, his dark-lashed eyes in a rounder cheek, fuller lips. He imagines punching that woman in the face, and discomfort curls into his chest like an eel. He doesn’t know where it comes from. He’s fought female combatants before, hundreds of times. He’s sparred with every female Avenger on the roster. What is that? What is he feeling?
“If you’re sleeping but you’re not feeling rested, then there has to be observable phenomena to corroborate it. Even if the cause is supernatural. Perhaps Steve being active combined with your psychic connection to his spirit is preventing you from reaching true REM sleep. We won’t know until we run some tests, and I’d prefer to do everything at once since I know sleep isn’t always easy for you.”
Steve frowns. “Hang on, I saw a SHIELD shrink and they cleared me for culture shock and PTSD and all that.”
“Negative, Iron-Man, you can’t look for Cap on your own when we don’t know where melty is,” Hawkeye pipes in, followed by agreement from the rest of the team. “Wait for War Machine, we’re on our last doombots here.”
“That’s because he’s- he’s fucking perfect,” Tony spits. His tentacles writhe beneath him, flushing a dark, bloody red. “He tries so hard to be nice to me because he knows that I’m a fucked up mess inside, it’s not-” Tony’s voice breaks, horrifyingly, his eyes stinging. “It’s not
“Copy.”
“There isn’t a single person in this tower that would let that happen, including you,” Steve says sternly, and Tony can’t help but laugh again.
Steve had a weak heart as a kid, along with all of his other problems. He remembers this weakness; the breath curdling in his chest like a liquid, fighting thing, pulse pounding loudly in his ears. He focusses on Tony’s pulse, counting, holding the air in his lungs as his body fights him. It only lasts a few seconds, but it’s enough to make bile rise in the back of his throat. He’d been done with this, he thought. He thought he was done with this.
“Hey,” Clint says, raising his hands, “can you make explosive acid arrows and fund our entire operation? Because if so, you’ve been holding out on me, man. Bro code red card.”
"You touched him," Bruce says, expression somewhere between amused and sceptical.
When he opens his eyes, the sun is bursting bright through the glass wall, and Steve squints uncomprehendingly out into the light of a cloudless blue sky. He’d never seen the sun so high from his room before.
“Only if it’s already on fire. No causing trouble to save people from trouble. We humans are wise to that kind of thing.”
Tony snorted, taking an impertinent swing of his Wolverine Whiskey and turning around to face the door of Stark Enterprises. Sheriff Rogers was leaning in his doorway, broad shoulders limned by the high noon sun.
“But I like the view,” Steve complains, eyes half-lidded and gorgeous, and Tony wants him. He wants him now, again.
“She’s demonstrated that she won’t always put you or the job first.”
“You done?” Steve asks.
Steve is practically vibrating when he gets back to the tower, but as twitterpatted as he is, he’s still a tactician. He knows he’s too keyed up to talk to Tony like a normal person. He’s just as likely to barge into the workshop and just start babbling embarrassing things and quoting scripture at him, which seems more likely to turn Tony off than anything. Instead, he dips quickly into his room to change and then heads back down to the gym. It’s best if he works out some of this tension that’s bubbling up inside of him like light. He feels like he’s glowing from the inside.
“Try that again and you will find yourself in even greater comparison with Tyr,” Loki snarls, thin black lips curling up from his teeth in threat.
“I know.” He points at Bruce. “The other guy’s got Moonstone. She’s pretty hard to keep down, so we don’t have to worry so much about killing her. War Machine will be split between Barnes and doombot patrol. If you take down your target, join me in the compound. There’s a few human combatants inside, nothing I can’t handle, but we have no idea what state Cap is gonna be in when we get there. JARVIS has run scans and thinks he knows where they’re keeping him. The Iron Legion will be running assists wherever they’re needed and to whomever needs them. This is a rescue mission, first and foremost. No heroics, quick and dirty. We’re not working for arrests; SHIELD has no jurisdiction. We’re in, we find Cap, we’re out.”
“This is bullshit,” Clint sniped, but he lifted the mask and fitted it to his face, shifting it until he found a spot he liked before pulling it back off and peeling the film from around the edge. He dropped the wrapping back in the duffel, then put the mask on properly. “I’m only doing this because you assholes are family now, and that breaking the pack up shit scared the fuck out of me.” He turned to Steve, eyes strangely fierce and terrifying with the mask on. “You’re not the only one who cares.”
Pepper’s mouth twitches infinitesimally. “Did you really imply that he was your blue-balled sugar baby?” she asks, and Tony stifles the bout of mad laughter that threatens to escape. If he starts, he may never stop.
“Mhmm.”
“Tony?”
“Sir,” JARVIS says in his ear, and Tony blinks and stills. “The U.N. has reached an accord.”
“I needed a project,” Tony admits, and Stephen glances at Steve, then back to him.
“Because I don’t want to tell you why I hid from the CCTV cameras,” Natasha tells him plainly, and Tony’s eyes snap open wide.
Tony blinks and meets his gaze through clumped lashes, eyes still damp. His pulse jumps in his throat for entirely different reasons, and he slides his hand into the hair at Loki’s nape and holds him there, watching the way his pupils dilate, the way his fingers tighten on Tony’s wrist. When Tony tilts his head slightly to kiss him, soft and chaste, he keeps his eyes open to watch Loki melt into it, his eyes closing as he leans in. He tastes like mountain snow, cold and sweet on the tongue, and his brows furrow in confusion when Tony pulls away.
Steve was patient. He could wait. When he brought it up again, Tony had decried the dangers of their profession. They risked their lives every time they went on a mission. How could Steve expect them to be bonded? It would put the whole team at risk. Steve countered with criticisms of the popular studies on broken bond trauma, with the near irrefutable evidence that a stable bonded pair leading a pack strengthened a pack as a whole, that strong pack ties were linked to efficacy in battle. Steve had felt like he won that one, but Tony was a sore loser and it had only made addressing the issue more difficult the second time. Then, Tony had said he didn’t want to be bound by his biology, and Steve had countered that this was a choice that they could make, not an obligation, and Steve was choosing Tony. Tony hadn’t had anything good to say to that, self-deprecating as always, and so the last fight had ended with a bout of emotional sex that had left them both too raw to look each other in the eyes the following morning. Steve would have called that a tie, but honestly he felt like it was more accurate to say they’d both lost. Neither he nor Tony were very good with emotional vulnerability. He was trying, though. He felt like he was doing marginally better than Tony on that front.
“No,” Tony said, and Steve closed his eyes, desire swimming in his blood like a drug, taking all of his thoughts, his shame.
“I haven’t seen you in months,” Reed says. Even here, when he’s come to Tony with a specific purpose, he comes across as distracted. “You haven’t come by at all. I noticed.” He sounds a little bewildered, even as he’s saying it. “Sue didn’t tell me to come. I came on my own.”
"What did he say?" Coulson interjects, and Tony gestures vaguely.
"He already saved Natasha and fixed Agent's knee." Tony paused. "And me."
“I’m guessing Tony used a stronger word,” Steve drawled, turning back to pick through the detritus.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
“If you look like shite up here, you’ve gotta look sharp elsewhere. Sharks in the water, you know how the game runs.” His expression sours, some remembered battle taking hold of him. Steve watches him shake it off with guilt burrowing pain into his gut. “Beth, babe, you here somewhere?”
“The sentiment is quite mutual, sir.”
“Did you know I almost quit when Tony became Iron Man?”
They’d gotten dinner at Jack’s Wife Frieda, then cannoli at Pasticceria Rocco. Tony had long held that they were the best in the city, and Steve couldn’t disagree. Their server, bless him, had taken one look at the two of them and set them up in the back, around the corner and up against the brick wall. It was a table well away from the prying eyes of the rest of the customers. There, Tony could speak freely about the recent upgrades to the armour, about MJ’s most recent photoshoot with Vogue Italia, about the new rollout of the StarkPads that was set for next week but the specs were driving him crazy. He looked so happy, and Steve had grinned and let him talk himself out, sipping at his coffee and demolishing an entire plate of cream puffs, one delicious, buttery-sweet bite after another.
,” Steve Rogers says from uncomfortably close to him, and Tony blinks burning eyes open in alarm, rolling away from him instinctively only to end up in blinding pain as he falls to the floor in a heap. For two delirious beats he can’t process anything but agony and glaring white light, but then the lights dim, and he can blink his eyes open to polished black stone shot through with geometric white lines, a low blue glow shimmering from a far wall of painted glass. Bruce is kneeling in front of him, and Tony blinks at him once, twice, before throwing his arms around Bruce’s neck.
, he thinks, swiping idly through another holoscreen full of Loki and Amora’s readings, he could really punch something right about now.
“Tony, listen to me,” he pleads. He closes his eyes for a moment, brows furrowing as he sends up a quiet prayer to whoever is listening. When he opens his eyes, Tony is watching him, wary as a feral cat. “If you don’t want to do this, I- I’m not the kind of man to go where he isn’t wanted. I think you know that. But I think you do want it. I think you’re scared, and that’s okay. I’m scared, too. It’s okay to be scared. But you have to talk to me. You have to tell me where you’re at, so I can meet you there, Tony.” He takes a heavy breath, letting it fill his lungs. His mind spins dizzily, whether from the influx of oxygen or the thundering pace of his heart, he doesn’t know. “I can’t- I don’t want to keep stepping on landmines. I don’t like being shouted at for things I don’t understand, but more importantly, I hate hurting you. That’s not what I want. That’s never what I want. But you have to tell me, Tony. You have to talk to me. I will meet you, Tony, wherever you’re at, but you have to help me. You have to help me get there.”
“Mr. Stark’s computer does not manage Miss Potts’ schedule, Captain Rogers. I do.”
Heyyy, check it out: an update that's not interminably long after the last one! Look at me go.
“Do not die,” Loki says, simple, and Tony laughs. The jet lowers, slowly, passing through Loki’s portal without incident. War Machine follows it down.
Tony looks up. Steve’s face is wan, his eyes wide. He sucks in a breath, then turns and pulls a washcloth from the sink cabinet. He runs it under a hot tap in the sink. His jaw is tight with suppressed emotion when he turns and kneels down in front of Tony’s chair.
"Please don't, sir."
“Cap, inside, now,” Tony says into the comm, not projecting his voice externally. He watches as Cap steels himself, then his body language shifts. Steve Rogers shakes his head stubbornly. “Cap, you stubborn ass, you and Natasha and go inside.”
"Yes," Cap and Loki say at the same time. "We're almost done here. Loki, why don't you show yourself and we can talk?"
Steve had watched Tony flip his red AA chit back and forth over his knuckles for twenty minutes, helpless, angry. He’d eventually managed to catch Tony’s fingers in his own, which had startled the man enough that he jerked upright, the chip falling from his fingers and rolling to a stop on the floor. Then he’d called Carol, and she’d come over, and Tony had pulled out a little brown paper bag full of airtight canisters that Steve had never seen before. All these years, and he doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony get high like this. He’s seen Tony already intoxicated, but watching this process feels unbearably intimate. Something about the look of it twists in his gut like an eel, desire and hurt curling over each other into this messy thing that aches and aches. He knows he shouldn’t be here for this. Carol was Tony’s go-to when he was having problems with Steve. It had been that way since the War, and he expects that it will continue to be so long into the future. Carol understands parts of Tony that Steve never has, parts that aren’t wholly encapsulated by the shared meaning of the chips they both carry with them, but are certainly representative of it. Carol or Tony might say that they are both fucked up in the same way: stubborn bastards with complex pasts, whose worst enemy is themselves. That was what Tony had said to Steve once, anyhow, when Steve had asked him about it. Maybe he’d been a little jealous. Nobody could prove anything.
"Aren't I?" Tony gestures around the room. "I kept you talking in here long enough to get a new suit after your little stunt on the helicarrier smashed the one I was wearing to sparks and scrap." He turns back to face Loki, his mouth set in a broad smile. "You picked me because you think I'm clever, didn't you?"
“The parade is in less than two weeks,” Tony says, but it’s not a complaint.
“I don’t care,” Steve said, and that much was true enough. Tony shut his mouth with an audible click, eyes skittering towards Steve’s and away again. “I love you. I want to be with you. There is nothing you could say to me right now beyond telling me that you don’t want me that could make me change my mind. And even then, I don’t think I’d believe you.”
“I know.” Tony takes a deep breath, lets it out. He thinks of Rhodey’s handsome face twisted in disappointment, the thin slash of Pepper’s mouth when she’s supressing a hurt. He remembers the way Loki had melted from defence to gentleness at a word. “I’m sorry.”
“You forced my hand,” Tony says, but his smile is wry, now. Something fond and potent that he doesn’t want to put a name to swells in his chest. “Thank you. Thank you so much. You have- well. No.” He laughs, disbelieving, smoothing a shaking hand over his face. “God. You do have an idea of what you did. You know exactly how important what you did for us is. For every enhanced, maybe, everywhere.”
“You shouldn’t be drinking this,” Natasha says, frowning at Clint with her eyebrows. It’s a skill he hasn’t quite perfected, despite Tony’s valiant attempts and impassioned attestations to the power of his ‘judgy face.’
Steve shrugs. He glances across the street at the basketball court tucked into the corner, then sighs, because of course he doesn’t have…
He knows why Tony always keeps his eyes closed when they are intimate together, but it still hurts. He wants nothing more than to see Tony’s stormy blue eyes trained on him as his lover comes apart under his hands.
“Sure, but the last time
“Eat,” she says, sparing him a telling look, and Tony grins feebly while his stomach reminds him that he’s had nothing but coffee and a smoothie since last night. “There’s pot stickers, too.”
He can feel Steve stiffen, hear the sharp intake of breath in the darkness. “Oh.”
Tony looks down, swallows once. When he opens his eyes again, they’re gem bright with tears. A bevy of shutters go off, and Steve can’t blame them. Tony is the perfect image of subtle, tasteful grief.
“Jeez,” he says, and Tony barks a laugh at how familiar and dear the exclamation is. “I think I’d even prefer flying to that.”
“Wait, that wasn’t-”
Tony’s stepping back out into the garage before Steve can grab him, his heart pounding double time in his chest. Steve won’t follow him, he knows; there had been an incredibly noticeable wet spot on the front of his slacks, and there’s no way he’s going to walk out into the throng of SI employees with a fresh jizz stain in his crotch.
“Thank you,” he rasped, clenching down on the cool slate countertop for a brief second before pulling back. He’d broken marble, before, and slate was an even softer stone. He didn’t want to repay Clint’s kindness by ruining his kitchen.
“Yeah, so Cap can roll over me like a fucking tank? More than he apparently
Tony raises his eyebrows. "Wow,” he says, and means it. “This is too much emotional honesty for…what time is it, even? I've been awake for coming up on three days now." He rubs at his eyes, laughing quietly. "What the fuck."
“You don’t have control,” Tony says, spreading his hands. “You want us to build our headquarters in Burundi? We can do that, but the next time someone tries to turn the Empire State Building to rubble, don’t count on us for an emergency response.” He glances around the table, gauging responses. “Come on, we all know how this goes. You push too far, we’ll just leave, and no one will be happy about it. Build it, and they will come, am I right? And boy have I got the money to build it.”
“God, how long’s it been?” Tony murmurs, but Bruce’s expression is weary, searching.
“What did you see?” Tony asks, shivering when Loki drags one hand across the sensitive join of hip and thigh, fingers idling along the crease.
“Fair’s fair,” he explains.
Steve looks at him with a gentle kind of sadness, like he can read everything that Tony isn’t saying in his eyes. He tugs him close and presses a soft kiss to his brow. “I had a great time, Shellhead. I’d love to do something like it again, if that’s something you want. If that’s something we can do. Always ask me for what you want. Okay?”
“You could ask Captain Rogers why he has chosen to remove himself from the situation, instead of speculating.”
“They keep bringing me these broken white boys,” Shuri sighs, and Tony offers her a wry smile. “At least I know you.”
“Hey, J?” Tony calls, turning off the water and wrapping himself in a towel.
“You were going to suggest something else,” Stark prodded, but Fury shook his head.
“What do you think?” Steve asks, eyes crinkling as a wicked grin overtakes him. Tony’s mouth is moving, but no words are coming out, instead just gaping open and closed like a fish. “Hmm. Did I finally shut off that gorgeous brain of yours?”
“I missed you, too,” Steve chuckles, shaking his head a little. “I probably scared everyone, didn’t I?”
Tony is elbow deep in machine oil and grease when the tower alert for a bifrost deposit starts up. His last suit had gotten trashed in an AIM scuffle, more for numbers than any sort of skill on their part, but it still meant the same amount of repairs. Honestly, Tony was tempted to tell SHIELD they all needed a break and not to bother them with stupid shit, but he knows that Hulk and Cap both get restless with nothing to do. With Loki seemingly out of the fun and nuisance racket, they had to settle for the more boring calls.
Steve’s not sure what he was imagining would be waiting for him when he arrived at JFK, but it certainly wasn’t a town car waiting to drive him back to the tower. The man at the wheel isn’t Happy Hogan, although he supposes that Hogan has better things to do. He isn’t quite sure what Hogan actually does for SI. As far as Steve has seen, Hogan’s job mostly seems to be standing there with an amused, exasperated, or long-suffering expression while either Pepper Potts or Tony berate him or each other about something that isn’t really his fault.
“Tony…”
They still haven’t talked.
The professor studies him for a moment, a small smile playing around the corners of his mouth. He looks empathetic, but Steve feels a little like he’s being laughed at. “Alright,” he says. “Let’s return to what your friend said. Do you think you can tell me why it bothers you, now?”
,” he says, “which is different.”
Tony hops into his seat and starts the car, fingers drumming on the wheel. Aerosmith is blasting from the stereo, and Pepper rolls her eyes at the volume level and turns it down a notch. Or six.
“Let me take care of you,” Steve burrs on screen, and Steve takes a shaky breath in.
“Alpha,” Steve said, brokenly, and then he was crying. “Alpha,
something wrong.”
“You chose to stay down here for over 24 hours and not eat. You can wait two minutes to wash your hands properly.”
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, and Tony blinks himself back into the world rapidly, eyes struggling to focus. Steve’s voice is shaky, slightly overwhelmed. “Tony, I…”
? Are you
“Great,” Steve says. “Bruce and Clint it is. God, this is a mess.”
Pepper stares at him for a long moment, mouth pursed, eyes narrowing, before she finally sighs and pushes her hair over her shoulder. “Pass me the fusilli.” Tony does, locking eyes with a calculating Loki before turning his gaze back to Pepper. “I’ll take care of Maria, but you need to sort out this thing with SHIELD. They’re a mess, and the government is going to come down on us if we don’t get our house in order, Tony. We’ve gotten away with a lot because the court of public opinion loves you, but that may not always be the case. The D.O.D. is breathing down my neck again. We need to be united in the message we’re putting out.
Steve huffs. “Not Pepper. She’s Tony’s, and no one else’s.”
He shrugged, and began pulling things out. Tony didn’t really like vegetables, but he made himself eat them after all the trauma his body had been through. Steve was glad that he was trying to take care of himself, but he didn’t like the way Tony approached food, like it was fuel for an engine. He did his best to make things that Tony liked that were still healthy: egg white kale and spinach omelettes, yoghurt with fruit, whole wheat toast with nut butter. If Steve let him, he’d drink those horrific sludge-green smoothies all day.
“Command?” Tony repeats, and Loki chuckles, the vibrations moving all through Tony’s torso. “I definitely wouldn’t say that.”
Tony shrugs, raising an eyebrow as he shoves a piece of pilfered brownie into his mouth. It’s still probably too hot for the average mortal, but Tony had killed off those nerves in his mouth long ago with buckets of scalding coffee. He watches Clint cut his dough and lay it into pie tins while he chews. The chocolate is warm and gooey in his mouth, with just the right about of chewy. When he swallows, warm chocolate sticks to the roof of his mouth like glue.
Tony thinks sardonically.
“Well, that’s not true,” Tony says, rolling his eyes. He takes a sip of his drink. “So, Loki and I have been fucking.”
Five days is less time than Tony thought it would be, and he's been dreading it every single minute since he's been sober enough to know it was coming. Tony's elbow-deep in armour guts with little nicks and burns all over his skin, doing his best not to think about Steve at all. He's decided he's going to make the armour come to him, no matter where he is. The locator cuffs are chic, but they can be taken from him, forgotten, left on his bedside table. He needs something that will always find him. So he's always ready.
“God, your cock is a work of art,” Tony hums, and Steve splutters a half-laugh above him.
“Tony,” he burrs, and the deep timbre of his voice injects warmth straight into Tony’s spine, sure as a drug. “God.”
“Mm.” Reed pulls up another graph, then arranges them for comparison. Whatever it is they’re seeing makes Tony frown even harder. “What I mean to say is that you hold yourself in lower esteem than you do Steve. You put Steve on a pedestal.”
“Thank you,” Steve had said, firm enough for there to be no mistaking his meaning, but Clint had just waved him off and gone to watch Dog Cops. Tony was gonna be pissed about that, later. That was his and Clint’s show.
“If he had, I wouldn’t tell you, Captain.” JARVIS’ voice is disapproving, and Steve shakes his head.
“I can handle him,” Clint grumbles.
“I might.”
“No,” Steve says, and Tony nods. “I’m not…I’m not sorry, for the fight. Not really.”
, he thinks. He rolls onto his side, pulling the pillow over his head into his chest and hugging it against himself.
“I just thought I was done making things harder for you,” Pepper says, putting her face in her hands. Tony rubs at her shoulders, not really sure what he’s doing here. “After Killian, I told myself I would never be such a…such a damsel, God, that was so embarrassing, Tony, you have no idea-”
“No, it is I who should apologise,” JARVIS says. He sounds frustrated, which makes Tony’s chest ache all over again. “You wish him to…appreciate you in this form for the sake of it, and not simply endure it because he loves you. Because you are aroused by it. And you think he will find your desires repulsive. Is that correct?”
“Wouldn’t it be more shocking if I was loyal, if I stayed true to you and only you?” Loki simpers, eyes crinkled with mirth. Tony rolls his eyes in the most exaggerated way possible.
“Gorgeous, filthy slut,” Tony tells him fondly, and Steve pinks, whining into Tony’s chest. “God, look at you take it. You want it so bad. Next time I’ll turn you over, bend you over the side of the tub and spread you open so I can watch-”
He gets as far as the emergency stairwell before he begins to feel…strained, maybe. His hands begin to glimmer before his eyes, like he’s losing the ability to hold his shape. He takes another step, testing, and his whole body shifts, nauseatingly, a ripple wave of terribleness that starts at his feet and rolls all the way up to his head.
Tony licks his lips and steps into the shower, pulling the glass closed behind him as a clear barrier between them. The water is hot enough to redden his skin, dried blood swirling around the drain as he tips his head under the rush of the waterfall spout. He closes his eyes and lets the water run over them.
“Faster,” Steve tells him, then closes his eyes and groans in bliss when Tony does just that. “God, perfect. Come on. Come, Tony, I want-”
“No,” Steve admits, brow furrowing. “I guess it isn’t.”
“Loki swore to me that he would not harm my people. The Avengers were included in that, and Thor is an Avenger.” Tony’s eyes are wide, almost crazy. “Everything, everything between us, all our plans, hinge on the fact that Thor told us that Asgardian mages have to keep their promises, and Loki just broke his word.”
“I didn’t ask you to do that,” Tony says. He sounds…not good. Steve shuffles a little closer. “And I know this wasn’t your idea, Goldilocks, so don’t even try covering for him.”
“Tony’s not an omega,” Steve snapped, and Bruce glanced up at them, startled.
“Sir. The Captain is waiting on the penthouse’s landing pad.”
So I know this was only supposed to have five chapters, but there's a whole two more sections after this and it's already almost 10k. It seemed silly to put it all in one, so I've broken it into two.
“Tony, Ross is a pitbull. More importantly, he’s the Secretary of State. You shouldn’t be baiting him like that.”
Eventually, Tony lies boneless in one of the rolling chairs he uses to scoot around the workshop. His eyes are wide in his face, breath still coming in pants. Steve is collapsed over him, straddling his lap, head braced on his shoulder. He traces lazy patterns over the starburst that faintly graces Tony’s sternum. He presses his palm flat to the skin, tries to feel for a heartbeat. Unnervingly, he isn’t able to feel it. It makes his heart stutter in his chest, and he presses closer. He tucks his face into Tony’s neck.
Steve glances towards the grand staircase, where Pepper Potts is walking down with her usual poise, fiddling with a StarkPad. She’s wearing an alarmingly red suit and skirt combo, with gold jewellery and matching heels, and Steve knows a declaration of allegiance when he sees it. He dips his head in greeting.
“Take me to bed and I’ll fuck you so hard your immortality will leak out your ears,” Tony blurts out, which doesn’t make much sense but, well. Fourteen. That’s about on par for how he feels right now.
Steve’s arms were up before he even consciously processed the request, hands slipping around Tony’s shoulders to crush them together. He pressed his face into Tony’s neck, mouthing at his alpha’s bondmark, and Tony groaned so forcefully Steve almost wondered if he’d hurt him. Tony leaned back and turned his head blindly, catching Steve’s mouth in a bruising kiss, and Steve melted into him, moaning. Tony’s hands slipped down his back, fingers questing for the dip above his arse, the dimples there that he loved so much. He fit his fingertips to the hollow in Steve’s spine, tracing a back-arching line of heat up to the nape of his neck, fingers clenching in Steve’s hair as Tony took his mouth. His tongue pressed inside: measured, claiming, hungry. He sucked Steve’s lower lip into his mouth, dragging his teeth over it so slow and sharp that it felt like he’d found a direct line to Steve’s cock.
“Yeah, ok, point taken.” He stretches, rolling his neck back. “But if you are, Steve’s not a great pillow. Too…hard. And Loki’s too bony, so they both lose.”
“You didn’t want to bond. You resisted me at every turn, because you didn’t think it was possible. That’s why we went into my heat with no protection, why you said you could control yourself. You thought it wouldn’t matter if you bit me. If I- if I marked you. You didn’t think it would take.” Steve was crying now, but he couldn’t stop it; great, fat tears rolling down his face, and he knew that he was an ugly crier. His Irish blood made him get all blotchy and red. He was a disaster, and Tony was pressed up so close to the glass he looked like he wanted to break through it, but there was nothing either of them could do. The room was Hulk-proof, and they’d put him in there for a reason.
“No,” Tony hedges, but Steve just shakes his head.
“I guess I’m getting up,” he says, feeling wrung-out and beat to hell. “Might as well head down to the workshop if I’m gonna be wasting my time.”
“I’d prefer to observe your natural electroencephalographic readings before we venture into altered states.”
Steve felt like he lost hours like that. All that he could process was the steady encroachment of Tony’s cock, the bittersweet taste of him, the warmth of his skin. Tony’s hands were buried in his hair, not holding him down, just there as he rocked his hips slowly but surely in and out, in and out. Steve lost himself to the rhythm of it, moaning when he was able, letting himself be used by his alpha. And all the while, of course, Tony was talking, murmuring filthy things as he fucked him.
“Thanks,” Tony manages.
, he thinks, but it isn’t anything to fuss over. He’s had enough anxiety for the day.
“I’m so sorry,” Bruce says, shaking his head.
“And your mind,” Thor retorts, moving to stand. “I know I have never been a match for Loki. And all this…” He waves a hand around the workshop, helplessly. “Your science unnerves me, Tony Stark. This you know. It is so unlike that of home, and even if it were, magic has never been my art.”
Tony was laughing now, a bitter, nasty thing that made Steve think of empty bottles of vodka and a cold bed. “You met my old man,” he said, grinning wide and cruel. “What did he think of omegas, Steve? Did he think they were powerful, on their own? Equipped to run Stark Industries? Qualified, in the eyes of the American public?”
Rhodey lets out a huff of controlled laughter that only Tony can hear, sitting next to him, and he bumps his knee against Rhodey’s under the table.
“What’s going on?” Banner asks, walking up behind Tony. He’s holding his meagre possessions in his hands, eyes flicking nervously between them. He’s expecting violence, Steve knows. He knows how this looks.
him. Not really. He can’t stop himself from being around Tony, so he hovers, awkward, around the periphery of any room they’re in together. His hands are always curled into fists. He’s trying so hard, but Tony knows that all he knows how to do is make Steve furious. And there’s nothing he can do about it. This is who he is, regardless of Steve’s old-fashioned ideas of what his mate ought to be. He’s not willing to change, to make himself smaller: more demure, more sweet, more accommodating. He’s stealth, for chrissakes. His dynamic is hidden on his state ID. He’s the epitome of everything Steve hates about the future.
“Uh.” Tony turned his head to glance at the oven clock, and Steve tried not to grumble at the loss of his mouth. “Half an hour? An hour if I use the suit.”
“A ghost called you a jerk in American Morse code,” Peter says flatly. This his face changes, contorting through guilt, horror, and chagrin. “Oh, God. And we were just…”
“I can and I will. He’ll shadow you.”
“Not really,” he admitted. He grabbed a banana from the fruit bowl, peeling it and glancing over the headlines spread out on the kitchen island. He took a few bites and turned the arts section over. “Anything interesting?”
"Man, shut up."
“Let’s table Barnes for now,” Rhodey says, leaning forward. “What aren’t you telling us?”
My father sat up in the coffin and was alive again.
He does his best to breathe. “The March on Kreischberg would have been impossible, without his help. Howard, when I knew him, was…funny, and curious, and a…just, a good guy, if a bit strange. So it’s hard for me, to imagine him like that. Angry. Bitter.” He chances a tremulous half-smile, self-deprecating and angry. It’s directed inwards. “Violent.”
The real issue is that unfortunately, Tony can’t avoid Steve forever.
“This is a fine mess you’ve gotten yourself into, Stevie.”
, you fuckers!”
“Tony, what is going on?” Steve asks, looking bewildered and hurt and angry in turns, and Tony can’t. He doesn’t understand what’s going on.
“JARVIS, fire all.”
“How much longer?” he asked, folding his book in his lap.
“I dunno,” Rogers drawled, easy-like. “Sometimes you can be a bit of a layabout.”
“Steve can hear me, correct?” he asks Maria.
“Why are you here, Captain?” He leans back in his chair, folds his hands in front of him. “What do you hope to get out of these sessions?”
“Tony,” Steve said, frowning, and Tony offered him a pained grimace.
“There, I’m done,” Steve says, smiling at him. “That’s my speech.”
It seems trite to think it now, but Ty had been different. Ty had known intimately what it was like to suck on a silver spoon all your life and still feel like everything was spinning out of your control, like nothing you did mattered to anyone. Ty had made him believe that he was going to be Tony’s forever. Even on the days when Ty had been a shithead and it was clear that the relationship was doomed to fail, Tony had imagined a future that vaguely resembled what Barton and Romanov have; friends, even after the amicable break up, because their stories are so closely aligned it’s impossible to imagine ever meeting someone else whose broken edges might match up. He’d imagined that Ty would be someone he could always rely on. Tony had been foolish, then: young, and easily swayed by Ty’s perfectly coiffed aesthetic and porcelain smile. In retrospect, Tony had been lucky. He doesn’t think Ty would have stayed loyal even if Tony had Bonded with him, and the last thing in the world he wanted to do was follow in the steps of Maria Stark, bless her soul. Turing forbid Tony had thrown his whole life away like that for a noxious young love.
“Shuri?” Tony prompts, and Bruce grins down at him. It’s the first smile he’s seen since he woke up in this strange new world.
“Sir, I’m not sure I understand why you are keeping this secret from the team.”
A familiar figure appears silhouetted in the glass pane, and Tony has the barest moment to gather himself at the sight before Captain America is shouldering his way into the burnt out boutique. A hand reaches up and pulls the cowl back, and then Steve is on him in the next second, his hands coming up to cup the sides of the armour’s neck.
“Tony,” Steve hisses, caging Tony in with his body, and that’s really very nice. “Please tell me this isn’t just sex.”
Loki narrows his eyes, head tilting as he examines him. "I believe you," he says solemnly. Tony bares his teeth. "That is not my aim, no."
Tony takes a series of comprehensive x-rays and promises to review the data and send it over securely as soon as he can. When he climbs up out of Grand Central, the air is muggy and dead. It’s properly summer in New York now, and getting into the cool metal of the suit is extremely satisfying on his sticky skin. He rolls his shoulders inside the metal, arching into it a little.
“Wow,” Clint snorts, “cool slang, grandpa.” Steve rolls his eyes.
Tony takes pity on him. He tips Steve’s chin up with one finger until they’re face to face. He brushes their noses together, then kisses him.
"I trust you," he says, which, wow. Tony was not expecting that. "If you think we can trust him, then I'm willing to follow your lead." His face hardens. "For now."
But I think you were born before my father,
“Steve, leave,” he says, and Tony lets out a rough breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“I do my best.”
Natasha was sitting cross-legged on the mats when he walked into the gym. Her expression was serene, and Steve smiled ruefully at her. He was nothing if not predictable.
“Tony,” Cap says again, caught between bewildered and joyous, and Tony grins at him, still approaching like he’s dealing with a feral animal.
When he opens his eyes, his hands are holding Tony tighter than he meant to. The vicious satisfaction on his face almost pushes Steve over again, but he can see the tremble of pain underneath it. He looses his grip, takes a breath. Then another.
“I’ve been…reading,” he says, and Tony raises his eyebrows. “About omega rights, and the anti-dynamic movement.”
“Maybe,” he allows. “But so far he’s made good on his word. It’s like Tony said; this would be a long game, even for him. I just wish we had a little more transparency.”
He thinks, perhaps, Tony wanted Carol to be in charge of the Avengers so she couldn’t stop him from self-destructing down here. She’s too busy to run the team and shore up the superhero community’s crumbling morale and also make sure Tony eats three square meals a day. Jim’s been busy too, filling in for him. FRIDAY does her best, but there’s only so much an AI can do.
She’s looking at Tony with the kind of horror that most people save for roadkill and slasher films. Her fingers are pale against the Staff of One except for where they’re stained with her own blood, rust-coloured and flaking against her chapped skin. Tony can sympathise. He’s pretty mortified himself.
,” Steve says. He’s crying, and it’s his own damn funeral, and he’s right here. He’s less than twenty feet from Tony’s untouchable, tear-tracked face. “Tony, you stupid, beautiful bastard.”
“Damn it,” Tony says, smoothing a hand over his mouth. “Is he making the puppy dog eyes? Please tell me he’s not making the puppy dog eyes.”
Steve nodded, letting the water run over his face. This was exactly the kind of thing Tony had been worried about, when Steve had first brought up the idea of bonding. Being bonded meant that your individual well-being was inextricably tied to someone else. Being separated from Tony this week had left him off-kilter, his hormones unsteady. He knew after all this Tony would blame himself, but he’d been right that morning; Steve could have gone down to the workshop and pestered him more if he’d really needed it. The truth was, he’d gotten lazy. They hadn’t had a mission in two weeks, and Steve had been concentrating on his own things this week. He’d even taken the bike down to spend a day with Sam, finally getting to see that exhibit at the Smithsonian on “Gods and Heroes” by a Salish artist that he’d been trying to get to for a month. While Tony had gone on an engineering binge, pumping out a prototype for near-silent chopper blades for the army and trying to finish a new suit build, Steve had been catching up on his own stuff. Sure, he’d missed Tony, but it was rare for them to get downtime like this. He’d been enjoying it while it lasted.
“Like a fool.”
“Tony,” Cap says, his voice like gravel, and Tony continues his slow approach.
“Are you making inappropriate sexual advances on a woman who works in Legal?” Pepper deadpans, and Tony grins brightly at her, then at Joyce.
“Stark!” Amora screams, suddenly audible everywhere at once, and Tony turns back to her just in time to be hit in the chest with an electrical bolt. Her eyes are a blazing white-green, hair floating around her as though she’s underwater. She looks terrifying, energy crackling along her skin in bright waves, and Tony takes a split second to curse magic as he drags himself up. Amora hits him again, this time in the face, and Tony sees nothing but black for a second as the impact tumbles him back a few feet.
“Should I be worried?” he asks, pulling the fridge open. “You’ve confessed your weakness, Ms. Potts.”
“You have a problem.”
“Does this mean that you are only bound to your interpretation of a promise?” Tony demands. “If you don’t deem something as harm, it doesn’t matter? What’s harm? Is death harm? What if you hobble me so that I can’t walk? Is it not harm because I have access to prosthetics that can circumvent paralysis?”
Steve let out a sharp bark of laughter. “Oh my god,” he said. He fisted the fabric in his hands, incredulity still building in him, laughter tumbling out of his mouth like marbles. It felt like he hadn’t laughed in days. “Oh, god. He’s such a maniac.”
Tony’s face softened, his hands cupping Steve’s cheeks. “Shh, sweetheart, no. It’s okay, it’s not your fault. I just want to get outside for a bit. Even if it’s just the balcony. Can we try the penthouse, first, and see how you feel?”
“Depression takes many forms, Captain; excessive exercise, difficulty sleeping, lack of attention towards previous interests, irritability…” The professor shrugs expansively. “There is a misconception that functionality must be impeded, but sometimes high functionality can be symptomatic too. If one just robotically goes through the motions of their day and creates a mindless routine to follow, it’s entirely possible to be high-functioning and terrifically depressed. I think a recklessness in battle and an over-commitment to dangerous work speaks for itself.”
“I know how to square breathe,” Tony gripes, but follows Loki’s breath anyway. His pulse is thundering in his ears, almost too loud to hear. He feels like he’s going to be sick. “Fuck. You did this on purpose.”
“Oh, oh,
He hopes that day is a long, long way away from now.
“Because this is a movie about how the marginalised people behind great and powerful men never get the recognition they deserve,” Pepper tells him, and Tony’s resulting laugh is the most genuine expression of contentment or joy Steve has seen him wear in days.
“Ugh,” Tony says. More brain scans. But he goes, because the world keeps turning, and they need him for the good fight. “Alright. Let’s do this thing.”
“Well,” he groans to himself, “that didn’t go so well.”
“Wasn’t once enough?” Tony sobs, and Carol just rocks him back and forth, silent tears leaking from her eyes. “I barely survived the first time-”
"Never mind. Am I meeting you somewhere, or am I just supposed to chase you until I tap out?"
“A wise choice, Sir.”
Tony huffs. All the fight goes out of him. “What do you want me to do about it now?” he asks. His voice is shaking. He looks completely wrung dry, and Steve reaches a hand out, and presses two shaking fingers to the jutting ankle bone beneath the hem of Tony’s pants. And there, beneath his fingertips: warm, papery thin skin.
After, it had taken them hours to get them out. The rubble was so terrifyingly unstable, and Tony’s concussion had made it difficult to be his usual hyper-intelligent self. Bruce and JARVIS had worked together to tell Steve and Thor exactly what to move and how to move it, until finally Tony was revealed, and then the girl. He’d made sure to be the first one to clasp Tony’s gauntlet, to pull him up and out of the wreckage. He’d made sure that he was smiling when he did.
“Not just-” Steve stops himself just in time. He trails off, then laughs a little helplessly. He stares down at his hands.
“I would hypothesize that he does want you, and there is some internal reasoning that prevents him from acting on his desires.”
Steve shrugs, glancing back into his now empty bowl. “Just normal people writing about their own experiences—omegas, and, uh. Trans-natured people? Blogs, I think they’re called? There’s this website where people talk about this stuff a lot, called Tumblr-”

“Steve wasn’t particularly interested in honours. His conviction—that he was right, damn it, no matter whether he was giving me hell over which show to put on the television or about the intricacies of government policy—did not come from arrogance. Although it wasn’t always easy for me to remember that when we were arguing.” The audience titters, and Tony quirks a small, sad smile. His hand comes up to grip the podium, white-knuckled.
“It’s nothing,” Steve says stiffly. “I’m sorry.”
Tony’s throat closes. He blinks his eyes open. “Bruce,” he says, helplessly.
“So there
he keeps saying.
Tony nods, then drags himself out of bed.
“You can’t fucking know,” Tony grates out, rubbing a hand over his face. “You- you have no idea what it was like, growing up in that house and then seeing you and god, I wanted to
"Something like that."
“Tony,” Steve says, blushing even pinker. How cute. “I didn’t- I just meant to call you, I didn’t know there, uh. I’m so sorry, I’ll go put on a shirt-”
“That’s some good square mile of wilderness you’re aiming to search, Mister Stark,” Cage said, shaking his head, but Tony was already pulling on his gloves.
“I was unsure if you would be able to wait that long.”
“Why Captain, are you propositioning me?” Tony drawls, and Steve huffs a laugh. Warm air skates over the nape of Tony’s neck, sending a delicious shiver down his spine.
“Colossus,” Steve murmurs, involuntary, and Tony’s eyes snap to him. Steve tilts forward, suddenly desperate now that Tony’s looking at him. He needs to make him understand. “I look at you in the morning with a circuit board imprinted on your face and grease stained up through your eyebrow and you’re still the most beautiful thing I’ve seen this side of the ice,” Steve says, begging Tony to believe him, but he realises his mistake as soon as Tony begins to shut down. The scoff he looses is venomous.
“Thor’s out and not picking up,” Tony says, and Steve lets out a breath that’s more growl than anything else.
“Okay,” Steve whispered, and let himself be led. He didn’t know what else there was to do.
“You know me so well, baby.” He spins around in his chair, once, twice, before pushing off and sliding across the room to the armour rigging. “Alright, now let’s get you all fixed up.”
A half smile quirks up one corner of Steve’s mouth, although he can taste how bitter it is. “Tony, you remember what I said when I heard Hasegawa was dead?”
What he knew for sure was this: omegas were stronger than anyone gave them credit for, and supposedly felt pain more than anyone else did, and he didn’t know if he was the kind of omega who was strong enough to weather this kind of pain.
One more to go, y’all.
“Hush,” Tony says. He kisses Steve’s chest, right over where his heart should be. “I called Stephen because I wanted you to not have to feel like this. Nothing happened.”
“Can you give me a hand?”
is a good one. There was a major cultural revolution happening in Berlin right before the rise of the Reich. A bunch of prominent leftist thinkers, openly gay poets and theologians. Of course, then the Nazis showed up and murdered every single one of them, so.”
Pepper presses her lips together. She spears Tony with a searing look. “I am going to regret this.”
“Chase, do
“No,” he whispers.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He swallows. “Where will you go?”
Steve nods, slowly. He raises an eyebrow at her, because Carol knows him well enough to know what he’s asking: He’s avoiding me, isn’t he?
He sucks in a deep breath, and the lack of burn in his throat more than anything is what pulls him from it. Once again, he is back in his body, his own mind.
“Tony,” Steve says, helplessly. He puts an arm around Tony, careful not to go through his shoulders. “Come on, don’t do this to yourself.”
“So they don’t have you teaching history?”
“Right.” Tony wipes a hand over his face. “Uh. Communal brunch? Why?”
“You are such a little shit,” Tony says, and then he leans down and takes one of Steve’s nipples into his mouth, because that’s enough talking, thank you very much.
“Is that my welcome home?”
“Clint and I could-”
“Well,” Bruce said, and Steve’s gaze snapped back to him, thanking God that the scientist was absorbed in data and not paying attention to his and Tony’s flirtations, “there’s no recorded evidence of an omega-omega bond. But there are stories.”
“I did mention it,” he said, and Steve swallowed at the considering timbre of his voice. He felt called out, somehow. A shadow passed over Tony’s face, then, and he took a deep breath. He set his glass down on the kitchen island, moving to put distance between them.
A soft, pained noise looses from Rogers’ mouth, but Tony isn’t looking at him. He’s watching Bruce’s face as it sets into a stiff, determined kind of expression.
“I see,” Steve says, because he knows Tony. Tony’s favourite things are engineering, caffeine, flying, alcohol, and sex: not necessarily in that order. “I don’t think that’s really how espionage works.”
“Don’t go, Tony, we want stories!”
He plasters on a smile and takes a bite of toast. The bread tastes like ash in his mouth.
“Stay,” Steve tells him. “I’ll get us some food, and then we’ll clean up a bit. God forbid Stephen shows up and the bathroom looks like this.”
good. All of the Avengers, each and every one of them, are better people than Steve could even begin to express. “Steve had a luminous quality that could be wholly attributed to the strength of his spirit. He was a bastion of light that called to each and every soul he touched. That was Steve’s power: more than his super strength, or his healing, or his eidetic memory. Steve’s power was to see the good in people, and to manifest it. To make real the ideals that lived in his heart. To bring out the beauty in someone or something that only he could see.
“You tell me,” Bruce sighs, his hands twisting together in that familiar, nervous way. It makes Tony’s chest ache to see it. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
, he tells Lacey. He sits up and stretches, scratching at his belly.
Steve rubs a hand over his face. He surveys the barrel warily. “Look, not that I don’t appreciate what you’re trying to do, because I know this is you trying to…help. But, you know I can’t-“
that? He only ever cooks health food for Tony. The man is unbelievable.
The first time Steve saw Tony injecting himself with a syringe, it was in a cramped bedsit bathroom at four in the morning. Steve had just frozen in shock. It wasn’t drugs, he knew, or at least, not the fun kind. Tony had rolled his pants down over his thighs and was pinching his side to create a cushion of flesh for the needle to enter, face mostly expressionless as he pressed down on the plunger, only the barest wince betraying any pain. Then he pulled it out and covered the sharp, snapping it up in a case and putting it in his inner jacket pocket, and then he was turning around and Steve, well. Steve was still standing like an idiot in the doorway, shock and horror flickering over his body in turns. Tony never told anyone when he was sick, or when he needed help, or when he was dying. What was the medication for? Clearly he’d done this before: he’d been doing this a long time, in fact, as evidenced by the easy way he handled the clean-up, his complete lack of reaction at the injection.
“I’m avoiding Steve,” he says, which what do you know, has the added benefit of being 100% true.
“Deploying.”
“Tony.”
He stops, unsure of how to finish the sentence.
“And yet,” she says, her eyes narrowing, “your companions are not.”
Tony’s eyes shock open. His back arches, his whole body shaking as he comes all over his own stomach, his chest, pooling in his collarbone-
Tony whistles, low and solemn. “Shit. This is exactly what Pepper’s been worried about.”
“Are you giving me relationship advice now?”
"Don't throw me out the window and we're peachy keen, darling."
“So you want me to keep you in check.”
And all the while, pain is still ripping through his body, the white hot flare of fire flickering through every nerve ending, his entire body sweating with it. It rips him apart from the inside out.
"When's Thor due back?"
“What do you think I should do?” Steve mutters to JARVIS, not really expecting an answer.
had been Steve’s first thought. And then:
, he wants to know. They have, perhaps, become a little co-dependent through this experience. Steve thinks of himself as a relatively self-aware man. He knows that they’ll have work to do when he’s corporeal again.
“You never want to let anyone know what a softie you are,” Steve hums, and Tony doesn’t have to look at him to hear the grin in his voice. Steve presses a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s ear, adjusting Tony’s scarf so it better covers his neck and slipping his arms around to hang over Tony’s shoulders. He’s warm where he presses up against Tony’s back. “I know you wanted a date tomorrow, but uh. Are you opposed to dessert before dinner?”
Steve nodded, and pulled off his cowl, ignoring Clint shouting at him to “stop being such a lovesick idiot, fight now, talk later” and decking another Hydra agent with the shield. He turned to face the camera, his expression stubborn as he could make it.
The first thing Tony does after Steve’s funeral is take himself off the active roster. He puts Carol in charge of the Avengers. Then he settles down in his workshop, and he dives into the next stage of grief: trying to find whatever or whoever killed Steve Rogers.
He hopes it’s enough.
Bruce so rarely asked for anything. Mostly he just wanted to be left alone. What kind of leader would he be, if he couldn’t provide the one thing his packmate had asked of him?
“Yes,” he says, sounding sad about it. “It is. And that’s my fault, too, as much as it is yours.”
“Ah, come on, Steve-”
“Well,” he said, “Steve, I think you should eat something.”
The issue, mostly, was Tony’s scent. With Tony pinned under him, Steve could smell everything. There was a low current of arousal between them, harmless enough. He was an unbonded pack omega, and Tony was a bit of an…unconventional alpha. Where most alphas would be snarling, Tony took all of Steve’s abuse with good humour. Even Natasha, cool and unflappable as she was, sometimes betrayed the slightest bit of temper when they sparred. But then, Steve thought that Tony must not be like the average alpha, to be with Pepper. It was clear between the two of them who was dominant. Where Steve would expect frustration and anger, Tony was all happiness, pack, and sex. It was driving Steve absolutely crazy, and what was worse, there was no way that Tony couldn’t smell the arousal on him, too. They’d been too close for that, Tony’s nose skirting dangerously close to his neck, but Tony hadn’t said a thing. He hadn’t lingered, hadn’t touched Steve in any way that might be flirtatious, hadn’t even smirked. He was being…chivalrous, maybe, and Steve hated it.
"Astral projection?"
Tony rubs a hand over his face. “You’re being incredibly manipulative while I’m vulnerable and exhausted,” he complains.
"I can't figure you out," he mutters, furrowing his brow a little. "You're lonely as fuck on the villain track, that much is clear. And you want someone to match wits with, which is why you're always hitting me up for banter. I just can't get what it is you want from all this."
“I’ll sober up a bit with some food in me,” Tony offered, and Rogers smiled a small half-smile at the concession. “And then I can take all your money.”
Steve closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath. There’s nothing satisfying in it, because he doesn’t really have lungs. He isn’t really here at all.
“Go home, Stark. Don’t make me restrict your access to this room.”
“And get reamed out for my lack of patriotism and my inappropriate humour? No thanks,” Tony grumbles. Then, projected out of the suit, “Rhodey, working on borrowed time here.”
“The cryochamber is hermetically sealed, and for good reason,” Tony says. “Are we sure this is a good idea?”
“Gross,” he mutters.
“Don’t be an idiot, Tony, get the fuck out of there!” Tony slams a hand against the elevator shaft in frustration. “Steve, he can melt any metal. If he hits the reactor-”
“JARVIS,” Tony says, slowly. “Are you violating your privacy parameters?”
Tony swallows, glancing around furtively. There’s no one else in the room. It doesn’t even matter. He and Steve aren’t even together.
Tony sighs. He turns back to the monitor, pulls up another data log. He pushes something back towards the monitor Reed is using, which apparently startles him so much that his head comes down to squint more closely at the screen, his neck stretching like taffy.
“I’ve joked with Tony that the Avengers aren’t a superhero team, we’re a halfway house,” Steve said, wry now, and was rewarded with the small twitch of the lips that signalled Natasha’s laughter. “Thank you.”
Tony rolls his eyes. Then he glances down at his shoes, frowning. “These are really the worst to do this in,” he mutters. He leans down, ostensibly to fix one of the laces which has gone a little loose.
“I’m not saying this right,” Steve huffs, frustrated. “It’s just, everything, it gets all twisted round, and it hurts sometimes like you wouldn’t believe-”
“Bless me Father, for I have sinned. It has been, uh.” Steve stops, huffing a self-deprecating laugh. Right. “It’s been a really, really long time since my last confession.”
“If there’s a second breakfast, can there be a second lunch?” Clint tries, following Bruce out the door. Natasha spares Tony another speaking glance before heading up behind them, and Tony turns around resignedly to face his fate.
Maria rolls her eyes. “No, but I’m just saying, you’ve been here before and it’s never been good for you. Go home, Stark.”
Tony had never been monogamous. It had never really seemed practical, all things considered; he’d been with a few genuinely awful partners in his time, people even he would even admit had treated him poorly. Most everyone wanted something from him, and after a while, he developed a reputation. It was easier to keep people away when he didn’t have to focus on any one thing. It helped, too that the people he fucked were generally equally as much of a workaholic as he was. It helped set certain limits on his life: boundaries on how much time he could spend with someone, how invested he could get, what he could ask from them.
Pepper’s mouth flattens in a failed attempt not to smile, her brows practically jumping into her hairline. “Of course. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
"Don't mother me," Tony warns, only half joking. "I can hang up on you."
Steve is intimately familiar with what happens next: Tony, shifting his weight side to side, eyes darting, desperate to escape a conversation. “Got work to do,” he says. He shrugs, awkward. Then he turns, winking over his shoulder at little Dani. Dani is safe ground. She’s cute, and she loves everyone, and they have no history. Steve huffs an exasperated laugh. “Later, Munchkin.”
Natasha blinked at him, slanted her eyes towards Steve, then nodded once. She stepped back into the elevator without a word. The doors slid closed with a quiet swish, and then the two omegas were alone.
“Fascinating. It is
“You’re right; he’s not.” He looks at Tony patiently. Tony stares back.
“Hydra was keeping tabs on Tony through social media. In case you were worried. There’s no leak.”
“What are you doing?” Rogers asked, frowning, and Tony glanced over at the bed.
“I’m sorry,” he says, trying for polite Americana, “I lost my temper-”
Tony stiffens. His eyes dart down to the kitchen floor, to where Steve is touching his ankle.
Evan relaxes fractionally. When Steve offers him a grin, he smiles back. “It’s an honour, sir.”
“The spermatophore-”
“Yeah,” Steve sighs. “God damn, you’re so good to me.”
“And you,” she says, pointing at Loki, “need to behave yourself if you’re serious about being on our side, now. The last thing we need is it getting out that we’re working with a wanted extraterrestrial terrorist. You need to do some major PR before you can be seen with any of the Avengers.”
“Careful,” he says, when they break for air. “I like this tie.”
“Nope,” Tony said, immediately shoving at Steve’s shoulder. “Red, hard limit, safeword. I refuse to have Natasha walk in on us stuck together by your cum in the middle of the sparring mats. I value my life. I do not consent.”
“No,” Steve says, remembering all the things Pepper’s been through. “But she implied that a mutual friend of ours could be credited with being her moral compass. And that surprised me, because I guess I don’t think of this other friend of ours as that kind of guy.”
“Okay,” he breathed, and it felt like giving up. Bruce was asking him to trust Tony to save himself, like Tony had always had to. He’d saved himself from death, from the cave, from Stane and The Mandarin and The Ten Rings. Steve did not want him to have to save himself again, but he could hear it in Bruce’s voice, now. Bruce did not expect them to catch these men today, if they were good enough to avoid JARVIS’ all-seeing eye. Instead, he was trusting Tony. He was asking Steve to trust Tony, as though there was anyone else alive Steve trusted as well in the whole world. “Okay.”
"Yeah, 'cause you guilted me into it," Sam gasps, voice laboured. "Remember that conversation we had before you got yourself kidnapped? About you being an asshole?"
“Yeah, go ahead.” He hasn’t even finished speaking before the familiar seeping burn of Loki’s healing magic sweeps over him, a little rougher than he remembers. The tingling it leaves behind is less pleasant, sharper, and he hisses a little at the flare of pain, rotating his shoulder in the socket. It moves seamlessly, no clicking or aches, and Tony laughs and turns, measuring Loki’s tired face, the sallow skin below his cheekbones. “Fixed a little more than I expected, there.”
I M H E R E
“Not if he’s running scans,” Tony observes, watching for Loki’s flashing grin. He frowns when it doesn’t come.
Steve glances at the small metal box, swallows hard. “Can’t we just…make breakfast here? And we can talk?” But Tony is already shaking his head. “Why not?”
“Captain America?”
Tony laughed, wiping his hands in his apron and reaching around back to undo his ties. “Peter’s clever. What’s wrong with it?”
“Three.”
Clint is standing in the doorway with Thor, both of them in work out clothing, ostensibly returning from a training session. Clint is staring at Steve with a wary kind of scrutiny, eyes narrowed as he searches his face.
“I have already apologised for my prior transgressions,” Thor says, sounding a little disgruntled about it, and Tony laughs and shakes his head. He taps meaningfully at his earpiece. “Ah. You were speaking to JARVIS.”
“You curse a lot when you’re tired. I wouldn’t have thought there’d be any filter to lose, but I guess I was wrong.” He laughs when Tony tries half-heartedly to take a swat at him and fails. “Here, actually. Chinatown. I took an herbalism class from a TCM practitioner and she was also a skilled acupressure massage therapist. Brilliant woman. I can give you her number, if you want the real thing. She works at Kamwo.”
Steve beams at him. “Only by my best pal, Iron Man. Maybe you’ve heard of him?” Tony rolls his eyes in the most exaggerated way possible, if only to see Steve giggle.
Tony turns that over for a moment in his head, considering. Sure, they joke a bit at Thor’s expense, but the man takes it all with good-natured aplomb. And there are moments, too, like this one; where Tony can see the age of him, peeking through like the copper under gold plating.
“Right. There’s a backhanded compliment if I ever heard one,” Tony sneers.
“And that’s what bothers you,” Xavier observes, nodding. He reaches out a hand, floating his teacup to him, and plucks it out of the air with delicate fingers. “I presume you were discussing your mutual superhero friend, in this instance?”
Rogers’ fingers reached up, his eyes half-slitted as he traced the line of Tony’s facial hair. His expression was unbearably soft, and Tony swallowed and stood. He took ahold of the rest of the newspaper and began to stuff the windows, pushing the curtains out of the way so he could get to the sills. Rogers slipped in and out as he watched Tony work, a small, satisfied smile on his face. Tony had no idea what he was on about. Maybe he’d been in the cold so long he’d gone mad.
“My father wanted an alpha, and I wanted to please him. I don’t know if that’s why I am the way I am, but I can’t imagine my father agreeing to pre-pubescent HRT if I was an alpha looking to become an omega, you got me? He wouldn’t have. He wanted this.” Steve nodded, nausea still roiling in his belly like an eel. “By the time I got to college, I’d decided, fuck it. Who cares why I’m an alpha. I am, and fuck anyone who tries to fuck with me.” Tony pressed his face to the glass, eyes glittering bright under his brow in the way they did when he was trying to explain something important. It was a look that Steve was intimately familiar with, and the sight of it so close unspooled the tension in his spine, turning it into soft mush. “You came out as an omega because you felt like they were feeding the American people a lie. You felt wrong, being labelled as an alpha. You were experiencing dysphoria.”
“I’m a futurist,” Tony quips, a token protest. Steve’s fingers tighten on his hip, a delicious burn before he remembers himself and lets go. “I’m here, Steve. You’ve got me right where you want me.”
“Should I not have?”
“Uh,” Steve says. “We’ll get to that.”
Tony eyes him over his coffee mug, leaning back against the counter. He tilts his head to the side.
Steve clears his throat a little, settling back in his chair, and Tony glances at him. The faintest flush sits high on his cheekbones, and Tony zeroes in on that, equal parts curious and terrified. He knows he’s been called last to the table for a reason, but he hasn’t quite sussed it out yet. Did they plan this specifically to coincide with Loki’s absence?
“You’re a maniac,” Tony slurs, settling back into the sheets. The laugh that Steve looses is slow, easy. He leans in to press a gentle kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth, but he pulls away before Tony can turn his head into it, deepen it into something real.
“Oh my
Tony’s cock was right there, and he watched with half-lidded eyes as Tony took himself in hand, dragging the tip over Steve’s mouth without pushing inside. Steve could feel himself dripping; he wanted this so badly, his whole body trembling with the effort to stay still, to not just take what he wanted. Tony’s other hand scraped short nails through his hair, slipping down over his cheek to press one thumb to the sensitive corner of Steve’s mouth. It dragged over his lower lip, pulling roughly at the skin, and Steve opened his jaw even wider, pleading.
“No, no, stop that,” Tony says, waving a hand. His heart feels like it’s going to climb out of his chest.
‘New York’s pretty beautiful this time of year, too,’ it says. ‘Enjoy.’
Rogers did as he was told, almost meekly. He was bluffing about the extent of his injuries, Tony knew; likely he’d hurt himself in the fall from Liberty’s saddle. There was a nasty blackening bruise across his hip, and Tony bundled him up under the covers and turned to the stove to stoke the fire.
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. “JARVIS said he’s not harmed.”
He curls himself around Tony’s body, shaking like a leaf, and Tony leans into him with a wrecked sound that Steve feels in his very bones. But he can feel it, is the thing. He can feel Tony’s hands fumbling along his cheekbones, tracing his jaw, his nose, his gasping mouth.
Tony bites his lip, because he doesn’t have a comeback for that one.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve’s lying on the floor next to his cryochamber, shivering and feeling deeply disturbed. So it’s quite a shock when Tony walks into the room in the armour, the faceplate and gauntlets retracted.
Tony hums. A strange expression crosses his face. Rare, to see something in Tony that he does not recognise. It’s there and gone in an instant, but something about it niggles at Steve’s mind. When has he seen Tony look like that before?
“Tony?” he says. He leans back, eyes darting across Tony’s face as Tony brushes the tears out of his lashes. He watches Tony stitch himself back together. “Tony, can you hear me?”
Tony’s internal Natasha translator parses.
Steve grinned. “Well, are you a mortal scientist that needs assuring?” he asked. “Because, you know, I can hold you like this for a long,
“Hey birdbrain, who’s gonna play GTA with you, huh?”
Bucky’s laugh is tinny through the little phone speaker. Steve leans closer, not quite close enough to touch Tony. He isn’t sure he wants Tony to know he’s eavesdropping so brazenly. “Oh really? I thought it wasn’t a favour-”
Steve snorts, then winces, immediately regretting his choice. Tony does his best not to laugh at him.
Tony does not answer. Instead, Steve can see the blurry outline of his body reach for the shampoo. He begins to wash himself, slowly, as though he’s in pain. He probably is, Steve realises. He hasn’t slept much in the past weeks, and that was when Steve was around to watch him. He’s sure Tony wasn’t perfectly rested when they’d gone out together.
The door clicked shut behind him, and Steve stretched luxuriously before pulling the sheets over himself and snuggling into bed. He’d gone for an hour run and come four times. He’d earned a nap.
All of this to say, when he wakes up with his head pounding, feeling like he’s ready to throw up everything in his stomach and half his organs besides, it’s an unfortunately familiar feeling. What’s less familiar is the warm hand brushing through his hair, an unwelcome physical stimuli considering how much pain he’s in.
“Well, from what I’ve heard, it doesn’t sound like Odin was always wise,” Tony points out, resolutely not thinking of empty halls, of the clink of ice in a glass, the sounds of muffled shouting. “It sounds like he was an asshole, and then he learned something. That’s not too unlike you.”
“Already done, sir. I suspect that no one can see him when he doesn’t wish to be seen.”
Tony cuts off the comms, just to be spiteful. He blows open the doors to the top floor, then blasts out onto the roof. From above, he can see the sunrise building on the horizon, bright orange slicing through the purplish dawn like a knife. The sun isn’t quite there yet, but it’s coming. A pink glow hangs over the city, heralding its arrival.
“What are you gonna do?”
“I don’t know,” he says, smoothing a hand over his face. He takes a slow breath, letting it out from between his fingers. “Sorry. Yes. I’m ready to work.”
“No,” Steve is saying, backing away, and Tony scrambles to get his feet under him. “No, this isn’t real, either.”
“Bethie! So high!” Tony laughs, picking up the glass cutter again. “You must have been pretty sure of yourself when you bet.”
“That’s not the same-” Steve begins, sick of this argument, but Pepper cuts him off at the knees as always.
“Dirty pool,” Tony growled, but Steve could hear laughter underneath it. “You are such a fucking. Little. Shit.” Each word was accompanied with a thrust that made Steve gasp, unable to speak, his fingers curling around the headboard as his other hand scrabbled at whatever piece of Tony he could reach. “You wanna act like the golden boy, the pretty little Christian omega, all-American sweetheart, but really you’re just a little knotsucker-“
“You’re trouble,” Tony replies, smiling a little. It turns into a grin when Loki leans in for another kiss.
“You’re right,” he says, absently, and Rhodey looses a sound that Tony knows from experience means confusion and self-satisfied amusement. “No, listen. JARVIS, Steve didn’t check up on Barnes at all, did he?”
“So,” he says, cutting into the now warm brownies, “wanna talk about it?”
“Steve,
“You think Tash’s been compromised,” Steve says, slow, and something like fear and fury is overtaking him. He meets Tony’s eyes with a quiet kind of fervour that Tony knows well from the battlefield.
Steve walks into the communal living room with some trepidation. He’d expected more chaos, a few things broken, but instead it mostly just seems like the couches have been shoved around. In the centre of the carpet, huge and toxic green, sits the Hulk. He’s sitting with his chin in his hands, his expression grumpy as he watches Sesame Street.
“No,” Tony says again, because he’s doing this all wrong. He tries to get a hold of his breath. “Oh, fuck, I’m sorry. I just-” He’s tearing up now, and he doesn’t know if it’s from the laughter or something else. “We
“I have never seen you make such stupid tactical decisions in all the time I’ve known you,” Tony says, “and I’ve watched all existing footage of every campaign you’ve ever run, so that’s saying something.”
Natasha is probably the person on the team he’s trusted most to take this burden from him. If she’s been a double agent since Amora first showed up, he has no idea what the hell they’re going to do. Natasha has been his confessor, his left hand, and his last resort. He cannot abide by the idea that all this time, she’s been compromised.
Tony watches them go with a quiet laugh, then does his best to lever himself upright. It isn’t as easy as it looks. People seem to forget that the suit is
“And what of Loki?” Thor scoffs, but Tony just shakes his head.
It wasn’t until later, after Tony had slipped out of bed to head down to the workshop and Steve had woken up alone that he’d really thought about what Tony had said.
“And did that work for you?” Steve deadpans.
“Probably the smart choice, Doc.”
. I’d rather the investigations be thorough than let a single man involved in the Potomac Crash go free to threaten the lives of American citizens again, don’t you? So Gyrich managed to get through the first round of investigations. Okay. I’d rather someone checked to make absolutely sure he was clean than risk letting a Hydra sleeper agent design international statutes for the very people that took them down the last time. That seems like letting the fox run the henhouse, don’t you think?”
"We were doing okay," Pepper says. "I thought we were doing okay."
“Why d’you think I’m always up here?” he asked, voice rough. Tony licked his lips, and Steve stifled a small sound of want in his throat. Tony was close enough to hear it, evidenced by the way his eyes darkened, his breath catching in his throat. Steve placed Tony’s other hand on his waist.
“A fine choice,” Loki deadpans, and Tony laughs at the wry tone of his voice. “Shall I…?”
“Not so,” JARVIS disputed. “His instincts branded her as a child of his pack, just as she claimed. She was someone to be protected.”
“Is that…a problem?” Steve asked, chest tightening. He moved towards the fridge, half because the noise was in fact getting annoying, but mostly to try to escape Tony’s sharp scrutiny. He pulled out the butter and the milk, then shut the door. “I know my nature was kind of a shock to everyone.”
It is the simplest way to explain. It is the truth of this whole wretched experience, down to the ache in his breastbone when he thinks of all that they’ve been through together. Now, and last year when tentatively grafting together a superhero oversight policy stopped ending in screaming matches and started ending in awkward small talk, and then short walks to the elevator, and then, incredibly, their first coffee run. After that, it was like they’d broken open the cast that had been wrapped around their shattered friendship and found the bond still there, raw and aching and new. The year before, which Steve doesn’t like to think of at all, the end of which found them both back from the dead and terrified by a world shaped entirely by the brutal efficiency and borderline-sociopathy of Maria Hill and Reed Richards running a program that should have been built on warmth and ethics and a nurturing environment for young minds. The parts of that year that he cannot bear and yet returns to time and time again: friends and family splayed out in the street like bloody roadkill, faces made unrecognisable by wounds or twisted in anger. Tony, bleeding under his shield. Tony, above him and wreathed in light, metal that he had always trusted to catch him when he fell and be his shield and sword and eternal companion now slamming against his face, his ribs, bruising and breaking the skin.
This Pepper is based very heavily in the MCU, and not at all in the comics, where she does in fact often serve as Tony’s moral compass. MCU Pepper is unabashedly selfish and self-interested, and that makes her one of the most unique female characters I’ve seen in recent years. She is allowed to love shoes, and her job, and not care about Iron Man because she wants Tony safe at home with her. That’s an extraordinary stance to take, and one that has been maintained throughout the whole MCU. Every fight she and Tony have is about his decision to fight to protect the world, instead of staying safe at home where Pepper can keep an eye on him. She is allowed to feel that way, and still be a likeable character, and I absolutely love that about her because so few women are allowed to be selfish in the way Pepper is selfish. Tl;dr I may be a slash shipper, but I love Pepper to death, and I’m so happy that the comments I’ve been getting from y’all have reflected that love back at me.
“And he can’t exactly tell us what happened. Great. How many?”
Loki furrows a brow, mouth twisting into a small smile as he examines Bruce. Something in Bruce’s face shifts ever so slightly, and Tony knows, somehow, that Loki has just said something to him that no one else could hear. Then he dips his chin in acquiescence. “Later, once we’ve finished here. It is a complex spell.”
“He’s a soldier and a tactician.”
“You’re so damn petty.”
“Sometimes.” Tony sighs. “I have a masseuse in Malibu, but…”
Tony manages to get back to his room, shower again, and change in time for lunch. He looks at himself in the mirror—sagging skin below his eyes, crow’s feet, laugh lines—and wonders what the fuck about him is supposed to be compatible with the peak of human perfection.
“He turned it into marshmallows,” Bruce says, gesturing with a pen. “It wasn’t exactly world domination and genocide.”
“You little minx, you know exactly how fucking tempting you smell after a run,” Tony bit out, voice rough and deep, and Steve opened his legs wider in response.
“Hence the smoothies,” Tony agrees. “Which, hey, my bloodwork is way better than it was pre-smoothies, so I think I should get some credit for self-care or whatever the hell Pepper is always going on about.”
“Tony!” he shouts, and Bruce sighs and stands up from the couch.
“JARVIS was handling it,” Tony protests, shrugging, and Cabe rolls her eyes and heads towards the garage exit.
“Fine,” Tony repeated, and Steve cleared his throat.
“Stark,” she said, looking incredibly amused, “you already lead a pack. One of whom is a lieutenant colonel for the U.S. Air Force.”
