Note - this features Clint being physically altered by way of magic. In this chapter it's referred to as Clint being turned from a boy to a girl. Some people explained to me that this was erring on the side of problematic, and the language wasn't fully inclusive or understanding of transgender people. So the help of some gorgeous people and feedback, the next chapter goes onto explore and challenge the perceptions and terminology used. So bear with me - the characters learn as I did! Thank you.
He knows he’s probably coming across as moody and sullen but no-one seems to mind, not even when he puts his headphones on for the cab journey to the airport. He’s still feeling all twisted up about Tony and the stupid nanites thing and blocking out the rest of the world kind of helps.
He says goodbye to Clint and then makes himself say goodbye to the others, just to prove a point. He almost changes his mind when he’s got Anna in his arms and she’s resting her head on his shoulder, happily murmuring ‘Tow.’
There’s the faintest hum from the Tesla as Steve accelerates just that little bit more. “Good point,” he says grimly. “Get your phone. Call Natasha.”
“Who gives a shit?!” Arto bellows, and he’s turning away and storming off. He’s so angry he’s shaking and it feels terrifying, this nasty wicked snarl of anger that makes him want to hurt and scream. He needs to get away, to hide.
“I like it. Very modern. Clean lines. Colours.” Tony waves a hand vaguely at the wall. “Hey, my home has an original Rogers on the wall. Probably doubled the value. I’ll call in an agent. See if I’m right.”
He tries to get himself lost in the artwork, he really does, moving from section to section with Steve just behind him. However, as well as appreciating lines and style and colour and atmosphere and message, he finds himself scrutinising the subjects of all the paintings, seeing how his brain reacts. He definitely doesn’t perk up at any of the male subjects. Some of the women are definitely beautiful and make his cheeks go warm if he thinks about it too much. It’s the same way he appreciates the Victoria’s Secret models in Times Square so he remains ninety-nine percent sure he’s straight.
“Cross my heart,” Steve says, then his attention goes back to his phone as it beeps. God, Arto would bet that he's texting Bucky right now. Steve must kind of read his mind, because the next thing he says it, “And besides, I have other friends. Not just Bucky.”
There’s a tense silence, and then Bucky is the one to break it, by lifting Anna up and looking her right in the eye. “You are never allowed to think about boys or girls, not ever,” he says solemnly, and Tony, Clint and Natasha all bite down on laughter as Anna smiles and kicks her feet happily, none the wiser.
Arto just wants food, honestly. They can do whatever they like but they’re in the way and that needs to be remedied before he dies of starvation.
“Longer than we’ve got,” Steve goes with. “Or we bundle him into a car and hope he doesn’t put up too much of a fight…”
They get beer - milkshake for Arto - and second breakfast and then hit the shops. With Steve and Bucky flanking him Arto’s less panicked about browsing all the different sections of the stores they go in. Even with Steve’s credit card and permission to go nuts, his heart isn’t completely in it; he’s too distracted by thinking about home and Tony and how he pretty much wants to go back never, despite what Steve says.
“Stop it!” Omari yells, even as they tip over onto the floor, still trying to wrestle each other into submission.
Arto’s face falls at that. “He can’t fix it, though, can he?” he says quietly, like that’s only just occurred to him.
Bucky just snorts derisively. He brings his hands up, scowling at the punching back like it’s said something nasty about Clint or looked at Anna wrong. He jabs at it, the sounds of his knuckles hitting reinforced canvas loud in the quiet of the room.
“Babe?” Arto questions, craning his head back to look at Bucky. He’s sitting on the floor leaning back against the couch, mostly because that puts him close to Bucky and Bucky has the candy.
He wakes up at 4am with Arto kneeling on his spine, pulling at his ear and telling him to get up before they’re late. He attempts to roll Arto into a blanket burrito which has about a seventy percent success rate at getting him to fall back to sleep; however, Arto wriggles free with the ease of a greased weasel, pulling on Steve’s ankle in a futile attempt out to drag him out of bed. Steve gives in and staggers vertical, forlornly trying to remember the days when he used to get a solid eight hours.
That’s Sam, sounding careful and concerned. And he’s not in the same mind-reading league as Bucky and Natasha but he’s still good at knowing when people are out of sorts.
“Never again,” Bucky says as he unwraps the candy and pops it in his mouth, screwing up the wrapper and flicking it back at Steve. “I was washing off green paint for weeks.”
“You want to get out of here?” Steve asks quietly. “If you need to scream it out, we should probably go home.”
“You’re so smart,” Arto tells her and she beams at him. She quickly glances at where Steve, Bucky and Clint are still chatting, lowering his voice to a whisper. “You’re never gonna be on your own, ever,” he tells Anna. “We rescued you just in time.”
It clicks into place. “Because he knew I’d refuse,” Steve says, mouth hanging open at Arto’s sheer audacity. He’s actually kind of impressed. “What, he didn’t want us to know he doesn’t really want to go so he picked the one goddamn option he knew I’d say no to?”
Bucky takes him to the magnificent mile. It looks so pretty in the falling snow, and there are loads of cool landmarks scattered along its length but Arto is more excited about the fact he’s in the city's premier shopping district and he’s got Steve’s credit card in his pocket. His stomach is all tied up in knots in a kind of good awesome way, and every time he looks into a shop window and sees something glittery or pink or floaty the sensation pulls tight.
“Low blow,” Tony says. “Okay, we’re two for two on days where we’ve yelled at each other. What’s going on?”
Tony puts his phone down. “I still know the project can be valuable. So scrapping it is not an option. Considering my self-regulation is less than consistent, I’m going to let someone else be in charge. Someone who respects FDA regulations and nonsense like that.”
“What the hell are you two doing? You can’t have not slept, you’re meant to be shadowing Arto at school!”
“Oh thank god, then it’s not Pietro you have a crush on,” Tony says. “I’m sorry, he’s too obnoxious for my tastes.”
Arto goes very still. He tries to swallow past the sudden lump in his throat. “Yeah. I wasn’t ready to talk to him,” he says weirdly defensive. “He ignored me for weeks and then Tony gave me the trip for Christmas…”
Arto scowls. His neck is going a tell-tale red though, so something’s clearly up with him. Open book, just like his dad. “
“Yeah, why not,” Clint says, hopping back on one foot and cursing as the pan spits oil at him. Serves him right for cooking shirtless. Ugh, and he’s got a hickey on his chest, Arto is fed up of seeing Clint with his hickeys, he’s too old for that kind of shit.
Clint is busy raiding the fridge with Kate and Pietro leaning over his shoulders to peer inside. Kamala is sitting at the counter and staring at Tony in awe, the way Peter used to do when he first started coming over. Tony raises a brow at her and she blushes but smiles, obviously caught out but not minding.
They start bickering again. The cab driver does an admirable job of ignoring them, keeping his eyes on the road. Arto’s a little nonplussed by the whole thing if he’s honest. Though he is kinda glad that they’re laughing at each other again. It goes a long way to making things feel almost normal.
“You know I love you even if you are weird,” Tony says, and bites back a laugh at the way Arto just groans in response.
He’s across the room in four steps, flinging himself onto Tony. Tony wobbles back a step under his weight but recovers enough to wrap both his arms around Arto’s shoulders, holding him tightly enough to make breathing difficult.
Steve pulls him into a hug, right there in the gallery. Everyone’s probably still watching but that doesn’t stop Arto from starting to cry, in front of everyone like some sort of idiot.
“You can’t just move all our stuff without asking!” Arto shouts. What is it with people and touching his stuff today?!
Arto nods and climbs to his feet, going to find Steve. He thrusts the phone at him and doesn’t want for a reply, just turns on his heel and flees, shutting himself in his bedroom. He throws himself down on his bed and lets himself cry, though he can’t tell if the tears are relief at getting to talk to Tony, fear over what’s happening with his stupid brain, anxiety at the impending conversation or sheer exhaustion.
Arto doesn't sleep. He's too busy staying up late, reading, thinking, searching the Internet for answers and thinking some more. It’s not really his strong suit - normally, when thinking about something starts to make him panic or feel too much, he either gives up or just kind of explodes.
Nick leans back in his chair. “As your friend, I am telling you that poking people’s missing body parts is not what we call socially acceptable.”
Arto nods. He doubles back to get his box. Hesitates, then thrusts it into Steve’s hands. Steve takes it without question, flipping open the lid and pulling out the pair of sneakers that are nestled inside. He looks for like two seconds and then he’s smiling, the biggest dumbest proudest smile that Arto’s seen him wear in a long time.
Clint bursts into laughter, and Arto cackles delightedly. Bucky props himself up on an elbow, looking offended for a moment, and then just shrugs and flops back onto the couch. “Whatever,” he yawns. “I can be a fella and pull off a fairy outfit, right? Just make sure it’s something that shows off my legs.”
“No, I’ll get you to harass his friends,” Steve says, not sounding remotely troubled. “Besides, Peter has a crush on you a mile wide. He’ll tell you anything.”
Arto immediately jumps at him, making Steve laugh as Arto hits him, wrapping his arms tight around his chest. He’s still not as tall as Steve, even if he’s matched Tony. He closes his eyes tight, squishes Steve that bit harder.
Steve slowly shakes his head. He swallows hard enough so that Arto can see his Adam’s apple bobbing.
He gets up and pushes away from the counter, walking over and sitting on the couches with the others. Bruce is sitting back with a book on his knee, idly watching the television. Natasha is curled up still with her eyes back on her own book; Bucky is sitting on the other couch and holding his phone out to Clint who has moved to sit on the floor near Bucky’s feet. Whatever it is on the phone is making Clint’s eyebrows climb higher and higher up his face; that coupled with the wicked grin on Bucky’s face makes Steve very sure he doesn't want to know what’s on it.
As he works his way through the books, he finds it’s actually easier decide what he's not. When something doesn’t fit he takes a sharpie to the pages and literally crosses it out. It’s only when he’s been through the entire book does he realise that he’s crossed everything out, leaving nothing for him. That does make him panic, thinking that he's so messed up that there's not even a word for it.
“Nnn,” Arto replies, already half-asleep again. He hears Steve leave the apartment and isn’t aware of much else until Steve’s return an hour later.
Tony is already out of the office, waving cheerfully at Barnes who waves him off vaguely, off the call but busy doing something with a holoscreen in the other room. Steve tries to stop Arto from dashing after Tony but the kid is damn quick and evades him pretty easily. Steve sighs and collects the shoes, before pausing on his way out.
“I’ve been thinking a lot,” Peter says, suddenly awkward. The atmosphere in the room goes from super happy to super serious in two seconds flat. “Hey, is Jarvis here?”
,” Arto huffs, cuts himself off because he knows what Steve will say in response to that. “Bucky. How did he know?”
He considers ignoring it but remembers what Omari said before. And anyway he misses Peter so much it hurts. So much that he’s already cancelling his plan to stay in Chicago forever.
He shoos Clint from the room, turns expectantly to Steve. “So. Final chance to change your mind and let me take a weapon.”
“They’re keeping an eye on it,” Steve says. “It’s gonna take six hours to fully charge, you want to wait for it here or you want to get some food and some sleep?”
Arto nods without uncovering his eyes and Tony walks over to sit on the edge of the bed. Arto rolls over and buries his face in Tony’s hip, snaking an arm around his middle.
“Almost as ostentatious as me,” he says, and only an hour earlier Arto was sitting in Natasha’s car staring at his nails and falling in love but there’s something in Tony’s voice that rubs him up the complete wrong way.
“Yeah,” he says, his smile getting stronger. He drops his voice to a fake whisper, makes a show of looking over his shoulder before turning to Arto with a wink. “Just don’t tell Bucky.”
“No. They were being nosey about why I was taking you out of the state but I guess their job is to worry about you,” Steve says, pulling open the refrigerator. “You want juice?”
“I’m not qualified for babies!” Tony protests, but Clint is pressing her forwards and while Tony doesn’t think he’d deliberately drop Anna, the risk of accidental droppage is probably pretty high. With that in mind he takes her, though does hold her out away from his body a little.
Bucky scrapes a hand over his face and nods. He shakes Clint’s shoulder, leans over to tap something against the side of his face with his metal fingers. Clint grunts, then a hand appears to smack its way across the shelf, groping around until it lands on his hearing aids.
“Yeah we’ll be fine. Natasha is gonna pick us up at the other end,” Clint says. He’s patting his hands over his pockets, checking them all twice before finding his boarding pass in the first pocket that he’d checked. He clamps it between his lips as he starts another pat-down for something else. “Ar, oo anna ay oogaye?” he tries, before Steve reaches over to take the pass for him. He nods in thanks, tries again. “Art, you wanna say goodbye? We better get moving. I need time to lose and find my boarding pass five times over before we leave.”
“I’m not a spider, I just do spider things,” Peter says. “Look.” He does a strange flick of his wrist and a line of motherfucking
Swinging his legs out of the bed, he spots his phone on his bedside table, carefully placed there while he slept. He snatches it up and feels another dull blow to his stomach as he finds a text from Omari, one from La’Taya from his Midtown math class but nothing from Peter.
Arto nods immediately. He’ll tell Tony that he’s going, he’ll tell him that this is his fault and he shouldn’t have made Steve sad and he should have come out of the workshop. And also, Arto thinks, if he goes with Steve then he might not have to go back to school and face Peter, and he won’t have to talk to anyone about his nails or the headband or how it’s making him feel all back to front.
“I am coming with you and there is nothing you can say to stop me,” Arto says. His heart is going too quick. It feels strange, like he’s been swimming non-stop for miles and miles.
Bucky catches up with him as he’s skulking around in a selection of navy-colored, hooded sweatshirts, pulling at the drawstrings in the collars. Bucky sighs. “You have plenty of sweatshirts. I know this, because you steal mine.”
He does. Its electrifying: the sensation of taking it all out on the bag, the thrill of knowing he’s not supposed to be doing this, the idea that he’s allowed to just let go for once.
Steve goes to talk to Bucky, leaving Arto to awkwardly stand there, wondering what to do now. Tony wanders around, looking the place over like he’s never seen it before, stopping to admire the artwork that Steve and Anna left all over the wall.
“You get in the car,” Arto replies stubbornly. “Then future Arto will be thinking about getting in the car.”
“Alright, but that’s enough,” Steve says. “You keep forgetting you’re too strong to play like that with Clint and you’ll end up hurting him.”
“Around an hour ago,” Clint says, apparently oblivious to Arto and the tugging. “She screamed the entire flight, so that was super fun.”
Arto doesn't really want to but he knows it’ll be better if he does. It’s like his old therapist used to say, getting things out there for other people to hear can make them feel less scary. Though that’s easy enough for someone to say when they’re good at finding words. It different when you’re the sort of person who gets the wrong words. Like what if you get something out there but you’ve said it wrong and people misunderstand?
“Just leave me alone!” Arto insists, going to grab a pillow and pressing it to his face. “It’s about nothing, there is nothing wrong.”
"He wakes you up at 4am when he wants Nutella, that's not a decent piece of evidence," Clint snorts, sitting down next to Steve and sprawling back over the steps. “And he might have been excited at 4am, that's ages away from actually going. Why do you think he suddenly wants to go on the bike?”
The words hang there, out in the open. He doesn’t think Clint will say anything bad but it’s still so scary, that moment where it’s out there and there’s nothing he can do about it. He feels a hand on his shoulder, and when he looks up, Clint is just watching him with a small smile on his face, nodding like he gets it and he knows. Arto slides off his chair and happily falls into Clint’s arms for a hug.
Arto huffs out a laugh, and then they both turn as they faintly hear the sound of crying. “Aw, baby, no,” Clint grimaces. “Shit. I better…”
“Stairs,” he says, hands dangling down in front of him, appearing quite content to be carried about like a sack of potatoes. Steve isn’t surprised; Bucky had dropped him off carrying him by an ankle the day before yesterday and Arto had just grinned and waved at him, upside-down and red in the face.
“He can and will knock you off there,” Tony calls from his place opposite Steve at the island counter, eyes fixed on the circuit boards in front of him and screwdriver in hand. Next to Tony, Bruce is nursing a mug of tea between his palms and watching Arto and Clint with an amused smile on his face.
Thankfully, they’re stopped by Natasha smacking Bucky sharply around the back of the head again. “Enough,” she hisses. “You two have put me through enough without adding to it. There is not enough brain bleach in the world for you two.”
“Okay. Beer, second breakfast, retail therapy, then actual therapy,” Steve says, leaning over to tap Arto’s knee. “I want you to call Julia.”
“Hanging up now, I’ll call you later,” Steve says, and cuts the call. He’s that furious that his hand is shaking, and it’s making Arto feel all bent out of shape.
It takes him ages to stop shaking. He keeps squeezing his eyes shut like he can get rid of the lingering images of white tiles and smoke. When he does calm down, he’s vaguely embarrassed and annoyed at himself, enough so that he pushes away from Steve and sits next to him instead.
“You’ll be okay,” Tony says, running his fingers through Arto’s hair. “I promise, most sixteen year olds go through the same, everyone finds it hard to talk to girls, or guys-”
By the time he’s finished, they’re both laughing. Arto tries to stop but Peter sets him off again, and every time Peter stops, Arto starts giggling again and they’re off again.
“No, he’s not, he’s your husband and he’s crying and you have to come and help,” he says, voice getting louder and louder. “
Coney Island. They haven't been there in years. They haven't been anywhere in weeks, really. Steve has been off being a superhero and Tony has been working and working and working. No time for family outings, really.
“He’s sixteen, he’s weird by definition,” Steve yawns, his hand settling on Tony’s side. “Just let him do what he’s going to do, keep an eye on him.”
The man grabbed his camera and his bag and literally ran from the room. Satisfied, Steve put his phone away.
“Well, he said you were smart enough to work it out so he wasn’t surprised,” Steve says. “He’ll talk to you about it if you want.”
Arto’s not a hundred percent sure on syllables but he’s not about to say anything because he needs to finish his breakfast and he’s not got time to flirt with the possibility of adults going
“I have him,” Natasha says, and Arto turns towards her, but steps back into Steve’s side. She holds out the bear, speaking again in a calm voice. “Don’t worry, Solnishka. I just didn’t want King Hawkeye to take him.”
Arto gets his own way about the TV that night; instead of watching any dumb galas or celebrity gossip he puts on Gladiator. He’s possibly seem the film eight hundred times but it’s a classic.
Steve reaches over to rest his hand over Arto’s fingers, gently squeezing. “Green,” he murmurs back.
“I know, shush,” Steve says. He sits down on Arto’s bed and then hauls Arto into his lap, holding him sideways. It seems to be happening a lot at the moment. “You’re okay. Just a bad dream.”
Arto is hunched so low down in the armchair that his knees are almost at his chin, his phone held literally two inches away from his nose.
Accepting the answer this time around, Arto hands over the coffee, which Steve takes gratefully. He goes to take a sip and then starts as he hears someone shout, “Cap!” It’s come from a pair of women, standing over by a family sized SUV. One of them waves and the other one smacks her arm, and they start squabbling amongst themselves.
Steve turns to look at him. “I am not taking Tony’s son away from him,” he says, so quiet that it sounds dangerous.
When they’ve calmed down enough, they chat for a little longer about school, about Arto’s new shoes, about the plans for the Manhattan Island Marathon swim. They don’t talk about the not-talking, or any of the other big issues, but Arto doesn’t care. He’s got Peter talking to him like everything’s normal, and that’s enough.
Steve hugs him back tightly. “Love you too, Art,” he says, letting him go as the elevator dings behind him. “And if anyone gives you shit about your dress or your shoes, call me because I’ll be wanting to punch them in the face too, got it?”
Apart from that minor hiccup…he finds that the fear of carrying on feeling like he did earlier is enough to make him stick at it. Wanting to avoid any more public meltdowns is a pretty good motivator.
“Tony - Tony made a call that put himself in danger,” Steve says. His knuckles are white on the steering wheel. “That’s why I’m so angry. That’s all you need to know.”
He lurches awake with a gasp. Two strong hands are on his shoulders, helping him up into a sitting position. He’s all sweaty and gross and he can smell smoke.
He risks another glance up. Bucky has shifted and has an arm around Clint’s shoulders, and he leans in to press a kiss to the top of Clint’s head. Clint is saying something to Steve who is shrugging and draining the last of his beer. As he does, he catches Arto’s eye, just a brief moment of contact before he looks back to Clint and Bucky.
Arto shakes his head. Bucky sighs and then he's walking over to the ring again and picking up his roll of wrap. He turns, unwinding it in a vaguely menacing manner. “I think you'll feel a bit better after hitting the shit out of something.”
By the time they’ve talked some more, been for a walk in the snow to tire Anna out, had dinner, put Anna through her bedtime routine, watched a film, got ready for bed themselves...he’s about ready to explode. Trying to keep it in literally keeps him awake, so he finds himself tiptoeing down the hall to room number #2, the one Bucky and Clint have claimed. He deliberately makes noise when he gets close to the door, knocking very softly so he wakes Bucky but not Anna. Even as he pushes the door open over the thick carpet and waits for his eyes to adjust, Bucky is sitting up in the bed, rubbing at his eyes and yawning.
Steve sends Arto a reproachful look. “See, you were being cross, and that means you’re not thinking about-”
Steve’s smile slips into something smaller but more real. “Yeah,” he says heavily. “I’d like that, Art.”
“And Tony has said that he’s not divorcing Steve, so there’s your answer,” Bucky says. He picks up his jacket from the back of the couch, swings it on. “Okay. Steve wants to be left alone, so Arto, me and you are going out.”
The words are barely out of his mouth before Arto springs to his feet with an unholy shriek, throwing his hands in the air. Clint throws himself backwards with a yell, and lands on his back on the couch. Laughing uncontrollably, Arto scrambles up onto the couch and sits on his chest.
Clint looks at him for a long moment but doesn’t say anything more about Peter and the vacation. “Which dad?”
When he wakes, Steve is sitting there with his sketchpad on his knee, drawing. Arto makes a noise so that Steve knows he’s awake, pulling his headphones off and tossing them aside.
With Arto’s permission, he gets the hang of it pretty quickly, and he and Natasha rule the night together. Thor and the Warriors are the mice, and decide that pumpkin carrying is both fitting of the tale of Cinderella, and an excellent sport. Clint does not agree. Jane is the cat, which Thor finds vastly amusing. No-one is cast as either the stepmother or the ugly sisters, because Arto doesn’t like bad people and says he doesn’t need them in his version of the story. It does open up a few loopholes as far as plot is concerned, but they let him have it his way.
Steve and Tony both kneel down on the concrete in front of Arto. “What can we do to help?” Tony asks, setting his hands on Arto’s sides. “Give us a hint here.”
“I’m not bisexual either, Nat, will you please stop,” he says, even as a nasty voice in the back of his head points out that he’s shouting about being straight while getting his nails done in pink glitter polish.
“Remember you’ve got to call Peter before ten if you want him to come over,” Tony says. Arto blinks at him for a moment and then it clicks that Tony is giving him an out. He nods quickly and then he’s gone, heading for the stairs and nearly colliding with Bucky as they cross paths in the doorway.
“You’ll have to ask them,” Bucky says. “But from my awesome spying skills I can determine that Nat wants a room here, but Bruce and Lilya are going to stay in the tower during the week but come here at weekends.”
“He’s out so you’ll have to actually deal with me for once,” Arto says spitefully, and feels a jab of vindication as Tony jerks back.
Okay so they’re bickering now, which means no hope of serious conversation. Arto mentally sighs and waits for an opening to change the conversation again. It’s alright, he guesses he can wait.
“I have no idea,” Clint says, gently guiding one of Anna’s hands down, only for the other one to come up as if they’re on some sort of levered mechanism. He pushes that down and then gives up when the other comes back up and grabs at his cheek.
“Well you’ve got it all figured out,” Nat says with a strange little smile. “You registered for the swim yet?”
“You can’t tell anyone,” Peter says, pointing a finger at them both, then without waiting for an answer he walks over to the bare cream wall, then climbs straight up it on his hands and feet like some sort of fucked up lizard man.
punched the guy in the face which was wrong of him, but Steve thought the circumstances meant he should be allowed a little leeway. Privately, he was ridiculously, fiercely proud of his son but he wasn’t going to say that out loud right now.
Arto almost chokes. He could very happily go the rest of his life without ever hearing Tony say that word again. Regardless, he just nods. “Mostly,” he says. “I was only...six?”
“Well, the parts don’t make him female, there’s the nuances of language for you,” Natasha says. “But you’re getting there.”
“Really,” Steve says, folding his fingers around Arto’s. He rubs his own thumb against Arto’s slightly chewed nail polish. “I wish I knew the answers here. I’m sorry I don’t.”
Arto nods dizzily and complies. He slides back and sits on his ass on the carpet, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Steve stays within touching distance, still sitting back on his heels.
Steve takes a deep breath. He gnaws on his lip then flicks the TV over onto a kids' cartoon channel for Anna. “Yes, it matters to me and us,” he says. “But it shouldn’t be national news.”
“Lucky Charms!” Arto shrieks back at him. It’s a mark of how normal this type of thing has become that the people working in reception and on the ground floor don’t even blink or look up.
“You know we bought him a real version of that,” Bucky comments. “With a board and pieces and everything.”
“And super unethical,” Steve sighed, putting both hands on Arto’s shoulders and steering him towards the door. “Don’t tell your dad I did that.”
“Great, I've raised a feral child,” Steve says, but hands over a wrapped breakfast burrito without any further argument.
He claims bedroom #3. While it’s not the biggest, it’s got floor to ceiling windows, two of which look out over the lake. The bed is insanely soft and way bigger than his one at home but he’s not that excited about it. He’s more worried about Steve, who went to drop off his bag in the master bedroom around an hour ago and hasn’t made a peep since.
“Not a chance,” Tony says, and Steve hears him getting up and walking close. He slides onto the seat next to Steve, resting a hand on his knee. “You’re wearing the whole fatherhood thing well.”
Steve’s expression goes pained. “In my opinion, yes,” he says. He sounds like he’s choosing his words very carefully. “But that is not what your opinion should be based on. You shouldn’t be forming an opinion yet because you’ve not spoken to Tony. You wanted to come with me because you wanted to stick with me, not because-”
Steve smiles fondly as Tony slams the door shut, watching him step back away from the car. “He better not be telling me to behave,” Bucky remarks, putting the car in drive. “Alright, let’s go.”
"Oh, no!" Bucky says, waving his metal hand at the screen, where a princess is caught in motion, mid-twirl. "Cinderella! Which is better, Cinderella or Clintina?"
“Came to see you,” Clint says. “I’ve got two days to hang out then I’ve got to go home for Young Avengers shit.”
Steve carries him over to the others, sliding back onto his seat and setting Arto on his knee. Tony slides over Arto’s tablet, some sort of interactive snakes and ladders game already open. Arto leans forwards without a protest or hesitation, tapping his finger on the interactive dice and watching raptly as it rolls across the screen.
Then, after collecting shoes and bag and lunch and tucking Bucky Bear into bed to await Arto’s return, they walk down to the garage and Arto looks at Bucky’s brand new BMW and says, “no.”
So, this is what people mean when an event is like a car crash in slow motion. Arto watches as Steve finds his phone and hits speed dial. Eight hundred miles away, and with only the slightest lag in the feed, Tony at the gala abruptly stops listening to the reporter and picks up his phone.
Arto shrugs, looks at Steve’s back where he’s busy preparing breakfast. “I dunno,” he says, and holds up his hand. “I broke a nail.”
“Well, me and Clint are coming too, we don’t earn enough to pay rent in Manhattan,” Bucky grins. “And here Anna’s got a proper yard to play in you know?”
And he barges in to find Steve sitting on the edge of their fully made bed, twisting his hands together as he stares out the window.
“It’s weird calling you Clint when you’re all…” Bucky says, waving a hand at Clint and his slightly altered state. His eyes flick down to Clint’s chest, the same way they always do whenever anyone mentions the fact that Clint is temporarily in possession of breasts. Steve rolls his eyes; Bucky is nothing but predictable when it comes to Clint.
“People stare anyway, we’re two not-small fellas with a baby. People spend ages trying to work out if we’re queer or not.”
Bucky asks him if he wants to go into pretty much every store he glances at but he shakes his head at the first few. He’s happy just to look. Well, that is until Bucky stops dead in the middle of the street and says, “pick a shop, Short Round, or imma start pickin’ for you.”
Bucky snorts with tired laughter but nods. Arto stares at them for a moment, kind of caught off guard by the kissing and the name calling and stuff. They do know this is his room and not theirs, right?
“Sir, no, sir,” Arto says, already halfway off the bed, leaving his blanket behind. He has to take a moment to get his bearings and remember where the main bathroom is, but then he’s in and locking the door behind him. The bathroom is so insanely fancy, even more so than Steve and Tony’s bathroom back home. Everything is sleek and shining and the bath is a gloriously huge standing tub in the middle of the room. Even better – the bathroom is in the centre of the apartment so there’s no windows which means privacy, which Arto means to take full advantage of.
“Think someone’s tired,” Tony’s voice calls pointedly, and Steve glances back to see that Tony, Bucky and Bruce are all watching him. An irrational hit of paranoia jabs him in the stomach, and he wrestles down the feeling that he’s being tested.
Tony narrows his eyes at him. “Now I’m suspicious,” he says. “What happened to the Fury who didn’t want…?” he trails off, but tips his chin towards Arto, no doubt alluding to the time when Nick had told them to hand Arto over.
In his pocket, his phone buzzes. He scrambles for it, utterly ignoring Steve’s look of exasperation. His heart leaps and then swiftly plummets as he sees it’s only Omari texting him, not Peter.
“Yep,” Arto shrugs, frowning as Bucky marches out of the room. Arto goes to say hello to Anna, who is busy staring at some cartoon on the TV, standing around three feet away from it and occasionally bobbing frantically up and down when the cat character appears. Clint is manning breakfast, multitasking with frying bacon and cutting up fruit.
“Well, as nice as this all is, I have work to do,” Nick says. He walks over and raps his knuckles loudly on the glass window. Steve and Bucky turn around as one, and Steve winces as Nick folds his arms and fixes him with a
Steve just looks at him. “It clearly is a big deal. And if it's important to you I want to talk about it. Don't ask me to just sit by while you struggle. I'm not great at backing off at the best of times.”
Arto looks up and shouts something indecipherable; Nick turns around to see the door opening and Tony wandering in, grinning widely at Arto.
“I know. Idiot of the year award,” Tony says. “I made the wrong call. I was doing it for the right reasons, but I made the wrong call.”
That night he doesn’t argue about going to sleep in honour of his six-year-old self. He just curls up under his blankets and stares at the other twin bed where Steve is sleeping, no more than five feet away.
Nick isn’t regretting his decision to stay with the Rogers kid – at the very least it’s a chance to get to know more about him – but
“Don’t you start,” he says, and Tony leans in to kiss him. His eyes slide shut and he holds his breath in his chest, exhaling slowly through his nose as Tony brushes his fingertips against his jaw.
But he’s a Rogers, so he takes a deep breath and makes himself do it. It being taking hold of Steve’s wrist, tugging him back towards the painting of Saint George. Not looking at Steve, he points at the Princess.
“Whatever,” he snaps, dropping his hands and walking away. Ostentatious, really? Couldn’t Tony have just called then cute or something, not insulted him by saying his nails were
Bucky fixes him with the sort of look that reminds Arto of Natasha. It’s all searching and quiet and makes him feel like his brain is being X-rayed.
“Tony would be calling him a skrull right now,” Steve says, watching Arto holding one of Omari’s hands. “Wow. This is exactly what we wanted, so why am I so annoyed?”
“Try and stop Steve Rogers doing something he’s determined to do?” Tony says. “I don’t have a suit on me, so wrestling him into submission is out.”
“Because that’s where there’s an apartment with my name on the lease,” Steve says. “Well, my name as well as Tony’s.”
“He means, remember the days when you were scared of the baby and treated her like she was made of glass?” Clint calls. “He misses those days.”
“How much would I have to pay you to stop shouting about your nuts in public?” Steve asks, signalling to a cab and reaching back to guide Arto along, a hand on his shoulder.
“Just like a hoodie or something,” Omari says. There’s the sound of shuffling on his end of the line. “I’ll send you a picture.”
He misses that. Having Steve and Tony in the background of his life, just being together. He’s damn lucky. Luckier than Peter and Omari, luckier than La’Taya who doesn’t know her dad, luckier than half the kids he goes to school with. He nudges Steve’s ankle with his sneaker. “Tony’s actually your best friend, right?”
Clint comes to stand next to him, leaning on the counter and passing Anna a piece of strawberry. “I have no idea,” he says.
“Yeah that’s what I said,” Arto says. He sighs, turns to stare out of the window at the darkening sky. “He’s...acting weird. I don’t like it.”
Arto shakes his head. “No,” he says quickly. “It’s okay.” He doesn’t tell Steve but he thinks maybe it’d be better if he just let all the polish come off. No more pink, no more glitter.
He’s woken by a loud banging on his bedroom door. He jerks his head up and has a horrible bleary moment of disorientation, his brain flailing and panicking and trying to work out where he is. Not the tower, not the apartment, not a hotel. The mansion. Right.
Bucky laughs so hard he nearly cries. Steve just sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers. “Don’t tell Sam he said that-”
“Make a list,” Bucky says from the front. He’s slouched down so far in the seat that he looks like he’s trying to slide off of it into the footwell. “You can talk about dismantling gender constructs then your crazy parents then the nightmares.”
Oh. That’s...Arto’ll take that. He nods, fidgets a little because he’s not sure what to say. He sits down on the floor with his back to his bed, holding his phone atop his tucked-up knees.
“We’re friends,” Arto tells Tony. He reaches out for Steve and Steve steps forwards automatically, taking him from Tony and hitching him up. Damn. They look so alike it’s frightening.
Steve doesn’t say anything. His jaw clenches tight and he puts his shield down, folding his arms across his chest. Arto stares as Iron Man shifts slightly, enough so that Arto knows he’s looking at him. A red and gold armoured hand comes up in a wave.
“No, you’re right,” Steve says absently. “I’ve kinda built myself a reputation for being black and white over some things.” He flicks through a few more pages, then passes the book back to Arto. “I don’t have the answer for you, Arto. This is one you’re going to have to figure out yourself.”
, coming towards him with a shopping bag in one hand and his phone in the other. His focus is all on Arto though, eyes concerned and brow furrowed. “Arto? What’s up, pal?”
Clint slouches back towards the couches, slumping down next to Natasha. She closes her book and Steve hears the faint murmurs of their conversation over the sound of the television, which is still on and playing cartoons. Tony has turned his attention to Bruce and is talking about some sort of equation that Reed Richards has apparently sent him to look over; Tony is looking put out and Bruce is looking cautious, so Steve can only assume that Reed has figured out something pretty important. Bucky is just sitting back and watching Arto, pulling absent mindedly at his lower lip.
“Fifty fifty at the moment,” Tony says. “I have faith in your manipulation skills. I mean your parenting skills.”
Pepper’s face re-appears on the console, accompanied by the same chiming sound. Steve bites back another curse but this time answers it.
“I will politely decline,” Bucky says, giving her the finger behind Arto’s back. “Anyway, what were you saying about me and my delicate nineteen forties sensibilities? I hate to break it to you, but people in the forties had eyes, and with my eyes I can see that Clint is clearly a girl right now.”
“Yeah you did,” Arto says, thumping Tony between his shoulder blades. “Steve, where are you?” he asks, face still buried in Tony’s shoulder. “Steve!”
On screen, the reporter is trying to regain some composure. Her smile looks very forced, glued in place to try and cover the startled look that she did have going on. “That’s very cryptic.”
After some wheedling and a blatant bribe - honestly Steve's life would be easier if it were only Arto he had to wrangle - Bucky relents and Steve returns to the tower alone, feeling like he's left a limb behind. Tony greets him in the lobby of the tower in a show of emotional astuteness that only Steve and Arto are ever really privy to. They have lunch and hang out in the workshop: Tony works on one of his multitude of projects and Steve occupies himself by trying to read Catch22 and texting Bucky constantly. Bucky, bless him, shows an unprecedented amount of patience and texts Steve back every time, reassuring him that Arto is fine, he hasn't bitten anyone or cried or broken anything, and therefore doesn't need rescuing.
Arto doesn’t get up yet. He looks at Clint, who nods. “Yeah, I told him,” he says. “He knows full well that shopping may or may not include the men's department and the women's department.”
Arto watches for him a moment and then quickly leans over to kiss Steve on his forehead, before dropping back down and closing his eyes.
“I want to listen,” Arto says, even as the three of them are tumbling into his room, Bucky shutting the door firmly behind them. “What did Tony
for Liz, who puts up with small children when she's trying to work. (and for me, because I miss Arto verse and wanted to write more. I'm not even sorry.)
“Good luck,” Steve says, and Tony leans in and presses a quick kiss to the corner of his mouth before leaving the room. Steve watches him go, feeling uneasy and a little lost. He should probably go with Tony, to at least be there to back him up and help explain to Pepper.
“Coming to speak to you,” Steve sighs. “But instead of catching a flight and using the elevator like a normal person.” He gestures to the armour that’s still hovering outside the window.
“No. Have you fallen in love with Saint George? No? Please don’t make me ask if you’ve fallen in love with the dragon.”
On the TV screen, Tony takes the phone away from his ear and leans back towards the camera. “What do you know, he got my message.”
“Sir, Yes, sir,” Arto says, doing as he’s told as the car flies down the interstate, urgently rushing them back towards New York.
“Tony has also banned anything which involves painting him green,” Steve says. “So no, no turtles this year.”
Arto thinks of Tony, back home. Thinks of the time he and Steve spent together, how they are together. Yeah they’re sickeningly in love and gross some days but mostly they’re just...they laugh. Smile. Talk about things. Bicker about things. Want to hang out together, even when they’re not doing a lot.
“Well, I said my part about the fresh start, didn’t I?” Tony begins. “Well a while back I was looking at your art project about homes and it got me thinking that maybe it was weird we lived where we worked, and in a tower, right? And then when you went to Chicago I checked the paperwork for the building just to check you were on it too and my property paperwork guy reminded me about this place.”
And that does make sense, even to Arto’s completely jumbled up thoughts. He stops attacking the bacon, drops his fork. “Can I call him?”
He settles for asking for a hug instead. A proper one, where Steve squishes him so tight it feels like his organs are being smooshed. Anna comes to join in as well, leaning against him with an ‘ahhhhh,’ and patting at Steve’s face with her hand.
Arto pushes at Steve's eyebrows, trying to get him to open his eyes. “Wake up. Again. I need to tell you something.”
!” Steve shouts, loud and sudden enough to make Arto jump out of his skin, dropping his phone into the footwell. Steve glares at him. “Pepper, don’t answer that!”
Arto tugs at Clint’s hand. He doesn’t want them to start talking about flights and travel and boring things. He wants Clint to ask him more about his nails and his new stuff he’s got going on.
Arto bursts into tears. His hands fly up to cover his face, even more humiliated than before. He hears footsteps and the click and thud of the passenger door, and then he’s turning to bury his face in Clint’s chest, letting strong arms fold around him.
“Well, we’re in Chicago,” Arto says, watching as Steve starts on a little Clint drawing to go with the Bucky. “Clint needs a band-aid on his nose.”
“Make that joke when Bucky is around, I dare you,” Clint points at Pietro. “And Kamala hasn’t met Arto properly, so you can stick it.”
Tony is still highly suspicious. He thinks about using Jarvis to snoop, or calling Peter or Omari to get intel, but decides that he’s going to show personal growth and respect for his son’s boundaries and does neither. Besides, Steve will probably cave soon anyway so then he’ll do the snooping and won’t be able to yell at Tony for it.
“No, smartass,” Steve says. “You’d probably get a lot of followers, so you’re stepping into being a celebrity in your own right. Though on the upside you could tell your own story first hand, which could possibly limit the amount of bullshit TMZ could get out there. And we’d have to seriously consider security. And privacy. Just an example - you’d have to be incredibly careful with what you shared about me. I’m your dad, but I’m also Captain America.”
He puts the shoes on and stands there staring at his feet for a good few minutes, feeling like there’s a balloon in his chest that’s full of joy and rainbows and skittles and shit. He takes around fifty photos and painstakingly goes through them all to find the best one. When he finds it, he sends the snap to Nat and Omari and then after a while, he sends it to Peter as well.
Arto twirls the wrench around in his fingers in a way that is distressingly similar to how Bucky does his knives. “He says I can help.”
Arto does not. He runs around the car, grabs Clint by the hand and drags him across the driveway, waving frantically at Omari. Steve grinds to a halt, slumping against the side of the car and wondering what the hell just happened.
Steve spares a second to wonder if this is really the best idea, and then decides fuck it. “Alright,” he says. “Move up, I’ll help.”
“Ooops,” he says tentatively, and he slides uncertain eyes up to Steve, holding the string out. “Sorry.”
Steve presses his fingers against his eyes, unable to deny how tempted he is to just put the damn film again. It would be four hundred percent easier than battling with Arto - or Bucky - about appropriate methods of transport. And then if Arto doesn’t go to school, Steve doesn’t have to stress about being away from him-
Clint’s voice is easily audible over the noise in the rest of the room, and Steve watches, torn between amusement and despair as Clint walks up and down the length of the couch, feet sinking into the soft cushions. Natasha has long since gone back to her book, sitting in the corner of the couch, and doesn’t even bat an eyelid as Clint steps over her on his journey. Clint is wearing a towel around his shoulders like a cape, and is peering around the room suspiciously. Arto is curled up on the floor at the far end of the couch, knees and arms tucked in underneath him and giggling madly.
“And you are you and I don’t care,” Steve says firmly. “Yes, you’ve got flaws but we all do. Hell, that temper you probably inherited from me anyway.” His voice is suspiciously thick but he’s laughing, and Arto is huffing out a sound somewhere between a sob and a laugh too.
“Leave the phone alone, baby,” Bucky says, reaching out of sight and coming back with a stuffed Hulk toy that he passes to her. Predictably, she tries to shove it in her mouth before happily squashing it against the edge of the counter.
“You love it,” Tony says dismissively. “Your own bunch of wannabe superheroes to train as you see fit? You’re like the puppet-master.”
“Congratulations,” Clint says, leaning against the wall. “You just got outwitted by a seven year old.”
That makes Steve’s mouth drop open and his eyes go all shiny. Shit, shit, shit. Tony’s been gone for half a day and Arto’s broken Steve somehow and should he call home? Tony or Bucky, who’s going to be better right now-?
He stays there, stubbornly hiding his face until he hears someone else coming into the room. He’s hoping for Tony, but is still pretty relieved when he works out that it’s Steve and Bucky.
“This sounds fun,” Tony says, heading towards the coffee maker. “And by fun I think I mean lucky that I overheard this and not Steve, because you know the deal with the Young Avengers, Art-”
“-instead of picking up my calls you pull a stunt on live TV in front of the whole world,” he shouts. “And I - well yes I heard what you said! Yeah, I just. I just. I just.”
Arto shakes his head, dipping his chin down into the collar of his coat and biting at the zip. “My nails are a mess,” he mumbles.
Steve replies by rolling Tony over onto his back, pinning him down and fixing him with a pointed look.
“No,” Tony says too quickly. “He just objected to me being locked in the workshop and he wasn't all that polite about it, you know how he gets-”
He is in love with his new nails as much as he is the old ones. They’re so bright. He can’t stop staring at them. In the cab ride home he takes a picture and sends it to Natasha. She doesn’t reply and he realises that he didn’t expect her to - just like Steve said, she’s sometimes off doing her own thing. Now if Omari didn’t reply within an hour, Arto would suspect that something is wrong.
Tony sighs. “They can’t call you out on it without getting in trouble, so they’re throwing facts up in a particular order so people do the judgmental shit on their own.”
“I sent him a picture of my shoes,” Arto says. Omari doesn’t answer right away and he senses their rapid fire chatter about Peter is over. Time for a subject change. “Hey, I think Steve’s depressed. He keeps sleeping all the time and the news said he and Tony were getting divorced.”
“I did not sign up for this!” Tony shouts but Clint is already on his way out. “Find out why Arto is being weird!”
Steve opens his mouth in affront, ready to object to the fact that Clint just basically called him an evil genius, but priorities. “So what do I do? Call him out on it and talk it out, which will take-”
“Asshole!” Bucky is the first to recover. He’s got a hand inside his backpack, probably holding onto a knife or ten, like he thinks if Arto can’t see them he’ll be stupid enough to assume that Bucky’s not armed.
Bucky stares after her, held in place by Clint leaning on his knees. “Why is she taking my baby to deal with a stroppy teenager?” he demands. “I object.”
Arto feels his mouth falling open. He always knew Tony was rich but that sounds kind of like Tony forgot he owned a mansion. He glances at Steve, who is looking less stunned and more like Tony is explaining the meaning of life, like he’s hooked and could spend the rest of his life listening to Tony talk.
Steve laughs. “Yeah, kind of does,” he says. “How about we order pizza and make a mess? Make it feel more like home?”
“Oh yeah!” Arto enthuses. He picks at the corner of his pillow. “I was thinking of like. A jacket. To match.”
It takes him a while to find Steve; he’d assumed that Steve would be taking the bike but of course that makes no sense seeing as they both have bags. He peers into the new Audi and the Bugatti with no luck and eventually finds Steve sitting in the driver’s seat of his Tesla, thumbing away at something on his phone. The lid of the front trunk is already open so Arto just throws his case in, hits the close button and then climbs into the passenger seat.
“Natasha,” Steve says. “She’s one of my best friends in the world and I don’t speak to her every day. I can go weeks without talking to her, when she’s away on mission. Or when she’s just off doing her own thing.”
“Yeah!” Arto says enthusiastically. There’s the noise of him shifting and when he does look up Nick sees that Arto is now kneeling up in the chair, leaning across the table. The Starkphone is still clutched in his hand, and it would be a lie to say that asking to see it hadn’t crossed Nick’s mind, but he’s not going to.
Bucky snorts with laughter as he walks behind them, pulling open the driver’s door. “He’s got you there,” he says. “Hey, Short Round, what music are we listening to?”
Steve nods in thanks at the security guard who steps over to press the button. The security guard just grins. “Good morning, Master Rogers.”
They stand there in silence again. This seems to be happening a lot with the people in Arto’s life. Great. His usual fun and banter replaced by long and awkward silences.
“One of the Young Avengers,” Clint blurts out, flapping a hand in Tony and Steve’s direction. “That’s why he keeps trying to come and watch training!”
Now that makes Arto raise an eyebrow because one of Steve’s major character defects is being overbearing. Tony obviously is thinking something along the same lines because he meets Arto’s eyes with a wondering look of his own.
“Don’t go without me,” Arto says, grabbing for Steve’s hand. “Everything is stupid and fucked up and I don’t want you to go.”
He’s simply stating it as a fact, but it makes Tony well up alarmingly. He wipes his eyes on the back of his hand. “Yeah,” he says, voice thick. “Okay, are you taking this call to Steve or are we hanging up so I can call him?”
"Green," he says quietly as Arto vanishes inside the building with one last wave, and then turns back towards the car, hoping Bucky will relax the 'Steve is not allowed behind the wheel of my car' rule so he can go home.
Bucky breaks into peals of laughter, slumping forwards over his chair. Natasha’s mouth quirks in an unwilling smile, and Clint is laughing too.
“I don’t expect you to be,” Steve replied, turning to open the door and raising his voice. “Arto, get in here!”
. He looks up at Steve, who is watching Arto carefully, looking like he’s itching to walk over and hug him. God, Tony hopes he doesn’t, Arto
Walking with his new sneakers on his feet and his skirt brushing his knees, he feels vulnerable yet strangely brave. Powerful might be the right word, he’s not sure. He pulls his phone from his pocket and texts Peter, Omari and Nat.
Steve rears back, mouth falling open. Tony feels a similar wave of indignation, though Steve is the more vocal one about it.
Tony inhales and exhales heavily, his chest moving under Arto’s cheek and hand. “Yeah. I’m a workaholic and I’m not going to apologise for that, but I apologise for crossing the line.”
Arto doesn’t reply. He stands there with his hands shoved in his pockets, avoiding Tony’s tired gaze. He doesn't know what to say. He knows his dad is super important and invents all sort of shit which helps the planet but right now he just wants Tony to be
“You’re back!” Arto shouts, and before Nick can say anything, he climbs up and over the desk, jumping into Tony’s arms. Tony makes a pained noise and lifts him up, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
Arto huffs but does deign to keep talking. “I'm male, okay. I like being a brother and a son and a he. So my gender matches my sex, right?“
“Alright troops. One hour and we’re going to retrieve furniture from the Tower and pick out colours for your rooms,” he says to Arto, bouncing Anna on his hip as she fusses, making grabby hands for something in his other hand. “And we’ll also get donuts for breakfast, as long as neither of you two tell on me. I don't want Aunt May to lecture me about diabetes again.”
"Yep, yep thanks Kurt, that's awesome," he says loudly and obviously. "Arto, my friend Kurt lives at your school - you know him, he's the blue guy, right? The one who can teleport? He says he can come to pick you up and take you straight to school, so we don't have to worry about cars or anything. He can take me and Steve at the same time as well, so we can all go together okay?" He returns the phone to his ear. “Yeah, I just asked him,” he says and then looks meaningfully at Arto. “Remember when you said teleporting was the coolest superpower? And you begged Steve to let you have a go and he said no? Well this time you’re allowed! Happy Tuesday!”
Steve’s brow creases. “I think I know this one, but I want to check. You’re not questioning your sexuality?”
Arto regains his footing, seizes Peter around the middle and hugs him so tight he lifts him off the floor. Peter yelps and it’s only then that Arto realises that Omari is there too, grinning widely and bouncing on his heels.
Arto feels very small and stupid at that. “I panicked,” he says, barely more than a mumble. He hears Steve moving around but carries on staring at the counter, trying to work out how he feels about Tony and home and this whole mess. He only stops his staring match with the marble when a plate of waffles and bacon is literally slid into his sight-line.
“It’s Olympic sized!” Clint shouts, doing a cartwheel along the pale blue bottom of the pool. “Who has an Olympic-sized pool in their yard?! This is insane!”
“I kind of do, kiddo. Got a lot to sort out. You two come back home when you’re ready. I’ll be there.”
Clint gives him one last hug - still with coffee mugs in both hands- and heads back to Anna and Bucky. Arto watches him go and then switches off the light before padding along to the master bedroom. He pushes the door open and jumps onto the bed, making Steve jerk away and groan sleepily.
“Took a detour on the way to breakfast,” Steve says, hesitating. Oh god, he never hesitates about anything. “I might be way out of line here… but I want to help and I know that I'm super underqualified. So I got you these.”
“Don’t worry Papa Stark, we were sensible,” he grins at him, before leaning back and patting his stomach. “I did a pregnancy test just to make double sure. Well, Bruce did when he did his fancy-pants bloodwork. No little baby Buckys in here.”
Oh god. Tony thinks he might die of embarrassment on Arto’s behalf. It’s not something Tony usually feels so it’s both unwelcome and downright
“Hi, Tulio,” Arto says automatically and Steve glances apologetically at Tulio, who just waves him off with a laugh. Steve steps into the elevator, and as the doors slide Arto wriggles free. He leans against Steve with arms outstretched, hands plucking at his shirt.
“So, he’s got a crush,” he says, hoping he sounds calm and nonchalant rather than like he needs to go and check on Arto right-this-moment-now. “Who?”
“Stop jumping from things, we’ve been over this,” he says. “What did you do with Steve? Is he still - oh for god’s sake.” Tony spots Steve through the window, and promptly walks over to the glass partition. “Art, bang on the window. Don’t break it, just be noisy and annoying.”
Tony replies by sweeping away the remainder of the screens in one go. He looks tired, and suddenly old. It makes Arto shiver, unease crawling down his spine. Steve looks how he’s always looked, perpetually in his mid-twenties, but Tony’s face is more lined than ever and he’s got flashes of grey at his temples that the others tease him for. He rebuffs it with easy grins and jokes about being a silver fox, but in that moment it doesn't feel remotely funny to Arto at all.
“Okay. Shaking hands is what people that aren’t Clint Barton do,” he says. “When you meet someone, you tell them your name, shake their hand and say nice to meet you. It’s polite.”
Arto nods. “You just were doing a bad job of showing it,” he says before he can stop himself, and Tony visibly flinches.
Steve ignores the joke. In fact, he is starting to look distinctly unimpressed, though Arto can't tell if that expression is being directed at Clint or at screen-Tony. "Maybe she’s wearing it to distract from the fact that Tony looks like shit.”
“Manhattan is chaos. There’s like an army of removal trucks blocking the street outside the tower and Coulson is here with a SHIELD jet to start shifting sensitive data and equipment.”
And Arto laughs, wet and thick. He sits up, wiping his sleeve under his nose and hicupping in an uneven breath. His anger is all gone, and now he’s tired and shaky and just wants to curl up in Steve’s arms like he really is Baby Rogers all over again.
Arto shakes his head at Steve’s interjection and he hangs up the call. “I’m not talking to him,” he says, too loud. “I don’t want to. It's Peter and I don't want-”
“You’ll be fine,” Clint says, dropping a kiss to Anna’s head. “Bucky’ll be here in like ten, just keep her alive until then.”
Tony nods slowly, looking impressed. “Look at us, having a real mature conversation. In the middle of a cafeteria in the world’s most boring museum.”
Arto can’t move, can’t even think. He wants to scream, to drown out the nasty voice in his head that is telling him that his family has fallen apart.
“Whatever,” Bucky rolls his eyes but does lean down to kiss Clint. “I got it," he says, holding up bags from the store, “and also got her a thing.”
Tony opens his mouth to say something but again he seems to give up. He just shakes his head and he’s turning away, already looking back to the fucking workshop like that’s more important than Steve or Arto.
“Because me and Bruce think we’ve got something that could pretty much save the world, Art,” Tony tells him bluntly. “It’s technology being used in an unprecedented way and we think we could- well, I know we could help fix a lot of people up.”
Bucky looks alarmed, holding his hands up out of the way and grimacing as Arto winds an arm around his neck and clings on for dear life, still making muffled noises into Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky glances at Steve, still looking lost and like he’s got no idea what to do with Arto. In Bucky’s defense, Arto isn’t usually hands on with him, and is only ever close to him either because he’s with Clint and Bucky kinda comes as part of the package, or when he’s being restrained.
He slides his phone under his pillow and closes his eyes, wishing he was little enough to get away with crawling into Steve’s bed so he didn’t have to feel so alone.
“Yeah,” Arto replies sullenly, but doesn’t move. Tony rolls his eyes and then shoves back at him so he’s got enough room to maneuver, twisting around and wrapping Arto’s ever-growing frame into a hug.
“Going away,” Steve says, far too cheerfully. “I’ll go and fetch breakfast, you okay on your own for an hour?”
“Because I want to use my spider powers to help people and stuff you know? Fight crime. But your dads are Captain America and Iron Man and if they knew they’d stop me because they’ll say I’m too young.”
Arto doesn't know what to say to that, so he just looks at his knees and fiddles with the corner of his pillow. “It…was good,” he finally says. “I get so angry sometimes and there was so much going on and it just…”
“Sure,” Natasha says. “Shall we talk about how the Young Avengers including the love of your life are back in for training soon?”
Despite how tired he is, he stays up for a while, flicking through his phone. He looks at some of the photos of him and Anna, exits out of his gallery before he can look at the pictures of him and Peter in the chem lab at school. He re-reads the article about himself that was on TMZ, checks to see if there’s any news about any of the other Avengers. He opens StarkSearch and types in pink headband and chickens out before he actually hits search.
Arto cringes; here in the cold light of morning, when he's rested and not being an emotional wreck, his meltdown seems so stupid. “It's okay it's not a big deal,” he says quickly.
“You know me so well,” Steve huffs, using the wall to push himself up. “Come on then, if you’re going to get pizza, you better go before I change my mind.”
“Don’t forget when he’s in trouble at school, he’s yours then, too,” Tony says, finally close enough to reach out and push the paperwork down. Steve lets him without too much of a fight, sighing and rubbing at his eyes with his fingertips.
Tony opens the door to the workshop. “Cut the alarms,” he says to the ceiling, then turns concerned eyes on Arto. “So the busting down doors thing is usually your dad’s game. What’s wrong?”
Arto snatches the box from Bucky and tears into it. The unholy shriek he makes when he looks into it makes the hours of rifling through cereal worth it.
And he pretty much has a heart attack anyway as he steps out of the elevator to find Anna toddling towards him as fast as her little legs can carry her. He makes a wordless exclamation and runs to her, scooping her up and making her shriek with laughter.
Arto nods vigorously. “I like having my own space. Can we get a buzzer on the door at the end of the corridor?”
“Good job you didn't get extensions on your nails,” Bucky says. “This wouldn't work if they were long.”
“What happened to him being spoiled?” Steve asks, wandering closer and still deciding if he’s going to be exasperated or amused.
“Exactly! It’s that! Just that! It’s not complicated or anything, it’s just my taste in clothes! Well, I think anyway. It might just be some things, not like all clothes.”
“No I’ll do it, better say goodbye,” Steve says, pushing away from the car and walking across the drive. Arto meets him halfway, running at him with such speed that Steve wonders if he’s changed his mind again and is about to beg Steve to take him back again.
“Fuck you,” Arto spits back, but his voice cracks and he feels embarrassment and shame flare up inside him, humiliation only making him angrier. He revs the engine again, lets the Audi leap forwards a couple of feet, almost brushing Clint’s shins. Clint doesn’t even flinch, and Arto wants to get out and punch him, to knock him down and have Clint come and hug him and tell him he’s not messed it up-
Just to prove a point to himself, he texts the same picture to Omari. Within a minute, he gets a text back that consists of four thumbs up emojis and the words ‘
Steve sighs. Looks at the drawing of Arto he’s done next to the one of himself. They’re almost the same height in cartoon form, though the Steve one looks more serious.
That’s good enough for him. He ducks back into the bathroom and makes sure the door is most definitely locked.
“I’d have a shield,” Steve says, leaning forwards to add another empty beer bottle to the collection he’s got going on on the coffee table. Arto’d be worried if he didn’t know that the stuff doesn’t touch Steve in the slightest.
Fuck. They’ve only just got over Arto’s epic meltdown when he was told that the ginger tabby which frequents the park wasn’t actually his for the taking.
It’s super late by the time he comes out. Steve is back: he knocked on the wall and then left when Arto didn’t respond. Clint appeared to slide a boxed pizza into the bolthole a few hours later. Arto was determined to not eat it but caved after only about three minutes of resolutely ignoring the smell of pepperoni and ham.
. Steve doesn’t know about his stress-relief workout and he wants to keep it that way, thanks very much.
“Green,” Tony murmurs from across the table, and Steve jerks his head up, feeling himself flushing, an uncomfortable hot rise in his chest. Luckily they’re alone at the table; somehow, both Bruce and Bucky have relocated to the couches whilst Steve has been busy playing snakes and ladders with Arto, and damn it, he’s not on form if he didnt even notice that happening right under his nose.
Tony looks up with a frown; he and Arto are elbow deep in the engine for his new bike - the bike that it has taken them six months to persuade Steve to let them build - and suddenly the kid wants to bail?
Steve leans over him, resting his chin on Arto’s shoulder and wrapping his arms back around him. “And I’ll tell you now,” he murmurs. “Tony would say exactly the same as I’m saying, though probably with more metaphors and gesticulating.”
Okay, that’s not where Arto expected this conversation to go. He honestly expected a conversation to make him feel better, not one that makes him feel dumb and wrong and like he’s got no idea how to be a proper person.
Then he remembers what it was like before he was a parent and was allowed to sleep for a solid twelve hours. “If you let me go back to sleep,” he mumbles, eyes already closed. “And you get ready without a fuss when it’s time, then yes. We will get there however you want.”
to make,” Steve says, eyes on the road. His jaw is doing that clenched-jumpy thing which spells out trouble. “To anyone else it seems crazy but it probably makes perfect sense to Tony.”
“As you were,” Bucky nods at a scandalized looking salesperson, all polite smiles before he turns back to Arto with a shrug. “Honestly, who gives a shit?” he says. “I can find a guy who loves me even though I’m a chewed up vet with one arm and some serious anger management issues. You’ll find a girl who likes you, no matter what you’re wearing.”
“Future Arto has to go to school,” Arto says, reaching out towards Tony with his fingers spread. “I’m not in the future so I don’t have to.”
, what is he meant to do? Just not think about sex at all ever? Keep his hands to himself just because his dad is being awkward and embarrassing and weird? Yeah, not going to happen. He doesn’t say anything out loud though, just goes along with Steve’s plan of denial.
Arto frowns. Tony doesn’t usually mind him being in here if he’s supervised. He takes another step, peering over the edge of the medical screen that’s next to the workbench.
“That’s great!” Wanda says and Arto smiles back at her, tentative but proud. He opens his mouth to say something back but he’s left too large a gap after her response and she’s already turned away and is talking to Kate, and Arto is back to looking like a very desperate fish out of water.
Steve plays his turns on the game dutifully, though he’ll admit that his attention isn't there. His eyes slide to the family tree that has been stuck on the front of the refrigerator, held in place by two magnets in the shape of Mjolnir and the Hulk. He stares at the picture of himself, of the green line connecting him to Arto, thinking about Arto whispering ‘green’ to him earlier.
Steve seems to consider that. He’s being very calm and thoughtful which Arto is grateful for; he doesn’t think he’d get through this if Steve were freaking out too. “And you’re upset and panicking because you’re drawn towards clothes that are typically for girls.”
The workshop doors are locked when he gets down there. Unable to see where Tony is, he presses in his code but is met with a red light and an apology from Jarvis. Arto’s about at the end of his admittedly short tether so he resorts for banging on the glass with his fist, despite Jarvis’s alarmed protests.
“I want to come home,” Steve is saying. “I know, yes, I know. We can deal with the press, we’ve been dealing with the press for ten years.” He pauses, laughs unsteadily. “No. Not forgiven for that. The whole country saw your stunt- no I don’t know the ratings, the point is that...yeah, that’s exactly the point.” There’s another long pause, he’s obviously listening. And then he says, “Yes. Okay, okay, we’ll come home, I’ll get everything packed up in the morning-”
He uses his tablet app to check where everyone is and finds himself skulking into the gym. Well, he would say he walks in like a normal person but the moment he steps past the threshold Bucky calls “why are you skulking around?”, so maybe he missed the mark.
It takes hours for Arto to go down that night. He whines and sulks and sneaks out of his bed and into Tony and Steve’s, and the night ends with Steve sitting on the end of his bed with him until he falls asleep, then easing away and padding down into the communal area to get something to eat and drink.
“No, Tony,” Steve says with a sigh, and goes to step in before the coffee table meets an untimely end.
He wakes up in his own bed the next morning. He’s tempted to stay in it all day but Bucky, Clint and Anna are leaving today and he wants to see them off. With that in mind, he drags himself up and through the shower, getting dressed and slipping his new sneakers on. His pulse quickens slightly at the thought of wearing them outside - where people can
“Seriously, what did Tony do that means he needs to apologize on TV?” Arto says. “Will someone just tell me?!”
“Just because everyone else in the house is gay doesn’t mean I am,” Arto says loudly, and then, “Sorry.”
Steve smiles weakly. “Green,” he murmurs back, and looks over his shoulder as he hears approaching footsteps. It’s Tony, looking concerned and spinning his sunglasses around by the arm.
He comes to an abrupt halt when he spots Clint and Bucky sitting at the counter, which is not unusual in itself even at two AM. He’s more distracted by the fact there are countless boxes of Lucky Charms spread over the polished marble, and the way they’re both systematically going through the opened ones, picking out the marshmallows.
She holds out her arms so Steve capitulates, taking her and giving Arto a chance to wrestle out of his coat. He tosses it onto the back of a chair and then clambers onto the couch, pushing at Clint for a hug. He’s practically vibrating with excitement, wants to blurt out all of his news and the things he’s discovered. He wrestles back out of the hug and opens his mouth, finds he can’t find the words so he just settles for shoving his hands in Clint’s face.
“Alright, I’m out of here,” Bucky says. “I’ll call you when airport security undoubtedly freak out and don’t believe my medical certificates.”
at them and Arto could honestly just die right then and there. He’s going to strangle himself with the drawstring from the hoodie to escape the embarrassment.
He shoves the phone back at Tony. “If it’s so okay for me to be having my nails done, why are they bothering to report on it?”
Arto heads for the fridge, yanking it open and gazing into it without even looking. He remembers being in the nail bar, that sensation catching inside him, that roll of excitement and happiness that had snagged hard. He can’t shake it free, it’s like he’s caught on something and he doesn’t want to have to give it up. At the same time, he kind of wishes it would go away, because it’s making him feel hot and shamed and like he needs to crawl away and hide.
The exasperation comes back. “You came down here to smash open the door and you don’t know why?” Tony asks, edging into incredulous. “I thought we were over this, Art.”
“Well I’m bored of paperwork too,” she says, pulling her apartment door closed. “Let’s go. Get your coat.”
He shakes his head, grinning into his sandwich. Maybe he’ll talk to Steve about setting up an Instagram of his own. Then he can make sure he gets his damn shoes in the shot.
"Absolutely not," Steve says and bends down to pick Arto up, tossing him over his shoulder. "You really thought I'd say yes to that? Come on."
“And I was so convinced it would work...I was so desperate for it to work that I decided to just go ahead and test it on myself,” Tony says. “And Steve was so angry because at that point we were only eighty-three percent sure it would work as intended.”
Arto turns his eyes from the wall to look at his own hands, watching as Bucky works. “Do you think they're stupid?”
“Because Tony said my nails were dumb and he was all like yeah everyone will judge you and why are you suddenly wearing nails it’s a stupid habit.”
“I’m still on Smol Avengers clock,” Clint protests, but takes her anyway. Kate and Pietro both immediately crowd around, Pietro stroking the back of Anna’s hand with his finger and grinning with delight as she grasps hold. Kamala stays on her seat, blushing some more as Steve strikes up friendly conversation. He glances over to Tony with a meaningful look that Tony interprets as
“Fine,” Arto whines, dragging the word out into epic proportions. “But quick, you have to see, Steve you have to see, there’s a thing and I want to win and-”
He decides to ignore that complex contradiction and stick with his ‘I do what I want’ attitude, like the whole nail varnish thing is just about being obnoxious. He grabs a fudge-flavoured milkshake that is probably Clint’s, kicking the fridge shut with his heel.
Arto nods, though doesn’t look happy about it. “She doesn’t even know who I am,” he suddenly says, full of teenage hormonal angst. Tony resists the urge to point out that that is rather over the top. He is half Stark, after all. Over the top is like default setting.
Just before he climbs into the tub, something occurs to him. He opens the door a fraction, sticks his head out into the hallway.
Oh. Arto had never thought of it that way. He’s sort of famous, seeing as his dads are Captain America and Iron Man, and if he goes out there and does his own thing maybe it will make it easier for other people to do their own thing. Though that idea seems huge and scary right now, and he’s not sure he’s cut out for being a role model anyway.
Making Arto wash his own face seems like a battle that Steve doesn't need to entertain right now so he hefts Arto up and carries him over to the kitchen area, sitting him on the counter next to the sink. Arto watches as he turns the water on, reaching out to trace his fingertips over Steve's wrist.
And double great, now he’s thinking about being unfair to gay people and naturally that makes him think about his parents and he’s now gone from thinking about poptarts to sex to his dads and now he’s definitely going to go and kill himself, thanks.
“Time to go,” Steve says, pressing the lid of his disposable cup back over his drink and ducking back into the car. Arto hastily scrambles into his side, pinning Steve with a narrow-eyed glare as Steve starts the car.
He drops his fork, abruptly wanting nothing more than to go lock himself in his room with incognito mode on his phone and Jarvis banned from recording. And then has a moment to despair because a moment ago he was thinking about poptarts and now he’s thinking about sex and he’s got no idea how or why he’s gone from a to b. God, if he could just kill his own body for the way it’s behaving right now he would. Kill it and donate it to medical science - actually, scratch that, scientists suck dick unless they’re Bruce.
Mid-morning finds them taking a cab to the Art Institute of Chicago, which Arto manages to be insanely excited about even with everything else ticking over in the back of his brain. Steve does not seem as excited as he should be considering art; he’s got his cap pulled low over his face and seems to be kind of lost. Not in a
“Ha, good joke,” Steve says, pulling his phone out of his pocket. For one wild moment Arto thinks that a Steve is going to call a therapist but when he leans over he sees that Steve is just scrolling through his work emails.
He didn’t think that anyone could feel worse but the way Tony is looking right now...Steve was right. He doesn’t know what to say though, torn between doing something to make Tony feel better and letting him sit there and feel exactly as shit as he deserves.
“Whoa,” Clint says, jerking his face back out of fist range. He blinks Arto’s fingernails into focus, taking hold of Arto’s wrist. “Hey, new nails!”
Normally he would grin and tell her that he’s everyone’s problem, but today he just can’t do it. Between Peter ignoring him and Tony’s ever-increasing isolation in the workshop and the stupid anxious curl in his belly, he can’t. He does try, but he barely gets the first words out before he feels his voice crack.
“But then he might start moping over Better-Hawkeye again,” Tony says. “Please, no more of the moping. I can’t take any more moping, or any more of him being weird.”
“That has no impact on who he wants to…well.” Steve clears his throat, moving on which is great because if he mentions sex again then Arto will die of embarrassment. “Are you saying that he should be? What about me? Am
“Are you kidding me? School is the best,” Steve says with a wan smile. “You get to learn things and make friends. Omari will be there, remember?”
“Bucky’s staying with you two a few more days,” Clint says, watching him go. “He’s bad at goodbyes. If he cries, it’ll ruin his rep.”
Sam gets out his phone and does a terrible job of acting casual as he phones Nat. Arto hears the words
“You have to be dead to qualify as a martyr,” Steve says distractedly. “As if they’re reporting on this like it matters.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Bucky’s already married, I can’t marry him,” he says, and then hastily backtracks, possibly when he sees the look on Arto’s face. “Sorry, bad joke. The only person I want to be married to is Tony.”
He takes the cushion away from his face. Sam meets his questioning expression and shrugs. “Maybe they’re… making up.”
Steve fishes his phone out of his pocket and hits speed dial. Arto holds his breath but it rings and rings and then goes to voicemail, Tony’s voice telling them to not bother leaving a message because he won’t check them. Steve makes an irritated noise in the back of his throat and shoves his phone back into his sweats. “Whatever,” he says, and pulls Arto back around into a bone-crushing hug.
Steve starts to wander, looking towards the next painting. It’s not as interesting as Saint George but Arto follows anyway. “Bucky’s not girly in any way at all.”
Arto’s face crumples, and he pushes at Steve harder. “Not too strong,” he begins, but then stops, chin wobbling. “Strongest.”
Next to Arto, Steve snorts with laughter. Bruce makes some comment about the mechanics of Bucky’s arm withstanding mashed potato. Tony chips in with a joke that has Clint laughing. Arto’s attention slides away, back to where his phone is on his knee, hidden by the edge of the counter. He’s not supposed to have it while they’re eating but he needs to see if Peter has text him back yet-
“Hey Steve, I need you to come and sign some paperwork,” a voice calls from the top of the open stairwell, and Steve drops his hands to glare balefully at the bit of Clint he can see. He’s about to tell him to shove his paperwork, when he catches the way Clint is staring meaningfully at him. He acquiesces and goes over, following Clint down several steps so they’re out of tiny-spy hearing range.
“What, like your nail varnish is?” Clint says, nonplussed. “Are you turning into a social justice warrior? Is that what’s happening here?”
“Are all your lady Barton parts in working order? Because I think one baby super soldier is enough for this tower.”
Tony isn’t so sure; he’s still sort of butthurt by Arto saying that he’d rather go to Bucky than him, but he kind of senses that that is how it’s going to go with things like this. Taking a back seat for once is not something he wants to do, but he kind of gets it.
He sends it and then quickly forwards it to Peter too. He catches Steve quite blatantly watching him text under the table, but is pleasantly surprised when Steve just smiles and gives him an eye roll. With that taken as permission, he quickly texts La-Taya and Natasha too.
“What can I do? ” Tony says. “Tell me what I can do from here and I’ll do it. Anything, everything. Money or time no object.”
“Alright,” Nick says, suitably impressed. “You saved me an hour of dealing with the WSC, consider that payment for babysitting.”
Something not too distant from fear works down Arto’s spine. “You’re just-” he starts, but he doesn't know how to finish.
“Well, he says he always considered himself straight and then Bucky happened,” Steve shrugs. “He doesn’t question it, just says Bucky is an outlier and should not be counted.”
Arto nods and Tony slides his palms over Arto’s ears before turning to Steve. “I’ve ordered dinner, Pepper is staying a few days, she’s agreed to not tell the board anything, she still thinks I’m only doing this for you, I may have told her to go fuck herself, she is majorly concerned that I am not cut out for raising a child.”
Omari calls him back literally two seconds after the message clears to Peter. Grinning, Arto answers it and throws himself back onto his bed.
The next day, Arto is awful. He’s snotty and rude and upsets Anna at breakfast by shouting at Steve, and then storms off in a huff. Steve looks heavenward and visibly counts to ten, and Tony leans across the table, head in his hands. He peers up across at Clint, Bucky and Anna, looks to Sam and Rhodey and then finally at Nat.
Steve chuckles at that. “You know, I thought him having a baby would make him less scary,” he muses. “Let the world see his gentler side. But no, now he’s gone overprotective and downright terrifying.”
“Took him for pancakes,” Tony shrugs, leaning back and smoothing his hands over Steve’s armour-clad shoulders. “I’m sorry, but the only way you could fix this one was by backing off.”
Tony shakes his head violently, Steve winces and Arto sits bolt upright, knocking his breakfast to the floor, a fraction of a second before he elevator dings merrily open, spilling Clint and his brood of baby superheroes out into the communal floor.
He shakes his head. He’s not thinking about that, not ever. He’s got enough crap to deal with. Besides, he got rescued and that’s the end of it. He doesn’t need to think about it.
Arto grins at him, bright and happy. “Clint can be the pumpkin!” he enthuses. “It doesn’t matter if a pumpkin is a boy or a girl!”
“Pink glitter polish doesn't make someone gay! You're like the opposite of pink glitter and you're gay as shit.”
“I think he might be a tad spoiled,” Tony says, leaning down to heft Arto up off the floor and sitting down with him, rocking him back and forth and trying to shush him, a gentle hand running over his head.
he tells himself, even as he’s picturing what he’d look like wearing Anna’s headband. It’s sit right across his forehead and pull across the tops of his ears and how would it look against his blond hair and not Anna’s brown-
“Sure,” Bucky says, like he’s just agreeing because he doesn’t want to get in an argument. Arto would call him out on how annoying it is to be spoken to like he’s a kid, but he wants very badly for Bucky to let him hit things.
Arto just turns over, pressing his face in the couch cushions and refusing to look at any of them. His brain is a mess, like he’s Alice falling down a rabbit hole of pink confusion. God, liking his nails was one thing but wanting Anna’s headband is another, more ridiculous thing.
“Fuck you,” Arto tells the phone, his voice cracking, and then he storms out of the room and heads down to the communal floor.
“You heard him earlier. He’s learned his lesson,” Steve says calmly. “But I do understand that you’ve not had long to process. We won’t go back until you’re ready.”
Chapter 15 of Counterpart- the original version. Found this on my other laptop and didn't just want to delete it. I don't know the exact reasons for not using this version - something to do with needing this bit to be in Tony's point of view? Anyway, enjoy.
He should probably try and turn that into words or something. Say something nice and sincere. He opens his mouth, and what comes out is, “Can we have pizza again?”
“Come with me,” Arto insists, tugging on Steve’s hand with both of his own, still making no move towards the car. The door is open. Bucky bear is already inside. His lunchbox is also inside, and filled with the sort of snacks he normally has rationed. Clint is in the passenger seat, twisted around and watching patiently through the open back door.
“Yeah when I was younger, when you’re young it doesn’t matter,” Arto says, his voice getting louder and more high pitched. “You don’t know anything when you’re young, and I’m seventeen and my brain is breaking-”
” he begins, and then cuts himself off. Good, because Bucky has taken to pinching people who cuss in front of Anna.
Great, now Arto feels super-awful. Bucky and Clint are like Omari’s friends too and Arto’s so petty and stupid about it that he probably doesn’t deserve any of them.
A strange thrill goes through Arto at that, a response to the implication in Bucky’s words. “Shopping for me?”
“I’m sure you are,” Natasha says with a smile, walking over to the fridge and pulling out her bottle of juice, standing next to Steve and leaning back on the counter. “So, still no change?”
Well, whether or not he’s entertaining, and regardless of the fact the kid seems happy to be in here, Nick has work to do. The horrid tedious kind that involves telling the WSC what the CIA told Mi6 told Interpol told SHIELD, which everyone knows about anyway. He’d much rather be planning intelligence sweeps and giving the green light to Stark’s proposed new jet-scheme, but bureaucracy comes first.
"It's part of emergency evacuation plan F," Clint says with a shrug, like coming up with that many contingency plans is normal. Everyone knows you should come up with one decent plan, one decent backup plan, then if it doesn't work you wing it.
"You know what, this is boring, so predictable, I don't have time for you and your self-righteous face, this is nothing to do with you-"
“Yes,” Arto says honestly. “There's so many words, right? But I'm not any of them. I don't think, anyway. I'm not genderqueer or non-binary or transgender or any of those. I'm a boy. A man.”
“I’m fine,” Arto says loudly, and then his bottom lip wobbles. “How come I still don’t know how to talk to people properly?”
“Maybe I want the world to know how great my dad is,” he says. “Because he’s my dad and not just Captain America.”
He latches onto the thought. It’s like an anchor, stabilizing his whirling thoughts. Giving him enough strength to slowly stand up and take a deep breath.
Arto feels some of the tension unwind, and he nods wordlessly. He drinks half the water, eats eight cookies and slips back into bed.
He doesn't want to think about it. What he wants to do is sit with his dad and just watch some quasi-accurate, roman ass-kicking. So he curls up on the couch and shoves all the pillows aside so there’s space for Tony. He gets the hint and drops into the space; the easy familiarity of his makes tears prickle in his eyes. This is all he’s wanted for months, just for Tony to be here with him like he used to be. He turns into Tony’s side, resting his head on his chest and tapping his fingers against the edge of the arc reactor.
Bucky’s face does something weird and scrunchy and then he’s striding over to Steve and hugging him. Steve hugs him back, clinging on in a way he really hopes Bucky doesn’t mention.
“Not it,” Bucky promptly replies and Steve concedes and goes to sit behind Natasha, putting his coffee aside.
“No, that’s now two weeks of weirdness, I’m intervening,” Steve says, and then raises his voice. “Hey Arto, who’re you texting?”
Arto nods and slithers off the counter, going to find his shoes. Steve watches him go, reaching out to lean on Tony’s shoulder. “I hope this works,” he says in an undertone.
They stop once in Pennsylvania to stretch their legs and get coffee. Steve has gone from making awful jokes to not saying anything at all. Arto has got no idea how to make it better so he doesn’t say anything either.
Tony's mouth opens and closes a few times. He's actually speechless, which Steve would find funny if he wasn't also indignantly sputtering. "No," Tony repeats. "What's no in Russian? No."
“Hi Dad!” Arto shouts before momentum sends them sliding across the landing and vanishing down the next set of stairs at an alarming sideways angle.
“Steve wouldn’t give a shit if you decided to wear a glittery pink onesie for the rest of your life,” Bucky says, taking a swing at the bag. “And the news talks shit all the time, why is that suddenly bothering you?”
“Yeah, he’s making breakfast, he only just got up,” Arto says. Bucky’s face does something funny at that, some play of emotion that Arto doesn’t understand. “There’s no Jarvis here, it’s weird.”
Steve eyed the reporter with disdain, letting it show on his face and in the way he folded his arms across his chest.
“It looks like you already moved us!” Steve yells. A pair of workmen who were trying to get out the door past Tony freeze, slowly turn around and head back inside.
They stop again in a town somewhere in the middle of Ohio. Steve has apparently planned ahead because he pulls up at a garage that has two tesla charging points, one of them with a reserved sign hanging neatly in front of it. He gets out of the car with a terse “wait here,” to Arto, who refuses to even acknowledge that Steve has said anything.
The moment Arto claps eyes on him, he starts to cry again. Steve just crumples, his shoulders slumping and his face falling, and then he’s there. He’s on his knees on the floor, holding his hands out but hesitating, like he’s scared Arto is going to push him away.
“Hey, Short Round,” Bucky says. He shifts around, sets the phone down his end and Arto’s heart does a happy little jump as he sees Bucky has got Anna on his hip. She doesn’t have her pink bow on this morning, which he’s ridiculously relieved about. “He’s on duty with the Young Avengers, you okay?”
“Exactly,” Tony says. “You think he’s gonna give us another ‘this is why I should be allowed to be a Young Avenger even though we’ve been over it eight times’ speech?”
“Hi I’m Arto Rogers nice to meet you,” the kid rattles off, and then pulls his hand back. “Are we friends now?”
Arto focusses on playing around with the front console. His nails make it surprisingly difficult to navigate the touch screen, like the added millimetres of gel polish have somehow rendered his fingers completely incapable. When he gets the hang of it - angling his fingers slightly differently to compensate - he tries flicking through digital radio stations before dismissing them all and syncing up his cell. He deliberately keeps his eyes down, not watching as they pull away from Avengers Tower.
Steve shrugs, turns on the ignition. “Tony’s always telling me to get the goddamn Tesla out of his garage. I’m doing as I’m told.”
Steve nods. “That's true. You're not a finished article. I mean, look at Clint. How old was he when he got together with Bucky? He'd been straight up until that point.”
He wakes up in the morning and dozes for a while before he remembers - bath, revelation, identity, ahhh - that he has stuff he needs to tell someone, like now. Which is why he ends up climbing into Steve's bed at eleven AM, whispering his name in increasingly louder increments to get him to wake up.
He waits barely four seconds before his phone starts to ring, and really he should have expected that from Tony. He’s like the most impatient person on the planet. Arto’s seen him override government level security to put calls through to Steve when he wants to make a point. Honestly, he’s a little afraid his phone will answer itself.
Not actually a prompt but came from a lovely message from whedonite-whovian-winchester on Tumblr. "Have you seen the news about marshmallow only Lucky Charms? I feel Arto would like this news a LOT."
He holds ferociously onto his anger as he goes to find Tony, carrying it like a flaming brand in his chest. Surprise surprise, Tony is in the motherfucking workshop. Bruce is there too and it looks like they're arguing as well, though in a  much more restrained way than Steve and Tony were. Arto thinks about punching the glass in, shattering the whole damn thing but before he can, Tony is up and at the door.
“Okay,” Tony says. “That’s okay, We can work with that. Hey, you remember when Clint was given a vagina by that thing on Asgard?”
“Why’s she wearing that dumb headband anyway,” he snaps before he can think about what he’s actually saying. “Are you scared people won’t know she’s a girl?”
Arto ignores that. “He wears it over a hoodie. I could do that. But a pink hoodie, not a black one.”
Clint squints at Bucky from where he’s sitting on the floor with his crossed legs tucked under a thick afghan which includes more shades of purple than Steve knew existed. Arto is behind him, crouched back on his heels and carefully massaging heart shapes into Clint’s back. He's concentrating on what he's doing, which is only really happening because the film he'd been adamantly watching for the second time that morning has been paused. He'd looked at Steve with utter betrayal when he'd taken the remote from him, and then turned the look on the ceiling when Jarvis had apologetically told him that he wasn't going to restart the film until he'd completed massage-time.
“You want me to go, kid?” Sam asks. Arto think for a moment and then shakes his head. Sam’s pretty great at talking about feelings and he’s also really good at stopping Steve going off on one. He’s a guy that Arto would like to have in his corner.
Steve smiles at that, rolling his head again the headboard to look at him. “You seem much more okay with this than you did at eleven o’clock last night.”
Arto runs. He runs all the way up to his room, pulling his phone out of his pocket. His hands are shaking as he finds Omari’s number and hits dial. He holds the phone to his ear, backing right up against the wall and feeling pretty much like his chest is caving in.
Arto is barely aware of how loud he snaps the word, not until Steve jerks his head up in shock. Arto shakes his head, hands balling into fists. “We are not going home, he nearly killed himself and you’re forgiving him and saying that we’re going home?!”
This time it's an obvious struggle for Steve. There’s no more of that instant very awake thing - instead, he groggily sits up against the headboard, rubbing the back of his head and looking tired and lost again. He glances across the bed and as he does his composure cracks slightly.
He breathes out slowly, walking forwards and resting his hands on the back of the chair that sits on the other side of his desk. “Well, it’s not Steve’s chair.”
Arto twists around in the seat so he’s leaning on his shoulder, cheek pressed to the soft faux-leather. He reaches out, pressing his fingers to Steve’s bicep. “At least you don’t do stupid dangerous stuff.”
“Tony was being an idiot about them and the news was being an idiot about it. They said Steve would be pissed about it.”
“He won’t,” Bucky says. “Realistically, worst case scenario is he bites another kid or hides under a table and refuses to come out.”
“Okay,” Tony says. “You want me to video call? Or I’ve got a suit here, I can get to Chicago in like two hours so we can do this face to face.”
“You have a child too,” Steve points out, somewhat resentfully. “You will have to deal with this at some point.”
There’s suddenly a painful lump in his throat, the double-whammy of Steve offering to read the books for him and mentioning Tony hitting him hard. He nods mutely, tries to think of what to say.
Steve, decidedly, does not. He ignores Natasha and leaves the room, heading up to talk to Arto. Natasha looks at Tony, wearily. “Can’t you at least try and stop him from interfering?”
leaving,” Steve says, jaw going tight again. “I am not. I am just taking a few days so I don’t say anything to Tony that I’ll regret, because I love him and even if he’s done something-” Steve breaks off, clearly struggling. “We’ve had a disagreement,” he says, looking down. “We both got angry. We yelled. And now I need some time to get over it, so we can move past it. I shouldn’t be - god, I shouldn’t be putting you in this position. But I feel like I owe you an explanation and I'm not about to lie to you and say it's work or some other bullshit." He stops talking again, rakes a hand through his hair. "If I stay here, I’ll make it worse.”
“Get him yourself,” Steve says half-heartedly, reaching out and snagging Arto’s ankle. “You’re gonna be late if you don’t pick a car.”
“Yeah one broke, so I had to get them fixed so Steve took me out to get them fixed,” Arto explains in a rush. “It peeled off after I had a bath so I thought about just taking them all off and didn’t want them any more but then I did.”
Arto would argue, but he kind of wishes that too. For once, he’s truly grateful for Steve’s dogged determination to fix everything for him; this is not something he wants to tackle on his own.
There’s more, Steve’s sure of it. He can tell by the way Arto is looking at him, and restlessly twisting his fingers together. Hell, he wonders if he should call Tony up out of the lab; if Arto is about to say something revelationary, Tony should be here for it too. “But…?”
Until he grinds to a halt in front of a painting of Saint George killing the Dragon, and it’s not even the dragon that he’s staring it. It’s the goddamn princess in the background, the one with the flowing pink cape that matches the colour of his nails, trimmed in some sort of fur. She’s wearing glittery jewels and a crown and he wants the jewellery and the cape and the dress, something long and flowing.
“No,” Tony says. “You are definitely Captain Overprotective, but Buckaroo here is in a league of his own.”
The competition is easy. Take a selfie of Arto holding an imaginary box of cereal, upload it onto Bucky’s Instagram. Tag it appropriately, and then hope.
He and Tony both get up, dragged out of the room in their sleepwear by Arto who is babbling about magic and Clint getting home early and Bucky making jokes and Natasha shouting at Clint who has turned into a girl.
- but it’s in a good way. Mostly good. Maybe ninety percent good ten percent bad. Maybe eighty-twenty.
Being out by himself is weird. He’s never really been alone at all, apart from those times when he was little and he was locked in the bedroom adjacent to the laboratory. That time of his life is all a little vague though, the memories pushed aside in favour of remembering his new life with Steve and Tony. It’s kind of scary, walking along the snowy streets and knowing that Bucky or Clint or Nat aren’t around. Unless Steve decides to attempt some sneaking, there’s no-one out here looking out for his safety, other than himself.
Next morning, Steve is awake before Arto. Arto knows this because Steve wakes him up by tugging on his ear in a pretty obvious case of petty revenge.
“Sure.” Steve doesn't look like he cares in the slightest, so Arto takes full advantage of that fact. The car pulls away, eerily silent as always. Bucky calls it the ninja car and absolutely adores it, even though Steve very rarely lets him - or anyone else - drive it.
’ he signals through the window. Fury nods, because if Rogers is talking to the WSC then they won’t be on his ass about the Avengers keeping them out of the loop again. Already onto plan B, Fury points at Barnes. Barnes looks surprised, shaking his head and cupping a metal hand around his ear.
The rest of the day doesn’t really go his way, in that he doesn’t get to find out what the conversation on the balcony was all about, and he doesn’t get another opening to talk about his stuff. He wants to, he desperately wants to tell Clint everything but every moment seems to be wrong or just not quite right. Ugh. He’s a Rogers, he should just be able to do it. His dad might as well be an advert for freaking Nike or something; whenever he decides he wants to do something there’s very little that can hold him back. Tony’s a big fan of pointing that out on a very regular basis.
His tone brings yet more hot tears to Arto’s eyes and a lump to his throat. He nods, tugging at Steve’s shirtsleeve for no other reason than just to remind Steve he’s there.
“I win!” he shouts, gripping Clint’s shirt in his fingers. “You’re not the king, not the king anymore!”
After an hour, Tony still hasn’t reappeared. Steve quite pointedly doesn't ask Jarvis for any updates, because Pepper and Stark Industries is Tony’s business, and even though earlier he’d wanted to go and defend Tony, he knows that Tony can handle himself, and should probably be left to do so. He’s never once wanted Steve involved with his work outside of the Avengers, and Steve has never been interested in it. He only knows that Tony plays a big part in R&D, still owns enough shares to technically own the company, and drives Pepper up the wall on a regular basis even though his actual contact with the company is limited now he’s a full time Avenger.
need to stop yelling at me,” Tony snaps, cutting right over him. Arto falls silent in shock; Tony never raises his voice at him, ever. Tony must feel a similar sense of shock because he just stares at Arto for a moment, lost.
It’s quiet. He can hear the soft hum of the heaters and Steve breathing. Steve’s bedside lamp is on, spilling gold over the carpet and beds, not strong enough to reach the darker corners of the room.
The reporter - if that was even acceptable phrasing for a scumbag paparazzi photographer that had literally hidden in a bush to try and get pictures - nodded, still holding a bloodied wad of tissue to his nose.  “Yes,” he said defiantly. “And I’ve called the police. Your kid assaulted me.”
Arto smiles and shuffles further into his spot, splaying his hand over the arc reactor. Steve heaves out a sigh behind him, and Tony reaches over to settle his hand on Steve’s thigh.
“Gross,” a voice protests, and Steve feels small hands shoving at his collarbone. “Steve, I’m hungry.”
When the door to his bedroom crashes open, Steve simply does what he normally does and rolls over, shoving his head under the pillow and hoping that Arto makes a beeline for Tony instead of him. He waits and sure enough, he hears footsteps stamping demandingly towards them, and then waits for the usual shout of ‘there are no more Lucky Charms,’ or ‘Bucky is being an asshole,’ or ‘can Omari come and play-?”
Arto shakes his head violently. He hasn’t had sessions with Julia in like eighteen months and he’s not about to go back to that. That’d be like undoing all his progress, like literally going backwards.
Bucky responds by squirting the water right into his face. Arto splutters and tries to shove him away, but Bucky is just grinning like an asshole.
Arto opens his mouth to argue but then realises that yeah, that’s probably exactly right. He looks down at his feet, wriggling his toes in his thinning Hulk socks. “I want you to stay,” he mumbles.
“Whoa,” Sam says in shock, leaning away from him and fixing him with an unimpressed stare. “Where’s the attitude coming from?”
Luckily for him, she doesn’t press him. She walks over to kiss Sam and then takes a seat beside Clint, leaning over to say hello to Anna. Anna has got cauliflower on her forehead and is tussling with Bucky over a spoon. Bucky is covered in more vegetables and is looking pained as he tries to take the spoon from her. Predictably, he gives up and lets her have it her way. “Fine, feed yourself,” he says with a roll of his eyes.
Bucky pauses. “He has, kinda,” he admits. “Wow, deja vu. Me and Steve had this conversation like a week ago. So if it’s any consolation, you’re handling it better than Steve?”
They give it a shot. Steve tells Arto that he will enter the competition like everyone else and have a chance of winning just like everyone else, and will accept it if he loses, just like everyone else.
“I don’t want to be a Young Avenger!” Arto yells and storms off without saying anything else. Clint and Tony look at each other for a moment, until they hear his footsteps fade.
Steve pauses, clearly a little confused. He looks at the painting and then decides not to comment or ask how Arto has gone from dragon slaying to questions about sexuality. “Well, there was a waiter in a coffee shop near the tower,” he says quietly. “Couldn’t stop staring at him. And then Tony. When we first met we fought like cat and dog. Honestly, it was like you and Bucky used to be.”
“Yeah,” Steve says with a faint smile, leaning over to drop a kiss onto Arto’s blanket covered head. “Pizza it is.”
“Never,” Steve says, but he does let go, ruffling Arto’s hair as he goes. “Now. Who wants anything else to eat?”
He wakes up the next morning feeling groggy and unsettled after a night of broken sleep, brief catnaps punctuated by strange dreams about a weird white room, the ground trembling beneath his hands and the smell of smoke on the air. He ignores it and drags himself through the shower before heading to find breakfast. Just like Clint said, the tree and decorations are gone, and it reminds him that the holidays are nearly over; four more days and he’s back at school. The very thought makes him feel sick because on Thursday he’s supposed to be back at Midtown and that means facing up to Peter who now hates him.
“They’re from the women's section,” Arto says. He flips one over to show Steve the pink soles, before turning them back around so he can show him the glittery silver, white and baby pink of the sides. “They’re women’s shoes.”
“So did you ask him who it was?” Steve asks that night as they’re getting ready for bed, side by side in their bathroom and brushing their teeth, elbows knocking.
“That’s,” Steve manages to say, clearing his throat. “That’s the best thing anyone’s ever said to me.”
He’s barely been off the phone for a minute when it rings back at him. He thinks it’ll be Julia calling back to tell him that he is in fact crazy but it turns out to be Peter, which is exactly what his poor shredded nerves need right now.
“I’m an orphan from Brooklyn,” Steve says, leaning against the doorframe. “Never thought I’d be living upstate in a mansion.”
“I dunno,” Clint chips in, kneeling down to scoop up the offending marshmallows. He pops one into his mouth. “He’s pretty unhealthily attached to Lucky Charms.”
“Stop saying chill, you’re too old to pretend to be cool,” Arto says, and Tony chokes a laugh into his coffee before setting it down and looking up expectantly across the table.
Arto looks at Steve questioningly and Steve nods; Arto pats at Clint’s shoulder and he obligingly sticks an arm out so Arto can carefully massage down it, from shoulder to wrist and back again.
Bucky pointedly gives them the finger, but then sighs and loops an arm around Arto, pulling him up onto his knee more securely.
Now Arto knows full well that Tony goes to bed in the spare room, but the next morning when Arto knocks and walks in, the bed is empty. He narrows his eyes as his brain starts putting two and two together, backtracking out of the room and down the corridor to Steve’s. Yep, there he is, sleeping next to Steve with his arms and limbs sprawled out like a starfish. Steve's on his side, mouth hanging open and one hand resting inbetween Tony's shoulder-blades. Arto stares for a moment and then decides that yeah, he’s cool with it.
And the anger is swelling, growing stronger, nastier. Violence itches right under his skin. “That’s it? Just okay?”
“The joys of electronic versions, ready to distract at every moment,” Tony says, picking up the circuit board and holding it up to the light, examining it critically. “Now that should do it.”
Bucky frowns, stilling the bag. “Yeah, I know,” he says. “Doc reckons it's some new separation anxiety or some shit. She’ll get over it.”
“Oh my god you’re back and I missed you and I’m so sorry I’m never going to not talk to you again, this has been the worst-”
“You asked the one question that was guaranteed to knock me on my ass,” Steve says gently. “But I shouldn’t have reacted like such a dick. So I’m sorry.”
Arto pulls back, not because he really wants to let Steve go but more because he wants to start reading. As he does he spots another bag by Steve’s feet. “More books?”
Ten minutes later and the car is hooked up to the charging point and Steve is unloading their bags. Arto gets out of the car to see a garage attendant staring at them both in awe. Steve has a quick word and the man is nodding vigorously, even going to far as to pop a salute as Steve turns away.
Arto looks over at Bucky and Clint who both shrug in tandem. Damn. Never mind him being the awkward and uncommunicative one, it’s his freaking parents that people should really be looking out for.
Tony appears like a jack-in-the-box, standing up so he’s visible over the swathe of holograms and medical screens he’s got set up. He looks seriously angry and that doesn’t abate as he spots Arto. “Cut it out!” he mouths, making a slashing motion across his throat.
Doubt starts to creep in the moment he hangs up the phone. He’d told Peter that he’d be back soon, but he doesn’t know if that’s true or not. The more he thinks about it, the more he misses home. But then the moment he thinks “well fuck it, I’ll tell Steve we can go back,” it makes him feel just
“And with every bit of negative comes a positive,” Steve continues. “Yeah you used to fight us, but on the flipside you show us so much love. Yeah you get angry but you also have such passion for things. You’re super strong but you’re so gentle with Anna. And this whole gender thing? Like I said, you used to spend a hell of a lot of time dressed up as Cinderella. We had to wrestle that dress from you to put it in the laundry, I swear.”
“Stay awake, I'll be back,” he says hurriedly to Steve, scrambling back out of the room. And when he returns, holding out a mug of coffee like a peace offering, Steve smiles weakly.
There’s a moment of quiet, and then from within the apartment, Arto hears Steve yelling. Bucky hands over Anna to him without a word and marches in the direction of the shouting. It gets momentarily louder and then goes quiet.
The elevator spills them back out into the warmth of the apartment. Clint is at the stove heating something up and Anna is drawing on the wall and Steve is there letting her, oh
Finally, Bucky speaks. “You have a lot of shit going on right now,” he says. Arto just nods mutely, feeling strangely grateful for the fact Bucky isn't trying to analyse it or joke about it. He's just… agreeing.
; Arto feels it right in his very core. He looks around at the salon, at the smiling and relaxed women, feeling the hook pull tighter. Could he? But - he’s never been embarrassed about wearing nail varnish, it’s just a habit he’s had since he was like seven, and no-one at school dares say anything to him about it because a) his dads are Captain America and Iron Man and b) Arto could knock them the fuck out himself if he were so inclined. He wouldn’t, because Steve would hate it if he did and probably never talk to him ever again, but Arto and the bullies know he could, and that’s enough for now.
Peter is calling him. Over two weeks of radio silence and ignoring calls and texts and now he’s calling? Arto stares at the name and the picture of Peter and feels something horrid and violent uncurl inside of him. His grip is so tight on the phone that the case is bending.
Arto Rogers doesn’t say a word as Nick wanders in and shuts the door. He’s lounging back in Nick’s chair, so small his purple-sneakered feet don’t touch the floor. He’s bobbing them up and down, laces dangling down and swaying back and forth.
“I thought my brain was broken,” Arto says, slotting the coins back into the piggy bank as Clint takes alternating sips from his mugs of coffee. He doesn’t say anything though, just waits and blinks sleepily. Arto picks up another plastic coin. “It’s not. When Natasha took me to get my nails done it make me feel all weird. And then Bucky bought Anna that headband and I wanted one and it was even weirder and I didn’t know what was happening.”
When Steve gets back, he doesn’t even bother going to debrief. He marches straight into the tower, still suited up, and beelines straight across the workshop towards Tony.
Tony just shakes his head again. He looks super tired. Arto reaches out to run his finger over the dark shadows under Tony’s eyes, then scritches his newly pinked nails through Tony’s goatee, tugging at the grey.
“Well I am,” Arto says, and he looks at his phone and flips to Tony’s number. “I want to talk to him.”
