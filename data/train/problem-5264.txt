Castiel was suspicious, even though Anna was the older sister, he was still protective over her, “Where are you going?” he asked even though he was still watching Dean.
Chuck double checked, the smile falling from his face. “Are you alright Angel? Are you in trouble?”
But you also love her; you love her quick wit, her intelligence.  She is unlike any other woman.  You gamble, you play music and you enjoy all the courts vices.  You dance with women praising their pretty eyes while Dean watches jealously from the side.   You cannot show him any attention so you continue dancing ignoring his warm gaze.
“Not doing what?” Castiel asked nervously as he felt Dean’s warm seep through his clothes and into Castiel’s palm.
“We need to find somewhere safe for that and yes it is what you think it is.” Castiel smiles softly, brushing his hand down Dean’s cheek, which is framed into a shocked expression, “I couldn’t leave you.”
He wants you to go with him and his brother when you dock in Jamestown.  But you have no money, how would you survive?  You won’t be a burden to them when they are starting out.  He argues that he does not care but you do.   If you abandon the daughter of the man who has promised you a life for Dean there would be an outcry and suspicions would arise.
Mainly because Castiel wanted to think the best of everyone, he did, maybe a bit naive but he wanted to believe that everyone could make a difference, even the smallest person.  Civil rights, Kennedy, human rights in Asia, all were prominent in his mind and he could not wait to help to make a small difference in a way.  He dreamed of a utopia, where everyone was counted equal and he was going to work his way to that world.  Despite the fact he was the son of a well-established doctor with plenty of money, he knew those less fortunate than him would look at him and think he was stupid, ignorant perhaps.
He feels his heart in his mouth as he opens the window.
In reality, it isn't hard to act mournful over the dead body of Jimmy Novak, because to Dean though it is not Cas, it's still a small part of him that is lying on the ground. The demons laughed at the brothers and taunted them over the dead angel, it seemed that Dean and Sam had sold it, because the demons had bought it.
But you soon learn that holy war is not what you expected, when you cross the sea, the heat hits you and you realise that this is truly a holy war as you think you have stepped into hell.  The sweat rolls down your back and the armour and chainmail that you wear feels so heavy and hot.  You wonder about the zeal that you left Italy with whether it is still there.
But while Cas (it was Dean who christened him that the second day they met and it’s stuck) feels his throat get dry as his eyes stare at the small breasts in those vest tops and the womanly curves that Ellen, Jo and Bela are developing he is also fighting a very big problem deep down.
Castiel looked to Sam for an explanation. “I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.  They do their act at Devil’s Gate on Thursday. If they cancel they lose this season’s salary and next year’s gig and will have one very pissed off owner.”
Dean didn’t stay around to listen. He walked on and Castiel felt like a bastard, but Dean had this cool dark persona about him. Of course he would think that Dean was the father, if not then who was?   He was disappointed in himself. He had jumped to conclusions and what made Castiel sick was that he had seen disappointment in Dean’s eyes.  Just when Castiel had thought that Dean did not even notice him, now he had and it wasn’t pretty.
He looks at you with grateful eyes that become fonder and fonder as the time goes by.  But still you have not actually spoken to each other.  You knew each other as children and were once friends but now you are practically strangers.
“I know,” the boy replied, “you got a good chip, you play football?”
The giant has a broken nose and a graze on his forehead while the elder brother has another black eye and a cut on his cheek.  The pair looks carefree and still defiant; Crowley has killed previous slaves for trying to escape.  But they were never like these brothers.  These brothers are fighters and they have the ability to be great gladiators.
Castiel scowled slightly, then picked up his present for Sam, “This is for you Sam,” he proudly gave a fabric covered book, Sam pulled the book from the muslin and saw an old book, “It is the first edition of some very rare exorcisms and spells, I thought you might like it when I saw it in Jerusalem a long time ago.”
Castiel felt even worse when he watched Dean but felt a tug on his gut that was admiration as he watched Dean look after Jo.  He had carried her ever so gently from the kitchens, soothing her with his voice softly, telling her it was going to be okay and that he wasn’t going to let anything happen to her.  It was a different side to the cocky man in dark sunglasses who danced raunchily at night with men and women alike.
And then again the moment was gone, the hunter’s gazed tightened back, the emotion pushed away and Castiel felt his heart seize.
His voice is silken with false kindness but you dare not offend your best customer.  He is has been buying your produce for months when he makes his first offer.  He offers you more money if you would go to bed with him.  You are outraged and bite angrily that you are a married woman and would never go to bed with him.
He loves his new uniform, he feels like a big kid as he gets to wear a blazer over his bottle green jumper and grey trousers, he is still wearing them as he rides his bike around the neighbourhood, despite the warning from his mother not to get them marked.   Balthazar can’t come out tonight and Gabriel is out with his friends so Castiel meanders around the area, riding from his nice cull de sac to the neighbourhood where Inias lives, which is near the rougher areas of the small settlement where they live but Castiel doesn’t care even if his parents would kill him if they knew he was this far out of his boundary.
The war rolls on and you live for Dean’s letters though now they are more sporadic and you can tell in every line that his heart is heavy.  You work hard every day and manage to just make enough money to keep you and Sam alive.  But it becomes harder; winter is always hard but it is now even more so when food is so sparse and when available so expensive.  Your father who could help you is now sick and you visit him every day but fluid gets on his lungs and he fades away as a feather does in the wind.
“I know,” Castiel sighed, “So end it then”
He stands, turns away angrily, “Am I so damned?  Are you always going to be so damned absent?  I need guidance father!”
If he had any suspicions he was being thrust upon Hester, they were fully fledged theories by the time they were on the dance floor after dinner, Castiel feeling tense as he really wasn’t the best dancer in the world, Hester with an expectant smile on her face, “Are you going to major in English?” she asked.
The next day you feel well enough to take him some a drink, he is still working on the fields that were overwrought with weeds in his absence.   It is late autumn now but he has worked himself into a sweat and has discarded his jacket to wear only his shirt.  Even heavily pregnant you find he stirs you and you watch his muscles which had built back up working hard in his back.  He looks to you and smiles at your offering of a drink and you watch with lazy eyes as his throat moves as he swallows the water.  He looks to you with surprised eyes and you look away chastising yourself because he looks at you like a whore.   You make your excuses to go back to the house, mentioning that you should let him get back to his work and turn to go before his hand grabs your wrist.
Castiel shook his head, she was being polite, polite conversation he could do that and hope to god he didn’t stamp on her poor feet, “No, Economics of underdeveloped countries, I am going into the Peace Corps.”
Before you can reply he is off his knees and yelling for the guards, you know then that you will never be in his presence again.  That it is over.  You bite back any tears and look into those beautiful green eyes one last time before bowing lowly.  You stare at the marble floor as you hear Pharaoh walk away his soft feet upon the cold surface, you swear your heart breaks at that moment.
Nothing could reprieve him for taking the souls for Purgatory, he deserved penance and punishment over and over again for betraying Dean, for breaking Sam’s wall, Dean might forgive but he would never forget.
The heat in your whole body threatens to tear your apart but you don’t care as long as Dean kisses you, touches you.  You collapse onto the truckle bed and into a fit of giggles at what you are trying to achieve in such a small space.  But it feels right.  You may have only done this a couple of times and even after the beatings of your father you could never deny that this was not right.
People are fearful and neighbours look upon each other wondering if they become ill.  You fear for your girl and keep her indoors.  You won’t let her play with other children; you keep her close which grates on her.  She tries to argue but a firm glare from your eyes from your blue eyes puts her in her place.
And in return Dean says his in a whisper.
"It's not blind faith Dean," Castiel said passionately, "its
Without Crowley, it gets even harder, you find that you skip meals and give the lion share to Samuel.  You would do anything to make sure that Samuel survives for he is the bit of Dean that remains with you.  Your little boy breaks your heart; Dean has not seen him grow into the beautiful child with sandy long hair and freckles.
Cas heart freezes and he looks to Anna, “its Dean,” she confirms, I saw Ash visiting him on Ward 24 earlier today.  Cas looks back to the article and sees that it describes the victim being seriously injured, Dean is seriously injured.
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
Emotions were a new concept to Castiel, angels were not meant to feel, yet ever since he had turned his back on heaven and his brethren, all he had done was feel emotion, but it was still new to him.  He was thousands of years old but he had never truly felt like had truly lived until the moment he rebelled.  The moment he realised that Dean Winchester meant more than orders, but now Castiel was at another crossroads, was Dean Winchester more to him than God, his father?  Previous behaviour and actions suggested that Dean was Castiel’s everything.
Dean rolled his eyes, "It's Christmas man, it's a nativity and that's the international costume for a shepherd in a nativity."
But now isn’t the time for smirking, you are standing opposite each other in the middle of the street, rain threatening in the wind, the sky is angry and so are you, but now is not the time for smirking, shit has just got real, in a couple seconds your lives are going to implode…
The journey to Tower Hill is a short one but you never let go of his hand.  You can feel his heart rapidly beat under his palm and you ignore the jeers of the crowds that surround the scaffold.  The people yell at you, call you a traitor and your gaze falters over them and the scaffold.  Fear pierces your heart and your falter but you feel Dean squeeze your hand and the moment of fear is over.
Castiel isn’t especially thinking of Dean Winchester when he goes out to put his rubbish in his bin, he is thinking of how dark the sky looks, the wind is going to blow in some rain he reckons as he throws the bin liner in the wheelie bin.
Castiel, who had been staring at the floor in sheer panic, suddenly looked up at Dean heat flaring in his eyes and gut.  Nobody told him that he couldn’t do anything, not even a stuck up hot shot called Dean Winchester.  So what if he was cute. Castiel was starting to learn he was a bit arrogant. Who was he to say Castiel couldn’t do it? They wouldn’t know if they didn’t try and Jo needed this. They had come so far and they had to go on now.  They couldn’t give up.
You never thought it could be like this, you are a whore.  You know the tricks to making a man feel good but this is something new.  Normally any release for you (if any) is sometimes after being fucked into submission to the point that you cannot take any more.
Shocked Dean felt his eyes close automatically as he kissed back,
After an awkward silence Sam piped up, “It’s not a bad idea.”
Dean bumbled, “But he can’t even do the merengue, he can’t do it, he cannot do it!”
Admit impediments. Love is not love
“Alastair, Angel wants to remains of his leftover pot roast to South East Asia,” Chuck Novak drawled sarcastically, “So anything you don’t finish, wrap up.”
Your late mother would have despaired you think.  She loved Dean and encouraged you to play together as children.  You helped each other through school and while you are were quiet he was boisterous and loud.   But you can tell by the way that he bites his jaw down he is nervous, you could always read him so well.  He is always special in your memory for he was the boy who made you realise that you desired men.  Though you never acted upon it.
She is happier in the spring and you watch her sew just as her mother did, sitting in front of the cottage in the sunshine.  You are planting seeds and you wave to her when a man travelling through the village stops and tells you of the news.  The dark storm cloud that is sweeping through Europe, he tells you of a sickness that is going through the towns and cities, through countries.
“Moe coming up on Friday?” Zachariah asked loudly.
Castiel fumbles with the jean's buttons but straddles Dean, gently leaning down he places kisses on his neck, moving slowly down Dean's chest and Dean has to close his eyes as he feels his body burn, under the angel's tongue. Castiel sucks at his navel and Dean moans, his hips bucking up as he knows he is hard under those blue jeans. Dean pulls at Castiel's trousers, knowing now he is just desperate to feel his Castiel's skin against his.
“Why did you let go Cas?” Dean asked angrily at Cas who had stood beside the Impala, letting his fingers drift over the cool metal of the bonnet, as if it would ground him.
You have been owned by Crowley for over ten years and while you sleep with him, his main concern is making money from his Gladiators and so he keeps them happy.  He wryly notes that if he were living on such a knife edge of death all the time he would want a good fuck too before he died in the arena.
It has been nearly three years that have you seen Dean when Crowley enters your life.  He is a man that you have only known in passing as he has bought your crops.  What little you have to sell he buys at the top price.  But you have never liked him, he watches you with greedy eyes.  His hands linger upon yours when he pays you.
A rather shabby Christmas tree was put up with some cut price decorations and lights, but they were proud of it and since they had  more than 24 hours to prepare there were actual Christmas presents under the tree that had not come from a gas station.  Four presents in total, one for Dean, one for Sam and two for Castiel.  Even if they were not entirely sure whether the angel was coming.
They are each other’s mirror.
You blink, how are these Saracens savages when they speak your tongue?  The green eyed Saracen asks you to surrender; telling you that there would be no honour in killing a half dead Christian.  You nod because you don’t think you could talk if you tried.
Castiel opened his present to find comically a Christmas tie and also a leather bounded diary, “I figured you would want to write down some of your experiences, or whatever you might be thinking, if you can’t speak to either of us but want to..you know..get it out…” Sam shrugged meeting Castiel’s eyes, who was shocked by the thoughtfulness of the gifts, “Thank you Sam,” he said nodding, taking the normal blue tie off, he started to put the Christmas tie on and paused looking puzzled then with a flutter of his hand the tie was perfectly tied.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
Dean nodded, he wanted to keep that hope in his friend's eyes, the angel had come to him for help and he was glad but then he remembered something and coughed, " I have a couple rules though," Dean said carefully, "One, we both have control, we won't fool anybody if I start sprouting crap that only you would say. And two if you keep out the personal stuff in my head."
It seemed that weight of the world that had been on Jo’s shoulders, threatened to drown her with it. she was shaking and sobbing her heart out and Castiel felt for her. He couldn’t let Hester know she was here, she had to get help.
The last night that you know you will spend with your daughter you watch her sleep.  You fear what will happen to her once you are gone but know that is now out of your control.  But you want to give her best shot.
Show me how to fight for now
Men who are like you, homosexual are also in these camps and it is these men that you watch with a broken heart but also with fear.  You see how they are treated in the camp, they are beaten and treated cruelly not only by the Germans but by fellow inmates.  They are used as slave labour, making boots for the German Army and have to test them out on ragged sharp pavements over and over again.  You hear horror stories of men being castrated and you see them die and you feel ashamed because you hide everything and stand by and watch people suffer because you are a coward.
In the evening you discover the first lump and you feel your blood run cold, icy cold.   It feels the size of a pea at your groin but you know that the illness that has spread through the country has reached your home.
You are not fucking.  You are making love.  With this realisation you are lost and you make love for the rest of the night.  Your voice is nearly hoarse from the moans and cries but Dean turns to you and gently kisses you.  You don’t expect him to tell you that he loves you.  You don’t need him to, he has told you in the way he kisses you, the way he moves inside you.  He has shown you that he loves you.
Castiel flushed with guilt. “But I thought...”
Castiel text Dean back saying he was too busy to meet up as he had family stuff to do.
He challenged him, Castiel knew he could never end it even if the sensible part of him knew his heart would be better protected if he did end it.  His hearts screamed for him to stop challenging Dean, but part of him knew Dean wouldn’t end it even if for the lust then for the brief moment of love that had gazed at the angel.  When Castiel had broken him apart.
It is nothing like when it is with Dean and you are glad, you shut yourself off as Crowley moves inside you, grunting and kissing you sloppily.  Afterwards he kisses you softly and leaves more money for the next four weeks deliveries.  When he is gone you sob with shame.
"Says who? You?" Dean retorted.
Dean walks back to his barracks with a black eye and a bleeding lip.   You go back with a crack in your resolve.
In the evening you argue tears in your eyes, he tells you that you have to be together, whatever the cost.  Is it worth your life?  Yes, but his?  No you cannot and will not risk his life and you tell him this angrily.
Alistair was as a good as his word, he got the family whatever they wanted and Castiel smiled as his mother looked forlornly at the amount of leftover food on the table, “Look at all this leftover food, are they still starving children in Europe?” his mother asked.
That itch is being satisfied, he needs to feel the burning fire, he needs to quench his thirst and he needs to hear his name on the angel's lips like a prayer, which Castiel says reverently over and over again.
That got the angel's attention his blue eyes meeting the earnest green eyes of the hunter who continued, "I mean look, we celebrate his birth thousands of years after the event and if that is not faith what is? Faith that the people I save are worth saving because somewhere out there, who knows there could be someone just as special as the baby in that crib over there."
But you both know deep down, you realise that it will never be.  You both couldn’t wait to leave England but now you don’t want to reach Virginia.  You wish you could just stay adrift at sea in an endless voyage, constantly together.
The priests told you that the infidels were messengers from Satan, riding on black horses from hell, full of hate, blood thirst and cruel.  But you see that there are also Saracen dead amongst your own.  This has been a typical battle of these crusades, just that you were on the losing side.   You look back to the Saracen on the white horse who is dismounting.  He wears beautiful blue silks and gloriously detailed armour.  He is beautiful you see as he walks towards you, long dark hair that is swept back with oils and sweat.  A beard that speckles his chin and his skin is a glorious tanned brown.
You have to have him, you think as you stare into those beautiful green eyes which are almost black with lust.  You kiss him and rock into his hips gently and you feel him seize against you and groan against your lips.  He paints your stomachs sticky and you grin moving your way back down his body trailing your fingers through his come.
But it changes because Dean goes on training and Cas expects the texts to stop, but expects them to start when Dean is back in the country.  Except they don’t.  Castiel tries not to feel hurt but he is but man’s up, realises that it is just the same as it was when he was 19 years old, that Dean just wanted Cas, not wanted to be with Cas.
Castiel tried to argue but Dean wasn’t having any of it, so a rather bemused Balthazar and Castiel joined their party and actually got on as if high school wasn’t two years ago but more like twenty.  Castiel and Dean talked about everything the fact that Dean had just got back from Iraq and Castiel couldn’t help but admire the fire in Dean’s eyes when he spoke about his work, Castiel was not sure he could be that brave.
Yes it was just sex, Dean said it was just sex, so it would just be sex.
Castiel thought of all the tips that Alastair had got from his family from their evening meals. He looked to Dean and Jo. “But if it’s Alastair, there’s no problem, I know he has the money. I’m sure if you tell him.”
“So I wasn’t being presumptious,” Cas breathed against Dean’s lips.
You are his and he is yours, he has known you since childhood and now he has married you.  Wife the name feels foreign on your tongue and now you cannot keep from saying I am his wife, he is my husband.
Thank you all for all the kudos and your comments and special thanks to my new beta read moosetacular from tumblr, massive huge thanks for helping me with my love affair with commas.
You are numb to sleeping with the gladiators; it is who you are now so you forget the little girl and accept with opened legs that you are a slut.  You have a bawdy sense of humour and sometimes have the gladiators fighting over who get you first.  Being a whore is your life and you are good at it, if you were not any good you would have no roof upon your head.
Castiel bit back the gasp but his eyes never left Deans as the pair swayed in time with Otis Redding.  Castiel felt like time had slowed down and yet the beat of the song was so fast.  The music flooded his veins and all that mattered right now was the way he was moving with Dean Winchester, he could feel the sweat running down Dean’s neck, the heat in his hip and on the palm spread out on Castiel’s back.
The pain is nothing like you have ever experience.  You see Naomi’s face transform into anger as she realises what you are doing.  You hear Dean screaming your name and know that Sam is holding him back.  Naomi orders you to stop what you are doing and tries to stop you but your force the energy of your grace into her path.   The purity of Grace is not supposed to be used as a weapon but it has the desired effect and burns Naomi out of her vessel and the last thing you hear before you pass out is her screams along with your own as you feel your wings burn away.
Love.  It makes you gasp and you are stunned, your eyes wide.  Pharaoh gently kisses you again and tells you to be happy.  Your role as Royal Architect may be over but you will want for nothing for as long as you and your daughter live, he tells you.
Castiel took a deep breath. This was the crucial point. He couldn’t tell him and he had never kept anything from his father. He had never lied really to his parents. It went against the grain. “I can’t tell you, it’s hard for me to say that to you but I can’t.”
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You hate how he blames himself that he is not there when your pains start one hot summer’s morning, you battle the first few hours by yourself.  When he finds you screaming and splayed out on your bedroom floor, it is high afternoon.  You are soaked in sweat and have vomited twice, he stares at you pale and blinking until you yell at him for to get help.
But without the threat of angels and demons, it does mean they can take one vacation.  Sam is hysterical over the history “Vikings Dean, The Lindsifarne Gospels Dean!” Dean isn’t that fussed but funnily enough he likes the peace and quiet and he does feel at peace here.
The play fights where Dean pins Castiel to the ground and lingers over Castiel just that little bit too long, the fact that Dean caught Castiel staring at his lips and didn’t freak out much instead just shrugged it off, going the tackle one of the lads in the group to the ground.  Fighting over the football that is just them both grabbing the ball and staring each other down.
You are the same.  You tell him that he is also a whore, just while you fuck men, he offers himself up to the mob of Rome, and he fucks the empire.  And they love him for it.
While they are chaining you to the pole you look to him and thank him.  He has stripped away all the façade and fear.  It is almost like you are not here in a camp, but back when you were young and staring at each other in the golden fields of your home town.  You remember you would spend hours just lying staring at each other.  You were in love even then.
Ten years later, Pharaoh dies, at a relatively young age, there is massive mourning and his brother inherits the throne and the royal architect follows the dead pharaoh into the tomb.
"Crowley is after me. He wants me dead, I have a bounty upon my head and he keeps sending demons after me. At first I thought I could fight them off, that was two months ago," he explained, the brothers looked at each other then back to the angel, "It seems the King of Hell is quite determined."
Dean looked to Sam, then back to the angel and stood up, opening his arms, "We are going to do this together Cas," he said firmly, "Together."
Dean tried to ignore the leap of joy he felt in his gut, “Hey Cas, took your time!” he smiled throwing the shopping on the table, “Didn’t think you would make it,”
Castiel smiles softly and makes his way to Dean and kneels before him, it makes Dean start and sit up as the hunter is unnerved by the angels smile, “Cas,” he says hoarsely, “I don’t want you to go so don’t be coming in here smiling and expect me to say it’s fine.”
You parry attacks, cutting and slashing, killing men and you feel no righteousness or holy fervour.  All you feel is sick and fearful, panicking as another attacker comes to you and your horse panics and rears up.  The heavy weight of your armour drags you down and everything black as you hit the ground.
You bury your father on a cold New Year’s Day; you cry bitter tears and wish that Dean was there to hold you.  Burying your father brings back all your memories of your youth and when Dean had been courting you, those days seemed so full of love and warm compared to now.  You are chilled to the bone when you trudge back to your little farm and you sit with Samuel in your arms beside the fire whispering Dean’s name over and over again as it would bring him home.
You feel that the beliefs that you fought for have been betrayed.  So now you watch England disappear, you are going to the New World.  Where anything is possible, an old family friend has offered you a life there and you seize you chance.
You place a hand upon your belly and tell him that the child is growing in your womb and you cannot do anything about it.  You cannot stop life or fate.  That although the child’s parents are sinners, it is innocent and you will do everything to protect it just as you have with Samuel.  You watch him stand tall, his fists curled into tight balls.   His gaze is cold as he spits out one word.  Whore.
He is a handsome man, rugged in his looks dark blonde hair that curls at his neck, with a wispy beard and beautiful green eyes.  Green eyes that follow you whenever you are near and you know that you are besotted with him.  People smile and say that you are in the glows of being newlyweds but you hope that this feeling will carry on till you are in your old age.
Castiel is now friends with Dean, Gordon, Ash, Garth, Benny, Jo, Ellen and Bela.
Crowley visits you every Thursday like he promised; Samuel plays outside as you take Crowley to bed.  Sometimes he is gentle but sometimes he moves hard and fast, collapsing on you with foul breath that stinks of drink.  When he leaves you sob with shame and beg forgiveness from God.  You think of Dean and cry even more, how can you be ever be proud of the title wife again?
Cas meets his sister Anna who works as a secretary for lunch and she is holding the local paper and looks nervous, “What is it?”
They spend most of their time playing football on an untended green near their middle school, drinking diet coke and sunny d, the girls singing Barbie girl repeatedly, dancing or sometimes joining into playing football.
Did you know how much I dreamt of you? Of us together living in a dream world where we won, we had a home and let you have a damn dog or cat if you wanted one. Nights (and mornings) kissing and touching you. Sex but more than sex, making love. Dammit I wanted you to make love to me. I wanted to feel you everywhere, I wanted to feel your kisses on my skin. Catch your gasping breaths in my mouth, tasting every part of you.
The first thing you learn about mortality is that injuries takes longer to recover from and you feel tired.  You whole body aches and your throat burns with thirst as you open your eyes.  You are not sure where you are it is not a motel room but a comfy bed and Dean is asleep in a chair beside you.  He looks so peaceful and you feel your heart swell with affection now feeling even deeper as a human than it did an angel.
“He’s away a lot, I know,” Zachariah said sourly, “It’s a hardship.”
And it wasn’t just men and women that were dancing, men were dancing with men and women were dancing with women.  Castiel was open minded. He had to admit he had put the question of his own sexuality into the back of his mind to the end of the summer but he didn’t realise how innocent and naïve he was till this moment, with his cheeks blushing a beetroot red and his jaw just about to hit the floor.
“He can move.” Sam shrugged and Castiel was starting to feel very uncomfortable.
Zachariah had appeared at the table as Alistair gave a little laugh, “Zach our angel’s gonna change the world,” Chuck said proudly and Castiel could not help but beam at the pride in his father’s voice.
He wasn’t going to say it, he couldn’t, he may have come to terms with it deep down with him, he couldn’t say it out loud, not yet.  Dean swallowed, feeling his voice raw and watching his breath evaporate, there was still nothing around him, no swoosh of angel wings, nothing, “Figures,” Dean sighed and got back into his car.
When you awake you are in bed and confused momentarily.  Then you remember being sick and the fear in your heart and Samuel’s scared face.  You see that Sarah the older woman from the farm nearby you is by your bedside; she gently lifts your head and encourages you to drink some water.  You ask where Samuel is and she tells you he is in the kitchen quite safe.  Samuel had run all the way to the next farm screaming and crying that his Marmie had died.  Sarah’s husband had ridden them all over here as quick as they could to find you on the floor passed out.
Dean stands, looking for his t-shirt, "This is just meant to be sex, Cas," he points out, not trying to hurt Cas, more to persuade himself.
"You can't," Cas growls, close to Dean's ear "You won't"
….or might just finally start.
You travel for days and each night he comes to you with water and a damp cloth, sometimes some food.  You talk about certain things about each other, your Gods, your preachers.  You never ask what will happen to you because you know when you reach your destination you are probably a dead man.  They will question you and find that you have no information and kill you.   But for now you cling on to the evenings when you get to talk to him.
His hair would be dark if not shaven, his skin like the shell of a polished wood, but his eyes so unusual for a Pharaoh are as green as the Nile in spring.   It is these eyes that you are mesmerised by, you have seen them wrinkle when he smiles and laughs, you have seen them puzzled and you have also seen them in anger.
Sam coughed awkwardly, "You know I am going to ahead and warm up the car, you know get it de-iced" he backed away slowly not sure whether Dean or Castiel who were stubbornly glaring at each other, noticed the younger hunter walk away.
The Demon attacks had increased after the weeks since Crowley had discovered that Castiel was alive. While he might have fled from that factory, on that day it was getting away with the tablet that had mattered; now the angel's death was what mattered to him. And he had plenty of minions that he could send after the angel and if the first didn't succeed then they could try try try again. That thought pleased Crowley immensely.
Dean is awake, staring at the ceiling, listening to his brother's breathing, waiting for him to go to sleep. But Sam is taking his time going into his slumber and Dean bites back the frustration that makes his heart pound in his chest. There is a warm ember that is in his gut, an itch he needs to scratch, his thirst needs to be quenched and waiting for Sam to go to sleep is driving him crazy.
“Jesus Christ Sam! What were you thinking?” Jo exclaimed, “He’s gonna tell his management girlfriend and then we’ll all get fired!” Sam inwardly shrank in his chair and Castiel felt that was an achievement considering how big Sam was. “Why not skywrite it?  Jo got knocked up by Alastair the creep.”
Castiel had to get help for Jo…..
He watched Alastair approach his sister with narrowed eyes. There was something about him that set nerves on edge and judging from Jo who was running the wig event, she didn’t like him much either. “Ask not what your waiter can do for you, but what you can do for your waiter,” Alastair purred at Anna who was wearing a Jackie Kennedy wig. “If tips keep up, I’ll have enough for my Alfa Romeo,” he bragged and Castiel rolled his eyes.
I couldn't get any bigger
That we're making two reflections into one
You reply not long enough which rewards you with a punch in the stomach, because you are tied to the chair you cannot protect yourself and you retch and wheeze, winded.  The officer stands and sighs, telling you that it is a shame because you will die and so will your precious Dean.
Only when they were in the next state did Castiel leave Dean and return to Jimmy's body, the angel and hunter looked at each other awkwardly and barely said anything to each other, their faces blushed when they stared into each other's eyes.
He looks at you stunned how on earth could he be worth the love of an angel he asks.  You tell him that he is worth all that and more.  That you are sorry that you ignored him so many times when he said that he needed you.  But now you are here, you are never going to leave him.  Now it runs both ways, you need him also.
"Weakened," Castiel replied, "I have been fighting for two month's solid, the last fight, it was very close and Crowley won't stop till he sees my dead body."
Castiel would show him love, he would show Dean how much he loved him, how much he was in love with Dean, he would suck his cock and preparing him with ever gentle fingers, pleasuring him so he gasped and writhed.  He would worship him and love him and as he entered him he realised this wasn’t fucking, this was making love.  With every thrust he was saying I worship you, I adore you, I love you.
He looks at you concerned, he has never entered you but the look in your desperate eyes makes him nod.  He kisses you gently and trails his lips down your body.  If you thought you could never feel more connected to Dean than when you are in him, you are proven wrong.
You do not sleep; there is no point in sleeping when you are going to your eternal rest in the morning.  You try to pray but all you thoughts are on Dean and your memories together.  You remember him as a child; you remember when his sister came back from France.  The endless chase that started between her and the King and the endless rewards that came to being part of the new circle.
“Protecting me, by letting me go?” Dean snarled stepping towards the angel, but stopped himself, then looked at the ground, gritting his teeth and clenching his fists.
“It’s a delight to meet you,” Zachariah said silkily, “If it were not for your father, I would be standing here dead,” he turned his attention to a tall young lad beside him, “Sam get the bags don’t just stand there!”
"Dude she was married, you can't tell me that in all their dating years and even after their marriage that they didn't do the nitty gritty, unless old Joey was batting for the other-"
Castiel is twenty six years old.  He has a new job that suits his skills and experience but it means he has to do lots of lovely long reports that take hours.  It’s 9pm and he can’t do any more work or he might actually just start crying because he is sick of this damn report and he is sick of the fact he is in his childhood bedroom doing it.  That’s because he and Meg split up and she had her own apartment, not Castiel’s so he had to move back with the parents.  He is twenty six and is living with his parents; if you looked up pathetic in the dictionary you would find a picture of him.
Sarah had told Samuel that you were alive and her husband was currently keeping him entertained the best way an old man from Kansas could do.   You tearfully thank her and she asks you softly how far along you are.  You look up at her in fear and blurt out that you had not realised till this morning that you were with child.
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Castiel bit back his sardonic smile and nodded politely, because as much as he was pleased that Hester was doing her bit for Civil Rights, he knew that she was just saying it to impress her.  They had been dancing all evening and Castiel had got the impression that Hester had a very good opinion of herself and fished for compliments that as an only grandchild she had always received.
Castiel shook his head furiously and heard Sam giggle, “Come on, Angel.”
It is hot; the sun high in the sky so everyone is in the cabins so you hope that you can use that as your excuse.  But in the slightly cooler evenings you hear people make their way up on deck to enjoy the sunset.  It is then when you hear a firm knock at your door.  You know it is Dean and you are going to shout an excuse when he opens the door and stomps in closing the door behind him before you can even say a word.
It is dawn when the ship docks in Jamestown and Dean rises to leave your cabin.  You bite back the tears that want to fall, your future father in law said he would meet when you arrived and you cannot go to him with red rimmed eyes.
You watch numbly as Dean kneels and places his head upon the block.  It almost feels like a dream, then in a flash the axe falls and he is gone.  You do not realise you are crying till you cover you face with your hands and they come away wet.  You cannot imagine a world without Dean and try not to let the bile rise in your gut as they take his head and body away.
Afterwards as Castiel lies in Dean's arms, they don't talk and Dean tries to calm his contradicting thoughts, wondering how he got here when he knows exactly how he got here. Yet none of this was ever meant to happen. Dean is straight, he is a straight guy, he loves women and yet here he is in bed with a man, yeah he may be an angel, but his vessel is a man.
But you are drawn to Dean; you are quiet and have rarely ever been like this.  But then you realise you have never even spoken to him.  You realise you have watched him so much and he is always around.  He always seems to be lurking in the shadows when you leave someone’s bed and are stumbling back to your own and he is there watching with wary green eyes that seem to glow in the moonlight.
“Sam,” Castiel hissed. “Sam!”
Walking back to where they had left the car, they didn't say much to each other, Sam thought he should mention that it was Christmas Eve tomorrow, perhaps they could do something but he didn't know whether post purgatory Dean would want to or if Cas would even be here.
“There has been a crash, near home,” Anna says handing the paper to Cas and he looks, it’s on a local road where they live which is notorious for accidents, there is a picture of a very damaged car in a tree and Cas shakes his head, because he can tell it’s a young person that has been driving the car, probably drunk or probably just too fast.  Young people in cars will never learn, he rolls his eyes over the article, it doesn’t say who was driving except it was 22 year old male soldier.
He watches the boy quietly, watching him belt the ball against the wall, sending an echo around the area and the ball bounced over to Castiel, “Over here!” the boy shouted, nodding that he should kick it, Castiel got off his bike and chipped the football over to the boy, “Thanks!”
Castiel has tried not to think about Dean Winchester over the last few days, he has ignored the phone calls and text messages, he won’t torture himself with what the messages say and deletes them because hell is going back to the thirteen year old boy who would read into everything that Dean said or did.
But Dean now visibly winces when he sees Gabriel trail his hand down your arm and pulls you to his bed.  There is a dark glint in Dean’s eyes when Uriel kisses your neck where the marks Dean gave you are as Uriel’s hand paws at your thigh moving further up.  You look to Dean who seems to biting so hard down on his jaw it could shatter.
Everything changed again when you arrived back in England; Dean was elevated so high, his sister was now Queen of England and carrying the King’s son.   You should have paid more attention to Dean’s vicious wife who had been married to him as a child but you paid her no heed.  Dean did not love her, he loved you.
“What?” Castiel asks mildly, sipping his third coffee.
“Yeah? Well my mother didn’t want me for this life, but I love to dance so she kicked me out when I was sixteen.  I’ve been dancing ever since, it’s the only thing I have ever wanted to do anyway.” Jo said bitterly, her eyes sad.
The church preaches against so many things you wonder if God and Jesus would agree with them. Then you remember you have sworn before God to do your duty as a Knight.  The next morning the Saracen wakes you and you are thrown because you never see him in the morning.  He gives you water and unbound your chains from around your wrist and beckons for you to follow him.
You were taught from a young age that Sodomy was a sin but in your heart you know that this love could not be a sin, it could not anger God.  It was pure, it was beautiful and if God did not recognise that.  You refuse to recognise God so be damned to Hell for blasphemy.
Finally it hits you, a white heat as you find your release and you bite into his shoulder.  Trembling you collapse onto him and he wraps his arms around you nuzzling your neck and peppering your jaw with kisses.  You brush his hair, wet with sweat from his face and brush your hands down his cheeks.
Dean works even harder now he has a son; he comes home tired but always with a ready smile, a kiss for you and open arms for Samuel.  The little boy dotes on his father and always smiles whenever he sees Dean.   You both rejoice when he survives the winter and laugh when he in the spring starts to toddle on unsteady feet and you watch as Dean helps him gently holding on to both his hands.
"You don't believe that Mary was a virgin?" Castiel growled, his eyes narrowing.
Then he moves he fucks you so that it feels like you are catching fire, that any minute you will burst into flames.  You moan together, sucking on each other’s lips and shaking the bed against the wall, rattling as the room as it is filled with breathy moans and sighs.
You do not say anything, just stare at his face and fist your hands into his uniform, into his pink triangle.  Tears fill your eyes and you do not know what to say.  Dean doesn’t expect you to say anything and so presses his lips to yours.  They are dry and chapped so you respond so gently ever so gently as he sucks on your lip and gains access to your mouth.
It is the star to every wandering bark,
And that was when it changed, the angel’s worship was rewarded when he felt Dean seize under him, almost sobbing Castiel’s name when he came, he looked away but the angel forced Dean to look at him as Cas tumbled over the edge also filling him with his seed.   It was in that moment that Castiel saw love, pure love in those green eyes that were softer, that were almost amazed.
Chuck Novak smiled nodding his hello in Hester’s direction, “Angel’s starting Mount Holyoke in the fall,”
“Yeah just remembering when we met,” Castiel said smiling at Dean who no longer looks like a young lad, he has wrinkle lines at his eyes, which are tired from working.  He is still strong and muscular and wears a beany hat to cover his longish hair and his chin is sprouting fluff.  Castiel cannot keep from looking at the wedding ring that is on his left hand but looks away before Dean can see him staring at it.
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
And yet every glance you chance at each other is a conversation of itself.  You look to make sure he has survived each day and he looks for you each morning.  You find the old feelings you felt for him in your teenage years resurface.  He was a beautiful youth and even now is a beautiful man despite the fact a cough rattles his chest.  The winter is getting colder and his chest gets worse.
I can’t remember the exact moment I realised I fell in love with you. I knew I loved you. I loved you the moment you chose me over heaven in that room, covering my mouth and writing bloody sigils on the wall. I owed you so much love and loyalty in return and I gave it willingly. But when did I fall in love with you? When did that love turn into something else? Probably when being apart from you felt like a festering wound. Purgatory. Not knowing where you were and if you were even alive poisoned my soul. I needed to find you, I had to find you I was prepared to tear apart Purgatory to find you and then I did. And of course you didn’t think you deserved to be saved and I think it was then that I knew I had fallen in love with you. Because things were felt right when we were together you know?
Only when he knows he is completely hidden and only then does he lets his eyes travel to the figure standing in the doorway to the bathroom. Castiel is drying his hands and Dean doesn't say anything, he just stares into those blue eyes which stare back and he tries to ignore the skip his heart makes when he sees that the angel isn't wearing his coat and his tie, his shirt is unbuttoned slightly at the top.
"Oh really?" Castiel glared, attempting sarcasm and actually getting it right.
“Hi Dean,” Cas said gruffly, “Can I help?”
He watches you with lazy eyes but he bites his lip and you can see his breathy pants and feel his heart race.  You keep trailing your fingers down his body and around his legs to caress his cheeks.  You are not sure for a moment that he will let you do this.  For this is the act that, that if caught, could condemn you to death.  You look to him for permission and he looks at you with such gentleness it takes your breath away.  He nods gently and helpfully spreads his legs.
You do not talk of what will happen, only what has happened.  You tell him that you love him and question whether he regrets any of it.  He angrily shushes you and tells you that he does not regret it; he only regrets that he did not have the sense to escape to the country with you.  You smile at that image of you both living in a country house, lying in a great bed till late in the morning.  You would pay the servants well so they would not talk.
The angel looked back up to the hunters eyes, so many times they had shared glances and this was similar and yet so very different at the same time.  Castiel could feel Dean’s pulse race in the hand that still held the angels wrist.  There was something new in the hunter’s eyes that Castiel could recognise because this emotion was flooding his blood and no doubt was reflected in his own blue eyes.  Castiel swallowed he desired so much to feel Dean, to move closer to Dean but still he did not move.
You have been fucking men for over ten years but you have never felt any desire or enjoyment, preferring to switch off and go through the motions.  But you feel heat rise in your lower belly, your chest and your cheeks.  You feel desire and it feels foreign to you.
Zachariah stalked off back to the waiters, when one of the entertainment guys sighed “It’s the same at all these places, some ass in the woods but no conversation!”
That’s perhaps why you all don’t see them attacking before it’s too late.  Suddenly it is all noise, gone is the silence of hot horses and grumbling men.  It is a quick snap and it is all clanging of metal, screams of horses and the yells of men.   The Saracens have slammed right into your flank, slashing and cutting through it like a hot knife through butter.
Castiel looked to Sam then to Dean and Jo. “Can’t someone else fill in?”
It’s as if the Saracen can read your thoughts and he asks whether it is true or not that you God said Thou shall not kill.
You turn to him and see his haunted eyes that are wrinkled with smiling; you can tell the war has not been kind to him.  But you watch the smile disappear as he notes your high belly, he pales and almost staggers.  You can see his heart breaking and you it kills you inside that you have done this; you have broken this man’s heart.  Samuel tugs his father’s hand, dragging him to the table and Dean recovers well enough to take his seat.
Things come to a head when you are walking across the courtyard watching Dean train with Sam, he catches your eye for a second a flash of a sly grin that makes your knees tremble when hands grab you from behind.  Zachariah slides his hands under your skirts and mouths at your neck, cupping your breast with his free hand.  You squeeze your eyes shut and try to black out the sensation but then the hands are gone and there is noise and commotion.  You open your eyes and see Dean has Zachariah pinned to the ground, a sword on his throat and a growl upon his lips.
“Goodbye Father,” he says softly into the howling wind coming off the North Sea.
Within seconds Castiel has flown from the bunker and is in a small church on a little island off the English Northumberland Coast, Holy Island.  Lindisfarne, the island famous because the Vikings pillaged this part of England first, but it is still holy, the monks and faithful that flocked here over centuries can be felt in the earth.  He once watched Bede write the gospels here.  He watched the monastery be torn down by Reformation all scars are felt in the air of the tiny church that is over a thousand years old.
You travel through the cooler dusk then make camp at night; you are chained the whole time and are chained to a palm tree in a small oasis where you have made camp.  You listen to the voices around the campfires and though you cannot understand what they are saying but the conversations cannot be that different to those you had with your fellow comrades.
It hurts knowing that you can’t hear me.
That afternoon he kisses you right until the point he has to leave and you watch him leave, you never like watching him leave.  You fret but then you think back to the previous night when he worshipped your body.  You smile and close your eyes in sensuality; this is possibly the first time you have smiled in true happiness since your childhood.
You next thought after the initial panic is your daughter, you have not heard of people surviving this illness.  You hear your girl crying in her bed and as much as you want to go to her but now knowing you have this black illness you cannot go to her.
I shall but love thee better after death.
Dean Winchester
Then there are feet in front of your eyes and hands grip your shoulders and yank you up.  You blink disoriented as a foreign tongue yells in your ear.  Finally your eyes refocus and you stare into the eyes of a very angry Saracen.  He shouts at your rapidly and you blink dumbly and realise that this is it.  You are going to die.  You wonder why he still has not killed you and look around and see that you are only one left; your entire troop is dead.  Death will be welcome to you now.
You turn back and find hands clamping your face and he is kissing you and it is like the first rain after a long drought.  You throw your arms around his sweating neck and his him passionately, his tongue seeks access to your mouth and you willingly give it whimpering.  You break off only because you breathe and he leans his forehead against yours as you gaze into each other’s eyes.  You ask him if he can do two favours of you.  He looks puzzled but nods, you ask him to take your bed and burn it for it is your bed no longer and build a new one.  He nods and says he will do this and demands your second task, you breathe on to his lips asking him to come to join you in the new bed.
They had drank and laughed at Castiel’s reaction to the drink, but by nearing Midnight they were all rather feeling relaxed and happy in each other’s company, watching Die Hard on the small tv screen with Dean almost adding Dolby surround sound by saying everyone one of Bruce Willis’ lines.
You are not free.  You are a slave and you are a whore.
They take each other in; they have waited five years for this.  So they take their time, the only time their eyes drift from each other’s is to look at their skin.  Toned chest, freckles on shoulders, a mole beside a nipple. Committing everything to memory.
