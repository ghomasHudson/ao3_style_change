“NO!” Steve cried out and ran towards the balcony, rushing past his foe and laying his hands on the railing, looking down into the water’s depths. It was dark, and the waves were crashing into the side of the boat. Even with Steve’s level of vision, he couldn’t make out any bodies tumbling around in the ocean.
The genius’s eyebrows furrowed, and his mouth set in a thin line. The Captain and him had been meeting together a lot. Steve had requested they watch movies he had never seen, or played board games, sometimes even video games. Tony had always been up for their sessions, but lately it had seemed a little close for him. He didn’t want to get close to anyone so soon after Pepper. The closeness had felt awkward and bizarre to Tony… the dreams and his seclusion were not the only reason he had canceled.
After a few minutes, he remembered that he shouldn’t be alone. Steve should be here. But, Steve was nowhere to be seen and Tony felt fear spike into his chest as his heart began thrumming faster with anxiety.
“Yeah, well, we aren’t out of it yet, now are we?” The latter was said with mild irritation as the brain behind the comment was trying to formulate a plan.
Steve opened his eyes slowly and slid his body off of the man under him. He blinked the dust from his eyes.
This chapter is extremely non-con and was hard to write. It isn't as long as the other chapters for this reason. Please be cautious when reading.
Steve never stayed long in one place.  He liked little towns, where people didn’t immediately know who he was.  He liked drinking coffee in the open air in the mornings, hearing birds in mountain trees.  He liked the way the breeze smelled, outside the city.
“Leave Steven here, Tony. I will accompany you to retrieve the Thai victuals,” Thor demanded.
-Flying”
If it was a day like any other, Steve should come wandering down in about fifteen minutes with his sketchbook.  Even if they didn’t have a project to work on, he seemed to drift into the workshop anyway.  It was the best part of Tony’s day, although sometimes he was busy and didn’t get to spend as much time talking as he’d like.  A few of his sketches hung around the workshop.  Sometimes Tony thought he should take them down.  They gave him away.  But Steve hadn’t seemed to notice yet, so they weren’t an issue.
“Tony,” comes the frayed reply.  It’s a little late for that. It’s a little late for sympathy, after Siberia.
Steve hadn’t been able to sleep all night.  At 10am precisely, Coulson walked into Steve’s office, holding a stack of thick manila files.
An hour later, Tony had lost by over twenty points. Even though Steve had to awkwardly bend over to use the tiny golf club. Tony blamed losing his ball once to the duck pond to some high-school-date related PTSD, and maybe two more points for ogling Steve instead of concentrating, but still, Steve had handed him his ass.  The fucker was leading by a dozen points when he looked at #18 (which went between the rotating blades of the windmill, through the scary clown’s mouth—opening and closing like a gasping fish, around three corners, and over a timed drawbridge), lined up the shot cleanly and precisely, and sunk a hole in one.  It was a par-9.
When he could, he slept again.  Most nights, he made coffee in the little plastic machine and sat at his round kitchen table, listening to the tick of the plastic clock they’d bought him, afraid he wouldn’t be able to use his phone, the way the modern world had learned.  He’d go through what he’d read during the day.  He knew the next fight was coming.  He was a weapon, a soldier.  As far as SHIELD was concerned, he was engineered to get blood on his hands.
Tony groaned and knocked his head against a helpfully nearby wall.
She peered at him doubtfully over the video call.  “Okay, Tony. We’ll write up a contract for Steve.  Oh, and Mr. Stane is going to come see you this afternoon.  Something he wants to discuss with only you.”
Tony, I can send you their number if you want? They’re great.
Shit.
“Shit.”
The forms asked for standard employee information, but he still didn’t really want to give anything away. Nothing he didn’t have to, anyway.  Most of it wasn’t a big deal, since his parents were already dead.  Place of residence? Well.  Here, he guessed.  He wasn’t going to drag Natasha into it.  Contact in case of emergency? Bucky.  Last place of employment? The army.  Those were discharge papers that he had fought hard to win.  He had only ever wanted to look after Bucky, anyway.  Steve filled out as much as he could.  References? Pretty much Bucky.  Who else would he have listed? Monty? Pretty sure he was with MI6 right now.  Last he’d heard, Dernier was on some top-secret research problem in Switzerland.  Jones was still with the military, but not officially.  It was one of those things.  And Steve was pretty sure that both Morita and Dugan had been flown to some country in the middle of Africa to help a transitioning government.  Besides, he didn’t want to get anyone else involved.  Although, given that Mr. Stark had a functioning AI, that might be a lost cause.  Still.  Steve wasn’t just going to give up anyone else’s name. He signed at the bottom, eyeing the mostly blank form balefully.  It was a paper reminder of what he no longer had. He shook himself.  Enough with the maudlin thoughts.  He had work to do.
“Tony!”
Steve looked around himself in shock, taking in the room, the diagram, and finally, Tony.
“Yes, Father.”
“Wow,” Tony muttered sarcastically, “they really aren’t that bright. Some guy got a hold of a real life magical book of, like, the magical equivalent of genetics or something, and he and his friends decided to play around. That cat-praying mantis thing we fought the first time? Was something like their hundredth experiment. They’re not too good at this.”
“I’m Steve Rogers, the Knight of America. Please. The kingdom is in danger, and I need your help to save it.”
“But… but the door is locked, how..?”
Since my baby's been gone, everything's lost
“You’re welcome. You’re a good teammate, Tony.” Really, Steve? He had held Tony to his chest like he was a child just because he was good to have on the battlefield? Steve didn’t know, and he knew even less what else to say. He closed his mouth, feeling his throat close up. He suddenly felt oppressively awkward, with no idea how to go from here. Hoping this wasn’t a bad choice, he nodded and turned to leave.
at him. Tony looked away, unable.
attempt? That was horrifying. Unease settled over Steve like a blanket. He wanted to do something. He wanted to punch something.
And then, Tony noticed something strange. Barnes's eyes seemed to dull, like all the life was going out of them. He looked in the direction of the ballroom, but didn't seem to be seeing anything. "Are you sure I'm the one you're looking for?" He asked in a soft monotone.
“What, someone’s going to hunt you for dinner?” Tony asked. He was not in control. His voice had gone shrill and he was clutching his hands in front of his chest, hunching down like a wounded animal. “I hear swan roast is all the rage—”
Leave it to Tony to be flippant on his potential death bed. Steve ripped that thought away. It was because it
“Excuse me,” he murmured, and beat a hasty retreat. Obie seemed to say something to him, but Tony paid no heed.
“You said you were cursed,” Tony said hesitantly. “But you didn’t give the full details. I just… Steve Rogers is a legend. And he lives happily ever after, you know? So how…,” Tony waved a hand towards Steve, “the swan thing, I just—”
“…there shouldn’t be any lasting effects,” the nurse was saying.
It was at that point that Obie and the man looked and spotted Tony.
Tony waved. “I’m right here.” His grin was a bit loopy, but he could at least move and talk now.
“I’m glad you think so, but we don’t always get what we deserve. My friend, Barnes, he… I lost him, during a quest. He was my greatest partner, and best friend. We were practically brothers. I couldn’t leave him to his fate, even though the King forbid me from going after him. In my arrogance, I thought I could take on Rothbart by myself… but I couldn’t. Instead of saving my friend, I got myself captured, so we were both stuck. We weren’t killed, but cursed to forever remain under his power. He keeps many warriors as his own flock of swans, and he turns us back so we can do his bidding on occasion.”
Tony was barely standing upright as it was. What was he going to save? All he did was get walked over and lied to. His girlfriend used him to steal the royal seal, and now he was losing his mind in a park. He couldn’t take this anymore. He deliberately ignored the man and turned back to the rail.
Walking away, he tried to get himself under control. It didn’t matter what Howard thought of him. All that mattered was finding Rothbart and preventing this spell from going off. He wouldn’t let Steve down. He couldn’t. Tony looked around, but couldn’t find Barnes. He did see Stane, so he went up to him, hoping Stane might know where Barnes had went.
“You want to read it again? But, it’s just a silly storybook…” Dum-E pushed the book into his hands. Tony grinned despite himself. “Fine, you big bag of bolts.” Tony sat down in a chair, and Dum-E came around so his camera was pressing right up against the book. Tony smiled and gently pushed the camera back so he could actually see the pages.
,” Steve barked in a military voice, “
Tony swallows, but has no idea how to respond. He doesn’t know what’s going on either. He’s never been bothered by nightmares before, but ever since that horrible night four nights ago, he hasn’t been sleeping well. He’s been plagued by the same monster, the same problem, but he keeps forgetting it when he wakes up.
“In a week’s time, hopefully,” the nurse replied. “There are some signs he needs to look out for, but as long as there are no more symptoms, then that should mean he’s made a full recovery.”
Steve ducked his head down. Relief softened him, and he looked very vulnerable all of a sudden. “Thank you,” he whispered.
“Tony, wake up!”
On one occasion, Tony had been fixing his Iron Man boot. There were pieces of glass in it that had melted into the crevices. Tony had sat hunched over his work table. He had had an eye glass magnifier strapped around his head. He zoomed it in and out until he got the right point, and then he took some small tweezers and was painstakingly pulling out all the glass, piece by piece. He spent about a half hour on them. Steve remembered being surprised by his focus and determination; Stark had always seemed to him like someone who had a low attention span who couldn’t be bothered by such mundane actions. This was the first time Steve had got a look at this other side to Tony.
“No worries, Rogers.  Look, make sure you feed yourself.  Mi casa, you know.  Besides, you sort of look like you need a lot of feedings. Not to make you sound like Shamu or anything. Just imagine that takes a lot of work to keep up.” Tony gestured at Steve’s general body, and Steve’s blush spread. Tony did not imagine the blush spreading across Steve’s chest.  He didn’t.  Or at least he tried not to. He took another bite, realizing it was the end of the sandwich.
“Yes.  Yes I do.  Can we get one?”
Tony kissed his shoulder.  “What’s with the battle garb, Mixalot?”
Steve felt himself blush and Tony hadn’t even meant anything by it.
She reached to his face, touching his forehead gently.  “I hadn’t realized mortals had become so wise.”
It’s ludicrous how fast Steve shows up outside his workshop door once Tony texts him.
Steve paled. “Please, I…” He trailed off. What could he say? He felt overexposed, unable to see the whole board.
"Criminal? Says the guy who broke in? Literally broke windows,” Tony retorted, noticing the trail of glass on the floor, “to get in? What are you looking for—oh, don’t tell me—regeneration? Didn’t want to wait for something a little more government-issue?”
Tony commended him silently.
“Well, she was eyeing you like you were dinner.  Definitely didn’t have a story in mind when she was looking at you,” Tony felt obligated to say. Hard to blame her, really.
For a second, Bucky sat, stunned.  Steve didn’t want to breathe.  He didn’t want to break the moment. Then Bucky lunged for Natasha, hand tangled in her hair, mouth on hers, bending down so much she was angled backward. He tipped her back, lifting her on to the kitchen table, pinning her down.
Pepper sighed. “Handmade by the gifter. You have to make your own gift.”
His computer pinged.
Rhodey choked a little on nothing, then sputtered, “Yeah, yeah, you too, lovely again.”
“The deal? Not the secret?” Tony’s heart was hammering and he thought he might vomit, his knuckles white where he was gripping the steering wheel.
“Man, physics can’t even protect you from a cookie,” Sam said, looking wide-eyed and too innocent.
“No! That wasn’t the deal, Hammer,” Tony whispered back.  “I said I’d invite you places, I can’t change whether she likes you or not!”
Right.  Gloves.
This conference is over.”
“Mentoring is kind of a strong word for it.  Trying to stop him from getting himself killed is all. He’s a little ambitious maybe. Headstrong. Doesn’t know his limits.  Remind you of anyone?”
Tony could hear Barnes through the phone. He sounded like pure misery, drunk and crying.
Don’t worry. I understand.  You know, I like Batman, but my favorite was always Wonder Woman.  You know, Lasso of Truth, doing the right thing the right way.  I mean, they’re both vigilantes, technically, but the way she would always end up tied up and then rescue herself—actually, that doesn’t exactly sound how I meant it.  I mean the way she would always… now that I think about it, there was a lot of kinky shit in Wonder Woman.  Okay, maybe let’s take a step back from that one, reconsider why I was so into WW.  Man.  I mean, I thought it was because she was all about equality and justice, and my dad thought it was because I wanted to bone her, so win-win.  But now… It’s like my entire childhood is being refocused, right in front of my eyes!
Then he stopped completely.  Put down the filter.  He looked at the coffee cup sitting next to him.  The tight clutch Steve was keeping on the SHIELD notes.  The rosy blush on Steve’s cheeks.
He could do casual.  “Thanks for the pasta.”
Tony forced down the urge to vomit.  “Oh, that’s me.  He had some ideas about robotics and thought he’d drop by. After all, Nat and Bruce and I are on the team and now we’re all in one place.”
He was breathtaking.  Literally.  Tony’s breath literally stopped as the man pushed the door open, the sunlight framed his shoulders—broad shoulders, sure, but Neanderthalian? Not a chance.  They tapered into a waist that was just unfair, and legs that went on forever.  That, and it all supported the prettiest face he’d ever seen.
But when he’d blown off Stern and found Dr. Selvig, telling him he’d email his old MIT research notes on the Kuiper cliff, Steve was back, as if he’d never been gone.
I'm pretty sure this is still M appropriate?
Tony smirked at him.  “You bet,” he said, smacking Steve’s butt as he walked away.  Steve hesitated at the door, not wanting to leave this magical world, reluctant to relinquish even a moment of this day. “I’ll be here when you get back,” Tony said, as if reading his mind, eyes on Steve, affectionate.  “I’ll be here.”
Tony laughs, or something close to it. “You hated those PSAs.”
He took a deep breath and splashed water on his face.  It was going to be okay. He went back out to his friends.
Trust Steve to see the best in everyone.
“We’ll be there, Tones.  You’re not cooking, though, are you?” Rhodey asked.
Tony was pretty sure he knew what that unlocked.  He picked his way through the basement to the heaviest looking brick in the room.  Yep.  There it was.  An early electronically coded lock.  He entered the digits Jarvis gave him and opened the cabinet—well, safe was probably a closer term.  It was weighty, lined with lead and fireproofed.  He swung the unwilling, creaky door open, reaching inside for the papers within.
“And we have chicken fingers in the freezer, don’t we? Or do you think we could do it with tofu instead?” Steve asked.
“Well, um, I was just thinking that we’re neighbors, and well, I didn’t know what kind of traditions you have for Thanksgiving, but I’m having some friends over at eight to have a second Thanksgiving, more of a friendsgiving, except that’s a totally lame name for it, but whatever, it’s kind of what it is, but there won’t be any turkey, anyway, if you want to come over you can,” Tony rambled, not taking a breath.
Jesus.
“Steve?” Tony asked, a little desperate.  “Any input?”
“He.  I thought he.” Why was it so hard to say? “I thought he was going to kiss me, on the way home.” Steve was bright red. Embarrassment, desire, disappointment. “After I’d helped out at a party instead of his old PA. But then he apologized and said…” He sifted through the memory, wanted to get the words exactly right.  “He said: ‘That wasn’t like me to do something like that. I’m not like that.’ That seems pretty clear to me.”
Steve knew it hadn’t really been a mistake. Stern definitely had ulterior motives to getting Bucky off the list. It was a clear ploy.  Stern had been trying to corner Steve all night, been dogging him since before then.
Tomorrow Tony will look over at Steve, across a room filled with their friends, only to find him already looking back.  He’ll realize that this is all he wants. And that it’s already his. And that it is only the beginning.
Steve looked up, regret clearly still in his gaze.  “Of course. If you really want to. But you look a little run down.  Could you maybe skip the conference? Have Pepper do it, as CEO?”
Tony went to the workshop and set the metal disc in the fabricator.  He’d tinker for a little.  Get things ready.  He hit play on one of his playlists and started uploading the design, shaking his hips in time to the bass.
“No? Okay, no prob. I’ll just hold on to you until the cops come.”
“Stark. The Merchant of Death. Here to take a shot?” the intruder asked, faux-casually.
“Nat, what the hell are you doing with a gun?” Steve asked, clearly relaxing. Barnes’s girlfriend moved into the living room, red hair aflame in the afternoon sun.  Barnes followed close on her heels, a rifle slung over his back.
Tomorrow, they will have brunch with Pepper and Rhodey and Natasha and Bucky. Rhodey will discreetly not mention how well Tony works with Steve in the kitchen, happy to chop tomatoes or move bacon to the paper towel lined racks as long as he’s standing close, as long as he gets that quiet smile from Rogers. Tomorrow Tony will explain the reactor, earning sympathetic admonitions from Pepper and Rhodey, curiosity from Natasha, and a gentle squeeze of his hand from Steve; he will, with Steve’s permission, explain Project Rebirth.  Tomorrow Pepper will have paperwork with her, already, to invest in and hire the consulting business that Natasha is creating with Bucky and Steve to prevent civilian casualties, reduce overall losses, and build better relationships with indigenous populations to preclude the necessity of military action (Bucky wants to call it Defensive Agency for Strategy, Hostility Inhibition, and Tact Support.  He pretends not to know what it spells.  Natasha has put the kybosh on that). Steve wants to bring on Sam Wilson, too, once he’s done with night classes.  Sam had said he’d spent so much time listening to people as a bartender, he just went ahead and enrolled as a psych major. Tomorrow Jarvis will make a note to send him a contract.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Steve said, not seeing where he was going with that particular line of questioning.
Then he smirked.
When Tony woke up, on the pavement, sky blessedly clear of monstrous flying robot iguanas, the wormhole closed, the arc reactor ached in his chest, carving out space for itself, stealing his breath.
Peggy strode over to Pepper, a ragged shirt and a packet of Neosporin still in her hands. “He won’t listen to me, Pepper,” she pleaded.  “I told him he should press charges against the monster but he won’t do it.  Says Brock’s going through a difficult time!”
Nomad works well with Iron Man, reports say.  Not as well as Captain America had, but still.  There’s something there. They tend to work from opposite ends of a battle, rather than in the thick of it together. The media adores Nomad and his sweaty, naked, well-displayed chest.  He never handles the press anymore, lets someone else do cleanup and interface with the public.  Then one day, after a particularly long battle against someone who seems not to realize that Hydra’s dead, one of the commentators brings up the Accords, asks if Nomad has already signed, and if not, if he shouldn’t be locked up.
So did you ever have a crush on your best friend? I haven’t, I don’t know why. Just wondering.” That was casual right? That didn’t sound worried?  Totally casual. Just dropped in.
The sound of Pepper’s heels clicked quickly into the room.  “And I’m sure you won’t, Steve.  Happy just likes to be diligent.  But he understands, don’t you, Happy?” She turned a razor gaze on him.
She kissed the top of his head and slid the ring onto his right hand.  “Love you,” she said fondly.  Then she turned to Steve.  “Thank you, Steve.  I owe you one.”
“Oh?”
“Yep, and this genius needs his sleep.  Today was exhausting.  I hope whatever bit them wears off as they sleep.” Tony didn’t mean to sound bitter, but he couldn’t help it.  He was a genius, after all, and he could put it all together.  They all had some sort of momentary infatuation with him.  Everyone except Steve.  Which was great, it was, really, except that the only person he wanted to be hopelessly besotted with him was the sweet idiot standing in front of him. The only one whose demeanor hadn’t changed at all.
Steve bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to draw blood, withdrawing his hand.  “No.  You’re still clean.”
He pushed open the door.  And found Steve.  Without the top half of his costume, pushed up against the wall by… Lorraine? Her hands were halfway down his pants and her tongue was more in his mouth than in hers, her corset completely unhooked and dangling from Steve’s hand.
“Aye, Lady Sif,” Thor affirmed.  “Now that you have shown me the truth, I do not know why I had not seen it before.  Forseti’s amulet shows me who he truly is.”
“So, I was watching Natasha,” he said, winking, knowing that Tony knew he would never cheat, but teasing anyway. “She’s so small—do you think you could pop a parachute on the back of her suit?”
“I… I didn’t make it.  I had a doctor’s appointment suddenly, sort of an experimental treatment.” His eyes were searching Tony’s, looking for something, seemingly. Whatever it was, Tony didn’t know what to give him, although he would have if he could. He’d probably give anything, at this point.
“Let’s use my shirt to cover both of us…you need it more than I do. This sweat is going to put you straight into hypothermia. C’mere.” He pulled Tony’s form in close to him and pulled the large garment over their chests.
The minions slid over to one side of the room, falling over each other as they did so. Pig-face had left the room shortly before Steve began his torture session, so he was absent from the dogpile on the floor.
He had failed.
He continued to believe that Steve was real. He held onto the belief like a drowning man to a broken buoy. He had nothing except his beliefs and his own mind, so he would keep those. His beliefs and his feather were hidden in a box tied with string, placed in the back of his heart.
“I should hope so, I practically raised you,” he said easily, slipping a juicy prawn onto his plate.
. His shield ate dust, because the monster was already in the air, and on Tony.
“What,” Tony gasped. He backed up, stumbled, and nearly fell into the river anyway. “What the, I, huh—”
Tony’s blood ran cold, though he couldn’t figure out why. Tony kept asking himself, was Barnes going to do the spell now? Would he do it earlier than Steve had said? What was going on? He didn’t know, but he decided to just keep doing what he was doing and wait it out. Barnes couldn’t use a spell in the middle of a room, he was sure. He would have to slip away at some point to enact any sort of spell, so Tony would have to keep a lookout. Tony reached into his pocket and felt the feather. Steve needed him. He wouldn’t let Steve down.
He couldn’t get the words out of his head all day.
“Barnes,” Steve whispered. “Dum Dum. Please, fight it.”
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room
“Well if you would finally sober up, we could talk to you directly,” Jan said.
“Daddy’s home!” Tony called, throwing open the doors to his workshop. From the charging pod, Dum-E perked up and excitedly whirred his claw around. Dum-E nearly came barreling into him, and Tony held his hands up.
Then Tony noticed the dagger in the swans thigh holster, and got an idea.
There was no razor in the bathroom, and medication was given to him pill by pill under supervision. The windows were barred with beautiful wrought iron, and his room was locked. He had stopped eating two days ago, and was force fed broth. They threatened to hook him up to an IV. He didn’t care anymore.
“Tony, maybe you’ve missed the memo, but you’ve completely fucked things up,” Obie said with a finality that beat on Tony’s heart painfully. “You’ve lost it recently. We need to hand feed you the recent updates in the political world before every event, because you can’t be bothered to actually read up on the news yourself. No, you’re much too busy stepping out with that woman who only wanted to steal from you. Honestly, your father’s such a good judge of character, I don’t know what happened with you.”
The man set Tony down delicately, the way he would if Tony was a priceless artifact or an expensive porcelain bowl. Tony’s heart was racing, and he felt unsteady.
“Looking through the window,
“We’ll find a way,” Steve said, still smiling down at Tony. Tony couldn’t think with that smile pointed in his direction, so he just nodded.
“What talisman?” Stane asked, as sure of himself as ever. He held his palms up in a calming gesture. “Tony, I think you’ve been under a lot of stress recently, and maybe you need a break—”
Obadiah Stane became the King’s advisor shortly after Queen Maria had died, and worked his way up the ranks ever since until he was now the most important person in the country after the King himself. Who carried a talisman in his pocket.
Steve recoiled, but before he could do anything else, there was a crash behind him.
Share together.”
“You’re not dead.” The man stretched out his hands, and then put them back down like he didn’t know what to do with them. “Please, listen to me. I need your help.”
Tony ran the whole way out of the room and back into the ballroom. He looked around until he found Stane, and he went to pursue him after putting the pistol back into his pocket. He was frazzled, scared, and unsure of himself. What was he going to do? The time was almost up for the completion of the spell, but there wasn’t much he could do about it, was there? He was just going to have to confront Stane in front of everyone. Maybe if he could convince his father, it would be okay.
Steve stared. Then, he snarled.
Steve turned and crossed the bridge, and disappeared into the shadows.
“Come on, you’re a man now. What’s all this racket? This is the fourth night in a row you’ve woken up screaming. What’s your problem?”
“Avengers!” Steve ordered. “Let’s go."
“You were a swan, mister, I’m not sure if it would be good for my sanity to even entertain this… I was going to just end it all, why did you have to stop me—”
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
“I don’t know what the stories tell, but I didn’t get a happily ever after,” Steve said with a sad smile.
Mad about the boy
“Dummy? What, that dumb machine you programmed? You have got to be kidding me. Tony, get up here so we can fix this. Do you know what’s happened?”
His heart rate went down.
“Let who go?! Tony, please, listen to me.”
Tony flinched, and shot to his feet. He ran to hide the magic books that he had left haphazardly on his workbench.
Tony stared at their clasped hands, and then swallowed. He came to a decision. “Okay.” He nodded. “Okay, yeah. I’ll help you, whatever you need.” Tony lifted his gaze to Steve’s own bright, earnest eyes.
Steve nodded, and went to stand by the door. He glared out into the corridor. He waited.
All he had wanted to do for Steve was just to save him from the spell, but he hadn’t even been able to do that. The one thing he had decided on to save his own life, and he wasn’t able to do it. Now, he was just wandering listlessly throughout the day, going through the motions, waiting for death.
Steve dragged him over to the doors, where one good kick from the eminent soldier was all it took to open the doors. Tony, for the first time in a long time, felt his face spread into a grin, and he and Steve smiled at each other. The world was beautiful.
He had access to everything. Literally. Tony’d given him access to every file in SI, no limits. He’d traced some of the money to offshore accounts, putting his rusty Farsi and French to good use. Apparently his time in the army gave him some marketable skills after all. The more he used his language skills to parse through the documents he’d found, the more they returned to him.
“Cap, I’m sorry, but Hulk just threw half the food in the gutter and Thor fried the rest with Mjolnir.  I have no idea what’s going on, but---hey! Stop that! Steve, we’re not bringing dinner home.  There’s no way I can go back there and—Natasha, put the goat down! No, I—no! I don’t need an ode! Jesus I gotta go.”
Coulson put his hands in his pockets and rocked back slightly on his heels.  “I thought it might be nice for you to make some friends.” His face shifted into something that looked a bit like an affable grin, a bit like cheek.  Steve noted it.  So it wasn’t Fury’s idea.  This was Coulson.  Okay.  He could work with that.
No.  Steve liked Natasha. He would have put money on her asking Bucky to marry her before the end of the year.  She knew how difficult it was to transition back to civilian life, and she’d never been anything but supportive.
That did sound good.  Steve returned to his room, finding his duffle bag on his bed.  Funny how quickly he thought of it as his bed.  He opened the duffle.  Toothbrush, comb, clothes.  He really didn’t leave the army with much.  And yet, with too much.  He sighed.
Tony reaches out with the back of his hand, his palm away from Steve, even with no gauntlet. He strokes the back of his fingers down Steve’s cheek.  Steve shudders, his whole body trembles, his eyes close, his lashes are damp. Tony’s eyes are wet and his lungs are burning.
“Tony, I know you have a lot of pressure on you.  But you need to take a break, see things the way they are.” He tapped the vintage bobblehead sitting on his desk. “Expectations on you are high. They are. Higher than they should be. You might feel like you’re under a microscope here, since I know Howard has high hopes for you.” He smiled kindly at Tony.
That didn’t really square with what he had learned and seen today.  He hesitated.
ok. that's it. i'm a little nervous. what do you think?
“You broke my hand!” Stane whined, outraged, fingers hanging at an awkward angle.
Tony squeezes the uniform through the package delivery slot.  It barely fits.  It’s a little bulkier than the eighties-style get up Steve was wearing a minute ago. He tries not to look at Steve’s body, but it’s impossible.  He’s still so beautiful.  He’s still so familiar.  Tony’s fingers ache to touch him. Steve straps on the new uniform.  Moves around, twists.  It’s perfect.  He fabricated it out of a design he’d had sitting around, the basis of a new Cap uniform.  Better protection and flexibility. More streamlined. Steve looks breathtaking in it, the plunging neckline not much protection, but once Steve commits to a design, there’s no budging him.  He sticks to it.  Once Steve commits to anything, Tony thinks.
“Guys, drinks in the kitchen, karaoke in the living room! Daaamn, Pepper, who you gonna use that whip on later?” Sam teased her, shooting finger guns at Natasha and high-fiving Rhodey.
Fuck.
Huh. “How did he get in?”
“How do you know I won’t just leave those restraints on and call Ross?”
“Of course you did. Thank you.”
“Look, Rogers, I’m sorr—did you
“Yeah, you just jump off shit and hope for the best, no zipline for you.”
Steve looked a bit regretful. “No.  I did have one date. We were supposed to come here, play a round. Never made it.”
Clicking send, Tony locked his phone and drifted off to sleep.
The minute Tony’s arms closed around Steve’s ribs, he felt all the tension deflate from him, that same shudder running through him. His hand came up to close over Tony’s. Tony kissed his back.  “Steve.  Why didn’t you say something?”
Tony didn’t hack Fury’s office—not really.  He already had the hack there from before—he just opened the channel. He didn’t need, at this point, to hear the sound.  He just watched Steve’s shoulders, the tension rising.  Watched him draw himself up.  Steve had considered the outcomes, that was clear. Knew he might lose his job.
Steve smiled again, one of those sweet, molasses smiles, like Tony was all he saw, all he wanted.  They killed him, every time.  “Thanks, Tony,” he said, trying on a glove. “They feel like leather,” he noted, surprised.
Scenario two: Tony was being attacked by… something.  Jarvis had excellent security, and would have alerted the rest of the Avengers if something had gotten in, but every once in a while Tony would bring home something dangerous and instruct Jarvis not to rat him out.  Jarvis had to obey, it was in his programming, but sometimes he could find a workaround. That’s how Steve walked in on a miniature elephant trying to stampede Tony three months ago.  Stupid shrinkray.
“Superman? No way, man, the Flash.  He’d be so fast Skywalker would never catch him,” Sam said.
They had just put down a horde of flying electric jellyfish. Tony’d taken a direct hit, and the suit was out of commission.  He’d loaded it up on a quinjet, patted it fondly.  When he turned away, Steve was looking at him, an undecipherable look in his eyes.
“Down the hallway, second door on the left,” Pepper told them as she sorted through another stack of green index cards.
Tony wasn’t sure he’d be back. But it wasn’t like he really needed another PA for much longer, anyway. Stop being maudlin, he told himself, and get back to work.
Steve took Tony’s fingers in his hand, kissing them.  “You don’t need to give me anything, Tony. Being with you is everything.”
“Loki,” Steve agreed, trying to laugh along, but it felt like there wasn’t enough air in his lungs for that.
Steve starts forward, stops. Takes one deliberate step back.  “Tony, it’s—“ he starts.
did that.  He was responsible for that smile.  He’d managed to lighten the load for Tony.  He might not be able to figure out his own mess, but he was able to help Tony, a little.  That had to be worth something.
She threw her arms around him, squishing the bagels.  Rhodey hugged him, too. “It’s been a weird couple of days, Tones,” he said. “Weirder not having you around though.  Don’t go disappearing on us again, okay?”
That’s all.  What an asshole.  Tony took stock:
Steve swung his leg over the motorcycle, turning back to look at Tony, that same look just below the surface.  Tony got on behind him, wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. A slight shudder went through Steve, and he put his hands over Tony’s. Interesting.
“Dear Shell,
“No, Mr. S—Tony.  She really didn’t.  You can trust her.  I.  I asked Jarvis.  I just noticed, and then, so.” He noticed? He’d been here like six hours.  How had he noticed anything?  “And she only gave me the code so I could help.  I swear.  She cares about you.  And.  I--I’m just trying to help.  But I get it if you. Because I. Look, I understand. So, I’ll find a new way to pay you back.”
What was he supposed to write? So, had a really bad day? Punched any blond guys lately?  And maybe it wasn’t him. Maybe it was someone else. Maybe it was someone he’d never even talked to, although that wasn’t very likely, since Shield High was fairly small.  Tony had probably at least talked to every senior once.
Trying to decide if I want to earn that M rating for real or not...
There had been no nightmares this time. No costumes in mind.  Just Tony, brilliant and magnetic. Steve was fucked.
“Go. Make sure Barnes gets help. Make sure he gets into that program.”
“Okay, I’ve got you, I’ve got you, babe,” Tony said, refocusing. He licked the joint at the top of Steve’s thigh where it was red, irritated from his beard, tongue pressing firmly into the crease, and Steve’s cock pulsed again, spurting liquid across his abdomen. Tony swiped his fingers through it, sucking gently at the base of Steve’s shaft.
“Oh, thanks,” Steve said. “But cross country is a team sport, even if we run individually.  It’s really Sam and T’Challa and the Peters. And Pete’s only a freshman. He’s going to be amazing as a senior, so much better than I am.  Shield is really lucky to have these guys.” He knocked Sam on the shoulder as he said it and Sam pretended to take a fall, staggering like Steve had really pushed him, then saluting him jokingly.
In his head he heard a light stirring. Imagined Tony waking up to look at him curiously. Imagined them on the ship the night of the storm, Tony in front of him in his suit, lips soft and supple, begging Steve to take them. He felt a smile creep across his face as he moved forward, centimeters away from the mechanic’s face.
“I found a first aid kid... it was full of water, so I am not sure how sterile it is. But we can try. There are butterfly sutures in it, some triple antibiotic ointment and some pain killers. Here, take them.” He handed Tony a small packet of Tylenol.
The other Avengers smiled through the hole they had made towards Steve. Until they saw Steve’s expression and the still man within his arms. This made the group collectively move fast. Clint came down first, separating the two of them despite Steve’s objections. He pulled them apart and laid Tony down flat on his back to evaluate his condition.
feelings and about how he wanted Tony too. About how they were a team, colleagues, but that they could make it work. Steve knew he loved him that much… if they made it through this, they could make it through anything.
They were taking turns torturing the two of them. Which Tony decided may actually be more torturous for him than physical torture. He couldn’t stand the mental images running through his mind: Steve getting beaten, Steve getting cut, Steve with a broken arm. His heart, beating rapidly, felt like it was going to fall out of his chest. So, he took a chance and cried out again. Cried out anything coming to his mind.
Making sure they had their keycards for access and phones in their pockets, both men left the room with JARVIS bidding them adieu. Tony flipped off the ceiling in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony, in his own mind, admitted that it was a reasonable use of their apparent free time now that following Patricia and Michael off the ship was out of the question.
Tony, eyes on Steve, nodded slowly as if in a trance. Guilt for having caused lover’s pain and a potentially fatal wound washed over him. His eyes became half-lidded and he looked to his other side, away from both men.
“It’s okay Tony, I’m here. I’m-I’m not going to leave you. Listen to my voice and come back to me…” Steve’s eyes welled up as he stared at Tony, broken and bruised and dripping blood, semen, and god knows what else.
Steve stopped, flashlight still beaming into the occupied corner.
“Let’s have J order some dinner and we can talk about what’s been going on with you.”
“Not quite. My feet aren’t bound and that’s about the only positive with how I’m strung up… which is saying something because you know how kinky I am.” Another exasperated sigh from Steve. “My arms are chained from the ceiling. That’s it. I can stand or kneel, but the kneeling takes a toll on my shoulders.”
Slowly, he felt Hammer’s hand slide ticklingly down his arm and then run across his wounded side. He bristled at the touch, both from nervous anticipation and from pain. Lips began to nibble at his sore neck and collarbone and Hammer’s tongue left trails of cold saliva across his bare nipples.
Something began stirring in the bushes to his left, and Tony found his head stiffly turning to see what it was, but not really caring.
“Tony,” a voice said calmly. Tony felt a stirring in his brain but was too tired, too relaxed, to respond.
“MY DICK IS TOUCHING YOUR FUCKING TIT. PUT ME DOWN!”
Steve nodded, setting his lips in a thin line, and walked away. Thought he didn’t trust that Tony would be alright and, despite their altercations, sat on a nearby rock, facing away from the mechanic.
“You’re right. I really am sorry.” Although his face conveyed no remorse, Michael turned to Patricia and grabbed both of her hands gently. “Patti…dear… I’m sorry.”
Good thing this was his internal monologue because Steve definitely would have scolded him for his stream of expletives.
“What in the horsefeathers…?”
Steve dived, covered Tony’s body with his own, care thrown to the wind.
Steve squeezed the metal piece into his chest. At first all he could see behind his eyelids was a soft blue light. He thought maybe he had died from stress or shock and was finally meeting the good Lord above, but lid by lid he opened his left and then his right eye and saw a glowing orb in his lap.
“I really wanted to go…” Steve said woefully and quietly, as if in a trance.
The lady looked frantically at them. She had deep golden hair that was pinned up to the cowlick on the front left of her head and she possessed very pointed features set within tanned skin. “Oh my goodness, I am so, so sorry. Please let me grab a napkin-“ The woman was cut off by a greased-up man approaching her and grabbing her wrist, too tightly for Steve’s liking.
“What. The. Fuck.
As the Avengers prepared for their battle, Scar had sauntered inside Cruella’s Café, feet popping as he walked along the mottled, plastic floor. After his caramel macchiato, Scar was affronted by Captain America, shield at ready.
He couldn’t really help himself from getting excited again. The ship had been nice and overwhelming, but he had never been to the Bahamas before. Tony had always freely offered the Avengers access to his private beach homes in Hawaii, the Bahamas, and Fiji, but Steve had never taken him up on any of them. The soldier often found himself too busy with avenging for frivolous vacations, however, because this was a mission in conjunction with a tour of a beautiful set of islands, Steve thought he might let himself enjoy the beauty of the port.
“I’ll have you know I had many friends that were not heterosexual before I went into the ice.”
The men stopped, the middle one cracking his knuckles and smiling. They stood there, staring eye to eye for several uncomfortable seconds.
They kept the men together, otherwise Steve would start making a ruckus by kicking and screaming bloody murder. He had held onto the other man for 5 days total, caring for him, worrying about him. Now that they were out of the crumbling Hell, Steve wasn’t about to let him die.
Steve reached out gentle finger tips and brushed Tony’s hair from his head wound and eyes. Tony leaned into his touch and kissed his palm.

“I told you that you could ride it… feel the thrum of it beneath you..” if he hadn’t been so ticked at his shortcoming, the breathiness of Steve’s deepening voice would have stirred something in his pants. As it was, it was still stirring, but bitterly. He felt himself harden and shifted his hands in his pockets to hide his excitement.
Steve had held his hand the whole time. Just as he was now and just as he would continue doing until Tony finally woke up.
Steve noticed the covers pulling down on Tony’s chest. The dark hair that curled along his breastbone and the adorable freckles that dotted his pecs like constellations. Steve wanted to trace them. Found himself tracing them as Tony’s hacking slowed.
Before Steve could respond, Tony had stridden out of the room, head hanging.
, but no shame if I was you know. No need to make a big scene.” It was all overly defensive and Tony settled back into his chair with a satisfied smirk on his face. He shifted slightly since there was a bit of excitement stirring in his swim trunks; both at the beauty of Alphonse and Steve’s obvious jealousy.
Across from Tony’s sat an additional cloth pallet. Steve strode over to it and laid down, sighing with exhaustion. He shouldn’t sleep. He should keep watch. It was his responsibility. But he couldn’t help the tugging at his eyelids. Just for a few minutes.
“Yeah, Tony…
He felt a little hopeless, going back empty handed, but knew he could try to make something to catch evaporated water from, or wait until it rained again. At least he himself could wait, he thought… he wasn’t sure that Tony could make it much longer without water in his feverish state.
“Oh yeah, Tony, because we ALL know that you are a PRUDE!” Steve flung Tony over his shoulder and held him still by grasping him tightly; Tony banged on Steve’s back like a resistant damsel in distress.
Hammer rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry Tones… you have plenty of horrors to face before I make you sit through a Captain America ass fisting. Maybe you’ll just be a little Tony shell by that time and not even notice.”
Billie was the boulder in the corner by Tony. Billie was yet another reason why Steve thought he might be going crazy; he named a boulder and often talked to him like he would an old friend. Reminiscing of the past. Talking about Tony. Looking forward to a future where he would be saved by his teams. Billie never responded… he was a good listener.
“I knew you would, Tony.”
He swallowed, sweat dripping down his Adam’s apple, as he stared Tony down, glancing repeatedly between the embarrassed brown eyes and their owner’s cock.
“Honey please… please don’t make me watch this… wake up…
They had reached the outside of their room. Steve slid his key-card into the door, propping the solid wood open with his hand as he motioned for Tony to go in first. “
“If I wasn’t going to die, I would name you…but hopefully I will be gone by morning little buddy…”
“I am going to kill you.... and then I am going to kill Captain Rogers... and then Kang is going to kill all of the Avengers... think about it Mister Stark... think about your precious Captain bleeding from his eyes as I crush his throat... his face is purple and swollen just like those bodies on the beach. I will
“Do not…
Tony’s eyes began to water as his breathing quickened. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and his good hand began to shake as it reached for its left sided match.
“I told you Stark. Nothing will beat this bike. No fancy new-fangled car is going to beat the finesse and speed of a motorcycle.” Steve’s blonde hair glistened with his hair gel, the scent of which wafted to Tony’s nose. Would’ve smelled good, maybe even been a turn on, had Tony not been utterly pissed right now.
Tony woke with a start, breathing heavily and with sweat beaded up in the worry lines on his tan forehead. The house was empty besides him, the norm now that he had become Iron Man. Rarely did he bring women or men to his Malibu home anymore now that they could be considered collateral. He tried to minimize the people that died because of him… this desire never turned out quite like he wanted though. People always died because of him and the guilt weighed heavily on his shoulders.
The concrete blocks fell all around them, covering their immediate area. Somehow, by some miracle, the stones failed to hit them. Instead they made a small enclosure, trapping both men in an even smaller area than they were in before, one where they could barely move without hitting stone slabs beside them.
He shook, extremities tingling and eyelids threatening to spill the tears that they held back. Biting his lip, he rode the anxiety out, waiting until only his light sniffles and the slight ringing of the jarred chains filled the sparsity of the room.
Steve pulled away, leaving Tony with his eyes closed and speechless.
Tony’s eyes were opened a little wider and he felt the strain as he tried to determine if he knew the figure just by its size and shape. After some time, he came to the realization of who it was and as the figure let out a defeated sigh, Tony’s heart dropped in confirmation.
“It made me mad.”
Tony didn’t look at him, waiting for Steve to finish a statement that was already finished in Steve’s mind. A moment’s pause, “Soooo…. Seth?”
“Should I go help him?” Tony felt a little guilty for his laziness the last few weeks but was also secretly enjoying watching the super soldier work.
Steve slowed down, let go of the tie, and rubbed circles along Tony’s back. His breathing slowed. Everything slowed. Tony’s body was blown from three full orgasms and he found himself stumbling forward toward his knees. Steve caught him around the waist, pulling his dick from Tony’s ass with a suctioning sound that was appeasing to both of the spent men. The weight of Steve’s arm around his abs, forced Steve’s semen, once loaded into his ass, to spill out, down his perineum and sheath and drip-dropping to the ground in a puddle.
Eventually, despite Steve’s stops, the two men made their way through the grand corridors. The entrance was decorated with chandeliers, ornate carpeting, and twisted craftsman wood. It was nice. It wasn’t really Tony’s style, but he didn’t mind it. He preferred modern and high-tech versus the traditional Jack and Rose,
- keep the bickering at bay until-
If they did get out of here, Steve had no idea how to help Tony or if he would ever even recover…
Spit was congealed on his eye now and he had not a hand or arm to wipe it away. The vision in the spitty eye was blurred, so Tony closed it, and then decided that maybe if he tried hard and if he closed both eyes, he could imagine that this was Steve instead. Steve making love to him instead of raping him.
“You look familiar, little man…” The man in the middle of the three bent down slightly to look the supersoldier in the eyes. Steve raised a brow.
A yellow stream of light came from the mechanic’s wrist and shot into the metal door, causing molten sludge to begin falling off in chunks as the iron was super-heated. Tony moved his arm tirelessly and pretty soon there was a bright orange circle implanted into the door; the metal circle fell with a thud onto the stone floor beneath it.
Tony cried, tears staining the dirt beneath him and pushed himself up with his good arm. “Steve...” he swallowed between gasps.
“Of course!” The man threw Tony’s leg upwards with such strength that Tony’s limp form came into view over the cement railing.
Finally, movement flushed through Steve’s muscles and he sprinted across what little room stood between him and his lover. He eyed the wound and noted that it didn’t have an exit; the bullet would still be inside Tony’s abdomen. The size of the entry was small, but blood poured from it never-the-less.
It was soon after that he had felt his body drop to the black tar, metal screeching against the rough surface; Iron Man would definitely need a buffing and paint job after this. The last thing he saw was Cap trying to push himself up but failing and subsequently falling into a blue and red mass among a sea of black.
“Yeah...” Steve rubbed his nose with his arm and stood. “Let’s get this done Tony. The medicine should have had enough time to kick in as much as it’s going to.” He hoped Tony passed out and didn’t have to worry about it, but he felt like the mechanic wasn’t going to be that lucky.
The room was large enough to hold each of the founding Avengers, plus Sam Wilson, Vision, and Wanda, for an impromptu meeting that Steve had summoned everyone to.
“I’ll take your feedback into consideration, Schnookums…”
Steve stared at the smaller man for a moment while planning his next course of action. He needed paper and a pen to develop a plan, but all his stuff was lost in the shipwreck and probably at the bottom of the ocean. So, he decided upon the next best thing.
morning since it’s after midnight?” Sam pursed his lips. The Captain sighed, brushed a hand along the back of his own neck, and exasperatedly smiled at him.
The genius’s blue eyes were intoxicating, and Steve found himself lost in them for a moment. The moment was over as soon as he smelled the liquor on Tony’s breath.
Tony woke up a few hours later and, emotions dampened, he sat up. Staring blankly at the now setting sun in the horizon. It was beautiful. He thought that this would be a good way to die, staring at this sunset. He willed himself to kill over right now but found himself continuing to breathe. He looked down at his throbbing body that was itching from the sand caked onto it and wondered what he should do. He was a genius, but the shock and dehydration had worn his mind down to nothing. He was at a loss.
“There are three breaks… one on the radius and two on the ulna. Fortunately it seems like they are clean breaks, Tony. This isn’t going to feel good though…”
Alarmed, Tony shot around to face the person speaking to him; sweat flung off the tendrils of hair that hung from his forehead. He raised his good fist defensively, before noting that the other person was only Steve. And that Steve was…. Spooning him?
I am SO SORRY that this took so long. I will be updating regularly from here on out. Warning: this chapter is pretty uneventful, but has some humorous parts to it. Next chapter will have some surprises in store for our boys and more whump, ie. Steve trying to fix Tony.
“Tony, I will be right back.”
“Tony!” Hammer said, drawn out and overtly joyous. “Buddy! Looking good. Ready for round two?”
He let out a happy sigh and couldn’t help but smile as he strolled up to a winding ramp that went to the main deck of the boat. Tony was following his footsteps, a soft expression on his face, as he watched Steve stop and admire the ship. He smiled right along with the larger man.
“What is a kitten doing here?” He croaked and looked at it with softened eyes. It was small, around three months, and mewed softly in response to him before hissing and causing Tony to drop it in his lap.
“We have to get this off you, buddy.” Steve slipped his hands under the metal framing of the table and lifted. It was a heavy son of a bitch and he determined he would have to put in more effort than normal to lift it. Taking a deep, searing breath, he lifted, ignoring whatever was splintering across his chest and into his lungs. Tony helped despite his anxiety, assisting by pushing the table towards Steve’s direction.
“Please gentleman, let me buy you both a drink. We can talk and hopefully, I can start to correct the impression you have made of me.”
“Woah Hubby… ordering for me now huh?” The three shots had affected Tony a little, but the man still had his wits about him.
The tension was awkward, angry, and sad. Neither man liked it, but both were too stubborn to talk about it. Instead, Billie became their therapist. In Tony’s mind, the boulder wasn’t that much different than a real therapist; both parties had stoic faces and shitty senses of humor
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, lifted, and, despite Tony’s raspy protests, drug him back to his station by the gauntlet.
Water was seeping quickly along the slope. With the speed that the water was moving, it would be about two minutes before the torture chamber that Tony was in would be full of the ocean.
He wished that they had at least set his legs back down to the floor so that his weight wasn’t being supported solely by his joints connected to the chains. His bones ached, his joints burned, and any point that Hammer had contacted with his stupid, fucking mallet felt like it was on fire.
The mechanic waved his hands as he gathered his senses post-fall and subsequently screamed at the man blocking his way.
“They’ll live.”
signaling a new e-mail in Tony’s inbox. Finally, Tony sighed and looked up at Steve’s determined blue eyes.
They got to the suite door, and Tony pulled his keycard out, deactivating the metal bolt in the door. He hit it open with a kick and attempted to walk through, but Steve still had a hold on his waist. They both tried to go through the door at the same time and subsequently got stuck. They faced one another, chests touching and faces close.
During the wait for the arrival of their food, they made up various stories about Seth and Antione’s past, including many skiing trips in Aspen, a beautiful evening in Paris, the time that five of Antione’s ex-lovers had shown up at a charity gala, and the drama that had ensued.
The stick walls were now lined with chunks of metal and clothes and there were palm leaves covering the whole of the encampment except the center where the fire’s flames would lick out of.
Steve heard the metal hitting the flesh before he smelled it. He could hear it sizzling, even from his distance, and he couldn’t help but squeeze his eyes shut and hold his breath.
He heard the faint call of his name and felt a new determination to get up and get back to the door. Hormonal energy surged through his body and he forced his way outside into the hallway.
Steve pressed his eyes shut momentarily at the thought, hands shaking.
“Just… stop. Stop looking at me like that…
“You guys can keep fighting. I am going into the tunnel and will take out a few of the beret-wearing suckers early-on.”
He shook his head in confusion, trying to clear his muddled mind.
“I mean, after everything that I’ve been through, I wouldn’t rule out the occult. There is a God that leads the good, so it is likely that there is a big bad leading the bad and that sometimes, those bad things come to this world.”
He covered the boulder’s face with a towel from their stash.
“I- I love you too…”
Mr. Likart was in the corner by the sewing machine. There was a reason for the disarray of sewing materials. His arm was twisted above his head in an unnatural fashion, fingers tied to the machine by the needle that penetrated them. Blood spider webbed its way down his arm. His neck was spun around like something from a horror movie and mouth wide open in shock, jaw gaping in a way that looked forced. His eyes were open, but orbitals missing, as blood dripped its way like tears down his cheeks. There were multiple pictures depicting his slaughter. Each one performed the difficult task of making Tony Stark shake with terror.
Steve corrected himself.
“And here I thought you were a prude… but you want to go see naked people in the pool. Pfft.” Tony jabbed.
” The sass came through effectively as Steve rolled his eyes.
He leaned his head into his hands and massaged his temples slowly, a dull ache settling in behind his eyes. He was sitting on a crumbled piece of concrete right next to Tony. The genius was crying in his sleep, pain written on his features.
One of the girl’s arms was outstretched into the dark and Steve trailed the flashlight along the pale stick-like apparatus until he saw, one by one, eight bony fingers grasping a humanoid neck. Two of her fingers dug into their upper cheeks, blood pooling from the stabbed flesh.
Tony stopped chewing and popped his sunglasses down past the bone of his nose. His eyes narrowed as Steve stood from his resting spot and sauntered over to Tony.
“Tonese. Is the language. It’s highly complicated. No wonder you don’t understand.” Tony elbowed Steve in the ribs and then slipped his hand and wrist through Steve’s arm, dragging him to their room’s bar. “Three shots. Let’s go.”
“Can’t you two-
. In the depths of his soul, Tony was secretly grateful for the rock; while it seemed to make him insane, it also kept him sane in a way, he supposed. Without Steve to talk to, he needed somebody. Even a giant fucking rock.
It had been one week since their escape and the surgery that had saved Tony’s physical body; Steve had barely left his side, only leaving to shower, eat minimal amounts of food, and use the bathroom. Tony had yet to wake up, although admittedly the doctors had been placing him on a heavy sedative since his dire reactions during surgery.
“Maybe he’s mad because you yelled at him.”
It wasn’t often that Captain America found himself overwhelmed… but he was now. He was overwhelmed by the complexity of the cruise ship and felt himself getting excited as if this was an actual vacation.
The gauze bandage was then removed to reveal flaming red skin with capillaries spidering from the bullet entry point. The nurses shook their heads (to Steve’s embarrassment and worry), cleaned the wound with a saline solution, and reapplied bandaging until further medical attention could be allocated to him.
Clint slumped back into his wheelchair and contemplated rolling out of the room, instead settling for another sip of coffee to avoid any unnecessary, middle-of-the-night drama. Bruce nodded in understanding, seemingly relieved.
<3 Tonee
The sun was setting again and were it not for the large fire burning before him, Tony would’ve felt the cold settling into his bones. Instead he felt unease and anxiety worming its way through his skeleton.
he laughed deliriously and blinked at the bushes until a small sound emanated out.
In frustration, Steve chucked the sticks across the campsite and fell to his knees. Normally so composed, he found himself breaking slowly. Dehydration stole his tears, so he just balled up his fists and squeezed his eyes shut.
God stay with me…”
“I’ll be back.” Steve turned and walked out of the encampment.
“Tony, no no no, please, you have to keep fighting, I’m going to get you help, okay?”
In order to set Steve free, they both needed to be near each other. This was the hardest part of the equation, but their bond was still present, though weak. He had to work fast before Rothbart broke the bond between, but he only had one chance, so there was no room for error. He schemed, calculated, and thought, and in the end, there was nothing left to do but act.
“Are you all right?” the stranger asked.
“Rothbart!” he roared, and surged to his feet.
“Wha- where’s Barnes?” Tony asked. He sounded breathless and nervous to his own ears.
“Oh, Tony,” Obie said. Obie was the King’s advisor, and had been in the castle since the queen, Maria, had died. “There you are. I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
“Aye, friend Tony. Take care, and we can all go to sushi again.”
“Obie,” Tony greeted. “How are you enjoying the party?”
The man sighed. Was this really the legendary Steve Rogers? Or was it some desperate bid by his brain to keep him from killing himself? Tony was reeling. The chest was pretty real-like, though.
“There was what?” Tony asked breathlessly.
Tony hummed, and it sounded relieved to Steve, or maybe he was just projecting. Making sure to stay in Tony’s line of vision the whole way, he went over to the door.
In that instant, Tony noticed something. A slight hesitation, a fraction of a pause, a twitched eyebrow. Something infinitesimally small in Stane’s mannerism, but something that wouldn’t have been there if he hadn’t been guilty. Tony saw it, and felt sure.
The door slammed shut.
Who wants people?”
It was a nice feeling, to protect something.
Tony flinched. He grit his teeth and breathed through the pain, the way he had learned a long time ago. “I know, but—”
Tony was lying on the floor, but Steve couldn’t go check on him just yet. This monster was quickly and dangerous, and it would take only a moment to incapacitate Steve as well. Steve waited a second, watching the prone monster. It wasn’t moving. He approached it slowly, body coiled tight, ready to leap away at the slightest twitch. The body convulsed, the stinger swinging, and Steve stopped, ready. It didn’t get up. He approached again, still cautious. When he was within range, he swung, angling for the sharp part of the shield, and chopped the thing’s head off, then sprung out of range again before the stinger could decide to move anymore. Steve watched a bit more, just to be extra sure. (One of the previous monsters, a particularly vicious one that had the body of a hyena with too many teeth and a too big jaw, had been killed in a square. When they turned their backs on it, it had started attacking civilians.)
Steve frowned, but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t get the idea out of his head. Still, Tony had a point. Just because they could make horrible monsters, didn’t mean they were competent.
“Sunset, finally!” Tony said.
“You’re free now,” Tony murmured, too weak to speak any louder. Steve was shaking his head, but Tony didn’t know why. He was now free to go back to protecting America just like he used to, or spending the rest of his life in retirement, if that was what he wanted. This was his happy ending.
“Sunset!” He shouted, and ran after them. Just as he turned the corner, a car went zooming past, and he just caught a glance of Sunset in the passenger seat. She was laughing.
Just when he was wondering whether he should stop or else lose his voice for the next few days, he heard something coming from outside. Not wanting to startle Tony, Steve just lowered his voice enough for Tony to hear and lowered him to the ground behind a computer server, out of sight from the door. Tony’s eyes stayed trained on him. Steve grabbed his shield, and placed himself between Tony and the door. He stopped singing entirely, but he put his free hand on Tony’s arm, just so he would be reassured that Steve wasn’t going anywhere. With his enhanced hearing, he listened closely to what was coming from outside. It sounded like… footsteps? Human footsteps, at least, and from more than one person. It was either his teammates here to rescue him, or the scientists, who didn’t pose much of a threat. Still, an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure, as his mother used to say.
Tony put his hands down on the dresser. There was something wrong with him, he suspected. Some deep, gaping emptiness where his heart should be. That must be why no one ever stayed, or seemed to want to be with him. Before that had been Tiberius, who had just been using him for the attention from the press, and now…
Tony waved his hand. “Don't worry so much, darling! The world is full of incompetents, and we finally get to fight them for a change,” he said. “Much nicer than dealing with the hulk, wouldn’t you agree? They remind me of myself when I was a kid; once a toy stopped interesting me, I threw it at someone else to deal with. Or used its parts in my latest toy robot, whichever came first. What I’m trying to say is, I’m not surprised they haven’t got a fully defended headquarters.”
Steve noticed that Tony’s breathing had gone from hyperventilating to elevated, and he breathed a sigh of relief. But they were still alone in this dark, hostile room, with nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. Steve felt a deep, burning embarrassment at the thought that he had just sung for Tony. Tony wasn’t saying anything now, but what about later? Would he laugh, and tell the team about Steve’s out-of-practice voice, and the tune he couldn’t carry in a bucket? Steve shook himself. Whatever happened, happened, and there was no point in torturing Tony over something he hadn’t even done yet. No matter what happened next, Tony was now looking at him with big, hopeful eyes, and Steve just wanted him to not be afraid. To know that Steve would protect him, no matter what.
“Sunset Bain. Ring a bell? She’s the woman around whose finger you’ve recently been wrapped around. Now she’s running around with the ability to speak with full royal authority, because you,” the King speared the air in front of Tony, hard enough for Tony to feel it, “couldn’t keep it in your pants.”
“Ready?” The King asked. Tony nodded, and put on his press smile.
Tony sighed and turned back to the bed. There was nothing else for him to do.
Obie took his hand off, and continued to the rail of the balcony, Barnes right behind. Tony stood there for a moment, hands clenched. He was vibrating, coming apart at the seams. Would he explode and take out everything around him, or would he simply crumble into himself, bones collapsing and arteries spilling everywhere?
Sunset betrayed him.
“Iron Man!” Steve shouted, and the world seemed to close in on him, until he was unaware of anything else but Tony Stark.
“You happened, that’s what,” the King snapped. He made his way towards the big work table in the middle. “Can’t think with your brain, can you? Always thinking with your dick. Did she promise you a suck if you gave her what she wanted? I hope she was a good lay, son, because you’ve just royally fucked us over.”
Steve just shook his head dumbly.
“How could you say that?” the man whispered. He was stroking Tony’s hair, and holding him carefully, like he fucking cared, and Tony had no idea what to do.
“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve crouched down and put a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony’s face was slack, his mouth hanging open, and his eyes wide. He was staring at the debris like it was the most dangerous thing he had ever seen. Well, it would have been pretty bad if it had landed on his face, but why hadn’t he moved to protect himself? Put his hands in front of his face or rolled away?
It looked him right in the eyes, and Tony stared back. He had never seen a swan that looked at him so intensely before. It was like it wanted to tell him something. Like it knew him. It happened while he was staring. Wings elongated, body became bigger… The transformation was over so fast, Tony almost couldn’t believe he had seen it, but there he stood. Where a swan had stood in front of him just a second ago, now stood a man.
When MODOK had opened his eyes and made that barrier between them, Steve's heart had sunk, and nothing but his strict training had kept him from fully panicking.
Tony let himself be tugged a few steps, and then hesitated and looked back at the ball room. “Sunset, please, just  tell me…”
They were both too late.
It was the night of the full moon when he was first woken up by this. He can’t remember the contents of the dream well enough to make any kind of guess as to what’s going on.
, Tony was in
Tony looks around him and sees his room in the royal quarters. His heart is racing and his breath is coming painfully fast, but the dream is falling away like water through a sieve.
Tony shook himself. No, this is Sunset, he told himself. She wouldn’t betray him like that. They loved each other so much and were going to get married. (Tony day dreamed about running away to some place where he wasn’t crown prince, but that was just foolish, of course.) Sunset was such a good, brilliant person, Tony was sure she had a reasonable explanation for this.
“Tony, get out of here!” Steve shouted.
“Well, son, I think we can agree now that you shouldn’t choose your own partner.”
“There's no bridal suite
Steve’s left arm was limp, and he was covered in gashes, but he spared a glance at Tony. There was a pause in the motion. Then, Steve sidestepped a blow, barreled straight into Tony and his captor, and they all went down.
Of course, the moment Barnes walked into the room was the moment that everything went to hell in a handbasket.
Complete for us to
“Stop it,” he said half-heartedly. He pushed, but met the expected resistance.
Tony tried to take comfort in the little talisman he had kept from Steve, but looking at it now, it was just a feather. Could he have made the whole thing up? Was it possible it had all just been a delusion?
Barnes lifted one cultured eyebrow, and Tony’s heart sank. “Stop me from doing what?”
Steve watched, as if in slow motion, as the reactor was twisted, pulled, yanked out of Tony’s chest, and Steve thought about delicate wires, phones that broke because they fell a few feet onto the floor, CDs that cracked if you held them too hard.
Sunset betrayed him.
Suddenly, Sunset was kissing him, warm and tender. Tony tried to pull away to say something, but she held him in place for a few moments longer. When Sunset pulled back, Tony was breathing heavily. “Tony, I love you so much. Please, trust me.”
“J, start up my music again? Dum-E, put that in the discard pile.”
To:  A-Team
was colored by a somewhat benevolent amusement.
“You’re leaving?” she asked, eyebrow raised just slightly.
“Steve, you going all 40s on us?” Tony couldn’t help asking.  He’d never seen Steve wearing that hat.  He usually stuck to baseball caps when he wore a hat at all.  Not that Tony had noticed.
Just as he wondered where the phone was—was he supposed to use his own phone? It still flipped open and was so old he wasn’t sure how many more times he could get it to power on.  Was that secure?—Happy trudged up the stairs.
And now he knew, anyway. He knew exactly what Steve had never been.  That this body was all a sham anyway. That the muscles came out of Howard’s lab, that Steve was masquerading in this body. That the real Steve was tiny, a sickly twig, who never caught anyone’s eye. Who Tony would never have looked at twice. Even if he had been interested in men.  In Steve. There had been rumors, back when Tony was younger, before Afghanistan.  But it had been years since those, and Steve obviously knew just how wrong the press had been.
“Mr. Stark, I’m so happy to see you here,” the slimeball wheezed out.
Tony sighs.
author knows nothing about art or motorcycles or science
Peggy huffed irritably.
Tony reached out, his fingertips still tingling from the feeling of Steve’s lips, resting them resolutely against Steve’s warm mouth, lightly dragging it down to him, licking his lips, his breath shaky, other hand gently tracing the line of Steve’s neck.
Tony wasn’t really listening , trying to keep working on the ultraglass and fight his reflex to say yes to Steve.
Steve grimaced inwardly.  Not the problem, actually, this time.  “No, he didn’t. This one’s on me. It’s fine.”
Once he ended the call, Tony let the reality of everything hit him.  He looked down. The reactor was dying, truly.  The inner core could barely light up one of the leaves of the outer circle. Well, the situation was dire.  He’d always known that.  Since he’d blown his way out of the cave in Afghanistan, he knew he was living on borrowed time.  Now that time was coming due.
He stepped out into the light of a hundred flashing bulbs.
“Now, Tony, calm down…”
“Tony, stop making a fool out of all of us,” the King growled.
Nothing. Finally satisfied, Steve moved to the next priority item: Tony, who had not assisted, nor shown any signs of movement since he had been stung.
Tony looked her in the eyes, and his heart melted. What was he doing, distrusting his own girlfriend like this? Surely, if she said she could explain herself, she would. Tony nodded, and followed her to the door.
“I used a lock of your hair in a spell. I didn’t know it was yours. I thought it was Rothbart’s. Instead of setting me free, it gave some of the ownership to you.” Steve reached out and held Tony’s hands in his own, and Tony felt the touch travel up his nerve endings, all the way down his spine. “We’re linked now, you and I.”
Steve grit his teeth. Their
“There's a small hotel,
Halfway through the story, the door to the workshop banged open.
Maybe eye contact was a bad idea. Steve’s eyes gave Tony vertigo. They made it a bit difficult to think. Tony closed his eyes and rallied his senses, and tried again. He stepped away so they could have a face-to-face conversation like normal people. He opened his eyes.
Tony cried out and reached for the raccoon, but it had already leaped away from him. Steve lunged for it, but it scurried away. He was ready, though. Using instinct and calculations that ran as fast as any computer, he timed his lunge perfectly, so he landed near his abandoned shield, picked it up, and threw it much further than he had calculated last time. It slammed directly in front of the monster, which flinched, drawing up. Steve was already jumping, spinning, and landing with the full force of his body behind his kick to its back. (Why hadn’t Tony gotten up yet?) He kicked its face, side-stepped out of the way of its stinger, which allowed him to grab his rebounding shield mid-air. He let the momentum of the flying shield carry, so he spun it around onto the monster’s face.
“But… but you deserve a happily ever after,” Tony protested.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, I was just talking to Sir Barnes just now. That young man is very intelligent, you should have heard what he had to say about the current political situation of our country, and how a democracy would ruin all of us. It’s insane what people are saying nowadays, about becoming a democratic government, but Sir Barnes had the perfect responses for them. You could take him as an example, son. You never seem to have any idea what’s going on outside of your own workshop. Maybe if you poked your head out once, you’d see some of the things that are going on.”
“Steve?”
Three people were in the room. Tony took out one with sharp punch under his jaw, and the other two Steve got with one throw of his shield. Steve caught the shield on the rebound, and that was that.
, Steve caught himself humming.
He had to try something.
“...so I’m going to need you to attend galas in his place, okay?” It was Obie. He walked through the doors and slipped something in his hand into his pocket. He was talking to another man next to him, who was quite good looking, with unusually long hair and lovely eyes. “We’re going to need someone who understands the complex political situation, so you’ll understand if something is amiss. If we can get it back without anyone knowing, that would be the best case scenario...”
This is what I'd say to you:
“No!” Stane shouted.
“Ah, but they can’t disobey me anymore than you could before that whole debacle happened. And after tonight, you’ll be under my control once again. Now, let’s get this over with before anyone catches wind of this shall we?” Stane snapped his fingers.
The machinery was pulled out of Tony, leaving behind a gaping hole in his chest. Steve was trying desperately not to flashback to the war, and the holes that were left in people’s bodies, and the survival rate of those people. Steve could taste bile at the back of his throat, a bitter taste, and shoved it down roughly. Now was not the time to throw up.
Good morning, heartache, what's new?
Tony dumbly nodded, too stunned to say anything. Then, he jolted out of the man’s arms, shook himself off, and turned to him. “What the fuck was that?” He demanded. “You were an actual swan just… five seconds ago, how could … am I dead? Is this death? I thought it would either be really nice or really horrible, but this is just turning into a strange fever dream, and I don’t really understand—”
He unbuttoned his shirt with hands that felt like lead, and wondered where on earth his energy had gone. It hadn’t been that taxing of a day, right? He had just been played like the world’s biggest fool.
“Okay.” Tony noticed that Sunset was leading them along the side of the room where less would see them, keeping in the shadows where possible, but he decided not to comment.
Suicidal, he overheard them say. Severe depressive episode. Non-verbal.
“No, I know that you’ve been lying all this time. To us. To father. To me.” Obie made as if to walk away, but Tony stepped in front of him.
It was just as he was walking out the doors of the palace that the answer came to him: there was a simple solution to everyone’s problems. Tony would get some rest, and everyone else would be rid of him.
But it was gone in less than a moment.
“Yes, you’ve said that.” Tony could appreciate being smashed up against a warm chest, but he was starting to think that eye-contact might be important here. He leaned his head back so he could look the alleged Steve Rogers in the eyes. Steve stopped patting his head, which was a loss Tony felt keenly, and loosened his hold, but didn’t let go. That was a plus.
Steve couldn’t help but think about the times he used to hang out with Tony in his lab, back in the good old days. He would go to find some peace and quiet, because living anywhere Hulk and Thor frequented was always going to be stressful. Steve would read or sketch, and the two of them would start off chatting about everything and anything, possible strategies and training simulations for the team, or what groceries needed to be bought. Then the talk would peter out as Tony became more and more engrossed in his own work. Steve would pretend to draw (he did draw sometimes, honest) and watch Tony at work.
That was what Steve thought as he and Tony made their way into the enemy hideout. He liked his enemies to be nice and incompetent, thank you very much, but all they got were aliens whose world-ending plans went back decades, and a superhuman Hulk who could take out eight hundred people without trying, and the Ultimates who were all that stood in their way. The ultimate people, taken down by a failed science experiment.
“Whoa, whoa, slow down there! What are you acting like I abandoned you for? I was just here yesterday.” Tony grinned and reached out to pet the bot’s support strut. Exhaustion weighed down heavily on him, and he ended up leaning heavily on Dum-E’s sturdy form. Dum-E beeped in question. “It’s fine,” he said around a yawn. God, he should clean up his workshop. He had left his books on magic out on the table where anyone could see them. They weren’t illegal or anything, but they were generally frowned upon, and his father would
Jan nodded. “So when should he be cleared for missions again?”
Tony took a deep, noisy breath.
After that, it was over quickly. Thor destroyed the door with a swing of his mighty hammer. Jan was there as well, and she called some SHIELD medics over to take a look at Tony, and then they were all whisked away to the Triskelion for a debrief.
“I just wanna look,” she had said.
Tony looked back, and found one of security guards running after them. The man startled when he realized who Tony was.
When will he get better? His father asked.
But this time it's real
Sunset put her arm in Tony’s. “I know, babe, I’m so sorry. It was just so difficult to get in touch with you with all the security measures, you know? Everyone is so quick to believe that the poor girl is the one stealing their precious things.”
