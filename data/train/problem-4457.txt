Dean's cheeks warmed. A bit of guilt creeping in on the edges of his awareness at letting someone, even Cas, take care of him. He pushed his uneasiness away at the soft concerned look on Cas's face. “Okay.”
Dean chuckled—a sound that cut off when Cas shoved him back onto the bed. He bounced on the mattress and stared up at Cas, slack jawed and so turned on at the show of strength.
It was weird that pretty much anything to do with sex he could talk about no problem. Feelings though… were messy and confusing and awkward. Strangely, though, he kind of liked it.
After a while, he finally decided maybe he should change the subject. Maybe this was too much for Cas. “So… it's almost winter, y’know. I think maybe you should stick around a while longer—so you don't freeze to death before—”
Surprising him again, Cas grinned. “I love horror movies. And honestly, I haven’t dated in long enough that I’m not even sure I remember how. I think you’re far more interesting than you give yourself credit for. It’s not a contract. If you’re uncomfortable with any of this, a no at any time is sufficient to put an end to it. And of course, your job wouldn’t be in danger no matter your response.” Cas’s face softened into a gentler smile. “I can handle rejection. Now or later. But what I’d really like is to know that should we prove compatible, you’d be receptive to the offer of a date.”
And that one memorable time that Dean’d dropped down to his knees for him after backing Castiel up against the bumper. One time only, because the concrete’d been hell on Dean's knees.
“Have some respect, Sammy. Baby’s not that kinda girl.” Dean smirked over his shoulder, and Sam chuckled before his eyes drifted to the house and turned sober.
Uh. Dean’s cheeks heated and he had to look away. “Yeah—uh, well… meditation’s not exactly a… uh, spectator sport.”
The next several slaps landed harder, and Dean moaned each time, cock throbbing. Cas’s hand smoothed over his ass in a gentle rub that burned slightly and set off sparks under Dean's skin. His senses narrowed down to the feel of Cas’s rough palm.
Part of him wants to pick Castiel up and carry him to the bed, lay him out and fuck him hard, until Castiel forgets everything other than Dean's name. The larger part, though, fucking loves that Castiel’s taking what he wants. That he's taking the lead and daring Dean to follow.
Lately, he’s leaning much further toward dread on the spectrum. It's getting harder and harder to handle the way that Castiel clearly doesn't like him.
When he came back to himself he was murmuring Dean’s name over and over in worship, still shaking with each feeble pulse of his release. For a long time Dean kept his hand locked around Cas, kissing him gently through each crest until he was an over sensitive and bone-deep satisfied mess of come and sweat that melted into the mattress.
He's read about this, but he never believed—true mates scenting each other and knowing instantly—it’s indescribable and this feels like so much more than that paltry description. His body moves on autopilot, instinct guiding him forward through the crowd and when he squeezes past the last person blocking his view, his eyes widen in shock.
“He told me his next stop was here and that I should check it out when I was done; that there were lots of good books left upstairs.”
Not once he’d gotten a taste of him… and fuck, what a taste. Sweet, pliant, and wholehearted, Dean’s inhibitions had been nonexistent in that moment and Cas could just imagine what he'd have been like if he’d really let loose. He could picture what Dean’d look like stretched out on Cas’s bed—his to do what he wanted with—how delicious it would be when Dean gave it all up for him. Like apple pie innocence and the salt-sweat taste of endless stretches of skin he hoped would be every bit as freckled as Dean's face.
Dean moaned into it, hips flexing up to press his cock insistently against Cas’s belly. The hard hot length of it ignited a fresh wave of need in Cas. He rubbed his lips along Dean’s jaw, the scrape of Dean's stubble left them tingling. “Gonna make you feel so good, Dean.”
The stuff that Cas had sent him home with was pretty damn informative. The intro to BDSM one laid out some rules about consent and safewords, checking in, things like that. It had some brief summaries about what BDSM was. Apparently not that fifty shades of bullshit housewives everywhere were reading. The stuff in this pamphlet was all about trust, mutual pleasure, and enjoyment from all parties involved. Something about that released a little bit of tension in him that Dean hadn't noticed he was carrying.
By the time Cas finally woke, Dean had given in to the call of nature and made a trip outside. He charmed his way into Ellen making him two cups of coffee even though they were rationing, and they were sitting warm on the counter when Cas slowly stretched beneath the blankets and sat up with a confused frown pulling at his expressive pink lips. Dean smiled at him.
His thrusts were fast, right off the bat, like he couldn’t help himself, like being in Dean felt good enough to shatter any control he had. And fuck it was so damn awesome.
They’d been thick as thieves all through high school, but he’d assumed they’d lost touch sometime in college like Dean had with most of his own friends. A part of Dean was glad he hadn’t, and that Sam would have some support while they were here since Eileen couldn’t make it. He was relieved that she’d decided to stay with her parents while he and Sam came back.
Cas’s fingers twined with Dean’s, and Dean finally stopped holding his breath. He finally inhaled deeply. Cas looked exhausted and wrung out. Sam was no better. Dean flung his arm around his brother’s shoulders.
Something ached in Cas's chest. “Because you remind me of someone, maybe. Because I happened across you, and I used to believe things happened for a reason. It seems like the right thing to do.”
“Yeah. You wanna take upstairs or down here?” Dean asked, nose involuntarily wrinkled. Every mildly germaphobic bone in his body practically screamed at having to go deeper into this unkempt mess. Not to mention how awful it smelled in here. Faint traces of their dad’s once familiar scent mixed with a host of disgusting smells that Dean tried not to focus too closely on identifying.
“It's nothing, Sammy.” Dean flashed him a small smile. “Just nervous and I'd rather focus on something else, okay? Why don't you tell me about your science project with Sarah?”
It didn’t take long for Sam to clomp back up the stairs and toss his duffel bag to him. Dean thanked him and took it into his room. He dropped it on the bed and unzipped it, rifling through until he found a towel. He deliberated over what he was gonna wear this afternoon before he settled on a pair of fitted black jeans and a dark blue denim shirt. Sam would probably be pissed he hadn’t actually packed anything nicer, but Dean didn’t really feel like being stuffed into a monkey suit. This was uncomfortable enough.
As Cas takes the package, and Dean fishes his phone out of his pocket, turns on the flashlight so that Cas'll be able to see what he's opening.
Some days it was a close thing, though. Close enough that Dean knew he couldn't risk anyone's safety by acting like he was normal, like he was safe to be around. So he didn't have friends, and he didn't date despite the fact that just like any other teenager he was dying to. What Dean wanted didn't matter. It would never matter ‘cause what everyone else deserved was for Dean to keep them safe from himself.
“Mhm. Anyway, just watch out because even if it doesn't have its powers, they're incredibly intelligent, and strong from what I read, so you'll still have your hands full until you bind its wrists. It won't be able to escape after that.”
Then he waited for something to happen. Some sign from Cas that he was willing to take this whole game they had going on further than flirting. Too bad Cas just stood there, rooted to the spot, ‘cause this was about as far as Dean worked himself up to in planning. He sort of expected to be pounced on by now. Here he was, pretty much offering himself up on a silver platter, and he could see Cas salivating, but he wasn’t doing a damn thing about it.
His eyes briefly locked on Sam's, then flashed to Cas, who was walking toward him, hands raised while Lilith's minions ran like the rats they were. Dean didn't let them. Righteous vengeance boiled over inside of him and he burned them all. Short lived screams echoed, but Dean was too far gone to care. His skin was too hot, his whole body on fire.
Dean chuckled, full-throated and low. “Mmm. I'm sure. C'mon.” He guided Cas to the door, a few amused whoops following them out into the night air.
A third finger pressed at Dean’s rim and after a little resistance, it slid right in beside the others. Fuck, he was so full—stretched wide around Cas’s thrusting, twisting, fingers—and it still didn’t feel like enough, wasn’t what he wanted, not really. Cas’s free hand stroked his thigh soothingly, and Dean realized with a start that he was begging Cas for more.
When he woke in the afternoon it was to Cas stroking his fingers along his back in random patterns that raised goosebumps on Dean’s skin and made his cock swell. He smiled into Cas’s warm bare chest and stretched against him, letting Cas feel exactly what he did to him.
“Okay… not joking then. So, guess it's kind of cool you already know him. Don't have to wonder if you'll ever find him, at least,” Sam said, ever the optimist, and Dean almost hated to burst his bubble. Almost.
A second later the strong bitterness in his mouth faded to a minty-citrus aftertaste, and his pinched expression relaxed.
Bitter, thick, sludge. That’s what Castiel’s coffee tastes like this morning. It’s disgusting, but he didn’t have time to stop and get a decent one, and God help him—he
He's sitting in the library with a cup of coffee that he doesn't need to drink, but the smell reminds him of Dean and it is morning. He's staring at the dark brown liquid and willing a lead to come up when loud banging starts up on the bunker's repaired door. His heart races, and his adrenaline spikes. Rushing out to see who it is, he lets his angel blade fall into his palm. Behind him, he can distantly hear Sam and Jack running out to see what's happening.
“You got that right,” Dean agreed emphatically, his stomach already twisting up in knots just thinking about what he was gonna tell Sam.
“Mmm. You like hearing that, don’t you?” There was a note of unchecked admiration in his voice. He cupped Dean’s cheek and brushed his thumb over his cheekbone. Dean’s eyes fluttered open, hazy, glossy, green. Sexy. “Can’t wait to spread you out on your bed, Dean. Taste you. Bet you taste every bit as fucking good as you smell. Been driving me crazy.”
Broadly, Sam grinned at him, “I’d ask for a redo, but I remember you kicking Gordon Walker’s ass when you were in highschool and he had like four inches on you.”
Heaving himself off the couch, Cas sauntered over to the doors and stepped out into the muggy afternoon air. His nose instantly scrunched up, body already missing the sweet coolness of his A/C. The squeak of the doors opening caught Dean's attention and he peered over at Cas, brows drawing up in question. Stepping out into the grass just to enjoy the blades tickling his bare feet, Cas frowned. They were far too hot too, curse it.
Cas let him soak until the water started to cool, and Dean just knew that he probably had a dopey ass smile on his face, but he couldn't find it in himself to give a damn right then. For the first time in a really long time, he just felt good.
“Do you want me to take it down a notch? Or stop altogether?” Cas asks, sliding his thumbs over Dean's jaw.
Two lube soaked fingers push into him moments later and Dean loves the burn of it. Twisting and scissoring, plunging deep, Cas knows just how to touch Dean, just how to make it so fucking good. Sweat’s beaded up all over him, and it drips from his skin, tickling as it rolls down his sides, down his neck. “Please, Cas, please, fuck … ah … ah, fuck me.”
Cas chews on his lip, still looking torn and Dean wishes that Cas could just read his mind and see for himself the strength of his conviction. “I just don't want you missing out on anything at school. What if you end up resenting me?”
toys, costumes possibly lingerie or maybe sexy role playing stuff, custom leather—Dean's brain stuttered and his dick chubbed up a little even as utter fucking embarrassment at his apparent stupidity curled up in his gut and set fire to his cheeks. He dropped his face into his hands, “Son of a bitch. I'm so fucking dumb.”
A shiver ran down Dean's back. Fear obviously, and nothin' else, he told himself holding Cas's stare before finally reaching down and grabbing the rope just above where it was woven around Cas's wrists. Dragging Cas forward was easier than it should've been too.
He can still recall Dean's rough-gentle hands stroking over his cheeks and through his hair the first time Castiel had admitted just how much he missed him. The way he'd soothed him with soft words and made love to him slowly in their bed, reassuring Castiel that they'd always come back together.
Dean tilted his head toward Cas. “Obviously not, I caught it didn't, I?” he asked, ignoring the gaze boring into the back of his head.
Dean’s smirk widened. “Hey, first of all, that was a classic, and second of all, you, Sammy, are a little snoop.”
The kid crossed his arms, floppy hair dripping water down in his eyes. “Who says I'm with anyone? I can take care of myself.”
Great. And now Cas wasn't even bothering to hold back. It took him a minute of laughter to calm down and wipe the tears that'd gathered at the corners of his eyes. “Dean, that's not—this is an
“I thought we could keep things simple tonight. You listed bondage as a yes. I brought bondage tape, would you like to try it?” At Dean’s nod he continued, “I was going to suggest just starting with that, but you had spanking underlined with a little note specifying an interest in trying paddles or floggers, and you’d also underlined being dominated, and dirty talk, along with a few other things.”
“Not yet,” Cas whispered back, one last brush of his lips before his hands on Dean’s hips moved him back. Their eyes locked, and Dean could drown in all that blue and black. “First let’s go over your list.”
The receptionist, a pretty brunette beta who introduced herself as Lisa, led them into the room the gathering would be held at. They’d elected to forgo a ceremony. Neither of them wanted to sit through that, and what would the preacher even say anyway? John Winchester was an alcoholic son of a bitch who died when Mary Winchester did and then kept on walking around until he drove himself into a tree. He was lucky he didn’t take anyone else out with him. Survived by his two boys—that John had stopped caring about a long time ago—he’ll be vaguely … well, not missed … sometimes remembered almost fondly if they block out the crappy years.
“I promise to be on my best behavior,” he added as he held up three fingers together, “scout’s honor.”
Everything was relatively quiet in the dark woods as Dean crept toward the spot he’d last seen the pegasus. The rope was coiled loosely around his arm, and he tried to keep his thoughts off of whether it would work or not. He’d deal with that eventuality if it came to it.
“'F that's what you want, that's fine by me. At least let us give you a good time before you go,” he added playfully.
Lost in thought, Dean finished up his breakfast and then excused himself from the table. He went back upstairs and grabbed his homework from where he'd left it on the desk in his room and stuffed it in his backpack. A huge part of him wanted to crawl back into the warmth and comfort of his bed, curl up under his navy blue blanket instead of going to school, but he couldn't so he trudged back downstairs.
The squeak of the front doors opening behind him prickled along his skin and left him hyper-aware. “Sammy?” he called out.
So he thinks of something else, he thinks of going to school to complete his degree in automotive technology. He thinks about long days spent in classes or under a car while Dean worked with Sam. The way they'd both had to adjust to being away from each other after so long spent in each other's pockets.
Dean bit his lip on a smirk as he slipped his hand all the way into Cas's underwear, curling his fingers around the hard length of him, silky skin blood-hot. He couldn't get over the feel of it, similar and yet so different to the feel of his own.
“I didn't want to leave him. I didn't… but Hannah needed me. And then she was gone too,” Cas said miserably. “So I couldn't stay in the place she died. And I had nowhere to go. And I swore I'd never let someone matter to me as much as they did. That I'd never hurt like that again.” Cas broke off, and went quiet. Dean waited for him to say more, and the minutes stretched on. He didn't know what to say.
All the way up to opening his own auto shop last year. The long days he's been pulling to get it off the ground.
The ghost scent of dishwashing liquid and floor cleaner floated to the surface of Dean’s memory. The sound of their broken vacuum cleaner that barely picked up anything, but Dean always made an effort anyway.
In the passenger seat, Sam was quiet as could be, eyes trained out his window and shoulders tense. His scent was melancholy; all mossy ozone. Dean’s was probably similar, they tended to smell a little alike especially when they were in the same mood though Sam's was underscored with the unmistakably musky scent of an alpha in contrast to Dean's omega-sweet.
Pain blossomed in Dean's chest, an ache that flared frosty and cavernous. Thickly, he swallowed and shook his head a little, couldn't quite believe it. Dad was stubborn. He didn't change his mind and he didn't make apologies. If he'd been sorry, it was probably for himself. Dean clung to that like a life raft.
“Baby, what did he do to you?” he ran his hand lovingly over the car’s hood, and softly murmured, “Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’m gonna fix you up and take you home.”
For a second it's just their breaths echoing in the sultry air that's gathering in the car, steaming it up. Cas looks over his shoulder, eyes narrowed. “Dean, if you—mmm.”
A shuddering breath out, and Dean looks at the watch again. “Elev—” he swallows, throat dry, God that's so long. “Eleven minutes.”
“Fuck, you’re sexy,” Dean pants, leaning forward to kiss and bite at Castiel’s shoulder, loving the way Castiel trembles beneath him, making his way up until his lips are right next to Castiel’s ear. “Gonna come on my knot, Cas? ‘Cause fuck, I can’t wait to feel you squeeze around me. Scream my name.”
After, when they collapsed together on the couch with Dean curled up on Cas, he let out a satisfied sigh. “Yeah,” he said, half-drunk with the mind-blowing orgasm he’d just had. “We’re absolutely doing that again. And again. For as long as you wanna.”
Sam’s face brightened a little, the same excitement he always showed whenever he was talking about magic and research. “The rope’ll glow soon as you get it on the shadowlight. It might fight for a minute or so, try to break free, but as long as you keep ahold of the rope the magic’ll kick in. The shadowlight will be forced to shift into its natural form, and won't be able to access it's magic at all."
Cas watched his fingers disappearing in and out of Dean’s stretched tight hole, entranced. Finally, he wiped his face off a little on Dean's  inner thigh and shifted up onto his knees. He kept his fingers working inside of Dean, but he couldn’t hold himself back any longer—he wrapped a hand around his own aching cock. Relief zipped along his skin and up his back as he fisted himself. Easily, Cas could've come just like this, but he slowed himself. “Look at you,” he purred, “taking it so good for me. Tight, slick ass feels so good.”
If he didn’t hurry up he’d be late. He threw off the covers and grabbed a pair of socks from his drawer, quickly yanked them on and then grabbed his sketchbook from the bed.
Dean’s cheeks burned and he rushed to his own defense, “I wasn’t—that wasn’t a pick up line. I’m looking for Castiel Novak.”
The cloudy expression on Cas’s face lightens, his lips curving into a small smile that Dean feels all the way to the tips of his toes. “Has anyone ever told you how smooth you can be?”
He flushed, and scuffed his foot. “Well, I did, but uh, it's my first time scavenging on my own, okay? My brother's here too, but I got to go off by myself and what'd I do? I went off target. But me and Jess have been dying to get new books and the library was right there and—”
It isn’t until Mr. Adler’s out of sight that Castiel finally lets a scowl curl his lips down, he keeps a tight lid on his scent, still unwilling to let anyone know just how much this bothers him. The last thing he needs is for people to start talking about how
He wondered what Dean was thinking about today. Whether he was working up the nerve to talk to him. He wracked his brain trying to think if he'd ever seen Dean talk to
There's laughter and scuffling and Castiel rolls his eyes. Dean extends a hand and Castiel takes it, letting Dean pull him to his feet.
Dean’s fingers are clenched around the handle that runs along the elevator wall, white knuckled with clear effort not to touch Castiel. “We can talk about it after,” Castiel decides, and he hits the button for what he hopes is the top floor without looking.
“It’s alright not to be.” Cas squeezed Sam’s shoulder fondly, and Sam nodded slightly, bottom lip trembling. Sympathetically, Dean’s eyes stung a bit but he blinked it away. Next thing he knew, Cas’s hand was warm on his shoulder, just like it had been on Sam’s. Solid and strong, his rich scent comforting. Support that Dean found himself drawing strength from. “What about you, Dean?”
Steam rises from Cas's freshly made coffee, floating up in a swirling white mist. Leaning back against the kitchen counter, he stares out the French doors that lead to the back of the house. It's still dark out, he can't see further than the flood light illuminating the back porch, but he knows just what it'll look like when the sun comes up.
“Mhmm,” Dean capitulated as he pulled Cas further toward him, into a bruising kiss. The sweet taste that filled his mouth was unmistakably Cas. “You always taste so good.”
The dirt pathway leading from the guard tower at the edge of Shepherd’s Bend was dimly lit with enchanted blue orbs of firelight in the dark of the night, and directly behind him, her black scales shining silver in them, was his dragon, Baby. She was seated with her tail curling around her, wings resting at her sides—only up to about Dean’s knee in height, she was large for her kind. Most dragons weren't taller than mid-calf on him. Her pale eyes were fixed on Dean, her adorable face tilted up, expectant.
“No,” Dean honest to God sobbed, “no, I don't—Cas don't make me wait, please. Want you inside me. Want you to fuck me. Please, sir, fuck me.”
You’d think that they’d all see him for what he was. They were, after all, the people who saw the most of him. They were the people who’d been there the night he’d proven just how truly broken he was, how toxic.
Besides, if Cas ever actually did try and talk to him, Dean could just do what he always did whenever the rare occasion that people tried to talk to him popped up: be boring until they left him alone again. One word answers and blank stares were always his best bets.
Was it possible to physically feel your heart being ripped from your chest? 'Cause Dean was pretty sure the agony that tore through him was exactly that. Cas looked up at him when he must have sensed Dean go rigid beneath him. He stared at Dean confused, like he didn't understand why Dean would be gutted he was planning to leave.
to be busy with a very charming young man tonight.” Balthazar smirked. “Alright, you caught me, two young men and a gorgeous scottish redhead that I’ve been dying to get in the—” at Cas’s unmoved stare, Balthazar sighed. “But no, yes, I’ll cancel those truly stunning plans to help you, as apparently I’ve become the type of person who gives up perfectly phenomenal foursomes to aid hapless teenage idiots.”
He’s reclined back against the couch, naked, and the heat in Castiel’s gaze is palpable as he takes his time looking him over. “How are you this hot?” Castiel breathes, like he’s stunned, and fire burns in Dean’s cheeks.
“Well, I'm not,” Dean promises, finally reaching up and gripping Cas’s bicep, frowning a little at the square bandage he finds there. Later though, he can ask about it later. “I'm not going anywhere. Being with you—it's different than I've ever felt with anyone. I've wanted you for so long Cas.” Dean's cheeks heat and he really wants to look away, but he makes himself focus. “I'm in this for as long as you want me.”
By the time he was ready to call it quits for now, Dean had dusted and vacuumed (with the same goddamn broken vacuum) both his and Sam’s room. He’d opened the windows to air them out and then he’d extremely grudgingly donned a pair of thick rubber gloves and tackled the bathroom.
Cas’s eyes’d gone all soft, and then he’d grabbed Dean’s face and kissed him so achingly sweet. “Are you serious? Of course I love it!”
“Hey, I'm not the one who wandered off. What’d you get up to?” he asked Baby, shaking it off and turning to face her.
All it took was a crooked smile from Dean and Cas was on him. They fucked slow and lazy, Cas sucking Dean off with torturous precision, all heat and perfect suction while Dean murmured praise. He climaxed with a rush of pleasure and kissed Cas after, tasting himself in Cas’s mouth with a tingle of renewed arousal. Dean jerked him off, pulling out all his best tricks, figuring out what Cas liked. And when Cas wrapped his hand tightly around Dean’s and guided him to a faster, snugger grip, Dean moaned into his mouth. Cas came with a quiet, choking gasp.
for one. And even if there’s something in the back of Dean’s brain pinging wildly with stories about true mates, he’s wearing blockers, he tells himself.
Grumpily, Cas glared at her, but Charlie just sat back up in the chair and bumped her shoulder against his, “So, what's up with you two? Why the sudden interest? Was it love at first sight when you gave him his backpack back?”
Sam spoke up again. “They could gift their powers. When they wanted to die they could gift them to someone so they wouldn’t be reborn from the ashes. But Dean’s never had that happen to him.” His eyes flashed to Dean. “Have you?”
The fond smirk on Cas’s face was almost enough to melt the ice that’d settled over Dean, and he smiled back like he was normal.
Hard, leaking, aching for touch, his cock jutted straight up toward his belly button, thick vein down the tan shaft of it that he thumbed along. He brushed over the dark red rim of his pink head, and then over the top.
Cas smiled back, a tiny unsure one, but he motioned Dean inside. "Excellent. I was sorry to see him go, he's done such a fantastic job for me in the past. But time marches on."
was definitely into this stuff. Examining the various paddles and floggers had him wet, and Cas had to be able to smell it. He could definitely smell Cas's arousal, and it caused every move he made to feel electrically charged.
Just briefly, he teased himself with the palm of his hand over his boxer-briefs before he got those off too. He probably looked kind of ridiculous in nothing but a pair of black socks, legs spread and bent out at the knees, but it wasn’t like anyone was there to see him anyway. Images of Dean flashed through his mind as he ran his hands up his chest, scratched his fingernails back down hard enough to leave red marks.
A rueful grin tugs at Castiel's lips. Just thinking about the way that Dean’d looked up at him then stirs a heat in Castiel's gut and burns his cheeks. This isn't the time to dwell on it though.
And there’s a lot of things Dean can take, alright? He’s a pretty tough guy … but having his true mate reject him for reasons Dean can’t figure out? Fucking stings.
His relationship with his brother was already on shaky ground though. It was only in the months after the war when Sam had moved to Shepherd's Bend that they'd really begun repairing it. The old pain of Dean leaving him behind with Bobby and Ellen when he'd signed up with the Guard at sixteen still simmered below the surface.
Dean thought grimly. It took hours, but they finally scoured the area, cleared it, and collected the dead bodies ’cause leaving them around could attract larger predators.
This was probably a bad idea, he thinks. No, it was definitely a bad idea, but when Castiel tips his head back and looks up at Dean all adoringly like that, Dean can’t find it in him to care. “Dean,” he sighs, and then his lips are on Dean’s in a sensual kiss—a jolt of pleasure sharply reminds Dean of his very, very hard cock. Castiel’s lips twitch up against his, and he grinds down onto Dean.
Lilith laughed again, somehow even crueler than before, unhinged. A shiver Dean couldn’t suppress rolled down his spine. “Half the planet, Dean? Try the
Dean’s eyes narrowed. That was a damn lie if he ever heard one. With a resigned sigh, he put the neck of bottle to his lips and tilted it up as he leaned his head back. Trying not to taste it, he swallowed mouthfuls as quickly as he could until the bottle was empty.
Downstairs his leather gloves and bracers were waiting on the table where he’d left them last night. He'd have to put them on after breakfast. Sighing, he tiredly scrubbed his hand over his jaw.
some control. If he only got to have this—to have Dean—for a little while? He was going to make it impossible for Dean to forget him when it was over.
“How do you want this, baby?” he asks, voice pitched low and rough. “Want me to jerk you off, or blow you?”
He can't speed Cas up, he can't make time turn faster—and right now, with the way Cas has him positioned he can't even
Completely confident in his nudity, Dean smiled cockily, “I know you said on the bed, but,” Dean dropped his chin and dragged his perfect white teeth over his full lower lip, as he walked forward until he was right in front of Cas. He sank down to his knees and looked up at Cas, “I really wanna,” his hands curled in the waistband of Cas's sweatpants.
were awesome,” Cas replied, instantly annoyed at himself for the adoration in his tone of voice. It was just sex, he tried to tell himself. Dean didn’t want anything more, and Cas needed to reign in his feelings if this was going to work for however long they had.
Cas grinned at him. “No, you’re not. This usually goes the other way, doesn’t it? With me flustered and you doing all the teasing.”
Glancing at the microwave clock, Cas smiles softly to himself and pours a mug full of black coffee just as Dean's footsteps clomp down the stairs. They're a well oiled machine in the morning.
I was starving. You didn’t lose control of yourself, I made you lose it. Unintentionally, but regardless, I’m the one to blame. It won’t happen again because
Sam chewed his lip, seemed torn between needing help and wondering whether to trust Cas. No wonder though, with the way people had turned on one another in the face of the end. “D'you just wander around cities helping random people?” Sam asked skeptically.
Cas's hand slid up his back and curled in the top of Dean's hair, pulling his head back, the muscles of his neck taut. He bracketed Dean's body with his and sucked just under his ear, “You can do it, I have faith.”
“That’s the plan,” Dean said again. Even if they scouted it first, their odds were shit. Ten to one they were gonna be outnumbered, outgunned—considering they had no guns, that was a given—out maneuvered. The only thing Dean figured they had on their side, was that they were ten minutes early, and they had the element of surprise. Whatever that counted for. “Just remember, I distract them, you get Sam. Then we’ll all get out.”
“Dean, dinner and driving me out here? It's already more than enough. You did an amazing job planning this.”
He slows and gentles his pace until Castiel is shaking and oversensitive, forehead tucked into Dean’s neck while he gradually catches his breath and returns to reality. Dean just gently smooths Castiel’s hair back, rubs his hand in sweeping circles over Castiel’s back. Unsure if it’s possible to even stop touching him. He wipes Castiel’s jizz off on the thigh of his sweatpants and then folds him in a lazy hug.
Dean wipes his free hand over his mouth, and with the other one he hands Cas his gift. “Anyway, here.”
“Oh don't even give me that look Castiel Novak,” Charlie hissed with her own eyes narrowed right back at him. She looked fierce with her wavy hair cut chin length, eyes rimmed dark with liner and her scrunched up nose just added to the effect. “I don't know what that was about, but quit picking on him. Don't you think his life sucks enough?”
“Don't do anything stupid!” Cas demanded, rushing further into the house. There were broken windows all over, furniture knocked askew and papers littering the floor.
Stubbornness wasn’t just a Winchester family trait, the Campbell’s had it in spades too. So Mary was sure, that like his mom and dad, her little bean was gonna be a force to be reckoned with. Said stubbornness was the reason that Mary found herself in the middle of the woods, just outside their campsite curled over in the dirt and emptying the contents of her lunch onto the forest floor.
Apparently satisfied with Dean's answer, Cas held out the papers he had in his hands, “They're pamphlets. They go over different aspects, some are about safety and some are about specific kinks. There's a checklist in there as well. Before I arrive, I want you to read them. Fill out the checklist. If there's anything you don't understand you can text me or just put a question mark next to it. I'll go over the list when I get there.”
Eventually his lungs function again and a rush of air fills them as he slides down in Cas’s lap. Lets Cas hold him, and kiss his temple, the top of his head as he floats bonelessly in the warm glow of an orgasm that he still feels the fading tingles of.
This is Dean’s first summer back from college, nineteen now, and he’s filled out a bit since he was home last. A little taller, and broader, arms more defined. Something about him had finally caught Cas’s notice earlier this summer when Dean was looking for odd jobs and he’d gotten what he’d wanted for so damn long.
Everything only got hotter when Cas pushed Dean's hand down until it brushed over the tent in his borrowed boxer-briefs. Heat and hardness beneath his palm rushed blood south so fast that Dean was almost dizzy with it. He rubbed his palm along the length of Cas's cock, then circled it over the head,  listening to the quickening of Cas's breaths and leaning up to watch a flush spread over his cheeks and steal down his chest. So fucking hot.
“Fuck,” Dean groans, drawn out and satisfied. Full like he hasn't been since the last time he saw Cas. Toys just aren't the same, this is so much better.
He'd lucked into an apartment because Charlie's aunt had been looking for a tenant and as soon as Cas'd called her, she'd arranged it all. She’d even picked out some cheap furniture with him and had helped him put stuff together. Cas was probably never gonna stop being grateful for the way Charlie had pretty much held him together that day, when the adrenaline’d finally worn off and his fears about Zachariah coming after him had peaked.
to stay and see how this goes down, really, you have no idea. Dorothy and I have a prenatal appointment at the clinic and she’ll kill me if I’m late.” She grinned. “Be back in half an hour, Cas. Nice to meet ya Dean.”
After a moment Cas roughly managed, “For future reference, you can’t say that while you’re jerking me off and expect me
Something hot squirmed in Dean's stomach whenever he thought about what Cas was seeing, sparks that sent more blood rushing to his dick, more slick spilling down his thighs. Every thrust of his hips pushed him closer, higher, and Christ, he didn’t know he’d be so into this, but fuck if he wasn’t getting off on it. On the wet hot sound of Cas jerking off behind him, the squeak of leather and skin. Sweat-damp and shaking with effort, mind a haze of how good it felt, how fucking hot Cas got him, he rocked faster, harder. Every dirty-sexy word of praise that rumbled from Cas's chest lit him up, set his body aflame.
“I… the last few nights I couldn’t sleep so I took some walks in the woods,” Dean started and Sam raised an eyebrow, leaning his hip against a shelf and crossing his arms. “I saw a shadowlight.”
Tiredly, he turned on the water and let it warm up as he stripped out of his sticky clothing. He left them in a pile by bath tub so that he could step out onto them to dry off. Dad’s bath mat hadn’t been salvageable. He valiantly focused on
Another benefit to wearing his armor, aside from its practical use, since it wasn't seeing much of that lately, was that he looked damn good in it. Dean smirked to himself. Getting laid had always come easy for him, but the armor certainly tended to speed things along. Woman, man, didn't matter—Dean turned heads, and he liked it.
Kid was an air elemental like Mom, though so far Sam couldn't do much more than summon a gentle breeze. Some of the kids at his school had been picking on him lately for it, but Dean had taken care of that pretty easily. Nothing like showing up to get Sam and letting it slip that anyone who messed with his little brother was taking their life into their own hands to scare kids four years younger than him into fucking off.
Sam seemed to notice how goddamn weird that was right about the same time Dean did and he let go with a grossed out look on his face. Cas, on the other hand, stayed right where he was, like he didn't give a damn. Honestly, he probably didn’t.
“I—” Dean looked up at him, eyes Bambi wide and cheeks flushed, lips bitten red. And Cas almost said fuck it, he almost scrapped everything he knew about himself, crossed the room to the couch Dean was sitting on and crawled into his lap. He held back by the tiniest paper-thin scrap of control.
So when Sandover tells Dean that they’re gonna throw a big birthday bash at a fancy hotel bar for him, Dean decides it’s his chance to relax a little. There’s no way that Castiel’s gonna go to his birthday.
“Doesn't matter. Works out for me anyway.” Dean shrugged his shoulders and pursed his lips. He tightened his knuckles on the steering wheel.
Cas yanked his underwear down, tucking it beneath the curve of Dean’s ass. And then crowded up against him, knees on the outer side of Dean’s calves, his lips resting just below Dean’s ear. “Is this what you wanted? When you walked in here wearing that skimpy outfit for me, bending over when you knew I was looking? Is this how you imagined it?”
He tilted his head from where it was tipped back against the wall behind them and looked over at Dean. “Hmm?”
He didn't notice Dean doing the same until they wriggled out from under the whimpering, dying creature. Another was fast approaching, but Dean had a gotten his backup gun in hand. He fired, wounding it enough that it slowed. They grabbed their weapons and rushed for the front door. When Cas whirled around to defend the entrance, he saw more hideous bodies than there should've been surrounding the one he and Dean had killed. There was a burst of gunfire from upstairs, and Cas put two and two together.
Exactly what he’d been thinking becomes painfully obvious when Castiel buries his fingers in Dean’s hair and lowers his body so that he’s basically sitting on Dean’s dick. Heat converges in Dean’s stomach, and he wants to protest, he really does, but then Castiel offers him a lopsided little smile and leans in until their lips are so close that Dean can taste the mint of his toothpaste.
Even with early intervention like Dean’d had, too much emotional upheaval could trigger their element. People were right to be afraid of him. So Dean had cultivated a life where he felt as little as possible. Where he didn't get excited and he didn't get upset. Where the only things that marked the passage of his day were the subjects he studied and the breaks that he spent alone.
Dean lets his legs fall apart, just enough to make the obvious bulge in his grey sweatpants extremely visible. Castiel’s teeth dig into his bottom lip, and pink rises on his tan cheeks. Dean smirks lazily at him, “Come here.”
He was sort of grateful that Cas was giving him an out if he needed it, but Dean was … intrigued. He was borderline—and this wasn't a word he ever thought he'd use in regard to himself—giddy.
He’d been staying with Dean for two weeks now, Cas mused. Two weeks of Dean showing him around the city, picking off monsters as they went, scavenging things the camp needed. There were a few close calls that made Cas grateful to have someone at his back, but also made his chest tighten with the kind of fear he loathed. As much as he never wanted to care about someone again, Dean had squirmed and pushed his way past Cas’s defenses. Every night Dean came up with another excuse for Cas to stay, and Cas humored him by pretending he still intended to leave without Dean expressly telling him to.
They both wish him a happy anniversary as he leaves, and Dean thanks them before he climbs into his cab, the whole thing feeling totally surreal. Driving up to the house it just seems more and more incredible that this is his life.
They've been looking for Dean for months—tracking him by the traces Michael has left. There have been bodies, though fewer than they'd expected to find based on Michael's plans. Cas still doesn't know what they're going to do when they catch up to him.
Long enough for Dean’s thighs to ache and strain, for sweat to pool in his collarbones, the backs of his knees and the dip of his spine, Cas holds out. He’s not saying much but he never does when he gets close. Just grunts and digs his fingers greedily into Dean’s skin. Helps pull him down harder on every thrust. He grabs Dean’s ass, and spreads his cheeks. Dean just knows he’s watching his cock slide in and out of him, the tight cling of it around hard flesh.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the knowing smirk on Sam’s face. “I slipped on the stairs. Cas caught me.” Sam’s smile just grew. “Shut it, Samantha. Did you see if the washer and dryer are useable?”
Dean's about five seconds away from coming with nothing more than Cas's hot breath ghosting over his dick. And then Cas licks a slow line up his cock, sucks him into his mouth at the same time as he plunges two fingers inside of him. So wet that the glide is smooth and perfect, lube and come easing the way, and Cas's aim is dead on like always, fingertips massaging relentlessly against Dean's prostate. “Ca—” Dean’s voice catches roughly.
Don’t make me wait.” Cas looks at him then, finally, reproach in his his eyes, so hard in the darkness with the curtains drawn and the TV flickering splashes of light over them. So he adds a cracked, fervent.
At the driver’s side door of Dean’s car later that night, Dean heaved an irritated sigh, but the blush staining his cheeks when Cas kissed him goodnight, the dazzled warmth in his eyes as Cas pulled away—worth it.
Sam lets out a shuddering breath and Cas knows that it goes against every fibre of his being to run from a fight like this, to leave Cas behind, but the right thing wins out and Sam pulls along a distraught Jack.
A cool breeze sent a chill down his spine and ruffled his hair, and then to his left the distinct sound of hooves—cavalry—his mind instantly leapt to. No. It was a single horse, he quickly realized. His breath rushed out of him in a slow release.
Dean wet his lips and cleared his throat, anticipation simmering in his gut. “Yeah … that … um, that sounds good.”
Suddenly Cas's hands locked around Dean’s wrists and he tugged them away from his face. “You're not dumb,” Cas said fiercely, and Dean looked up into his narrowed blue eyes, conviction in his voice and on his face. “You didn't have all of the facts. That's not a crime.”
Impassively, Dean stares past her at Castiel’s smirking stupid shiny pink lips. He shoves down his anger and smirks at him too as the girl looks back and forth between them.
He's sitting in Charlie's book store when it comes on the radio. The deep thump of the bass drum catches his attention as he's thumbing through a book he's read several times, but keeps coming back to. Good stories are like that, they nestle their way into your heart and pull you in over and over again.
“Fuck,” Dean panted, eyes squeezed tight as his hips rolled forward against Cas’s rock solid grip. “Yeah, God, okay.” Dean’s eyes opened, all heat and want and
For fourteen damn years, he’d kept his powers on a leash. He hadn’t even manifested a flame, and yet, he must’ve to burn Cas like that. Acid scorched the back of his throat and he swallowed it down. He needed to get this under control. He was off-balance, but he had to recover, and fast.
A pleased glow radiated in Cas’s chest. He tangled his fingers with Dean’s, trying to keep the smile on his face from looking too stupid. It was probably a spectacular failure, but Dean wasn’t looking anyway. His green eyes were focused on their intertwined hands.
Dean begged for all he was worth, stomach squirming with the faint traces of his embarrassment, except instead of making him want to stop, it just turned him on even more. There was a wet spot on the bed, and he could feel the slight tug from a string of precome still attached to the slit of his cock.
People trickled out until only a few remained, food that’d been laid out picked over, and normally Dean would’ve been all over a buffet, but he couldn’t find it in himself to eat. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Bobby stop in front of the urn up on an ornate cherry wood podium. He ran a hand over the inside pocket of his suit jacket, and wasn’t that a rare sight—Bobby in a suit.
Cas squares his shoulders and he waits. And waits. And finally, at the third round of thumps, his irritation outweighs his survival instincts. Does Michael think this is a
Dean sent him a crooked smile he knew was killer. “Get back to typing away so you hit that deadline?”
I'm kinda dead, a very kind person in the comments brought this song to my attention, and it's insanely perfect for this chapter, and honestly the whole fic. I cried listening to it, and you should totally also listen to it and cry:
Flashing him a little smile, Castiel turns around, resting his calves on either side of Dean’s knees as he drops down onto his elbows with his ass up like a request. Dean’s brain short circuits—Castiel is
The exception to that had been when he’d had the tattoo on his wrist done. That’d been a bitch to sit through, but he’d done it, anyway.
Cas’s eyes flickered between them and he seemed about as lost as Dean felt regarding what was supposed to come next. Apparently Sam had it in the bag though, because he pulled Cas into a hug and said, “Thanks for coming, man.”
The one his eyes were drawn to had a wide dark grey distressed band with lighter grey detailing. A smaller black band of leather ran around the middle, silver hardware holding it in place. At the front, the band was attached on either side to the locking mechanism; a silver star. On the leather beneath, a hollowed out circle of silver flames surrounded the star. Something about it seemed powerful. He liked it.
The nice thing about being an incubus was that intimacy wasn't just restricted to sex. He didn't need Dean to get off in order for him to feed. There was plenty of stuff that worked almost as well—sex was just the easiest to come by usually.
Yet again, Jack's watching cartoons in Dean's room on Sam's laptop. Sam doesn't even complain about his laptop being commandeered though Cas wonders what exactly happened to Jack's laptop, but he doesn't ask. They're all struggling enough without looking for issues.
It hit him again, this possessive heat that made him want to own every inch of Cas. Ludicrous, since they'd just met and Dean didn't know a whole lot about him other than he wasn't a fan of socializing, and that he made fast friends with Sam. And that he kissed with a single minded focus that made Dean's cock jump just thinking of it.
He stands there expectantly, probably waiting to see if Castiel will fall apart, but as if Castiel would ever give him the satisfaction. “Of course,” Castiel replies evenly.
That sharp, darkly stubbled jaw, high cheekbones and those blue, blue eyes. Shoulders broad in a faded grey t-shirt that was snugly fitted, and once he’d helped Dean get to his feet on the floor, only a couple inches shorter than him. They still hadn’t said anything. Cas was looking at him with an intense scrutiny that Dean should’ve found uncomfortable, but instead he was looking at Cas exactly the same.
Groaning, he grips at Cas, hands dragging over Cas's shoulders, down his back until he's grabbing Cas's ass, encouraging him to rut forward. Cas pants and gasps against Dean's mouth, labored and sexy.
“You mean the one with the little teddy bear?” Dad asked with a barely suppressed grin as he looked up from the paper, and Dean shoved a spoonful of cereal into his mouth. “Said 'I wuv hugs’.”
Cas's voice is wrecked, and so fucking hot that a fevered burst of arousal surges through Dean in dizzying intensity.
In the meantime, Dean’d apparently discovered where he kept his towels and was waving one underneath the fire alarm. It took a minute, but the screeching stopped.
A doorman in the lobby points him toward the bar, and Castiel smothers another sigh as he heads in the correct direction. Soon he finds himself in an elegantly designed bar full of people, only he doesn't notice a single one of them.
His brows were drawn together in contemplation and he seemed conflicted. Dean wanted to ask what he was thinking about, but it wasn’t really his business. Dad and Bobby had been friends for a long time. They’d had a falling out years before Dean and Sam had taken off, for all Dean knew, though, they’d mended fences in the time he’d been gone. After a couple minutes, Bobby’s lips pressed into a firm line and he squared up his shoulders like he’d made a decision. He turned and Dean looked away, didn’t wanna get caught prying.
DaydreamDestiel: I promise that one of these days I'll remember to add my notes before I hit post. Lol. That day is not today.
While Balthazar worked, they chatted a bit about what was going on in Balthazar’s life lately. Mostly, it was the same old same old, partying and new people to sleep with every weekend.
Maybe this was a stupid plan, but it was the best Dean had. Sam was right though—shadowlights were dangerous when they
Sam though—Sam’d been angry for a long time, abandoned by someone else he loved and left behind to put the pieces of himself back together. Dean's guilt had only magnified with time, but at least he’d known Sam would be able to eat, to go to school.
He couldn't see Cas's eyes well enough to tell what he was thinking, but the way his breaths went shallow told Dean enough. It didn't take that long for Cas to let out a little growl and push up, hands diving into Dean's hair as their mouths met in a demanding kiss. He pressed his tongue inside, expertly flicking, swirling. He sucked and bit at Dean's lips, holding him there with hands on the back of his head. From the second they'd walked in the door, Dean was hard but his cock swelled farther against the zipper of his jeans when Cas slid one palm down, grabbed his ass and pulled him into a grind.
“You may as well dive right in. I’ve got a tight deadline I need to meet today. Procrastination is not my friend.” Cas sighed and brushed a hand through his thick brown hair, leaving it in adorable disarray.
Cas got up and made sure it was positioned correctly, and then they started. Maybe Cas had a high pain tolerance, but he never found that tattoos hurt all that much. The cat-scratch sensation of it always faded quickly into a sort of numbness that was just edged with enough pain to be addictive, and he was mostly able to tune it out.
He must've sufficiently conveyed his honesty, Sam finally relaxed a little. “Okay. But if we find Dean could we maybe leave out the part about me running for my life and losing my weapon?”
Sighing, Sam massaged the bridge of his nose with his finger and thumb. “I can't guarantee it'll work,” he qualified.
“Ignore it, Jo,” Dean commanded, finally reaching the third floor of the spire. Through the door on his right they entered a large room with four arched doors spanning the circular wall.
Castiel just raises an eyebrow at him before he curls his long fingers around Dean’s cock. He starts off slow, leaves gentle teasing kisses up the underside, and Dean’s fingers knot in his hair. Castiel groans his approval and sucks the head of Dean’s dick into his mouth. Easy, wet rolls of his tongue over the tip, and Dean’s thighs tremble.
But hey, there was always the chance that Dean was among the very, very rare fae who didn't get matched… yeah right. Like Dean's luck had ever been
Dean chuckles, fingers scratching through Castiel's hair, looking gorgeous and extremely kissable—but then when doesn't he? “She does," Dean confirms.
“Morning,” she greeted him brightly, cheerful in a way that always grated on Dean’s nerves until he'd been fed. “Sleep well?”
Sam's eyes narrowed. “Like I said, Dean, not a whole lot of information out there on shadowlights that's reliable. Hell, I'm lucky I even found the spell, it was part of this old folk-tale and it was woven into the poem—”
He bit his bottom lip, watching with singular focus as Dean popped the button on his jeans, and he swore he heard every metallic tooth give on his zipper as Dean’s fingers deftly worked it down.
Morning sickness didn’t just strike in the morning, Mary Winchester had quickly discovered, much to her misfortune. Round the clock random bursts of nausea had been kicking her ass for the last month, ever since right around when she skipped a period. She’d never been late before, not by more than a day or two, anyway, and after a week, well, she was pretty sure even before she went to her doctor’s appointment. Mary was ecstatic and terrified and so nervous about telling John. They wanted this, they’d planned this, but…
What if Cas actually tried to talk to him? With Dean's luck, he'd spontaneously light himself on friggin’ fire and burn down the whole damn school or something. Idly, he wondered if his parents would stop pressuring him to make friends then.
It was just the way he’d pictured it. By morning it’d be healed and he could show Dean. Hopefully it would help him convince Dean to give them a chance. Because it’d happened gradually, but Dean’d gotten under his skin.
Her head tilted, horns glimmering with reflected light. She ruffled her wings, and stared impatiently at him. Dragons were smarter than most animals, able to think and reason to some degree though they lacked the ability to respond verbally. Most were on par with a clever child’s intelligence, though Dean was fairly certain Baby was much more advanced than that. He often spoke to her as he would any human, and he got the feeling she understood most of it.
He opened the door and tried not to grimace at the hazy air that wafted out around him. He’d just started to wonder why his fire alarm hadn’t gone off, when a loud screeching started up behind him. His shoulders tensed and he winced. Dean, though, didn’t bat an eye. He just smirked and shook his head gently at Cas, then brushed by him.
There wasn’t a lot that Cas knew about good parents, but Dean’s mom seemed like one. He hoped he’d get to meet her sometime, even if the thought made nervousness twist in his gut. “Hmm. Tell her I said I’ll even walk you to your car, just to be extra safe.”
& I have decided to post the rest of the story as is, and she'll update with the art when she's able. You've all been so patiently waiting for the conclusion to this and we both appreciate that so much. I'm going to be editing and posting the last chapters tonight. <3
Dean blinks up at his surroundings. Clear blue sky overhead and he notices a rock digging painfully into his lower back. “The fuck?” he mumbles, sitting up and looking around.
Full circle, he made his way back to stand in front of Cas. Close enough to touch. Cas's eyes roamed over his face, took stock of the flush in Dean's cheeks, and by the slight flare of his nostrils, scented Dean's arousal. Still, he somehow held himself back, though every line of his body screamed tension.
Under the hot spray of water, he thought about what he knew. And what he knew was that Dean was upset about hurting him, scarring him. Dean was clearly freaking out thinking that it was all his fault for losing control. Cas hadn’t gotten a chance to really explain what’d actually happened to Dean before he’d run off, so he definitely needed to do that tomorrow. And he needed to apologize for letting it get so bad… plus tell him that he should’ve just talked to him about it.
Dean’s smile is like the sun bursting over the horizon in the morning, warm and full of so much hope, and Castiel thinks that their relationship will be like that too—full of hope and blooming even brighter, more beautifully, for each period of darkness.
It took awhile, and by the time it finally subsided enough for them to carefully pull apart, they were both starving. So Cas herded Dean into the bathroom for a quick shower where he gently massaged shampoo in his hair. He rinsed it out in between soft, slow kisses that Dean luxuriated in. Once Cas deemed them sufficiently clean, he helped Dean dry off, and then perfunctorily dried himself off.
He glanced back at Sam, who nodded. “Sounds good. At the very least we can probably get most of the trash bagged before we need to get ready for the funeral. Maybe get some of the bedding in the laundry if the upstairs isn’t so bad.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Because I love you, you insufferable idiot. I'm not going anywhere. I haven't intended to for some time.”
“Who? Cas? Yeah, he’s out back in the crafting room.” She took a deep breath and yelled, “Hey! Cas! I need you out here.”
it’s important. He has a person’s life to protect and Dean doesn’t take that lightly. No matter how much of a spoiled, ungrateful, sexy, jackass the person is.
picture precisely how that sigh might feel if he was lying over Dean pressed chest to chest. Clearing his throat, Cas squirmed slightly in his seat and absently set the laptop on the coffee table. Dean swiped at his forehead, and a twinge of guilt pinched Cas's conscience. It really was hot out. The least he could do after staring at the man like a piece of meat was to offer him some refreshment.
They’re both slippery with sweat, and Dean rubs his hand over the dip in Castiel’s spine, up the back of his neck, and fuck his he ever praying this trick works because his knot’s fit to burst and he can’t hold off much longer. Heat in his gut like pressurized magma, he squeezes his hand at the base of Castiel’s skull.
As soon as Cas cut the roll off with a pair of safety scissors he’d retrieved from his bag, and smoothed down the last bit of it, a thrill went through Dean. It surprised him a little, just how much trust he placed in Cas, but maybe it shouldn’t have. Even if it’d been a long time since he’d been around Cas before this trip home, there were so many ways that Cas hadn’t changed. He was still dependable, still clearly cared about the people in his life—the kind of person that caretaking came naturally to. They were alike in that way. Usually Dean found it hard to let go of his responsibilities, of his need to be in total control … but there was something unique to Cas that made him want to submit. That made him want to let go.
One of his hands smooths up Dean’s side, while his other perfect, soft, big hand curls around Dean’s diamond hard dick. He’s so wet that the slide of Cas’s fist is easy, tight and he arches into it, Cas going soft inside of him, and he’s so close it won’t take long—it never does like this. Not when Cas is whispering up into his ear, “Did so good, Dean. Fuck, you made me come so hard. Gonna be leaking out of you for days, won’t I, baby? You look so good like this. Already wanna fuck you again. Never wanted anyone as much as I want you, you know that?”
“Hi,” Dean said shyly as he glanced up through his lashes, cheeks a shade of pink that Cas had started to suspect was permanent by then and Charlie made an undignified baby dinosaur noise in response before Cas jostled her with his shoulder.
The incident, weeks ago now, when he’d accidentally left it up on his laptop and invited Dean to go sit down in the living room had all but slipped his mind until this very second.
Just shy of him, Cas stopped. Close enough that Dean could reach out and touch, if he wanted. Sort of hysterically, he considered just how badly he wanted to touch. His hands curled into fists. Cas smelled like alpha, like comfort, and Dean’s body responded all too easily. He wanted to bury his face in Cas’s neck and smell him up close, wanted Cas to close the space between them and make him forget all of this.
He'd explained as much to Dean already when he'd asked, with his cheeks flushed and his eyes downcast, if Cas needed more than what he was getting.
He licked slow and broad over Dean's rim, and they both groaned. Dean tasted so much sweeter, impossibly better, than he smelled. Dean’s hand flew down to rake through Cas’s hair. Cas hummed as he pressed his face in closer, lips sucking gently at Dean's hole before he flicked his tongue against it in gradually deepening passes.
He was so absorbed that he almost hadn’t noticed that the bell had rung and everyone had already filtered in. With a near silent sigh, he tucked his book away and dug out his notebook and a pen. His morning classes went smoothly, and falling into his routine soothed a bit of Dean’s ruffled feathers.
Groaning, Dean tried to buck up against him, but Cas lifted his hips away. “You fucker. You know what I mean. Put your hand on my cock or I swear to God, Cas—”
Of course. Of course, Dean had to show up when there was smoke everywhere, and Cas was haplessly standing around staring at the disaster and breathing in noxious air while his eyes watered at the sting of it.
“How does it feel?” Cas asked, a low growl of a question—proof that he was every bit as affected as Dean.
“It's okay, baby,” Cas breathed right into Dean's mouth, feeling him shudder beneath him. He bit back a groan as Dean’s hips jerked up into his. “You're not gonna hurt me this time. I promise.”
He’d been out here for at least an hour already, no sign of the shadowlight. An owl hooted to his left, startling him, and Dean’s hand clutched his chest as he tried to keep his rapid breathing quiet.
He’s sitting on the couch in the living room, absently watching TV in sweats and a t-shirt before bed. Castiel’d slipped away ten minutes ago to shower, and it isn’t a surprise to Dean at all when he comes out in just a towel, his hair still dripping rivulets of water that slide down his bare chest, over his flat abdomen, the cut of his hips, and collect in the white terrycloth slung low around him.
Then two of Cas’s fingers, warm and somehow perfectly slick, pressed firm circles around Dean’s rim. And fuck, oh God, he didn’t know what he’d expected, but those vibrant sparks of sensation were so much better than he'd imagined. For a while, Cas just teased Dean like that, working him up to a fevered pitch with hardly any effort.
The right side of the room was mostly toys; vibrators and dildos, plugs, various restraint systems too. His eyes lingered on a few things here and there, but he was too strung out to actually pick anything, and plus, he wasn't sure if he
Cas and Sam had almost caught up to the others when everything went to hell. Benny finally noticed they had company. He fired at the closest creature, injuring it, and the rest of the beasts surged forward to attack. Cas got his crossbow free in an instant, loosed a bolt and picked off one beast, then reloaded and took down another. Snarls and gunfire filled the air, the creatures were closing in.
The air rushes out of Dean's lungs on a moan. Cas wore a plug. Cas got himself ready for this at some point before they left the house. He's gonna get to fuck his husband in his favorite car on their anniversary. It's like Christmas and his birthday and every other holiday rolled into one and Dean's
Dean's anger pulses through him, his fear. He can feel it building up his energy and the walls that have been holding him back start to weaken. There's give in them that there wasn't before. Maybe he can harness this.
When he didn't reply Charlie eventually turned her attention back to the rest of their group but he knew her well enough to know that the conversation wasn't over. She'd just find a way to corner him later and try to draw the truth out of him. She was surprisingly effective at getting Cas to talk about stuff, which was unfortunate at times. He didn't like to burden her, despite her reassurances that that was what friends were for.
Cas smirked. “Of course.” He started over toward the beast; it looked like it could've been some sort of canine-esque animal before the rapid mutations had started. No one really knew what’d caused them. The government  claimed it was some freak of nature virus that spread at incomprehensible speed, but everyone knew now the government had been lying in the final days. Claims of safety and protected cities had been proven false fast. There was no safety. And for all anyone knew the world-wide virus had been manufactured. Some people said mother nature was finally taking her revenge on the human race. Rumors and fear-based stories passed around like wildfire among survivors. As if knowing how it happened was any use to anyone at all.
Dean’s shoulders relaxed, and he smiled a little at Cas. “I have serious doubts that you were ever a scout.”
“God, I'm so close,” Cas groaned, thrusting faster, harder, the sound of his breaths harsh as the swell of his knot started to catch a little more on every thrust, growing larger with each pass.
It was kind of screwed up that fate would assign someone like Dean to be with someone like Cas. Dean was about a zillion steps below Cas in the social order of things, and Cas was so far out of Dean's league that they were basically playing different sports. Or more accurately, Cas was like a star quarterback and Dean was someone who half-heartedly listened to the game on TV at home in the background while he did something else. They were worlds apart and they made no sense together.
“Wait,” his eyes are dark with desire, cheeks flushed dark, and Dean's so fucking hard in his silky blue panties. He
“Y-yeah,” Dean managed, and then Cas was kissing him again, deep, sexy fucks of his tongue, flashing all sorts of ideas through Dean's mind. What would Cas's cock feel like in his mouth? How would Cas's tongue feel on his cock? In his ass?
“I can tell you’re close, so, I’ll tell you what. Come in the next thirty seconds, and we can do this again tomorrow. Got a whole day off to spend with you. Think about what I could do with a whole day—”
“Knot me,” Castiel says, calm as anything, like he didn’t just say the best damn words Dean’s ever heard in his entire life. Like Dean doesn’t suddenly have to struggle with keeping himself from blowing way too soon.
Dean swallowed, kneeling on the couch and bending down over Cas on all fours, hands resting on the arm of the couch. “Like this?”
“Duh. We’ve actually been on vacation a few times together. He still lives in Lawrence and I didn’t really plan to.…” Sam trailed off, leaving the ‘come back here’ part of his sentence unsaid.
a soulmate. He couldn't be that close to anyone, so whatever was coming the morning after this—Dean tried hard not to think about.
It was pretty clear that Cas preferred short term affairs for a reason. Maybe he got bored, or maybe he just wasn't interested in long term relationships, but either way, when Dean left, Cas was gonna forget about him and move on. Dean needed to find a way to come to terms with that if he wanted to keep all this up. So he told himself that Cas was just doing what he’d do for any sub. That he shouldn't let this mean so much to him. It didn't really work, but at least he tried, right?
“Sam,” Cas looks at him with all of the hurt and despair he's been holding back, “Do this for me. For Dean, and Jack, and the world.”
Sam's face distorted in a quick grimace before he ducked down and shovelled his own cereal into his mouth instead of answering. The Winchester method of coping with disturbing facts #1.
Dean woke before the sun like he always did, but instead of rolling out of bed, getting himself a breakfast of dry cereal, and sitting on the porch to listen for monsters growling beyond the high fences they'd erected, he stayed in bed. Cas was still fast asleep beside him, face half-smooshed into the pillow, dark hair everywhere. Dean’s heart stuttered. He’d spent the night with his fair share of people, before and after the end, but he’d never woken up next to someone and felt his stomach swoop like this.
“Hello, Sam. I—” Cas finally seemed to notice that he was still holding onto Dean, and he let his arms drop to his sides. “Yes.”
That draws a whine from the back of Dean's throat that he had no hope of controlling. “Yeah, fuck. Want that so bad, Cas. Missed your cock inside me so much.”
He’s glad he woke first. It’ll give him time to think. Last night had been … incredible for lack of a better word. He’s never had a partner surrender control to him so completely, and it’d been intoxicating. His body heats at the memory of Dean lying there, hands fisted in the sheets, freckled skin bare, gorgeous, the only thing holding him back Castiel’s command.
Sam cut him a dirty look. “Yeah, Dean. I'm sending you to confront a shadowlight with plain ol’ rope.”
Sam's store was closed up for the day, empty when Dean had arrived. Dusty footprints on the wood showed decent traffic in and out throughout the day, so Dean hoped he'd had time to work on finding something to trap a shadowlight.
“Like what?” Cas asked, fake innocence in his voice. “That I find you attractive? That you're good looking?”
I've had this sitting in my docs for ages, planning to make it into a full sized sequel but I just don't have the time right now, and might not any time soon. It makes a great little timestamp to this story though, so I wanted to share it with you guys.
Dean shoots him a glare, adjusting himself in his nice dark wash jeans. “You're a tease, y’know that?”
From its unruly hair, dark lashes framing intense gorgeous eyes, full pink lips, and a damn nice body clothed in a plain unlaced linen tunic and snug dark leather pants, feet in plain leather riding boots, Cas looked like sensuality personified.
Caring too much did seem to be a Sam Winchester curse. He was always trying to take care of Dean in some way like he was the big brother, when that was definitely Dean's job. The one purpose he seemed to have, keep Sam safe—keep his family safe.
“Fuck, you're so hot, Cas,” Dean says, just the hint of a breathless whine in his voice. “Gonna make you feel so good, sweetheart.”
So, it's probably not surprising that this update is late. lol. If you're a longtime reader of mine, you likely already know to expect that. ^-^;; We're doing our best to get these out as fast as we can, but it looks like weekly was a little optimistic. Anyway, thanks for sticking with us, and I hope you enjoy the update.
“You’re annoying, y’know that?” he grumbled, eyes narrowed at her, hand dusting over the front of his armor. The sword and shield on his chestplate glowed bright blue at his touch, ready to be called forth.
Dean lets out a huff and holds his hands up defensively, “Just being nice, jeez. Since when’s that a crime?”
He looked every bit as desperate as Cas felt. “You're so gorgeous,” Cas told him, voice fervent. Dean's eyes dropped and dark pink stained his cheeks again as his breathing hitched. Cas guided him to his feet with hands cupped on his cheeks. “You are, Dean.”
You gotta.” Cas had to do this for him. He had to let him go. Dean poured every last bit of his desperate pleading into his gaze, begging Cas with words and without. “Cas, sweetheart, please.”
Baby was curled up fast asleep in a patch of sunlight along the back wall of the room, Dean figured she was worn out after he’d kept her out so late for the last few nights. Hopefully she’d stay that way.
“Jesus, Cas!” he exclaimed, one hand clutched to his chest like a chick in a B-movie horror flick as his heart raced with sudden adrenaline. Thanks to the cleaners he’d used, he hadn’t even smelled Cas before he’d scared the shit out of him.
A smirk pulls up the corner of Castiel's lips, “Yeah,” he says, lacing his fingers with Dean's. “Let's go home.”
“Christ help me,” Cas muttered, as he noticed Dean’s shirt ride up. Because Dean Winchester… Dean Winchester was wearing lacy black panties. Cas pushed to his feet as a thought occurred to him. He really couldn’t tell, but from where he was standing, those looked very much like the ones on Cas’s latest cover.
Arousal heats Dean's cheeks, sparks in his gut, and he reaches out and tugs Cas backward until he's flush against him, his back to Dean's front, one of Dean's arms banded around his waist, his other hand cupping Cas's hip, thumbing the sharp line of his pelvis.
Heat surged in his gut, arousal and desire fattened his cock. Cas pushed his hips down into his mattress and his breath pushed out on a low groan. Suddenly, he was too constricted in his clothes.
The shiny double glass doors in front of the building loomed ahead. Shoulder to shoulder with Sam, it felt like walking through them was something huge and irreversible. Which didn’t make a lick of sense, because one way or another, Dad was dead. Going inside didn’t make it true … but … it made it real.
Something warm spread in Dean's chest, but he didn't have time to examine the feeling. Cas suddenly pulled back and snapped his body forward. He used his hands on Dean's hips to pull him back on his dick at the same time. Brutal thrusts that shoved his cock into Dean hard and fast and so fucking good.
And it seemed like they were making progress. So much so that he'd been thrilled Sam wanted to move to Shepherd's Bend. The village had been in sore need of a shop like his, and he'd get to see his brother again, what more could Dean have wanted?
Pressure, then, Cas’s thumb pushes in slowly with a little effort, snug up against his cock, and Dean’s about a second from blowing his load, body tight around Cas, thrilling current of pleasure that jolts under his skin. His thumb slips back out and Cas finally breaks; his hips surge up to meet Dean. He pulses hot inside of him and he fills Dean up until it leaks back out around his cock. Filthy wet and fucking hot.
The sour-sweet taste of fresh cold lemonade flooded Dean's mouth and he let it linger for a moment, eyes locked on Cas's before he deliberately swallowed. Leaned up against Cas’s kitchen counter, thumb casually tucked into the waistband of the shorts that were way too snug for the work he was supposed to be doing, Dean tried not to smirk when Cas’s eyes darted between his face, his throat bobbing, and the way his hand basically framed his crotch.
“Fuck, Dean,” he grunted on a trembling breath as everything crested in a sudden rush of euphoria. He came in jerky hot pulses all over himself, then melted into the mattress, hand still loosely cupped around his slowly softening cock.
Cas nodded and said goodbye. He tried not stare as Dean walked away, but wound up doing it anyway. The bottom of Dean's leather jacket left just enough room for him to check out the bottom half of Dean's perky ass. A pang of hunger clawed in his stomach and he fought down the urge to catch up to Dean. Slow, he reminded himself. The emptiness in his gut hissed back at him, but he ignored it.
Long minutes later, still floating, he struggles to finally pry his eyes open, basking in the warmth of his afterglow. The white ceiling has a crack in the paint that Dean vaguely notices as his breaths even out, limbs heavy and warm, satisfied like he hasn't been lately.
Dean grinned at him, face flushed with heat. It was an absurdly good look on him. "Hiya, Cas. What's up?"
that? Its sharp claws and massive teeth gleamed in the sunlight filtering through the canopy. Whatever it was, he’d almost taken it to the face. Thank fuck Cas was so observant. He glanced to his right and left, making sure Benny and Jo noticed. They had, and they adjusted their search to compensate, checking the foliage too as they went.
But of course Cas hadn't said anything. Who would wanna find out they were meant for a loser like Dean? Not to mention that settling down at all didn’t really seem like Cas’s style. Being an incubus and all, Cas got around. He never had a problem finding a partner as far as Dean could tell. Either a side effect of his good looks or the natural charm that being born an incubus seemed to impart on a person.
A flash of movement caught his eye and he glanced up to see Dean stretch out his back,  the muscles in his arms and shoulders standing out—and oh—Cas was going to die. Before this summer was over, he was going to die. And Dean Winchester, of the absurdly attractive face and broad shouldered thick arms with his perfectly salacious shorts and sly innuendos would be solely responsible for his coronary.
The downstairs portion of Sam’s place was split into two large rooms; the front was his store, where he sold items he'd enchanted, and potions he'd brewed to the public. The back was where he did his research and prepared the items he sold.
In class, he did well, but not exceptionally—by choice. If he did too well, they might wanna skip him up a grade, or he could get recognition, attention, and he couldn't handle the pressure of that. His whole world had been so rigidly controlled for so long that he was mildly panicked over how he'd handle finding out who his soulmate was tomorrow.
“Um … I’m gonna be here for a couple weeks, right? And … I was thinking,” he paused as though he was searching for the proper words and Cas’s heart sped up at an alarming rate, “that this thing that’s going on with us—the uh … the attraction or whatever. It doesn’t have to be complicated, right? We could just have some fun while I’m here, if … uh … if you want.…”
“Didn’t look like you were planning to move any time soon,” he explained with a wink as he handed them over.
“Take off your shoes, socks, pants, underwear,” Castiel's smirk turns darker. “Leave your shirt and tie,” he wets his lips and Dean tracks the motion helplessly. “Then lay yourself out on the bed. Show me you can wait for me and I'll make it worth your while, alpha.”
Dean took the elixir and uncapped it, sniffing the contents. It smelled sort of like citrus and mint, but he knew better than to rely on a potion’s scent to gauge its taste. “How gross is this gonna be?”
Fury simmered beneath Dean's skin, and the ball of power in his chest expanded slightly and then tightened back down twice as hard. He couldn’t help his wince, pain spiking through his torso.
Dean was pretty sure he was blushing harder than he ever had in his life. This was so not how he expected any of this to unfold, but he couldn’t deny the fact he was pleased. There was a warm sensation in his chest that he was sick of fighting down. So he finally let himself grin right back at Cas. “Yeah—I—that sounds… I’d love that, Cas.”
The first few years, Sam's responses to Dean's letters had been short, vague. Dean still had no idea what’d changed two years ago, whether Sam had just matured or if he'd experienced something in particular to cause it, but he actually started talking to Dean again in the letters he sent.
“The joy of hand-me-downs,” Mom added with a smirk. “Anyway, I was thinking about how tomorrow you're practically grown up and it's crazy, right John? I mean, how did we get so
“I saw you looking at it,” Cas told him, another rush of warmth pulsed in Dean’s chest. “I thought you might like it for when we do this. When you wear it, we’ll be scening, and you’ll be mine. What I mean by that is that you’ll be expected to obey my orders. No touching yourself unless you ask permission and I grant it, and you don’t come without my permission. If you need to stop at any point, you can say your safeword and I’ll stop immediately. Do you want that?”
Somehow he made it through another few hours alone in his apartment that afternoon before work, another night alone after it. These days it seemed more empty than ever in his apartment. If Charlie and Meg hadn't been out on a date, he probably would've texted Charlie to come hang out.
Again, right at the edge, Cas pulls away. “Not yet,” he says sternly in reply to Dean's pathetic plea of a whimper. He smacks Dean's ass cheek on his way to reach into the nightstand, and Dean very nearly comes, the slight sting of it zipping through him. Sheer force of will keeps him from spilling all over Cas's navy blanket.
“Tell me what you want,” he whispered, leaving little kisses along Dean’s jaw, from his chin up the hinge of it. Cas sucked and bit there, reveling in the sweet little gasps that he drew from Dean.
Dean tried not to pout, he really did. Cas’s low chuckle was a clear indication that he wasn’t exactly successful. “Fine, it’s in the living room,” he said with a lopsided smile as he slid his hand down and laced his fingers with Cas’s.
lots of love for her art. She knocked it out of the park again even though she's feeling really under the weather. <3
Time freezes, or Castiel does, and isn’t that the same thing? His whole body locks up and he shouts Dean’s name, clamping down around Dean’s knot as he comes. Pleasure explodes out through Dean’s body in a shuddering fiery release. His eyes slam shut, knot locked inside of Castiel and pulsing into the condom. He shakes through it, fingers dug into Castiel’s hip, and still curled around his neck. Wave after wave hits him until he’s shivering and exhausted, lax and warm.
Dean raised his eyebrows, a sardonic grin pulling at his lips. “And you chose Sioux Falls for your greatest hits world tour?”
Dean followed Cas out onto the stone patio. The pictures Joshua had forwarded him didn’t do it justice. He whistled low in appreciation and Cas grinned at him. “It makes me happy too. Joshua’s talented.”
Dean held his breath as Cas slipped his fingers beneath the waistband of his jeans and underwear, and stripped him bare. Goosebumps rose up on Dean’s  skin, the chill of the room combining with anticipation in a shudder of pleasure. Cas was breathing hot and damp, so fucking close to Dean’s cock that each breath felt like a caress. He forced himself not to seek out the heat of Cas’s mouth, though he really, really wanted to, kept still instead.
There it was. The house they’d grown up in. Dean pulled his reliable Toyota Corolla into the space next to his dad’s Impala. He frowned at the dings and scratches that marred her paint job as he climbed out of his car.
And for the first time when Dean really thought about the future, he didn't see some blank, dark, nothing. He had hope. He had Cas. And that? That was a pretty damn good start.
“Yeah, okay, no,” Sam said, they both knew Cas Novak and shy didn't belong in the same paragraph let alone the same sentence. “But there's probably lots of reasons.”
He thinks, as they're silently watching, that this is actually much worse than when Dean and Sam were in prison. This is their past come back to show how useless it all was. The struggling against the apocalypse, rebelling for Dean. None of it mattered, because now Dean had said yes, and Cas had been powerless to stop him.
Dean’s fingernails scraped down Cas’s back and the room filled with the sound of slapping skin, their grunts and moans. His orgasm was hurtling toward him, right at the tips of his fingers when Cas suddenly slowed down.
“Well,” she said as she tucked a short strand of wavy blonde hair behind her ear, “I had a rough night.” There were dark purple shadows under her eyes that Dean hadn't noticed until she said it. “I kept thinking about how little you used to be. Remember that shirt you practically lived in for a year?”
Dean didn't let it bother him though, he just put his winter jacket on. A simple hand-me-down leather one from his dad. One perk of being a fire elemental was that he ran hot, and didn't get cold easily. Not that he was immune to winter temperatures, but he never really needed a puffy winter jacket like Sam did.
After the pizza had been delivered, after they'd eaten, Cas brought him to the ensuite bathroom in his bedroom. He filled up his clawfoot tub with hot water and some bath salts that turned the water a deep blue, and once it was full he helped Dean in. The hot water eased the strain of Dean's muscles and the eucalyptus and lavender scent of the salts relaxed him further.
She said that to me hours before she stopped breathing. And Gabriel, he sacrificed himself. We didn't have weapons, you know, when the world ended. Our family used to, my father taught me to use a crossbow as soon as I was able, but when we moved to the city with Gabriel we thought we'd never need them. And then we were trapped and out of options, and he looked at me and said,
Maybe there was a binding spell or something? If Dean had been lucky enough to have been born with magic he might’ve been able to capture the creature right then and there. Unfortunately for him, Sam had gotten all the magical talent in their family.
“They’re from your dad. He … uh,” Bobby let out a soft sigh. “He had ‘em in his coat that night. Jody Mills gave ‘em to me to hold onto for you boys. Looks like he’d been carrying ‘em for a long time. Pages are worn pretty thin at the creases. I … uh, read what he wrote when I was tryin’ to decide whether you needed to see ‘em or not. I know you’re not my boys, not really, but I didn’t want him doing any more damage. So … be mad if you’re gonna, but I’d do it again.”
He smiled to himself at the grip Cas had on his forearm where it was banded over his hips, like even in his sleep he needed to hold onto Dean. A rush of love for Cas pooled in his chest, and he wished that they could always wake up like that. Hell, maybe they could.
Stepping quietly toward where the sound had originated, Dean peered deeper into the shadows. It wasn't a horse at all—there in a beam of white moonlight facing away from him was a pegasus so black it almost bled seamlessly into the night, it's massive wings dipping down low beside it.
A text from an unknown number made Cas suddenly glad he'd slipped Dean his number a few days ago because it read,
“You look…” Cas stopped just shy of him, one hand cupping Dean’s hip, still staring down between their bodies. “You’re gorgeous. Is it okay if I touch you?"
Cas is everything Dean’s ever wanted, and he wouldn’t change a moment of their lives together. From the over the top way he’d admitted he was in love with Cas, to eloping the week before Cas had to leave for university, through those four long years where they’d switched off on visiting each other while Cas went through college.
It doesn't stay slow for long, not with Cas panting and moaning beneath him, bucking back into every thrust. Dean fucks into him harder, biting kisses into the side of his neck and his shoulder that are gonna leave marks.
Nervously, Dean bit his lip and nodded. He started with the least intimidating wall: the left one. He brushed his fingers over a pair of black leather pants crafted to look like jeans, and he couldn't help but picture Cas in them. From behind him, Cas quietly said, “I own a pair of those. If you're considering them, I personally enjoy them.”
splashed across the image in fancy stylized letters, below that James Novak in slightly smaller white ones. And… hello…? As if Dean's curiosity wasn't gonna prick at those things all adding up in his mind in less than half a second.
Cas's eyes crinkled. "Just Cas is fine, I'll show you around and then I'm sure you know much better than I do what you'll need to do."
Cas's chest caved in. He'd wanted to refuse, but Hannah was pulling at his hand, terror in her face and voice.
For a moment Sam paused, like he was wracking his brain to come up with a reason for Cas's behavior. “Maybe he's just shy?”
“If we’re going to do this,” Cas pulled one of Dean’s hands into his lap, repeating the same soothing stroke of his thumb over the inside of Dean’s wrist as earlier, “I’d like to spend the night. Sometimes the aftermath of BDSM play can be,” his head tilted to the side, “unpleasant. It’s important to me that I be here to make sure you’re okay. Especially at first.”
“You don't get to die on me, Dean Winchester! I'm not accepting that!” Cas saw the moment Dean realized that he had absolutely no intention of leaving him there. The second he changed tactics from martyring himself to figuring out how to get Cas out of this alive. Sam must have too, because he and Jo got Benny up between them and started staggering toward the house while Cas kept the path clear and Dean covered him.
It's a bit of a drive to where they're headed, and the sun’s fading fast, but Dean wants it to be dark out when they get there anyway.
Cas sipped at his beer and forced his thoughts in a different direction before he ended up being the weird guy in the corner with an awkward boner.
Cas smirked, picking Dean’s hand up and placing it back on his bicep, eyes dark when Dean chanced a glance up at them. “Trust me, Dean, I
As he poured himself a bowl of the Lucky Charms that Cas had bought for him, he smiled. It was such a small thing for Cas to remember, but it must’ve stuck out from the times he’d slept over with Sam. He ate quickly and glanced at the clock on the microwave. It was still pretty early, but he needed to check out the Impala and see what he was in for as far as getting her fixed up went. Before he headed out, he made a quick trip back upstairs to grab his phone and brush his teeth.
After a few morose minutes spent feeling crappy about his life, Dean got ready for school and headed downstairs. He could smell cooking food as soon as he opened his door, and his stomach rumbled even while apprehension flooded him.
Heading out into the street, Dean locked the door behind himself. The upstairs window was still unlatched for Baby if she wanted back in, though odds were good he'd find her at Sam's or she'd catch up with him at the guard tower.
Dean let out a shaky breath, “Yeah. Yes, sir, I can do it. Please fuck me. Want it—want you so bad.”
She chuckled at his expression, and then her eyes widened in recognition which was impossible because he’d never met her before. “Holy shit. You’re Dean Winchester.”
Just like earlier, Crowley took his leave by way of a whirl of demon smoke, leaving them standing in the rubble.
“Sorry,” he mumbles, shifts restlessly, but keeps his eyes on Cas’s face, “let me make it up to you?”
Cas puts out his smoke in the ashtray on the table next to the chair before he answers. Sets the remote down beside it. “Good. Clothes off.”
Shifting to lay his chest down between Dean's legs, propping himself up on his elbows, Cas groans. “Missed being inside you too,” he admits, nose sliding over the length of Dean's cock.
He flopped onto his back and stared up at the white paint on his ceiling. Sending Cas home had been the right decision, damnit. This wasn’t a real relationship, it wasn’t gonna last—and if he let himself pretend it could, he’d fall for Cas harder and faster than a gale force gust of wind. Cas was a great guy, gorgeous, amazing in bed. There was a lot to like. It wasn’t a stretch for Dean to recognize just how dangerous that could be to his heart.
“Aside from all this,” he gestured vaguely, “I've been alright, I guess. What about you? Still running the only bar in town that wouldn't take my fake ID?”
After a few seconds of silence, Dean finally squared his shoulders.  “Um. Okay. I guess. Just for a little bit. I'm not—people are—”
Dean was gonna kill the little shit himself when he found him. Sam better hope he'd been eaten by a goddamn monster ’cause it was a way better fate than what Dean had in store for him after this fuckin’ stunt. One job. Sam had one. Little. Job. Dean trusted him to look out for himself for fifteen minutes because Sam had been pestering him to do a solo mission for months and now he was AWOL.
“So what made you choose this particular outfit for your grand seduction?” Cas asked, blue eyes so intent Dean wanted to squirm in his seat.
“Ask me,” Cas demanded huskily before he could stop himself. Pushing his luck, he worried for a millisecond.
Arousal jolts straight down to Cas's groin, and he groans, tipping his head back. “You're an ass,” he breathes as Dean opens the door and ducks outside.
That the whole room isn’t watching them right now is a stroke of luck, but Castiel is all too aware of the few eyes that
“Fuck,” Dean sighs happily when he gradually surfaces. He slowly becomes aware of the sticky mess that he’s made of them both, but he’s still too worn out and warm to care yet.
He didn't. He never did. Maybe deep down Dean was a coward, but he was still so afraid of pushing Cas away with too many questions. Cas never meant to stay. That he was still here at all oughta be enough for Dean.
“Dean,” he sighed right back. He was too worked up, they were wearing too many clothes—maybe this was even hotter because of them. He tried to remember if he’d ever just made out with someone like this, but Dean stole his thoughts when he ground down on his dick.
Desperately, Dean bunched a hand in the front of Cas’s shirt and yanked him closer. He tilted his head down and before he second guessed himself, he pressed his lips to Cas’s, hard. Dry at first until Cas parted his lips on a hushed growl and surged forward. His hand clutched at the hair on top of Dean’s head at exactly the same time as he sucked Dean’s bottom lip into his mouth.
“Fuck, yes.” Without hesitation, Dean gets his hands on the firm rounded muscles of Castiel’s ass, fingers digging in as he spreads him wide and gets a good look at his soaking wet hole, and fuck if Castiel isn’t pretty all over. Pink and glistening and Dean dives right in, tongue tracing around the wrinkled skin there, lapping up slick and moaning into Castiel.
Instead he got out of bed, went and showered and got himself ready for school just like any other morning. He was hell-bent on keeping his emotions in check, on getting through the day with as little commotion as possible. He dressed himself in a fairly typical outfit for him: nondescript dark blue jeans, a plain black t-shirt and a blue plaid button up left open. One step of his routine at a time, he told himself, he just needed to focus on that.
Castiel doesn’t make him wait, thank fuck, ‘cause Dean doesn’t know if he could. He moves so that he’s straddling Dean's chest backwards, then leans down until his ass is lifted up right in Dean’s face. And Dean is patient, okay? So patient, but he’s going crazy staring at shiny slick dripping down Castiel’s thighs, smelling it up close and waiting to be told he can taste.
more interested in the mysterious Cas. Even soaked to the bone in clothes that clearly needed some care—or to be chucked out—Dean could tell he was smokin’. Dark lashes, gorgeous eyes, were they grey or blue? It was hard to tell in this light at this distance. The beard Dean probably could've done without, but that was more or less the norm for anyone nomadic. “So Cas, you're not from around here. What brings you to town?”
Today, though, he rushed through cleaning, drying off, and dressing. Quickly, he tugged on his off-white linen underwear, then his brown woolen pants, tying the front flap and waist. Stockings were next, and brown riding boots after that, he pulled them up to his knees and looped the button closures up his calves, securing them.
Pleasure jolts through him swift and fierce when Cas angles his hips just right, and oh fuck, he loves it. He just—he—
Dean hesitated, and Cas’s heart sank like a lead weight. He forced his emotions back to normal fast enough that he hoped Dean didn’t catch the quick flash of hurt in his scent.
“Okay,” Castiel says stiffly, head tilting slightly, like he’s trying to figure out what to make of Dean. His nostrils flare slightly as he scents the air. And yeah, thank fuck Dean sprayed himself before he got out of his car. “I’m Castiel.”
Immediately, Dean's hands gripped just above the bends of his own knees, holding himself wide open for Cas, fucking gorgeous. Desire to please Dean, satisfy him, heightened Cas's awareness. He dug his fingers into the firm flesh of Dean's ass, thumbs dipping into the crease and revealing Dean's pretty pink hole dripping slick for him. “Fuck, baby,” Cas groaned, “you're so wet for me already. Should we see how much wetter I can get you?”
Cas slid his hand down between their bodies, knuckles dragging over the soft skin of Dean's belly, then stopped just shy of his goal. “Try again.”
He doesn’t even try to make a show of it, doesn’t play that he’s got any restraint when it comes to Cas, just tears open Cas’s belt and unzips him, Pushes his boxers down along with his pants until they’re dragged halfway down his thighs, “Good?”
Dean's lips turn up in a warm smile at that, like he's just realizing how true Cas's statement is. “Yeah, I s’pose this can wait until later.”
Okay, so Dean was maybe holding a grudge over the teasing, but they knew how focused he needed to be. Emotionally charged situations could have negative effects on him and that included getting pissed off. Teenage hormones seemed to make it an uphill battle for him most days as far as finding his center went. He didn't need them making it worse.
For a second, Dean stared at Cas, huge green eyes desperately panicked, and Cas could practically see his heart beating jackrabbit fast in his chest before he casted a glance around at all of the people who normally didn't notice him. All of those eyes on him all of a sudden, and Cas could tell Dean didn't have a clue what to do.
Dean pressed closer, sliding his palm up to rub the bulge in Cas’s pants, reveling in the way Cas’s dick jumped in his hand, the way he groaned hot and low as he kissed Dean deeper. With his other hand, Dean traced a suspender up to Cas’s shoulder just to feel it, then started on the button of Cas’s shirt. They needed clothes off,
“Hell yes,” Dean muttered, scrambling to get out of every last stitch of clothing he was wearing—jacket and shirt rapidly pulled off, pants and underwear shoved hastily down getting caught on his boots. He rolled his eyes at himself and scrambled to unlace his boots. When he was finally naked, he schooched back on the bed, leaving plenty of room for Cas.
Leaning against the counter beside Cas, Dean sighs quietly, the warmth of him seeping through the side of Cas's pajama bottoms and Henley. It's a serene, grounding, too brief time. Even the slowest sips of coffee eventually drain their cups.
Gently, Cas withdrew his fingers and Dean sucked in a breath through his teeth. A few seconds of rustling later, there was the telltale crinkle of a condom wrapper, and then then Cas’s hand ran through the slick on Dean's thigh. The unmistakable wet sound of jerking off followed and Dean moaned Cas's name.
“But I found an enchantment to bind a shadowlight's power.” Sam nodded his head toward the back of the store.
Cas's hands on his bare skin more than he's ever needed anything in his whole goddamn life. “God, Cas, I can't … I can't. I need you to fuck me, need you to touch me. I—I can't.”
“Wow. Talk about a blast from the past.” Dean smiled. “Haven’t seen Cas Novak since the two of you were scrawny little seventeen year old nerdlings in graduation gowns. Do you guys still even talk?” he asked, unlocking the door.
Crowley’s lips pulled up in a smirk. “Can’t get anything past you. I came to see if Lilith was really dead.” He shrugged a nonchalant shoulder. “I needed to confirm it. Now that she’s out of the way, I’m going to pull a coup with those of her followers who are left.” Dean’s temperature rose as he bristled, but Crowley rolled his eyes. “Don't worry, we won't be after Lucifer. As if I’d give up my new position for him.”
“Ready whenever you are, Dean,” voice thick with a double entendre he doesn’t miss but chooses not to comment on.
Pink spread over Dean’s cheekbones, entrancing, gorgeous. Like he was being helplessly drawn in, Dean leaned up closer until their lips were very nearly touching. Until he could feel the heat of Dean’s breath against his mouth. “Yeah?”
Mom sighed and Dean counted backwards from ten, reminding himself that she was just happy for him and like most people she thought he oughta be excited too. Even if she knew all the reasons he wasn't.
“Yeah!” He came jogging around a corner with his rifle in his hands. Something suspicious was going on. Dean knew it but couldn't pinpoint what. Then he noticed the broken strap on Sam's rifle. Had he just fumbled his gun? Was he trying to play it off? “Just knocked some books over. You know me, growing limbs I can't control.”
Dean’s lips tugged up in a smirk that drew Cas's gaze, “Dude, I kissed you. I should be apologizing.”
Cas brushed his lips against Dean’s wrist where skin met leather. Just a soft touch, but Dean shivered at it, skin sensitized. “First, I’m going to strip you down. Right here. I’m going to bind your arms together,” Cas informed him as he reached for the tape, “then I’m going to take you up to your room, put you on your bed. Face down, ass up. Presented like the perfect, pretty omega you are for me.”
Sam was smaller than Cas and Cas was struggling to stay but Sam yelled as he tugged on on him. “Cas, we gotta get out!”
His fingers pressed hard into Cas’s back as the heat gathering at the base of his spine pulsed sharply outward. Shockwaves of pleasure lit up behind his closed eyes and he moaned helplessly through it.
After Balthazar shot off a few rapid texts and Cas had set up his station for him, they settled in, Cas in the reclining chair and Balthazar on the rolling stool. Balthazar quickly selected the colours that matched Cas’s design and lined the stencil up. He peeled it off, leaving behind a blue outline of the design on Cas's skin.
Softly, Cas’s hand slipped down to cradle Dean’s jaw and tilted his head up until their eyes met. A shock of serious blue, so beautiful that Dean was left breathless. “You can trust me.”
“Just open the door, Jo, I'm not gonna yell it out here for everyone to hear. The last thing I need’s someone starting a panic,” he yelled back.
Could he? He fucking hoped so, because that sounded hot as fuck. God, it was gonna take every ounce of restraint in his body though. He was already so close to the edge.
A tiny prick of guilt poked at him. He was going to his dad’s funeral in a few hours and here he was in his house, having less than pure thoughts about Sam’s best friend. There was probably something wrong with him, but the heat in Cas’s eyes when he dragged them up to Dean’s face as he finished … was kinda worth it. Maybe Cas could offer exactly the kind of distraction that Dean needed this weekend. The kind he would’ve been out looking for as soon as Sam left anyway. He licked his lips and watched Cas mirror him. Hot.
Dean’s eyes dropped to Cas’s sweatpants and his lips formed into a pushed out pout before he decided to play along, tugging his underwear down until his cock bounced free. Boxer-briefs successfully removed, Dean straightened up. His cock pointed up toward his belly, thick and straight, pink-tipped and precome-wet. Fucking perfect. Gorgeous. Cas’s hands itched to touch.
The malicious glee in Mr. Adler’s eyes while he forces his face into a falsely sympathetic smile dashes any hope Castiel had, fury seethes in his stomach, and still Castiel manages to keep his scent and expression neutral.
“Good morning,” he replied, and then focused his attention to the copy of Slaughterhouse Five he was reading for the second time.
It sounded fun to Cas, getting together with your family and spending an evening watching movies. At the same time it was a totally foreign idea to him, but it seemed like fun.
's amazing art. I legitimately might have (totally) screamed a high-pitched scream when she sent it to me. ^-^;
They'd spent so many hours under that shiny black hood, covered in engine grease, Dean teaching Castiel everything he knew in between private smiles and warm laughter, stolen kisses.
with him. There would be time to explore the many, many fantasies he’d spent so much time thinking of soon, hopefully.
“Oh, wow,” Charlie said with a sarcastic smile. “Two confessions in one day.” She fanned herself and pretended to swoon. “Most days. Man, you really know how to make a girl feel special. Dean better watch out with those kinds of moves.”
Instead, he has to attend Dean’s stupid birthday party. Mr. Adler had made it perfectly clear that the invitation wasn’t so much an invitation as it was a directive. Which is how Castiel ended up in a blue suit missing his worn in grey sweatpants.
for the amazing art prompt. I fell in love the second I saw it, and I was head over heels when my claim was successful. Working with you has been amazing, and your art is so beautiful. I was and am still completely blown away by every single piece you created. Thanks for making this so much fun. <3
Dean was gone. The part of him that always felt a tug to Dean was blank, untethered. It was like being jaggedly ripped in half; something intrinsic stolen. His eyes burned, but tears didn’t come. The ones he’d already shed had dried in streaks on his face, and he was numb. Eviscerated.
They were at the gate, gearing up for a run into the city when the growls and howling started. It seemed to be coming from all around them. Dean ordered people into defensive positions. It'd been weeks since the last attack on the camp. They hunted the woods to a good radius around here to keep the odds down. His dad and Uncle Bobby had worked to set up the camp, scrambling enough survivors together to make a go of it, to make it defensible. A lot of their army buddies had made their way here too, which meant they'd had a good chance. Some people were lost along the way, but the rest were thriving half-decently. Eeking out a living and Dean hoped there were more places like this out there somewhere. There had to be.
“Things to repair and adjust my crossbow. Some bolts that were left behind in the hunting section.” It didn't sound like a lie, but maybe this guy was a fluent liar.
Cas presses a gentle kiss to his forehead, his wet cheeks. “Even if you did, you know that would be fine. No one's perfect, though you do come particularly close.”
Once he showed Dean where the shower was, he gathered up a change of clothes for himself, and set up his laptop on the coffee table. He put popcorn in the microwave and waited for his turn in the shower.
His nose wrinkled, and his fists balled up at his sides. What the hell was a shadowlight doing in this realm?
Cas's body visibly tightened, and Dean's smile went lopsided, dirty, as he watched Cas fight the effect of his words. Fuck, he smelled good. “Of course. Do you—I could come over after work and we could try something?” Dean's eyes darted toward the back of the store, instantly curious about what Cas wanted to try. “We'll discuss the specifics before hand, obviously. No surprises tonight, I promise.”
He'd lost him. Even if it’d been temporary in the end, he’d lost Dean. Cas couldn't forget the aching emptiness he'd felt in those long minutes without him. The pain of losing the person he loved most in the whole world was still raw and fresh. And God, he was so lucky that Dean was here. That he was alive, and safe, but it didn't stop that worried knot in his chest that wondered how he would've survived without him. That kept asking,
Dean held his breath after the last shot he fired. No more monsters in his sight. The house was silent. He waited. Still nothing. “Cas?” he yelled into the house.
Castiel hums and the vibration sets off sparks of pleasure that race along Dean’s skin and settle tight in his gut. He’s close—really goddamn close. The shape of his orgasm forming low in his belly. He’s sweaty and trembling and suddenly he’s aware that Castiel is jerking off. It’s like an inferno beneath his skin … the knowledge that sucking him off got Castiel so goddamn turned on that he's already gunning for a second orgasm.
“Nah. I'm gonna take Benny and Jo, you stay back in case someone's gotta patch us up after,” Dean said with a smile to reassure him.
“I—” Cas smoothed his hands over the thighs of his jeans, and then nodded. “Of course, well, the… the gate to the driveway is right over there,” Cas pointed to the left. “There’s no lock on it. You can just—and I should, uh…” He stared at Dean for a beat, looking at a loss for words.
“Of course, Dean,” he replied and watched as Dean walked away, all broad shoulders and narrow hips that melted into the crowd of people who were leaving the cafeteria.
He turned a curious gaze on Cas, was he into this stuff? He'd always seemed so straight-laced and buttoned up when they were younger. How he'd even managed to co-own a regular old sex shop’d been a mystery to Dean. This was an even bigger mystery. Cas gave his wrist another reassuring thumb stroke and then released him, “Why don’t you take a look around?”
Cas studied his face for a moment and then he opened up the flap on his messenger bag. He reached in and withdrew a roll of shiny black tape, and set it on the coffee table. Next he dug out the cuff Dean’d been looking at in the store. Surprise parted Dean’s lips. It was still just as beautiful as he remembered. Faded dark grey leather, scrawling symbols painted onto it, silver lock gleaming.
Hey guys! Don't forget to leave kudos or a comment if you enjoyed. Boosts to my confidence definitely result in more work. ;)
“Did you see anything that interested you?” he asked, voice a little too raw to properly affect casual.
They were in the cafeteria, at their usual table with Jo, Meg, and Gabe. The three of them were still animatedly talking while Cas had apparently been guilty of dereliction of duty as far as conversation went.
Crossing his arms and tearing his gaze away from the direction of the house, Dean gives her a dirty look. “I—hey! I am
Movement up ahead caught his attention—the pegasus. It was lying down in a thin beam of moonlight not far from the stream, its ebony coat giving off a cobalt shine, unnatural blue eyes blinking lazily. With its front legs tucked beneath it, and its hind legs jutting out to its left—away from where Dean stood, its wings splayed out around it, the shadowlight was in a perfectly vulnerable position. Dean honestly couldn’t have asked for a better shot at it.
“Um … yes?” He hadn’t mean for it to come out like a question, but he was still a little off-balance.
He flicked his gaze toward Cas and noticed the concern on his face as he moved closer. “Here I am,” he agreed, his voice barely even broke.
“Dean,” there are so, so, so many things he wants to say to Dean, but he forces himself to pull back. “We need to let Sam and Jack know that we're both okay.”
“I mean, I get that it's complicated and all, with both of your histories and your whole needing sex to live thing. So you've had a lot to—wait.” Charlie's gaze on him sharpened and he knew she was taking in the slight bruising under his eyes and the unusual paleness of his skin. Cas fought not to squirm in his seat like a guilty child. “Oh, man. You dumb motherfucker.”
Dean kissed him harder, kissed him breathless. Heat gathered at the base of Cas’s spine, a tight-hot coil that wound tighter and tighter. He was so—Dean was so—his heart thundered wildly. God, this was
The problem with that, he learned, was that kids like him had a hard time keeping control of how they felt and that was normal. Kids didn't have the tools, Dr. Lafitte had told him, to control themselves the way they needed to in order to keep their powers from activating accidentally.
“Dean,” his voice comes out hitched and breathy and it's almost as dirty as the way he presses back against the swell of Dean's cock, hot enough that Dean hates pulling away.

What that meant was that if Dean wasn't extremely careful he could hurt someone by accident, especially since Dean appeared to be a fire elemental. Fire was dangerous, Dean knew that. The guilt over costing them the only home he'd ever known had burned hot in his stomach.
They gave up ground, Cas firing every round he had before he dropped the gun and switched back to his crossbow. They made another stand closer to Dean and Jo. There were still too many monsters coming at them. They needed to get to a house. They needed to find a defensible position.
Cas pushed away the very, very tempting image of Dean in his bed and all thoughts of phone sex or sexting. At least for now.
Cas’s cheeks heated, and his stupid heart fluttered irrationally in his chest. How was he ever supposed to make it through this in one piece?
Castiel’s omega is goading him too, tugging at his gut, and making his heart race way too fast in his chest, bouncing off his ribcage and daring him to take off, knowing Dean will pursue,
That morning he’d decided to start packing stuff away. He went out and bought some cardboard boxes for the things he wanted to keep, and some clear plastic bags for things he would to give away to goodwill. He’d just finished up in his old bedroom when his phone chimed with a text from Cas. It was an address, Cas’s place, Dean assumed, and it said there was a surprise waiting for him this afternoon if he was interested.
He shoves in deep, fucking him while he does his best to jerk Cas off at the same time. It's harder than it normally would be in the cramped space—and that's his saving grace in the end, the extra concentration that he requires staves off his climax just long enough for him to feel Cas tensing around him.
“Fuck, you’re so gorgeous, Dean,” Cas murmured, hands grazing back up Dean’s thighs, curling around his hips, “Such a pretty cock, and, mmm,” he groaned low and Dean trembled with it, “that ass? Can’t wait to get it all pinked up, fuck you while it’s hot and throbbing.”
Fast as he can, Dean strips, it’s not sexy or even efficient. He almost gets caught in the collar of his t-shirt, but he’s bare and waiting fairly quickly. His dick juts out in front of him, a little thicker than Cas’s, though comparable in size, which Dean’s pretty happy with. Red tipped and glistening with precome, a testamant to how long he’s been waiting, how much he wants this. His face heats, his neck, and down his chest as Cas looks him over. From his messy hair, bitten red lips, down his chest. If they weren’t already pebbled up tight, his nipples would’ve reacted to the way Cas licked his lips when he glanced at them.
Dean let out a slow breath, little tremors wracking his sweat slick body. “Trust you. Cas, I trust you.”
His fingers grasped at the back of Cas’s t-shirt, the blunt edges of his nails scratching clear through the flimsy material of it. Sexy, and sweet, Dean was perfect.
Bright hot sparks of pleasure wracked Cas's body—the heat building inside of him flew outward in blazing pulses as he came, hard. Long, long moments of intense euphoria that greyed out his vision and buzzed in his ears.
“I… I’m pretty flexible.” The look Cas gave him was an exasperated sort of fond that Dean was extremely used to garnering. He smirked shyly. “Whatever you want to do with me.”
Nope, one way or another Dean was going into those woods alone tonight. Grimly, he squared his shoulders and headed for the tower.
to have a goddamn clue. Heat creeps up under his clenched jaw, his blood pressure climbs. To say that Castiel frustrates him is an understatement. A massive, massive understatement. Stupid blue-eyed, perfect-bodied, gorgeous, son of a bitch.
The moment he's inside one scent rises strongly above all the others—old books pages and leather binding—a sensation exactly reminiscent of the sunlight warming his skin in the window seat of his father's library envelops him and pulls him forward. It's comfort and safety, and Castiel recognizes what's happening instantly.
“That nerdy little rebel.” There was a note of pride in Dean's voice that wasn't entirely purposeful—he'd always been secretly impressed by how curious Sam was about everything.
to be seen. No one talked to him, no one even noticed him. That was the way it needed to be. He might not've
It was dark out when they got to the abandoned warehouse they were instructed to show up at. Foreboding. And Dean figured he oughta be scared. He oughta be, but he wasn't. An eerie calm’d settled over him.
Sam would be expecting Dean to take back-up tonight, but he wasn’t about to risk the rest of the guard, and besides, he’d barely managed to convince Sam. No chance was he gonna look like an idiot in front of his soldiers.
“If you want me, it has to be more than that,” Cas said, then cleared his throat. “I’m not asking for a proposal or anything, but if we’re going to be intimate… I want the chance to get to know you better.”
There was a steady trickle of people headed in through the front doors as Dean locked up the Impala and he slipped easily among them once he was done. He made sure to avoid jostling anyone as he walked over to his locker and pressed his palm to the cool metal of it in one of his morning rituals. The smooth locker door beneath his palm grounded him as he released some of the tension that being in a crowd usually brought out in him.
Dean's brow furrowed as he tried to figure out where exactly Sam had gone off script. His gaze landed on the library across the street from the picked over hardware store Sam was
Cas’s firm hand slid around Dean’s throat, up to cup his jaw as Cas’s other hand squeezed and caressed his ass, the skin tingling and hot beneath his touch. “You’re going to stay here, just like this while I get you ready,” Cas told him, voice hard and strained and fucking beautifully rough. “Then I’m going to have you kneel on the couch while I fuck you. I want you to look out the window, into the garden, that way every time you’re back there, you’ll be thinking of how this felt. How desperate and hard you were for me.”
“To what?” Dean asked, edging closer, his hand finding its way to Cas's hip. “Have me half-hard all night, desperate to get you back to my cabin?”
“Please, Cas, please. C’mon.” And then he was pressing inside, a slow thrust all the way in, Dean ground back against him, the rasp of Cas’s shirt sleeve over his sensitized burning skin lighting him up. “I need more.”
Dean's lips twitched higher. "Matter of fact, Cas, I am thirsty. It is hot. Though I can't imagine it's much less hot in there with you."
After a while, Dean’s mouth was tingling and he was aching hard, letting out desperate little noises that Cas swallowed down. Cas pulled him back by his hair, sharp enough to sting, but Dean liked it. He moaned and arched his back.
His eyes fluttered open when he was met with silence and he found Charlie staring at him wide-eyed, lips parted. For a second he wondered if she'd had some sort of a stroke but then her lips split into a huge grin.
Dean’s breaths were shaky, his body trembling, so Cas guided him to lie down on the couch, wanted to take care of him. He fit himself between Dean’s parted legs and slowed them down, languid kisses and a slow grind that felt so, so, good.
Sitting on his living room couch, Cas had his laptop open in front of him, the cover his publisher had sent over, the one he'd been so excited to open forgotten as he stared out the patio doors, or more accurately at what was beyond them. What was the allure of a male cover model clad only in lacy black panties when the landscaper Cas had been subtly lusting after for weeks was puttering around his garden.
The stillness between them was an uncomfortable by-product of coming back for this. The day they’d put Lawrence behind them and headed to the West Coast when Sam’d gotten accepted into his dream school on a full ride, neither of them thought they’d come back, but here they were. Dad always did get the last say.
For a second, Cas just considers him and there’s this warm weight that always presses itself on Dean’s chest whenever Cas does that,
Sheets and blankets bundled in his arms, he carefully climbed down the stairs, eyes on his feet to make sure he didn’t miss his mark and end up on his ass.
He blinked hard a few times and let his vision focus on the deep blue of the sky, cut through with the white strip of a jet trail. The sun was rapidly fading in the west, dimming everything, and he’d always loved this time of day. He watched a murmuration of starlings twist and coil stunningly through the sky before they settled into the treeline behind the building, and tried to catch his breath—slow his still frantically beating heart.
“So, I was thinking,” Dean said, voice sleep-thick and slurring. “Attacks’ve been ramping up lately. If you leave right now, I’ll worry. So, maybe you should stick around another night. ’Sides, wouldn't you rather fuck me right now than wander off?”
