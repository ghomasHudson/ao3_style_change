A banner in the living room read "Celebrate your..." The words on the back were blacked out.
"How much work should I do in earthing, watering, fertilizing, sunning, catching insects and so on?"
"Yes, that child, and an Omega mutant. Do you want Doom to do everything himself?" There was a slight emotion in Doom's voice this time, but then he calmed down quickly.
“Taxi! "He stopped  a taxi.
What Steve was trying to say was that the Quinjet was parked on the roof of a building next to the hospital. Now if he flew back in Tony's armor, he would come back later to retrieve the plane. But better go back in his armor, isn’t it? See him arrogantly flying in circles, drawing red flames.
Shortly after Iron Man flew out, Bain entered the mainframe room, followed by a mysterious man.
"Well, let's do it. Iron Man and Spider-Man will fix up the Jet. Hawkeye and I will stay here to look after these guys, take over S.H.I.E.L.D." Steve returned to the captain's normal state, arranged the task.
"You're welcome." Steve pretended not to hear what Tony said.
Tony whispered in Peter's ear, "Peter, your nose is running again."
"The moment Doom pierced your armor created a branch, a parallel universe. You will fall asleep again. When you wake up, you will enter this new universe, and you will forget everything that happened in this outside dimension. You won't remember our conversation."
"Sorry, Steve, sorry..." Tony shed more tears.
"It seemed to be quite agile. I felt I had arrived just in time."
"Thank you." Tony tried to keep his voice under his agitation.
"I'm not lying. I came here on foot."
The remark stopped Krats. He looked up.
"This is a picture of us winning Goal in the state final last year."
"Captain America, it's Captain America!" The pass by shouted in surprise.
"It's okay, kid, it's okay."
"Okay... It's not a date, just say you do charity condolences to a veteran."
"Why didn't you call me?" Peter said.
Kris stood up helplessly and looked at Tony wistfully.
Just then the door of the house creaked. Steve listened carefully. The sound of heavy, familiar footsteps.
"Does your armor have enough power with the shield open?"
The roof of a building near Central Park in New York City.
"Hi, Paige." Steve said.
Tony couldn’t find the village head. The civilian communications were down. With an idea, he connected to the Avengers satellite, called up the area map, located the school, and rushed directly into the broadcasting room.
"But it will affect me." Steve whispered in Tony's ear. "I will do anything you want me to."
"Surely not me, he shouted 'Tony Stark comes out'."
"One more thing, removing the filter will probably have some effect on the backup power of my implant, so you'd better solve this matter before it runs out of power."
Ten minutes later, a man about six feet tall, with dark hair, blue eyes, a moustache and a dark suit, in his thirties, walked into his office.
"He quits. I'm not drinking today." Steve said.
"Doom, come out! Haven't you been expecting me to come?"
"Have you been thinking of letting me go down a little bit?"
Mrs. Rogers gave a quizzical look.
Steve propped his motorbike on one foot, looked up into the air; The Golden Knight descending from the sky, hovering with jet boots in front of Steve. Through the mask, Steve could not see the expression of the man inside. But the Iron Man raised his gantlets toward him, the repulsors emitted from the ring of his palm, that was hissing. This posture was indicative of the current mood of the armor pilot.
"It's all your fault, Hank. You drove too slowly. Look what we missed. Congratulations, Cap. "Jane leaned in and kissed Steve on the right cheek, then she turned kissed Tony on the left. “And you, Tony. I knew you two would be together again. It's like back to the old days, isn't it? We're family again."
"I'm right behind you. I've been waiting for you. I've been waiting for you for so long. You want to see me, right? You want to see who I am, right? So, could you turn around now? Then you'll see me."
"Probably a little bit of a jerk." Tony said.
"I'd like to go for a drive today, maybe visit some old friends."
"After Stark's head of corporate security died, I spent three hours tracking down the murderer and thief; Four hours with Spider-Man; got caught sneaking into Baintronics; ran into Stark's old flame; and walked halfway across Manhattan; I really didn't want to talk." Tony lay flat on his back, and said to the ceiling.
Avengers Mansion, New York.
Mrs. Carbonell was so beautiful, with dark hair, brown eyes, delicate skin, and exquisite makeup that it was hard to imagine that she had an eight-year-old daughter. Her daughter, Maria, has clearly inherited her mother's traits. She made a curtsey to Krats.
"He'll look better. And he has all kinds of amazing gadgets hidden in his armor."
The Young Genius Iron Man came on stage, raised one gauntlet which popped out a small box inside, and shot it straight at Steve.
"Where's Dr. Octopus' lab?"
"To be fair, that person is dead, this one is just him ten years ago. He didn’t betray you." Spider defended Tony.
A meter away in the bed, Peter was not asleep. The spider sensor, which was always ineffective at times, now works properly. He saw Tony's every movement, and he felt his growing desire. He had seen Tony put on his headphones, he had seen him close his eyes, he had seen him unbutton his pajamas one by one, revealing the muscles of his chest. The implant in his chest flickered in the dark, seductive. He saw that he began to reach out and caress himself, following the lines of his muscles, going down... He saw his desire to rub his genitals, his head constantly thrown back, his legs and toes constantly straightened. He heard him groan and gasp.
"My ID card didn't ring." Tony said.
Then Tony told Peter what happened in the Grand Canyon cave, and how he came to the future and was hunted down. Peter was listening.
"Wait a minute, Hulk!” Tony didn't know where he had the courage to rush straight into the Hulk. He blocked his way.
According to sources, the members of the Avengers could enter Britain in a very short time through mysterious magic... The invasion of mysterious magic caused the panic of the local people...
"Wait a minute." Doom's cold voice echoed through the hall again.
"I didn't lose my hammer in the first place, but I wasn't strong enough to handle it before."
"Yes, I've been getting a taste of his life lately. I'm even surprised how he managed to multithread his way through these messes. You know, I'm afraid I'm going to fail a bunch of subjects this semester."
"That's great! I think I can use my university lab to do some research. Chemistry is my forte." Said Peter happily.
After finishing his message, Tony got dressed, put on his backpack, went downstairs, got into his sports car and headed for Dr. Octopus's lab.
External defense breached. 72% of power is left. System data was displayed in front of Tony's eyes.
To be continued...
"I will go, look for him now. I will find him."
Tony sat on a pile of hay, with Kris in his arms.
The terrified guard pointed to the second hole on the right. Steve knocked him unconscious, dragged him into the shadows.
"Uh? I'm not sure, but it's so hot, I'm breaking out in a sweat." The brown-haired boy raised his arm and sniffed under it. "I think I should take a bath."
"That's Blacklash. Attack his base. He relies on base flight from air superiority, but every time he attacks launching a whip, the base current will be unstable, so he’ll habitual right, balance of the body. In that interval, you aim at his base, and it's all right for him to fall. And if you don't want to be barbecued on a skewer, don't let his whip through your shield. You will be hit directly by high-voltage currents due to the echo amplification effect of the Vibranium conductor."
The final battle of the Zodiac.
"Maybe, you should turn off the shield."
"Cap, don't even..." Tears came to Wanda's eyes.
By the end, Tony's body was painless, but he was still sobbing. He felt Steve kiss away his tears over and over again. Because his tears didn't stop, neither did his kisses.
Not many terminals nearby can provide support. Tony rushed into a fast-food restaurant, held up the Avengers ID card, and shook it.
Chapter 31
"They will only distract us from our work, from the challenges we have to deal with, to the higher priority threats, make us struggle with all kinds of doubts."
"Didn’t you say it had no energy left?"
At that moment, an electric light struck over.
"I understand, Captain. Your whereabouts today will never be revealed." The chief said.
The sound of the crash caught Steve's attention. He led Spider-Man to the source, where the road was blocked by a pile of rubble.
"I'm sure you can't send me back to the Arctic Pole!"
"In order not to accidentally hurt your security personnel, please lead the way, lady."
"Un, tennis, I see."
"So, you two hooked up again?" Hawkeye broke coldly.
"We agreed on a party for the evening on the way back, then got into some arguments. Tony flew away in a huff..." Steve said a little sadly.
"Guys, I just want to say..."
"Captain." The man came up to him, Tony recognized him.
The cold of the window and the heat of the man's body in front of him alternately stimulated Tony's desire. Halfway through the unbuttoning, Tony's eyes hazed over. He put his legs together, hooked the man's back in front of him, and shouted his name over and over again.
"You know very well, Onslaught is not me. And I am the one who is trying to resolve this now."
"I... I... Of course, I... Willing to. I mean, great!" Steve bustled his drawing board and the brush into his schoolbag. The brush fell to the floor and he bent awkwardly to pick it up. The blonde girl sitting next to him had already picked it up and handed it to him.
"It's nothing, I understand. You have to spend time with other friends." Steve said.
"Oh, you won." Tony tiptoed in Steve's ear.
"You hit the right point. I have the knowledge key of the cosmos, so our technology can work within the circle. No offense, I was the only one who could solve the situation."
"Turn on infrared, scan for humanoid creatures within 54.6 yards. Activate Vibranium scan to locate the combination of Vibranium and humanoid creatures. If the creature is moving faster than Mach 0.09, start the shield."
When Spider-Man opened his eyes, he was surrounded by a group of gunmen. Hawkeye was nowhere to be seen...
"You've been playing the game; How do you know I laughed?"
Tony smiled. "I reckon the ones who have made similar threats in front of us... Ah, your ranking is about... too low to calculate.
But the Electro calmed down immediately. He looked up and saw Iron Man.
"How did you get here?"
Bucky's voice came, and he walked out of the basement.
"No? Dr. Octopus's poison is no ordinary ether."
"How can that be? Not every day, though. But if we have to wait a year every time, I will be on Hawkeye’s Stoic list again."
“Tony?”
The village of Gawthrop, Yorkshire Dales, UK.
"I'll help you up. There should be a power supply in the base to charge your implant."
"You followed him?!" At this, Spider understood. "You left me in prison to die! What about implementation as planned? What about teamwork?"
The Manhattan Metropolitan Museum of Art, now.
Brooklyn, New York City, 1934.
Tony 19
"From what you say, I look like a fool."
"You promise?"
New York City, on the Quinjet.
“Steve!”
"All you are done?!"
"That's not what Stark's tracking system said. The stolen armor designs are in this drawer." Tony stiffened his voice.
“I'm coming to save you!”
The castle was like a maze, and without the aid of the locator, Tony not only couldn’t find Doom, but also couldn't tell where he was going. He simply gave up searching in vain and went straight on shouting.
"I want to know, who is your hero? He always has a name, or a title. Don't every hero have a title?"
Tony swore again. “Damn it! Libra! % & #"
"Hank, aren't we all right now? Let’s go of the past and forget about the future." Jane was half drunk, because Hank had sobered up.
Chapter 07
"I woke up alone in this damned world. I lost my parents, my friends; I lost everything I knew..."
Tony looked up and around. There was no look of surprise on their faces, no look of disgust, as if this were just a daily thing at Avengers Mansion.
"He was kind enough to take care of me when he didn't see you." Spider-man softened his tone a little as he remembered that Hawkeye had saved him and made food. "I think he was mostly upset with the older version of you. They might have had some old grudges."
Steve didn't think it was that easy, but he knew he couldn't get the truth out of Tony now, so he stopped asking and joked:
"More deeply, your plan for today will be ruined."
It was a rainy night. He lost a bet, would take a toy back from this toy shop, but he had no money in his pocket to buy it. He planned to go in first and try his luck. "Opening" was hanging on the door, but there was not a single customer in the shop. He ventured to open the door. The shop was dimly lit. The space between shelves was very narrow, only one person's distance. Rows and rows of shelves, in addition to grotesque machinery, there were all kinds of frightening models. Green Frankenstein, silver-barrel-monster, vicious Viking with hammer, nunchakus wielding demon, giant ant, scarlet witch with shining eyes, ugly blue orc with big feet...
"Maybe... That's the first time anyone's ever said those to me. I always thought grown-ups were always right."
Columbia University, now.
"Tony... Tony......"
"Even though I'm packing light today, just a few of you punks...?" said the brown-haired boy sarcastically. "Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'll give you a minute to run away."
"Would you come home with me? Let's go home together."
"Steve, I have an idea now, but it's a risky idea. The success rate is about 50 percent or less." Tony said.
"Aren’t that what you heroes are for? Save the world or something? The data is in the mainframe of my lab in New York City. You don't need me to write instructions, do you? There's no point in giving you data if you can't breach the security protocols."
His yell was so loud, it echoed in the cave. It worked. Spider looked at a figure in the distance, breaking through layers of defenders, moving this way. So, he waved his hand and went on shouting. When the rescuers reached the cell door, Spider froze.
As the waves of desires washed away, Tony felt lazy for a while. Sleep finally caught up with him, and he fell asleep on Steve's shoulder.
"It suddenly occurred to me that I should adjust the detector to find Hawkeye and Spider-Man."
Tony looked at the other side, pretending he had not done it himself.
"I'd rather try yours."
"I'm thinking about it..."
"Got you."
Steve felt the warmth of Tony's lips against his, felt his hands caressing his chest, caressing his waist, and then his naked body was searing against his. He kissed every inch of his body. His kisses were not as passionate as they used to be. Each kiss was long, warm, and full of love. It was a terrific dream, if it was a dream.
"Tony..." Steve's voice was drowned out by the wind blowing in.
"Thank you, Kris. You saved my life." Tony said.
As soon as Tony's back was covered with the sheets, the Avengers ID card rung. Tony tried to concentrate. He seemed to put the card in his jeans pocket. Around the bed, their clothes were jumbled together, a little difficult to identify. Found it, on the right side of the bed at the foot, the card did not light. That is, Steve's card is ringing. Tony continued to look around the room, trying to find his logical mind. Where would Steve put the card? Yes, on the bedside table on my side. Tony quickly leaned, reached for it with his left hand. But Steve was one step ahead of him, skipping over his bare chest, grabbing it. Steve answered the card and gave him a silent gesture.
"Sort of. I used to adore him. I adored him blindly. But I don't really know him. Even though, afterward, he and I were very, very... Familiar. He is too old. It's hard to understand, you know, and I don't have much patience."
"I think we have a clue." Peter said.
"There are an infinite number of living ones in universes, and each living one has an infinite number of possibilities for its choices at any given moment, but there are not that many parallel universes. Creating a parallel universe requires enough cosmic energy to converge at a point in time. In that way, a new branch may be able to generate at this point. And the one who gathers this energy must have a very strong will, a very strong obsession at that point in time, to be able to resist the original timeline of that universe, so that the energy can gather and engender a parallel universe. In short, your obsession created it."
Frostbite raised a hand. A swirling wind, accompanied by a hail storm, swept toward Steve.
"Iron man, wait!"
Tony saw grief and a sense of helpless vulnerability rise in Steve's face. The man in front of him was the idol of his childhood. Tony always thought there was nothing in the world that could knock him down. He was always optimistic. Those days, when Tony fighting beside him can feel the passion he brought, he can feel the belief that nothing can defeat the Avengers. Those things made Tony willing to follow him and die on the battlefield for him. This man in front of him is not the same man on the battlefield. He was in a deep wound, perhaps deeper than anyone else. Is this why Black Widow didn't call his Avengers ID card either? She positioned him where he was at that time. He was in front of Tony's tombstone.
"I don't think the security protocols are problems, but you need to tell me where the lab is." Tony said.
"Get clothes from the dry cleaners for the crazy old man editor of the Daily Bugle, if you call this a date, you have a great taste."
"I think you've experienced the don's energy... Actually... It's very vigorous."
"I've backed up Cap. Electro is in custody. Iron Man offline."
Oh, and one more thing, I've been doing some serious reading lately. Your actual age is just a few years older than me. You were only 22 when you were frozen in the ice. You can't just add on the years you've been frozen. He was 23 when he found you, so you're actually younger than him. You just like to play 'vicissitudes.'"
Chapter 41
"It's just... You said you didn't live around here. So... Can I ever see you again?” He lowered his head, tangled his fingers, picking at his nails. His stomach turned down again.
"Uh, why are you taking this course?"
"Maybe I should keep it."
Tony rubbed his shoulder, walked angrily to Steve.
"But I want to fight you!"
"Finally, you can dance something a little more modern."
Nearby, the Vision said, "I can assist him."
"She is out of danger and needs to be hospitalized for a few more days. You can go and see her now, but don't stay too long. She needs a rest.”
"Tony... "Steve said.
"Peter... You see... I may be away for a while, and this time it may be a little longer."
"Will you let it go?"
About 10 feet tall, Onslaught was clad in black and red armor, with only glowing red eyes visible from behind a black metal mask. It had no language, it had no sound, it was a monster that combined the dark mind with the chaotic energies of time and space. It was surrounded by heroes in the middle of Central Park. The two sides were so deadlocked.
But Steve's voice just dropped... A flickering whip, caught in the wind, came down from the sky and fell straight in their direction.
"You are so slow. Let me give you a hand."
"How did you account for our disappearance, Peter?”
"He should be in the sheepfold." Kris said. "You know Seth's name, too?”
"You calm down first, not to despair, stay there, I will find you."
Chapter 28
"I liked it, so I hid it."
"Yes, Master Krats."
Gambit was obviously not in the mood to notice the offence in Hawkeye's words at this moment. He spoke with a sorrowful voice.
"Run the diagnosis." Tony's voice - controlled armor. Data displayed on the screen in front of him.
"We were always at odds, always at loggerheads. He was always able to get my goat. The only time we're not fighting is when we're in bed, and at that time... I forgot what we were fighting about in the first place. I forgot everything... Pete, are you with me?"
The most special one? This applies to every Tony Stark, including the recently blackened one. These philosophical lunatics can recite a few chicken soup philosophies anytime. Tony shook his head, laughing at himself. He walked back to the machine, finished the final operation of balancing the magnetic field.
Doom took a small box from inside his armor and held it up in midair. Tony still could not see his face and could not read his thoughts. But Tony needed the content of the little box, so he hesitantly walked up to it and got it. Doom's silver gauntlet caught his red. The moment Tony pulled it back. His pull was limited and Doom held him hard. Tony could use the weapons in his armor, but he wasn't going to do that. If he destroyed the content of the box, all his renewed hopes would be dashed. So, he said defiantly.
But something unexpected happened. When they arrived at the local police station, the chief of police came out, whispered a few words to the policeman escorting them. Surprise appeared on the policeman's face.
"So you want a thank you gift?"
"What are the collateral requirements?"
“Did Jarvis tell you that?”
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Tony, what are you doing here? Quick, hide!" Steve shouted anxiously.
"That's why I told you eat something before you rush out. We can't catch them all at once." Steve said.
"Catch me! He did nothing! I knocked these men down."
The thief, holding the painting, turned slowly, his young face illuminated by the flash of the electric torch.
Steve's shield flew off at once. But it went blank, hit the wall, bounced back. Spymaster has vanished without a trace.
"Obviously not. Well, let's go and get it back." Tony turned around, headed for Central Park.
"He belongs here. He's the one who likes to show off in the spotlight."
"Yep, here I am, just in time to save your life. It's a rookie mistake to handle such a dangerous super criminal alone without help, Cap."
"Some other day, Dr. Octopus is locked up, and can't run away. Besides, earth won't be destroyed for a while. Today we have another battle to fight."
Everyone was relieved to see Cap laughing. Beast took the opportunity to step forward. As someone with bad news, know when to say it.
"But you said he flew last time."
"What? Peter."
Tony stood up and followed Steve to the emergency room next door. During the doctor's treatment of the wound, apart from answering the doctor's questions, Tony didn't say a word. Steve didn't break the ice.
“Don't call me master, please. I've come to help, not your master.”
"If you fight like this, I will be distracted, further reducing our fighting capacity. Last time, struggling against the Zodiac, you exposed us in an ambush."
"Don't need electronic remote control, you can fly out of the elevator shield. So handsome!" Tony exclaimed.
"See you later, Steve."
“It's too far away. Who will listen to me? I'm still a child in their eyes. Little kid, little boy, brittle little boy and so on. You're the only friend I've got this time, Pete. "Tony said passionately.
Wanda recognized the figure of Iron Man through her tears. She nodded to Tony, then put away her tears and moved over to Jean. Grief tapped into her potential. She channeled the powerful powers of Chaos into Jean's psychokinesis. The two beams of light interact together to form a mental barrier that fully closes Bruce's personality. At this point, Hulk had become a full beast, a beast out of control. There was only killing intent in his eyes. Step by step, the ground trembled under his feet as he walked toward Onslaught. He went up to Onslaught, banged at it without rhyme.
"Er... You..."
"I think you might need this." Steve walked in, handed him a baseball shirt. He had changed his clothes, but his hair was still wet.
"Identify success, welcome, Ms. Bain."
"Liar......" Tony whispered repeatedly.
"Not bad. You’re in surprisingly good shape for a desk Jockey."
"I just want to confirm how it feels to kiss another man." Tony said.
To be continued...
They went into the laboratory, and sure enough, there were a lot of bottles and cans.
The smile in Steve's eyes was widening. He might have been trying not to laugh. Tony knew he had been fooled.
Steve was standing next to the fire hydrant. He split it open with his shield. A large amount of water gushed out. Then he used his shield to adjust the direction of the spray, directly into Electro. Electro short-circuited by the water, emitting a sizzling sound, falling to the ground.
"Me too. What else?" Jane said.
Avengers Mansion, now.
"If you haven't seen a superhero, how can you draw them?" Paige said.
"Steve."
"He's the Iron Man, An Avenger, Superhero. I'm safe." Bain spoke to the head of security, but her smiling eyes were fixed on Iron Man.
"In these cold temperatures, of course I get colder and colder."
Tony was walking toward That-Tony’s room. As Steve watched Tony fadeaway, his mind drifted back to many years ago...
“Well, I'll go back to Tony's room and sleep well, if you want to keep your room clean." Tony made a show of leaving Steve's arms.
"That's fine with me." Kris said.
“That's it?”
"Well, you caught me. There's only so much I can do."
Gentleman Tony pulled open the door and Kris got in. Then they left and went away with admiring glances.
"But you hooked up with an old man 50 years older or more. Oh, my God. Why would I know that?!"
"I don't think this harbour will get any people. Other beaches should be full."
"I thought the Avengers had priority permission from the U.N. to act around the world. "said the Hawkeye.
"Well, Spyminister, I'm ready to play seriously now."
"Trouble you've made of yourself? Is it hard for you to admit that you're not all that different from me?" Eric said sarcastically.
In the grass near the cave, Tony made a plan. Steve rushes in ahead with great fanfare to attract the guards. Then he dives, finds the base's core power source, destroys the device that affects the magnetic field in this area. Steve, as he had promised, did not contradict, approved of Tony's plan directly. Of course, Tony didn't know Spiderman was here when he made the plan.
The top of a building next to Baxter Building, New York City.
"Is that so? I thought scientific exploration was more fun and meaningful to you than money."
When he succeeded, the Spymaster laughed.
"Now that I'm charged and bathed, can we go on with what we did yesterday morning?"
The kiss is going on.
To be continued...
"Are you kidding? What to invest in if you don't have the money?"
To be continued......
"Do you want to walk home with me?"
Before taking the kid, Mrs. Rogers smoothed her hair awkwardly, carefully covering a bruise at the corner of her eye with her fringes.
"Brown hair is common, and so is the name."
Tony paused. "He had plenty of chances to kill me. How hard could it be to kill an unarmed student at Columbia? But he went to a lot of trouble to hire Whiplash, Spymaster such as the top killer, but so far has not succeeded.
"I'm Tony Stark. As a member of the Avengers, although in the reserve team, you are too unprofessional. Your news is too late.”
"Bucky! Woof, woof! Well, apparently not..." Tony sighed. "All right, all right, my earth, my mess, I’ll fix it by myself..."
“Who sneaked into my lab!”
"Ha-ha! Mom at work? Whose mother needs to go out to work? What job can a woman do? She's probably fooling around with some other guy. No wonder your father was drunk all day." The tall, stout boy with the cap scoffed.
"Come on, come on, I'll show you the glorious history of our brotherhood." Benjamin pulled Tony along. Tony looked back at Kris, hoping she wouldn't take it too hard.
Tony cleared all relevant data from the mainframe, closed his helmet, and prepared to leave the Bain Tower. Before he got up, he noticed another trail of water under the champagne on the mainframe table. It's been moved. That means someone came here after he left. Tony was quick to react. Is that the line he/she left for me? But the mainframe security protection set by myself has no trace of intrusion. Tony had buried the doubt. Whoever it is, it is not someone I need to know urgently. He had more important things to do now, and he hoped it was not too late. He didn't want to give up. He didn't want to give up yet.
"So I'll be stuck in 1930..."
"That's why I wonder how we enjoyed the 'Daily' today. My Avengers ID card didn't ring."
Victor helped Tony out of the field, the heavy alloy doors closing behind them. The armor disassembled into pieces by the robotic arms, floating in the center of the field.
"I don't think he'll turn up at this late hour."
"They already knew."
"That's fool."
"Promise me you'll take good care of yourself, Peter..."
“Tony?”
"I thought you would take that as a compliment."
"I have some faith in the fight art which I have taught you. You made no movement evasion; I knew that you did it on purpose. I left the podium to you to get those little tricks out of your sleeves, figured out how much you're hiding from me. You know it's hard to get that out of you. You never want to have a serious talk with ‘Old Man’."
Avengers Mansion, backyard.
"Where is the good captain? I haven't seen him. I only saw a man who wanted to do some dirty things with you again."
“You break it! How do I go back?!"
"You were trying to protect me?" Steve said.
"If you need anything?" Tony said as gently and patiently as he could.
Thor and Steve were indeed looking for Tony. Avengers were out on missions. Although the backup power was running in the mansion, communications were being cut off by a blockade. Thor's powers have been malfunctioning recently. He could neither fly nor break the barrier with his hammer. They needed to rely on technology guys to solve this problem. Tony was the only scientist on the Avengers roster in the black circle now, so they headed for Columbia. They didn't expect that Tony had already traced to meet them halfway. Steve wanted Tony for technical support, not for hand-to-hand combat with a pair of gauntlets.
Tony smiled too.
"Don't move. Hands up. You're under arrest."
"Because I need you to surrender now!"
"In eldership mode again, Cap? Treating me like a child again? That's not how you behaved before."
Tony headed back, kissed Steve.
Steve didn't know how long it took him to wake up. He tried to gather his memories as he opened his eyes. He wasn't sure if his experience of the night before was real, if Tony had really been back, if he had been crying in his arms. Steve struggled to find evidence that this had ever happened. The crumpled sheets, the smell of his body, the dried tears on his pillow... He came back.
"Huh, understaffed? You won't wake me up. "
After too many drinks and several sleepless nights, Tony wasn't paying attention when he got out of the car. He was trying to piece together his memories...
"So, shall we visit Dr. Octopus now?"
"Peter, wait a minute! It can't make you fly! Open the glide wings inside." Tony shouted anxiously from the built-in communication system.
Paige glanced at her companion, hung her head without answering, and walked away. In the noisy hallway, Steve watched Paige disappear around the corner, feeling extremely lonely. He vaguely knew the answers to some things, but he didn't want to be sure. So he pretended it hadn't happened at school. He was still waiting in the same place that day, and Paige showed up, walking back to the toy shop with him as usual. She was very kind to Steve that day and did almost all the cleaning. Steve never spoke to Paige at school again. He was too afraid, he was too afraid to lose Paige, he was too afraid to go back to the days when he had no friends at all at school. But some things, with fear or avoidance, can’t unhappen...
"It's not like I just hack into computer systems. Let's just say I did a little research on the Avengers."
Thor threw the hammer. Steve threw the shield. The agent operating the airship was shot down. Before the airship overbalanced and fell, Thor jumped on it. Steve jumped on it. Then they pulled Tony up. While Steve piloted the airship and Thor took charge of the airborne enemies, Tony took apart the panels and studied the airship's system. By this time, the streets of New York were already in a melee, full of panicked crowds and looting criminals.
"Maybe if I modified it, it would filter alcohol." Tony said only jokingly.
"But I've always saved you, either of us." Tony put his arm around Steve's neck, looked up and gave him a kiss.
"Tony Stark, you said you wanted proof, huh? This is the evidence. Although you don't have high-end knowledge of the universe, if you are really the smartest human being in this era, you can still figure out the function of this device, right? See for yourself."
"I can draw you a map." He took a pencil and a little notebook out of his pocket, bent his head to draw carefully.
"I actually think one horse is better." If that, you have to hold me.
“Or we could walk." Steve suggested.
"We always have."
"Uh?" After a long silence, Steve continued, trying to keep his voice calm.
"It's about Tony Stark. I need time, I need space, I need inspiration... I thought it might be a good idea to go to outer space."
"Maybe not that deep."
"You know... I... Today..." He said bravely after a moment's silence. "Today is my birthday."
"What?! Tony!"
"Dani, Dani is not here yet, I won't go..." Running outside, Elise began to cry.
"Aha, all the heavy armed forces are chasing Hulk now, we're just looking for someone who got lost on the way." Said Tony, slightly resentful, sitting in the copilot
"Is someone bothering you again?"
"After the tragedy just now? You instructed me to use your watch to turn on the locator. You know the result. I'm not sure you can direct me to any bottle or jar you want."
"Spiderman, it was not your fault." Tony interrupted Peter.
"Thor......"
“His moral standards are scary. If I step out of line or hide something from him, he'll catch me and nag it forever. You know, the last time we were in Washington..." Tony began to tell Peter about the incident in Washington.
"I've been doing that, but time is a living organism, not just data, and I can't completely fix it with the crystal. And the Forever Crystal is more like a management system, it can't create, it can only control."
"I'm already thinking about coming here for Christmas Eve dinner next year." Tony said with a smile.
Columbia University, 3:00 a.m.
"You should hold on a little bit more, believe in yourself a little bit more, maybe next time it will be you leading the Avengers through." Tasha said.
"What if something happens?"
"I'll try it."
Outer dimensional space, after an uncalculated time.
"During Christmas, earthquakes and mudslides occurred in the Yorkshire Dales. The Avengers authorized Iron Man and Spider-Man to carry out rescue operations in the Yorkshire Dales after receiving requests from local people for help. This event was not just a natural disaster, like the recent snowstorms in 32 U.S. states, but a mysterious anomaly that threatens the safety of the planet. So in accordance with the Avengers Charter for Safe Peacekeeping signed by the United Nations, we took urgent action to protect the safety of the local population."
"Emmm."
Tony went into That-Tony's room, opened the closet...He paused, so strange. The mansion belonged to Tony’s memories. The old things of his own time, had been moved to his dormitory at Columbia University. So, he closed the door and sat in this strange room.
The rain was falling harder and harder. Tony stood alone at the grave of this one-time hero. Tony turned to leave That-Tony's grave. In the distance, a blond man was approaching. These days Tony deliberately avoids That-Tony's old teammates, the Avengers. But it seemed a bit too deliberate to run away this time, so he stopped.
"Why did you install a bunch of video games on a watch?"
"Maybe you should get help."
It's basically a replica of the universe that you came from, but as I told you before you left, it's not exactly the same. There is some paradox in the process of transcription, some space-time turbulence. Simply put, the data is wrong. And it's nascent, fragile, and squeezed by the regional warps caused by collisions and friction with other parallel universes nearby. If we don't fix these errors and resist the pressure now, it will crumble very quickly."
"No need. Just two of us, and you stay."
"I knew it, I knew it, I didn't have to try this time! You're so awesome, I'm staring straight at you. I completely forgot to open the door for myself." Spider-Man Said.
"Avengers Mansion, thank you. If you haven't seen me today, I'll give you twice as much." Tony said to the driver.
"That's what you'll have to find out for yourself. I've given you enough information today."
"It looks like a real person only. Mr. Krats built it to look after the shop, to clean, to cook, to secure, to chat... But at the moment all it seems to do is just chat, and its answers are baffling."
"It's so easy. We've never touched this layer before."
When Tony turned to the third to last page, there was a single line in the dense code. Not code, not numbers, not symbols, but a line of text. Tony caught it.
"Tasha, you can't go." Wanda held Tasha.
"You said you were saved by this boy? I'm confused." Seth said.
"Go? Go where?"
Steve shook his head, just as he had done that day, hopelessly wiped off the sleeping Tony, put him to bed. He knew this was going to happen.
"No, I want. It's just that I'm worried about you..."
"On foot."
"Probably..."
"That means we've got nothing again." Said Peter gloomily.
"Young master Antony, you are too much in the way. You didn't hold an umbrella in such heavy rain. I'll get you a cup of hot chocolate."
Tony opened the door. Jarvis came in.
A fast-food restaurant near Empire State University.
"Well, they want to stay and help, they want to, but the mission in New York desperately needs their help..." There was sweat underneath Peter's mask.
"Whom?"
"You asked a girl out." Peter repeated the words mechanically.
“Don't do it!”
The kiss grew warm. As they parted, Tony's eyes were full of lust.
Steve did not speak. He sat quietly beside Tony. Tony felt someone sitting next to him. Subconsciously, he thought it was Jarvis. Without thinking, he hugged the man next to him.
Now everyone knew who Tony was talking about. At that moment, a big green hand parted the crowd and pushed Thor aside.
A tear in the corner of Steve's eye froze on the cold winter day.
"Tony......"
"You go first, Wanda. I'll be there." Steve said. "What's up, Hank?”
“What's the matter?”
Tony's Longest Day 06
Steve threw his arms around Bucky's neck before he could finish his sentence. He made such a big move that the closet door burst open. They tumbled to the floor.
"Okay."
"What have I done?”
He turned his head sideways, started biting Steve's earlobe. "Kiss me... hug me, touch me and... Fuck me... Don't you want me? You've been thinking about that since the rainy day, haven't you?"
"Hwy cunnan thou secgan se? Wit brothers. alatan me, mine eald freond Tony ne wendan. Is se macie thee earm? I witan se thou faran to Grand Canyon to secan se weg of Hawkeye. Hwy wendan anlice seon thou and Hawkeye?(Why would thou say that? We are brothers. Let me guess, my old friend Tony hasn't turned up yet. Is that making you upset? I had heard that you two went to the Grand Canyon to search for the trail of Hawkeye. Why only see you and Hawkeye return?)"
"Jarvis, get me a cup of coffee and take it to the lab." Bucky said.
"Unfortunately, we can't do that. That timeline is moving exactly as it should. The Old Tony Stark of that Earth must be brought back to life. The universes must balance. I can't disturb the balance."
"John, please, please, I'll give you the money, you can't take it." Cried his mother.
"I agreed with Clint this time, mainly because of the recent skyrocketing maintenance costs of the simulation training room." Tasha said deadpan. "In this case, let's close the meeting. Happy New Year, everyone."
"The whole world knows that Captain America never falls down. Captain America never makes mistakes." Tony said.
"He should have only come back for the money. As long as he digs out the money hidden by Mum, he will leave. Then he will go to a nearby speakeasy and not be back until morning. With any luck, he won't notice the shirts in the yard. If I'm not in front of his eyes, he won't notice me. He doesn't notice me, I won't get hit. We'll be safe...” Steve whispered to Bucky.
"Is that so? I whipped Whiplash with a little gadget which I put together in the kitchen. The transformation of physical form that your ace Spymaster used was the same technique as the transformation of Ghost. It was just a different package of density and frequency, nothing new, easy to crack." Tony said.
"I've finished mine."
"Shh... Be quiet. Come with me." He whispered to Bucky, took Bucky's hand and gently opened the back door a small crack. He propped the door with his hand.
Tony 19
"Three, two, one, zero... One minute is up. Don’t blame me. You guys don't run. Now, let us start playing." The boy with brown hair struck a fighting pose.
"Iron Man... Now the fact is..." Libra chimes in.
Tony looked back at Steve, and stepped forward.
"Interesting, how did he run away from under the noses of the two Avengers, you and Captain America?" Doom lifted his voice.
"Then I'll throw you into the Atlantic Ocean."
When Tony arrives, Steve is in the middle of a fight with Electro. His shield is struck by Electro's light, and the electric current from Vibranium is directed through Steve's body, causing him to tremble.
"Hush."
"I remember you." Tony said quickly.
"I thought you liked the Captain America story better."
"It's not my home anymore. It's the home of the Avengers. It was his home. I want to stay away from everything that once belonged to him, avoid all the people he knew."
"I don't want to talk about it privately right now." Tony stressed the word "private" and knocked Steve's hand off his shoulder.
"But I'm not going to let you go back now." Doom said.
"Are you sure, Cap?" Tasha asked.
"Actually, I think so too, but my friend Bucky likes him."
He sat down on the doorstep, recovered his breath, quickly propped his slate on his lap, and pretended to be absorbed in his work, while in fact his eyes drifted from time to time to the south. He was waiting for her to show up, for the blonde girl to show up. She was coming... He caught a glimpse of her red figure, bent his head quickly to paint on the slate. He held on to the brush, trying not to shake his hands, which were now perspiration inside them and on his forehead.
"Well, the beginning is in Grand Canyon Libra’s thing. Hawkeye has already told you about that, right?" Tony said.
"But I think we'd better get out of here before Tasha and others come back and catch us. I thought you wanted to see the World War II memorial in D.C.? Since today is to make up your last vacation."
Tony successfully broke through the perimeter defense system of the Bain Tower. He stretched out a finger of the gauntlet, gently cut an entrance on the 62nd floor glass of the building, and slipped in. He called out the main structure of the Bain Tower via satellite. Based on the configuration settings, he estimated that their mainframe was between 60 and 70 floors. He decided to go in first. If he could locate the frequency signal of the designs internally, he would be able to find their mainframe.
So, Steve, suppressing the smile, made a gesture, reaching for Iron man with one hand. "Take me back to the castle, my knight."
"Maybe two lifetimes."
"Now it's... HMM..."
"That's bad news. Dr. Marvel isn't in New York, and anyone who can open the door for us to walk right across isn't in New York. We must go back ourselves."
A moment later...
Time passed imperceptibly by them. By the time Tony noticed it was nearly midnight, they were the last two people in the restaurant. Tony pulled out her chair, put a coat around her.
"You see, I don't live in the neighbourhood. I'm new to this area. I had just been running away..."
"Tasha, I'll bet you, Cap done with his penance."
"Thor, why don't you tell me the details of what happened? I'm really sorry I wasn't there with you at that time." Steve knows Thor likes to tell stories about battles, and he was kind enough to bring it up.
"At that time, he was being beaten up, and he was too stubborn to beg for mercy. You know, in case he got killed in an accident... Er, protecting rare species is everyone's responsibility."
Stark International Suburb Facility, Buffalo, New York State, underground testing field.
"We've done each other a favor, I should say." Mr. Krats said.
Maybe 10 seconds, maybe 30 seconds, maybe longer...
"I knew it."
"He is a bit strange, but he must be a good man. He adopted you. Best of all, he was moving here so I can see you more often. Although you can't go to school with me. Why can't you come to school with me?”
"Don't think you can fool everyone with what you did in the Grand Canyon caves." Hawkeye said.
"You don't have to please everyone, Tony. It's just that you, as one of the founders of the Avengers, should be a little more careful and a little more sensible about things like that. So that the Avengers can... and I can..."
"You can talk to Dr. Pym. He may have a different opinion."
"You've never been a party guy, Cap." Tasha was pleased too, and made a joke.
"Young Genius, have you forgotten?
"I've been thinking about it since last night." Tony put his arms around Steve, gave him a long deep kiss.
I have an S+ contact? I didn't even know that. It seems that I still need to tweak this new system. Tony played the message.
Then the door of the room was flung open, a bright light came in, waking him from the nightmare. He rubbed his eyes, sat up half asleep. After about 30 seconds, his eyes adapted to the change in light, seeing the intruder.
"Sorry, Paige, he couldn't recognize you, so he didn't prepare yours, drink of mine." Steve passed his soda to Paige.
"But it's not irreparable..."
Tony was crouching on the roof, his armor tucked into his backpack. He was just Tony Stark again, 19-year-old Tony Stark.
What is the topic of that paper? Tony had completely forgotten about it. He added to the memo: Paper due by the end of the week, priority 5.
“There's something I think we should talk about seriously, Thor. I know he has been your friend for many years. He may be more cautious, more able to coordinate all kinds of relations, but I am not him. Well, I'm kind of straightforward, so I'm going to be honest with you. You've been roaming the earth for thousands of years, you know our language, and you can speak our language. So, when you're with us, can you modify the way you speak a little bit? I mean, could you speak human words? I really don't understand God's words." Tony said.
"Thank God, Iron Man being around, everyone got out of there. And thank you, Tony, for being injured but staying out of the SICU room all night." Kris touched Tony's hand on her sickbed. A little blush came over her face.
"It can be remedied, that's great!" Tony heaved a sigh of relief. "What should I send him now to make it up to him?”
"You're going to art school in the future, so we need to save more money."
"Well, Captain, oh, S... Steve, what are we going to do now?" Tony relaxed, laughed too.
"I'm so cold. Let's go back. Light a fire, get some of Jarvis's hot tea, in case I catch a cold. “
"Thank you, Tasha, you're really... I really... Thank you so much." This time it was Tony who was speechless.
"Uh, I won't catch a cold." Steve said with a smile.
Spider stood back.
The girl's hand dropped.
Thankfully, it's no longer the center of attention in the drawing room. Spiddy, who had been granted amnesty, immediately ran to the corner and turned off the old phonograph, in place of rhythmic electronic rock and roll. The crowd clapped and cheered.
"I feel sorry for you, I really do." The golden-mask girl's words echoed in Peter's ears.
"We don't have to. I bet he's fine." Hawkeye said, neither salty nor light.
"Party at Avengers Mansion."
Hawkeye's strategy was simple and pragmatic, with one acting as bait, directly letting the person behind the scenes walk from the dark to the light; the other one lurking behind, allowing the mercenaries to lead them directly to the secret base. In the dispute about who should be the bait, Spider-Man lost rock-paper-scissors, so he is here.
Chapter 11
"Have you given her a new name?"
"Technically she was my girlfriend 10 years ago, but that's relative to her time, my time she is still my current girlfriend from two weeks ago. You know I still have feelings for her. She's really beautiful.
Dr. Octopus and the Zodiac are getting together. This thing is more and more strange.
"Sorry, please mail the bill for the damaged items to Maria Foundation." He directly hit open the computer, took out the circuit board inside.
"Well, I don't particularly want to sell them, but as things stand, they're the only big payers left." Krats said with a shrug. "You must have a pistol in your drawer, the one you're going to shoot yourself in the head tonight. You can shoot me with it now."
"My name is Tony Stark, I think I need a lawyer." Tony said awkwardly.
The attack on the Zodiac happened three days ago. It was a sunny day. Tony held a map, walking on the campus of Columbia University. He may be a genius engineer who can build a machine with a glance at a schematic, but he also has no sense of direction. He circled around the campus but couldn't find the way to the registration center. When he finally found it, the popular professor's science class was already full. He had to go next door to professor Elden, whom the old birds called "Western Witch." When the queue reached him, he was scared stiff by the professor in front of him. This professor, known as Western Witch, is Meredith McCall. She was his girlfriend from MIT before his time-travel. Tony gave up his MIT studies now because he is afraid of meeting people he knew. He couldn't explain why he would continue to take MIT classes 10 years later and still look the same as 10 years ago. However, nobody can predict, the past still finds him. No wonder the ebullient blonde became a "Witch". She was dumped by Tony for no reason, married a cryonics scientist, had an unhappy marriage, and finally divorced. She still uses her ex-husband's last name. Tony didn’t pay attention until it was too late. Tony didn't believe that he would not be recognized when he walked in front of her. He didn't know whether he should be fortunate, but the power was cut off at this time, and the entire campus fell into darkness. It should be said that the entire New York City fell into darkness.
"Remember that 'deep' thing we talked about before? I think I'm ready." There was a husky temptation in Tony's voice.
"He deserves it." Steve said.
"Aha, that train. Looks like they did."said Hawkeye, turning to the next page.
"It's my business if this guy is a traitor."
Tony stood by her bed, looking mournfully at the woman whom he had once loved and still admired lying lifeless.
Carbonell laughed.
"Ha-ha......" Steve looked down at Tony and laughed. "Tasha, you heard Iron Man. He and I are dealing with a personal affair and we can't attend. Happy New Year."
"Well, on the bright side, at least the earth won't be destroyed tomorrow."
"Or you just don't want to listen to an old man’s nagging."
"You broke my motorbike. I can't keep up with you, I suppose." Steve stood up, walked to the window, spoke to the red flames that were fading away in the twilight.
Grand Canyon, The Secret Base of the Zodiac.
Chapter 13
Tony's frustration didn't last long. Ten minutes later he sat up, put on his watch, pressed a few buttons, called up a memo, adding: upgrade armor system, add auto-cleaning, medical repair and auto-pilot sleep assistance. priority 5 stars.
“Butan mine Mjolnir, mine froend...(But my Mjolnir, my friend...)”
"I was going to come back with a compliment, but who knows? I'll never come back. Nice work, Tony. Shooting Hulk made me feel so good." The second, Hawkeye came up, patted Tony on his shoulder.
"Iron Man?! How did you come to England? How did you get into this channel? Mudslide? What the hell is that? Is this a prank?" Said the driver in a thick Yorkshire accent.
"I'll introduce you formally next time. What's even better is that she has a beautiful red-headed roommate, Melony, who is recently single. I asked her to introduce you so we can go on a double date. Forget Mary Jane. It's been a long time. It's time you moved on."
"Take off your shoes before you come in, don’t make the floor dirty. Mother will be angry." Seth urged.
You don't have to despair. There are other ways. When Hank gets back, we should discuss it with him. He is an expert in the field of cell biology. And we have a Young Genius, don’t we? Nothing is can’t be solved."
"Mr. Fantastic? I'll go to him if you don't tell me."
Bain's bed was wide and soft and comfortable. Her body was as soft and comfortable as Tony had imagined. She and his previous women were not the same, not a trace of shyness and coyness, but total indulgence. It unleashed the wild and sensual side of Tony. He can do without scruples and compassion. He got into her with such force. She screamed, and then groaned unrestrained.
Clint couldn't help but wonder, does this guy really have superpowers? No matter how, he looks so easy to die.
"Doctor Octopus, you've been a model prisoner this time, didn't escape" Tony said.
"Sort of." Steve said.
Tony opened his eyes; Steve had approached the door of the simulation training room. The sound of his voice also returned to captain normal.
"Tony! It's not a fuss over, it's..." Steve's last words were silenced by Tony's kiss.
"Peter, maybe you should consider moving into Avengers Mansion. Many Avengers live there. Although Avengers are not subsidized now, at least board and apartment are still free. You can save a lot of money."
"Now that he is dead, the memory of that time makes me feel more deeply about him and miss him” Bain's voice elongated, as if expressing sadness.
"I'm a little worried about him. X-Men are a little worried about him..."
"But Einstein..." Tony quibbled.
After dodging another attack from Electro, Tony told the system, "Concentrate all the energy on Uni-Beam. Fire!"
"I'm going for ice cream." He saw an ice cream truck not far away and ran past Steve.
"So, I have another plan. We drag this unconscious guard in there disguised as you. You follow me into the lab."
"Actually, I have a confession to make too." Tony said.
"Wait a minute, this isn't an annual treat, is it?"
"Did I mention that it's fool to sit still for hours?"
"What?!"
"We just didn't talk about it in depth, or had no time to think about it, or didn't want to define it. The life of a superhero is like this. Every time out of the task you don’t know if you can come back or not, don't know if today is the last day of your life, don't know if this is the last time we met... So we valued the present more. I didn't want these preciously established relationships to just fall apart."
"I'm not asking you that. I've already read this in the Avengers database. I want to know what the database doesn't have. How did you two get hooked up?" Tony cut to the chase this time.
"Tony, you've been in the lab for five days, and you haven't eaten for almost two days."
"You know, it's a different league. One is the domestic league, another is the international, which is higher. Wait a moment, the distinction between them early before you have been deep frozen."
"Have you been stumped by your Univ assignment?" Steve asked gently.
"I'm on my way." Krats noticed Mrs. Rogers's little movement. His eyes rested on the larger bruise on Mrs. Rogers's wrist.
"Didn't I tell Tasha?"
"You go in first and wait for me in the kitchen."
"What do you mean 'his man', which means you already knew about their relationship, so why were you so devastated when I told you?"
"Thanks, teach. I appreciate you taking your valuable time to help a desk Jockey with his neuroses."
"Aha, captain, also wants to use the old way to deal with me. My new employer did a comprehensive upgrade of my equipment. Today is different. Tony Stark, you coward, hiding behind and just talking, letting someone else fight for you?"
"Who said he was tired? He may have fallen asleep again."
"I have a present for you." Tony handed Peter a backpack. "On your back, just push the button on your chest. I was gonna wait until your birthday, or something special, but I thought what the hell, today's a special day. It's only 1.0..."
"How do you know I cooked it?"
“Love?" Tony hesitated. "Actually, Wanda, I -- I didn't want to use the word 'love' to define the relationship between me and him. It just happened, and I just let it happen. My feeling for him is not so much love, much like it is attraction that I don't understand, or the hormonal response of a creature."
To be continued……
"This cave is too big. I'm lost." Hawkeye's vague explanation.
"Then you should know the consequences. If you return from this time node "as you were" now, you will face only one fate. You will become That-TonyStark, the man you stopped a year ago. I have no problem with you becoming him, but do you want that outcome?"
"No need to deny ‘you're Iron Man’." Spymaster said.
"Yes, I did. I can't use any of these things he's put on. Every time I enter my room, I have to say the password ten times. The password was changed every hour. After three mistakes, the alarm system would be activated, the entire mansion would automatically shut down. Once, I couldn't remember the password at that time. I was locked out of my room in the middle of the night. The alarms went off all over the mansion. Everyone got up, thought we were being invaded. I had to call him back from his beach house and let him deal with it."
"What if a ‘Superhero Daily’ happens?"
"I made it, didn't I?
"Yes."
"They just went so far away. People forgot about them. When I grow up, I can go far away, I can find them."
"Uh... It was not for you... And that doesn't mean anything. It was just that... I thought..." Here Tony stopped.
We cannot guarantee that every decision made by those in charge will be the right one, or the just one, or the selfless one, but we can make sure that each of them doesn’t view the rest of the family as less important than the one they love most. Cap wouldn't trade your life or mine or anyone else's life for Tony's, and Tony wouldn't trade anyone else's life for Cap's. That's what's special about them, that's what's special about Avengers, that's what's special about this family. We protect the world and each other."
"I see..."
"Because Ste... Because Cap is giving the newcomers a wilderness surviving class."
"What? Tony."
Tony felt the man in his arms shocked, his T-shirt was also pulled up by him. He felt the rough callus of his fingers brushing his exposed skin. Got you, Tony thought with a smile.
“What?”
"Is it true that the Avengers illegally entered the UK through the Order of Arcane?"
So Steve followed his lead and didn't resist. He felt Tony's kiss on his lips again, and he opened his lips slightly to accept the entrance of his tongue. When the kiss was over, his lust for Tony intensified. He squinted at the familiar and somewhat unfamiliar man. Mature and childlike in Tony's face, giving Steve a more hazy sense of unreality.
"You mean that motorbike?" Tony said as he fired a repulsor at the motorbike, which fell apart in a split second.
Kris pulled Tony up and ran back to the house. Sure enough, Seth had dinner ready. He glared at Tony. Tony pretended not to notice and sat down next to Kris. Mrs. DeGann led a prayer before dinner. Tony followed the Romans, even though he did not believe in God. Then the atmosphere warmed up. Kris was talking and telling stories of what she had seen in New York. Tony added now and then. Seth lived up to his reputation as a good cook. Tony had eaten more than he had in a long time. After dinner, Mrs. DeGann sat under the Christmas tree digging out old photographs and telling Tony stories about Kris as a kid. Kris sat beside him, interjected from time to time. With Peter as a playmate, Gatlin and Elise didn't want anyone else, so Peter was busy taking care of the kids until they were sleepy enough to fall asleep. For Tony and Peter, it was indeed the first special Christmas of their lives. Perhaps it was Seth's dinner that finally put Tony to sleep after midnight.
Steve didn't answer. He just hugged Tony, and gave him a long kiss. He relished the taste of the ice cream in Tony's mouth, first sweet, then bitter with a hint of coffee and walnuts.
"Sometimes public identity isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it, Tony?" Steve smiled. "As long as you're doing the right thing in your identity."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. was hiding the truth. She's been in Europe. But after all this, we're just friends now." Steve said.
"Kris, we gave Elise your previous room, so you'll have to share a bed with her tonight. We didn't have a guest room, so I asked Gatlin to sleep with me. I'm clearing Gatlin's room for both of you. If you don't want to share a bed, one of you will have to sleep in the barn. Trust me, it's not a good idea to sleep in a barn this season." Seth said.
“Because of the quake, Zzzz... Boulders rolled down, Zzzz... Evacuate people to the higher slope... Zzzz, the specific location is... Did you hear me?"
"I... I'm not... in order for you...to do......"
"Why are you still here? Are you going to stay the night?"
"Stand down, soldiers. Evacuate the people, let the Avengers take on this monster."
"Let's go." After a while, Tony suppressed his laughter.
"The knife flew into my face, you didn't move. I really thought you were too old, too slow to come. My long speech was almost lost."
"Today I'm going to bring all of Manhattan to my white wedding!"
"So, you're doubting some of us... "Jane glanced out of the mask girl in the back row.
The light in the room was dim, and the lights on the computer were flashing. Bain, dressed in a black transparent silk nightgown, carrying a bottle of champagne and two empty glasses, walked slowly up to the Iron Man.
There was a loud explosion, more guards rushed this way. Brushing the dust off, Spider stood back to back with Captain, took up a fighting position. This time it is my turn to fight. Spider thought happily. Then he swung the spider silk, kicked down a masked agent who rushed in front of him.
Avengers Mansion, now.
"I want to kiss you all the time, but let's get back to work. Let me see how many super criminals we still need to catch." Tony shrugged when he saw the figures. "Wow, Surprises! It looks like we'll all be busy till tomorrow dawn."
The next division of Avengers is called “British Avengers”? -- The Guardian
Chapter 06
"It's also bad news. We must penetrate its armor before we can carry out our original plan. Its armor is created by dark psychic forces, which constantly absorb the psychic forces of crowd around it for energy, forming a protective shield around it."
“Who is he you are talking about?" Tony said.
"She was just an 'assistant'. I wouldn't have fired her if she knew the word 'personal'. I'm your partner, aren't I? And your best friend. Well, at least one of your best friends. If someone is around your best friend... So..."
"Paige, you're here." Steve stepped forward in surprise.
"My arms are stiff. Can you hold them in different positions?"
"No big deal. Hawkeye was beaten, once by Tony, once by me." Steve said.
"Come on, let me introduce for you. This is Coop, and this is Friedman, and our brother Boyle. We'll be one family."
"He did..." Steve smiled a little long. "The next day I told him to take it apart."
Then he quipped: "If all three-line masks are like this, I should apply for more."
30 km away, Colorado Riverside.
“How much did you tell her? "asked Tony, a little worried.
"I am really quiet drinking. It's not good for the superhero profession." A witty sense of humor abandoned Tony today. He gave a stiff answer.
"It's... He... He's Iron Man. A hero."
"I don't want to draw undue attention to myself and I don't want you to release my name publicly, as we agreed to do."
"Except for yourself. I see. So call me mad. You're ready to kill yourself anyway, and what harm is here in bringing in another madman?"
"So, you took me into the corner on purpose?"
A secret base in a cave on an uninhabited island in the Atlantic Ocean.
The other boys laughed too, and slowly gathered around the brown-haired boy.
The Black Widow jabbed him with her elbow. But it was no wonder Hawkeye’s blunt question. Generally, the representative of the X-Men sent to knock on the door of the Avengers, even if it is not the boss Professor X, after all, he is inconvenient. At least one will be a professor-level figure such as Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, etc. It would be more fun if they sent over their relatives, the Beast. Gambit is an outsider in the X-Men franchise, and he doesn't know the Avengers very well. If they needed him to come to their door with a message, something big was going to happen to the X-Men.
“Of course, Tony. I swear, I won't tell anyone." Kris said.
"Er... I seem to have ruined the painting I wanted to give you." Steve looked down at the splash of dye on his board.
"Someone's broken through the outer defenses!" Almost all the guards of the cavern were running towards the opening.
The change of things made Tony a little unable to keep up with the rhythm. He was stunned.
Tony's prediction is right. Frostbite's attacks get lower and lower, finally subdued by them. S.H.I.E.L.D. put him in the prison van.
"Spider sense... Spider is not a bug. Are you sure this is a good plan? With your dazzling red and yellow swaggering in there? At least I can climb the walls quietly."
"I want to go to a distant place, too. I'm not looking for superheroes. I just want to be far away. Get out of the block, get out of the city, get out of the country, drift across the ocean in a boat. But my brother always says that girls shouldn't go too far away, it's not safe."
Peter stood up and walked out of the restaurant. Tony wanted to run after him, but he looked around at the two girls. Melony, in particular, had a disappointed look on her face. He sat down again.
Steve stood up, pushed open the door and went out. He slipped down the narrow corridor, almost tripping over a toy the children had dropped. He shook his head and smiled as he reached down to pick up the toy. He set it on the table in the living room downstairs. Then he went out of the house, across the yard, opened the gate, and went into the street. He walked against the wind, felt a sense of relief in the night breeze.
"Happy New Year, Tony."
"From when I decided to come with you to the future, stop his conspiracy, I've made my choice."
"Why go so far away? You can do research here, on Earth. You'll come back, right? You'll come back, won't you?" Peter's tears would fall again.
"Listen, the mudslide is less than a kilometer away. You've got to get out. I'll catch up." Tony carried a wounded man from under the building and handed him to a policeman nearby.
Just as Hawkeye said, Iron Man flew out the other side of the cliff, landed firmly on the ground. Steve was surprised, stood up and hugged him.
Chapter 32
There you are. Steve was smiling.
Iron Man got down on one knee and bowed. "Comply with your wish, my princess."
"You'll stay?! Do you mean to say..."
"Steve..."
"You have the figures for the night?"
"Pursued?!" An anxiety came from Jane's face. "Have you found out who is behind this?"
In the corner, Steve was holding Tony for a slow dance. Before this dance, Tony danced three times with Jane, two times with Wanda and two times with Crystal. He even danced with Tasha once. Finally, Steve couldn't hold up, went to the DJ and asked him to play an old tune.
"Am I hallucinating? Only three hours ago you saddled me with a terrible secret I didn't want to know."
"You made a worse mistake by teasing me." Steve gave Tony a hot look and Tony gave him an emotional smile in return.
"Did you line on the Avengers mansion system, find anything?"
He hid in the closet of his room, even in this small space did not make him feel safe.
"That's exactly what's happening now. As you know, this universe is a parallel universe that was created at the point where the pocket universe met your original earth, before your memory was overwritten.
"Tomorrow we're having a founder vote meeting to decide if Spider-Man will become a full member. It's late today and everyone is in a party mood. Let's meet tomorrow, Tony, is that all right? '
Then don't leave me. Victor said to himself.
"Only 30 seconds, Giant Man ready, 3.2.1..."
"That was your plan, wasn't it? I was the bait. After swinging for so long, have you shaved enough skin?"
"Thirty-two minutes and 45 seconds."
"I'm just a little good neighbor Spiderman. Besides, now, I'm on the stage of Captain America and Iron Man, so I'm going to play a supporting role."
To be continued......
"Oh my God, give me a break. Why am I teaming up with that weird guy whose mouth doesn't sit idle for a minute? His brain circuits are not human." Hawkeye beside Widow protested. "Is that Cap's advice?"
"Mine froend, thou habbe afre snotor, butan dysig in se leoht ping, eall for in lufu. Ha-ha.(My friend, you have always been wise, but fatuous and unresolved in this obvious thing, all because of the involvement. Ha-ha.)" Thor laughed, patted Steve on the shoulder.
"I can lift the shield."
Kris, next to him, is a little upset at Tony.
"Didn’t you use the same banner you used to celebrate Thor’s birthday last time to save money? It's almost like whitewashing the two zeros at the end of 2000 and putting a grinning shell head in that place." Tony said.
"No. You're not a coward. You're the bravest one I've ever met. Remember the last time we met, you challenged six or seven boys twice as strong as you to protect your mother's reputation?"
"Not exactly. He is an Android, not a robot."
Tony ran the test on it, frowned.
"What?" Tony was curious.
"Steve, Steve..." Tony's body was calling the name, too.
Tony 19
After brute force failed, Spider had to do one last thing, Yelling:
"Huh?"
They slid along the wall to the bedroom door. Steve opened the door a tiny crack and cocked his head to Bucky to come in. Bucky knowingly went in, and Steve followed. Then Steve closed the door. He pulled Bucky into a closet and closed the door. The whole thing was quiet.
Tony and Peter jumped out of the carriage after Kris.
Peter opened his eyes wide and nudged Tony, who was not sure if he was asleep.
"Nice to meet you... Thank you for saving me, teaching me to swim, not dislike me, also willing to, willing to accompany me...... That really means a lot to me..."
"I want my old one."
"Deeper and deeper?"
"So, do you regret it?"
"But you like Barrel Monster, don't you? Today I will listen carefully to his story."
"No, I've made a lot of mistakes. If it hadn't been him, I would make a mistake that I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Shortly after I joined the Avengers, I met Zemo, the man who killed Bucky. Despite Iron Man's objection, I followed Zemo to South America alone. I beat Zemo, but I didn't stop. I grabbed Zemo's neck... The scene of Bucky falling from the plane was magnified. Resentment around my head. Then he was in... The charter he had framed in the Mansion; the room he had made for me; the uniforms he had hung in my wardrobe; the shield he had mended on my desk... Although I didn't use any of the high-tech equipment in that room, it made me feel that the world was not so strange. Revenge resentment suddenly seemed less important than anything else I had gained, so my grip on Zemo's neck loosened."
"The good news is that your spider sense worked really well and there were real blizzards in 32 states across the US. The Avengers are seriously undermanned and we need to get back immediately."
"Kris!" Tony cried in surprise.
"Don’t treat yourself as an old man just because your old teammates are old or dead. What is someone saying in that perfectly righteous sentence? 'Their life is their life; Your life is your life'. So, live in the moment, don't be a man out of time.
Holding a bundle of sticks, Tony was walking unpleasantly.  Beside him was the golden mask girl. After eavesdropping the earlier conversation between Steve and Jane, he kind of understands her awkward position. Living in Avengers Mansion, not being trusted by chairwomen.
"Scientific aid." Peter added.
Tony froze. The same feverish. The surreal feeling that he had felt that day in the simulation training room back into Tony's blood. He couldn't feel his own heartbeat; He couldn't feel his own breath; He couldn't even feel anything around himself. He forgot, he forgot it was the door to the hospital SICU; He forgot all the mess that had happened recently; He forgot Kris. All he could feel was Steve. He felt his breath, felt his heartbeat, felt the rough callus with his thumb resting on his lips. He could only hear his words, some kinds of warm thick, mixed with a hint of hoarseness now. He could only see his Adam's Apple rolling, lips opening and closing, sadness rising in his blue eyes.
"Master Steve your soda. Master Krats your soda."
"I'm just guessing. Old people all love it."
"I'm just flattered." Tony said, holding out his hand.
"I feel like the DJ is giving me a hard time tonight, playing modern pop all the time. The old man doesn’t know how to dance and they can keep taking you away." Steve said.
“Is it?”
"Thankfully, his heart hasn't completely stopped beating yet. I'm going to reverse the airship's power to the implant in his chest. Hoping it works."
Peter, watching Seth leave, breathed a sigh of relief. He returned to the farm, opened the Yellow pages, grabbed the phone on the wall, prepared to alert neighboring farms. Because of the earthquake, the telephone lines were down. Peter had to pick up the local map next to him. The nearest village is two kilometers away. He took the map into his arms and rushed out of the farm, preparing to launch spider silk and swing over. He looked around and saw that there were no tall buildings for him to climb, not even a few big trees. Of course, this is the highlands. Peter remembered the tragedy... He pulled back the silk sadly and ran in the rain to the next farm as fast as he could. It's horrible to be in a place without tall buildings. I still fit in as a neighbor in New York... The drenched Peter thought.
"Do you think a shake of your dark hair, a sunny smile, and a little sweet compliment would make whole world girls throw themselves into your arms? Maybe the previous owner of this mask will, but I won't!”
"Tony, beg me... "Steve whispered in Tony's ear.
"I know you miss the snow at Christmas in New York."
"You asshole, can't you thank us for throwing you a party when our money is so tight?" Hawkeye said, carefully concealed the altered brush.
"I hope you won't make me regret my decision today." Said Tony, lifting his gauntlets, knocking the rock out of the hole.
Tony was afraid to say too much to Kris. He didn't know what Peter was talking about, so he calmly said, "Excuse me, I'm going to talk to my teammate Spider-Man about the mission."
The first scan failed. Sweat beaded Tony's forehead. Such systems typically activate an alert system after three or more errors. The Avengers mansion is equipped with the same encryption. Tony knows it all too well. I knew I'd take my iris data, test it at the Avengers Mansion, but now I have to take a gamble.
"No, he hasn’t."
"Ask Hank about a school lesson? I shall be laughed at." Tony said.
Chapter 08
"Which one of us didn't make a mistake? Cap gave all of us a second chance."
"The essence of a person doesn’t change."
To be continued......
"You are too late, now we have no money. When he died, we were strapped for cash on Jane's support alone. I think Tasha will scold me for ruining the Quinjet this time. I'm afraid we can't afford a new one."
"If Dani goes missing, Elise will never forgive me again." Now Seth was worried.
Spider-Man, Level S Contact: Tony, I did a preliminary analysis of the minerals you gave me. It contains quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, pyrite... and traces of an unidentified crystalline substance, suspected to be non-earth material, that required further analysis against the Avengers' database.
There were too many opponents, the armor was confiscated by Steve, the only fighter golden mask girl was down. And he didn't think the self-defense skills Steve had taught him would work against these professional killers. So, he pretended to be in a coma, right into their base to find out who they were. Anyway, the wristwatch is still working. When they let down their guard, he can contact Steve with the watch. Hoping he wasn't too stupid to know how to use it. From time to time, he opened his eyes, secretly remembered signs along the road. At last, they came to a cave.
"I knew it. Before you opened this dusty box, you pretended to wipe your shield a hundred times, peeked at me 200 times. You're tired of waiting, aren't you? In this case, I can only start with a topic that is distracting enough for you. In fact, I don't want to see the old photos in that box so much, I'm more focused on the present. Who knows? Maybe tomorrow we will encounter Hulk and die. "Tony rearranged his toolbox, put it back in armor’s hiding space.
"I confess, I was glad to let you play around. I haven't felt happiness like this for a long time, you know, since he... Well, if someone is going to take the blame for this, it's on both of us.
"Ungrateful. Who saved you just now?"
"I know the weather is tough to get out of. The house is a little small. We haven't had a chance to be alone these past few days. And Seth is a little fierce." Kris whispered in Tony's ear. "The good news is that Seth is busy cooking Christmas Eve dinner and the two kids are helping to cause trouble in the kitchen, so we can sneak out to the barn."
"What? Why are you both looking at me? I'm not ready to move back yet. I was just thinking, I think Jarvis has changed the title to you."
"Tony, stop messing about, I really need to..."
"Yes, that home." Tony answered.
"I can introduce other girls to you." Tony said.
"You followed me?!" Tony said.
Then Tony solemnly spoke to the contact on the Jet. "It's nice Cap remembers when time to throw a party. I'm looking forward too, Black Widow."
"I quit! Are you all satisfied now?" Tony fired up his jet boots and flew straight through the open window.
"Nice. Good follow through. You may not be ready for prize fight just yet, but you should be able to handle street punks and the like."
"Bucky? What's wrong with you? Does the request make it difficult for you?" Steve pushed the distracted Bucky.
"Yes. But Tony suggested it first. Cap agreed."
Suspicion filled Tony, but he didn't interrupt, waiting for Doctor Octopus to continue.
"Attention, everybody! I have something to say."
"I'll try, I'll try, Pe... Spider-Man." Tony was amused by Peter.
"The good news is there's not much damage, just a few scratches on the wings. The bad news is that my armor is broken. No automatic diagnosis system. I need to check it myself. I can't fly."
Mr. Sanchez, Level A Contact: Mr. Stark, we are very interested in your Starktron project. You can set up A time to talk more about it.
"Lizzy, will you take Maria to Stark's mansion first? I'll have Hansen escort you there. I have a few business matters to discuss with Mr. Krats."
"Think twice, give me a hand." Steve said with a smile. "But there's no gadget in my sleeve that can open this door easily."
Krats was sitting in a cafe across from 890 Fifth Avenue. He looked at the newly built Stark Mansion in a trance. Today there was to be an inaugural ball at the mansion. Car after car of celebrities arrived at the door. Jarvis went in and out to greet the guests. He was the father of the Jarvis he knew, and they looked very similar. The scene made Krats feel at home from a lifetime ago.
"It seems you were lucky to find another channel in time." Hawkeye interjected with a hint of irony.
"But I'm not sleepy yet." Tony said quietly.
Epilogue—— 02
"Satisfied?"
"Yes, she should warn you."
"But he's still him." Spiddy said, not afraid to be shot.
"He built it; he created a mess. That final good deed couldn’t make up for the evil he had done!" A burst of pent-up anger, Tony held his head, squatted down on the ground.
"Yes, old man, Thor was dancing with Hellcat."
"ZiZi... Wanda... ZiZI... I..." Vision closed his eyes. His circuit board continued to sizzle. Wanda's tears rolled down her face. She had lost him again.
"Don't move. Let me serve you tonight, all right?" Tony said.
"Bucky, my mom won't be home for a while, so why don't you tell me a story? A story about the barrel-monster."
Hand in hand, they entered the house, took off their shirts, dyeing them red and blue, and hung them on the clothesline in the backyard. They laid side by side under the drying shirts and watched them fluttering in the breeze.
Doom and Tony went into the vortex at the same time. The moment they entered, Doom grabbed Tony. Before Tony knew it, he felt something penetrate his armoured elbow, piercing his skin and injecting fluid into his body. The elbow was a weak joint in this armor, and not many people knew about it, let alone could pierce it with precision. Doom was clearly an armor expert.
"You already know mine, so it's time to exchange CARDS."
"All right, I'll tell you a tale, but don't get used to it. It's only today. I can't put you to bed every day."
"It's spectacular, isn't it? Howard didn't spend less money on it. I can't believe it was built during the Great Depression. With weapons contracts from the Department of Defense, money never seems to be an issue for the Starks. This is my wife Elizabeth and this is my daughter Maria." Carbonell leaned over to introduce his wife and daughter.
"You didn't bring it out?!"
"Fine...... go to the meeting." Tony said with an affectation of indifference.
"You're not just a human being. The Tony I know is not. Iron Man is still the smartest person in the world when he takes off his armor."
"You have no spark for Melony?" Tony recovered himself.
"Now, are we ready for the battle?"
To be continued......
"As you like." Said Tony, shaking Peter by the shoulder and smiling. "There's one more thing, I hope you'll forgive me."
"And in the Grand Canyon... Pete, are you with me?"
The Spymaster was shocked again.
There were closed shops and factories, homeless children, and tramps along the street. Tony, with the appearance of a seven - or eight-year-old, could only find job delivering newspapers.
"Tony, you're tired. Maybe you should sleep and rest." Steve said softly.
"What's the bad news?" Spider-Man chimed in.
"What did Victor say in his college dorm room? It was like, 'Fool, being so close to the screen will ruin your eyeballs. 'So now he says it again."
"This is not a prank. You see for yourself." Tony was now in front of the train, and he opened the armor's glare to illuminate the blocked track.
"Oh, that hurts!"
"Is that enough? Or do I have to do more so you'll listen to me?" As Tony softened, Steve's tone resumed the banter of the two of them alone. "Believe me, I've always wanted to do more after you gave me the night that I'll never forget. But you had been avoiding me, and you would rather see Tasha alone than me when you came back."
Bain doesn't seem to know my true identity is Tony Stark. Otherwise, this woman is so good at acting that she can fool everyone. But anyway, my armor has no power at all now. The backup Spider-Man apparently did not receive my distress signal, otherwise it would not have been delayed so far. No matter how, I have to give up without a fight. It is better to buy the current account of this woman.
"Country trips bore you, right?" Kris was keenly aware of Tony's mood.
"Can the X-Men still send out powerful mind controllers? Cyclops." Steve switched to the contact channel with the X-men.
"My God! Tony, you're working for Avengers, for the greatest heroes in the world. That's amazing!" Kris's eyes lit up with adoration.
"♫ lovely puppy love, loveable first love, likes green apples, green apples sour ♫" He hummed a tune at random.
"At least you guys have money, I am always short of money."
Peter's rescue efforts did not go well. He took Tony's instructions and rushed downstairs. Kris was already down with Elise in her arms. Mrs. DeGann was holding Gatlin by hand.
"But if that man is meant to be a bad seed, it's not just Cap's business. Avengers' survival is at stake."
"Because I had a nagging teacher. I was forced to learn." The brown-haired boy laughed.
"But at least he can bring us drinks." Bucky said.
"Remember, we're not the only ones who know about his crossing."
Oh, my world, I want to grab it. Clearly, my helmet is on why I feel his breath blow to my ears.
"Let's go back. I'm tired." Tony quickened his pace. Tony's usual excuse. He knew he couldn't hide them this time, but he could buy time, sift through what he told Steve.
"What's the use of running away? None of us can hide from what is coming." Said Doctor Octopus. "This late November tornado was not a simple event. It should be part of a global phenomenon."
"What do you think, Cap?"
"Are we having an affair now? Tasha."
"To avoid all the toys being confiscated by teachers, you see?"
"Aha..." Tony was happy again, his depression was gone. He would have kissed the girl in front of him if he hadn't been in such a mess.
"What's good news?" Peter laughed too. He sat down next to Tony.
"What? Tony."
"Wow, Thor. Is this a treasure from Asgard? What?! You bought it at the shop next to the children's hospital? Okay... That's good, too."
"Tony Stark?!" The giver started, then he calmed and said: "You see. All I want to know is' why didn't the poison work on you?’"
“Jarvis, bring me my coat. I'll go to Rogers' again before daylight. At least tell the mother her son is okay. If she gets crushed, we're all screwed."
"Have you ever been up there?"
Tony held on to Steve's hand, sitting astride him, looking down on him. He bent down slowly and gave the old man a gentle kiss. When he wanted to get up, he felt Steve's tongue brush lightly across his lips. A sign of inquiry, so he stepped in again, opened his mouth gently, greeted his inquiry, danced with his tongue, and exchanged eagerness for each other. The kiss grew hot and warm. Without being interrupted, it lasted a long, long time.
Grand Canyon, cavern secret base.
"I don't think it's likely to get clean." Bucky looked down at his shirt. "How about we dye it red, and then we dye yours blue?"
"Only almost, old man? If you just play tricks, you can't get away with it today."
A few of the bead lights on the letter "K" went out, making it look like an "I". A sizzling electric sounded on the rainy night.
"Now I can go back to bed. Happy New Year everyone." Hawkeye got up and left, smashing into Spider-Man as he hurried through the door.
"The one that changed passwords every now and then?"
"Four on one, I think he is right to beat the majority." Tony said with a smile.
To be continued......
"Just a comedy." Steve smiled. "On our next date, we won't have to go to a place like this to mourn."
"Tony, you're filling your head with notions."
Doom laughed. Tony thought his laugh was horrible, like a pile of metal clashing. And he called him by his first name this time, which was also strange.
Tony 19
"Speaking of which, when are you going to move back?" Wanda asked.
I'd better apply to be on the team with Spider-Man next time. Hawkeye thought.
"If we meet Hulk, let's run away. Until I built a Hulkbuster Armor, we had no chance at all. And who's lost this time?"
"We were there to solve the problem you've created."
"Is that 2 changed by 5?" Tony watched carefully.
Tony woke up. He opened his eyes. It was all dark.
"You know what, Pete?"
"You've hit him before."
"Well done, Old Popsicle. Your shield can hold off a few of my frosts, but not my blizzard."
"You...... You are really a crow." Tony gasped.
"Not bad." Tony broke the silence.
"I lied." Tony lowered his eyes again to avoid Steve's gaze. "I didn't belong here, we shouldn't have met in this era, you shouldn't have met me at this age, at 19. It was a mistake from the beginning, and I have to make it right."
Avengers Mansion, 2 hours later.
"Bruce is useless." Hulk said.
"That was close." Tony breathed a sigh of relief, diagnosed the Quinjet carefully.
"Tony, you should be tired. Go back and rest. I'm all right."
"I have left too much study behind in university. If I don't work hard for the rest of the semester, I'm going to get flunked. So, I can't take part in the Avenger mission for now." Tony said to Tasha.
"Thanks, Pete. It's good to have you as a friend." Tony gave Peter a hug.
Two hours later, Carbonell put the book away, satisfied.
There were three left. Tony glanced, positioned, at 45, 62 and 170 degrees. Then Tony's fist hit the 45-degree man's face, the man raised his bat to defend. But it was a false move, Tony took the opportunity to kick him in the defenseless belly. With a click, his ribs should be broken. He fell to the ground. The 62 - degree attacker's bat has swept into Tony's waist. Tony did a back flip to avoid the attack, then flipped onto his shoulders, his legs around his neck, hit him on the head with his elbow. He passed out.
"Tony... I... You're a good friend to me too." Said Peter with a choked voice.
"Guess a little. Otherwise, you won't stop me from the beginning. In case something goes wrong, you're a punk kid at Columbia, it's okay to get in trouble. But Captain America was involved in a street fight, if the press found out... Is that what you think? I bet you're also trying to convince me to take the statement without using my real name. But you gave up the plan because you knew I would never agree to it."
"Peter, just Peter." Said Peter, scratching his head.
“Why did you run away from the hospital?”
"Sort of. I asked for this bed to be remodeled. Every time my back gets stiff in it. I might stay up a little longer if you'd agree to change it."
Steve handed the postcard back to the policeman. He was tickled to see what Steve had written, took his hand, tears in his eyes.
"In this way, he’d better become 'him' earlier, so that Avengers funds can be restored. Otherwise, it will be closed."
"Yes, just a bat."
"Oh, Tony, you're so brave, you're braver than he was." Wanda said.
"I know now..."
"Yeah. I hope I can be as good as her and have her courage. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to look for superheroes."
"If it is inconvenient for me to act, I can direct him to act, hope he is not so stupid."
Tony used his Avenger ID card to plug into the device, and finally made contact with the Avengers outside. Wasp, Giant Man, Quicksilver and Hellcat in Southampton found out that something happened in New York. They are about to arrive.
"Are you asking about our concept of time, or their concept of time?"
"Well, we must wake up the people we knocked unconscious." Steve said to the Spider-man next to him.
"So, you didn't lose your memory?"
Tony didn't notice the unnatural pause. He just took off his soggy clothes, put on the shirt Steve had handed him.
Just as he had turned into a rarely visited street, a line of rays had fallen from the sky; The road suddenly became potholed. He reacted quickly, braked hard, swung the motorbike. The wheels careened to the ground; sparks flew with a creak.
"All right." Bain picked up the wine in one hand. She lightly turned on the table lamp next to the wine cabinet. The yellow light slightly lit up the dark room.
"I thought you never played jokes, only played solemn and stirring."
Chapter 25
Brooklyn, New York City, 1933.
"What else are you up to?”
"Is that so? Captain, it looks like you've packed all your winter clothes in the wardrobe. Are you sure you don't need to go back and change? Or you want to be frozen into a Popsicle and lie in the Arctic for another 40 years." Frostbite aimed a row of icicles at Cap.
On the flight to Colorado, Tony thought: Lots of dangerous criminals escaped, but he didn't wake me up. And it was my fault. I should have read his note the first time I woke up. I didn't get back my watch he had confiscated, so the system assumes he is the highest-level contact. But when did the Old Man can use this high-tech gadget? That's what it says, 'Steve' plays' dumb ’.
"Well... He had a lot of armor; I didn't actually draw all of them."
"I don't want to make you cry every time."
"Iron Man? A bad joke!"
"Which side should we cheer on?"
"Well, I think so, sometimes. But there is still a long way off. We need to make some adjustments..."
"Aren't you tired? Take a bath and go to bed." Seth urged.
"Mine freond, thou habbe sum to sorh, mieht specan mid me. I beon georn to dale thy sorge, ablinnan it mid thee.(My friend, you have something to worry about, might as well speak with me. I am willing to share your worries, solve problems with you.)"
"When you tapped a fork, calling for everyone to watch our kiss."
"I can't paint him without armor..."
"Whose side are you on?"
Then Panther, The Thing, Human Torch, Falcon, and so on.
Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Maria Hospital, now.
The scene cut to the devastated village of Dent, then focused on the collapsed school.
There is a toy shop in an alley deep down Evans Street. It is called a toy shop, but it is not like a toy shop. It is not like other toy shops that hang colorful balloons, have clowns, wooden horses, swing cars and other things to attract the attention of children on the porch. It is gray, in the showindow of all kinds of weird things. A flying saucer with claws, a metal ball with eyes, a small box with a rotating leaf on top, a three-legged torch, a metal cup with an upside down umbrella, an iron box with holes, a watch without hands... Even on a clear day, this place looks eerie. No children wanted to go near it. It was said that the shopkeeper would lure children in and put them in a basement for gruesome experiments.
"Is it fine?”
"Tony, you haven't been in the bathroom for a long time, and stink." Steve said as he pulled him into the bathroom. "And your beard is growing."
"I could say that I lied to a 'liar'."
"Oh? Are you talking about democracy instead of leadership, Cap. Or do you want to pass the buck?"said Tony coldly.
"No! Vision!" Wanda rushed forward and caught his stump.
"I agree, Cap."
"You shave it off for me."
"Tiger Shark." Replied Wanda.
When they finally sat down in front of the fire, Seth handed them hot soups. "There isn't much food left in the kitchen. I think you're all hungry."
"Trust me, not at all." Bain put up her hand and stroked his iron mask. "Like I said, sleeping with a man in a steel mask makes me... makes me... Ah-ah..."
"You dropped this bomb out of thin air, and I'm in a mess. All kinds of news media, all kinds of bureaucracies are pointing at S.H.I.E.L.D. and asking me when is the earth going to be destroyed?" Fury bellowed through his cigar.
"I thought you disliked him." Wanda said.
He turned on the light and prepared to leave again. Steve still held on to him.
"Then, would you force the child to crack this pocket through your mind? Charles, you have no limits. Mind control a mutant child under the age of five."
She walked to the wine cabinet, pulled out a bottle of red wine in a swaying posture. Her hips twisted in the skirted curve, rose high as she bent down to fetch the wine. By the moonlight Tony could see the curve of her inner thigh under a short skirt. The sight made Tony's throat dry. He swallowed saliva involuntarily.
Steve finally packed up his things, put on his bag and stood up. Paige stood up, too. They walked together, talking and laughing, as they left the silent school in the sunset.
"Stop, everyone!" Steve shouted. "This cave is falling down. If you want to survive, run!"
"Yes, Widow, we're in a bit of a bind here, you might consider Spider-Man to back you up."
"Don't even think about it. I'm not going to follow you blindly in the thousands of kilometers Canyon."
That's interesting. Maybe Peter found an opening. Tony adds in the memo: Contact Spider-Man, priority 4.
"What about X-Men? What happened to them now? And he... How's Magneto?" Wanda chimed in anxiously. She has the mutation and has never joined the X-Men, but she still considers them a kinship. She was worried about Beast, and she was even more worried about her father, whose name she would not name.
"Are you really a Superhero?!"
The combo attack worked, Frostbite stumbling and falling. Steve jumped down and hit him hard. But Frostbite slowly stood up and hailed them again.
"Of course, you don't need to, because anything you know now doesn't matter, does it? That's why you came to see me today, isn't it? Run back to the past. In order not to affect your own future, you need me to help you erase the memory of this period of time, right?"
"Where are we? I seem to have forgotten." Steve said with a smile.
"What about you?"
Avengers Mansion, 15 hours ago.
Tony 19
"So do you miss the snow at Christmas in New York?"
"Listen, I don't buy your cosmological nonsense about balance in the universe, and the world is full of so-called 'unusual natural phenomena' almost every day, plus you can't prove these are related." Tony said.
After the disassembly of West Avengers and Force Work, it looks like they have a new plan to open a new Avengers division...
Carbonell took out his little book and carefully wrote down Krats's answers. Krats glanced up at Maria from time to time. Maria shook her legs, pursed her mouth, and looked out the window. And from one moment to the next, Krats picked up his mustache and winked at Maria. But Maria wasn't buying it. Her mouth was pouty even more.
"Tony, we've gone over your plan, and we've agreed to do it."
"Listen, Dr. Octopus, if you wish to continue this research, I can..."
Peter put his head on Tony's shoulder and he sobbed softly.
"It's a lie. I went to the library after you told me that last time." Steve said.
"Yep, that is true. But in any case, he can’t even think about manipulating the operation of Avengers as before. I'm staring at him." Clint said fiercely.
"But why did you break it? I still need to use it. I can't call your armor like a taxi."
At the dawn of the day, Peter, breathless as he ran, led the last group to the rendezvous. Tony flew over with the last of the wounded. By this time, the mudslide had already submerged the village of Dent.
Just then Jane walked in, wearing a low-cut black and yellow evening gown of her own design, her hair pulled up high to make her look radiant. She walked straight to the table where Tony was.
Chapter 05
"Maybe at first, but he can do a lot of things. What can I do? Stark Enterprises was acquired but I could do nothing. I didn't know what to do with the high-tech criminals. I was a second-tier on Avenger missions. Even if I built an armor, it was not enough energy to be invisible. I have to walk on the streets in armor in the middle of the night.
"All right." Steve said.
"Who really are you?”
"You solved it? Is that so?"
"It's not your fault, Tasha, you stay. I didn't handle it well." Steve said. "And the charter was signed on my behalf. If an apology is to be made, I shall do it. If anyone needs to leave to fix it, it's me."
Chapter 21
Tony 19
Seth looked Tony up and down, stared. "Boy, if you dare to fail my sister, I'll give you a taste of my fists."
"I suggest trust the Avengers, trust us. We can finally solve this global crisis like every threat this planet has faced before."
"I didn't bring my armor out."
"Infighting among the founders. Is this the prelude to the dissolution of the Avengers?"
"Even a rookie burglar like me, breaking into Bain, I will choose around 2 a.m." Tony made a habit of answering his own questions.
"I think you should say 'thank you'."
"Hey. Seriously? Do I look like I lied? I don't have any backup. Sorry, guys, you are collateral damage."
"Leave it at the door."
"Ha-ha, silly boy." Wanda smiled. "Anyway, the total number is odd. He asked a team of one to wait for support, so that he could be rescued. They both enjoyed doing it over the years. ‘You save me once; I will save you again’."
At this Tony could listen no longer. He pounded the table and stood up.
"My sonic attacks only temporarily dissociate him and contain him, but soon the electrostatic particles still accumulate, which is not the ultimate solution." Tony said.
"Would you put me down now?"
“Is it my?”
"DJ, would you mind playing another tune?" Said the girl. "I want to dance. You can dance with me if you like."
"I don't want to talk... I just want to... I..."
"I'm so sorry... It's urgent. I can't wait any longer. I can only get you back in thirty minutes." Libra's voice came out through space.
"No buts! Come down, come, I won't let you drown. Take off your clothes and jump down, or I'll pull you down."
"You're so stupid! I knew that! I can’t count on useless heroes like you." Doctor Octopus beat the wall angrily.
"Go down the alley around the corner and change your flag suit. I don’t want to stand out by eating at a fast-food restaurant with Captain America."
Jarvis turned and went to the kitchen.
To be continued...
Tony 19
"I'm sorry, I mean, you're right. It's going to have to be you, not Dr. Banner, to accomplish this task."
"It's not like that at all. He created this universe out of subconscious protection of his parents. I just mentally told him that his parents were in danger. He did the rest himself. This pocket universe isn't just a pocket, it's a real universe. If we break it apart from external intervention, it would cause the collision of two universes and the destruction of two universes, that one and our one. So it has to be someone in the pocket who has to find their own escape."
"Jarvis told me you didn't want to live in Avengers Mansion."
"But they are fruits in the same tree, aren't they? It's only a matter of time he becomes him."
Tony 19
"Be teased by Black Widow, again? 'Captain America plus Iron Man can't even handle a small role. Off the register immediately? '".
Steve waited quietly. After about two hours, he heard the door of the armor storage open and Tony's footsteps coming closer to the door of his room. Steve's mouth turned up. Then the door was slammed open, the corridor light burst through the darkness as usual, and he used to shade his eyes with his hand. Before he could get used to it, Tony had jumped on top of him, pinching his ribs, and then his passionate, hurried kiss fell.
A flash of lightning hit Steve. Tony raised the shield to protect him.
Tony slowly parted from Steve. He whispered in Steve's ear, "What's their reaction?"
"Morning Meeting..."
"Seem to have seen you before. I got it. This magazine..."A policeman held up a magazine, and the model in that magazine was dressed a little bit.
"Or else? If the earth is destroyed, I will have no territory to rule over."
"Thor, thank you for being human in this."
Because of Peter's words, the following Christmas and New Year were a bit of trouble for Tony. Tony hesitated to invite Kris to the Avenger Mansion for the holiday or accompany her back to England. After much hesitation, Tony chose the latter. Though the choice took him away from the lab for a few days.
"You should have a bath, a bandage, and a deep sleep."
"He was afraid to disturb you, so I came."
"Nonsense. When you returned from 'outer space,' you could have conducted your experiments in the lab at the Avengers' mansion, but instead you hid in Doctor Octopus's lab."
"So, you are actually caught in bed." Tony laughed.
"You're the one who needs to sleep now." Tony pulled the syringe from under the pillow and stuck it in Steve's arm.
"I am cold. I am drenched by the rain."
“Am I?”
Mr. Sanchez, Level A Contact: Mr. Stark, we are very interested in your Starktron project. You can set up a time to talk more about it.
It was past midnight and the lobby of the New York Police Department was still crowded, and officers were busy.
"Peter, don't cry." Tony stroked Peter's head. "Have I displeased you? Or do you blame me for not letting you fly?"
Chapter 01
"There is a more important reason. As I said that day, you are the most special Tony Stark of all the parallel universes."
"Spiderman, why are you here?" Kris said in surprise.
Tony walked Kris down to the dormitory and kissed her. At first it was just a shallow kiss goodbye, then the kiss became enthusiastic, igniting the enthusiasm of the orange fragrance, provoking Tony's desire.
"Days. Let me see, parties, prisons, parties, fires, hospitals..."
"There's just been an earthquake. I'm going to put on my armor and fly out."
"Leave me alone! Sit down! If you don't want to die,"
"I... I think I can agree." Thor said.
"That's it?”
"How is that possible?!"
The story of Tony 19 begins with "Crossing", ends with "Onslaught," which was my original writing plan. It also followed the history of Earth 616. But the 19-year-old Tony was coming alive. He was alive, conscious, thinking, and he was communicating his wishes to me. He didn't want to be just an echo and a memory of the 616-Earth-Tony. He infected me. So there was Epilogue 2. He led me into this whole new universe.
"Please."
"More of a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. God, I really miss Ebbets Field. When I did attend games, I never sat in luxury seats like this one."
Peter let go of Tony awkwardly. "I thought I'd never see you again... I mean, I thought you weren't coming back for a long time. I... I just told them you went to outer space. And you..."
He blasted off the flying disk at 36 degrees, dismantled the two long-grabbing robots that attacked at 45 degrees and 48 degrees, and activated the repulsion device of the boots to fly upwards to avoid the laser beams from the diagonally below ground. And then he was hit in the same direction by Steve's shield. Steve flew down. Tony fell straight to the ground, fell back, and was pinned down by Steve. Steve raised his shield and smashed the invisible joint of armor’s relatively fragile neck. Armor damaged, made a sizzle noise. Tony lay on the ground. His mask opened automatically.
"Are you going to ground me too?"
To be continued...
"I'm sorry I was so careless. I'm just so glad. I thought you'd never show up." Embarrassed, Steve let go of his arm around Bucky.
Click! The glass shattered.
"I can understand, don't worry, Tony."
"Almost forgot, 477682."
"At least I won't have to put a combination lock on your room."
"That's it."
"Doesn't that just make him a playboy?" Replied the golden-mask girl.
"Tony Stark is Iron Man?!"
"So, which one of you is my sister's boyfriend?" Seth spoke as he sat in his rocking chair by the fire.
It was a quiet day at Avengers Mansion, no urgent tasks, no calls. Steve put down his paintbrush. It was already past midnight, perhaps too calm, so his thoughts stirred. He could not sleep.
"They've been complaining about us for years." Steve said casually.
"Computer, open the glide."
"What else?"
At this time, Steve's voice was warm and deep. Tony could feel his breath blowing to his ears, blowing the tips of his hair, twitching itching.  But his restrained state made him unable to lift his hands. He just let the itching grow.
"All right, I'll go." Steve replied.
Tony's hand was caressing his face, smoothing his hair, and Tony had a gentle smile on his face. Tony has always been very intense, he has always been very intense to show himself, sad or happy, worry or caper, crazy or indifferent, angry or bright, arrogant or passionate, scheming or simple, genius or fool... He was always at the extremes, and there never seemed to be middle words in his vocabulary, the words' soft as water.'Steve didn't know this Tony, he didn't know.
"Yes, ma 'am." Then the guards backed out.
"There's no button, I pre-programmed your voice. All you have to say is, 'Computer, open the glide.'"
"Your Avenger ID Card."
"I feel the same with you by my side."
"No need. It's all water under the bridge. I came from Los Angeles to New York to join my cousin, but he died, too."
"Believe me, I have tried. This door is tough."
"I mean, the earth's not exterminate, I'm alive, everybody's alive, and everything's the same old and the same old. Good guys are still good and bad guys are still bad. Even though we're a little poor now, I'm going to try to make money as hard as I can, very hard. Even though I'm 20, kind of boring, uninteresting, unsurprising..."
The Spymaster jolted slightly at the last word, but he recovered immediately.
"I want to be a painter, to draw superheroes." Steve said.
To be continued...
"I know your name." Paige laughed.
Gunnison County, Gunnison, Colorado.
"Well, since you admit it, I'll take the one in your room." Tony looked up and kissed him on the chin, took his hand, walked out of the lab.
"She spent two hours in the bathroom that day, and our entire apartment was smashing down the door. Before going downstairs, she said to me, 'Please, Melony, don't go back to the dorm until noon the next day.' As a result, I could only stay overnight at Arisa next door. Away from my beloved bed, I didn't sleep well all night. So, this meal is definitely on you, Kris."
"Ha-ha, I witan se Tony is gedon thy heorte. Ne sorh hit. I witan Tony for gears, fela beadus. He is na an nearu wac mann.(Ha-ha, I already know that Tony is holding your heart. Don't worry about it. I have known Tony for years, many battles on the battlefield. He is not a narrow- weak-minded man.)"
"In a cave."
"You chose Bucky yourself, didn't you? Then you just have to go on acting."
Gatlin's bed is still cramped for two grown men. Tony lay on his back. Peter lay on his side. Tony couldn't sleep, chatting with Peter.
"If you think that I am alone and cannot catch you, then you are wrong. Today is not the day of New York City, I am not just having a pair of gauntlets, and I didn't come alone, other Avengers support is on the way."
"When I raise money, I'll bring the Spider-armor to memo priority 5." Tony promised.
Chapter 26
It was a moonless night, black on the bay, black on the dock, black on the water, black on everything. Steve stood up. He stared into the deep black water. He could not see through the black water, and he felt the urge to look for it, so he put out one foot, just as he had done before the first dive, only this time there was no one below to catch him and pull him out of the water. But he doesn't care anymore. He can swim already, can't he? He doesn't need him.
The tower's alarm goes off wildly. A group of guards rushed in, firing a volley of guns at the intruder. To make matters worse, the armor shows less than 1% of the energy left, just enough to sustain Tony's chest implant. Now, so to speak, it is just a pair of old-fashioned armor.
Tony pulled Spiderman into the middle of the drawing room. Spiderman trailed behind Tony. Tony picked up an empty goblet nearby, tapped it several times with a fork.
That's interesting. Maybe Peter found an opening. Tony added in the memo: Contact Spider-Man, priority 4.
"I was a little late adjusting the equipment, too late to get out of there, but fortunately there is another way in the cave, leading me to the other side of the cliff."
"Say it again, Zzzzz..." Peter said.
“I know how you feel. We don't belong here, or we can only stay in the corner of this room." Said the girl.
"You must be really good friends to talk to this far."
Tony looked up, a little embarrassed. He sat up, took a little distance from Steve. The man's face blurred in the heavy rain. Taking off his uniform, he looked less solemn.
"Too many super criminals fleeing, but Avengers are understaffed. " Steve said.
Is there a party at Avengers Mansion today? What does Jarvis prepare for everyone during his busy day? Is it snowing in New York now? And… will he miss me?
Not good! A sniper zeroed in on Tony! Steve’s shield flew directly towards Tony. Tony was stunned. But the shield folded, crossed Tony, knocked down the sniper behind him.
Bucky bent over and picked it up.
"My fault, it's all my fault. Oh, my God, Iron Man and Captain America, the heavyweight gossip of the heavyweight. Why would I want to be the first to know?  I'm just a little spiderman, stressed out. Oh, my god, my heart. By the way, is the pressure on me to keep this big secret going to get me the spider-armor any closer?"
The party at The Mansion was not lively. It was impromptu, not many people were present, except for the resident staff of the Mansion. Jane and Hank were still on their way from Southampton with the Quicksilver family. Black Widow, the organizer of the party, is a cold fish. She was dressed as usual, sitting gracefully on the sofa with a glass of wine in her hand.
"Tony, Zzzz..."
"Honey, you know I have never caught a cold." Steve smiled tenderly and kissed his wife on the cheek.
"Thank you for the compliment, but you are wise enough. Blended in with the Rush fraternity applicants, acted like an outcast newcomer, captured my heroic psychology, added a few drinks, urged me to take you to steal the painting. You deliberately gave me the wrong shift time, got me caught. And then you used Brennan to get Kris to bail me out. You figured it would be hard for me to say no to her invitation to a party when I got out of jail.
Tony quickly ducked past the rear attacker. The rear attacker lost balance, leaned forward, colliding with the front attacker. Tony had reached the side of him, kicked hard in his shin. He exclaimed, clasped crus, dropped to the ground.
Externally, the damage rate is 5%; The main functions are intact; Energy reserves remain at 73.2%.
"Maybe I've been spending too much time in the lab lately. Let us go on, dear old man."
"Fine, we’ll do what you say."
"That's what I thought." Tony replied.
"Do you hold on well?"
Paige shed tears. She turned her back and left the toy shop. Steve stared blankly at the closed door.
Steve turned his body to Tony, holding Tony's shoulders with his hands, slowly turning Tony's body towards him. Tony was confused, but he didn't resist. He faced Steve.
"That...... I don’t really have much time to pay attention to the baseball game."
"Maybe he had other purposes, but Tony is my friend..." Peter said.
"Any ideas? "Steve asked.
This was the happiest time since Peter joined the Avengers. He suddenly thought it would be nice to be an Avenger, or even better, to team with Tony on a mission. But Tony will be dragged to his group by Captain nine out of ten. Saw the way the Captain was in a hurry today, Peter knew he wouldn't let Tony go to another team easily. The thought cast a shadow over Peter's good mood.
"Shh, trust me."
"I don't... thinking about... you..."
"Wait a minute, the earthquake and torrential rain in the Yorkshire Dales were not mere natural disasters. They were recent global anomalies, along with the snowstorms in 32 US states, and belong in the occult." Tony said.
"Dr. Strange's Magical Teleportation..."
An hour later, they were frolicking in the water, and laughter pierced the quiet corner. Two hours later, they climbed out of the water, one after the other, and sat side by side on the dock in the summer sun.
"You rushed into Baintronics?! That's something we need to talk about." Steve woke up, got to the point.
"I have told the owner to mail the bill to Maria Foundation and informed the Foundation to send a special collateral damage team. They are on their way. You don't have to worry about it. Seriously, aren't you hungry after all this fighting?"
"This country needs more dedicated people like you." Steve patted the policeman on the shoulder.
To be continued...
"Steve, I have an idea now, but it's a risky idea. The success rate is about 50 percent or less." Tony said.
Brooklyn, New York City, 1930.
Tony thought for a moment, immediately fired a sonar shock wave at Steve's shield. The sound waves amplified by Vibranium, dissociated the current. The dissociated electric particles bounced off the shield and beat Electro, knocking him back a few steps.
"But I would say you shouldn't get your hopes up. The hole is so big, Dr. Octopus may not have sampled all the minerals." Tony said.
"Here we go again."
"So, you mean... Thor, we need one of their airships!" Steve shouted.
"Okay... Do you have a solution?"
"And if I don't agree? Now that you're calling it my Time Machine, I can lend it at my own discretion."
"It doesn't have to be every day. After the main parts are repaired, time can heal some bits on its own."
"Spiderman, you're right, it's a bit crowded. I'll fly you back." Tony got up from the copilot, walked over to Spider-Man.
"If you ask about your physical appearance, you'll still be the same, your 20-year-old self. But in ten years, no one will be the same..."
"Your request is granted."
Looking at the stump of Vision, all of their faces were stained with sadness. But this is not the time to cry. This is not the time to mourn. This is not the time to bury their teammates. All eyes turned to Tony, who tried to compose himself.
"Not tonight. Tonight is the first time I have received this gift."
Tony held a strange pike of various kinds of kitchenware assembled machine rushed out of the restaurant.
Steve smiled and shook his head, kissed Tony's sweat-soaked hair and carried him back to bed. Holding him in his arms, he felt once again the familiar sensation of Tony lying in his arms. Then sleep at last caught up with him, and he gasped, fell into a deep sleep.
"When all Earth tech in New York City went out of business, the mainframe of my lab was still running, and I was the only one who recorded the data." Said Doctor Octopus proudly.
"Good morning, Tony."
“I think you're mistaken, Mr. Carbonell. I know it's a family business, and I have no intention of changing its name. I'm not here to buy your steel plant. And I don't have any money."
