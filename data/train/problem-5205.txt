Steve must have been equally shocked as Tony and was stunned silent. His breathing continued to hitch but he was calming down. Tony’s kiss was probably as good as a slap to the face…
that left little to the imagination. It wasn’t weird to see Wade wearing women’s clothing. Heck, he’d once actually fought beside the man while he was wearing a maid outfit. Not to mention, it was incredibly hot seeing his boyfriend in the lacey undergarment and slowly swaying into Peter. Peter’s hold on Wade tightened and he began to rock his hips beneath him again, flowing with Wade and building up that need again.
But Tony had acted differently only with Bucky. He was the same old Tony with the others. Maybe Steve was right, maybe Tony did act differently with Bucky because Bucky knew almost the whole story about his time traveling.
“We have control for the next 30 seconds,” tech support grunted as if overriding Jarvis was a physical exertion.
Tony’s mouth was hot and his tongue was soft and caressing the underside of his cock. Steve never before felt such intense pleasure and it rocked him to the very core. If not for his connection with Tony’s eyes, he probably would have lost himself to the passion. As it was, he could barely focus on anything else other than the feel of Tony’s mouth and the intense stare of his eyes.
Cap chuckled and his eyes lit up as he looked at Peter. His smile was still warm as eyes moved onto Wade and he instantly stiffened under the Captain’s scrutiny. He stated, “Welcome, Wade.”
Steve’s eyes were still glassy and sad but his mouth quirked into a tiny smile. He whispered, “Thanks, Tony.”
“Dad is in the mood for an expresso,” Tony murmured as Happy drove them to Oscorp Tower. They sat next to each other in the back of the Bentley and Tony had been playing with Steve’s fingers, carding them in and out of his grasp when he finally spoke up.
that Steve Rogers was going to die before he found someone to love or saw the bright future Tony told him of.
“Happy birthday, Peter,” Bucky murmured. Steve stopped trying to keep the balloons off the floor and ran over to Bucky and Peter.
Tony did not counter his declaration. He just held him tighter. They were no longer denying it nor pretending there was a way to save him. They had tried and failed and saw with their own eyes their son give up.
Peter ran straight to Tony’s side and eagerly wrapped his wet arms around Tony’s waist. Tony ran his hand over Peter’s dark brown hair and smiled warmly at his son.
Tony went to work on his armor to make it better and stronger and something the Red Skull would fear. Revenge was on his mind and he planned to take down the Red Skull and his organization. He already had Jarvis downloading everything available on Hydra and sent his AI to work on figuring out how deep Hydra got into SHIELD and other organizations.
The next chapter will be the epilogue! Thank you everyone who has been reading! The journey is almost over! :)
Bucky’s arms snapped away from him and Tony carefully let him go. Bucky sharply got to his feet and, breathing shallowly, he stared down at Tony like he had just stabbed him.
Steve was quick to grow out a beard and, from Goodwill, got a large backpack to tote around his shield and uniform along with other amenities needed for living on the streets.
“Just hold me, Tony,” Steve whispered. The only comfort he found was in Tony’s arms. “Just hold me until my heart is strong enough to beat without you shielding it…”
Peter bent down to continue kissing him but Wade pressed a hand to the center of Peter’s chest and said, “No, stop.
Wade nodded encouragingly and Peter quickly finished his water before standing up and leaning into his boyfriend.
Steve turned back around to his boyfriend and whispered, “But what if I have to jump in to stop her from killing him??”
When he finished the phone call, he cradled the phone in his hands and stared at the screen. It showed his most recent calls and the lengths of the conversations. Aunt May was the latest and the unlisted contact beneath hers was Steve Rogers.
“No…God, I wanted to Bucky but no. I can’t believe…I did not think you swung that way…” Steve whispered, his heart pinning for the unfair loss.
“The suit was disconnected at 8:07 a.m. Eastern Standard Time from the third charging unit in the main laboratory at the Avengers Mansion. Two hours were spent there and then there were an additional 5 hours of travel time before we reached the destination.”
The 225 amp arc welder, that was the size of an old toaster, and probably looked the most dangerous just because it was hanging off his belt by a climber’s hook.
Steve affixed a small smile to his own face but he could not look away from the back of Tony’s head and look at the reporters but he still waved too.
Steve glanced up and saw Tony was no longer playing with him. He wore a serious expression, glossed over with a pinch of nervousness. Tony had changed his ways with Pepper. He dropped his playboy attitude and gave his heart to her. Their break up had been bad and drove Tony close to the brink. He had once confessed to Steve if the Avengers had not formed Tony might not have survived.
“I know,” Steve replied, his heart breaking. He scooted forward and wound his arms around Tony’s waist and pressed his face into the small of Tony’s back. His heart was beating frantically in his chest as his worry grew. What would Tony do??
From his place in Steve’s arms, Peter’s eyes had grown huge and he looked around the room with fascination.
Tony hit the man with everything he had but the blond still remained standing. He was a perfect conduit for Tony to unleash his rage on. Every time the giant slammed his hammer, the very teeth rattled in Tony’s skull and a strange tingling fear raced up his spine but he ignored all that to keep pushing at the man.
The horror he had been trying to deny hit him full on and Tony could not deny the fact that Steve was doomed. The way Tony saw it Steve had limited options: Steve would give in and eat humans to nourish Venom but will thereby destroy the purity of his soul and if he ever escaped would be a shell of the man he once knew; or he would not eat and waste away like Peter had and eventually die; or SHIELD would find him first and kill him before more died; or, the most unlikely of the bunch, they will miraculously find a cure they had been searching for, for weeks and save him… Tony was no idiot. He could put two and two together. No matter what happened in the end, he was going to lose Steve.
When he entered the room, he was struck by the amount of activity around the machine and then he noted the activity mostly consisted of digging
He could have gone with Tony. It would have been easy and none of his friends would have stopped him if he was adamant enough.
He went straight to his backpack and pulled out the torn mask. He took a needle and thread out of his desk and then went to the living room. He turned on the television and settled on the couch with mask and threaded the needle. The process for repairing his mask was a slow one and Peter used the television program to keep his mind busy. Paying attention to the program and the stitching kept him from growing too bored.
siyuttov asked what Bucky and Natasha said to each other and I was instantly inspired to write this scene from Bucky's POV. Hope you enjoy! :)
The bike rumbled to life and they took off with a jolt as Bucky cranked the gas. They jumped off the sidewalk and from there Steve could only guess where Bucky took him. He kept his eyes shut tightly and concentrated on breathing normally.
Schmidt forcibly pulled his head up by his hair and held the bloody implant in front of Steve’s face. Schmidt declared, “To Stark, you just died. Soulmates surviving a partner’s death is about 5%. How do you think your soulmate will fair? By your reaction, not too well, I assume… Let’s try again. What is it I want you to say, Captain?”
All in all, there was no confrontation. Mary was wary and did not say much so Steve did most of the talking. Tony added a few antidotes but mostly he held Steve’s hand and would squeeze it in support.
He lightly touched Steve’s arm to guide Steve to the desk and kept his hand there longer than necessary but not too long to be too obvious.
Steve was used to being able to think up a plan at the drop of a dime but…as he stared at the glove on the demon’s hand, he felt his mind grow blank and fear tighten his throat.
“Hey!” Bucky called, grabbing his attention. Bucky stood on the training mats. He was barefoot, bare-chested, and seemingly bare of weapons. All his articles were piled together on the edge of the mat. Bucky took a fighting stance and said, “Come at me.”
They were all over each other and the dozen or so feet to Tony’s room and bed took thrice as long to get to. They mostly rolled over the walls kissing and running their hands over each other. Steve had only managed to unbutton Tony’s jeans by the time they reached his bedroom.
“Yes, please,” Peter replied, collapsing at the counter. He sat heavily on one of the barstools and lay his head on his arms.
The Soldier broke his eyes from her and clenched his right fist tightly. When his gaze returned to her, it was cold and his expression was hard. He stated, “I will tell you the Captain’s location if you can do two things for me.”
After Tyler testified, a doctor was called up. He testified to Tyler's emotional instability was due to the trauma of the attack. He explained away her insanity with a long winded medical explanation that sent chills down Steve's spine.
“I had struck the Captain’s shield with Mjölnir in the fight,” Thor stated. Tony nodded, remembering the blast of air that had knocked him off his feet. Thor continued, “But I had not struck the Captain’s shield when I first came to Midgard. How had my hammer woken the Captain the first time?”
His mind came to a halt as he remembered a tiny fact that he thought insignificant at the time when first meeting his son. One of the adjectives, used to describe the Hydra lab that housed Peter during the first two years of his life, had originally been inconsequential because Agent Hill had used the word “abandoned” before it…but what if it had not been
By the time the Red Skull returned to one of the last standing Hydra bases, the war was over, Hitler was dead, and Germany as defeated. The Red Skull railed what remained of his forces and began to rebuild. It would take decades to get back to their former strength, but he was a patient man, and he knew if he wanted to continue to be superior, he had to be quiet, else his organization would falter under a powerful country’s might. But that did not mean his organization was weak. He’d pity the man who would ever insinuate such a lie. No, Hydra may have had its head cut off but it was regrowing two more.
“It said it will let us know if it found the Red Skull or not. Either way it will have to come back because the time machine is here,” Steve commented, holding back his smile with his final add on.
Tony had come up with a number of indescribable toys for Peter and Peter absolutely adored them. Steve loved to watch him play with his adamantium Avengers action figures or roll around on his steel tricycle. Thanks to Tony, Peter could play and have a semi-normal childhood.
This time her mate totally froze and had even stopped chewing the food in his mouth. He glared at her like he was offended by her asking.
Something flashed through Eddie’s eyes but, whatever it was, was gone in an instant and Eddie smiled brightly at Peter, replying, “Probably just the same as what had happened to you. Don’t overthink it, Parker, I’m just over-speculating on very little sleep.” He tiredly rubbed his eyes and continued, “I should be drinking coffee right now not water…”
Tony looked at the undamaged Audi R8 by the garage exit and ripped off his armor. He’d test the disassembly system for the suit later. He needed to find out who this guy was. Why was he at his house? And how was he able to get in and out of his house so easily??
Steve walked up to it and read aloud, “Behind door number one is Hawkeye’s mate, behind door number two are his children,” Steve paused as he personally read the next part of the note privately. Aloud, he grimly stated, “And behind door number three is a long lost friend of the Captain’s. Only two per door or they all die.”
“They say it’s unnatural,” Bucky replied, his heart going out to his friend. “That the implants are supposed to find your perfect ‘biological’ match. So when fruits are paired together people say it’s because they’ve got bad genes.”
of all people to be left out…” Peter stubbornly jutted out his bottom lip and leaned heavily onto Wade. He murmured, “It isn’t right…You’re my boyfriend…”
Peter’s eyes raked over Wade’s exposed chest. Peter, himself was a guy so he was no stranger to male anatomy, but
It was an arc reactor, similar to Tony’s old one except this one had a plate around it saying: “Proof that Tony Stark has a heart.”
Steve shook his head with a chuckle and popped open the bag. He cautiously took a small bite and froze when the flavor exploded in his mouth. He’d eaten chips with Solo but they’d all been the ones donated to the church and they were all plain. He gave Tony a surprised look and Tony’s grin widened. Tony said, “I know, right?”
Coulson needed to answer Stark’s inquiry so, as he started to slowly circle the room, he replied, “You’ve been quiet, Stark. You’re making Fury worried.”
But Tony...Tony was alone in this timeline and he was presented an impossible puzzle. His friends would have wanted him to turn from it but Tony was invested.
Peter looked up to see if he was really gone and was sad to see it was true. Dad still only saw a child when he looked at Peter. He still saw the boy he had raised. He did not realize how much he had changed…
,” Steve pleaded, for what he did not know. Tony thrust his fingers in and out of him a few times, making Steve writhe underneath him. He kept hitting that one spot which made him writhe and he grinned victoriously at Steve as he hit it again and again.
Jarvis looked down at the moniker on its chest and then gestured to it and asked, “Are you referring to the company’s logo?”
“Thank you, Howard,” Tony replied, his voice chipped as he addressed Howard by his first name for the first time.
“I’m not going anywhere, Peter!” Steve replied to his son. He was going to tease him more but paused when he saw pain flicker in Tony’s eyes for the briefest of seconds. He reached out to his husband and Tony took his hand. Steve pulled him up and he looked questionably at the smaller man.
Fury had ordered them to go home and sleep and not to come back and help with the clean up until they got at least eight hours of rest.
“No, not Rogers or Stark, your real father, the one who blessed you with your amazing abilities,” his mom stated.
!” Both of them gave him a pointed look and Steve stated, “Peter would not do that. Since its creation,
“Well hopefully he’s cowering away somewhere far from us,” Natasha mumbled into her coms. Her heart began to beat faster as she realized a flaw in their plan. Her eyes flickered up and, yes, there were cameras in the hall and probably elsewhere. Their surprise attack lost its surprise as soon as they were seen on their monitors...
Bruce looked down and, in a lower voice, murmured, "You know, I tried...When I had the gauntlet and stones...I really tried to bring her back..."
There is was, the topic of love. It was out in the open and Steve did not feel brave enough to broach any further on it.
“I would never wish such an existence on you, my love,” she whispered. “But you are the only enigma of this plane…your love is mortal and will die.”
“That does not change the fact that Barnes is unstable and loves you,” Tony retorted. “What if he forces himself on you?”
Tony smoothed Steve’s shirt back over his shoulders and down to his elbow, almost locking him in position with his shirt then bent over and placed a single chaste kiss on the center of Steve’s chest, right above his racing heart. His dog tags clinked lightly as Tony’s chin brush against them. Steve tried to grasp Tony’s head but was restricted by his shirt. He groaned in a combination of annoyance and arousal and he felt Tony grin against his skin.
Wade chuckled wetly and lightly caressed Peter’s cheekbone with his thumb. Wade whispered, “Hi, baby boy…”
“So he works for SHIELD, huh? He seems to know what he’s doing,” Steve stated with a shiver. He'd stopped breathing when heard this Coulson found his sketch. They were lucky he didn’t happen to look into the closet. Tony had told him all about SHIELD after Natasha’s visit and he wasn’t too eager to meet them just yet.
Steve still looked nervous and Tony wasn’t heartless. He knew what was probably worrying him so he lay a hand on his arm and tried to sound as comforting as possible as he whispered, “Hey, look, it’s not like it was. We don’t have to worry that we are mates. No one is going to care that we are men. All they’ll want to know is if we’re going to wear the same color tuxes at our wedding.”
The clock on his phone ticked away the last few seconds of August ninth and, in those few remaining seconds, Wade gasped hopefully, “Peter?”
going to fix it?” Steve asked incredulously. He was under the impression Tony was the only one who knew how to use arc reactors.
“Good,” she replied and pressed her mouth into his. He hissed sharply to collect his breath and then slid his arms behind her and drew her closer to deepen the kiss.
Tony went in search of his super soldier and wondered if they’d be able to sneak away into one of these abandoned buildings tonight. Knowing Bucky, he had probably scolded Steve like he was a petulant child so they would have to be double cautious when sneaking away as Bucky would probably be waiting on them to make a move and ready to scold some more.
Steve wanted to break free from Cable’s grip and run down the highway to Tony all over again. The temptation was real and there and the only thing holding him back were Cable’s words.
Wade was slumped on his couch with a bucket of knives next to him. He was playing “How many knives can I throw at the wall to feel better?” Twenty-three didn’t cut it. The 24
Tony said nothing to him and Barnes did nothing more than sit up and stare at him with his dead eyes.
“About?” Steve inquired, playing with Tony in their now flirtatious game. He placed his hand right next to Tony's head and leaned over him but did not touch him. Steve was still denying himself…but he wasn't going to have to any longer.
“Hopefully, I can convince him otherwise,” Coulson whispered and walked past the doctor and opened the door to the interrogation room.
Vision instantly phased himself and Wanda through the wall and, as soon as she was materialized. Wanda worked her magic. Without having to worry about injuring Peter, Wanda flexed her hands and contained the symbiote in a pink ball of magic, crushing and containing the symbiote into a small sphere.
“It’s movie night, I hope your reactor can handle the ‘epic laser battle’ we’re going to be watching in the next Star Wars episode,” Steve jokingly badgered as Tony finished off the pipe with one last concentrated blast from his repulsor.
He thought Tony would push him away again but he had to make Tony realize that Steve wasn’t going to deny it anymore. And if Tony could not handle that…
Everyone in the audience was on their feet and screaming. Steve could barely hear himself think it was so loud. He smiled and raised his hand in greeting and they yelled all the louder.
“I…I remembered it. As soon as you said it I remembered it and knowing what you did…it was all too much and I needed to be alone for a little. But I understand. It was me or Steve and…I’m glad Stevie didn’t have to go through what I did. He’d never be able to forgive himself. He would have never been able to come back… like I am...”
“It’s a new player,” Coulson replied. “He has advanced technology. He came in on a flyer, had bombs, and transmitted a blocker that messed with our systems. We were unable to get video of him or pinpoint his location until he blew something up.”
Tony was sitting on his bed. He had been in the middle of conversing with his suit when he stepped in. Steve looked from the suit to Tony and asked with concern, “Were you just talking to yourself?”
They stumbled out of the box and waited for their prints, smiling coyly at each other as the feel of their lips still lingered on the other’s  mouths.
As she closed the door behind them, she heard Peter’s breath hitch and knew the clicking of the lock woke him. She paused and honed in her hearing again.
“Did he throw you? Are you alright?” Bruce whispered anxiously. Out of everyone on the team, Tony was the most fragile, especially out of his armor. Bruce did not wait for Tony’s reply quickly checked the rigidly of his neck and then ran his hands over other weak junctures in his body to make sure all the bones were whole and no skin was overly swollen. He then grabbed his wrist to check his pulse checking for any kind of stress.
Steve looked at Peter curiously upon his question but, then his gaze turned inward, and he pondered Peter’s question for a moment.
Dr. Banner pinched the bridge of his nose and stated, “By my calculations…” Banner bit down on the end of his pen as his eyes scanned over the scribblings on the notebook in front of him. “With his metabolism and prior history, I’d say he’ll be out another hour, at most, two…”
“No,” Steve whispered. “I-I just have never seen it apart from your armor.” He reached up and ran his fingertips along the rim. The arch reactor pulsated beneath his touch.
“Are we in trouble? How did she know? Can she read our minds?? Do you think she’s angry with me? Is she going to stop training me? What’s Auntie Tasha going to do to Uncle Tony and Uncle Bucky? Is she going to kill them??”
No one had ever said that to him before nor flirted so aggressively. Tony was certainly a handful but…he was turning into Steve’s handful. Steve smiled to himself despite the fact it shouldn't happen. He still wasn’t too sure about Tony’s idea but it was a nice thing to imagine.
Steve could not say any more without alerting Sam to the rest of Bucky's plans so he squeezed his best friend's thigh and made a silent prayer on his behalf.
“Hey now, no talking like that,” Wade murmured. “I’m alright. The boo-boos are healing right up! Nothing can kill me, not even Death, and trust me, she’s tried a lot.”
Tony wept unabashed in front of his friends and family. There was no need for proper public decorum with them and he was eternally grateful for it. Eventually, he calmed down enough and listened to the rest of the accounts. His tears never stopped but he laughed at the silly stories and barely breathed whenever someone spoke of Steve’s bravery. They relieved his life in remembrance. It was gut-wrenching and horrible, but also a step into healing the wound of being ripped apart and the fact that every single person in that room loved Steve made him feel not as alone in this.
He pictured the man in question and mentally repeated the term silently to himself as if to ingrain it into his memory.
There was a long pause and then the AI stated, “The requested information is not available on the RAM.”
“You’re brilliant,” Steve gasped. He pulled back to kiss him and then peppered kisses all over his face as he gasped, “You’re so smart and perfect and amazing –.”
They pulled away slowly and they blinked open their eyes together. They smiled blissfully at each other. When he first met Tony, he never imagined himself in such a position with him and, even if he did, he probably would have never imagined feeling such elation.
“Yeah, but we know it can be more than a shield now. With our minds controlling it, it can be a shield, body armor, a weapon, or something as simple as an umbrella. The possibilities are endless and ‘Venom’ makes it sound more badass.”
“Go for it,” Tony clipped. Peter’s finger’s dug into Steve’s flesh. Peter was obviously distracted so was not checking his strength. Had Steve been a normal human, Peter’s grip would have crushed his throat and broken his spine.
Tony continued, even as people continued to whisper to one another. “The Captain had just woken recently and dug himself out of his grave. He’s no zombie but…his serum saved him. He looks no older than the day he crashed the plane.”
(in other words more superfamily!), and finally a fic where Steve wakes in the ice by himself before SHIELD finds him (and how he discovers the modern world and Tony)!
They all were screaming questions at him and blinding him with bright flashes from their cameras. Steve held his hands up to his eyes to try to block out the bright lights. He tried to look around him for a possible route of escape but all he saw were a sea of bodies, bobbing with numerous buoys of cameras.
Steve laughed and pulled away. Smiling widely, he said, “A new life! What should I do? I don’t even know half of what the future holds! I mean – I’ve seen—.”
“Thank you, darling,” Tony sighed and did so over-dramatically to draw attention away from using the pet name in front of Panzer. His boss didn’t seem to notice but Steve did. Luckily, their jeep was raised a few feet off the ground so Panzer wouldn’t be able to see Steve unless he stretched across Tony’s lap because Steve became ridiculously bright red.
“We’re getting there and it’s none of the press’s business what I do with my soulmate,” Tony said, avoiding Steve’s eyes. He felt uncomfortable bringing it up in front of these two. Neither of them personally discussed it. Steve had confessed to liking men when they first met but he didn’t bring it up again. Tony only knew Steve was interested because of the shy smiles or lingering looks he gave to Tony.
“Very,” Steve pressed. “Wade is becoming a big part of your life and I don’t want you to have to split it because we all don’t get along…”
In the background, agents were screaming, the Goblin was laughing, and Peter was sobbing…but all Steve could hear was the roaring of blood in his ears.
With hooded eyes, Steve's gaze rose and returned to Tony's eyes. He leaned down and Tony's heart started beating at an accelerated pace. This couldn’t be real. Tony had to be dreaming...
Very little cloth lay between them and it was dizzyingly arousing knowledge. Peter bit down on his lip to keep from groaning as Wade’s hard length pressed against Peter’s own softened one…not that it was going to stay soft for very long…
“Sir, I have been running their photos through both state and city databases but if neither have been arrested or had a state job then there will most likely be no results.”
Tony slowly pulled to a stop in front of the house in his bright yellow Lamborghini. A pickup truck sat in the driveway and Steve could hear the sound of a TV playing a commercial from the open front window.
Tony’s stomach clenched. He immediately assumed the worst and Schmidt was gone. Tony had left him as soon as he heard the gunshots. The snake
Bucky quirked an eyebrow and leaned closer as he whispered, “Something’s going on between you two, isn’t there?”
Originally, the lawyers were supposed to go to them but Tony decided this would be a perfect outing to be a “secret couple.”
“I knew I should have put padding on the floors,” Tony whimpered and attempted to stretch his muscles but only managed to make the aching worse.
“Apparently, we’re adopting a kid. Did…Do you want kids?” Tony asked Steve, still a little in shocked by the whole idea. Hell, he still wasn't over the fact that a superhero from the future just cockblocked them. He thought they were done with this space time continuum shit.
want those pictures!” Tony countered. “And what should we tell them? I’m engaged to the once dead Captain America?”
Steve snorted and Tony slipped out of the bed. As he walked away, Steve called after him, “Don't keep me waiting too long.”
The audience ate up their banter and Peter smiled happily at his parents as they teased each other. Sophie was forced to return to the topic of life with the Avengers and they finished the segment within the hour.
Natasha lunged forward to attack him but Thor stepped in front of her. Bucky did not move and watched Natasha struggle with the Norse God with a gloomy eye.
“And there are some rumors,” Bucky added. “Whenever we stop in a major city, some fellas in camp noticed Steve would disappear into the less nicer parts. Everyone is trying to figure out what he does. A few guessed right but, luckily, they are just one of many hunches…” Bucky stared at him in disbelief and gasped, “You’re
It felt nearly as bad when he had lost Bucky. He felt so alone and depressed for days afterward that if it weren’t for Solo he didn’t know where he’d be.
“No,” she retorted, putting her hands on her hips. “You are going to give him his space as he sorts this whole mess.”
All the elation and safety Peter felt since waking disappeared and was replaced with an uneasy fear. He demanded, “Where is it? Where you guys waiting for me to wake before throwing it into the sun because I don’t care about seeing it happen…I just want it gone…”
Peter looked at his aunt one last time and then, faced the door, inhaled deeply, and then stepped outside.
Steve threw back his head as a heated groan escaped his lips. He nearly came went he felt the heat coming off Tony’s cock. Steve had never been this turned on before. He could not believe Tony felt the same, figuratively and literally.
Once nicely pantsed, Steve returned to his son and wordlessly picked him up. He sat Peter on his left hip, his uninjured side, and Peter automatically grasped his shirt. His tiny fingers felt for the necklace holding his dog-tags then latched onto them through the fabric.
“It is,” Steve replied, shifting his hold on Peter. “First and foremost, you two are my friends. I don’t want this kind of hatred between my friends. And secondly, we’re a team and I’m the leader. I can’t have these kinds of secrets, especially if Bucky stays. It will break apart the team, I can’t have that happen.”
Steve lay in a hospital bed with his son nestled into his side, sleeping soundly. Tony sat in the chair by the bed, gripping Steve’s hand tightly and the rest of the team surrounded the bed in an odd half circle. Clint leaned on Tony’s chair twirling the remote in his hand. Natasha stood half a foot from him with her arms crossed over her chest and her gaze shifting from the door and Steve repeatedly. At the foot of the bed, stood Thor, gripping his hammer and eyeing Steve’s injuries critically. On the other side of the bed sat Dr. Banner, sitting in the only other chair, looking haggard and sad.
There wasn’t as much of the black mass as there was last time. What remained of Venom was barely enough to snake around his torso a few times. Maybe,
The X-Man was one of the last to arrive but Wade was happy to see him. If it weren’t for Logan and his nose, Venom might still be on Peter.
Tony stared at the suit as he rubbed the army regulated soap into his skin. It had a weird scent to it. It wasn't bad…but it wasn't nice either. Definitely nothing like the more expensive soaps he was used to in the future...
Tony suddenly pushed one of his holograms to Steve and said, “It’s just like a touch screen except you can only see it and not feel it.”
Norman’s people brought Harry over almost every day after school and that only increased once the boys were freed from their school schedule.
Tony taped an ice pack to his shoulder again as a pain continued to linger from yesterday’s rough landing.  He then sat in his driveway with a cup of coffee and his Audi parked next to him, ready to speed off. Despite the coffee, without having slept in the last 24 hours, he was feeling drowsy and almost nodded off a few times.
The first two fetuses died in the womb, killing the mothers along with them. The third killed itself, its mother, and the entire team assigned to it upon its birth. The fourth would have been perfect but it was not born deformed, with its spine exposed. It did not survive long outside of its mother.
He knelt down and kissed Tony again. The familiar feeling of their shared kiss acted like a calming balm, flowing through Tony like a gentle current.  Steve's kisses were the best form of pain relief.
Tony laughed and said, “Of course! It would be a national travesty if I didn’t help out Captain America! And by the way,
“Are you sure?” Steve whispered, cupping his cheek. Their exchange was a long enough that Steve had to pause to make sure this was fine.
“That’s enough, Tony,” he gasped and Steve tore his hands out of his grasp. Tony looked up at him with wide eyes and Steve realized how out of character he acted. Tony was helping him but Steve was acting as if he was doing the exact opposite. He added, “Thank you but I have to go check on my son….Sorry…Thank you… Sorry.”
Peter chuckled and ran his fingers over Wade’s back. He was starting to grow hard too and he slowly rocked his body against Wade. Wade hissed when Peter started but he was quick to move with him, rocking with him and pressing his hips into Peter’s. Jolts of pleasure surged through his body every time their hips collided.
Tony pressed his hand over his wound for a moment as if to stifle the pain and tossed aside his pretzels. Tony swiped any extra blood off his palms and then grabbed the back neck of his shirt and drew it over his head with one hand. He let the shirt fall from his fingers as he looked at his bloody hip. The slash was just above his hipbone and Steve noted the bullet had taken out a good chunk of flesh.
“You sound like Pep, she’d like you if you weren’t all Patrick Swayze,” Tony stated and moved his fingers as if he was casting a spell in Steve’s direction.
“James,” she repeated and hearing her say it solidified it in his mind. There was no questioning it or the memory. This was his name. It did not feel odd like Stepan had.
“…What?” Bruce asked on the behalf of the others. But with one look to Steve, Tony could see his husband knew too.
The small family left quickly, no longer feeling as welcome in the studio as the initially did and it was only when they were in the privacy of their car did Tony say, “I’m sorry she put you in the spotlight like that…”
Wade bit down on his lip to keep his mouth shut. He wanted to tell the voices to shut up but, deep down, his worries began to fester.
Natasha’s smirk melted off her face. She stared expressionlessly at her drink with its the clear liquid and green olives. She wordlessly drew down her glove to show him her zeroed implant.
“…I could help,” Peter whispered. He may have been physically weak at the moment but he still had his spider-sense. He could use it to help the team in the coming fight. He needed to do something to help Pops. He couldn’t be expected to sit around and do
Tony’s parents died just a few months before his 18th birthday, and as heir to the throne of Atra, Tony was required to marry.
Steve was clearly just out of the shower, still very wet and dripping, topless with only a white, luxurious towel around his waist. Now, Steve was big. He was extremely tall, with broad shoulders and defined abs.
Tony was strangely nervous, he was about to see his, well, husband, for the first time in years. His hands were sweaty and his knees were shaky. He finally found the courage to walk out of his room to Steve’s and knocked on his door.
He just wanted to be like everybody else and he couldn’t believe it when a small, boney child asked him to join him in his game. He shot a look at Anna and waited for her to tilt her head and then ran after the little boy.
“I can’t believe I thought that that scribble on the paper was my actual name. Do you still have it?”
That boy occupied Tony’s mind for the rest of his life. That was definitely the weirdest, best interaction he had with another human being outside of his palace. Every time he wished for a normal life, his mind kept wandering back to that moment. He even kept that little piece of paper that was supposed to be their fake marriage certificate. It had never left his pocket in all of those years. As he grew older, Tony tried to use Atra’s resources to find that boy, but he never had any success. After all, Tony didn’t even know his name. His signature on the piece of paper was nothing more than an illegible scribble. Tony eventually made peace with the fact that that bout was just going to live in his memories, destined to never meet again.
He was presented with tons of princes and princesses of neighbouring kingdoms. Tony was forced to attend infinite, boring balls, where royals courted him for a shot at the most sought-after throne of the Ten Kingdoms. But Tony, Tony wasn’t interested in any of them. He just wanted to get out of his uncomfortably tight clothes, take that heavy crown off his head and work and hide in his lab to work on his incredibly advanced technology.
Tony ignored all of the comments and questions coming from the court. He looked at Jarvis, as shocked as anybody else.
“Our Majesty here married a lovely boy many many years ago in a park when he followed his parents on a business trip in Brooklyn” Jarvis explained.
“No…Peter…We’re not going to have this argument again…You need to stay here,” Dad sighed and Peter glanced up at him. His armor was unable to cover the cast on his arm so it was exposed and his face shield was still up revealing a pale and wearied face. His dad was in no condition to fight. If he was going then Peter should be able to too!
He stood and eagerly added his input as he, Bucky, Sam, and Clint all provided different views on the matter. Tony, not much of a sports lover, called for a toast for the birthday boy, drawing the other adults to the kitchen for more alcohol.
Steve nodded, he was right. Steve would probably not sleep at all tonight and think of all of the ways he could stop his best friend.
It was hard to think positively when think those very thoughts could skewer Wade again. Peter just nodded and leaned down to kiss Wade and let his mouth distract him from the monster he’d created wrapped around his body.
Coulson felt as if the world suddenly spun off its axis. Last month he dealt with the Norse God of Thunder who, in actuality, resided from another world. Now he did not find Cap’s tomb but…but the place where Cap
“Sir, I cannot allow you access to the upper levels due to Security Code 14.75,” Jarvis stated when they tried to use the elevator from the garage.
Steve’s face felt like it was burning bright red as Tony slipped away from him with a wanton smile. The engineer started to walk again and Steve watched him dumbly, unable to really process his jumbled thoughts after such a dirty promise.
“You two always told me the story growing up. It was my own personal fairy tale,” Peter murmured. “And then you two shared this secret smile at the end of the story and I always wondered what it meant. Maybe it was you remembering this moment today?”
Tony separated the distance between them and pressed himself flush to Steve. The breath caught in Steve’s throat as he felt the mold of Tony’s body against his. He grasped one of Tony’s elbows to keep him close. Tony smiled wickedly at him and ran his hands up Steve’s chest until he finally reached his tie. He tugged on it, pulling his neck down and closer to Tony’s face.
Tony seemed to make up his mind about something because he suddenly gripped Steve’s thigh as a way of letting him know they were parting and then slid off the table. Tony walked over to Bruce and asked, “Is there anything I can do?”
,” Peter gasped. He withdrew his hands from behind Wade’s head and cupped both corners of his jaw. He lifted Wade’s head and, when their gazes collided again, Peter whispered, “Do you know what the first thing I noticed about you when you took off your mask?”
If Steve was truly attracted to men and if his soul implant reset and he met this man…his life would continue to be hard. Bucky didn’t want to think on that possibility either.
Eventually, Pepper left and Tony returned to his work on the reactor. Steve curled up with his tablet on the couch and stared at the blank screen as he contemplated what to do.
With his heart accelerating, and his fear spiking from not knowing where Tony was, Steve got to his feet and hissed, “I’m going to ask you again. Where am I?” When she did not reply, he demanded, “Who are you??”
Uncle Bucky grabbed his shoulders and his fingers bit into Peter’s flesh. His uncle knelt to his level and hissed, “Don’ ya dare do anythin’ like that again! Ya hear me??”
When the two peoples finally converged into one, it was a loud and boisterous affair. The Americans wore orange jumpsuits too though they had small American flags on their right shoulders. Whereas the Russians were all pale and had either blond or brown hair, the American group was a mix of races and colors. Steve was excited to see such diversity. His own team, the Howling Commandos, was the first team to ever have mixed race in the Army and that was only because Steve had fought adamantly for it. And now it seemed to be a norm. How much more did the future change?
With his heart rate slowly starting to rise, Steve was finally able to fully wake and remember. He was supposed to die in the plane crash and he seemed to be in some kind of recovery room but…none of his friends were there. The Commandos would’ve done like they had with Tony’s illness and stayed beside him in shifts to be there for him when he woke.
Steve wound both of his arms around Tony and Tony leaned back into him. They both wordlessly watched as everyone realized the Goblin was gone…until he wasn’t.
With a suggestive twitch to his eyebrows, Tony huskily murmured, “I was thinking, maybe, we both take a peek under our clothes and see what happens from there…”
Smirking, the Red Skull shook his head and stated, “I don’t want to kill you. I just want to destroy what makes you,
“I am not the more amazing thing, surprisingly,” the robot stated, making Steve jump. Its glowing eyes hadn’t left Steve since it entered the room and it stepped closer to Steve and held out its hand. “It’s an honor to meet you, Captain.”
Whatever that meant made Friday set off the priority alarm and the security shutters began to lower.
There was also a black and white photo of the Howling Commandoes, Peggy Carter, and Howard Stark. It was another group shot with the Commandoes posing with their weapons and Steve was in the middle again with Bucky Barnes at his side in the middle.
He had the ability to save people...but the first thing he needed to do was right the wrongs his company had created.
“No!” Tony gasped. “Let him go!” Tony got to his feet and said, “Let me handle it! Let me…let me fuck up again…” Tony groaned and said, “Ugh, I need to call Pepper…”
“Pete, get down. I ain’t leavin’ ya alone,” his uncle said, his Brooklyn accent crawled in his statement as his annoyance grew.
He played with Tony's hair, parting it from his face as an excuse to touch it. His hair kept bouncing back so Steve had the perfectly endless excuse to keep touching him. To Steve’s delight, Tony continued to sleep.
Tony smiled sweetly at him and gently kissed his lips, prolonging it by parting his lips and caressing the inside of his mouth with his soft tongue.
Coulson cleared his throat, reminding them that they were not alone. Both Tony and Steve flushed and Tony stepped back from Steve. They had forgotten there were others there and they most likely heard every word of their conversation as it got heated.
Steve playfully pushed at him and flushed slightly from embarrassment. He retorted, “You’re also the only man I have
Tony plastered on his blank board members’ meeting face and truthfully answered, “No, you keep the hair.”
Steve chuckled again and a small smile twitched against his lips. He bent down and cupped Tony’s face. Steve drew him into a kiss. He boldly slid his tongue in and enlisted a soft moan from Tony. His mouth tasted similarly to Steve’s but his was a stronger coffee so he tasted more bitter.
He had her waking early every morning sharing a silent breakfast, doing exercises and stretches to strengthen her body, and working her on her snipping skills throughout the day. Mostly they practiced on paper targets, deep into the woods outside of the city, but, sometimes, they were assigned living targets by the Academy and her instructor helped her in her aiming and practice with them. The assassinations were minor and nothing like what she be expected to do once she graduated from the Black Widow Program.
Peter crawled over him and then lightly touched his abdomen, just above his cock. His fingers lightly grazed the base of his shaft and Peter commented, “You’ve got no pubic hair.”
The next instant, the familiar sound of an explosion blasted over the speaker of his phone, so loud, that if Tony screamed, Steve would not have been able to hear it.
He took a wary step forward, to better see the contents, and those dark contents exploded, enveloping Peter in its dark embrace.
They took the same car his dad and Happy picked him up in: boring, indistinct, and with tinted windows. They weren’t followed out of the building though the encampment outside had grown a little smaller.
They waited until the alert was raised at the base, signaling the Avengers’ attack, and then they moved in.
Bucky’s eyes suddenly narrowed and his pupils became tiny pinpricks. Steve did not have a chance to formulate the danger before Bucky clenched his hovering fist and punched Steve. Steve fell back and Bucky pounced on him. He screamed bloody murder as he hit Steve in the head repeatedly. Stars flashed before his eyes. Through the blood, he gurgled, “Buc – .”
Steve smiled that small, tender smile he reserved for Tony alone and whispered, “I was thinking about the future…about all the nights to come where we can make love as loud as we want to be…about tomorrow morning and waking up with you in my arms again…and then all the mornings after that.”
Bucky and Natasha exchanged glances and Natasha replied, “A friend gave me a call. I need to investigate something in New York…”
He painfully groaned and he saw Steve’s head snap over in his direction and his eyes turned a darker blue.
“Sorry about spoiling our island getaway,” Tony suddenly murmured. “I was expecting to celebrate your mistrial very differently…”
Tony had invited everyone to join in on the even, including Thor, and they were all delightfully surprised but elated to hear back from their ally. He would come.
“In the future,” Tony started, wanting to distract his super soldier. “…You were talking about going out on a date. Why don’t we go out and do that today?”
Steve was staying in Tony’s guest room, right down the hall from where Tony slept, so he tread lightly as he left the bedroom. On the third day Steve was staying with him, Tony had offered him an entire floor to live but Steve frantically turned him down and he’d been staying in Tony’s guest room ever since. Steve smiled to himself as he remembered Tony’s generosity and his melancholy faded slightly.
Bucky continued in a whisper, “It got so bad that I began to imagine your inevitable death. It tore my soul to just envision my life without you. I prayed all night to God that he would save you.” Bucky paused and ran both his thumbs over the top of Steve’s hand, tracing the bones beneath. He whispered, “It was in that moment, I realized how much you meant to me. I realized how much I loved you…”
Tony stayed in his friend’s hold. He took comfort from it but, mostly, he stayed in it because he was too dazed to move.
Peter paused, wanting to discuss something more personal with his dad for the last couple of hours ever since his conversation with Wade about the media.
“Go ahead, Tony,” Steve whispered, carding his fingers through Tony’s hair in a soothing manner that drew Tony deeper into unconsciousness. Steve lightly kissed his forehead and promised, “I’ll stay here and try to keep those nightmares at bay…”
With the smile brought forth from his laughter, Steve kissed him again and Tony stupidly had to blink back tears of joy. He was so happy to be here with Steve and knowing this was forever?...it choked him up.
Tony grunted in acknowledgement but most of his concentration was in breathing…well, breathing and contemplating Steve’s fate that is…
Tony shook his head and whispered, “I don’t feel strong…I don’t know what I’ll do without him. He’s my
Thank you so much for your patience, real life has been quite busy this summer and this chapter is thrice the size of my usual chapters so it took much longer to get out than usual! But it's here and the end is in sight! I promise I will work diligently on the next chapter to get it out MUCH sooner! :)
Steve turned beet red and looked around at the buildings looking down at them. He gasped, “Do you think we were seen??”
Every piece of him was how he remembered: his hard muscles, soft lips, the tiny happy sighs he made when they kissed, the way his fingers latched onto Tony…and those blue eyes. How could he forget their shade? They were the color of pure blue tropical waters and Tony wanted to sink into their warm depths and never leave.
Wade’s eyes popped open more and he was surprised they stayed in his head. Peter’s birthday was less than a week away. His baby boy was going to be older and he didn’t even know it!?
It'll only be two or three chapters more, with a lot of skipping ahead, but I couldn't just end it without exploring a little bit more of their futures! :)
Steve froze and, for a brief moment, he relaxed and held Tony close and tenderly grasped Tony’s arm. This was nothing like the brush of lips from their first kiss. Tony's mouth was hot, wet, pressed hard against Steve's, and he sucked lightly at his lips. Tony's mouth made Steve's toes curl in a way that Peggy's kisses never did.
Bucky wordlessly nodded and Tony was happy to see his gaze no longer looked so dead. He was obviously very confused.
Thor nodded and tightened his hold on his hammer. He said and did nothing more. For a moment, Tony wondered how long it would take to work.
“I am sorry,” she whispered so low that she doubt any of the humans in the room would have heard it. She pulled the metal object from her pocket and slowly but cautiously slid it into one of his curled hands.
His secretary nodded and rushed out of the tent, pausing only to smile at Steve. Steve didn’t notice and went over to Howard.
SHIELD scared away the populace and whenever Venom got ahold one of the agents, all the other agents fired down upon him with all their strength.
Steve shrugged and replied, “I am so happy right now with you and Peter that I can’t imagine us being
Outsiders looking in may think their family was slightly dysfunctional but to Steve, it was more than perfect. He had his soulmate, an amazing son, a team of people who would fight and be his friends until the end, and his best friend, a man he thought dead. He wouldn’t trade this for the world.
Steve shook his head to rid himself of his petty fears. He could do this. He survived worse than this. He would not lose until he gave up and there was no way Steve would ever give up.
Steve blinked. That was not the reaction he was expecting! Tony was jumping up and down babbling excitedly and Steve watched him ruefully.
Tony hissed, turning to him with his fists clenched at his sides. He demanded, "Why would you do that? Was he threatening you?? Did he force you-?"
“Please do not call her ‘Ms. Tyler,’” Tony grumbled from behind his laptop. “’Ms.’ makes her sound civilized.”
Tony paused and turned to Peter. The boy had paused the game and Harry was looking questionably at him for doing so. Peter explained in one simple question, “Can I show Harry your lab?”
“I now turn to you, the public, be Captain Rogers’ heroes. Help Steve. Voice your outrage. Let’s bring our Captain home.”
He went to his room first. He went straight to his closet and avoided the clothes Tony had left on the floor. He had not wanted to touch them until Tony came back and now…His mind went blank.
“We have to,” Steve replied, his fingers digging into James’ flesh. “At least until the others get here!”
Steve stopped keeping track of how many days Tony was held captive. Instead, he remembered to fleeting moments he had with his soulmate. The kisses they shared when Tony would pause in his work or the moments Tony threw everything aside and dragged Steve to a newly materialized couch or bed and make out with him the rest of the night.
Bucky began tugging up his shirt and moving his hands tracing his hands over his abdominal muscles. He trailed kisses down the vein in his neck then bit into the flesh. Steve threw back his head and groaned, “Oh God, Buck—!”
– and I do not know…I think we need to sit down and talk through everything…He told me he was not going to give up on us being together in the end and I need to get him to understand that it is not going to happen…” Steve scooped more apple sauce and fed it to Peter. He waited for Peter to start chewing the apple chunks before continuing, “And if Bucky is still willing to talk to me at that point then I want to ask him about what is going on between him and Natasha.”
Steve frowned unhappily and Tony’s back. He wanted to reach out and touch him but clenched his hands together instead. Steve dropped his head, focusing on his hands, and spoke from the heart. He whispered, “I don’t want there to be any conflict between us. The future is uncertain and I know I’m to blame but…I’m not afraid of it. I’d sacrifice myself to Hydra a million times over if it meant saving your life. I only got a glimpse of the future thanks to you, but I’d still make those same choices even if I had the complete knowledge of what awaited me. You’re important to me, Tony. I’m sorry I told your father about you but I’m not sorry for trying to help you…”
Which was why he was still sitting in the back of the car after Happy picked him up and parked in the underground garage. His mask was on and he was clutching his hands tightly, trying to work up the courage to remove it for Peter. He ignored Happy as the man tried to beckon him out of the car.
“So, is Wade a part of the Avengers now?” Rhodes asked. “…On that note, how did all of us join? We all were kinda just thrown together?”
Natasha was the informal version of Natalia but she still remembered it to be her true name even though everyone else in her life knew her as “Natasha” only.
It was unusual to have an implant on the right arm, especially in the west but, in the Soviet Union, where some soul implants were obtained illegally, a good number were put on the wrong arm like it was on her mate.
As they shared in their intimate moment, they missed the close exchange between the other two in the infirmary as Wade put his hand shyly over Peter’s. Peter did not pull his away and let the contact linger. They smiled warmly at each other and then Wade hesitated for a second before finally fully removing his mask.
For a moment, he contemplated what it would be like to fall those hundreds of stories. With his serum, would he survive? Was he still mortal? Could he die like anyone else…like Tony? Steve shook his head to rid himself of such thoughts. He would not do it and even if he really wanted to he could not do that to Peter. Even though he was a horrible father, he was still his father and Peter loved him.
“Good morning, beloved,” Tony whispered. He tilted his head and pressed a gentle kiss onto Steve’s lips. Tony shifted closer to Steve, draping his arm over Steve’s side, and pressing his face into Steve’s chest. He released a happy sigh and murmured, “I like the look of you in my bed.”
“Come here you,” Tony commanded and grasped his jaw for a deep kiss. Steve sunk into the bed with a happy moan and threw his heavy arms over Tony, digging them both in deeper.
and violently shook out his limbs as he scrambled to push away the dream phantom of Tony. Gasping for breath, he wildly looked around his dark bedroom but saw no sign of his friend. It hadn’t been real. It had all been a dream. Steve let out a sigh of relief and his head fell back and lightly struck the headboard.
She grabbed his arms and pulled back the loose sweater to check his skin for damage then tsked when she saw it had her emblem on it.
They were going to be leaving early in the morning. Colonel Phillips had them moving out to their next assignment. Steve had been getting the coals so he’d have one more night of a warm sleep before he returned to the thin covering of his tent and tiny sleeping bag.
was going. They even planned a time and place to meet after the second night watch started their shift. Most would be asleep and wouldn’t notice their departure. Steve may have been wary at first, but now he was obviously willing to try it out. After all, they both had nothing to lose in the end.
“They’re not going to get you,” Steve whispered in a tired promise. They sat in an alley and, as Solo rocked, Steve watched citizens walk by. The people were excited. They were walking to a nearby event, some kind of festival.
He collapsed behind a dumpster, still clutching his shirt tightly to his body like it was a lifeline. He took several deep breaths, needing the oxygen to help keep his body from shaking more than it already was.
“Hey,” Tony murmured, cupping the side of Steve’s face. He sat a knee in the place he would occupy at Steve’s side and murmured, “Pretend they’re not there and it’s just us, like last night.”
The glass walls and door darkened just as Pepper walked through them. With a scared expression, she looked to the container then to Tony and then back to the container again. She finally gasped, “That’s Sergeant Barnes.”
“Master Parker?” Jarvis questioned, the phone vibrated slightly in his back pocket from the rise of intonation in the AI’s voice.
At that moment, Tony reconsidered everything: he was going to tell Steve everything, save his life, he would kiss him, make love with him, and share a future with him.
Deadpool froze and seemed to stop breathing. Suddenly, he surged forward and grabbed Logan's uniform. Shaking him, Wade gasped, melodramatically, “BRING ME!”
“Cap.” Steve turned back to Coulson and the man explained, “SHIELD was created after your plane went down. Your friends Peggy Carter and Howard Stark were some of its founding members. Our purpose is, and has always been, to protect the country from outside threats.”
“Let’s check it out,” Tony replied with a grin and opened the file. He assumed it had been started again during the Cold War but the dates displayed were resent and then…
Steve chewed on his lip nervously. Coulson had lifted the restriction on Bucky’s living conditions two months ago. Bucky was allowed to leave the Tower unaccompanied. The prospect still made Steve uneasy. He had seen Bucky slip into his Winter Soldier state that was uncaring and ignorant of the value of life. He was the only one on the team that could get him out of it and he had to do it a number of times as Bucky remembered more pieces of his past. It had been many months since his last episode and supposedly Bucky was in control now but it still made Steve nervous.
Peter peered fearfully at the cylinder and asked, “Pops?” Or was it Dad? Why would either want to give Peter such a dangerous thing…Whatever it was, did they not know it was dangerous?
Tony felt sick. This was why Peter was spending time with Deadpool?! What was Peter doing dating that madman? Had Deadpool manipulated Peter into the relationship??
“O-Of course, Peter,” Dad gargled with emotion. He buried his face into Peter’s hair and repeated, “Of course…”
At that moment, however, he wasn’t going to celebrate Peter’s countdown. Steve stated, “Uncle Bucky’s safe word is not a joke.”
Aunt Tasha ran her hand over Peter’s head as she passed him then squeezed onto the armchair with Uncle Bucky.
Both men nodded curtly but made no move to sit down. Tony spared one last look at Steve and then cut communication off to the outside as he commanded, “J, run a systems check.”
Wade’s rocking slowed to a stop and then he wiggled against Peter teasingly with a chuckle. Wade murmured against his lips, “Breakfast is served.”
Gabe stilled, and he pulled the stethoscope out of his ears. He stated, “I need to listen to check everything, including your heart and lungs. We need to rule out everything.”
Peter slept through the night. No nightmares or lingering fears about the reveal of his identity kept him up.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Tony chuckled darkly. He let go of his reactor and stiffly pulled his shirt back on. He slowly did up the buttons and Howard watched it all with a speculative look on his face.
The sun was just starting to set and, as always, the sunrise looked beautiful against the Pacific Ocean.  He only spared the view a moment’s glance before dropping his head into his hands and finally unleashed the anxiety attack he had been keeping at bay. He hyperventilated mostly and then cried…for Bucky
Steve snorted and they tried to keep quiet as they changed places but it was hard because they did so while trying to touch each other as much as possible.
“It appeared to be a man in a giant rhinoceros costume,” Jarvis replied. “Master Parker, you are no longer safe. I am notifying the Avengers and I am sure one of them will come to assist you.”
Tony paused to groan appreciatingly as he took comfort from the soft mattress and Steve’s weight. Steve took the moment to purely appreciate the man beneath him: the way his thick eyelashes curled, the natural red of his lips, the cuts and curves of his body and how they were all angled toward Steve and Steve alone.
Tony couldn’t speak just occasionally moan. His eyes were glassy and full of pain, but focused on Steve as if he were begging him to stop what was happening to him.
Bucky shook his head and said, “You don’t need me anymore. You do not need to escape your pain. Stark is alive.”
,” Steve hissed he reached out to him but only felt residual heat. Tony was gone. Steve’s heart began to beat faster and he called out, “
The Iron Man suit flew into view, over the treetops and Tony. It did not pause to pick up Tony but flew straight at Ross. Ross grunted as the suit impacted him and propelled them both several yards away from Steve and Peter.
Bruce peered sadly up at Steve and Steve saw in his eyes a battle raging within in him. Bruce did not want to tell him. What did Steve have to sacrifice?
Tony took out his suit as soon as he got home. He saved the village Everhart had shown him and found his new purpose.
The inside had totally collapsed from one of the explosions caused by either one of the Iron Men or Kilian’s men. The area where Pepper had been was buried in debris. There was no sign of her or anyone else.
“Try not to sound too impressed there, buddy,” Tony sarcastically said. “I’m not done with it. I need to strengthen it and add on a paint job…Do you want the red star again? Or would you like to try a different symbol? Or maybe nothing at all?”
Bucky kept a close eye on Steve like he always did but he also kept an equally close eye on Tony. Even though the journey was an easy one by a soldier’s standards, it was not so on the time traveler. As the days went on, he started to notice small changes in the man. He was getting thinner and moving slower. The change was gradual but, to those of them who were looking for it, to was glaringly obvious.
“Buck…” Steve didn’t know where to begin. He made a promise to Tony to keep his secret and protect the future. But this was his best friend, a man he considered his brother… He’d never lied to Bucky before which was why Bucky was so concerned right now. He knew Steve’s deepest and darkest secrets, especially the one he thought Steve had let slip.
“That is not ominous at all,” Peter stated sarcastically, waving at the poisonous title and trying to get his friend off of this idea. “Why would Mac label it as venom? It might be dangerous.”
There was a murmur down the hall and Tony pressed one last quick kiss onto his mouth and then pulled him back into the hall before anyone saw them pushed together so intimately. Steve grabbed his basket and returned to Tony’s side. Tony smiled warmly at him and they began to walk toward the coal pile like nothing had happened.
Steve nodded and grasped Tony’s hand tightly and cupped the side of his face again and pressed a kiss onto his forehead. He assured Tony, “Everything will be ok.”
Neither of them slept a wink last night and he knew Steve was concerned about Tony now too. Tony hadn’t even attempted to go to bed. He needed to be aware and involved in every aspect of this until that monster was gone. Only then could he relax.
Wade would gladly remove the mask for Peter. He was already yearning to see Peter with his own eyes and to see him smile
Peter slept the entire day away. He didn’t once see the sunlight. He’d escaped Venom in the early hours before sunrise and had awoken in his bed a little after sunset.
The Goblin towered over him and glared down at Tony with red eyes than were made redder by Tony’s repulsors and smoking.
Vision’s grip slipped on the powerline as he jerked in the young woman’s direction and the current stopped flowing through Wade and Peter.
Steve carded his fingers into Tony’s scalp and his hazel eyes became half-lidded with pleasure from the touch. He continued to massage Tony’s scalp and slowly rocked his hips with the rise and fall of Tony’s mouth.
For an immeasurable amount of time, Steve moved through the world like a ghost and merely lived by shadowing Solo.
“You two fell in love by just watching each other,” Bucky scoffed. “You’re literally a freaking fairy tale romance.”
Tony paused for a long time as he thought about their time together and then finally whispered, “I don’t know if you are here right now or if you’re watching from somewhere up high or if I’m just wasting air but…I love you. I still love you, even right now, knowing you’re – you’re dead…I miss you so much and it breaks my heart every time I have to remind it you are gone…” Tony couldn’t look at the statue’s face anymore and he whispered, “You were my great love, Steve. I doubt I will ever find someone as amazing as you were and even though we had such a short time, I’m glad we had it…I’m glad I had you…” Tony wiped a tear out of his eye and said, “Bucky is doing good, he’d be doing great if you were here but I think I’m doing a good enough job. The future is also looking brighter. Hydra is finally being destroyed. Your mission is almost done…and that bill for same sex marriage is going to be passed in a year or two so…so I’m going to uphold my promise to you. I know you won’t be the first in line to get married anymore but…but I’m going to be there all the same and I think I might come out and tell people about this amazing man I would’ve married…because I would have…I would have married you. I would have spent the rest of my life with you…”
His husband remained unresponsive and Steve was finding it harder to breathe. He cautiously turned him over, his breathing growing shallower as he did. He kept reminding himself that Tony had moved a moment before but…that was before he was thrown from the Goblin’s grasp. Could he be..?
“Do you promise not to say anything until I have said my piece?” Tony asked, his eyes finally lifting to meet Steve’s gaze.
“I’m going to remove your arm for a little while,” Tony stated, his voice shaking a little in his fury. “It’ll be a few days until I can get you a new one.”
Tony shivered and reached out to Steve but he was no longer at his side. Tony tiredly patted the bed but there was no trace of Steve. He pushed himself up with a grumble and the light from his arc reactor lit up the room enough to show there was no sign of the super soldier.
No longer burdened with fear and the need for silence. Steve was loud with his moans and gasped the sweetest words of encouragement that made Tony pause a few times just to kiss his super soldier silent to help his heart rate lower enough so it would not explode out of his chest from the sentiment.
“Wish it was under better circumstances,” Gabe stated ironically. He gently turned Tony’s head to the side and inspected the wound. As he looked, Bucky and Peggy came into the tent and went straight to them.
She got to her feet and slipped out of the room as quickly as she said her name. The others wordlessly parted for her and watched her leave with troubled expressions.
Steve gently reached out and put a hand over Tony’s. Tony instantly relaxed into his touch. Tony whispered, “Mary hated him, she cannot have willingly stayed there.”
“Oh,” he said, unable to hold back his distain. Internally, his anger simmered lightly to the surface. He trusted Deadpool just as much as he could throw him without using his Iron Man suit, and that wasn't far at all... He didn't know how the merc convinced Peter to enter into the relationship but Tony was sure as hell going to make sure it came to an end.
“Look, he likes blondes too,” Tony said, pointing to the picture of Peter and a blonde girl proudly holding up their diplomas with their arms around each other. She was beautiful and, by the way Peter held her, Tony could tell she was special to him.
Peter's shower put his to shame. It instantly went to Peter’s preferred temperature and was steaming in seconds. Wade counted at least four shower-heads before his gaze was drawn back to Peter as he pulled Wade inside.
“Damn right, you better be sorry,” Uncle Bucky murmured into the top of Peter’s head. Aunt Tasha lightly touched Uncle Bucky’s arm and his trembling lessened.
“We…Colonel Phillips has declared him MIA but…” Her breath shuddered and she whispered, “Tony told Steve he wouldn’t survive this mission but he went anyways. That wonderfully, stupid brave man refused to let Hydra win.”
Unlike last time, Peter encouraged Wade to press his hips to Peter’s. Wade was always one step behind him, following his lead like Peter had asked of him. Peter would have teased him for being such a gentleman if it weren’t for the fact that they were both trying to smother each other with their mouths.
Steve looked between the two men, stepped back between them and pulled them both into a bold hug. They grumbled but from that point on Tony and Bucky had developed an odd comradery which involved mostly shooting insults at each other and talking about movie Steve had still yet to see. It was more than Steve could ever hope for.
Clint had commandeered the TV again and Thor sat with him. They were watching one of the Star Wars episodes and Thor was loudly commenting on the miraculous feats of the great and wise warrior Yoda but paused when he saw Steve and Tony.
Tony was playing cool for Steve, but he was worried. He wasn’t 100% positive that nothing had changed. What if he disappeared forever? What if Peter was killed? What if something happened to the past Steve?
Clint strolled in, pulling his arrows off his back, and said, “Even with all the stupid things I have done, I have never managed to get on SHIELD’s shit list so kudos to all of you.”
Peter broke away from his uncle before he could hear another word. He ran blindly away from him. He would not let himself think about what anything that happened in the last few minutes could mean. He ran toward the source of the explosion only thinking of Pops and reaching him.
Steve turned to find his mate staring at him with sleepy eyes. The toaster dinged and he hopped over to it to change out the bread and Tony snorted, “I’m mated to the male version of Snow White.”
Tony dropped the towel, lowered himself to his knees, and...Jesus Christ...Steve nearly fell to the floor. Tony gave him no other warning. One moment he was grinning wickedly at Steve and the next he was sucking his cock.
“And Tony?” Steve asked, remembering his husband had come for them. He glanced around the room it was in shambles but there was no sign of Iron Man or Venom. Steve’s heart clenched painfully as he pondered both their fates.
Steve felt his jaw slacken as it all came together. Guilt hit him and he whispered, “You and Pepper broke up not long after that…”
Steve felt like he was moving in slow motion as he reached out to his fiancé. Tony seemed to be moving at normal speed so Steve wasn’t quick enough to catch him.
They hadn’t gone straight to the Tower, however, and drove out to an open field. There they called out to Thor, asking for more Asgardian liquor. They did it more for a laugh than for actual results…but Thor showed up in a bright beam of light wearing an equally bright smile and holding two sealed barrels. From there they went to the Tower and the rest of the night was iffy.
The last couple of days had gone by similarly. Tony would come across Steve and pull him away for a quick kiss. Or he’d privately whisper endearments to him when no one else could hear. At night, they’d spend more time together in the secret embrace of the forest…but that time was dwindling to an end.
