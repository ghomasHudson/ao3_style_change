And Sherlock does, without even going into rehab.
Mycroft understands though, even if nobody else does. Mycroft knows Sherlock doesn't see the deaths, he just sees the mystery behind it all.
John just turns into John, not the Doctor and Sherlock prefers talking to John, because he's more fun than his skull and John tries to teach him the rules, not succeeding, but he tries. Sherlock appreciates the effort.
His homework is boring and too easy, so Sherlock doesn't do it any more. This annoys his teacher though, and he has a go at Sherlock in front of the class, who snigger. Sherlock doesn't have any friends, because everybody assume, and that annoys Sherlock.
Mycroft isn't like that though, and Sherlock likes Mycroft for that. Mycroft is nice to him, even when they do experiments together and play games and Sherlock messes them up because he gets too excited. Mycroft doesn't mind that ether.
She wears foundation three days a week and lip gloss everyday. Sherlock doesn't normally like eyes, but Amy has pretty ones. They are just green, and Sherlock likes that. Her lips are a little too full for her face, and her noise a little too pointed, but Sherlock doesn't mind that. She always has one piece of hair that falls out when ever she puts it up.
Mummy keeps inviting people over for Sherlock to play with, but Sherlock thinks they are all boring and doesn't talk to them.
Roger had came home that night, his noise red and inflamed from coke, the nerves visible on his arm from heroin and Sherlock could see all his nerves around his eyes that where blood shot. He had traces off coke on his trouser legs, the smell of smoke and cannabis clinging to his clothes. His clothes where wrinkled and he been wearing them for at least three days, his hair limp and greasy, stuck up on one side where he'd been laying on it.
Sherlock is twenty-five and has killed a man, his only friend, and because of Mycroft, Sherlock walks free.
Sherlock thinks they are strange because he was only telling the truth.
Roger yells a lot now too, screams in Sherlock's face and Sherlock hates it, because Roger has blue eyes with a yellow rim and sapphire, ultramarine and navy blue streaks and Sherlock's sure if he looks hard enough he can see different shades of green too and it's too much detail for Sherlock to look at so Sherlock doesn't look.
Sherlock doesn't listen to what his Mummy says on the phone, because her voice sounds strange and it confuses Sherlock. He hears the voice on the other end of the phone say 'calm down' to Mummy.
Sherlock is forty and John is forty-five and is getting older. John's tired, and Sherlock doesn't know how to make things easier.
Sometimes, Sherlock wakes up in the middle of the night to hear Roger pacing in the kitchen muttering to himself. When Sherlock points it out the next morning, Roger always gets defensive so Sherlock learns not to say anything.
Sherlock is twenty-five and has blood on his hands. He's shaking and doesn't understand why, because death doesn't affect him. Roger's bleeding on the floor, and Sherlock has done his best to keep his head on. He's called the police and an ambulance. He's called Mycroft too.
Sherlock is nine, and doesn't have any friends. He doesn't understand why this makes Father angry, Mummy sad and Mycroft worry. Sherlock prefers bee's to people. Sherlock doesn't like the children in school, they all tell him things he already knows because they think he doesn't know anything.
Too much has happened since Mycroft left, and Sherlock doesn't have a mind palace yet to bury it in. He does a lot of 'stimming' though, which helps him, but worries Mummy and makes Father mad. Sherlock doesn't want to upset Mummy, but sometimes Father scares him and people confuse him so he has too.
A week later Amy's mother catches them making out on Amy's bed, and Mrs. Falls tells Sherlock he can't see Amy any more. Mummy is upset too, and Sherlock hates upsetting Mummy. She tells Sherlock that he shouldn't look at girls or treat girls like that. Sherlock isn't sure what she means, but doesn't want to upset Mummy, so Sherlock doesn't look at girls any more.
Sherlock isn't dumb, he sees things differently to everybody else, and he sees things nobody else does. The teachers talk to Sherlock in a high tone that seems to get higher and squeaker the younger the child is, and this annoys Sherlock. It makes his ears hurt, so he blocks them out but then doesn't know what they were trying to tell him, so they think Sherlock's dumb too. Sherlock tells them that they are the dumb ones, and should stop sucking on Helium. This gets him sent to time out again.
Sherlock hates it, because it means admitting he's wrong.
After a few hours in a holding cell, Lestrade accepts Sherlock offer and Sherlock demonstrates how observant and smart he really is. It takes him three days to find out who organises it all, then a month and they have arrested thirty-seven people.
Sherlock doesn't cry at the funeral and one of Mummy's friends calls him heartless.
Mycroft doesn't talk to Sherlock like he's different, and he never changes his voice unless they're sharing a secret. Sherlock likes talking to Mycroft, because his voice always stays the same, unless he's talking to Mummy. Mycroft is always telling Sherlock that he's smart too, smarter than anybody else in his class.
“J-Jawn,” Sherlock sighed, his lips still seeking the doctor’s.
And that’s when the detective knelt before the doctor and placed his head full of soft curls against John’s hands.
John swallowed and looked down at his hands. His body felt frozen.
“eeeee ooooooo.”
“Like no one else,” was the reply, John barely saying the words, lost in the smooth motion of Sherlock’s hand down and back, down and back the length of his body.
“It looks really…it’s amazing,” John confessed, shaking his head, but Sherlock shot him a look of doubt. “I’m telling the truth, Sherlock. I would never lie to you. It’s puffy right now, remember. It’s going to need a lot more time.”
“Yes, and I want to keep you here. Right here,” John claimed, pulling Sherlock even closer. They kissed, tasting the salt of each other’s tears. John dug his fingers into Sherlock’s back, fisting the silken gown. Sherlock explored John, tracing his hairline, his ear, his jawline with those tantalizing fingers. Lips on lips grew to tentative tongues, mouths widening. John could sense Sherlock was not altogether inexperienced, but must less so than he, so the doctor taught the eager student.
Yes, the visit went very well, and Sherlock heeded John’s words and behaved. The detective was charming, in fact, with John’s gray cap offsetting the color of his eyes, dutifully listening (or appearing to listen, John knew the look when nothing was entering Sherlock’s hard drive) to the doctor, and even a sweet “tank yu” at the end. It had been a difficult appointment, John knew. Dr. Wadsworth had a firm demeanor, insisting on taking off the bandages over Sherlock’s nose and ear and taking pictures of their condition for the plastic surgeon; listening to his heart, taking his blood pressure, and poking and prodding.
“Sherlock, let’s talk about this before you get all upset,” John soothed, standing. But it was too late. Red splotches of anger mottled Sherlock’s chest and neck and he shook his head heatedly. He held his hands up, palms toward John as if pushing him away.
Mrs. Hudson surprised John by bursting into tears. “Oh, I’m usually not this emotional. But it’s all so sad, you know?”
“Yes, it was,”John replied, smiling. “I stole them. You knew that as soon as I told you the story, didn’t you.”
A familiar restlessness began to grow in Sherlock. Where the detective had once craved mental stimulation with cases, there now seemed to be a physical anxiousness about him. He would tap his hands and feet almost continuously, pace, fidget. John encouraged Sherlock to accompany him on a walk, but instead the detective would push back the furniture in the living room and nimbly dancing on his feet, would punch the air in a boxing training routine until his forehead glistened with sweat. Come evening, John would prepare a homemade meal and they would sit and eat it while watching the evening news. Nights came early and Sherlock would disappear into his room once again, and ten minutes later, John would follow with the paper tucked under his arm. However, the cot had been folded up and placed against the wall and John slept in his own bedroom once again.
“No. Ew okay?” Sherlock rasped.
“Mmph,” was the reply, and John could not determine if it was a sound of agreement or protest as he himself stifled a yawn.
“You fine?”
“I got word that Sherlock was here,” she said shyly. “I just wanted to say ‘hello’.”
“I’ve got you. It’s all right. It’s me.” John’s hand stroked Sherlock’s chest, from side to side, up on one shoulder and down again, each new portion touched eliciting a sharp intake of breath from the detective. John’s hand dropped lower, until he could feel the fluttering stomach of his companion under his palm.
“Thank you, both. I know it was not for lack of trying. Let me go talk to him – come on, Molly, come say hello first.” When they entered the room, Sherlock was sitting up on an exam table bed, his legs hanging over the side. The bandage that had formerly been wrapped around his head was gone, and only a smaller patch covering the unsuccessful ear remained. The detective’s eyes were down, forlornly watching his feet swing back and forth. For a moment John’s chest tightened with nervousness as he rethought his decision to bring Molly. It was a difficult thing to deal with Sherlock lately.
“I have to just clean it up a bit, and reapply,” John said quietly as he turned Sherlock’s head towards the light. Yes, the skin graft on his cheek, down to his chin, and under his eye were looking good and pink, the tiny stitches by the talented plastic surgeon barely visible. His right eye was fine, just a bit swollen shut. The side of Sherlock’s nose had only been hastily done, with plans for reconstruction later. At the sight of Sherlock’s ear – or lack thereof – it took all of John to control the emotions on his face. Only remnants of some cartilage were left – apparently, when Sherlock was found on his side on the floor, his ear was swimming in a puddle of the acid. The entire ear would have to be reconstructed. So intent was John that Sherlock had to nudge him to look at his phone.
“Ah, thus the flush,” John said.
“You are an amazing man, Sherlock Holmes. You have calculated what is unfathomable. Imprisoned the evil. Saved lives. Escaped death more times than I care to count. You are my Sherlock, and I am your John, and we will make it through this, together. I promise.”
“Shit,” John sunk his head into his hands.
“I promise.”
Sherlock dropped his eyes and retreated to the bathroom, robe flowing behind him like a cape.
Sherlock grabbed his phone and texted,
“I – I should be getting back,” John stuttered. “I’ll call you…if we need anything.”
“Mm-hmm,” Sherlock walked over to John’s chair, stood beside it, and proceeded to hug John’s head to his stomach. “But lon-lee.”
“Whew, that does feel good,” he said out loud, breathlessly.
“Yes, you are!” John said to himself, rising from his chair and entering the bedroom. “And feeling better?”
“Careful, now, everything is still very tender. The nurse will set you up with a nasal flush, which you must perform regularly and gently, three times a day. There will be a bit of pain at first, but nothing your meds can’t take care of easily. Finish the antibiotics…anything else, Dr. Wadsworth?” Dr. Ballard said.
The empty bed.
Then Sherlock did something John never expected. He put down his violin and bow, marched over to him with purpose, clasped him by the hand, and led him into the bedroom. Sherlock directed John into his customary chair and the detective sat on the edge of the bed, facing him.
“Goood nihht,” the detective whispered. John turned his head to look at Sherlock. The lights from Baker Street backlit his face so John was unable to read his expression, but provided a halo-like effect through his short hair.
“I’ll tell you what I know. There was a string of murders of young women. Their bodies had been found quite disfigured…okay, you remember all that. Strange chemicals had been found at each scene, and you were in the lab at St. Bart’s one night, analyzing them. According to phone records, you called Lestrade and sent him to pick up one of the suspects for questioning, based on some result at the lab. We had narrowed it down to four men at the time, all four men at been present at various times at the same pubs where the girls had been before they had been murdered. It turned out this suspect – James Holloway – was also a night janitor at St. Bart’s. He had been stealing chemicals from the hospital for his own uses. Mr. Holloway’s wife called and told him that the police were looking for him. Turns out he was working that night at St. Bart’s and found you in the lab. Now he’s a big boy, this Holloway. Beefy, tall, strong,” John paused and took several long breathes, trying to pull himself together. Recounting this was suddenly very hard. Sherlock’s eyes softened and he came around to sit on the edge of the bed again near John.
John clasped her hand and pulled her along with him down the hallway and into the next wing. Dr. Wadsworth, and the specialist, Dr. Herry, met them outside the door. The look on their faces said it all.
But then Sherlock’s face changed. It was a look that John had seen before – a strange fear that crept into his face, when there was something of an emotional nature he was seeking to communicate. It reminded John of a fearful child, reaching out to touch something new, filled with uncertainty, but tantalized by the reward.
that our relationship is simply a
“All right, let me look at your other spots. Arm first,” John gently put his hands under Sherlock’s right elbow and raised it, determining that the small area, less then 4 centimeters long and 2 centimeters wide, was properly bandaged and could wait. John raised Sherlock’s top carefully to insure the bandages wrapped around his ribs were still in place.
“You can just nod, you know,” John grinned, but Sherlock’s head was already bent over his phone.
,” John repeated, seething. Sherlock’s brother turned to John in surprise, eyebrows raised.
He wasn’t gone but three minutes at the most when –
Sherlock nodded, his eyes straight ahead. John did not mention the fact that Sherlock had two eyes now to use to focus on the print, but instead retrieved the paper and pulled the chair up to his bedside and began to read. Twenty minutes in, John dropped the rag to his lap.
John dropped his head to his chest and chuckled, not even sure how to reply. But he was pleased that there was a bit of Sherlock spirit coming through, and that hadn’t even been home but a few hours. He thanked Mrs. Hudson and promised frequent updates, then tray in his hands, took to the stairs up to 221B.
“Mrs. Hudson, we will never be able to eat all this food – is there anything you need?”
“Mycroft! How kind of you to be here,” John said dryly. “Keep this up, and Sherlock may think you care.”
Confused, John put the tray down and walked into the kitchen, noticing for the first time how incredibly clean it was. When he opened a cabinet, it was bursting with food and supplies. The refrigerator was new – gone was the appliance that once housed Sherlock’s science experiments, and this one had fresh fruit and vegetables, juice, cream, jams, meats and cheeses.
“As much as you would like to, I can’t keep everyone away forever,” he consoled. Sherlock responded by flipping over on his side and pulling the covers up to his ear. “I’ll let you rest, then, and be back in when Dr. Wadsworth is here. And you better be nice to her,” John said, pulling the door closed behind him; but he did have the most satisfaction when he heard Sherlock’s head lift from the pillow to watch him leave.
Now John was really glad he was sitting down. He processed what Sherlock had said a thousand times in that split second to insure he was not misunderstanding his friend. Sherlock’s eyes were wide with fright, most likely mirroring the terror in John’s, but the smallest bit of a shy smile graced the man’s lips.
Sherlock nodded, eyes already closed, breaths coming slow and easy. John reluctantly slid off the bed and fussed with the covers and adjusted the IV and heart monitor lines. A nurse came by to check in, assuring John that he could stay the night in the bed in the other half of the room. As he opened his night bag in preparation, he felt the crinkle of newspaper underneath his spare clothes in the bag. Sherlock had packed it without John’s knowledge.
The two met in the middle of the room and hugged.
“You get an allowance and it will all be yours – mine. Wait, what? Sherlock!”
“It’s all right, John. I’d do the same. To take care of someone you care about…its almost a gift. To be the person they depend on, that provides comfort…I understand,” she shrugged and busied herself with paperwork on the lab bench.
“You tehl may.”
Sherlock scowled at them both, hat pulled low, a fresh bandage over the whole of his nose, his arms crossed tightly.
“Need you to roll over a bit, let me look at the hip,” John said, raising the blanket, but Sherlock vehemently pushed them back down. “Sherlock, really? If I don’t take care of you, the hospital is going to pull you right back. I know I’m not a pretty nurse, but I am a doctor. Come on, let me have a look.”
“Ooh! Well, I guess that’s a good use for it, then! Good luck, Sherlock,” she said, rising out of the chair and giving the detective a kiss on the forehead. “You be good for the doctors – especially John. Good night, boys.”
“You’ve been doing great. I know this is a hard road,” Dr. Wadsworth chimed in as she entered the room with a nurse who proceeded to push Sherlock out of the room.
“I’ll see if there’s another box of the mix…yes, yes, here’s one. Sure, I’ll make them.”
“Ey – ey fine,” Sherlock lay a hand on John’s cheek as he began to stroke. Without realizing it, his thumb touched John’s lips and the doctor turned his head and took it into his mouth and sucked. Sherlock groaned, deep and desperate, his mouth no longer able to focus on kissing, too absorbed in the sensations that were flooding his body.
And John knew the answer to his restlessness, to the unanswered questions that haunted him: the life of being just flatmates was over. They were still partners in consulting detective work, but now they were
The shower water was running for several minutes before John remembered to breath. And move. And start the scones.
Sherlock texted at that same moment. The flatmate’s shared a smile, Sherlock’s a bit lopsided. He must have felt it, because the detective raised a hand to cover his mouth, his eyes filled with alarm. John pretended not to notice.
“Oh, Sherlock, Jesus Christ, you were never a freak,” John managed to stutter, a wave of anger engulfing him. Anger at those that mocked Sherlock, and anger at Sherlock for caring what they said.
“Late? Its not even 2 pm! I know that one’s a regular night owl – never known him to sleep! These files have been sitting around for a while, waiting for you to take a look.”
“This is you now. And it does not matter if you were the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I am here now, and I will be here always.”
But money could not heal a damaged and depressed soul, and that was what John suspected Sherlock was succumbing to now. He only hoped that being back home would nurture both body and mind. John puttered around Sherlock’s room for a few minutes, setting out some medication and the bandages he would need for tomorrow. As always, his flatmate’s room was immaculate with everything in its place. John closed the window blinds and checked on Sherlock once more, who’s eyes were now closed, and left the room. It was still early afternoon and John sat at his desk and opened his laptop. He went through his emails, setting aside the ones from fans for now. He tapped his cheek with his fingers, not certain how to address the outpouring of concern and affection for Sherlock. He wanted to make sure his response was heartfelt but tactful and he was not in the proper mind frame for that at the moment. Instead, he read through the emails that may be leads on cases, imagining that when Sherlock felt better John could read them aloud to him. It would be, of course, an ego-boost for the detective to solve cases without even leaving his bed.
“What?”
“Yoo-hoo! Boys!” Mrs. Hudson called, entering with a tray of biscuits. “Welcome home!”
I really am humbled by your comments and the following this story has accumulated. I consider it one of my best works so far, and I was only improved by your comments and encouragement. Love to you all!
“Great! Now this – OOOOOOO,” John pursed his lips together as if whistling.
“Yes,” John managed, blinking back tears of relief and joy. “There is so much.”
“No, I’m afraid the ear didn’t take. They want to prep you for surgery...to remove it. And try again.”
“You will see the result today. No more hiding. It’s going to be all right,” John repeated.
The detective squeezed his eyes shut and fiercely shook his head, a silent plea for John not to argue.
“Yes, it’s you,” John said, his voice trembling with emotion.
“You want me to shave your head? Sherlock, why?”
The kettle hissed and the doorbell rang at the same time, startling John out of his thoughts. The visitor was Molly, bringing a piece of equipment from the hospital that John had been expecting. He poured her a cup of tea and they sat, John in his chair, Molly sitting awkwardly at the edge of Sherlock’s.
“Promise?”
“Hello, John!”
The light in the room was low, monitors beeping softly, nurses padding around on quiet feet. The room seemed…reverent. And there, lying there on the hospital bed among wires and oxygen lines, was Sherlock. The detective was sitting up for proper drainage due to the sight of the operation, assuring an open and clear airway through his mouth, as his nose was covered with a large tent of white gauze. John gently took up the detective’s hand in his, brow furrowed as he visually inspected the patient. Sherlock was pale, his pink lips outstanding against his pallid skin, lips parted slightly to breath. John ducked in quickly and placed a kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
John reasoned
“Kay,” Sherlock mumbled, pulling John into the bed, long arms encompassing him. They spooned, John tucked up under Sherlock’s chin and his back to the detective’s chest. “But not sleehpy now.”
“In the
He put on the kettle instead and went out to the living room, pressing his forehead against the window overlooking Baker Street, seeing but not seeing the pedestrians, the taxis….
John assembled the tea and started a fire, finally resting in his chair, happy to be easing back into the feel of 221B.
John poked at the fire, trying to pin down just what he was feeling right now. He felt that thought bubbles, indicative of those three undulating dots when he knew he was receiving a text, were floating about his head. He kept waiting for the message to come through.
“No,” came the muffled sob from inside Sherlock’s hands. “Can-t-alk.”
“He’s already aware of his brother’s progress. Here, my card. Please let me know if you need anything, at any time.”
“But…,” John began, but his voice trailed off. “Does it matter to you? I don’t want you making decisions on how I feel. You have to make sure that this is what you want.”
John placed his hands over Sherlock’s, threading their fingers together.
Sherlock growled and punched the bed in frustration. John realized his mistake. He needed to just let the poor man talk. The fear and vexation present in the detective were a hot hurricane of feelings that Sherlock would not normally be able to express – but now, with his injuries and John’s impatience, it was infinitely more impossible.
The detective replied with a growl and continued to rosen his bow.
“Yes?”
Sherlock merely nodded once.
It was as if time had stopped for John. There was only this moment, this room, this man, this feeling in his heart - of hope and confusion.
“There,” he said, surprised at the thoughts running through his head. “That should feel a lot better.”
“Just mur of a freek.”
“Good morning! A good night of sleep, I presume?”
“Sherlock! Go to sleep!”
“Yes, new nose. Rest now, okay?”
The detective continued to gaze right ahead. John continued anyway.
He had always been a light sleeper and being over in Afghanistan had only instilled that in him deeper. Being a doctor in an active war area had trained him to sleep between waves of patients –a type of sleep that allowed him rest but with the ability to be roused and on point almost immediately. This had also served him well in working and living with a consulting detective, of course. So on this particular night, now that Sherlock was healthy and John was not exhausted, he resumed his normal pattern of being a light sleeper.
Sherlock gave a weak ‘thumbs up’ in response and John brought him a glass of water. John sat on the edge of the bed and directed the straw to Sherlock’s mouth. His eyes sought Sherlock’s, but they were downcast, intent on the glass in John’s hand.  John instead took the moment to quickly examine Sherlock’s bandages, and determined that tomorrow, they would need to be changed.
“Christ!”
“I’ve got to remove this, yeah,” John said more to himself. He assembled the needed bandages and tape put gloves on, noting that Sherlock lay, unmoving, a forlorn figure that seemed to melt into the mattress. A ghost of a man. “You’re going to be fine, Sherlock,” John said, pulling off the dressing. “Just a little bump in the road, but nothing old Dr. Watson hasn’t seen before.” He kept up his one-sided conversation, filling Sherlock in on the bounty of food in the kitchen, but avoiding mention of the new refrigerator (John shuddered just a bit to think what was in the old one). The wound was infected, staring accusingly up at John like an angry red eye. He cleaned and redressed it and helped Sherlock roll onto his back again. There were high red spots on Sherlock’s pale cheeks and his eyes glittered with fever. The patient pushed John away impatiently when he tried to adjust the pillows and blankets.
“Now, John. With me.”
Sherlock responded by crossing his arms, no easy task in the small hospital wheelchair he was sitting in and pouted. The thin hospital gown slid off his shoulder and it took all of John’s self-discipline not to reach over and fix it. The waves of anger rolling off Sherlock were as visible as Mojave heat.
“Gud at both.” Sherlock’s hand slid down and into the tangle of John’s fingers, and John rubbed the knuckles of that beautiful hand with the pad of his thumb. The doctor found his head suddenly light and he was grateful to be sitting down.
“But there’s much more we -,”
“Sherlock has done a lot for this city. It’s our pleasure,” Dr. Ballard replied.
“Yes, it is me,” John smiled at him.
Was that all Sherlock wanted? John to be his ‘good man’ – not his lover? John had been
“A please and a thank you in one day,” he mused.
“Want out of these pants? I’ll get your pajamas.” With some maneuvering under the covers, Sherlock worked off the hospital pants and into his own dark blue, silken pants, gritting his teeth against the grinding of his broken ribs. Without a word, John helped his pull off the equally uncomfortable hospital top and slid Sherlock into the matching silken top. Sherlock’s thin chest rose and fell with deep, tired breathes as John buttoned it up. The clothes had a faint scent of that something familiar that was previously missing, and John’s heart quickened when he caught a waif of it.
“I need a drink,” John responded, collapsing in a chair. It was the third day in the hospital following the surgery to attach one of the laboratory-grown ears. There had originally been five ears ‘grown’ for Sherlock in Petri dishes, but two of them had not succeeded. One had been attached three days ago but was not faring well. Even though an experienced surgeon had been brought in specializing in such procedures, there had been complications.
“No but thank you. I think we are good. Will you be letting Mycroft know -?”
At the door, he paused.
John walked the doctors and nurse out, and at the door, shook their hands. “Thank you so much. I know its certainly not conventional to make house calls. We very much appreciate it.”
The nurses also filed out, and John released a large breath. Finally, they were alone.
“To be honest, Molly, he’s being a bit more of a recluse than usual. Let him get healed up a bit more and we’ll see, yeah?” This was part truth, but the fact of the matter having someone intrude on their quiet little life, where John was in charge, was disconcerting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“eeeeee,”the detective finally relented.
“Wihl yooo red?”
John instantly understood what Sherlock was trying to say: there was so much to say, so much fear, so much risk, so much to be afraid of –
“How?”
The side of Sherlock’s head where the hair had been slowly regrowing caught John’s attention. Portions of the new hair were long enough to be brushed back, and as John raked his fingernails down Sherlock’s scalp, he could see that portions of the new hair were a different color. Some of it was white. Sherlock put his hand over John’s, alarm on his face.
And then he felt his mouth open and he was talking and it was all very benign, as if he was addressing one of his patients in his military days, providing a front and saying all the right things, as untruthful as they could be. Being the reassuring doctor, voicing the words without feeling, turning the subject to something more cheerful, and finally sending Mrs. Hudson on her way with a kiss on the cheek and a promise to visit again very, very soon.
John lay gentle fingers on Sherlock’s check to ensure the flush was not indicative of a fever, but the detective’s skin was cool and dry. Sherlock licked his lips sleepily at his touch, drowsy eyes opening slightly.
Once the detective stretched out long on the bed, John did allow himself to adjust a pillow - just slightly. Sherlock’s one visible eye was a small fire that watched John, deep and dark in the shadows of his face. He was exhausted already, and his sallow cheeks were pocked with bright red splotches of fever.
The hair over Sherlock’s damaged ear was beginning to get long enough to cover the ear to some extent. As John had noticed earlier, some of the damaged follicles were producing white hair, which lazed into coarse curls, much different from the silken curls on the rest of Sherlock’s head. John had to admit it gave the detective a sophisticated air – a strangely deformed ear hiding beneath curls with streaks of white.
“Of course. Thank you.”
“I think you could use a bit of a wash up,” John continued, his voice low. “You still have a fever, low grade, but persistent. If you can eat a bit of something today, I can up your dose of antibiotics. You’re good and hydrated though, that’s good. Here, head bandages first. Come on, now, the ones around your eye can come off, you won’t be looking like the Phantom of the Opera any more. Yes, very good. Looking very, very good, Sherlock. See? Even a bit of hair coming back over your ear, just like I told you. No, keep your hands down, I don’t want you to go and touch it just yet. Good, I won’t bandage that back up just yet. Alright, arms up, let me take this top off, we will change you into a fresh one. Ribs still bandaged up, we’ll keep it like they are. Pretty bruises there, for sure. Now, elbow is looking good, that can come off and stay off. All right, over on your side, this hip is causing quite a bit of trouble.”
John’s chest heaved with emotion and he knew he was exhausting heavy, hot breathes on poor Mycroft’s face, but he did not care. John’s finger was deeply embedded in the elder Holmes’ vest, and he realized he had been accentuating pronouns with jabs of it. Mycroft’s face sagged, and he dropped his gaze.
John paused for a moment, listening. He heard a huffing sound, a rustling of covers, a muffled wail from Sherlock’s room. He tiptoed to the closed door. It was only when he heard the crash of something falling to the floor that he intruded on Sherlock’s privacy.
Even now, looking at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye while pretending to read the paper, John knew he would be fine. He would recover, he would heal. He would show them all.
, these were the appendages that formed thought pyramids in front of pouting lips, these were the tools that held a gun or a knife, the dexterous formations that lifted a teacup, focused a microscope, typed a text, fisted in anger, touched a lover –
“The ear…,” Dr. Wadsworth shook her head. “It's showing signs of rejection. The blood flow just could never be properly initiated. We haven’t told him yet.”
“Now most of this we won’t need, but just in case,” he said. He hesitated on the cot, then finally pushed it against the wall of the bedroom. “Yeah, just in case. Right, you want the tele in here?”
Sherlock’s face was twisted with emotion – rage, surprise, helplessness. Hands on his head, he spun around, and paced the room. John stood, letting the detective work it out, feeling his own heart pound loudly in his chest.
Where John was expressing surprise and regret, Sherlock took it as an affront. The detective stood up abruptly and stormed over to his dresser and pulled out his pajamas, his back to John. Waves of anger flowed from him. John mentally kicked himself – hard.
“Yes. It will be fine,” John said more to Sherlock, who looked up at the words.
“Sh, sh,” John soothed. “It’s all right. It’s all fine. Relax.” John felt the sweat-dampened curls nod against his cheek. “This is supposed to be enjoyable. You liked that, didn’t you?” Another nod. “Come here, let me see you.” John pulled back and his eyes found Sherlock’s. The deep furrow between his eyes gone, but his eyes still held – John bit his lip at the thought – distrust?
Sherlock is four and they all think he's shy. Parents coo at him as he stands by Mummy's side and some of them kneel down and put their face too close. Sherlock always recoils, because he hates it. It makes their eyes too close and Sherlock can see too many different colours and lines and it makes his head go fuzzy because he doesn't know where to look. Sherlock doesn't like eyes, he doesn't like his own eyes' ether because they are blue and green and sometimes yellow.
Sherlock doesn't speak, doesn't know what to say, but John hears him anyway, John always hears him.
Sherlock likes it that way, wants it that way, nobody smiles at him and asks to see the man behind the blank facade. That's fine though, that's perfect, Sherlock wants it that way.
Now John raised his eyes from his laptop to look as Sherlock trudged into the living room and sat down in his seat across from his flat mate. He had taken the bandage off from across his nose, revealing the thickly scabbed and misshapen feature. Between that, the hat pulled down low across his eyes, and the bandage still over his ear, John thought he looked like a bit of an awkward teenager dressed up like a street thug.
“Ey fine.”
“Hmph.”
Reluctantly he let his hand drop, then moved over to the IV to increase the flow of much needed hydration. John’s mind, now in doctor mode, created a mental checklist, determining what medication would be needed and how he would obtain it without the knowledge of Dr. Wadsworth.
, Mycroft Holmes, then it is not your brother that is being the immature little boy. You stay away from
- in life, in work, in love. The part of John that had been looking into down the precipice, wondering how to get to the other side, was gone. The bridge was there, and he had crossed it to be with Sherlock, who had been waiting patiently on the other side.
Sherlock is thirty-five and thinks he's starting to love too much, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly, Mycroft... John. He loves them all too much, but it's not enough, because he courts death with the strangled breath in his lungs and the blood in in his ears and the tears like poison. Everybody knows Sherlock Holmes, but only John and Mycroft know Sherlock.
"Is that so? Then please, dear brother, prove me wrong."
Sherlock is thirteen and has a crush on Amy Falls. She has brown hair that she cuts regularly with natural blond highlights that reach her breast.
Sherlock is thirty-nine and John looks like some sort of an Angel, with a street light glowing above John's head like a halo and the light twitching off his blond hair.
There's a stain on her dress, chocolate, maybe. Her nails have yellow stains, from nicotine, like his Fathers. Mummy doesn't know that Father is still smoking, but Sherlock does.
This still doesn't bother Sherlock, because Mycroft is still easy, he's predictable, and so is John.
"Why would I be lonely Mummy?" He asks, and this just seems to bother Mummy more.
Sherlock is sixteen and is told Father is dead.
Her red hair is sticking to her forehead and there is damp patches under her arms.
He puts pressure on the wound, because he doesn't want Roger to die. The light in Rogers eyes' is fading and he's stuck on repeat, like the record his Father used to have. He keeps saying he's sorry and Sherlock isn't sure if he should believe him.
Sherlock doesn't know the rules still, but that's okay, because they can make them up as they go along.
Roger had him pinned against a wall in the kitchen, and Sherlock felt like he was sinking. His whole body felt too heavy, and everything looked too dim. Sherlock had reached out to exactly where he knew the knives where, he would admit that, and stabbed Roger in the side, between his second and third rib, at least two inches deep.
He tells Mycroft the truth, because it's his only chance of getting free.
Sherlock cleared his throat expectantly and John patted Greg on the shoulder and turned him toward the door. “We’ll take a look at them tomorrow,” John repeated.
“Oh, hello Dr. Wadsworth. Please, call me John. Yes, of course you may come visit.”
John pulled Sherlock’s bottoms down over his hip and buttocks and peeled of the bandages there. He was disappointed to see no change in the condition of the wound. He pulled a sponge out of the bucket of warm water and squeezed it until it was nearly dry. He placed one hand on Sherlock’s rib cage to steady him, and carefully washed around the wound, removing the dried seepage on Sherlock’s skin. Goosebumps darted across Sherlock’s leg and back, his body as tense as a board. John rinsed out the sponge and dried the area with a towel.
John reaches out for help, and Sherlock reaches out for John.
“Am sowry,” Sherlock’s hand squeezed John’s arm.
John had been sleeping on his back and when he awoke, raised his head cautiously to investigate the weight on his forearm. His eyes traveled down his arm, to Sherlock’s hand, to Sherlock’s arm that had bridged the gap between the two beds, to Sherlock’s resting, unfevered face.
“Ey git allooowence end et will be yooors.”
“Do I make myself perfectly clear?” John insisted.
“Surely, Dr. Watson, you don’t think that Sherlock – well, in this moment you are simply another experiment to him -,”
“Yes, a totally successful procedure. That was over two weeks ago...the scars are beginning to fade, and he’s sleeping much better at night.” John felt a slight blush rise into his cheeks at this statement. Since that afternoon in Sherlock’s bedroom, the two of them had been inseparable. Together every night, holding each other close, as if afraid to let go. This latest stay at St. Bart’s had completely disorientated Sherlock. He had been completely miserable without John at his side at every moment. For John, it had been exhausting to be the supportive, understanding presence that he knew the detective needed.
John convinced himself that he was relieved. The other side of that bridge had held something tantalizing…but not realistic. He knew that now. There was no bridge. Just the gaping chasm between the two men.
The waiting room was a large lounge area with one whole wall of windows overlooking the parking lot and blue-gray tired furniture. An offering tray of sandwiches and bottled waters sat on one of the tables. John attempted to watch the tele, but ended up shutting it off after a few minutes, annoyed by the talking heads of the news shows and the canned laughter of the sit-coms. Instead, feeling a restlessness, he pushed back the furniture and dancing on his toes, boxed at the air until sweat beaded his brow.
“Good night. And you’ll be fine tomorrow. Please don’t worry.”
“Now, I need you to roll on your side, I’ve got to check that hip.” John lifted the covers, feeling the heat that was released from beneath them. Sherlock floundered to move, so John placed a hand on the man’s shoulder and the back of his thigh to assist him. When he pulled the pajama bottoms down over the hip, he found that sure enough, the bandages on the detective’s hip were soaked with drainage.
“Well, someone realized they were starting to disappear at a more rapid rate than usual. Of course, everyone blamed the supply Sargent, but he had a peanut allergy and didn’t go near the bars. He had the only key to the supplies, and the men decided he should relinquish it to me. Voted most trustworthy, I guess. But I’ll finish this some other time. Big day tomorrow.”
“Ah, thirsty?”
“Am done, with ahh theese,” Sherlock waved his hands around the room.
“I keep tehling yu, it’s Sherlock,” came the muffled reply from the crook of John’s neck. His hand pulled out from John’s pants for a moment, just long enough to push the jeans down over John’s hips. John moaned, relishing the feeling of having his legs locked into the jeans bunched around his knees, of Sherlock’s weight on him, imprisoning him.
The text had an attachment of a human ear in a petri dish.
Finally, the patient collapsed against his pillows, exhausted, his one exposed eye sunken deep. John gathered the bandages, glancing at his phone when it buzzed.
“The rest?”
“Oh, you won’t,” John replied, taking a moment to catch Sherlock’s eye and nod reassuringly as he warmed the stethoscope between his palms. “I’ve got you. Here, let me listen.” He released the two top buttons of Sherlock’s pajama shirt, placing the instrument against the firm pectoral of the patient’s chest. John perhaps took too long to listen, letting his hand linger on the pale flesh, his eyes demurely studying exposed almond-brown nipples. He could count on one hand the number of times he had seen his flatmate shirtless, most of them occurred when Sherlock had a thought in the shower and he would fly out of the bathroom, one hand gripping a loose towel around his waist, the other gesticulating. John had always wondered how the detective was able to maintain a near-perfect, chiseled physic by barely eating and a lack of fitness program.
“Look at me, Sherlock,” John whispered. After a long moment, Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered and his eyes opened, locking eyes with John. The sunlight slanted through the window, finding his eyes again, turning them hazel, then gray, then green, full of wonder and wide as a doe’s. But there was still fear, fear like John had never seen in the man before. The fear of emotional exposure, of dropping down every last shield, of being a true person. One that could love, but that could also be hurt.
John laughed, happy to break the uneasy feeling that lingered in the room.
– it hurt to eat. John had just assumed he was not eating because it was Sherlock and the man never ate. It had taken hours for the detective to – in a very roundabout way – ask John to read the paper. How in the hell was Sherlock going to ask for help eating – “John, could you make me a smoothie, please?”
“Big day,” John sympathized, pulling up his chair and unfolding the newspaper he had brought in. “Here’s tea – with brandy, lots of brandy - and I brought the paper. Now here’s a good story…”
“Well, thank God for that.”
John rose to his feet, aware of the fury that was fueling his thumping heart.
“All right?” John asked, and Sherlock nodded under John’s hand. They were close now, their faces just inches apart, in the same bed, under the same covers. But the seeds of doubt had been planted too deeply in John’s mind:
The detective stood up and gave a nod, color suddenly flushing his cheeks. He pulled his purple dressing gown around his trim figure awkwardly, suddenly avoiding eye contact with his flatmate.
After a few days at the hospital, John had decided the best care would be the only kind he himself could give Sherlock, in the quiet privacy of their flat. Sherlock had detested the hospital, eating nothing, dry heaving on the meds, swinging his wounded appendage at the doctors and glaring, one-eyed through his bandages, frightening the nurses. Even then he barely spoke a word, lips hard pressed in a thin line, head turned away. Sherlock did fill John with relief when he granted John a quick nod at the suggestion of going home. They had to sneak out the back of the hospital into a waiting ambulance to avoid the vultures of the press, eager to be the first to snap a picture of the detective’s disfiguring injuries. The orderlies were not the gentlest, ratcheting Sherlock’s cot up the stairs into 221B brusquely. John looked on in dismay as Sherlock shut his eyes and his face drained of any remaining color at the pain. When they finally got him into his bedroom, John was the one insisting on clasping Sherlock under the arms and moving him gently onto his own bed. The former military man had always been a strong man and had lifted Sherlock in the past, but the feel of Sherlock’s fragile, skeletal frame shocked him. John vowed to heal and fatten the man up.
“Yes, of course,” John answered, hoping his face did not reveal this blow. Sherlock cannot eat because to chew would hurt his face BLOODY HELL I AM THE WORST DOCTOR EVER.
Sherlock accepted the pills into the palm of his hand and unceremoniously flicked the pain med across the room with a look of defiance at his doctor. John put his hands up in surrender and retrieved the paper.
“This is all mine. Yes, I understand.”
“Well, shit,” John whispered as he hit SEND. To his surprise, Dr. Wadsworth’s reply came in a few minutes later as he was lost in thought, staring at the screen.
“Let me tell you about brother mine, John. The man has escaped death more times than I care to count. In the time you have known him, you have certainly seen that. That kind of luck can lead a person to think they are a bit…illustrious. Now of course my heart would break if anything happened to him, so I have always done what I could, in the ways that I could, to make sure that he survived any kind of deathly scenario as well. In my small way, I have contributed to his sense of…immortality.”
In the dark, Sherlock turned on his side to face John.
John shook his head, wondering why he was calling it that. It was more like a mistake, an ego-driven error on the behest of the detective, going up against a 125-kilo 2-meter tall adrenaline- and heroine- driven criminal who flung the lithe Sherlock across Molly’s lab tables at the hospital. The result? Four broken ribs, chemical burns on his right arm, hip, and…the right side of his face. The acid in the beaker that monster had ground into the side of Sherlock’s face had literally melted the man’s right ear, burned off his hair, and eaten away at his cheek, the side of his nose, and the skin surrounding his eye.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
“Whaaat well I luk like?” Sherlock whispered, his doubt-filled eyes intent on their still-clasped hands.
Sherlock is thirty and has been clean for a year now. Both Lestrade and Mycroft congratulates him and Sherlock doesn't understand why being clean from drugs deserve an award. Shouldn't that mean that everybody who never takes drugs should be congratulated on being clean each year? Lestrade laughs until he realizes he's serious.
The emergency services turns up and Sherlock is arrested.
Sherlock wonders why John took him back so quickly, and John says, "I trust you." Sherlock wonders why.
They both started arguing, and Sherlock even admits that he probably could have prevented it if he kept his mouth shut.
He already knows this though. He doesn't need Mycroft to tell him, but he always likes to hear it. Mycroft is sixteen now, and doing his GCSE's in school. Sherlock knows he's smart, because sometimes Sherlock does Mycrofts' maths homework when he isn't looking. This makes Mycroft cross though, but Sherlock can't help it.
He normally does it when they call him names at school, or he has to go in the gym where the lights are really bright or during lunch when everybody is yelling and screaming. When Mycrofts ask, Sherlock tells him he blacken his own eye for an experiment. Sherlock is starting to learn that sometimes he can lie if it makes things easier, but he doesn't know why he's still told he shouldn't.
There is water on Mummy's cheeks, and Sherlock doesn't understand yet that she's crying. He can see where her make-up has been smudged and reapplied again. Her lips are painted pink with the NARS lip gloss that Father brought her and her lashes are pale for once. Mummy is wearing flat saddles, and Sherlock can see that her second toe is bigger than the others and he can tell she reapplied her nail varnish too. It's too thick at the ends where Mummy made a mistake and had to dab it with a cloth.
And indeed he did. John numbed the area with a local anesthetic, drained, flushed, and rebandaged the area. Both men were sweating and shaking at the end, but John carried on, providing Sherlock with a cooling sponge bath, fresh sheets again, and a broth dinner with a side of more scones. It was Sherlock that directed John, with his fevered, sunken eyes, to pull the cot over and sleep there that night.
“Okay – like this – EEEEEEEE.” John stretched his lips wide across his face, jaw clenched and teeth bared. “Come on, now, Sherlock – EEEEEEEEE.”
“I know it’s hard to talk. Listen, I chatted with the speech therapist. She showed me what to do. Some exercises to start with.”
“Well of course you are,” John returned, snapping his laptop shut. Sherlock glared at him.
But where?
when he found them. Downstairs again, he found the bedroom dark and Sherlock already beneath the covers.
“You promised!”
“Jawn,” Sherlock dropped his head into John’s neck, body quaking. They stood, locked together, for a long moment. John could have stood that way forever, holding this man, breathing him in, comforting him, but from what? Why was Sherlock so afraid? They had been flirting for a month, was the genius having second thoughts? Then John felt Sherlock’s whispered words against his skin, the detective’s face still tucked in against his neck, like a child hiding from a monster.
“Here, let’s get that coat off. And the hat. It’s been a long day and you don’t have all your strength back yet.”
Where John once thought a bridge had been crossed, feelings expressed, fear breached that night when Sherlock had lain his cheek in John’s hand – no, he had been wrong. Obviously. John was just a good man.
“….and?” John prompted.
“Good luck to you both, and good night.”
“Tell you? What is there to tell except this horrible piss-poor excuse for a human took the same chemicals used to melt the flesh off hides of animals and used them on your face.” The words spilled out so fast that John was not sure if Sherlock’s silence was shock or lack of understanding of what John had said.
“Red?”
John had kissed men before, and he was certain that Sherlock had, too. But to John, this man had the softest lips, the most sensuous tongue, the damn most sexy fingers that John had ever experienced, man or woman. And those fingers were creeping around to the front of John’s jeans and applying pressure to his increasing erection.
An ear in a petri dish? Its actually real: https://ideas.ted.com/a-promising-way-to-grow-body-parts-using-an-apple/
“No – your cheek and nose look very good. The skin grafts are taking quite nicely.”
“Doctuurs,” was the droll reply. Sherlock’s enunciation of sound had improved since the surgery two weeks ago – John was a drill sergeant with the speech therapy drills - but his packed nose made him sound chronically congested.
“Getting tere,” he replied.
Molly looked at him with sympathy, long ponytail resting on one shoulder. “You need some rest. Would you like me to come over for a day and help?”
“You’re fine.”
“Oh, that is so kind, thank you,” John said, taking the tray from her. “Could I impose on you for some biscuits? I haven’t had a chance to go to the store yet.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand as the doctor turned to head into the kitchen, and John looked at him in surprise. Mischief alighted the detective’s eyes.
And....I may be persuaded to start writing an epilogue, if there is any interest....
“Here, you’ll lose all sorts of heat if you don’t wear this,” John said, pulling it on Sherlock’s head. John put it down too low over Sherlock’s eyes, and they both adjusted it at the same time, hands touching. Sherlock’s fingers ran down the length of John’s hand, so slowly, John watching as if frozen in time and space.
“Hmph,” Sherlock replied, lounging in his chair across from John. Both men had their laptops perched on their laps, but John snapped his closed.
Sherlock went to his bedroom and slammed the door shut. John stared at the ceiling and tried to gather his feelings. His patient required a mix of discipline and compassion that was getting difficult to muster. John was tired, emotionally and physically. If he let himself, he would go upstairs to his room and bury his head in his pillow and cry and scream. But being the good soldier, he bit his bottom lip, gathered his energy, and knocked on Sherlock’s door.
John slid out from under the covers and padded into the living room, where Sherlock, fully dressed, was standing by the window, hands tucked into his pockets, overlooking Baker Street. He turned to John and smiled his lopsided, very endearing smile.
"Ey don't care." Sherlock shrugged. “Theese is me now,” Sherlock placed a hand on either side of John’s face, long fingers on his cheeks, pulling him close, forcing him to lock eyes, seeking answers to unasked questions:
“Jawn. Theer es sooo much,” Sherlock gasped, through clenched teeth.
John’s head fell back on the pillow and he bit his lower lip to suppress a moan. He felt blood rush to his cock, and not because it was a normal morning occurrence, but because he was attempting to lock in the feel of the detective’s fingers on his arm and the light, cool feel of the five lines of Sherlock’s skin on his skin was a complete and total aphrodisiac. John lay there some, eyes clenched tight, memorizing that place, that time, until he slid his arm out from under that hand and Sherlock reclaimed it without waking, in fact, the detective took that hand and slid it under his own cheek, lush lips smacking in sleep. John turned on his side away from the detective and clasped his cock in his hand, squeezing and pulling until he came, biting down on his blanket to silent his moans, hoping the creak of the cot was not as loud as he imagined it.
Back in the bedroom, Sherlock sat sullenly in the upholstered chair beside the bed while John stripped it and put on clean sheets.
“Ey don’t ever want to leah theese place,” Sherlock said, his eyes roaming from Billy the skull, to the bookcases, and finally resting on John. “Ey wees homesick.”
“I’m afraid you are going to be stuck with me,” John replied, his hands on his hips. “I’m your John, and you’re my Sherlock.”
“Gud,” Sherlock affirmed.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock,” John cried as Sherlock began to jerk him off, each grinding motion against John’s backside pushing John into Sherlock’s fist. John clenched his buttocks, squeezing the detective’s cock with each thrust, eliciting an outcry of pleasure from his partner. It was a rhythm that quickly increased, until John’s body screamed for release, on the edge, but holding on, an unspoken promise, until Sherlock’s voice was in John’s ear again, like a mooring for John to hold onto against the desperate moans that were pouring from his mouth, from his body pounded like a boat in a storm,
? You are not damaged, Sherlock Holmes. You are perfect,” the words came out of John before he could stop them. “You are the most amazing, arrogant, headstrong, handsome, brilliant person I will ever know. Minus a nose, an ear, an arm, you are still the same.”
“I know you, Jawn.”
“I liiick eet,” he said proudly.
Sherlock studied John, his face unreadable.
“Up now,” John said, sitting on the edge of the bed and pulling Sherlock into a sitting position. The detective seemed to be in a semi-conscious state, his head flopping forward, chin on his chest. “Easy there,” John said, realizing that Sherlock would not sit up under his own power, but rather, the detective slumped against John, his head laying on the doctor’s shoulder, small puffs of sweet breath against John’s neck. For a moment John sat, motionless, unsure of what to do. Then his hand came up and covered the back of Sherlock’s neck, absorbing the feel of the skin, the tendons, the muscles there in that long, angular, infamous neck. John turned his head a bit to the side, so his cheek just barely lay against Sherlock’s. Skin against skin. It was John who then shivered.
They had ended up staying three days at the hospital since once again, Sherlock had fallen into the pattern of not eating and getting sick from the strong medication. Although John had insisted that once Sherlock was home he would drastically improve, but the insolent plastic surgeon, Dr. Ballard, did not listen. When Dr. Wadsworth had found out about the situation, she intervened and sent them home, but not before Dr. Ballard had given John tutorials on how to change the bandages and moisturize the sutures.
Another quick nod, and John, sensing an end to the conversation, picked up the paper and began to read again.
And there it was. The testament, the truth. Sherlock did want this. A sob escaped John’s lips as air gushed back into his lungs.
“Christ,” John lamented as he pulled out his phone and shot an annoyed look at Sherlock. “No rest for the weary.”
Sherlock turned his head so his lips brushed the doctor’s palm.
“We are going to be removing the bandages and assessing the ear. If there are any signs of rejection or infection, unfortunately, we are going to be taking the next steps to remove it.”
Sherlock huffed a ‘yes’, his breath hot against the back of John’s neck.
John’s head fell back on the pillow, then raised again to look at the hand on his arm. Four long, elegant fingers draped over the doctor’s bare, muscular forearm, the thumb resting alongside. John studied them until his neck screamed for mercy. Perfect crescent pale pink nail beds set in fingers – fingers, these were not
, John thought.
“Dum.”
“Dam- dam-,” he struggled with the enunciation, then angrily grabbed his phone, typing then putting it to John’s face to see.
John closed his eyes and smiled, relishing the feel of his flatmate’s warm, silken pajamas against his cheek.
“Yes, tired. Sleep, darling,” John lay a soft hand on Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock’s hand upon his arm.
“You’re all good, you are just waking up. Easy now,” John whispered, smiling through tears, as he pushed a stray hair off his forehead. John relinquished the detective’s hand to a nurse for a pulse and stood out of the way, watching as Sherlock drifted in and out of consciousness, slowly sleeping off the medicine, and experiencing a joy like no other as the detective’s eyes – as surrounded by bruises as they were - would close and then reopen long moments later with a light in them, a light of bliss upon seeing John still there.
“But I’m dumang-ed.”
“All set!” John said aloud as he hit SEND.
A persistent fever haunts the patient.
John placed a hand on her knee. “Of course he does. You know, it’s just Sherlock.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Everything….is going to be all right,” John whispered slowly. Sherlock gave a gentle sigh, the wisps of his breath caressing John’s cheek like a warm, summer wind.
Sherlock hissed and shook his head vehemently.
“All right, all right. Here we go.” After standing the IV stand up again and confirming the needles were still in place in Sherlock's arm, John sat on the edge of the bed and let his now gloved fingers skate over the bandages, determining the best place to start removing them. Now Sherlock’s eye was intent on John, absorbing and studying. John bit his lower lip in concentration as he cut away the tape and absorbent padding, layer after layer, until Sherlock audibly sighed with relief as the last of it was removed.
“Come on, lips like this – EEEEEEE.”
John clenched his eyes shut.
John narrowly dodged a pillow to the face.
“That easy, eh? At least you’re not out of practice.”
His patient turned his head away and flicked the long fingers of one hand in dismissal.
A sob escaped John. “I don’t want to lose you. I feel like – I feel like I just
“Jawn. Theere es so much,” Sherlock whispered.
“I miss you both very much,” she said, the look on her face showing she was a bit surprised at her own words. “I mean, I don’t see you in the lab at all any more. Do you think Sherlock will get back to his work, sometime?”
It was not his touch that was good. Not the feel of his flesh on Sherlock. Not the affection and out right love – yes, that word,
“Ef I toomaurrooo, thees ees awl yooors,” Sherlock said, gesturing to the room and the flat beyond. His eyes beseeched John to implore him to understand.
“Was dreeming,” Sherlock said. “Of yoo.”
John moved so swiftly Mycroft startled to see the doctor suddenly standing directly in front of him. Had one asked Mycroft later if they stood eye to eye, he would have said yes, though that was physically impossible due to their difference in heights. But John had in that instance, in that moment, become so much larger than himself, Mycroft was certain the man had grown a good six inches.
John shook his head, breaking his mournful gaze at his cell phone. It would be just him and Sherlock now, and for a while. The man’s injuries would take months to completely heal. The ring of the doorbell made him start, and he opened the door to a delivery man holding flowers.
“Tea?” John offered.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock murmured as he crawled up over John, his fingers creeping up under his shirt and his lips on John’s neck. The doctor shivered but otherwise did not move, letting the detective explore him piece by piece, long fingers unbuttoning his shirt, touching his chest and neck and shoulders and arms. His eyes were now cat-like, cataloguing, assessing, and yes, enjoying. Bare chest to bare chest now as Sherlock brought a knee between John’s legs and pushed against the modest erection, quickly reviving it.
After a moment, John reluctantly pulled away.
When the doctors finally finished and gave John the go ahead, he paused for a moment with his hand on the door. He knew he had to mentally steel himself. He had seen plenty of war injuries, it was not the blood or gore that he was worried about – it was seeing Sherlock, hurting, that was going to get to John the most. He gave himself a nod and proceeded to push the door open.
“Another scone – no? That’s all fine. Here’s water and your antibiotics,” he managed. “I’ll clean up and be right back.”
“I swear, you two are like an old married couple,” Mrs. Hudson remarked one day when she came up to visit. She was the only one Sherlock would not retreat from besides John, but he still would not utter a word in her presence. Instead, glares and huffs were his form of communication, which he expressed at that remark. “Well, it’s true! I haven’t seen the take away delivery man here for quite some time. John, all those groceries that get delivered are going to good use. I can tell.”
“Beautiful, Sherlock,” John applauded when the detective finished and turned around to face his doctor. “One of your own, I can tell.”
“You two used to be in and out, chasing people, explosions, clients -,” her hands flailed. “I don’t know if you will ever get Sherlock to come out of his, well…depression.”
“Let’s just think about it, yeah? Right now let me just cover up that ear, and a bit across your nose. That’s going to a lot less than what it was. Much better.” While John bandaged those two areas, he had to lean in close to Sherlock, gently laying sterile padding across the affected areas, his fingers tapping white tape into place. The whole time his patient’s eyes were locked on him, studying John. Observing. It wasn’t uncomfortable for the doctor, but he was unable to recall the last time the two of them had been this close with Sherlock coherent. John finished bandaging the ear, and without thought, touched the back of his fingers against Sherlock’s cheek. For a moment Sherlock’s eyes dropped and it seemed that Sherlock turned his head into John’s touch, but then it was gone, and John’s chest compressed like a metal band was squeezing around it.
“I really need Sherlock’s help with a case,” came the plea.
“Same old Sherlock,” John sighed. “But getting better, stronger, every day.”
“We are down to just one more chance. One of the two remaining ears…is no longer viable.”
“This IS one exercise – they go together like this – EEEEEEEE OOOOOOO. See?”
“You need a rest,” Dr. Wadsworth offered.
“You mean, just fix it, and leave it?”
“Thank you, Molly. We will see you soon,” John said. When the door closed softly behind her, Sherlock’s eyes moved to John.
“Delivery for Sherlock Holmes,” the man said from behind the bouquet of at least three dozen colorful roses.
Sherlock shot him a glance that made the doctor laugh out loud.
“And John, should there be anything you need…be sure and let me know,” Mycroft’s tone softened for just an instant, and giving a mock bow to the flatmates, he departed the apartment. John quickly locked the door behind him, and both men gave out the large breaths they had been holding.
“Don’t stop,” John encouraged. “I love your hands…and your fingers. Wrap them around me, yes, God yes, just like that – Sherlock, you are perfect, you are perfect. Just a little faster, mmpph.” The doctor’s hands slid under his companion’s pajama bottoms and grasped his buttocks, gripping and releasing them with the same rhythm that Sherlock was caressing him. Their bodies moved together as a wave on the shore, slow and unceasing, seemingly never ending, locked together.
“There will be lots of drainage, let us know if it’s anything alarming. Keep up with the massager…and I think that’s it. Let’s give you a few weeks to adjust and heal, then we will be getting going on that ear. And, uh, I will need my phone back, please,” she joked, as Sherlock was continuing to investigate his new appendage closely in its reflection. He handed it back, abashed, but was quickly appeased when John handed him his own phone to replace it.
It was five hours later when the young lady that had initially escorted John to the waiting room came to fetch him. Mycroft had excused himself after glumly accepting a sandwich, leaving John to stare out the window, pace, punch, seethe, and sweat all by himself. Two surgeons met John outside Sherlock’s post-operative recovery room.
Sherlock’s eyes were only on John, seeking reassurance. “Sherlock, it looks really, really good. I mean that,” John said, amazed. There were some trace lines of were the skin had been joined, much like his cheek, but they had been tucked into the natural contours of Sherlock’s face. In a few more months, John knew that if he didn’t know where to look for those scars, he wouldn’t even know there were there. But his nose was back. John was looking at Sherlock for the first time in months without bandages and with a complete nose and it felt like he was looking at Sherlock for the first time – ever. John felt his heart leap.
For the first time in a long time, Sherlock’s eyes were bright with hope.
“Yes,” he said. “Hun-gry.”
“You still want me to cut your hair?”
Thank you for all your kudos and comments, I am so pleased this little story has become meaningful! And...I just have to share...I became the patient of unexpected nasal surgery last week. For real. Art imitating life imitating art, eh?
“Right, right, well, you don’t have to yell. Here, take these meds. This one is antibiotics, this one for pain. I was going to take you off the IV, but with this fever I think it’s going to be the best way to get fluids into you 24/7.”
Gazing at the undulating red-pink-black of the coals, he finally shrugged and let it go. If anything, he was just over-tired, and over-thinking.
“Sure,” John managed. “I’ll be right back.” He managed to get himself out of the chair and upstairs to change. Frantically he dug for some old pajama pants as he usually slept in a t-shirt and boxers, cursing as he rummaged through his drawers, then praising
“Jaw,” came a call from Sherlock. John beat a path to his bedroom. The stitches and bandages that covered them encircled the right side of Sherlock’s face and over the top of his head, restricting his speech, so John was very happy to hear him attempt talking at all. The detective raised to fingers to his dry lips and tapped them when John entered the room.
John carried the tea cups into the kitchen. “Should probably head on into bed. Big day tomorrow,” he said over his shoulder. Sherlock stood up and began to play his violin, his back to John, long legs ramrod straight, arms at precise angles as he glided the bow effortlessly over the strings. The melody was one John had never heard before, strong but slow, complex but sweet. Sherlock’s nimble fingers pounced on the strings, directing the movement of the piece in a way that made John realized this was a Sherlock original.
After the incident.
The young woman sat down and ran a hand over her forehead. “From what I can see, he has pretty limited oral movement. Those muscles in his face have been damaged, and they must be stretched and moved. It will be painful at first, but like anything, it will improve with time, if he does the exercises.”
Sherlock's fever finally breaks, and John plays barber.
“Oh, I’m sorry John. How is Sherlock? Does...everything look all right?”
It was time to move on, time to start life.
“I’m not going to lie to you, it’s going to need future surgery. Once your hair grows back over it, you won’t see it. The plastic surgeon that Mycroft got for you is quite outstanding.”
John tapped his forehead with the device, a bit too hard, but it was punishment for his oversight. After a few minutes, he put device back into the box and went to the refrigerator, contemplating its contents. Nothing in there soft enough.
Sherlock, still holding his gaze, gave Mycroft a quick nod in thanks.
Trembling, he had curled up into a ball and fell back to sleep until his phone buzzed with a text from Dr. Whitcomb hours later. He managed to rouse himself and stumble to the computer where he now sat, reading and then responding to her email.
“Is there something you wanted,” John said flatly, arms crossed.
“Not one word. Not one bloody word,” John whispered into his cell phone. “The whole move here, I know it must have been painful at times, but damn the man. He just closed his eyes and turned his head and didn’t say anything.” John squeezed the bridge of his nose with two fingers. “Thank you, Molly. Yes, I will call if I need anything. I think we – he – just needs time.”
When it was all said and done, John had to admit he had done a decent job. He had sat Sherlock in one of the kitchen chairs set by the fireplace, a towel around his shoulders. Using a wet comb to keep the curls under a bit of control, John took small sections between his fingers and trimmed them using a spare pair of sharp scissors from his med kit. He was clumsy at first, and forced himself to take long, even breaths as if doing surgery for he was fearful his hands would shake. This was an intimate task, coming close into his flatmate’s personal space, even standing between Sherlock’s thighs to reach the top of his head. The detective sat ramrod straight and still, aware of John’s focus. The dark curls had a silken feel on John’s fingers and he sectioned and combed the hair a few times extra to insure their evenness….and to enjoy their texture. The gentle caretaker smoothed Sherlock’s hair back from his forehead, a brief thought of what it would be like to grab it in a fit of passion racing through his head so quickly he had to blink rapidly to keep his concentration.
“Sherlock, nonono, it’s all right now,” John pleaded as he tried to capture Sherlock’s flailing hands. The detective was gasping for air, but John realized it was not due to a medical issue. Sherlock seemed to be in the midst of a panic attack. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you, you’re all right,” John soothed. Sherlock twisted away, blankets winding, the IV toppling and yanking at the needle in the patient’s arm. Sherlock yelped in pain, and John took the opportunity to pin the man down under him, each hand holding Sherlock’s wrists beside his head, and straddling him across his waist. Sherlock bared his teeth, shaking his head from side to side.
, Sherlock surmised when John finally stepped back.
“You listen to me,” John hissed, eyes dark and dangerous as a demon’s. “If you think for one
A few days later, John unlocked the door to 221B and watched as Sherlock took the last few steps to the flat and stagger to his chair. Home, at last. Both men exhaled a deep sigh of relief and smiled at each other when they realized they did so in unison. The detective was weak from the multiple surgeries but Dr. Wadsworth, true to her calling, had once again let them leave the hospital early so Sherlock could complete his recovery at home. Bandages encircled his head, reminiscent of his initial injuries, but they both hoped it was for the last time. The doctors had protested what Sherlock had proposed, but in the end relented – to a degree. They removed the ear and Dr. Herry shaped a small amount of donor cartilage into a semi-circular shape and inserted it under the skin of where the ear used to be, stitching it in place. The result could certainly not pass as an ear, but Dr. Herry instructed that it was a good beginning to one should Sherlock change his mind.
“I was planning on replacing your bandages tomorrow, but looks like they’ve been a bit, eh, displaced. Why don’t we take them off and I’ll see if I can’t have less of them on you. Sound good?”
“Will you be needing anything else, then?”
Sherlock responded with a sound that could be translated as, “What, me worry?” and John smiled.
“I fancy myself quite the cook,” John said. “I even have Sherlock eating vegetables.”
“Sherlock, are you concerned with your appearance? The way the scar looks, your ear, your nose? Because if you are, you need to get over it right now. Let’s talk about it. Because you are in the initial stages of healing, and you have a long way to go with reconstructive surgery. I don’t want you worrying about it, right? We have a long road ahead of you, and it’s going to be all right.”
“Yes, better than all right. Come, let’s have some tea and I’ll tell you all about it.”
“I promise,” John groaned, arching his back into the erection behind him. Sherlock pushed down John’s briefs with quick hand and shimmied out of his own silken pajama bottoms, laying the length of his stiff cock into the crack between John’s bare buttocks. Sherlock began to move against him, his hand on John’s hip, the sweat from their bodies and the leakage from Sherlock providing lubricant between them. John flexed his arms again, wanting to grasp the curls that tickled his neck, but Sherlock did not let go. John moaned loudly at the feeling of being captured, contained, rolling his head back in ecstasy. Sherlock slid his wet lips along the exposed skin, teeth grazing his neck.
I would take advantage of a person in a vulnerable state, if you think for one
“Oh, Molly!”
“It’s okay, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. Looks like all this has been giving you some early greys,” John said easily. “Don’t worry, it’s very appealing. Here, you won’t be able to see…let me show you on my phone. There you go – oh, now don’t frown. Gray is a feature of maturity, you know!”
Molly hung her head, disappointed. “He knows I don’t care about that, doesn’t he?”
“That’s gud,” affirmed Sherlock, nodding, eyes alight. “I can beeth!” He took in a large breath through his nose but then winced.
“Easy there,” he whispered. With some difficulty, he pulled on a new top and eased him down onto a fresh, cool pillow. Sherlock was out…a deep, restful sleep, long limbs loose, face relaxed, chest collapsing then rising again in perfect rhythm. John cleaned up the used bandages, collected the bucket and towels, and left the room. In the kitchen he put everything away, the opened the new refrigerator and stared at its contents.
, John told himself, even as he felt as if his heart were tearing in two.
“Jawn,” the sun through the window struck Sherlock’s eyes at such an angle it gave them a luminescence. John was enchanted, and felt his lips part in a sigh. When the detective gave yet another tug on his hand, John leaned in.
“You look wonderful,” Molly murmured shyly, and Sherlock dipped his head and touched his chest over his heart in thanks.
Ah, yes. The bed.
“I’m right here, Sherlock,” John said, his eyes darting, inventorying supplies.
John opened the door to see the bedside lamp and his careful array of medications and bandages on the floor. Sherlock was sitting up in bed, tearing at the bandages on his face, his one visible eye wide and frantic.
, John thought as he withdrew, mentally clenching his heart protectively against what may occur next.
John hit send with a pleased nod and took a sip of his steaming tea. He turned in his chair and gazed out the window overlooking Baker Street, taking a moment to appreciate the morning sun warming the flat…and thinking about last night.
John obliged and went back to his reading, glancing up every once in a while, noting that Sherlock would pinch off a piece of crumbly scone and push it into the left side of his mouth. This produced a fair bit of mess, but John ignored it, unwilling to make Sherlock self-conscious.
“Har,” Sherlock said suddenly. At John’s quizzical look, Sherlock rolled his eyes in annoyance and texted:
– John had shown in the care of his best friend.
John struggles. And Sherlock is just there. Steadfast.
“Tank you,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock needs an adult to guide him, if you think for one
Sherlock let his hands drop and John dared to place his palms on each cheek, carefully wiping away the detective’s tears with his thumbs.
“Well, I think we better keep going with that,” he said more to himself than Sherlock. His hands trembled just a bit as he removed the patient’s bottoms. He ran the warm sponge down Sherlock’s long back and over his bottom, which clenched at John’s touch. John bit his lower lip, reminding himself that he was Sherlock’s doctor.
“Wonderful. I’ll go -,” John began, but Sherlock pulled off his covers and swung his feet to the floor. He was shirtless and the cool air of the flat made his smooth chest goose-pimple. John pulled a fresh top out of the drawer – noting it was the last one, he had to call the laundry service today – and Sherlock raised his arms in the air like a child while it was pulled over his head. The detective put a hand on John’s shoulder as he stood, steadying himself, John noting those long five fingers clenching for balance, those long five fingers….
“How is he?” she asked, a bit too brightly.
John sat back in his chair, reread the email a few times, and finally hit send. He stood up grabbed a few biscuits from the kitchen, the pile of towels and a bucket of warm water and went into Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Where do you want the rest?”
“We are here for each other, Sherlock,” was John’s modest, but heartfelt, reply.
“Yoo-hoo,” Mrs. Hudson whispered gently as she opened the door. “Fresh tea for you.”
Though he loathe to do it, John called Mycroft as he placed his uneaten platter of food back into the fridge. Not an hour later, a heart monitor, oxygen unit, automatic blood pressure cuff and additional medications and fluids were delivered to 221B courtesy of Sherlock’s brother.
“His speech is improving every day as well. Now we just have got to sort out what is going on with his bloody ear. But, I’m so sorry, how are you?”
Sherlock put his hand on John’s knee and gave a firm squeeze, then quickly abashed, pulled it back as a plume of red flushed his cheeks. The moment was taken away from them as they pulled up to their Baker Street flat to the flash of cameras from the paparazzi. Sherlock had just enough time to duck his head as John shouted to the driver to keep going.
“Excellent.” John took a step back and nodded, then glanced at his watch. “Three hours in now. At least another three. Help yourself to a sandwich. We have some ways to go.”
“How are you feeling about later today?” John asked. Sherlock looked up at his flat mate with a frown. “Bandages are coming off today, remember? No more mouth breathing. New nose. Sleeping laying down! Much excitement to be had!”
“John?”
“Sherlock,” John whispered, and the detective nodded and pressed his lips together, as if wanting to preserve the taste of John in them. He looked up at his doctor, his flatmate, his friend, a bit more strength in his jawline, a bit more confidence in his eyes. John leaned in again, kissing him fully but gently, lips on lips this time for real, cradling Sherlock’s head in his hands. He felt the detective respond with equal pressure as he lay his hands on John’s shoulders.
“Oh, er - ,”
Well, my darlings, this is the end. I know I had mentioned earlier of increasing the chapter count from my original planned 10 to 15, but upon further writing, editing (and rewriting and editing and rewriting and editing) it seemed that brevity was the soul of this story. Sometimes you just can't fight your muse!
“You’re saying that Sherlock, in his current state of mind, has the potential for making foolish choices,” John said, anger beginning to creep into his voice.
The detective tossed his phone aside on the bed and shrugged. He busied himself by sweeping the crumbs from his lap onto his plate.
“Good,” John repeated. Sherlock opened his eyes at the sound of John’s voice, eyes filled with wonder, and desire…but something else, too.
,” John managed. Sherlock slid off the doctor, leaving an arm thrown across his chest. With some maneuvering, John kicked off his pants and grabbed a corner of a blanket to pull over them.
“Stay,” Sherlock whispered directly into John’s ear, this one word eliciting shivers from the doctor.
“What, read the newspaper now?”
“Absolutely,” John nodded. “He really cannot speak much. The skin grafts are a bit tight and still healing, so it’s difficult to move his mouth.”
“Haw.”
They laughed through the tears that threatened, and then kissed.
“Yes, I’m okay,” John replied, surprised, but then quickly realized Sherlock was putting up his front, placing his line, telling John not to baby him. The nurses, the circumstance, already made the detective to feel vulnerable enough. There was certainly pain, but John would address it when Sherlock determined it was time.
“Wat,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock ran his hand down John’s ribcage and leg, those long fingers rubbing and pressing his flesh, stroking up and down in a long, gentle motion.
“Here, let’s get you sitting up a bit more,” John said, adjusting the pillows behind Sherlock. He handed the detective a scone on a plate and then sat down and opened the paper.
“Oh, um, thank you – yes, right over here,” John stammered.
, and you stay
“Yes, I’ll read to you at the hospital. Now go to sleep or I’m moving over to the cot.”
The next morning when John awoke, he was momentarily disorientated. He was in Sherlock’s room, but not in the cot –
For the next few days, life at 221B became an easy rhythm for the two men. After a leisurely breakfast, John caught up on emails and paperwork, while Sherlock reviewed the increasing number of files that Lestrade was sending over. Then there would be a short session of speech therapy with new exercises, with the speech therapist video-conferencing in. Sherlock would then retreat to his room, sometimes playing the violin, sometimes taking a nap, sometimes reading, or a combination of the three.
Mycroft ignored the doctor and walked over to his younger brother. Sherlock did not turn away and the two stood face to face. “I see my doctor did an excellent job,” Mycroft remarked, studying Sherlock’s cheek. “Maybe I should have taken the opportunity to give you a new identity. Nice haircut, too. Well done, John. Though you would think your years of practice as a doctor would have given you a steadier hand."
John thought better of it, and hit SEND before he changed his mind. He had been impressed with the doctor, an intelligent and kind woman of Mediterranean descent with large brown eyes and long black hair and olive skin. She was no nonsense, the only doctor to give Sherlock’s attitude right back to him, making the detective respect her just a bit. She was the one who John went to when he decided he wanted to bring Sherlock home, and she understood and assisted him with arranging it.
“Best get some good sleep, now. Big day tomorrow. I’ll be in to read in a few minutes.”
“Tehl may,” Sherlock urged.
The remainder of the afternoon was pleasant, John reading until he was about hoarse, a pleasant rainfall tapping against the window, and Sherlock massaging his face with the new device from the hospital. It must have been between articles – and with the soft murmur of the rain and the drone of the face massager – that John dozed off. He was awoken from his slumber with a slap of a pillow to the face.
“See there, it’s all good. You’re going to be sore in the mouth, so we’ve got some soft food for you here. You let me know when you think you can eat, even just a few bites. We’ll try in a bit, yeah? Cheeks and eyes are going to hurt, too. Everything has got to settle into place. I brought your phone so it’s just like old times, texting me every minute of the day,” John moved back easily into his monologue, knowing how the sound of his voice soothed Sherlock. “Don’t you worry, all that talking got you ahead of the game, you’ll be starting right back up again at it once the swelling goes down, we have to keep that face moving, no slowing you down.”
“You all right?”
He had read the paper to Sherlock, an activity that had apparently become part of their new routine. The detective had fallen to sleep after the fifth story, but John staying the room and continued to read, his tone lowered to hushed tones. It was only when he began to yawn himself that he decided to go to bed.
He falls, and he feels like Batman, or Spiderman, but he shakes it off, because Sherlock's already told John he's no hero.
Amy asks him if he's a pervert but Sherlock doesn't know what that is, so says no. She then asks him if he's physic and Sherlock smiles and tells her he just observed.
Everybody but Molly and Lestrade say it won't last, but then a week turns into two, two turns into three, that turns into six and then twelve, Sherlock then forgets he's counting, because John is like Sherlock thought, consistent.
Sherlock wonders if it's possible to actually die of a broken heart, because every since he started injecting, him and Mummy didn't talk much any more.
Sherlock's never lived alone before, and everything feels too empty and cold and too quiet.
That's when Mummy walks into the kitchen, screams and drops what ever she is carrying. Mummy grabs his hand and yanks him away, her hand is tight and it hurts, but Sherlock doesn't mind that. His Mummy is making a lot of noise though, and Sherlock is finding it hard to understand, so he tries to fight her off.
There's light seeping through the window, soft and gentle and hands on his shoulders, heavy and solid, the way Sherlock likes it. It's John, because John is always there, he's the one variable that never changes.
Well, Lestrade arrested them, Sherlock just helped out.
Molly doesn't change much though, and Sherlock likes that, but Molly is always too close. She lingers too long and smiles too much and laughs too loudly.
He spends most of the day avoiding Roger, but Sherlock knows he can't pay for a flat on his own.
"Breath," he orders, and Sherlock does, one breathe, two breaths, three breaths...
"I can stop any time I want Mycroft," Sherlock says, because he knows it's true. Addicts are idiots, and Sherlock is far from dumb.
But Sherlock feels tired too, so he sleeps, with his skin feeling heavy and bones feeling hollow. But Sherlock feels sand paper in his dreams, and chases after insects. Three years old and sixteen, standing at his fathers funeral in the rags of his parents expectations with blood on his hands, cold blood now, and Sherlock is gasping and sweating.
She doesn't let go, so Sherlock digs his nails into her skin in hopes she will. Instead, she pulls him to her and hugs him so tightly that it makes it a little hard to breath. Sherlock doesn't mind this though, because he likes Mummys' tight hugs.
Sherlock doesn't understand why nobody told him about it before.
Sherlock is thirty-three and John moves in. John is stable and consistent, Sherlock likes that. Sherlock also likes that John never moves his stuff without asking, and even when he gets angry, he doesn't push his face into Sherlock's.
Sherlock is twenty, and his brain has gone into over-drive. Sherlock loves university and wonders if he can stay for as many years as he wants. Roger can see how high-strung he is, and offers a solution. Sherlock finds out that cocaine is a perfect solution for his spit-fire brain and Sherlock finds it so much easier to communicate with people and for once, Sherlock feels normal.
Sherlock is three years old and hasn't learned how to focus yet. He doesn't know what evidence means, or what it normally implies. All Sherlock sees is that one strap on her dress is twisted, and she has freckles on her noise, and a large one on her collar bone. She has shallow breast and no bra. Sherlock can see her nipples.
Sherlock is all too eager to help.
The blood, warmer than Sherlock anticipated, and thinner too, flows down Sherlock fingers and he watches numbly as Roger falls and fades.
Sherlock isn't bored though, trying to solve who killed Carl Powers doesn't work out, but it gives Sherlock a new outlet. He always searches the papers to do with crimes, not all of them are about death though, some are about robbery and missing artifacts. Father tells him its creepy and he should act like a normal twelve year old.
Sherlock is twenty-four and things have steadily gotten worse. He's taking cocaine again and locks himself in his room a lot. He ignores Mycroft's phone calls, because he knows Mycroft is right now, that Roger is a bad influence. Sherlock is twenty-four, has four A-level, a degree in Anatomy and Physiology and has only managed to keep one job but got fired after too many customer complaints.
Mummy asks him, "Aren't you lonely, sweetheart?" And Sherlock doesn't understand why he would be lonely when he doesn't like any of them, and they don't like him either.
This just makes Roger even angrier.
Sherlock is nineteen when he makes his first friend.
All the children in school are too loud and they talk to much but never say anything important, so Sherlock spends his lunch times alone, observing the teachers and the bugs. Other children think he's strange and their parents think he's adorable and shy until he starts talking, and then its all, 'well, I never!'
Sherlock wonders if it will feel like damp sandpaper, so he touches it. Its not exactly the same, but Sherlock doesn't mind because he likes the sensation still.
Sherlock is twenty-two, and still living with Roger. Sometimes, Sherlock wonders if Roger is still the same person. Roger does Heroin now too, as well as cocaine.
Sherlock is thirty-seven and so tired, desperately, aching. His skin feels tight, his bones heavy and nothing seems to move like it should. Sherlock just does what he always does. He solves crimes, saves lives and keeps hurting people without knowing how to stop. He doesn't remember the rules, and wish John was there to teach him.
Some of the children in school talk to Sherlock and expect a reply, some of them think they already know his answer. Sherlock doesn't like them, they remind him of Father, and he doesn't like that.
Sherlock meets Molly, and he likes how she looks, because she looks simple, and nothing about her is too flashy and she doesn't draw too much attention. Sherlock finds it easy to concentrate around her.
Things become as normal as they could be after a three year gap. Sherlock is two people now though, three on days when he's on a case, and he pours energy into cups and spins around the lab like he never left.
He reads about Carl Powers in the paper, 'tragic swimming accident' it says. Sherlock knows better though. Father tells him he shouldn't be focusing on it and takes all of Sherlock crime books away, even the one about blood splatter. Mummy and Mycroft keep saying that Sherlock is just bored and should play his violin or tend to his bees'.
Sherlock knows she has prominent hip bones, a mole on her left foot and a small burn on her ankle. Sherlock also knows she has a younger sibling, two or three, and three dogs, two small ones and a big one. Amy doesn't tell Sherlock this though, but Sherlock can see it.
“Uh, yes, of course. I’m here with you. We have a long road ahead of us, I meant to say.” John’s heart thumped inside his chest so hard at this statement he was sure Sherlock could see his rib cage tremble.
John loved cabs. Always did. They were his preferred method of transportation, and he had let his license lapse a long time ago. In his younger days he had associated them with the tart smell of chums after a rugby game, the sweet scent of a young lady after a date, and now that he was older, the hum of excitement when investigating a case with Sherlock. They weren’t always comfortable or fast, but John would trust the driver to get him to where he needed to be. Right now, the gentle sway of the vehicle was putting the doctor to sleep. Except his cell phone kept buzzing and the man next to him was poking at him to answer.
John slid beneath the covers as gently as he could, but his shaking hands and hammering heart made him feel clumsy. He lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, and licked his lips nervously.
As we enter the first day of home care, John discovers Sherlock has a dangerous fever.
“I’m saying that I need you to be the adult in this situation,” came the monotone reply.
They said their goodbyes, John promising to keep Molly up to date, then he opened the package. Inside was a small device, shaped to fit into his hand, with a circular metal plate at its top about the size of a bottle cap. John pressed a button to turn it on and touch the metal plate, which vibrated just in the slightest. It would be used to massage Sherlock’s face to promote healing and circulation to his new skin. But John was not cheered by the delivery. Sherlock was not eating because
“If I bump that nose, I’m going to be in a lot of trouble,” he said, smiling down at Sherlock, hands still on Sherlock’s head, now running his fingers through the wild curls. “You should get some rest now. Hold on, what’s this?”
“I don’t know how to cut hair,” John said.
John opened his mouth, uncertain how to answer, when his cell phone buzzed with a text. “I’m sorry, Molly, that’s Dr. Wadsworth. Come on, I know Sherlock will be very pleased to see you.”
“No.”
John scratched his own head, his face scrunched in thought and studied Sherlock’s head. There was a certain lop-sidedness to it, he had to admit. Approximately ¼ of the detective’s head was near bald, with just a bit of fuzziness coming back in, and the other ¾ was his usual crown of soft curls, which was actually getting a bit long, even for Sherlock.
The doctor’s phone rang in his back pocket, cutting off his thoughts.
“Thank you, doctor,” John said, and with an understanding nod, she left the room. A quiet figure almost immediately appeared in the hospital room doorway.
“Ooh,” escaped his lips so involuntarily that the three doctors broke into wide smiles. “Eets me!”
John thought. “Get some rest,” he repeated, pulling a light cover over Sherlock. “You are finally going to get some good sleep.” Indeed, the detective’s eyes were already drooping, and he could only nod in response. John reluctantly stood up but stood by the door for a long moment, pondering the quiet, lean figure that lay reposed in the bed. Sherlock’s chest rose and fell quietly, his lips still open slightly, but John could already tell that the fear that the detective had been carrying for these long two weeks was beginning to fade. The operation had been a success. Sherlock looked like Sherlock again, though John knew if the procedure had ended up making the man looking like a monster he would still never leave.
John ended the call but stared at the phone for several minutes, deciding what to do next. His best friend and comrade in arms, the great Sherlock Holmes, was back at home at 221B.
If John (friend) thought for a moment about what John (doctor) had seen and dealt with in that room….a panic attack? A disfiguring injury? John clamped his eyes shut, determined to erase the sight of the half-bald, paler-than usual, wasted man bleakly laying in the bed in the flat. That was not the Sherlock that he knew, but it was the Sherlock right now. John tried to take a deep breath, to ease the clamp that seems to have seized around his chest. He gave himself a quick nod, and marched through the door.
“I was told that if certain, um, people saw you here, they would assume Mr. Holmes was here as well. And we would like to be discreet as possible.”
“Sherlock knows I care. Do you?”
“Dr. Watson?” An attractive young woman appeared, hand outstretched. “Will you come with me, please? We’ve arranged a waiting room for you.”
“Well, I’ll read you the interesting bits, that way we both hear it at once,” John said, flipping through the pages. “Maybe we’ll even get a case. There’s nothing wrong with your brain, you know.”
“Come on – EEEEEE,” John turned Sherlock’s head towards him by tucking a finger under Sherlock’s chin.
Sherlock looked disdainfully down his bandaged nose at his brother.
“I like it, too.”
When the doctors and a nurse arrived, toting instruments and equipment, Sherlock nervously and rudely denied them tea and steered them to his bedroom. He lay on the bed while they removed the dressings, the inner supports and packing inside the nose, and suctioned and examined him. One doctor stood on either side, John at the foot of the bed, pretending not to be nervous. The doctors soothed Sherlock through it, and although he lay as still as a mannequin, John watched as the detective’s fists clenched in pain through the uncomfortable process. John brought over additional lamps as the stitches were carefully removed, one by one.
Sherlock and John startled and stood up quickly, turning to find Mycroft standing in the doorway of 221B.
“Of course, I’ll go make some.” John, his hands now full, walked towards the door. His phone in his back pocket buzzed twice in quick succession.
“Sleep now. I’m your John, and you’re my Sherlock.”
The cupboard – aha, a scone mix. John gathered the ingredients – thank you, Mycroft, for our well stocked kitchen – and watched them while they baked in the oven, taking them out while they were just a touch underbaked, warm and buttery, soft and crumbly.
The two men touched lips, ever so lightly, just barely skin on skin, breath on breath, heat on gorgeous heat. There they stayed for a long moment, closer than ever before, each captivated by the moment. John felt the ghost of Sherlock’s eyelashes against his cheek as they slowly and reluctantly separated, not pulling away, but accepting the promise of more.
“Jawn, ef I die toomaurrooo – “
“Right, then -,”
“You cold?  Here, I’ll finish this up and get you warm again,” John said, reaching for a new top for Sherlock.
“Do you really think so?” John bristled. “You don’t care about cases anymore! You used to be bored, bored, if you had time on your hands. Now you want to sleep all day. You just woke up – it’s 11 am! You don’t want to leave the flat. The kitchen hasn’t seen a microscope in ages, the fridge is clean of body parts! What am I supposed to think?” John quieted his voice from a shout to a whisper, his words slow and measured. “I’m worried, Sherlock. I’m worried. Please. I want to make sure…you are all right.”
John clenched the arms of the chair, waiting. Sherlock slowly moved his mouth and lips in an exaggerated fashion, slowly forming the sounds.
he sighed. John bagged the medical waste and deposited it into the labeled-as-such receptacle in the kitchen – must have been brought here by minions of Mycroft, what else will I be finding? – he checked his phone.
Mycroft tells him that it doesn't change anything, and Sherlock says, "I know that Mycroft, I'm not stupid."
Molly is too eager though, always willing too please and it makes Sherlock wonder what her motive is.
When his classmates speak to him, he only tells them the truth and what he sees. Normally that results in somebody having a wet face, and Sherlock knows enough now to understand they're crying, but he doesn't know why. Then Sherlock gets sent to the naughty seat and he wonders why his Mummy and Father wanted him to speak so badly.
Everybody knows them now though, Sherlock and his side-kick, John, and somebody has to know something. Sherlock hates the word side-kick too, because John is so much more, John is his everything now, he's Sherlock morning, noon and night.
Sherlock collects skulls so he has something to talk to.
Sherlock isn't sure what to do.
Then it was Lestrade who tried making a deal with Sherlock. If Sherlock gets himself off the drugs, and stays off them, he'll let Sherlock help out 'unofficially' with cases.
Roger has gotten worse too, Sherlock can't have conversation with him any more. They last about a minute on the best days. Some days, Roger doesn't come home, and that doesn't bother Sherlock. Sherlock doesn't know where Roger gets his drugs from, because Sherlock used to get them off Roger, but now he gets them off another man called Sam.
Because Sherlock's brilliant, always has been, he's a genius, and finds out at least fifteen facts about somebody just by looking at them, but he still can't read them. At thirty-nine, people still confuse him, and the rules are too complicated but John is still trying to teach Sherlock the rules, and Sherlock still isn't getting them.
Cocaine for Sherlock isn't about the high, he sees it more of a comfort and not as a crutch, but a support beam.
But Sherlock doesn't want to be anybody else but himself, and the tears feel like acid and his heart feels like a piston, thump, thump, thump and it hurts and Sherlock can't stop it.
Sherlock is twelve and knows how to focus now. Now that Sherlock is older, Mycroft explains to him what death is and that everybody dies. It sounds painful to Sherlock and it just motivates him not to make friends because he doesn't want them to die.
Sherlock is seven and talks now, but only to Mummy, Father, Mycroft and his teachers. Mummy and Father hired a speech therapist, but Sherlock doesn't know why. Now that he's older, he wonders how pointing at an object and saying its name very slowly like he didn't understand was meant to help him. Everybody older than him talks at him, and not to him. Sherlock doesn't want to talk to them, he doesn't think they'd listen.
Sometimes the world is just too much.
Sherlock asks Mycroft if that's true.
Sometimes, when Roger does come home, Sherlock stays at Sam's.
Mummy says the words 'head injury' and 'blood', but Sherlock doesn't understand them either. He still doesn't know that Mummy is crying, or why she is so upset. At three years old, Sherlock doesn't understand that the girl, his babysitter was hurt. Sherlock is only three and doesn't know what death is yet.
