"Oh, both the phone and the laptop have cameras. See?" She pointed out where the cameras were located on the phone and the laptop and then showed him the phone's screen, which was currently capturing the side of his neck and chest as he turned to look in Oswin's direction. "You can see everything I see, and I can see everything you see. I'll also be wearing this," she held up a small device that had the word "Bluetooth" written on the side of it. "So that way I can hear everything you're saying, and I can still talk to you. Does that sound like it will work?"
"No," Natasha said. "All you were doing was exhausting yourself. You need to calm down; relax."
"Sure, you are," Tony said into his shoulder. His arms quickly wrapped around Steve's torso and he clung to him almost for dear life.
"Yes, I can and I will," she said. "Tony is going to be fine."
"Good thing he won't be there for long." Tony turned his head just in time to catch a glimpse of a whoosh of red and black blowing into the hospital at a rapid pace. Hill futilely tried to chase after her, screaming "Agent Romanoff, come back here right now," but it was clear that Romanoff wasn't going to stop for anything or anyone. She was out of sight within seconds.
"No, I'm sure that's fine," Jessica said. "I gave him a lethal amount of jellyfish venom by accident. I don't know what to do."
"That's what happened earlier," Clint added. "I left the door to my room open and Lucky got out. He managed to traverse his way downstairs and caught up to the two of us. As soon as Bruce saw him, he let me go and started petting the dog." Slowly, he saw the beginnings of a smile cross Natasha's lips.
"No, it's smart," Adoniram insisted. "As these are my best two RCMP agents; the sisters gifted by the mist?"
"Okay," Lara said. "Is it alright if I go in and see him? There are a few questions on this form I don't know the answers to."
Tony honestly found himself doubting that but managed to push his own irrationalities and sat down as instructed. The chair wasn't as comfortable as the couch out in the waiting room, but it was noticeably softer than he was expecting. Across from him, Dr. Cranston took on a relaxed pose as she began to speak.
"Should I take that to mean you bring your work home with you?" To Tony's surprise, the doctor laughed.
The HR rep eyed him warily for a moment before continuing with her program. Once everyone turned their attentions back to the speaker, Pepper gave Tony a sharp look. Tony rolled his eyes.
) However, she doubted he told Pepper anything about it (out of respect for her privacy more than anything) and she didn't think "I thought you were going to kill me" was a valid excuse for attacking a superior. (It wasn't at the real estate company she worked at immediately after the Secret Service.) So, essentially, Lara was expecting to be fired right that instant.
"Sure, you are," Clint said with an eyeroll. "How is snapping creepy anyway?"
"We don't have a minute," Hill started to say before Lara cut her off.
Thank you to DiveTooDeep for leaving a comment on AO3! It really means a lot! :)
"Yeah, you're probably right." Just the thought of having to stand in front of a room full of strangers and having to talk about the worst mistakes he'd ever made in his life made Tony shudder. He was barely able to talk about that stuff with
The girl looked to the man behind her – quite obviously her father – who gave her a reassuring nod. She then rushed forward, eagerly holding out the box as she made it to the stage. Barton took it graciously and exchanged a few words with him after a few moments, he looked back up at the crowd.
"So, he's waking up," he concluded.
"What I said hurt you." Tony fell silent. "I knew it would before I said it and I still said it anyway. I was upset, and I hurt you on purpose and I'm sorry for that. It was bad enough that I already did a complete one-eighty on you, but to imply I was better than you in any way…"
Although a doctor would probably advise against it, Tony was once again trying to alleviate his pain with alcohol. Yes, he knew that all alcohol did was numb the pain a bit and cause problems such as dehydration and deoxygenation of the brain which would end up making his headache much worse later, but now he didn't care. It was making him feel something resembling better and it had the added benefit of making him forget about the earlier interview, so in his mind, it was the best option available to him for getting through this press conference with his fragile sanity intact. Besides, for right now it was just one drink and it wasn't like he'd be driving himself home later.
"Probably," Clint said.
"I just did." Lara stepped closer to Hill, putting a hand on her back and pushing her closer to the door. "Out." Hill protested the entire way, but Lara managed to get her out the door. As she closed it, the realization dawned on her that she just physically assaulted an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. She bit back a groan as she lightly slammed her head against the door.
"Only temporarily," he tried to assure. "A few hours; a day at the most. I have somewhere for him to go, I need to make a call and get ahold of a plane first." Tony sighed.
Remember kids, if you don't want to say something to someone, just walk away.
"We did everything we could," Natasha said.
"Sweet dreams." Steve smiled.
"You fired him?"
"Apparently I'm volatile," Tony continued as he hooked up the tablet to the holographic projection screen. "Self-obsessed, don't play well with others."
"I'm great." Those words sounded genuine and made Steve reflect Tony's soft smile.
"But one we must all deal with, right Tony?" When he didn't immediately respond, Lara pressed her foot down on his,
"I do want to know, though," Lara said. "Should I try apologizing when he gets back or would it be better to wait until tomorrow when he's – hopefully – better?"
"Tony?"
"I was at a flea market with my sister and my aunt," Annabeth said. "My sister has a key to the house, but she only uses it when I'm out of town and need someone to feed and walk my dog."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is it true?" Steve asked. "Do you think that?"
"And the infected person, they'll be fine?" Subarian hesitated to respond.
"Right." He could tell he wasn't going to like what she had to say next.
"Seriously," Tony said. "If you want to talk about anything – it doesn't even have to be what's bothering you – just anything you want to talk about, I'm all ears. We still have two hours to kill." Tony saw the expression on Steve's face change to one of contemplation before moving to arrange himself, so he was comfortable again.
"I take that to mean your father is not invited to the wedding?" Betty let out a bit of a humorless laugh.
Those thoughts, obviously, depressed him. He tried to push them away, but every time he did, his thoughts would go to his symptoms and how sick he felt. When he pushed those thoughts away, his mind would go straight back to his loved ones and what would happen to them after his likely impending demise. It was a vicious cycle and it did nothing to help him relax. He tossed and turned for a bit, but ultimately, he had to accept that he wasn't going to fall asleep. Rolling back onto his back, Clint opened his eyes again.
"Are you sure?" Fury asked.
"So, the dog…" He could hear Laura take a deep breath as he trailed off.
"No," Tony said. "Just stay there and don't take off the sensor."
"So, it's true?" Tony nodded.
While he waited for the call to be transferred, Rhodey checked Tony over again. His pulse was still slow and his head still warm. Despite that, Tony did not look any worse for wear. In fact, one could easily mistake him for being in a very deep sleep. However, that was not the case. Tony could be in danger and whether he did that to himself or not didn't matter. Tiberius Stone was responsible for this. Of that, Rhodey was certain.
"Ah," Steve said.
"If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded," Steve pointed out.
"Good," Steve said. "Well, better now that I can actually breathe fresh air."
"I can't comment on that," because he knew S.H.I.E.L.D. would want that kept quiet, too. Everhart didn't seem deterred, though.
"Besides," Lara continued. "Her name is in the packet we
The third page consisted of more medical information, most of which Rhodey already knew so he didn't have to ask for too many things. Just Tony's current weight, medications he was taking, and when the last time he had an EKG was. Page four and the first half of page five listed a series of anti-psychotic medications and asked whether he had ever been prescribed them. They were able to skip over that with a big "N/A." That led them to the second half of page five, which inquired about the history of mental illness in his family.
"Does the doctor know you're leaving?" he asked.
The way he was so nonchalant about Tony's disappearance rubbed her the wrong way. Hell, it rubbed all of them the wrong way, especially Steve. She could see the spark of fear deep in his eyes. The sheer fear that something bad had happened to Tony sent him into a panic attack. (Something, she noted, that they should probably discuss later.) She was surprised that Freeman's behavior didn't cause him to have a heart attack right there. So, although she and Tony weren't on the best of terms now, she couldn't stand to see Steve like that. She'd look for Tony regardless, but Steve's reaction made the matter even more urgent for her.
"Aunt Peggy told me." Just like that, all the air drained from the room. That had to be a lie. It couldn't be his Peggy. She would never betray him like that.
Carol walked into three different sketchy-looking convenience stores before she found one that still had a working payphone. Asking the clerk to break a ten for her – half of it in quarters – she headed over to the phone and punched in Maria's number. It only took three rings for her to pick up.
"You guys take her upstairs," he said addressing Steve and Natasha. They both nodded while Tony turned to Carol. "It's probably best if you don't leave until everything's settled a bit." Carol shrugged but nodded at the same time.
Sorry, this is such a rush job this time. I've got to find a way to keep a baby from rolling off her playmat. Be sure to read and review and all that happy fun stuff!
"You ratted me out," she said overly dramatically. "Seriously?"
"Yeah." Steve rubbed his other hand gently up and down Tony's side. "You're alive. We're all alive. We're safe."
"Ma'am?"
"I can't see how anyone could do it on their own," she said. "I mean, that lab surely has some top-notch equipment, but could they really manufacture something of that level?"
. Everything I do is scrutinized to the nth degree. Every association I make is public knowledge. Every woman I'm seen with, I'm suddenly in a relationship with. I've had people follow me into the bathroom to get my autograph, long before I could even sign my name. That's the kind of magnifying glass I live under and by taking me on as a patient, you've exposed yourself to that. Doesn't that bother you?"
"No," Tony said. "I'd mean them when I say them, but…"
about it.
"I read the questions," Tony said. "I didn't pay attention to who was conducting the interviews." Lara groaned and dropped her face into her hands.
"Uh," Lara said. "The last movie I saw advertised as staring them was back in 2010." She shrugged. "I don't pay attention, though, so they might have been in something since then."
It didn't take long for Steve to locate Tony and the rouge Asgardian. After all, the flashes from Tony's repulsor blasts and the lighting shooting off Thor's hammer put on quite a light show. As soon as he caught up to them he attempted to break up the fight and diffuse the situation. Obviously, Thor didn't take too kindly to that and attempted to strike him with the hammer. Thinking quick on his feet Steve brought the shield up to protect himself and it did protect him from the blow, however, what he didn't account for was the shield vibrating once struck to a chime that was loud enough to break the sound barrier and level half the forest. Well, that was probably good information to pocket for later.
"I think that's an understatement." Steve then unwrapped his burger and took a bite. When he made a strange face, Tony began scanning the room for a waste bin.
"It was the funniest thing I could think of," was the best he could come up with. "And I could use the laugh." Natasha frowned.
Tony's therapy appointment seems to be going well so far, but how is his support team handling the wait? Also, what happened to that explosion Carol caused?
"Will do." Duran offered her hand for Tony to shake. He did so wordlessly and with a nod before following Pepper back towards the executive offices.
"And these kinds of diseases wouldn't be released without their knowledge or say," Bruce concluded.
"Oh, she said softly enough not to wake Tony, but loud enough for Steve to be able to hear her. "You're awake."
"You can tell?" he asked.
"Do you want me to leave, too?" Bruce shook his head.
"Wait, they kissed?" The excitement in Natasha's voice unnerved Tony a little bit.
"That might be a second count of aiding and abetting," he said. "But it's probably not enough to make a difference." Lara muttered a harsh curse under her breath and started pacing the room while Pepper's eyes grew concerned.
Special thanks to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN! It really means a lot! :)
"Lovely," Natasha remarked.
"Hey, I was going to order… Good lord!"
"Excuse me, Mr. Freeman," Natasha said. "But I need to know if you've seen Tony Stark this morning."
"I know," Natasha said. "But let's just be sure."
Loki spotted Thor about to turn the corner. He smirked. This never stopped being funny. Before Thor could turn to investigate the cell, Loki set up an illusion of himself to look like he had just broken. He had already been out for quite several minutes. The only thing he had left to do was take Thor out of the picture. Luckily, the simple illusion did the trick. Thor charged forward at the Loki that was stepping out of the cell, passing right through him and landing on his face. The real Loki hit the button to shut the door. Meanwhile, he sent a second illusion to stand in front of the door to the cell.
He came upon the northwest corner of the building and immediately spotted Oswin. It looked like she had acquired a cart and had stacked the canisters and sealed containers onto it.
"That's never stopped you before," she said. "In fact, isn't that what you have Lara doing right now?"
Tony hoped Steve didn't notice that he winced at the question.
Her second attempt was much better. This time, she managed to get the key in the lock and turn it. She would have jumped for joy if she hadn't been so tired. That victorious feeling waned, however, when she walked in to the apartment to see her husband lying shirtless on the couch with a blanket draped over him, nursing a beer. From the looks of things, he hadn't moved all day. Hell, he probably had spent the entirety of the last two days on that couch, watching whatever came on Channel 2. In any case, Lara was not happy. Nonetheless, she was cordial enough to greet him as she shut the door behind her.
"Certainly." The television then changed from an image of Johnny smiling insanely as he killed the last police officer, to one of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent once again trying to rip the elevator's control panel off the wall. About four other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that Lara could see had joined him as well, likely having come out of the woodworks while Lara was being attacked. She was twice as grateful that she hit the button for the doors when she did.
"Roger that. Over."
"But you will," Tony said. "Because it's not just me who has to go, it's all of us. You heard what Freeman said. The Avengers need to be seen showing support for the American public and the people we failed to protect in New York. All of us must go. Not some of us and certainly not none of us; all of us."
Turning his head to the left, he looked over towards the horizon. Short line of distance. Given this and the dirt that covered the rocky landscape, Loki concluded he was on an asteroid, which in his mind, didn't make sense. Asteroids didn't have breathable air or a strong center of gravity. That was the first sign to Loki that something wasn't right here.
"What?" Hill questioned.
"One and a half," Tony amended. "And we're almost through the day so it's not like it matters."
Voicemail.
"Crimes like what?" Tony asked.
the tapes," Duran said. "I just need to know what's on them."
"Why do you care?" Steve's expression became one of shock.
"No thank you," she said. "I think I've tortured my stomach enough for today." Stark shrugged and took the last sip for himself before glancing at his watch.
The last few steps that he took were to flip the TV to a channel that was nothing but snow and open the door connecting his room to the main hallway, so it was slightly ajar. Now all he had to do was wait.
"You know," Tony said. "The metal wheel that hamsters and mice and rats run around in? Did they not have those in the '40s?"
"You don't know the half of it." They then got their cue to go onstage and the mask of his public persona slid over Tony's face.
"I didn't believe it at first either, and I was the one that
"Oh, a huge difference," Bruce said. "Gamma rays have a shorter wavelength and are more powerful than vita-rays. Just to give you an idea, vita rays can't penetrate anything thicker than a heavy-duty sheet of plastic or vinyl. The only thing that can stop gamma rays is thick layers of concrete and lead."
"The meeting started as soon as all the participants entered the room." Tony looked at him with a mock-betrayed look.
Lara struggled to keep a solid grip on the boxes while she pushed the glass door leading into the penthouse open. The boxes were not exactly heavy, but the weight was distributed rather awkwardly in both, making them a pain to carry. She managed to make it through the door, but she had to put the boxes down and catch her breath afterward. Her bullet-wound scar was not happy with her.
"What the hell," he found himself exclaiming. He rushed to slip the shorts off him, but gravity ended up doing all the work for him. The shorts hit the ground, staying in their solid shape, not even cracking. Thankfully, he had remembered to wear underwear. Stepping out of his new shorts sculpture, Knežević looked around for an explanation for what might have caused this. However, nothing immediately came to him. The only thing that had even touched the shorts were his hands…
"She asked me if we
"When else did you drink that day?" Natasha asked. Tony shrugged.
"Stark tower?" Steve questioned. "That big, ugly…" Tony shot Steve a look. "Building in New York?" That was the best save he could come up with.
"You might be right," she said. "Maybe I do need to know a little bit more."
Lara thought as she set her head down.
"It's not…" Tony sighed, not really having the patience to explain it right now. "Look, just give me the phone for two seconds. I promise I'll give it right back and I'll listen to the rest of this stupid… Oh."
"Hilarious, Romanoff," Tony said. "Left my keys in the house. You wouldn't still happen to have the one I gave you?"
"What was that like, meeting him for the first time?" For the first time since the interview started, Tony felt positive emotions wash over him. Thinking about the first time he saw Steve always made him feel happy (especially when you consider the first thought he had about the guy was
"First of all," she said. "When I said, 'do anything you want,' I wasn't expecting you to operate under the influence and destroy your house. At best, I thought you would take that as encouragement to run off and elope with Pepper. At worst, I was expecting a massive orgy." Stark shook his head.
Steve just stood in the doorway. He wasn't sure what else he was supposed to do. After all, he pretty much got caught red-handed (though, honestly, they weren't doing anything) but his concern for Tony was weighing out his own anxiety on the situation. Tony did not look good. A leper probably looked healthier than he did right now. All morning Steve had been worried for Tony's health and JARVIS announcing that Tony had a 106-degree fever was just the icing on the cake for him.
"I doubt Natasha liked that," he remarked.
The two of them were sat on a bench a few blocks out from Avengers Tower. That's where the building's security and the police had herded them off to, so that's where they sat. On the way to the "safe zone" they saw several trucks pass by that had the logos for both the CDC and S.H.I.E.L.D. That gave them some hints as to what was going on, but no solid ideas. At first, they had been sharing theories and speculating, but somehow that had devolved into playing twenty questions. Despite how strange that was, it at the very least kept their minds off how unbearably freezing cold it was, so at least that was a benefit.
"Why?" Peggy asked. Tony bit his lip. He just couldn't say it. "Are you afraid you'll get in trouble for something?"

"Are you okay?" Maria asked.
"The CDC needs a blood sample," he said. "It's the only way they can determine if you're infected."
knock-off fan film?"
After a night of heavy drinking, Tony disappeared from the hotel they were staying at. The Avengers searched for him, only to learn from Maria Hill that Tony was safe and with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Meanwhile, a still buzzed Tony has made a new friend in Carol Danvers.
"True," Lara said. "But it's on him to take the hand he's offered. People usually don't want to do that." The cold note in her voice didn't go unnoticed.
Remember how I said I'm not a chemist? Yeah, well I'm not a physician either.
"He didn't come back in," Bruce said. "Steve ran out after him."
"Just you," Tony said, shifting closer to Steve. Steve wrapped his arms tighter around him.
"So, does this mean that you're gay or a transvestite now?" Lara knew that was the wrong sort of question to ask someone if you were in that sort of situation. However, she knew he was lying, and she wanted him to knock it off and get a bit of a reaction out of him. "I mean, I'm your wife. I think I have the right to know."
"I'll trust you on that," Lara said. "Oh, by the way, uh, Betty mentioned something about the wedding?" For some reason, that made Bruce feel like a bucket of ice water had been dumped on him.
"Clint?" He could hear Laura's worried tone through the laptop speakers. "What's wrong?"
"And got back together again."
He sighed, fully knowing there was no way he was going to win this argument. Besides, he already promised Steve that he'd be up in a few minutes and honestly, he'd rather cuddle with his boyfriend than try to handle this catastrophe.
"No," he said. "You didn't do anything wrong. I…" He took another deep breath. "I thought I needed to keep my distance around you. I thought if I didn't… If someone noticed how close we were…"
Lara wasn't sure what she was expecting to find when she arrived at Avengers Tower, but it certainly wasn't this amount of chaos. Several groups had meshed and converged on the place. First, there was the media. Although the press conference had ended quite a while ago, they were still hanging around, likely hoping to corner either Tony Stark or one of the Avengers into an interview as they walked in. Similarly, there were the gawkers. They were the people who hung around the Tower hoping to have an encounter with a hero. There were always gawkers but given the excitement of the past couple of days, there was a much higher ratio of them.
"Yeah," Stark said. "That's a fate worse than death."
"Is this the first unshakable headache that you've had?" Tony had to be honest here.
"Why do you even need to leave so badly?" Conroy asked. "Because if you need something done, I can do it for you."
"Good," he said before turning to Carol. "Please, have a seat, Captain Danvers. We'll be with you again momentarily." She nodded.
Adoniram married one of his followers a few years after officially opening his religion to the public, but despite that, he had numerous affairs with several men and women. If his wife, Margot, knew, she certainly didn't seem bothered by it. She remained faithfully by his side through the decades, unlike his followers.
"Well, this is a surprise," she said. "I wasn't expecting to hear from you so soon." Clint saw her push what looked to be a textbook and a notebook to the side, offscreen, confirming that that he was in fact interrupting her study time. A pang of guilt ran through him, even though Laura didn't seem to be bothered in the slightest. "What's up, hot stuff?" Clint cracked a smile.
"Hey, what's today's date?" That first question didn't set off any red flags for Steve. In fact, it was a totally normal question that someone filling out various forms would ask. However, Steve had no idea what the date was. In fact, as far as his internal clock was concerned, it was Wednesday, February 8th, 1945. He knew that was spectacularly wrong, but his brain still hadn't fully adjusted to the fact that sixty-five years had passed him by in less than the time it takes to blink your eyes.
"How'd it go?" Lara asked. Pepper bit her lip and shook her head. "Not good?"
"No." Tony figured he might as well stick by that assertion. He'd already inadvertently dug a hole for himself. It was probably best to try and die in it.
Lara's been getting harassed by her ex-husband, but why exactly is she so afraid of him?
"Hey," Tony said. "You alright?"
"Do you know when he's coming back?" she asked, hopefully.
Keyword:
"But I didn't do anything wrong," Bucky complained.
"I can't blame you," he said. "But I can forgive you." Pepper let out a breath of relief.
"Bus station?" Maria questioned. "Why don't you fly?"
"Sarah…"
"What?" Tony looked at him expectantly.
"No," Pepper said. "What's wrong? Why do you think you're dying?"
As it turned out, the five AM wake up call that Lara had asked the hotel's services for wasn't necessary. She was woken up by the sounds of "Walk Like and Egyptian" coming muffled from the inside of her messenger bag. Worried her brother was having car trouble again, she got up to answer the phone. Looking at the number displayed on the screen, she saw that it had a New York area code. Thinking there was no real harm in seeing who it was, Lara hit the "accept call" button.
Thank you to mfaerie 32 on FFN for the follow and the reviews and shekelash on AO3 for giving kudos! You guys rock! :)
Steve tried with all his might to get his eyes open; to get a word out, but it was useless. The man continued to speak.
"Tony?" she finally said. "What the shit? Let go of my arm!"
"Thanks," she said before she started slowly picking at her sandwich. It was silent for a while before she felt the need to speak up again. "You're not going to ask me what that was about?" Bruce shook his head.
"Is this for the same reason you were upset about the video footage?"
"That doesn't mean I should be enabling it," Steve said. "In fact, I think that makes me a pretty terrible boyfriend for enabling it." Tony scooched back to get a proper look at Steve.
"Let's put it this way," Tony said. "I highly doubt they'll run off and try to create an army of Super Soldiers. Hell, I don't even think they'll take any more than what they need to test it."
"I will, too." Pepper pulled one of the heavy glass doors that lead out into the elevator/stair access point. "See you guys later."
. No one really protested his choice, but Bruce would admit that he had some weird déjà vu-like sense throughout the film. Surprisingly, Clint stayed awake through the whole thing. He was even up for watching a second movie. However, there was a bit more of a dispute this time as Lara and Clint got into an argument about whether
"Alright," he said to Pepper before turning to Happy. "Can you take her to one of the guest rooms?" He gestured to Lara. "I doubt she can get herself home like this."
"Music?" Steve questioned.
(See the end of the chapter for
"…After I've gotten a chance to talk to Mr. Stark about it," she said. "Is that okay with you?" DeMarcus shrugged.
"And dated," Betty added.
"Oh no, buddy," the officer said. "You're not going anywhere but out."
"Tell me about them." Subarian hesitated, mostly out of fear. "Tell me!"
Despite having no clue how to go about re-warming Rogers' body, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team did do everything they could think of to keep him alive. On the way there they followed the standard first-aid protocol for treating someone with hypothermia (getting the person out of the cold, removing wet clothing, covering the person with blankets or towels, etc.), and once they had arrived the staff at the medical center treated him as though he had a very severe hypothermic case. It was the bare minimum that could be done for him at least. So far it seemed to be helping. Well, really it wasn't affecting anything, but it wasn't making Rogers' condition worse either, so technically it was neither a hinderance nor a help. Still, it was better than nothing.
was the only one they could look to.
"Alright," he said. "Thank you." Drew nodded and looked down.
"Director Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.," he said before pointing his thumb at the woman next to him. "This is Commander Maria Hill. We showed our credentials to the woman at the front desk."
Shortly after that, the event ended. There were no more disruptions and no more bizarre questions. Everyone else just had normal, respectful questions for all of them and they were able to end it without any walk-outs. Once they said all their goodbyes and thanks, the five of them walked off the stage, only stopping to allow crew members to remove their microphones. Tony was impatient and ripped the thing off halfway through the removal process. He needed to get some air and a drink.
"What's your first name?" Steve countered.
He checked his phone for the zillionth time that day. He only turned it off when he was driving because he really didn't need that distraction with his head as fogged as it was. However, he still had no new calls or messages.
"If I did, we would all be dead right now." Alright, Lara did have to give him that one. It was a good point. "Listen, it's probably not as bad as you think. Tony is drunk after all. Chances are he won't remember any of this tomorrow." Lara took a deep breath and slowly nodded in agreement.
"That I did know," Pepper said.
Without another word, she followed Bruce out the door and left the room. Slowly, Steve started heading for the door as well. Tony felt a wave of panic go through him as Steve set one foot over the threshold.
" Jessica squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath before she took off sprinting down the street. Already, she could feel a headache coming on.
"What are we?" Steve's eyebrows knitted together, but he didn't attempt to open his eyes or pull away.
After their first meeting and disastrous first date (which was ultimately his own fault for pushing everything else in his life to the side to chase after a hot guy fifty years his senior) Tony and Steve had kept in contact via phone calls and later text messaging once Steve had learned to use a cell phone. (A 2007 Blackberry, but an actual working cell phone nonetheless.) Tony would admit he felt attracted to Steve the moment he saw him, but once he started talking to him, Tony found that he liked him. He
"But it made perfect sense for you," Happy said. "At least, back when…" Steve nodded and cut him off before he could say any more.
This wasn't where he wanted to be. Just hours ago he was the sitting Regent of Asgard with his "brother" banished and his "father" deep in the Odinsleep. There was no one that could stand in his way. Sif and the Warriors Three? Mere child's play. Sure, they were the fiercest warriors in the realm, but they fought mostly relying on their brute strength. Loki had watched them for years. He knew all their weak points and was certain with his agility and mastery of magic he'd be able to beat them easily. Once he "saved" his "father" from being killed by Laufey, Loki would erase Jotunheim from the entirety of the Nine Realms and rule Asgard as he should forevermore.
"You're kidding me…" Carol stepped closer and hit a button to make the results appear holographic.
"My God," Pepper said as she took one of the papers from Steve. "This is really good."
"Yeah, what's going on?" Tony looked through the glass to see if anyone was coming. "JARVIS tells me we're under code blue and I pull up and there are all of these police cars…"
Steve took a deep breath and tried to do what Natasha said, but found it hard. It didn't help when they heard an overly cheerful voice come from behind them.
"Who?"
"Now, now," Tony said. "Don't speak ill of the dead."
he thought to himself.
"Sexy!" Lara exclaimed. "Those workmen were sexy and you know it!"
"The one where they see you and they just know," Stark said.
"Probably," Stark said. "But I'm afraid if I kill myself now, my ghost would be doomed to haunt this room without entertainment forevermore."
"Yes, ma'am," Bucky replied obediently.
Remember kids, if God tells you to kill people, you're most certainly not crazy and should go ahead and carry out vigilante justice in one of the most gentrified neighborhoods in one of the most gentrified cities in the world with the exception of Dorchester. That part of Boston is still largely segregated, sadly.
"Okay," he finally heard Oswin say. "I'm in the building, I'm behind the front desk, and I'm looking at a map. Where should I go?"
Several minutes and a few wrong turns later, Natasha felt she had a decent handle on the controls. She was making her way up Park, slowly ascending towards the top of Stark Tower when a blast whooshed by her head. Natasha turned to get a glance at the bogie on her tail.
"Trust me," she said. "There are much scarier things in this world than the Hulk." With that, she turned the knob and stepped out into the world. However, she couldn't help but add one thing over her shoulder. "By the way, it was Dwayne Johnson I was thinking of."
Voicemail.
"Hot damn." Lara tapped the screen to give more information. "Well isn't that convenient? He was just caught on surveillance in…"
The news had given some helpful insight as to the scene they'd be walking into. Although none of the news media could tell what was going on inside of the building, they were able to confirm that the police had everything from East 53rd Street to East 34th street blocked off and Park Avenue was almost completely shut down. Good thing the New York Police Department was taking his warnings seriously. He couldn't imagine how bad the loss of life would be if they didn't start getting people out now. As he got closer to the building, he heard JARVIS' voice speak up once again.
"Okay," Steve said, matching Tony's heavy-hearted tone. "Have you had anything to eat yet?"
Thinking fast, Lara found the gap between the door and the stall and ran her fingers up and down it until she found the lock. She yanked it back and pulled the door open, but unfortunately, that was as far as she made it. The movement was too much for her and she ended up falling. The last thing she could remember was pain blooming across her cheek and chin as she hit the floor, and the distant sound of someone screaming.
"Pepper, I'm fine," Tony said. "And I promise I've learned my lesson. The second I'm not feeling fine, I'll tell you."
"Look me in the eye and say that." Dante didn't make eye contact and he didn't speak up. "Yeah, that's what I thought. Goodbye."
"Put on the suit." Tony could feel the adrenaline coursing through him, urging him to surge forward. However, before he could do anything, the ship suddenly and violently lurched from side to side.
"Yes!"
He was failing to do that, though. In fact, he was failing to push aside the feelings of pain and tiredness that were plaguing him. The nausea eventually settled down once he had been sitting for a few minutes, but his head was still flaring up with sparks of pain and he wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and go back to sleep. However, that wasn't an option now, so Tony fought against it all.
"Enjoying the moment," he said.
"Knežević," she amended. "I'm sorry but this is clearly not a suitable home for two children to be living in."
"I'm sure," he said. "As long as you're safe, okay, and in my arms, I'll always be good." Tony felt a deep twinge in his heart that was like nothing he ever felt before.
"About the dog?" Clint asked.
"Live news feed," Tony explained. "Police have been called to the tower."
"I asked Agent Romanoff about a line of redacted text in your S.H.I.E.L.D. file." Instantly, Tony knew where this was going, but he didn't stop Steve from continuing. "She said it 'probably had to do with a gay sex tape from 1995.' I have no idea what any of that means, other than your gay and S.H.I.E.L.D. knows it."
"Uh, yeah…" Oswin tried to think. "I think it's just one exit down on the motorway. Why?"
"There's two boxes," Lara said. "I left them in the hallway. I couldn't carry them all the way here."
"Get under the covers," he said.
, but somehow Tony had a feeling that wasn't her name.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know you're not going to like hearing this," Natasha said. "But S.H.I.E.L.D. can help."
"We won." Tony let out a sigh of relief.
"Honestly, not at all," he admitted. "The only time I met her before now was when she saved my drunk ass from freezing to death. Why? What's wrong?"
"It's perfect," Knežević said, taking the computer from her. "What happens if I click this bold, blue…"
"Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me." Despite how angry he was, Tony had to admit that he was starting to get a little bit turned on. He found his eyes starting to scan Steve's body…
"Alright, yay!" he said. "Can I have a redo on the celebratory kiss, though? You were great, but my lips were chapped, and I wasn't really expecting it… Just saying I could've done better. Good job, everyone, though. I… I think we've really earned taking the rest of the day off. What do you think? Have you guys ever tried shawarma? I don't know what it is but I want to try it." Steve couldn't help it, he broke out into a full-blown grin as Tony continued to ramble on in a shocked response to what had just almost happened to him. He wanted to pull him in close and give him another kiss, but for the moment he just settled for being grateful he had a Tony to kiss at all.
good…"

"Either way, we need to start moving now," Natasha said. "We don't know how fast-acting this thing is. We could start showing symptoms before we even make it down there."
Freeman looked like a nervous wreck. He sat in his chair with his legs set apart and his hands clasped together. His gaze was directed down at the ground and Lara could have sworn she saw beads of sweat running down his bald head. While she might not be a PR "expert," she also wasn't an idiot. She knew that was only serving to make Stark Industries – and by extension, the Avengers – look bad. She was relieved when the camera zoomed in to get a tighter shot on the S.H.I.E.L.D. representative, thereby taking Freeman out of the frame. Now, the public wouldn't have to bear witness to that embarrassment.
"I should be apologizing to you Steve," Pepper said. "I didn't mean to scare you with the questions I was asking. I just wanted to make sure that you and Tony were safe."
He hadn't told Tony about his crush yet. Even though he knew Tony was bisexual as well, but he didn't think he'd return his feelings. He did come close, though. The week before Tony stayed over at his new apartment in Brooklyn since he didn't feel entirely safe staying in his unfinished penthouse during Hurricane Irene (even though he had already completely sealed off the exterior windows which were built to hold up against sustained wind speeds of almost three-hundred miles per hour, as JARVIS had informed them from Tony's phone.) It went well. They had pizza and tried to watch some movie Steve couldn't remember the title or the plot of before the power went out. Tony offered to go outside in his suit to try and fix the powerlines (or, even better, hook Steve's building up with Arc Reactor technology so that way the power would never go out again), but Steve managed to talk him into going to bed early. That's when Steve almost crossed over the point of no return.
"Alright," he said. "I'll help him get back to his room."
"Don't worry about it," he said. "I probably won't be going in either." Lara gave another nod, this one surer.
"I guess," Bruce agreed.
"It's a long story," she said.
"Said the pot to the kettle." Dante sat up and narrowed his eyes at her.
Again, Freeman was making it clear that none of the scenarios they were discussing were likely to happen, but Lara seemed a little jumpy. Apparently, Tony wasn't the only one Everhart gave the third degree to. Apparently, she went hard on Bruce, Barton, and Romanoff too. Steve was the only one who got the easy treatment, but that was probably only because Everhart doubted, she could get anything controversial out of Captain America. Oh, if only she knew.
"What's wrong?" Tony turned to look behind him and saw Steve and Natasha approaching him. "Did you forget the super-secret password?" Tony rolled his eyes.
Unphased, and mostly for his own amusement, Loki said: "I'm listening." He then turned and moved to sit at the edge of the cliff. From his perch, he could clearly get a good look at the scuffle that was about to take place between his "brother" and the "Iron Man". This worked out perfectly for him. He knew Thor's fighting style like the back of his hand, but this would give him a chance to watch the one they called "Stark" in action.
"Oh, most definitely," Tony said. "But you still deserve some credit."
"What's the story upstairs?" Steve asked as he, Clint, and Natasha approached Thor.
"Yes," Steve said. "Mostly when I'm right."
"I thought you weren't going to drink." Tony sighed.
The agents made quick work of the locks and allowed Tony to go inside. The door shut behind him and he heard one of the locks slide into place. Only one, though.
"We ordered shawarma from the restaurant down the street," Natasha explained, and Pepper crinkled her nose.
Tony raised an eyebrow. Those weren't the words he was expecting. He turned over onto his side to face Steve and saw that his boyfriend was just as close to tears as he was.
"I'll be alright," he said. "Don't worry." Steve still looked hesitant. "Just trust me, okay?"
"Fair enough," Coulson relented. "I'll tell that to Director Fury."
"Do I want to know about that?" he asked.
"Oh, okay." The nurse let out a huge breath of relief. "Sorry, I always ask. You never know how people are going to react."
"What happened?" was the first question out of his mouth. Steve frowned.
"Goodnight, Tony." They drifted off after that, both feeling warm, comfortable, and most importantly of all, overjoyed. Even with everything that had happened over the past few days, both were just happy to have found a moment of solace in each other, however fleeting it might be in the grand scheme of things.
"Yeah," she said. "I'm fine. I can go on." The officer still looked at her skeptically but nodded anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes."
The image made Tony sick. Barton looked terrible. In addition to the intubation, he had many IVs and wires attached to him. He was very pale, and a pained expression was clear on what Tony could see of his face. The worst part of it was that Barton was all alone. He had no one there to comfort him, or at the very least show support for him.
"We're still too far from that," Rhodey said. "Unless it was something catastrophic, we shouldn't be feeling it."
"So, four months ago," Carol said. "Has he checked in with S.H.I.E.L.D. since then?"
After a very eventful couple of days, Steve and Tony return to Avengers Tower to get some rest.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I think I'd be more likely to throw up if I suddenly started smelling a chem lab fire. …But thanks for the heads up." The last part added quietly, but Bruce still heard it and nodded in acknowledgment.
"Oh," Steve said. "So, what do you do instead?"
"Right away, Sir." The call-in-progress screen then popped up. Tony brought the phone to his ear and waited for the call to connect. As he did so, he walked up to the front entrance and tried to open the door. It remained stiffly in place. At that point, a kid who looked too young to be wearing an LAPD uniform ran up to him.
"What about you two?" Hill turned her gaze to Clint and Natasha.
"So, is there anything I missed out on at dinner with everyone else?" he asked as he began to scoop up another forkful of pasta.
wouldn't be able to do it. So, I feel confident in saying that we haven't been hacked. Besides, I think there would have been more than a few chemicals stolen from our lab if it was a data breach of that level. Don't you agree?"
"Should we do one of those things you see on TV?" Clint asked. "You know, where they hold a meeting in someone's living room, confront them about the negative consequences of their addiction, and then force them to go to rehab." Lara immediately looked apprehensive.
"Security is down there now." Dr. Griffith kept his voice calm and neutral, hoping it would help diffuse the situation. "They're sealing off the labs as a crime scene. LAPD is in route."
"But will we still be able to do this?" Margot asked. "Be close?" Adoniram stood up and cupped her face in his hand.
This time Loki was thankful for the screeching noise that took the thought away.
"Ma'am, I understand this is hard for you," he said.
They knew Tony didn't have his hacked hotel key on him. He couldn't get into anyone else's room unless they let him in. For Steve's sake, they weren't going to entertain the possibility of a kidnapping until they had ruled everything else out and Steve was thankful for it. After all, panicking as he did wasn't fun for him either. They mostly walked the halls – Clint and Bruce going one direction, and Steve and Natasha going the other – looking for anything out of place or odd that might give them some indication of where Tony had gone. Inevitably, though, the two groups ended up running into each other with none of them having anything to show for their efforts.
"Hit me," she said, pushing her glass forward. Stark nodded and complied, filling his own glass as well. Natasha threw hers back hard and fast, giving her indigestion pains in her chest. She put a hand over her sternum as she looked Stark right in the eyes. "How do I get you to believe me?" she asked. "Please, just tell me. The team needs you to forgive me. I need you to forgive me So please, just tell me how to earn that.
"Why do you care?" he asked.
Once the call was over, Clint set the computer down on his nightstand and pulled out his phone to text Natasha. He told her he was awake and asked for something to eat. Then, all he had to do was wait and hope that she wouldn't be too mad that he had gotten out of bed.
"How…" He struggled to force the words out. "How do you know that?"
"No," Hill reiterated. "Stark, you are a civilian, not a trained agent. I'm not going to jeopardize your safety by locking you in a room with a potentially combative enhanced individual."
feel bad for Michael Jackson," Lara said. "For goodness' sake the guy was at the
Bruce looked back again to make sure he was not mistaken. He was expecting to see her distressed in some way. He figured the laugh was ironic or something but looking at her face he realized it was genuine. Whatever response she got on her phone, she found it funny. That came as a relief to him. It was the first time he had seen her as anything resembling happy in days. It was good to see.
"Yeah," Lara said. "They're harmless for the most part; just extremely annoying."
"It's empty," Tony said. "At least, I think it is."
"That won't be necessary, ma'am." Carol had never been happier to see Nick Fury and Maria Hill than she was in that moment. Fury's naturally imposing figure had Amanda shrinking back a bit. Somehow, though, she was still brave enough to speak.
They hadn't said everything that needed to be said, but it was a start. The start of what, Tony wasn't sure, but it was enough for now. They could hold each other in silence and be at peace. After the morning they had, they deserved it.
"Hey Bruce," she said. "What's up." Bruce shrugged.
"So," he said. "You're Steve Rogers… Or, supposedly you are. I wouldn't put it past S.H.I.E.L.D. to lie to me. They have in the past and I'm sure they will again, but that's a spy agency for you. I should have expected that. I must admit; this whole scenario goes well beyond reasonable belief. I mean, come on, a person surviving sixty-five years frozen in ice? Even if he is a genetically-altered super-soldier, that just doesn't happen. That shouldn't be possible. Maybe I just need to change my definition of possible. God, I remember my dad and Aunt Peggy telling stories about you…"
"Hey, Nat, wait up," he said, but Natasha did not slow down as she flung the door open.
"No," Tony did his best to push against Steve. Although Steve had the strength advantage, he didn't want to hurt Tony and struggled to find a balance. "I want to go home. I
"No," he said. "I'm fine staying up here."
As soon as he was out the door, Steve immediately felt more relaxed. Once again, another emotional reaction he couldn't explain. He remembered once when he was small – maybe three, four years old – there was an exhaust leak in his and his mother's apartment and it was almost too late before his mother realized what was wrong, opened windows, and got them both outside. He couldn't remember any of the whys and hows of what happened (he supposed he never learned the cause seeing as the serum gave him a retroactively eidetic memory) but he remembered clearly the feeling of relief once he got outside and started breathing clean air. Stepping out of that room was a lot like that, only instead of carbon monoxide, it was anger and tension poisoning that room. He could still feel it somewhat once he stepped outside, it was a lot less than what he was feeling in the moment. Steve slowly took several deep breaths.
"Neither can I," Carol agreed. "Just be more careful with your phone next time, will you?"
"Early bird gets the worm," Lara said.
"Uh…" Bruce didn't even look up from his computer, clearly not wanting to get involved. "I just want to finish my work here and…"
Flash!
"Alright, I have paper in front of me right now," Charles explained. "And in my left hand, there's a pen. If I asked you a more detailed question, would you be able to take control of my hand and write down your answer?" Marx gave a curt nod and Charles found himself pulling his hand away from the shard and looked down at the paper in front of him. Written in his neat, cursive handwriting at the top of the page was a simple question: "What would you like to know?"
"Oh God, no," Tony said. "I'm not doing rehab. …In-person rehab at least. You could not pay me enough to do that. Besides, it is not like it is really feasible for me. I mean, if something happens, I would not be able to do anything as Iron Man. Also, the press would probably have a field day with it…"
"How is he?" Tony looked up at Natasha. She was standing behind Steve and hadn't dropped the look of concern.
"He still has a job?" Pepper winced a bit.
Taking a deep breath in preparation, Steve explained his concerns with the mental health system. He started with how homosexuality was viewed in the forties and used that to explain how he feared someone would try to harm Tony using his sexuality or mental status as justification. When the same assurances he'd heard before came out of Pepper and Rhodey's mouths, Steve became frustrated and blurted out what he was afraid of.
"Wouldn't expect nothing less." Though, admittedly Tony was a little let down. Pepper was the only ride he had back to Malibu. He still had the clothes he came in with, so that wasn't an issue. He just really didn't want to wait for a cab. Seeing as he had no other choice, Tony just sucked it up and put his pants on. Once he had that done, he pulled the hospital gown over his head – not bothering to untie the ties – and slipped his undershirt and white button-up back on.
"Follow us down a few floors then report back to your designated duty station," Fury told the agent. "Understood?"
"I'm going to patch you through to the City of Malibu's 911 center," the woman explained. "Just explain the situation to them as calmly and rationally as you can and give them updates on the injured party's condition, as necessary."
"Wow," Tony said once Steve left. "Sometimes I can't help but think 'Really? That's the guy my dad never shut up about?'" Honestly, Tony truly had that thought a few times, but it was never filled with as much agitation as he was feeling at that moment. He wasn't sure why he felt that way, but sleep deprivation probably had something to do with it.
"I'll manage."
"And broke up."
"I probably shouldn't stay the night," Lara said. "I have really bad nightmares a lot of the time and that would probably make an already stressful situation worse."
Oh wait, I did find something meaningful to say; I'm still not going to write outright smut. Sorry.
The room fell silent. Tony and Hill kept their hard gazes on each other. Tony was seconds away from giving up the fight when someone spoke up; the woman who handed Tony her tablet before.
"No!" Steve's mother's eyes went wide at the outburst. "No, please don't."
"Then what's behind the door?"
What still wasn't clear though was the connection to Winnifred "Oswin" Oswald. There were many reasons to just write off the happenstance of her house being blown up off as a coincidence – the most outstanding one being that Oswin was illegally squatting in the building. It very easily could be that Knežević had forced her out of the home, or worse killed her, and no one would be the wiser.
"Tony, I'm not being mean," Steve said. "You're drunk."
"Good, good," Tony nodded, reflecting Steve's smile.
He couldn't find the person that the bartender saw Tony talking with, but Steve did find several people who had encountered Tony. Some of them didn't notice anything wrong with Tony at all. Some of them described his behavior as odd, but nothing too alarming. Others described him as being inattentive and wobbly on his feet, and a few expressed genuine concerns for him. All of them ended up telling Steve the exact same thing: "He was here a moment ago. You just missed him."
"I'm fine," he failed to assure.
"It is ten o'clock in the morning, Sir." That wasn't as bad as he'd thought it'd be. Although, that meant he only got five hours of sleep, but at least he didn't sleep until some ridiculous hour like two in the afternoon again. That enabled Tony to move on to his next order of business.
"I'm fine," he assured before turning to Natasha. "You?" She gave a quick nod.
"You are forgiven," he said begrudgingly. "Just don't let it happen again." Freeman straightened up and nodded.
"Well, you two pick a side and settle in," he said. "All that we ask is that you don't switch sides or try to move the vinyl sheeting while you're in here. We're trying to avoid cross-contamination as much as possible."
"And then there's that guy," he said.
"Alright," Steve said, holding out his arm. "Go ahead."
Tony agreed, glancing towards the door. Although the appointment wasn't as bad as he built it up to be in his head, he was still relieved it was over; especially now since what Cranston said had been right. He honestly did want to get out there and find out what was going on and if this was an Avengers-level problem.
"A hero?" Tony questioned. "Like you? You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle." Steve's face remained impassive.
Again, Carol was thrown off enough that her powers flickered out for a few seconds, providing Alpha with the opportunity she needed to force her down to the ground. Before she could position herself to properly pin Carol down, though, Carol kicked Alpha square in the chest. At the same time, she fired an energy blast at Beta, who did her best to block it with her concrete fist. It clearly still caused her pain, but it did not knock her back as much as Carol would have liked. Still, the distraction was enough for Carol to at least get back on her feet in time to block a punch Beta had tried to direct at her face.
Once that was taken care of, everyone went about taking their food and migrating out into the lounge. Well, everyone except one person. Tony quickly took notice that Natasha was hanging back with her eyes fixated on him. Taking the bait, Tony waited until the last person moved out into the lounge before approaching her.
She hit the button to turn off the phone's screen and slipped the device back into her pocket. With nothing left to do but wait for the two nymphomaniacs to finish their mating ritual, Lara shut her eyes and leaned back against the wall, once again willing "I Want You to Want Me" to drown out the psychologically scarring sounds.
"Stark, what is this?" The volume of the feed dimmed a bit as Natasha's voice came through the comms.
"You'll see why when you get down there," Tony said. "Just listen and do what they tell you. Also, watch your step." Lara still looked confused, but nodded nonetheless.
(See the end of the chapter for
Voicemail.
"It was," Natasha said.
"You lack conviction." Loki's face fell.
"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "As long as I get my phone, I'll have everything I need."
"How is this not a suitable home?" Knežević gestured to the rather spacious ranch-style house behind him. "Everything's clean, they have their own rooms, they're always fed and clothed, I make sure Audrey gets to school on time and does her homework…"
"28 Konigstrasse, Stuttgart, Germany," Tony finished for her. "I've got to go." Before Lara could say anything he headed off to the suit assembly station out on the exterior balcony. He stepped on to the platform and the machines around him came to life, locking and screwing everything into its proper place. Lara caught up to him then.
," Bruce emphasized. "Hopefully, he won't."
"Looks like you can do more than just blast stuff," Tony remarked. Carol smiled and nodded.
"Glass stings?" Lara questioned, opening one eye enough to adequately show off her skepticism.
"Pepper went to give Clint and Natasha the tour," Steve said. "And I think Banner went to unpack."
"No, not yet." Tony's face fell a tiny bit as he touched down on the landing pad that led back into the tower's penthouse. "It's only 7:54. I'm sure he'll turn up soon."
"Well, I was almost dead five days ago," Clint said. "So, I would say I'm doing better."
"You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark." Pepper laughed while Lara's eyebrows came together in confusion. "Can you please leave a message?"
"Good," Steve said.
"Right here!" Tony and Steve turned to see Barton coming up behind them with his hand raised. From a few curtains down, Romanoff also emerged to view the unfolding scene.
"Lara!"
It was then that Tony noticed that the holographic screen was still up. Knowing that JARVIS would still run the scans even if the screen wasn't up, Tony swiped the screen away, turning it off.
"I am being realistic," Steve said. "You can do this. You're strong, and even if you're not I'm right here. I'll do anything and everything in my power to help you, Tony."
At some point, the staff had noticed a pattern in the way the more obtrusive askers were dressed and began to question anyone in line for the microphone wearing all-white clothing. Quite a few were found to be suspicious and extracted from the line before they could ask their question. That didn't stop them from causing a ruckus as they were being led out, though. However, there were still a few who seemed to be dressed normally – wearing a few different colors and not just all white – that came up and asked a few bizarre questions, most of which revolving around the Battle of New York and why they put a stop to it. They declined to answer every time they managed to slip through, though. After all, what else did they expect them to say? Lives were at stake, of course, they were going to put a stop to it. Hopefully, all the normal people in the room realized that.
"No!" Thor screamed from inside the cell. Loki pulled the scepter out of Coulson's torso, allowing the man to fall to the ground. The illusionary image disappeared as Loki strode over to the control panel. His brother gave him a look of utter disgust and disdain. Loki didn't let that phase him as he hit the button to open the airlock and drop the cage thousands of feet to the ground.
"Excuse me, miss," The woman looked up as Nina jogged over and came to a stop in front of her. "Are you the police?"
"So, it's not just her?" Natasha frowned.
Natasha carefully shot the door behind her as she followed Stark back to his office. She remained silent, pressing her back against the wall while Stark sat down in his office chair and brought a hand up to his forehead. For her part, Nat did not feel all that offended about the things that were said about her during the board meeting. She did not care and had been called much worse before. However, she was feeling slightly shocked, particularly at the way the board had treated Stark and Pepper.
It was silent for a while, something unusual for both girls. Nina could barely taste the tea or the breakfast pastry as she swallowed bite and sip after bite and sip. Eventually, Oswin's voice cut like a knife through the tension.
A door then opened, shut, and locked. Steve tried to fight off sleep if possible, but unfortunately, it was a foe that even Captain America couldn't beat. He eventually shut his eyes and let the darkness claim him again.

"I'm glad," she said.
"Thank you," Lara said gratefully.
Clint chose that exact moment to push open the closet door slightly and fall lifelessly to the ground. Stark and Lara screamed at the top of their lungs. Clint kept himself from laughing by reminding himself that he was going to be the one to clean the KY jelly/blood off the walls.
"Who can disclose that information?"
"A higher form?" Steve questioned.
"Up and at 'em, Sleeping Beauty," she said instead, shaking his foot. "We have a guest." Clint peeled open his eyes and sat up, letting out a yawn as he did so.
"Oh, hey Bethany," Lara said. "What's up?"
"Alright," she said. "Talk."
"Holy shit." Nina felt a cold ball of ice forming in the pit of her stomach. "Which house was it?"
"Oh, you know, the usual," she said. "Bright lights, big city, big chances at big scores… Why I stayed, though is the more interesting story."
"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother," Thor said. "A throne would suit you ill." Loki growled, shoved Thor as he passed him, and climbed back up to the top of the cliff they were standing on.
"Will it kill me to eat that?" she asked.
The Battle is over, and now things are settling down for the Avengers! Time for some much-needed rest...
"I must admit," he said. "This whole scenario goes well beyond reasonable belief. I mean, come on, a person surviving sixty-five years frozen in ice? Even if he is a genetically-altered super-soldier, that just doesn't happen."
The round of applause that followed was surprising. Before Tony could see how many people could be in the theater, he would have sworn it was close to a thousand. The theater only seated two-hundred fifty people, give or take. Given the prying and semi-accusatory questions he'd been facing throughout the day, this warm welcome felt nice, reassuring a bit. So, reassuring, in fact, that he almost didn't notice that Joe the presenter was going up to each of them and shaking their hands. It wasn't until the guy had gone up to Steve that he took notice and pulled himself out of his trance. After the guy shook his hand, Tony found himself looking over at Steve and smiling for just the briefest of moments. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that he got a smile back.
"Is there anything else I can do for you, dear?" Tony shook his head.
"No!" Lara shrilly screamed as she rushed forward, presumably to stop Stark. "Don't touch anything! Let's just get out of here! We need to call 911
Tony immediately bolted upright, his breaths coming in fast-paced and ragged. Wherever he was it was dark, too dark, but he still had to be alive because he could still see the glow of the Arc Reactor coming from his chest. At least, that's what he told himself. Further proof that he was still alive came when he heard a sharp click behind him and a bright light filled the room.
"Then why did you poison him?" Carol asked.
"You're welcome." Tony could only shake his head at her obliviousness. Pepper, meanwhile, gave him a concerned look.
Remember kids, I'm a human with learning disabilities and executive dysfunction, and I can only write so fast!
"I hate you," he said.
"Put on the suit," he said. "Let's go a few rounds." Once again, dirty thoughts started outweighing Tony's anger, but he was able to keep in check. He kept his eyes locked on Steve, challenging him to do something about it. He was only distracted by Thor's sudden burst of laughter.
"I know," Tony said. "But this feels like one of those times I should be supportive. Also, I want to." Steve gave Tony a small smile and a squeeze of his hand. Tony returned it in kind.
"Howard tell you that story?" Steve asked.
"Well, there are some minor fees that would need to be assessed…" Lara stood up.
"Eh," Tony groaned as he took the seat next to Steve. "Long, arduous, tiring, boring; all would be pretty apt descriptions for today."
"Simple…" Tony listened to a hum that reverberated throughout Steve's body. "What's your favorite color?" Tony laughed. He couldn't help it. Of all the simple questions in the world, that one had to be the simplest. Nonetheless, Tony still answered it in a completely genuine manner.
"I'll take it!" Natasha laughed.
"Jesus, Clint," she said. "Do you actually have a death wish? Because I swear to God if you died for this dog…" Steve let up on Clint and offered a hand to help him to his feet.
"On September 4th, 2011, Mr. Stark – along with the Avengers – committed some of the most egregious acts against mankind. They put an end to us fated day of reckoning and in the process, thousands were injured, and countless lives were lost. The Avengers have not admitted any wrongdoing in their actions that day, nor have they taken responsibility for any of the casualties incurred. It is for this reason that I…"
"He's missing," Steve said, his voice catching a little bit. Freeman seemed unaffected though.
"Cruel and unusual punishment," Clint added.
That's when his mind drifted to the neatly folded pieces of paper in his pocket. While he had no access to any hazardous chemicals from behind bars, he did have access to several books on the subject and he read every single one he could get his hands on as many times as he could. He took notes and studied them almost religiously. He now knew exactly how certain chemicals reacted with each other and how; which ones ended in good results and which ones ended in a horrific explosion. Through his research, he believed to have discovered a new type of chemical compound not yet being utilized for any known purpose. It was all right there in those notes. He just needed proof that this compound was viable in practice, not just theory.
"I don't understand," Steve said. "What do you mean? Am I afraid of what?"
"What exactly did they hold objection with?" Lara asked.
"Cautious is my middle name," Natasha corrected. "It'd have to be, otherwise I'd be constantly nursing stab wounds."
"This is the Hub. We are reading you loud and clear Alfa-Niner. What is your status? Over."
"That's illegal," he pointed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Congratulations, you get a gold star." Unfortunately, the helmet snapped over Tony's head at that moment, so Lara couldn't see him roll his eyes. "Well, is there anything else you need me to do?"
"You know, I can fire you for insubordination." Lara rolled her eyes as she sat back down.
That was disrupted by the sound of Natasha shouting "for God's sake, Clint! Don't run!" Realizing that time was up, Tony pressed a quick, chaste kiss to Steve's lips before moving to settle back into his own chair. Seconds later, Clint appeared in the doorway, standing on his two feet and panting way more than he probably should have been.
"It was messed up," Natasha agreed.
Tony was still somewhat concerned that Steve sounded somewhat cold and annoyed, but at least he got something out of him. Granted, Tony was the one who told Steve not to speak to him on the Quinjet, but suddenly, he just got really frustrated with the fact that Steve was seemingly giving him the silent treatment. He had no idea why he just felt all his stress and anger spike at the sight of him. Well, at the sight of everyone, really, but mostly just Steve.
"Uh, yeah," he said. "Sorry about that. …But congratulations, though, on the wedding."
Tony looked down again. Honestly, it was a good idea, but there was some underlying level of resistance that he just could not ignore. It kept eating away at him, creating a deep dark feeling of apprehension deep inside his soul; like he knew he should not do it, it was wrong. It took everything in him to override that thought; to take a deep breath and finally say, "Conroy, can you take those boxes upstairs?"
"Steve, the only reason why she told me…" Tony was forced to stop mid-sentence as the elevator doors opened back up to the lobby and a very familiar face. Her red hair was much shorter than it was three months ago, but he'd recognize the assessing look in those green eyes anywhere. "Miss Rushman," he said. "I thought I fired you."
Speaking of recoveries, Tony wasn't surprised to hear from his doctor that a compatible donor match had been found. It was rare for a bone-marrow match to be found between two people that weren't related, and even rarer considering Tony's blood type, but somehow it had been done and Tony couldn't help but think that "somehow" went by the name of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division. Well, if S.H.I.E.L.D. could be relied upon for anything, it's that they'd save your life and then act like complete dictators about it afterwards. He'd write a strongly-worded letter to their HR department, but he highly doubted they even had one. Either way, they were just waiting for the strep infection to clear up and Tony to get his strength back before they went through with any procedures.
