John pressed in his digit and pulled out slowly, surprised at how tight and warm the space actually was. He could not imagine such a feeling wrapped around his aching cock but just trying to sent shocks of arousal up his spine.
Sherlock looked distant, as if he were back in that time watching his brother slowly wither to nothing.
Sherlock stepped into the kitchen and saw that some of the plates were broken.
“As you wish, John. I am weary, and I shall retire now, if you do not wish to join me, you do not have to. I will, however, leave my door ajar so that you may join me, whenever that may be.”
Happy Holidays from myself and Chanolay!
“I will create my Vitruvian Man.”
Sherlock fumbled to button up his shirt. He could feel their eyes on him, looking on in disgust - Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, and all the snot-nosed brats from his childhood.
When they were both inside of the carriage, the driver immediately set off and John stared out the window forlornly at the sight of his dear Baker Street growing smaller and smaller behind them. It would be cold and empty, and for what reason John had not a clue. Sherlock grabbed his hand, and though both men wore gloves, the intimacy was there. Sherlock offered a smile and John returned it.
“You’ve read those books quite often?”
She smiled cheekily and squeezed his arm. “Hush, do not thank me. I am merely your caretaker.”
“Oh. While I was exploring the Swiss scenery, I came across a surprise.”
John nodded frantically, taking his hard cock in hand and passing his slicked hand over it. He had to add a little more but with the addition of his precome, John was ready. He brought the head of his cock to Sherlock’s slick entrance, lining up and beginning to push. It was a wonder to watch it disappear inside his lover but the sensation was unlike anything else. “Oh, bloody hell. Sherlock!” John gasped, unable to process such warmth and constriction around his member.
“John, how would you feel about going on holiday?”
“What of his bedroom? Has it been disturbed?”
We felt that having Sherlock and John write journal entries for this chapter was nice because it gives us their POV on the same situation which is hard to do as a writer most times. We hope you feel the same way we do!
“Do what?”
“Over £50!”
“The words I say ring true, John.” He tried miserably to retain his composure although he cried like an infant. “How is that you’ve come to be in my company for so long, and not even so much as noticed the fact that I’ve barely any visitors? I’ve not acquired posts for ages, nor have you ever met another soul, save for Inspector Lestrade. I am alone, John, hated and despised for being anything other than the person society expects me to be! They attacked me because they had every right to! I am nothing more than a freak, John. You would be a fool to stay...to join me in my isolation...you would do well, I think, out there. People would favor you, women will love you. You will forget about me in time so I urge you to go. I will ruin you, John. I will drag you into the desolate world that is loneliness and you too will come to resent me in time.”
“Why not?” John was angry with him now.
deserve no place on this earth? You are made of bits and pieces of men already dead. The two of you, so proud and self-righteous that you should tell me I am the abomination?”
Sherlock laughed at John’s response. He truly cared about Sherlock. John, however, did not seem amused. Sherlock cleared his throat.
“What is it, John?”
GUYS WE DID IT! This is the end of Vitruvian and we are so so glad that you all have enjoyed it as much as you did. My co-author and I are very sorry for the extreme delays in updating, life happens you know?
“Go to him, Sherlock.”
Sherlock only swallowed and turned to face the body that still did not move. With slow and careful steps he walked over to it.
You are mad, but I love every moment of it. To live with someone as extraordinary as you...it is amazing. Sherlock, you are fantastic, you are wonderful...you are brilliant. And there is nothing that would make me happier than to be with you and to bask in your brilliance. I do not know much about the world, but I do know that I love you.”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock finally asked.
“I am not sure about this, Sherlock.”
“Good?”
John swallowed, as Sherlock did, and gave him the biggest smile that he was capable of. Sherlock sat back in his chair and laughed.
Moriarty ripped the sleeve further in order to examine John’s arm. There it was as clear as day. John’s sutures, his ghastly, messy, black sutures that held his mismatched limbs together. Ones that Sherlock couldn’t remove and would likely be adorned by John for years. Moriarty’s eyes widened and a wicked smile spread across his face. The sadist, the monster.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“How so?”
Thomas sat back in the chair and smiled. He was satisfied with the answer, believing Gregory when he said that he would try his best. There were few policemen that would help him, the reason being that the English were not quite fond of the Irish. He was sure that his social status and wealth helped, so when people talked to him, they did not hear the accent, but saw how powerful he was. The only Englishman he met whom he set aside his hate for was Mycroft Holmes, someone he respected immensely.
“You a cop?” Anderson joked, “Fair-haired, pretty much all I remember.”
“I love you too, John. More than I can ever say.”
“Precisely! All together now.”
He hated Mycroft for saying that to him. Redbeard was the first and only friend he had. He brought him happiness, joy. To say Sherlock fell into a depression was an understatement. For months he confined himself to his room, sobbing and despising the world for taking Redbeard away from him. Mycroft offered the boy the collar but Sherlock could not stand the sight of the beautiful collar meant for a dog that no longer lived. He had no clue that Mycroft had kept it for all these years. The sentimental fool.
The blond pulled away first, his breathing rapid and unsteady. Sherlock’s eyes were half-lidded and his breaths were short but lustrous. John kissed Sherlock once more, but it was merely a peck on the lips, and then another, followed by a last one. John smirked as he watched Sherlock become even more aroused from the teasing pecks and tried as hard as he could to ignore the hardening in Sherlock’s groin, which was pressed against his leg. How long had John wanted this? To have Sherlock like this and all to himself?
“Before you speak, it is nothing but meat and bread. And you mustn’t forget the bath.”
Sherlock’s head began to pound at the mention of the blow to the head he had received.
The policeman answered, “Lestrade, Inspector Gregory Lestrade.”
He doesn’t remember much of his father. A man present for the childhood of his firstborn and less so for the next. Mycroft told him that once Sherlock was born, more matters of business arose that kept their father away, though his lies were easily seen through. Sherlock had no idea about his father’s whereabouts. Mycroft said that he died. A fire some place with no survivors. Sherlock was disappointed and saddened to hear the news. He never had the chance to get to know the man - just faint memories of someone with black hair and piercing blue eyes; Someone with a soft touch, a kind smile, and who said his name with such gentle and loving an utterance. His mother never hinted at any grievances about her husband’s absence. When he came around, they would kiss and there would be laughter, embraces, and smiles. Sherlock didn’t remember much about his father, but he knew that his father was not a bad man. He was a man loved by his family and who loved them in return.
He cried in his room to protect John from his gross displays of emotion but he failed. Sherlock would wake in the morning feeling as if he had not slept in years, and he tried to remove the crusty trails of what were his tears from his face. On those mornings he would crave the substance that Mycroft detested, but when he saw John’s smiling face, he thought that he would be able to get through the day. He was always right.
“See? That’s me,” Sherlock pointed to himself, “And that’s you.” He pointed to him. He looked confused, and mimicked Sherlock’s pointing. Sherlock nodded and did it again. Sherlock stopped the tap and helped his creature inside. He seemed reluctant at first and reached for Sherlock’s hand, but with encouragement, and Sherlock’s soft voice, he sat down in the water and waded his hand through it, even raising some to his lips and drinking. Sherlock was gentle as he cleaned him. He scrubbed the soap along his back, and attempted to clean the stitches, as well as the rest of his body. He stopped when it came to the front of his creation’s body. He taught him how to scrub, and when Sherlock felt that he had the gist of it, he let him finish cleaning himself. When he was done and came out, Sherlock cleaned his cut as well.
“I am in your company, Sherlock. I doubt that I will ever descend so far into boredom with you nearby.”
“You have done enough to him, and you have done enough to Sherlock and I. Tell me where he is.”
Maybe if he walked enough he would end up in the grass and find flowers to pick for Sherlock. For now, he would settle with finding the nearest market and buying Sherlock some sweets. He was satisfied when he found a tiny bakery and walked in. He bought two slices of Swiss Torta that were carefully boxed for the journey back to the inn. John had started on that very journey when something caught his eye. He stopped dead in his tracks and could not remove his eyes from the man that was standing before him. He had alarming blue eyes and chestnut colored hair - John nearly dropped his treats - he could recognize those features anywhere.
“Inspector Gregory was not so lenient with punishment this time ‘round.”
John swallowed, he looked at fire and then back at Sherlock. Sherlock shook his head and knelt down to be at level with the fire.
“Really? If you don’t mind waiting, then I can fetch him.”
“John I have already apologized…”
Sherlock’s body ached, but he did not want John clapped in cuffs.
“Ah, yes, well...it was caused by an error during an experiment. Nothing more.”
“I am quite proud of him.” John was facing a sleeping Sebastian. He and Sherlock were lying in bed together, they washed up after dinner and turned in early.
“Would you have preferred prison? You know, I have heard rumors that the courts have executed children. I wonder what they would have done to you, should my brother have chosen to take that route.”
Sherlock placed the cup down and shook his head.
Sebastian looked terrified, “But John will worry! I cannot lie to him, Sherlock. It is unthinkable…”
When they returned to the inn, John motioned for Sebastian to wait outside. He had left Sherlock asleep and was unsure as to whether or not he would be awake now or not. To his surprise, Sherlock was still lying in bed, fast asleep. John placed a hand to his mouth at the sight of his love, who was usually so well-groomed, with mussed up curls and mouth hanging open slightly as he let out the softest of snores. With a warm smile plastered on his face he made his way over to Sherlock and knelt down. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s mouth and let out a chuckle as he watched the man continue to sleep. This was the result of days without sleep. John stroked the wild curls and placed kisses all over his face. Still he slumbered. John laughed and moved to stroke the sharp cheekbones that he adored so much. Sherlock was beautiful, he was beautiful when he was sick, he was beautiful when he was upset. He is even beautiful when he was sad, but John would do anything in his power to ensure that Sherlock never feel such an emotion again. However there was something about Sherlock when he slept that made him simply irresistable to John. The way his face was so soft and fragile and made John feel as if he would shatter the man if his touch be. His mouth was soft, pink, gorgeous. It was one of the few times where he was relaxed, where he allowed himself to be vulnerable. He would protest if he were awake, but John knew that there were many things that Sherlock Holmes could and could not do and one of his weaknesses on his very small list was fight the needs of his body, and John. John sighed  and placed another kiss to his mouth, it was flattering, humbling, and so very predictable that John was his weakness.
Anderson grunted and pressed his face to the bars, Thomas could smell the rancid odor of the vomit that was in the cell. He had been intoxicated yesterday, that was clear. Anderson smiled and then grasped the bars of the cell door as if he were to be thrust into oblivion at any given moment. What Sally saw in this man, Thomas would never know.
“I think that this enough for tonight, John, we have had a long day and you had remarked upon your fatigue earlier. Shall we retire?”
John saw the way Sherlock’s face shriveled into the most sorrowful of expressions he had seen him wear. His words were true, Mrs. Hudson had become cold to him. John could only offer an embrace, unsure how else to comfort Sherlock. The man was grateful for even the smallest of touches that John could give him. It meant more to him than he could say to have John by his side.
How would he be able to provide a memory of how they met when in reality, Sherlock “birthed” him?
“Mmm...Sherlock…” John tried to rub the sleep from his eyes and wake up fully but Sherlock could see how dreadfully tired he was. Why wouldn’t John ever take time for himself?
John stared at Sherlock intently, he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do. Should he continue to watch the fire in front of him? Gaze until the flames extinguished and the embers of what was danced on the burnt wood? Sherlock huffed and turned away from John.
Sherlock placed his hand on the wet chest and felt the soft thumping of the heart. Sherlock closed his eyes. He could already feel the smile forming on his face. He wasn’t alone anymore, the heartbeats alone created a sense of security and comfort. Cold as his skin was, warmth radiated from him.
This one is a bit short, but the wonderful Chanolay did an excellent job with these journal entries, and so the next chapter will be a little angsty!
The man held his hand out, which Sherlock reluctantly took, and they shook hands briefly.
“Are you really going to retire so early?”
At that moment, Moriarty himself walked into the room, eyes black and piercing, mouth curved into a smirk that made Sherlock cringe. What was he going to do to them? Why did he do this to them in the first place?
“Good morning!” Sherlock looked at the entrance of the kitchen and saw John standing there with a genial grin on his face. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief, what would he even tell Mrs. Hudson? True, it is not as if he had done anything inherently intimate with John. They had only kissed once and Sherlock made sure to stop it there. He shared a bed with John only a few times, that was not so terrible, all they did was sleep. He was not a bad person, he wasn’t.
“Oh! Jo-hn,” Sherlock gasped, fingers curling around John’s forearms. His head dropped back against the pillow, back arching so he could push into the contact of John’s firm thigh. Sherlock was certainly hard now.
“You get off on them, don’t you?”
“It is alright,” John provided with an exaggerated nod.
“It’s you.” He breathed out. Sherlock detected the way the man shrank when Sherlock spoke.
John looked unsure, like he was skeptical of Sherlock, but for now he settled with grinning and placing a hand on Sherlock’s. He feared that John saw past his pitiful excuse, he always did, but he’d rather him believe that he succumbed to his racing mind rather than take a trip to Scotland Yard to discover the truth of Moriarty’s, what he now knows to be, lie. Moriarty wouldn’t let them be, they would have to stop him before he got to them instead. This was a dangerous game that they were playing, but this was the only way to stop that psychopath. He wanted to tell John, he planned on telling him everything, but not now. He wouldn’t be able to stand it if they fought about this. For now, he would have to keep John in the dark, and he would not enjoy it for a moment.
“Do you think you are able to recite it for us?” John asked, tapping the man’s chest again and repeating the name, “You are Sebastian.” He looked at the creature expectantly.
“Must I repeat myself?”
John and Sherlock exchanged looks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You did not put your hand into the fire, did you?”
He might have kept on moving his hips but John was not aware of such actions, lost in the glow with his forehead pressed to Sherlock’s.
“It is hardly his fault, he is afraid. These are new feelings, sensations, to him. He simply reacted poorly to his surroundings.”
“Sebastian, will you be needing pay?”
“Sherlock, you’ve the look of a skeleton! Have you been skipping your meals again?”
“You can. You can go see John.”
“Well, there was a man. Come here to file a theft. Some street urchin nicked his wallet.”
Maybe it would not be so bad to pay Mrs. Hudson a visit more often. Perhaps once a month? He would have to discuss this further with John, for now, he would have breakfast. He walked over to John and with the utmost care, placed two kisses on his lips and cheek, as well as a stroke of his hair. He paused once John began to stir, and when John opened his eyes, Sherlock mentally berated himself for rousing his companion.
“Come love, let us retire until morning. You have not had sufficient rest since our arrival at the manor, you are simply weary in both mind and body.”
The two nearly fainted. “Died?”
He turned to face the person who shouted that horrid name at him. It was a man and a woman. The couple did not look too well off, they were not poverty-stricken, but neither were they middle-class or even upper for that matter. The man was clearly drunk, his beady eyes latched onto Sherlock’s. The woman looked none too happy either. Sherlock had never seen them before.
“Looked about six feet? Blue eyes, cheekbones to the heavens, good lord. Rather pretty. Well, before we got to him.”
“What do you...Sherlock….What does he mean?...What’s wrong with me?”
“Please, have your seat, I shall be out in a moment with your plate.”
Sebastian shook his head and moved to grab his sleeve. He should have bandaged it before he left, he had been so focused on being away from Moriarty and Sir Banville that he neglected to treat his wound. John saw his pained face and knelt in front of him.
He would not tell Moriarty where John and Sherlock were.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He did want to talk to John but rather the opposite. He wanted to have John tell him of his observations while they traveled. He wanted the carriage to fill with the sound of John’s voice and only his. Sherlock knew he could be nasty sometimes, his mouth getting the better of him and spewing hurtful things to anyone that tried to help him. This was why he was always left alone, and why he always turned to the syringe filled with the one substance that could make the days bearable. How many times did he tell himself that he would give the world one more day to make him feel as if he belonged? How many times did the world show him that it was no home for him? All those hours wasted atop the manor, just waiting, biding his time.
------------
“More in the sense of sexual intercourse?”
“Mr. Banville. You need only fill this report out and I shall do my best to recover your stolen funds.” Lestrade had hoped that Thomas did not hear the feigned note of his voice. It was not as if he was completely indifferent to the man’s plight, but he was quite sure that the victim would be able to regain the lost amount much faster than it would take Lestrade to find it. London had hundreds of children who pickpocketed the noble daily, but he could sympathize with them. He was sure the culprit used the money to buy themself food or feed their family.
“Please Mrs. Hudson, do not think any less of me. I could not bear it if you did.”
“What proof have you that he was doing such things?”
“Nonsense, John. We shall be busy at work today, and had you allowed me to return to work the night before, I would see no qualms in spending our day in bed, doing whatever we desire.”
“Boat.”
“J-John. Please. I need- I need more,” Sherlock looked down at his lover through hooded eyes, lips parted, cheeks red, and head of curls in disarray-  already looking debauched.
She knew the place and seemed satisfied with the knowledge. Mrs. Hudson walked out of the room, closing the door behind her. Sherlock decided to have a quick nap, he would need the energy for tonight. Before he could drift off into slumber, he eyed his desk again, and then his picture of Mycroft. He slept easier that morning.
“I am glad.”
“How you talk!”
Sherlock grinned. Words could not express how he felt at the moment. John had drawn breath, he was alive, he was speaking! He was far from perfect, but Sherlock already forgot his feelings of anger and betrayal and the void filled with happiness and affection. For he had him now. He had his John.
John nodded and said, “...G...Good.”
Moriarty chuckled at the look of guilt written all over Sherlock’s face. He had to tell John, he deserved to be informed of how he came to be and how he came to be loved.
The intruder staggered from Sherlock’s bedside, and made his way to Sherlock, who was ready to launch the vase at him, should he try anything. Sherlock nearly fainted when the trespasser’s face was revealed by the candlelight. It was him. Sherlock’s man, the person that was to be his dearest companion, standing in front of him shivering and soaking wet from the rain. Sherlock stared at him, scarcely believing that he was truly alive. He was walking, and freezing, and scared. Sherlock had done it, his vitruvian man had become a reality.
“John, tell me you forgive me. All I wish for you to say is that I’ve been pardoned for my wrongdoings towards you. I only wished for companionship, someone that would care for me as much as my brother had. I’ve spent so long alone, and to have you now, for you to hold such hatred, such anger towards me for withholding your creation from you. Words cannot express how badly it aches. I…If you must go, if you absolutely cannot bear my presence, I understand, but please, forgive me.”
“As I said, it took some time before I completed the construction of your body. You did not wake as I so hoped you would. It tormented me to realize that all of my work, the risk to which I put my health, was all for naught. Mentally, I was in worse shape than I am now, and I have you to thank for the improvement. I could not take it anymore, John. Furious, I grabbed your body off of the cot that it had laid upon for days and carried your limp, heavy body down the stairs where I flung it into the darkness of the night and left you. I berated myself for thinking that such a foolish plan would ever work, that you would ever receive the life that I yearned for you to have. It was with a heavy heart that I dragged myself to bed and cried the most bitter tears I have never thought myself capable. I watched as the rain raged on outside and wept even harder at the sadness that tugged at my heart. You were a failure, as far as I knew,  and thus so was I. To this very day I am not sure what bid you wake, perhaps it was the lighting that came crashing down dangerously close to the building, or maybe I did not have enough faith in your birth. You did it, John. You found your way to me and although you could neither speak nor even walk properly, I knew that you would be everything I could ever hope for in a companion. Falling so deeply in love with you, however, came as a surprise even to me. Please accept my sincerest apologies for hurting you that night. I was drained and you did stagger in as a burglar would.”
“Baker Street.”
“Whatever would prompt you to desire my presence?”
“Kidneys, beans on toast, sausage, and egg.” He raised a brow at the full meal, toast and tea a pale comparison to it.
The wound stung as Moriarty grabbed it. Sebastian bit his lip to stifle the moan of pain that was coming to his lips.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you this, there wasn’t much chance for talk yesterday. What happened to your face?”
“Nonsense, John, if you desire new clothes then I will gladly purchase them.”
Moriarty pressed his hands to his mouth as he watched the scene unfold in front of him.
John’s mouth quirked to the left as he sniffed angrily.
The cab rocked as the horses turned and navigated through the London streets. In the duration they had spent sitting inches apart from each other, John had not turned to him even once. Sherlock should have told him about all of this but he hadn’t expected someone like Moriarty to reveal the secrets.The way the man had stared at him with those beady eyes, sneered at him, remarked upon how ghastly his stitches were. Why did he not try hard enough to make them cleaner, why did he have to rush the construction so? Now John would be be reminded of this day each time he undressed, after every bath, the mirrors would have to be removed from their rooms.
He unlocked the door to the building and walked up the stairs, hoping that John was in a better mood than when he left him. He felt his palms sweating as he neared his flat. He moved to knock on the door when he saw that it was already left ajar. His brows furrowed together as he stepped into the eerily silent flat. It was odd that the door was left open, but he was not in the best of moods when he stormed out of the flat, he was distraught and distracted, and John would be too upset to notice such a small thing. If John was still in a black mood, then he would probably be holed up in his room, ignoring Sherlock. Sherlock was still wary, but he cleared his throat and started to spew words of apology.
Four of the men that attended started to lower the casket. Sherlock noticed that one of the men, the oldest out of the four, had reddened eyes indicative of crying. That made him feel better, know he was not the only one who mourned Mycroft’s loss.
John slammed his fist down on the arm of the chair, creating a loud sound throughout the flat. Sherlock sat up immediately.
“It was Banville that fed you the truth of our lives? Who instructed you to target us after all the harm we’ve caused you?”
“Would you care to join me?”
“Your curls are every bald man’s dream.”
“John you must get into your night-clothes. I can lock the door, but come morning I cannot.”
Sherlock’s eyes trailed down.
“A walk then? That should clear your head right up. I know that you would rather bathe but we are not in our flat, the feeling would not be so intimate here.”
Thomas shrugged, “One sheds tears when met with grief, Mr. Holmes.”
“I did not. I would not disrespect him that way. I allowed his rest to continue. However, that did not solve my issue of finding the correct...materials.”
“I will take you on your word, but should you ever feel need to talk to me, I am ready to listen.”
Sherlock wished that he could answer that question, he truly did. He could tell John that it was because he was used to being alone, that he was used to doing everything by himself. He had Mrs. Hudson, but she was only his maternal figure. She wasn’t his friend; she wasn’t the person he ran to when he needed help. Sherlock had never had that before John. Mycroft had only helped Sherlock when he could not help himself, such as all of the times that he had carried his little brother home from those disgusting dens that were inhabited by the other drug addicts and criminals of London’s Underworld. Other than that, it was Sherlock who was left alone with his thoughts, with his tears, with his loneliness. He only placed his hand on John’s round cheek and smirked.
That hurt him. Sherlock saw the way he shrank in the reflection. Why must he be so cruel to everyone he loves?
Would this man be his brother, he wondered. They came from the same sort of womb, built upon the same cold metal table, made from pieces of corpses, and they were born from the same person, Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty would come for this man in a fortnight, and they were to hand off the poor sod to the madman without protest and assume that life would continue its peculiarly normal routine. They would wake, they would eat, they would read, and John would wonder what became of the creation. Did Moriarty treat him as well as Sherlock treated him? Would he come to fall in love with his companion too? Or would Moriarty twist the pure soul into someone even crueler and horrid than he is? These thoughts plagued his mind constantly and he had half a mind to tell Sherlock of his troubles, but then came to the decision that Sherlock was in no condition to hear of such worries.
“It’s the At...At...lan...tic.”
“We will make a home there.”
The male took a swig of his bottle.
He shook his head.
Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest, body going taut. It was always a strange feeling in the beginning but as John moved his finger in farther, Sherlock could only want more.
At the mention of John’s name, Sherlock began to feel rather lonely at the thought of sitting at this grand table alone for breakfast.
“Are you alright, Sherlock? You’ve barely touched your breakfast.”
“The attic of our flat?”
He spun around and made haste to his room, leaving John dumbfounded and concerned. He shut the door once he was inside and launched himself onto his bed. What a fool he was, what a moron, he knew better, he had been told but he never listened. He learned through Mycroft and that cafe he loved so much.
John tried to laugh too, but all that came out was something of a wheeze. He leaned in and said, “John.”
John was not about to let that happen, without thinking, he screamed, “Sherlock!”
“How will we conduct the lighting into the body?”
In the morning, John awoke before Sherlock. He smiled, kissed him on both cheeks, and then started to stroke the curls on his head. It was rare that John had awoken before Sherlock. He enjoyed to sleep, and wished that Sherlock had a better opinion of sleep as well. John looked out the window and saw that the sun was fairly high - it could not be later than nine, he thought. That was odd, was there no wake-up call? Did anybody knock them awake? Either John and Sherlock were more tired than they appeared, or this inn lacked proper service. He chalked it up to it being their state of fatigue. He kissed Sherlock on the temple and attempted to get over Sherlock without waking the man up.
Sherlock shut his journal only to sweep it off the table in a fit of agony and helpless despair. After months of toiling away he was left alone with the bare and shameful truth of his weakness, his gross need for affection. Out of all the foolish things he had ever done, were Mycroft still alive, this moment would bring about the height of his brother’s derision.
“That is precisely what I mean to tell you.”
“How?”
At John’s inquiry Sebastian nodded and fiddled with his fingers again. He was still very much like a child, John thought to himself.
Sherlock could not speak, if he tried all that would come out was bursts of tears and incoherent words. She understood, she did not want him to say a word. She slipped the letter in his coat pocket and rested a hand on his cheek.
The elderly man smiled.
Sherlock pulled the pipe from his mouth, straightening slightly in his seat to fix a more alert gaze upon John. “Oh? Do tell what you find so remarkable.”
Sherlock only chuckled and walked over to the coat rack so that he could remove his jacket. John joined him at the rack and grabbed the jacket from behind to help Sherlock take it off.
Sherlock intervened.
John moved to gather more water in his palm so he could wash the soap from Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock was waiting for John’s response, an agreement or...or words that would certainly end him.
Sherlock had found his voice eventually, breathy moans and little high-pitched noises leaving his lips. “John! Ah! F-feels….so good!”
“Sherlock! Think nothing of it, it was only an accident!”
Nothing. Sherlock flipped through the book again.
“In the laboratory.”
“If you’ll pardon me, I must bathe now.”
“How do you feel about this? Ah-dam.”
His response was followed by another bout of silence between the two. John was the first to finish, as usual, because Sherlock would toy with his food before eating it. He figured that he should teach John table manners when the time came for their next meal, or for the day where John would meet other people. Sherlock scoffed, he had no other friends save John, and Sherlock had no one else for John to meet. There was Thomas, but Sherlock had not wished to keep in contact with the man, and his mind had not changed since their meeting in the chapel. His mental state had become better, though he was not healed completely, but with John around he was stable and seeing Thomas would bring all of those awful memories back. The ones filled with the cold rain, the sniggers and whispers, and the sight of Mycroft’s coffin being lowered into the earth. No, he was not ready to face them and he doubted if he ever would be.
“Alright?”
Sherlock and John turned to find Mrs. Hudson standing behind them with the tray of tea and sandwiches in her hands. She walked over to the desk and set the tray down gently. John moved closer to Sherlock who looked seconds away from breaking down into tears. She wiped her hands on her apron and formed a smile that held more sadness than happiness. Her eyes gaze seemed worn and beaten down from years of hard work, as well as loss.
He stood in the middle of his bedroom, the words of his brother, of those who had ridiculed him, and of his own self-disdain filled his mind. His breaths came laboured and his eyes were hot and unseeing. A downpour beat against the windows, a constant thrum of noise to which the patter of his heart raced to match. The candle in his room, by whose lone light Sherlock had been writing, flickered as it came to an end, extinguished by its own pool of wax. Sherlock was frantically spiralling down into an abyss he had arduously fought all his life and, for a moment, he wondered if that was where he belonged. His mind was tearing itself apart where he stood and Sherlock was losing the battle against himself with every second past.
“What of him? He was an incompetent fool, my mother as well. I was glad to hear of their deaths from the cholera epidemic.”
“I do not mind it one ounce, Sherlock.”
There was still that need to deny John that simple request. To say,
“An idea that had only just come to me, in fact. I’ve always fancied traveling to Switzerland. The sun shines twice as brightly there than here in gloomy England and the grass is green and lovely. You would have the most splendid of times John. We can be away from this place for a short time. Just imagine how happy that would make us.”
“I’m...sorry?”
They had a daunting amount of labour ahead of them over the next few weeks but Sherlock knew that as long as he had John by his side he could and would accomplish anything to keep their happiness.
“How did that feel?” John asked with a tone of arousal. He was pleased with himself. Sherlock loved every moment of it, but he could not help but berate himself for letting it happen. To love John was illegal, Sherlock could not bear it if the people of England branded John a freak as well. He loved John too much to bear witness to his being outcasted by people who barely knew him. God how he loved him so.
“Say it with me. John. Jaw-n.”
Sherlock’s lips twitched into a smile briefly before John’s wrist changed angles and that perfect spot inside of him was brushed over. The rush of sensation made him go tense, mouth dropping open and eyes squeezed shut as he let out a high moan.
“You do realize that when the season turns we will have to extinguish the flames?”
He spun to face John.
“It is more like you know of him. He is Mycroft Holmes’ little brother, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Mind your tongue, Albert, for if I am not mistaken that is in fact Sir Mycroft’s younger brother.”
“Thomas. Thomas Banville.”
If she had anything else to say, she decided to keep it to herself. She detached his hand and left the room.
To that, Sherlock laughed. Surely John knew how hilarious he was. They continued their walk down the street, until they were stopped by a man clad in black. The stranger smiled at the sight of Sherlock, which confused the man and set John into a defensive stance. The last time Sherlock was stopped, it did not end well, but this time John was here to defend him.
Thomas signaled for another drink, he nearly told them to bring the bottle while he was at it.
“Sherlock, you know that I am wounded that you would keep such dire information from me. Why is it that you thought it best to keep me in ignorance rather than tell me of my true nature, why you desperately sought to create a creature like me?”
Sherlock let out a low rumble and replied, “Quite.”
John made his way over to Sherlock, who was standing over the body with a look of fearful curiosity. John watched with unease as Sherlock towered over the body, which still lay dormant and unmoving. It made very little sense, why had he not yet awoken?
“As do you your eyes.”
There it was. Such a perfect smile, full of contentment, love, bliss. Sherlock set his hands on his lap, away from John’s sight; he mustn’t see him fight the temptation of touching him. What Sherlock would not give to hold John’s cheek in his, to be able to feel the smooth skin against his own. He grimaced, such improper, degrading thoughts swimming through his head. He managed to suppress them, after that day with Mycroft, but they were slowly returning despite his efforts to keep them away. He pushed them far back into his mind, to where he could not access them. He had been fine for the past few years, not one lustful thought found its way into Sherlock’s mind. He was too busy, too smart, for them.
As was characteristic of most his journal entries, John’s had become more and more about his feelings for Sherlock. Somehow his descriptions of the day had turned solely to describing the small things about Sherlock that he loved. Naturally, this lead to a fond and thoughtful gaze resting on the detective’s form.
Sherlock closed his eyes and exhaled. The air was cold and harsh, but he would not move, he would freeze to death if need be. He knew that John had questions, any person in his position would. Sherlock’s eyes opened and he began to tell John just how his brother had come to rest six feet below their very feet.
“Do forgive the ungodly state of it, I had it in my hold at the time of the attack. I assure you that the contents inside are unharmed.”
John’s smile did not falter, and how Sherlock hated how calm he could be in situations such as this. True he had never experienced heartbreak, pain, or loss, but he should have understood where Sherlock’s anger was coming from. Mrs. Hudson was very dear to him, but she was wrong in delaying the news of Mycroft’s letter and even John had to see reason. He was supposed to be mad at him, but he could barely resist the urge to rush back into John’s arms and listen to the whispers of comfort. Sherlock wished that he would stop looking at him that way, it made it harder for him to stay upset.
Moriarty nodded, and his smirk then turned into a smile. He shrugged.
“I am very grateful that you withstood my constant complaints and brought me along.”
“Proteus? Pro-tee-us.”
John could not help but smile at his words. Come nightfall, John would be able to see their efforts pay off. Their man would wake, finally. He grabbed Sherlock’s hands again and held them up to his mouth. His lips lightly brushed against his knuckles.
“I will not force you to do something if it unsettles you, Sherlock. When you are ready, I will sense it and I will ask you for an answer. For now, we should enjoy one another’s company in this bath.”
“Mycroft was seven at the time, but lord, he had the mind of a grown man. In those rare moments that she allowed him to handle you, I’ve never seen him be so gentle. I daresay that, in his own way, he loved you more than your mother did.”
John smiled.
“How I yearn for his presence, John! I long for the days where I can hear his condescending voice or wake to find him already dining on breakfast! My only brother, my only sibling, left to rot underneath the earth!”
Sherlock looked into John’s steel-blue eyes and smiled. “Do you mean that you did not speak in jest?”
“J...aw...n…”
Sherlock turned around and saw the pitiful look that Sebastian gave him. “John will be unhappy, as will I. He...he cares for you a great deal, I may not have your intellect, but I know enough to understand. We can leave right now, if you wish it. I have no need to pack.”
“Where to?”
“Was there anything else of note on the night I awoke?”
Sherlock’s smile was as wide and false as he needed it to be, "You have my thanks."
“Pardon? You want company?”
“We must find you a suitable name, I think it only proper,” Sherlock piped in. He walked over to the bookshelf and grabbed the first book he saw; a book on important figures in Christianity. He had found John’s name from the Bible and there seemed no easier method. He flipped the book open and made his way back to the two. He crouched down with John and read from the pages of it, fighting every impulse in his body not to grin when he felt John’s hand rest on his thigh.
“Splendid.”
They shared the same bed, as had become normal, letting each other’s presence heal and give a sense of safety and comfort. The fight against the threat to their love, their relationship, was now over - washed away with Moriarty in his grave at the base of the Riechenbach falls. They were free of his looming presence and that freedom was almost difficult to become accustomed to, in a way. John knew that Sherlock looked at him often, but now there was something loving in the man’s eyes that John was not used to receiving so openly. In reciprocation, he also allowed his affections to shine through unadulterated.
“It’s Gregory, sir.”
“How so?”
“Him - his name is Sherlock Holmes.”
He smiled at Sherlock, even when he knew that John was cross with him. He offered to help Sherlock when it was clear that he was in need of it. He enjoyed spending time with him, he was unabashedly in love with John and to sit here and watch him sink deeper and deeper in despair because of him was something that was worse than any pain that could be inflicted on his person.
“Is it always so bitter?”
Sherlock nodded, “That would be the one.”
~~~~~~~
“Why are we here, Sherlock?”
“You mustn’t dally, John! If we are to go on this walk, we must do so now!”
“We were attacked by another, short bugger he was, strong too. Threw us all off the man and broke my mate’s arm in the process.”
“You are incapable of understanding such intricacies, my dear.”
“How unnecessary.”
“Do you know that he asked me if she would...harm him...as Moriarty did. He was terrified and I had to calm him.”
“Do you care for tea?”
“To answer your question, officer, I was attacked, and my friend here came to my aid.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
He sighed out of relief once he saw the coach staged outside of the home. He entered and threw the sack inside, causing a loud thud. Before he could climb in, Jeanette ran up to him, looking dreadfully tired.
“Sebastian will be your name?”
to hold John’s hand. It was wrong for men to touch another of their gender in such a way. A husband might hold his wife the way Sherlock would like to hold John; A suitor may hold hands with his mistress the way Sherlock had tried to hold John’s; But two men were not allowed to do such things. Sherlock tugged at his hair as he thought about John, who was no doubt awaiting his return. He had the audacity to invite John into his bed, to sleep with him, to share a personal space with him. How furious Mycroft would have been had borne witness to his brother’s depravity!
“You misunderstand! What if the charge has been safely conducted into the body but we have yet to complete our task of reviving him?”
-------
“I’ve already told you of my brother’s death at the manor, I’d rather not retell it if that is alright.”
“It is nothing; I fear that my sides have become a bit...tender from the coughing.”
“Moses?!”
“You will remain here while I tend to Sherlock.” John spoke as if he were a teacher instructing a student. John doubted their spoken words were being understood. If he had to venture a guess as to why things were going fairly well now, he would say the demeanour of him and Sherlock were facilitating enough calmness for the man to feel the same or at the very least, safe.
Sherlock shook his head. John would not leave him, he was merely overacting. However, Sherlock was the only other person John knew. What if he met another man or even a woman out there and favored their company over Sherlock’s? Would he pester him? Would he beg Sherlock every hour of every night to let him see his new friend again? Or would John become angry with him for hiding him in the flat for so long? The worst scenario that Sherlock’s mind could conjure was John falling in love with that person, or simply growing tired of Sherlock and leaving him alone. Sherlock was not sure if he would be able to survive without his John. To be left alone in the flat without a soul to talk to, even someone he had created especially for himself not being able to stand his company. Sherlock was sure that he would take his own life. He was also certain that no one would notice his absence either, and his body would be left to rot.
She nodded in understanding and moved to open the door.
“John.”
“Isaiah.”
It was then that Moriarty joined the conversation.
“John will return with your blanket. Do not worry.”
“My older brother, my only sibling in fact.”
John shut the door and tried to find somewhere to retreat. His mind was racing too quick to act rationally. He merely raced around the flat attempting to find a hiding spot ideal for him. The men entered the flat and he had no choice but to fight them off. Where was Sherlock? Why did he leave? He managed to make one of them bleed, their nose gushing with crimson liquid. Clearly they were not prepared for his strength.
“And was this the whole of his business? Nothing more?”
“John, it has begun!”
Sherlock’s lip quivered and he wore a mock smile. “Why, we are on holiday. I have already told you this before we de-”
The ride to the falls was silent. John sat next to Sebastian and wrung his hands together as he thought about Sherlock being alone with Moriarty. He was angry, scared, and worried out of his mind when he thought about the love of his life. How could he fool John so? He used the only other person to have John’s heart to distract him. John turned to look at Sebastian who looked near tears. His hands clutched at the velvet of the seat, white and shaking. John frowned, Sebastian looked terrified. He waited a moment before the man spoke.
“I’ve not slept like that for sometime, I am feeling refreshed.”
“I am...quite alright.” Sherlock’s voice wavered as he replied. His facade was weak, he was sure that John saw through him. He had to distract him, to focus his attention elsewhere.
Mrs. Hudson only smiled, but there was something almost sad behind it. She patted his hand and said, “My dear boy…”
“I am quite fine, I assure you.”
Sherlock did not respond. He heard the guests talking again, and he could not help but overhear their idle chatter. It seemed that Albert initiated conversation this time.
John blushed and looked over at Sherlock. “Well? Is this all it took to render you speechless?”
“Right.”
“I only require a few days’ rest. You worry yourself too much.”
“Mycroft was breech; came out legs first. He wailed as strongly as any newborn and was a bit on the heavy side, never quite lost that weight. Your mother could scarcely contain her excitement. She wanted nothing more than to hold him, to smell him, to see her newborn.”
He could
“We leave immediately. You’ll pardon me for doing this, I hope.”
“Such brave stars. No matter how the fog diminishes their light they do not extinguish.”
Sherlock peppered kisses along John’s back as he thought back to the fall.
“I will return, when I cannot say, but do know that my leave will not be permanent.”
“Mr. Holmes! I-I mean…” He took another drink of his tea and swallowed, “Sherlock.”
“Oh, I do not doubt that he certainly sped the process along, but I would have found you anyway. It was you who followed me here like a bitch in heat.”
How could two people who had never been intimate even claim to be lovers? All the times John had wanted to progress to that stage with Sherlock was met with the man succumbing to bashfulness, insecurity, and self-hatred. Part of him, although he was loathe to admit, was glad that they have never gotten that far. How would John have reacted once he noticed the stark contrast between Sherlock’s smooth skin, and his own scarred flesh? And how would Sherlock recover from the loss of an intimacy he’d been craving for nearly all his life? He was an idiot for not thinking this through back at the manor, when John was only an idea.
“Come, we must eat first.”
“Nonsense, take your seat and I’ll be but a moment.”
“I’ve got eyes, Anderson, I can see as much.”
John had heard him.
She raised her brow. Of course she would see right through him, she had known him for his whole life, tended to the wounds caused by the bullies, and she knew the difference between an accident from an experiment and a bruise created by a punch. He did not want to upset her this early in the morning but he knew that she would not leave well-enough alone.
Sherlock crawled under the bed and stood up on the side. He picked up a glass that was resting on the nightstand next to his bed and threw it at the stranger.
“Sherlock, have you finished your food?”
He could hear John say something, but once again it was nothing more than mumbling mixed in with unintelligible words. He was concussed, if this was not the case then the person, or people, that had done this to him had come back a second time after the initial kidnapping to silence him once more. He grabbed John’s cheeks in his hands and lifted his face so that he could see John’s eyes but they were closed.
“Only to meet him at the falls - Reichenbach.”
John had been admiring Sherlock’s bare form but he raised an eyebrow at the procured item when his lover returned to him.
That sparked a genuine laugh out of Sherlock. John had the humor that he wished he possessed. Sherlock turned over, almost forgetting that there was hardly enough room to do so. John only continued the process of washing Sherlock’s hair, and carried on as gently as possible. Sherlock closed his eyes and laid a hand on John’s arm. He realized that this would be the perfect opportunity for John to initiate intercourse with him. They were both nude, Sherlock was relaxed, if not a bit weak, the conditions were perfect. Yet, John made no move nor mention of any further intimacy than this, Sherlock found this mind-boggling.
“Give me your arm, Sebastian.” Ah, there was fear in his eyes. His suspicions were confirmed. The poor man.
“I have been in this condition before, John. It was prior to…. you and I meeting...the months shortly before, I was just as ill if not worse and I had no one to care for me, and yet I survived.”
“All that remains is your head and your innards, I shall try to finish as soon as I am able.”
The other children did not help him, they only laughed as he was kicked, and hit, and broken. The boys only stopped because their parents returned from their outings and there was nothing worse than being late for supper. Not a one checked to see if he was even alright. He limped home and sobbed as he told Mycroft all about it. Mycroft was still young in comparison to the middle-aged couples that littered their neighborhood, not to mention that their parents died just a few years prior. The parents of the bullies looked mortified that their child would even do something as monstrous as attack Sherlock, they told Mycroft that they would punish them immediately. Sherlock was not able to wander the streets as freely anymore.
Days after the incident, Sherlock had made an effort to refrain from touching John in such intimate ways. He hoped that John did not think his care was lost for him, that simply not being true. Sherlock cared for him so much that he did not want John to suffer for his selfishness.
“Perhaps, and do correct me on my errors, but do you think that...he is aware of what I truly am?”
Mrs. Hudson gasped and pressed her hand to her mouth. “You poor dear.”
Ten minutes had passed since he heard either of the men speak or fix another drink. He got up and moved towards the window and saw that the carriage was not there. They were gone! How long had they been here before he returned? Were they waiting for him before they departed? He supposed so, he was something of their guard dog once they were away. They never included him in their travels, save for this one to Switzerland. They only left him behind and expected him to be there when they returned. It was so lonely. At Baker Street, he was never alone, if John was absent from the flat then Sherlock would be there. Sherlock was not so keen to conversation as John was, but it was still company. The alternate was same if Sherlock were away except John would read to him and converse with him about everything. A single tear fell from his eye. He wanted to be gone from this place, to be free of Moriarty and Thomas. One more visit would not hurt. It would be quicker now, he knew where they were, he could be quick. He only wanted John to smile at him again, and to tell him how smart he was, and how much he missed him. He wanted to watch Sherlock fuss with whatever kept him occupied, see him wake in the morning with mussed hair and bleary eyes.
“You said that rather quickly. Has this been a constant thought?”
The sleeping man unconsciously complied and moved over, allowing John enough room to get over him and get dressed. He had wanted to spend the day sight-seeing with Sherlock but he did not know when Sherlock would rise  John wanted to get a head start so that when he went with Sherlock, he could be of some use. Before he left the room, he walked over to what would be Sherlock’s bed, and mussed up the sheets to make it seem like he had slept in it.
“However, I did.”
He heard the men mumble about something, and then the sound of a door closing. Did they both retire? Did they leave again? How long would they be out? Maybe he would risk it to see John and Sherlock again. Hearing their voices made him sink with despair. He missed John and Sherlock terribly, and to see them once again, and so briefly as well made him hurt in more places than his wrist.
There was no response. Sherlock scrutinized the cut that had formed when he threw the glass. He felt a stream of guilt wash over him. He had not meant to cause his creation pain, no matter how much had been inflicted on him. Sherlock grabbed the man’s hand and lifted it up so that it rested on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock found a laugh creeping its way out when he witnessed the other’s reaction.
Thank you guys for being so patient, as we are both very busy and do try our hardest to get the chapters out.
“Is something the matter, Sherlock?”
John knelt down in front of the chair and brought careful fingers up to Sherlock’s face to access the wounds. Sherlock found this peculiar, did John think to tend to Sherlock on his own?
Sherlock felt his eyes become watery at the soft utterance of John’s words. What had he done to deserve a man as kind and wonderful as John?
He assumed that John had flown into a fit of rage, although there was something telling him that that was not the case. He moved to the kitchen table, observing that the chair was knocked over and there was a book of some sort sprawled on the floor. Sherlock picked it up and discovered that it was a journal kept by none other than John.
John heard the way Sherlock coughed from where he sat in the laboratory. The body of the man was splayed atop the metal table and John had just finished recording his thoughts in his journal. He sighed, he hadn’t had much time to himself since Sherlock fell ill. He had told the man time and time again to rest and eat accordingly, and each time he assumed that Sherlock had finally obeyed him, he would find Sherlock shivering in the attic while attending to the body. They had nearly finished the man and the allotted two months were not yet reached. While John was grateful, Sherlock always found something that needed to be changed or another stitch that needed to be sewn. Sherlock was anxious, that much was obvious, and he was likely scared. Moriarty threatened to report them to the police, and after everything John had seen, Sherlock would not do well in prison, especially without his company. There was the other fact that Sherlock was quite ashamed of his sexuality. It saddened John to see the way he looked at odds with himself after a kiss or going to bed together. He knew that Sherlock loved him deeply but there persisted a pang of self-hatred that coursed through Sherlock at intervals. John cursed Sherlock’s brother, Thomas, and Mrs. Hudson for it. He was a good man and he deserved the world, not this fear of something so pure and harmless.
It was wrong, Sherlock knew this. His lifestyle was wrong in the eyes of society. It was incredibly selfish to bring John down with him, maybe he would enjoy the company of a woman just as much as he did Sherlock, perhaps he did not mind what gender his partner was. John was the one puzzle, the only mystery that Sherlock could not seem to solve, and it maddened him and made him love John even more. Sherlock groaned, this sentiment, it was ruining him, tearing his mind to pieces. He enjoyed everything about John. He enjoyed his smell, his very essence, the sight of John was enough to calm his hectic mind. He loved him, God how he loved him. He stopped in the middle of the street, his shoulder colliding with the busy Englishmen and women that scurried up and down the cobblestone.
Sebastian was sitting on his bed, nursing his arm and trying his hardest not to let his tears fall. Moriarty was especially cruel to him today, and it was not the drink that spawned it. He was in a bad mood, Sebastian could already tell as much. If Moriarty’s mood was lighter, he would have let him pass without any argument seeing as how he seldom joined the two in the living room to smoke and drink. He remembered the last time he was forced to witness Moriarty’s black mood. It made him miss Sherlock’s sulks.
John smiled, cutting himself another slice of the roast.
Caring was not an advantage and Mycroft was always right.
Sherlock visibly crumpled at the words. All these months and he still could not even associate death with his brother. He would get over it in time, he told himself, and he would learn to make it hurt less with each passing day. Soon, his brother would live on in fond memories, but for now, all his memory brought was pain and sadness. He rose from the couch and began to walk in the direction of his room. Their room. Sherlock was not sure.
“He is clever, much too clever to be caught so foolishly.”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, I’ll set off immediately.”
Sherlock would have liked to. He saw the way John’s toned softened, sounding quite sad for a moment. If Sherlock had to guess, John wanted that bond of kinship between himself and their man downstairs. It disheartened Sherlock to see John’s look of want and longing, perhaps he had felt just as Sherlock has for all those years. Maybe, on some level, John was lonely.
Shifting must have brought him into contact with that sweet spot inside Sherlock because the man was suddenly moaning louder. His blunt nails dug into the skin of John’s shoulder blades but John did not care. If anything, those sharp points of pain kept him from unravelling faster because there was a tightness in his gut that threatened to spill over. He knew once he gave in to that urge to let go, this would be finished.
“We shall see, John.”
He made his way to the living area, the seats were empty and the grooves on the chairs were nearly nonexistent. He pulled his coat off the rack and placed his cap on his head. The door seemed in that moment so close yet so far. He was only mere inches away, but his legs felt locked in place. He exhaled, and he began his walk to the exit. As soon as his hand was hovering above the doorknob, the sound of a door opened and then closed.
Sherlock scoffed. He turned around and began unbuttoning his shirt. John rolled over and watched as he took his shirt off. He knew that Sherlock could feel his eyes on him and was glad that it did not stop him from changing. After Sherlock slid his night clothes on, he turned around to face John. He had on a purple silk set, whereas John had on a plain blue and white striped set. John was still staring at Sherlock with an affectionate smirk. Sherlock inched his way over to John so the man rolled over onto his back and grabbed Sherlock’s hand as the brunet climbed on top of him. When Sherlock was straddling John, he bent down so that his face was directly above John’s. There was no surprise when Sherlock started to kiss him. John’s hands wrapped around that narrow waist as Sherlock trailed lips slowly down his neck, pausing briefly to unbutton the first three buttons of his shirt, and then continued to kiss his chest. John tried not to moan, seeing as how others were probably already asleep and could likely hear them if he were any louder. He whispered Sherlock’s name as the man moved back to John’s neck and then returned to his lips. John was disappointed when Sherlock stopped their kiss. Before John could speak, Sherlock lifted the covers and made his way underneath them. He kissed John a few more times before he closed his eyes. The pull of sleep held no fighting chance against the exhaustions of the day so John could not protest. Instead both men found themselves fading into slumber and into their dreams...
Sherlock tipped his head in thanks, prompting the man to scurry off to the next customer that walked in. Sherlock walked up and down the section of the store, searching for the right suit for John. He deserved the best, and only the best.
“Pardon me, but you still have not answered my question. Are you here to file a complaint?”
“Splendid choice, sir! Shall I box it for you?”
The letter. He saw his coat draped over the back of the chair at the desk.. He had to read it, despite the late hour. John would not be disturbed by his absence in the bed, the rest of the house was asleep. He had to know what Mycroft wrote to him in those fleeting moments of his existence. How very like Mycroft, to continue to puzzle Sherlock even after death. He rose from the bed with stealthy movements, bending down to place a kiss to John’s smooth forehead, and then walked over to the desk, taking the letter from the coat pocket. It had been forever since he had sat in this chair. He lit a candle using the box of matches he kept in his drawer. Once he was able to see, he fished the letter out of his pocket, and with a deep breath, opened it.
The name he saw read “Watson”. The epitaph read that he succumbed to the effects of alcoholism. This reinforced the idea that the family was not rich. Sherlock also assumed that the man probably died from failure of the liver or an unfortunate accident while drunk. Watson’s face looked soft, clean-shaven. He was dead for a few months, but he looked as if his funeral was yesterday. Sherlock stared at the face for a long while before he started to hack away. Watson was not an ugly man, he was in fact quite attractive. Sherlock hesitated at first, he didn’t want to ruin such a gentle face. He found his nerve again and off the head went. Sherlock could not stop his silent apologies as he slid the head into the sack. He fixed the grave as best as he could before he returned the shovel to its rightful spot in the shed. He heaved the admittedly heavy sack over his shoulder and raced off to his manor.
John came over to the metal table and examined the man who refused to live. His hair was chestnut and damp due to the rain that they had let in alongside the lightning.
“I did not want to impose…” John finally provided.
“Come, I’ll tend to your wound and clean you up as well.”
Naturally, John took his seat next to Sherlock. Sherlock wondered if she saw the way John squeezed his thigh underneath the table. They could not stay here, they could never come back. When he was sure that Mrs. Hudson was out of earshot, he said, “After breakfast, we shall depart from this place and return to Baker Street. We have overstayed our welcome.”
“Would you like to see?”
“Worry not, I will place you as caretaker of the house. Until I return, this house will be under your care and management. Does that suffice?”
Thomas froze for a moment.
“You must close your eyes,” John shut his eyes and Sherlock saw that Sebastian mimicked him. Incredible. “And after you must wait for your body to become heavy and drown out all other noise,” He instructed, settling his arms at his sides and relaxing his body as best he could.
John pouted and nodded.
“I’m afraid the food has gone cold. When I woke you had already gone and I had no knowledge as to where you went.”
“Come, John. We still have an hour before the sun appears. We should take advantage and rest for the remainder of the night.”
------
Thomas and John stood aghast at Sebastian’s words. He was a fast learner, and Sherlock would have been proud to witness this moment. John smiled softly at Sebastian, and the way the man held his hand. He was nervous, terrified even, but he wanted to defend them as best as he could.
“He told us all about you.”
John shrugged, a smile playing on his lips, “You might.”
Sherlock almost didn’t want to tell him of his sore body for he did not want to risk John’s arms to leaving him.
A brief flash of light illuminated the room and broke through his anguish, eyes finally focusing on the dark skies of the night to identify the source of the light. He saw nothing. And then there was the loud crack of thunder whose harsh boom made Sherlock cringe. He trembled where he stood, bereft now that the madness was brought to a halt. He felt vulnerable, afraid, and, most of all, angry.
“Sebastian, none of this is your fault. Sherlock should not have used you in such a deceptive manner. He should have been honest with me so that we may both be together in such a dark and trying time. Trust me when I say that I am not cross with you. I could never bring myself to be upset with you in any way, Sebastian.”
“And what of this poor bloke? Are we to just hand him over to Moriarty without a care in the world?”
“I almost forgot. Would you care to see your gift?”
The next morning, Sherlock woke to find John wrapped tightly around him, even more so than was usual. Sherlock sighed, it had everything to do with their conversation before they slept, the discovery that he made after their beautiful night together. Moriarty had gone against his word and informed Detective Inspector Lestrade of their relationship - him of all people! The one person in the whole of Scotland Yard that had actually built a rapport with him. It was all ruined now, they were caught, Sebastian had become their martyr for all the wrong reasons, and John had no idea as to what they were in for. He wanted to get an early start, before John was awake and coherent and ready to follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth. Slowly, he began to untangle himself from John’s limbs and leave the bed without even causing so much as a stir from his slumbering love.
