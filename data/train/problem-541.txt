He’d felt a bit woozy as he’d sat down and had had to support himself with a hand on the hard sofa back.
The shirt is all tucked in now, just the buttons of his trousers and the belt buckle are left of this dresstease. John turns to face Sherlock, he just has to. This is the finale after all. He can see that Sherlock's orgasm is coming the second he reaches to button the lowest of his fly buttons. Sherlock hovers valiantly over the brink of it during the first button and the second button, his hand furious now, his eyes blowing wide. John can see that it is a desperate battle for Sherlock to keep his gaze clear and focused.
Better yet to buy several pairs, take most of them home all innocent like and leave just one pair at the clinic for later use. Sherlock will deduce his trip to the clothing store anyway, but this way he might not question the missing pair. If John is lucky.
Miffed, Sherlock had risen from his chair, sat down on the sofa, and John had poured them tea. Sherlock had opened his mouth to start reviewing all the details of the case just like he usually did, because of course that was what John had been aiming for all along, but John had spoken before he’d been able to choose where to start from; from the first oddity with the flower pot that had been missing from one of the crime scene photos or from the phone call from Maria, because while the flower pot had started the investigation, the phone call had started the crime and…
John had not simply let him slump against him. John had molded his whole body into the comfortable embrace and held him close. John had sneaked an arm around him, caressed him, made him feel safe.
That gasp was almost breathless and John could see the Adam's apple he was still staring bobbing slightly. A kind of a sound erupted from somewhere in his own throat because there were things he could deal with and then there were things like Sherlock's neck and swallowing and proximity, which perhaps each on their own might work quite well but at this exact moment, combined, did unfortunate things to his self restraint. He was sure he was never going to hear the end of this and so he took a deep breath in and hung his head in preparation to standing his ground against the onslaught. But then he was looking down too.
John glances towards the bed then. He cannot help it. Just a glance, but he sees that Sherlock has lifted himself from his lounging position, is sitting, leaning forward in fact, his mouth slightly open, his head a little cocked. His eyes wild.
It will be a while yet before John will put his book down and stretch and yawn and finally stand up and wander back to the kitchen to make another cuppa. That will give Sherlock just enough time to carefully stand up and adjust himself and sneak into the bathroom or his own room to silently take care of himself.
Underneath the concealing coat, he’d brought his own hand up to find John's. Their fingers had entwined together, and a pure white joy had burst inside Sherlock. He’d not been quite sure, but perhaps he’d hummed, or perhaps it had been John.
“Please”, he pleads, and Sherlock looks at him, his face shattered. John bites his lip, “I need to…”, but Sherlock doesn’t need explanations, he never does. “Yes”, he breathes and seems just as gone as John is.
By some miracle, Sherlock finds them. The socks tickle something mad, but they are still soft and they smell so much like John, that Sherlock spends some time as a pretzel on the floor sniffling his own feet. He briefly wonders why he’s on the floor, but then he remembers – he descended there in search of under table socks.
Sherlock opens his mouth as if to say something, but he seems overwhelmed, just looking at John, his eyes roaming up and down.
As a contrast Sherlock’s look is deadly serious. And fixed entirely on John’s left sleeve, where the lighter fabric of the plaid cuff peaks underneath the darker cuff. John has to swallow himself now, because whatever he expected to happen was certainly not on this level of intensity.
John freezes his belt still open. Sherlock looks breathtaking. Spent, frayed, full of energy, his hair a mess, his eyes closed, one hand still on his half hard cock, the other fisted in an iron lock around his own clothes, his chest heaving up and down as if he just finished an Olympic level sprint.
“No, love”, John smiles and he has to take a detour then, to kiss his husband quickly before he heads to the kitchen. The way Sherlock's breathing quickens as he leans over is not lost on him either.
“I… sorry…”, he coughs, “can I fetch a glass first? Er, drink something…” He turns in his chair to gesture vaguely and starts to stand up, but Sherlock is already heading towards the kitchen, pouring him a tall glass.
Sherlock buries his nose in the pants and licks John over them. It doesn’t take long before both pants are wet, what with Sherlock’s saliva working from the outside and John’s precome working from the inside. John is slumped in his chair, loose and tense and whimpering from want. As arousing as he finds Sherlock's arousal, this is not quite enough friction for him, and he's starting to be desperate.
With Sherlock's eyes now boring holes into John's left hand that's still limply grabbing the trousers, John gets a move on. He grabs the waistline more firmly and lets the trouser legs drop down, then steps into the left leg and then into the right. As he bends down he hopes the hems of his double pants show nicely under his butt.
Sherlock whines a little. John wonders if he ever wore two pairs at once and immediately calls himself an idiot. Of course Sherlock has done that. Of course Sherlock knows exactly how they feel. In much more detail than John could ever register.
He will take a few minutes to calm down, to not spontaneously burst in his chair. Then, once his heartbeat evens out again, he will let his gaze linger over John once more; his legs splayed, his crotch all displayed there, all the myriad creases of his trousers, his belt so invitingly visible, the hem of the cardigan just there to caress the top of the belt. John's breaths just as even and mesmerising as ever.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck”, Sherlock chants and it's so unlike him that John cannot help but chuckle and pet his wild curls.
You have to understand, this all happened quite quickly. In one second they knew the heads of their cocks would inevitably – unerringly – unmistakably touch, in another second they were vibrating with the knowledge of it and on the third it happened.
is a little bit weird, even for him. Funny, though, he vaguely remembers that it had seemed logical enough as he'd sent it.
They were sitting drinking their morning cups of coffee. John was reading the paper and making faces at the different articles. Sherlock often amused himself by figuring out the piece of news from John’s expressions alone. The particular face John made then, made Sherlock immediately perk up. John licked his lips and grinned and his eyebrow quirked and his mouth opened and closed several times before he finally got out what he wanted to say.
The obvious solution was of course acquiring a long enough case that it would tire even this new alert John out. Too bad they didn’t have any cases on at the moment. At first, Sherlock tried a few cold cases, but they were so easy, he solved them all before he even had time to tell John about them. Then he tried calling Lestrade, but Lestrade just hung up on him.
It took just a second to register for them both. And then. Grabbing, gasping, reckless, fast, reaching, staggering, pushing, tugging, desperate, crushing, tight, so tight against each other that it was painful and uncomfortable and not at all conducive for anything they really wanted, but they both just. Had. To get. Closer.
He is more concerned with the fact that he is shivering. Why John always fiddles with the thermostat is beyond him. It feels like the temperature's been fluctuating something crazy just today. John really should be home when he does this so he could be properly yelled at, Sherlock thinks, and something about that deduction feels off, but he shakes his head, and more than anything else, he needs a blanket right now. John has his always folded over his chair, and there it is now. He grabs the blanket and smirks. He’s a genius!
With the right lighting and a thin enough shirt, the whole shape of the vest underneath can be almost appreciated. Sometimes Sherlock makes John change place to a particular chair for optimal light – some restaurants and cafés really are much too dim. John rarely seems to notice, though, and if he does, he just assumes it's to do with whatever case they are currently working on.
Sherlock made a sound that did resemble a “John” but neither of them could be quite certain of it. The sound John made was unmistakably his breathing; hoarse, scratching and stumbling. They were both dizzy and trembling.
Sherlock had valiantly tried falling asleep in random places and he was constantly yawning when John was making tea. But John never took the bait. Whenever Sherlock was lying around in prettily arranged sleeping poses, John mostly just coughed and shook him awake or sneaked to the kitchen to surreptitiously knock something over very loudly.
Everything is visible. John's collar still as neat and tidy as ever, a shadowy glimpse of his unique throat behind it, his broad shoulders relaxed, the cardigan draped over them, swooping down low and giving a generous view of his shirt covered chest. All the shirt buttons are unfortunately relaxed now but that does not matter, because for some reason the cardigan has stretched a bit as John has sat down, the top button straining just a little, the décolletage tight against John's pectorals. Dear God! Every time John breathes in, Sherlock can see how it tightens a little, he can almost feel the fibres of the fabric stretching, embracing the contours of John's chest.
“Well. First you started it. Then I picked it up. But now you’ve messed up my plan and taken over again.”
Grudgingly, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that he’d scared John away. He’d been onto John for weeks and that had been fine, but now John was onto him being onto John and that, apparently, was not fine at all, it was the opposite of fine. It was a disaster. John was awkward, and Sherlock was awkward, and that made John even more awkward, and the nasty feedback loop was up and working like a charm – or like an unlucky charm, to be more precise.
The snuggling John had vanished, and in his place was a new John. A polite, vary, and annoyingly respectful John.
But overall they managed nothing much until the eviction papers of the Carousel pinged into Sherlock’s phone and the case that was not a case turned out to be a sort of a case after all. Not strictly speaking a detective case, but a law case at least, and, well, Sherlock was game to do some studying. They took a cab to Chancery Lane and sneaked into the Law Society Library and spent half the night with Sherlock devouring information and John fetching him different books and the other half (after running out of the library posthaste with a guard on their heels) waking up several lawyers who owed Sherlock from this or that old case until one of them finally agreed to help them.
When the cases failed, Sherlock tried to get John interested in one or two of his experiments that could be carried out by lurking in rainy London street corners, but for some reason John did not seem keen to join him.
“No it’s… You all tucked inside, under both of those pants. I wanked four times today while you were gone just thinking of it.”
“I take it as a yes”, John says and he wants to wink and smirk, play it cool and cocky, but such warmth fills his heart at that moment that his face just morphs into a broad silly smile. That he can do something like this to this extraordinary man…
If the lighting fails or if the shirt on top is just too thick, there's still the possibility of glimpsing the contours of the vest. The absolute best option to achieve this, is to make John pick something up from the floor or behind the sofa so, that he has to bend his upper back. When the dress shirt tightens around his shoulders, the curved neckline of his vest is drawn very nicely all along his upper back. Sherlock has to make sure to stand far enough not to be tempted to reach out and follow the inviting line with his finger.
John snapped the paper shut and grumbled something, but Sherlock was already thinking about the possibilities of the case. Inspecting all those shops and standing in their freezers for one; everyone knew cold air kept you awake. It would be perfect, it would make John alert while Sherlock surreptitiously tired him up. Oh, it would all work out perfectly.
figured it out. It was not like he could have announced it to the world – or even to himself out loud. The risk of being found wrong would have been much too high.
The dream John had chuckled, but also frowned at the same time and tried to ease his hand off, but Sherlock had merely snuggled closer, rubbing his chin against his woolly jumper like a cat. “You smell like catnip”, he’d sighed, and then added as an afterthought, “is it really
John gulps half of it down in one go and swipes his forehead. He is sweating. From heat and nerves and arousal. He feels moisture gathering in his neck and under his vest and fuck, down in his pants. He feels flushed. The chair is hot against his back and under his thighs. He must reek down there by this point. Can Sherlock already smell him? He hopes it's a turn on and not the opposite.
He reaches out and grabs Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock seems happy enough to leave his trouser buttons for a while and smooth his thumb against John’s palm in stead.
Oh. John had a point there. He had been awake much longer than John had. Well. He’d thought he could make it. He had much more practice in staying awake for unhealthily long time periods than John had.
John opens his phone to type a reply, but he doesn’t quite know what to say. He closes the text box and sees that Sherlock is still typing.
John texts him that time, and Sherlock – feeling bizarrely like his legs are on fire – reluctantly scrolls up his message history to see what prompted the overreaction this time.
There is a certain friction in the movement of a shirt layered with a vest underneath. A shirt directly against the skin is more free to move about the torso, but a vest underneath makes the shirt pull and cling and wrinkle in a very distinct pattern.
And just like that, he will be straining against his pants again, making himself go almost wild before once more letting himself close his eyes for a few moments and breathe. He wonders what might happen if he one day took it one step too far and actually orgasmed right there in his chair, in plain daylight, in front of John, just from looking at the folds of his shirt?
Sherlock is still silent, sitting opposite John at the table. His eyelids are heavy and his posture languid and relaxed. John loves seeing him like this. Blissed-out and loose for once. John had better leave soon so Sherlock can crawl back to bed and burrow under the blankets for his shag nap. Or an extended recording session in his mind palace.
Back then he’d been pacing the living room carpet threadbare, and no amount of hair pulling had seemed to help his thoughts the way it usually did. Usually it calmed him down and centered him and pulled new surprising thoughts out. That time, it had just made him more irritated.
Sometimes John tugs the shirt back; absent-mindedly pushing his thumb underneath the trousers, and Sherlock has to hold his breath and will his heart to slow down. The shirt fabric gets pushed a little bit down and under, and as this causes John's trousers to ride a little lower, it is always followed by a little upwards tug of his belt and trouser waistline. This push, tug and lift happens in just a few seconds, by automation from John's part, but for Sherlock it feels like an entire seduction.
“I know. I was surprised as well, but… Just seeing you pull them on this morning, like nothing, and thinking of you walking around like that all day, just for me. God! When you came home it was all I could do not to… I don’t know. I came the moment I pulled you in my mouth. Thinking where that cock had been all day. Almost came before that even, exploring all those waistbands."
He wonders what kinds of clothing related charts and measurements there are in Sherlock’s mind palace – somewhere there in the richly draped ateliers reserved for clothing kink. Is there a new shelf or a drawer being opened for double pants underneath straight trousers right this minute?
None of it is stationary of course. John's even breaths let the fabrics move gently and evenly. Sometimes John moves a little, tiny adjustments to his posture. Sometimes he takes a larger breath. Mostly the general arrangement of the clothing stays the same, but those brief moments make the game.
John could not look back up after all. He watched enthralled as Sherlock's cock started filling and his own cock jumped in immediate reply, so close. Sherlock's robe was open all the way down and while the opening was not large it nevertheless left nothing to be guessed. His long penis nestled in a bed of almost black curly pubic hair – figured the bastard had thick luscious hair down there too – and his balls were even and inviting and the whole parcel was simply breathtaking.
"I wish I could get inside, I wish I could live in your pants, John", Sherlock breathes, so close to John's groin now and so breathy and moaning that John has to bite his lip.
Their breaths came in small gasps and they could not kiss. All of their concentration had now zeroed into the one and only important point, the one important point of contact. Sherlock was leaning against John, his arms trembling against the door, he was making a keening sound and his eyes were watering. John was growling and biting his lower lip in a convulsive lock and his hands were squishing Sherlock's butt cheeks hard, keeping him close in a vice like grip.
He’d been in the middle of a frustratingly nagging cold case. A daughter and an estranged mother, mysteriously paid bills, and a disappeared cabinet. Now that he thought about it, John had been right, it
The point was, he needed to do something about it now. They could not continue in this state of unease. John had started something, and Sherlock had liked it, and what had happened had changer them both. They could not go back to what they had had before, but neither did they seem able to move forward. They were at an unhappy impasse.
The details of the case had slowly dispersed to be replaced by the feel of his feet against the rough of the train upholstery, the smell of mud and sweat in the car, imported by the dozens and dozens of travelers traipsing in and out of the car every day, the sharpness of John's clavicle under his skull, and the steady rise and fall of John's chest as he’d breathed under Sherlock.
"You berk,” he huffs, “of course I know I'm wearing two pairs of pants. Of course I did it on purpose.”
Sherlock's eyes never leave him as he takes his cup and plate and deposits them into the sink. He feels a little conspicuous still and blushes when he shrugs into his jacket and grabs his bag.
“Don’t worry”, Sherlock smirked, “He’s not going to find any help from that old dodger. His lawyer is the one who messed it all up in the first place. The Carousel can stay. Or keep rotating. Whatever.”
As they emerge minutes later, they lean their foreheads together, their groins are pressed hard against each other and Sherlock is fingering the double collars of John’s shirts, his other hand grabbing a fist full of the shirts around John’s waist, keeping John close.
Most often, though, Sherlock just has to rely on the tiny observations he makes on the movement of John's shirt. He has perfected this skill after all, feeling itchy and snappish all day, if he does not know exactly what layers John is wearing. If Sherlock just has the five or ten minutes observation time, while John is making his coffee and perhaps a bit of toast, Sherlock has to be smart about it.
It sometimes happened when he was with John that his mind started wandering. The importance of whatever he was obsessing over slowly vanished as other, different things, flooded his mind. It had happened that time as well, when John's palm had rested against his belly, hidden there in their cocoon of warmth. It must have happened gradually, because he’d been thinking about the barn at first, and then he’d been thinking about the killer, and then, at some point, Sherlock had realized that John’s palm was smoothing small circles over his stomach, and that he’d not, in fact, been thinking about the case in some time.
He won't though. He stands his ground, his hands still on his belt, waiting for Sherlock to open his eyes again. This is not about undressing, this is about dressing and this is for Sherlock.
“He couldn't have been a particularly ferocious beast if he had a pink nose, Sherlock”, John had pointed out, but Sherlock had been indignant. “Why ever not?” he'd complained, “one's nose colour does not determine how brilliant one is.”
They were standing very close. As they looked, unable to move a muscle, it quickly became apparent that something was imminent. Sherlock had probably noticed it before John did, having done his calculations of lengths and prospective growths and his own size and all the angles in question. But as the events escalated John's eyes widened and his breathing became ragged and yes, oh god yes, they were standing close enough to tough.
The case had been solved in just under an hour, but the ghostly feeling of John's hand on his ankle had lingered much longer.
The first thing they did was to take a cab to the home of the last shop owner who’d lost his ice cream parlour, the Icy Carousel. Really what a stupid name!
How hot do you feel at the moment on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is a little bit chilly and 10 is hot enough to start shedding clothes?
“I have to go to work”, John pants against Sherlock's lips even as he grips Sherlock’s shoulders tighter. They lean their foreheads together to breathe.
He’d been swimming in a pool where the waters of these two worlds mixed; the real world and the one that had felt more and more real by every passing breath. The waters were gradually mingling and swirling in together and creating confused but pretty shapes on the surface. He’d asked the John in his dream – the one who was now wearing nothing but Sherlock's dressing gown, for some delightful reason – “So is this where you pull me close and seduce me by serial cuddling?”
John is careful not to draw things out, as much as he wishes he could. He knows it is the curious juxtaposition of the lurid and the commonplace that Sherlock is drawn to, the extreme sensuality he finds in John's ordinary dressing. The complete normality of the actions somehow amping up his pleasure to unimaginable heights.
, he sends, and figuring out how to find the little heart shape takes him so long that John's following text arrives before he sends his.
John knows Sherlock likes the next part, the moment when John pushes the hem of his shirt under his trousers. He feels especially conscious of his movements now; the way the palm of his hand slides first against his shirt and then against his pants while the the top of his hand brushes against the inside of his trousers. The feeling of in between. He wonders if it's that feeling Sherlock imagines as well.
Had a bathroom ghost hovered above them just then, they certainly would have made a bizarre scene. Flush against each other, muscles contracting and quivering, tiny jerks of their hips and then both of them freezing at the exact same moment. The sandy haired man's face in an angry fierce grimace, his eyes squeezed close, a guttural sound of sheer power erupting from his throat. The dark curly haired man's eyes wide open but unseeing, brimming with tears that were already streaming down his flushed cheeks, his face a picture of agony and amazed revelation as he yelled the highest loudest and longest yell that bathroom had ever heard.
“So”, Sherlock said. This was getting a little too convoluted and a little too far from the main point for his liking. He needed to get the conversation back to the right tracks.
John feigns he didn't hear it and reaches up to grab a shirt. He is nervous, so he just takes one, not really noticing which one it is. He takes it off the hanger, shakes it and flips it to his back to slide one arm into a sleeve. His hands are shaking slightly, and he has to bite his lip. He desperately wants to take a peak at Sherlock's face, but he can't risk turning, because he doesn't think he could hold his nonchalance if he did.
As he reaches to grab the coffee from the middle shelf, John can feel his confidence growing. The double cuffs do move a little weird around his wrists, but then he can hear Sherlock fidgeting in his chair. Any second now...
As John plops the third button in, Sherlock comes, shivering, and his gasp sounding like a surprised exclamation, his cock spurting semen into his hand, but also onto his t-shirt and all over his dressing gown. He spurts again as John continues closing his buttons and when they are all done, Sherlock finally closes his eyes as the final tremors of his orgasm course through his body.
John laughed out loud with that, “That’s just brilliant. I can already see the headlines: ‘Sherlock Holmes saves London’s finest cones’, ‘Holmes for the rescue: your ice cream is safe when Sherlock Holmes patrols the streets!’”
Just a little longer now; he’d want John to be truly asleep, he didn’t want to startle him before he was completely under. Just a little longer now.
Sherlock remembered having looked at John scathingly. No way had he been willing to take his coat off, he’d been cold enough as it was, thank you very much.
John lay in Sherlock's arms, panting with exhaustion. He needed a shower as his body was covered in cum and sweat. "Jesus John..."
John and Sherlock lay together in a warm cocoon of limbs when they woke up for their first day in Ireland. "Good morning husband." John grinned at Sherlock. "Good morning husband." He smiled back and pulled him impossibly closer. "Ouch."
Almost half an hour later John pressed half of his Cinnabon cinnamon bun towards Sherlock. “They are very good just really REALLY big.” He laughed even as Sherlock scarfed his down.
"John what the hell is the matter with you?" Sherlock snapped then growled as John grabbed his face and stuck it against the window.
"Not now!" Sherlock shouted making Anderson smirk. "Oh so right now is a bad time for a drugs bust? Ooh he must be hiding something good!" Sally said with glee, for she still believed him to not only be a fraud but a killer as well. "Seriously Lestrade this is an extremely bad time for you to do this… Why are you doing it anyway?" John asked making Lestrade sigh. "I have been trying to call Sherlock for the last two days and not only he has not answered a single one of them but he never responded to any of my texts. So that automatically means that I have to do a drugs bust since that is the only thing that would keep him from answering." Greg honestly looked saddened by the fact and even Sherlock knew that this duty weighed on him.
Mycroft watched as the two men bickered back and forth, glad to see that they had their equilibrium back.
"Are you sure?" Mycroft kept asking as they went down the high way. Lily looked up from where she was cuddled up to Sherlock. "Yes I'm sure. We were not harmed in anyway what so ever and all these injuries are from sleeping in the woods." She snapped and gratefully took the bottle of water that Greg handed her.
“I’m packing for Scotland, which you two should be doing as well.” He said with a sigh and ignored the two muttering behind him. “We’ve already finished packing…”
"Well he did come for us and it seems as though he is making plans to keep us…so I think we have a good chance of being kept. But just in case I am not getting my hopes up till I have solid proof." Lily responded as they walked over to John and Sherlock.
When his vision cleared the first view he had was of the ground between his feet. Greg had pressed his head between his knees.
John smiled down at her then wrapped his arms around her shoulders. "Alright…and I'm sorry about the unicorns…so you all sit down I've made dinner and before you say anything you are all eating, so no arguments." John remarked at the detective gave the children a guilty look. "I guess ice cream wasn't the best idea after all…" he whispered to his children as John went over to the stove. "How was the hospital?" Sherlock asked as John sat with them at the newly cleaned table.
"No one yet…Anthea I want EVERYONE questioned, I don't care how long they have worked for me, yes everyone." Mycroft growled into his phone then took a look at his brother who was holding Johns hand as hard as he could, trying to keep his anxiety over the children at bay. He couldn't help but feel guilty as he saw the damage the kid's absence took on his brother.
John grinned and winked at his husband before turning swiftly on his knees (He was going to feel that tomorrow) pulling the edge of the black garter back, then firing it in such a way that it soared above the crowd like a fluffy bird. That happened to find itself landing right in Mycrofts lap. "Oh my dear I think I love you." Sherlock gasped when he saw what his new husband had done. "You only 'think' you love me?" John grinned as he gave his husband another kiss.
"Ta…care to share?" John asked with a smile that faded when he took a good look at the expression on the girls face.
You also get to see some of the old characters that come back into play (Mrs. Holmes I presume?) So here's a synopsis of the last three chapters of this story not including the sequel (or the chapter notes)
After the paint incident Moriarty tried a new tactic to win the twins over without having them fight. he used a tactic that had won over numerous men and woman. A tactic that, when used correctly, can be the most devistating weapon in his arsenal.
Lucian smiled as he held wandered through the college campus, his mind somewhere in oblivion where colors swirled and lines connected. He was too busy thinking about his next art project to notice exactly where he was going. But his feet knew the path to take to get to his class, having traveled there many times before.
"What a Manky Pikey" Raz cursed making them grimace in discomfort. As an orphan himself he hated when children were forced onto the street simply because they were rejected by their parents. Parents who are supposed to love their children unconditionally. " 'Ats 'is name then?" he snarled.
The woman looked like the cat that got the canary. “Captain Watson, we have a consenting parent right here. Just because your fucking him doesn’t give you any parental rights.”
Sherlock immediately pounced asking question after question in Greek. “Sherlock, let him answer at least one question before attacking him with more.” John scolded and gave the boy a pleasant smile.
Deborah looked down at the floor and sighed heavily. "She's missing her Papa but otherwise she's just…" She held her hands out to her side.
"Alright it started a few days ago when Lily came into my room and sat on my bed. Then she started asking all these questions and I couldn't help it. I snapped at her. After that every time I turn around one of them is just there…staring at me….and it's not just her…its both of them…and they chatter."
Harriet frowned at that and leaned past John to look at the kids before grabbing his arm and pulling John away.
The tuxes: pulled out of my head and you have no idea how many time's i've misspelled boutonniere...i think my computer gives me a small electric shock every time i misspell that now...Seriously try to spell that without looking...not the easiest, especially when you failed french.
“Ah, they have a tendency to do that…Should probably replace them since I took out the sensors a while back.” Sherlock said absentmindedly then regretted it at the glare from John.
"I believe they are testing their boundaries which I have done a time or two…" Sherlock muttered comfortingly to his blogger. "I say we sell them to the Chinese…cheap labor and all that." John groaned as Sherlock started stroking his back. "Ha…Other than that how was your day?" Sherlock asked as John snuggled impossibly closer.
John looked up with a smile. "Good news…Kids are home." He smiled as the twins burst through the door. "Alright you two pause and tell me what you were yelling about on the stairs."
"Are you sure?" Sherlock asked as he palmed his best friends face with one hand and rubbed a thumb over his bottom lip, pulling it open slightly.
"They're kind of… freaking me out." Sebastian admitted to Jim's bemusement. "Sebby…You're a cold blooded killer…A master assassin… they're twelve…How can they possibly be freaking you out?"
The boy stared at Lucian before reaching into his pocket to pull out a cell phone. "Here, You call your parents inside while you get cleaned up. Then my grandmother, she feeds you."
“It's alright we'll get you home." Donovan said sweetly to the twins only to turn towards the detective with a snarl. "You are a sick fuck, kidnapping kids like this.”
The next morning John and Sherlock were faced with two raging headaches, one pair of handcuffs, and two twins holding a glass of water in one hand and two paracemetol in the other. "Take these, drink this...your shirts are ridiculous..." Both said at the same time before turning around and walking back to their room to laugh at their misfortune. "I blame you, you know."
Sherlock lifted an arm and slammed his hand on the edge of the door, keeping it open. "I don't blame you for not wanting to see me. But please let me speak, and then tell me what you think. But please let me speak."
John just gave a small smile and pressed back against his best friend as he saw the twins slowly approach from the side to embrace him as well.
"It's right over there, but we have to go around the cliffs to get there!" Lily smiled and grabbed her brother's hand to start dragging him towards the church.
Shut up will you? Lily thought to herself as Professor Munch droned on while he wrote a complicated problem up on the blackboard. "Anyone who can solve this problem will automatically be given an 'A+' for the year and will not have to do any work for the rest of the year." Professor Munch said smugly leaving the students to stare at the Taylor polynomial on the board.
She had to be honest. The twins were starting to freak her out with their children of the corn impression. “Alright how about this? I’ll start by telling you what I know about you. I know that both of you suffer from symptoms related to PTSD not just Lily. Lucian you are Jumpy and easily startled in any place you don’t feel comfortable in. Both of you have issues with sleeping or staying asleep. Lily you have night terrors and Lucian you have nightmares. These pertain to a certain event in your past. But here’s what I don’t know. I don’t know what happened to either of you and will not unless you tell me yourselves. Now I would like to get to know both of you better but I cannot unless you two actually speak to me. Now how would you like to start? You can tell me what was the last thing that happened to you two if you wish.”
“Most of the time was them arguing over what type of pen was best. Apparently Lily prefers the uni-ball pens while Lucian likes Ener-gel pens. And there’s a difference between them. But they both hate bics.” John sighed and sipped his tea.
"Alright no more poker...How about monopoly?" John asked trying to think of another game they could play to pass the time.
"Hopefully tower of London if not the bottom of the Thames." Lily's voice made even the iceman flinched. She did not like this woman not one bit.
Their night was filled with frivolity, an enormous amount of alcohol, strippers (Male strippers), three men getting arrested and one man getting chinned by Sherlock. (To be fair the man did grope the man's army doctor commenting on how much he would love HIS d...It didn't go over well.)
The twins flinched at the shriek and started to back up slowly, hands clasped. "Their mother isn't in their lives and if I have my way she never will be again and I don't care how this looks they are MINE and nothing you can say or do will change that fact." Sherlock growled even as his head snapped back as if his mother had slapped him. "nonsence Sherlock every child needs their mother and to be honest you wouldn't make a good father, you can't even take care of yourself. Now sweeting where is your mother?"
That night Sherlock crept from his bed to sneak upstairs into Lily's room, finding her awake and reading a book.
My children are not cretins and they are definitely 'young pliable minds' to play with. You WILL leave them out of this. And don't act like you don't wish you had children at all never mind the fact that they would never be as good as mine SH
“Ah, they have a tendency to do that…Should probably replace them since I took out the sensors a while back.” Sherlock said absentmindedly then regretted it at the glare from John. “In that case you get to help.”
So far, John had only seen Sherlock apologize to him as well as the twins. It was sweet to be honest.
"WHAT?" came a yell from the other room making the army doctor jump up from his seat as Sherlock came barreling in. "Sherlock calm down!" Mycroft yelled at his younger brother and grabbed his arm only to be shaken off.
"Hey John." They said in unison mainly to watch him fidget. "How did he survive?" Lily asked ignoring her brother who poked her with the sharp end of a pencil.
"We really did fall asleep on the couch…" John's gruff voice cut through the darkness of the room making the twins jump and stare with fear in their eyes. What had they been through in their short lives to make them so suspicious of everyone? John thought to himself and pitied them. "Listen…I'm not going to lie to you. There was a time when your father…had some drug issues and besides some experiments that had some…well gaseous effects and the odd cigarette now and again… he's been clean and if he wasn't…There is NO way in hell I would expose you to that…I swear that all you saw were signs of exhaustion." John said vehemently watching the twins grow less weary of him. "We figured that if he wasn't a junky then he was a former one…That's the only kind of person our mother hung around with…" Lily said watching Johns eyes grow sad.
"We'll find them later right now you need to calm down… Mycroft what are their names?" John asked as gently as he could. "Lucian and Lily…they are fifteen years old, Lily is a vegetarian while Lucian is not and even though they dress…differently they are very much alike. They are both highly protective of each other and if they think that their twin could be harmed by something…or someone they will not hesitate to either take out the threat or remove themselves from the perceived danger…as you have seen." Mycroft scolded earning a glare from both John and Sherlock.
don't kill me please remember that there is a method to my madness...or is it a madness to my method?? *walks off humming the Imperial March*
Moriarty and Moran watched from the window as Lucian happily drew in the garden and his sister walked around taking pictures of everything.
"No I do!" Kyle announced as he walked over and held up the pillow watching as each man took a silver and gold band to place on the other mans finger.
"That's what I thought. Now come along." John smiled at the twins and headed back out into the living room to talk with Greg. "Alright here's the plan. We're taking the children with us. That's about it." John said as he sat down and gratefully accepted a cup of tea. Greg smiled evilly as a thought occurred to him.
“With what? Us existing?” Lily asked as she and Lucian managed to maneuver themselves between the two.
Sherlock was immediately by their side, noting the wariness in both their eyes. “Yea I don’t like shots either.” Was all he could think to say.
“Why do we have to come here? You’re a doctor can’t you just do it at home?” Lucian grumbled and huddled inside his coat.
"So we get into a fight and he goes running to you? Or was it Greg?" Sherlock growled then yelped as Mycroft hit him again, this time in the shin.
"A shirt…why?" Lily sighed at the question knowing that no matter what she said it would not be the right answer. "We'll get you some real clothes...are those combat boots? Really? We'll get you some heels and a pretty dress! Why we'll even have your hair done, maybe some highlights…"
Sherlock stared at John for a second. John has never missed a chance to say that Sherlock got something wrong. Ever. So for John to do so now, threw Sherlock through a giant loop. “And who should we tell?” he finally answered.
"Yes Myc I was just….oh alright…" Greg grinned as Mycroft Holmes grabbed his hand and began to pull him towards the bedroom. "Leave the towel Gregory."
"Wait...I know this smell...It's...God what is it?...Olives?" She asked shaking her head to clear the memories.
Of course neither twin would let Sherlock know they were doing it. Which made it even more fun when a few weeks from now Sherlock would remember he 'had' something and go looking for it. Only to tear apart the flat before giving up.
“I am in agreement with Sarah on this. They’ve been subjected to much in their life and I fully believe having you tend to any injuries would be the best idea.” Sherlock remarked turning to look at the sleeping children on the couch.
"Just thinking about the old days dear. It's been very quiet now with the twins out of the flat. Perhaps we should get a pet I was thinking." John said with a smile.
"Lily we've been running for forever, we need to stop to at least get our bearings." Lucian said as he ran alongside her. "Alright lets climb one of these trees and see if we can see a town or something." She replied and started to climb.
"Yep." Lucian said while Lily just gave him a thumb up from the floor. This made Sherlock suspicious and he determined that he needed to talk to Lily about her silence once the woman left.
"Nope not up for discussion. My lovers favorite uncle just died and I need to be there for him. And I can't leave the twins alone as that would be irresponsible (see? I learned from the last time). Now you would say that they can stay with Mycroft but he's in the Dominican Republic doing…something. And they aren't staying with my parents or Lestrade…"
Sherlock turned and before John could say anything replied to the insulting man. "Sir if anything, Scotland is the Canada of England."
"What it's a natural bodily function and the male of nearly every kind of animal goes through it so why be subtle?" Lily asked him making Sherlock blink. "Point proven very nicely thank you." He smiled at her.
Lucian sighed and sat down next to her, placing an arm across her shoulders. "And how do you break out of a gilded caged Lily?"
Lily just phased out the woman's voice as she tried to decipher the meaning behind Trymmans words. "Amalee enough, Lily may have a flowery name my dear but if I'm not mistaken that is all you have in common besides gender. Ah, Travis, would you please see them to the drawing room I believe some tea is in order after your journey. Oh and don't worry about your bags we'll get someone to bring them to your rooms. Now John, tell me how you and the twins are fairing with my son."
"Lucian…I see smoke…And I think a church!" Lily cried with glee and started to scramble down the tree with Lucian following after.
When they pulled up in front of the flat there was a shortish woman with long blond hair standing in front, looking very angry.
Just then Lily popped up from behind the couch to grab her father's shoulder. "Gladstone is Lucian's."
"Hmm normally that's what I would do but Sherlock managed to kill our phone, Mrs. Hudson is away for the day and Lily has my phone incase either of the twins have to stay after school." John lied easily as he poured the tea. "Actually might I borrow your phone? Thank you." John smiled and ignored the shouted accusations that he hid the phone in some adolescent example of revenge for the plant incident that came from the living room following several crashes. "John wasn't there a thing…?" Sherlock shouted as he tipped over the couch as though he just remembered. "Oh yes…Mycroft I have a gift for you would you please be a dear and fetch it for me? It's in the bedroom….Oh Sherlock…" John smiled through gritted teeth.
Sherlock just sighed and looked up at his husband. "Wait is this why the tailor made me wear a garter?" He growled in his husband's hair. "I'm not going to answer that question."
"What she had been trained in martial arts or was a highly trained assassin?" she countered smiling at her new friend. "Those are special circumstances…a man should never initiate it." He responded hesitantly then frowned at her thoughtful look.
Moriarty struggled not to roll his eyes. The boy was obviously jealous over the time that Sebastian spent with his precious little sister. But he wasn't about to tell him that. "She obviously needs you more then you need her Luce. So stay away from her for a little while and teach her whose boss!" HE said as he looked over the paperwork from china.
Oh that hurt! Well perhaps that lovely little girl of yours would be more willing to play then you are M
The detective reached up, running his fingers through the fur carefully, before taking the dog tags in his hands, rereading them and making sure that his conclusion was true. That this was John Watson. Sherlock forced himself to relax, closing his eyes briefly as he tried to slow his breathing. Cautiously, he reached up, scratching the underside of John’s chin lightly, listening and categorizing the purr he emitted carefully into his mind palace. The wolf relaxed further on top of Sherlock, almost all of his weight holding the detective down. As time passed, the two flatmates stayed that way, drawing warmth from each other, one having too many questions while another didn’t have the proper mouth to answer.
The detective didn't know if the worst was that John had noticed it was Max's, or that he had removed the last marks of Max's existence. It probably wasn’t the man’s real name.
The doctor's stomach was obviously too thin- he was nearly thinner than Sherlock. Perhaps he'd even manage to find something to eat. If he could eat at all. The man winced lightly as he drank from a water bottle that he had brought, opening it for the first time since he'd touched it. His stomach couldn't handle
The words were painful. More painful than he had ever heard or experienced before. So, it was it. He couldn't breath, couldn't feel anything past the burning wound inside his chest. There was nothing to fix. How foolish he had been. How terrible was the mistake he did. "...John." He slid down on the ground, helplessly, his legs giving up. He couldn't. It was too painful. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry." The detective kept whispering in the middle of the street more for himself than for anything else.
Sherlock didn’t feel himself move, feel himself be grabbed until it was too late, until the world was a blur around him and he was… pinned. Pinned under the heavy creature. It nuzzled at his neck, licking lightly as if it would calm down the horrible, shaking sobs that were escaping Sherlock as if it would simply make his fear and panic go away. It held him there, the paws making a cage, as its heavy weight rested on the human’s body. "Let me go, please—"  Sherlock choked out again, gasping for breath. The creature barely moved, but it shuffled, exposing its own neck. Something around it glinted, a metal necklace of sorts. It wasn’t suffocating the thing, holding enough slack so that if it were upright, it would rest on the space between its collar bones.
I wrote this little continuation of my oneshot for greysnowflake1212. Thank you for requesting it! I didn't really know howww to end it, so if it falls a bit flat, i'm so sorry.
Sherlock didn't leave the room. He kept staring to John, heartbroken by his words. He thought about Max, about the knife deeply buried into his forehead. About his life, when he was still warm and alive.
He had tried. John had only given him a look a look and had taken it away from him. The detective pouted, waiting a few seconds while tapping the floor with his foot, louder and louder as seconds passed. "John!" There was a resonating growl from the other side, a hoarse shout accompanying it. "John?" The detective backed away from the door, annoyance turning into fear. That night, at Baskervilles, John hadn’t been the only one fearing. In fact, some deep aversion (sadness had turned into fear) towards dogs had taken residence in him ever since he’d… since he’d lost Redbeard.
"Max. You knew. You didn't tell me." John angrily walked up to the man, gripping his collar and pinning him to the wall, "Why didn't you tell me, Mycroft? Just another bothersome thing for you to avoid because we're all silly little goldfish? You bastard!”
Glancing to the bathtub, he only saw John's legs laced with his own, their laugh. The scent of soap and shampoo. But he didn't see Max. He felt him, like a shadow ready to come back if he focused on him. Still, the first memory he had was with John.
And of course, we all know whose writing graced this piece that would be dreadful if I had written it myself.
Nobody knew him but Sherlock. Nobody would remember him, but Sherlock. "How long did I sleep?" He asked absently, entering the living-room.
Sherlock didn't wake up, but he felt something wet and hot on his face. Tears. He had been crying from happiness.
Sherlock himself looked as if he hadn't slept in months- but that couldn't have been possible. He had been with Max. Max would've taken care of Sherlock. John balanced Sherlock off of him, propping him up straight before standing. He bent again, slipping a hand under his sleeping detective's neck and sliding the other under his waist. He ignored the way his body protested, carrying a weight while being so weak. It didn't matter. John concentrated on Sherlock, quietly moving him to his bedroom as he laid him down and pull the duvet over him. He closed the door and walked out, settling a kettle on the stove and forcing himself not to think too much.
John felt his head spin, eyes defocusing before he blinked harshly, bringing himself back using pain as determination. The wound had cut through Johns shoulder neatly and the amount of bleeding was usual for such wounds. But still, it was familiar. Horribly familiar. John looked at it closer, his back also bleeding down and into and onto his jeans. The bullet had gone through his scar exactly, not even a millimetre off. Through johns unending hate, the man duly acknowledged how good of a shot Moriarty was.
John reeled back, pulling himself away violently from the detective as if he'd been burnt. He had been. He had been burnt, branded, and scarred.
Perhaps this was just one of Sherlock's bit not good moments, his inhumanness confusing him- forgetting that he could’ve simply talked to John. That's what it seemed to simplify down to- if it had only been about the sex. The doctor set his phone down and rubbed his hands across his face. Even if Sherlock's hadn't talked to him about it, then at least John should've. The doctor shouldn't have compromised his sensual wants without even asking his then-boyfriend. They should've talked because the pure and simple fact was that Sherlock liked to take it rough- and John liked to give it rough.
At this point, Max was curled up on the ground. He could no longer stand, it was too painful. He kept staring to Sherlock, the last sight he ever wanted to see. The only picture that was worthy to be brought with him to the next world.
“Work time for the grown-ups, Max. Got to go kidnap some priests. Take care of my Johnny boy, I’ll be home before he knows it!” The man bent over the unconscious ex-army man, pressing a small kiss to his sleeping beauty’s lips before pressing his fingers into the bleeding hole of ripped flesh, earning no response from the unconscious doctor. “Oh, and Maxie, patch yourself up if you can.”
A creature walked lazily, sitting right across from John and looking straight up into his eyes with scary smartness. "Oh fucking--" John moved with slow movements, backing away slowly as he perched higher on the sofa, the leather providing the older man with a firm grip as he seated himself on the backrest of the long thing. Still keeping his eyes on the... beast, the doctor reached for his phone with shaky hands. As both John and the... wolf listened to the notifications springing up on Sherlock's phone as John frantically texted his cry for help. The wolf-- the huge wolf, the too big to be a goddamn wolf wolf narrowed its eyes before doing something akin to scoffing as it pranced up and onto the seat of the sofa, tugging at the base of John's jeans.
of doing that again." He turned his head to face the detective, looking eye-level at the slouching man. His old mind supplied a perfect "
What if it wasn't one of Sherlock's bit not goods. The detective knew everything and was gradually increasing his knowledge on how to be human. He would've known exactly what this would do- that John was more clever than he was thought to be. That he would find out eventually.
"I don't care." John shrugged to himself, "I don't care that you didn't find me sooner. Because I would've died in there." He took a moment, thinking quietly. "Maybe I would've preferred that you hadn't found me. It was nice. He had knives and guns all around. Would've taken me absolutely nothing to run a blade in my heart or pull the trigger at my temple.”
He couldn't grab them, couldn't realize what was going on, but the atmosphere was sweet and soft, comfortable as comfortable when John stroked his curls for hours.
Written with Camille, who is a terrible influence but I'm addicted to her like an anarchist is to taking down a government. (Inside joke, no one worry, pls.)
The pair of them sat side-by-side, knowing that any word from either of them might rip the fragile human out of John once again. The doctor looked straight ahead, his hands resting on his knees and his sore back pressed flush to the wall. He allowed for a few minutes to pass before he spoke up, feeling more stable now. He allowed for voice to trickle into his words, taking on the same tone that he would've used to calm Sherlock before all this happened. He cleared his throat.
Where my lovely friend Camille has gotten Mycroft to get on all of our nerves. And Sherlock, too. They're both cocks. And she's a fantastic writer.
The only bedroom door that could be opened, opened. John leant further back into his chair, listening for Signs of Sherlock, but was not very surprised when he didn't hear any. For all he knew, the detective had opened the door, just to note how the dust swirled in this dim moonlight. But what did surprise John was the sound of heavy claws against the wooden floor. He stood, muttering a small, "Sherlock?" As he looked for the source of the sound. And soon, it made itself known.
The doctor felt his pocket buzz with a notification. He didn't even bother looking, sobs racketing his body as his emotions blocked him from breathing. He gasped loudly and shakily, hyperventilating with the water traveling down his face and making his face splotchy and red. The doctor grasped at the ground, trying to find something to hold, anything to ground him, but ended up turning, curling in on himself while resting his head against the railing and clinging to the metal as if it could take the fact of the matter away. His pocket buzzed once more and the doctor hastily thrusted his left hand into his coat, pulling out the device before chucking it into the water behind him. It was fruitless to force his breathing to even out. John had
. That's how much Moriarty had broken him. But it wasn't as if Jim had starved John on purpose. The doctor had been the one to do this to himself, refusing the spider's spoon feeding more than he had accepted it. He set the bottle down after managing sips, his head slightly dizzy at how much pain that it had caused him.
it's surprisingly fun to read what you've written. i'm actually having a blast updating this fic. 🥧 here's some nice apple pie, for you lovlies.
Though he was drenched, John hummed quietly to himself as he unlocked the door and bound upstairs, smiling at Mrs Hudson in greeting as she poked her head out to see who it was. The doctor walked upstairs and threw the door open, holding out the bag of biscuits, “Brought you these. God- it’s horrible outside,” he said, shaking himself before looking up at Sherlock- Sherlock kissing another man. The doctor dropped his bag in surprise, backing up. Perhaps this was just a hallucination- the simple result of a bad day. But the doctor knew well that his eyes weren’t betraying him. His heart was. It was beating loud and clear as he dashed down the stairs again, the only person he trusted having betrayed him.
John sat on the bed, nodding to himself before crawling under the duvet and looking up, glad that he'd turned off the light before he’d gotten in the shower. John looked up at the clear, empty, boring ceiling, afraid to go to sleep, wanting to stay clear of the nightmares. Tonight, memories of the war wouldn't haunt him.
Choosing not to dwell on his sadness now, Sherlock quietly, slowly tip-toed down the stairs again, his heart beating erratically. What was John doing? How could he have not told him of a guest or a pet or whatever that monster was? Before Sherlock could reach for the third step down, the door broke behind him. The detective flinched, his mind screaming at him to run, though his muscles stayed stiff and firm, only moving to shake uselessly. It was moving closer towards him, one heavy sound of paws hitting the wooden floor at a time, nearing him, panting quietly. Sherlock tried to back away, to keep his head down and just move, but it didn’t work— not in the slightest.
John barely registered the baritone words- floating unconsciously through his mind. He had nothing left. But the darkness that surrounded him and blood that was draining out of him. His breathing was shallow, diaphragm and intercostal muscles not having enough oxygen to even go through their respiratory process. It was almost bliss, the quiet, the uncaring. Just John in his world, floating away. Through the peace, he felt a sharp pain. Of course, the man wasn't conscious, but that didn't mean he didn't feel it. In fact, the pain was repeating itself over, and over, as John laid, unable to scream or grit his teeth at it. He snapped out of his darkness for the briefest of seconds, shouting deeply before he succumbed to it again. His world was red now. Fire, pain. It surrounded him like wisps of blood. It wasn't ending. The doctor felt a small tear run out from the corner of his closed left eye as he realized what was truly happening.
John refused to love Sherlock. He was done. The doctor found his way back into the busy streets of London, wandering and ignoring his on-fire shoulder. The saddest part of it all was that John understood why. He understood that the detective had gotten bored. That he needed more that John but needed John all the same. Well sucked to be Sherlock because the doctor was going someplace that he prayed the detective wouldn't follow him. John himself didn't know what place it was but figured if he wandered around enough-- he would find it.
John looked down at what Sherlock was pointing as. Better them gone than a promise broken. Amusement fluttered through him. "Mrs Hudson'll add it to our rent, nothing to worry about."  He picked at the tile lightly, memorizing the lines along with other memories of the bathroom. The blotch of discolouring from an experiment gone wrong, a dent in the wall from when Sherlock had hit it hard- fainting from low blood sugar during a case. The small blood stains that refused to leave from when John had patched Sherlock up after a chase. This was home.
He collapsed next to John, touching his face with shaky hands. "No, no, no. I love you. We're going to be so happy together. Just... Just stay with me."
Rose for lovely Camille and her talent to put up with my inconsistent responses and missed deadlines.
Reading the messages, Sherlock curled up on himself. Max was sleeping on the sofa, letting the detective enjoy the bed on his own. He had insisted to stay despite Sherlock's attempts to push him away.
John felt himself slacken, his body falling to the ground. He would’ve stayed that way if it hadn’t been for Sherlock’s voice snipping through his head. The doctor forced his eyes open, looking around hazily. The man could feel his blood pounding, whole body in rhythmic beat as he momentarily closed his eyes, threatening to succumb back into unconsciousness.
Sherlock felt asleep eventually. He couldn't know when nor how it happened, but the exhaustion won and his body relaxed as it reminded the endless happiness he had shared with John. Vaguely, he felt he was moving, but the sleep, as a heavy pressure kept him limp. Without knowing why, he had the instincts that his dreams were easier than the reality to live.
After painful moments of the creature watching, observing the detective, it moved closer, sniffing at him. Sherlock felt his heart skip a beat, his pale skin whitening further as it snarled, erratically rubbing its fur against the tall man while growling and snapping its teeth. Sherlock dared one shaky exhale— which the animal clearly did not like. His lower back was nudged by the incredibly large muzzle, which shoved and pushed at him. When the creature received no response, it pushed harder, forcing Sherlock to half tumble and half walk down the stairs. He quickly got to his knees as the wolf approached him, snarling and salivating, its deep blue eyes glowing in the chill night. Sherlock shivered, watching his breath turn white (Oh good God, how he longed for a cigarette right about now) before casting his eyes away from the wolf again. He wanted it gone, wanted it to magically disappear just as it had magically appeared.
John felt his eyes burn, running outside back into the rain, grabbing his coat. His mind replayed the scene over and over again as he simply refused for tears to strike down his face. The doctor wove through the crowd, pushing at people and not bothering to apologize to the blurs that were bypassing him with angry glares. The looks were nothing compared to the expression that Sherlock had worn. The shock and guilt and somehow… the expressions had managed to look evil and alien on him. Sherlock was supposed to be different. Sherlock was supposed to be the only one that wouldn’t hurt him. The doctor chuckled darkly to himself as the naive thought crossed his mind. He ran for hours before finding himself lost along one of the sides of the river Thames. John leant against the railing for support, breathing heavily before simply allowing for his feet to give out. The doctor slid along the railing and onto the floor, salty tears burning through his skin as he felt the sadness finally set in.
The peace was disrupted, though, as the wolf let out a small chortle, looking down at John with its unearthly eyes as it moved closer to the doctor. John looked back, unafraid now, looking back at Sherlock's eyes as he wrapped himself further in the blankets as if they would protect him from the wolf, whose feet hung off the edge of the bed. Still, the doctor didn't move, not wanting to return to the freezing living room-- and besides, Sherlock wouldn't hurt him.
John made his cup of tea, subconsciously making enough for two. His scowled at himself for being so open by Sherlock. Truth be told, it wasn't really the detective that John had to be a prick to. Obviously, the fact that Sherlock was Sherlock was a part of it- but in general, John forced himself to be cold and distant to those around him. He had reverted back to how he had been when Sherlock had died. Sad. Lonely. Dead. Only difference this time was that
the man's mug. But there was still plenty left of the flat that wasn't John's. The extra jacket that hung on the coat rack, the random socks in the bathroom clothes basket. Now that John actually looked, he could practically see a mark of Max on everything of the flat.
i realize that this fic is filled with mistakes. i'll probably go back through, once we're done, and fix all that up. but maybe not, life does have a way to get in the way of plans.
John hadn't answered, and Sherlock's mind got wild. It was out of control, imagining everything that could have happened to John, and especially the worst. It was a rainy day, in London, and John was desperate. Sherlock got up from his sofa, paced into the living-room. Walking without knowing wouldn't bring John back, but it would make him less feel as if he was useless. He needed to act. Needed to do something. Sherlock grabbed his coat and left the flat, without even warning his landlady. Once outside, he shivered. It was getting cold, and night was falling on the city. Sherlock felt his heart aching in an odd way. The scent of the rain was mixed up with this feeling the night would never end.
John Watson had just had a row with the chip and pin machine. And then he’d been nearly run over by the idiot London traffic. And then it had started raining. In short- John Watson was having a terrible day. He had gotten off work early, at least, planning to surprise Sherlock with the biscuits he’d brought him- knowing that it was the only thing that the detective would eat without being forced to have food shoved down his mouth.
Right now, Sherlock would give anything to let John knows he was human. Had always been, even if he had always been scared to show it.
Sherlock couldn't look as John patched up his Max. He obeyed to what the doctor asked, but the sight of the needle plunging into the same skin he had kissed and caressed was too much. He looked away, his heart aching and accelerating, squeezed painfully into his chest.
John pulled back, accepting that physical force never worked on a Holmes. Hell- it most likely wouldn't even ruffle their perfect, posh hair. He backed up, feeling disgusting in his partially dry clothes, and sat down on the bed with resignation, looking up at the man fiercely. "You're wrong." John's voice stayed the same volume, but it lost its fierceness. "You're wrong, Mycroft. He loves Max." His eyes didn't waver from the man's, knowing that it would be taken as a sign of vulnerability- something that John never wanted to show to a Holmes again. Or to anyone else. "For god knows how long," The doctor took in a deep breath, "Maybe he still loves me- but we've lost something and Sherlock found it in someone else." Talking to Mycroft Holmes about feelings surpassed a bit not good. It was deep into No hellish way will this ever happen again. "Are you just here to piss me off and return my mobile or was it something else?" A dark look crossed the man's (unnaturally) snobby face. Perhaps a little set up with Greg and him would fix that.
Over that, he felt his knee give out the tiniest of bits as he moved towards Sherlock, limp evident enough for the ever-observing detective. "Well? Lead the way.”
After Sherlock woke up, he spent a few minutes yawning and rubbing his eyes happily, the haze of his dreams still covering him. He could remember, having dreamed of John's hand touching his cheeks. And then, it had been erased. Crushed under the violent reality coming back. The illusion of having simply
John was bleeding out too quickly. There was no way he would survive if it continued to this pace. "...I'm sorry. I'm so sorry." He whispered, broken, as he grabbed the needle and the vodka. "It's going to hurt. Forgive me…" he said, his voice breaking and cracking with emotions he didn’t bother to hide. As he slid the needle into John's skin, Sherlock found himself unable to breathe any longer.
There was no other way to describe it-- the panic, the odd yelp, the frantic movements as he scrambled to get away from the thing. His tailbone would ache in the morning from the impact, but right now, the doctor only hoped he'd still be alive when the sun arose.
When Sherlock felt the weight of John's gaze on him, he turned his head and looked to the doctor, silently. Listening to the few, careful words. Then, he said his ones, just as carefully, tip-toeing to not break the moment. “You, too John.” He simply said, his heart still pounding loudly into his chest. He almost felt it, the high, the bliss, for one second, nothing would have mattered but the blue, warm artificial bliss pumped into his veins. "...You ruined the tiles." He whispered without any attempt to make John feel guilty, as he tilted his head toward the marks the twisted needles left on the floor.
A hissing noise came from Max's agony, but Sherlock didn't hear. He would always hear John’s heart. John’s life.
The detective scrambled away again, shivering and shaking, his body trembling from both fear and the cold. His experiment was long forgotten, his eyes only holding absolute dread of the creature in front of him. "Please, stop. Let me go, my John— he’ll hunt you. If you hurt… me." Sherlock let out another half-choked sob, knowing he wasn’t going to get out of this alive, knowing that his last words were going to be a pathetic beg. The wolf cocked its head, its eyes seeming to warm as it abruptly sat, its tail swinging this way and that behind it. It crawled slower towards him, head practically on the ground.
vanilla, sweet and gentle one. Not once he had purposely done anything painful to the detective, not once he had teased him for long. It had been slow and boring.
Sherlock had always hated hospitals. He hated the scent of it, and the knowledge of the pain, filling every room. But despite everything, he stayed. For John. He was safe, and now that the adrenaline had faded away... Nothing was left but the loss of the two men he loved the most. "If you have been killed there, you know what would have happened. A case worse than Jack the Ripper. A case of never ending deaths." He hated saying this, but it was the only way he could protect John's life for now. "You have friends, many friends. You are loved. Don't die.”
to all of you who are still reading this craziness of an rp: thank you. here's a flower and some chocolate to get you through this chapter.🌷🍫
Minutes passed and eventually, the wolf moved closer, circling the fallen man a few times while he watched it with half-lidded, cast away eyes. No need to give it any look that it might consider a challenge. John continued to watch his breath whitening in the cold air, now too afraid to even make his eyes follow the creature as it slowly approached him. The doctor flinched as he felt the first brush of soft, barely-curly hair, his muscles more than ready to run-- but before he could, it nuzzled the side of the doctor, forcing him onto his back before it placed a large, steady paw on John to keep him there. Instinctively, John whispered a small, "Brilliant," into the air, watching the animal as it cocked its head, its intelligent eyes lighting up in a... familiar? way. Before John could think too much of it, the creature placed one leg on the other side of the doctor before its back leg joined it, successfully creating a cage of animal limbs, making it impossible for John to escape. This fact was only further heightened when it moved down, its lithe body covering the man-- who had a sudden fear of being crushed by the thing. Still, it supported its own weight, nuzzling into John's neck before letting out a content sigh-like thing, though the erratic heartbeat of the man didn't slow.
And then there was John, who quietly moped to himself as the furnace gave away before his very eyes. He was a grown man, for God's sakes! He was not about to slip a few tears because he had the most annoying prick for a flatmate and that-- the doctor sniffled-- that the heating system was going down. In a matter of minutes, though, John was too cold to even cry. He exhaled, still stranded on their sofa before he curled his knees up, in on himself. Why John hadn't gone up to his room, you may ask? It was because it was literally. glued. shut. "It's for a case, John!" Sherlock had shouted when John had threatened to bring down hell on him. And unfortunately, John had no choice but to go along with it. Because who was he to stand in the way of a case and Sherlock Holmes?
"Yoo-hoo!! Boys!!" Mrs Hudson's voice sounded from the other side of the door to 221B. She didn't wait for a response before the pushed the door open, one hand holding a tray of tea and biscuits. The wolf growled, paws slipping as it ran towards her, snapping its teeth. John wordlessly reacted, throwing himself forward, but missing by half an inch, the creature simply being too fast.
He knocked on the door to 221A, clearing his eyes of tears the best he could and walked in when he was invited for dinner. Mrs Hudson had made flatbread pizza but John was in much less of a state to eat and more of one to simply cease existing. He excused himself to the bedroom, claiming that Sherlock had done an experiment in the doctor's room (though the two of them had started sharing the same room a year or so after Mary had died)- who in turn had been left without a place for the night. His landlady smiled and left him alone, going back to the kitchen to resume her own supper.
Sherlock didn't do this so that John would love him. He knew it was impossible, he no longer deserved the doctor. Did he ever deserve him? He nodded twice before starting to walk, the action neither a confirmation nor a dismissal. There was an actual hospital not so far from the fake one, and Sherlock believed John could make it. He was bleeding much, but not quickly enough for him to go into shock before doctors could fix him. "I'm sorry I didn't manage to find you sooner.”
Sherlock understood what John was implying. Max was still here, between them. And he would always be, because there would always be a sock of a habit Sherlock would have forgotten to delete. Like the man's number, that the detective hadn't erased yet. "John." He said softly, carefully, to show he was sincere. "I don't want you to leave." He felt panicked, thinking about the doctor away from him again. "And.. I'll clean the flat up. I hadn’t had the time to do it yet. But I will. I'll put everything in boxes." He preferred a very alive John over a dead Max. But he couldn't bring himself to get rid of his stuff. Only tidying it up in a corner, to take dust. But at least, there would be something left from the man. He noticed the difficulties John had to drink. The doctor had lost weight, but Sherlock hadn't imagined... hadn’t imagined that it would be a problem to such an extent. "It's your home. It will always be. Please, John.”
Mycroft knew. And so did Sherlock. It had been the first time that John had broken down in front of his addict, tears running over the backside of his fingers and his mouth being clamped shut to prevent sobs. They'd just been texts. But it had been cheating, anyway. John sat back heavily on his bed. He hadn't full out fucked her. He hadn't allowed her to touch him. And he sure as hell didn't shag her as soon as Mary had left the flat- which was exactly what Sherlock had done to John. John Watson had made a mistake in the past, his loyal streak being broken over by silly little Eurus. John sighed, falling back on the bed, not having any energy left to sit up.
He climbed up the stairs, stomping to accentuate his annoyance because the entire world simply had to know that Sherlock was in a terrible mood. Hell, if he could, he’d probably carry around a sign that said, "Don’t breathe in my direction or I can make you
Max glanced down to the bleeding doctor, shivering. He knew what would happen if he disobeyed Moriarty, he had seen enough snipers, spies, assassins, etc being destroyed, crushed, burned alive. He wasn't scared of being killed nor of being in pain, but he was afraid of being sent to Hell.
In the end, it had turned out to be another Holmes. John considered naming a curse after them. The Holmes' Curse. Follows anywhere and makes your life hell.
The point was that- even though he was thought to be an idiot and very much not clever by the detective- John had never missed little bits of information. He'd noticed the barefootedness of his ex-boyfriend. And if Max was any sort of human at all, he would rush to Sherlock's side in rescue.
Anyone want to set me an update schedule? I could do it once a week, you could choose the day. Apparently, I just need to be held accountable.
bit was a lie- and Sherlock probably did, too. But it really was the ultimate goal. Stop loving the man who bedded someone behind your back. The saddest part of the entire matter was that John had a small velvet box hiding in the drawer where he kept his old army uniform- somewhere that Sherlock would never look. The doctor turned and walked away once more, deciding that he'd simply throw the ring away, just like Sherlock had done to John.
Max slid a hand in Sherlock's soft curl, kissing his pale jaw despite the grunt of protest of the detective. "Mhm... 'ts going to be fine, honey." The young man said, caressing Sherlock's forearm. "I have to go back at my flat. See you later, yeah? I'm sorry he saw." Max left, grabbing his leather jacket. Sherlock's heart was torn. He had loved John, and he had loved him more than he ever thought possible by sociopathic standards. He hadn't planned to get affected, to grow bounded at Max somehow. But he had. Emotionally, as well as sexually. The detective sighed sadly, checked his phone every four seconds. John wasn't replying. It was getting worrying. "Come back. He left. SH" He quickly typed an another message. "At least tell me you're fine. SH"
A smile appeared on his lips as he looked to the sink. He remembered the first time John had entered while Sherlock was brushing his teeth. He had blushed from shame, thought he could never be loved again after having showed he was just human.
meant a lot to Sherlock, and who was John if he wasn’t purely loyal- even if it got him killed. He forced himself back to his feet, up into a crouch while using his right hand to steady himself, back against wall- uncaring of the grime that was swept into the wide wounds.
John let out a mix of a scoff, huff, and dry, unbelieving laugh. Sherlock had pulled the human out of him. John Watson was a custom-tailored machine for him. Someone who would listen to his rants, who would be easily fooled into thinking that he was cared for. Someone who could fight and shoot a gun. Someone that he could groom and mould easily. A stupid, stupid little pet goldfish. And that was all that John was. A tool and pet. Not human- not anymore.
It wasn’t even raining outside. The doctor looked closer, using his right, useable arm to nudge his unbuttoned shirt out of the way.
He came back with a bottle of vodka, threads, and needle. He held everything, looking to both men he loved more than himself, and understanding he couldn't live without John nor live with the guilt of Max's death.
John grunted to himself as he walked back into Sherlock's room, realizing that he'd somehow left his mobile there. He'd call Sarah tonight. Perhaps she'd be up for a second date- even though the two of them would fully know who would be on John's mind. Thinking on it, a date with Sarah was a terrible idea. Nonetheless, John moved to go retrieve his phone. He creaked the door open and quietly walked in, looking for it in the mess of the duvet. It was on the side table next to Sherlock's. John picked it up and looked at the detective one last time- only hesitating to move outside as he noticed the tears. But there was a smile on Sherlock's face. The expression ran sadness and despair through him. Quietly and most likely regrettably, he used his left, bandaged hand to wipe clean the tears that doted the chemist's face before he snuck out, turning on the telly as a distraction from bad, sad, or (the mostly painful) happy memories.
Step in front of step, the doctor made his way back into the London foot-traffic. There was no point in looking behind him and at the detective. Sherlock's boyfriend was probably rushing to him from their flat. When Sherlock had come from the dead, the doctor had deduced himself that his then-flatmate had wounds on him. Sherlock had winced slightly in every movement he made. Of course, John's mind had also been filled with sadness and hurt- though it was nothing compared to what he was feeling. The then-anger had been so overwhelming that it had cleared his thoughts completely. John Watson was a scary man when he wasn't thinking. He had beat Sherlock, involuntarily ignoring the wounds. (Of course, John had apologized and they'd worked over it, but it still haunted John's mind.)
As he got up and left his room, he felt even more exhausted than before having slept. He craved to close his eyes and come back there. Into his happy dream. Shivering, feeling cold, he wrapped a dressing gown around him.
Sherlock grabbed onto his neck, suddenly scared and not wanting to fall on the floor. The Dragon laughed a little bit at how cute Sherlock looked in his arms. He stood up and slowly walked them in to the bedroom. When he got to the bed he tried to lay Sherlock down, but Sherlock refused to let go of his him, keeping his skinny arms hugging
The Dragon nods his best, sighing out hoping he was going to give him something. He closes his eyes not sure of what to do since he could no see properly. But not only could he not see he had no clue if he was with the one that got the lucky blow to his head or if he was with some random stranger that wanted him for his powers. All he knew was he could not get out in this state he would have to wait till he could get out.
But then again that might just anger the hunter even more and make him beat the boy to a pulp. John then see's the hunter grab on to the boys arm and pull his hand to his crouch. The boy grabs the hunters drink and threw it in his face, then he ran out of the pub. It did not take long for the large hunter to run after him for revenge.
The mixture of human and wolf made them more powerful and more likely to win in any battle they fight. The mixture form was around 9 feet tall and the largeist form that most wolves had.
Many people in the village wished he would just die already, so wanted to kill him not caring if they needed him. Most just wanted him gone for good, so the village would not have to worry about him hurting their familys.
“Wait!” Sherlock screamed out, but he could no longer see the Dragon. Not sure even if the Dragon heard him or not. Sherlock sighs and walks home, locking every way in to his house. Then going to his bed and falling down on it, falling a sleep once he touched the bed.
Which was going to become more hard, since the dragon season had just begun. The dragon season was when the dragon's come out from hiding in their caves or nest's to hunt for anything or the just cases destruction.
He was said to have raped many woman and men, not caring as long as he got his fix or release. But sadly he was a strong fighter and one of the villages main hunters. So they could not do really anything about him, since they needed him to kill off anything supernatural that tried to kill the village.
“Oh, I'm sorry I did not mean to wake you back up, little one." The Dragon rumbled. "You must be really sleepy. I bet you have didn't sleep well last night.” The Dragon softly whispered into the shell of Sherlock's ear.
But no one would ask that since no one knows he has The Sight and John wanted to keep it that way. Sure people knew he could do a bit of magic because of his mother or at least they thought he could only do a little bit.
But had no way of doing so, he had spent years trying to find away to help slow it down, but nothing worked and over the years the pain just got worse. Sherlock felt hand wrap around him and pull him close to a warm body. Then he heard a sound, not sure what it was maybe the Dragon was talking to him.
John wakes up to a loud thumping sound, he gets up and walks out of his room. The sound was coming from the room he put the Dragon in. John walks over to it and opens the little peep door he had on the door. The little peep door was for him to look in and see if they were hurt or if they were sleeping.
But the Dragon did not hear a word that he said, he was to deep in trying to get water and thinking he would not get anymore. So he trys to down the cup in one go spilling it all over him and John in the process. John had pulled the cup away after half of it was spilled on them both. “Hey did you not hear what I just said.” John said, only getting a sad moan out of the other.
But as Sherlock walking in side he heard something move in the trees, naking Sherlock look up. Sherlock thought he saw something, but was not sure what it was. Sherlock could feel something watching him so he walked faster to the door locking it and all his windows. Sherlock went to his bed room and closed to wood doors the the window and locked it.
John could see he was drunk and had no clue what was going on. John also saw that he was eyeing the dragon and John knew that look it was the look he saw right before he raped one of his close friends and had killed her.
John saw how bit his shirt was on the skinny boy, John puts his supplies up and goes get a blanket and a straw filled pillow for him. John puts the blanket over him slowly and puts the pillow under his head. Not wanting to wake him, after John was done he closes the door and locks it like he normally does.
He closed his eyes and let himself drown in to feelings. Sherlock felt the last bit of pain disappear and all that was left was the lovely pleasure. That was calming Sherlock down and taking him under in a sea of bliss. Sherlock lets out a happy sigh, relaxing completely in to the body that was holding him.
Which them made John run after them, trying to see where they had gone. John heard them running out north, so John ran as fast as he could. John only could see them a little but he saw the the boy was far a head the hunter.
John watches as the hunter starts to rub him self up on the boy and trys to get him to come back to his shack. But the boy pushes him off and tells him over and over to "Piss Off". So John takes that as a good sigh that he clearly did not want that hunter.
John holds up the water and watches as he drinks as slow as he could. Once the water was gone the Dragon moans again, sad that it was gone and wanting more. John sets the cup down and puts his hand on the Dragons head in an attempt to calm him down.
“Shh, there we go nice and calm.” Sherlock heard the soft and deep voice, only making him go deeper in to the bliss.
Once John felt the nod he move to lay the Dragon back down slowly and softly. Once he had him back down, he got up and got another pillow for him. He lays it down right by his hands, so he could grab it and move it where he wanted it. He slowly grabs in and pulls it to his chest only holding it and closing his eyes, hoping he would be able to fall asleep so he could get more water.
All the windows were open, which meant it was most likely a dream. Sherlock got up and walked over to the window by the door. He looked out at his shack that had his water filter in. The door was closed, which made more sense to it all being a dream. He sighed and pouted and looked back to his table, looking for his science book. But it was
John see's him hitting his head against the bed and wall, then hitting the chains against the wall as well. John bet he was having some kind of nightmare. So he opens the door and walks in, he lights the candles in the room so he could see better.
Even when those with magic cleaned the water that way they still had some bacteria in it and they had to filter it to. When Sherlock would point this out to them it was yet another thing people told the boy to shut up about.
Even if you lived right by the castle, people would still get them and torture them till they were killed, just like all the rest of The Sight's. Most were killed by people or some supernatural thing and the rest were smart to hide and tell no one what they really were.
So instead he laid down next to Sherlock, holding the slim body close to his own broader one. Sherlock had moved back to the Dragon's lap, laying on top of his muscled chest. He laid his head down right over the Dragon's heart. letting it take him right back to sleep. Sherlock
But John wanted no one to know that he had The Sight. People with The Sight were thought to be treasure that no one else could have. What do most people do when someone had treasure?. They try to steal it and use it for their own good and that's what happens to people with The Sight.
The Dragon the rubs his head on the Sherlock's chest and licks his head one more time before flying off in to the darkness. Sherlock gets up and trys to go after him grabbing his basket and running.But Sherlock was not able to run far, he was dar to tired.
one's magic. To kill them. Sherlock had been shocked when he heard this. The color drained from his already snow-white complexion. He didn't want to die!. He wanted to live so he could do more experiments with Science.
John was about to go and get his paper and pencil to draw the Dragon, since he did not know when he would see another Dragon and when he was going to see someone that beautiful. But the Dragon moans out and starts turning over away from the wall and towards John. He opens his eyes, blinking a few times not really being able to see much of anything but blurs.
They looked like a blue he had seen before, a blue he knew but could not think where he had seen the navy blue. Then it hit him they were the dark blue eyes from last night. The blue eyes that helped him, that calmed him down. Sherlock looked at the ground a few seconds before looking back up at him.
John was lookingbat the door, not knowing why he just was looking at it because he was bored. When a tall and pale man walked in to the pub, wearing a black dress that went down to the floor.
He made sure to keep back a bit since when he changed he was a bit harder to hid in the dark. Most things can make out a black moving shadow thats 9 feet tall in the dark. So he thought he would move behind him and make sure he stayed out of the side of his eyes sight.
So John knew the boy would be safe at his cabit till he was fully healed. Once Joh  got there he toke the boy to his supernatural prison room. He laid him on the bed, the only reason John toke him in there was because he knew the boy would try a hurt him when John would clean to cuts and tend to his head.
"Damn, why did you have to fall for a supernatural creature John" John was thinking, but he was pulled out of his thoughts when he saw his eyes, they were dragon eyes. To the rest of the people they looked normal, vut to John he could see right past his fake human eyes on his human form and see his realy ones.
Sherlock was looking down at the ground, making sure he did not step on anything or trip over something. The wolf saw he was not paying attention and toke it to his chances with him. The wolf knew he was a powerful and strong witch, but the wolf thought he could get the drop in him and kill him for his magic.
So John had to make sure he could keep him still and not hurt John, so John coukd help the boy. John gets clean water and turns on all the candles in the room for light with his magic.  John had to put the chains on the boy so he would not buck and hit John.
The Sherlock had droped one on his herbs, so he stopped and picked it up. The wolf smiled and toke his chance, he runs and jumps on him. Taking him down to the ground, he had hit the basket out of his hands on the ground a bit away from them.
The Dragon kept hitting himself against the wall, but this time he hit himself harder against the stone wall. John moves over to him and puts his gand on his head stopping him from hitting himself.
But he was not able to do so since the chains held him down to the bed. John trys to calm the boy with softly rubbing his arm and shoulder, it would calm him sightly. But once John went to cleaning again he would cry out in pain.
So the Dragon caught him, grabbing him by the neck and throwing him against a tree. Braking his spin and neck making it where he could not move. The Dragon was walking up to him growling, till he heard the Sherlock moan out in pain.
John felt like his heart had just ben shot with one of cupids love arrows, but there was one problem. Which was there was and icey blue light on him and leaving a path were he walked.
“Don't worry in a bit I will get you some more water. But right now hout about you sleep a little bit more and we can see how you hand the water you just had.” John said, lightly rubbing his curls and softly rocking him back and forth a bit. He softly nod in hoping it would be better to do what he said so he could get more water.
John watches him walk to the bar side and see's him get some wine to drink. John cant help but get a bit turned on when he see's him drink the wine from the mug. Seeing his perfect pink lips open wide and drink the liquid or when some drips down his chin and he licks it up with his tongue.
Sherlock sat down at his table and looked out the window by the door, he looked at his filter that he made out of a hollowed out tree. That he packed layers of rocks, cotton and clean cloth that he made out of the cotton. It reminded Sherlock that he would have to change the cotton and cloth, boil it down time it was clean.
John gets up and goes to get a calming potion for him. Once he got it he drops one single drop oh his head. It lands on his forehead and turns his whole body a light glowing blue for a few seconds. He then calms down and lays there closing his eyes.
His legs were shorter then Sherlock's long deer-like ones, but the man had way more muscle mass, which made Sherlock a little bit nervous since he had no strength at all. The man had a rugged face and short, thick brown-blond hair. He dressed in a dark green shirt that had short sleeves which only showed off his big, bulging muscles even more. Sherlock swallowed. Then he looked at his eyes and saw they were dark blue.
The Dragon had grabbed on to his shirt tightly, not wanting the water to be pulled away from him so fast. His head then falls on to Johns shoulder, as he wines more and rubs his head on his neck in hopes of getting more water.
The Dragon walked over to him slowly so he did not scare the witch, but it did not work. Once the Sherlock saw him he trys his best to crawl away from him. The Dragon slowly walks to him and stops him gently, moving him back on his back with his snout.
John saw that his dress was ripped from the bottom to above hit stomach. John could see that he had cuts all up and down his legs and his stomach as well. Once John was done with cleaning all his cuts he toke off the dress and got the boy one of his shirts to sleep in.
The wolf was shocked when the Sherlock did not use his powers when he tackled him to the ground. Instead he tried to hit at the wolfs throat and get to his little knife  he kept in his right shoes.
John then moves to go get a calming potion for him. John runs to his storage room where he keeps them all. He gets the small bottle and heads back to the Dragon. Once he was back he saw that the Dragon was now holding on to the pillow for dear life.
John chained his wrist and feet to the wood bed, making sure he added new symbols so it would hole the dragon and he could not get out of the chains. John goes to clean the blood off of his head, the boy lets out a pain full scream and trys to hit John to make him stop.
John sits down next to him and slowly sets the cup down on the bed that was not covered in the padding that John had made. “I'm going to have to lift you up, so dont try and move away ok. I cant have you choking on the water. John said, moving slowly to put his arm around his back.
John slowly wraps the boys arms around his shoulder and picks him up. He made a soft whine when John picked him up, he probably has no clue whag was going on. John uses his magic to teleport then back to his cabin.
Sherlock the heard a thud coming from his shed. Sherlock walked out and went over to the door, trying to make as little to no sound as possible as he walked. He slowly opened the door and saw the Dragon bent over picking up his book of science off the floor. Sherlock held on to his pillow tighter, gasping, light blue eyes wide as a saucer, not sure if this was real or not.
The Dragon whines out and trys to hit himself again, but John stops him. John sighs, he seemed to be in a deep sleep and whatever he was dreaming about was scaring him badly. John moves to get a pillow and puts in between him and the wall.
John was going out in one of the pubs by his cabin, it was a bit of a walk away from where John lived. Since John lived alone deep in to the woods where no one would bother him.
“Stupid or not I'm still getting your powers.” The wolf said, moving his claw up to his neck. But before he could even push down to make one cut then was a load growl.  Roaring through the woods like thunder and lightning.
Sherlock had to many questions and no answers, which was making his head hurt. Sherlock grabbed his head with on hand trying to keep his eyes open and the knife up, but the pain was to much making Sherlock cry out in pain and hit the floor. Sherlock dropped the knife and tugged at his bouncy curls, wanting it to stop. Wanting to be able to stop thinking and stop it all, thinking, the overwhelming pieces of data. He wanted go slow his brain down.
John pushed him off of the boy and checked if he was ok, his eyes were barly open and John could see fear in his eyes. John runs his hand over his curls and shushed him softly trying to calm him down a bit. He slowly did calm down, but John needed to get him out of there so he could tend to his cuts and head.
In the darkness the wolf only could see the eyes glowing, but once it breathed fire at the wolf. He saw it was a full grown Dragon camouflaged in to trees. The wolf tried to make a run for it, but Dragon's could fly up to a 1000 miles per hour.
The Dragon changed his eyes to his human ones, so he would not seem so scary. It did help the Sherlock calm down and stop trying to get away. The Dragon lightly shushes him  and starts to lick his wounds, so they would heal.
Sherlock was lightly humming a song he had made up, looking down at the ground not paying much attention to anything or the woods around him. Sherlock was so deep in his melody that he did not see the wolf following him.
John slowly moves him up and rest him on his chest, making sure he did not fall off the bed and hurt himself. John moves his hands around his stomach so he could have something to hold on to. He the picks up the water and moves it to his lips and softly says. “Drink slowly ok, theres no need to rush I can give you more when you're done with this cup ok.”
Buttoning himself up again, he wonders what Sherlock is doing. He cannot hinder his thoughts circling back to the morning, to Sherlock mussed on the bed, the way he’d arched as he’d orgasmed, the interest in his eyes still keen when they said goodbye. John wonders whether the magic will still be there when he gets home.
Sherlock hadn't much cared, he’d just rolled his eyes and shivered. It had suited his mood; cold and dark and full of recriminations for a job poorly done. The killer had still been on the loose, and they’d wasted two whole days. He’d desperately wanted to come up with a better plan, but his thoughts had kept tumbling together and winding around the same routes every time he’d tried to think of a new way out of his dilemma.
He’d been so knackered after the overlong case that it was a small miracle he'd detained any information at all, let alone enough to deduce something worth while afterwards.
Sherlock's voice is unsteady, and John’s nerves abate a little. He recognizes that quiver, it is of the good sort; hopeful and curious. Horny.
Sherlock’s choppy explanation does not make the situation any clearer for John, and the lecture is cut off by Sherlock’s right hand pulling out of the waistband and sneaking behind John’s rump to cradle his buttock just where his pants are aligned, and now even John can feel the double hem as Sherlock’s hand pushes and kneads against it through his trousers. Sherlock leans his face against his front and is he…? Yes, Sherlock is biting gently at the front of his trousers and John is rock hard just inches from where he is mouthing.
“I just… Do you…?” Sherlock tries valiantly to form a question, any kind of question it seems, but then blinks, closes his mouth and apparently decides to remain silent. Perhaps he's afraid John did it by accident, and any questioning might cause John to retrace his motions? Sherlock flicks his hand with a never-mind gesture but his gaze remains intent.
They’d been almost alone in the train car. Not so many people wanted to take the night train on a Wednesday it had seemed. The world had been dark around the train, and the lights inside the car had made gloomy reflections on the windows. John had taken the window seat, “because it would be warmer by the aisle”, he’d said. John was always insistent like that.
Sherlock lifts his head a little and lets his hands skim over John’s trousers, fondle delicately at the hem of his jacket and his jumper.
“Oh”, John said, pulled his eyebrows together briefly and then smiled again. “Does it matter?” he asked.
Now the images slowly blended into the feel of heaviness in his body. He was a little groggy as well. Like he was waking from a deep slumber. He was relaxed, though, surrounded by safety and softness. Something was warm against his arm, soothing small familiar circles against his skin.
The end of Sherlock's statement dragged a bit as he lowered his gaze in embarrassment. Unfortunately this did not help him with his flustered condition as he first now realized John's state of dress. Or undress.
Sherlock’s hands are still there, one fondling John’s balls through the wet pants, the other grabbing his shirt combination hard. Sherlock sucks John unremittingly, hard, suctioning his cock deep inside him and unheeding of saliva pooling in his mouth and trickling all over them. John is gasping and a part of him would like this to last, but the most eager part of him just wants it all now, and Sherlock is determined to give it. He swallows around John’s head and there is an accidental graze of teeth, but John doesn’t care. Sherlock sucks harder and moans around him, and then John is coming, his toes curling, his hand thumping the arms rest, and an unflattering keening coming from his throat.
To introduce new kind of toughing, Sherlock briefly considered picking up a hobby where they would have to be in contact. Like wrestling. Or partnered yoga. Or tandem skydiving. But talking John into it would be a pain, and the results were doubtful in any case.
There is a cup of tea beside John, so Sherlock has at least a while to indulge. Thankfully John is holding a book this time, not a newspaper. Sherlock can count the frustrating mornings of trying to glimpse anything of John's gorgeous torso with the length and width of the infuriating Independent, or whatever it was that John read, in the way. Talking about teasing. John is a practical master. Not that he knows anything about it.
Sherlock had been tired enough to just sigh as a reply. He’d ran the quip about John’s diplomatic skills in his head, though – no reason to let his rudeness go rusty even if he was too tired to open his mouth.
John knows Sherlock is good at pacing. That means that John has to work like clockwork here. Just as normal, so that Sherlock knows how to time his quickly impending orgasm.
Sherlock hummed. It was comfortable: Home. Sofa. John right beside him. He didn’t care that things had not gone exactly as he’d planned.
When John is outside and pushes the door closed, he can hear the thunder of Sherlock stomping back upstairs, three steps at a time. John waits a beat, double checking that he has his keys and his wallet, even though he knows exactly where they are. He just wants to give Sherlock time to reach their living room window.
John frowns a little, and Sherlock imagines kissing the slight crease between his eyebrows and the corner of his frowning mouth and then promptly has to swallow because getting hard in front of John is never a safe option.
John is hot, more sweat trickling down his spine and gathering moisture in his armpits and his groin, but he sits patiently, keeps his hands relaxed on the arm rests, his legs splayed. Lets Sherlock explore, open him up like the present he is.
“Not a roller-coaster, a carousel”, John smiled, “But what if it isn’t just bad luck? What if there’s a gang behind it?”
Sherlock, who obviously was the insensitive intruder, had already stepped in and taken the one long stride needed to reach the top shelf of the cabinet just behind John, where he kept his hair products.
The whole case was stupid. It wasn’t even a case really, just a lot of running around and collecting fake evidence and talking to people and making it seem like a case so that John wouldn’t get too suspicious. Along the way, they did manage to find a reporter to do a positive story about the environmentally conscious oat ice cream shop in the morning, though. And after the lunch time rush Sherlock helped another shop owner revamp her marketing campaign. And later that night, as a corner shop was closing, they – well, mostly John – helped reattach a halfway fallen marquis.
John was breathing evenly now, his body looking heavy, his arms resting slack in his lap. Sherlock leaned all the way back on the couch and turned his head so that he could look at John. He wanted to monitor John and make sure he knew when John was completely asleep. Only once John was completely off, would he dare make his move. He had it all mapped out in his head. He’d scoot closer inch by inch, then snuggle his hand behind John, carefully, and then he’d cuddle John close. He would make sure John would wake up inside a warm hug, rested and happy, and then! Then Sherlock would kiss him. It would be perfect.
Then, a little later, John's other hand had sneaked up and stilled against his chest, just holding him there. Sherlock had known then that John's eyes had been closed. He had no idea how he’d come to this deduction, only it had seemed an important one at the time. Perhaps because it had brought him the courage to do what he’d done next.
John had then pulled Sherlock's coat over them both and told Sherlock to fold his legs all the way inside the warmth of the cozy nest they’d formed together. It had been a tight fit but they’d made it work, Sherlock’s toes poking out under the arm rest, John’s leg pressed tight between the backrest and Sherlock’s body.
Before the latest developments, John had been often dozing off here and there in their living room and during cases, but this new polite John seemed to be always awake and alert and often retreating to his own room in the evenings when they didn’t have anything urgent going on.
Oh god, Sherlock is becoming hard from the simple act of touching his sleeve. He, John, has made Sherlock hard by pulling on two shirts that morning and now they are standing in their kitchen surrounded by this magical tension and John is suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the situation.
Later John would be lying on his back in Sherlock's bed, all naked except for that cardigan, still all neatly buttoned up, while Sherlock would be plunging deep into him over and over and over. John would be panting and quivering and pleading, and Sherlock would tease his nipples slipping his fingers just under the ribbing, and John's chest and belly would still rise up and fall down underneath that brown sheerness, only all fast and furious now. And, God, how good his skin would look and feel underneath it, just hidden and yet so terribly visible.
He has to turn to look now, just a glance, and he cannot hide the tiniest of smiles forming on the corner of his mouth.
His name sounds tremulous on Sherlock's lips. Sherlock drops down to his knees in front of him and places his hands on John's knees. John lifts his own hands out of the way and lets them flop on the arm rests. He feels rather exposed suddenly, even if he is fully clothed – or, perhaps, exactly because of it. Sherlock fingers the fabric of his trousers, his hands are trembling. Then he impulsively leans closer and cradles John’s thigh, hiding his face in the fabric.
“How do you always know?”, he’d asked then as well, but could not have answered John's baffled counter question of, “Know what?”, because an insistent hum had been just then filling his ears, the promise of sleep suddenly tasting intricately sweet.
However unlikely this glimpsing is, Sherlock likes to hang out slightly to the right of John, so that he has a good view between John's buttons. He will take this view gladly any time, a glimpse of John's skin is always tantalizing, but, to be honest, the best chills are the ones he gets when the shallow opening between two buttons reveals the ribbed cotton of a vest underneath.
There was also a lot about small touches on these websites he browsed, and he wondered if John had got his idea from the same place. Sherlock put some serious thought into this; clearly John had had a lot of success with it. The problem was, though, that Sherlock had been touching John ever since they met; reaching to his pockets, manhandling him during cases, fixing his lapels. It was normal for them. The disheartening fact was that John had obviously never taken it to mean anything more.
These tricks are for special occasions, though; lazy Sundays, when Sherlock has enough time to enjoy double and triple checking his deductions. Or boring crime scenes, where there's not enough crime to investigate, and it's warm enough, that John is not wearing a coat or a jumper, but also cold enough, that he has pulled on a vest that morning.
“I'm not going to take them off”, John says, and the way Sherlock breathes out and flushes dark at that makes John hope he wasn’t in a hurry to get to work after all. But he’s determined to make this as good for Sherlock as possible. “I'm going to continue dressing up”, he says, “You know, pulling my trousers up, buttoning my shirt, that sort of thing. You're welcome to watch if you want.” He says it with a small tinge of allure in his voice.
Sherlock hums. He follows John all the way down to the front door, but they don't dare kiss there. They both seem to feel it would be too risky.
“Can you feel them?” he asks after his breathing has slowed and he’s letting his thumb smooth John’s trousers again.
“Fuck, John, I’m going to come”, Sherlock breathes. John is pretty hard himself, even though for him, in all honesty, nothing has actually happened yet.
Of course John could have just sneaked quickly behind the shower curtain or even remained facing the wall, but the sudden noise and the sudden presence of someone else in a room he'd thought empty and private startled him and his first instinct was to turn around in a flash and face the possible threat.
Here was the plan then: He would make John tea and he would make John fall asleep and then he’d cuddle and pet John, and then, voilà, John would wake up, and they would kiss. It was inevitable. Although he was a little uncertain still as to what exactly the function of the tea was in this scenario, but, nevertheless, he’d make it work. He was a genius after all.
Until then he is stuck, sitting in his chair, legs folded, trying to keep from moaning aloud, his cock hard as a rock and leaking, soaking his pants, he unable to do fuck all about it lest John notice. It is part of the excitement of his little hobby, this torture, never knowing when John will leave, being under his mercy so to speak, even if John himself has no idea of his role in the game.
When John closes the door to 221B on his way to work, Sherlock can close his eyes and imagine he travels with John, close to John's heart, in his private knowledge of what John is wearing innermost that day.
Sherlock stands up when John drops his bag by the door. John is about to shrug off his jacket, but Sherlock lifts his hands up in a halting gesture.
“Fuck, John, it’s so obvious. You’ve been walking around like this and anyone could have seen although no one did and. Yes, it’s obvious. Yes, I can see them, the fabric pulls here and here, and the way these trousers fit on you, it’s pretty clear once you. They are also visible whenever you, fuck John, I need to…”
Sherlock still seems frozen, so John reaches for his trousers, and that finally sends Sherlock into a flurry of movement. His pajama pants are pushed unceremoniously down – just an inch or two – and his cock is out in seconds. He is grabbing his t-shirt through the dressing gown he already shrugged on earlier. This is a habit John knows well; Sherlock likes to fondle the clothes he has on for masturbation, the more layers he can grab, the better.
“221B Baker Street”, he announced, and the smile John gave him when he slid beside him on the backseat was radiating. On top of that, Sherlock was pleased to note that John looked completely worn out. In fact, he was already yawning.
John is already giddy with his idea of testing those deductions, scheming how he could manage to put on a double pair without Sherlock noticing. Perhaps if he took an extra pair to work one day?
“Sit down, you're knackered, it was a long case. It'll probably take an age for her to find us a doctor now.”
“What can I do for you then, love?” he asks. He will be happy to return the favor, put more clothes on, let Sherlock rub one against him, whatever Sherlock wants.
Because yes, he obviously had not realized John was there and ready for a shower. Nor had he realized exactly how close they'd ended as he started to reach up, only to falter as he perceived the closeness of the rather rapidly reddening face of his flatmate.
“Yes, darling?” he inquires and – damn yeah – his own voice comes out smooth and light, completely normal. He feels like bumping his fist in the air but he struggles to remains calm.
John generally liked to sleep in his own bed. He did it most nights in fact. But snuggling John there didn’t quite seem the correct thing to do. Not for the first time at least.
It doesn’t take long before Sherlock is opening John’s belt buckle. It always feels to John like a religious ritual; Sherlock so focused, on a one track mind. Once the buckle is open, he positions his fingers just so to open the top button. He takes a shuddering breath when he pops it. For an instant, John flashes back to this morning, to the moment he had closed the same button, just seconds after Sherlock had orgasmed.
Suddenly a hand landed on her shoulder making her jump and twist around, prepared to fight off who ever had touched her.
Kyle smiled gently and stroked a hand down her arm until he was grasping her hand, entwining their fingers. "It's going to be alright. Go to sleep I won't let anything bad happen to you." He smiled and held her hand until she fell asleep.
Panting John held Sherlock against him, rubbing his friends sweat slicked skin as their bodies cooled and their pulses stopped racing. "Mmmm" john signed as Sherlock rolled them over so the lanky detective wasn't crushing his little blogger. "That was..." John started but couldn't find the words.
John looked up at his husband as soon as the word left his lips. Only to find Sherlock blushing. "Sherlock?"
"And do you promise to keep him, love and comfort, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and to be faithful until death do you part?
John looked from the sulking detective to the twins who gave him a conspirator wink, to which he winked back.
Alright so let me hit the most important part that you should remember! THERE WILL BE A SEQUAL! And I warned you before hand...so yea...No pitchforks!
"You don't talk about my father like that you whore. He might have done stuff like that in the past but at least he beat it…I'll talk to you alone…" Lily whispered the last part knowing that her mother wouldn't let the matter rest until she got what she wanted. "Not without me Lily-lie…" Lucian grasped her hand and after a second Lily nodded her head.
Lexy's eyes went wide and she made a pleading gesture with her hands. "Oh come on John that was forever ago and she just stopped glaring at me!"
She then grabbed an iron rod she found in the supply cabinet (when they supply they aren't actually joking) and wrapped the copper wire around it, binding it with adhesive tape that she stole off of Lucian (don't tell).
Sherlock really thought he was going to be hit. Or strangled. Or both. But he didn't fight, didn't struggle because he knew he would deserve it. His jaw had already bruised in an ugly pattern of color, and his back was sensitive from the harsh contact of his raw skin rubbing against the coat. His toes were curling up awkwardly on the dirty streets of London, and he felt both pathetic and helpless.
again? Sherlock huffed again before standing, ignoring the way his chair fell back. Being dramatic was an art— one that had to be practised even when there was no one around to witness it.
Most people thought that doctors made the worst patients. Not John Watson. Even before he'd been tortured, broken, etc, etc. John Watson had been a model patient. When his shoulder had been shot through the first time, he sat in his army medic room of his base and allowed for himself to be doped up and away from the pain. He had taken his medication properly. All because he knew how annoying terrible patients were. This time- it was for a different reason. John allowed himself to be wheeled away into emergency care, forced to take x-rays, and sat through all the tests simply because it gave him something to do. He allowed his wounds to be stitched up and his back to be bandaged after having his shoulder checked. He laid dutifully after it all, staring up at the bland, white ceiling as Sherlock sat beside him on a boring, cushioned, plastic chair. He had ignored Sherlock's statement and had simply followed the man, not having anything else to do.
Sherlock couldn't believe what he was reading. Didn't John believe he mattered to the detective? Somehow, through the sadness, it was the anger that rose up.
The noise of the gun spitting his bullet out echoed, reaching Sherlock who in turn, broke down. He collapsed on the ground as if the strings holding him had been cut.
was dead. The doctor splashed milk into a (new?) mug, considering he'd smashed his on the wall a year ago. This mug wasn't Sherlockian. And most definitely not something Mrs Hudson or anyone else would've gifted. With dread, John lifted the cup so that it's bottom could be visible to the doctor.
Sherlock had tried to follow John. With everything he had, he ran after him, but soon, the crowd swallowed the doctor, fading him away, making him disappearing. Sherlock was panting from the race, and from the pain stabbing his heart. It carved a hole inside his chest. He had lost John, and all this because he had been careless. Because he had accepted to let Max in when he knocked to the door without warning, promising to stay only a few minutes. Obviously, it got out of control, and it was this day that John chose to not come back at home as late as Sherlock thought. Sighing, he quickly typed a text to the doctor : "Where are you? SH" Then an another "We need to talk. SH"
Oh, and tell me if you want shorter updates, this one's nearly 3000 words. Personally, I find it very difficult to sit through that, but it's been so long since I updated (because i'm terrible, duh) and you deserve a treat.
John looked up at the never-stopping clock. "A few hours." He had spent the last hour or so simply looking around the flat, looking at memories that'd been created without him. And suddenly, John felt a little less at home. This was Sherlock's and Max's. And John had simply barged in and taken over. Hell, he'd even practically
(More than) half of credit goes to Camille. She forced me to update, to reply back, and she still does. And I couldn't ask for a better, more insane, more amazing friend.
It wasn't harmful. He wasn't doing anything wrong. Well, he was, but as long as John never knew about it, it wouldn't hurt anyone. That's what Sherlock thought, as he started this relationship with Max. He felt guilty every time the young man left the flat, but in the meantime... It was so good. So thrilling, for the detective, it was a new way to not be bored. And he was Sherlock Holmes, he could manage to hide an another relationship easily"....John." He said, his voice hoarse from the passionate kiss he had shared with his lover. "John, it's not..." But the doctor was already running away. After a glance to the man-- who had started to pull his trousers up, Sherlock followed John. "Wait, let me explain!
"Oh! Sherlock Holmes! How many times have I told you not to scare me like that?!" The wolf only bared its teeth at her, still growling. John, on the other hand, was still freezing, still shivering, still on the floor, still very much in shock. His body didn't bother doing anything, frozen as his mind attempted to comprehend this new... knowledge? Discovery? Whatever this was, it was racing, trying to categorize the information. Mrs Hudson petted the top of the creature's large head a few times before setting the tray on the table and making her way out with a, "Don't get into any trouble, you two!" Long after she left, the room still swamped in darkness, illuminated by only the moon and a few sparse clouds reflecting the light, John was still on the floor, staring at the wolf with wide eyes. Sherlock. Sherlock. It approached him, careful and gentle, shoving at his shoulders until the doctor complied, sitting up. But apparently, even that wasn't enough. Sher-- Sherlock tugged on his shirt, half dragging him and half forcing the doctor to crawl to the detective's bedroom. It jumped onto the mussed bed, letting out a short huff before it moved, giving John space, too. The doctor warily climbed into bed beside his... flatmate and... could honestly not help relaxing into the warmth of the bed, the duvet thick around him. He closed his eyes briefly, taking in deep breaths and relaxing as he succumbed to the softness of the mattress and the bubble of heat he created due to the blanket.
couple would only hurt the two further. John looked at the kitchen table and at the ring that rested on top of it, sadness filtering through him once more and his eyes dimming. He cleared his throat, clasping his hands together before separating them and clenching and unclenching them singularly. "Sorry, that was... a bit not good."
John felt fingers wrap around his wrist. The doctor was almost completely lost in thought and was paying nearly no attention to his surroundings. Though he was sensitive to his environment, he was still extremely distracted. Without the doctor thinking, his instincts would be in control of his body. John flipped into Captain mode, skillfully twisting his wrist out of the grasp, using his body's momentum created by the twist to sweep the person onto the wall, his forearm blocking their airway and his left arm raised for an offense. Captain John Watson was a mode to be feared, eyes blank and ready to kill. His eyes softened in recognition once he realized who he had pinned up against the wall. Hurt flooded his eyes before the doctor could stop it and turn it anger, leaving him momentarily vulnerable. The doctor blinked for a fraction of a second and when he opened his eyes again, they contained nothing that could be classified short of brick-like, his walls having been put up again.
But then again, Mycroft was a Holmes. The Holmes men were a force that John wouldn't wish on his worst enemy, much less his best mate.
He never truly did. The doctor found himself walking towards 221B. Not for Sherlock- no. For Mrs Hudson. Right now, he needed a place to stay away from the prying eyes of anyone around him and he was sure that the landlady would invite him into her guest bedroom for the night. He unlocked the door- hating the memories that the simple action brought back. John averted his eyes, assuming that Sherlock had gone off with his boyfriend and left his flatmate alone. Good. John wasn't Sherlock's boyfriend. Not anymore. He had been once- but never again.
Camille wrote this with me because she is amazing and *cough* put up with my terribly, horribly late replies because she is wonderful.
Sherlock dropped the metal as if it had burnt him, looking up at the wolf as its brown eyes looked down on him, its body still holding him in place.  "John Watson." He murmured, his nerves easing. John wouldn’t hurt him, he was a soldier, sure, a doctor, yes— but he was a friend. Friends saved friends, but they did not hurt them. Sherlock let out a shaky breath, observing a deducing the thing covering him with its body. Deep brown fur, hinted with greys. He shimmered in the moon, muscle rippling under thick skin as his tail continued to move this way and that.
If I didn't care about you I wouldn't have faked my death to save your life. I wouldn't have sold my brother to Magnussen if I didn't care about your happiness. I have scars because of you. I have traumas because of you. SH
When he was almost at his wits end and thought of just giving up and asking John for advice, it finally clicked: That was it! Asking John! Only, he didn’t have to ask John, he already knew what John would answer! Or at least what John’s approach would have been. Sherlock had experienced it!
John bites his lip. It’s the double exclamation mark that does it. Sherlock doesn’t use double punctuation.
“Can you…”, John starts, but does not quite know how to put his question. “You can deduce them then?”
After a while of just laying there, he turned his head to look at John. “What happens now?” he asked. It was a curious thing. He’d been nervous before. Incredibly nervous. But he did not feel nervous now. Not at all. Just easy.
But in his memory, as he'd already been drifting to sleep, what had made his dreams all the sweeter, was the fact – and he’d been quite convinced of it back then – that there had in fact been two simultaneous hums.
This time Sherlock seems frantic enough, though, and John is curious to see where he takes things. Sherlock’s hands are smoothing up and down John’s trousers and they unerringly find the creases of his double pants underneath. Sherlock keeps cursing and dropping his forehead against John’s thighs again and again. John cannot but follow the frantic ritual in awe. It’s a huge turn on.
Sherlock seems to be having trouble articulating, but his gaze smooths lovingly over the folds of John’s shirtsleeve, probably calculating the exact point of tension in the fabrics or figuring out the exact measurements of the sleeves or whatever it is genius detectives with complicated kinks contemplate while looking at the object of their... study.
But as they’d walked up the stairs to 221B, Sherlock had lingered in the soft feeling of the dream and the wonderful haze of waking up feeling… surrounded. As he’d recalled the sensation of John beside him – around him – the deduction had clicked in place. He’d not noticed it in the cab, because John must have pulled back the second Sherlock had moved, but now Sherlock could distinctly remember not only John’s warmth beside him, but also John’s arm draped over him and a hand on his shoulder; a thumb caressing in small circles, soothing his whole world and turning his dreams into starry nights full of delightful crimes.
Well, that was not what John had expected, but then it was as well, because when did he ever expect the expected from his friend?
John is suddenly very aware of his skin underneath the double layers and as he mechanically follows his morning routine of coffee making, he thinks the entire apartment is echoing from the rustle of his shirts.
The delicious tingle in Sherlock's spine is caused partly by John's firm outside-cold hand curled around his arm and partly by those words. "My doctor…" Sherlock mumbles. The heat, it seems, is still making him drowsy, and perhaps he has a bit of a fever because the whole world seems hazy and wonderful and strange. He feels a pressure on his hip, and a wet something on his forehead, and something heavy is pulled over his body. Another blanket. He feels so deliciously warm now, and even though John's hand is gone, he still feels the firm support of it on his skin as he is drifting to sleep again.
John has buttoned his shirt all the way down now, his hand just grazing over his slightly plumped cock underneath, and he has to lift his eyes to Sherlock at that. Sherlock shudders and blinks but keeps his eyes trained on John's groin.
Sherlock seemed to have been stuck in one sentence but John did not much care as Sherlock's cock did not seem to have any problem proceeding. His stomach felt like it had dropped and scurried away ages ago and in stead there was just a hollow pit with a roaring waterfall of desire and an endless whirlpool of dizzy anxiety.
, John texts, and Sherlock huffs, but before he has time to send a rebuttal – he is never ill, only John sometimes suffers from hypochondria, or whatever it is they call it when you think your flatmate is ill – John has followed with another text.
. He did not, therefore, see how those especial eyes on their part opened wide and then, slowly, inevitably travelled down, down John's face, down his chest and down again.
John had been quiet afterwards, just looking at Sherlock with large eyes and – once Lestrade had arrived – had announced that they were going home. The cab ride had been a long one, and Sherlock's eyes had drooped the moment they’d sat down and closed the doors.
John’s trousers slide over his butt now, and Sherlock groans aloud, loud, and John just has to glance at him again. Sherlock’s eyes are glued to his hips still, probably imagining the pants he no longer can see. John wonders if he can, though, if there is something in the way his trousers are aligned or in the way the fabric bunches up now that tells the genius that there must be two pairs of pants underneath, not just one.
Because Sherlock can’t stop staring at that little peek of pale skin. They are sitting opposite each other, in their chairs, and John reaching for things slightly behind him makes the gap between those two buttons of his shirt open just so.
Back at 221B, Sherlock threw himself onto their sofa and just as he’d planned it, John slumped down beside him.
So, that had been then. But this was now, and this now was turning out to be rather disappointing. It had been three weeks since the hospital and the x-ray, and nothing at all interesting had happened. No cuddling or pulling Sherlock close or even bringing him random cups of tea. Nor were there jackets arranged over anyone or any impromptu discussions about childhood.
Sherlock takes a long while just staring at that chest rising and falling, the first button of the cardigan neatly snuggled in the middle. That cardigan is certainly one of the most erotic things John owns. It is all proper and neat, but so thin that it's actually transparent. Especially with a shirt like this, with clearly contrasting colour values. Everything shows.
"He joined the art club…I don't want him there for her!" Lily announced from the bottom of the stairs. "Lily She does have custody rights…and unfortunately Lucian does have to be there as well but don't worry we won't let anything happen to either of you." Sherlock said gently making her frown. "But she doesn't want to see him…she only wants to use him as leverage to gain more money." Lily announced making her father sigh.
Both men stared at the two but when Sherlock opened his mouth he closed it as his lover knelt in front of his children. "Why didn't you tell anyone?" He asked gently making them frown. "We did…we told the principal who only said 'you have no evidence so it cannot be proven' and we figured if we can't prove it why bother you guys?" Lucian remarked watching Sherlock's face go red. "John where is my phone?" He rumbled darkly making John wince and before he could voice the 'no' on the tip of his tongue Sherlock continued with his own. "No John, NO ONE treats my offspring in such a manner this will be solved NOW!" he growled as he leapt to his feet.
Both twins leaned forward to see the puppy asleep and snuffling gently. They then gave each other the 'Oh-Shit' expression which made John nod his head.
Three days later saw John, Sherlock and the twins walking into the clinic just in time for their appointment.
John had no idea how long he stood there and stared at the lanky detective. But when his mind snapped into gear he realized that Sherlock was starting to get panicky.
"Sherlock, this is Lucian and Lily. Lucian and Lily this is Sherlock Holmes my younger brother, thank you John. Both of you drink your tea please while I speak to my brother in private." Mycroft smiled at the two then dragged his brother into the other room. Leaving John with the two twins.
Panicked at the sight of my presence...A bit not good... eyes keep shifting towards the stairs, hands wringing. Not exactly panic but close...fear? He's trembling but moving closer towards me so not afraid of me...that is good. There's definitely something wrong, something up stairs has him afraid...where Is lily? Lily Is always with him but did not descend...his fear has something to do with her the way he keeps eyeing the staircase...That smell...sweat? why would he be sweating he just got out of the shower...not his sweat...Lily's...Lily did not come down stairs with her brother who's terrified of something upstairs and the smell of sweat on him...Something Is wrong with lily!  Sherlock thought quickly as he bolted up the stairs to throw open the door.
Sherlock watched as John then stripped and folded up his clothes to place on the chair. After he was done Sherlock drew the small army doctor into his arms and kissed him deeply as he pressed him into the bed.
"I don't know I quite like the tent in the snow thing..." Lucian remarked earning a playful glare from John. "No devils advocate from you." He said then gave him a kiss on the head as well.
"John I have two kids and a man that I love very much…I believe a divorce is in order." Sherlock said with a small smile and reached out to grab John's hand. "Seriously John…I do wish to marry you but I know that proposing at the moment is a bit not good with the funeral and the incident that just happened…"
That night Lily found herself unable to sleep and just laid in the foreign bed, wide awake, her thoughts twisting upon themselves until they became a snarled mess. Exasperated she threw off the blankets and padded down the hall, looking for her brother who could hopefully help her get to sleep.
"AMALEE!" Came a snarl over her shoulder and Mrs. Holmes turned to find her husband standing behind her, looking none too happy. Mycroft left the small party with a grim smile adorning his face. He knew that his father now fully saw the venom that lingered under his wifes skin now. He turned back to see Amalee's pale face that only seemed to leech more colour as his father spoke and knew that her words will have cost her dearly this time.
Lily and Lucian sat on the couch staring blindly at the television. They had already explored every inch of the wing they were allowed in and were very bored. "Alright I've had enough of this." Lily said as she pulled herself off the couch. "Where are you going?" Her brother asked immediately curious. "I'm going to go and make my own fun…" She smiled evilly before heading out the door.
"Sebastian says that you two have a bad habit of popping up and… well staring at him… that's freaking him out so could you two please not do that?" Jim smiled and tried not to grind his teeth at their confused looks.
"Oh nothing I was just thinking that it would be best for the species that you don't procreate… that might be one gene pool too many…" Lily answered making Sherlock smile. "Besides it's a criminal statistic that you are more likely to be victimized by a so called friend then a stranger."
“Don’t tell them that. I tried to tell them that and they made me write in each type of pen and vote on which one was best.” John sighed and sank deeper into the couch.
"Yes. Especially because we have officially lost a few of the party goers and the owner looks ready to throw us out." He grinned up at his boyfriend who smiled down on him.
