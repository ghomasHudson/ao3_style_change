“Oh God, seriously, I can’t even stand out here for another second, come on, come on, let’s get back inside,” and suddenly there was a hand on his arm, tugging him upward off the bench with a surprising amount of strength.
“…Fair point.” Steve grinned wickedly, and then surged up suddenly, catching Tony’s mouth. “I could keep your mouth busy though,” he offered, which seemed to briefly throw Tony off for a moment as he sucked in a sharp breath, but then he blinked back into it and Steve yelped quietly when Tony huffed and flicked him sharply on the forehead.
No one said anything. Steve looked away, that wave of familiar rage threatening to spill out of him again as he thought of Tony, back at Thor’s place, bruised and broken because of the whim of a selfish, jealous teenager. It wasn’t fair. None of this was fucking fair.
Steve was looking at him in question, and Tony couldn’t stop the admission from falling off his tongue, rapid and a little too fearful-sounding for his liking. “I
Tony’s lip curled in disgust, watching as her head bowed and she remained silent for a few seconds, stewing in her own guilt. Good.
Tony hummed. He had a feeling that he might not hold out that long. “Was gonna… had the mistletoe everywhere,” he muttered, “and specially designed crackers. It was a whole thing.”
Tony shook his head a little, head turning to the floor. “I just… don’t ever think I have met someone quite like you, Steve Rogers,” he declared with a confused voice, looking upward at Steve through those stupid long lashes.
Steve watched them go helplessly. Tony looked at him one more time; a red mark beginning to fade in on his forehead from where it had hit the gravel, and then he sighed, turning away with a shake of his head. He shrugged Rhodey’s arm off and said a few quiet words into the other boy’s ear, before beginning to march off down the drive and over to his bike. His hands came out of his pocket and pulled out a small hip flask, and then Steve could only look on in despair as Tony chugged half of it in one and then slid onto the seat.
to make them my problems,” Steve stormed ahead and finished before Tony could get anything else into his head. “Your problems are my problems because they upset you, and hurt you, and when that happens I just want to try and make them stop doing that. I want to try and fix them for you. That’s what being in a relationship is about, sweetheart.” He laughed and gestured around him at the strangely decorated room, full of weird off-yellow furniture and way too many pillows for his liking. “Why do you think I spent all night last night looking through Airbnb to find this goddamn farm in the middle of nowhere at the last minute?”
“Thanks,” he choked out in the end, looking down at his damp trainers and fiddling with his hands. He could sense Thor smiling at him, but he didn’t say anything else after that and left the silence to grow around them comfortably. Thor eventually had to get off a few stops before Steve, and he patted Steve on the back firmly as he stood and began to leave.
He sighed and looked down, checking his phone again. Tony still hadn’t replied, seeing as he was probably still in detention. Fury had kicked him out of the office before Steve could hear much, but it sounded like Tony might be spending the next few weeks kept back an hour after school because of the fight. Steve just hoped that they wouldn’t try and make Tony apologize- not that Tony
put him on the defensive, but who could blame him? It was a touchy subject, and one that people had poked at too many times.
“No, Tony, stop,” Steve said broken-heartedly, taking Tony’s hand and pulling it up to his mouth to kiss his knuckles gently, shaking his head as the tears slipped freely. “This was never,
The days of summer passed them by in a haze of work and team-nights and trying to help Peter pass his course at MIT without dropping out or becoming a coke addict. The normal stuff, really. Apart from the superpowers and aliens.
He didn’t finish whatever it was that he’d been going to say because Steve had jumped to his feet, posture coiled, tense, knees bent. His hands curled and lifted away from his sides, just a fraction. Tony stopped moving.
. “You… I made you feel like you had to choose me over Ty, and think you needed to prove you weren’t ashamed of me or whatever, and I don’t—I never… it was me. Your dad kicked you out because of me, and I’m sorry, Tony. I can’t tell you how much. I never wanted you to… not that this was your fault, at all, okay, it was me being stupid and shitty and—”
But there was no way back now, and nothing to lose. So he might as well just dive right in and take what he wanted.
“Oh God no, I’m joking Tony, it’s fine, seriously,” Steve laughed again, “you’re here now, that’s all that matters. Don’t give a shit what you look like. Did you say your bike broke down, though? Is that why you were late?”
Nothing. Just a throbbing pain when he delved too hard. He winced, pulling back and then huffing irritably.
Tony breathed in sharply, the hand not holding onto Steve’s clenching impossibly tight against his side. Steve made a soothing noise in the back of his throat and leaned forward, taking the balled up fist and trying to smooth it out before he ended up straining something. Or punching something.
Mrs. Wilson was waiting for him when he finally got let out of detention an hour after school finished.
A distraction was what he needed. He was tired, he didn’t want to get out of bed unless he really had to, so he’d simply have to find a way to relax. Persuade himself to shut his eyes without hearing… that.
“This isn’t up for debate,” Tony told her sharply, but she just rolled her eyes and then fell into step next to him, shoulders brushing as they hurried out of the venue.
“I’m not—” Steve’s cheeks flushed, and he stroked his hand through Peter’s downy hair once more before stepping away and shrugging nonchalantly. Peter glanced up at him, hands going upward to try and get back the fingers that had previously been running through his hair. He was such an attention-seeker, honestly. “I’m not overreacting. I just know how difficult he can get if you don’t get him down properly.”
“Steve?” Tony’s voice sounded concerned now, “Steve, what’s going on? Why are you whispering? Is something-“
“No, I’m… I don’t mean it like it was just you making a dumb decision on the field- although it was dumb. Very, very dumb,” Steve said with an unhappy intake of breath, finally looking Tony in the eye, “but it’s not about that. This is about you being hurt and me… me being hurt because you’re in pain. Because that’s always what happens. You get injured and I just… I go nuts, okay,  I
Tony tilted his chin and looked around the room. “What we do now, is we protect him. With everything we have at our disposal.”
“It’s either gonna be Rhodey or Steve that gets this, seeing as you’re the ones most likely to be nosying around in my shop, so, uh—Rhodey, if you’re there, then I’d just like to say that I’m offended you didn’t suit up to help me out when the giant donut fell from the sky. Dick move, bro, and I’m gonna totally beat you up for that when I next see you. I had to deal with a group of the galaxy’s biggest idiots all on my own.” He rolled his eyes and smiled again, and across the room, Rhodey did too, arms folding as he shook his head fondly. Then Tony’s face fell, and he looked down again. Everyone’s head turned to face Steve in the room.
everything he did was so sporadic and Steve couldn’t find a pattern, a link between any of the causes. Tony was a complete and utter enigma.
Wriggling out of Bucky’s hold, he ducked under the arm that stretched across the door and looked both ways.
Tony rolled his eyes, standing up and cracking his back. “Well, luckily you’ve got us to jog your memory. Let’s go eat, Brucie.”
There was a pause in the room, long and heavy. Steve couldn’t look at the other man. Too scared. Too cowardly.
“Asset,” Tony said again, “I…. please, Steve? Please. Don’t leave.” God, none of the words were fucking coming out right and he knew it, they must all be laughing at him so goddamned hard right now-
Eventually, Bruce just shrugged. “We used to share classes,” he said, and Tony nodded in agreement, looking down at his hands.
The stupid boy in question was stood at the threshold of the door, looking supremely awkward as he stared into the kitchen and across all three of them. When his eyes caught Steve’s, he shuffled back on his feet and looked down. Steve noticed in shock, that in the space between going to school that day and turning up here, Tony had managed to accumulate about a dozen more scrapes and bruises. He looked as if he was leaning a little more on his left side.
Steve was silent for a second, before he cleared his throat and answered. “What if we didn’t let them go.”
Later that night, Steve lay flat out on Tony’s king-sized bed, staring up at the ceiling while Tony trailed absent patterns across his chest. A light sheen of sweat coated his skin, and everything felt so light and airy, relaxed in a way he hadn’t been in so long. He ached a little, but it was okay. It was a good ache.
Tony swallowed, feeling the way the words stabbed through his chest just a little bit. He’d thought that he was getting better at the whole ‘relationship’ stuff- Steve had always said he was doing fine, but... well, now it seemed that a little bit of the truth was coming out tonight. It was correct, he supposed. Steve wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t.
Clint huffed and clapped him on the back. “The med-team should be here in half a minute. Just sit tight- Widow’ll be here imminently too, and we can see whether we can work out how to turn off the defences of this bad boy.” He shot Steve a wry look. “Told you we should have brought Tony.”
,” and Tony had stumbled to his feet now, eyes pleading as he curled his other hand around Steve’s wrist and stepped forward. He looked- he looked
A second of blackness, and then the face of what had once been Doctor Lewinsky gazed right at him, looking into the camera. “October 7th, 2015,” she began crisply, placing her hands on the desk, “Doctor Amelia Lewinsky, overseer of Test Subject 02. After six unsuccessful attempts, we finally have a stable test subject who has yet to show any complications upon its birth. Heart rate is steady, respiratory system functioning fully, and all cognitive responses seem to be normal. No visible defects as of yet. Seeing as the test subject has only just been born, I will be overseeing the care of it. Preliminary testing will begin once we are sure it can withstand as much.”
Steve nodded in agreement and snuggled down further. "If all goes to plan, there won't have to be a tomorrow," he said, before kissing Tony's forehead and running his hands up and down Tony's arms, "let's try get some sleep before he wakes up again."
before realizing that, being the insanely clever person he is, he just managed to expose himself and his clothe-stealing ways right in front of the man himself.
God, that was tempting. Unfortunately, he had the feeling that if he got comfortable in the tub with Steve, he’d never end up leaving. It was hard enough to just sit here and
Steve looked around at all of his friends- at their soft faces and open smiles as they slowly continued the conversations they’d been having before Steve had joined them again- and felt something soften a little bit inside him. He smiled tiredly back at them and felt Sam’s hand pat his back, felt Natasha’s shoulder rest against his.
Reed brought the pen up and uncapped it, then drew a line. “This is the timeline,” he began, “before yesterday. Before it all happened. Of course, in reality, thousands of branches were being made with every decision you took, but that’s irrelevant. We only need to focus on two.” He drew a V shape at the end of the line with an unsteady hand. “The timeline where events conspired to mean that Tony lived,” he pointed to the top diagonal line, “and the timeline we are on, where he died.” He pointed to the bottom.
Steve rolled his eyes, picking up all the groceries. “Yeah, well, I’m not exactly known for my self preservation instincts.”
But there was no need to worry. Tony’s smile was soft, reverent, and he nodded his head while his own fingers wrapped around the back of Steve’s hand, guiding it toward his chest. It settled across the fabric of his shirt, and Steve shut his eyes as he let the sound of that soft thrumming swell in his ears. It was more comforting than anything else could’ve been just then, and Steve sighed quietly, nudging himself a little closer to Tony’s side. He was warm and lax, the dips and edges of his body so wonderfully familiar as they pressed against Steve.
Of course, when Steve saw Tony trudging up the hill, his face broke out into a smile reserved only for him. His shoulders relaxed a little. He looked more like himself. “Morning,” he said easily, his hand finding Tony’s and helping him up the hill with a small tug. His skin was deliciously cool against Tony’s overheated fingers. He hated walking,
Both Tony and Steve stared at the two tags, resting against the glass casing which gave them a strange sort of blue halo as the light shone around them.
work this out, okay, and if we are going to do that, you need to tell me what helps. Anything at all, okay?”
Clint laughed, and it pulled him out of his thought spiral as he remembered to throw a peanut shell at the boy. It didn’t deter him, though, because after he’d pulled the little shell from his hair, he just went right back to looking at Steve questioningly. “Come on, man, you’ve been giving us the bare bones for weeks now. We wanna know the details!”
“Perks of being a billionaire,” Tony answered, and then Steve heard quiet footfalls coming closer and shut his eyes once more, rubbing a hand across closed eyelids.
Natasha frowned. “I didn’t,” she said, while Bruce and Thor shook their heads too. They all turned their heads to the living room on the other side of the penthouse, eyes narrowing. “CLINT!” Natasha yelled in irritation.
, no kicking—I just need to get you to keep still for a moment, alright?” He ducked under another swinging punch and then blocked the oncoming knee that came up to meet him, before shoving Steve away and blasting ten feet into the air. Steve went stumbling back a few steps, eyes going back to Tony. But before he could recalibrate, Tony was descending on him rapidly, arms outstretched, repulsors firing.
like Tony, realistically speaking- but how much of it was to do with that fact that they were obligated to? And how much would that amicability lessen once they came to the conclusion that they didn’t have to worry about Iron Man leaving the team anymore, because they’d already got a replacement?
in the Middle East- wasn’t the man that Steve loved. And if Tony really was Iron Man, then he clearly hadn’t been that man in a long time. Maybe even before Steve had left him. “You want me to try and use my connection with him to get some intel.”
“Ha ha,” Steve muttered, palming his forehead and then jumping down off the desk to collect the bunches of papers that had scattered everywhere, “I’m getting sassed by a fucking robot, Jesus Christ, this wasn’t what I signed up for-“
But it was too late to change his mind. Joints were already bending, limbs crumbling downward toward the juncture between floor and wall. Steve slipped quietly down, eyes shutting of their own accord as he went. In any normal circumstance when one of them ended up staying at a hospital overnight, they’d share the cot, curled in one another and gently making sure no injuries were pressed upon. In any normal circumstance, Steve would go to sleep knowing that Tony was there, safe in his arms. He’d bury his head into that the light of the arc reactor, or let Tony snuggle down into the warmth of his neck, breathing him in. They’d be with one another.
Tony nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, I’ll—I need to find my own place though, I guess? I can’t just sofa surf forever.” He paused for a moment, then flexed his hands. “I got a couple hundred dollars in cash back in the car, that… well, that might see me through ‘til I can get a job. And I mean, I’m smart. Someone will take me.”
Tony grinned. “I know a guy. This old dude called Yinsen, met him at a science convention a while back, it’s kinda complicated. But I’ve been going over and fixing shit for him for years now. He’s a landlord for a block of apartments down in lower Manhattan, and I do him favours whenever he needs them, and in return he hooks me up with more contacts, usually MIT people or buddies in the engineering field. Sometimes he just invites me round for dinner though. As you can see, I’ve been planning this escape for a while now,” Tony wiggled his eyebrows cheekily, and then rubbed his hands together in glee. “But he’s… he’s a good guy. One of the most genuine people I know. And he knows, kinda, what’s going on with Howard. So he offered to give me one of the flats in his apartment complex, with a stupidly low rent. It’s kinda shitty, and small, but it’ll do. And in return, I’ll act as his on-site handyman.”
Steve watched Howard’s shoes come forward, stumbling a little. He could tell from voice alone that the man was off his face. On what, Steve couldn’t tell. “Was. But we finished early, then Obie was acting like a faggot and saying he wanted out of our deal so I bailed on him. He always argues like such’a little bitch when he’s drunk.” Howard clicked his teeth and Tony said nothing. Steve didn’t hear a single spring in the mattress creak. The boy was being unnaturally still.
“Mm, change of plans,” Thor muttered, pulling Jane back into his lap, “I accidentally got drunk instead. It was a very good sacrifice to make, I think. I’ll call a cab later.”
“Come on,” he said with a laugh, watching as Tony attempted to reboot himself and follow along, “we’ve- well, actually I guess we
Carol touched down, and Steve stopped thinking entirely. Stopped considering anything other than the fact that Tony was in there, on that ship, Oh God, please,
There was the faintest sound of hissing as all the catches and releases in Tony’s suit locked up, and JARVIS quickly processed the orders Tony had given him. There. He was now essentially locked into this Tin-Can until he got back to base and could disable it manually. Or it was forcibly ripped off him.
“Tony,” Steve blurted before he could stop himself, just trying to pull back Tony’s attention for a second, “please just- just let me explain, I told you in the texts I sent, it’s not what you think-“
“Hey!” Steve called, and Bucky’s head turned, looking up at him, “Go fuck yourself, Fuckhead!” He finished, before sticking two fingers up and ducking his head back inside.
“I’m fine,” Steve smacked his hands away with a fond roll of his eyes, “seriously, this is nothing. Should’a seen me back in Brooklyn- coming home black and blue every other day.”
“It will never happen again, Tony.” Steve whispered, his lips feather-light against Tony’s forehead.
It was a very large problem. It was a very large problem that happened at four different intervals throughout the night.
“Spit and curse at you and make people fear financial ruin?” Tony pulled a face. “Easy as breathing.”
buddies. Trying to pretend they’re your friends. But you need to snap out of it, and go back to where you really belong. Make a fucking choice, Tony, because I’m not going to just sit and wait for you to get bored. This is last fucking straw. I won’t let him insult me, and I sure as hell won’t stand for you taking his side over mine.” He took a breath and then grinned maliciously, arms folding into his chest. “So- you wanna come back to us and make sure I keep my mouth shut to Howard, or would you rather go off and make daisy chains with Steve?”
“If anyone had a problem, it’d be them leaving, not you,” Steve said simply, before pushing open the door and then leading Tony in. “Hey guys- Tony’s here.”
“Wilson, no form of physical violence is considered justifiable in this school, and after this debacle, you can guarantee that that place on the program is being put under review,” Fury snapped at him, and Sam’s face went tight. He sat up a little straighter and curled his hands into fists stubbornly.
“He met me when I was getting beat up behind school. He was having a smoke, I think, and when he came ‘round the corner he just stared at all three of ‘em for a second, put the cigarette in his mouth and then kicked all their asses without even breaking a sweat. It was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen, actually- but that’s derailing from the point,” Peter waved a hand, “anyway- yeah, afterward he fixed me up and bought me lunch, cuz they’d stolen all my money. He was nice to me- and like, back then, barely anyone was nice to me. But at the end of it, he said it was a one-off thing. That he was only doing it because he didn’t like people taking up his spot.” Peter pulled a face, but then it turned into a grin as he added “it was only a one-off until it became a two-off. Then a three-off. Tony talks the talk, but at the end of the day, he really does care. And eventually, he just gave up trying to pretend he didn’t give a shit about me.”
On the third day of sitting outside Tony’s room and checking with the Doctors that he was improving, he heard a sharp voice from the window. “I can see you, you know, idiot.”
Tony groaned quietly in despair, eyes shutting as he grabbed Steve’s hands and then pulled them away from his jacket, a pout on his mouth. “I can, and I would very much
Next to him on the bed, Natasha waved a hand. “We figured we could override the rule just once, due to extenuating circumstances.”
“I think we’ve lost ‘em, Brucie,” Steve heard Natasha say, her voice somewhere between exasperated and amused. Steve was too busy thinking about how Tony was slowly starting to grind on him to apologise to them, and quite frankly, he didn’t even have the heart to feel guilty about it.
“Hello, Steve!” He said joyfully, “I was just looking for Tony. Thank you for finding him for me- I hope you’re feeling well?” He asked, craning his head around Tony’s stomach in order to look in concern at Steve. No doubt he was thinking back to their last meeting.
“Okay, fine, be happy if you really have to,” he surrendered in the end, rolling his eyes and then trying not to smile when he saw the grin Tony sent him in the reflection of the mirror, “just don’t expect me to come back after this, that’s all.”
Of course, Tony was correct. It wasn’t fun at all. He and Steve religiously trawled through each segment of information in Tony’s workshop, hunting for extra information, anything at all that they could find. Unfortunately, it seemed that Lewinsky’s work had only been about developmental milestones after his birth and not any of the science behind Peter’s initial creation or the DNA that he was carrying. That seemed to have been the responsibility of a different faction. Tony had thrown back a glass and a half of whiskey before he’d started looking through the files again, unable to handle it all without the Dutch Courage of alcohol to ease his way, and even then, his hands never stopped shaking, not for the whole night. Steve wasn’t much better either—he was quiet, achingly quiet, as he looked through all the information Lewinsky had on her phone, and every twenty minutes or so he abruptly left the room for a short while in order to take a small break from it all.
He spluttered a few times, trying to make sense of the sudden arrival of each one of his friends in his room. They were all staring at him expectantly, like they expected him to do something glorious at 9:50 in the morning.
It allowed Rumlow to dart forward, extend his arm like a snake pouncing on its prey, with something dangerous glinting in his right hand.
Steve choked again, and Tony waited patiently by his side until he was finished. “It wasn’t just your ass,” he said in the end, a little weakly, “you have a very nice…everything.”
Steve gasped in surprise, hands rising to curl around Tony’s arms as he was pushed back a little by Tony’s weight against him. His mouth was warm, lips soft, and it felt like he was smiling as their teeth bumped slightly.
“He won’t hurt you, really, he’s not even capable, he’s trapped in this house for now and I would never even let him in the first place, please don’t freak out- Jesus Christ JARVIS we
He tucked himself back into the covers and shut his eyes, mind drifting to Tony’s friends and their words. It concerned him a little, that they had to do that. Made something twist in his gut- because what kind of people must Tony have been associating with before, to make his two friends so nervous? It wasn’t right, and it didn’t make sense to him. Tony didn’t belong with the people he hung out with- Ty and Justin and Sunset and all the worst kids in school. He belonged with people who actually cared. Like Steve.
Tony hovered at the threshold, however, his face falling once more. “Is- uh- I take it Bucky isn’t too happy with me,” he said, eyes flitting nervously around the space, “which, you know- this one is valid, I’m not gonna… but I probably shouldn’t-“
Tony complained at the nurses the entire time- he’d done this rodeo before, taking out his arc reactor Slash pacemaker had never caused any lasting damage from what he knew, and he was perfectly fine to function afterward. They questioned the pace of it, told him it was too fast to be normal, and Tony snappily informed them it was probably because his boyfriend’s own heart had just stopped less than an hour ago, so sue him for being a little fucking anxious. He didn’t mention that he really was feeling exhausted, like he’d spent a whole day doing weight training until every muscle ached. They’d only keep him in longer, and every moment spent getting checked on himself meant a moment he was away from Steve. And at that moment, he really didn’t want to be away from Steve.
Tony, after an impressive 9 days in the wheelchair, had decided to fuck it and put himself onto crutches instead, and Steve hadn’t said a word about it. He hadn’t tried to argue, hadn’t attempted to convince Tony otherwise. He’d just… swallowed it all down and then asked Tony how his day had been. All arguments, quarrels, simple morning-time bickers over who had rights to the last slice of bread just vanished. Steve let him win. Every time.
“I’ll leave you to it,” Tony patted him on the chest and then wandered into the kitchen at the same time Steve began to try and fend off whatever attack Thor was about to launch at him. Clint waved from on top of the fridge, and Tony just shot him the bird. “You’re a dick.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile fondly- Tony must have been pretty tired to be this far gone. “Do I want to know why you decided to change the world of physics forever whilst sat in your underwear in the middle of our bedroom, using-” he turned a little, holding the door as it suddenly collapsed,
Peter gave him a long look, raising his eyebrows. “He doesn’t think he deserves it, duh. Pretty sure he’s convinced he’s cursed or somethin’- anything that goes near him is destined for a fate worse than death or whatever- like I said, I don’t know what he's thinking,” Peter waved a hand again, frowning.
“I’ll call you later,” Tony confirmed, grabbing his suitcase from the side of the desk and then his phone from off the nightstand while Steve eyed him, that little note of concern still tangible in his eyes. “Promise.” He gave Steve his most genuine smile and leaned down, kissing the top of his boyfriend’s tangled hair.
Steve laughed and then with a final kiss, he turned away and started walking up the sidewalk, hands in the pockets of Tony’s leather jacket. It was a little big on him, and hung loosely over his shoulders, but still… he looked good.
Steve snuck a hand around Tony’s wrist before he could sit up, shaking his head in amusement and pulling Tony back down for another kiss. “No takebacks now,” he informed the other man, “you’re stuck with me, Stark.”
wanted to explore that thoroughly at some point. But, back to his point—maybe that was what Tony was missing so much. Maybe he kept getting little tastes of it every time he kissed Steve. Was that a thing? He’d have to ask. Although, if it turned out that it
“Hey hey hey, it’s alright, it’s okay-“ someone wrapped their hands around his clenched fists and slowly uncurled them, and when Steve looked up through blurry eyes, Tony’s face was there, staring at him in concern. “Just… just breathe, Steve, it’s alright- I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to… are you okay? I just thought- I mean you’d said you’d wanted it back and I thought… but I shouldn’t have assumed, I’m really sorry-“
“It was stupid,” Tony said, embarrassment pooling in his gut, “I should have known better, it won’t happen again-“
“Well, we can pretend this conversation never happened and that I didn’t embarrass myself by trying to look smart in front you.” He thought he heard Tony’s grin through the words, and couldn’t help but roll his eyes to it. “I will get on the line to the wonderful Sargent down there at ground level, and see if he’s up for some collaborative action.”
Steve acted on instinct, flying away from the flash of silver blade as it stabbed for his midsection. He didn’t have time to avoid it completely, however, and there was a sting of agony as the skin across his waist ripped open, warmth spilling immediately onto his shirt. He cursed, but didn’t look down; instead keeping his eye on the knife that the other man was holding. Steve didn’t know why it was Brock fucking Rumlow of all people who had found him. From the brief once-over Steve had given him as he’d entered the room, it looked like he may have been in the training rooms working a punching bag or something. Maybe the man was smarter than Steve had given him credit for, and worked out that they’d need to be on a floor without bulletproofed glass if they wanted to escape. Maybe he’d been on the way down from the upper floors and had just happened to hear the two of them on the other side of the door. Maybe he’d just gotten lucky.
“Tony,” Bucky said with a roll of his eyes, pushing Tony in the shoulder before he could continue, “it won’t last long. You can just stay here and hide if you really want-”
Bucky just grunted, uncrossing and then re-crossing his legs over Tony’s lap. “S’pose he’s not that bad, really,” he muttered eventually, and then propelled a peanut across the room when Steve just grinned, “shut up, punk.”
“They ruined my blanket fort,” he said again a few minutes later, and when Steve turned back to look at him, Tony was staring at him with an adorable pout on his face. “I
Clint was frozen in place for a minute, before he ran a hand through his hair and shook his head. “Don’t say shit like that, Steve,” he responded, “I don’t wanna hear that.”
The layout inside was simple, they discovered quickly. Lots of wood and faded blankets draped across well-loved couches. There was a spacious living room, a bathroom with a tub and a faulty shower, and a bedroom with a bed that was about half the size of what they were used to. Tony laughed when he saw the gaudy yellow covers, then laughed harder when he saw the saw the pillows that had been adorned with cow embroidery, throwing one of them at Steve to let him look.
Steve tried to remember what words were, and how exactly he was supposed to be using them. “Mmm,” was the diplomatic answer he came up with in the end, “I… food.”
He knew what it was. Knew what he felt. It had been pretty obvious that he was crushing on the guy since the first day- but he could tell that this was more than that. He knew what falling in love felt like.
He paused for a moment and then huffed. “When that didn’t work, I pulled out my A-game and told him you needed as much support you could get, and if he cared about you at all, he’d stick around and look out for you.”
There was that ache, back in his heart again. He realized with a pang that there was still so much about Tony that he didn’t know. So much that he really
Tony hummed, fingers poking absently at a couple of petri dishes before Bruce smacked his hand away and then got back to whatever he was typing up on his computer. Tony quickly settled down into some work of his own- Clint’s sticky arrows were decidedly Not Sticky enough, and Tony had been trying to work out which formulae would work best for
The Baxter Building’s official hours were from 9 to 5. When Steve arrived, it was 4:45. This did not stop him.
“Bucky-“ Steve began warningly, but his best friend turned quickly to him and shot him a look that said a lot of things in a very short space of time. Mostly just ‘trust me’.
When he got bored with the prowling, Rumlow sat in the seat opposite Tony and leaned back, setting his feet casually on the desk. Tony’s eyes flicked to the shoes, and his lip curled ever so slightly in distaste. Rumlow didn’t seem to notice. “How’s things, Tony?” He asked cheerily, cocking his head as he looked toward the other man.
And although what he wanted didn’t really matter, and logic and reason needed to be kept in mind, Tony still didn’t consider speaking that out into the darkness. Here, he didn’t even need to think about any of that. He just needed to say what he felt, truly, in his soul.
Behind them, Clint clapped, long and slow. “Yeah, okay then Steve, get Stark to deal with your shit. You know he’d do anything for you- look after your sorry ass just because you say please, let you use him as your fucking punching bag, if that’s what you felt like. Hell, you know his rep- probably spread his legs if you batted your eyelashes right-”
Then Tony moved. Jerked forward and hoisted his knee up, clambering onto the bed clumsily. His hands dropped to help lift himself up, but once he was settled, he reached down straight for Steve’s hand, pulling it up and squeezing it between his fingers. “Wanna know how I trust you?” He asked. “Marry me.”
“Tony,” Tiberius said, the same stupid smile sticking to his face as he shook his head down at Steve, like he was some sort of insolent child, “I’ve seen you around. With him. But believe me, that is not going to work out. Tony- he isn’t known for staying long. Picks up a new toy every few months, that’s just what he’s like. He finds someone interesting and then likes to make them feel special for a bit, make them think he cares. But he gets bored. He’ll drop you when he does.” Ty shrugged casually, patting Steve on the back, “you just stay with your little friends, and leave us. You don’t belong with someone like Tony, and he doesn’t really want someone like you. Not really. He’s not who you think he is- no matter what he’ll have you believe.”
DUM-E rolled back over to him and dropped the ball on the coffee table with a metallic clink. Steve grinned as he picked it up. “You should install Heelys on this guy,” he commented as he threw the ball gently.
The video cut out, and immediately left a sour taste at the back of Tony’s throat. He assumed, when Lewinsky said ‘test subject’ and ‘it’, she meant Peter. He tapped his hand against the desk impatiently. “Jay, autoplay the rest. I’ll tell you when to stop.”
Like a meerkat, Steve watched Tony’s head pop up, hair falling in messy strands over his face and sticking out at random angles. He too, smiled brightly, and extended a hand out across the room. “Steve!” He exclaimed, “we’re building a pillow fort!”
Steve really just didn’t belong with a boy like Tony Stark. That much had been obvious tonight, when Steve had seen the tiniest of glimpses into the sort of circles Tony usually hung out in. Fur coats and Gucci socks and Lobster Thermidor, and what did Steve had to offer in retaliation? He didn’t even have a proper family, for Christ’s sake, and he could barely string the money together to buy a new toothbrush. He and his friends’ ideas of fun was going to hang out at the mall and occasionally shoplifting a candy bar from Walmart if they were all too broke to feed into the Cycle of Capitalism, as Natasha called it, with their own money. That wasn’t exactly the sort of thing a guy like Tony would probably enjoy. Not really. Even though he said he did, when they all hung out together.
“Why does Tony like him, then?” He asked, but Thor just shook his head and then sat properly again, looking at all of them gravely.
end up turning into an asshole who hurts Tony on purpose for whatever reason, I give you permission to go full terminator on me.”
JARVIS, SHUT UP!” Tony shouted, so loud and so angry that Steve and Thor both instinctively leaned back. The AI went quiet, the small orange circle laying still on the screen. Tony’s lip wobbled and his breath hitched again, so close to the edge.
It felt like there was a gaping wound right in the middle of Steve’s chest. He didn’t even know what to do with himself. How to act. None of them did.
Steve stopped, looking around in surprise at the thing he was sat in and remembering that this wasn’t actually what Tony drove. “This is your dad’s?” He asked quietly.
“Miss Romanov,” he slid up to her side smoothly and placed a hand around her arm, starting to tug her sideways, “I’m going to have to monopolize your attention for a moment—Avengers Business, you know the drill.” Shooting a knowing smile over to the group of people she had previously been talking to, he led her away to a quieter area and then turned her to face him. “We’ve got a situation.”
Well, lots of things, but Steve wasn’t thinking about that right now. He was tired of thinking himself into a panic about everything.
person would. But Steve wasn’t one of those people. Steve was a fucking monster. Designed for war, programmed to kill. He was a pimped up weapon with a conscious, and Tony had paid the price for attempting to get close to him. Someone always fucking paid the price.
“Uh,” Steve’s voice was quieter than usual, and he noticed it wavering with uncertainty and, though he was loathe to admit it, fear. “You- you wouldn’t happen to know where abouts Turner street in Lower Manhattan is, would you?”
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” Tony whispered, voice teetering mortifyingly close to hysterical, “I don’t—I’m not even fucking… I’m sorry, I’m so fucking sorry, God, this is embarrassing, you should just. You should go, go back downstairs, I’m fine, just having a moment-“
“So,” Tony cleared his throat and attempted to act like there was anything vaguely normal about this situation, “you’re telling me Steve was hit with a… pheromone, of sorts. Which has given him… pack instincts?”
And now, here they all were. Five Avengers in their pajamas, all staring in disbelief at the small baby boy in his arms, sleeping soundly.
Except when he looked up, Steve had moved an awful lot closer, and before he could even begin to yell, his mouth became occupied.
Steve’s face twisted in disgust. It seemed a little overdramatic considering the nature of their argument, but before Tony could pull him up for the exaggerated glare, Steve’s next words permeated the room.
Without a word, Tony wound his fingers around Steve’s bony elbow and pulled it up gently. Steve, eyes wide, watched him in bewilderment and attempted not to shiver from the touch. Tony’s fingers were very warm.
Toy looked up with wide eyes, the shining blue suddenly a few shades darker, like an ocean in storm- and just seeing him like that, splayed out underneath Steve, with his hair falling back onto the bed and his hands still gripping tight to Steve’s hips- it was enough to make him crazy with want.
He made his way slowly toward the main entrance, peering into the garage on his way up and noting the array of cars on display. The red Ferrari- the one that belonged to Tony’s dad- wasn’t there, though, and Steve wondered if that had anything to do with the fact that Tony had invited him over.
Tony wanted to roll his eyes, but he didn’t trust himself not to puke. “Fucking relax,” he snapped, “I’m fine. Didn’t work anyway, so I’m gonna have to get back to work. Gotta make everyone a new… thing.”
man. We did everything in our power to get dirt on you, to find something incriminating enough to at least start a case against you, but in the end all we needed was a buff blond bimbo and you sang like a fucking bird.”
Tony looked at him wryly, tongue brushing over his bottom lip absently as he flicked his hair back out of his eyes and then turned to face Steve a little more obviously. “What makes you think my night was ruined? I love ferrying confrontational blondes around New York when they’re too drunk to stand on their own two feet.”
The Avengers came together a few more times, taking down a few more big hostile situations that cropped up, HYDRA facilities and attempted takeovers and the like. They worked incredibly well together, Steve could see that from the get-go. Hell, even when they’d
Sam made a face, gesturing vaguely with his hands. "You can't really be a guy like Albert Einstein and also be a nerd, y'know? He was too badass to be a nerd."
of their Avengers Tower. This spot was almost impossible to get to without prior knowledge of its existence- Tony was confident that they weren’t about to be caught any time soon.
Tony smelt so familiar. Metallic. He must not have showered since taking off the suit, because Steve could still smell it on him. He took a deep breath of it, pressing his mouth against Tony’s hair and wrapping his arms delicately around Tony’s waist. He couldn’t help it. He just had to
Steve made a face, but Sam started tugging at his elbow gently, pulling him back in the direction of the living room. “Just let him do his thing, man,” he whispered, “he wants to make this right. At least let him try.”
“Yes I do. I really, really do,” Steve tells him gently, standing close to Tony, almost forehead to forehead, and of course Tony was whispering to himself again, that was a
“How fucking dare you,” he said, voice quiet, “you think I’m what, just there to love him and leave him? You think I want his money? Fame? You’re coming into my house, accusing me of shit when you don’t even
Bruce, after a silent conversation with Tony, nodded and then walked quietly out of the room with a small smile in Steve’s direction, leaving the two of them alone in the hospital room. Steve was still staring at Tony, somewhat unwilling to believe anything that was happening. His head hurt, and he felt tired. Exhausted, even, despite the fact Bruce had said he’d been out for days. Nothing was making sense. “I… I hurt you,” he muttered, looking up at Tony somewhat disbelievingly, “I remember, I—I thought I’d—”
And then, after an eternity, the world stopped shaking. Everything stilled, and Steve groaned loudly, more so that he could hear his own voice than anything.
“Tony,” he said numbly, walking forward and sinking to his knees in front of the beautiful demon, his beautiful demon, “
“Hey Tony, Steve,” he said, looking down at them for a moment before turning back to the rest, “what are you guys doing indoors at break? Thought you’d be out on the quad getting your hourly nicotine fix?”
Steve just sneered. And it was weird- Steve didn’t do that, he never sneered. “Yeah, thanks, I know that,” he snapped, “but you said you’d come home nearly two hours ago. What the hell were you doing?”
“Oh, Steve,” Rhodey breathed out his name in the end, and it sounded like a sigh, “I… fuck, okay, long story short- yeah, Bucky, I think you’re right. I never asked him and he’s never said, but I think… I get the same thing, sometimes. Not as bad as what happened here, but sometimes we’re just chilling and then… specific things can set him off. Give him weird sorta-not-really-panic-attacks. Usually the sound of Howard’s car engine, or his shoes on the floor. Sometimes it can be phrases. But he’ll go from relaxed to completely alert in a split second, and suddenly he’ll be telling me I gotta go, or that
Tony and Steve looked at one another across the room, both of them analysing the other with intense eyes. Steve wished he could get inside that boy’s brain—just find out what the Goddamn hell he was thinking. He wondered if Tony thought the same. Although, probably not. Tony always seemed to be able to read him like a damn book.
Thor turned to him, then. Tony noted that he was wearing boxers and nothing else. “I’ve been to Hel and heard quieter screams than his.”
The last thing he saw was Tony pressing a kiss against his own fingers and then brushing them across Steve’s cheek. Then his eyes closed against his will, plunging him into darkness.
Steve looked at him helplessly, then glanced at the baby. His mouth opened and shut a few times, and Tony was about to admit defeat and wake Bruce when, without much warning, Steve started to sing.
Tony froze up, keeping very still as Steve slowly padded into the bathroom, showering for a minute to get the sweat off and then quickly brushing his teeth. It’d been about two hours since their blowup in the kitchen, and so Tony should have been asleep. But instead he was wide awake, thinking of everything he’d done wrong. He needed to be better for Steve if he wanted to keep him, and that needed to start by Tony toning it down with the flirting. Maybe he’d thought Steve didn’t mind it before, but now he was aware, and he had to keep Steve happy. That was what was important.
A second later, and the room was deathly quiet again, only Steve’s heavy breathing permeating the room. He was dizzy, shaking. His mouth tasted like blood, and he wasn’t sure whether it was psychosomatic or whether he’d just torn through this lip.
“I’m-” Steve began again, before remembering Tony had told him to stop and letting the beginning of the word sit on his throat. He shuddered violently and buried his face deep into Tony’s neck, clutching tight to the other man’s body. “I- I couldn’t… nightmare, I- I- I don’t… I just can’t lose you Tony, I can’t, I can’t do it,
And without another second to debate the matter, the mighty Hulk turned tail and sprinted out of the kitchen, leaving Tony sitting with a lapful of pooey baby. He blinked a few times, desperately trying to resist the urge to emit a truly foul string of curses. “Hulk is a god-damn coward,” Tony declared loudly instead, turning to Steve and then Peter and waggling a finger. “You hear me? He’s a gigantic fucking wimp. I want you to remember that when you grow up, kid. If you learn only one thing while you’re here, it should be that.”
The others were relatively okay. Natasha had already come back around, and although her arm was definitely broken and she was suffering a mild concussion, she’d live. Rhodey had also only suffered a flesh-wound, the bullet piercing through flesh only. Bruce had been punched around a few times, but his self-defence training had pulled trough and he’d come out on top, so he was only facing a few bruises and some sore muscles in the morning. They could live another few days in here.
Rhodey nodded. “We managed to get a handgun off one of the HYDRA agents before we had to retreat, but there’s only three bullets left in it. Nat’s got her big fuck-off knife, I’ve got a tiny pathetic pen-knife, Bruce has nothing, but we’re working on booby-trapping the cabin so that if anyone
Steve was still asleep when he came back into their room, lying motionless and peaceful, half his body still strewn across Tony’s side of the bed. Tony smiled at him for a moment, but it melted away back into a frown as soon as his mind properly got ahold of the thought. Steve was lying motionless. Because he was asleep. Clearly.
of his fingers as they hit the surface. He’d used to cut them into precise slices, when he was little. Or at least, his mom had. A rather random gesture, yes, but she’d always made sure he got four equal quarters with the sharpest knife in the cupboard that she’d never let him use himself. For a few months, he hadn’t wanted the skin at all, and made her cut that off too. She looked at him like he was mad, but done it all the same.
Every day, Steve wished that he’d done things differently. Wished that he’d just had the fucking sense to say something. In hindsight, he knew that Tony wouldn’t have stopped searching for Bucky. Or, at the very least, he wouldn’t have stopped Steve from searching. Tony was a hero and a good man, and it would have hurt him, but not nearly as much as it had from finding out in the way that he had.
He couldn’t help but laugh as he nodded. “Yes, Tony. The civilian sort of retreat, with a farm in Ohio and a road-trip to get there, and no responsibilities at all for seven days. I’ve got everything set, if you say yes. Someone else can run my duties for a while, and I rescheduled my Op. And there’s good wifi so you can still talk with R&D or work on the blueprints.” He leaned his chin into Tony’s arc reactor and looked up at him through his eyelashes, shooting Tony his best puppy-eyed stare. “Say yes?” He asked sweetly.
Steve is on one of his art-binges, that much is obvious. There is paint… everywhere; on the walls, on the plastic sheets that are littered around the floor, and then a large portion of it concentrated on the easel in front of Steve.
“Clint, what did we say about keeping our clothes on?” Someone groaned, and Tony could feel the vibrations of Steve laughing on top of him, his face crinkled and smiling from ear to ear.
Rolling back upright, he crawled back over to his window and tentatively peeked outside again. Bucky had disappeared. Steve felt a slight pang of guilt at refusing him after he’d traveled all the way down from Brooklyn, but it wasn’t enough to make him regret it. He didn’t want to talk at that point.
It was… a massive fucking blow, to say the least. They’d tried so hard to stop him, and in the end, he’d run off with the two most powerful objects in the universe anyway.
Above him, Tony’s jaw was tight, and Steve internally cursed himself out. He should have just dropped it. “It doesn’t matter, you’re right, sorry, I was just—”
Either way- those feelings still came flooding into him, almost from the moment he woke up and saw the date flashing on his alarm clock. They followed him to breakfast and lingered in the corner of his room as he got changed, and it was with a resigned sort of sigh that he eventually gave up trying to ignore it and pull himself away from those thoughts.
“Stay away from him, Stark, do you hear me?” Bucky snarled, and Tony got to his feet in bewilderment, brushing the dirt off his jeans and then staring at the two of them incredulously. “Stay away from Steve. I’m not gonna tell you again.”
This time it was Clint who laughed, and Tony who pulled the face. “I think we should engage in other activities first,” he argued, beginning to kiss Steve’s neck in an attempt at conviction.
Steve’s chest heaved with quiet laughter, and his hand tightened around Tony’s fondly. “Sexting via carrier-pigeon. How very World-War-Two of you.”
In response, Steve pulled it harder. Tony just rolled his eyes and then threw up his hands, seemingly defeated. “Okay, okay. I’ll… if that’s really okay with you and the Wilsons, I- I’d like that, thank you.”
Cufflinks. He needed… there were loads in the little drawer to his left, so he pulled them out hastily and then looked over them, picking out the little arc reactors. They’d finish off the look nicely. And trousers—God, he’d almost fucking forgotten trousers. Dark navy, tight-fitted enough to give the board members something to squirm over. That’d be funny.
Tony made a whining noise in the back of his throat and grabbed Steve’s hand, pressing it back against his skin, despite Steve’s initial refusal. “Baby, come on- I’m fine. They’re just bruised. Please don’t be like that, it wasn’t your fault-”
Steve didn’t care enough to analyse Loki’s words, instead just snatching some of the bandages up and then tearing at the casing. “Thank you,” he said earnestly, turning around just as Thor enveloped his brother in a bear hug. Tony was frowning in discomfort, his good arm holding his bad while he lay flat on the couch. “Okay, I’m gonna close this cut on your cheek up for you now.”
“Okay, touché,” Tony rolled his eyes and then kicked back further into the couch, taking Steve with him until he was lying on top of Tony’s chest, “I’ll admit defeat on that one. I think, though, that for now we should just watch the TV and try and recuperate from that intense emotional conversation we just had. I can only take so many feelings before I require 49 hours of isolation –“
Strong hands pulled at his shoulders, but he held on. He had to hold on- that was all he knew. He had to hold on. If he let go, they’d die. Bucky and Tony and everyone he’d loved, all of them, gone, because he couldn’t catch them-
Tony thought vaguely, his head foggy and pained. His leg was on fire underneath him, like an inferno running through his mangled bone. Steve bent down and grabbed Tony by the collar, fist raising and aiming for his face. The hit was brutal- right in his eye, sending white spikes of nothingness through his vision as he reeled back. He was going to black out in a second, and then Steve would beat him to death, and that would be that. No more romantic evenings in, no more wedding ring in the bottom-left drawer of his workshop desk, nothing, zilch, nada. Over. Steve was going to kill him in the communal room of their home instead.
“No, Steve,” he said with a fast shake of his head, “no, no- Steve, don’t… s’not a… no. Don’t… that’s not how you’re s’posed to-“
He took a step forward, moving around the couch and keeping his jaw clenched tightly to stop from crying out with the sense of lingering distress. It was stupid, stupid stupid stupid, but he wanted to sob. The emotions that had been left behind were still there, with no outlet to conduct them to. What he ended up with was a frustrated sort of fear, caught between trying to tell himself to pull it together and simply bursting into tears.
He stirred, breathing in softly and feeling Tony’s hand trace a line from neck to abdomen, fingers stroking across the bumps of his muscle. Tony was pressed close already, his bare leg tangled up in Steve’s own, and when Steve shifted to roll onto his back, he made sure to pull Tony along with him so that he lay spread across Steve’s chest. He pushed his sleepy eyes open and watched Tony grin down at him. “Morning,” he muttered with a sly grin, dropping down to kiss Steve’s neck again.
Steve really didn’t know what to do with that information. He just couldn’t believe that he was even worth that much. At all. And yeah, Steve thought Ty was a shitty person, and that all of the rest of Tony’s friends were shitty people too- but he’d still known them for a long, long time. From what Thor told Steve, they’d pretty much all grown up together, running in the same social circles since the day they were all born. So for Tony to throw that all away for some skinny little orphaned kid that he’d met six months ago…
“Nuh uhhh, The Law of Best Friends says otherwise,” Bucky told him with a shrug, “we get a fresh threat with every base passed, that’s the rules.”
A minute later Tony came back and sat next to him, a safe distance away. He handed Steve his whiskey and then instantly threw back his own glass in one. When Steve raised an eyebrow at him, Tony just waved him off. “Oh, come on. My ex fiancé just showed up at my door saying the US government is trying to kill him. I deserve this.”
But Steve just smiled, his hand squeezing against Tony’s waist. He knocked their foreheads together, skin on skin, heartbeat to heartbeat.
“Okay, so we’ve got a lot to get through then,” the other man said as he flicked up one of the holographic screens in front of them both and then leaned back until he was shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve. He smelled like coconuts.
It was at the point where Sam was having to yank Clint’s ear in order to stop him from throwing a bag of chips at Natasha’s head when Steve felt Tony’s hand settle on the back of his neck, stroking softly. Of course, it invoked an involuntary shiver and smile, and when he turned his head to look at his boyfriend, Tony’s face was mirroring his own.
Sensing a tactical retreat may be best for this situation, he opened his mouth and began walking backward, ready to roll an excuse off his tongue and hurry back to his workshop.
Steve just followed the order, letting his head fall between his knees as he did so. He heard the thumps of Thor’s feet fade away after a few moments, and once more the panic surged right back again- Thor was the only kind person he’d met that night, he didn’t want him to go, then he’d be all on his own again-
Tony’s brief moment of panic passed slowly, and the wide eyes turned to rolling ones as he sighed and gave Steve a gentle shove. “Fuck, Rogers, I thought I’d just read the entirety of the last 24 hours completely wrong, don’t do that shit to me, I’m old, I’ve got a bad heart-“
Steve caught his eye and kept it for a second, opening his mouth and trying to find the appropriate thing to say- but words failed him. Tony didn’t seem to mind though; happy to just keep looking at Steve, lips slightly parted and eyes slightly wider than normal as he tilted his chin and stared unabashedly.
, obviously, he knew Steve would never hurt him. And anyway- Steve probably had a point. Tony should have been more careful, more considerate. Steve got worried easily, and Tony knew that, and he should have been... better, about all of it. Now Steve was upset. Upset enough to be looking at Tony like
Steve just grimaced and then pocketed his phone, looking back in the direction of the mansion and worrying at his lip. He sort of wished he’d stayed- upset as he was, Tony had still been the one who’d had some sort of major freakout over it, and Steve wanted to get to the bottom of it at the very least. Because he knew for a fact that Tony saying Steve’s wellbeing wasn’t important was complete bullshit; he might have self-worth issues, but even he could see that Tony gave more of a damn about him than he’d shown just then. It didn’t make sense, really.
Steve smiled tiredly and shuffled further up the bed. “Mornin’,” he mumbled, and Tony turned to him quickly, his own face smiling back.
And then, when the sound of annoyingly familiar voices drifted through the corridor, he thought about Tiberius Stone and his stupid group of dickhead friends.
He stumbled back a little, bouncing off Steve’s chest as he took two impossibly large strides forward, but ultimately stopped when Tony got in the way.
“M’okay,” Tony told him, trying to think back over the past few hours. They were hazy and dark, filled with faint memories of his own screams. He was glad that he couldn’t remember too well. “What’s HYDRA’s status?” He asked, shifting the subject as he attempted to sit up a little.
“The outer walls are lead-lined and it’s interfering with my sensors. Once you get further in, I might be able to pick something up.”
Steve’s eyes were shut, body limp. Tony’s hand went to his neck, feeling shakily for a pulse while he leaned down and hovered his cheek over Steve’s mouth. “Come on,” he whispered frantically, mind reeling from the whiplash of emotion- seconds ago, everything had been
Tony didn’t want Steve to look at the videos. Steve had a guilt complex to rival Tony’s on a good day, and no doubt as soon as Steve took one look at what AIM had been getting up to, it’d be a battle just to try and keep him from turning completely feral and going on a manhunt for everyone responsible. Tony wouldn’t exactly be opposed to that either- but he knew, objectively, that if they wanted to make AIM pay, they would have to do it in a way that stuck. Find enough information to raze that division to the ground and prevent them from even so much as thinking of trying again.
Clint looked solemnly toward Tony, shaking his head sadly as he watched the man stumble forward, brow set in confusion as he took in the setting around him.
He frowned, stepping forward warily. He couldn't hear what they were saying aside from vague murmurs, but he saw the boy nodding slightly frantically and Tony holding onto his skinny little forearm as he spoke. He bent down just a touch, eyes looking at the boy's face for a moment before nodding, obviously satisfied with whatever he saw. His hand rose and ruffled his hair. "Okay, get lost, kid-and you walk your ass home this evening, alright? Don't worry about him."
to you, shithead,” Steve said, and then grunted when Ty snapped out his hands and shoved him into the lockers, hard. His head hit the metal and he bit back on the urge to wince, continuing to keep eye contact with Ty. The crowd tightened, gasping in excitement at the fight that was seemingly about to break out on the corridors between Tony Stark’s current boyfriend and Tony Stark’s ex.
close. Then I had to go and—and fall for your bullshit without even questioning you, and now I’ve doomed the whole human race and let my god-damn ex fiancé sign my death warrant because I was
“I’ll head back to the lab,” Bruce said a little awkwardly, jerking a thumb behind him, and then Tony looked down in surprise as Natasha handed Peter over to him and began to follow Bruce.
It was obvious who Thor was talking about once Steve heard him say that, and he shut his eyes. “Loki,” he murmured.
Of course though, he couldn’t avoid his friends for long. At break, he came to sit down at their table and just sighed, meeting all their eyes with a pursed smile. “So,” he began, “Tony’s alright—”
Steve opened and shut his mouth a few times. “You sure?” He said quietly, “I don’t mind staying in the guest room for a few nights. I just… I just want you to feel safe.”
Steve realised he was talking about Rhodey and Natasha. He nodded his head. “They’re okay,” he said, “I’ll… what about Tony? What happened to him?”
“Fuck,” he breathed out, staring up at the ceiling. This was so stupid. He’d known all of this going in, come on, there was no need for him to act all shocked now. He wasn’t anything close to something Tony would want to keep around. And even though, for some absurd reason, Tony did anyway, that didn’t mean that suddenly Tony had to wreck his whole life in order to accommodate Steve into it. Steve didn’t expect that, and if he was in Tony’s position, he wouldn’t want to expose anyone else to someone of Steve’s caliber anyway. He didn’t fit in and he never fucking had-
“I’ll pretend I know what you just said,” Tony declared, taking another step forward until he was within touching distance of Steve. The man reached out a hand immediately, making a grabby motion with his fingers, and Tony laughed as he locked their hands together. The laugh quickly turned to a yelp, however, when Steve tugged him forward quickly, sending him tumbling over the couch and straight into Steve’s lap. “How much of this Asgardian shit did you give Captain America?” He called to the room as Steve’s happy face loomed over his.
