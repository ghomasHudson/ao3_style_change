“Morning, Cas. Got room for one more in there,” Dean says, eyebrow raised.
“How are the comics?” Cas asks.
“I still have a ways to go before I’m ready for the world to know, but I wanted to make sure that at least the people most important to you knew the truth.”
“Nah, just met him last week,” Dean tells her.
“All good, Cas, message received,” Dean says, starting to walk away.
“Always. Took out a vamp nest just the other day,” Claire winks. “Piece of cake.”
“Oh, you know what? Fuck off. The past few weeks haven’t exactly been easy for me,” Dean yells. “Okay? I-I-I, I get dumped by the guy that I could actually see myself spending the rest of my life with and then I’m supposed to just, just forget about all that? Just drop everything and, and go on tour? Are you fucking kidding me? Like, excuse the fuck outta me if I’ve been a piece of shit lately, but I’m just really not doing very-,” he stops himself.
“Uh, okay. Goodnight, Cas,” Dean says, still thoroughly confused by everything that just happened.
Dean sighs.
Sam and Eileen both laugh.
He rolls up to the studio around 1 in the afternoon. He nods in greeting at Rachel, the receptionist, and heads down the hallway to recording room 2. When he walks in, he sees Bobby sitting in one of the swivel chairs in front of the sound mixing board.
“Cause’ it’s the only bed I’ve got put up so far,” he says.
“Maybe it’s not that bad, maybe he’s just not into public displays of affection?” Gilda tries.
Claire punches him in the arm and then gives him a hug.
“Sam, you didn’t tell us your brother was so hot,” Jess teases.
“Whatever. So, you gonna tell me why you’ve been holed up in your house for the last couple of days? Isn’t your album coming out in a few weeks? Why aren’t you out promoting?”
Cas’ mouth waters, outside it smells even better. And, to Cas’ surprise, there’s a table set with glassware and candles.
You can leave me sittin’ right here
“Hey, man. I asked myself the same damn question,” Dean laughs. “Now, come on. I’m going downstairs. Meet me down there in half an hour.”
Cas smiles and they both head back into the hotel room. Dean is sound asleep on one bed and Jess is sitting up reading in the other.
The group decided to meet up for dinner at seven at a restaurant a few miles from their hotel. Dean and Cas end up being the last to arrive so the entire table stares at them, cracking jokes about why they’re late.
Dean has never been this nervous in his entire life. The feeling is a mixture of excitement as well as an obscene amount of fear.
Dean reluctantly glances over at Cas, unsure of how Cas will react to that, but he seems unphased.
Dean smiles. Castiel looks so unbelievably proud of himself that Dean even feels proud of him. Dean barely knows the guy, but he’s proud of his accomplishment.
“Been good, Sam. Real good. Looks like you’ve been good yourself,” Benny says as he nods his head towards Jess and winks. She laughs and Sam’s face turns bright red.
“So, I know Dean understands how hard it is to come to terms with yourself and be proud enough of who you are to come out to others. I just think that sometimes he forgets how long it takes. He’s been out since he was fifteen, you know, so I think it’s just one of those things where he lets his eagerness to show you off cloud that part of his brain that knows these things take time,” Sam finishes.
and June 11
That's why one of us can't understand
“Nah, just something I wrote the other night,” Dean responds.
It takes all of maybe 2 minutes in the car for Sam to start his interrogation. Dean clears his throat in preparation for the long conversation.
“You excited, Cas?” Sam asks.
“A date, huh?” she says, “do I know said date?”
“What brought this on? You haven’t had an episode like this since-,” Sam stops as it dawns on him that the last time Dean wouldn’t get out of bed for days on end was after his last breakup. “The pictures.”
“Wait, wait, wait. You went
Castiel manages a laugh, despite the fact that he’s still trying to catch his breath. He looks down at Dean where his head is nestled into Cas’ shoulder and he says,
“Hey man, thanks so much for doing this. I’ve never been good at this kind of thing.”
Dean takes a long swig of Bud Light and he’s startled by Benny putting his hand on the small of his back.
Dean has never bottomed, but the demanding tone in Cas’ voice is really turning him on right now, so he might consider it.
The pizza arrives about ten minutes into the movie, so they pause it to get plates and drinks.
“’m actually not looking for anythin’ tonight, ma’am, but thank you,” he says to her, his words slurred from the alcohol.
Dean rubs his forehead, only half understanding what the doctor just told them.
Dean blushes, the alcohol is really getting to his head. Lee begins a steady rhythm, up and down, up and down.
“Here, y’all can sit here,” Benny says as he slides out from the booth and walks over to snag a chair from another table.
“Awesome,” Dean laughs, “My little brother Sammy’s a lawyer. Pretty damn good one, too. Best in Nashville if I do say so myself.”
“Got a surprise for you tonight. Be ready by 7.”
“I just…wow,” Cas says, still in awe.
Both brothers are silent for a long time before Sam finally asks,
“I know there is. We’ve been through a lot together, man. Can’t just forget it ever happened,” Lee says.
“Moms are like that, huh?” Dean says.
“Yeah, no. That’s a song for another time, Cas,” Dean says, his face red with embarrassment.
You're not close enough so that space between
“’Friend’? Don’t you think we’re a little past that?”
I appreciate everyone's feedback and I'm so glad y'all are liking it so far! I hope y'all enjoy this next chapter too!
As soon as they get back up to the room, Cas slams Dean against the hotel door, connecting their lips. Dean reaches up and grabs a handful of Cas’ hair, dragging low moans out of Cas’ throat.
Dean pulls up at about a quarter to one to Cas sitting outside on a bench. Cas looks up and raises his eyebrows at the Impala. It occurs to Dean that he’s never actually shown Cas his baby before.
“Are you ready, Dean?” Cas asks, already sliding his fingers out of Dean’s ass to roll the condom on.
“I know this is difficult for you. Thank you,” Dean says.
“Dean,” he says.
He finishes the second song and the entire crowd erupts into cheers. He’s riding a high right now that he hasn’t felt since their last tour ended.
He rolls over in his empty bed to check his phone. No messages from Cas.
“Is Dean in the kitchen?” Sam asks.
“Yeah, man. It’s me,” Dean says back.
After he walks back inside, Benny hands him a plate as he sits down on the couch. It smells great. Dean hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he had food in front of him. They eat mostly in silence, Benny and Sam taking turns watching him out of the corners of their eyes. He does his best to ignore them, but it’s uncomfortable and awkward as hell.
“You’re sure you wanna do this, Dean?” Lee asks again.
“Dean, it’s all good. I kinda figured when I saw the state you were in last night,” he interrupts.
“I love you too, Cas. I’m in love with you. I have been for as long I can remember. I’m sorry I never said anything, I just didn’t think…I was afraid if I let myself…,” he can’t seem to find the right words to say. “I didn’t want it to be used against us, so I just tried to bury it. I’m sorry. I should’ve told you.”
“No shit, where about?”
“Oh, Dean, we didn’t, uh…we just slept,” he says.
“You know, I think this should be a regular thing,” Dean says as he shampoos his hair.
The three of them head towards the playroom in search of the kids. When they walk into the room, they’re met with all three children piled on top of Dean on the floor.
“Yes sir. I’m Dean, this is Sam,” Dean says in response. “Look, doc, we just wanna know what the hell’s going on.
“I’m good, Jody, really good. How’re you?” Dean asks her.
Dean tells the man he’ll see him in a bit before hanging up the phone and texting him the address.
“Cas, I’m not going anywhere until you talk to me.”
One hour until Dean and the guys go on stage to open for Luke. Cas, Sam, Jess, and the rest of the band’s guests showed up to watch the show. Dean catches a glimpse of Jess and Caroline chatting it up while Sam and Cas huddle together in the corner.
“Did something happen,” Dean scoffs, turning to look at them both. “Said ‘I can’t do this’ and that was that.” He rolls back over and pulls a pillow over his head.
“I’m fine, Dean,” Sam says, though obviously not fine.
He begins licking under the head of Cas’ cock before taking it in his mouth. He slides his mouth down until his lips hit the base of Cas’ dick. After bobbing his head a few times, he swallows around Cas, his throat tightening and sending chills up Cas’ spine.
Dean rolls his eyes and kisses Cas’ cheek as he passes by him towards the fridge.
“You know he is,” she winks at him. “And who’s this?” She asks, looking at Cas.
“What happened to your hand?” he asks again.
“So, I have a lot of movies of all different genres. I’m a bit of a movie buff,” Cas says.
“We just slept?” Dean repeats.
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
Right around noon, they’re startled by a loud crash outside the front door. Moments later, John Winchester storms into the house.
“Are you kidding me?” Chuck turns to Dean. “I knew you guys were stupid, but I didn’t think you were that stupid. Did you really expect that to work?”
Dean grins, leaning up to capture Cas’ mouth for a few kisses.
“Cas, I just got home. Can you come over? So we can talk?”
“Dad…,” Cas says.
“He knew, Dean. He knew.”
They all laugh and continue a conversation as normal. Jess seems to really be enjoying herself, even in Dean’s company. In fact, her whole demeanor around Dean began to shift after Christmas. He knows it probably has something to do with her witnessing first-hand what John and Dean’s relationship is like, but as long as they’re getting along, it’s fine with him. He knows it’s important to Sam, so he's making an effort.
“Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!” Dean yells grabbing a fist full of sheets on either side of him.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas still doesn’t reply right away. Dean locks his phone and gets up to take a shower. When he gets out, he has Cas’ response.
Dean breaks away for a second to pull his shirt off over his head. Lee does the same and then they’re connected once again, stumbling their way over to the bed.
“Just leave it alone, Sam. He’s said from the beginning that it had to stay between us. The fact that he told everybody last weekend was a huge step but he wasn’t even close to being ready for the world to know. And I fucked it up. I just had to take him on a date that wasn’t behind closed doors. This is my fault.”
“Hi, Cas. It’s great to meet you,” Sam says and Jess nods in agreement.
The look of pure shock on Dean’s face is one Cas catches immediately but doesn’t acknowledge right away. Everyone at the table begins to clap for them, talking over one another about how they’d all figured it out for the most part. The only person who was genuinely unaware of Dean and Cas’ relationship was Andrea, which was to be expected.
They move to the bed, nearly falling over due to Dean’s current lack of coordination.
“As you know, I’ve only ever been with women,” Cas says.
Cas pulls into Dean’s driveway about 20 minutes later. Dean invites him inside and he pulls him into a tight hug, to which, much to Dean’s surprise, Cas returns.
He must’ve dozed off at some point during the Dr. Sexy marathon he was watching because the next thing he knows, it’s almost seven in the morning.
Cas looks at Dean in confusion as he’s talking before it sets in what Dean had in mind.
“It’s Christmas, Sammy. That calls for a nice breakfast,” Dean says back.
“Yeah! Or, or maybe he didn’t notice you leaning over to kiss him. Maybe he was just getting out of the car,” Charlie suggests.
“I’m just…Cas said it would be a while before the empty would come and take him. I wasn’t expecting it to happen so soon,” Jack lowers his head.
Suddenly, the door to the bar swings open and a loud “woohoo” can be heard over the music.
Bobby knocks on Dean’s room door about half an hour later. He lets him in, but he doesn’t speak.
Dean hears the news Wednesday morning that his album is already breaking records.
“Who’s that?” Dean asks Jo.
Dean sighs and dials the number for a cab.
“He’s real good at first impressions, huh?”
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean says back, kissing him again.
Dean steps away from the mic, turns around, and cups his hands over his mouth. The crowd cheers and applauds as he stands there for a moment before walking backstage. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees doing his best not to break down right there. Performing this song was a mistake, he wasn’t ready for his fans to hear how pathetic he is over this break up.
“I gotta go, Cas, it’s almost 10:30. I got an early morning.”
“Castiel,” Bart says again, shutting Cas up quickly. “It’s okay.” He says.
“Thanks. I thought it was pretty good m’self,” Dean smiles back.
Dean sends a quick text to Sam, anxiously awaiting the reply.
“’Bout the show,” Dean responds.
Cas finally pulls away and his face is beet red, “We should probably pick a movie before getting into that,” he says, shyly.
Tears start falling down Dean’s cheeks again. He wipes at them, but it doesn’t do much.
“I will. Have fun tonight, and consider adding a vegetable to your steak dinner?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Bobby smiles briefly before schooling his expression back to his Serious Manager Face. “That it? You’re battin’ almost .400, of course they cheered for you. Now, Doc, tell me more about Rami’s finger.”
“Sorry,” Jenkins says, looking embarrassed.
“Look, the past month has been incredibly difficult in a lot of ways, but it’s also been just flat-out
This combination of nearly unbearable intimacy coupled with the words Cas is saying drives Dean wild. He had absolutely no idea that anal sex would be like this; the sensation of being filled and fucked into the mattress is so incredibly satisfying.
Cas beams at him. “Thank you, Dean.”
not a lack of desire on his part. Dean has thought about getting Cas under him (above him, behind him, next to him, any way he can get him) almost constantly since he let himself admit that he wanted to date the guy. But since they’ve started this dating/relationship/Thing, they haven’t done anything more than makeout with some pretty intense dry humping before Dean will pause (
“I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I strongly object to sticking to whatever fluids and germs are residing on this bedspread.”
Dean feels like his heart is going to beat out his chest (he spares a split second to hate Benny for forcing him to watch You’ve Got Mail so many times that he thinks shit like, “my heart feels like it’s going to beat out of my chest”).  He cups Cas’ jaw and tilts his head up so that he can press a kiss to his lips.
he thinks. It doesn’t feel untrue, but it doesn’t really feel totally right, either. He just feels sort of Cas-sexual, right now.
“Cas,” Dean whines. “Tempeh? The stuff you’ve been growing yourself that smells like socks? Come on, you sadist! It’s a steak steak kind of day.”
Dean frowns and tries to take stock of his body. “Uh, my head. It feels like I have a pounding headache.” He takes a deep breath in and out and doesn’t cough this time. “But I can breathe normally.”
“Look, Dean. If I were to engage in a romantic relationship with you, my

“You’re playing a dangerous game, Dean,” she warns.
“Fine. We can talk to Bobby, if it’ll make you feel better. And if we decide to keep doing this,” he waves a hand between the two of them, “then we’ll talk to Jo and Gabriel”—Cas grimaces—“and whoever else we need to, to make sure we’re being as, uh, ethical, as possible.”
than to worry about the perceived ‘stages’ of a relationship.”
“I mean, I don’t have anything more to say.”
Cas puts his hand over Dean’s and twines their fingers together. “I don’t need us to be on the cover of
“Wait, he’s moving in?!” Sam asks excitedly, grinning.
“Yeah man. I’d rather pitch both games of a doubleheader in July than sit through another day of meetings.”
@gaysball (6/11/20 9:43 am): THIS IS NOT A DRILL PEOPLE! @TheRealDWinny IS ONE OF US! I’ve been waiting my whole gay life for this amazing gay news. Thank you for your courage, Dean! WE LOVE YOU!
“No! No,” Sam puts his hands up, trying to halt Dean’s words. “I’m just trying to explain why I didn’t want to give up on Ruby right when you told me to.” Sam rubs at his forehead. “When it was just the two of us, it was like I was the most important thing in the world to her. And it was, I dunno...intoxicating? I thought that since you’d never seen that side of her, you couldn’t really know her.”
The next set of tweets are prefaced with a note from Charlie:  “there are a shit-ton of these, so I just chose a few. How this came about blows chunks, but you’re inspo for so many kiddos :-) “
“I know how to pick ‘em!” Dean says around a mouthful of pie, a few crumbs spraying out onto the table.

Dean groans. “I friggin’ hate writing. Especially about myself.”
“What’s with the silence, dudes?” Ash’s voice rings out from the clubhouse entrance, breaking the quiet. Dean turns his head to see Ash looking around in confusion before shaking the rain from his mullet.  Droplets fly off of him like a dog after a bath. As the silence continues, the grin slides off his face. “Fuck, did someone die?”
Dean flinches. “Please don’t. They’re all burned into my memory. Especially the one with the

Cas stops putting the resistance bands they were working with away and turns back to Dean, one eyebrow raised.
wanted to go to prom with Chris Masters so badly that I ended up skipping the damn thing altogether because I couldn’t bring myself to ask him. It’s just a hilarious joke I like to play on myself, when I squash down the desire to grab you and kiss you every time you look at me like you’re seeing my entire being and you actually like what’s there.”
He raises his eyes to meet Cas’, and is treated to a full-on soul-penetrating gaze. Dean clears his throat. “Yeah?”
“I found this group attempting to break and enter,” Sam says.
Cas laughs. “It’s fine Dean, we’ll clean it up later. Keep your head in the game.”
“Boys, boys,” Benny interrupts, setting Caleb on his shoulders. He looks delighted with this development and proceeds to start drumming on his father’s head and babbling nonsense. “As entertaining as it is to watch you two quarrel, there’s a serious issue at hand: this man is in love. I agree with Sam, Winny. I think you should tell him. I may not know him as well as you do, but Castiel isn’t the type of guy to make you regret telling him something like that.”
This part is familiar—and friggin’
“I can’t ignore the violation of my oath in favor of superstition.”
Dean blushes and shifts on his bed, struggling to contain his discomfort with the depth of Cas’ words. “OK, OK, I get it, Dr Ruth. We love the shit out of each other. So does that mean you’ll put it in my butt?”
“No way, dude! I’m not finished yet. I can get Chapman to hit into a double play.“
“Damn. Old money on that side, huh? I mean, obviously your dad is worth a ton… that’s common knowledge. But just how loaded are you?”
“Well said, Dean. Congratulations again, and enjoy the weekend. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us.”
Dean smiles and ends the call, making contended noises as he burrows into his bed. Yeah, he’s still uncomfortable expressing all this emotional shit to another human. But it’s worth it when the outcome is Cas smiling at him like he’s the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe.
.” Dean says her name like it tastes bad.
“Looking for buried treasure?” Dean asks after it’s been a few moments and Cas is still balanced over him, rooting around in the drawer.
While Bobby, Sam, and Ellen step into the house to retrieve cold beers from the fridge, Jo introduces herself.
“Cas,” he clears his throat, trying to steady his wobbly voice. “I love you.”
“Thanks,” Dean says to the EMT that’s taking his vitals. He rolls his eyes to the side to the best of his ability, trying to see the guy while his neck is immobilized in a brace. His head still aches and his chest hurts a bit where Rocker slammed into him with his shoulder, but his neck feels fine. He keeps telling himself that he’s just putting up with all of this for Cas’ sake—that he’ll get his noggin checked out and there’ll be nothing wrong and he’ll be cleared to play tomorrow—and resolutely doesn’t let any other scenario play out in his thoughts.
Cas is watching the at-bat so intently that he misses the exchange. After the next pitch is fouled away, he suddenly sits up and says, “Dean, Sam, we need to move down the bench.”
Dean grins, enjoying how well Cas knows him.
Cas looks surprised but gratified at Dean’s vehemence. “I love you, too,” he says simply.
He finishes getting dressed and checks his phone again before he leaves the clubhouse.
(Sam calls Dean’s refusal to address difficult emotions “avoidance” and “super-unhealthy,” but Sam is a little shit who spends fifty bucks on a bottle of shampoo, so what does he know?)
Rocker smirks and Dean wants to punch his stupid fucking face in.
“So far, it’s a lot of talking heads giving sound bites about how important it is to have queer athletes who are willing to be open about their sexuality. A lot of people are really excited about what this could mean for baseball and sports and, you know, the whole ‘pervasive culture of toxic masculinity’ thing.”
It’s only the fourth inning of Sunday’s game, but Sam’s already given up three runs, four walks, and has a pitch count in the 80’s. If he’d just been having an off day—a shitty start, brought on by any number of mundane reasons—then Dean would be readying a pep-talk, something encouraging to remind Sam of his abilities and how to go about getting out of the inning. Dean is well-practiced in the art of coaxing the best out of his brother’s starts. But today isn’t like that. Sam hasn’t shaken off a single pitch today; he’s been jittery and unfocused and Dean’s patience had flown the coop two walks ago. He knows that Sam is letting their outside issues leak into today’s game and cause this performance, and it’s
Caleb takes the object out of his mouth and looks at it, then back at Sam.
Cas nuzzles his cheek against Dean’s jawline, reminding him of a giant, adorable cat.
The Angels hold a 4-2 lead in the seventh inning, but Dean thinks that Ash is losing steam. With one out and a man on second, he gets Mayers and Middleton up and throwing in the pen, and visits the pitching mound. He gives Ash his usual pep talk—mostly lines adapted from Bill Pullman’s speech in
“Right. Of course.”
“And salad.”
“Yeah, well, you know I don’t like being all mushy and crap, but it’s gotta be said.”
[.gif: Dean and Cas sitting next to each other in the dugout, Cas pointing to something on the field while Dean smiles and nods.]
“I don’t. I swear I don’t think that of you.” Dean runs his fingers through his hair, trying to wrangle his thoughts and figure out how to vocalize his emotions. “But, ok, so you know how Sam always wears those stirrup socks when he pitches? And how I always count the beads on my mom’s crucifix before every game? It’s like that. Like some superstitious shit.”
“So, Dr Fernandez left me some notes on your previous injuries before she retired,” Castiel says, shifting a few pages around and examining the MRI results that Dean recognizes as the ones taken of his shoulder last September. “Why don’t you give me an update on your shoulder? Have you been doing any PT, or seeing a doctor in the off season?” He clicks a pen and holds the ballpoint poised over a notepad, looking at Dean expectantly.
For the rest of the week, Castiel has Dean meet with him in the training rooms after practice. Because pitchers and catchers report to spring training a few weeks earlier than the rest of the players, they’re able to work in relative privacy. Dean opens up a bit more about where he’s hurting and what type of pain he’s in, and Castiel keeps his word about limiting his treatment plan to include just the two of them.
“Pleasure to meet you, doc. Dean won’t shut up about you, you know? You’ve got quite the reputation to live up to.” Benny holds his large hand out, waiting for Cas to take it.
“In what universe is this a favor?!”
“I had a poster of Leonardo DiCaprio hidden in my room after I saw "Titanic" in theatres,” he says, a bit breathlessly.
Cas rolls his eyes but smiles. “I’m all sweaty. Let me take a shower first.”
. And I was really tired. And you were being an ass...butt.”
Dean wonders if this is what being in a real relationship is like, if it’s just a constant back and forth between fear and elation that eventually morphs into acceptance.
“Whatever, man. All I’m saying is, you could’ve had literally any car in the world, and you picked this one.”
To Bobby, The Notorious JBH, MaEllen, Benny (9:35 am): thanks. cas says you can keep texting him if you want but i’ll update you when i can. and we’re good w/pie for now but can i reserve the right to change my mind?
Dean coughs and tears his eyes away from Cas. He leans more heavily onto the railing that separates the dugout from the field and rests his chin on his hands. He tries to rein in his emotions in order to focus on the game, but his thoughts keep shifting back to their relationship.
Sam, you assclown) to the stock of paper goods Dean kept in the garage (he knows that come the apocalypse, the first thing to go is toilet paper. Always, always have a backup stash).
Cas stops what he’s doing and stares at Dean. “Do you think it would be so terrible? That they’d accuse you of being a sex addict or something?”
“French fries are potatoes.”
“Dude, it’ll open up your hips so much,” Sam enthuses, “think about how much more flexible you’ll be! I’m sure Cas agrees with me.”
Dean rolls his eyes and starts to stand up. “I have an episode of

He’d be embarrassed at how quickly he came if he were able to form said coherent thoughts, but as it stands, Dean’s slumped against the couch with his jeans and boxers scrunched around his ankles and his head full of a pleasant nothingness.
Charlie takes off her headphones when she sees Cas and Dean re enter the kitchen. “What’s the verdict, kiddos?”
“Ugh!” Dean flops onto his bed and rubs his hands over his face. “I just don’t want him to get hurt. And this chick has ‘heartbreak’ written all over her.”
, her head barely coming up to his chest). Dean sees how happy his brother looks, so tries to tamp down the urge to ask her just what the fuck she’s doing here.

He quickly shampoos his hair, willing the fantasies away. And that’s the main problem, isn’t it? This is all a
For the rest of the season.
“Damn your friggin’ silent magnet car!” Dean grumbles as he gets in the Tesla. “You make more money than God and this is the shit you choose to drive?”
Finding the large room used for treating the players empty, Dean walks over to the giant ice machine and begins to fill a plastic bag to tape over his shoulder.
“Yeah, but it’s not quality time, you know?” Sam scoots so his back is against the wall, his outrageously long legs stretched out in front of him. “So, anything new you want to fill me in on?”
Cas kisses him soundly.
“Yes, so you’ve assured me.”
Cas puts his hand on the back of Dean’s neck and squeezes gently. “I’m sure your calves look strong and muscular in whatever socks you wear.”
“He’s just showing off that he’s dating a doctor,” Benny interjects. “Hey, Caleb! Come say hi, bud!”
“Up to you. But I promise I won’t go anywhere if you want to answer.”
“It’s only painful to see you holding yourself back, dude. Come on. I can take it.” Dean wants to see Cas come undone,  take control, and own him in a way that he’s caught glimpses of but hasn’t fully experienced. He clenches his muscles around Cas’ dick, a challenge in his eye.
“Dean?” Cas turns on his side, holding the phone so that Dean feels like he’s laying on the pillow next to him.
“It’s great having Sammy around, honest,” Dean smiles. “The guys started calling him ‘Winny the Two,’ and he

“Of course.”
“Exactly,” Dean sighs.
different and he
“I’m quite pleased with how that turned out. I guess I’ll call Gabriel tonight while you’re out with the team.” Cas grabs Dean’s hand and squeezes.
Sam wraps his brother up in a hug. “
“Pumpkin is a goddamn vegetable!” Dean shouts, pointing a finger at the camera. “How am I wrong?!”
“Of course you did, Rain Man.” Dean takes a big drink of Gatorade, and Cas wrinkles his nose.
Cas shakes his head and his messy hair scrapes against the pillow loudly. “I’ve been told I need to ‘loosen up’ my entire life. I think you’re a fantastic influence on me.”
“On to the next thing: the team put out their statement supporting you and your right to privacy,” Charlie turns her computer so the screen is facing Dean and Cas. It shows the same brief, carefully-worded paragraph that Gabriel had shared with them earlier, that was now featured on the Angels’ website. Turning the screen back towards herself, Charlie continues, “and since you’ve confirmed the story, now you’re going to need to decide if you want to do any interviews. You’ve already gotten tons of requests, so you can pretty much choose who you want to talk to, if you want to. Bela thinks you should do it because it’ll be ‘good for the Dean Winchester brand,’ but then again, she’s never been outed by an evil corporation run by orcs, so it’s completely up to you.” She shrugs.
“I am, honest. I really am.”
“It’s been like, six hours since his girlfriend tried to ruin my life. I think I get to be angry for a while longer without people making me feel guilty about it. Jesus.”
They’re both quiet for a few moments. “I guess the question becomes, then, whether or not you want this to be something we try. Something we figure out together,” Cas says.
“Well, you know, we spent a lot of time in shitty motels with my dad,” Dean explains, watching with interest as Cas peels off his sweaty shirt and shorts. “Wait,” he says after a moment, realizing what Cas just said. “How did you know it was Casa Erotica?”
Dean groans and puts his head in his hands. “DiCaprio,” he corrects quitely.
Garcia’s curve ends up lower than Dean was expecting and Voit makes contact on a check swing, the ball dribbling right in front of the plate. It takes an odd bounce, but Dean hears the ump call the ball fair as he leaps up from his squat. He squares his shoulders and is about to throw to first for the easy out when he sees Rocker charging at him, instead of heading towards home plate. He barely has time to think
RT@OKFine22 6/07/20 11:44 pm: is it just me, or do @TheRealDWinny + the hot sports med doc seem to be in love? This is 100% my aesthetic just saying.
“We’ve never talked about this before, so I have no historical evidence to support the assumption that this sort of scenario might cause you anxiety.”
Cas’ face lights up when he sees Dean. “Hello, Dean,” he responds happily. “Do you know Ken? His career overlapped with my father’s quite a bit.”
,” he lowers his voice to a whisper.
“Dean? You OK?” Sam answers after one ring.
“Dude, yes! Hit me with that quality cat content.”
“OK, Mr. Winchester! I got the note about you wanting to have a room with an east-facing window. You’re all set.”
Dean looks at Cas, surprised to hear his own thoughts given voice.
From Samsquatch (8:53 pm):
Dean waves his hand dismissively. “I’m fine. The doctor was just about to say the same, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Comfortably ensconced in fluff, Dean scrolls through Twitter, trying to find some good photos of fans holding pride-themed signs from the weekend’s series to re-tweet. He wants to make sure to show his followers that, despite his silence to reporters, their public support means a lot to him. One of the most difficult parts of this whole debacle has been fighting to get his own voice out there—to advocate for himself while maintaining some semblance of privacy. He doesn’t want to reward the media for digging into his life with the subtlety of a chainsaw, but he doesn’t want to appear to be some ungrateful ass and/or a meek idiot who won’t stand up for himself. After he chooses some posts to RT, he adds a personal message:
Sam nods and lets his head fall back against the wall of the dugout, closing his eyes. Dean moves away from him, giving him space to (hopefully) clear his mind and refocus.
“You’re lucky you’re cute, Winchester.”
His brother seems calm and collected tonight despite the national spotlight on the game, which helps to settle Dean’s mood. He doesn’t want Cas to be upset with him—he figures that the reminder of their quiet relationship status is what caused Cas’ pensive reaction—and he’s not sure what to do about it. He’s been toying with the idea of coming out more often, lately, particularly since the pressure of having to remember not to talk about his happiness to other people has been weighing on him.
___________
Sam rolls his eyes and stomps over. “Jesus, Dean. What?”
, he’s been jerking off so much he’s a little afraid his dick is gonna fall off. He feels like he did when he was 14 and discovered lube.
There are a few seconds of silence, and then Dean feels his phone buzz with an incoming text.
“Ok, ok. But you know you can always talk to me about anything.”
Dean feels like something breaks inside him. “How could you think I’m not happy? We are
Dean nods, blushing at Cas’ comment. “See you at 3.”
to give him that, but also that he
Dean takes his time working Cas open. He loves watching him react, watching the flush spread from his neck and down onto his chest as he gets more and more worked up from Dean’s touch.
Is your knee OK? Last time I asked you nearly ripped my head off, but I gotta know you’re healthy.”
“That’s completely fair. But I’d bet that 90% of the journalists you interact with wouldn’t touch that sort of salacious gossip with a ten-foot pole.”
“Not really. I tried to give Ash the signal for a cutter a few times. And that was after the two passed balls the inning before. He could tell I wasn’t all there, and he knows how to get me to pay attention.”
Cas holds a straight face for a few seconds before he bursts into laughter. “I’m kidding, Dean. I wouldn’t subject you to a new food on a night like this. We can order whatever you want for dinner.”
“Huh?” Sam asks, his hand in a bag of sunflower seeds.
“No. You?”
Cas sighs. “You have to admit your car is a gas guzzler, Dean.”
The Angels don’t score in the top of the seventh inning and they reach the hospital before the Yankees get to bat. Dean’s wheeled in through a quiet entrance on the side of the building, and he’s immediately taken to an examination room where a kind-faced woman wearing blue scrubs under a white coat greets them.
While Cas starts to rebuild his destroyed block-city, Caleb plants himself in Dean’s lap to watch. He’s wearing little denim overalls and he has a streak of dirt on his cheek; he looks like a tiny, adorable farmer. Dean puts his arms on either side of Caleb and lets the kid use him as a chair, pleasantly surprised that Caleb’s warmed up to him so quickly.
Yesterday, for example, Dean had been laid out on an examination table with his right knee folded up and onto his chest while Cas used his body weight to press Dean further into the stretch. The feel of the doctor’s hand gently cupping his ankle, coupled with the view of him looming over Dean, had made him feel lightheaded and more than a little turned on. And then Cas had let out a small grunt before adjusting their position and Dean had to squeeze his eyes shut, going through the 2019 Angels lineup backwards to get his mind on anything other than the tantalizing vision of Cas panting over him.
“Why don’t you ask your parents about Dean’s level of brain damage?” Cas asks casually, helping himself to a large spoonful of fruit.
“Good! I’ve been rather obsessive about getting this recipe just right for you. Take a seat,” he says. “Can I get you a glass for your beer?”
Dean considers this before replying. “I dunno, Cas. Of course I’m upset that he said all that shit. But maybe I’ve prepared myself enough for this inevitable disappointment? I’ve heard him say a lot of the same stuff about other people, so it’s not out of left field.” He licks his lips and lets his head fall back against the back of the seat. “Maybe I’m in shock or something. I’m sad that he feels that way, you know? That hurts. Of course it does! But I was sitting there in Baby, driving to come catch up with the team after finishing a photoshoot with friggin’ Nike, about to leave on a road trip because I play
“I never knew you were such a nerd, Dean.”
“Fine. I’ll keep searching for something to call you,” he calls from the bedroom, where he’s tossing things into his suitcase.
The deep tone of Cas’ gravelly voice causes Dean’s dick to throb and he’s in such a hurry to get a condom that he knocks most of the items, including an open bottle of lube, off the nightstand onto the ground.
Cas pulls the EMT’s attention away, conferring with him about medical shit and Dean tunes them out, listening to the radio commentators. Rocker was immediately thrown out of the game for his actions, the home plate umpire citing the “egregious use of unnecessary force” and the Buster Posey Rule, which prohibits base runners from intentionally initiating contact with the catcher. Both the play-by-play and color commentator are incredibly upset about Rocker’s actions and lay into him for breaking the rules, setting a terrible example, and being a poor sportsman.
Dean squeezes Cas’ knee. “You know what might help? Charlie sent me an email with some tweets that she said I should look at if I needed a pick-me-up.”
“Dude,” Sam says in exasperation. “Where have you been the past few days?”
Dean is in a
. Because in real life, things are never that perfect. Reality is cruel and unrelenting and relationships end and people leave. And Dean has responsibilities; he has to face the fact that being with a guy would require them to either live in secret, at least until he retires, or to drop a bomb on the world of sports and hope to God he still has a career once the smoke clears.
Dean keeps his favorite parts to himself, though. There are some memories of that night that are just for him: the tearful thanks that Sam whispered to him for being the dad their actual father never was, the proud grin on Bobby’s face when he shook Dean’s hand before pulling him into a tight hug, and the force of Jo and Ellen slamming into Dean after they sidestepped a security guard and ran onto the field.
He has 57 missed calls, 41 voicemails, 129 text messages, and 246 new emails. As he’s looking at the screen, he gets an incoming call from Sam, which he ignores. A surge of anger flows through him. Of course it was fucking Ruby that outed him! Dean knew not to trust her, and yet here he is, getting completely fucked over because his idiot brother wouldn’t listen to him.
“Of course. My mistake.”
inherit a butt-ton of money. That I will add to my own butt-ton of money.”
For tonight, though, Dean just wants to enjoy being with his family and friends to celebrate his brother’s accomplishment. Again, he promises himself that he and Cas will address the issue soon and shifts into host-mode.
“What’s Castiel the angel of, again?”
“I can see why she makes you uneasy,” Cas says quietly once they hear the bathroom door click shut.
we make it to the Series,” Dean grumbles, putting his head in his hands.
Yesterday, for example, Ash was in the clubhouse extolling the joys of being single and looked to Dean for support. He’d opened his mouth to correct Ash before it hit him that, by his own rule, he couldn't share his “taken” status with his teammates. So he’d given a half-hearted chuckle and pointedly ignored the sad look Sam was sending his way.
Dean’s name is met with screams and cheers, and he grins widely, taking his cap off briefly and tipping it to the crowd. He sees Jo and Ellen in the family section, jumping up and down and clapping for him, and he waves.
“What’s with the toilet paper? Aren’t you usually in the process of removing it from my house, not bringing it in?” Dean asks, getting to his feet and wiping his oily hands with a rag.
Cas raises an eyebrow at Dean. “Was our session overly taxing?”
“Yes?” he asks, not looking at his brother. Even the sound of Sam’s voice is infuriating, at this point.
“Huh?”
“So it’s just you and me. No expectations.” Cas cards his fingers gently through Dean’s hair and Dean sighs, his body relaxing slightly.
Dean goes back to the dugout to grab his mask, which he finds waiting for him in Cas’ outstretched hand. “Good luck today,” he says, his face impassive but his eyes boring into Dean’s, emparting heartfelt emotion.
“Yeah, sure thing, doc. I’m all yours. But can you do me a solid and turn on the game?” He gestures to the TV mounted on the wall.
“I might’ve…” he replies casually.
When he almost misses a hard toss from Sam, Dean decides he needs a minute to gather his thoughts and calls for Milligan to take over the warmup. His brother furrows his brow in worry, but Dean shakes him off, claiming he needs to pee before the pregame starts in earnest.
Dean frowns. “
Cas laughs. “God help me, I do. Come on, let’s get back to lauding Sam.” Cas holds out his hand, and Dean takes it, letting himself be led back out to the party.
“His fourth,” Cas gushes, beaming. “And this year, he secured more votes than any other player in history.”
Bellinger strikes out looking.
Dean takes a deep breath. He knew this was coming—that there would be some question about his sexuality and/or his relationship with Cas—but he hadn’t really prepared any specific response beyond his usual, “I have no comment about my personal life.” But as he’s standing there, having been selected by a record number of votes to his fourth-consecutive All Star Game and openly accompanied by the man he loves, he decides to respond with a bit more openness than he generally grants the media.
He opens the door quickly and is met with a smirking Cas behind it.
But it was a big ask, Dean knew, in the wake of their incredibly public coming out. They would be opening themselves up for more media coverage just by virtue of appearing together at the event, and Dean is still nervous that one of these days Cas is going to “thanks but no thanks” his way out of Dean’s life.
“Don’t tell anyone, but our father had him thrown in a cage.” Castiel doesn’t crack a smile.
Cas gasps out a scandalized, “Dean!” and Dean winces, rubbing the back of his neck. “I apologized for that like, at least fifteen times. And I bought you a pie!”
Then he starts grinning like an idiot. “Dude. This is awesome. I can’t believe you love me back.”
“Should you agree to be honest with me about where your injuries lie and what sort of pain you’re experiencing, we’d create a plan of attack to address your various needs in an effort to get you back to your healthiest. I can’t promise not to recommend that you take time off to heal, but as your physician you have my word that I will be completely open with you about all your options.”
“Just Winny’s reputation,” Walker says from his cubby. The Angels’ second baseman is usually a man of few words, but apparently today is an exception. He and Dean have never gotten along all that well; Walker's attitude is more conducive to a battlefield than to a team sport.
“Move it along, boys!” The home plate umpire calls, walking towards them.
“So, what, uh, did you need? It seemed like we left things perfectly clear,” Dean asks, glancing nervously at where his brother is standing by the stove.
Dean rolls his eyes and takes a giant gulp of coffee, fondness for his brother welling up within him. Sam’s an infuriating ass, but he really is Dean’s proudest accomplishment. Dean doesn’t have many happy memories of his early childhood. Their dad, John, had mentally checked out of parenting after their mom died in a house fire when Sam was an infant, unable to get past the grief that consumed him. He wasn’t a bad guy, per se, but he didn’t know how to prioritize his sons when faced with single parenting. He’d take months-long construction jobs, moving his young kids around the country with him.
“Down, girl.”
“Baby?” Cas asks suddenly.
Charlie smiles. “Aww, that’s so sweet! And yeah, duh, I know you have a brother. He’s the one who was dating the chick who sold your love story to Crowley Media. And she sold it for way less than it was worth, by the way.”
“Hey! Did you see?” he asks excitedly, taking the open door as an invitation to interrupt.
“Of course, sir.”
His brother shrugs.
“Coming out to Ellen and Jo?”
Plus, unlike his teammates, Dean doesn’t have to say goodbye to his significant other for the duration of the trip. He and Cas don’t really spend much time together at work—Cas is busy with his whole “being the team doctor” thing, and Dean is busy with his whole “playing baseball” thing—but they’ve developed a nice routine of dinners together when there’s a day game and falling exhaustedly into bed at one of their houses after a night game.
“Oh, shut up, jerk,” Sam steps back and runs a hand through his hair. “Thank you for doing this for me. It really means a lot.”
From: Cas (11:32 am): I love you, too.
had your best interests at heart, and I’ve never given you
“Yes,” Dean says stiffly. “Castiel Shurley.”
Suddenly Dean catches sight of a familiar mess of dark hair through the window of the training room, and he realizes exactly what he needs to get his head on straight.
Work, sashay shantay
“Hi-ya, gorgeous,” he says, smiling dopily.
“If you weren’t six feet tall and in need of a shave, I’d swear you were the same bratty eleven year old who couldn’t stop messin’ with his little brother,” she shakes her head in exasperation. “Now come give me a hug.”
“And you did an amazing job parenting him, Dean,” Cas continues. “You raised him to be so much like you: independent, resourceful, and smart. Maybe Sam had to go through this experience to learn from it.”
Cas puts his book on his chest and squints up at Dean. “Please do.”
Dean scoffs and crosses his arms across his chest again. “Dude, that’s not what I’m trying to get at here. I’m not asking for some robotic, unerringly obedient brother. I’m asking for you to take your unnaturally large head out of your ass and tamp down your goddamn ego. To stop acting like a child when you don’t get your way. To understand that your actions have fucking consequences.”
It didn’t hurt that Sam’s own growth spurt had him clocking in at over six feet when he was a freshman, joining the high school team for Dean’s senior year. That season the Winchester brothers earned nationwide attention for their talent: Sam for his stoic, commanding presence on the mound and Dean for his ability both behind and at the plate. According to the press, theirs was a feel-good story, perfect for sandwiching in between the macabre reports of war, crime, and politics. In the evening news, they were just two handsome American brothers turning to baseball to overcome their broken home. Dean would tell anyone who asked that he and Sammy had grown up just fine, thanks, nothing broken about them (his interviews were usually cut out of the final broadcasts).
“Oh!” Sam steps back from the door with his eyebrows raised. “Oh!” he says again. He gestures to Dean, “That’s why with the...no shirt…”
Dean freezes when he hears Sam swear behind him and breaks the kiss. He doesn’t bother to turn around, instead he lets his forehead drop onto Cas’ shoulder. “Son of a bitch,” he mutters.
Cas looks up and smiles warmly. “For you? I have several.” The room is otherwise empty, and Cas beckons Dean in with a nod of his head, his expression morphing into one of concern when he takes in Dean’s body language. “What’s going on? Are you hurt? Is it your head?”
A week later, the Angels are about to leave for their first road trip, opening with a series in Texas against the Rangers before they go to Seattle, then finish with a weekend in Oakland. They’ll be away from Anaheim for almost two weeks, and most of the guys are less than enthusiastic about the long stretches in hotels. Dean doesn’t mind; he and Sam spent so much of their childhoods shuffling from place to place that it doesn’t really faze him to live out of a suitcase. Especially not the way the team travels, with private planes and four-star hotels.
“Dude! You were, like, in love with Benny when you guys were in the minors. And the way you talked about Leonardo DiCaprio and Ken Griffey, Jr. when we were kids? Oh god, remember how obsessed you were with Nomar Garciaparra?”
So for now, Dean closes the door on his relationship shit and forces his mind to think about the fact that the heart of the Dodger batting order is due up at the top of the ninth.
“Yeah, I know. But it wasn’t the same without you at home.” Sam shrugs.
“There you go again, equating having emotions with femininity.”
“Do you want to discuss what’s got you so distracted?” Cas takes a step forward and puts his hand out to touch Dean, but apparently thinks better of it and lets his arm drop. “I understand if you don’t, but I’m here to listen to anything you want to share with me.”
“What is the positive coverage like?” Cas asks, squinting at the computer screen.
Dean jabs his spoon at his brother. “Don’t start with that shit on day one, Sammy. You better remember to respect your damn elders, or Bobby and Rufus’ll have you benched, Cy Young finalist or not.”
“I’m not good at dating. I haven’t been in a relationship that’s lasted more than a year in my entire life, and I’m a thirty-one year old.”
, Dean thinks,
The last few months have shown Dean that for the most part, his fears have been unfounded. His friends and family have been nothing but loving and accepting. So maybe he is the sort of person who can live his goddamn truth and tell everyone else to fuck right off.
Sam looks like he’s about to cry, which annoys Dean even more. He has to get all of this out, so he keeps talking. “I get that you’re sorry, and that you feel terrible about how this all played out. But I also get to be fucking pissed off at you for a while, OK? And maybe next time, you’ll put your goddamn ego aside and listen to the shit I’m telling you. When have I ever steered you wrong?”
Well, no. He’s
Dean blanches at the implication. “Nothing is up my ass! Just leave it, Sam I mean it.”
“Thanks so much for your advice and everything. You’ve been great,” Dean says as he walks her to the door.
Cas frowns. “I don’t understand that reference.”
I get selected, pencil me in to be fucked senseless that weekend. Otherwise, the minute I have a more than 24-hour break from squatting behind the plate for nine innings at a time, you’re taking me to the backseat and making a man out of me.”
“Yep!” She responds brightly. “The queers can assemble faster than The Avengers when they find something they want to publicly support.”
Cas groans again and puts both of his hands on Dean’s hips. “
“Clearly!” she says, gesturing to Cas. “Seriously, though, I’m really happy for you. Both of you.”
“I’m working on it, I swear.”
The campaign,
“I just thought that was as close as you were going to get to saying the words ‘this is the object of my affection, Doctor Castiel Shurley.’ You’re not exactly forthcoming with the emotional talk.”
From Bobby (9:36 am): Don’t worry toomuch, son. It’sall gonna wrk out.
__________
“It sounded sexy, when you said it. Somehow masculine, coming out of your mouth, and not infantilizing.”
“Do you think she saw us?”
To: Samsquatch (1:18 pm): k
Dean moves the phone away from his mouth and says to Cas, “Dude. Nike wants me as their spokesperson! I’m shooting something with friggin’ Megan Rapinoe!”
“Yeah, I figured. Sorry. I also have a salad though, and meatballs!” Cas says excitedly.
“Criminal law. I was transferred from my position as the DA in Smith county in Lebanon to Nashville. Right now, I’m an ADA, but I’m working my way back up to DA for Davidson county.”
Cas looks back down at his menu and Dean clears his throat.
“See, Dean? He’s fine. Now walk your little fairy ass on out that door and leave me and my
But I got one thing right”
“Shit, uh…I don’t know, actually,” Dean says as he leans over to check the bedside drawer.
Dean, on the other hand, isn’t trying to hide anything. He’s beaming with pride.
“I just…I just can’t. There’s too much history,” Dean says, looking at him with genuine remorse.
“Are y’all gonna watch the show from back here or do y’all have seats?” Dean asks.
“Proverbs 3:5. It’s a verse about trust,” Castiel says, looking down and running his thumb over it.
“Yeah, something like that,” Dean laughs, nervously.
Jody raises her eyebrows and cocks her head to the side in that motherly way she’s been doing since Dean can remember.
“No, it’s okay, Cas. He’s, uh, he’s gonna be okay. Long recovery ahead of him but he’ll be fine.”
“Nicholson’s a legend. Hands down one of the best actors of all time,” Dean says.
“Cake time!” Sam shouts above all of the conversations being held in the small restaurant.
“I just wanted to make an announcement really fast, if that’s okay?” Cas starts. The entire table nods in unison, so he continues. “Some of you know this already, and I’m sure some of you, if not the rest of you, have your suspicions. I just wanted to go ahead and formally announce to everyone at this table tonight that…,” Cas takes a deep breath, “that Dean and I are dating.”
Dean finishes cooking about an hour and a half later and they all sit down at his kitchen table to have breakfast, which consists of pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon, and toast.
“I know what you mean. Um, no. That’s not something that’s ever really been on my radar. I don’t usually have unprotected sex,” Cas answers.
Several years ago, after spending so much time with Sam and Eileen’s boys, Dean and Cas decided that they wanted kids of their own. But, with Dean being legally dead and Cas not existing on paper, they couldn’t conventionally adopt. Fate seemed to be on their side, though, when Claire and Kaia showed up to Christmas in 2023 with a newborn. Dean jumped into defensive dad mode immediately and interrogated the girls, asking if they were sure they were ready for this and how they planned to continue hunting if they were taking care of a baby. Kaia tried to cut in and explain, but Claire grabbed her arm and shot her a look that said, ‘let him finish’. To this day, she still loves to rile him up.
Benny takes his hand off Dean’s shoulder and heads back into the room. He plugs Dean’s phone into the charger and walks towards the door.
“I didn’t mean to put you on the spot, Dean. I just, I really want to apologize for not calling you sooner. I just wasn’t sure how to talk to you,” he says.
“Sssssss, fuck that’s cold,” Dean hisses.
“Stayin’?” Dean asks.
“Alright, so I don’t need to start cooking until five or five thirty then,” Dean says, taking a bite of his syrup drenched pancakes.
Dean hangs up the phone and walks inside. He heads straight upstairs to bed. This has been one hell of a fucking day.
Sam follows and leans against the railing next to him.
The band spends the rest of the night drinking and playing pool in Benny’s den. They put money on each game, obviously, and Dean ends up taking home $400 by the end of the night.
“Sounds good,” Cas smiles and kisses Dean again. He can do this. If Dean’s gonna be by his side, he can do anything.
When Dean gets out, he checks his phone to see a text from Sam.
“You sure about this? Last I heard, you were seein’ someone,” the man says.
“Don’t worry about Sam and Jess. I, uh, I kinda already told Sam about you…,” Dean trails off, worried about how Cas will respond to that.
He gets up, stretching his entire body and cracking his neck to help with the dull ache. He walks over to Cas’ door and he hears the shower running. He opens the door and sees that the bed looks the same as it did when they left it earlier that night, so Cas must’ve slept on the couch with him.
“I can vouch and say he was a cutie, you know, if you’re into that kinda thing,” Charlie says.
“Dean,” Cas says as he starts to get up and walk over to him.
They spend the next couple of hours going over the plan. Dean notices that Jack hasn’t said much.
A crackly voice comes through the callbox.
“No sir, not typically,” Dean laughs nervously.
Dean’s heartbeat quickens. Did Cas just ask him what he thinks he did?
“You know…HIV,” Dean says, already feeling bad for asking, but knowing it’s important.
He shoots Cas a text on the way to his office and lets him know he’s running a few minutes late.
One of us took that one from Mexico, threw it in the trash
“Morning, Dean,” Cas says, peering out from behind the shower door.
“’M just gonna head back to the hotel,” Dean says, his eyes getting heavy.
“Well, maybe just let him work it out. I’m sure he’ll tell you if he wants to,” Benny assures him.
“Hello?”
Dean’s eyes well up with tears again but he holds them back, nodding in understanding.
As soon as they step into Dean’s bedroom, he’s turning around and pushing Lee up against the door.
Dean doesn’t answer him. He just walks back out onto the balcony.
Dean smiles down at his phone and then he looks up at Sam,
Dean takes a deep breath and Cas secretly squeezes his hand.
Dean half smiles and looks down at his hands, which are now folding over themselves.
“Okay, okay, I’m done,” Cas says, emerging from the bathroom, pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s cheek as Dean studies his outfit in the full length mirror hung up on the wall.
Dean half smiles. That’s the same advice Sam gave him. Maybe he should just listen to it.
Dean’s woken up by the sound of someone banging on his hotel room door. He rolls over and he’s immediately met with the sensation of nausea.
The group meets up outside of the hotel to take a shuttle back to the airport early Sunday morning. Dean and Cas are the last to show up, Dean noticeably hungover. Benny whoops and hollers as they walk outside and Dean flips him off before rubbing his temples.
The world begins to fade away as he transitions into the second song. They decided on just two due to time restrictions, but Dean is putting his heart and soul into this performance regardless of how long it lasts.
Dean slides his hands down the back of Cas’ pants, cupping his ass. He bites Cas’ bottom lip and then starts to kiss along Cas’ jaw and down his neck.
“I know, it’s not your fault, Dean. I’m just worried that the more people that know, the faster it will get around and I’m not ready for that.”
“Well, she must’ve been really special to get a song like that out of you!” Ed says.
Dean hears something crash against a wall inside Sam’s apartment. Sam gave him a key when he first moved in, just in case, so Dean quickly lets himself in just as John Winchester is raising a fist to Sam’s jaw. Dean grabs his arm and whips him around and punches him square in the face. He stumbles backwards a few steps and then he steadies.
“She’s pretty perfect, isn’t she?” Dean says, unable to take his eyes off of her.
“Alright everybody, this is a new song I wrote recently…very recently, actually. It’s not on the album, but, uh, it’s something that’s been on my mind lately, so I decided to just say ‘fuck it’ and perform it for y’all,” Dean says to the crowd. “I hope y’all like it.”
They get back to their room around 11:30. Dean stumbles in with his arm around Cas for balance with Sam and Jess following closely behind.
“Dean, what exactly did happen?” Cas’ voice breaks his self-deprecating train of thought. Dean looks up at him. Cas doesn’t even remember?
“I’m, uh, gonna give y’all a minute. I’ll be downstairs,” Benny says before shutting the door behind him.
Castiel takes his eyes off the tv as Ellen sets down another beer. He takes this opportunity to look at Dean for the first time since he sat down next to him. He hadn’t noticed how green Dean’s eyes are before now.
“You sleep alright?” Benny asks.
“Dean,” Sam says, knocking on his door, opening it before he has the chance to respond. “I know you’re grieving, but we gotta do something about Chuck. You said Billie told you he was the one taking everyone?”
“I’ve never been here before,” the dark-haired man returns.
He opens his eyes and takes a look out into the crowd and sees hundreds of tiny little lights. People have turned on the flashlights on their phones and they’re waving them back and forth. Dean smiles, closes his eyes again, and picks up the second verse.
“What happened…,” Dean repeats, “well, we-uh, well,
“Oh shit, you’re Dean Winchester! I thought I recognized you.”
“Hey Gilda, how’ve you been?” Dean asks as he wraps an arm around her shoulder and kisses her on the head.
Dean frees his arm from Sam’s grasp and gets in one last punch before Sam grabs his entire body and pulls him up off the ground.
Dean sighs and looks down at his beer. He understands. How can he not? Not everyone can just come out freely. Hell, if John hadn’t caught him when he was fifteen, he probably never would’ve come out to him. And he knows Cas struggles with this whole thing.
Cas continues to loosen Dean up, inserting a second finger and then a third.
“Well then you’re gonna have to learn, Dean. Because
Dean laughs and wipes his eyes.
When he walks in, she’s sitting at the same table in the back that she always is, but this time, she’s got company.
Cas slides into the now empty booth and Dean slides in next to him. Cas moves a little closer to the wall as Dean moves in and as much as it bothers Dean that Cas won’t let him touch him, he understands.
“I already propositioned shower sex this morning, Cas. You turned me down for sleep,” Dean teases.
“I’m fine. God, I wish everyone would just stop fucking worrying about me. Shit happens, I’ll get over it,” Dean says.
“No, Jack. He, uh, he just needs time to process,” Sam clears his throat. “So, uh, what did you find in the book about the spell?
They stay and watch Luke perform before they all head back to the hotel and crash for the night.
“Hang on!” He yells at the door as he runs to the bathroom.
Once both men are cleaned up and dressed, they head downstairs. Dean says goodbye to Lee and tells him he hopes to see him around, but they both know the chances of that are pretty slim.
Dean throws the pillow Cas threw back at him and they both start laughing. Cas dials the pizza place and orders two pizzas, one Hawaiian, and one with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. He teases Dean for liking everything but the kitchen sink on his pizza.
“Honestly, not the most comfortable place I’ve ever slept but also not the most uncomfortable place so…,” Dean trails off.
“ I love you, too,” Cas says back.
Castiel nods. He appreciates the sentiment, but he’s done talking. He pulls Dean back down by the nape of his neck and presses their mouths together.
Dean buries his head in his hands and groans. All the shit about his father must’ve been too much. He knew it was too soon to go into all this crap, he should’ve listened to his gut and kept it to himself.
As soon as Dean knows Sam is gone, he heads downstairs to the bar in his living room and pours himself a drink. He’s running low, so he makes a mental note that he’ll have to run to the liquor store soon to restock.
Dean avoids making eye contact with Bobby as he peers his head around the entrance to the kitchen, hoping to catch sight of Jody so he has a reason not to answer Bobby’s question. Unfortunately, she’s not in there, so he looks at Bobby and says,
Cas’ eyes start to water.
Dean gets back to the hotel around four in the morning, now adorning an ivory-colored cast from the base of his fingers to the middle of his forearm. He heads back up to his room, turns everything off and goes to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
“Hi, Gracie,” Kaia tickles her, causing her to squeal and squirm in Claire’s arms.
“Hey, hey, none of that. You’re tougher than you think, Dean. Look, I’ve known you for a long time, right? I’ve known you through countless relationships. You’ve made it to the other side when each of those ended, right?”
“Look, man, I can’t let ya drive like this. You can barely walk,” Dean says.
When Dean finally decides to leave again, he’s the last of Benny’s guests to do so. He looks down at the keys in his hand. He’s kinda drunk. He doesn’t live more than ten miles from Benny’s house, so there’s a chance he could make it back fine. But there’s also a chance he couldn’t.
“And how did he take that?” Eileen asks.
“I’d like to get to know you a little better. Maybe we can start from the beginning?”
“Can’t wait!”
Cas smiles, grateful that Dean feels the same way. They undress and climb into Dean’s bed, falling asleep within minutes, Cas nestled comfortably under Dean’s arm.
“I need to shower before we go anywhere,” Cas says, unenthusiastically.
“Okay, don’t judge me,” Cas hesitates, “I like Hawaiian.”
“Where ya goin’, brother?” Benny asks, stumbling over to him.
As Naomi brings the dessert to the table, Cas clears his throat.
’s ‘bout you. So’s, uh,
“Alright, Benny. I better head home. Thanks for yesterday. I needed that,” Dean says.
They sit down in the booth opposite Sam and Jess as Jo comes over to take their drink order.
He starts pulling open drawers in his bathroom until he finds what he’s looking for; cover-up. Good thing he let Andy convince him to dress in drag to go to that bar a few months back. Not necessarily something Dean is going to start doing regularly, but he'll admit it was fun.
“They’re gonna be a blast. Mexico is always a trip. I’ve never had a bad show there, knock on wood,” he says as knocks on the bar to his left.
He lays his head back down on the pillow and rolls over to find Benny lying next to him, still sound asleep.
“Then let’s go.”
Dean stares at him for a moment before saying anything. He always knew Sammy was more of the settle down type, so it should be no surprise that he wants to marry Jess. He just didn’t expect it to be this soon.
“That was the last thing I expected, but it was the best possible outcome.”
“Right. Tonight, then. Come over to my apartment at 7 and I’ll have dinner ready.”
“I got you these,” Dean says as he hands the flowers to Cas, “it’s kinda cheesy to bring flowers I guess, but-“
He laughs and locks his phone. He doesn’t have to deal with this shit.
“Why didn’t he say anything sooner?”
“I, uh, you know what, lemme just run out and pick some up real quick. 10 minutes, tops,” Dean says as he starts to get up.
“Because I was scared,” he says. “Scared of this, scared of us. Scared of the world knowing. Scared of allowing myself to feel this way.”
“Unless, of course, they never find my body because we’re so deep into the middle of nowhere that no one actually comes out here. It might take years for someone to find me and by then, you’ll have had time to get rid of all of the evidence and-,” Dean cuts him off with a kiss once they’ve arrived at their destination.
“He wasn’t ready to-,” he’s having a really hard time concentrating on the conversation, partly because of the alcohol and partly because his dick is straining against his jeans. “To, uh, he wasn’t ready to come out,” Dean manages to say.
“You sounded good,” Cas says, “I went on their Facebook to hear the song they were talking about you performing at the sushi bar. Am I wrong to assume it was about me?”
Dean groans as Cas pulls himself out of Dean and heads into the bathroom. When he doesn’t follow, Cas emerges from the bathroom and helps him to his feet.
“She was right, this will pair nicely,” Cas says as he unscrews the cork and pours a glass for Dean and himself.
“No offense, sweetheart, but I don’t trust you anywhere near a hot stove,” Dean laughs.
Jack looks up at him.
“Nice to meet you, Cas. Follow me, I’ll get you boys a table.”
“Awesome, see you in a few.”
Castiel gets up from the table and extends a hand to Dean. Dean takes his hand and stands up to follow him into his bedroom.
“I, uh,” he thinks for a minute and then he remembers he almost called Cas. He stands up and walks over to the other side of the room, finding his phone underneath the desk chair.
“Already gone,” Dean laughs, “have a good day, Bobby. Thank you,” he says, sincerely.
Dean hadn’t realized three whole days had gone by. He slept through most of that time and when he wasn’t sleeping, he was drinking, which means Sam’s probably right. He needs to eat something.
As soon as Sam and Jess are out of the room, Cas punches Dean in his side.
After the minor delay regarding who’s topping and who’s bottoming, they pick up right where they left off. Dean pulls his jeans and boxers off and starts rolling the bottle of lube between his hands.
“Alright, enough dilly dallying, boys. Y’all better go get prettied up before the red carpet,” Bobby says, shooing them all out of the rehearsal area.
As they’re finishing up their lunch, a tall, bearded man in his mid-fifties walks out from the kitchen towards their table. His salt and pepper hair is pulled back in a bun under a hair net and his black apron has flour hand-prints all over it. Dean introduces the man as Cain, and he introduces Cas to Cain as his friend, even though that still makes him uneasy. Cain slides into the booth and places his arm around Dean and they chat for a minute while Colette runs Dean’s card, giving him a huge discount, before they say their goodbyes.
“Dean,” Bobby says with a sympathetic look in his eyes, “if he didn’t realize what a great catch you are, then it’s his loss, you hear me?”
Dean shoots a playful glare in his direction before throwing the sweatpants he was still holding at Benny’s face.
“I know…I know. I’m trying, Dean, I really am,” Cas says.
“I don’t know, Dean, just-,” Sam begins before Dean cuts him off.
“I’m happy to hear that,” Cas says. They’re both silent for a moment.
Lee watches him struggle while trying not to laugh at the deeply concentrated look Dean’s currently wearing.
“The guys deserve it, they worked real hard on this one,” he says in response.
Cas lays Dean down on the bed and Dean stares up at the ceiling with a huge smile spread across his face.
Dean got a smile out of him. This stone-faced human being who’s barely given Dean a second thought since he walked up just smiled at him.
Cas pushes his arm and then grabs his hand.
I did my best to make sure the meal they have in Mexico is authentic, but I'm not Mexican or even Hispanic so if I made any errors, please feel free to let me know so I can correct them!!
Dean smiles as Cas turns around in Dean’s arms and kisses him. Dean tastes like whiskey, but Cas doesn’t mind.
Realization sets in on Dean’s face. He doesn’t say anything, but he thinks he might know where this is headed. There’s only one reason John Winchester would get mad at his straight son over a girl.
Dean sighs. He’s quiet for a while, aside from a sniffle every so often. Sam doesn’t press him anymore. He lets him take his time.
“Oh! I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Charlie says, “how’d your date with blue eyes go?”
“What happened? I don’t know how I got-,” Cas is interrupted by the crash of Dean’s lips against his.
“Aces,” Dean says, coming up to wrap his arms around Cas’ waist. “Merry Christmas, Cas. Smells good.”
Dean leans back and just sits there, stunned. What the fuck just happened? Why wouldn’t Cas let Dean kiss him goodbye?
“I’d like that,” Cas says, smiling at Dean. “I’d better get back inside; lunch break is over in a few minutes.”
“I haven’t seen you in ages, where’ve you been, Winchester?”
He stopped jerking himself off a while ago, balling his hands into fists while he cried. He punches the wall of the shower. Then he punches it again, harder. He punches the wall several more times, sending his fist straight through the tile on the final punch.
When they finish cleaning themselves up, they get redressed and head back out into the living room.
Lee doesn’t say anything. He just stares at Dean, who’s not sure if the emotion he’s looking back at is love, flattery, or regret. Maybe it’s all three.
Dean can tell Cas is fuming, but he knows nothing good will come from Cas egging John on.
“No, no, I don’t wanna stop,” Dean starts to relax, and he leans up to look at Cas. “Keep going, I want you to keep going.”
Luke walks out, shakes Dean’s hand and then pats him on the back, thanking him for his introduction. Dean and the guys head off stage allowing for Luke’s band to replace them.
“You act like I don’t own any suits, Cas. What kind of man would I be if I didn’t own any nice, tailored suits?” Dean says, slightly offended by the assumption.
Dean gets to Bobby’s office around 8 and walks in to see him elbows deep in paperwork, a phone between his shoulder and his ear, and four cups of coffee scattered on the desk, three of which appear to be empty.
“I’ve only ever been with women,” Castiel begins, “I mean, I’ve never even looked at a man in….
“Alright, alright, well, as much as we’d love to hear all about the new mystery lover in Dean’s life, unfortunately, the segment is almost over and we’ve gotta start wrapping up,” Storme says, much to Dean’s relief.
“I saw the letter,” Dean starts, pulling back to look Cas in the eye.
Cas rolls his eyes and nudges Dean’s arm.
Cas smiles at him and then he walks over to the closet to help Dean find something to wear tonight.
“Looks like you’ve got a pretty good friend.”
He sits down between Sam and Cas and Sam pats his hand on his knee. Cas must’ve told him how much of a wreck he is right now.
**SPOILERS FOR TRIGGER WARNING**
“Don’t be him,” he says. Dean watches the door close behind him. He sighs and begins to pack. He walks into the bathroom to grab his things and he notices a giant, fist sized hole in the shower wall.
“There’s nothing to talk about, Dean. I knew this could never work. I’m sorry. Please leave,” Cas says.
“What’d you have in mind?” Dean says, cockily, mimicking the expression on Cas’ face.
“I just…I just needed a familiar touch,” Dean looks down at his feet as Benny walks towards him.
They arrive at the Roadhouse for the party at a quarter past 5. They would’ve gotten there sooner if Dean hadn’t spent so much time in front of the bathroom mirror. Cas makes sure to remind Dean several times that
“I love this show, I never wanted anyone to know that,” Dean says, laughing.
Sam looks back up with a huge smile on his face. Sam will never admit it, but Dean knows his approval is important to him.
Dean gets home and wraps the gift he got for Cas. Better safe than sorry. If Cas didn’t get him anything, then he’ll save it for another time or maybe just return it or something.
“Oh, stop it, Cas. You did most of the work, I was pretty much just a glorified assistant,” Sam retorts.
“Right, yeah I wasn’t really planning on finishing it anyway.”
“Like I’ve said before, if he doesn’t know how great a guy you are, he ain’t worth it,” she says, patting him on the back and pulling away.
“That’s your problem. You’re not a man. Never were. Dunno where I went wrong with you, ‘cause I sure as shit didn’t raise a girl and yet, here you are,” John says. It takes everything in Dean not to lunge at him and beat him bloody, but what good would that do?
“Yes, I’ll head over there right now.”
“5? Jesus Christ,” Dean says.
Cas obviously isn’t buying it.
“Oh my god, this is amazing,” Cas says through a mouthful of cake.
No answer.
Dean’s smile fades and he watches his fingers as he traces circles on Cas’ chest.
No explanation to follow, Cas just admitted he purposely turned away from kissing Dean.
“I know you can. You’ve been practicing day and night. You actually sing in your sleep, you know,” Cas whispers, to make sure no one else in the dressing room overhears. “I’m pretty sure even I know all the words at this point.”
“Cancun? Hell yeah, I wanna take that spot!” Dean says excitedly.
"I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
“What’s wrong?” Cas asks, confused.
“Gotta go now, first day of work’s tomorrow. G’bye, Dean,” Castiel slurs.
Dean groans.
Cas smiles down at his food and then he looks back up at Dean.
Dean feels like such a little bitch right now. He’s getting so worked up over something so trivial and for what? So he can pick a fight with Cas? What good is that going to do? Cas hasn’t responded yet, so Dean texts him again.
“How do you know all that shit?” Dean asked before popping a few blueberries into his mouth. They were like little flavor bombs.
As he listened, he felt Carmen’s hand on his shoulder and she said something.
The next morning after Cas left for work, Dean wrote in the unused notebook Cas had set out for him during his peyote trip. He didn’t write anything about the actual trip since the details of his hallucinations were starting to fade somewhat. What remained of the experience, however, was the clarity with which he now saw his life. Whatever he decided to do, he had to set things straight and be more awake in his own life. Per Sam’s suggestion, he made a list of everything he had to do, something he’d never done before.
He rolled his eyes. “How about not using the leaf blower next time?”
4. Ask friends for money to get Baby back? Do I still have friends?
“You could still go, right?” Cas asked, digging the toe of his tennis shoe into the newly exposed dirt at the foot of the step.
“Why didn’t you tell him the truth?” Dean asked as Carmen sat down and began to eat her own eggs.
Dean interrupted him by pulling him into a kiss. It was brief and chaste, but Cas returned it without hesitation. Dean then pulled Cas into a hug resting his chin on Cas’s shoulder. Cas, who was a couple of inches shorter, pressed his face into Dean’s neck.
“About what?” Dean asked.
“May I touch you, Dean?” Cas asked, his voice now quiet and close.
“Dean,” she said when Dean turned around, “This is Castiel.”
Crowley, a look of disgust on his face, continued, “Not to mention you tried to grab my dick the other day.”
“What, seriously?” Dean said, lifting himself up on an ebow. He was not expecting that. “Isn’t that like super-trippy shit? I mean, I did acid once, but it was the worst.” He shuddered thinking about that party when he was eighteen and someone gave him a tab. He ended up reliving one of the worst memories of his life and screaming like a crazy person while Carmen and a couple of guys had to hold him down to keep him from running into traffic. They had to call an ambulance and everything. It was humiliating. Jesus, he hadn’t thought about that in a long time.
“At the Terra Sun Garden Center,” Cas said, puffing out his chest a bit with pride. “I’m a nursery technician.”
Lee bounced into the room, a scrap of paper in his hand, as Dean zipped up his coveralls. He waved the paper in front of Dean’s face. “Sparkle’s phone number,” he said with a smirk, offering the paper to Dean. Dean stared at him blankly for a moment and then recalled, as if it happened in a different lifetime, that he and Lee had been making a game out of trying to get that stripper’s phone number for months.
Dean didn’t look at the food for a long time, but the horrible smell got to him, and he rolled over slowly to examine it. It was the type of breakfast Carmen typically made on the weekend--two sunny side up eggs, two sausage links, and a piece of buttered Texas toast. Dean would have usually wolfed down such fare, but now it smelled like death, and all he saw was repulsive congealed animal flesh and secretions. He picked up the plate and tossed the contents out the open window into the yard. He wasn’t hungry anyway.
As Crowley stalked away back to his office and Dean was still processing what just happened, he heard Charlie calling to him. “Dean, come on! Let’s go look at some boobs!” Earlier in the day, Dean had agreed to go out with everyone to the strip club after work, something they’d been doing together at least once a month since forever. Carmen had her usual girls night planned with Amara. Dean had been reluctant, but Charlie and Lee insisted. Charlie looped her arm through Dean’s and pulled him toward the locker room so he could change. “You think you’re gonna have a whole Harry Potter thing going on on your forehead?” she asked, pointing at his bandage. “That would be awesome!”
“Hey, Dean?” Sam said. Dean stopped and turned back around. Sam looked around the room, twisting his big paws together nervously before saying, “I’m still wrapping my head around you and Cas, but I can tell there’s something between you guys I never saw with you and Carmen, so, y’know, I won’t give you a hard time or anything.”
Castiel smacked the thick catalogue down on the counter next to the cutting board and leafed through it. “I know I’ve said before that the university is part of the establishment, but some of these courses sound fascinating,” he said. “Did you know that they have a class called ‘Insects of Your World,’ and something called ‘Insect Systematics’? I could take a class called ‘Ancient Magic and Witches,’ and look,” he said, pointing at a page he’d settled on, his excitement growing, “there’s a class about the Dead Sea Scrolls. I’ve always been fascinated by them. The Environmental Sciences department seems particularly interesting.”
A dam breaks when he’s finished answering, and several questions are shouted at him at the same time.
“Griffey doesn’t count! Anyone would go gay for that man. And Garciaparra married Mia Hamm! They’re fucking sports royalty! Of course I worshipped that shit.”
In the end, the American League manages to secure the victory, winning 6-4 and ensuring home field advantage for whichever AL team makes it to the World Series.
Dean leans into Cas’ touch. “This fucking sucks,” he mutters, the fight draining out of him. He knows that concussions are serious business and he has no desire to become a statistic, but it’s the
“I mean, uh, we trust you completely,” he amends.
Cas is facing away from him so all Dean can see is his back, which sports the All Star Game jersey Dean had given him this morning.  The name “Winchester'' is stitched across his shoulders, arcing above the number thirteen. They’d had to part ways early on in the day so Dean hadn’t seen him wearing it until now, and
“Are you sure you don’t mean James Dean?”
Dean groans. “No, you’re not fucking wrong, Milly.”
“Yep, just like the cat,” Dean agrees. “And then you zoomed yourself right into the coffee table and bonked your head so hard you had a big red bump, and I felt like the worst dad in the world!”
thing. I swear I wasn’t grossed out by the guy-flirting. I was grossed out by the Dean-flirting.”
he’s snuck kale into but pretends he doesn’t taste. Who sits in the dugout with a serene expression on his face, seemingly just as geeked out as Dean is to be able to have a career in baseball. Who will lounge on the sofa with him and massage his shoulder while they binge campy sci-fi shows.
He crinkles his brow in confusion. “What else would I wear?”
, Dean. And before you accuse me of favoritism ‘cause I raised your scrawny ass, I’d say the same to any of my players. You know how serious concussions can be, and we ain’t messin’ around with this. You hear me?”
“Who the hell wears leather in June? In Southern California?” Dean mutters to Cas.
“Yes, I do.”
“I know,” Dean says, bringing his arms around Cas’ waist and shuffling closer to him. “But I want this. Really. I’m just nervous.” He huffs out an annoyed breath against Cas’ throat. “This is so dumb! I haven’t been a virgin for 14 years and now I’m getting all emotional?”
“Well, sure. You can’t throw a stick without hittin’ an idiot in this sport, but that don’t mean we have an uprising on our hands.” Bobby pauses, and then asks carefully, “Speaking of idiots, have you talked to your brother?”
“I me-member!” Claire chirps, tugging on the hem of Dean’s shorts. “I ran so fast! I had de zoomies just like Gus.”
“I thought your family knew you were gay?”
! How dare she think she has the right?!”
“Drink that water and take some more deep breaths. You’re ok.”
enraged?
extremely alluring behind the wheel, especially when you wear those Wayfarer sunglasses you have. You look how I imagine Sal Paradise to look, and fourteen-year-old me would slap current me in the face if I denied myself that.”
“OK, great! So we’ll start from scratch. Dean, I know you have a pretty low-key social media presence. The last thing you tweeted was something about Sam’s no hitter, and that was three days ago. And you haven’t posted to Instagram in...let’s see... almost four weeks, and it was a picture of some of that pink crap the MLB puts out in May to pretend it cares about women.” Charlie looks up from her computer and points at Cas. “Now, you, I can’t find on any social media platforms, besides LinkedIn.”
Dean’s eyes widen in shock.”Huh?”
Dean threads their fingers together and waits for him to continue.
“Holy shit, dude,” Dean says quietly.
“I mean, I’ll tell my family and people I trust. Sam, Bobby, and Gabriel know, and I told Benny before dinner last night. If this thing between us keeps going like it has been, I’ll tell Ellen and Jo, and...uh, my dad, maybe. Eventually.” He clears his throat. “But Cas, is keeping ‘us’ quiet a deal breaker?”
Dean has no idea how he’ll convince Cas that he’s worth it. Or if he even believes that he’s worth it to begin with.
The Angels wind up facing the Tigers in the AL Division Series and beat them in a three-game sweep of the best-of-five series. The games go so well that Dean feels like he’s in some sort of 90’s sports-movie montage, complete with a Kenny Loggins soundtrack and dugout hijinks, courtesy of Ash.
“You really sayin’ your presence on the field is all that’s gonna get us to the Series? Not that you ain’t had a great year, but you sure ain’t the end-all, be-all of the entire 2020 Angels team.”
Beyond Walker sneering at him and staying as far away from him in the dugout as possible, Dean’s mind is completely focused on the game by the time he catches Ash’s first pitch. When it’s his turn to bat in the bottom of the first inning, Dean’s again greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. He finds himself immensely grateful that this whole thing went down during a home stand.
Cas frowns and cocks his head back at her.
“You mean the rumors that
Sam and Dean look at each other for a moment before Dean ticks up a single eyebrow, and Sam shrugs.
“Yeah, I’m fine, I just ended up, like, seven miles away and my hips are starting to bug me. Can you come get me?”
Surprising absolutely no one, Dean gets selected for the American League All Star Team in mid- July, having been voted in by the highest number of votes for any single player in the history of the All Star Game. He’ll be joined by Mike and Sam, and, as is tradition, Bobby gets the nod to manage as his team had made it to the World Series the previous season. The event is being held at Dodger Stadium, and Dean’s incredibly relieved not to be traveling.
He’s absolutely not expecting to hear the cheers that erupt at the mention of his name. Ash smiles and points behind Dean at the right field bleachers, where he turns to see a large section of brightly dressed fans jumping up and down, waving rainbow flags. The jumbotron is zoomed in on a little girl sitting on a woman’s shoulders, holding up a sign that reads, “I love the Angels and so do my two moms! #pride” in glitter.
“I think the first or second one in this series will work.”
“I want it to be a date.” He feels sudden clarity; apparently, being told ‘no’ has forced him to come to a decision.
And he’s spent the past twelve hours still feeling the echo of Cas’ lips against his, imagining what it would be like to be able to kiss him whenever he wants to. Of what it would be like to have someone as supportive, thoughtful, and dependable as Cas at his side.
“The point of a text message is to avoid calling, dude,” he says with a smirk.
“You have a mild concussion, but are in good physical health otherwise. The collision should cause no lasting damage.” Dr Moseley says calmly.
“Stop that, CB,” Dean admonishes gently, moving his hand away. “You’re a big kid now and your teeth hurt when you bite me, you little vampire.”
Dean’s frown deepens. “No, I don’t want to come with you and Ash to get friggin’ burritos. You couldn’t have just interpreted no text back as a ‘no’?”
“Absolutely. If you want it to,” he says. “But if you want to have some time to yourself I won’t be offended. We’ve spent more nights together than not in the past few weeks, and I don’t want you to feel like we have to share a bed just because we can.”
Sam laughs. “That must’ve been the fatal flaw in my plan. Maybe I can pay Cas to continue using his wiles to trick Dean into eating healthily.”
Dean throws his hands up in exasperation. “Of course this shit is scary, Cas! I’ve never felt this level of immediate attraction to someone before, let alone someone I haven’t even seen naked. Then there’s the shit you brought up, about crappy track records and ethics. And yeah, ok, you’re the first dude I’ve ever wanted to pursue something, uh,
“I guess we can thank your immune system,” Cas responds. “Past experiences aside, I really do want this with you. Now, if you’re amenable.”
Cas chuckles. “What constitutes gay as fuck’?”
“You guys know that I’m not great with the emotional talk’”—everyone except Gabriel and Ruby snort and/or chuckle—”but today is different. Or, at least, I’m trying to make it different. On Sunday, Sam did something incredible. He achieved something that most major league pitchers will only ever dream of. And I’m so goddamn proud of him.” He turns to face Sam. “I’m so goddamn proud of you. If you don’t get the Cy Young this year, I’m going to send flaming bags of shit to every journalist who votes for someone else. Cheers to you, Sammy.”
Dean just stares at Sam silently, his thoughts racing.
“Well, I’ve been fasting and already undertook the less-pleasant portions of preparing for anal sex.” He raises his eyebrows at Dean’s dumbfounded expression. “You’ve had anal sex before. Please tell me that you took the necessary steps to ensure a sanitary experience.”
“Your level of cheeriness this morning is both unnatural and unnerving,” Cas yawns, reaching for his toothbrush. “I already packed my bag before coming here last night. It’s downstairs by the door, so I just need to get dressed and make it to the stadium to get on the bus.”
Dean holds the base of his dick in his fist and lines himself up, pushing his hips forward. He sighs audibly when the tight heat of Cas swallows the head of his cock.
blasting over the stereo, on his way to have dinner with a hot dude who can kiss like nobody’s business and has an ass that just won't quit, it feels damn good to be letting himself go for what he wants, for once.
“Hey-a, Cas,” he says, squeezing his shoulder in greeting.
Cas grabs the wipes after they’ve caught their breaths. He taps Dean’s shoulder and they clean themselves up, smiling dopily at each other.
, you know?”
. You’re the ones who voted for Verlander,” Sam responds, raising an eyebrow. “I won 21 games, too, and I didn’t have to rely on anyone banging garbage cans to get the run support from my offense.”
There’s silence for a few moments before Cas speaks again. “Now that we’ve confirmed titles, I believe we should have a conversation about sex.”
“I’ll take a beer. Thanks.” He looks around the loft. “Great place you’ve got here. Do you and Dean own it?” Before Sam can answer, Dean decides he’s been feigning nonchalance long enough and joins them.
“That’s exactly what I mean! You have no idea if you even really want this… whether or not this is just a phase for you.”
Dean shrugs. “I’m fine. Long day.” He shuffles over to the refrigerator and pulls out a beer, not caring about the inevitable headache that’ll follow drinking on an empty stomach.
Cas raises a single eyebrow in response.
“Purgatory?”
Dean clears his throat. “I mean, it wasn’t terrible. Dad was
Dean looks completely flabbergasted. “Uhh...no?” He weakly high-fives Ash.
in agreement. “He’s letting his guilt with your situation influence his ability to perform today. But knowing what I do of Sam, I’m not surprised that he’s been unable to put his feelings aside. You’re the most important person in his life.”
Dean tries to take a breath but the wind was knocked out of his lungs and he gasps awkwardly, his throat constricting. His head throbs painfully and he squeezes his eyes shut. He hears the angry, indignant shouts of his teammates and Rocker’s response of, “I thought there was only one out!” There doesn’t seem to be any actual fighting going on around him, so at least the benches didn’t clear for an all-out brawl.
flying, and this particular flight was turbulent enough to cause him to literally white-knuckle his way through the three hours. What he’d really wanted was to sit next to Cas and let him run his fingers through his hair like he does when they’re falling asleep together. It’s soothing as
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dean, seriously.  I’ve always known you were into dudes, too. I just figured you’d talk to me about it when you were ready, and I thought last night you were kinda introducing me to your boyfriend.”
“When you tried to get him to eat grilled chicken, were you wearing the face of a handsome young doctor with ocean-blue eyes?” Benny asks Sam, a faux inquisitive look on his face.
“Now that I believe. I’m sure you’re an ace when it comes to tying people up.” Cas’ eyes widen in shock. “Tying things up. Not people. I mean, it’s perfectly well and good to tie people up, as long as it’s all safe, sane, and consensual... dear God, why am I still talking?” Cas puts his head in his hands and groans.
Dean smiles and gives her a hug, squeezing tightly, silently letting her know that he does, in fact, love her dearly.
“Ouch, Sam!” Dean punches his brother lightly in the arm. “Dissed at your own party.”
“Mmhm, I’m very wise,” Cas replies seriously.
So it’s really not a Thing, this whole “maybe, sometimes being attracted to guys” situation. It’s just an aesthetic appreciation for the male form. He’s, like, an artist or whatever. A regular Pablo Picasso. Plus, Dean has always liked women, as well, so it’s never been too tough for him to willfully ignore the pull he feels when he sees a nice, tight ass on a man. He just shuts the door on it, like he has with his anger at his father and his unresolved grief over losing his mother. He’s self-aware as fuck, ok?
Dean retired from playing two years ago, and since then he’s taken a role in player development with the team, but has plans to take over for Rufus in the next few years. He has aspirations of managing a team one day, but he knows he needs some more coaching experience before he takes on that role.
The MLB passes judgement on Rocker and hands him a large fine as well as a long suspension. He’ll be out for the rest of the season and into the next. His lawyers are appealing the decision, but the prevailing sentiment from the public and around the League is that he got what he deserved for the stunt he pulled. The Yankees release a statement that they condemn Rocker’s actions and will respect and support the ruling by pulling him from the lineup, resulting in speculation that he’ll be released from his contract and out of a job by winter.
“Looks like you outed yourself, Dean-o,” Gabriel says from the stage, smiling mischievously. “Why don’t you come on up here and take some of the pressure off your little bro?”
Dean’s eyes widen and he lets out a strangled laugh. He’d told Cas about his crush in confidence, dammit. “I mean, yeah! Broke my heart when you went to Cincy and I didn’t get to see you play against the Royals as often.”
He hesitates for a second, his thumb hovering over the screen, knowing that he’s going to have to look Cas in the eye as he admits to wanting to bottom. But, knowing Cas, he was never going to let this come up without actually speaking about it face-to-face. He sighs and swipes his thumb across the screen to connect the call.
From Cas (11:15 pm): Yes, Dean, I promise I won’t forget your toothpaste. God forbid you’d be subjected to using Tom’s of Maine! And, I miss you, too. My apartment barely feels like home, these days…
The best, though, the absolute best, is making Cas laugh. Dean honest-to-God thirsts for the wide, open smile that precedes a full Castiel Shurley belly laugh. His eyes crinkle shut and he throws his head back, baring the expanse of his pale neck and the chiseled jawline that’s perpetually darkened with stubble.
“Hmm?” Adler says. “I didn’t hear anything.”
“You wearing the stirrups?”
And absolutely
But today he’s in the opposing team’s dugout, along the first base side of the Friendly Confines of Wrigley, and he’s glad to be there. It’s the third inning and Dean is watching the rare sight of Sam taking some practice swings in the on-deck circle. Because they’re playing a National League team in their home stadium, there’s no designated hitter and the pitcher has to take his turn at bat.
“Hate to see you leave, love to watch you go!” Dean calls.
“I feel like, the entire time we’ve been dating, I’ve been waiting for something to ruin it all. Because I don’t get to have this, you know? Why would I, out of everyone in the world, be allowed to have someone like you in my life? So I was just sort of treading water, grateful for every second with you.
“OK, but you benefit from me filling the jar and getting a reward, too, ‘cause it’s your turn to choose the
“I’m not Florence Nightingale-ing you!”
“Uh, yeah. All of those things.”
Dean’s cleats dig into the moist dirt inside the circle of the pitching mound, and Sam tosses the resin bag he’d been holding to the side. He lifts his mitt to cover the lower half of his face, making it impossible for the cameras to pick up any of their conversation.
Sam sighs loudly. “I hear you.”
Dean frowns, trying to remember if he’d shoved any in his travel bag, when he hears Cas’ triumphant “A-ha!” followed immediately by him falling onto Dean and accidentally elbowing him sharply in the side.
He leans down and kisses Cas, cutting off what Dean has learned to recognize as the beginning of a Dr. Shurley Lecture on Something Obscure.
“Hey!” Dean hears Sam’s voice clearly over the din of reporters still yelling their questions at his retreating back. “Have some decorum! I’ll answer your questions about my mediocre performance, ok? Dean’s already said his personal life is off limits. Just lay off him, Jesus…”
“You didn’t take an oath not to bang your patients. I Googled it.”
“Well that’s shocking, frankly. We were together for nearly fifteen years before he died last November.”
“I have an overwhelming desire to say, ‘I told you so,’ but my self-preservation instincts aren’t that terrible,” Sam says, chuckling.
Kershaw’s fastball is damn-near unhittable when it’s on, and tonight it’s
There was no way that any person who was at their house last night would’ve taken that video, let alone leaked it to the press, besides Ruby. They practically caught her red-handed.
, and Dean is surprised to find that he’s not only
“I told them to come at quarter to seven, which means Sam will get here in”—Dean checks his watch—“about five minutes, Bobby about ten minutes after that, and Jo and Ellen will roll in by seven thirty. Which is why I asked you to come at seven, so I could have time with my boyfriend before the invading horde arrives.”
Sam had actually gotten some pretty good hits in during batting practice, but Dean still thought he looked as awkward as a baby giraffe with a bat in his hand. And he couldn’t wait to see his brother’s reaction to his walk-up song.
From: Cas (2:55 pm)
Cas had been incensed when he saw the statement and had paced around Dean’s bedroom citing passages in the New Testament that had been mistranslated and deliberately misinterpreted to further a specific agenda. “If you actually read the Ancient Greek texts, you’ll see that it was, by and large, more modern scholars who put forth the toxic ideas that support conservative mores. The Jesus Christ of the Bible would abhor this sort of message. And that’s not even taking into consideration the editing done by ecclesiastic councils
When he reaches his car, he sees Cas putting his briefcase into his Prius.
“That’ll be nice. Should we offer to host dinner here one night?” Cas is fiddling a pen between his pointer and middle finger, and Dean watches as he accidentally lets it slip out of his grasp and it skitters across the table.
Sam gets another chance at the plate in the fifth, and he hits a single to drive in another run.
His body is relaxing more and more and the fullness that bordered on painful, at first, has shifted to a fullness that is
Baseball was a habit that had been cultivated as a result of Dean’s desire to give his brother a sense of normality. What was more quintessential to the American experience than baseball? The first time he played catch with Sam was during a stint at Bobby’s. He was ten, Sam was six, and Bobby was managing a minor-league team in Iowa. It was late fall—Bobby’s season had ended a few weeks earlier—and it was cold enough that Dean had had to bribe Sam to wear his thick winter coat while they played outside. He’d found some old baseball gloves in the shed and showed Sam how to fit the adult-sized mitt onto his small hand.  Dean demonstrated the proper throwing and catching form, encouraging him to cradle the ball in the palm of the glove. But the mitt kept weighing down Sam’s hand, causing the little boy to drop the ball over and over again. He threw the glove off in frustration and demanded that Dean just toss him the ball bare-handed.
Cas raises his eyebrows, looking surprised. “Are you alright? You’ve never kissed me in public before.”
Because yeah, Cas is indeed a thing that would make him happy (Self. Fucking. Awareness, man.).
Cas raises his eyebrows in surprise. “She used a dildo?”
“Don’t be an asshole because you’re uncomfortable having emotions, Dean,” Cas chastises, rolling his eyes but smiling despite himself. “But if you’re planning to give me your letterman’s jacket, I’ll wear it proudly.”
“In that case...good.” Dean licks his lips. “So, how about the All Star break for me losing my ass-virginity?”
“I think he’s recognizing that you look like his toy,” Dean says, laughing.
“Whatever you want to do is cool. But you know Jo and Ellen will just be happy for you.”
When they’d begun exchanging fluids, and Dean had remarked that his level of preparedness took some of the sexy out of their sexytimes, he’d been treated to Cas’ TedTalk about safe sex practices. “I’ve been to medical school and I can tell you with certainty that the human body is a veritable germ factory. You know what’s not sexy? Going to the emergency room because your partner has fecal matter poisoning.” Then there was a PowerPoint which Cas had entitled, “Enemas
Dean coughs and shifts in his seat. “Shut up,” he mutters and shoves his brother with his shoulder.
It’s his apologetic, defeated tone that really grates on Dean’s nerves. “You need to cut this shit out right fucking now, man.”
Dean mentally berates himself for giving in to the temptation, but feels immediately vindicated when he sees that Cas has his eyes on him, watching with interest. Dean winks from beneath the visor of his batting helmet and Cas’ cheeks color when he realizes he’s been caught staring. He turns away quickly and disappears into the dugout.
“You two’re acting like toddlers, so I’m treating you like ‘em!” she responds, folding her arms across her chest. “Cas? No pie for these two. I mean it.”
Dean’s sharp bark of surprised laughter rings out over the clicking of camera lenses and causes most people to swivel in their seats, looking for the source.
mood; while he’s not really a morning person (particularly without caffeine), he’s been waking up lately with a spring in his step. Today, for example, his alarm went off and he’d rolled over to see Cas still sleeping soundly next to him. He was on his side, his mouth slightly open with a bit of dried drool at the corner, and any annoyance Dean felt at being jerked out of sleep to go to work was forgotten. The knowledge that this was his, this quiet moment where he got to observe Cas completely relaxed and looking fucking adorable, settled over him and made him feel sorta light and floaty.
He quickly strips the rest of his gear off, wraps a towel around his waist, and starts to rifle through his cubby to find his shower kit. He startles when he hears a soft, “Hello, Dean,” from behind him, banging his head on the top of the cubby.
“I shouldn’t have asked you if you wanted it to be a date.” He shakes his head, apparently upset with himself. “It’s incredibly unethical to be romantically involved with someone I’m actively treating. You could take me to court for even suggesting it.”
. You have a giant nerd brain and you are a complete idiot!” He lowers his voice, “Cas is in here!”
“Yeah, of course. She always comes,” Dean waves his hand dismissively. “I think she’s getting in on Tuesday, and she agreed to stay with Sam. He wants Jo to consider coming down here for the long weekend, too. I think it’s part of his continuing efforts to suck up to our family to make them forget the Ruby shitstorm.”
A booming bassline suddenly starts blaring from the speaker on Ramirez’ cubby shelf, and slowly the rest of the team goes back to getting ready for the game.
“So, Cas, do you keep in contact with your other siblings?” Sam asks.
This is the fluffiest and most ridiculous epilogue to an already fluffy and ridiculous story. I hope you enjoyed it! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for reading. Please comment/kudos if you feel so inclined! I absolutely love hearing from you all. And, stay tuned for time stamps (I've become slightly addicted to imagining Dean's butt in baseball pants and I've decided to make it your problem as well).
If Cas has told Bobby the nature of their upcoming meeting, the manager gives nothing away. He leads the team through a split-squad simulation game without giving Dean a second glance.
“Man, there’s nothing like a sunrise out here!” Sam calls out, a bit breathlessly, as he walks into the kitchen. He grabs a glass out of the cabinet and flips on the faucet, toeing off his running shoes as he fills the cup.
I have no idea how Ken Griffey, jr. feels about the LGBTQ+ community, but I have to hold on to giving him the benefit of the doubt because I love him and the heart wants what the heart wants.
“I didn’t think about it like that,” Sam licks his lips and looks up at Dean, meeting his gaze.
“Did I?”
[photo: teenage girl in a softball uniform with her arm around a taller girl wearing a band uniform and holding a flute]
Dean’s mouth drops open.
Dean raises an eyebrow at Rocker and smirks. “Got something to say?”
Dean is completely unsurprised to hear Cas speaking to Caleb like he’s an adult.
The painkillers that Dean was given are apparently wearing off, because his head is starting to throb again. “That’s not what I meant and you know it.”
“No, I understand. Or, I believe I do. I’ve spent the past few weeks doing little else beyond thinking about you, and then trying to convince myself not to think about you.” Cas looks up at Dean, and grimaces. “Which, of course, led to more thinking about you. But it wasn’t anything solid. My fantasies couldn’t blow up in my face or cause me real pain.”
people. For people whose father didn’t use the word “faggot” with malice in his voice, and who didn’t grow up in locker rooms where being accused of liking dudes was tantamount to being a serial killer. For people who aren’t professional athletes that would lose their careers for having a relationship with another man.
He chuckles, presses one more swift kiss to Cas’s lips, and then Dean is out in the hallway, straightening his clothes as he makes his way back to the clubhouse.
.” He thumps Benny on the back. “God, I needed that laugh. You’re a treasure, Benny Lafitte.”
At first he finds himself miming the signs he’d give Ash from his position on the bench, but by the third inning Dean has settled down and accepted that he can’t psychically send Milly the pitching sequence he’d call for if he was behind the plate. And hey, so far the kid has done pretty well.
He jumps at the sound of Cas’ voice, whipping around in a parody of their first meeting. “Is Wednesday a date?” he blurts out.
“I’m not sure how you think I get my kicks, but I assure you, fucking around with Nike money isn’t one of the ways.”
Cas is leaning on his Prius, which is parked next to Baby in the garage. “Yes, I’m still here. I’m not really sure why.” He has his hands in the pockets of his jeans and he’s frowning at the ground, not looking at Dean.
“I gotta get back to preppin’ for this weekend’s series. Consider talkin’ to your brother once you’ve cooled down, at least for the sake of the game on Sunday, you hear?”
“You’re consenting to have these two gentlemen hear your results and be part of the discussion regarding your treatment?”
Dean rolls his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest. “Repercussions, for you? What’s gonna happen?
Dean looks up at the ceiling, praying to whatever deity is watching to give him strength. “Sam, come on! If she’s here, I can’t, like,
a nutrient rich breakfast.” Dean waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I fucked up. I can’t imagine how awful—”
“Cas? You’re still here! Thank fuck!”
Dean’s saved from defending his curmudgeonly ways by the return of the kid, now accompanied by a cameraman.
“I did
Dean complies, nipping and licking at Cas’ stomach and chest as he works his way upwards. Cas pulls him into a deep kiss and wraps his legs around Dean’s hips, giving Dean the opportunity to press their groins together and rut against him for a few moments.
Just then, the door to the press room bangs open and a little girl runs full-force at the raised platform where Dean is fielding questions.
had somehow gotten hold of a photo showing a beaming Dean and Sam in their little league uniforms and had tweeted it, causing the hashtag #WinchsterBrotherGoals to trend on Twitter.
It makes something warm and happy unfurl in his chest, and Dean begins adjusting the straps on his chest protector so that he has an excuse to duck his head down and hide his huge smile.
“Fuck. Babe. I
“Just quoted some fuckin’ Bible verse,” Dean waves his hand dismissively. “It wasn’t even a big deal, and none of the other guys said anything. It’s just annoying, you know?”
died! And that you’d never mentioned him to me—that you’d lied to me when you said you’d never had a long-term relationship before.”
“I take it back.”
“He’s been on a fitness kick lately, and it’s actually been a pleasant surprise to find that I enjoy spending time with one of my siblings.” Cas shrugs and tucks the Tupperware of leftover salmon beneath his arm. “Thank you so much for hosting. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with you.” His eyes are focused on Dean as he says this, but he lets his gaze slide to Sam for a moment before smiling warmly and exiting the loft.
“Do I still get to loosen you up myself?” he asks Cas, pulling back from his lips.
Dean feels emboldened by Cas’ reaction, and powers through the next part of what he wants to say. “But, uh, most importantly, I trust you. Completely. I was nervous when you first asked about it, because all I could think was, ‘Oh God, what if it hurts, or I hate it and I want to stop, and it disappoints Cas?’ And I guess, realizing that I’m completely ass-over-tits in love with everything about you also made me realize that I don’t think I would disappoint you in bed, just because there’s something that doesn’t work out the way we thought it would. That, like, you won’t leave me if I didn’t meet your expectations, or whatever.”
“So, you gotta wake me up every two hours or something to make sure I don’t die?” He asks Cas.
“Listen to your brother, Winny the Two. You did your job damn well,” Benny says.
well.
“They need every doctor they can get, but I completed my residency in orthopedic surgery before switching focus. I am indeed a ‘real’ doctor.” Castiel tilts his head again, regarding Dean curiously.
Sam looks surprised but relieved when he sees Dean, and immediately slouches down just a bit (the damn giant) to let himself be drawn into a hug.
Dean reasons,
Sam looks up from where he’s reading on the sofa, his eyebrows making their best effort at disappearing into his hairline. “Uh, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a broom or a vacuum in here… I’m pretty sure the cleaning service brings all that stuff with them.”
Garth, their traveling secretary, starts handing out room keys to the team. When he approaches Dean, he double checks his phone and switches the keys around in his hand.
,” he says, looking awestruck.
“Oh, Ellen, this is Cas. Castiel. Uh, Doctor Castiel Shurley,” he clears his throat, “My boyfriend.”
“Yeah, of course good things! Anyway, that’s Gabriel—he’s the president of baseball operations for us—”
He looks down at himself and realizes that he doesn’t even have shoes on. He’s standing in the garage barefoot, in only his underwear, holding his car keys.
“Yeah, I know.” Sam looks confused. “I remember the time I walked in on you and Rhonda at Bobby’s house when you were a senior…” He shudders. “You were
“Come in, I guess.” Dean opens the door wider and steps aside, allowing him entrance.
A good 45 minutes later, Dean emerges from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, feeling the same combination of nervousness and excitement that’s been buzzing within him all day. All of the prep had been a lot easier than he’d built up in his head, and while it’s not something he’d want to do every day, it’s not the worst thing he’s done for sex.
Cas starts plating their dinner, and Dean watches him for a moment, deep in thought.
Dean swings around, pointing his finger in his brother’s face. “You! You invited Cas here! For dinner! In my home! With me … And you! Us!”
Dean snorts in derision. “Not really. You saw him out there.”
“My shoulder? Not really. Bobby just wants him to take a look at me and probably recommend some strength-training exercises or something.” Dean never talked about his various ailments with Sam, as his brother tended to take on the burden of care like it was his own injury. He’d made that mistake when he pulled his hamstring his senior year in high school, and Sam had taken it upon himself to monitor his every movement. “Now go get your crap together before we head out. Only you would workout before our workout. I don’t know who raised you to be this way, ‘cause I sure as shit didn’t.”
Everything happens quickly from there. He’s strapped onto a wooden stretcher and put on the back of a golf cart, flashing a “thumbs up” at the crowd and biting his tongue against the urge to claim that he’s
“And there
A young woman nods her thanks and stands up to ask her question. “Since Bobby announced that this season will be his last before he retires, your name has been coming up a lot in conversations about who will be his successor. Will you be throwing your hat in the ring?”
“Let me guess, Leviticus?”
how much you gave up for me, OK? You think I don’t feel terrible every day, knowing that you could’ve had an easier time without having to fill in for Dad?”
object.)
Dean realizes, a full minute later, that he’s still standing in the middle of the room, his mouth hanging open.
Cas lets out a sigh of relief, and Bobby looks visibly reassured.
“Huh?” Sam asks.
“Sammy, we only really got together at the end of February. I’m gonna come across like some clingy adolescent girl.”
Dean’s taken aback by how disappointed he is to hear this. “Oh.”
“Thanks.” Dean kisses him briefly and goes to meet Sam.
“I know.” Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s temple. “I’m going to talk to Dr. Moseley about your test results some more, and you should rest. Hopefully we can go back to the hotel soon.”
Dean winks. “OK fine, never a Boy Scout. But you’d never guess it if you’d seen my knot-making skills.”
“Millions of people before me have figured it out without your diagrams, babe. I promise to seek help if I need it, OK?”
Dean sighs. “Cas and I, we’re...we’re not together. I’m not lying about that.”
“You never asked.”
he thinks.
“I thought we agreed this little chat would be about Jenkins here and his nasty slider, not about me and any hypothetical future job postings.” Dean raises his eyebrows at the assembled reporters and pats the shoulder of the young pitcher sitting next to him. The Angels had signed him from the Dodgers a few weeks ago, and he’d had his first team workout that afternoon. “Y’all have the next, like, nine months to speculate on who’ll take Bobby’s place. My money’s on Taylor Swift bringing her talents to Anaheim. Now, can we please get back to a relevant discussion?”
“And if you’re looking like you’re gonna puke right now because you’re worried about my reaction to your intended being a man? Well, first of all, I don’t care one lick what gender you date as long as they treat you good. And second, you weren’t foolin’ anyone with those Leonardo Capricorn photos you’d stick under your pillow. This really ain’t so surprising.”
“It’s fine, man.” Dean sighs. “There’s just so much shit to sort through, you know? I feel like the first thing has to be figuring out how long Cas is gonna put up with being in a secret relationship.”
“I could tell you were enjoying yourself. Has anyone ever told you that you have a very expressive face?”
“Ok, folks. Let’s get back on track. Last question.” Gabriel scans the crowd. “Kevin, let’s have it.”
“Dude. It’s completely different! Can you imagine the fallout if I had a public relationship with a dude?! My career would be
“What the fuck?” Dean mutters. He calls for time and walks towards Ash on the mound.
“Any time, bitch.”
Fucking
Cas looks unconvinced. “Be that as it may, Sam has a point about your diet influencing your body’s ability to heal. At the very least, you should start taking some supplements.”
“You’re proud of me?”
“You did real good today, son. But you’re at 108 pitches and it’s the first game of the season.”
“Sammy, stop being an idiot!” Dean straightens up and finally turns around, taking in his brother’s bright-red face with ill-concealed glee. “This is at least a little bit your fault, you know. You encouraged me to go after what makes me happy.”
“I’m fine—” Dean begins, but is immediately cut off by Cas.
“Me lying like a dead weight on top of you?” Cas’ voice comes out muffled, his face stuck in Dean’s neck.
“You don’t have to do that, Cas.”
Dean purses his lips to avoid blurting out the sarcastic comment that’s on the tip of his tongue. He waits a moment to gather his thoughts, trying to imagine what he’d want to hear if he were Cas. “I know you’re not trying to shame me or anything. It’s just, like, trying to unlearn all the shit I’ve been telling myself since I can remember and trying to fight against my instincts is tough. But I’m right there with you, you know. I feel like the luckiest son of a bitch in the world, being your, uh, partner… or boyfriend, or whatever.”
those that came before!
“I like to think so.”
“I was just jealous, you know,” Dean says quietly.
Dean is momentarily stunned into silence.
Dean could hear the eye roll over the phone. “Oh, ha-fucking-ha, asshole. Your batting average is still under .300 against me.”
Yeah, anything can happen in the playoffs, and maybe it’s hubris but Dean’s brain keeps drifting back to his fantasy of getting the chance to beat the Yankees.
“I don’t know, Dean,” Cas replies slowly, his eyebrows drawn together in thought. “I think you’re underestimating the popularity you and this story have. The queer community has been incredibly vocal in their support for you.”
. For
“Dude!” He kisses Cas’ cheek, avoiding his morning breath.
Dean pumps his fists and yells, “Fuck, yeah!”
Dean chuckles. “Yep!” he kicks out again to start the hammock swinging, content to rock lazily with Cas until he has to go to work.
Dean hears the clink of bottles banging against each other in the background of the call. Not too early to be shitfaced, then.
“Aww, did you miss me?” Benny winks. “Too bad Sammy had to go and sign his deal, or you’d’ve been hunting with me this winter.”
Cas looks up and smiles warmly, marking his page and setting the book on the nightstand. “Everything okay?”
“Dean is under the impression that being with Cas will signal the end of his professional career,” Sam explains to Benny.
“You mean you don't want to talk about the fact that you went three-for-four at the plate and got three RBIs on Opening Day?” Sam asks innocently.
“He’s certainly started out the season with dazzling numbers,” Peter replies. “And what’s it been like having your little brother in the clubhouse?”
He’s underneath the car and humming along to the Pink Floyd album he’d put on when he feels his phone vibrate.
“Huh,” Dean says, plopping down on his back. “That’s a good one, actually.”
Sam appears, holding a six-pack and smiling. “Hey, Cas!” He hands a beer to Dean. “Want a beer?”
“Now? Dude, nothing’s happened yet. What if we try dating and it falls apart immediately?”
They make plans together for off-days and schedule appointments around each others’ agendas. They bribe each other to do the dishes and take the garbage out. Dean encourages Cas’ experiments in the kitchen, and even starts to look forward to his meals that always involve some sort of creatively-concealed vegetable Dean’s never heard of. He will never admit this to Sam—who has become increasingly more smug with every vegetable that he finds out Cas has succeeded in getting Dean to eat—but dinners following Cas’ visits to the local farmer’s market are usually the food-related highlight of his week.
It’s not too different from a normal day off, all things considered. If anything, his opinion is taken more seriously by Bobby than it otherwise would be.
Dean finds Cas in the far end of the kitchen, loading the dishwasher.
Dean turns his thoughts away from his family and instead focuses on his plan for the rest of the day. He’d bought all the necessary prep supplies the week before, storing them in one of the guest bathrooms to avoid thinking too much about the mechanics of the prep he’d be putting himself through. He’s been poring over Reddit posts giving advice to people bottoming for the first time, and at this point he feels like the world’s foremost expert on ass-related activity.
“Huh?”
“You’re shitting me.”
Sam leans back and turns his head, hiding behind Gabriel’s back, and mouths, “Jerk.” Dean just winks and mouths “Bitch,” back at him.
They’re almost at Bobby’s office, so they can hear his gruff voice ask, “Where’re your daddies at?”
Pushing himself up from where he was slumped against the wall, Dean scratches his nose conspicuously with his middle finger. “Sure thing, boss.”
Dean laughs brightly. “I think I’m a bad influence on you.”
The man in question walks back into the kitchen, this time accompanied by Benny and his wife Kathleen, who’s holding a squirming toddler in her arms.
Benny shoots Dean a speculative look before he claps him on the shoulder and steers him towards food. “I’m hungry enough to eat a horse, Winny. Let’s find some grub and catch up.”
“She’s just taking her own shit out on you, you know? There’s no truth in anything she’s saying.”
empathize and I need you to know that I’m damn proud of you. You’re owning who you are and you ain’t apologizing for it and that takes a helluva lot of guts.”
Jo snorts and rolls her eyes, “What’d you expect? Mom to faint?”
“I’ll keep
“Hi, Caleb,” Dean says, kneeling down to be on his level. “I’m Dean. I know you don’t remember me, but I met you a long time ago. I work with your daddy.”
Cas opens his mouth to inquire further, but at that moment Sam comes back out onto the porch with a bowl full of fruit salad.
“Why does everyone assume I want to be with Cas?!” Dean hisses.
“I’m not that bad!” Dean argues, wiping his grass-stained palms off on his pants and getting to his feet.
Cas grimaces. “Yes. My mother is a bit of a fanatic about certain things.”
Cas laughs. “The heart wants what the heart wants, and deeply-closeted, fourteen-year-old Castiel Shurley spent hours reading and re-reading
“Nah, I’m good.” He looks around, making sure they’re alone. “Cas and I, uh, we decided to try and date. See where it goes. We had to tell Bobby, though, and that’s what had me all distracted. Now we need to talk to Gabe, to make sure there aren’t any legal issues, or whatever.”
“I’m not done, Bobby.”
Dean left feeling buoyed; he still feels a lingering sense of liberation and content from the whole experience that’s not only giving him the confidence to stand his ground with his father but also the drive to do so.
He doesn’t. Instead, Cas puts his hands on Dean’s hips and pulls them flush against his own, closing the scant distance between them and pressing his lips gently against Dean’s.
“Sorry for getting all mushy.”
They make their way into the kitchen of Dean’s large home in Laguna Beach. French doors open up from the kitchen onto a large patio that overlooks the ocean, and Dean usually keeps them ajar to allow the fresh air in. It’s too much house for one guy, but when he bought it, it was mostly for the view and the thought that he’d be able to host his family and friends (and only a tiny bit because he imagined that, at some point, there might be more than just him living there).

From Samsquatch (10:33 am):
“Whoa!” Cas wraps his hands around Jack’s middle to stop him from crashing onto the floor. “Hang on, Jack-Jack, I’m almost done.”
Dean counts his inhales and exhales as best he can until he settles back into a normal pattern. He turns on
“I believe you,” Cas smiles. “Do you want me to send you the PowerPoint slides from my presentation on safe sex to help you prepare?”
He removes the headset, handing it back to the camera crew before turning to grab his bat and helmet.
Cas sighs. “Let’s play it by ear. I doubt we can finagle adjoining rooms without arousing suspicion.”
“Nice to meet you, Raffi,” he says to the plastic giraffe.
He squeezes Cas once more and releases him from the embrace, moving to where Sam is trying to wrestle the rest of the bottle away from Benny. “Come here, Samsquatch,” he says, opening his arms. He can’t even blame alcohol for his corny behavior—Cas had gone all Dr. Shurley on Dean and banned him from imbibing for the duration of his time on the IR list—he’s just happy as hell and wants to share the moment with his main impetus for playing baseball for the past twenty years.
“Don’t get me wrong, Cas. I totally want to share! Maybe we can get adjoining rooms?”
Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes. “All good things, I’m sure,” she says and moves closer to Sam, grabbing his arm and clutching his bicep.
“Agree to disagree, Dean,” Cas hands Dean his mitt and levels him with a quick but effective Cas-Head-Tilt-Cum-Soul-Penetrating-Gaze.
Charlie makes a sort of shrill screech when she looks at the screen. “This is perfect, you guys!” She holds her hand up for a high-five, which Dean immediately gives her.
“Ursula was woefully misunderstood,” Gabriel begins. “And besides, I think you’ve already sha-la-la-la kissed the Cassie, so that ship has sailed.”
Dean leans his head back and laughs. “Oh, my god.”
“Just ‘cause I don’t feel the need to announce my presence a mile away with a car that’s synonymous with a midlife crisis…”
“That was Gabriel. The team has a statement ready, condemning Crowley Media for their violation of privacy and making a blanket statement about supporting all of their players regardless of sexual orientation. He’s going to send it over for us to read before they put it out in a few hours.”
“Oh my
Sam seems to deflate a bit, and he leans back against the wall. “I just want what you and Castiel have,” he says quietly. “Don’t get me wrong. I’m so, so happy that you found each other. But there’s a part of me that’s jealous, I think. I know I said all that stuff to you about going for what will make you happy, and I absolutely stand by that. You’ve given so much to me, and to everyone you love. You deserve this happiness with him. But... I want to find that, too.”
“I was joking!” Dean lies, smiling. “I totally know that fruit-flavored cereal isn’t actually made with fruit!” (he doesn’t.)
to hear those things from you.”
, letting his eyes flutter shut as he enjoys the fruits of Cas’ sports medicine knowledge.
“Fuck,” he mutters, throwing his arm over his eyes to concentrate on 1) not coming before Cas even gets his dick in him, and 2) not doing something embarrassing like weeping over the depth of emotion he feels for the insanely hot dude who’s currently going to town on him.
sacrifice.”
“Sit your ass down, boy,” he says, shaking his head at Dean. “Glad you made it in one piece.”
Sam had bought a house just a few blocks away from Dean, and he was constantly going back and forth. He’d even taken to “helping himself” (aka
“Mind if I join you?” he asks.
“Yeah, no kidding.”
dad?” Dean’s voice cuts through the silence in the yard, and Cas’ fingers freeze. “You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” he continues, “but I just thought…I dunno. You never talk about him.”
“Sorry, dude,” he says, patting Cas’ thigh. “Hang tight, I’ll get rid of him.”
“Do you know how many followers on social media you had yesterday?”
He takes a deep breath and looks around, realizing that he has no idea where he is. “Shit,” he mutters and scrolls back to Sam’s messages, pressing the small, green phone icon.
“I love you,” Dean says on an exhale, “so fucking much.”
“Shit, maybe that’s how I’ll make my millions!” Charlie rubs her palms together. “Just kidding, I’ll do that with my hacking skills. Jeff Bezos can eat a bag of dicks.” She looks at Cas and Dean again. “In a totally non-sexy way, of course.”
“Shut up, idiot.”
Dean shrugs, moving to gather his mask and helmet as the half-inning winds down. “Yeah, they’ve been great the past few days, but as a whole they’re not exactly known for their huge influence in sports, especially baseball. I doubt that Rob Manfred is gonna take this too seriously.”
It’s not that their working relationship isn’t going well. There’s just the very minor issues of Dean’s entire body tingling any time Cas touches him and his stomach flipping whenever Cas directs one of his bright smiles at him.
“The last time I spoke to Chuck directly was in 2016, when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. I called to congratulate him, and I think our conversation was about thirty seconds long. I was so shocked he answered that I hadn’t even thought of what to actually say to him, only what I’d leave on a voicemail. As always, our dialogue was stilted and uncomfortable. He was distracted and, to be honest, I’m not sure that he
. Karl Ravech’s monologue posed questions about whether or not Rocker should be punished and even asked, “Does the Yankees organization condone homophobia?” For their part, the Yankees’ official Twitter released a statement condemning all forms of hate-speech, but declined to comment on Rocker specifically or issue any publicly-known punishment for his actions, and Rocker hasn’t given any apology or granted any interviews about the incident. He was left out of the lineup for Sunday’s game, but the Yankees manager claimed that he had always planned to give Rocker the day off.
“Well, that feels like enough serious conversation for a first date! We’ve signed contracts, told our bosses, and discussed secrecy. Shall we go ahead and make a blood pact or two?”
“I’m not signing my voice away to an evil sea-hag, am I?” Dean asks as they walk into the open kitchen-cum-dining area, quickly flipping through the suspiciously thick stack of papers that Gabriel pushed into his hands. “Bobby told me never to sign anything without a lawyer present.”
“Don’t

“So, can we do this now?” Dean asks.
in agreement, not looking up from the table where he has several files open in front of him. “Will Ellen be attending?”
“Yeah, yeah. Just ‘cause one of them is terrible doesn’t mean they all are. But it’s hard to remember that when people are asking one of your best friends if his sex addiction caused him to strain his hamstring.”
To Cas (11:15 pm): it’s not my fault tom decided to make his toothpaste taste like ass
“No, and I don’t plan on it.”
. After a few minutes, he leans over and grabs his phone off of his nightstand.
He’s not sure what he was expecting a “fixer” to look like, but Dean is confident that, prior to meeting her, he never would’ve described Charlie.
From Cas (11:31 am):
Cas’ gaze shifted to Dean at some point during his speech, and once again it feels like Cas is looking all the way inside of him. Like he’s looking at his soul.
, I’m going to lock him out for a week.”
“I’m happy to be currently sharing a bed with you, and would gladly spend every night of this road trip together.”
Rufus Turner, the intense, no-nonsense pitching coach that Bobby brought with him from Kansas City, was one of the few people who was able to get through Sam’s thick skull when he was on one of his holier-than-thou tirades.
Sam laughs. “Yeah. Ok, man.” He runs a hand through his hair, a familiar gesture that signals he’s uneasy about something. Dean braces himself for Sam to continue his questioning. “So if it’s not about baseball, then what the hell’s been up your ass?”
“Come here.”
, so Dean’s hoping that he’ll mix in a slider that he can get a hold of. He’d fouled away three fastballs in his last at-bat before striking out on a slider, so he thinks there’s a good chance the catcher, Smith, will call for a few in this plate visit.
“I think you’re overestimating my desire to get out of this position,” Cas says, pitching his normally low voice even lower. He licks his bottom lip slowly, wetting it with his tongue.

A few hours later Dean is settling into bed, waiting for Cas to finish in the bathroom and join him.
“You doing ok, son?” Bobby asks, stepping fully into the room.
Dean turns his head to capture Cas’ lips and settles his hands on his ass, squeezing gently. The thin material of Cas’ “relaxing pants” (he’d recently told Dean he firmly believes that people who choose to lounge in jeans are masochists) calls attention to his erection, which is currently poking into Dean’s stomach.
Dr. Shurley?” Ash points his finger to the ceiling, indicating the general area of Cas’ office.
“Whatever, loser. When you get back to LA, we’re gonna get back on track. Maybe we’ll even add some yoga in to help your hip flexibility!” Jo winks. “And hey, doc? Make him see a nutritionist. He thinks pumpkin pie is a vegetable.”
“Hey, ump! You gonna let him say shit like that?” Jesús calls to the first base umpire, Zachariah Adler, who’s standing a few feet away.
, can happen between the two of them.
They stand there holding each other for a few moments, smiling happily. All of a sudden they hear the floorboards creak, and Ruby emerges from the shadows near the doorway. Cas and Dean spring away from each other, but it’s pointless—she definitely saw them.
“Yes. Definitely.” He leans in and kisses Cas again, this time with more confidence. Excitement zings down his spine at the feel of wide shoulders and hard muscle under his hands as he wraps Cas in his arms.
“I’m not entirely opposed, but I believe that would be poor host etiquette.”
,” Cas’ fingers dig into Dean’s biceps and he comes with a choked-off moan a short time later, burying his face into Dean’s neck.
“Do you really think I’d be here if I hadn’t already made up my mind?” Cas steps forward, crowding into Dean’s personal space.
Cas shrugs. “You know I’m not particularly familiar with pop culture.”
He’s tired of second-guessing himself, of hiding and denying and lying.
Dean steps closer to him and lowers his voice, speaking into his ear. “Well, by ‘Wheaties,’ I mean ‘Cas’ tight ass,’ of course.”
“Wow. I don’t know what to say.”
Sam could also be considered a victim of her manipulation.
Walker stands up but Tony puts his hand out over his chest, stilling his movement.

“Dude. This place is spick-and-span. What the hell has gotten into you?”
“No, I haven’t had the honor,” Dean holds out his hand, chanting
“Nothin’. Just, you know… Opening Day! And you’re starting, dude.” He shakes his head. “Who woulda thought? The kid who couldn’t throw a ball more than two feet in front of him.”
“Wheaties, huh?” Cas appears next to him, an amused smile on his face.
Dean moves quickly, springing up to straddle Cas and pin his wrists above his head. “I won’t let you go until you admit that you flirted your perfect ass off at me.”
Dean holds up his hands to stop Cas’ worried questions. “No, no, nothing like that,” he responds quickly. “I’m just, uh, having trouble focusing, you know?” He rubs the back of his neck and looks at the floor. “It feels too big. Like, I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that we could win the
Cas starts to squirm under him and Dean lifts his head. “Cas?”
And then Cas had come barging into his life, asking for honesty about his injuries and his
Benny just laughs. “In almost ten years of friendship, you’ve never even said the word wedding. That oughta tell you something.” He winks.
Cas nods. He opens and bends his legs, lifting them so that his ass is bared to Dean. “I’m ready,” he confirms.
“Okay then… I’ll just tell him we need to cancel.”
“No,” Dean says immediately, reaching out to grab his hand. “You’ll get all the info anyway, and I’d rather have you here.”
“Aha!” Dean exclaims, triumphant. “We’re adorable.”
In early August, they’d played a series against the Padres, and Dean had chosen Nickelback. Sam had glared, but taken it in stride. That was the last time they’d played in a National League stadium, and Dean had been plotting since then to determine which song would cause Sam the most embarrassment without actually fucking up his concentration.
Cas chuckles. “It seems like we don’t need to worry about not having any photos together.”
“Oookay.” Sam looks unconvinced. “Are you like, stressed about the season? Worried about your injuries?”
“Twitter,” Dean corrects, chuckling. He moves closer to Cas and tentatively puts his hand around his waist, testing how it feels to be open around someone he doesn’t know.
“So, anything in particular you wanted to talk about, or did you just want to gossip about our crushes?” Dean rubs at the back of his neck, trying to knead out the tightness he feels.
“Jesus Christ! Are you a fucking ninja?” Dean yells, turning to look for the source of the voice. He’s met with the calm, yet jarringly intense stare of the clearest blue eyes he’s ever seen.
“Mmm, Cas, I love it when you talk literature to me, baby.”
“Finally! I’ve been trying to reach you for
Cas ignores Dean’s attempts at levity. “Dean, were you serious in your text? You want to try being penetrated?”
to. That it doesn’t require a conscious effort for him to respond truthfully about what he desires and needs from Cas. And apparently, right now, what he desires and needs is to regress back to the sixth grade and ask Cas to be his damn boyfriend.
They still have three more games in Oakland before they head back down to LA, and Dean should probably be preparing for tomorrow’s matchup with Ash. But he just needs a quick break, and then he’ll deal with all the shit that needs doing.
“That means a lot, thank you.” Cas scrubs a towel through his hair. “I do have an amazing video of Richard wearing a tiny Royals jersey, if you’d be interested…” he trails off, looking apprehensive.
Cas looks at them both calmly, as if Dean didn’t just miss getting beaned in the chest by a flying projectile. “Vic’s been pulling the inside fastballs to the left, so their pitcher’s been trying to adjust to get him to ground into a double play. But judging by his set up he didn’t notice that Vic also adjusted, so the next pitch would likely result in another foul ball but at a sharper angle to the left and thus right into the dugout.”
Dean grabs Cas’ hips and starts to thrust erratically, chasing his own orgasm. A few strokes later he comes moaning Cas’ name, and collapses into a boneless heap on top of him.
Dean scoffs. “Yeah, ok, but it’s different with me and Sammy. I practically raised him. I wouldn’t just randomly tell him not to date some chick for no reason.”
Dean waves his goodbye and wanders back through the house, trying to find Cas. He spots him in the backyard, reading on the blanket that had been spread out for Caleb the night before.
“Yeah, yeah, Mr. I’m Incredibly Comfortable Talking About All Aspects of Sex at All Times.”
He keeps his footsteps as quiet as possible as he makes his way to Cas and then says in a deep voice, “Hello, Castiel,” attempting his best impression of his boyfriend.
“No. Nope. I can’t believe how
“Well, I certainly wasn’t supposed to be aiding the enemy. But I couldn’t help it—you were always a favorite of mine growing up. And I know you were
“Are you sick or something? You look like shit.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I said I’m fucking
“Look at that, dude! Growth!” He pumps his fist.
Dean blinks open his eyes and sees Cas’ concerned face hovering above him.
“OK, so
Basic baseball info: in America, baseball teams are split into leagues (the American League and the National League), and within each league there are divisions (West, Central, and East) that are determined geographically and impact which teams play each other during the regular season. Thus, the Los Angeles Angeles of Anaheim are in the American League West division (aka AL West), and most often play other teams in the AL West (Seattle Mariners, Oakland A's, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers).
Cas’ body folds over him and strong arms are wrapped around his chest, pulling Dean even closer. He hears him groan, “
Dean grunts in acknowledgement. It takes all of his willpower to drag his thoughts away from visualizing beating Rocker’s skinny ass into the ground and back onto the field.
Dean grunts and repeats the gesture with more force.
He turns the water off and wraps a towel around his waist. Wiping some of the condensation away from the mirror, he gives his reflection a hard glare. “Nut the fuck up, Winchester. Your life is fine the way it is. Better than fine! You’re a goddamn professional baseball player, and you’re acting like a little bitch. Now go eat some red meat.”
Cas nods and reaches into his kit, quickly and efficiently disinfecting the area and placing a bandage over it.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asks, worried.
Ash walks up to Dean and pats him on the shoulder. “I’m feeling loose-y goose-y and ready to go, Winny. I gotta pee, you know how my nervous bladder is. Catch you in a few!”
Cas takes Dean’s hand and threads their fingers together. “Again, I’m sorry that you had to hear hateful words directed at you from your father. No one should have to endure that. But your strength and resilience is amazing to watch, Dean. And if it turns out you’re in shock and in an hour you need to scream and cry, I’ll be here, right next to you, on that plane.”
“Dean,” Cas says his name on an exhale, as though he’s been gut-punched. “I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you’re being so open about all of this. Emotional intimacy is just as important and powerful to me as physical intimacy, particularly with someone I care about and love as much as you.”
“I do.”
He pulls back enough to be able to look into Cas’ eyes, and feels himself settling deeper into a sense of calm.
, Dean thinks proudly, already filling out the probable pitching rotation in his head for the first round of the playoffs.
“No way!” Dean spits out, indignant. “Do the tests again.”
“Nah, the bottle is fine.”
“Make sure you wrap it up good, I don’t want to get AIDS,” Rocker says, glaring at Dean and Cas.
“We’re not dating. We haven’t gone on
Dean sighs and pulls up his messages.
“Hello, Dean.”

“You never told me you knew Ken Griffey, Jr.!”
does he like the look of it.
.” He lowers his voice and scoots closer to Cas on the bed.
“What do you mean?”
“Sam! Show yourself, you Jolly Green Asshole!” Dean charges into the loft and looks around wildly, waiting for his brother to appear.
Dean drops a huge dollop of whipped cream on what must be, at most, three pieces of fruit and smiles serenely. “Well, I guess we’ll never know.”
“He’s a natural,” Ellen says after him, looking pointedly at Cas, who blushes.
The only other times that he’s had specific desires to be with a guy have either been adolescent fantasies revolving around various celebrities, or that one time in high school when he’d had some serious feelings in his pants about his friend Chris.
“But obviously, you know, it’ll be great to have him catching me again,” Sam smiles genuinely for perhaps the first time since he entered the room, expanding on his answer to some writer from Bleacher Report. “Dean’s the guy who taught me how to throw my slider and how to stare down a batter. I wouldn’t be here without him.”
“Yeah. Clearly.”
“Oh. No, I’m still here.”
“Besides,” Dean continues, “I’m meeting with the new team doc after the workout today. I’m sure he’ll preach at me about the healing properties of tofu.”
“Yeah, still here.”
“Just give me the word and I’ll get out of your hair,” Sam begins, holding his hands up in surrender. “I don’t need to hang around here watching you give yourself diabetes.”
Dean has tried to prepare himself for this moment—for the point when his father drops all pretense and lets Dean hear his unfiltered opinions—and yet he’s still caught off guard by the nonchalance with which John tells his eldest son he’s an
“Yes, but it’s taken years for us to mend our relationship. By the time I was in high school Gabriel had moved out. He basically disappeared for a decade before resurfacing as a baseball scout. He actually changed his name for a while to avoid being granted favors on account of our father.”
Dean frowns and kicks his brother’s thigh to get him moving off of his bed.
In the space of a few days, the doctor (dubbed “Cas” by Dean, who’d decided that three syllables was two too many) has determined that they needed to focus on his shoulder and hips, deeming the regimen the strength coaches had drawn up for Dean sufficient to help protect his ACL.
“Are you expecting someone?” Sam asks. “Is Benny coming over?”
“I think you guys should tell
Stupid Sam and Benny wanting him to happy. Encouraging him to go for something he knew wouldn’t pan out for him.
Cas’ hands come up to unwrap the towel that’s still wound around Dean’s waist while Dean shifts so that he can tug Cas’ sweatpants down and off.
“I’d call it ‘wastin’ time bein’ a couple’a idjits’.” Bobby walks into the clubhouse and gives Dean an annoyed look before he claps his hands loudly. “We can spend time braiding each other’s hair and gossiping later. Everyone out on the field in two minutes!”
“Hey, Claire Bear,” Dean says, taking in his daughter’s thoroughly disheveled appearance with a grimace. The Batman logo leggings he’d dressed her in this morning definitely hadn’t had that hole in the knee, and the neat braids he had painstakingly woven her hair into were now barely recognizable. Her mouth is ringed in an unnatural blue and she smiles widely as she climbs onto Dean’s lap. “Where’s Daddy?” he asks her.
As Cas predicted, Dean faces Chapman, the Yankees closer, in the top of the ninth. He doesn’t get a homer off of him, but he does drive in the game-tying run with a sharply hit liner to deep left field. The Yankees get lucky in the eleventh inning when Vic commits a rare error, bobbling a soft bouncer that allows the game-running run to score. It’s a disappointing way to end such a hard-fought game, and a vindictive part of Dean is annoyed that Sam’s sloppy performance is rewarded with a no-decision. Yeah, he still wants Sam to win the Cy Young, but one loss wouldn’t ruin his chances.
“You don’t want to know,” Dean replies quickly.
“Is there anything I can do to help or make this better, right now?” Sam asks.
Dean groans, watching Cas avidly. “You fight dirty, man.”
“Cas! You made it.” Dean grins widely.
April rushes by and suddenly it’s May. The Angels find themselves in third place in their division, and while they trail the first-place Rangers by only four games, it feels like more. The offense has been struggling and Sam is the only starting pitcher with an ERA under 3.50.
abide Cas thinking that he doesn’t want him or doesn’t desire him. “Dude, no! I totally want to bang.”
funny, Dean Winchester.”
Cas smiles broadly and twines his fingers with Dean’s. “Thanks for wanting me to be here.”
“Uh, yeah… I mean, of course Dean’s presence influenced my decision, but I’d have signed with this club regardless. It’s a great organization and I’m proud to be playing here.” Sam fidgets with the bright red Angels hat in front of him. He looks uncomfortable and Dean tracks his brother’s gaze as it flicks around the room, his knees bobbing up and down under the conference table where he’s sandwiched between their manager, Bobby, and Gabriel, the president of baseball operations. Sam had been introduced as the new ace of the pitching staff just a few minutes ago, and was now fielding questions from a group of assembled sports writers. The room is hot and crowded and filled with the intermittent clicks and flashes from cameras. Dean is able to blend into the background, free to watch his brother sit at the head of the room and squirm under the scrutiny of the press.
“Sexuality is a spectrum!” Charlie sweeps her arms around her. “Some people like boobs. Some people don’t. Some people like everything, and some people like nothing.”

“Cas?” He calls out when he gets to the kitchen. There’s no answer, so he runs out into the living room and tries calling his name again.
before making the throw to Benny. He isn’t able to brace for contact before the burly Yankee slams into him and he’s thrown backwards. The force of Rocker’s hit crashes Dean to the ground; his head snaps back and his neck arches at a weird angle when the bill of his helmet hits the dirt and goes flying off.
“We’ll have you over any time you want! We’ve got a day off on Wednesday—why don’t you two come over for dinner? Kathleen would love to meet you, Cas.”
“The search continues.”
“Who are you?” Claire asks loudly, leaning around Dean to look at Jenkins while scrunching her little brow.

Dean pats Cas’ knee and says to Sam, indignantly, “My boyfriend thinks my calves are strong and muscular, so you can fuck right off, bitch.”
“Excellent! I think that’s the way to go. Now, based on my initial findings, I’m going to say that the press coverage is about seventy percent overall positive, twenty percent no opinion, just sort of re-reporting the facts that CrowFeed published, and the last ten percent is Fox News and like, trolls, which we can obviously ignore.”
“Hey!” Dean elbows Benny in the side.
She pats his cheek. “Missed you, too, sweetie.”
“Are you ready for that?” he finally responds.
Dean opens his mouth to immediately reply in the negative, but he hesitates. Instead, what he says is, “I’m not gay.”
Dean grins at him and shrugs. “I know, man. I know you’re right. It’s just hard to turn it off.”
And maybe it’s this. This quiet, mundane act of being in bed with the person he loves, that’s allowing Dean to comprehend this situation with a clarity he definitely wouldn’t have been capable of a year ago.
stretch of the imagination. It’s days like this that he curses his parents for having a second kid. He’s still angry enough that he wants to take Sam by his gigantor shoulders and shake the shit out of him, but he needs to make sure that Sam’s not in any immediate danger of being further fucked with.
“Someone sold a video to CrowFeed of Winny and Doc Shurley making out in his kitchen, and then Winny confirmed that they’re dating or whatever. And I guess Walker isn’t OK with the gay thing,” Milligan says, buckling his pants. He takes in everyone’s stunned looks and shrugs. “What? Am I wrong?”
“Don’t worry about it,” he said.
“I thought she was your friend,” he said.
