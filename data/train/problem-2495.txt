“Watson,” Donovan said, nodding to him.
She frowned. “What?”
“But you
John thought, only to watch Irene keep her hand out.
“You told me a long time ago you were flattered but not interested,” I said calmly. “I know…I asked you then if you had a boyfriend, merely out of curiosity, mind you. But…I’ve since come to realize I care for you and…if you have in any way changed your mind the offer is on the table. If not…well then…that’s no matter. I don’t blame you.”
"A bit," John said. "Yeah, I suppose so."
“He didn’t respond,” Kate told her. “But he got a bit riled up—though I think Dr. Watson was even more so.”
my kind of man.” Irene said.
Jeanette was the next to arrive. She came into the kitchen and kissed him.
“What was that, Mr. Holmes?”
After a moment Sherlock sighed and waved a hand.
“There’s no such thing as too much,” Irene said with a smile.
“Please,” he whispered.
He gathered his courage before stalking back over to the couch and sitting down next to Jeanette.
“Thank you,” Shannon said, though her glare his way indicated most of her annoyance. “I’ll just go put something clean on. Be right back.”
Irene took a deep breath, closing her eyes for a moment and relaxing back into the steam. She allowed herself to linger just a moment before she turned off the tap. Sliding a hand over her skin to remove some of the water, she admired the soft texture and the near perfect shave of her legs.
However, as he was about to look things over he heard Watson’s voice from behind him.
Perfect. Irene smile and reached for her phone. Kate’s eyes popped open as well, and she scrambled up to watch the screen, beginning to smile as she realized it was time for Irene’s bet to be tested. Would Sherlock finally respond to her? She did sort of doubt it, but there was no telling what strategies the women had. For all she knew, in a few minutes the two men would be a panting mess.
He rose and tried to move past Sherlock, only to have his arm caught in one slender hand.
Kate cocked her head but didn’t question. She was aware that Irene wanted to surprise all of them. And it was more than likely that she would.
“Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine, craving the distraction of the game – I sympathize entirely – but sentiment? Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.”
For once the flat wasn’t a complete mess to come home to. Sherlock seemed to have made some kind of an effort on that, and even the bloodied body parts seemed to have disappeared. And then one day there was milk when he checked the fridge. An item Mrs. Hudson denied having bought, both of them turning to eye Sherlock upon hearing that. What could possibly be going on in that funny head of his?
John felt sick. Between Sherlock’s horrible attitude and him kissing Molly, another text from Irene bloody Adler was the last thing he could take. He’d had it.
He glanced at the other girl beside Molly, raising a brow. Mary Morstan wasn’t homely by any means, but she wasn’t anything really interesting. Nothing compared to Molly at least.
She hadn’t been exaggerating. Quite a lot of damage. He would get no amount of recognition from that. No, better to rely on DNA testing…or…
But instead she’d lost.
Shannon’s dark eyes were boring into him, the smirk on her mouth made him want to spit.
The attractive looking fellow stood immediately and brushed past Donovan. She caught his arm.
“I said no.
Sherlock pulled up the internet and started doing his basic scans. Perhaps seeing what John’s basic history was might help him gather a bit more data as to his flat mate’s behavior. Sherlock nodded and set to work doing a basic scan of that.
John sighed and rolled his eyes. “Greg. Do you like her?”
"Your brother," John said. "Wanted me to tell you about her and her death and all. You were right, your plan worked."
John’s thoughts and behaviors towards Irene are not supported by the writer. I completely disagree with slut shaming and believe women should possess the right to have as much or as little sex as they like without repercussions, but felt a little trash!John was necessary for this chapter.
“Beats me, sorry,” John muttered, watching Sherlock go back to work.
“And where would you two be off to?” Mycroft said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I simply made a—”
Mycroft appeared in the hallway and offered a cigarette. Alarms went off in Sherlock’s head, but he kept his expression neutral and accepted. This was abnormal behavior for his brother, and he knew it. Something odd was happening, so he’d play to it and see what happened after.
He'd woken up on the couch with a massive hangover. His head was pounding, he could barely sit up. But when he had managed to finally push himself up a bit he'd discovered some amount of stickiness in his pants…like he'd tried to clean himself up and had failed. John had vague recollections about some dream with Sherlock again…pushing him down onto the bed and having his way with him. Mmm…
It was difficult to keep his smile at bay, but somehow he managed. “Oh, so simple. And who do you propose I have date Sherlock? Not such an easy match now is it?”
“So every time you get a text…”
“Hmm, fine.”
Chapter became a bit long, but I didn't really know how to break it up any better. And I hope it makes up for the long wait. Hope you enjoy it regardless!
“My day was perfectly fine, actually,” Molly said, though she figured he’d somehow deduced her lower marks on her French exam. It was a pity the tutoring hadn’t helped more. “What about yours?”
Sherlock ran through the possibilities quickly. Girlfriend—there hadn’t been one in weeks. Work—he’d already said no on that. Shopping—the kitchen had looked well stocked enough this morning. Hmm…friends? He hadn’t been out with anyone recently…hadn’t said anything either.
He headed to the stairs in favor of not having to look at John any further. Not give away the fact that he was
John nodded and set to it, somewhat relieved to be able to stare at his screen for a moment rather than at the two ridiculous people in front of him.
“Adopted,” Donovan clarified. “The Holmes’ family decided to take her in when her father died. Violet Holmes was an old friend of his. And then the Holmes parents died too. I swear, they’re cursed or something. Death just follows them everywhere.”
He opened the door to find the Americans holding Mrs. Hudson. He eyed the gun to her head, and decided to continue to react slowly, for fear any quick movements might set them off. He couldn’t allow Mrs. Hudson to be harmed. He’d never forgive himself.
She hesitated. “I don’t know,” she said. “But he is. He’s clever that way. You musn’t underestimate him. He’ll try to destroy you, Sherlock Holmes.”
"What do you
“Of course,” Sherlock responded. “He has every reason to. After everything you did.”
He turned to go back over to his car and assess the damage. With any luck the deal he’d worked out last week would come through and he’d have some more cash by the end of the week. Or perhaps mummy would be home this week and he could wrangle some out of her. So far he wasn’t too concerned. But a car was a luxury. And it made his dealings outside of school easier. Sherlock’s bitchy behavior had cost him something.
Donovan stared at him for a long moment. “Lestrade, sometimes girls pick someone else. It happens. She doesn’t…owe you anything. You do realize that, right? That…that she has the right to say no?”
“He’s on his way. Have you found anything?”
John swallowed, thinking about Irene Adler and his certainty that she was behind everything that was happening right now.
“That’s her.”
Instead she smiled and said, "One," before nodding to a car pulling up in front of the flat.
She banished the thought, not eager to dwell on it. It was Christmas, she should be a bit more cheery she supposed. She had her plans made. Kate would live. But perhaps death would be kinder than…
“Excuse me,” he said.
"Hello Irene, darling," Moriarty purred. "Did you miss me?"
“You’re not afraid of me, are you?” Watson asked, before Sherlock could say a deduction that was coming to mind.
. The disgusting pig deserved to know that he wouldn’t sit idle after seeing Mrs. Hudson injured, or his best friend threatened.
“So, good work on the information,” Irene said with a sigh, flopping down in another chair. “However, I actually have some news I’d be willing to impart to you…provided I’m given compensation.”
That was true. She had said that. And he was a fool to forget it.
“Oh my god, you don’t even know what you did,” she guffawed. “Some boyfriend you are. Can’t even moan the right name, you bloody bastard. Get out!”
“Oh and somebody loves you,” Irene purred, batting her eyelashes at the both of them.
“Sherlock,” John called with a sigh. Did he have to choose now to bloody wander off? They needed to have this talk. It’d been long overdue.
He headed down the stairs, relaxing only slightly when the door closed behind him, and he could finally get the sound of violin out of his ears. Until he realized John was playing loud enough he could hear it even through the bloody window. Ridiculous instrument. Why would anyone invent such a horrid thing?
John almost tripped as he moved towards the bed, gathering his bearings as he pushed Sherlock forward. He watched in a mixture of amusement and arousal as the detective fell onto the bed, arms still wide as he beckoned John to come lie down with him. John felt himself harden just at the sight of Sherlock stretched out on the bed.
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, listening as Irene stated her case. He knew the facts already, even if Mycroft was still in denial. Irene had been thorough. She’d made her game perfect. Every so often he gave Mycroft some help in why the plan was unbeatable. He could hear his brother growing more and more disgruntled by the minute.
“It was a terrible party,” Mrs. Hudson said with a sigh as she went to start picking up glasses.
He pushed past Moriarty who was still leering at Sherlock. He headed outside, still keeping a tight grip on Sherlock. It was a bit awkward with how tall he was, but John managed.
Until next time!
“I said I’d give them to you when I knew what they were. And I’m afraid I don’t quite have that aspect figured out,” Irene said. “And besides, we both know you prefer him alive anyways. What fun is a world without Sherlock for a man like you?”
John startled, unable to help it. He gazed back at Sherlock who hadn’t so much as flinched. He stared at her unblinking, eyes never wavering from hers. Was this consent? Was he implying he wanted such things? Surely Sherlock, Mr. Tell-Everyone-My-Opinion would very clearly decline if he wanted to.
“In fact you’re seeing him this very night and giving him a gift.”
However, the moment his mouth moved away, Sherlock let out a cry.
Sherlock frowned and stared at it. So he had been right, she hadn’t gotten ahold of his phone. But then, how had she done it? Her cleverness was apparently boundless if she could find a way to change his ringtone without even being near him.
And when the man’s head was lolling to the side, he finally pulled off the tape and dragged him to the window, and without a second thought, pushed him through, listening in satisfaction as the body made contact with some of the bins below.
Sherlock let out a groan even as he threw his head back.
John shifted a bit under his stare, and finally settled in his chair. Satisfied that he’d efficiently stopped the conversation, Sherlock turned back to the window and continued to play. His eyes caught his own reflection in the glass, and he recognized how good it was he’d turned when he had. A single tear was glistening in the corner of his eye.
Ah, so that was it. John frowned. Of course, Sherlock would be disappointed she was going to be gone soon. Upset that the one woman he'd cared for wasn't a possible person for him to love.
“Well, whatever it is, I hope you figure out a way to fix it.”
He wondered for a moment if Mrs. Hudson might again try to mention their relationship as though they were actually dating. Her mistake seemed to be a continuing one after all.
Kate raised an eyebrow. "Screwing as many people as you can get your hands on? Why on earth not?"
“You look troubled,” she noted as he slid into the car.
And while he’d driven me up the wall, there were qualities about him I couldn’t help but find admirable. Bloody hell it sounds stupid, but it’s true.
“Don’t,” John said, some of the warmth leaving his face, eyes hardening. “Don’t you dare lie to me. Now, tell me the truth.”
He was grabbed by Donovan who looked him over with a furrowed brow.
“Sherlock I…”
“I…” John hesitated a moment, looked at the floor as one of his hands ran through his hair. “I just…wanted to make sure she told you…so you weren’t so depressed. I thought if I went with what she was asking maybe things would work out all right. So in the moment I just sort of…lied…I’m really sorry if it offended you or anything of the like, but I had to make sure you knew and I was just so angry with her…”
“Yeah,” John agreed with a grin. “Yeah sure.”
If you’re expecting a quick entry into Johnlock…it should be obvious by now I’m going to draw it out a bit like Irene will. I almost jumped a significant amount, but looked through timelines and figured out the Woman case takes place in September so there’s a long chunk before Irene is pronounced “dead” on Christmas eve. Obviously this won’t all be canon, but I’m going to stick with some of the basics in that.
He sighed and walked away without another word. Honestly, there was no talking to her when she was in such a mood.
“I don’t really think Sherlock would…well be interested in someone like him anyways…” Lestrade said.
At first the consulting detective had simply been lethargic and dazed, nearly passing out once or twice. He’d seemed a bit out of it. Then, of course, he began to babble.
Irene took the phone, still maintaining her smirk. John stared at her fixedly, watching as she typed something in, only for the phone to buzz. Her expression didn’t change a bit.
“No,” she said with a shake of her head. “Now I’ve got a novel to finish. You’ll find all the information you need on that paper.”
Just five more seconds of distraction, before she pressed a button on her phone and a small explosive went off, knocking more than one of them off their feet. She pulled the gun up quickly, steadied it and shot at each of them.
John scowled but did stand up.
"I…I thought I'd practically assaulted you," Sherlock murmured. "When you said you didn't remember the next morning…I thought…" He broke off, voice coming out choked. "All this time I could have been with you, and I didn't even know it."
By the time he was done, he was smiling even more as he walked away from the table, wondering if tomorrow the naked corpse would be painted over or if they’d simply have to remove the table all together.
The dream dissolved into sensuality after that, and I woke with the evidence of that quite clearly displayed across my sheets. Having wet dreams like a pubescent boy, oh jolly good. Things I hadn’t missed getting older.
“She wants it back though,” John suggested.
He did not relish the thought of her being here. Anything could happen at an event like this. And Molly lacked the traditional Holmes’s cleverness.
“What the
“I might be,” Molly said.
Lestrade was silent for a long moment and then he smiled.
“I’m so sorry!” I stammered. “Um—can I help?”
“Sherlock, so help me if you are joking I will take you back up to the roof of that bloody hospital and push you off myself you arrogant bleeding p—”
John glanced around. He couldn’t mean Shannon could he? Pretending to have her jewels stolen seemed a bit odd.
Irene elbowed him once in the middle of the performance and he was forced to glance back at what was happening in the choreography, but it was very difficult to keep his eyes off of John Watson.
She settled back in the armchair, eyes on the light of the fire, watching it crackle and burn. So domestic and simple. As a child, perhaps she'd thought this might be life. The images her parents had tried to instill into her as a matter of principle. But she would never have chosen it on her own.
“Just fifteen minutes,” he whispered. “Got to keep you alive. It’ll be all right.” He paused for a moment, readying himself for what came next. “I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
My mouth opened and closed a few times, but I had no words left.
“Leach, Shannon Leach,” she said.
Her eyes watered. “Are you expecting me to beg?”
I was cut off by his mouth pushing insistently to mine, nose knocking briefly before he found a more comfortable angle. I didn’t protest this time as his tongue snaked its way inside. While kissing another bloke was different, it didn’t feel wrong. Especially when I knew who this was, that this was the man who had managed to somehow ensnare my affections after all this time.
He walked to the door, closing his eyes for only a moment to steady himself. God, could this day be real? To think he’d had Sherlock there before him for once…like in all his fantasies and dreams. And yet to have him slip away in the end. Just like he’d always known he would.
“Okay, okay yes that’s a fair point.”
Oh, no-no-no-no-no, we’re fine. No, it’s the, uh, it’s the burglar. He’s got himself rather badly injured.”
“Hello? Sherlock?”
“What?” he asked. “Something wrong?”
“Well, that’s none of my concern,” Watson said. “Moriarty can shag what he likes. I’m not messing with him.”
His attention was drawn back to Sherlock who apparently was still semi-coherent. He was trying to get up, likely to hurt himself at that rate. John hastened over to keep him down, even as he realized looking up again, that Irene Adler had just made a very thorough and perfect escape.
He had to keep himself from recoiling. Donovan’s hand tightened on his arm, and Lestrade did his best to simply nod and keep his face from showing his horror.
Donovan shrugged. “The boys at the school are idiots. And most of the girls aren’t the least bit interested.”
“A danger kink?” Molly joked. “Unlikely. But if you’re so confident you can find it…”
. She swallowed, watching as he pressed the enter button. And for once the phone opened up to display its menu.
After time in war, and time solving murders, a dead body should be so commonplace. But this—this was different.
"I'm only…only enquiring before we go any further," Sherlock said, chest rising and falling rapidly. "We might want to…be prepared."
“Sounds lovely,” Irene said with a bat of her eyelashes.
"What?"
“Piss off is the term I’ve heard most often,” she said with a fake smile. “You might want to work on that.”
“You’re not too bad of a guy, Lestrade. You know that?”
She stared at him for a long moment while John tried to decide what to say. He couldn't think of any words. He'd said the most important ones. If Irene cared she didn't give any sign of that. She simply wanted to rub her hold on Sherlock in his face.
“He’s our guy,” Lestrade said. “I mean…at least let’s hope he’s gay. But if so then we’re golden.”
John suddenly was grabbing him, pulling him back onto the bed. Those firm hands on his chest felt undeniably good. And it was then that Sherlock began to be aware of the steadily growing heat within him, the warmth curling in his belly, body reacting to unknown stimuli.
“Good,” John said with a smile.
“If you’re feeling kind, lock her up; otherwise let her go. I doubt she’ll survive long without her protection.”
“Er…right…anytime…I mean…you’re welcome.” He pulled away before it could become any more awkward. “Right, I’m off.”
As he called my name, I couldn’t stop myself from leaning up and gently pressing my lips to his, only momentarily before I collapsed back to the ground, vision fading completely out as Mary appeared beside him as well. If he was reacting, I couldn’t tell. I lost consciousness before anything else could happen.
“I can’t believe John is so blind to the way Sherlock looks at him,” Kate huffed before reaching out to smooth Irene’s hair before reaching for a comb.
!" John snarled.
Sherlock ignored him and turned his attention to the doorway, where he suddenly noticed movement. A family stood there while a doctor delivered what had to be bad news. They crowded together in a huddling mass, shaking with what had to be sobs. Sherlock’s first instinct was to react with disgust, but after a moment, he realized he was feeling some level of sympathy.
Donovan stared at him for a long moment. “And people wonder why I’m interested in women.” She strode down the hallway towards their next class. “And I thought your intentions for Molly were all good and pure?”
“Mmm yes. And it gave me a chance to slip the cameras in too,” Irene said, licking her lips as she stared at her computer screen, admiring the various angles of the flat, the possibilities of all the dirty things she could catch for her viewing pleasure.
“I’m sorry,” John offered. “I know he’s awful sometimes. He just takes a bit to get used to. He’ll come round, don’t you worry.”
She frowned and studied it. A trick? Did she dare respond?
She climbed back into bed, curling up around Kate, and sighing as she felt her partner relax into her embrace. Irene whispered a few soft nothings into Kate’s ear before kissing her cheek.
“We know you’re in there, Miss Adler,” an American accented voice floated through the door. “You open this or we break it open.”
“Where do you get that idea?” Sherlock called back over his shoulder.
Lestrade grunted but seemed to be satisfied with his answer and left it alone.
“Good day?” she asked, trying her best to keep her tone light and casual.
She had brought a blanket and had spread it out. She was currently lying on her stomach, looking down at a book. Lestrade ran a hand through his hair and walked over.
Sherlock groaned above him, hips bucking ever so slightly.
“Sure,” John said. “What’d you have in mind?”
Molly smiled and shut her book before standing up. “Well lucky for you, Sherlock is at dance class until five o’clock. Should be plenty of time to rummage through his room.”
John felt his face heating again. “You texted me. What do you need?”
“Why?” he asked, still trying and failing to draw himself out of his thoughts on John. After all the time he’d spent following Molly’s advice he’d finally had his chance. And of course, it had to be in Irene Adler’s hands. Not because John wanted to. But because he felt he had to.
John expected him to go sit in his chair, but he didn't.
“No, I don’t believe I will.”
He gasped as pleasure overwhelmed him. As his body went lax, he heard footsteps again. Groaning he shifted to clean himself some, closing his eyes and trying to steady his breath as the door opened again. John stood there a moment. Sherlock did his best to imitate sleep. To ease himself back into something of a relaxed state.
She smiled. “Ultimatum yes, leaving you…well that depends. I’m telling you I want you to consider things before you actually pop the question…and yes I expect you to do it properly. I know how important tonight was to you, and I don’t mind you finding some other nice way to do it.”
Even with the forced smile, for a moment he was slightly fooled. “Oh…thank you. So why don’t…” he broke off staring as he saw the phone coming out of Sherlock’s jacket pocket, holding it up to examine it closely before showing it to Irene.
He tried again to think back to Christmas Eve. Everything was fuzzy. He had some vague recollections of the party, and Sherlock being an arse especially to Molly. He knew Irene Adler had been found dead, and he'd broken up with Jeanette due to his need to stay with Sherlock due to it being a danger night.
“Somewhere,” Sherlock said. He folded his hands and stared down at them, not wanting to speak the specifics of where he’d found such advice.
Molly walked over and plopped herself down into a chair.
“I just upped my price.”
“Who’s that?” he asked.
Sherlock nodded. Smarter than trying to navigate stairs. He sat up some, doing his best to push most of John’s body weight off of himself. He managed to get John to stand up, though he was swaying on his feet, eyes fluttering open and closed.
“So you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them,” Sherlock speculated.
Sherlock glanced at him. Eyed him. Took in the way his face looked drawn now. The way his hand curled tight around the glass.
Maybe that would get Sherlock. Sherlock liked solving problems. John felt a bit of hope as he glanced at the detective and then back at the blog.
Sherlock groaned and twisted, trying to make sense of what was happening. He hadn’t felt like this since he was a teenager, since hormones he couldn’t control had run rampant through his body. But now, as an adult, it had been years since he’d felt anything like this.
“I believe you have something that we want, Mr Holmes.”
Lestrade nodded emphatically. “True, true. But…I’m sure there are girls who’d be into that. After all, there’s this moody vampire thing that’s so popular amongst a lot of teenagers. How far off could your sulky older brother be?”
John bobbed his head a bit, swirling his tongue. One of Sherlock’s hands came down to touch the back of his head, those long violinist’s fingers twirling into his hair, pulling him closer. Sherlock’s eyes had closed and his head was thrown back. The noises coming from him were intoxicating. God, did this man have any idea how sexy he was?
"Yes?"
He closed his eyes for a moment and let the memory wash over him.
He jerked up and looked towards Sherlock, who again pulled his phone out to look at it before putting it away. Mrs. Hudson saw fit to comment on how “rude” it was, but Sherlock still offered no defense.
She gave a very false looking smile. John sighed and stepped into the kitchen, Mrs. Hudson following behind him worriedly.
I suddenly reached into my jacket pocket and retrieved what Mary had stuck there. Sure enough, I wasn’t altogether surprised to see condoms. Well, with Sherlock being such an
“Just something about his girlfriend again,” Sherlock muttered. “I suspect he’s merely sexually frustrated and taking it out on me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are they dead?” Kate asked studying their still forms.
“Now, we put our next move to work,” Irene said over her shoulder, busy at her vanity putting on a fresh bit of makeup. Kate watched as she expertly added a perfect line around the rim of her eyes. Sometimes it felt like there was nothing Irene wasn’t good at. Now if only she could speed up the little game they were playing on Holmes and Watson.
“He’s good isn’t he?” Irene added at one point. “I would have on a leash. In fact, I might.”
“There you are, brother. I hope the contents make up for any inconvenience I may have caused you tonight,” he said.
He glanced around calculating what had been moved. Something was off. Things had been put back into place clumsily, as though it had been done in a great hurry.
Getting lots of great feedback/follows/favorites so I’m feeling a push to get more chapters out...even as I feel a bit intimidated by the number of people reading this! Eek.
“It doesn’t matter anyways,” she said. “I just want Greg happy. If Molly Hooper does that then so be it.”
“I miscalculated,” he muttered. “It must be.”
There was a pause, but Sherlock quickly filled it with accusations about the CIA killers. John looked down at his food again, brow furrowed as he tried to not think about the noise. Just his luck of course, it came again.
Sherlock’s gaze fixed on him. “I’ll get a few things I want. I guarantee it. As to what she wants…well we’ll see how that works. I’ll do what’s necessary in the long run.”
John tried to regain his focus as he continued in his pursuit, breath coming shorter as he approached his climax. He groaned loudly and finished, pleased when Cindi gave a gasping moan as well. Good, he’d done his job properly then.
"I love you, John," Sherlock whispered.
The two of them were staring at each other, eyes never breaking contact. John looked back and forth between the two, feeling like he was only catching half the conversation.
“Hmm,” Ms. Perky said. “The point is, Sherlock…that many people seem to think your opinions are…well…they believe it might be better if you…”
She paused and glance up again, head tilted slightly as she regarded him. John's mouth kept opening and closing.
“You ought to just wank and move on,” Donovan muttered. “It won’t happen.”
He watched as the other boy swayed his hips to the beat before heading towards the store. Sherlock’s jaw clenched.
“Hamish,” he said.
“And what about this?” Sherlock is leaning over me, close, so close, foreheads almost touching. However, it’s the target of his hand that’s my real worry. I draw in a sharp gasp as he finds new evidence for what he wants to prove, smirking at what he finds there.
“Molly, I have something to tell you,” he hissed.
“And the compensation?” Sherlock asked.
Irene sighed and let her head fall back. She kept picturing Holmes and Watson, but in the process she couldn’t deny adding Kate to the fantasy too. She’d be back with her darling one day. When all this nonsense was over.
“So, she’s alive then. How are we feeling about that?” John asked.
“Perhaps,” he said. His eyebrows quirked as he stepped closer, still staring at me intensely. In many ways it felt like I’d forgotten some of these minute details about him, but they were coming back in an instant. Every bit of him seemed so real and lifelike.
“You think Sherlock is stupid?” Sally asked.
He was about to say he was going to leave if she had nothing else to say, when suddenly a female sigh broke out behind them.
Perhaps it was meant to conjure images of Irene. But all he could think of was John.
“Mind letting me talk for a minute?” the girl asked, crossing her arms as she stared at him.
I couldn’t focus on anything. Sherlock would arrogantly state something about being alive. Mary kept saying these things that reminded me why I’d fallen in love with her.
So she needed to ready herself then. Best to have what bits and pieces she wanted to give him ready. And if she was lucky, maybe Sherlock would even help her disappear after, so that Moriarty’s wrath couldn’t follow her anymore. But that was wishful thinking she supposed.
“Can’t. Wait.” Sherlock pressed the end call button and slid a hand over his forehead. He looked back up in time to see Watson still staring at him. With a sigh he hopped out of his car and walked back towards the book store. Well, while he waited for Mycroft to figure out a way out of this situation, he’d simply peruse a few more volumes he’d skipped earlier.
"Thank God for the consulting detective," Kate said with a grin.
She knew it was necessary. Moriarty and the CIA were both closing in. Neither would care about Kate really. Not so long as Irene wasn’t with her…not so long as Irene was…
“And you should
“And will you give it to her?”
“Ooo, please say Sherlock is jumping his bones after his wanking section!” Kate jerked her head, trying to see behind her.
I always reckoned someone like me would be used to death by now.
“I know enough to know that he’s the one,” Lestrade said.
Thankfully by the time he opened his eyes they were pulling up to St. Bart’s. He paid the cabby and stepped out, striding towards the building with obvious purpose.
“I mean…if we…paid him or something?” Lestrade suddenly said. “Could be motivation right? He’s…not really very posh looking. Gotta need some money, right?”
I visited his grave on the recommendation of my therapist. An attempt to reconcile some of the grief, make up for my lack of real goodbyes. So I did, and I stammered to the harsh black stone about how I didn’t want him to be gone. Cor, I was near tears by the end again. But I held back, voice choked as I managed to find my words.
“Well, first off I had no idea someone like you could go for someone like little old me,” Kate purred. “And besides, it was before you converted me.”
"Veronica will take you back," Irene said. "I'm sorry we couldn't work things out. Such a pity. Regardless, it's been a pleasure. Happy New Year, Doctor Watson."
“Oh, Mrs Hudson, my god. Are you all right?” John asked as he rushed over to see to her. Sherlock glanced at John out of the corner of his eye, admiring the way the man fussed over their landlady. Something about John’s concern made him all the more appealing. That was John…so
Eyes narrowing, Sherlock tried his suspected email address and password combination only to have an error box pop up.
His train of thought was interrupted by the sight of Jim Moriarty stalking towards him, a malicious looking smile on his face. John straightened, his fingers twitching towards his pocket, picturing them curled around his knife.
Not gay. Not gay. John tried to repeat those things to himself over and over again as he made his way back towards the stairs.
He frowned, but again his thoughts ran to the events a few hours earlier. John’s mouth. The intoxicating heat. The soft kisses ranging from affectionate to sensual. That mark that still was uncomfortable on the side of his neck. Why, he’d give anything to do it all again.
Her head snapped up as she looked towards the door.
“Oh dear lord Dimmock, you’re really that afraid of him?” Donovan asked, raising her eyebrows.
She did her best to keep her tone steady, even as she felt some level of despair start sinking in. She truly didn’t know if that would do her any good. Sherlock might turn out exactly like Mycroft and never find anyone.
“It wasn’t real,” she whispered desperately. “It was all a game.”
Donovan sighed as she pushed the scalpel a little deeper. “Did I or did I not say that no one would go out with him?” she said with a frown.
"Will you have me then, mistress? As a sign of my forgiveness?"
Sherlock wondered if he should find a reply but finally thought better of it. He wasn’t really in the mood to talk, especially with John.
“Downstairs,” he said. “Take her downstairs and look after her.”
“I don’t know who you’ve been talking to, but Sherlock and I were not a couple. I’m not gay, Mary!”
“Yes, that’s the one. He fixed it up for me. It was perfect. I knew those little features he gave me would come in handy.”
"God, you're so…so perfect," he managed to gasp.
“Pleasure doing business with you,” he muttered, before turning and heading in the direction of the dance group.
?” she chuckled. “Oh by all means, Mr. Holmes, keep pretending you’re so clever. But as I said already, you’re a novice when it comes to love. I wouldn’t expect you to understand the signs.”
Watson himself was actually quite easy to deduce. A glance over him was enough to confirm the ridiculous rumors of his classmates were false. It didn’t take long to have him completely unraveled. All his secrets. All his mystery.
“Yeah I’d noticed he’s a little…antisocial. Er…do you know why that is?”
Sherlock had to maintain strong concentration to not flinch.
Irene stiffened. “I’ve been a bit busy. Had some American chaps coming down on me, I’m afraid. But I am getting to it.”
John sighed and bared his neck again. Sherlock leaned in, lips brushing soft skin on John’s collarbone. His tongue peeked between his teeth, tempting him to taste the offered flesh, but he knew that would be going too far. Instead, he leaned in and placed his lips on the spot offered. He pressed the phone into John’s hands, realizing John might have a better angle for the whole thing. A soft noise escaped the doctor’s mouth, but thankfully there was a snap from his phone, and he knew the picture was over.
Mycroft’s eyes were on him. He knew that there was nothing he could do. Not now at least. But back at home…after he’d sorted it all with John, maybe.
“Was that your phone?” he asked.
“I’m still not,” Kate said. “I’ll have you remember I’m bisexual, hence why I want to watch those two boys shag so badly. Not all of us like to make things as complicated as you in our sexual labels.”
What very few knew about Irene, was she had an intense interest in gay men. While a man at her control was interesting, she grew weak at the knees watching two men submit to one another. There was such a fascinating power dynamic, and it worked so well. Kate was well aware of this of course, often finding her gay erotica in her spare time.
“Did you, darling?” Irene said with a smirk, reaching up to rub one of her eyes. “And how did it go.”
“Yes?” he said, spinning around, doing his best to keep his expression neutral.
I rose to my feet, unable to remain seated, unable to sit there while this man stood in front of me with laughter in his expression, not understanding one bit all the pain and hurt and confusion he’d caused me for all those months the bloody bastard. He was going on about how funny it was and how he “wasn’t dead.” Obviously, Sherlock.
he felt more and more uncomfortable.
“Hello,” she tried, putting on a casual smile. “Enjoying the party?”
He stumbled back, stunned.
John sighed and downed another swallow of beer, leaning an elbow against the bar.
, he thought to himself before taking it in his hand.
As he helped himself to a drink, he couldn’t help but reflect on the past few months. They’d felt like eternity.
Donovan jumped in. “We set Moriarty onto the whole thing. You see, Lestrade here likes Molly Hooper.”
Her eyes settled on the package neatly hidden amongst Kate’s garments. If she hadn’t been looking for that key she’d hidden weeks ago, she probably would never have seen it. But there it was. Confirmation of how few days she had left. Kate would never realize what a burden such a small thing could be.
John nodded, agreeing that he too was almost finished. There was a pang of regret at not keeping the pleasure going longer. But he knew there would be much more of this in the future. The thought warmed him considerably.
“Yes,” he said, still eyeing whatever was there.
“No.”
She came to sit down again, though this time she laid her hand on John’s thigh. He couldn’t say he minded.
After all, he enjoyed breaking pretty things. He always had. And if it was a pretty thing that might hurt Sherlock, all the better.
“Is this…an ultimatum? Am…are you leaving me?”
“Sherlock Holmes…a  junkie?” Lestrade said. He did his best to not let his jaw drop right open.
“Fine,” Sherlock managed.
Irene smirked. “Oh we did. I can give you all those details later. For now, however, I want my own. Who asked you out? And what did you say?”
In the meantime something to occupy his attention. Sherlock shifted in his seat, but his interest was piqued by the multiple listings of porn sites. What he’d told John probably held true to himself as well. Sexual frustration was bothersome…especially considering he hadn’t experienced it much before. So perhaps…
All he had to do was imagine John descending a bit lower, John’s mouth touching him, John—oh John, John, John…
Feeling even more uncomfortable, John made the suggestion of putting something on, laughing to attempt to cover up his confusion.
jump to his death.
“I don’t mean physically…well not solely. I mean…romantically. I love you, Sherlock. I want to be with you. I want to be yours I want you to be mine.”
"Some lotion that has served its purpose for the occasional session of masturbation," Sherlock said. "But I certainly don't keep condoms. I've never really had a use for them other than the possible odd experiment."
“Are you okay?” he whispered, unsure if he should even bring anything about the kiss up. Sherlock’s face appeared drawn. He had looked fairly moody all evening, but this…this was a different expression, one John couldn’t quite define.
“What about?” I muttered. I came over and sat down on my side. She got up and moved so she could be a bit closer. I wrapped an arm around her.
She winced and paused, looking to where he was folding the paper and turning around with a frown.
John chuckled and leaned over to plant a few more kisses before snuggling up against Sherlock's chest.
“Your brother truly detests me,” she whispered.
"You have any ideas?" he asked, studying her. God there were hundreds running through his head, but he was hoping she might just give him a few more of her own.
The two chatted while he stood there feeling awkward, unsure what to really do. He couldn’t focus on their conversation, until something Irene said caught his attention
(See the end of the chapter for
“Couldn’t hurt, right?”
By the time he arrived at 221 B John was thoroughly ready to be done. He didn’t want to deal with cases or listen to that bloody phone anymore. He just wanted to find a way to get over the fact that he liked his flatmate, admit it and move on because there was no possibility of anything happening anyways. Or at least he assumed there wasn’t. Sherlock had made his lack of interest quite clear.
“Suppose not,” he said with a smirk. “But you know it won’t do the least bit of good to try to say something Sherlock. No one will believe you,” he said the last bit in sing song.
However, Sherlock’s brief consideration of the facts was interrupted as he noticed something alarming. His eyes caught on the door where there were obvious signs someone had forced it open. A scowl crossed his face as he pushed the door open, scanning for other signs and quickly finding ones that alarmed him.
Her heart ached, and for a moment she closed her eyes and her only thought was that it could all go away in an instant. There were choices she could make that would guarantee that.
“No,” Sherlock said, glaring at him. “That was your decision, not mine. I wish to continue dancing. And I will if I want.”
It was difficult to speak, but Sherlock swallowed and nodded. “I…I’ll stop,” he agreed.”
“There’s no one crazy enough to date Sherlock Holmes,” Donovan said. “Even the ones who are loony enough still weren’t interested in dating him…just…” she tilted her head and sighed. “Well you get the idea.”
“One of the things he liked was showing off. He told me this email was going to save the world. He didn’t know it, but I photographed it.” She passed the phone over to Sherlock, nodding to whatever was on the screen. “He was a bit tied up at the time. It’s a bit small on that screen – can you read it?”
“You.”
Sherlock didn’t respond.
If she’d been trying to get her claws into him, that he might have understood. But he’d been home alone in bed. And what had she whispered to him when putting his coat in his room? Something about John. He was almost certain of it. But again, that was absolute nonsense. There was no reason for the woman to talk about John. She hadn’t appeared the least bit interested in him. Her attention had been focused on Sherlock instead.
His mood was poor enough he was tempted to comment on how pathetic a remark it was. John’s lack of basic reasoning sometimes… but still…this was the man he’d fallen for. And Sherlock didn’t have the heart to see a look of hurt on his face right now.
“How do you feel about blowjobs, Dr. Watson?”
He passed the phone over and John looked at it, eyes widening again. He cursed under his breath, then handed the phone back over.
“What did you give him?”
John moved over to the couch, sitting down beside Sherlock and pulling at the neck of his jumper. Sherlock frowned and reached for his phone, turning on the camera before adjusting the angle to fit both of them in.
“One day,” she murmured, turning to look at the feed that she had continued to watch. Nothing of interest had happened, but still, seeing Sherlock and John in their daily lives was interesting. Like watching two animals in their natural habitats….
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Lestrade said, unable to keep himself from coughing to keep himself from saying anything rash. Not when this crazy had a needle ready to be used on some kind of nasty drugs.
Sherlock was looking at his phone. He frowned and then looked up at John.
"Just reflecting how life will go now," Irene said with a sigh, looking back at the fire before she could start staring at Kate dressed in that silky dressing gown Irene had given her three years ago for her birthday. It had always made her look lovely, that dark blue shimmery fabric. Irene felt warmth settle in her belly at the thought of Kate's soft pale curves beneath the garment. What she wouldn't give to see them again.
“Flight double oh seven?” John said.
He opened one of the links. The first things he found were some videos with very busty women, but he soon found another on the site with two men that looked slightly more appealing. Of course, as he began watching, Sherlock couldn’t deny that nothing was taking him to the same level as his own self-pleasure thinking of John. Still, he watched a bit longer, wondering if perhaps he should try stimulating himself.
“Hello,” she purred.
“So you’ve shaved it off then.”
If you enjoyed please comment! :)
“Good girl,” Irene said with a heady sigh. She closed her eyes momentarily, readying herself with those clearly laid out plans. A few surprised would be good for Kate, but she’d give some of the major details. There were so many delicious options. So many endless possibilities.
Watson eyed them for a moment, looking a bit confused. “So…you two are going to help me get the codes for the machine. Make Sherlock learn to like me.”
Lestrade sighed. “Is there anything else we can do? We really need all the help we can get. Nothing else is working. We’ve got to…get behind enemy lines so to speak.”
Molly assured him her place was close enough to walk, so he led his bike on foot, following after her.
But after that…
“Come here, I think we should have a chat.” She patted the bed.
“Oh get on with it you bastard,” I muttered.
Irene glanced away from the screen and turned her attention back onto the woman on her bed. She was just about to suggest moving from flogging to something else when a noise caught her attention.
“John Hamish Watson,” he eventually muttered. “Just if you were looking for baby names.”
“I suppose you think you’ve won then,” Mycroft said. “Ruining our plot.”
I remembered very little of the whole thing, just being knocked out on my way to Baker street and then waking up buried beneath a pile of wood, screaming for help, smoke suddenly coming in. Heat was rising, the crackling flames nearing. The end of John Watson had come.
“You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you’ve worked for ...”
Mrs. Hudson frowned. “Sherlock, you can think what you like about literature, but there is no denying it has an affect on the world around us. Why without writing you would never have been able to catalogue our understanding of science. If you’d be quiet you might actually learn something.”
His attention was still diverted to Mrs. Hudson, especially the realization that the men had hurt her in the process of interrogation. She wasn’t only crying out of fear. God, he could hardly stand the thought of it. His blood was beginning to boil the longer he stood there.
"You seen Sherlock?" he asked.
“Someone…with money…and motive.”
“Holmes is gay, we’ve established that. For a while it seemed like Adler had her sights on him, but she’s backed off on all that. She turned up naked in a class one day.”
“Doubly orphaned?” Lestrade asked with a frown. “Are they in foster care or something?”
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
I had some really great feedback and am feeling inspired to keep going so far. Please keep up the comments if you're enjoying this! Positivity from my readers truly makes or breaks a fic for me. Anyhow, thanks again to all of you! Hope you enjoyed this chapter!
He opened his mouth to answer, only to hear Mrs. Hudson’s voice on the stairs.
After what felt like eternity, Shannon rose from her seat, thanked John and grabbed her coat. He smiled at her, eyes warm. Sherlock’s jaw clenched involuntarily, becoming even tighter when John leaned over to kiss Shannon, long and passionate and far too intimate for Sherlock’s liking.
His eyebrows furrowed. “What?”
It felt like his heart had stopped beating. John blinked a few times and took a step back, trying to ground himself in reality. Was this another of his dreams? Would Sherlock pull his shirt off in the next minute and demand they have sex? Because that sure would confirm it. No, this couldn't possibly be real.
I mean—really if not for Sherlock I’d never have met Mary. Funny how that works out now, isn’t it?
, John thought, but he didn’t say it.
“It would help if you were a tiny bit more specific,” John muttered, doing his best to not simply lose his temper. Here they were helping her, and she wasn’t even being straightforward with them.
She seemed to overlook the biting remarks. “The way you expressed your opinion to Henry Knight? By the way, his therapy is going quite well if you were curious.”
“Don’t make jokes Molly,” Sherlock muttered, creating even more tension in the room. John sighed and took another gulp of his drink. He’d need to get another soon at this rate.
Irene’s blue eyes slid over Sally’s figure and she smiled suddenly.
Feedback, if you have any, is always great. I don’t have a lot set in stone as of yet, so suggestions are also welcome if you have any fun ideas.
“Tell him what you want,” Irene said. “Beg prettily and maybe he’ll have some mercy.”
Sherlock was to his feet in a heartbeat, strolling over, gaze never leaving.
“I want twice what you gave me. Per date. In advance.”
He stared at Irene’s text, trying to figure out what she’d done to suddenly change her text alert sound. He hadn’t let his phone out of his sight once.
Did she have to go into dirty details about all of her conquests? John wrinkled his nose at the thought. Why men enjoyed that sort of thing was beyond him. Though for some reason that sent an image of Sherlock bound to the bed naked, and he had to quickly dismiss the thought before he got himself into real trouble. He could picture Irene leering at him and his hard on. God, better to just sit tight and not think right now.
“Quite true,” Irene agreed. “Now, what’s your plan with your sister?”
Oh god. Irene. Her weird fetish with having Sherlock touch him and…he thought back to the kiss in her house and the love bite a month later.
“God, John,” Sherlock breathed.
Sherlock had trailed off for some reason. John frowned, but couldn’t make out why that was. Molly in the meantime looked near tears.
, rang through my head again and again.
Sally sighed and kept walking. “You see?”
“Do you want me to go tell John?” Mrs. Hudson asked.
Unable to restrain a heady sigh, Irene turned back to Kate, deciding it was time to get ready.
“Of course,” John said, trying his best to be understanding since Sherlock had been so rude. “So, you got home. Locked the door. First thing you did?”
"I agree," Mycroft frowned. "That's why I decided to tell him that."
"Hardly," Sherlock snorted. "I believe that would be me."
He turned to Watson once more.
"Please, he's been unusually happy as of late. And you have a bruise on your neck with no girlfriend's to speak of."
Sherlock sighed. It made them three of a kind. None of them caring all that much about Christmas. Not like John about to go spend the night with his new girlfriend, or Lestrade going to try to reconcile things with his wife or Mrs. Hudson who was at least going to call her sister or maybe going to have a bite to eat with Mrs. Turner. No, he and Molly, and Mycroft were all loners. All left to fend for themselves in the merriness of the holidays.
"What the hell are you even saying?" John asked.
“Lestrade. We’ve had a break-in at Baker Street. Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance.”
He pouted into the mirror before turning to fix her with a stare.
“I just…wanted to talk to you,” he said with an uneasy smile. “You know… just… it’s kind of why I came.”
Regardless all of those didn't suit John's desires. He wanted Sherlock for himself.. But at the same time he knew in a moment that some things came at a price. And to buy Sherlock's happiness he would sacrifice his own.
“You’re Gregory Lestrade right?” she asked.
She’d planned it out well, Irene decided. The body really was flawless. Her proportions precisely. Dark hair. All it took was a little damage to the face…a little tampering with some records and some record keepers. And she was done.
“Wait…er…sorry…what?” John stammered, trying to figure out what she’d just said.
“Don’t get jealous now,” Irene tutted. “I’m sure you’ll have some people clambering for you before too long.”
Mrs. Hudson gave a little sigh and a quick scolding before heading to the stairs. John waited until he heard her door close before speaking.
He heard the door open and quickly put out the cigarette. He slid it into the trash before returning to his seat, doing his best to act nonchalant.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock stared at it for a moment. A picture of him…he swallowed at the mere though. Could he do that? Would John let him? Would he make that noise?
“Well, I’ll be delicate then,” she said, rising and sashaying over, eyes never leaving his. “Let’s have dinner.”
His fingers worked to undo the buttons on his shirt. He thought back to earlier when he'd done this for Irene's little games. But this time it was for his own pleasure, and he couldn't deny how much faster his heart was beating as a result.
“Wait…did you just…Anderson’s party? But I haven’t heard anything…”
“And that she’s seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she’s wearing. Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts…”
“Saturday?” Molly said with a frown.
“What, don’t enjoy that sort of thing?” Sherlock asked. “Sure seem to like it when I order you around.”
The words stung for some reason. Part of it, John decided, was not understanding why the detective didn’t trust him enough to tell him the truth. The likelihood was that Irene Adler had done so at some point, that she’d returned the phone, but if that was the case why not tell John? His secretive behavior was becoming annoying, proving this
The heat in his belly had peaked. He felt a wave of pleasure wash over him as his body entered the throes of orgasm. Sherlock groaned and released into John’s hand. He felt John’s body speed up a bit and then he was moaning and going slack and Sherlock was sure he must have come in his pants.
“John Watson,” Irene Adler said. “I know.”
“Hello beautiful ladies,” he purred with a half bow.
Irene sighed and pulled her coat tighter around herself before walking back out of the room. She couldn’t linger too long. She’d simply have to go into hiding. For now. Someday she hoped she could come back to Kate. It would just take some time.
“People who want to kill me.”
However, just my luck, I was stopped from making a terrible mistake when I knocked into someone in my path to go flirt. I spilled my drink over her, wetting the entire front of her red dress.
He took Jeanette’s hand in his, trying to focus on the comfort of having her next to him. This was supposed to be a nice evening. Of course, Sherlock didn’t help but continuing to make incessant comments about each of them, telling Lestrade his wife was still sleeping with someone else.
“Love,” he said that word as though to taste it, rolling it around in his mouth as his eyebrows furrowed and his face screwed up. I suppose I wasn’t surprised it was foreign to him, but still, I had to wait patiently as he worked through it. I could practically picture the cogs in his head turning, trying to process through every conceivable meaning for that word.
“Where’s John?” Sherlock asked.
A quick trip over to her tech savvy masochist might have helped, but she already knew it was too late. Thousands had already seen the information. Removing it would do nothing.
“Sure!” Lestrade said.
Molly turned to shoot him a look. “If you hadn’t noticed I’m
, John thought to himself
"And what has you so wrapped up in your thoughts again?"
“I want to go to dance school. I want you to trust me to make my own decision. And I want you to stop trying to control my life just because you couldn’t control yours,” Sherlock said, slamming his fist into the dashboard.
Mary didn’t look altogether pleased either, eyeing Greg with a look of disdain. He shuffled a bit closer to Molly herself.
He nodded. “Good. No fun showing up if you’re not there. I’ll see you later, Molly.”
Greg stepped in, doing his best to avoid stepping on anything. It was difficult. The floor was littered with an array of items. Clothes mostly, but a few dishes and scientific instruments as well.
He let out a sigh and pulled away.
“We know what you’re trying to do,” Donovan said, raising her voice a little over the noise of the tools. “With Sherlock Holmes.”
Greg just sighed and shoved his hands into his pockets. He was tired of plans falling through. Seemed like half his life was just him being out of control of his circumstances.
Irene thought her heart might have stopped beating for real. There were so many words in her mind, yet none would work on her tongue.
“Er…” John again shifted uneasily, glad Sherlock’s deduction skills seemed to be failing him with Irene in the room. “If…well I mean…it’s Moriarty right? We could probably use a few advantages. I’d say…yes? Only if you’re game of course. Don’t want to take advantage.”
And then he looked at John again and realized that Jeanette was missing…and he knew they’d had plans. Odd. He frowned.
“About a certain old friend of yours,” Irene said. “A Mr. Moriarty.”
“No reason at all,” John said as he went out the door.
But Sherlock Holmes was intriguing for more reasons than mere reputation, or even interesting appearance. As she decided to run a search for more pictures, she found something that fascinated her even more. What truly struck Irene was his smile as he looked towards his little tagalong partner in one of their photos.
With a groan she reached over to grab it off the desk, pulling it close enough to read the name before finally answering.
“Hey, it’s all right,” Donovan said. “Come on, let’s get a drink and dance or something. There’ll be other girls.”
“Well…you were acting a bit… queer… on Christmas Eve.”
John nodded, thankful she understood. He walked out into the other room and began checking the places he’d known Sherlock to keep his stashes before. He could feel Jeanette’s eyes on him as he walked around the place. He knew she had to be thinking about their promises to have a private Christmas celebration at her place. Well, as soon as he was done with this he was going to go shag her silly and forget all about Sherlock and his bloody drug problems and his obsession with Irene Adler.
“Then I’ll have the same,” Sherlock said. “And we can split a bottle of whatever Angelo recommends.”
“And he likewise played you,” Sherlock countered. “Sentiment,” he spat out.
John froze and stared at him. "What?"
“Oh…fine. He…you were right he clearly is interested. I gave him some advice too. About being a good boyfriend.”
“Are you gonna tell me what’s going on?” John asked, brow furrowing.
“You sneaky bastard,” he muttered, cracking his eyes open. “Well, you do what you want, but let me tell you my men have orders to go after John Watson if anything happens to me.”
He shook his head and stormed past her, through with the arguing. He had nothing more to say to Miss Irene Bloody Adler with all her sensual seduction and continual teasing. How Sherlock could fall for a woman like her was beyond him.
“Is that a phone?” she asked, peering at the screen with a puzzled smile.
To make matters worse, Sherlock stalked over and settled a hand on her arm. Gray blue eyes opened to stare up at them.
She smiled. “He said you do that. You are rather fond of him, aren’t you, Mr. Holmes?”
Whatever she’d done to him it remained a mystery. He’d considered analyzing a sample of blood or urine, running a toxicology screen and seeing if there was anything he could make of it. Obviously she’d used some sort of incapacitating agent alongside what he suspected was an aphrodisiac. He couldn’t be certain of that, but based on previous experiences and his usually low libido, the evidence pointed at that. But for what purpose? Why drug him with something to increase sexual desire?
"But it's not like that with you," Sherlock said. His eyes seemed practically luminescent. John tried to remember if he'd ever seen them like that before. So full of life. So full of
Mrs. Hudson took a moment to process, but the second she did she went red in the face and let out a shriek before finally covering her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Miss Adler,” Kate said with a smirk.
His brow wrinkled, but he didn’t respond. She would have to press harder if she wanted an answer to that.
“Yes. I already was aware of that,” Sherlock said.
"Close," Sherlock panted.
But in many ways there were elements of our relationship that were beginning to make sense under a certain new context. No, I didn’t think I was going to start thinking of other men now. I really didn’t think I was a proper bender. However, my relationship with Sherlock fell into a neat context under the idea of romance—though it was terrifying to think of it that way. But after all we’d been through, our companionship together, how I couldn’t keep a girl for more than a month or two at most. I thought back to the one girl’s comments on how Sherlock was lucky to have such a devoted boyfriend. It was true; I’d been more devoted to him than to any of my supposed romantic partners.
“Well worry about yourself. You’ll strain that mind of yours overthinking everything,” he snapped. “I’m going out. I’ll be back later.”
He took an extra long swallow of his beverage before he grabbed the kettle and set about preparing a cup of tea. Once done he headed back to the sitting room, handing Mrs. Hudson the tea before settling down with his glass of wine.
“Oh do shut up, John,” Sherlock muttered. “Any specifics on the kiss?”
However, she was interrupted by Mycroft’s voice.
“Get to the point, Sherlock,” John said with a sigh.

It took a bit of effort, but with his mind still flashing to the injuries on Mrs. Hudson and the

“So the boy who convinced the school you weren’t actually selling drugs isn’t someone you’re interested in?” Donovan asked, folding her arms. “Seems like you two get along fairly well all things considered. Even if to do so he mention that you were really busy hacking into teachers accounts to correct the grades your customers received on their exams.”
He stalked over to the other side of the room, picking up the gun and pointing it at his captive. A tremor shook his hand as he thought about John…about the threat just made to the man he loved. But he couldn’t lose control. With that in mind he grabbed for his phone as well.
By now she needed a bit of everything. Sleep. Water. Food. Warmth. Perhaps a nice wash too based on her smell. There had to be another option. There had to be some way. She couldn’t give up.
“Obvious. You aren’t the only one who likes a bit of meat. Your dog was out here while you were asleep in your bedroom. You left bacon grease on the table and likely on the necklace and bills since you didn’t wash your hands. The smudges appear to be saliva. I don’t see you being willing to lick your own table, so it’s likely the dog smelled the grease and licked it up…”
She paused and put a hand on his arm, even as his mind reeled.
“No. Wait. I have it.” Sherlock walked over and typed in the numbers. He called out behind him, and John figured it just in time, ducking down even as a gun went off. Sherlock and he had little trouble subduing the men. Irene Adler was glowing by the time they were finished.
"Be honest," Sherlock said, eyes flashing. When he noticed this wasn't getting him answers he seemed to visibly soften. "Please, John. Tell me. I want the truth."
"Don't think about that now," he said. "Now…would you like to take me to bed?"
Sherlock had propped himself up on his elbows and was looking at the doorway with amusement.
“It’s not the end of the world, it’s just Mrs. Hudson,” he said evenly.
“You ought to. He’ll help you. You should hold onto him while you can,” Irene said. “You never know when you’ll lose—” She broke off though Sherlock couldn’t place if it was because they’d arrived in Mycroft’s office, or because she’d begun to say too much.
“Thank god,” he muttered. “I thought you’d run off somewhere. Was already envisioning my evening combing London for you. Are you all right?”
Moriarty straightened. “I’m listening.”
And now she was truly lost. She heard Mycroft clear his throat behind her and turned. It was difficult to face him knowing there were tears on her face, but she still knew she had to.
John wasn’t quite sure why he even would think such things in the moment. His eyes drifted to his own present to Sherlock tucked neatly under the tree. Light blue with snowflakes. Apparently the shop keeper had thought it was for his girlfriend and had chosen a more feminine wrapping paper without asking him. He hadn’t really had the heart to correct her.
The boy raised an eyebrow and sneered. “Fuck off.”
Sherlock blinked a few times, but still kept his gaze focused. John wanted to look away, but he couldn't. He needed to be ready the moment Sherlock spoke.
"Well then, why don't you just explain why there's a dead body as my Christmas present instead of that information I wanted. Daddy's getting a little teensy bit angry," he singsonged.
“Good,” Lestrade said with a smile. “I’m sure you’ll find something. There has to be some bloke crazy enough in this school to date Sherlock.”
Please read and review!
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock shot her a glare. “Shut up. It was years ago.”
Her voice caught in her throat as she tried to think of an explanation. She had none.
. Moriarty, her kind of man. No. There was only one man Irene had admitted to liking. He’d asked for something. He was calling her bluff. She’d given him information. She hadn’t wanted to, but she had.
"I hate to…interrupt," he panted. "But do we have any of the necessities? Condoms? Lube?"
"The Woman…before we parted…she said you were lying. She said you…you have feelings for me. Is it true?"
“John!”
Molly was relatively surprised when her brother’s head appeared from the kitchen doorway. She would have expected him to be locked up in his room by now, trying his best to forget that weekends existed. He stepped into the room, folding his arms in a perfect imitation of Mycroft, though admittedly with a tighter purple shirt instead of the fancy suit jacket.
“John, please can you check those flight schedules; see if I’m right?” Sherlock said, not looking away.
“We need to talk,” he said. “Alone,” he clarified when John didn’t move.
Sherlock had already been in a foul mood before he arrived at his English class. To say the least, being surrounded by morons and forced to read material that he found completely pointless did nothing to boost his mood.
That was until the door opened while he was at the sink washing his hands, and John Watson stalked in.
One of Sherlock's long fingered hands came up to caress his cheek. John jerked a bit at first, stilling only when he saw Sherlock smile.
Sherlock moved slightly, going over to the doors and shutting and locking both, probably in hopes Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t barge in. As he went back towards the couch he glanced back at John for a moment, eyes flashing uncertainly. God he made a beautiful sight.
The bloody phone had been sighing at random intervals for a good two weeks. John wasn’t sure how much more he could handle. Hence the reason he was spending a good amount of time at his girlfriend’s which she thought was sweet and he thought was convenient. Anything to escape from Sherlock Holmes and his moaning texts.
Their lips connected before he had a second to think. He reached to weave his fingers into John’s hair, pulling him closer. He closed his eyes again, allowed himself to savor that previous memory, and to store away this one too. He’d fill a whole room in his mind palace with them. Build an entire library to what they had and fill it with books full of each kiss and each moment. How fitting now that he knew what to call it. Love.
Sherlock was at the window, playing his violin. He set it aside as John entered, glancing up with question in his eyes.
On my absence- I started a new job and also had some episodes of anxiety and depression that made it almost impossible to write. I'm back now. Also, I'm going to try to finish Yes You Are before I do any more work on anything else.
“I think she’s still out of your league,” the imbecile beside him said. “And there’s the matter of Sherlock and all.”
"I promised your brother," John managed to say between kisses, "that I'd give you some sort of pleasure so you could forget about what happened to The Woman."
“Whatever’s on that phone is more than just pictures,” John stated.
She was about to open her mouth when John appeared in the door.
I couldn’t decide whether to laugh or to cry. Every emotion on the human spectrum seemed to be flashing through me at once. Little bits and pieces set me off. His brazen apathy, his uncaring tone. And yet his stern face, those familiar eyes that I’d only seen in dreams as of late. A smile half twitched on my lips, only to be stifled as he continued on.
He strode briskly over to stand in front of Shannon. Her hand left John’s thigh rather quickly.
“I suppose I must,” she said. She picked up the coat she’d brought with her, sliding it over her shoulders. Without another glance at Mycroft she walked to the door. A few more weeks. A few more months. Who knew how long it would be. She’d flee of course. It was instinct. Simple as that. Anything to keep herself going. But in the end she’d embrace death. After all, all lives end.
Mycroft nodded and thanked him.
“Pull off for a moment, Dr. Watson,” Irene instructed.
Sherlock scowled and scanned the man’s face. He shook his head.
"No," John said.
“Well of course she has,” Lestrade said with a smile. “How’s Sherlock been?”
Irene nodded. “Fine,” she said. “I’ll have it in a month. A little Christmas present for you.”
“Good to see you as well,” Molly said, smiling a little brighter. “Er…did you have a chance to watch what I sent you?”
, she’d said to John.
I couldn’t bear Baker Street after just a few days. It became too much. I apologized to Mrs. Hudson and moved out, rented a flat on the other side of the city where I could ride the tube to work and gradually start forgetting. Other than the bloody therapist everybody started recommending I go see.
"So's this," John said.
His mind was a mess. He couldn’t straighten his thoughts out. For once answers seemed to be eluding him. He couldn’t process anything, couldn’t sort out the information Irene had just spoken to him. How could he when everything in him wanted to remember the moment John had brought him to—
Donovan rolled her eyes. “You’re kidding me, right? You’re giving up that easily?”
“No,” John mumbled and leaned back in to plant a few more fleeting kisses on Sherlock’s mouth and jaw and even his nose. “Sex. Now.”
"John," she said.
“Yeah there’s this great restaurant I’ve been wanting to try… and we could…you know…eat and maybe…study?”
After feeling satisfied that Mrs. Hudson was all right, even if she did continue crying, he went over to haul the American up onto one of the chairs. He proceeded to find the duct tape and strap him to the chair.
He attempted to walk back towards his friend. Maybe he could do some damage control. But Irene held out a hand and stared at him, and even though she didn't speak he somehow got the message. He sighed and waited a moment. Maybe she was right, maybe chasing Sherlock wasn't the best option anyways.
“That’s great!” the boy chimed in before she could say anything else. “Well maybe you’d prefer something other than dinner then…I know of a great place to go if you’re interested in—”
“Irene Adler.”
It took all of his self-control not to just rush to her command. God, how he wanted that. But he couldn’t allow her or his desires to have too much control. No. John moved to kiss Sherlock’s neck again.
we'll take a cup of kindness yet,
Watson turned and frowned at him. “Do you mind?”
With a nod, Sherlock turned to deepen the kiss. "I quite agree."
“He could just like the color!” Lestrade scoffed. “Furthermore, couldn’t they be a girls? Like…Adler or whatever…someone else’s? A last conquest?”
“Fine,” John muttered, staring down at his computer.
“John,” Sherlock murmured.
!” she said, turning towards the stairs.
He heard her tromping up the steps before she poked her head in.
“Er Sherlock,” John said when he picked up the instrument.
"I'm not in love with her," he said calmly. "I never have been. But I can't deny she gave me you."
Sherlock motioned to his own chair. John clenched his jaw, but remained silent as Irene took her place.
It was difficult to maintain composure, but John did his best to not let his smile disengage.
“So?”
I began my speech, stumbling over the words and botched the whole thing. But she was smiling all the while, not minding my clumsy attempts at asking her for her hand. Just as I was finally managing to put words to my feelings, however, was when the waiter bumbled back over blabbering about the wine.
“Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull ... suspected punctured lung,” Sherlock said clenching one hand into a fist.
When John stared at him, he waved a hand.
Irene smirked, and John imagined all the nasty things she could probably say.
John’s mouth opened and closed a few times, but he had no words. He stood up and grabbed for his clothes, throwing them on as quickly as possible.
“It’s all a bit of a blur, inspector. I lost count,” Sherlock muttered with a smile.
“And you’re x-raying it?” Molly asked.
He caught sight of a new boy across the yard, practically ogling him. The half-wit looked to be nothing of consequence, so Moriarty thought little of paying him any attention. He fixed his sights on Molly and let the rest fade away. Strategies were already in the making, and he was sure soon he’d have the perfect trap.
“Tranquilized,” Irene sighed. “Such a pity they had to interrupt us. We were having such fun. Well, pack up the things darling. We need to move again.”
Sherlock stared for a long moment, trying to figure out what to do. Had he been foolish not to tell Molly? He’d hoped to not have to admit his embarrassing mistakes, but maybe that was what needed to happen.
Her grin widened. “Oh let’s just say…ten seconds or more? Not too hard is that?”
He straightened at her words. We all do silly things. No, she was right. It was just as he’d said. People in love did silly things. People did…
no…or
"Oh, is he home?" Mrs. Hudson hissed. She pushed a few stacks of papers back into place and shuffled nervously towards the stairs, meeting Sherlock just as he reached the landing.
“But what did you think of the last episode?” Molly asked, trying her best to contain her excitement.
"I'll come after you if you don't," John growled, fists curling. He would. He'd chase her to the ends of the earth to have Sherlock's happiness back. Just to see one of his quirky siles or catch a glimpse of joy glittering in his attractive eyes.
. And dance he had. Dancing around his feelings. Skirting around his jealousy as John brought home girl after girl. Dancing around the possibility of what a future might be like finally having someone. Knowing he wasn’t really a freak after all.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Most likely.”
Mycroft’s gaze was on him, a mixture of disappointment and frustration. Irene too was looking at him, though she was continuing to give him her famous smirk.
“Oh,” John said. “Sure. Private. Yeah that’d be fantastic.”
“I think…we’ll try a different approach,” Lestrade said after a moment, his voice coming out more choked than he had been expecting. “You…er…we won’t be needing your help.”
He hung up and lowered the phone. John hesitated only a moment before stepping a little closer.
He swallowed, difficult against the wood of the violin against his throat, but not impossible. His eyes closed, and he felt that single drop of saline glide down one cheek and drip onto the instrument. In his mind he sang the words to the song, and reflected on how much more he wanted to have the truth than ever before in his life.
“How did you know she was dead?” Mycroft asked.
“Is it… something to do with… well…” she hesitated. She thought back to the other day when she’d talked with her tutor and he’d mentioned that Sherlock could find a guy. That plenty would find his behavior attractive. Could it be possible?
“I do love your plans,” Kate agreed. “In the meantime, we continue to watch and wait?”
Sherlock sat frozen, waiting, trying to anticipate the next words. Of all the deductions he needed the most, why couldn’t this be one he could make? Why did John’s feelings confuse him so?
, he thought.
Every emotion possible flitted through him simultaneously. Anger and confusion and sorrow and joy. Sherlock had been heartbroken for nothing. Sherlock had been wrongly hurt. Sherlock would be with Irene Adler and not John. Sherlock would be elated to know that Irene was alive…and that he no longer needed to mourn.
“Why are you back so soon?”
Her eyes sparkled. “We all have our reasons, Mr. Holmes. I had mine. Just like you have yours. I told you…love can be a disadvantage.”
“Obviously,” Cindi snapped. “But it wasn’t her name out of your mouth either you…you…”
“Just… more for Molly than anything,” Sally muttered. “With men clambering for her left and right.”
Molly sighed. “It’s a party, not a mafia meeting Mycroft,” she muttered. She grabbed her own coat and smiled at Mary. “But I’ll be sure to have fun if that’s what you’re asking.”
There was a second of shock for the doctor. He froze up, stiffened as his colleague, his flat mate, his friend placed a soft yet insistent kiss to his mouth.
“Well, do you remember that lovely secretary we three-wayed with last March?”
There was a loud buzzing noise. Sherlock looked perplexed and then sighed and turned back to pick up his violin again.
He typed in the letters one by one, never breaking eye contact as he did.
“Look, just figure out what you want,” John said softly, even as he kept his gaze focused on Sherlock, thinking how he might need to take his own advice.
“Right, I’m going to go out for a bit,” John muttered, grabbing his plate and taking it towards the kitchen. If Sherlock heard him he didn’t respond. He kept playing. Until a soft sigh from the table broke his concentration.
“The counter on your blog still says one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five.”
Sherlock tossed the device to Mycroft.
“Oh dear,” she said, glancing around the kitchen. “I’ll start here. You do the sitting room.”
let it rule your head,” he said.
“Of course we are,” Irene said in a purr. “Goodnight, Molly. Do look into that dating advice I gave you. I think it will prove quite beneficial.”
The car drive was a long one. The other men in the car didn’t speak a word to him. He let his mind drift, though every time he tried to really
“And what exactly are those?” Sherlock said. He walked over to one of the chairs and sat, crossing his legs.
Sherlock ignored her and passed through. John thanked her before following up after, reaching up to straighten his collar. Hopefully it wouldn’t slide or anything. Couldn’t have people like Donovan knowing what he and Sherlock had been up to earlier.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asked, straightening as he watched John go to the door.
“Yeah fine,” John said. “Could use a night on someone else.”
He felt like his heart might stop, even as his own body continued to express its interest.
She laughed at that, though out of the corner of his eye, John thought he saw Sherlock making a face.
Sherlock scowled and turned in time to see Molly in the doorway.
“I’m trying to watch the ballet,” Watson murmured.
“Er…you were right? About the flight?”
His eyes strayed back to Molly. She was smiling, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. He felt himself swallow, heart beating a little faster as he gazed at her.
“Anderson’s party?” Mycroft said. “Now we’re getting somewhere. More insight, Sherlock?”
Lestrade sighed and shrugged. Thankfully, some of the tension was diverted when Shannon appeared dressed in a black skirt and button up top.
"Er…the case?"
Lestrade closed his eyes. She was right of course. He was blowing this out of proportion. But that didn’t make it any easier to accept. Molly had been so lovely, so perfect. He would have been delighted to take her out, let her talk about that biology class he knew she loved. Held her hand as she went shopping. Taken her to go pet the cats at the little store downtown. So many possibilities all gone in a moment.
“I have,” I admitted, but I was unwilling to allow him to make any other smartarse remarks, so I pulled his mouth to mine and kept it there for a good long while. I called Mary about an hour later, apologized, and assured her that I would unfortunately have to call off our upcoming engagement. I’d found the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with… I stared down at him while I spoke, watching those familiar eyes glitter as he listened to my little farewell speech.
He froze. Though he’d been anticipating needing to “discuss” things, the moment still surprised him. He faced John, stared into those familiar eyes and did his best to utter a relatively neutral response.
“Hmm yeah. You two had a fight didn’t you? Come off it, what happened?”
“I’m not stupid you know,” John said, turning back to his food and wondering if Sherlock really did think he was. Most likely. That was the whole appeal of bloody Irene Adler and her brilliant mind. Sherlock would slobber all over himself for her then. Intelligence…he’d always been smart in school, but nothing like Sherlock of course. Compared to the detective he was average. And Sherlock clearly wasn’t interested in average.
Sherlock's eyes locked on his.
John’s face fell. “Was it? Really?” He reached up to run a hand through his hair, tousling it. Sherlock nearly smiled at the sight, but this wasn’t the time for him to become sentimental. It was serious.
“I think things have become a bit more interesting,” Irene agreed. “But with our next week of changing locations, I don’t know that I’ll mind waiting a bit for the speed to pick up. Don’t you worry, Kate. We’ll have them both.”
Molly kept walking, urging Mary on a little faster.
Nonetheless, he had agreed to help Mycroft. Why he wasn't sure, but for now he'd stick with his original agreement. He was a man of his word. And besides, for some ridiculous reason he was set on trying to help Sherlock Holmes. And if trying to figure out how to make him better with the help of Mycroft worked, then so be it.
I sighed. “Well, if it weren’t for bloody Sherlock and his poor sense of timing, I would have asked you this evening what you wanted next, but—we were interrupted at a crucial moment.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to the stage as the soft tone to signal the end of intermission rang out.
. Virgin. Important. Untouched. Pure. Sexually inexperienced. A conquest. For Moriarty? Perhaps. Or had it been a shove to Irene. He could only guess it was that.
“Seen what?”
Thankfully, I’d only downed a couple before I saw her. This gorgeous brunette. I’d noticed it was a problem sometimes. When I was thinking of him…I would just try to find the girl who looked the most like him. Tall and lean, not too curvy. However, usually the fantasy would die out around the moment she opened her mouth. I’d even made a move on a guy once with a slight similarity, though that turned too weird for my liking far too fast.
He’d decided maybe it was time to take a more direct approach. When they entered into Baker street he went right for the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of wine. Nothing like a little liquid courage.
His throat was closing up. A few tears pushed at his eyes, and John was helpless but to let them roll one by one down his cheeks. Sherlock's eyes widened, and he drew back some.
There was a pause before Lestrade stood as well. He didn’t savor the idea of angering Sherlock, but nonetheless, any information he could gain would be one step closer to calling something like this an actual date.
Why flee when there was nothing left to fight for? It was obvious Moriarty had won. There was nothing left for her. No matter where she ran he would find her. And at this point the toll had become too much. So what options did she have left?
Textbook really. Sherlock could practically imagine Mycroft’s sneer, hear his brother’s disdainful voice decrying what he’d done as idiotic as he believed it to be.
“But he’ll be there,” Lestrade said. “He’s got tickets.”
Sherlock relaxed and withdrew, even though every fiber of his being was screaming at him to move back in, kiss along that beautiful neck, up to John’s jaw, move til their lips were connected and then just—
“Be a dear and help me?” she asked, face screwed up in exertion. I chuckled and rose to my feet, swooping in for a kiss to her cheek before helping her unload. As we headed to the kitchen she paused to glance at the telly, noticing what I was looking at.
“I’m going out,” he announced. “Well…going to pop down to Mrs. Hudson’s for a moment and then go out.”
The next morning I shaved the blasted thing off. Mary was all too delighted, though she wouldn’t stop pestering me if I would see Sherlock. Funny considering the sooner I did it, the sooner I might be leaving her. But that didn’t seem to bother her in the least. Still, I wasn’t sure if I was ready for another encounter so soon, so I headed to work and tried to make the time pass faster. I couldn’t concentrate though. Even mistook one of my patients for Sherlock in disguise. So, in light of that I decided late that afternoon to head over to Baker Street again. Best get these things over with. Of course, just my luck, I would get kidnapped in the midst of all that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Irene said. “It’s always a disadvantage. But there are times disadvantage can be worth it.”
“Thank you, Molly,” Sherlock said.
Irene felt as though her heart might stop. She sat there hardly able to believe this was happening, letting Kate take the lead as she processed.
“Did he say anything?” I asked with a groan.
“Afraid of you?” Sherlock said. “Fear is a waste of time. Especially irrational fear. And for someone like you…well it would be just that. So, if you don’t mind getting out of my way…I’ll be going.”
