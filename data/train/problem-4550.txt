Dean frowns at me. “Why do you care who I make out with?”
Baby’s had a lot to think about in the months that Cas’ been gone. Now, though, with the mad dash Dean, Sam, Meg, and Cas are making, doesn’t seem like the time to bring it up. There isn’t time, really, but she has to at least ask this.
Dean stills, and lies the lighter flat on his palm, not offering it over but still letting Cas see the engraved side.
"I think that's my father."
"I don't even know if I like boys, Cas, how am I supposed to know if I like you or not?"
“Wait a minute, Dean. Those derelicts, they're demons. I can see their true faces.”
Cas’ mouth does the shadow of a smirk. “That was too perfect an opportunity not to come out to the whole family. Might as well get it all over with, you know? Rip off the bandaid and then burn down the house.”
I watch my reflection in the beer he places in front of me. My pupils are huge and swollen, dilated to the point that I can hardly see the blue in my eyes.
“I’m no good at this. How am I supposed to find him?”
Dean isn’t sure if Cas is gonna return, and he’s not sure if maybe Cas had asked him if he needed help home, and Dean had said no. He knocks his head backwards to rest on the wall, and sits staring at the ceiling for a few minutes. Then he goes over to the group on the other couch to figure out his way to his dorm.

And everything fell into place when she said that, because now I had a Meg.
Kendall leans forward and starts a very solemn conversation with Cas as he wrestles with a booster seat for Jack, which he either managed to find in this shack or, more likely, brought all the way from home. Cas converses with her as he methodically adjusts it, steals Jack from Dean’s lap, and starts him in on his toddler-approved food. Claire can only stare in confused wonderment at this little family unit. If tears are maybe choking up her throat just a little, she’s taking that to her grave. Watching her dead-dad-surrogate-dad-angel-of-the-lord tenderly care for this baby… well, it makes her feel things, most of them fuzzy.
I turn my attention back towards the kitten in front of me. We are similar in many ways, Napoleon and I. We exist to give comfort to others. We provide services.
“She didn’t even want this, did she.” Charlie sighs and sits next to Dean, putting the rejected cups on the coffee table. “Well, what now?”
Even the sun creeps over the horizon like it's tired, sluggishly dragging itself into the sky. I roll over, only to be greeted by the cushiony warmth of Dean's body, our faces inches apart. His eyes are closed, so clearly the sun hasn't woken him up. Light breaths slip out from his slightly parted lips, the breeze now in my face. I guess he must have fallen asleep in my bed last night.
Claire can see everyone at the table gearing up to ask their most burning questions, so she cuts them off before they can start just yet. She introduces them one by one.
Kevin nods at Castiel. “Hi. So, how do we want to do this? Normally we all take notes on the chapters before…”
“Hey, Sammy, how’s it going?”
Meg takes the responsibility. "But what about- I mean not that we would have anything against you- but, what about Anna? And all those girls that Dean's always making out with?" She looks uncomfortable.
It’s tan, and large, and from what she can tell it’s a trench coat. Just a coat, but it hits her like a shot. The reminder that Trench is dead is something she can almost taste, and she starts her engine haltingly, hood in the clouds as Dean drives her to their next stop.
"'Morning, Cas!" She grins, taking a sip from the jug of juice directly.
Before long Meg has emerged as the winner—or loser?—of Never Have I Ever, all her fingers down and lots of alcohol presumably in her system. Across the room they see her jump up, declare an end to the game, and come to find Cas.
Meg chooses this moment to plop down on the log next to their chairs and interrupt.
“I know.” Dean sighs again. “It's complicated.” He squeezes his hands together painfully, relaxes them. “I hoped that the dance we were doing was more than just friendship, but I wasn't sure how you felt. And I wasn't ready. And then when you brought it up, I lashed out.”
-In the first chapter, the characters refer to GRIDs. This stood for Gay-related Immune Deficiency, which was the name used to refer to AIDs in the early days of the crisis.
Who knows. Maybe she was just letting her feelings for Trench bleed into how she thought Dean felt about Ca— Wait, no, her friendship with Trench. Her deep friendship with Trench making her read into the intense gazes their respective owners shared. That was it. Maybe Lisa really was the one, and Baby just couldn’t see it.
“Your eyes.”
I stop when I reach the bench where I saw my father kissing the blonde and shove my free hand into my pocket; the other’s holding my beer.
Dean closes the gap—
I stumble towards Jo and Gabe, who have only just noticed me. “Guys, I need your help—“
Damnit!
“I like you.” He heaves a long sigh, like he’s been holding it in for a long time. Maybe he has.
“A point mutation in FGFR3,” Cas intones.
He hears the click of the answered call right when he hits Red Square, and slows.
They're making fun of her again, for being a little bit of an airhead. Jo's smart, but she has trouble making people take her seriously. Meg and Gabe are just smarter. They're quicker, and, in some cases, they're meaner. Dean says they'd make good murderers.
“Will do.” Dean hangs up and turns to Cas. Cas looks back, uncertain— an unusual expression for his face.
It was passive aggressiveness at its finest. Trust the Novak family to turn ’pass the brussel sprouts’ into a scathing insult.
“He’s right, let’s come back in 15. I’ll get a snack!”
I have to leave.
“She’s not gonna judge you or anything, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
The bar.
shut up Char no interrogating
“I’m quitting. Think I’ll give this lighter to Sammy, if he wants it.” Dean runs his thumb over the inscription once more,
I can't help but feel a sense of guilt because I know what Dean's up to. Probably still standing in that spot on the beach, starting to hate me.
"When I was a kid, there was this thing in the attic, like this metal pole."
Speaking of… He shakes his head of thoughts and looks back in the window. Cas is looking down at his hands but his mouth is moving, so that’s a good sign. He looks up suddenly and catches Dean’s eye, and smiles. His hand motion beckons, so Dean opens the door and goes inside, smelling of smoke.
The October air hits me like it should have half an hour ago, goosebumps forming on my arms. I clutch Meg's hand harder than I ever have before, because it's the only way for me to communicate, to express the way I feel. Maybe anger? Disappointment? Shock? Sick? If I'm not even sure, how can I tell her?
"What? You pussyfoot around it, but it's true."
Meg angles her towards the Sucrocorp building, not hitting the brake as expected, but shifting up a gear. Baby gives it all she’s got, and breaks their sign quite impressively if she does say so herself. But when the smoke clears, it’s just Sam who comes to get her; no Dean at his heels, no Cas. Baby feels like someone fed her the wrong gas, her tank roiling, and it has nothing to do with her current scrapes. This isn't how it’s supposed to happen.
“LSD,” says the first one. “It makes you—“
-Cas is forty five years old when gay marriage is legalized in New York.
Their first meeting had been anticlimactic.
And what better way to avoid forgetting things than to write it all down; to record it.
Cas relents, flipping over the card.
“Madison just texted. She has invites for the three of us, so I assume everyone here can crash it as well.” She leans against the table a little unsteadily, but her voice is clear and steady. “Let’s kick off Fall break in style!”
Dean's a bit high, too, or else he'd have nipped this conversation in the bud. As it is, he actually thinks about it. Even if he doesn't gloss over his father, the resentment and maybe straight-up hate at the end, there was still love all around. Yet why didn't Mary’s support cancel out John’s occasional outbursts, his domineering personality?
Meg sighs. After a few moments, it becomes apparent that she isn't going after him. Dean glances at her uncertainly, but she looks straight ahead at the fire.
"Meg?"
“It’s 6:10.”
The next few minutes I spend in silence:  watching people enter and exit the bar, watching the digital numbers transform on my wrist. 10:32. 10:54. 11:07. Has it been almost an hour already?
Dean shakes his head and smiles as Cas walks out of the lecture hall. He can't quite tell, but he thinks that was an attempt at a joke. What a weird guy.
"Different game!" enthuses Jo. "Any ideas?"
Her tone is purely curiosity, but they both know that’s not all there is to it. It sounds forced, even to her.
The crash of a ten year old boy hitting the water.
Cas guards it with a smirk.
Castiel sighs, and Dean can feel him softening. But he's not done, not quite. Cas stands, goes to retrieve something from the kitchen counter so that Dean can’t see his face when he asks:
"Your girl has some strong opinions on your life, huh," he prods gently, tacking on a conciliatory chuckle.
"Did you get the cigarettes?" Gabe asks me.
Dean stops dead in his tracks at the sound of my voice. He turns to look at me and stays still as I walk towards him, until we’re standing face to face.
I don’t know what to do. Every instinct in my body hisses at me to pull the trigger, to save myself, to save the real Dean and Meg, except Dean’s eyes are pleading, begging me to have mercy.
"He said," Dean jumps quickly into the verbal gap before Sunglasses can dig his hole further, "that... red-green color blindness is... an example of an X-linked condition. A recessive one. Non-mendelian. Sir."
She didn’t fully expect to see Trench again.
He won't cry, he won't. It's silly to get emotional. This is an old wound that should be dead by now. But he's emotionally stripped himself just to make this phone call, and his mother's acceptance feels good, goddamnit. The weight off his chest feels like a physical thing.
She shook quietly, sobs escaping her intermittently, her hands pressed to her face.
They sit in silence for a bit.
Meg smacks him on the back of the head, with an "Asshole", and stands up. "Come on, we're burning daylight."
Have you ever seen a dead body? If you have, you'll know that you don't just see it. You feel it, hear it, and in the worst cases, smell it. She hung from the ceiling light, what I would later come to know as a noose around her neck, which was purple and vomit-colored from bruising. She hung limply, like a marionette whose strings had been cut, skinny and frail and grey. Rubber-duck-yellow dish gloves covered her hands, which were at my eye level, but the faint outline of a wedding ring on one of her fingers made me want to be sick. Although most of her face was covered by locks of blonde hair, glassy eyes showed through.
I spend the drive sobbing and dodging skinny limbs, the shriek of the tires squealing the only thing louder than the steps that chase me down the highway.
I simply groan in reply. It'll fizz up and overflow, and then be flat in ten minutes. There goes my fifty cents.
I gasp as Dean fists my hair, pulling just hard enough for it to tug my head back. Dean’s mouth flies to my neck and I try to hold back a loud moan. Now his other hand is on my dick and my knees are shaking so much, his body holding me in place is the only reason I’m still standing. The hand in my hair slides down my face, now covering my mouth, muffling my groans as his mouth works on my neck.
, it’s fine.
It’s the bench’s fault, really. If it hadn’t been comfortable, they wouldn’t have sat down here and could have continued their affair without a nosy teenage son ruining it.
“Yeah?” He turns around.
she calls, even though she knows it's futile.
Thursday 15th October, 1983
to text me the second he entered my house." She smacks her hand back down and squeezes his shoulders, glaring playfully at his head.
That was me.
It was too bad; she’d had a taste of Dean and Sam’s life outside her walls, and it was addicting. But no matter. She would go back to how she had lived for the past few decades: making mental leaps with the information she had, but most importantly being a warm seat for her boys to sit on.
Dean grimaces as he downs the rest of his jungle juice. Whoever mixed this batch was probably already drunk because the ratio of juice to vodka is horrible. The party is similarly shitty.
Everything is amplified, but muffled. The people at the table next to him seem interested in his conversation and he feels a hot flush of shame that anyone might be overhearing this, might be assuming he's someone’s
"Enlighten me, please." Says Meg, in her usual drawl.
“It’s probably too hot outside to wear it, now that you’re human, but…” Dean trails off.
Staring at myself in the mirror, I slowly place the little piece of paper under my tongue.
Dean laughs and glances over. “Nervous?”
Dean sits back, assumptions made and curiosity satisfied. This is a Seattle college kid, after all. He probably isn't going to smoke tobacco in that pipe.
“Not important,” Meg interrupts him, pulling a small bag out of her pocket and dangling it in front of him. “What is important, is this.”
So, swallowing her pride, she doubled down, confessing:
When Hannah came back with a convenience store owner behind her, she pulled me up and put an arm around me, turning me away from the body. She put the towel onto me, still wet herself, and made me sit down on a bench. All while the man called the police, and Mrs. Milligan, and some other people that I can't remember.
“You need to bring Meg home, she’s getting out of hand.”
"You're not from here, are you?"
Cas pauses in his anger, sitting back into the couch.
“No Sam?” Claire asks, and Cas shakes his head. “Honeymooning with Eileen.”
Dean’s seventh birthday party had been so fun. There’d been pie and ice cream and they’d gone to one of those trampoline houses with a few of his friends. His dad got there just in time to open presents, and gave him the best nerf gun ever, and a helmet too. Dean ran around with that thing all day, even after they got home, and even got baby Sammy in on the game. It had been perfect.
deanw96@uw.edu
. Claire dazzles him with a goading smile.
"Don't shoot the messenger."
“Then what do you propose?” Cas says, angrier than Dean has ever seen him.
My whiny tone returns when she announces this.
His nose was bleeding, too. Bent to the side, broken.
Peace or freedom? She hoped it could be both.
Back in the present, Dean flicks his cigarette butt into the water. He runs his hand over his face and instantly feels bad about it. The environment, and all that— Cas would be disappointed, he’s sure. Sounds about right.
“It’s you or the baby, sweetheart.”
Gabe jumps up in excitement. "We're going to get crazy drunk! Meet hot chicks! Go wild-"
What do I want to do?
“Give me some and I won’t report you,” I state blandly.
Dean rummaged, his arm through her window, and took an aspirin bottle from Baby’s outstretched seat. She followed the trajectory of his throw and—it was hard to see—oh. There was Trench, or Castiel to be more precise, looking worse for the wear.
Dean eats a spoonful of gumbo aggressively. “That’s different. I don’t need to be interesting to study with.”
It’s black again.
Since he's moved here, Dean has quickly become accustomed to the high density of weed, but is still sometimes amused by the whole subculture. Different strains, different highs, different ways to smoke... it's not really his scene. Some booze and a pack of cigs is enough of a party for him; simple and straightforward.
And off they go. Chuck even manages to eek a laugh out of Cas eventually, and Dean smiles. The rest of his family may not appreciate him, but here Cas finally has some common ground and a promising new familial relationship to explore. After all that ostracizing, it must be a wonderful feeling. Dean’s happy for him, and judging by his current smile, Cas is happy too.
Now that Trench is gone, —good riddance—Baby’s back to normal. It’s strange, because for all the talking they didn’t do, having Trench there was still something of a comfort. And even though being alone is her normal state, without T she feels much lonelier than she ever did before.
"The one you study with! I know study dates are a thing, you know. I'm hip."
“He… what? He said that? If he laid a hand on you I swear to—”
They go to the Ave, lunch that bleeds into them returning to his apartment, with purpose. She's cute, okay to talk to. Being down there had distracted him, though, reminded him of going out with Cas and his friends, so he brings her to his room. That reminds him of Cas, too, passed out in bed with him so recently, and he pushes the thoughts away, forcing himself to focus on her in the present. His phone buzzes so he silences it, and uses the pause to try and clear his mind. Succeeds for a bit.
We remain in silence for a few more minutes, as I occasionally shift my feet or Dean runs his hands through his hair.
They walk around the hedge in silence and turn the corner, staring at where the walkway turns into a dock stretched in front of them. There are houseboats branching off from the main dock, and some of them are actually pretty swanky.
“Mom, stop it-“  I start, only for her to interrupt me as well.
He would, and he does.
I looked at him, surprised. Adam had a reputation for being a bit of a wimp, too scared to climb up walls to sit on them and to lie to grown-ups whenever we were doing something against the rules. He got made fun of by the other kids for it, sometimes including me, but I still hung out with him.
"Come on, it's freezing out here!" he says, as he notices that I've pulled the curtains back.
“It’s not my fault! Luke dared me to!”
“What?” He sounds annoyed, Dean thinks absently.
, Trench confirms.
"Where's your mask then, Batman?" I raise my eyebrows at him.
Meg kicks him in the leg, and poor Gabe crumples, grabbing at his ankle.
“Someone’s got a crush on Captain Babyface over here,” Meg singsongs.
To cover the moment or to extend it, Dean's not sure, he lifts his pack and asks before his brain can process, "Want one?"
She offers Dean a beer, which he takes with a nod of thanks, and simultaneously puts a cider in Cas' chair's cup holder. Cas turns to glare at her.
Baby was not happy.
I waggle my eyebrows at her, making her roll her eyes and laugh.
After tugging my sketchbook out from under my pillow, I start to make adjustments to the design. Moving a screw a few inches down, adding notes about the metal, and mapping out the wires for the fifth time; it's my favourite thing to do.
I like it, though.
And the October breeze sweeps me off my feet, and into his arms, into a kiss.
Baby glowed even when Dean turned her engine off.
"Like if I bend or break, everything's going to fall down."
I look back at the bathroom door. Behind it are Jo and Gabe, who are apparently doing great in life. Past that, behind the back wall of the building, are Meg and Dean, who have decided that they don’t need me.
“Yes, Dean.” He eyes the lighter. “Need a smoke before we leave? It’ll be a few hours until our first stop and I’m not letting you smoke in the car.”
Dean starts walking again, into the sand, with me trailing behind him. He throws his arms up into the air.
Abortion: Would You Kill Your Child?
"Does Michael know?"
Dean self-consciously flits his eyes to Cas, who’s sitting up now, too— looking down at his hands, slight color in his cheeks.
Just as she’s thinking this, Cas looks up at her. “Claire.” He says evenly over the hubbub. “It’s very good to see you.” She smiles, and he continues. “Tell me about your new life?”
"Sorry! It's just... Damn." He settles on, not taking his eyes off of her. He's slumped over on the couch, dressed as Captain America. Maybe the superhero-themed costumes were a bad idea; Gabe's way too excited about his new alter ego.
"O-okay then." I stutter, still in shock.
"Sorry, I shouldn't have written that. I'll rip the page out." I say hastily, flipping back to where I mentioned Dean's mother. It was a stupid idea.
Mary "Mhm"'s over the line and Dean rolls his eyes.
They stop at a gas station and apparently Cas is going to become a hunter— she laughs, and Trench smiles back. If he really does— If the three of the boys really can stay together— She can’t imagine it lasting, but she’s giddy with the possibility that it could. What if life could be that perfect?
I drop it right back into the drawer; into the unknown that it emerged from. It clatters about, knocking against the wood, as it lands. I scramble about in the drawer, searching desperately for the keys that I know I can't leave without, wincing every time my hands collide with the gun. Eventually, I seize them, slamming the drawer shut and bolting out of the room, not bothering to close the door, tripping on my own feet.
Straining, Cas finally makes it to the car and throws his bag in the backseat.
As soon as Dean hurried back out of the hotel room, away from Cas and T, Baby knew it couldn’t be good. He was alone, and she could read him like no other. She knew that he was going somewhere recklessly, but she wasn’t familiar with the destination until he reached the door and— ah, Lisa.
Is Someone You Know Dealing Crack?
She doesn't even have to say anything; she just picks up her bag and we leave the club.
He returns to her, Cas following, and she does watch the way they are around each other, their silent communication. Feelings of betrayal—seemingly a constant—but also love. The more important constant. That, at least, is a comfort.
He looks back over at Cas, who is staring into space, his face shut down and expressionless. Dean likes to think he’s gotten good at reading Cas’ micro-expressions, but right now he has no clue. Nerves, Dean supposes.
“You’re right, it’s my fault that you decided the best way into my house was through a window.” I roll my eyes.
Add to that experience the name dropping she had heard, the trials certain angels had put her boys through, and she wasn’t sure how to picture the Host. But so far, no angel had seemed like good news, and her protective instinct towards the boys did not incline her to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Fuck it, it’ll be fun.
“What the—“ Dean’s words are cut off by the door slamming once more, this time as Gabe dives past it, following Jo into the building.
Dean’s the first to break the silence. “My dad’s been… weird about you coming over. Because of the, y’know…” He trails off awkwardly; we all already know what he’s referencing. The news about Hannah got around the school quickly, after one of her friends couldn’t keep her mouth shut. No doubt it reached Sam’s ears, then accidentally slipped out when he wasn’t paying attention. I scoff quietly to myself. The irony of John Winchester, parent of the year, not wanting me at his house. What does he think will happen? I’ll screw up his kids more than he already has?
together.” He gestures between them. “A couple. As in on a date, together.”
“The fact that we haven't fucked means we're not together.” Dean doesn't know why he replies this, so harshly, but he does. “Have you met me? I don't date guys. And if I'm actually interested in someone, they know.”
Let it fall down, I want to break, I want to break—
Trench fondly moved their focus to the two men, and Baby just watched them look.
Our eyes all widen as Jo’s voice hits a crescendo, becoming more shrill as she continues. Meg’s face is filled with hurt, as we all become suddenly aware that the joke is very much over.
"So your dad is having an affair." Meg says, quietly.
Somehow in his time outside, Dean hasn't noticed the boy sitting in the dark on the other side of the stoop, on a lower step. He's mostly just a shape in shadow, but one arm reaches up into a square of light from the house window to offer a lighter.
The game is pretty short lived, though; Megan gets bored again and Ash turns the TV’s sound back on. Cas seems a bit miffed, but he doesn't voice anything.
The aunts had continued their shrill chatter about insolence, when Lucas came in with a pointed, ‘He really does take after you, Muriel. Next he’s gonna be running off with the neighborhood boy, too.”
Meg, Jo and Gabe all look at each other as though they're all waiting for one another to say something.
And last, but not least, thank you to anyone that has read, bookmarked, commented on, or gave kudos to any of my works. Writing is honestly my favourite thing to do and knowing that someone out there bothered to read my work is the best feeling of all. So [insert cheesy thank you here].
He leads them around the living room, pointing out friends and naming them; they get stuck in conversation with Chuck’s next-door neighbor and the man wanders away to play his role as host. Eventually Dean and Cas drift from the conversation, finding room on the couch after loading up with food. Dean feels warm and giddy in a way that’s a bit foreign, but welcome. He feels like he’s finally in tune with the season, and having Cas by his side only helps with that.
"So what are you?" asks Gabe, unsubtly, to which Jo knees him under the table.
Baby tries valiantly not to lose her nerve.
“So how did you finally tell her?”
"Well, that's a surprise," says Jo.
Number 128— they stop, and Dean restrains himself from doing a double take. Unlike the cute surrounding houses, this one’s a bit of an eyesore. Peeling paint in an ugly color, sagging a little on a side. It was probably charming once, but right now it could use some love. Dean watches Cas, but his expression doesn’t reveal anything.
She was quiet for a moment, observing the weights in her front seat, then—
I chuckle, imagining the horrified look that would appear on Michael’s face at the prospect of being a father.
The hard edge in her voice wasn't supposed to be there, she swears. She can't help it.
I pause, for once unsure. What do I want to do? Eventually, after sifting through answers, I settle on one.
But Trench just stares dazedly as, Samandriel in arm, Castiel flies away.
“Oh, honey,” she interrupts her, “Once any man sees you’ve got a kid along for the ride, he’ll run as fast as he can in the opposite direction.” She shakes her head, faking sympathy. The bitch.
Dean sighs. “My friend Cas invited me to pre-party with his group. I’m just worried he’ll think I’m boring when we’re sober.”
“I bet he’ll still welcome seeing you. I mean, my dad wasn’t father of the year, but we had some good times.”
Trench is, predictably, grabbed out of her trunk again.
Yeah, yeah. Dean shakes his head and puts his game face on. He’s got this. Right after he washes the dishes.
The closet.
“Well,” Dean starts, looking taken aback. “That is- that is cool with me.”
Dean checks the cafes in the area, since he’s quickly been schooled out of thinking Starbucks is acceptable to sit down in. He laughs at his phone. Ugly Mug Cafe? Sounds perfect.
The Ave is officially named University Way NE, which gave Dean some trouble when he first moved to Seattle. A thoroughfare packed with shops and restaurants and coffee shops, it’s stereotypically a college hangout, but more realistically a homeless hangout. Still, Dean is interested to have the excuse to hang on the Ave and see what it’s like, even if he’s in a tipsy group of loud and obnoxious college kids.
His tongue moves around quickly, darting and making me suddenly shove myself against him and moan louder. My hands find his hair, tugging at the blondish strands to pull myself forward, to get more of whatever he's doing to me. I'm at his mercy, my dick controlling every one of my movements, and I finally understand why Gabe is so obsessed with sex.
"In the bathroom of the club."
"I heard John's taken up drinking. He's on his way to becoming an alcoholic."
“See! Told you!” She proudly exclaimed, wiping the water out of her eyes before pumping her fist in victory.
“No way!” spits out the taller one, who first spoke to me.
"Well, look who came crawlin' back," a familiar voice said from the other side of the room.
Most clothes look good on Dean, though, so it's not a surprise.
"What?"
“What do you want to do with your life, Cas?” Hannah asks me hesitantly.
“What’s that?” I ask her.
The third time was fiery and passionate and quick. It was sharp movements in a cramped bathroom stall, kisses that were always just a little too short, that turned into something sexual.
Dean tries to make conversation, cause that seems to be what he's here to do.
As she walks away into the crowd, she yells back, “And this doesn’t mean anything!”
Something happens, and suddenly Cas is stabbing Alfie.
, Baby greeted.
“What the hell are you talking about?”
Cas is hard to read, especially in the dark, but Dean thinks he's getting better at it. His eyes widen just slightly, his mouth shifts, he sit a little farther back. His eye contact wavers but then snaps back.
A pause.
In the end, Dean breaks the silence first. Cas had looked over for a long second in the course of their walk, and Dean had thought he was ready to start talking. Cas had finished his cider, and Dean had thought he would start. Cas had beelined to a driftwood tree trunk, strangely smooth and white and out-of-place in the sparse forest, and when he sat down Dean had thought he would talk.
Dean leans on her, waiting outside a gas station. It's one of many, but she immediately sees who his gaze lands on through the window. The angel. Or, who used to be the angel. Now just Cas.
Baby’s trying to keep it light-hearted, insubstantial, but Trench keeps derailing that. She blows out warm air.
“Oh.”
Dean snorts in reply, before sniffing his armpit.
But no. When the three had piled back into the car, en route to Bobby’s, there was no celebratory air. There were no injuries and there was definitely a victory, but no one seemed pleased, and Dean only once looked at Cas in the rearview mirror. So no, Baby was not happy.
Trench continued for some reason, the confession dam now broken.
He hands over the cider to Cas, who takes the can and proceeds to open it with sharp, jerky movements. They walk for a bit in the dark, Cas angrily sipping his drink, while Dean waits him out.
“Didn’t manage, huh?” I said smugly, only for Hannah to lift her hand out of the water, displaying a lump of muddy sand.
I splash water on my face, once, twice, again and again until water runs down from my chin, over the hickey Dean left on my neck, into my shirt. God, is it hot in here?
"Spit it out, man."
He turns to see Cas looking at him with a small smile. He doesn’t try to hide his gaze, instead looking into Dean’s eyes calmly. Then he goes about getting his textbook ready as if nothing out of the way has happened. Dean does the same to distract from the slight heat he can feel in his cheeks. Study time, Dean reminds himself. Study dates are fake. Study
Kevin joins them then, shouldering through the door with his gigantic backpack.
And suddenly, Meg stops.
“He never hated you, Dean.”
I am happy.
Baby chuckles a little, darts her gaze around, then back to Trench.
I shove my hands into my jean pockets, watching my breath in the air. Jesus, it’s gotten cold early this year. Most of the trees are already losing their leaves, removing most of the color from the street in the evening light. As I reach the end of my driveway, I notice John Winchester’s Impala parked across the street, fog in the windows.
“I could ask you the same thing,” she replies.
“I don’t know. All you know’s his name? Are you sure he lives in Washington?”
"Fuck, marry, kill?" suggests Dean.
However, a coughing fit doesn't stop you from awing.
Dean takes the Bic gratefully, lights up, inhales, and relaxes. After a moment he exhales and makes to hand back the lighter, but the other guy has already withdrawn his hand, and takes no notice of Dean's attempt. Without hesitation, Dean scoots over on the top step and taps the guy on the shoulder.
"What's up, Cas? You look kind of out of it..." she asks worriedly, frowning at my shivering and tired eyes.
“That is extremely bad for you, you know.” Cas has never before lectured Dean on his cigarette habit, so Dean's not offended; he's right, anyway.
“Returning the favor,” he replies, and I don’t have enough time to ask what he means before I’m slammed against the wall, Dean pressing against me. I give a surprised squeak as Dean kisses me, the millisecond I open my mouth enough for him to have his tongue touching mine.
I take a deep breath as I place my hand on the door handle, only needing to turn a key to unleash the chaos going on inside.
I gasp for air, desperately attempting to keep my head above sea level as salty waves crash against my ears, choking me—
I'm in the middle of describing the thoughts I had waking up when a voice from behind me makes me jump.
"Oh, fuck off," Dean laughs. "And it's cute how you called Marlboro harsh, at least that shit has a filter."
He pulls his backpack up on the table and unzips it, ready to pack away his things.
“Oh, that was fast.” Cas is looking at him now, slightly tilt-headed. “Thanks, Charlie, you’re the best.”
“Huh-“ I cut off my own words with a shriek as I swerve to dodge someone. Who the hell is standing on the highway at midnight?
Then: The divorce.
As run-down as it is outside, the house is pretty cozy inside. Dean and Cas wander over to a broken-in leather couch and settle themselves down. Chuck, deeming it uncluttered enough, comes over and chooses a chair across from them. He looks overwhelmed, and, Dean thinks, as his eyes find the liquor bottles Chuck’s tried to hide in the corner of the room, is probably nursing a fun hangover.
My father didn’t visit for three weeks after he found out about what happened with Dean. He still has yet to mention it to me.
“What time is it?” Hannah asks me.
“Can you stop staring?” I snap, facing him again.
“Just the name,” Cas grits out. “If that’s even right.”
The more Trench talked, the more Baby opened up in response, recounting the boys’ split and their long conversations, interjecting information in between the jumps in the coat’s knowledge— telling two sides of the same history.
“It wasn’t easy. It’s still not easy,” Mary replies quietly, not laughing along.
Cas blows the smoke out, his head tilted back, and the curve of his neck— Dean really needs to stop looking.
“So, he’s obviously pissed at you,” Meg says without preamble, once Dean is seated.
It's a struggle to walk quickly on the beach, but Dean manages to catch up once the ground becomes more dirt than sand and the trees become more than twigs.
Her pride won’t let her admit that she missed Trench too, doesn’t think she needs to say it anyway. This was the outcome she wanted, sort of, but she still feels sour about it.
I pull my shirt off, along with the rest of my cheap Superman costume. It’s weird to think that this whole time, I’ve been dressed as a superhero. I collapse onto my bed still in only my underwear, suddenly exhausted by the events of the night.
“No, like,
Oh god. Is she
Most of it Trench already knew, but they kept volleying back and forth, and somehow Baby ended up telling a story about an 11-year-old Sam accidentally falling asleep in the trunk— and these important anecdotes the coat surely did not know, because Baby received a surprised sheen from Trench in response to each one. The drive passed so quickly that by the time they pulled up behind a neon-lit building, Baby was just realizing that it had got dark a while ago. She hadn’t even been watching the road.
Needless to say, they hit the road a bit behind schedule.
I duck back behind the wall, not wanting to risk his eyes opening and seeing me watching them. It’s so intimate, they might as well be naked.
“Okay,” I state blandly, refusing to look him in the eye as I hurriedly rush around the room, tidying things away to avoid having to look at him.
Slam!
Dean takes it with distaste. “This is… I don’t know where this came from or what it is—”
, because Dean is warned a mile away.
“This is Charlie, we’re just friends.”
When I turn to Dean, though, his eyes are dark. He’s gone entirely serious.
Dean watches as Castiel opens several links in new tabs, searching through a knockoff White Pages and a few genealogy sites. It looks like there’s a few
“Wow, will you look at that? Our ninth abandoned factory. Ain't that America? Hey, what do you say, this doesn't pan out, we head back to that beer-and-bacon happy hour about a mile back, huh?”
, he says,
Dean looks at him, then past into the apartment. “Can I come in?”
After a few minutes of silence, Trench finally spoke up.
Silence.
“Hey, Adam!” we yelled back in unison, and Adam walked over to the edge of the pier, a few feet from where Hannah and I were swimming.
If I aim it right—
It’s the happiest she’s felt in a long time, and it's a long time coming. Well, she knows time moves differently for her, that the time she’s tarped or turned off or parked for weeks warps her perception, shortens the days. But she knows more time has passed than she’s been conscious for, knows it’s been a long time from the creak in her axles. Sam doesn’t service her nearly as often as Dean does, either, and she can feel it.
“Which one?”
From the other side of Cas, Meg makes her presence known. “Well now that everyone’s here, let’s go get some food.”
“Hey Cas.”
“What's got you in such a hurry to see me again?” She purrs, somehow oblivious to Cas standing there.
"What happened last night that's got you so giddy?" his roommate asks, a teasing suggestion in his tone.
Dean's head snaps up to look at me.
Friday 6th November, 1983
Dr. Mosley is a fascinating speaker, but Dean can't seem to pay attention today. He half-hopes Castiel doesn't reply, because he just realized a “yes” means Dean will have to interact with his friends around Cas and that sounds like it could be a minefield. Better that Cas doesn't see the email in time. Less nerve-wracking all around. Less potential for teasing. Best thing for everyone.
I don’t remember all that much, but various people—witnesses—have been helping me to piece it all together. No one is entirely sure what went wrong in my brain that Friday night, the night that I’m certain neither I nor any of my friends will ever forget about. Dr. Jenkins thinks that it was drug-induced temporary psychosis, Dr. German thinks it was a nervous breakdown, Dr. Ramsey thinks it was a psychotic episode, and my mother thinks that it’s puberty. That’s what she told our extended family, at least, when I was in the hospital for six weeks.
Not a single detail of my life was left untouched as they combed through the evidence, raking every secret I had every dared to keep and proudly spilling them out to my parents in a meeting.
We’re sitting by the stairs behind Harvey’s, watching Gabe desperately try to dislodge his head from between the railings of the banister. Some guy in the club had bet him $20 that he couldn’t, then abandoned him after he got stuck. He’s an idiot, but I feel bad for him sometimes.
But it’s too late. My mother’s already got her cornered.
“I’m putting on music.” I say, leaning over, one arm rested on Dean’s seat as the other digs through a shoebox on the bench, trying to find a cassette that everyone’ll agree on. My fingers push past old tissues and candy wrappers, and I find myself hovering above my seat, having to lean even further forward to get to the cassettes at the back. My unused hand brushes against Dean’s shoulder and I hear a sharp intake of breath; barely audible. Things have been strange ever since last week. Whenever we’re alone, he’ll sometimes press a small kiss against my lips or a hand on the back of my neck, making my hairs stand up. When the others are around, though, he’s distant and on-edge. Maybe he’s scared they’ll find out and their opinions of him would change? What if Gabe decided that he couldn’t associate with a queer? Or worse, what if it got out?
I kiss him quickly, and he smiles against my mouth before putting his other leg over the window. He slides down the roofing and I hear a thud as he jumps off and lands in my lawn. After that, there’s only the sounds of crickets, an owl hooting, and a car driving past. And he’s gone.
Baby is trying so hard not to get her hopes up, but her engine beats quickly just the same.
Dean's slightly caught off guard, but he figures he's already saved this guy's ass once in the past hour, why not once more? Cas looks like he needs all the help he can get, and it's a nice ass to save— Winchester! Just be chill for one whole minute, will you.
"Nothing like you're thinking," Dean states, schooling his expression and setting down the pot. He takes a sip, and although it tastes horrible, it helps rid Dean of the fuzz in his head. "Anyway, I gotta get to class. You can have the rest of the pot."
And then silence falls upon us once again, and I stare off into the moonlight—which is very quickly becoming sunrise. Colors are lazily thrown across the sky, lighting up our suburban wasteland. We’re all in shades of orange and pink now, the both of us.
“None of them ever talk about my father,” Cas says, voice low. “And I stopped asking after I was told I was born from a sperm donor. It’s a strange answer now that I think about it but I didn’t question it as a child. But when they started making jabs about it, Naomi said his name.”
"Cas!" She screams, beneath the sound of the waves.
"No."
-Cas’ father and mother got divorced in March of 1984. His father moved to Ohio, and refused to see Hannah or Cas for several years. Neither had the desire to see him.
I just stared on, blank-faced.
Eventually I saw a skinny wrist clutched in Hannah's hands, as she fumbled and tried to drag the boy up. He was slipping through her grasp.
, Baby chastises herself. She’s mad, she reminds herself, and she only wants Trench here to get an apology. But she doesn’t hear one, so she’s still mad.
“I can hear you-“
It’s after me.
“Y’know, Dad,” I lean back against the wall, a smirk playing on my lips. “Maybe we’re not the only ones keeping secrets.”
"Okay, me first!" says Meg. she pauses to think, before saying, "Never have I ever... Snuck out of the house."
If it’s the only safe place, then that’ll have to be it.
Cas is looking at him, as he seems to do, and quirks his mouth a bit when he takes it back.
I stop the car at Dean’s house. It’s safe. Sam’s at a sleepover and John’s out. I can’t go home and put Hannah in danger. It would get her. I have to protect her.
"So you don't care what he's doing, or rather, who's he's doing, right now?"
Okay so some little fun facts about this as a reward for anyone who actually clicked on the ‘notes and thanks’ chapter, the backbone of this fucking nation.
“Adam, come on, you’re not a chicken if you don’t jump!” Hannah yelled, concern in her voice.
Hey hows it going? Happy Thankgiving
“You know that cigarettes linger more permanently.”
Watching those two guys bicker over being queers or drug dealers was pretty fun.
It’s not too long before they head out, Cas and Chuck exchanging email addresses and awkward goodbyes. Cas is again silent in the car, so Dean makes a decision. It takes Cas a while to realize.
“I’m not going to drop out-“
Love, you idiots!
, Baby growled, and Trench broke off.
Benny does just that, closing the door and leaning back on it.
I make a beeline for the couch that my friends had claimed, only to see Dean sitting there, too, with the catholic schoolgirl on his lap, laughing at one of Jo’s jokes while feeling her up.
“Can I stay over?” Cas asks as they turn off the highway, in a way that couldn’t elicit any response but “Of course.” Dean clicks on the turn signal towards his place.
a bit too quickly, too forcefully.
“Rum and coke.” Cas looks amused and takes it upon himself to step even closer, leaning up to Dean’s ear. “Where have you been for the past half hour?”
"I'm using my brain, Cas, and my brain wants me to blow you." The seduction in Dean’s green eyes shines through the holes in his mask.
"New York. You live in a shithole, man." The girl glanced at her surroundings, as if to confirm, that it was, in fact, a shithole.
I had expected her to say that she wants to help people, to change the world, to make a difference.
I sit down beside her on the steps and hand over the cherry pop, before opening mine. I've never been to much of a fan of bubblegum; it's too sweet. Dean loves bubblegum.
“I bet you can’t do a backflip off of it!” I challenged her, folding my arms.
“No,” Dean replies forcefully. “Now is good.” He gives Chuck a strong look and they end up through the doorway, Chuck running around trying to put things in better order.
"That's quite a kind offer, Meg, but you know I don't like beach sex."
I shake my head reluctantly. “Nah, not tonight. I’m too tired.”
Dean can see Cas' silhouette ahead, walking through a grove of tall, skinny trunks, and he follows him down the sandy path.
Dean gives all three an extra charming smile as a force of habit. Of the three, Lydia gives him a flirty look in reply before going back to drinking her Coke.
she wondered aloud.
They go on like that for a while. It seems that Dean has fallen into a pattern: bringing Trench on hunts, taking them out to the bunker when he returns. It becomes a comfortable routine, an easy thing to talk about, short periods of time that don't lend themselves easily to big conversations or confessions.
He almost doesn’t get the courage to go. Why would Cas possibly want him? He’s done nothing but lash out. He couldn’t even handle being friends, why would Cas want to try at more, seeing what Dean’s already unleashed?
Meg and Gabe have already gone through a pack together, despite the half an hour drive, and Dean's lit two up. Jo and I are left coughing and sputtering in the smoke.
“Yeah, aside from Benny- that was the name of the guy in New York. I kissed Tommy Reynolds at the Spring Fling, but that was only ‘cause he wouldn’t stop goin’ on about how he’d never been with a boy and all that. I never really liked him or anything, but he seemed to really get off when I told him about Benny so I kissed him. He wanted to know what it was like.” Dean shrugs, like it was just an act of kindness to help the community.
They walk on in comfortable silence, and watch the seagulls play along the beach. Soon, the sun sets, slowly at first and then in a quick succession of hues, until it's finally below the horizon. The night gets chillier, and they hurry back to the car, tired and happy.
"Oh, Clark, you're too good to me."
Still, if angels are looking for Cas, that means he’s alive and safe from them, and that’s good. She’s content in the fact that Trench will be back eventually. That's how it goes. It’s just a waiting game; they always come back to her.
"But Meg," Cas says, fake placation in his tone, "I am being social. This is my friend, Dean."
"I think the children will survive."
It's a lot like that.
“I missed you. It’s been a while.” Meg sits down next to me hesitantly. Maybe she was told about my medical reports, and thinks I’m going to snap and hit her.
(He pointedly doesn't think about the time John catches him with Aaron, and how differently that scene plays out.)
"So where should we hit first?" he asks casually, referring to the bars that we will no doubt hop between faster than we can finish our beers. He's digging around under his bed, probably trying to find his shoes.
"I might like boys."
Dean turns to me, pouting. "Poor little Cas, how will you ever survive?"
A high-pitched scream rippled through the Boardwalk.
"Just walk," she said, matter-of-factly.
The first time was a drunken mess—now a blur in my mind—with only this journal to confirm to me that it did, indeed, happen.
Afterwards, with an old, animated version of
Dean doesn’t realize he’s been fiddling with his Zippo, spinning it between thumb and forefinger, until Cas reaches over and touches his wrist.
My hips buck involuntarily at Dean’s touch and I let out a groan. I can almost feel Dean’s smug smirk against my lips; he loves knowing what he does to me.
I only get angrier, as I watch the act of betrayal. Every time his hand slips under her shirt I get this pang in my heart. I want revenge.
What now?
My response is almost automatic when I say, "Have you told mom and dad?"
MacLeod begins the lecture and everyone dutifully whips out their note-taking method of choice. Dean digs around his backpack to find a pencil he deems sharp enough to work with, and starts writing.
"Thanks for inviting me along, Cas," Dean finally says.
Cas watches him light up without comment, instead continuing the conversation about Green Day, listening intently to Dean’s view on rock operas.
“I can’t believe they’re playing Never Have I Ever.”
It was my fault.
, the coat said crisply.
She gets Dean, though. She doesn’t want to be retired for however long (how long does it take to forget a serial killing pair? Probably a while), and she has a sinking feeling that it will mean Trench leaving. Dean had been carrying them on hunts, and then into the bunker: with him at all times. If he leaves Baby somewhere not with him, well… he’ll probably take Trench.
He hovers over them, hesitant. Cas takes pity, apparently, though he seems equally ill-at-ease, and scoots over to offer a seat. “Want to join?”
They investigate a preschool, they return. Baby can’t get the image of Trench walking the road out of her mind, but that isn’t really much of a change from her normal thoughts. She must’ve imagined it. Maybe Dean saw something else to make him back up.
Cas nods and Dean retreats to the dock, keeping an eye on the situation through the window. He leans against the house, rough side paneling digging into his shoulder, and has a cigarette to kill time.
Benny stumbles out of his room, stealing some coffee before Dean can pour his own travel mug. Then he leans against the counter as Dean grabs the pot for himself. He can feel himself looking like a fool, but can't seem to train his face.
Dean left her engine on, and she's ready to leave as soon as they come back out. She's ready to see Trench and rejoice over their reconciliation. Of course she’s generally anxious to hear their response to her confession, but she knows that either way they’ll still be friends. They have to be. She'll probably say some things that are much too schmaltzy, but that's okay; if it means Trench is with her, she doesn't care how sappy she gets. She smiles privately at how she knows Trench will be, timid at the beginning as always, then warming up quickly and sarcastically, the dry ruffling of their cloth making her laugh.
Dean shrugs, "No need to. Dad always lets me go out."
"She's totally gay, Mom, and even if she wasn't I wouldn't be interested."
“Don’t worry, you old man. They’re all cool.” Claire checks in with the table that yes, they are in fact cool. She shrugs. “We were actually just discussing your greatest hits.”
Cas huffs a watery laugh, looking down at his hands and slouching back into the couch.
Oh God.
Trench’s collar hummed as Baby paused.
Chuck, if possible, goes paler. “Oh. Naomi. Oh.”
“Listen, I have to tell you-“
"Nothing much. A description of my life, I suppose." I put down my pen as he approaches, leaning over me to read my work. As his eyes flicker across the page, he lets out a small laugh, just a breath of air slipping through as he smiles.
I've never ridden shotgun in Jo's car before, I notice, as we sit in silence for the drive back. She's got one hand on the wheel, the other supporting her head as she leans against the window. I sit with my arms crossed, tapping my foot to a rhythm that I don't remember.
“I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I detect a note of forgiveness.”
Finding Cas’ place isn’t too hard, and there are already people there when he arrives. Thankfully, Cas greets him at the door and claims him so that he doesn’t get lost in the group, then leads him into the kitchen to get him something to drink.
I don’t know how to tell my mother that I don’t believe in God.
Fuck it.
“But you have a reason to.”
I have to get someplace safe.
Baby rolled her headlights.
"Nope, I could give a crap what he's doing. He's just Gabe. He's gross and creepy." She scrunches up her nose at the thought, but can't hide the blush blooming on her cheeks.
Even after Dean puts his butt out on the driftwood and turns his eyes back, Cas still doesn't look convinced. Dean doesn't feel judged, though. He considers Cas' expression, and silence, and finds it almost endearing.
Baby pondered the overly-prophetic answer to her not-even question.
Dean is in a great mood. After he woke up and downed an ibuprofen for the slight pressure on the side of his head, he had time to reflect on what he could remember of the night. He can't pinpoint any one moment that made the night something special, but he can't stop the smile from stealing onto his face every other minute as he makes shitty powdered coffee.
Jo pauses, before giving a sweet smile. "Luc, of course."
“Just talk, mom.” He can't seem to stop laughing to soften this conversation, even if levity is the farthest thing from his mind right now. “Though I took it as law.”
Or—and Dean can't tell if this is better or worse—maybe Cas doesn't remember their almost-kiss last night. Dean doesn’t know what to do about that.
yeah im still free. 20 min
Baby can see Dean’s confusion, hurt, love, all jumbled together in his posture. Oh honey.
He can't even answer her.
I wander aimlessly for a few minutes, unsure of where I'm trying to go. Well, I know that I'm trying to get home- I'm sick of this night- but I don't know how. Hannah stayed in again tonight, and Gabe is probably getting his fourth round of blowjobs by now.
Baby is silent.
“This.” He hands Dean a bomber jacket that’s been neglected in the back of his closet. “I’ll be in the kitchen.”
Cas doesn’t offer it to him, for which Dean is grateful, just passes the bong along. Before he knows it, Dean has a cigarette out and has already snapped his lighter shut. He has an irrational moment when he almost asks if it’s okay to smoke here.
The lazy morning wakes me up before my alarm.
The lunch table's almost full when I arrive there, after hours of algebra that've pretty much numbed my brain. I like math, but, as it turns out, it's slightly less fun when it's being taught by an annoying bitch.
“And anyway, nut up, all right? We're all cursed. I seem like good luck to you?”
"Cas, you must never tell anyone about this. Not now, not ever. You can't tell Hannah, you can't tell your grandparents or your friends. And don't talk about it to daddy, either." And just like that, she was my mother again. Cold, analytical, snobbish, condescending; the perfect housewife in every way.
“You don’t need to tell me,” Benny says as Dean picks up their empty bowls and retreats to the kitchen. “Just be your charmin’ self and you’ll have no problems.”
“Oh.” Dean says. It’s been a night of revelations for him. “How—“
He just can’t stop thinking it over— his freak-out, Cas’ reaction. The thing is, he doesn’t have anything to offer to mend it. He can apologize, sure, he can explain why, but it’s nothing concrete to say he won’t freak out again. Nothing to prove he’s really committed to this idea, of them, together, so at odds with the sentiment he'd voiced.
"Technically I never entered it," comes the lazy reply as Cas relights his pipe.
It’s Cas. Speak of the freaken devil. Dean rests his head against the door. Why is he here? To have this awkward conversation in person? Why— to see the look on Dean’s face? Or maybe to continue what they started last night? He clicks Cas in, and his heart gets a nice workout as he waits for the man to reach his floor.
"Hey, here's your lighter back. Appreciated."
, as if it were obvious. I know you're from a state where being gay or whatever is okay, but I'm not.”
Cas opens his eyes to slits to peer at Dean. “And the other part…?”
Dean nods, a little put-off by Gabe's overwhelming enthusiasm. Maybe the alcohol is finally hitting him after that last beer.
"Only 'cause he has a lazy eye."
Dean and I stroll through the empty streets, not knowing whether we can call this late night or early morning, and being so drunk that we don't even care. My watch says it’s 4:23 but it doesn't mean anything to me, and the numbers swim in my head.
As before, Trench was the first to speak.
I'm more than willing to let Dean answer for the two of us when he does.
"It's eleven at night, Dean." I fold my arms, pretending that I'm not happy to see him.
“Sure, you can eat it at Christmas.”
I don't bother to look at his expression as I turn to walk back into the lively part of town, away from the sand and sea and the pained look on Dean's face.
“And they were… kissing?”
Dean jerks back as if he's been burned, letting Cas turn around and answer the offending voice.
"That's disgusting, Hannah." I scrunch my face up.
If Baby had hackles, they'd be sky-high.
I let out a sigh of relief, glancing up at the glass case filled with pamphlets.
"Hey, stop judging me!" Dean elbows him playfully. "You're the one with illegal drugs in your coat pocket!"
"I know you ain't. I'm just messing with you, Cas. No need to get all flustered." She gave a chuckle at the heat in my face.
The dull thud of his head smashing against a metal pipe.
Dean just watches as she leaves; at that moment Charlie finally comes back with two cups of coffee.
A raccoon scuttles past us, giving me an alarmed look before disappearing into a trash can around the back of someone's house.
"Harley's." I reply, instead of, “You just kissed me and now you're pretending like it didn't happening, so what are you doing?” Like I should.
“What’s got you in such a twist?”
“Wait, Dean.”
"Can you drive me home?" I ask quietly.
‘That would be interesting, Mother, if I planned on applying to med school.’ Dean was proud to hear how cooly Cas had forced the topic.
An hour passes in a haze of food and laughter— someone brings out cards and the two of them steal wine from the kitchen since no one cares enough to stop them. Finally Chuck has greeted all his guests, or at least finished avoiding Cas and Dean, and comes over to their couch. Dean puts down their shared hand of Rummy and looks up.
“Castiel,” Cas grates out. He ignores her offered hand, instead staring at Dean. “Is this what you had to tell me?”
Unexpectedly, after that small hiccup, Cas is back. Something feels off, but if Trench doesn’t mention anything then Baby trusts that nothing is going on. Sort of.
The funeral was the worst part. Mrs. Milligan looked at me during her speech, tears in her eyes, peering into my soul. I started at the ground. She had first lost her husband, now her only son, and it was my fault.
The wind whistling.
"...Thank you," Sunglasses, or "Cas" that is, says painstakingly. Dean chuckles again, and because the man is obviously in pain, shakes his head and resolves to stop bothering him.
Well, the time comes. She knew it would. Dean opens the trunk once again, but this time he bunches Trench up and takes them.
"An unlikely pair," Cas agrees, looking out at the trees.
“Sorry for disappearing earlier. I’m glad you found me.”
"I know better than to argue with Meg's plans," is Cas' reply, and the guy laughs in agreement.
It lasts a glorious four days, until Cas inexplicably goes into an assisted living building, and then doesn’t come back out.
She looks at Trench happily, but doesn’t receive any return look. Puzzled, she calls,
Dean laughs at the tail end of his own exhalation, deeper than warranted. "Good, that's good," he manages, coughing at the end of the laugh. "Or bad, I guess. Don't like it too much!"
As soon as the floor turned to black and white tiles,I saw her.
Short of going to Alaska, Dean had gotten as long a drive as possible away from Lawrence, Kansas. It had taken some work, but after completing his AA in Kansas he has transferred to the University of Washington and hasn't looked back. He loves his mom, but Lawrence wasn't the place for him. Now he makes sure to check back at least once a week, and talk to Sammy when the kid isn't at school.
“Nothing,” Dean says, trying not to sound like a petulant child and mostly succeeding.
“Whoops, I just couldn’t stop myself.”
Cas, suddenly, is leaning over the gearshift, an intense look in his eyes—
"I feel like that sometimes."
With the gun in one hand, I begin to toss clothes out of it, clambering in. I press my back against a shelf, maneuvering to allow my feet to fit in with me. I slide the door shut, enclosing myself in the pitch black.
Dean does a mouthless smile, eyes only, then stares daggers at Claire. “Yeah man, we’ve seen a lot,” is all he offers up.
I stood there.
As we make our way back downstairs, Dean calls out to Sam.
Castiel exploded, and all Baby could do was watch, her dashboard gauges flipping back and forth in a frenzy.
"Meg Masters."
"It's too dangerous! Get down!" Hannah called, her voice shaking as she attempted to clamber back onto the pier, her wet hands sliding off every time she tried to pull herself up.
But Trench does not sound very convinced.
I push my way through the dancers, feeling sick to my stomach. Dean sucks me off, and then goes after some random girls? Why’d he even do it if it didn’t mean anything? Did he just want me to shut up?
Ove laughs, and it ramps up Baby’s anger, but his next words don’t.
Flash cards continue, but their studying integrity devolves and it becomes a game.
, they whisper, a reminder, and Baby can’t help but laugh it back.
Trench curled their lapels inward and paused again. Just when Baby was sure they wouldn't speak, they began:
Dean smiles at him. “I’m just happy.”
“Sorry. What’s that?” Dean yells over the music, indicating Cas’ cups.
“This probably isn’t a good time, but shitty idea.” Meg sighs and shakes her head knowingly. She takes another sip from her beer bottle.
Jo mumbles something inaudible, and Gabe lets out a small laugh. Within ten seconds, they’re walking away, back towards the entrance of the bar, whispering things I can’t hear, and I can finally let myself breathe.
"Jo could drive it. Plus, how else am I gonna get to the Boardwalk?"
"Cut it out! You guys make me want to be sick." Jo exasperatedly sighs and hits Gabe on the thigh.
It’s following me.
Cas gives him a coy look. “No, I was going to suggest truth or dare.”
"I just don't get," Jo starts, waving her hands around exasperatedly on the other side of Meg, "Why they only ever talk about the sad stuff in the news! I saw a puppy wearing a sweater yesterday! Where's that shit in the news?"
Baby shook her windshield fondly. What was with her boy and eleventh-hour declarations?
"So why are you home so early? You're usually staggering back here at seven." I ask, and she gives a small laugh.
, well, that’s just the position he needs to be in to reach the popcorn.
One of his earliest memories: Mary hangs up the phone angrily, but Dean isn’t paying attention. His mommy hugs him, and she smells safe, so he’s happy.
“Yeah, well, I'm probably gonna die tomorrow, so…”
Slowly it comes out, Cas’ voice gaining speed and strength as he continues. He parodies the voices with only a slight change in inflection, but Dean catches on and follows the story.
“A la Mode? I love that place.”
, she reminds herself.
“Couldn’t be prouder of the bugger,” Dean says, and the table titters an astonished laugh. Dean Winchester and Castiel, here in the flesh! They’re practically celebrities. Andy has a look on his face as if Lancelot himself is eating fries with him in a sticky diner.
Meg calls out her answer back to me as she disappears into the bar, and I’m left on my own with nothing but my beer bottle and her words.
When Jo’s sobbing stops, Gabe’s voice comes out light-hearted.
"I've got to go. I'll see you guys soon," I interrupt Jo and stand up, making my way into the crowd. Last time I saw Dean, he was talking to some girls by one of the podiums. I shuffle around, scanning the people around me, looking for a Batman. People are packed tightly, bodies pressed together, the whole crowd pulsing together. There's something so overtly sexual about it.
“One sec!” he yells, and makes his way to the door.
"Nope, he literally means the bathroom. The Blue Velvet's bathrooms are known for being where people go to get off. My guess is that she's about to get some scuffed up knees." Meg shrugs and takes a sip of her drink.
The flick of their lapel… Did Trench gain a sense of humor when they were resurrected? Were they teasing her? Baby’s temperature gauge ticked up, flustered.
“No, no, no.” What he had wanted to say was something along the lines of
"You're right. It was."
No response.
“I do have one, Dean. I just keep it on Mercer Island at my mother’s house because I dislike driving. I could Uber there right now.”
“No. No, you think you know. You remembered it the way you needed to.”
“Happy Thanksgiving, hon. We miss you.” Shuffling on the line. “Here, talk to Sammy while I take this out of the oven.”
"Three months." He says quietly, turning away from me and combing through his hair with his fingers.
Dean sighs. “I want to apologize. I want to explain. I want to beg forgiveness. Well, I want you.”
And that was a good enough answer.
Baby isn’t sure what it is, but there’s a faint buzzing, her focus goes blurry and then—
, Trench says in the softest rustle.
There's no way to deny it: Trench isn’t with them. Trench is gone.
"And dreamy."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Jo asks.
“You okay?”
I stand up, glass shattering onto the floor. There’s a shape moving along the wall—a shadow, speeding across it. I spin around wildly, but it always moves out of my vision before I can see its identity.
I stare down at my popsicle, not previously noticing that it's gone, and that I've been toying with the wooden stick, not previously caring.
“Don’t be a dick, Dean.” Jo says quietly. We all glance up at her—even Gabe, who lets out a small, pained sound when he turns his head.
Dean laughs again, softly. "No?" He returns the pack to his pocket and attempts to steer the conversation to a lighter place before he says anything more about his dad. "Nah, I'm just a social smoker, don't worry. Not enough to hurt."
The way Dean drives her to Cas is a wild thing. She's not surprised at this point; this is the way they are about each other, and it warms her engine. That's not the only reason she's happy, though. She's so close to seeing Trench again, and that always puts her in a good mood. It gives her extra energy to gun it, and soon she's screeching to a halt in front of an apartment building, and Dean and Sam leap out, slamming her doors to run into the building. She waits, humming.
Baby tries to still her overactive engine, do damage control depending on how Trench reacts.
“Oh, fuck, oh fuck.” I mumble to myself. I missed him by a hair.
The absolute last thing Dean needs is to spend hours watching these two act gross and sappy, and he should really cut himself off and go home anyway.
“Hey,” Dean greets softly as he closes the door, Cas in the act of walking to the table and putting down his coat. “Sorry for the last-minute invite.”
Not like she could point his gaze to someone who had been in the backseat hours before…
Dean finds his voice. “If he really could forgive me, why didn’t he respond to my calls or texts?”
Perfect.
“Hey there,” he replies cautiously. “Is everything okay?”
The shadow gives a small laugh, disappearing again.
Silence.
I nod.
Meg holds her hands up in defeat. “Jesus, chill out. Don’t get all pissy with me.”
Soon our laughter dies out, however, and we are left in the silence of each other’s company.
Baby all but screeched to a stop; Dean banged his hand lightly against her dash, and she was reminded to start again.
“I’ll be right back.” I tell Jo, who looks at me exasperatedly as I walk away, leaving her sitting alone. I’ll apologize later.
“Cas?” Hannah asks, her head snapping towards me. She’s sitting on the roof, in her pajamas, staring at the suburbs that surround us.
Dean grabs the remote and pushes play on the movie.
“I tried to not have any expectations, but that was still not what I expected. He was so… I don't know. It sounds silly, but he was so human.”
Jo sighs at the mention of Gabe. "How am I supposed to know what he's doing? Just being Gabe, is my guess."
"Oh, I'm the crazy bitch? What about-" my mother’s words were cut off by a sharp slapping sound. And her breath hitched just as it arrived, like a crescendo. It was as though everyone in the house had fallen still the moment it happened, like we'd all been frozen in time. I could see dust particles in the air, hear birds tweeting in the distance, feel the tension weighing down on me like it was the size of the roof. The sound still echoed in my head. I ducked back behind a bookshelf just as my father came barrelling out, combing through his hair with his hands, huffing quietly to himself, letting the bedroom door slam behind him. He hurried downstairs, and half a minute later the front door slammed behind him, too.
Dean clears his throat, tries to laugh it off. “Nothing, just saw my friend out here and came to say hello.”
And so Trench begins another long story, sewing up loose ends: the angels’ rescue operation, the reports back to Naomi, killing Samandriel, the torture. The programming to end Dean, a plan that didn’t work out quite the way Heaven wanted it to.
before now.”
"Yeah?" Dean asks as Cas blows out, seeing his expression.
Trench hugged closer to Cas’ body.
I sat next to her, and let myself bawl, too.
“Are we a
Blood on Hannah's hands.
“No. That’s the thing, I wanted to protect him. Or something. It’s all jumbled, ‘cause I mean, he’s my dad. Was my dad. I love him, he's family.” While Mary collects her thoughts, Dean forges on. “I used to resent you a lot, you know.”
Well, Dean amends, as he watches the guy rest his head facedown on the table, he could fall into the incredibly hungover category. His impression of Sunglasses changes and he chuckles a bit in sympathy.
Gabe detaches himself from the nurse and turns to us.
"I see, you only kept me around for free labor," Dean laughs, as Mary interjects "All that food was definitely not free!"
“Take off the mask, already,” I sigh.
Since the two other players in the room seem pretty frozen, Dean works to keep the conversation moving forward. “So you knew Naomi? Is it possible that you, uh, y’know… Well, how well did you know her?”
As it is, Baby’d rather save the talking for later. She’d rather enjoy the time they have tonight, and apparently Trench wholeheartedly agrees.
So, yeah, seeing Dean again is the happiest she’s been in a while. She feels a thrill when she sees him walking toward her, when he opens her door and finally sits on her seats again. Revs the engine. She revels in the way he touches her dashboard, the overflowing love of the gesture. Happy with the knowledge that he’s safe, finally, in her embrace; she can put her year-long worry to rest. Or at least, she would be able to if Cas had appeared along with him. As it is, she keeps a little part of that worry, one that won’t be oiled until she sees Trench again, safe as well.
“It's not like you're much more talkative,” Dean says. “I never see you spilling your guts about your feelings.”
The table erupts into hooting laughter mixed with disgusted groans, mostly mine.
"Dean?" I ask, confused.
; except for the sureness with which Castiel twines their fingers together when they ride on the bus; (except for the sex.) It’s not that different, except that it is, and it’s perfect.
Without words, Dean opens his door and walks around to open Cas’. After a beat, Cas steps out and finally looks over at Dean, a tight almost-smile on his face.
“Did you hear that the angel, Castiel,
I nod.
“So do you hate me?” I ask cautiously.
“Yes?”
“He’s totally still lovesick—”
“Pretty impressive list of accomplishments there,” Bruce says, almost bashful. “D’love to hear your side of events.”
"Fine. See you girls later, yeah?" He kisses the school girl on the cheek before reluctantly stepping forward.
They tried to keep each other’s spirits up, but by the time Baby arrived in Detroit and Cas stepped out with the rest, Baby’s undercarriage was roiling with worry. And when Dean returned without Sam, slack-faced, when he slammed her door, when he called Chuck and then drove her towards Lawrence, she couldn't help but despair. She had no one to talk her through it; all she could do was move as fast as possible, and hope Dean had a plan in his head.
“Can I touch you?” Dean asks, his voice steady. He shows me his hands, proving that they’re empty. There’s a quiver in his voice. He’s shaking.
"It was like a support beam or something- Sam and I used to swing around on it all the time, pretend we were fire fighters and all that, and that pissed my dad off." Dean stops to yawn. "So he told us- he said that if it broke or bent or anything, the whole house would fall down."
There was that conversation about her Dean in Hell and the first mention of angels; there were those quiet talks between the brothers, but they always ended in wordlessness. This had always been her life, knowing only small snippets of the case before her boys came back to clean their wounds and rest, and then it was no longer relevant. But with such enormous stakes and so much going on, she feared she might never know the full story. If at some point her boys never made it back to her— she shook off the thought. They always had.
I watch as Napoleon darts back and forth, pouncing at ants as they scramble away, trying to reassemble their line. His ears twitch as he spots a fat beetle blundering across one of the stairs of the back porch. Going still, crouching low, he focuses on his prey. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
“Give me that card! I know what it said and you’re lying!”
“Dean.”
He’s reaching for his beer to have something consolatory to do with his hands when a voice from below startles him.
“Fuck!” I scream, slamming my free hand against the wall. Meg flinches.
“A chicken!”
When I get back into the club, I still feel cold, despite the sweaty heat.
Cas’ smile is a distant memory from his face; now there's confusion deep in the lines of it. “Dean, we've kissed before, and gone on several outings together that could constitute dates. We spend basically every waking hour together. As far as I'm concerned, you're more than a fling.”
And: He’s ended up the designated driver again tonight. It’s a good thing he recently got his license. At a stoplight he reaches over to the passenger seat; Dean tests John’s breathing with a finger under his nose, and finds it warm and fast. Eyes closed, John blindly pushes away his hand, but Dean repeats the test at each light, a chain of stops that leads the way home. Sammy’s still asleep in the back seat. Good, Dean thinks. School tomorrow.
And the thing is— they get along. When Baby forgets her grudge, which is often, they get along just as well as they always did. It would be so easy to let it go, to forget, to move on and not muddy their friendship. Tacitly clear the air.
Gabe grins and looks around at us. "Sorry, Cas."
Trench and Castiel were back and alive and soon as they had been killed, and her boy was healed— she could cry with joy, but with Sam sealed into Hell, she could cry forever.
But the man was already leaving the car.
“Almost two months.” I nod awkwardly, turning to face her. She looks different. Her hair is longer.
Dean sighs and clicks off. Checks his text notifications. Still no reply.
“And Lydia?”
Baby finally broke the lapsed silence after their initial hellos had faded.
I squeeze in next to Dean, who moves down on the tiny couch, barely making a difference and leaving us still pressed against each other.
“Okay, I’ve got to go talk to some people.” Meg stands up and brushes the dirt off of her from sitting on the steps
I glance both ways, scanning the people walking past for anyone dressed as Batman.
“Oh, crap!” Dean suddenly springs up, making me jump, and begins straightening out his costume. “I totally forgot about those girls I was with! I was so close to getting phone numbers! Did you see their asses, Cas?” He begins erratically trying to sort himself out and I’m left standing in shock, my pants around my knees, with my mouth open.
"He's not!" She giggles and gives me a small shove, and I stumble back onto the sand, my feet sinking in the dunes.
When Cas and Bobby showed up at the cemetery, Baby’s engine had leapt. Maybe there was hope. She and Trench locked sights, and though she was too far away to make out any communication, she could still gather strength from their presence.
"I'm not really sure. I like girls, and I barely ever think about guys in... that sense, so..." He trails off, as though he himself is unsure of what he wants to say.
Baby hiccups again.
“Yeah, that’s him.”
Sam’s voice rings through the phone, distracted. “Hey Dean.”
“So do you have a crush on me?” he jokes, but Jo doesn’t laugh.
When I spot Dean, he’s walking towards the beach, twenty feet in front of me.
00:00.
Right now they're debating musicals, (a topic Dean knows nothing about, he swears, even if he can quote Rent), heads close together, Cas stealing bacon from Dean’s plate and pretending it wasn't him. Cas laughs and Dean is caught up in how his face looks, crinkled and genuine. He has to look away before he's sucked in so he looks up, and accidentally catches the eye of guy in line who, Dean notices, is holding the hand of the man next to him. The guy smiles at him, a smile of solidarity, and Dean swallows. Snaps his eyes away.
"It's Sam. Not Sammy." Sam replies, frustratedly.
, Baby growled.
Oh God.
He's about to address the back of this guy's head with some weak attempt at conversation—'Not feeling the party either?', or a maybe lame 'it's a nice night out'—when the head turns and looks straight at Dean.
“I've obviously never been explicit about it, but I thought you felt the same way.” Cas looks uncertain, his usual bravado absent. “I move slowly and it seemed you were okay with that. I know it's rather naïve but I thought—”
He drops his voice to a whisper. “I think that dude thinks we're together.”
Dean’s hand tenses on the steering wheel at the same time as Jo digs her nails into the palm of her hand beside me. They’ve all gone quiet.
He gives Cas an eye roll and then follows Char’s lead out the room, his insides warming when he hears Castiel on his heels.
Cas looks down. “She started asking when we were going to get married." He grimaces. "We could've pretended to break up, I guess, but I couldn't help but say something. Coming out during an argument is not the greatest, but that seems to be my MO." He grins wryly, just a hint before it fades again.
As I begin to drag him towards the bathrooms, he starts to complain.
“Watch out.”
"Even so," Cas says simply.
I didnt mean it, can we talk in person I have stuff to tell you
Cas inclines his head. “It’s quite good, actually. I’m a junior, so I just declared my major in plant biology.”
By now the rest of the room has zeroed in on the drama and is waiting in a hush to see it play out. The kid continues to face forward, and into the quiet mutters, "Mendel would never betray me like this."
"Do you even like me? Because you seem way more interested in some random girls."
“I’ve been waiting all night for one of those,” Bruce says, and Dean nods at Cas, and Cas gives in, and they settle in to listen.
Dean almost chokes on his water, laughing. “Sorry about that. She interrupted me before I could warn you how intense she gets.”
“Please don’t arrest us!”
Cas cocks his head, assesses Dean. Dean feels his cheeks heat. “I guess I could be convinced.”
Well, maybe the feeling in his gut is more shame and nausea at his impulsive, destructive decisions, his inability to say what he want to, but it’s all the same. It’s all him.
I can hardly move with Dean’s body holding me in place, one hand in my hair, the other roaming around my body.
to convince myself that this is okay, that you'd even want me.”
"I don't think your alter ego can be a copyrighted character," pipes up Wonderwoman, aka Meg.
“It's not about fault. It's about will. Dean, do you really not remember?”
RE: study group?
castielnovak@uw.edu
The table is filled with laughter from everyone, once more, as well as a few 'oooooooh's, except for Gabe, who has gone dead silent.
“I don’t fuck with anyone, Cas.”
The coffee shop chatter around them is gone, it's just Dean’s anxious pulse and Cas sitting across from him, saying things that sound like they're from a silly dream he would have in high school. So why is he reacting as if this is a nightmare?
"Batman is a mortal, genius." I smirk, before realising that our faces are suddenly much closer together. I can feel Dean's panting breaths on my lips.
“It's funny.” Cas is staring right at him. “You grew up with a loving family, right? For the most part. And yet you're still so emotionally reserved.”
“I thought you’d make fun of me.”
"You're insufferable." I state plainly.
Cas looks stricken, but tries to exit the conversation gracefully. “I misinterpreted, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume your friendship meant anything more—”
Cas finally smiles back, full and bright on his face. “Okay. If you swear.”
Let's do this.
When she watches Dean help Cas out of the car, she feels nothing. When she watches Cas leave the bunker, so soon, sorrow on his face, she feels nothing. She just watches him go, sees the evidence of his humanity in the way he holds himself. She feels nothing at that, either— only mourns the fact that he can’t create matter anymore, that he can’t fly, that he doesn’t have the power to bring Trench back to her. She just mourns.
“He thought we were queers!”
"Adam..." She leant over him, putting her face near his.
“Well, cool. I thought you were gonna tell me something depressing. You know that this isn’t a huge shock, right?”
"Just get Sam," Dean continues, halfway across the square by now.
The shadow darts around, landing on the mirror, before smashing it. Metal falls to the ground, turning to blue china. I stumble out of the room, and find myself staring at the door that I’ve been so desperate to get away from for weeks. John’s room.
“She asked if we could open our relationship,” Benny replies.
Baby waited; there was silence for a bit too long.
MacLeod considers him, an amused yet somehow sarcastic look on his face, and asks, "The class was talking about X-linked genetic diseases and conditions. Would you like to offer an example? Or is the table grain more interesting?"
“I lived it, Cas. Okay, I know what happened.”
Realistically, I have no answer for that. I could go to Memphis and live in a hotel and write prose all day long. I could lock myself in my room until I’ve built my computer and refuse to talk to anyone and get my mother to pass me my dinner through a slot in my door. Hell, I could laze around in Dean’s bed forever, watching his eyes dart around the room.
He falls silent as he keeps reading, before letting out a deep breath.
“Oh, honey, why didn’t you say anything? I would’ve talked sense into him or fought for better custody—”
“Jesus, my arms hurt. You couldn’t have let me in quicker?” He shakes his wrists, rubbing them.
“And you’ll tell them what? That you want an en suite bathroom and, oh, a crib and high chair, too?”
"Cas?" he asks again.
And: Bobby teaches him how to shave.
Dean jumps on him the second he’s in Cas’ apartment. After some adjustment to that surprise, Cas scoots over on the couch so they can both, barely, fit.
In a way, there are some similarities. Everything about a girl is soft, and Dean is soft too. At least, his lips, his skin, and his hair.
I lift the gun in the air, I aim at the attic—
“At Easter, when me and Sam and Dad went to New York for the vacation. I met this guy, and he taught me a Hell of a lot. More than any girl from around here.” Dean smiles fondly at the memory, and I blush as I feel myself twitching at the idea of Dean doing things with a stranger in New York.
Bring, briiing!
Thursday 11th June 1981
“Dad’s having an affair! She’s blonde! Big tits, too!” I blurt out, my grin replaced with a cheeky smile.
FWD: RE: RE: Christmas?
by being successful." Cas sighs.
I reach into the freezer and pull out two popsicles, not caring that it's cold out. Hannah and I love popsicles, and neither the cold nor our parents have ever been able to stop us.
He’s not sure why he reacted so strongly, but he’s still stubborn about it. He’s not boyfriend material, he never will be, he didn’t come from it and he just wasn’t made for it. And he can prove that.
Baby throws out the topic, for Trench to pick up.
"What? Come on, that's not fair!"
“I’m going to college-“
Dean quirks his eyebrow in a question.
It’s a beautiful morning. Baby rolls down the road without a care, windows down, Trench in her passenger seat. Nothing could get better than this.
Adam's eyes were glazed over, half open and cold. His skinny arms were pale and wet. And his face.
"It's Sam."
Baby glows.
I glance over at Jo and Gabe. They’re laughing as Jo attempts to toss mini pretzels into his mouth, cheering and clapping when he succeeds.
I nod and shrug.
They drive, and she falls into the rhythm of a hunt. Goes through the motions. The two work easily around each other, she can’t help but note. She’s happy about that, in a detached way. That’s about as happy as she can be nowadays.
“It doesn't excuse my behavior, okay? But I felt trapped when you kept talking about us being
Music pours out through the speakers of our sixth stop of the night, The Blue Velvet. It's a big club on the Boardwalk, known for its glitter-covered ceiling and podiums for GoGo dancers to stand on. Some pop song that I don't recognise penetrates my ear drums as I push my way back through the crowd from the bar. I carry a drink in either hand, unsure of what they are, but certain that I'll get drunk off of it.
"It's where I belonged. I needed to do penance. After the things I did on Earth and in Heaven, I didn't deserve to be out. And I saw that clearly when I was there. I... I planned to stay all along. I just didn't know how to tell you.”
“Happy Thanksgiving, mom.”
As I lose myself in the art of blueprinting, I almost fail to hear the rapping at my window. It sounds like leaves knocking against it on a windy day, but louder. I carefully put the sketchbook down and edge my way towards the window, careful to be quiet. Maybe it's an owl, or squirrel.
The only sound was Baby's wheels on the asphalt as they rolled closer to some Djinn in Omaha, the traitorous Castiel in the passenger seat. Baby could overheat just thinking about it—
“Time flies, eh? We should probably go back inside now.” Hannah starts to shuffle down towards the edge of the roof. She frowns up at me. “Aren’t you coming, Cas?”
Baby looked out at the vegetation as she sped past it.
My mother pretended that everything was normal:  chattering about her book club, the weather, the fucking TV shows she had watched. Once I asked her if she hated me and she replied, very diplomatically, that no, she was just disappointed. That made me laugh. She clearly hadn’t learnt her lesson.
I’m not even surprised to see Batman hanging off the bit of roof beneath my window, which I open enough to stick my head and shoulders out. It’s freezing, and being almost naked doesn’t help.
They talk about everything. That's one of the things he loves—likes—most about Cas, the fact that they can talk forever and never run out of topics; everything sounds interesting in his voice.
"Never have I ever... fingered a girl." He and Dean take drinks immediately, followed by me slowly sipping at mine.
“What about that time we got new neighbors and Dad said he was lucky he didn't have a queer for a son like they did?” Dean almost chokes on the word, but manages. “Or the time he caught me making out with a boy and threatened to beat me into next Sunday? So yeah, pretty sure he would hate me if he knew.”
Cas nods. How can anyone communicate that much hurt in a nod? “Alright,” he says stiffly. “Good for you.” And then he walks away again.
-They also mention the Roe v. Wade case. This was a landmark court case on the issue of abortion.
Nothing.
“You ready?”
I glance at my watch. 10:15.
Cas cocks an eyebrow.
Dean waves his hand, dismissing the issue. “We get it. I guess. Um,” he turns to Cas, “I’m gonna give you guys some space, is that alright?”
She wracks her internal mechanisms for some plausible explanation, but there is none. Wherever Trench is now, they won't be coming back. And with Cas having abandoned them, Trench will no doubt cease to be an Object and go back to just a scrap of cloth at the bottom of some bin, If they’re still intact at all.
"Dude, Sam's twelve!"
As I reach it, I take a deep breath, count to three, and rip the curtains apart, to reveal the culprit. It's definitely not an owl.
“I’m not late, I’m exactly on time. Somehow, you’re all early.” He rushes hurriedly to the fourth seat and puts down the books in his arms.
"My mother wants to see me succeed, and her family has told her the only way I can do that is to become a doctor, lawyer, or CEO. So those are my choices," Cas laughs bitterly, taking a long inhale.
It’s just— he knows he likes guys, obviously. He’s been drawn to Cas since they met, and a few other passing flirtations before him. But that’s the thing: Cas isn’t a passing flirtation. Dean likes him a lot and that’s frightening, and he didn't fully realize until Cas confronted him with it, and he’s gone and sabotaged himself. Really, he doesn’t have a great track record for relationships, and it seems hereditary. It’s in his genes at this point. He can feel it in his gut.
He wants to do it, fall on his knees, but— He looks over at Lydia and her polite, confused smile, and he can't. He's sure she'd be accepting, but that logic doesn't combat the discomfort prickling under his skin at doing this in public.
"So that makes you a devil, huh," Dean snorts.
With that, Dean turns his attention back to the lecture, and Cas settles his head into the cradle of his arms on the desk. Dean hears a muffled "Noted" from his left and smiles, ducking his head to continue his notes.
“Damn.”
“I’m sorry,” I whisper, unsure of what I’m apologizing for. It’s hard to keep track, when I’ve screwed her over so many times.
“And I can set up a way for you to ask her that’s a bit more private than study group.”
The Christmas party is less awkward than Dean had expected, honestly. They found the place easily this time, and were surprised to see it all-out decorated. There are garlands strung around the windows, lights hanging from the roof edge, a wreath on the front door. It smells like pine and ocean, and the warm light inside is welcoming. People are already milling around, chatting as they walk in and out the open door and eat off paper plates.
"Cherry."
But their luck holds— the boys open and close her trunk, getting weapons and stowing them, and still Trench remains. Well, Baby and Trench’s luck holds if only because Dean and Sam have their hands full and overflowing with various monsters, but it’s something.
Dean freezes. He can feel his face heat up, his pulse the focus of his body. “What?”
It seems like a trap, but Dean’s quite alright with falling for it. “Very.” He leans forward and for an instant he’s not sure that Cas is leaning too, —a long instant of second-guessing himself, —until finally their lips touch and—
