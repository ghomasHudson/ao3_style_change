Dean moaned, blinking at the ceiling to keep the fresh tears at bay as Cas’ mouth latched onto one of his nipples.
“Yes. I… I wanted to know more before meeting you.”
Dean swallowed a snark reply and complied, shoving his hands through the opening and soon feeling the cold handcuffs locking with a click around his wrists.
Bobby put down the map, taking off his baseball cap long enough to scratch the top of his head. “Can’t be right. We must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.”
“Care about you?” Dean said, voice a fraction deeper as he held Cas’ gaze. Surprise flashed on the other’s face before it faded into a tender look. “That’s what I found in the Keeper.” Dean bit the inside of his cheek. The words,
Castiel distracted himself by checking his wings to keep himself from dwelling on the man following close. When he was satisfied with his examination, he flapped his wings once before folding them neatly behind him. He could never do that inside the fort; most times, it felt like his wings were incarcerated. That’s why he enjoyed the outdoors so much, the rooftop of the Keeper being one of his favorite spots. Bound to this earthly body had restrained him in so many ways, but at least he still had his wings, and Castiel loved to put them to use as much as he could.
“Deal,” Cas said, voice smiling.
“You don’t need fixing, Dean. But either way… I can’t change it and certainly not humankind.” Cas drew invisible circles with his finger against his leg, eyes watching Dean’s chest rise and fall. “I…” He gulped visibly before folding his hands in his lap. “I think it’s time for me to leave…”
“I killed my parents,” he murmured the truth about himself, the confession he had kept from everyone except Sam and Bobby. But there was something about Cas that kept him from lying, from omitting a damned thing about himself. “I was four at the time. Some burglars got in, and I got hurt and… my necklace…” He grabbed the large, dark stone with his free hand. “My mum yanked it from me to save my life, and I ended up going human torch on everyone. And even though my dad was already dead by then, it feels like I did it myself.”
"But- I killed hundreds of them! Angels! Yes, even people!" - His voice was about to discharge. To rise up and take on an angry, even mocking tone, directed at no one but himself. He hated himself for all that he had done. As much as he had never hated anyone before. And he just did not understand. He did not understand how God could forgive him only when he himself did not even do it. He could never wash away the sins he had committed. And he was sure that he never deserved it. He didn't deserve to have anyone forgive him. Especially God.
"Do you think it was a coincidence that you, of all people, were hired to bring him out of hell? It was fate" - Castiel had to turn his nose up at those words. - " I'm out of sorts with her ." "Not the goddess. It was simply your destiny to meet. For it is he who defines you. He's the one you rebelled for. You went through purgatory for him. And for him, you would close the gates of heaven over and over again" - Actually, Castiel would have disagreed now, but he was far too surprised that not even a word could leave his lips. For it was increasingly obvious who Cupid was talking about. And yet Castiel had doubts - not sure if it was only because he didn't want to admit it to himself - until Cupid spoke out the obvious. - "Dean Winchester" -- Cupid pauses. And castiel was sure that during this time he wanted to give him the chance to process the information first. Maybe he was using the dramatic pause to heighten the suspense. Actually, Castiel didn't care why Cupid did it. Because right now, it seemed like he was starting to see the light. A light so bright, it was like a blazing flame. - "He is the reason for everything. It's all about Dean" - And Cupid was right. No matter what castiel did or how hard he tried to spin this, it was always about dean. either protecting him,proving something,or being the one to hold him down. Always Dean.
"Those are nothing more than flimsy excuses," Dean spoke bitterly as he turned away from him again. - "What do you think I should have done?" - Castiel was now clearly annoyed. Because no matter what he said, whether it was true or not, it just seemed to bounce off Dean. He was completely resistant to any kind of truth. Because it wasn't his. What else was Castiel supposed to do? What could he say that would make Dean finally see that he had never had a choice but to act the way he did? Dean seemed not to have the complete whole in the view. He always acted according to his feelings, without thinking about the consequences of his actions. And that annoyed Castiel almost more. Because Dean's next words proved that all too clearly. And they hurt deep inside him. - "Let them live!" he threw back at him furiously, looking at him from angry eyes that almost sparked green. His jaw was tense, his teeth clenched so tightly he should have been almost convulsing. But Dean held himself back. He tried not to rage too much, yet forcefully make his point. - " And let you die instead?" - "Yes!" - The words came over his lips without him giving it much thought. It was the first thing that came to his mind and he meant it. After all, it wouldn't be the first time he died and it would have saved thousands of people's lives. So many people for the life of one. Dean felt sick again. And the icy silence above them stretched. For seconds that felt like minutes and those like hours, Castiel stared into Dean's eyes that were so full of pain and despair that the angel could do no more than continue to stare into that unfathomable green. Hoping to glimpse something else in them. But he found nothing. And Castiel had no answer to his words either. In fact, he should be surprised that Dean thought that way. He should be angry at him for throwing his life away so quickly, even though it was clear from the first hour that he was destined for something great. But he didn't. Because he would never have expected anything else from Dean. Why should he? Dean had always been like that. Always careful that no one came to harm because of him. But what man wasn't? No one wanted another to suffer for him. If the person was in his right mind.
“Good.” Dean sighed. “Now, I need to go back to work before my boss fires my sorry ass. Only half-an-hour, it will be quick, you’ll see,” he promised.
“That’s usually what happens between two people who don’t know each other—”
Castiel had left earlier to have breakfast before meeting Dean by the back exit.
“News travels fast in a small town.” Sam had the decency of looking sheepish.
“Shit,” Dean hissed. “I’m so close; keep going.”
“Only a few bumps and bruises.” He tried for casual.
As he closed his eyes and curled around himself on the mattress that seemed too empty now, he wished the sense of belonging he had left behind in that hotel room would return to him one day.
Dean broke half a french fry with his teeth and chewed with his mouth open, exactly how Sam hated. “Whatever, bitch.”
“Dean…” came the whimper.
“Very well,” the man agreed suddenly. He got up, swaying precariously before giving them a tight smile. “Can you just…” He clutched the clothes to his chest, smile turning sheepish, “Can you give me some privacy?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“That’s because the blade that cut me was adamantium steel. Merfolk are particularly vulnerable to that type of weapon.”
“No!” Castiel also drifted closer because no matter what, Dean had always been a magnet to him. Even as he tried to push Dean away, Castiel was still drawn to him. “I’m here. I’m doing this. Lucifer needs to be taken down, and if that requires an angel sacrifice, I’m the only one around to do it. You are all going back; it’s decided.”
Dean leaned back, dumbstruck. “How—”
The spotlight moved then and shone directly on the group of attackers, allowing Dean to distinguish three people standing in front of the vehicle and another sitting in the driver’s seat. The smaller one — a petite brunette with a devious smile and a gun clasped between her fingers stepped forward.
have an angelic sacrifice. Lucifer probably knows this; that’s why he wants to meet with you, to kill you before you have the chance to interfere. I would say you need to get the jump on him before he has the chance to screw things for us. You need to kill him first.”
“I don’t see a watchtower from here,” Castiel interrupted. Which was a completely different tangent to what they were talking about but okay. That was something Castiel seemed to do when the conversation got the slightest bit uncomfortable. As much as it gave Dean fucking whiplash, he would gladly oblige as long as it took away some of Castiel’s worries. “I clearly saw one from the infirmary but not from here,” he carried on, oblivious to Dean’s confusion. His voice was filled with coldness, similar to when they were back in the infirmary. None of the amiability wrapping it just minutes ago. Castiel studied the outside view, a line of tension working the muscles in his shoulders. He reminded Dean of the soldiers from back in the day. Most of them had died in the war that followed the first years of the outbreak. Nearly all those who didn’t die were now part of the brainless faction they once tried to extinguish.
There had always been a darkness hovering around Dean, like a dark cloud overcasting everything he was in shadows. It was always there; Dean could feel it, throbbing in the back of his head. In a way, Dean knew from the moment he was born that he had been meant for it, for the calamity to come — for the catastrophe he would become — and all his life had been like the silent, ephemeral moment that proceeds a storm.
“No problem, man, I’ll be right back.”
“Angels are warriors of God, and we don’t have halos,” Castiel stated, glancing at Dean. “And I’m a Seraph, to be more exact.”
“So, uh,” Dean cleared his throat, not sure if Cas was already asleep by now. “When you said you’re staying here, you mean, like… a day, a week?”
Castiel briefly closed his eyes. He gulped around the lump in his throat, forcing himself to speak again, ignoring his twisting gut. “We learn something as angels. That time is an infinite thing. It keeps running endlessly. In my time with you, I found something truly everlasting — my love for you. That will always remain with you, Dean. I’ll always be with you until you find happiness again, and I know you will.”
Cas shook his head to the sky. “I understand the curiosity.”
“I know that!” Dean nodded once. “I truly do. I mean, I’m pretty sure you could kick everyone’s asses if you wanted to.”
But at thirty-four years old, Castiel had always had a clear back.
The man ambled forward; something in the way he held himself displayed deadly confidence that made all the hair on Dean’s skin stand on end. The man was shorter than Dean but somehow seemed to loom over him even through the gap of space left between them.
They would curl up on the sofa, feet tucked under each other, arms lazily draped over the other, watching the crappy tv shows that only aired at two in the morning because they felt too comfortable to get up and go to bed. Or snuggling under a blanket, watching Dean’s favorite new show, Doctor Sexy, eating popcorn, Cas making exasperated little noises every five minutes, before having enough and leaning against Dean, kissing his neck. His teeth tugging his earlobe until Dean couldn’t take it anymore and took Cas’ mouth in his, heated, long kisses that turned into full make-out sessions, which usually ended up in the bedroom where the kisses turned into soft, slow lovemaking or a hard, eager fuck.
“Oh, I see,” Cas said, probably thinking Dean was as much of a dick as Dean was feeling.
“No.”
“Sorry they’re gone, man…”
“I asked if you knew merfolk have been at war with each other for a while now?”
For Dean, this kind of crap had always fueled his personal hatred against the finned-creatures. Until very recently he would probably spew the first
The man released a breath and covered Dean’s hand, still against his chest, with his. The gentle thud-thud beating against Dean’s palm helped to calm the rapid rhythm of his own heart as Dean held his breath, feeling slender, warm fingers wrap around his. “Is this another dream?” the hoarse, gravelly voice asked, and Dean wondered idly if the stranger had dreamed of him before.
“Star Wars,” someone said.
“You did too.”
“W—wait, what?” Jody stammered.
“We don’t know for sure…”
Dean drove around aimlessly for a while longer, not wanting to return just yet. He bought take out at a nearby drive-through and stopped with his late lunch of hamburger and French fries at the Lilyville local park, choosing a spot with a view over the whole town. He sat on top of Baby’s hood and quietly dug in, watching the lazy, golden afternoon sun turn coral-red.
“Today sucked, Cas.” Dean let out a mirthless laugh.
Kevin stared at Dean for a few uncomfortable beats, probably deciding if Dean had gone insane. “You shouldn’t have brought him here,” he stated finally. “You’re putting the whole group at risk.”
“You got me.” He took the small package from his pocket and handed it to Sarah.
There were new streaks of dry tears along his cheeks as he sunk to one knee on the ground, hand splayed against the wall, the cold easing the ache and the shakiness. He shut his eyes tight, gasping around another sob, giving himself a moment, allowing his body to get itself together, fingers around the dark stone of his necklace.
“How you doin’?” he asked, nervous.
Firm fingers curled around Dean’s shoulder and Sam was suddenly close, looking down at him. Dean hadn’t even realized he had drawn this near; his whole body was fixated on steadying his ragged breaths, his fingers easing the grasp around the bottle of beer as he kept the tears under lock, never to see the light of day.
“You can work here.” Charlie approached them, placing their orders in front of them. “Gilda helps me when she can, but she has her work at the library…” She folded her arms across her chest, drumming her fingers against her forearm. “We were actually thinking about hiring someone. Besides,” she sent a meaningful look at Dean, “working at the bar can be quite… inappropriate.”
Cas shrugged. “You want me to lie?”
Dean led the way back inside, one arm clasped around the man’s back, the other beneath his legs, feeling the ever so delicate breaths grazing his neck and trailing his spine with a warm chill.
“You’re not a prisoner here…” Dean made another attempt. “I meant it as… I don’t want you to get hurt again.”
“He didn’t have to.” Cas shook his head. “I offered myself.”
Dean thought; there was no stopping them now. There were too many Croats to fight off, but no matter what, Dean couldn’t bring himself to kill Cas.
The weight of Lucifer’s words drove daggers through his chest, and Dean kept his focus on the dirt beneath his feet. The smudged face of a clown smiled brightly at him from the battered poster lying on the ground as he tried to control his shallow, labored breaths, his clouded vision, the pulsing of his heartbeat drumming in his ears.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice emerged through his thoughts. “W—what—” Dean was looking at him. He had regained consciousness while Castiel got the rest of his grace back. The explosion that had followed probably had been enough to snap Dean out of his trance.
Dean could imagine her nodding. “You must think I’m stupid for doing what I did…”
“You sonuvabitch!” Dean stormed toward him, grabbing him by the collar, his vice grip daring Gordon to fight back. “This is why we have rules!” he hissed, the muscles in his jaw tightening as he resisted Sam and Bobby’s attempts to separate them. “Lemme go, I’m gonna kick his ass,” he yelled. “This is why you don’t take rookies into a hot zone! What were you thinking?!”
A wave of sorrow soaked the reply.
Dean wasn’t sure what to say. Or even if he wanted to say anything at all. Things were already complicated as it was, without any more confessions or flashbacks from the night they had spent together. So Dean gulped his coffee instead, welcoming the bitter taste burning the back of his throat on the way down.
Dean restricted his search to the first three floors. The recreation area was a no go, but the kitchen had been a gold mine — pans, glasses, cutlery, several sizes of bowls, and a ‘Kiss the cook’ apron Dean was sure would make Ellen freak out. He took a couple of new chairs from the dining room, and between the mahogany tables he carried into the truck and Bela and Charlie’s various finds, the two vehicles were almost completely full.
“Wouldja stop, kiddo?” Bobby held up a hand.
A cold shiver ran down Dean’s spine. The fallen one. It didn’t take a genius to figure out that it was Cas. Cas was a fallen angel that had been outcast from heaven by his peers. Maybe someone had figured out he was an angel and wanted to take advantage of his powers. Or perhaps even worse, it was one of the assholes from upstairs wanting to finish what they had started, waging some kind of retaliation against him.
They took one of the free tables on the far right corner in silence. Dean took a sip of his coffee and closed his eyes, already feeling the beginning of a headache kicking in. “You know?” Charlie spoke after a while. “I hate agreeing with Gordon, but he’s right. Maybe we need to go to Agora.”
Dean nodded even though he couldn’t remember anything after he had blacked out, but he was pretty sure the fact that Cas was there by his side had something to do with it too. He sighed steadily and settled back into the pillow; his eyelids felt heavy. “For once, something went right.”
Dean pressed his lips together, seemingly troubled to find his voice in the middle of the thick emotions filling the very air between them. “I…” He swallowed hard and gave it another try, “Who knew a feather would know so much about me?” he settled for the admission, and Castiel’s heart all but exploded.
The horde of Croats came out of nowhere, and before Frank knew it, he was not only cornered but bitten too. He had killed himself after saying his goodbyes to everyone.
Dean shivered, and Cas leaned closer, shoulders flexing, an almost imperceptible movement against the dark sky, and then the invisible cocoon of warmth that had wrapped itself around Dean when they were in bed was back, making him stop shivering.
Dean stood up. “Then maybe I should walk your ass outta the door,” Dean said calmly, staring him down.
When Dean opened his eyes again Cas was rutting lazily up into him, kissing his temple with such tenderness it filled Dean’s chest with an intoxicating ache. The orgasm had been bliss; his body was more relaxed than it had been in years, his muscles were calming, his brain flooding with something close to being high. This was heaven, Dean was sure.
“Hands,” came the terse order from the other side.
“Yes, Lisa for exam—”
A feeling of urgency put a brake on all the emotions that had flooded the back of Castiel’s mind just a moment before.
“Didn’t stop me from killing them.”
“Nah, uh.” Charlie shook her head and took it back, fast enough for the paper’s edge to slide past Dean’s skin.
“You’re welcome,” Cas replied just as low, hand coming to meet Dean’s cheek, thumb tracing the path of one tear until it was all gone and their eyes were locked on each other. “I wish I could make it better,” he said, trailing with his finger along another fresh, wet path on Dean’s skin.
Dean took out his gun just in case. In a place like this, shooting was probably more harmful than not — shooting meant noise, and more noise could attract even more groups nearby.
Another push of lips against lips, breathing into the man until the human suddenly gasped in an explosion of life. Everything came to a halt when the man opened his eyes and Castiel found himself gazing down into wild, leafy-spring shades of emerald with sprinkles of gold, condensed into the most beautiful green eyes he had ever seen.
"But- It can't be. Why would God do such a thing?" - Castiel was spinning. The mention of God and the fact that he was still out there, even keeping an eye on him, made Castiel feel something he hadn't felt in a long time. Hope. - "Think of it as a small thank-you," Cupid said, even as if he didn't know about Castiel's inner chaos. - "Thank you"? for what?" - "For being who you are." If this situation weren't so completely absurd, Castiel might have laughed. But he never said a word. Not even a sniveling gasp did he utter. He stared lightly at the sky almost as if he wanted to see God somewhere in that darkness, who explained this whole farce to him. But there was nothing but darkness. Not even a constellation could be seen in the sky. - "God is watching you, Castiel. "for a long time. He knows what you have done" - Now he laughed, but only to look down in shame. Anywhere but those piercing, brown eyes, which despite their dark tone seemed to cut through the gloomy air, only to look straight into him. As if he could see everything in him and there was no way out. And he would see all these cruel deeds Cas had committed. See all these people, angels and all the other beings he had harmed. - "He is very impressed with you. It has been centuries since there was an angel like you, who is so exalted to God and yet so human, as only one of God's creations can be. He is sure you are the embodiment of his will" - Castiel looked up. He could never be serious. None of what he had done could really be God's will. He had cheated heaven, lied and destroyed almost everything. And why? Because he thought he could do it better than anyone else. In his pride, he had thought he was greater than his brothers and sisters. Something greater than God himself. And that's supposed to impress his father?
______________________________________________________________________________
Dean knows that they have to talk about Cas’s confession eventually. He doesn’t know whether he should wait til they’re back at the bunker or now. Now that Cas was human he knew that whatever he felt was really Cas and not some special angelic thing. If he really did mean it like that then Dean knew he would have to address his feelings out loud to Cas. Something he didn’t know if he was ready for after years of pretending he felt nothing more then a friendship for Cas. Suddenly He pulled over to the side of the road. Cas looks at Dean and tilts his head in confusion.
“I know that look,” Deans insists, handing him a fork, “It’s the face you make before you talk something serious.”
“What?” Cas asks with a look of horror on his face.
“Bitch” Dean says smiling a little, wiping pie off his face.
______________________________________________________________________________
“Oh also how’s Jody’s and Eileen’s hunt going?” Deans asks trying to keep the mood light.
Watching the sunset they realize that none of them had lived the life they thought they were for so long. Dean was Daddy’s loyal soldier, ladies man traveling from city to city killing monsters, prepared to die young on some hunt gone wrong. Now he’s in love with a former angel, ready to settle down and retire. Sam planned on studying to be a lawyer and live a perfect apple pie life, never to look back at his old life. But his brother came back and he spent 15 years living with him on the road with him, now settled and in love with another hunter, studying witchcraft. Castiel, for so long he was just a shield of God, obedient soldier to heaven, sent to pull Dean from hell and nothing else. Human now after rebelling from heaven,  finding free will, love, and his own family. Eileen who lost her family and her hearing to a Banshee finally got her revenge and proved herself to be a great hunter. She is in love and happy with her job and her found family. And Jack, Son of Lucifer, destined to be all powerful, either save the world or destroy it. They gave up their God powers to just live on earth with his dads, trying to be a normal kid. Even though it’s not what they thought, It was perfect because they chose it themselves. They are the happiest they’ve ever been or ever thought they could, because they could finally write their own story.
"Hello, Dean" - And that was the last straw. Without knowing where it came from, Dean's anger at Castiel and the world only grew. He stared at him, with a face that would only clearly show Castiel how he was feeling right now. Angry, hopeless, abandoned. And not only by the world, which had once again taken away the people who meant so much to him, as only a family did. No, also by Castiel. And this apathetic face that looked at him, although he felt so many emotions arise in him at the same time, gave him a sting. He looked at an angel, a man who had just killed thousands of people. And all for Dean's sake.
14.12.2016
"You don't have to" - How could he make Dean understand that? Castiel would try everything to finally make him see. Because all these sacrifices would never be in vain. Dean was part of a much larger destiny and he had to survive. It was important for the world' s continued existence. It was important to Castiel. Most importantly, it was for Castiel. - "None of this is your fault" - Castiel dared to take another step towards Dean. He hoped he wouldn't back away and allow the closeness he was sure was what Dean needed right now. He needed the hold to keep from falling and sinking into the bottomless pit as he had done so many times before. Dean wondered to himself how it was that he hadn't sunk into oblivion long ago, but the answer to that was simple. Almost too simple. Because it was Castiel who helped him back to his feet every time, dragging him up with all the strength he had, no matter how firmly Dean was stuck in the darkness. And he would do it again now. He would do it again and again. Every time, all over again. Even if it wore out his strength. He would bring Dean back from hell every time. - "Of course it is. You killed them for my safety" - But when would he realize that? - "Dean, this has nothing to do with you-" - Why didn't he just listen to him? When was this Winchester going to learn to understand? - "It does! If you'd just let it have its way, Ellen and Jo would still be alive right now" - "Dean-" - He should just listen. - "And Bobby wouldn't be so lonely and unhappy" - "It's-" - He wouldn't let Castiel have the chance to speak. He had already spoken himself into a rage far too much, and he would not rest until he had given vent to it. - "Why did you kill those people? It wasn't worth it!" - Now Castiel was losing his temper, too. He would just make Dean listen to him! - "Yes it is! If it's about you, I'd kill every living thing in every possible dimension if it meant you were safe!" - An icy silence spread over them. Dean was simply speechless. He had not expected such an outburst from Castiel. It rarely happened that Castiel expressed his feelings so strongly and especially in the form of an outburst of rage. Castiel himself turned his eyes away. He struggled with himself and his words. Unpleasantly touched that he had let himself go like that. It was not in his nature to become loud. Especially not towards Dean. But he just couldn't stand it any longer. Not when Dean said things like that. - "Dean, it's so- You're- All of this- is so incredibly hard"- Again, a silence came over them, less icy but no less uncomfortable. How was he supposed to start this? Should he even say it? It would change everything, Castiel knew that. Still, he couldn't go on like this. It weighed on him immensely, even if he tried to hide it all, especially from Dean. But it hurt. He felt a pain in his chest that he had never felt in the thousands of years he had already lived. And it was a pain that only occurred in association with Dean. Since that moment- - "Since the moment I grabbed you by the shoulder, pulled you out of hell, and burned my grace into your skin, I've protected you. I always came when you called. I am loyal to you. As loyal as I usually am to my father. But not because I have to. I do it out of faith and trust in you" - Castiel looked intensely into Dean's eyes. Searching for an emotional movement in which he could perhaps interpret whether he had better break off here or possibly risk it. But except for astonishment and a hint of understanding he could see nothing in this deep green that shimmered against the sun that slowly sank behind the junkyard where they still stood and spread an increasingly dim light around them.
“What? I never use all the hot water” Sam claims
“Umm Dean?” Sam says, making Dean turn towards  “Don’t you want to change and take a shower before we go?”
Cas and Dean sit next to each other in the Impala. Going home from the spell sight now in uncomfortable silence, both their eyes looking straight ahead, unmoving. To break the tension Dean turns on the radio forgetting that he still had the mixtape he made Cas playing. He quickly hits the eject button and puts the mixtape back in the case. Reaching over the seat and offers it to Cas.
And even though Cas wasn’t an angel anymore, he can tell exactly what’s in Dean’s heart. It wasn’t exactly how Dean wanted it to go, but that didn’t seem to matter to Cas. They had time to talk about it later and Dean could say everything he wanted when he was ready. This time Cas leans in and kisses Dean; the kiss is deep and passionate. All the years of unspoken love coming out, all the repressed feelings finally being shown.
Dean wakes with a jump, eyes still foggy and red from last night. Books are thrown all around him in the library and there’s a half drunk bottle of whiskey next to his computer. The familiar smell of old alcohol mixed with books makes him sick as he sits up to see Sam looking at him concerned. Last thing he remembers is grabbing that bottle out the fridge while researching how to get Cas out of the Empty. Head cloudy and still stiff from sleeping at the table, Dean yawns and stretches as Miracle runs in and jumps on his lap. He hugs her with a tiny smile, burying his face in her soft fur, before she settles in the chair next to him.
“Dean this is the third day in a row you’ve stayed up all night researching, you’ve barely gotten any sleep this week.” Sam says.
“Hey, do you remember anything from when you were down there.” Dean asks trying to sound casual again.
“Because we know, unlike your brother, you actually care about humanity and you know what we’re capable of.” Dean steps closer to her, “When we came to you for help taking down Chuck you agreed. You changed.”
“Dean, Dean.” Sam shouts while shaking his brother.
“Yes Sammy, I’m sure. I’ll be fine” Dean says watching the light reflect off the angel blade before putting in the bag.
“What you said to me before you were taken. Do you still feel that now, or was it an angel thing?” Dean asks quickly.
“It’s a gift, remember? You keep those.” Dean says still looking at the road.
“Umm, we’re still kind of taking it slow.” Sam replies, looking at Dean, nodding, “Also I haven’t told Eileen about this yet so do you mind if I…” Sam starts before Dean waves him off.
“Was that Sam?” Cas asks as Dean puts the car in drive again.
“What? Dean, I’ve thought about it too and I think that maybe we should try to call Jack-”
“Yeah, but I still shouldn’t have acted like that, I- I should have tried to understand.” Dean tells them looking down, “I was wrong and I’m really sorry Jack.”
“Cas, you are so much more than whatever angel powers you have,” He says almost reading his mind, “you deserve to be saved.”
So I’m revising again and I changed the timeline a lot by switching chapters around and stuff, and I just realized that Sam and Dean said I love you to their partners at the same time. I did not mean to do that but I find it really cute now.
“I know, and I’m done worshiping him Sam.” he starts, “He… he could never get over mom’s death and because of that he could never be a father, only a drill sergeant. He was a horrible father Sam and I wish I could have realized that sooner.”
“And I’m worried about how he’ll react.” Sam says honestly, “Last time something like this happened, it didn’t go so well.” Sam continues thinking about the time he drank demon blood.
______________________________________________________________________________
“Well then, let’s dig in.” Dean says, handing Sam and Elieen a fork.
Dean starts eating the pies again quickly, talking with Sam and Eileen. He feels a peg of guilt again, he feels happy while Cas is dead. Before he can feel worse he feels a pie his his face. He turns to look at Sam, who’s high-fives and laughs with Eileen.
Sam smiles at her before, hoping to ask if she’d want to retire and settle down with him too before she quietly signs-
“Yeah, I think we all need coffee.” He says giving her a tired smile.
The light of his grace shines as it leaves his body. Dean and the empty both stare as the grace floats into the bottle. After his grace is fully drained, he shakes and starts to faint. Dean gets up and grabs him before he falls over, putting his arm around his back and his other hand on his shoulder to keep him from falling. After making sure Cas was ok he picks up his grace and gives it to the empty.
“Really?” Sam says, sounding surprised.
Cas turns to meet Dean green eyes again, still amazed every time he sees him since he’s pulled him out. Dean is the most beautiful human Cas ever seen and his beauty hasn’t faded at all. Every single thing about him was perfect, his light freckles and legs that were never quite straight, Cas wouldn’t change a thing about him-
“Hello Dean” Cas says just like he always does
, But now that it was actually happening he couldn’t say anything. He opened his mouth and no words came out, it felt like they were getting stuck somewhere just like they did right before the empty took him. He was able to do it in the prayer, why not now? Dean turns and sees Cas’s face in the window’s reflection, the same look he had when he remembered he freed the livithians and realized Jack killed Mary. The look that was full of guilt and regret that he usually had when Dean was mad, but this time it broke his heart.
“I made you some coffee.” Sam says sliding the mug over to Dean
Sam smiles at her again as she turns around, He realized he loves her when he called her after Chuck turned her into dust. She’s strong and kind and everything Sam could want in a person. He wants to spend the rest of his life and with her. He has been learning how to sign ‘I love you’ and other things but doesn’t know when the right time is. He taps her on the shoulder about to tell her-
“What's wrong Sam?” Dean says once he sits down.
“Yeah, sounds good man, I’ll get my coat and pack the car” he started walking to the door
“I don’t think he’ll take a break,” Sam says to her, “but I think he might need one.”
“Cas?” Dean whispers nervously.
“You ready?” Sam asks Dean as they pull into the parking lot.
Dean shakes his head before taking another drink, “Monsters are crazy man.”
A quick glance in Castiel's direction showed him a relaxed angel. Dean thought he had never seen Castiel so relaxed in his chair. And even his tired eyes suddenly seemed a little less tired, although his lids were slightly lowered, almost as if Castiel was about to fall asleep. This sight was enough for Dean to decide that it was right to admit Castiel to his room. And so Dean dropped into his bed as well, throwing the covers over him and letting his head sink deep into the pillow. His gaze fell again on Castiel, who now returned that look, with an implied smile on his lips. - "Good night, Cas" - "Sleep well, Dean" - Contrary to his words of not wanting to sleep, Dean turned off the light. He couldn't see him anymore, but he was more than aware of Castiel's presence and it triggered something in him that he hadn't felt like that in a long time. Security. Dean was sure, in this moment here in the darkness, completely unprotected and weak, nothing and nobody could harm him. Because he was safe under Castiel's watchful gaze and very slowly Dean felt his eyes close. Castiel, too, felt this calm spreading inside him, putting his otherwise restless mind into a sleep-like state. And suddenly falling asleep was not so difficult anymore, not even for an angel.
"Well, Castiel... ...do you hold to your opinion?" - "Yes" - Castiel didn't hesitate for a moment before the answer blew out of him.No matter how thick the lump in his throat or how tight the noose around his neck,
"No. It is up to you whether you choose this human or heaven" - Castiel was irritated. Already so many times he had faced this choice. And each time he had turned his back on heaven. Each time he had chosen Dean. He thought it was more than obvious by now what his priorities were. - "Castiel, you should know by now that there are many ways to share eternity. After all, you experienced one of them firsthand
Cupid sighed softly, hardly noticeable. - "We both know I don't stand a chance against you. I am merely a third-class Kerub and although you have fallen, you still possess enough power to render my bow ineffective. Unless..." - "I'll let you." - The bad feeling in Cas that told him that there was something wrong with this intensified. - "Exactly", said Cupid, knowing that Cas didn't trust anything he said. - "Why would I do that?" - Cupid was silent, but kept staring into his eyes. - "Because it is his will." Another brief silence. - "Whose will? Who sent you?" - Castiel's voice was under pressure, trying to drive out the faint undertone of a hunch and waiting for the next words from the Kerub, whose eye contact had still not broken off. - "You know on whose behalf I'm acting, Castiel" - And Castiel knew. No one else would give a cupid a mission like that. No high-Level angel would give the order to shoot another angel with Cupid's arrow. - "Then you are --" Castiel faltered again. - "The very first. I am the first Cupid and answerable to only one. God."
"Dean, to me- you are-" - Castiel struggled with himself, not sure how best to put it now. After all, he had no experience in such matters, and the fact that this was about Dean made it much more difficult. But Dean himself was sure he knew what Castiel was trying to say. Or at least he thought he did. So he interrupted him. He took away the agony of standing in front of him struggling for words, knowing full well that it was pure torture for Castiel. - "Cas, it's okay. I know" - Dean immediately caught Castiel's confused look, which made him smile. He was just far too easy to figure out and, more importantly, to get rattled by. From time to time, Dean really enjoyed pulling Castiel's leg a little, trying to throw him off his guard a bit and make him lose his mind. But now was not the right time for such games. Castiel seemed to be insecure enough and Dean wasn't in the mood to take advantage of that at the moment. So he just kept talking, hoping to restore to Castiel some of the calm he usually held so intensely. - "I feel the same way" - Dean's smile softened as he could see the relief that now gripped Castiel. He took a deep breath, lowered the shoulders he had been tensing uncomfortably until then, and seemed to wait for Dean to continue speaking. - "You're-" - Castiel held his breath. - "-like a brother to me" - And there was the confusion again, which, however, did not manage to become master of Castiel's facial expressions. He controlled himself and continued to withstand Dean's gaze as it flitted across his face and regarded him silently for a moment. - "We've really been through a lot crap. You've become part of the family" - And that was the moment Castiel got his bearings again. He understood what Dean just told him and yet didn't really dare to believe it. Because that would mean- yeah, what would that mean to them? - "A brother? The way Sam is to you?" - Dean nodded. - "Just like Sammy is. I'd walk through fire for you- literally. And I'm sure Sam is no different. We may not be related by blood-" Dean laughed. - "-we're not even the same species but that doesn't change the fact that I love you like a brother, just like Sam"
Dean cleared his throat nervously and shut the laptop in a slightly too hasty motion. - "Very well. It's way past midnight. I should be getting ready to turn in, too."- With those words, Dean rose from his chair and stood undecided in the room for a moment. - "I thought you weren't tired?" - "I'm not. Lying down doesn't mean sleeping, after all. Besides, it's more comfortable. And if you don't want the bed-" - Dean left the sentence open again, straightened up a bit more to stretch his back which instantly cracked loudly a few times. And Castiel also got up from his chair, almost as if he had decided to leave as well. But where to? He would hardly go to sleep, and certainly he had no room of his own in this bunker to retreat to. But at such a late hour it was no longer possible for Dean to rack his brains more intensively about what the angel was doing in the time he was sleeping. He just wanted to lie down in his soft bed, put on his headphones and listen to some Led Zeppelin. So he turned away from his friend to make his way towards the bedroom like Sam had done before. - "Good night, Cas" - "Dean", Castiel stopped him - with all the courage he could muster - before he finally disappeared into the corridor. His voice sounded deeper than usual, or was Dean imagining it? Or maybe it was the underlying uncertainty, which was quite obvious to Dean, that gave the angel's voice a different timbre. So Dean paused in his steps and looked at Castiel, who stood in front of him with slightly slumped shoulders, but still did not avoid his gaze. - "Would it be possible for me to come with you?" - "Excuse me?" - Did Dean just get that right? Had Castiel really just asked him - with that strange yet insistent expression - if he could come with him to the bedroom? To do what exactly there? - "In your presence, I feel a relaxing calm. It's almost like- sleeping" - Dean wasn't sure if he interpreted those words correctly. And he had to admit to himself that he was afraid of imagining too much about it. After all, Castiel usually spent the night with him to watch over him, as he often said himself. But this time it was different. It was not only about protecting him even in his dreams from the evil that constantly surrounded them. It was about giving Castiel that security as well. And even though Dean lectured the angel every time about how much he hated being watched in his sleep, he couldn't deny it to himself. He felt safe at the thought of having Castiel near him while he slept. For all the years he had been driving from motel to motel with Sam, always with his gun under his pillow, he couldn't claim to have ever really slept. Because there was no such thing as a break for them. But now that Castiel was by their side, that had changed. Dean felt as if he could now finally really rest, really sleep. Because for the first time in his life, he had a deep and restful sleep whenever he felt Castiel's presence in the room. But that was also something he would never admit to anyone else. And now it was his turn to repay that same feeling to Castiel. So he took it that way, and before he consented, his thoughts back in this world, the whole puzzle - which he didn't even know was incomplete until just now - was putting itself together. Because he looked into Castiel's face, saw the open confession mixed with this firmness in his gaze, so that Dean didn't have the possibility to interpret anything else into these words than exactly what they had to mean. And suddenly everything seemed to be quite clear.
"No, but you are loyal to God, even if every other angel has already given up faith in him. But you love people just as much as if you were their creator yourself" - Now he was about to laugh. A bitter and even desperate laughter glided softly, almost silently, over his lips. All this could only be a single, huge joke. And Castiel knew absolutely nothing about jokes or irony. But it could not be anything else.
"God thinks a reward would be appropriate for you. After you have served heaven so many times so selflessly and yet have been rejected by it again and again" - "And therefore he wants me to be despised even more because I have broken the highest rule of the angels? If I really commit myself to a human being, I can never go back" - Castiel was clearly angry. But Cupid had reckoned with it, or rather God had. He had warned him that Castiel would be different than the other angels. More impulsive, irrational, human. And Cupid took pleasure in it. It was a nice change from all the other angels he'd met so far, even if it didn't make the conversation any easier. He knew it would be hard to convince Castiel of any of this. Make him understand God's purpose.
"I didn't kill anyone. You were just never born," Castiel said again, more forcefully this time. He took a small step toward Dean who slowly but surely began to despair. - "No, Cas! It doesn't make any damn difference! Who actually gave you the right to decide who was born and who wasn't? They were all breathing, living people! With real futures, with dreams! And what about Ellen and Jo? They were born and the sinking of that fucking ship made it dependent on whether they died or not! You killed them!" - It resembled an outburst of rage and yet there was this determination, this calmness, all subliminal in his voice that made Castiel understand that all he was saying was nothing more than the truth. It was Dean's own personal truth that made him close his eyes in despair while his forehead wrinkled in agony. - "And God knows how many more"
The wind whipped around them, rustling the mellow tassels, moving them back and forth like waves beating along the shore. It hissed into a quiet whistle the deeper they got into the field.
“Mommy?”
“You can try,” Dean said defiantly; with his larger stature, it was hard for him to take Cole's threats seriously.
A small frown dug between Cas’ brows and he tilted his head like Dean had personally offended him. “Dean, don’t sell yourself short. You’re the farthest from a ‘douchebag’,” he said, waggling his fingers into air quotes.
There are mentions of a conch in this chapter. If you’d like to know how it looks like, it’s something like
Cas gave him his exaggerated eye roll. “Holliday was a well-known dentist, not a psychologist, but I’m sure he would agree with me.”
He raised his eyes, locking them with Dean’s. “This part is easy to figure out.” He looked at the book again. “But here’s what I don’t get: only when The Unbroken sunders and the holy is returned can both cleansing and The End be stopped alike.”
“And promise me that if I ever lose control and don’t come back — that if I ever put anyone I care about at risk, that you’ll kill me.”
Dean turned to the door, a muscle in his jaw clenching when he felt Cas’ tail curling around his body as they moved to the living room. It was a weird sensation, Dean couldn’t lie, but at the same time, it felt intimate and cozy, like Cas was his personal koala.
Castiel huffed.
“Cas…” he muttered under his breath. “Cas…” he repeated, fingers still caressing his over-sensitized cock, for once wishing he was not alone.
“I know…”
Sam checked his watch. “They entered the cornfield around twenty minutes ago, so if we’re quick, we can still catch them,” he replied. He had been on the east watchtower and had been the one to spot them and warn the rest of the fort.
Dean wasn’t burning anymore; whatever angelic powers Castiel still had in him stopped the flames, and instead, Dean was looking up at him. Surprise filled his green eyes, and something else too, something that pulled Castiel into his gravity like the Earth pulls the moon.
The music was slow, and their steps were clumsy at first. Cas stepped on him a couple of times, Dean went out of rhythm a few; but soon they were easing to the melody, gliding around the dance floor like they had been born to do this.
. Because one day, Cas would see Dean for what he truly was — broken, a cursed man who had killed his parents. And on that day, Cas would leave him. So Dean bit the inside of his cheek, eyes avoiding the other’s cerulean ones, and said instead, "Let's get some booze."
Castiel huffed, a shy smile playing at his lips.
“That’s what the camera is for?” Cas’ gaze fell to the Canon on Dean’s shoulder.
“Isn’t it tiring?” Dean grunted.
They stood still for a moment, relishing in the feeling of being locked together after all this time, as Dean’s muscles relaxed around Cas and accommodated the intrusion.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, uh, you don’t like it? I can—”
“There’s no need.”
“There’s something more to it, isn’t it?”
Dean pushed himself away from the vehicle, turning his attention to the beauty in the back, his black 1967 Chevrolet Impala. The sunset glistened off of her perfectly lustrous surface, putting every other car in there to shame. “Hey, you,” he said softly, sliding his hand along the roof of his baby.
“And that was one hell of a long time ago.”
“Promise!”
“Not if I take the appropriate measures.”
The inside was cramped with white and yellow counters on both sides and multiple freezers. Dean blinked a few times, eyes adjusting to the dimly lit space that seemed to be empty. He took another step, and his heart did a backflip in his chest — there he was, lying against the corner, with a backpack as a makeshift pillow, arms folded tight around himself, and chest steadily rising and falling. His dark hair was a mess in a way that suited him, his pink lips slightly parted, and his eyes shut to the world as he slept.
Lucifer hissed sharply, taking a few staggering steps backward against the blunt force of Castiel’s power. “I will kill you if it’s the last thing I do!” Castiel growled and pulled back.
Dean’s stomach flipped with a tremor of fear as he chanced a glance at Cas. The angel was a vision of stoic presence, his spine a straight line, his face closed down and absent of any emotion. The nearly invisible tension around his shoulder blades would be imperceptible to anyone but Dean, who had learned to read every micro-change in Cas’ demeanor. Dean was sure that if Cas’ wings were visible right now, they would be spread wide above their heads in a display of dominance and threat.
“Dean…”
Dean didn’t have his focus on them, he had it trained on Cas, taking in the lines of his body subtly going stiff, hands turned white-knuckled fists, wide-eyed stare fixed on the marine life trapped behind the glass walls.
A thin layer of sweat covered Cas’ torso as he sped his thrusts into Dean’s hold. “Dean.” His voice emerged shakily. “Dean,” he echoed, in the most perfectly wrecked tone, and it was better than Dean ever imagined. His eyes snapped open to lock on Dean’s.
Dean clutched Cas’ shoulders tighter, trying to anchor himself to something while his heart seemed hell-bent on bursting right out of his chest. He wrapped one hand around the base of his cock to keep himself from coming just yet; he wanted… needed to drag out this moment. This perfect moment with Cas inside him and all around him, filling him so full of everything.
Soon there were too many, even for Dean; he plunged the axe into another Croat’s head, jabbing and slicing a few more as he ran around the truck, dropping to his knees as he came alongside the vehicle.
“It’s alright; it was a long time ago.”
“I was doing patrol—”
?” Dean paused, his voice sounding much frailer than what he intended.
“Hey, Be. Is Garth around?” he asked, looking toward the three doors in the back that led to a sterilization room, the piercing area and the bathroom.
Bobby grumbled something under his breath, and pointedly didn’t look back.
“One of the reasons.” He took another drag from the drink before moaning softly. “This is really good, Dean, thank you.” A corner of his mouth lifted in a way that almost seemed too private for the rest of the group, before turning his attention to them. “My brother, Michael, the head of our clan, has been trying to maintain peace for as long as the truce between humans and merfolk has happened. You see, Lucifer’s clan has always been against the truce and they spite us for defending it. He’s been waiting for the perfect excuse to kill us.”
Dean nodded to the door that led to the holding room. “What about him?” he asked, not missing the fact he wasn’t using the other man’s name anymore.
“Alright!” With Sam’s help, Castiel got up and started gathering everything. “Call Charlie and Bobby. We need to stop Dean.”
This time Dean gave him the finger before turning around and heading out, waving over his shoulder. “See ya later, jerk.”
Dean nodded slowly, something in his chest lifting up with the knowledge that he had made Cas feel better. Dean placed his calloused hands on Cas’ tear-stained cheeks, drying each wet path with his thumbs before leaning closer to press a lingering kiss to Cas’ forehead.
“Don't need to be so touchy about it.” Victor stepped back. “What's the deal with it anyway? I never really understood why it matters so much to you.”
“What is it?” Dean immediately knew something was wrong by the alarm in his voice.
“I was explaining to Jefferson that I’ve been ordered to serve one portion of food per person, I—”
Dean scrunched his face, grumbling, “Only you could convince me of that,” under his breath before joining Cas on the pillow. They took a few more pictures together: smiling, making faces, Cas pecking Dean’s cheek and the last one sharing a kiss, letting the camera witness them losing to each other again. At one point, Dean blindly dropped the camera and pulled Cas closer, opening up to let him trace his lips and savor the inside, dragging soft, little moans from both of them.
“W—wait.”
The line stretched and went taut with another sharp tug, not budging despite Cas’ attempts to reel it in. “Is it stuck?” Dean asked, forehead puckering.
Even though Cas had a phone that someone named Anael had fixed for him, Dean convinced him to join his cell phone plan. Cas also had a bank account with some cash from the times he had come to shore. When he got his first semi-monthly paycheck he persuaded Dean to go for celebratory pizza and beer, which Cas paid for. Dean only let him pay for it to stop the nagging about Dean never letting Cas pay for anything. After much persistence, Dean had also compromised to a scant rent of $100 per month once Cas brought home his next paycheck. When it came to groceries and utility bills, though, Dean was adamant on covering them. Money wasn’t an issue for Dean before Cas came along, and now, even though the extra rent was welcome, his income was still enough to support them both just fine.
Sam eased the boat to a stop and followed him into the deck. The breaking waves lapping at the vessel, along with the high-pitched screeching of seagulls welcomed them outside. Dean inhaled and smiled as a salty scent floated into the back of the boat and swirled around him, tingeing the air.
Castiel stroked hard and fast, feeling his own swollen cock steadily leaking fluid into the fabric of his pants as Dean moaned loudly and let out breathy little whimpers.
“That’s what you did?” Cas asked. “Before the apocalypse, I mean.”
he rasped, pointing between the two of them.
“Then make me feel that, make me feel you, angel. I wanna feel you for days,” his voice was rough from having Castiel’s cock down his throat, but as Dean closed his eyes, Castiel could see there was more to it than that. An unspoken, I want to feel you when you’re gone. And as Dean swallowed him down again, Castiel couldn’t help the sting of tears from blurring his vision as he let himself get lost in the pleasure of Dean’s mouth again.
“My pleasure,” Dean murmured, mesmerized by Cas
They took a couple of swigs from their beers as Castiel contemplated the sight.
Being on patrol duty fucking sucked most of the time. Nothing to do but count the stars in the sky. Tonight though, it proved to be the relief Dean needed. Being out here on the watchtower and under the moon’s glow was quickly turning out to be everything Dean wanted — the cold to numb the overwhelming feelings, the cicadas silencing his thoughts, and the pale moonlight, that bathed everything in a serene afterglow, to settle his heart.
Dean left Baby parked outside The Roadhouse in favor of walking with Cas since the town’s Inn was just a few blocks away. He could return later to retrieve the car and drive to his house on the opposite side of town.
Cas cut off his words with his hand, fingers warm against Dean’s lips as a new wave of heat left a shivering trail down his spine. Dean drew in a breath through his nose, all too aware that Cas was practically naked as he pressed against him, jeans hanging low on his hips, a few stray droplets of water lazily trailing down his chest, skin flushed pink from the shower and dampened in a mingled scent of apples and mint. It wasn’t long after that three sets of voices entered the room, and Dean realized they weren’t alone anymore. Cas’ fingers slipped from Dean’s mouth, and he took a peek, careful not to be seen by Gordon and his men.
Dean snorted, blushing furiously against his own volition. “Cas, you can’t say stuff lik—”
“Also,” Dean continued, and he knew he was totally stealing the move from one of his favorites, Indiana Jones, but he couldn’t stop now. “Here.” He brought his free hand to his mouth, not minding the way his lips parted or the way his heart raced in his chest as Cas’ eyes bored into his, three shades darker, before, slowly, trailing down to Dean’s lips.
"I know that your interest lies elsewhere, but I am only authorized to answer one of your questions" - Castiel's gaze became more tense. One question, then. What would that be? He was sure it had something to do with the Cupid's appearance. Probably why he was here. So, what would he be expecting now? - "The covenant between angels and humans is unequaled. "Only chosen angels are allowed to make this covenant. Often for our benefit. For example, the procreation of a nephilim. There must always be one on earth, so that the closing of the gates of heaven is possible" - "And now you want to tell me that I am one of these chosen ones? That is why I am now to mate with a human woman to make it possible again to banish all the angels of heaven to earth in a cruel way? Not with me!" - Castiel knew Cupid was not done talking, and yet he simply had to stop him. Because if that was true, if he was truly chosen to do so, then Cupid could save his breath for speaking. He would not go along with this terrible plan. He would not provide any of the "ingredients" to close the heavens gates. Especially if he was to be shot down by Cupid with his stupid love arrow. - "There's no need. In fact, there already is a Nephilim. Last month he had his second birthday" - And Cupid smiled at that. And Castiel almost thought to see a loving and proud smile in the otherwise static movements of his facial muscles. Almost as if he knew this boy he was talking about until just now, as if he liked him, had a connection to him. As if he sees something else in him than a simple "ingredient". And then the smile was gone, too. And almost as if that had been his sign, he came back to the real subject. The reason why this Cupid stood before him.
"There is only one thing that makes you look forward to the thing so fearlessly" - And of course Cupid would not miss the opportunity to say this out loud. Because now he had something on him. Something Castiel hoped no one would ever know, and of which he himself was never truly sure until that moment. - "The fact that nothing would change for you You're already in love, Castiel" - Castiel couldn't deny it, but he couldn't agree with that either. Because he didn't know for sure if it was true himself. How could he? He didn't even know what love felt like. Did it feel like love for his father? Like the love for his brothers and sisters or for the people? What Castiel knew is that love is not love. You could love your father differently than you could love a good friend. He knew he loved Dean. But did he love him like he loved Sam? He had always believed that this love he felt for the two of them was purely brotherly. But he also had to admit to himself that the feelings for Dean were different from those for Sam. He had always believed that it was because of the special bond between Dean and him. And Castiel was not so wrong about that. But he didn't know what to do with it. Was what he felt for Dean really love? True love? - "I'll take your silence as approval" - Cupid tore Castiel from his brooding thoughts and took a few steps away from him, further and further towards the Shadow. - "so, for the moment, my help is not needed. If you change your mind, pray. I will find you" - Of course Castiel knew that wasn't true. The person who would find him was God. And that reassured him. Because it meant he was still out there. And he kept an eye on him. So all hope wasn't lost.
"It was necessary. It was the fate of the Titanic to go down, with all those who were on board. It was the order of things that should never have been changed" - That Castiel had his fingers deeply involved in this game, he mentioned of course with no word. He did not want to upset Dean even more and above all it was not his burden. And he shouldn't get into the distress of having to carry it. The civil war he was fighting up there with his siblings had nothing to do with Dean or Sam and he didn't want to drag them into it in any case. He would find another way to finally bring peace back to heaven, even without bringing Dean or anyone else down with him. It was not his task to straighten out the waves that Castiel had woven with his own hands. But Dean had no idea about that. He was not in the situation to pay further attention to it, because his biggest problem now was this fucking butterfly effect. The sinking of a single ship had caused the people he loved the most to die. A ship that sank decades before they were born with no concrete connection to them was their downfall. And over and over again, scenes played out in Dean's mind that showed every possible contingency it would take to fundamentally change the life they now led. What had brought them to this exact point? Was it the day he got his father to buy the Impala instead of a shaky van? Or when he picked Sam up from college, and thus was partly responsible for him not being with Jess when she was attacked and burned to death in pain? Or that time he lost him once while hunting when he was fifteen and his father gave him the silent treatment for three days until they found him? Or maybe it was the extinction of the Lake Pedder rain worm? Who knew? So many details, so many incredible possibilities. Every step he took, every ant he crushed under the soles of his shoes, could perhaps be the reason for his death. Or that of another person close to him. It was to despair and deeply depressing at the same time.
"He feels he bears some of the blame himself. "After all, his departure was the catalyst for all of this. "But don't worry about his motives anymore. It's all about you" - And Cupid's look showed him that this was the end of that part of her conversation. But Castiel could not accept that. He wouldn't be able to fob him off that easily. There were still so many things he needed an answer to that burned in his soul. And he knew God would be the only thing that could quench that fire inside of him. - "But I still have so many questions!" - so he said it, hoping to get more information out of cupid. but deep down, he knew it was all for nothing. He wasn't going to give him any answers, whether he didn't want to or couldn't. So the question of why God did nothing, even though he was obviously watching him, would not be answered so quickly. Or where he was and why he had abandoned them. And more importantly Covenants between angels and humans were forbidden. Why would God break one of his most cherished rules? Why now? When he had punished so many other angels for defying this rule and getting involved with a human, even procreating with them? And as if Cupid could read his mind, which he probably did, he smiled.
“Yeah,” Sam nods, “she also mentioned there’s a pie festival going on in the next town over.”
“We got a way to get you out of here and back home, but only humans can go through the portal we opened.” Dean explains.
“Yeah, I’ll explain on the way home” Dean says, turning to look at Cas again.
“Like when you were an angel… could you feel emotions, you know like anger and... stuff?” Dean continues shaking.
She nods, taking a sip of coffee, “Do you want me to leave this on for you?”
“Tired,” Cas says rubbing his eyes before turning to look at him, “it’s going to take me awhile for me to get used to being human again.”
Cas smiles back at Dean as they walk back to the Car, Dean still holding him.
Fun fact: While I was writing this, I didn’t think much of Dean saying “I love you” to Cas on the beach. But, while I was revising it “I Can’t Help Falling In Love With You” came on and then I remembered Twist and Shout
“Well, I know you’re weakened, so I don’t need your permission.” he brings out the blade and stabs it in the chest.
Cas smiles, just like he did right before he died, but this time he isn’t going anywhere. Dean was finally able to confess his love after 10 years, a huge weight lifted off him. One of the first things Cas ever said to Dean was “Good things do happen” and, for once, they both believed it.
