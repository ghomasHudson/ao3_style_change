“Well would Cas mind if I stole my little man to feed him some lunch?” Mary asked Dean who looked back at Cas who shook his head.
“I have an adopted daughter and a two adopted siblings,” Castiel smiled handing Dean the doll which was then carefully placed in a box like the red headed one. Jotting down who each of the dolls were for Castiel fished out his wallet from his pocket.
This continues.
“Do you know what will happen to her?” Dean asked, watching the cute little girl hungrily devour the soup, eyeing off any older men who dare come near her food.
“Why?” Dean scoffed, watching his brother as he welcomed more, people into his home – this time they were Benny and his wife. Then two out of three of Gabriel’s brothers Lucifer and Samandriel, with their respective partners Michael and Adam. Next came in Kevin – one of Sam’s collage friends and possibly the smartest guy Dean knew. People began to mingle quietly, making Dean think everyone was there. Charlie and Dorothy were sitting on the floor by the tree, snuggling under a bright red blanket, drinking the eggnog Gabriel had forced on them. Lucifer, Michael, Samandriel and Adam were squished onto the couch together, drinking eggnog after Gabriel had done the same to them. Kevin was curled up on a chair alone, drinking cocoa and laughing at the story Gabriel was telling in the most dramatically Gabriel way he could manage. And Sam sat on the other single seat, facepalming but laughing at his husband.
“Dean you’re ten years old, I think we need to talk about Castiel,” John told his son. Dean looked over at the ghost who just nodded and walked out of the room. However he didn’t go far, as to hear what John was telling his son.
“Don’t have sex in there!” Dean called out, rubbing my ear between his fingers.
We arrive and I’m ushered in. we’re late.
“Cas,” Dean choked, reaching out and trying to touch the other man, feeling a ping of disappointment when his hand went through him, “I know you can’t hear me but I still love you too, and whatever I did, I’m so fucking sorry.”
“Business!” Gabriel practically screamed, looking at the younger Winchester, “Sam if you know who we are, then you know why we are here… correct?”
He awoke with a headache that could probably kill a grown man, let alone someone and thin and gangly as he was. He woke up dressed in only a pair of black, silk underwear with a see through material spanning down from it and up around his waist almost like a belt. It was not what he was used to. But they said this world was different from his. In the kingdom he lived every man had to wear trousers and cravats and all sorts of posh stuff. And the women wore full length gowns. Here however it was common to dress this way as they built their kingdom in the centre of a desert, so they cared not for the modesty his people had, and wore revealing outfits. However, those who did not wear these revealing outfits tended to work during the night, when the air is cold.
“This will be our first child’s room,” she smiled, pressing her hand to her stomach lightly, “do you think this room was a man’s or a woman’s?” she asked her husband who leant on the door. Castiel huffed a light laugh. It had been his room originally, but after his death Anna had taken it, hence the fainting couch which was a much more feminine choice.
“You should stop and talk to Dean…” he told me. I looked at the younger boy. He was fourteen and nearly as tall as me. I could tell he was going to be taller than me by the time he was in a few years.
“Trust me he’s done a lot more than that, besides who said I enjoy this? You literally raped me!” Dean cried, squirming underneath the larger man.
“Mick?” Lucifer asked, putting his hand on his twin’s shoulder and raising a questioning eyebrow which Mick just nodded to the front door let me down onto the couch and grabbed Lucifer’s hand, dragging him past Dean and closing the front door. Muffled conversation began outside but I could care less about when Dean was still blushing under the stares of his brother and cousin. The door suddenly opened and Michael and Lucifer were coming in, Michael blushing about something as Benny showed up at the front door, asking Dean if they could talk.
Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle.
“You will continue to forge your chains, chains worse than your father’s,” Mary finished, before both faded into nothing, leaving Dean alone in a dark room.
“Do I really look like that?” the ghost version of Gabriel mused, making Dean roll his eyes, “ no wonder your brother married me!” Before Dean could respond he was cut off by the doorbell ringing. Sam walked towards the door and opened it with a large grin, ushering whoever it was out of the cold. By their figures Dean guessed that it was a pair of females, but before Dean could ask who it was, they both dropped their hoods revealing more familiar faces. Charlie and Dorothy, two of Sam and Dean’s shared friends. Dean watched quietly as they interacted with Sam and Gabriel, their smiles bright as they brought over a pair of bags filled to the brim with neatly wrapped presents.
“Thank you,” he replied before continuing, “after he quit working for you, you told everyone in the same business appalling lies about him meaning he never got hired again.”
As the world around Dean began to spin this time he squeezed his eyes shut, begging any deity he could think of that this was all just a dream. “Dean.” At the sound of the spirit’s voice, Dean opened his eyes to find himself in Sam and Gabriel’s apartment, however unlike at the Christmas he had witnessed earlier this time the apartment was dark and cold, the only life was Sam sitting in the corner which had been turned into a little office. He was hunched over papers upon papers, his brows furrowed together in frustration. He looked dishevelled, his facial hair thick but not too long, and his hair barely touching his shoulder.
“They kept telling me I was sick, they were going to throw me into an insane asylum,” Castiel hissed.
of December, he was about to make the dumbest decision he would ever make. Not only did it breech his friend’s privacy, but it was just an overall terrible, stupid and childish idea. On the 19
“DEAN!” I yelled, snagging my blonde best friend’s attention.
“Fuck. Me. Master.” Castiel needed no more encouragement, bouncing the younger on his lap making Dean mewl and moan, his voice so loud Gabriel could probably hear it.
I’m not beautiful. I’m not confident. Never appealed to me. I didn’t know what he would say.
“Oops…” a beautiful red headed woman said, coming through the door, wincing at the death glare Gabriel was giving her. A death glare that really could kill.
“No,” Dean whispered, pulling me onto his lap, and hugging me.
I love you too you assbutt.
“Where the fuck is the camera man?” someone yells, I look forward to see that there’s nobody manning the camera. Behind it, on a chair sits a gorgeous young man who is scribbling in a notebook. Another model?
I want to kiss him.
“Sorry, I should get going, Sam will want dinner soon,” Mary sighed, kissing Dean on the cheek, “it was lovely meeting you Castiel.” And with that she left.
“Yes,” he whispered, lighting up Dean’s face who kissed him again softly before Castiel nudged him away, “I really do need to get ready Dean, I'm singing a solo tonight. And I’m telling the history of Christmas.”
“I counted ten presents,” Kevin grinned, “there’s only nine of us.”
Dean and his ghostly companion moved into the hallway with full view of the people mingling and if any surprise guests arrived Dean would see them the moment they entered. And after what felt like an eternity the doorbell rang once more, startling the peaceful friends out of listening to Gabriel who huffed indignantly at the interruption before prancing over to the door, winking at Dean when none of the others could see his face. “He knows I’m here?” Dean asked the other Gabriel who shrugged.
“Better slow down there brother,” Benny snorted, making Dean turn around to glare at the head chef.  Benny was in his coat and hat, ready to leave for the night, “in fact perhaps you should just go home.”
“We’re your parents sweetie,” Mary promised, gliding over to stand next to her husband. Only then did Dean realise that they were both wearing the clothes they had been buried in.
“So who is it?” Cas groaned, not really caring too much. Probably one of the class manwhores, who came out as bisexual the moment their balls dropped.
Run away with me – Dean.
“Your father is dying,” Castiel informed him, his face dropping faster than the energy levels of a teenager in a maths class.
“Because I never wanted Benny, you’re all I ever wanted,”
“Life, I was focused on my job – working for you actually,” the older Dean explained, watching as his past self-kissed Cas again – both excited and happy to finally have gotten over their fear of rejection.
“Roughest love I’ve ever heard,” Michael laughed, making me blush and Gabriel laugh. “Fine, Castiel you and Gabriel will escort your lover back to his kingdom, but if he turns on you, kill him. But you better leave as soon as possible.” Castiel and Gabriel watched as their brother strode out of the room, obviously unpleased with the plan the twin brothers had concocted. Castiel said his farewell to his brother before bolting to his room and pouncing on a lounging Dean.
“Dean.. I-I” I began, looking away from him, tears already spilling out of my eyes.
“Don’t you get lonely?” Dean asked, making Castiel smile sadly. But part of him was astounded at how well the three year old spoke, although he wasn’t surprised, Mary was a very intelligent woman.
“Why are  you miserable Gabe?” Sam asked his best friend, looking at him curiously. Gabe blushed before attempting to escape, but unfortunately for him Sam was a giant so he caught up quickly.
Castiel opened the door to Dean’s shop, inhaling the familiar scent with a small smile. Noticing the beautiful, albeit older, lady Castiel said hello in the most charming way he could muster, assuming it was Dean’s mother. “You must be Castiel! Dean told me so much about you! I'm Mary,” Mary smiled, rushing around the counter to hug Castiel.
“Legally yes, but that’s only by adoption, he’s techniqually my uncle, I mean nobody has a kid at nine!” Claire pointed out.
“Clearly I am insane,” Dean mused to himself, closing his text book and stripping, “or there’s a ghost in my room.”
“Why what would you do if you were bored of me?” Dean pouted.
“Hopelessly.”
“After the show perhaps,” Castiel grinned, stepping away from Dean with a grin. Chuckling when Dean’s face shifted into a pout before he stepped closer and gave Dean a fleeting peck on the lips before running off to the hidden rooms built behind the stage.
“Who are you in love with Dean?” Castiel asked, looking down at a shaking Dean. Dean refused to look him in the eye, wiping away stray tears.
“A man?” Claire confirmed, getting a nod in response, “do you love him?”
“Punishment! Forged by his cruelty! And if you don’t mend your ways you will end up the same!” Mary sobbed, “please, just listen.”
“Y-you. But I’m sure it’s just Stockholm-“ Dean began, only to be cut off with a kiss.
“I…” Dean unfortunately would not be able to finish that sentence that night as he fell into Castiel, passing out from all the alcohol in his system. Castiel had been cheated out of an answer that by this point everyone should have figured out by now. Which, was that Dean Winchester, of Lawrence, Kansas, was completely, madly, head-over-heals, and every other cliché in the book, in love with Castiel. And the only two who had not figured this out, was the two, rather dense, men themselves.
“I-I know that, I… I just didn’t expect you to actually show up…”
“Do I need to remind you, I own you!”
“O-oh sure, I-I’ll go talk to Gabe and have him go find her,” Cas smiled, his eyes showing how he was really feeling. Dean had someone. Dean had a son. Pulling away from Dean he began for the door.
“Silly kitty how did you get out here? I don’t think Dean could handle losing two Cas’!” she said sadly, picking me off the kennel and bringing me back into the house before going back out to feed Riot. I wandered back into the front room to sleep on the windowsill until Dean returned.
“Mum, don’t make him feel guilty, he has to see his family too,” Dean’s voice called from the door that led to the stair case that led to his apartment.
“Tell me.”
I kissed him. In front of Crowley no less.
“Cas!!!” Dean screamed, hoping that somehow his master would hear him. Instead he was slapped on the arse causing him to cry out. Thrashing and screaming, Dean tried to escape Benny’s clutches but the man seemingly had super human strength. Dean was a sobbing mess, screaming at the top of his lungs as Benny began to thrust in and out of the teenager. Benny’s nails dug into the sides of the blonde as his thrusts became more and more erratic, hurting the boy more and more until he came inside of the mess that once was Dean.
“I’m mostly calm!” I said, sitting down and allowing my two nuzzley babies to nuzzle me like mummy cats… even though they are both male.
Castiel Novak died at the age of twenty one in the year 1870. He had been a sickly child, and probably would have died sooner during the civil war if it had not been for him being to sickly to join the fighting. As a ghost he watched his family grieve and then watched as they moved on with their lives. Castiel was the only son of a rich merchant during the 1800s, and his sister Anna ended inheriting everything. But Anna’s family was cut short with her three sons who died during the first world war. So their home fell into disrepair and Castiel wandered the halls alone as it was forgotten. That is until the home was bought by a young family. And that is where the story begins.
The hell is this costume? I have to what?
“B-but what about lube?” Dean tried, already trying to avoid taking something so precious and irreplaceable from his best friend.
Snap. Snap. Snap.
“Not at first, at first I didn’t want it, but I had no choice. Now… I don’t know.” Benny grabbed the boy’s wrist and dragged him to his bedroom, slamming the door behind them. Throwing Dean onto his bed, benny began to unbutton his pants making Dean’s eyes widen and scramble backwards, falling off the bed.
“Yes you do!” Cas countered, grabbing Dean’s ankles and dragging him onto his back. Dean let out a breath of surprise, looking at Cas as the other leant over him and kissed him. His tongue going into Dean’s open mouth and leaving burning everywhere it touched, and that burning spread down to his crotch. Dean’s eyes remained wide until Cas’ tongue brushed over a sensitive spot in his mouth, making Dean whimper. And then Dean came to his senses. Pushing Cas away with a hand on his chest and a hand on his forehead, Dean took a few deep breaths whilst he stared at Cas. What the fuck?
Almost a year after Sam and Jessica got married they came home with a gorgeous little boy. Named in honour of his uncle who was taken much too soon in their eyes. But Dean wouldn’t have had it any other way. And he said so as he and Castiel moved on into the next life, together.
“Well if there is a ghost, want to do me a favour and give me a blow job?” Dean joked, making Castiel flare up. Unsure if Dean was joking or not, Castiel didn’t move, instead watching Dean as he tossed and turned in bed. “Fine, I’ll get myself off.” Castiel left the room before he could see any more, but he couldn’t stop imagining what the view would have been like if he had stayed.
“Wasn’t Castiel the name of one of the old occupants of this house?” Ellen asked Mary who nodded and mouthed something to Ellen.
“Fuck,” Dean cried, leaning his head in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder, “fuck me please.” Castiel needed no more, he began to push his dick into Dean’s hole, millimetre by millimetre until Dean got so fed up he slammed himself down, wincing in pain slightly but not regretting it in the slightest. The two clung to each other as they caught their breath. Castiel rocked his hips as he lifted Dean up and roughly pulled him back down. Castiel thrust into Dean, slowly building up speed as he lost his self-control. Dean was thrusting himself down in pace with Castiel, mewling lewdly and probably alerting everyone in the castle of their current activity. Castiel flipped Dean onto the bed and continued his rough assault on the younger’s arse, smirking when Dean cried out, cuming all over their chests. This image was enough to finish Castiel off, and the man came into Dean.
“Y-you knew about that?” He asked, looking at Castiel, wishing he knew why he kept staring at his assailant’s face. His beautiful face, his mind unhelpfully added, causing him to blush.
“Pants off now,” Castiel told Dean, going over to his draws and opening the top one with a key that normally was hidden in a jewellery box. He pulled something out and walked over to Dean and smirking when he saw Dean was pantless and even more eyes widen at the sight of the large butt plug in Castiel’s hands. Grabbing Dean’s legs and lifting the sixteen year old until his knees were hitting his chest, Castiel licked and spat on the sex toy until it was wet enough to slide into the blushing young man’s arse. Kneading Dean’s anal opening with the butt plug until said boy was moaning like the little cock slut Castiel believed he was, Castiel felt his pants tighten. But he wanted to prove to the younger man that he enjoyed things up that plump arse of his, no matter what it was. Slowly pushing the anal plug in, Cas listened to the groans, moans and all around lewd sounds. It went in with little resistance, and once it was in, although Dean was panting and Castiel had noticed his cock was already leaking pre-cum, Castiel grabbed Dean’s pants and pushed them onto the squirming boy’s legs before tying the rope around the waist to stop them falling off and the butt plug coming out.
“Well that was a beautiful reunion!” Gabriel said, seemingly appearing out of nowhere. “Shall we get into the city now and…” he stopped mid-sentence and smiled at Benny who did not know their plans. Castiel barely knew what his brother was planning. All he knew is they were going to kill John Winchester.
He slowly reached out and dusted away the snow, avoiding reading the words until they all appeared in front of him. And when he did, his heart stopped. He was right.
“Claire, what do you want Mister Winchester?”
One message changes it all.
“Sam loves her, but she’s more of a supportive sister figure, so he will take it really hard… so he will grieve, but that’s natural,” Dean sighed.
“My pet, you should not be so angry, if he hadn’t sold you to me we would never have met,” Castiel grinned, licking up the side of Dean’s neck causing the smaller boy to mewl.
I smile at Dean and slip the number into my pocket. Farewells are made and soon I’m heading back to the car.
“Get dressed, I will return in an hour for you,” he said curtly before walking out and locking the door behind him. Dean stared at the door, his mouth hanging open.
“Me?” Dean asks, tumbling off his chair and scrambling over to the camera. Our eyes lock, he gulps. “O-okay.”
“Yes, well I don’t like taking girl’s virginity,” Dean muttered, opening the door for the girl to get into his car.
“Fuck I love you,” Castiel snorted.
Taking a shallow breath, Castiel shovelled his phone out of his pocket, quickly sending a text to his best friend begging her to come find him and help him calm down like she did so often at school.
Dean watched as he brought over his own bag full of gifts, unpacking them carefully before standing up and blushing darkly when he realised how many people were staring at him. “What?” he croaked, fiddling with the hem of his sweater. Oh god his sweater, dark blue in colour making his eyes pop perfectly, and was also clearly a little snug. He looked like a stereotypical college professor which made Dean unconsciously lick his lips.
I mutter an apology that just makes him angrier. Fantastic.
“Well Jess was a lot less frustrating,” Dean remarked, “but that doesn’t mean I hated Gabriel!”
“The later,” Castiel agreed, watching Dean strip with hungry eyes, “although you can’t hear me now can you?” his answer was Dean climbing into bed without a response.
“Typical Cas,” she grinned, taking his arm in hers, “I guessed you’d be here, come on you won’t believe who is working the kissing booth with the male!” the dragging didn’t stop until they came to two lines of people, leading up to two archways with mistletoe hanging from the top.
“I don’t know he’s been depressed since you two got together, he was nuts for you,” Gabe put in, getting a sharp jab in the gut from Sam and get dragged away by Michael to get scolded.
“Yep.”
“I’ll work something out with my manager, I don’t really get free time,” I admit, watching a disappointed expression dawn upon his face. I don’t like it, it hurts.
“Dean,” I said, stopping him before I lost myself, “W-we can’t, not here, there’s nothing to prepare ourselves with.” I told him, making him laugh, and kiss me.
“F-for some reason I just really want to touch you,” Cas stuttered, making Dean flare up even more.
Castiel woke up to Dean fighting with his parents about something. Castiel looked outside to see Dean getting into his car and speeding off.
I text one word back.
“Give him a break guys!” Dean told them, forgetting they couldn’t hear him.
“What are you going to do when you move out to go to college?”
“Either way you got to your little brother,” the ghost muttered, “of course they were having problems anyway, but you just gave Sam bad advice and your little brother listened.”
Dean had closed his eyes for barely a minute when he heard the dorm door open, “Balthazar get lost, Dean’s asleep… no… I’ll ask him tomorrow… okay…” Cas’ voice murmured before the door closed. There was a few shuffling sounds before Cas presumably went into the adjoined bathroom. Sitting up Dean rubbed his eyes and glared at the door. After a moment Cas came out of the bathroom, half naked and extremely dishevelled.
“I-I,” Dean spluttered, losing focus and cutting his finger with the knife. “Shit.” Without even thinking I reached over the bench and grabbed his hand, before putting his finger in my mouth and sucking it. Cleaning the wound of any bacteria that would have been on the knife. As soon as I was done, I pulled away and looked at it, checking whether it was deep enough to need stitches.
I’m driven home. I sleep for four hours before Crowley enters my room and forces me out of bed. He complains. He’s rougher than usual. And above all else it seems like his mission to keep me from eating.
On the fifth of May of the next year John and Mary came home with a new bundle of joy. According to is name was Sam. Dean had already gone into protective big brother mode and didn’t trust anybody around Sam. Well anybody other than his parents and Castiel. Castiel found it adorable when Mary had Dean hold the little baby when they were showing him off to extended family. John’s brother Bobby said that he looked like a naked mole rat, which made Castiel confused, how did a baby human look like a rat of any kind?
“I think so,” I breathed, gasping when he rocked his hips.
“Both of you get in the car, this conversation is over. Castiel you belong to me, for another five years.”
“Awe… you’re so cute! But we told Cas he wasn’t allowed to have another cat. I guess you’ll have to go to a new family little one!”
Castiel watched as Dean kissed, and he refused to admit he wished he was the one kissing Dean.
I’m dragged back out to the car, fuck I’m hungry.
“Depends on if when you become king if you chose to marry me,” Castiel replied, backing Dean into a corner and kissing down his neck. Tugging at the harem pants he wore to take them off.
“I-I don’t know, I just thought it might feel nice inside your mouth,” Cas murmured, making Dean choke and blush again.
“Would you have done it if I was?” I winced, gasping as he drew out of me completely.
“Upstairs to  find dean,” I told him, forgetting he couldn’t understand me. I looked at the staircase and swallowed the saliva building in my mouth. I began to climb up the steps, but because of my size I might as well have been climbing Everest.
“What happened to Sam?”
“Orphan, keeps running away from foster homes – says they were neglectful,” Benny explained, although Dean already knew.
“How old are you?” Dean asked making Claire gasp.
Everyone filtered in like they had before, this time greeting Dean, some in shock. All glad to see him. But the one person he was nervous to see wasn’t there yet, and that filled him with more anxiety than he described, and so when Gabriel began the story Cas would arrive during, Dean excused himself, saying he needed some air. And Gabriel agreed, saying that it had to have been too much Christmas for him and that he needs a moment to himself.
He really is stunning. I’d be surprised if he wasn’t.
“It is true!” Sam cried happily, swooping over and hugging his slightly shorter older brother.
“Scatter! The younger brother human thing is coming!” Rascal cried suddenly, picking up Chesh in his mouth and placing her on a discarded pillow before lying down next to her. I felt a pull at my neck as Bee picked me up by the scruff. He jumped onto my bed and dropped me on the pillow I normally slept on, before jumping onto the window ledge to lay in the sun. I curled up as the door opened and my younger brother stampeded into my room like he did every morning.
I sit with Dean on a rare moment of freedom. Crowley is preoccupied with his mother’s arrival in the states.
“You’re my favourite treat,” Castiel told the boy who squirmed in his arms happily. Tuning Dean around, the green eyed boy raising his eyebrow as Castiel began to lick down as his spine, his hands still fiddling with
“Two reasons, I didn’t think I would be allowed into heaven,” Castiel admitted, “the other being I wanted to protect Anna.”
“Me? Not have anything to prepare us with?” Dean laughed, picking me up by the waist. He walked us over to his car where he threw me down onto the back seat before shedding his shirt and flannel and climbing on top of me. Grinding his hips down on me so our groins rubbed together making me unable to breath. “Are you sure you want this?” he asked, stopping mid rock.
“You fifteen ladies go in front of Cas, he needs me to be there cheering him on,” Charlie teased, continuing up the line as I felt myself begin hyperventilate. Charlie was next to me sooner then I realized, probably sweet talked her way to the front to kiss the girl and get to me before I passed out. “Come on Cas, you have to do this, you’ll regret everything if you don’t,” she talked, her voice soothing me as panicked.
Dean woke up wrapped in Castiel’s arms at one, normally he was used to waking up next to the older man,  but never in what would normally be referred to as the ‘sweetheart’s cradle’. So naturally he blushed and pushed himself out of the other man’s arms, wrapping his arms around his legs, his heart pounding painfully in his chest.
“I'm surprised that he hasn’t questioned Dean’s current predicament,” Gabriel smirked, winking at his brother who pulled Dean closer to himself.
“If you don’t mind getting sticky, there’s some grape jelly on the bench,” Cas suggested, “and we aren’t that far from the lake where we can go wash ourselves.” Dean pushed Cas onto the table, his muscles deciding for him. Dean grabbed the jelly before quickly removed his shirt and his pants. Cas watched him with lustful eyes before Dean pushed him back onto the table and attacked his body with his mouth. Leaving a trail of hickeys down his torso until he got to Cas’ briefs, which he removed faster than he realized he could. Before he could do anything to Cas’ delicious looking cock, he was being pulled back up for a kiss, after which Cas whispered to him “I want your prick in me Dean.”
“Then I will be your friend too Dean,” Castiel laughed, watching the little boy bounce up and call for his mother.
“Who?” Castiel asked, standing up and lifting Dean’s head up to look in his eyes. Saddened green met intrigued blue.
“You’re exaggerating love,” John laughed, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and leading her out of the closet. They searched the other four bedrooms before they entered Castiel’s bedroom next and she sat on the fainting couch and smiled.
“Tell me more?”
15 Years Later
Yeah… that kind of bad idea.
“Would you say yes?” Castiel asked, leading him over to the bed and pushing him down, pulling the oil out of the draw and setting it on the table.
With one last glance at the little girl Dean jogged after Gabriel, tumbling after him through the door and into a warm, gingerbready smelling house – a smell that instantly reminded him of his mother earlier that night. “Where are we?” Dean asked, looking around the vaguely familiar room.
“Because you pushed everyone away! You can’t deal with your own issues alone,” Death sighed, looking bored, “now I am going to send you to bed and when you awaken you will be fully rested and ready to go help Benny. Adopt that little girl. Fix things with the people in your life. I don’t actually care, but if I have to come back I will be the death of you,” as he finished his final words he began to fade away, along with everything else until the world went black around Dean.
“This little twit nearly got molested by a nobleman and I was a guard at the party who just happened to have been walking by, so it really wasn’t a big deal,” Benny told the confused teenager whose mouth opened as though he wanted to say something, but closed as his face heated up. Castiel looked at Dean, curious as to why he didn’t mention the fact that he had molested the blonde.
A career that is killing me!
“Happy Birthday Dean.” He whispered to the human, smiling when Dean sat on the bed and looked at him.
“Right you weren’t at school yesterday,” Charlie grinned stepping forward as we continued down our separate lines, “he came out as bisexual, and said if you were there he’d happily kiss you as proof.”
“I’m dead,” Dean croaked, clutching onto Castiel for support.
? Castiel wondered, smiling at a slightly tipsy Dean who closed his door and started stripping.
“Gabe stop,” Sam warned, looking unamused, “I told you all I invited my brother, Cas was just being polite bringing him a gift so that Dean isn’t left out.”
“I think you should know Dean,” Crowley snorted, shifting out of his leaning position so he could use the umbrella to point, Dean followed the direction he was pointing, only to find himself outside his childhood home.
“What the fuck,” Dean asked as Castiel picked him up and threw him over his shoulder, slapping his butt and earning a moan from Dean.
“Poor woman,” Mary sighed, standing up and walking to her husband, “shall we begin renovations?”
“you’re being dramatic!”
“If its Stockholm I'm never setting you free,” Castiel rasped, making Dean laugh nervously, wrapping his arms around Castiel as the taller man wrapped his arms around his waist, pulling him closer and making the kiss deeper, “whatever happens tonight, unless I tell you to run, stay with me.” Castiel told Dean the second they broke apart.
“Well it’s Christmas sir,” a brave waitress spoke up, her slender hands clasped together as she grinned like a lunatic.
“I-I’ll go get the first aid kit then…” Dean informed me, rushing to the other side of the kitchen and reaching for the top shelf but wincing as though he had hurt himself.
That’s what they keep telling me.
“Come on Dean, there’s one last place I want to take you,” the spirit sighed. Dean nodded quietly, closing his eyes when everything began spinning and opening them when he heard crows screeching in the distance.
“H-hi Dean,” I stumbled, becoming increasingly aware of my nudity. Especially when he pushed himself off me, blushing when he saw mini me, which I turned my legs into each other to hide, sitting up in the process.
“Who are you? How can you understand me?” I asked the cranky looking man.
“Why did you break up with him then?” Gabriel asked making Cas snort angrily.
“Why do you need one?” Castiel moved towards Dean, holding the towel around his hips, ready to take the underwear off his friend and put the drunk man to bed.
“What you said when you came here when you were looking for me…” I elaborated, looking him in the eye. Dean stood up quickly, heading towards the door, his face flaring up.
“Fuck Cas,” Dean swore, reaching out to touch Castiel but only going straight though him, “I’m sorry.”
“It’s not too bad, you won’t need stitches, maybe just a Band-Aid and to keep it clean,” I told him, looking up at his face to find him blushing. “Dean?”
Snap. snap. snap.
More photos, new positions and a grumble in my gut. When was the last time I ate?
“No, how about you text me your address and I pick you up?” Dean smiled. Agreeing Castiel hopped into his car and headed for work. Excited for the night to come.
“Yes, I thought that was made obvious by your girlfriend…” Castiel deadpanned.
“I’ll explain when we are safe. Come on we still need to save your girlfriend,” Gabriel winked, making Castiel flare up with jealousy. Only to calm when Dean squeezed his hand for reassurance.
“Coffee sounds amazing.” Dean agreed, stepping through the door and blushing as their hands brushed against each other.
“And wouldn’t you give anything for your first kiss to be with such a beautiful man?” Charlie pointed out, nodding to where Dean was kissing a grumpy thirteen year old girl on the cheek. Probably said something to her along the lines of “maybe when you’re older” to her.
I pry, and I try not to think about how pink his lips are.
“And my socks?”
“Even the cat thinks you should feed me,” Gabe pouted, raising an eyebrow I prepared myself to try and pounce onto my twit of a brother.
“R-right yeah, sorry Cas,” he laughed, ‘sneakily looking down my body, only succeeding at making me raise an eyebrow.
“I enjoy being fucked by you,” Dean told him when they broke the kiss.
“Hey Cas, hey Dean… hey other people I’ve never met before… including a beautiful young woman…” Charlie began to blabber, stopping when she realized she had accidently called Lisa beautiful…
“Merry Christmas Dean…” Castiel smiled, cupping Dean’s face with his hand before suddenly remembering something. “Do you want to spend New Year’s with me and my family, I know we haven’t been seeing each other long bu-” Dean cut him off with a quick kiss.
“How did you people get in my house?” Dean hissed, wrenching his arm away from the man who looked like his father.
“Because I was being weirdly distant,” Dean reminded Cas.
Grabbing his coat, Dean headed into the cold winter air, taking large gulps of air and staring up at the sky – oblivious to the world. Imagining Cas on that first Christmas together. imagining him on the Christmas where they both cross-dressed –particularly about the amazing sex they had that night. End every other moment he had had with Cas. He didn’t snap out of it until he heard bags hitting the ground. Blinking at his surroundings, his eyes immediately settled on Cas who looked the same, but his face was redder – he was blushing. “D-Dean,” he stuttered, glancing at the gifts nervously. Dean walked towards him slowly, as though he was approaching a skittish animal.
Dean blinked several times before snorting to himself and closing his eyes. “Right, sure, why not,” he snorted to himself before his breath began to even out. But before he was truly asleep he was forced up and out of his bed as what he thought was a bucket of water was being poured on him. Before his eyes, stood his old boss Fergus Crowley dressed in what Dean remembered to have been his favourite black, Armani suit, his lips quirked up in an amused smile.
Maybe they’re right.
Clack. Clack. Clack.
“Okay then, go on a date with me,” Dean whispered, his breath warm and smelling of peppermint.
Castiel had woken up on the sixteenth to a text from an unknown number. It had told him that the doll was ready to be picked up. Grinning to himself Castiel dressed faster than he had ever before. Almost zooming out of the house. And he would have, if it weren’t for his daughter Claire. Well she wasn’t really his daughter, more like his Brother Jimmy’s kid, who he had taken in when the man died. “Castiel where are you going so early? Its only six am!” she had gone off at him, probably angry he had woken her up when he fell over trying to get his best pants on.
It was barely passed one in the morning when the little boy awoke. He almost began to cry for his mother before Castiel floated over and tried to comfort the child. He began to sing a lullaby to the child, something about lavenders his mother used to sing to him, and he didn’t stop until he was certain that Dean was well and truly asleep before stopping.
“It was Benny’s idea,” he tried, scratching his neck. The next thing I know Michael is taking me out of Jo’s hands and looking at me, eyebrows furrowed in thought.
“He’s no-“
“God no!” Castiel laughed, reading his lover’s mind.
“I know.”
“It’s not hallucination baby,” Mary’s voice soothed, a pressure appearing next to Dean on the bed and making him sit up for a third time, his eyes bright with fear. He slowly began backing away from her, falling off his bed onto the cold, hard ground in the process.
“… would you?” Dean pouted, making Castiel sit up and put his hand on his heart.
“I knew it! From the second I checked him out, who would leave that many hickies on someone they didn’t love, they’re not called love bites for nothing!” Gabriel continued to tease the bright red man for a few moments longer before yawning, “I'm not surprised, you have had him for… what eleven months now? Let’s see you got him in early December… so yeah about eleven months, and since then you haven’t touched any of your usuals, Hannah is more than upset, she thinks she’s done something wrong, and poor Meg is as green as a frog with jealousy.” Gabe began blabbering, but Castiel wasn’t really listening, much too interested in trying to count freckles on Dean’s face.
“This is going to feel weird at first,” Castiel warned the younger as he spread Dean’s butt-cheeks.
“Fucking hell Cas,” Dean gasped, sitting up and drawing Castiel’s face up for a kiss. Castiel grinned into the kiss, his hands pulling the horny teenager onto his lap and kissing him back, massaging the boy’s hardened prick with his right hand, and his butt with his left.
“Sam we’re taking you too, whether we have to force you or not,” Castiel said, shifting Dean so that the sixteen year old was sitting directly in his crack.
“I didn’t know he was a virgin, or at least not his arse, he’s too pretty to be anything else then a good fuck,” the woman said, looking at Dean who was curled up in a ball, sobbing his eyes out.
Flash. I’m engulfed in darkness. Blinking, I find no - there’s no darkness they just turned off those god forsaken lights. God I had a headache.
However this story is not about their careers or the like, it is a Christmas tale, and we need to begin.
“Can’t you tell Mick?” Gabe laughed, walking over to me and pretending to swoon over me, “they’re in love.”
“Damnit Cas,” Dean breathed, staring into the oblivion that was Cas’ eyes until he felt a hand on his crotch again.
Dean’s funeral happened a week later. Mary couldn’t stop crying, John drank himself stupid and Sam shut himself off from the world. The wake was at their home, and Dean listened to everyone, whether they were saying nice things about him or not.
“Buck up Castiel,” Crowley sighed, slapping me on the back, “now go get out of those clothes.”
“We’re making it seem like you escaped, your dad will be more likely to accept you back,” Castiel explained as he grabbed his lover’s hand and dragging him out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
After ten minutes of tedious silence, Dean had dropped the girl at her place, not even saying goodbye, and gone to the one place nobody except him, his brother and Cas knew about. They called it the bunker. When Dean was in the abandoned bomb shelter he quickly shed his pants and clutched his hard cock. He had put off screwing that girl; he didn’t want to take something so important from someone. Not when he had lost it in a less then special way. But the downside to that; he was now so hard he had spots clouding his vision. Dean’s hand rubbed down his, in his opinion, massive shaft as he bit his lip and imagined the babe from his favourite porno, casa erotica 13. Only to yank his hand off his dripping member when he heard the bunker door creak open. Dean practically jumped into his pants, the denim rough against his manhood. Dean sat down at the table he and his brother had brought down there and pretended he was asleep. Only to be ‘woken up’ by a very disheveled Cas. “Cas?” he muttered, acting as spaced out as he possibly could.
“B-but you told me he raped my son, why would my baby boy fall for such a horrible man?” the queen asked, looking at the two young men who stood before her.
“That’s not for me to say, I'm going to go get some more firewood, don’t run off!” Gabriel winked before standing up and walking off into the surrounding forests. Dean watched the fire as it flicked up and down as it danced its usual dance, lost into thoughts. Wondering what Gabriel was talking about mostly. He was startled out of that by a grumbling sound from where Castiel was lying.
“His name is Cas!” Dean told his mother enthusiastically, “and he has the bluest eyes!”
“I was hoping you would be around for Christmas, Dean seems so fond of you,” she pouted making the blue eyed man feel guilty.
“P-please let me see something good?” Dean asked weakly, his eyes glistening with tears, “I don’t want to think about that man.”
“T-that’s irrelevant!” Dean said, wrapping his arm around Castiel’s neck and pulling him down for a kiss only to flip them over and straddle the bigger man, leaning over to kiss him properly.
“No, all you said is that you wanted to leave,” Crowley smirked, looking around the room in disgust. He had every right to turn his nose up, before Dean’s eyes was the dormitory he had spent his nights in during his teenage years, after the death of his mother Dean’s father had gone off the rails and that also sent Dean off the rails, by the time he was thirteen a permanently drunk John could no longer could deal with Dean’s rebellious personality and sent him to a boarding school.
“You know I would.” Castiel promised, laughing when Dean sat up in a rush only to wince, “bend over and let me kiss it better.” Castiel sighed, smirking when Dean did as he was told. Smacking Dean’s delicious arse he went to work.
Snap. snap. snap.
“I-if you were there you should have told me!”
“I have to get Sammy from the hospital, how about I drop you off at my place and text my mum that you’re okay, she went out with her friends for the day,” Dean told me, making worry about Sam.
Dean didn’t remember falling asleep but after an hour he was startled awake by a cold chill. He groggily opened his eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them he looked around the room until his eyes landed on a well-dressed, older man with dark hair and eyes. His body was thin and skeletal with hollow. Between his bony hands he held a black walking stick. He almost had an air of finality, a solemn air. It was the air of death. “Are you the third ghost?” Dean asked meekly. The man nodded quietly, flexing his fingers around the top of his walking stick.
“Just tell him you want to go see what another auto shop is like, or that you want to do a business course in the community college in New York, he won’t object! And if he does Mary will probably hit him over the head!”
“O-oh did I wake you up?” Cas blushed, sitting on his bed across the small room.
When they stumbled into Dean’s apartment it was nearing two AM and they had been kicked out of the bar they went to after dinner. Castiel sent a text to Claire saying that he wouldn’t be coming home that night before passing out on the sofa. Dean, who wasn’t nearly as drunk as he pretended, carried the other man to his room and stripped him to his boxers before climbing into bed next to him, but not before putting on sweats and a tee-shirt. They woke up the next morning in each other’s arms.
“Gabe get off,” Sam laughed, trying to push his best friend off his lap.
“Fuck me please C- Master,” Dean begged, Castiel’s eyes widened at the name Dean called him before rocking his hips and thrusting into the blonde’s arse.
“Of what?”
“Why are you guys doing this, you can’t be giving me back… a-are you bored of me?” Dean asked, stopping in his tracks.
“I guess I have to feed the little thing…” Dean told Benny, pushing him away and walking over to pick me up. Purring and nuzzled into his chest once more.
“Did you mean it,” I asked, not really intending to ask him so directly.
Castiel only freaked them out a few times, flicking lights on and off when they were installed, but only out of idle curiosity… he stopped when they talked about getting an exorcist.
Just as he was tidying up for the night his employees began to make a hubbub, singing loudly and off key to songs Dean recognised to be Christmas carols. So naturally Dean pushed himself away from his desk with an angered huff, leaving his office with a scowl. “What is all this ruckus?” he shouted over the loud pandemonium. He watched longer as the employees stopped in their tracks, no patrons left in the restaurant to ogle the outburst. In the kitchen door stood Benny, the head chef and one of Dean’s long standing friends. He looked almost disappointed.
As Castiel flicked on the light, Dean flinched, hissing at the sudden brightness of the room. “Dean?” Castiel asked, not quite realising how drunk his friend who stood before him was. Dean held up his finger to his lips.
“W-what?”
“Well this is nice and all, but I'm going to go see if there’s any news about… the thing…” Gabriel said going towards the door which opened and smacked him in the face with enough force to knock him over.
“It’s to keep you safe!”
“A-are you sure?”
The first thing he did that day was go to the soup kitchen to see Benny, it was early in the morning and few people were nearby, but Benny was already in the kitchen stirring away at whatever he  had made for the people that day. “Benny?” he asked timidly, watching as a shocked Benny almost dropped his spoon into the boiling hot soup.
He was greeted with the sight of a young couple, not too much older than he was when he passed, the man was tall and handsome. With dark hair and light eyes, he had a gorgeous smile which he wore as he looked down at his female companion adoringly. The woman however was fair haired and had a giant grin on her face as she looked around the entry, she had a simple but beautiful ring on her ring finger signifying they were married. “John it’s perfect!” she laughed, walking over towards where Castiel stood on the staircase, watching the oblivious couple.
“Aren’t you a little old to be considered an orphan?”
Over one hundred years ago, a truce was struck between the four kingdoms. However, the current king of the kingdom of the west, Lucifer who was only king through marriage, began to fight with his brother, who was at the current king of the kingdom of the East. So the north sided with the east and the south with the west. And so, a bloody war began, dragging innocents to death and those who were once considered criminals were treated as heroes. The south was ruled by the Winchesters, John Winchester to be, and the favourites of the old kingdom which was ruled by King Chuck over one hundred and twenty years ago. The North was ruled by Queen Linda Tran… she was small but terrifying. The East was ruled by Michael and his younger brothers, and the West by Michael’s twin brother and his wife Lilith. But who cares about them, I want to tell you about Dean Winchester.
“Because he was lonely and I’m the only one who can see him!” Dean told them man in a matter-of-fact voice. Their conversation had gotten the attention of Mary, her parents and Ellen by this point.
“What happened to him?” although Dean was not sure if he wanted to hear the answer.
“Would you like me to kiss it better?” Castiel whispered in Dean’s ear, smirking as he noticed the boy’s face flare up. Taking that for a yes, Castiel kissed Dean once more before sliding his tongue down Dean’s neck making the blonde gasp. Thanking himself for not dressing the boy when he found him, instead just draping his own cloak around  him which was discarded when Dean was put in his bed. Leaving bite marks down from Dean’s jawline, Castiel sucked and nipped down Dean’s body, drawing delectable sounds from the shorter man. Playing with Dean’s nipples, Castiel sucked and pulled at them until they were perk before continuing to suck each and every available inch of skin on Dean’s stomach. Licking circles around Dean’s  belly button.
“Fucking Gabr-Gabe…” Dean said, almost saying the name of the prince who accompanied him and Castiel there.
“I-I can’t believe you’re real…” Dean laughed after a moment of silence.
“Of course,” he breathed, a black wing catching his eye.
“Yes madam,” Castiel admitted, “I didn’t know Dean would ever be able to see me.”
“Of Cas.”
“Guilty,” Cas said, smiling into Dean’s neck, his smile turning into a Cheshire cat esque grin when Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist, pulling him flush against Dean. Neither seemed to mind waking up sticky as they fell asleep.
“Call me Cas, please,” I gasped, pulling my coat closer to my body with a blush getting a raised eyebrow from Charlie and Dean.
“When?”
“Bullshit,” Cas laughed, trying to look over the impossible line of girls ranging from thirteen to twenty, “Dean would never whore himself out.”
"Run away to New York with me at the end of school?"
“You’re beautiful Cas, ears and tail included,” Dean told me, rubbing my ears in one finger and sliding his other up and down my tail.
“Well I think you just scared my baby brother for life…” Dean sighed, wriggling out of Castiel’s arms and standing up, making the older man pout. “there’s someone else I want to save…” Dean fidgeted, looking anywhere but Castiel.
“Dean where’s your halfwit boss?” someone else yells, making the gorgeous boy look up, his glasses sliding down his face.
“Do you have a name?” Dean tried, receiving no answer in return, “okay what should I call you if you don’t have a name?”
“Y-you knew the whole time!” Dean accused, making Cas laugh.
“No promises,” Mary teased, kissing her son on the cheek and following the other parents. Dean wandered up to his room and placed me on his bed with a soft pat.
“Sam,” Dean sighed, looking around to see his employees had quietly gone back to work making him exhale a aggravated breath, “come into my office.” Sam readily agreed to the offer, shrugging off his coat and flopping onto the couch by the fire whilst Dean returned to tidying up his things.
“Please, let me draw you a bath, hot water will help the pain,” the man said, picking Dean up bridal style and placing him gently on the bed before putting his own pants back on and walking over to the bath to draw water.
Snap. Snap. Snap.
“Dean, he wouldn’t have jumped of suicide bridge,” Sam said, appearing out of nowhere with Gabe in tow.
“Dean!” Castiel’s voice called out once more, Dean screaming in response as he was thrown across the floor, cutting his leg on a discarded hunting knife in the process and hitting his head against a wall.
“It’s okay, John is in jail now,” Cas promised, snuggling closer to Dean.
“I'm assuming that you just heard the king of the south is dead…” Dean chirped, making Lisa look at him and raise an eyebrow.
“Did you now sweetie?” Mary replied, plastering on a fake smile and talking to her son with fake enthusiasm.
“I can tell you that bedroom, the one you converted into a nursery for Dean, was my bedroom before I died, and my sister never had the heart to put one of her sons in there after I died, so she converted it into a sitting room that only she could go in,” Castiel told them, “I know Mary asked you who you thought had been in that room when you moved in.”
I don’t say that. I keep quiet as we drive to our last destination. I’m so tired.
“Daddy?” my youngest cat asked me, coming up and sitting in front of me and cocking her head.
Nervously I watched and waited for Dean to come back in. Preferably without the bloodsucker. I nearly jumped off the couch when I heard Dean yell something at Benny. A profanity to be exact. Yelling from both sides caused Jo to storm over to the door, fuming as she opened the door to find Dean with a black eye. I jumped off the couch and ran over to Dean the second I saw him, meowing as Benny talked again “fine you fucking twit, see if I care! I hope your girlfriend never comes back, I hope he threw himself off suicide bridge.” He spat, walking off leaving a shell shocked Dean behind him.
“Cas?” Dean asked groggily when he woke up and saw the mess of hair that he was so used to grabbing…
“After you fired Benny you weren’t able to hire a new head chef – nobody wanted to work with you,” the ghost continued, “and you had to sell your failing business, but because you still needed a job the new owner kept you as staff.”
“H-how? Y-you’re dead!” Dean cried, backing into the wall, the kind, warm smile on his mother’s face never ceased, whereas his father watched him with an expressionless face.
“Where you going little man?” Sam asked, pushing Gabe off so hard he fell off the couch.
She lists. She lists the amount of times I have gone home. The last time I ate. How tired I look.
•	I'm at the front gate :(
“Well done Cassy,” Crowley’s voice purred as he pocketed his phone, “now you have two more shoots for today and then we’re done till tomorrow.”
“Good little slut,” Benny told Dean, pulling him up by his hair and bending him over the bed, taking off the struggling boy’s pants.
“You’re gay aren’t you?” Dean asked, confusing Castiel.
“W-what are you doing here?”
“Working so hard on Christmas Eve dear brother?” Sam grinned cheekily, making Dean scoff, “don’t you know it’s a time for being with your family and friends?”
“You were going to propose,” Cas bit sadly, although Dean could tell he wasn’t upset with Dean this time, but with himself.
“I did what?”
“You’re sixteen…”
She replied in moments, making his heart calm.
“Oh so it’s just mine?” Castiel smirked, lifting Dean’s face to look the blonde in the eyes.
“Fuck you,” I sneered, she knew my crush was towards the ridiculous end of the scale, and that I would sell my soul to be with him.
“Well he wasn’t home when I went in to tell him I was off for school… I didn’t even think about him being missing…” Gabe explained, taking m from Sam’s hands to cradle me.
“My father.”
Even though Castiel had come to terms that he was a homosexual a long time ago, a very long time ago, when he realized he had a crush on his father’s coachman when he was sixteen. He had not had another one of those… impure thoughts since he had died. He had hoped those perversions had died along with his body. “Dean,” the girl called out, sitting on the piano then laying across it in an attempt to be sexy.
“Killing you? Bullshit!”
“M-my name is Castiel by the way,” Castiel smiled, scratching his face slightly, feeling awkward under the gaze of the beautiful man.
A second year passes.
The stage, unluckily for them wasn’t too far away, and they got there in record speed. As the blue eyed male attempted to leave for the stage, he felt himself being pulled back into Dean’s arms with a light tug of an unrelenting hand. “Dean I have to-“ Castiel tried, only for his sentence to be cut off by Dean’s lips, something he melted into happily. Their hands stayed by their sides, clasped as they kissed, not noticing people staring at them or their brothers about to interrupt.
“Get your girlfriend to leave and I will explain,” Castiel begged, “please, I’m scared.” Castiel wasn’t lying, but the look of regret that dawned on Dean’s face was not an expression Castiel ever wanted to cause Dean.
“Okay gorgeous we’re done for the day,” a sleazy voice informed me, letting me stand up from the uncomfortable position I was in.
“I can show you your brother,” the spirit agreed.
“Fuck Cas… did you grow?” Dean asked, clenching his butt cheeks around the invading length.
“I want to make sure Sam is happy before I move on,” Dean muttered, his voice was quiet but Castiel understood. He could wait for Dean, as long as Dean needed him to.
“Nobody!”
“How about you start by opening up shop,” Benny grinned, “and don’t worry, I’ll let you go in time to go fix things with your pretty boy,” he added, winking at Dean who merely laughed, trying to hide his blush by ducking his head.
“How is that my fault? You need to take better care of yourself!”
“Hello Dean,” I blushed looking at the caramel haired boy in front of me.
He drove around for four hours, looking for me. He mostly drove around the town, only leaving to look in the place we built for ourselves when we were sixteen. It was in the clearing of the forest next to our high school. In the clearing was an abandoned water tower that we used as a frame to build a fort, it took us an entire year, but by the time we were done I was sure of my feelings for him, then… well I didn’t have the balls to tell him until it was too late. When we got to that spot Dean got out of the car, picking me up as he did it, and walking towards the structure. When he got inside it still looked the same, a ragged old couch that we dragged here on a hot summer afternoon, old blankets on the wooden flooring that we built when we realized we still had enough wood left. The mattress that we took from my room when I got a new bed and a book shelf full of porn magazines. Both male and female. Dean let me down as he closed the door we stole and opened one of the windows that Dean’s Uncle Bobby gave us when he found out we were building this. It was surprisingly structurally sound; the only problem is that there were no lights. I went and sat in my spot, not even caring that Dean appeared to be getting upset. His breathing had gotten ragged, as he choked out a laugh. “Fuck, where are you Cas, I don’t get to see you for years because you avoid me then you disappear completely! Are you punishing me? It’s because I was a wimp isn’t it. Because I couldn’t admit that when we were building this, I couldn’t stop staring at you when you took your shirt off. Because I couldn’t admit you’re the only guy I’ve ever really loved. Hell probably the only person I have ever loved.” Dean cried, flopping onto the couch next to me when he was done having a fit. I watched him as he brushed away tears that were leaking out of his eyes.
“Dean Winchester,” the man grinned, holding out his hand for Castiel to shake.
“Merry Christmas Dean,” Benny told him before leaving, presumably with the rest of the staff.
“What are you idjits doing here, dinner is ready,” Dean’s uncle said, appearing from the kitchen with a bear in his hand for Dean, which he nearly dropped when he saw Dean’s black eye, “Mary I hope you have an uncooked stake or some peas!” he called out making Dean’s mum burst into the room and drop the cutlery she was holding.
Snap. Snap. Snap.
“You, our son, will be visited by three spirits,” Mary continued for him, her voice strained and cracking as though she wanted to cry, making Dean wonder if ghosts could cry.
Nine years rolled passed with Dean and Castiel spending every day together. Sam had gotten married on the day that would have been Dean’s thirtieth birthday. His bride, Jessica, had agreed to have their wedding at the house. So unbeknownst to the blushing pair Castiel and Dean were watching them. Of course John’s speech said Dean was watching over them as their guardian angel, but he wasn’t exactly accurate.
“No…” Dean whispered, his heart clenching and unclenching as he went short of breath. His fears were confirmed when the man turned around, being swallowed into a hug from his brother, his enchantingly blue eyes, his face all but drained of colour from the cold and yet his nose and the high points of his face was all read. He looked just as beautiful as he had all those years ago.
“And I am paying the price for ruining my son’s lives!” John bellowed, “and so I would like to save you from the same punishment!” Dean looked up to see his father, now draped and bound in chains, his mother hovering nearby a pained expression on her face.
“Do I need to force you?” Castiel growled, rocking his hips and making Dean choke on the words he was about to say.
“How? Can you turn back?” She asked, drawing Mary out of the house.
“It’s made from sucking the skin till it bruises,” Dean explained.
It had been many years since John and Mary Winchester had passed away. And yet their greatest legacies remained, their two sons. Dean, the older of the two owned a five star restaurant; he was handsome and charming, twenty nine years young and fit despite his profession. Sam, the younger, was a junior associate at a large law firm with a bright future ahead; he was just as attractive as his brother despite the extra height he carried.
“The princes of the East, I’m fourteen, not stupid.” Sam told the brothers, looking at his blushing older brother with a smirk on his face.
“Can I just go home now,” Dean asked, not taking his eyes of Cas as Cas ate one of Gabriel’s cookies, grinning at his little brother who managed to look insulted by the act. Dean continued to stare even as the world around him went dark, he continued to watch Cas, his heart skipping a beat when Cas looked up, unknowingly locking eyes with him before fading away too.
“Welcome to our family Castiel,” Mary smiled, nodding to Castiel and Dean’s still linked hands, “that is if you want to.” Castiel turned to Dean and smiled.
“Yeah Dean’s had him a day and is already ridiculously attached to Lil’ Cas,” Sam smirked from his place on the couch with Gabe. I raised an eyebrow at the blush on my little brother’s cheeks but shrugged it off when my older brothers wandered into the room. Lucifer and Michael were twins. But fraternal and total opposites at that. Michael had dark hair and darker skin. Lucifer had blonde hair and light skin. The only thing they had in common was their blue eyes. Which I also share. The only one of us who doesn’t have blue eyes is Gabe who has green eyes.
“Why? I didn’t know you were lactose intolerant.” Castiel smirked, shedding his shirt and beginning to unbutton Dean’s.
“I-I’ll go help him… meet you at lunch!” Gabriel said, saluting the blonde and brunet. He pranced out of the room to follow the fourteen year old, leaving Dean to suffer at the hands of Castiel.
“Then go away! I don’t need you!” Dean shouted, pushing away from the desk and backing away from Castiel who watched Dean sadly.
I stand obediently. But Dean stops me. His hand hot around my wrist.
I must have fallen asleep in the backseat of Dean’s car, so when I woke up being carried to the front door, Sam trailing behind us and Gabe looking just as heartbroken as Sam, I was confused as fuck. “Cas you’re awake!” Gabe said, suddenly perking up, but he was my little brother, I could tell he was faking it.
“I’m hiding from someone,” he admits, a blush on his cheeks.
“Shut up,” Castiel breathed, “you know you love chick flicks.” And with the last syllable their lips touched for a moment of pure bliss. Which was then ruined by Castiel finally noticing Dean’s horrendous breath. “You need a toothbrush and some coffee.” Dean laughed. Castiel stepped towards the door and leant against the doorframe with a smug grin.
“Thanks baby brother,” I hissed, jumping out of his arms and back onto Dean’s stomach, curling up just above his navel.
“To bad Novak!” Charlie grinned, pushing me forward towards Dean the second we got to the front of the lines. Causing me to stumble and fall into his arms. Pushing myself away I flared up, apologies leaking out of my mouth as I backed away slightly.
“So she wants me to fuck a kid like you?” the man who was currently straddling him, “very well.” Was all he said before he began to attack Dean’s torso with his mouth, his teeth scraping and drawing blood. Causing Dean to mewl in pain. The man took off Deans ‘clothing’ with a rough movement that tore the material. Dean felt his voice hitch as he begged the man to stop.
“She isn’t my type…” I simply said, fiddling with the end of my school shirt, blushing awkwardly.
“G-go pack some stuff baby brother, and get Adam to too!” Dean told his younger brother; gasping as Castiel nuzzled his neck making Sam raise an eyebrow
He’s cute. I laugh. I smile. What is this feeling?
Dean was a virgin.
“Why didn’t you ever consider modelling?” I ask Dean, watching him flare up.
“We’ve all but won Dean, can I have a little victory sex?” Castiel asked when they got into… their room.
“Well then what if I adopted you?”
“You’re still in love with him aren’t you?” one of the Gabriel’s asked quietly, making both Dean and Cas look up.
“You came!” Dean beamed as soon as his mother had left, rushing over to Castiel and hugging him. Castiel inhaled the smell of the man in front of him, wanting to remember it whilst he was in Topeka.
Snap. snap. snap.
With his cock slathered in more oil than Castiel thought necessary, but he was scared of hurting the beautiful younger boy more then he realized at the time. Castiel pulled his pet onto his lap, high enough for his cock to be at the entrance of Dean’s arse. “Do you want my dick?” Castiel rasped, rubbing his cock through the smaller boy’s arse crack.
“You were totally smitten with this boy weren’t you,” Crowley teased, making the older version of Dean blush as Cas formulated his sentence.
“So Cas is still missing… I guess I’ll have to go check our old hang out spots,” Dean sighed standing up.
“What? How?” Dean cried, looking in the window to see himself dressed like a waiter, serving a family with a couple of kids, “I’m a waiter?”
“Because I am Castiel and I wouldn’t have had sex with him without his consent because I'm in lo-“ Castiel began to tell her but slapped his hand over his mouth and looking sheepishly at Gabriel who merely dropped his face into his hand and shook his head.
“Of course,” Crowley agreed, Dean squeezed his eyes shut, listening to the snap of Crowley’s fingers. Dean only opened his eyes when he felt the air shift into a warmer tone, the scent of gingerbread cookies infused into the otherwise homely feel. To his delight Dean found himself in another familiar setting, but this one was a happy one, it was the lounge room of Gabriel’s father’s house. Dean smiled to himself, not caring when Crowley cocked his head in curiosity, but before he could ask Dean why he was smiling two people burst into the room, laughing and carrying on like fools in love.
“Well dah! I mean I am right next to you!” Gabriel laughed, “also totally missing out on hot sex with your brother to do so!” he added making Dean gag. Dean blocked out the laughs of Gabriel to look to where the newcomer had come in and was taking off a familiar tan coat, his equally familiar dark brown hair sticking up as though he had only just rolled out of bed.
“What do you want Sammy?” Dean asked, patience a foreign concept.
“Y-you can touch me? Am I?” Dean’s eyes went wide with realization as he looked around the sitting room, “I was driving and… I crashed…”
Late on a December night, not long before Christmas, Dean had realized he had no Angel for his ‘tree’. Basically a bunch of empty, lidless hat boxes he had stacked up in height order and painted green with baubles and tinsel. He had even poked real fairy lights into it so it would light up. But he had no angel. He begun to construct it, but didn’t know what hair or eye colour to give it, let alone skin colour or clothes to give it.
“Sure, if you promise not just to go on about making dolls,” Castiel agreed making the caramel haired male perk up. Taking the dolls Castiel bid farewell to the man and went out to his car, stopping when Dean raced out calling his name.
“No thank you, it was pleasant seeing you but you can leave now,” Dean told them, sitting back on his bed and staring at them with distaste.
“We’re saving Sam,” Castiel grinned, watching as Dean’s face lifted as his excitement bubbled within him. “But it comes with a catch…” Cas added, noticing Dean’s sudden change in mood.
“I get why Sam is miserable… but why are you?” I blurted out, earning a slap on the butt from Dean making me yelp.
“Dean Winchester,” Charlie grinned from her place in the line for the girl. They looked out of place; as though they should have been in each other’s lines, but they were both of the few out gays in the school… actually they were the only ones.
“No shit…”
“Well if the last gift wasn’t for Dean why did you hold it so long?” Lucifer asked, joining in on the teasing of his younger brother.
“How old did you think I was?” Cas blurted out after a moment.
Just over a year later the house was beautiful once more. Castiel spent most of the time in the library his father had originally built for Castiel and Anna. John and Mary had repaired it and stocked it with as many books as they could find. Castiel’s bedroom had become a nursery for the son Mary fell pregnant with nine months ago. Castiel new enough about pregnancy to know when they rushed out of the house two days and eight hours ago that the child was on the way. So he found himself pacing impatiently as he waited for the young family to return.
“Cas…” Dean tried to warn, gasping as Castiel swivelled his tongue around Dean’s nipple, bitting it when it began to perk up.
“Shut up.”
Castiel followed Mary around and smiled as she explored the building, her husband dawdling behind them with an amused grin. When they got upstairs they went into the master bedroom and she opened the door to the wardrobe and let out an undignified shriek, but judging by her never ending grin it was a happy shriek. “The wardrobe is the size of my parent’s house!” she exclaimed, Castiel furrowed his eyebrows in confusion,
The first of the children to have a play date was Benny, he thankfully couldn’t see Castiel. But he seemed like a sweet kid, his parents had decided to move to Kansas before Benny started school.  Gabriel came two weeks later, with a bag that was full of candy, Castiel watched as he and Dean ate themselves into food comas before dinner only to get a stern, but amused, lecture from Mary before she made them go to bed. Dean however didn’t fall asleep, so Castiel sat at the end of his bed and sang him the lullaby that he used to sing him when Dean was a baby until Dean fell asleep.
“If you want to leave my room naked I'm not protecting you from rapists!” Castiel called after him, making Dean stop dead in his tracks and look down at his naked body. Gabriel was snickering from his place in the doorway whilst he let his eyes rummage over Dean’s body. “Gabe out!” Castiel told his brother, his voice raspier than usual; when he noticed the way his brother was looking at the youngest in the room.
“What’s going on?” Sam asked making Dean sigh.
“My place!” Gabriel cheered, eyeing the presents under the tree with an evil glint in his eyes.
Bicker. Bicker. Bicker.
“I’ve offered,” Gabe winked. Ewe! Gabriel! Wriggling my but I jumped onto his stomach making him exhale at the sudden weight of me on his stomach.
“Yes well because you’re a special case, the three spirits that will be visiting you tonight are people you actually know,” Crowley snickered, “but come along Dean darling, we have places to be!” Crowley disappeared from where he was standing in a blink of an eye, and just as quickly appeared next to Dean, guiding him into the closet. And yet as they stepped in through the doorway of Dean’s closet, Dean found himself in the middle of a snowy street.
“I’ve learnt not to question Dean’s sex life… though it’s new to see him with a male who obviously tops him…” Sam said watching as Dean’s face reddened.
