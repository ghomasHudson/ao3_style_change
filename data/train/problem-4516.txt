“It sounds horrible, growing up like that.”
But there was no ghost or miraculous resurrection. It was never him, always just a trick of Cas’s grief-stricken mind. There’d be a flash of movement in Cas’s periphery and for a moment he’d still expect it would be his friend, his... his... he’d still expect to see
‘Are you too stupid to realise you didn’t grab a titty mag from the top shelf or did one of the wrestling team sneak this into your bag as a joke?’ John had asked because of course there had to be some explanation other than the obvious. The idea that Dean might like men had been too far-fetched for John to even entertain. Winchesters didn’t do that kind of thing.
exhibit. Dean had looked like he enjoyed the works that shared a gallery with the
at the end of the song.
Dean made a noise of appreciation as he shovelled the eggs enthusiastically into his mouth and Cas grinned at him. Meg made a retching sound. Apparently, Dean and Cas were disgustingly cute anyway.
“Morning, sunshine. Want some coffee?”
“So are you,” Cas said seriously.
“Eighteen. I was working at the Gas-N-Sip and I couldn’t really afford it. I think I ate ramen for four months straight to save up.”
They both lay limp and panting for a long time before Cas pushed himself up on his elbows. He looked down at Dean and stroked his fingers softly over his cheek. Dean smiled up at him. Their bodies were still joined, but it felt like the connection went deeper than that.
“Cas,” Meg said sternly. He straightened unconsciously. It must be serious if she was using his real name. “You don't give yourself enough credit. You get awkward sometimes so you think that you're no good with people, but that’s not true.” Clearly overwhelmed by her own sincerity, she sighed and rolled her eyes in annoyance. “People like and respect you, Clarence. Deal with it.”
Dean’s hand shuttled over his cock and he bit his lip to hold back the sounds that were getting louder and louder. He could feel heat building low in his belly. With Cas’s voice in his ear, saying dirty things, it wasn’t long before Dean came, shooting powerful jets of come over his stomach and up to his chest.
Since those who’d grown up under the strict teachings of his father in their small, isolated community tended to be a little awkward (or a lot awkward when it came to Castiel), this didn’t exactly work well. Castiel and the others were unsure of how to interact with outsiders, something that was normally discouraged apart from these attempts to recruit new members to the Church.
“Fuck!”
Cas stripped to his boxers while Dean pointedly looked elsewhere. He was pretty sure that Dean snuck a few glances, though, despite himself. Hopefully, he didn’t remember that angels didn't sleep. Goodness knows how much more distrustful Dean would be if he realised how unnecessary it was for Cas to hog the only bed. He wouldn’t know though. The spell wouldn’t have affected his knowledge of angel lore in general, but the sleeping habits of other angels weren’t something he’d have cause to know, it was something he’d only know about Cas specifically. Since his knowledge of Castiel was currently buried in neurons with synapses that weren’t firing, well, what he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. Besides, while it was true that Cas didn’t strictly
“Well, I brought it from a sex shop, but honestly, I wouldn’t wanna use it. There was an episode of
“Is this the kind of thing you'd like me to do for you?” Cas asked quietly.
“So, you’re kind of seeing someone?”
“What?” Cas’s head whipped round to face him.
“Well, where are they?” Dean snapped, he’d been trying not to whine this time but he’d overcorrected and his tone veered towards aggressive.
“Mmm, these are good,” he said, before shovelling more into his mouth
Dean grumbled. As far as he was concerned, his reaction was totally proportionate to the situation. It hurt deep down in his soul to play a trashy pop song in Baby, but he’d do it, he’d do it for Cas.
“Yes, yes, you’re a sex god,” Cas said, rolling his eyes.
“No, that’s fair,” Cain said with an easy smile. “I don’t think the answer to hate and violence is really more hate and violence, but I can certainly understand the impulse.”
“Hey there, gorgeous,” said a voice from right behind him.
“Of course they are.” Cas frowned at him.
a painting of the icon based on a still from a Western he’d starred in. The piece had a black and white Elvis frozen in a pose where he’d just pulled his gun, the barrel pointing out at the viewer. The image repeated three times and got fainter each time, like Elvis was becoming a ghost, or fading out of existence like Marty McFly almost did when he messed up his parents’ creepy meet-cute.
“Punch a Nazi!” they shouted.
God had no power over him now. And his father had no power over him, for the two of them had always been intrinsically linked. Only Cas had power over himself. He was in control of his own destiny, and strangely, it felt like getting his first tattoo had been one of the things that had given him that power, or at least helped him recognise it in himself, where perhaps it had always been.
“Don’t worry about it. I live alone, so there are no roommates to scare by walking around naked.”
“Hey, sweetheart. Are you gonna—”
“You do realise that calling him my boyfriend really isn’t an insult when we’re clearly together? I know we’re in a relationship. I'm not going to be offended if someone points that out to me.”
That sounds uncomfortable.
“I like it,” Charlie reassured him. “Maybe it’s not as hot as a Browncoat, but you look good in a purple coat too. Besides, a sense of humour is sexy.”
“Come on, angel, get your head out of the clouds,” Meg said, her gentle words at odds with the rather hard punch she’d just landed on his shoulder.
“Do you need a hand with anything?” Dean asked.
He thought he could hear Cas’s smile as he said, “I miss your cock, Dean. I miss your hands and your mouth and your ass.”
Dean laughed, relief and joy bubbling out of him. Then he fucked it better, and this time it was face to face.
“It’s not something I would ever think of to do myself, but I really enjoyed it,” Dean said as they left the museum.
He put his phone on speaker and Cas kept talking as Dean squirted lube in his palm and spread it over his dick. His touch was gentle and unhurried, not wanting this to be over too soon. Cas’s voice was like a caress, raising goosebumps on his skin.
Dean was exceedingly glad he’d followed his instincts to come up here when he saw the devastatingly handsome man from earlier leaning against the bar.
book and if it could possibly live up to the wait. And if it would go in a better direction than the show had. Which led to them discussing whether they thought the prequel series,
“I didn’t mean in real life. It’s a joke on the show,” Dean explained. “People think Spike is imitating Billy Idol, but he actually had the look first. There’s an episode with a flashback to Spike in the seventies and he’s full-on eyeliner-and-safety-pins punk in it. I think it’s in season five.”
“You hooked up Cas?” asked Sam, sounding confused, like he wasn’t sure if Dean was joking or not.
“Please, take a seat,” Cas gestured to the large dentist style chair.
“Um, if that's her real name, she probably considers herself the
Dean kissed his forehead and Cas drifted off to sleep only moments later. He slept much better than he thought he would after making the difficult decision to reach out to Gabriel. He felt warm and safe in Dean’s arms, though, so the decision didn’t upset his equilibrium as much as he’d expected it to.
Jo continued snarking at him for a while before they fell into conversation about the various challenges of being a PI. She might claim not to, but Dean was pretty sure Jo did look up to him, at least a little bit, because she listened intently to all his advice and asked him lots of questions about what kind of investigation techniques he preferred and the best way to interview someone who didn’t want to talk to you. They both agreed that the old good cop/bad cop gambit wasn’t very effective.
Cas glared. Meg smiled. He went back to the stove and put some butter in the pan to melt before turning to Meg.
“Thank you,” Cas said, smiling for a moment before his face fell and he tilted his head questioningly. “Wait, was that a compliment or do you think my home looks sterile and impersonal?”
“You grew up in a cult?”
Dean laughed. That sounded like Jo. He was pretty sure she’d rather beat or intimidate information out of people than be the ‘good cop’. Bobby had always made him play ‘good cop’ when they interviewed people together too. Dean was only slightly better at it than Jo.
“The tattoo was like taking the worst thing about me and turning it into something good.”
“It’s the sweetest thing we’ve got in the bunker.”
“If the ambience you're going for is dull, then it’s working,” Sam bitched. “If you’re going to play crap just because it’s seasonal, you might as well put on New Year’s Day by Taylor Swift.”
CW- Mentions of child abuse/violence.
Dean looked down. “Damn, I’m missing the most important bits.” He jogged into his bedroom to grab the items he’d left on top of his dresser and rushed back out to Charlie.
It's another gay doll from the 90s
“That’s so good, you’re so good, baby,” Dean said hoarsely.
“You're ridiculous,” Cas said with a small laugh.
When it did come, the touch was light, fingertips ghosting over his hole, soft amidst the frenzied passion of their kisses. The same hands that had shoved Dean up against the wall were gentle now. Cas drew back to watch Dean’s face as a single digit pushed inside him. Dean rocked down to meet the intrusion. Cas's fingers opened him up slow and sure. There was a tenderness Dean had never felt with someone who wasn’t already a lover, someone who was almost a stranger, though he didn’t feel like that.
“Hey, maybe you could be the filling in that sandwich,” Dean said, nudging her with his elbow.
“Why is my drink green?” Cas asked suspiciously.
Bobby was watching them fondly while muttering something about all his kids being idjits.
One time in high school, Dean’s girlfriend had had a pregnancy scare and Bobby had never forgotten it—’took ten years off my life, boy,’ he’d told Dean. It wasn’t even like they hadn’t been careful. They’d always used condoms, but those weren’t infallible. So, when her period was late, they’d both panicked.
“I think you’re the sweetest thing in the bunker,” Cas said seriously, making Dean laugh.
Eventually, Cas drew back and said breathlessly, “I think you should take me to bed now.”
“I could go for Chinese.”
I need a drink.”
“True, but, unfortunately, I couldn’t convince Cesar that he should blow me in the bathroom just because we’re young and not husbands yet!”
“Mostly watch old movies.”
Dean snorted. “I’m excellent at the one-night stand part. I’m less good at the morning after part if I actually want to suggest doing this again sometime.” And he did want to do this again. Cas was smart and funny in a subtle, dry way and hot, so hot. So yeah, Dean wanted to see him again.
Cas was flirting with him! It was totally corny and Dean was pretty sure that he was a bad influence on Cas if he’d started spouting lines like that but it warmed his heart. And maybe had an effect on certain regions lower than his heart. What could he say? He was easy when it came to Cas. Give him a cheesy compliment and he was blushing like a fourteen-year-old girl and getting boners at the drop of a hat like a fourteen-year-old boy.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re a stud,” Dean teased.
In which an apologetic Dean takes Cas for a nice day out.
They spent a couple of hours dancing in the main room, drinking and hanging out. At some point, Dean broke off from the group to grab some water and then hit the head. When he got back out on the dancefloor, he glanced around wondering where his friends had gotten to. His eyes alighted on a dark-haired, tattooed man standing on the balcony above the dancefloor and he found he couldn’t tear his gaze away.
Cas looked confused but he followed Dean when he rose from the table. He always followed Dean. A bar bathroom was the least of the places he was willing to go for him.
Cas didn’t show up at the airport, but there was a string of texts from him when Dean checked his phone while he was waiting at the luggage carousel.
He held up a hand, “Wait for it, wait for it...” Dean pointed his finger at Charlie as he belted out, “For a fee, I’m happy to be, your backdoor man!”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut tightly in embarrassment for a moment. When he looked back at Cas, he was smiling at Dean. So, maybe Cas liked him despite the chronic case of foot in mouth that being around him seemed to bring out.
“In the time we’ve known each other, you’ve made yourself a better person, Meg. I've just had the privilege to witness it,” Cas told her seriously.
“Oh c'mon, dude, we may have only just met but, ouch, that hurts,” Dean said, holding a mock offended hand up to his chest and pouting slightly. “I know you don't know me, but lavender leather daddy isn't my usual look.”
Dean smirked and then said, “We don’t have to
Dean always seemed so sure of himself, but Cas knew that only half of that was the confidence he’d managed to claw back over time and half of it was fake bravado. Dean hated being vulnerable, and admitting that he wasn’t quite the carefree man he pretended to be, well, that was something he couldn’t do around most people.
Dean had pulled out and shifted his weight mostly off Cas but they lay together in a sweaty heap for several minutes while they caught their breath. Cas felt warm and safe, enveloped in a happy little post sex bubble. He snuggled closer to Dean and that bubble burst abruptly when his husband got up and said flippantly, “Thanks for the ride, angel,” and lightly smacked Cas’s ass.
he said harshly, not knowing if it was a reprimand or a request.
“I think it’s a ‘gag gift’ but it’s almost impossible to tell what’s a joke and what isn’t with Meg sometimes. I laughed when I unwrapped it and she looked really hurt. I’ve been wearing it practically every other day since Christmas to make it up to her. I wasn’t going to wear it for a date, but she came into my room while I was getting ready and started talking about how the colour makes my eyes pop.” Cas rolled said eyes emphatically.
Content Warning for mentions of racism.
The angel was sitting in the exact same place on the loveseat. They stared at each other for a bit, Cas mournfully and Dean just at a loss for what else to do.
"Where have you been, baby?" Dean said, looking down at the roof of the car.
too and she has a name from Dr Who! How cool is that?” Charlie was bouncing on the balls of her feet and grinning like she was about to have a spontaneous nerdgasm.
Since that night as the bar, without really discussing what it meant, they had fallen into a relationship. They had already been so close that, in some ways, not much had changed, but the changes there had been were wonderful. During the day, they were even closer than they had been. Cas always scooched his chair right next to Dean’s when they researched now. He curled up with Dean when they watched TV in the evening. He lay his head in Dean’s lap on the rare occasions that Dean actually had a chance to read a book that wasn’t research (the head in the lap thing was far too distracting if he was supposed to be working). There were affectionate touches and long looks that Dean knew there'd be follow through on now- when Cas looked at him like that, he was actually going to get laid. At night, they slept together, or Dean slept, anyway, while Cas watched over him. Sometimes they fooled around, sometimes they just cuddled, but they always spent the night in the same bed. Then, in the morning, they had breakfast together. Dean came up with new strange foods for Cas to try: bacon drizzled in honey, cinnamon toast crunch with hot sauce instead of milk and some expensive dark chocolate flavoured with chili peppers that he’d bought specially for Cas. Admittedly, chocolate wasn't even remotely a breakfast food but Dean liked starting the day watching Cas experiment to see what flavours he could actually taste. He was always so pleased to find something he liked and Cas had enjoyed the combination of heat and sweetness in the chocolate.
Dean thought the pearl-clutching was because Sam was a prude and didn’t want Gabriel mentioning that they were sleeping together, rather than that Sam was offended that Gabriel was mocking him.
“Oh please, I know you look up to me, twerp.”
He was obviously delighted at the prospect of making future plans with both their brothers, especially plans that involved edible food. And Dean liked to think that the diner where they’d had their first date had a special place in Cas’s heart, just like it did in his.
. This was what the witch intended. She was angry that you killed her husband. She was weakened, she couldn’t manage to kill you, and she certainly couldn’t manage to kill me, but she could take your husband away too. So that’s what she did. She made you forget me,” Cas told him bitterly.
Hey, did your plane land okay?
“So, you’ll always have lube for me, huh? What was that in the freaking wedding vows too?!”
“Wanna join us here on earth, Clarence?” Meg asked, leaning over him and offering him a hand up.
Meg smiled at him, warmer than usual, all sincerity instead of snark. Apparently, giving her girlfriend a demonic nickname was as good as welcoming her to the family where Meg was concerned. She had a point, he supposed. Sniping and sarcasm were a good portion of how he and Meg showed each other affection, particularly in the early days when love and kindness were so foreign to them both.
“Yes, pumpkin, you're very lovable.” Sam rolled his eyes as he patted Gabriel’s hand.
Naturally, therapy hadn't been an option when Cas was a fucked-up teen living at home. Then, when he’d left home, Cas hadn’t had healthcare insurance and couldn’t afford therapy. He’d barely been able to afford medication. Thank goodness for Meg. She’d been his rock when he first came to San Francisco. Still was really. And thank goodness the tattoo shop was doing well enough for him to have healthcare now.
(See the end of the chapter for
The other person shuffled around them, and both Dean and Cas broke into giggles.
“Never! That's discrimination, right?”
“Which one of you’s the man?” Charlie sang.
“Fine, but I can’t wait much longer,” Dean grumbled.
“Dean,” Cas said gently, fingers skimming across his cheekbone. “What happened wasn’t your fault. If you need forgiveness, I forgive you. But you have to stop tiptoeing around me. I’m fine.”
“Yes. You have his phone number, right? You can arrange a meeting?”
He had a brief moment of fuck-what-was-I-thinking?! Before he remembered what he had been thinking, that Dean was good and kind and someone he could trust. Cas cared about him and wanted to spend more time with him. And he could damn well get past his anxiety to do so.
Oh ho, someone's pretty full of himself!
the guy spat.
“I can’t believe you didn't tell me you were coming as Kaylee,” Dean complained. “I would have dressed up as Mal. You know how much I love
Hello to the people who bother to read the notes! I thought I’d include links to the songs mentioned and some of the other stuff referenced in case people are interested. Let me know if you think I missed something you’d like a link to. Or let me know if you think I forgot a content warning I should have added.
“I think I’d rather go the other direction. Everything is bleak as you walk forward, but when you come out the other end, there’s light and beauty you couldn’t see when you were going through it.”
The bar was busy but not so crowded that they couldn’t get a table. They sat across from each other on tall stools with a small wooden table between them. Cas’s mostly full beer and Dean’s empty one sat on the scuffed table next to Cas’s baseball merch. He’d removed his baseball cap when they arrived, which left his hair slightly squashed in a way that made Dean want to run his hands through it to return it to its usual coif. The foam finger had come off too. ‘There’s no one from the team here to see me supporting them,’ Cas had explained. Rock played on the jukebox at just the right volume to be able to enjoy the music while still being able to hold a conversation.
“Alfie’s upset.”
Dean decided to stay for one more drink and maybe a quick walk-through of the various rooms in the club, just in case he saw that guy again. He made his way to the upstairs bar. It was quieter than the rest of the club. The music that wafted from the speakers would probably be described as chill beats or something equally obnoxious. The more relaxed atmosphere was touted as a place to cool down after dancing for hours with your friends, somewhere you could hold a conversation over the softer music. It wasn’t Dean’s vibe, but it was less busy and easier to get a drink there.
“I’m not,” he said defensively. “Why are you on his side anyway? You’re my brother!”
Cas was fiddling with the knobs on the oven. He still seemed slightly flustered but he turned around and gave Dean a bright smile when he entered the kitchen.
“No, I swear I'm usually much more charming than this,” Dean said, a touch pathetically.
“My name.”
Dean sent him various funny pictures and videos throughout the week. Cas supposed it was Dean’s way of letting him know he was thinking of him without putting pressure on Cas to talk. Cas didn’t say anything in return, but he did send him back emojis.
“Fine!” Dean barked as he leapt out of bed and tried to muscle the other guy out of the way, expecting him to fall back, out of politeness, or instinct at least. The guy in the trench coat stayed exactly where he was, as if he were completely entitled to be in Dean’s personal space, and wrapped steadying hands around his upper arms.
“Yeah, but surely you watched TV over at your friends' houses?” Dean asked incredulously.
“That episode kind of made a lasting impression.”
“Uhhhhh, Cas, maybe you should-” Sam started to say, also while shooting glances at the oven, looking like he was wondering if they should evacuate the kitchen.
Once his lust clouded brain started working again, Dean realised that he’d been sitting on Cas for a long time. Sure, he’d just been thinking about how much lighter he was but that was purely metaphorical lightness. He was still a pretty big guy.
Dean let Cas explore until he felt like he was losing his mind. The soft touches were both too good and not enough. He needed more, he needed harder. Dean retrieved his usual jerk off lube from his bedside table. He took Cas’s hand and poured a little into his palm as Cas watched him curiously.
“I was thinking about what we’d be doing if you were here. I can’t decide if I’d have you on your knees sucking my cock or if I’d shove you down on the mattress and fuck you till you can’t walk.”
“Me too. So, if not for
Sometimes Dean worried he was dragging Cas down to his level. He knew that Cas wanted to be treated like a regular person, that it meant a lot to him to be here on earth and live like a human. Cas loved mankind and he felt privileged to enjoy the heights of what humanity had to offer: love, family, friendship, art, kindness, ingenuity, a depth of emotion angels couldn’t normally feel and so much more. But Cas was also interested in experiencing the more base aspects of what being human meant. They’d never had sex in a bar bathroom before and Dean had wanted to give him new experiences. And this was what humans did, fucked in stupid places because they were horny and impatient.
“So, did you really make him gay?” he asked, looking in the direction the bigot had gone.
“There’s a word in Enochian,” Cas said, before making a series of garbled noises that Dean supposed counted as a word in the angelic language.
Since Dean was less than forthcoming with details about his love life, Bobby took the hint and turned his attention to Sam.
“I don’t know, maybe you could get a tattoo of Martin from
“Meg,” he growled.
“So, are you”—
Cas dominated his mouth, sweeping his tongue inside like he owned Dean’s whole body. He slotted his leg between Dean’s and thrust against him. It felt so good, so good, and not enough. Cas drew back, panting. He was looking at Dean like he’d never wanted anything more in his life. Dean wasn’t sure if he wanted to bask in that admiration or hide from it. He wanted it, he really did, but he wasn’t sure he deserved it.
“I prefer Queer Ken,” Dean retorted smirking. “It's more inclusive. All we know for sure is that Ken likes dick—he could be gay, he could be bi.”
“Let’s dance,” he suggested impulsively.
Other people were walking around inside, but they were hard to make out in the gloom. Despite the numerous people, only hushed whispers could be heard. The darkness and quiet gave the cavernous interior an eerie feel. It was almost pitch black when they reached the back wall.
Cas rolled them over so he was on top. He kissed Dean roughly before drawing back and working a hand between them to grasp both their cocks.
Dean pulled Cas into an embrace and kissed him gently. It wasn't enough. It felt like Cas could turn to mist in his arms at any moment. He grabbed Cas and pushed him up against the car, caging his body in with his arms, like if he could just keep him trapped here, there’d be no more leaving, never again. Dean rested his full weight against him, as if he could anchor Cas with it, tie him to this corporeal being. Which was foolish, he supposed, since neither of them were technically corporeal anymore. But Cas was palpable, Dean could feel Cas’s body against his own and he wanted it to stay that way. His grip on Cas was bruisingly tight (if one could bruise in heaven, which seemed unlikely). His kisses grew rougher and more frenzied. Abandoning his mouth for a moment, Dean kissed and licked down Cas’s neck. He sucked hard on Cas’s throat making him gasp. When he drew back, he was glad to see a red mark forming there, it seemed there were still some bruises in heaven after all. He wanted to leave marks all over Cas, signs of ownership. He bit down on the column of Cas’s throat with punishing force. He was still angry and bitter about what felt like Cas’s abandonment. The harsh emotions wore at his restraint. Cas made a high noise and Dean nuzzled into his neck apologetically. He hadn’t meant to hurt Cas, just to scold him.
“Look, I know you’re not happy here but it’s getting late, let's just stay tonight. If you still want to, we can go back to the bunker in the morning. Maybe you’ll feel more comfortable there.”
“Fine...”
They stayed for another hour. The meal was filled with warmth and laughter that nourished Dean in a way that vegan pancakes—that even decent food—did not. Spending time with the people he loved was sustenance for him. There was a simple happiness in just being in the presence of Cas and Sam. By the time they were finished, Dean thought he might even be growing fond of Gabriel. He was interesting, funny and could be surprisingly kind.
“Cas... I...” He couldn’t find the words. He felt so much but he could never find the words.
It was nice to be able to do both at the same time and have the bonus of getting to hang out with his best friend. There were a couple of gay bars down on Folsom Street he went to that played rock, even some classic rock, but he didn’t often go with Charlie because the bars were, as she put it, sausage fests. This club was somewhere they both enjoyed. And somewhere their other friends enjoyed too.
Maybe he was driving Cas to distraction after all. Dean was momentarily disappointed not to be touching Cas too, but as soon as his fingers brushed against him through his boxer shorts, he found he was happy to lie back and let Cas have his way with him. Cas finished undressing him and then sat next to him fully clothed on the bed as he stared down at Dean’s naked body for a long time, taking it all in. An entirely unintentional little thrust of Dean’s hips drew Cas’s attention to his neglected cock. He was already panting and so desperate for any touch that he was pressing up into the empty air hoping for Cas’s hand to come down and meet him halfway. Cas reached down hesitantly and placed his hand flat on top of Dean’s cock, still for a moment as Dean thrust up against his palm. Just the slight pressure of his hand felt so good, even motionless as it was. Then he started moving and his light, cautious touches completely undid Dean. Somehow, a tentative handjob from Cas felt like a fucking revelation.
“It feels like I’ve wandered into the White Witch’s castle in Narnia or something,” Dean whispered as they entered the tunnel.
“Like you," Cas clarified quietly, looking away, trying to back pedal before giving in. "You," he admitted. "It could only ever be you."
“Really?” Dean spat sceptically. “Because I don’t think it took!”
“But...”
One side of the bed was still free. He stripped to his own boxers and got under the wonderfully un-scratchy quilt.
“Sam!” Gabriel said, putting a hand to his chest theatrically. “Not in front of our brothers!”
Cas placed a soft kiss on the head of Dean’s cock, then made his way up his body to kiss his lips. He grabbed the lube again to cover his shaft with it. Cas slid into Dean with excruciatingly exquisite slowness. Dean sighed with relief when he was finally seated fully inside him. Cas brought a hand up- the one that wasn’t still sticky with lube- to the side of Dean’s face. He traced his thumb across Dean’s cheekbone as he looked at him adoringly. He held Dean’s gaze as he gently rocked into him.
dick Dean wanted pressed against him.
A slow song came on and Dean pulled a still wilding gyrating Cas into his arms. Dean never did get to go to prom, so he didn’t really know how to slow dance. He just put an arm around Cas’s waist and took his hand and waltzed him around before twirling Cas under his arm, making him laugh. Cas sounded fucking giddy. Dean had done that. Made an angel of the lord weak in the knees. He grinned and gave Cas a quick kiss before pulling him closer. They swayed slowly, vaguely in time to the music, with as much of their bodies pressed together as they could manage. They stayed like that for a long time, even when the music sped up again, before Dean decided to go get another drink. He stopped by the table to see if Sam wanted one too and found him laughing with the same blond dude he'd been chatting to earlier. He waved off the offer of another drink, holding up a full glass of coke, so Dean headed over to the bar to get something for him and Cas, something sweet this time.
Looks normal size to me
“Are you shaking right now, Dean, desperate for my touch? Do you wish I was there, holding you down while I take you apart?”
“What about the queer girls?”
“Sorry,” Cas said, looking a little abashed. “I wasn’t sure if you’d know. We got this place after we married as somewhere for us to come alone. I thought maybe the spell wouldn’t let you remember things like this, things linked to our life together.”
“What, Sammy? There’s nothing to worry about. It’s just a clown.”
“I need to paint my room,” Meg told him as she pulled him through the store to the paint aisle.
Dean woke up that morning feeling more excited about Christmas than he had since he was a kid. Hell, he hadn’t actually felt this excited about Christmas as a kid. The holidays didn’t normally mean much to him, but sharing them with Cas? That felt meaningful. He blinked his eyes open to find Cas already watching him, as usual. He was getting used to that.
“Hey, are you suggesting my computer skills need work?”
Making his own decisions was important to Cas, whether it was deciding what a painting meant or deciding what to do with his life. He’d spent so long just doing what his father told him to do, believing what his father told him to believe, following all the rules. But he’d broken free. Cas was all about self-determination now. No one got to tell him what his life should be, how he should think or how he should feel, not anymore.
Then he scooted over and put his arm around Gabriel.
“Yes. I want to build something with you, Cas. A relationship, a life together.” Dean exhaled and leant into Cas’s hand. “I'll try not to shut down on you. But you have to be realistic, Cas, I'll probably always be an emotionally stunted asshole.”
Gabriel made a face at Sam when he took his first bite of the vegan pancakes. He grabbed the bottle of syrup from the middle of the table to drown his dry cardboard in sugar. Sugar was at least vegan and, miracle of miracles, the café had real maple syrup. There was a selection of other toppings too. Cas picked up the bottle with a bee on and squirted some on his stack. He made a face as well when he tasted it.
“Since when?”
“It suits you,” Cas said so dryly that it was impossible to tell if he was teasing or not. His eyes swept down Dean’s body in a way that made him shiver and a slight smirk played across Cas’s lips.
Sam made a face like he wasn’t quite sure how Cas taking on his memories of hell meant he had to eat turducken now, but, dammit, Dean was eating it, so Sam was eating it too and no one was saying a bad word about it to Cas!
He raised his hand to Dean’s face, turning his head back to look at him.
“Another?” Cas asked softly.
Cas checked the time on his phone again. Still five minutes until they were supposed to meet, so Dean wasn’t late, but it sort of felt like he was because Cas had arrived fifteen minutes early. Dean would be there soon, right? He was generally pretty punctual.
“So impatient,” Cas teased, smiling down at him indulgently. “If I promise to fuck you hard and fast later, will you let me make love to you slowly this time round?”
The one time that Castiel had trusted someone enough to be himself with them, or at least the person he was slowly becoming instead of just being his father’s idea of him, it hadn’t worked out so well. The experience had scared Cas back into submission whilst simultaneously making him more determined than ever to one day escape his father’s control.
Dean looked confused. “Huh?”
Dean grinned. “Yeah, that’s her. She’s pretty great, mead fetching notwithstanding. You should meet her sometime.”
A knock cut through the sound of the heavy guitar riff filling the apartment. Dean nodded along to the ‘Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap’ as he went to answer the door. Swinging it wide, he sang “I lead a life of crime,” to the redhead in his doorway.
“They’re extremophiles. They’re the only animal we know about that can survive the vacuum of space.”
“I still can’t believe you’ve never seen
He was right. Dean never wanted to let Cas go, his body, his soul, his whole being, he wanted to keep all of Cas with him. Dean wanted to tell him that, but, instead, he just whimpered. He couldn’t seem to form whole sentences.
Like Meg said, tonight was supposed to be fun. He just needed some way to get out of his head, to focus on the present instead of the past.
. Come say hi!
I know you don’t like flying.
Of course, he’d offered to share it with Sam, since the Impala felt like it was equally his as a Winchester, but Sam had little interest in cars (weirdo) and felt like Dean’s investment in fixing the car outweighed his own stake in it. Sam told Dean the Impala was all his, but the sneaky deal-making lawyer-in-training had leveraged Dean’s guilt over having Baby all to himself and he’d ended up being Sam’s personal taxi throughout high school. Sam was a giant dork, so it had mainly been lifts to the library.
“And what does a charming man such as yourself do?” Cas asked, presumably trying to introduce a normal topic so they could have regular conversation devoid of disturbing discussions about cock ring related injuries.
He hugged Dean tight and continued to whisper words of love and devotion while Dean gathered himself. The feeling of being comprised of scattered, disparate pieces faded gradually and Dean finally felt whole. He had a sense of completeness he’d never felt before. Like lying here with Cas was what his whole life had been leading towards. Dean felt like he was who he was meant to be now, like being with Cas made him a better version of himself.
“Now isn’t the time. As much as I enjoy it when you ‘role play’,” the man said, giving a little quirk of his fingers, which Dean thought was him attempting to do air quotes with bound hands. “You really should be resting.”
“I know you wanted to go home before we...” He waved a hand vaguely. Dean wasn't sure in the dim light but he thought maybe, just maybe, Cas was blushing. It was kind of adorable and only got more so when Cas continued sheepishly, “I just couldn't wait.”
“I know what sarcasm is, Dean!” He did know dammit. It was just that he had tendency to forget in stressful situations. He couldn’t read human social cues when he was barely holding himself together. It was heart-breaking seeing his husband look at him like he was a stranger, a particularly untrustworthy stranger.
I'm working on more Dean and Cas. Not sure yet what I'll do next, might do a time stamp or short sequel to this, or I might start another long fic. Maybe subscribe to me if you're interested in upcoming fics :)
Sam raised his hands in a placating gesture. “Only since you met Richard a few weeks ago. I'm sorry, Dean. It was just too good to ruin the surprise.”
“Wildcat,” Dean whispered in his ear before biting down on the lobe.
“Sorry, buddy, didn’t see you there,” Dean said calmly. He was a grown up. He was capable of trying to de-escalate things instead of rising to the challenge in the other guy’s voice. This was just some drunk dumbass looking for a fight and Dean didn’t have to oblige.
“And I’m going to... let you?”
Huge praise from the love of his very long life. Was that all he was to him? Cas felt adrift. It was like he didn’t know himself if Dean didn’t know him. He’d existed for eons, yet somehow, who he was, who he really was, was the person he’d become over the few short years he’d been with Dean.
“Whatever, Dean. As if this is about Cas anyway. You’re the one who wants to blow off research and go to a bar.”
liked Castiel fucking him, so it was usually only Dean doing the fucking if Cas was the one to suggest it. Dean was always happy to oblige but he rarely instigated it. While Cas was puzzling this through, Dean grabbed the lube that was back in the bedside table. Cas opened his mouth to say something, but Dean’s hands on him were distracting and then Dean’s fingers were in him and he couldn’t think at all.
“Well, I wouldn’t put it like that. But there's a wide range when it comes to the amount of creative freedom in tattooing. Some people know exactly what they want and they’ll bring a picture or describe it in precise detail, and some people just like your art and will give you a theme or a general idea of what they want and trust you to come up with something they’ll love. Of course, even then, they have final approval of the artwork before it goes on their body, so they might want you to make changes.”
“But you’re not an actor?” Dean asked, looking at Gabriel suspiciously. He felt suddenly protective of Sam as he wondered if Gabriel had lied about being some hotshot actor to try to get in his pants.
Shoving the tray onto Cas’s lap, Dean hopped out of bed and raced to the kitchen. He returned triumphantly holding a bottle of maple syrup aloft.
The guy looked at their joined hands and sneered, “Can’t even walk straight, huh?”
A diamond-shaped space on Cas’s arm was covered in little hexagons. They were inked in black apart from a few coloured small shapes within the design. There was a purple hexagon with a pentagon attached and a couple of lines that zig-zagged off it following the path of the honeycomb pattern and ending in little dots. A similar blue hexagon was set to the side above it with a few blue lines coming out of it. Below and to the opposite side was a green hexagon with three lines branching out from the corners.
The music there was rock, indie and alternative. Sometimes they’d play the odd Metallica song, but mostly it was more modern than the majority of what Dean listened to. He still liked it though and, right now, he wanted to listen to music he liked and maybe check out some hot guys who wouldn’t mind being checked out.
“Wanna sit down? We’re not due to meet Jesse and Cesar for a bit.”
“What?”
“What the fuck?” Dean said as he looked back at the tunnel, which was now entirely black. “What happened to all the colours?”
‘Marvel at the blur of their tiny feet,’ she sang when they tidied up the shop before they left. ‘The world's greatest guinea pig athletes,’ she belted out while she tattooed a photorealistic skull on a big, burly biker who she’d somehow persuaded to sing the backup refrain of ‘guinea pigs!’ every other line, which was surprising enough in itself, but Cas definitely hadn’t been expecting him to do jazz hands on the final, triumphant
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam had seemed sceptical about the miniature pies and muttered something about Dean watching too much of
Both Charlie and Dean looked around the room. When Dean didn’t see anyone they knew, he turned back to Charlie. She was staring fixedly at a redhead in a short skirt and chainmail bra.
But Dean was kind and funny, smarter than he gave himself credit for, interesting and fun and so, so beautiful that Cas just wanted to bask in his presence every time he saw him. He knew Dean was a risk worth taking, but he was still scared.
“Yes, it did,” Meg and Cas said in unison.
Maybe it was a little unusual for Dean to be this enthusiastic. Maybe it was even a little unusual for him to be this happy, but he was going to damn well enjoy it. Like Christmas, New Year’s Eve didn’t normally mean much to him. Despite all the new beginnings and dumb resolutions stuff people touted, it was just another day and shit usually stayed the same. Which was fine actually, because Dean happened to like how things were most of the time. But this year felt different. The future was unfurling in front of him. It was bright and good and full of Cas and love and happiness and things Dean hadn't thought that he'd get to have, hadn’t even really felt like he deserved. It felt like a new beginning. Sappy as that was, Dean was going to make the most of it. And making the most of it right now meant celebrating a holiday he didn’t usually care about, because it turned out he did care if he got to share it with Cas.
Dean found himself wishing that Cas would come to Kansas with him and meet Charlie then. It was too soon to be thinking about Christmas together, but Dean couldn’t help it. He wanted Cas to have a home-cooked Christmas dinner, to get to enjoy Ellen’s succulent roast beef and Dean’s mince pies, which didn’t actually have any mince in them but were filled with spiced raisins and sultanas.
Not that it was any better the one time he had shared a tent with someone he knew was interested rather than disgusted. It was almost worse, to be in that tempting nylon bubble, to have the illusion of being in their own little world while the reality was that only thin fabric separated them from disaster. Lamplight could cast shadows that would condemn them. Noises could be all too easily overheard. Sleeping in each other's arms was impossible when anyone could burst into their tent at any time.
Cas did loosen up eventually, but that didn’t make him a better dancer. He had sped up and his movements were frenetic. It looked like he might be having some kind of fit. He was smiling exuberantly though, and the expression made the gooey thing in Dean’s chest get even gooier. His heart might have actually melted by this point. Cas was waving his arms around wildly. Apparently, he had taken the DJ at his word when he told them to put their hands in the air like they just didn’t care earlier. Given how much Dean knew Cas did care, about everything, it was nice to see him let go like this. Still, he was kind of surprised Cas hadn’t hit anyone yet, what with all the flailing. Single Ladies came on and the manic enthusiasm of his dancing ramped up a notch.
He was staring too much again.
“Well, I mean, I didn’t grow up in a cult or anything, but my childhood wasn’t exactly some normal, apple-pie life either.”
It was stupid, just a flash of a familiar-looking man through the shop window. Cas knew it wasn’t him, but he’d still had to root himself to the spot and cling white-knuckled to the counter to stop himself from running outside and going after the man. Meg had to snap him out of the daze he was in when it looked like he was going to continue to stand there frozen all afternoon. He’d had to cancel his last appointment that day because his hands were shaking.
Cas didn’t think he’d woken him, but Dean made a small noise and rolled over onto his side as well, arm going back around Cas and pulling him against his chest, either consciously or unconsciously, he wasn’t sure. Cas put his hand over Dean's where it rested on his heart and finally drifted off.
Seeing a bare-chested Plant in the video for ‘Whole Lotta Love’ might not have been
Yeah, okay, Dean could admit that, on occasion, he was a bit of a drama queen.
Sam wandered into the library while Dean was sitting on Cas’s lap. He looked a little surprised by his brother's position but didn't say anything. Frankly, Dean thought he should be grateful they had all their clothes on. Ever the nerd, Sam reminded them there was reading to be done. Cas, who was rather more diligent than Dean was at the moment, agreed that they should get on with the research they’d abandoned yesterday. Sadly, sitting in Cas’s lap wasn’t really the best position for getting work done, so they’d all gone to sit at the table. Dean sat next to Cas as they researched and it was the same as any other day except Cas's chair was closer to his and Cas's hand was resting on his thigh as they read.
“Oh... yeah?” Dean shifted on the bed. “So, er, what are you wearing?” he asked because he was pretty sure that was universal code for I’m-totally-up-for-some-phone-sex-if-you-are.
“Alfie’s running late,” Cas told Meg the next morning. “Can you cover reception for half an hour? You know I’m no good at dealing with people.”
Castiel watched him as he picked at his food warily. He was pretty sure that Dean didn’t actually believe that he was trying to poison him, but he wasn’t certain. He took a big bite of his own bacon cheese burger to set an example, like a parent demonstrating that the food was actually edible to a recalcitrant 4-year-old who didn't want to eat his vegetables. Cas had hoped that good food might placate Dean, it usually worked after all... well, food or sex worked but he didn’t think the latter would help right now. He tried to make conversation but only got grunts and monosyllabic answers in return. Great, Dean had gone from 4-year-old to teenager. He wondered if that counted as progress. It didn’t feel like it. Cas put his burger down.
Comes with a leather daddy outfit way cooler than Ken's and a massive dick!
“What? I was trying not to make a fuss, you jerk. I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable, okay? You never talk about this stuff.” Sam put a hand on his arm and squeezed. “But seriously, I’m happy for you and I'm happy you told me. And if you want to talk, I'm right here.”
“Well, yeah, what do you want a parade or something? That's not till June man!”
“I’m sort of seeing someone. It’s early days yet,” Dean said eventually.
“I've seen the faces you make when we’re drinking whiskey and you think I’m not looking.”
“I have three older brothers. I’m pretty sure our father only had children because he thought blood kin would be his most loyal, or perhaps just the most unquestioning, followers. He was half right. My two oldest brothers are still senior members of the Church as far as I know. I’m pretty sure Michael is a true believer. But I think Luke might be a snake in the garden, just waiting for our father to show weakness so he can swoop in and take over. Gabriel left the Church when I was a kid and never looked back.”
Dean broke the kiss for a moment to say, “You are just so...” Apparently at a loss for words to finish that sentence, he nuzzled into Cas’s neck. “I want you so badly,” he breathed into the sensitive skin there. “I love you so much,” he whispered against his throat between sucking and licking. After a few minutes of increasingly feverish kisses, Dean drew back and tried to slow down enough to think.
He could feel the angel’s eyes on his back as he stomped over to the bed and pulled the duffle out from under it. Dumping it on the mattress, he riffled through it until he had a pair of jeans and an olive-green shirt. He went to change in the bathroom because the angel was still staring at him. Dean felt a little less vulnerable when he emerged properly dressed. Wearing pyjamas in front of a stranger felt far too intimate, even if they covered just as much as jeans. Right, real pants accomplished, now what was he supposed to do? He looked around the cabin but there just didn’t seem to be much in the way of entertainment. There was small bookshelf against the wall opposite the couch. It was piled with books, a mix of novels and occult texts, but Dean didn’t think he could focus on reading right now. He felt restless and edgy.
They joined Sam for breakfast in the kitchen before heading to the Dean Cave (‘I’m still not calling it that,' Sam insisted, in what was, frankly, a very Scrooge-like fashion). Dean had moved the wonky Christmas tree from the library to the Dean Cave, which was much cosier, and added some twinkly red and green lights to the tree, which he felt upgraded it from pathetic to festive. There was a scattering of presents around the base. The fact that there were presents at all was pretty rare and the fact that they were actually wrapped- no matter how messily- in bright Christmas paper was rarer still. It was a little slap dash but that was just the Winchester way. It didn’t matter, it was Christmas and he was here with his family. It was perfect and Dean could feel a giant, goofy grin spreading across his face as they all sat down cross legged in front of the tree.
He shoved that thought to the back of his mind.
Cas wiped at his face and realised it was wet. Dean must have noticed his tears at the same time because he drew Cas into his arms and held him close, stroking his back.
That was what it felt like, the soft velvety skin of a peach and Dean wanted to keep running his hands over the short hairs that tickled his fingers. Cas smiled at him.
“That’s covering the swastika, right?”
“Not what we’re going for, babe,” Dean said chuckling.
(See the end of the chapter for
“None of my friends had a TV either.”
Dean hovered around Cas’s hipbone for a moment, not because he was nervous or anything, just because Cas had nice hipbones and he wanted to lick them. In this position, his mouth was only a couple of inches from Cas’s hard dick. In for a penny, in for a pound, he supposed... well, there wasn’t going to be any pounding just yet, but he didn’t only want to touch Cas, he wanted him in his mouth. He looked at Cas’s cock, part awe, part apprehension, wondering where to start. Dean had received plenty of blowjobs, it shouldn’t be too difficult to reverse engineer the process, right? His hand was still on Cas’s cock, he stopped stroking and held it round the base, angling it up slightly toward his mouth. Dean gave the head a slow lick. The noise of absolute rapture that Cas made at the first touch of his tongue sent a thrill through Dean. It also guaranteed that Cas was going to be getting a lot more blow jobs in the future.
“It’s all right, Dean. We’re all right,” Cas told him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t realise either,” Cas said, giving Dean’s knee a squeeze under the table. “Gabe and I mostly talked about the past when we met up. He didn’t mention Sam by name and when Sam called him Richard, I didn’t make the connection, even after Gabe said he goes by his middle name now.”
Bobby snorted. “I don’t need to harangue Jo. I know what that one’s up to. She still lives under my damn roof and we work together every day. Plus, she’s got more sense than the both of you boys put together—”
“Siri, play New Year’s Day by Taylor Swift.” He glared at Sam again. “Pop! Pop, in my own car, Sam. Look what you made me do.”
Dean carried on because that was what he always did. But he was just going through the motions. He made himself at home in cabin that had appeared in the woods shortly after he got here. It was set a fair distance from where his family lived. It was quiet and private. There was a road leading away from it that he could drive Baby down to go see his folks. So, that was what he did. He saw his family. He saw his old friends. He pretended he was fine, but inside he felt like he was dying. How do you die when you’re already dead?
“It wasn’t my intention to mislead you,” Dean said carefully. “I hope I didn’t do something you didn’t want...” It wasn’t quite a question, because he was too afraid to actually ask it.
“Yes, I’ll join you,” Cas said, allowing Meg to pull him off the couch and out of his funk.
Dean had to admit that kind of sounded like him. Still, “Pretty presumptuous to bring this amount of lube if you ask me!”
“I thought—”
“Bedroom?” Cas asked a moment later.
Dean took a big bite of his own dog.
“Like from
Cas wasn’t the kind of person who thought that everything happened for a reason, that smacked of fate and destiny and other things he didn’t believe in. What he did believe was that sometimes good things could come from the bad things you’d been through and that gave him comfort. He didn’t think he’d be as strong as he was if he hadn’t been forged in fire.
“And how it’s more about the male gaze than female pleasure. I know, Charlie.”
“So? I called you a twink when you were his age,” Meg said, continuing to go through supplies on the shelf in the corner.
“Pops didn't approve of ‘those Hollywood types’.” Gabriel did some very Cas-like air quotes that made Dean smile. “I'm pretty sure he meant the gays, though equally it could have been liberals or atheists or whatever other godless people he'd decided were involved in entertainment.” He shrugged. “So, we didn't have a television growing up. Cas was a good kid who just put up with being bored, but I always snuck out to watch stuff at my friends’ houses. TV was an escape from what was happening at home, you know?”
“That is a gross mischaracterisation of the situation! I am not wriggling around,” he said, contradicting himself, as he moved like it was a compulsion. It was a small exploratory movement, like he was trying to calculate the proportions of that erection by how it felt against his stomach. He could feel the entire length of the man’s body against him, hot and hard, the trench coat and Dean’s own t-shirt and thin cotton pyjama pants weren't much of a barrier. Dean’s breath was coming out faster than the brief scuffle warranted. “I- I was subduing you.”
“Oh, right, you haven't met her.” It was bizarre that Cas hadn’t met her. It seemed like he should know all the important people in Dean’s life already and be sharing dumb in-jokes with them by now. “My best friend, Charlie.”
“No,” Cas said firmly, meeting his eyes for a heartbeat. “It’s not your fault. We’re both responsible. You should have said something, but so should I. It was just nice not to have you pushing me away...”
“You need to get back in bed,” the guy told him in a gravelly voice.
“God, I swear I find more out about people’s fucked up relationships than I ever wanted to know doing this job,” Jo said.
“Liked... shit, you liked it when you were human but it’s not the same now, is it?”
“Hey, watch it, you idiots,” yelled a red-faced guy as he came round the corner and barrelled right into them.
“We’re standing in front of the only exit, I'm pretty sure he hasn’t gone anywhere.”
Somehow, he wasn't sure how since it certainly hadn't been his intention, Cas found himself in the passenger seat of the Impala. Dean slid into the driver's seat, grabbing his phone instead of a cassette to put on some music.
At the same time, Dean couldn’t help but picture what Cas’s hands were actually doing, stroking his own gorgeous cock. He wondered if Cas was playing with his balls too or if his hand was exploring further back, slick fingers rubbing his hole or slipping inside him. He opened his mouth to ask him, but all that emerged was a helpless moan.
They made their way to the bedroom leaving a trail of scattered clothes behind them. Once naked, Cas let himself be tumbled onto the bed under Dean. He revelled in the sensation of Dean’s body covering him, pushing him down into the memory foam. The mattress was somehow even comfier in the afterlife. Dean’s bed was covered in a plaid comforter that reminded Cas of his own bed back in the bunker. He wondered if that was deliberate, if Dean had wanted to feel close to him, to think of this as their bed and hope that Cas would join him here. He ran his hand over the soft fabric.
“I'm the one who loves you above all others, so I suppose you could call that a boyfriend, though it hardly seems like an adequate word,” Cas said seriously.
The momentary panic of last night had faded by the morning though and Dean was feeling more sanguine. Spending the night sleeping next to each other had calmed him.
“It was a compliment, sweetheart. I like the pictures. This is one of yours, right?” Dean nodded towards a sketch showing the head of a beautiful young woman surrounded by writhing snakes.
Cas had wanted so much to transform the ugliness of his childhood into something beautiful. It could never be undone, memories were etched into his soul, words could never be unsaid, pain could never be unfelt, but perhaps it could be transmuted. The things that had hurt him could be turned into things that gave him strength.
It’s not like you’re Sherlock. You knew my first and last name, of course you figured out who I am! Sam said you worked in TV. I thought he was dating an actor called Richard who lives in San Francisco, not a business owner called Gabriel who lives in LA!” Dean felt a little foolish, but he’d already found Cas’s brother—he had no reason to keep looking into Gabriel once he knew how to contact him. “And I thought you changed your name to Loki anyway.”
“I’m sorry, Cas, I remember, I’m so sorry-” His voice cracked on the last word and he gulped convulsively.
Dean got mugs out from the cupboard while Cas put coffee in the French press. He leant against the counter as he waited for it to brew. Dean sat at the table and opened the sketchbook, eager to see what Cas had drawn. The sketch was of Dean sleeping, mouth slightly open, drool at the corner of his lips.
“Hey Cas,” he started nervously.
“I might have had sex with him... but c’mon, it’s just sex. Two consenting adults scratching an itch. No big deal. I can’t believe he tattled on me. Jeez, I wouldn’t have fucked him if I’d known he was going to be such a girl about it.” Dean rolled his eyes and continued to scramble the eggs.
“I can't believe you didn't tell me!” Dean accused. “How long have you known?”
“Just doodling. I’m trying to decide what to get for my next tattoo. I want to fill this space—” Cas held up his arm to display the bare skin on the back of his right forearm. Some of the jellyfish tentacles from the front wrapped around the sides slightly, but the back of his forearm was mostly blank. “—I just haven’t decided with what yet. I'm tempted to get a tardigrade.”
“Ooh, coffee,” she said and poured herself a cup.
Okay, historically, that might be part of the reason Dean watched baseball but “We’re just here because I thought you’d enjoy it,” he told Cas honestly.  Anyway, the pants weren’t that figure-hugging, not many players still wore those tight, old-fashioned breeches, more’s the pity.
“Come on, let’s go inside. It’s not just meant to be looked at, it’s meant to be experienced.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and led him up the ramp.
More than that, though, he wanted to spend time with him. Cas’s body and the way he used it made Dean hope that they could have sex again, but it was Cas's personality that made him hope they could go on an actual date.
“So, uh, you have your own company?” Dean said.
“I loved my father,” Cas said, which was not at all what Dean had expected him to say. “I tried so hard to be the son he wanted. He barely paid me any attention when I was young, but by the time I was fifteen or so, all my brothers had disappointed him. I think he saw me as his last chance to mould a suitable second in command. For a while, I was his favourite, but I turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. He shouldn’t have been surprised. He always knew there was something wrong with me—”
“I’m not even gay,” Alfie said.
Savage slashes of black paint were scrawled over what, at first glance, looked like a beige background. On closer inspection, the background was covered in soft washes of of pale blue, pink and orange, with seemingly random patterns of pixels dotted throughout the canvas.
The question was about more than just undressing Cas. He didn’t know what he was allowed to do anymore, didn’t want to push too hard or too fast. Didn’t want to push Cas away again.
Dean fixed them both coffees and brought out a plate of mince pies to snack on while they watched TV. They’d spent several nights bingeing
Jesus, that was bad. If
“Let's get you a hotdog,” Dean said.
“What is this place anyway?” Dean asked, more to break the silence than because he really cared.
Meg thought it was hilarious, Cas thought it was annoying, but he did his best not to let on because he knew that would only make it more hilarious to Meg. He had to admit, he would be amused if he wasn’t in such a godawful mood.
Gabriel was looking like his usual smug self again when he said, “So, how long do you think it would have taken you to figure it out, Deano?”
“Yeah, I do.” She grinned smugly at him.
They stumbled through the little dirt parking lot. No one else was out there, so Dean shoved Cas up against the Impala and kissed him, tongue sweeping inside and taking ownership of the angel’s mouth, hand grabbing the back of his neck to hold him exactly where he wanted him, leaning his weight in to pin him to the car.
“And did you? Need it?”
Sometimes they were ridiculed on general principle and sometimes they were angrily retaliated against by people they’d offended first. No one really liked hearing that they were sinners who were already damned, so it probably wasn’t surprising that most people reacted to the insult with varying degrees of hostility.
“Hey Zuzu, I’m cooking breakfast,” Cas told her.
“You know, just because you’ve seen it in porn doesn’t mean that real lesbians feel the need to strap on a dick on every time they fuck.”
was fine, but
“I see who you are, Dean. It’s you who doesn't see the truth of yourself. You’re a good man and you are worthy of love.”
“So...” Dean said and faltered. He had absolutely nothing to follow that up with and the hot guy wasn’t helping. He just stood there staring at Dean impassively, head slightly cocked, waiting for whatever highly intelligent thing was going to come out of Dean’s mouth. “Um... uh... does the teardrop mean you’ve killed someone?”
“Fuck yes!” Fuck yes, he did. He wished Cas was there so badly. Dean’s hand sped up on his cock. His right hand was stroking his length while his left hand slid down from his chest to cradle his balls, two fingers pushing up against that sensitive spot just behind them, imagining the whole time it was Cas's hands on him.
Oh god, did Dean just accidently quote Madonna? What was becoming of him?
“So, what are you saying?” Sam asked slowly. Dean could hear his patience fraying and that only made him more frustrated.
CW- Mention of suicide
Alfie wrinkled his nose and said, “Not the point, Cas. I wouldn’t want her to call me that either!”
I hope you liked it! Maybe leave a kudos and comment to let me know if you did!
(See the end of the chapter for
It was such a relief when Bobby had taken them in and it had felt doubly like finding a home when Dean realised the Impala was out back in the old junkyard. It had been there since the accident a couple of years ago. John had sold it to Bobby as scrap,
“I mean, I know I'm not the expert on peen, but that sounds wrong. What are you just gonna wear 20 of them? Just rings the whole way up your dick?”
Cas squinted sceptically at her. Meg was wearing ankle boots with studded straps, tight, black jeans and a short, black leather jacket over a mottled purple vest. She looked exactly as she normally did, right down to the chunky necklace she habitually wore.
It took Dean a long time to fall asleep that night.
“Hey there.”
I was going to have Dean be more offended that Charlie thought he listened to Slipknot, but then I found out about
Cas laughed again, and the sound was so warm and intimate that Dean didn’t feel stupid at all for his lack of phone sex finesse. It felt like Cas accepted the different sides of him. He was as happy to laugh with Dean when he was being awkward as he was to flirt with Dean when he was being sexy. His laugh turned into a sigh and Dean thought he could hear the sound of skin on skin on the other side of the phone.
Dean was aware of the lube still lying on the mattress. He thought about coating his fingers with it and pushing them inside Cas. But that was something he really thought you should ask before trying. His mouth was so delightfully full of Cas's cock and he didn't want to stop what he was doing long enough to have a conversation about doing more. Probably better not to overcomplicate things the first time round anyway, better to focus on one new thing at a time. So, he focused on Cas’s cock, taking a little more of it into his mouth. His hand was still wrapped around the base, so he only took in another inch or so. As well as this was going, he didn’t think he was ready to start trying to deep throat Cas like a damn porn star. Dean rubbed his tongue along the underside of Cas’s cock as he guided the head toward the roof of his mouth. He sucked lightly and felt Cas tense beneath him, so he did it again and kept up the movement of his tongue. The frequency of Cas’s moans increased until he made a particularly loud sound and Dean’s mouth suddenly filled with come. Despite this being the outcome Dean had intended, the burst of liquid still felt like somewhat of a shock, though a good one. He pulled back and swallowed hastily.
“That's not what I meant.”
“Cas,” Dean said smirking.
It was some of the best sex that Dean had ever had. Certainly, the best one-night stand he'd ever had. It made him hope that this wasn't just a one-night stand. He wanted Cas to fuck him again (and he wanted to know if Cas would let him fuck him back once they knew each other better. Maybe if Dean told him his middle name?).
“You know you can take the finger off,” he said, bumping Cas’s shoulder with his own. Dean had only really bought the silly thing as a joke but Cas seemed to be treating it very seriously. He had switched the finger over to his left hand while he ate his hotdog but still had the foam digit pointing out towards the field insistently.
“So, how’s working with Bobby going now you’re a fully licensed PI?” Dean asked Jo once they were on the road. Jo had got her license only last month.
His obvious desire quenched something in Dean, some need he had to be wanted. He knew Cas wanted him, could feel it against his hip if nothing else, but he thought it was more than that, more than the physical. As strong as the physical attraction was, it felt like there was something else between them, an emotional connection, a bond, something profound.
“Shit, shit, I’m sorry,” a disembodied voice said.
Dean’s eyes sprang open. Cas’s face was only inches away and his bright blue eyes were already looking at Dean.
“He knows I’m hella queer, right? Why would I use gay as an insult?” Meg asked, finally turning to face Cas.
touching him. Finally, it was his hand on Dean’s cock instead of Dean’s own while he tried not to imagine it was Cas’s. The reality was so much better than the dream. He felt his orgasm building higher and higher until he came with a sound that was almost a shout.
“Can’t wait, huh? Get in the backseat,” Dean ordered, looking very pleased with himself and opened the door.
Whatever they were doing, they were doing it exclusively. Dean thought that was a good sign. They’d had a talk about it shortly before Dean had flown out. Cas had casually said that he wasn’t sleeping with anyone else at the moment and suggested that they stop using condoms if Dean wanted to and they were both clean. Cas had shown him the results of his last STD panel from a month before they’d met, and Dean had shown him his own results. They were from several months earlier, but Dean hadn’t slept with anyone else in that time. He’d offered to get another test, though. ‘It’s okay, I trust you,’ Cas had said. That had to mean something, right?
“I meant to say something sexier than that, okay? You turned my brain to mush with your”—Dean lowered his voice to a growl—“‘I’m gonna fuck you so hard’. How’s a man supposed to think straight after that?”
Grabbing the lube, Dean set to work gently preparing Cas. He eased a lubricated finger inside him, moving slowly in and out until Cas’s body was relaxed enough to accept another. He pushed his fingers a little deeper, gently pressing to find the right spot. He heard Cas’s sharp intake of breath as he found his prostate and rubbed against it.
“It's like a small bear. If anything, you think it'd be a koala, right? Never made sense to me.”
The exercise was didactic. It reminded them of the chasm between The Blessed Children of God and other lesser mortals. It wasn’t just that these outsiders didn’t see the light, it was that they refused to be
“Pretty much, yes,” Cas said blandly.
So, he’d done his best to keep the peace and hadn’t gone running to Bobby for help, not when he’d been cold and hungry, not when John hadn’t been home for a week, not when John had hit him, but he’d gone to Bobby when John hit Sam. Dean hadn't necessarily expected safety for himself, but if he couldn’t keep Sammy safe, that was a problem.
Cas thought back to that time years ago. He and Meg had been living together already, though in a worse apartment, in a worse part of town with two other roommates who were also the worst. Meg had been dating a guy who was majoring in something scientific at university, organic chemistry maybe, he didn’t remember. Meg’s then-boyfriend had been doing his homework at their place. She’d seen him drawing molecular structures and thought they looked cool, so she’d got him to draw some for her and used them to sketch out a tattoo.
