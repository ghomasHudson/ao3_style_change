She nods and waves, adding that they’ll guard his seat with their very lives.
Greg kisses him back and closes his eyes, shivering once as their soft kiss echoes through the empty room. “
It should have made everything worth it. It should have been the pinnacle of it all—fuck the Gold Medal. Fuck the sponsorships and the interviews and the cheers. Fuck the Union Jack around his shoulders.
I chuckle, picturing a whizzing young Sherlock Holmes dashing down the Cambridge hallways with a chemistry beaker in his hand. Solving mysteries and shoving people out of the way who stood in his path. Fearless and brilliant.
I was afraid of him that day. That day and the whole two weeks after when we got up into the mountains. (We was ranching, herding sheep. I realize now I don’t know if we ever said. He kept the camp together and I rode my horse up to the pasture to shoo away the coyotes. Maybe you think that’s all dumb work, or uninteresting at least. I think you get the picture).
Watson, still smiling down at his hands: “Yeah, he has the tendency to do that.”
“Jesus Christ,” John groans, pulling once at his hair with balled fists. “I knew today was a terrible idea. Going on air with you.”
“He’s alive but we can’t tell if he’s breathing,” he pants out. The other men nod and run towards the shore where Sherlock is almost in. He slides off his board in the shallows and catches Dickie underneath his arms, dragging him backwards up towards the sand and out of the last clutches of the waves.
The radio: “You’re already at the depth threshold for just two spotters. Wait until Gerold arrives with his backup to go deeper. He’s two minutes out.”
The journalists hear him instantly, and like an army of drones, a hundred camera lenses point towards his face in the corner, lights flashing, the near-giddy gasp of recognition. He pales when his face is suddenly broadcast up on the screen, ‘Family Cam’ floating in bright letters above his head.
And Sherlock had somehow fallen asleep before he could even finish sorting out his perfect line of white powder, and woken up hours later to someone’s hands in his hair, someone’s lips on his cheek. Someone who’d clearly been sitting next to him for a long, long time without saying a word. Who’d cleaned up so that the coffee table was now bare. Someone who simply nodded and then said, “
“Why are you hiding from me?” I ask.
I startled laugh escapes from my chest. I reach up and cling to his wrists with shaking fingers. I want to ask him how the hell he could ever forgive me – how he would ever want to see my face again in this place.
“I’m not well in the World,” I say quietly. I can feel him listening beside me – body still. “I only have a couple weeks. They told me a month at most.”
I turn sideways to look at him. The sun is setting cross the horizon out his side of the window, framing his hat with gold.
-China Beach was a real place in Vietnam. Soldiers adopted it as a sort of resting place, especially for recovering wounded, and they really did built their own lifeguard tower and surfboards. There are very inspirational and emotional firsthand accounts from veterans who surfed at China Beach during the war, even if it was only for one wave like John. For many soldiers, it was an emotionally healing experience to reconnect with surfing in the midst of the chaos of war. If you'd like to learn more, the California Surf museum has an exhibit up chronicling the history of soldiers surfing at China Beach during the war. The
Greg nods understanding. “Then I will not be at the top. Nothing different.”
“Obviously . . .”
“Could’ve been other reasons for him dropping out,” John cuts back, then winces at the harsh tone of his voice. He tries to think of an apology for a few moments, then gives up and resigns himself to silence. Maybe then she’ll actually take a hint and stop trying to—
“Fuck yeah,” John breaths. Sherlock’s shaking hands clutch hard enough on his hips to bruise, groaning as John fucks into his mouth.
He swallows down a sickening wave of nausea and every curse word he knows. “Then it’s a deal.”
And John’s erection is pressed into his hip, his wet lips in his ear. Hot, obscene words sending fire through his body. “That’s right . . . fucking lie there . . . take it . . . watch him . . . You think you’re the only gold medalist here? We’ll fucking show you—”
I nod, cringing at the word said out loud in his beautiful bedroom. Ugly and raw in what was once a safe and comforting air. Making his crisp white sheets feel dirty.
Instead I hum, look out the tiny square window of the trailer. “How long you known this fella?” I ask.
Holmes: “You’re asking me about this since I’ve been so tight-lipped to you about my history.”
He looked at me, wide eyed and amazed. “Oh, John,” he breathed, and I giggled and grabbed frantically at my phone and took a video, capturing the first moment I think either of us truly realized that we were

still young, and that he desperately
She nods. “A spouse can.”
Greg tries to smile again, but it fails even worse than before. “It was not horrifying,” he says. He runs his hand through his hair, rucking it up even more. “It was . . . it was magnificent. It was your . . .
Sherlock reaches both arms above his head and stretches luxuriously across the sheets before turning to shuffle closer to John, facing him with his hands folded in between them, utterly relaxed. John reaches out and covers Sherlock’s hands with his, smelling the combined, sleepy warmth of their limbs.
Greg’s tempted to say it would be too late even if he wasn’t happy with it—the issue, when it dropped the week before, had broken the magazine’s all-time sales record, going viral online too in a matter of hours. The expected pushback had been there, little pockets of Twitter complaining of how
Greg’s eyes fly open. He desperately searches for John’s shooting lane down below, looking for the huge red X for the shot he just missed . . .
“So my mom shows up late. Totally out of her mind already. I heard all this yelling and went over to see what the hell was going on, and my mom was standing by the food table calling the pastor’s wife a bitch because she copied her potato salad recipe. Then she picked up the bowl and threw it on the ground in the dirt. For some reason I remember that the only thing I was shocked at was that her bra strap was hanging down her arm. She was always dressed up so perfectly. I’d never seen her bra strap before.”
They don’t say anything. John can feel Greg’s chest pressing the unfamiliar weight of Sherlock’s necklace against his chest, the wood already warmed by his skin. Greg thumps his back hard before stepping aside so Molly can jump in, wrapping her arms around John’s neck as he buries his face in her long brown hair. Sherlock steps up behind him, running his palm up the small of John’s back, and as Molly steps away John fears for a moment that everything will turn strained and uncomfortable – all four of them standing at the top of the path to the cliff without any idea what to say, the memory of Sherlock’s lips on his still burned into everyone’s mind.
He’s never felt sensation like this before in his life, never even had the guts to think about the words currently pouring from Sherlock’s mouth. He drinks them in like a man dying of thirst, gasping against Sherlock’s chest as he lets himself be lost at sea to the sound of Sherlock’s voice in his ear and the feel of his hand caressing the thick and throbbing length of his erection.
He’s interrupted by the blare of the alarms behind us back in the hangar. Without finishing his sentence, Greg leaps to his feet, rips off the mic, and sprints back to the helipad. A mechanic runs out to meet him, holding out his bag and helmet. We run to keep up.
Sherlock is jogging towards him across the sand, eyes worried. John flops down into the sand and releases a shaky sigh, running his hands over his face and trying to hide his embarrassment.
Instead he tells me he done went and solved a murder.
John tells the alarm in his mind to shut the fuck up. He raises himself up off of Sherlock’s hips and leans down to press an open, wet kiss to the tattoo one last time.
It’s Sherlock crying, weeping like that very first night. Leaning forward over the sink and bracing himself with his hands while his pregnant belly hangs down in front of him, his legs trembling as he sobs out the emotions he’s kept in check for nine long months. I rushed to him, cupped the side of his face with my hand and brought his forehead to my own. Words poured out of me – things that even until now I had never told him. How he saved me just when I thought of putting the gun to my head, how I would follow him to the ends of the earth, how I was born to love him, born for that purpose and that alone. How he was my sun.
“I’m sorry,” John says in the silence.
He’s afraid.
Sometimes, when John wakes up in the middle of the night with Greg lying in his arms, his body stable and warm, the soft breadth of his naked back so achingly
le champion de France : the champion of France
“You’re not coming?” John asks. Sherlock notices he’s still wearing his tank top.
like me!”
Greg comes to his senses. He lurches forward and grabs the back of Sherlock’s jacket. The fabric rips, and Sherlock curses at him, fighting with him as Greg yanks him back, finally shoving him into his seat.
“So you don’t deny it, then?” Sherlock lobs back.
I’ve made up my mind. I won’t go back. Five Visits was enough, in my book, I think.
Watson: “You know, these other guys I work with, the ones who grew up here around the Alps . . . their whole families for generations have lived around the mountain. They grew up with the mountain guide rescue teams way back in the day, carrying the bodies down the mountain on foot. And then they saw the advent of the helicopters, looking up at the flash of red in the sky that meant a rescue. And they all thought, because they’ve told me, that those guys in the helicopter must be heroes. That they wanted to be them.”
Watson: “This is why. The . . . what we do. The way we are. This was why. I couldn’t . . . I couldn’t do anything, all I could think was . . . that you were. . . that you couldn’t breathe –”
I can’t believe what I’m hearing. The words are like nonsense sounds, and my brain hurts tryin’ to fit them all together and make any sense.
“They did nothing of the sort,” Sherlock says. “I haven’t even practiced in two days. I was late because I was an insufferable idiot who couldn’t overcome my own nerves about—”
Sherlock watches him go, chest heaving. He finally forces himself to roll his eyes, without exactly knowing why, and turns to leave when he spots something glinting in the sand. He reaches down in the moonlight and picks up a bullet casing, dropped a few inches from where Johnny had shoved Sherlock back from him. He doesn’t have to think hard to know exactly where the bullet casing is from.
Oh no. Oh heavens no. He is not going to lose it on this podium. Goddammit he will keep it together. He is the World Record holder. He is the fastest skier in the world. He is rude and unapproachable and inhuman. He is
I don’t sleep. Maybe I never will again. When the sun laps its hot blue tongue up over the edges of the mountains I shave with my pocketknife looking in the rearview mirror and slip on an old button down denim shirt that used to be Harry’s and a tanned leather jacket I’ve always had from who knows where. I was bigger than Harry before I left. He was always a beanpole. Now I can only wear his clothes.
Sherlock can look. They hold each other’s gaze in the new silence, breathing hard into the vulnerable air, then John pats the side of Sherlock’s cheek and grins.
More cheers. The stands explode in American flags. John holds his breath as the letters fade in an animated burst of snowflakes, and they’re replaced by:
Sherlock’s heart thuds so hard he wonders how he can’t hear it. He waits for the inevitable wash of jealousy or betrayal, imagining Greg’s hands where only Sherlock’s have been, but it doesn’t come. “I didn’t know,” he manages.
After six years, Alma divorces me. She tells me one night as I’m sittin’ slouched facing the television set and looking straight through it to the beige wall that we still have time to get dressed up and go to the church social seeing as how it’s a Saturday night. The girls look over at me all hopeful from their place on the rug with a magazine. I think they’ve read through the same one more’n ten times, either that or them covers all look exactly alike.
“And furthermore, going back to the original point,
Sherlock’s heart shatters in his chest. He tries to sound calm. “It’s alright. We don’t have to, I never meant to make you – we can just . . . you don’t have to stay, you don’t have to –”
The screen fades away to the next competitor, and Greg’s attention immediately shifts to seeking John out among the skiers gathering near the start line roughly fifty yards away. He peers through the swarm of camera lenses and course officials, searching for the colors of John’s racing suit, or the sleek black and steel of his leg, or a pair of deep blue eyes.
“You surfed like hell, John Watson,” he’d said, and John had only had the strength to barely whisper “I promise” before he’d torn his gaze away from those pale eyes and practically ran into the terminal, leaving Sherlock alone and untouched on the sidewalk, looking like he’d just said goodbye.
John blanches before he remembers. “Right, yeah. When I come in last you’ll see it.”
Fade again to black, where a final line of text appears on the screen, just as the end credits music rises to a peak to conclude the show.
I called your granddaddy by his name and held his face. “It’s you and me,” I said, putting it into words for the first time.
John laughs, embarrassed. “Coming from the literal GQ model.”
“Thoughts for this final? You know these waves better than anyone.”
“Looks like he’s working again,” John says to Greg with a laugh as he hops around the other side of the bed, using the wall for balance. “All you need to do is say something factually incorrect and it’ll get him to speak.”
Finally Scotty responds. “You still look like you’re angry.”
Greg finally speaks. “So, Scotty. You and him. . .”
“You already have what you want,” I say. “But she’s . . . she’s –”
’ The flower may be tiny, but it scents the grasses around it.”
“Not a bad thing at all, you moron, just wait a damn second.” John practically flings himself from the passenger seat and jogs around the back of the Jeep. Sherlock is already cautiously opening his door by the time John walks up beside him, setting one long leg down into the soft dirt. John feels the sudden need to drop to his knees and wrap himself around the warm skin, feel the soft hair under his fingers, the curves of the muscles in his calves and the bones of his ankle. Instead he opens the door the rest of the way, steps into the V of Sherlock’s thighs, and kisses him before Sherlock can ask the question hovering on his lips.
He opens a new text to Greg, bites his lip, then thinks better of it and deletes. Greg goes to bed strictly at 10 p.m. during the Olympics, and, because Greg is a man of silly superstition and tradition and routine, Sherlock knows he hasn’t broken that rule even this time around. Texting him now would only earn Sherlock some horrible extra rep of something torturous in the training gym the next morning.
Sherlock kisses him deeply, shivering at the small moan in Greg’s mouth. He feels illicit and thrilling and desperate and alive. And he still isn’t even hard, though he can feel Greg is through his pants, but it’s deeper than that. It’s coming from Sherlock’s very core. Here is something he can show Greg Lestrade. Something he can give to him. Some small place where he can lead.
No. All of it was real. The awkward post-win interview with Sonya Wesley, during which Sherlock stared off camera and tried to look offputting, was real. Walter’s second hug around John’s shoulders, whispering, “
He wants to cross his arms and smirk that Johnny’s probably basking in the glory with no idea whatsoever that of course Sherlock knew there would be a good wave hiding behind that little closed out dud of a barrel. He didn’t study the ocean obsessively for his entire life for nothing.
Patrick groans and leans forward to put his head in his hands.
Text fades in to a black screen: Previously on “The Horn”. . .
John hazards a glance at the scoreboard to check Sherlock’s time, shivering as an odd release of tension works its way through his chest. He feels ridiculous for the flood of nerves he’d had around that last gate. But it was the look on Greg’s face last night, the urgency of his voice . . .
John stares at him, and he takes in a deep breath of salty flowers and sleep soft skin, and a warm smile curls at the corners of his mouth. Fresh, tingling relief courses through his body. He doesn’t have to crawl out of the water and throw on a hard hat and go to work today. He doesn’t have to spend the entire day waiting to go home to an empty apartment.
The wind rushes against his face and stomach as he drops in and feels his muscles take over. He follows in John’s wake as he snaps off the top and then does a quick cross step so he can hang five. Sherlock knows he’s showing off on purpose, trying to snap Sherlock out of his own mind and goad him into a competition of friendly fire. But Sherlock can’t get his limbs to move. He feels himself soar across the face of the wave and closes his eyes. Feels the droplets of spray splash against his cheek, his eyelids. Feels the solid, comforting weight of the earth beneath his feet. When he opens his eyes he nearly gasps. He sees John Watson before him, hanging five and looking like a smug bastard, outlined against the stunning Laguna beach mountains and a clear, open sky. For the first time in his life since he ever picked up a magazine advertisement, he sees something in the waves besides muscle and adrenaline and physics.
“Sherlock?”
He’ll send me a postcard with his new address in three months so’s I know where to send him my note with a date, time, and place.
think about how pale Sherlock’s eyelids had looked in the snow, how the little blue veins had looked like death sprawled across his skin, how the paramedics had pretended to ignore him as Greg held his face in his hands and told him that he needed him to come back, that he needed him to be okay, that he
A bright red helicopter bursts into view from a wall of fog and cloud. The camera tracks it as it soars majestically through the sky, revealing a full view of the glittering Matterhorn peak just behind the tail.
John can’t believe it. This group of surfers around him who were practically lining up to give Scotty Holmes shit are now standing here respectfully clapping one of the biggest waves of the year, not an “asshole” or “fairy” or “fag” to be heard. John can’t even bring himself to join in the applause. He watches breathlessly as Scotty emerges from the waves, saltwater dripping in sheathes down his bare, muscled chest, his soaked board shorts clinging to every contour of his thighs. Scotty straightens the aviators over his eyes and runs his hands back through his dripping curls before raising a hand once to the crowd in acknowledgement. Then he calmly struts through the chaos, hands the board back to a bewildered local spectator, and disappears off into the trees lining the beach.
“John?”
He sets his mouth in a firm line and tries to simultaneously look intimidating and invisible. Greg takes his hand back, saying “ok, then,” under his breath, and John’s shooting him a look that Sherlock refuses to meet head on. He can’t bear to see what it is. What it means.
I hear a low rumble next to me, and when he laughs his face becomes a different person. A part of my chest that’s been tight unclenches. He looks over at me like he can’t believe he’s having a good time, and then he passes me the cigarette from his lips and takes a long swig of whiskey.
Sherlock shoves down another bite of tasteless, mealy mush, hating the fact that he knows his cheeks have turned pink. “Must have slipped my mind.”
Some thoughts, notes, and context:
“Pardon me, come again?” John says.
Sherlock catches Greg’s eye knowingly; he’s thinking the same thing, unless Greg has entirely forgotten how to read the frown lines around Sherlock’s full lips, or the shadow across his eyes. Greg gives Sherlock a nearly invisible nod, even as he brushes his thumb across John’s jaw, and they share a quick, deep look which he wonders if John is pretending not to see.
He follows me at a safe distance into the trailer. I feel his eyes on me every second like he can’t look away. I sit down silently in the wooden chair and nod at the bed. His legs are too long for it, and his knees end up ‘round his chest. I keep waiting to wake up, to blink and open my eyes and see that I’m just sitting in an empty, silent trailer same as always.
,” and a “
John reels, his mind frantically trying to piece together what the hell is happening as Maxine gives him the guiltiest look known to man, and Ron looks incredibly anxious behind her.
And you know what? That fragile gift I held in my palms—it didn’t shatter.
I’m in great pain. She notices. Just when I think she’s going to suggest I sit down a young woman comes barreling out from a hallway, eyes wide.
“You know he’s just a Visitor, right? He doesn’t Stay.”
. . .”
The race is on.
Sherlock subtly shifts so his spine is even straighter against the back of the couch, making himself taller than everyone else. “Lestrade has been the biggest name to grace alpine skiing for the last two decades,” he says. Then, with a quick, jolting smile. “Just to keep everything factual.”
fiotte  :  homophobic slur
For one moment, he looks back up towards the sky. We see the helicopter above outlined by a sky of swirling mist and grey. And then, Holmes, in drastic red standing out on the landing skid of the chopper, keeping his grip on Watson’s rope with his back plastered up against the helicopter’s metal side.
And there’s the footage of his father crying in Vancouver when Greg blew him a kiss from the podium, the French flag draped about his shoulders. Final course times flash up on the screen, a montage of his reactions to his various wins. Announcers cheer him on and exclaim as he crosses finish line after finish line, flies around turn after turn. They whoop with enthusiasm as he smashes three Olympic Records in a row, as he sets the World Record in Turin, the youngest skier ever to do it. There’s him as the flag-bearer in the Opening Ceremonies, wild shots of him flying down the course on his skis, snow bursting through the sky and piercing the thick clouds, the slice of his skis across the ice, the flap of his forearms against the gates.
I force out choked words. “I’m sorry, I thought I –”
beating you.”
“That’s right, Sonya,” Rick says, beaming. “Sitting here on our couch is undeniable proof that love truly can conquer all and win the gold.”
The thank you for doing the work that will never again lead to Greg bending to receive a medal around his own neck.
Greg curses under his breath, and silently revels in the shiver it sends across John’s skin. “It’s
But Sherlock still opens his big mouth again, and he says something a little better, if only mildly. As if the reckless, impossible,
Watson: “So, yeah. Sherlock Holmes? I guess I just like a bit of a challenge.”
Someone from the beach yells. “I see him! I see him out there to the right!”
It’s the look John gave him right after that, when John had suddenly choked up and whispered, “
Sherlock takes another step closer and shakes his head. “I don’t understand,” he whispers back. His voice is nearly lost in the wind.
interview camera—what looks to be the NBC International Coverage team.
A ski with the Russian flag.
“What is it, love?” John breathes.
I see them again, year after year. They get darker, deeper, more red and black. I never once come after him.
Lahela’s eyes widen, and she reaches out her hand to shake his. “You’re as good as my Scotty then,” she says, eyes sparkling.
Sherlock knows he’s grown hard – can feel the low current of heat start to pulse between his legs. He goes to move his hand to the back of John’s hips to press them closer together, desperate for friction, when suddenly John pulls back from the kiss gasping and grabs his arm hard around the wrist.
. And he looked like that, right at the top. So . . .
John quickly glances at where Sherlock and Greg are still being bombarded by the NBC-International cameras, Greg speaking in streams of his beautiful, animated English, and Sherlock beside him with his arms crossed behind his back, giving one word answers with a purposefully bad accent.
Instead he hears “Passable, but you could have easily fit in two more cutbacks. You’re convinced your legs will give out sooner than they will.”
The rescuer, Holmes, sucks in a breath and quickly looks up. Barely visible through the crack thirty meters above his head, a sliver of sky can be seen, with another man being lowered from a hovering helicopter on a winch, swaying dramatically in the fierce winds.
“Honestly, John,” Greg hears in a muffled voice pressed into John’s chest. “I’m fine, it was only a—”
I pack up and leave at first light. I can hear him saying “let me cut you out, John” clear as day in my head as I step up into my truck and fight with the clutch to get it into first. I repainted it and put in a new engine myself two years ago. Ended up being only $50 cheaper than if I’d just bought myself a new one.
He shifts, and I know he felt me tense underneath him. He leans down and kisses me again, long and slow. His lips feel heavy against mine. Hard to breathe. “We should get back,” he says, eyes flickering down to my wrist.
Sherlock sighs, and Greg thinks that maybe they’ll just sit there together until the end of time. Maybe the Finals will disappear, be cancelled forever. Maybe the cameras and the course times and the news outlets will all just . . . vanish.
It has to be one of them; the fifth place skier had been nearly a full minute behind the leading pack of four.
Water pours in a soothing stream, gurgling against ceramic.
“John,” he whispers under his breath.
“Maybe we oughta get a sitter,” she says through the thin walls. “Take your friend to the Knife and Fork.”
The smile freezes on Sherlock’s face, eyes narrowed. “What?”
Back in the snow, Watson and Patrick gently kneel by the patient. We briefly overhear snippets of their conversation with her and her family in broken French – the family all speak Spanish, and Watson and Patrick’s French skills are rusty. Watson gives up trying Spanish after the first bungled sentence, shaking his head at himself self-deprecatingly with a grin.
Watson wipes the beads of sweat from his brow with his forearm, then shakes his head and takes a deep breath before throwing himself once more into the chest compressions.
You was inside with your granddaddy for a long time later, and the both of you thought I was still out with the animals. But when I was coming back I caught your bright, clear voice through the kitchen window. I beg your forgiveness I heard what you said—that I stayed still to listen.
“What do you mean you can’t command—?” Sherlock starts to say, the familiar indignation coming over his face, the thrill of the argument. But then he suddenly stops, and the emotion falls from his face, leaving it blank. He licks his lips and carefully readjusts his bandana. “Well,” Sherlock says, sounding exactly like he does in an interview when he’s trying his best to be polite, just to confuse Greg. “We both know I’ve skied poorly today and yesterday, obviously due to my previous two days of inaction. The Final is tomorrow. What do you suggest?”
The poor women backed off with a slew of apologies from me, but as a doctor I know they’ve probably dealt with far worse. We were alone again in the room, and I whispered into his ear that I was there, that I wasn’t leaving. It would always be two of us, except we were just adding two more.
“For what—for a fall? Like a normal human being?” John laughs. It sounds aggressive and raw.
“You think I
This was supposed to be
I hold on to his warm hips, and I think of my daughter.

“You waited for me?”
Not two hours later, they stand in their skis at the top of an empty slope, gazing down at a pristine blanket of fresh snow. Sherlock, unbeknownst to Greg and John, had called the lodge ahead and practically demanded that this course be shut down for “maintenance reasons” in preparation for their arrival. Greg doesn’t even want to know the amount of shameless name-dropping, bribing, and threatening Sherlock had to do to achieve that.
Sherlock finally meets his gaze, dropping the iPad to his lap. His roving, pale eyes seem to pierce John’s skin, stripping away the layers of his clothes and settling across his chest. John realizes that Sherlock’s room is incredibly warm, almost as if he’d cranked up the thermostat since John texted. Maybe he did.
But now I calmly sit up and pull on my worn jeans and boots, taking my time so my muscles are awake.
. . .
,” Greg says, tossing an extra pillow onto the bed. “Maybe then I can finally get a full night of rest for the first time in three years.”
Something roars through his stomach, flashing up his spine. He bounces up and down on his left foot just to feel the weight of the snow beneath him, the comforting flap of his gun slung across his back. Tension settles over the line like a thick blanket, muffling all sound like a disorienting, slow-motion dream.
celebrities. Although Sherlock’s fame largely comes from an entirely different reason—the thought of which still makes John break out in a cold sweat of raging indignant fury.
He leaves the meeting after a final handshake with Corporal Johnson with a very important signed piece of paper in his hand, then goes back to his room to change in a sort of slow-motion daze. He sets the very important signed piece of paper down on his bed. His roommate, an LW-6 from Mexico who only briefly nodded at John the night before, is gone.
John looks towards the sky. “Swear to god what the fuck did I ever do in life to get saddled with the most irritated dick on the planet?”
He doesn’t once allow himself to look back.
Greg hums. “You feel that you do not recognize yourself.”
And the next morning he’d sat on his bed staring at the wall after not sleeping a wink, and at six o’clock on the dot he’d heard Greg banging on his door saying, “Come on, you lazy asshole, I’ve been waiting for you down on the beach for twenty minutes!”
I know a lost cause when I see one. And suddenly, I don’t give a shit.
before she found out. Surely this nurse is too kind to wear that in front of me if she knew. We were run down on the streets and spit on by people wearing that symbol on their collars. Our names were turned in to the police by friends and family.
It was supposed to be easy. Deliver the supplies. Pass off some Intel. Say hello to the Army buddies exhausted from trekking on foot through the jungle. In and out in five hours. Come back on board with the same amount of bullets they left with.
John sucks in a breath and glances around them quickly, hoping nobody heard. Then he realizes that nobody could give a shit what Sherlock’s muttering over his shoulder to him. Not when two surfers are paddling their way out towards the tallest waves Waimea Bay’s seen in years.
“And these people are moving slower than molasses in January. We shoulda started ten minutes ago!”
” I’d said, dying. “
Over the last month or so, a few of you took time out of your own lives to come back here, even though you'd already commented, and leave *another* note telling me that you enjoyed re-reading this story, or thinking about it in between updates, or just to wish me well with the writing. I can't put into words how much that meant to me - how much all of your enthusiasm for this story means to me. Thank you thank you <3
He tucks away the handkerchief in his pocket and puts his hand back on my forehead. Then slowly, slowly, it travels down to rest on the side of my face. His palm is warm in the freezing air. Calloused but soft on my cheek.
He takes in a deep, lung filling breath of warm salty air, flowing through the veins under his skin. “I just . . . it’s sort of sad, isn’t it?” he says. “I mean, that we’re doing this alone.”
“Fuck, man, heard about your 9.8 – fucking primo ride you had there.”
He cannot remember, as they leap in the golf-cart to John’s endless grumbling, the last time John looked at him like he does now, just as Sherlock starts up the ignition and floors the gas. Like Sherlock is worth being kidnapped by at one o’clock in the morning. Like Sherlock is the Olympic torch. Like Sherlock is more glorious than every Afghanistan sunrise over the desert, than every ski course, than the first time John ever leapt in a cockpit and flew.

She stares at me, mouth half open. “Sherlock,” she says slowly. Then her eyes suddenly widen, and she clasps her hand to her mouth. “Oh, no. Oh, I’m so sorry,” she gushes. She toys with her long brown ponytail in her hand, worrying the edges on her lips.
Sherlock audibly swallows in the heavy pause, and he suddenly looks very young, almost afraid. “John,” he says, in a deep, wavering voice. “John, you know that I . . . that I love—”

We don’t say anything more. Don’t need to. I hand her the coat off the hook and stand in the doorway watchin’ until the Challenger disappears ‘round the first curve in the woods. It don’t occur to me until then that she didn’t even ask me who I was livin’ with. It’d be too much to expect she figured out from the framed picture on my nightstand and a couple pairs of boots on the floor that it was my old fishin’ buddy Scott come back from the grave. But then, she’s always been smarter than I realize.
He chuckles and shakes his head, turning back to the tools in his hands.
He started to cry as I helped him down onto the floor. I held his face in my hands and breathed slow and deep until his breathing matched mine. His tears were angry and afraid, so much so they felt like acid as they dripped over my fingertips. I held him, gave him every last ounce of strength that I had, told him the entire depths of my heart in words that only he and I will ever know.
“Come back quickly.” He kisses me again.
I laugh harder.
I distract myself, holding him closer to my skin. “What did you mean when you said you didn’t know?”
the announcers are yelling. No one is looking at him. No one is watching him be pushed around by the waves in the shallows, mocking the fact that none of those cheers are for him.
And we were so young then, Little W. I was just a year older than you. Maybe you feel like you ain’t young now—and I guess you ain’t. You’re going off to university and living your own independent life in the big city, and I was still just a cowboy herding sheep on a mountainside.
He has somehow just skied three-point-eight seconds faster than he needed to even claim the
Your comments and shared joy make this task more than worth it - thank you!
“Wanna see if he can hear me make that sound now?” John asks, in a rough voice that instantly makes Greg wrap his arms around John’s back, holding the breadth of John’s ribs as close to his body as possible as he tries not to start rutting against him on the spot.
Sherlock freezes, coffee mug half raised to his mouth. He looks dangerous.
“Ain’t nobody’s business but ours,” he says.
My nurse leans down to brush off a stray speck of imaginary dust from my shoulder. She’s wearing normal clothes – a wonderful green fitted dress that brings out the red in her hair. She told me she bought it impulsively when she was out buying me this new suit as a surprise.
The indignation rushes back. “It wasn’t like that . . . I haven’t just been . . . I’m perfectly capable of remaining in shape over two days’ worth of inaction . . . Food isn’t as important as . . . And how do you know whether I wasn’t showing up to the practices you decided to ignore? You sent me a single email and never bothered to check if I’d seen it! Never asked where I was!”
“You were working, so you told her you’d join her in a bit.”
Sherlock is across from me at our little wooden kitchen table – you remember, the one with all the acid burn stains on the top? - hunched over a beaker with something that looks like dog boogers in it. It’s the most comforting sight in the world. It’s beautiful. His churning mind is shooting tiny beads of fireworks into the slightly stale air of our flat on a lazy Sunday morning, and a tiny crumb of toast balances precariously on his upper lip, hitching a secret ride.
. You know you have been saying that same thing forever now, J?”
“That’s a fucking seven hour drive away from Los Angeles!”
I press him close to me and feel his heartbeat against my chest. He clings to me openly, like there’s a sadness in his arms.
and when the Lieutenant shoved him off the top of the diving platform into the freezing cold, chlorinated pool and he thought he was gonna die of fear before his back hit the water.
How he’d cried that night in his hospital room alone. How he’d dreamed of a sky as black as ink, and as endless as the seas, and Orion’s unblinking eye. How he’d called up a tattoo parlor the next morning on a whim.
“I didn’t mean—John,
“But you came all this way –”
Holmes: “I don’t see why that could possibly be of interest to your average home viewers, but yes, it is not uncommon. Watson is at least somewhat competent at strapping himself up so he doesn’t drop out of the harness and become Patient #2.”
We slow-motion pan over the men’s faces in the chopper. They all look subdued as they gaze out their respective windows. No one is talking.
Greg chuckles through his nose as he allows himself to be held, to melt into the smooth planes and soft hair of John’s slowly breathing chest. Allows himself the luxury of lying back in someone else’s arms, instead of doing the holding.
Anyway, we were standing in the sitting room of a suspected killer on the run. Lestrade and his team were there, of course. And Sherlock was staring down at the carpet as if it was a fascinating ancient rune he had just uncovered from a pile of hot sand in Egypt. He was mid-sentence telling me what a complete moron I was for failing to see that the plain white carpet was
faster than his coach Greg Lestrade’s long-standing World Record of 1:13.49, set, as we all remember, during his Gold-medal run at Sochi. It’s a shame for Super-Greg that his first coaching season will likely end in disappointment. You have to wonder if he’s standing out here wishing he’d chosen to coach Eric Thompson, the current American leader, instead, even if it meant betraying France for the States. I seem to remember Thompson was coach-shopping two seasons ago.”
Sherlock is hyperactive these days, and for him that’s really saying something. I feel he’s channeling his emotions over the pregnancy into learning everything he can about it, and so our flat is absolutely plastered in gynecology textbooks, the history of childbirth, old and new diagrams, etc. But aside from that life has pretty much gone on as before. We still have cases, I’m still at the clinic, Sherlock still never really sits down. We still cook and eat and argue and caress and watch telly and go for walks and tease and have early morning sex.
With his heart in his throat John starts to stand, thighs shaking and palms gripping handfuls of sand as he struggles to his feet, still blinking off sleep to realize that Sherlock Holmes just fucking surfed out into the waves without even saying goodbye, that absolute motherfucker –
Greg opens his mouth to agree, but John pushes off from leaning against the farthest wall and comes to stand with them, the three of them in a familiar huddle. Their sides brush together, sharing wisps of warmth.
Then Greg had put his hands on John’s shoulders and gently pushed him away, whispering “wait,” and John had realized what he’d just done and jumped back from Greg’s touch like a scorching flame, too horrified to even apologize, wanting to fall into the pavement and be swallowed up by the road. And Greg had tried to step forward and take his arm saying, “It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s ok,” like he was trying to wrangle a terrified animal, and John had finally whispered “I’m sorry,” and took off running down the street. He’d run the four miles back to his apartment, not bothering to stop for a cab, and the sound of Greg calling out his name echoing down the street had rung in his ears the whole way back.
Sherlock takes another step forward. “Gregory has no fault in this. Yes, he helped me get clean. He was there for me when I needed him. He helps shield me from the press. But he never lied to you. It wasn’t like that.”
John’s nose draws in a deep breath of body-warmed bed sheets and salt scented air as his eyes slowly blink open into the golden haze. It’s John’s favorite thing about this shitty, hole in the wall, one room apartment – the windows. Ever since Greg helped him enter his first surf competition and the prize money meant no more sleeping in the back of Uncle Ron’s old station wagon, John has blinked awake before dawn to a view through a thin, rattling window of the great vast blue, deep velvet glass cupping the earth in its wet palms and beckoning John out to its depths with the soft, rolling, even crush of the waves against the shore.
“Right you would, Watson,” Rick says and winks. “Ah, but it’s not just ‘a bit’ behind, is it? With the way the rest of the group performed in this first run, Holmes would need to ski his personal best to secure bronze, and ski two seconds
Sherlock turns and squats, holding his hands behind him to catch John. When John doesn’t immediately leap onto his back, Sherlock turns, squinting now against the flashlights’ ever-growing glare.
show up to be picked up by John Watson the next morning.
A naked, warm embarrassment starts creeping up John’s neck; the uninvited desire to glance over his shoulder, as if he’s just learned he’s never really been alone.
He jumps in surprise when his phone vibrates with a received text after it turns on. He shuts his eyes before looking down at it, expecting a text from Sherlock from the ski lift that Greg is an ignorant moron for holding him back from his ideal plans for the course, and that Sherlock knows what he’s doing, and that it’s a miracle Greg ever even set an Olympic Record without taking Sherlock-Holmes-approved angles on every gate.
The unspoken “
Even the memory of his emotions is revolting. He stomps across his room to the shower and takes his third one of the day, angrily swiping soap across his skin until it hurts. He recites the chemical makeup of his shampoo. He lists every IOC-approved ski design from the inception of the Olympics until now.
I realize with a warm clench through my body that he’s been laughing.
Cut to Sam: “Gerold said we are all a family together? Aw, how romantic!”
John rolls his eyes. “God how could I have forgotten after four days how fucking insane you are?”
“I was an idiot. I kept it in my notebook – this one I used for my notes I took reading other textbooks after school. Didn’t want my brother to find it because we shared a room. But then that notebook got taken from me – was only about two fucking weeks after I bought it. The wrong kid saw the photo and . . .Oahu’s a small island.”
Sherlock walks out into the living room, talking louder so that John can hear, voice crisp and businesslike. “I made two calls that day when we were eating lunch. First one was to the WSL and second one was to your hotel.”
John gasps in a breath and closes his eyes. Suddenly he knows, more than he’s ever known anything in his life, that he is in love with Sherlock Holmes.
Patrick prepares for a new incoming class of paramedic trainees.
Cloaked in flurries of snow, hemmed in by walls of foggy cold, Sherlock’s skin burns at the freezing touch of John’s hands. They rake up under his jacket and grab his ribs, caressing his sides. Sherlock groans at the shocks of cold, his spine trembling out of his control, as John presses him back with the full force of his body and licks into his mouth, crushing his lips, spilling warmth down Sherlock’s front until all Sherlock is aware of are John’s hands, John’s tongue, John’s thigh, John’s hot breath.
Thanks for returning. A quick note before you start:
“I haven’t forgotten.”
“Sherlock,” somebody whispers. John looks around shocked for the source of the voice, then realizes it had been him.
His blood stops.
“John, I . . . I lo—”
John marvels to himself how only Sherlock’s goggles somehow manage to look
the moment is over.
John shoves his surfboard down into the sand and drops his gear next to Greg’s before running his hands over his sweaty face. “Oh my god. Damn alarm clock battery died,” he sighs between his fingers.
It’s freezing. Literally.
He sees the familiar physics rise up in front of him like they’re written plain as day in the air. Equations and predictions and models all hovering over the face of the waters (
“You don’t realize this,” he says, “because you have an absolutely shit internal clock. But it’s nine-fifty right now, and Chris is coming at ten –”
“He’d be an awfully inept cop if he ended up being chased by the suspect when he’s the one with a gun,” he says back.
“Apparently not when you’re involved,” Sherlock says. His mouth is dry, heart thudding—is this how other skiers feel at the starting gate? Is this how he felt the first time he ever laid eyes on Greg? The second after he raced to the bottom of that mountain to see John on his monoski, smiling, even as he screamed at Sherlock that he could have died?
“Good morning, and welcome to your first official day of these 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games. With NBC-International, I’m Sonya Westley.”
-Another lazy research moment: I'm not sure what the CPR protocols were for that time. I used what made sense within the context of this fic, but apologies to all of the lovely medical professionals who probably read that and cringed. For anyone who doesn't know, don't follow Sherlock's technique!

Sherlock doesn’t move, pale eyes still fixed on the slowly setting sun. “Maybe not technically,” he says, tilting his head. “But we can get as close to it as we can.”
Holmes’ voice, after a pause: “They aren’t expecting a thank you, so none is needed. It would be unnecessary.”

what he wanted to tell his old Wing Commander—the man who lead him through the skies for more than a decade. The man who touched his fingertips. The man whose voice was the last voice John would ever hear.
Japan—imagine! A Holmes (because you are a Holmes, you know you’re a Holmes) going all the way clear across the world to Japan! I know you saw your granddaddy’s eyes grow big as saucers. Sometimes I think he forgets there’s a whole other world that exists outside Baker and Boston and his jungle dreams. Sometimes I do, too.
“We’ve got time for one more question here—can you tell us more about your decision to stand-ski? We understand an athlete stand-skiing using a lower limb prosthetic is actually unprecedented for this event at the Paralympic level.”
Don't fall into any crevasses before I post the next chapter <3
On the course, the Russian heaves himself around the turn, his single pole digging hard into the earth with every gasping stride. Greg’s stomach drops as he leaves Kuznetsov behind, desperately waiting for John to come into view. The fire in his knee screams at him to stop.
“Come on, sleeping beauty. Up.”
Greg stares at him, afraid to move for fear he’ll break the calm spell. His heart is beating harder than it used to on the mornings of his own race days, counting down the seconds until John has to be at the starting line. He focuses on the deep, midnight blue of John’s eyes so he doesn’t stand up and flip the table at the
“John.”
Sherlock’s body snaps in two. The breath leaves his lungs in a keening, desperate moan, and he lets John manhandle him away from the wall before John places his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock braces himself for impact, preparing for John to shove him down to the ground, but John hesitates for a second, then pulls up Sherlock’s face by the chin for an achingly soft kiss.
Watson: “Was that Greg piloting? To head to the pass?”
him if he died falling from a fire escape now), Sherlock adjusts himself until he’s secure within the railings, then cups his palms to peer in the window.
And now Sherlock just scolds him for taking too long to break into his room, and he doesn’t even get up to hug John, or look at him with huge, mournful eyes, and the sight of a sprawled-out Sherlock just staring down at his iPad is suddenly the most wonderful thing John’s witnessed since arriving at the Olympics (aside from the look on Greg’s face from the middle of that swarming crowd).
The silence stretches on again, softened by the blanket of the waves. John tries to imagine now would it would actually be like to kiss Greg Lestrade and can’t. Every time he closes his eyes he sees Sherlock’s lips, Sherlock’s face, Sherlock’s hair.
He’s just about to make up a quick excuse to leave to get the two boys out of more awkward fumbling when a third athlete sprints up, wrapping his arms immediately around Connor and Asher’s shoulders with a great huff.
And then it hits him, a shocking punch of cold emotion straight through his stomach:
“In my hands are the symbols of your love that you each will wear over your hearts, chosen by each other as the deepest symbol of your entity as sky or sea.” He reaches in and draws out the dog tags John had placed in there this morning, freshly engraved with Sherlock’s name across the back. Chris hands it to Sherlock, who reaches up with a shaking hand, and looks at John with a crumbling look on his face.
, John’s already growing thick and hard.
And then your granddaddy, your beautiful, immensely brave granddaddy, he cut off the sputtering answer I was trying to give, and he held your hand, and he told you that I didn’t need no wife. That I had him.
The sight of it makes Greg sick to his stomach—watching his brave, warm, uncontainable John act like nothing more than a machine putting fuel into his body. Not just neat and tidy, the way he knows John can be, but . . . contained. Tamped down.
“Banzai waves too small for you now, huh?”
“I told you, Matt. He manipulates people for whatever he wants. And what he wants is to stay here and make us all miserable. It’s like a game to him – Dispatching left and right, watching us all pick up the pieces.”
She gives him an odd half-smile, almost indulgent—an inside joke. “Yes, but of course, you’re the
Sherlock’s heart drops back down into his stomach. Beside him, John flinches. A paparazzi-style photo of John, Sherlock, and Greg all seated together in the dining hall pops up on the screen, huge and blaring like evidence of a crime, their three heads bent together over their plates of food, all laughing.
Voice: “Viva Echo Sierra One Nine?”
Suddenly, without warning, the scene cuts to Greg still leaning against the chopper. He is nearly finished giving his interview from before, and stares now looking out at the mountain, remembering the rescue.
He lets out a terrible, choked curse. The guilt that he hadn’t even
It almost looks too intimate to be seen, too much . . .
“The pier will be fine,” I interrupt. I wince at myself. I don’t know who this person is – whose heart races at the thought of a Visit and who interrupts kind nurses and resents them for their smooth, thin hands. I swallow hard and force myself to breathe. Slow and calm. The same way my tired body moves through the World.
We cut back to the mission helicopter, with Greg in the pilot’s seat. Watson is beside him as co-pilot, commenting on the terrain and where they could land while he bends over to look out the window. Greg flashes him a quick nod. They are all business as the helicopter tilts to make a sharp turn, avoiding the cable wires of the ski lift.
John slaps his arm and tries not to laugh. “You don’t ever fucking stop, do you? You’d think by now, after . . . everything, you’d stop being an asshole with me at least.”
Far below us, a pained wail.
“And what do you want?” Sherlock interrupts. “Besides just lounging around on a beach all day with chicks lining up to wish you good luck, huh?”
, he is lucky. He thinks of his life in one great swoop, images from all over the world flashing before his eyes in a blaze, and it all culminates in this, in a quiet slope of French snow, two men beside him, their cheeks turning pink.
Just before Watson moves to pull him away from the edge, without opening his eyes, Holmes licks his lips and tilts his head to call weakly down into the pit.
But he wasn’t shocked. His eyes fluttered open, deep, bursting plains of royal blue, the way the sky sinks across Wyoming and dips behind the peaks to hide from the moon.
“We’re not even surfing, for God’s sake,” he cuts in.

“It only happened yesterday!”
But just ‘cus we don’t talk about it doesn’t mean I ain’t walkin’ round our new ranch just waiting for the moment he’s gonna open his eyes, look around him at what he’s lost and decide it all isn’t worth shit.
for it. God forbid the three of us should get to actually experience this together, as a team, as a . . . as a family. God forbid they don’t try and give ‘all of us’ a chance to experience it the way you can, because—”
Greg’s voice, firmly: “I am going back for everyone else at the base. We’ll bring every shovel and pulley. You all work on locating.”
A hot cord of fear seems to constrict John’s throat. For some ungodly reason, as Sherlock whips around the third gate, so quick the cameras barely track him, John has the distinct thought that maybe it
An exploding crack pierces the air, echoing across the sea. “Six . . .”
Then, Greg, off-screen in French: “Surprisingly, these are the times when it is the hardest to wait back in the helicopter.”
Sonya sparkles. “Let’s remind our viewers at home how Greg Lestrade has forever changed the sport of Super-G Alpine Skiing.”
It’s amazing to watch him work like this, pacing the flat slow and steady with one hand pressing a cell phone to his ear and the other idly tracing circles around his belly which looks ready to burst. Sometimes our eyes meet, his mind wrenched briefly from the depths of his mind palace, and we share a secret smile. I know what we’re both thinking – that it feels like old times. Because I’m sure my face looks just like it did on that very first night standing over the poor journalist from A Study in Pink, and he knows that he looks even more radiant, even more like the sun than he did that day.
A thought pops into Sherlock’s head so suddenly, so forcefully, he’s amazed he hadn’t planned it out before. It’s dark and twisted, sending shivers across his skin. It’s beautiful.
“You know me,” he responds lamely. “Just – haven’t processed it all I guess.”
Watson, suddenly, coming back into frame: “I didn’t realize either, love. Not until all this filming business. Wasn’t just you.”
“Well, do what I pay you to do and be my coach for once. It’s clear I’ve let you slack off for far too long. Should I do it? Do you . . . do you want me to do it?”
“So this is it,” Sherlock thinks to himself. “This is how I’m going to die.”
“Well that’s shorter than an entire ocean!”
Interviewer, chuckling: “That’s a lot of collective time spent up in helicopters, isn’t it?”
Sherlock nods.
. I want you to take five fucking seconds and think of how I may be perceiving things. ‘Body’s just transport’ my arse. And you made Greg watch it, too. He had to . . . he
Sherlock hums, warm tingles dripping down his neck and back at the feeling of John’s fingers running slowly through his hair. He feels hotly embarrassed now about his sleepless nights standing alone by the waves, not knowing that John was at that very moment finding his way back to him for good.
Sherlock chuckles, and the sound of it is so tingling and warm across John’s skin, so
“Got everything I ever wanted,” he says. “You in my life, our land, this place, meetin’ your girls. . . Standin’ here with you like this.” He rubs his palm up my spine, then shifts to lean more against me in my arms. “But I -- I hate this world, John. I hate that I . . .” He swallows hard, and the back of my neck prickles at what he’s about to say.
John gives a sharp laugh. “Oh, yeah, God forbid we do anything simple around here. And in case you haven’t noticed in the middle of all your quality time spent surrounded by gates and snow and no other human beings, there are actually
He wants to say yes. He wants to cup Sherlock’s face in his hands and say,
“He doesn’t have friends –”
Scotty smiles, a real, soulful smile lighting up the corners of his face, turning his eyes into little pieces of glittering sky. John wants to cup his cheeks in his palms and gaze at it forever. It’s a strange feeling – to feel like he’s flying while also being so rooted into the earth that even a hurricane couldn’t rip him from his base. It’s something . . . unprecedented.
John stands in the middle of the darkened bedroom and looks down at Sherlock sleeping on his stomach like the dead, sheets tangled around his waist and curls plastered to one side of his head.

My sincere thanks to all of you angels who offered your language and translation services! We are so lucky in this fandom to have a community that stretches all over the world :) If I decide to come back in the future and create all the translations, instead of doing what I've been doing, I know I would be in good hands! Thank you again.
I sit there thinking how can he be so damn smart and also so clueless. It’s everybody’s business, this thing right here. It’s a curse that’ll kill us dead if we ever see each other somewhere other than this goddamn mountain. Then I realize that that won’t even be a problem, seein’ as how he’ll go his way and I’ll go mine once the summer’s done and the sheep are all back down from the sloping sides of Baker. The thought makes me wanna hit something hard. I leave Scott with a grunt and pull myself back up on my horse. I can feel his pale eyes watching me as I swing my legs over the saddle. When I get back to camp I chop up enough firewood that we could be up there for a whole winter too and probably never run outta wood.
John laughs. “So that’s what you did while I was asleep? Sat there and contemplated the insurmountable hardships of your life?”
I feel frantic. “But yours isn’t?”
le bossu de notre dame : the hunchback of Notre Dame
“Hello?”
Remember this, John Watson, always remember this: the sounds that Sherlock made, small and crumpled on the floor, as the fifth test fell from his fingers and clacked on the hardwood floor. I’ve waited until evening to continue on here, while Sherlock is off poking his fingers into God-knows-what at Bart’s for a bit. I don’t trust myself not to show the anguish on my face as I write it, and he would have ratted me out in an instant.
I burned with the overwhelming power of those words. Like he was spoiling me by drowning me in a river where I could still breathe.
He’s looking up at me now from the floor, and he has that look in his eye that means he’s about to suggest we either leave the girls with Mrs. Hudson so we can go out and solve a fun little case, or leave the girls with Mrs. Hudson so that we can lock the door to his bedroom and get to know one another’s bodies again, soft and gentle, awestruck and whole.
And Sherlock is just beginning  to realize how rapidly his heart is beating, thudding in his chest. That there’s the smallest stirring of heat pulsing deep in his belly, curling his toes against the cool bathroom tile, when suddenly:
Holmes’ voice: “Zermatt is a boring, lifeless, ridiculous little town, filled with nothing but photographers and tourists and children screaming that they’re too cold. There aren’t even normal
that I wanted to experience it with you?” Greg pulls away from Sherlock, fresh anger prickling under his skin. “It is my fault that I wanted to be back up there at the top with everyone else, not just waiting down at the bottom all alone, without any of the—”
Sherlock sees Greg.
“That’s unbelievable,” he says tightly.
Thank you so much for reading! It means the world to me. Your kind words, kudos, and comments are like little puffs of cool breeze as I suffer through this summer heat wave.
Holmes: “John, really, I’m fine. Please. I’m okay, I’m fine –"

. You like it, too.”
angle he wants to take on the fifth gate, and he needs to make sure the gear team cleans and preps Sherlock’s skis properly, without any errors, and that his uniform and bib number are all in order and sorted, and that they know exactly where to be tomorrow and when, and that Sherlock actually eats something, and he really needs to tighten up that ninth gate or he’ll never even make the top three tomorrow, and Sherlock only needs to make top ten but Greg can’t handle the outburst that would ensue if he got anything less than second, and the weather looks threatening, snarling clouds looming low across the sky, and—
“Well it’s true! Fucker knows what happens around here.”
“Listen to me,” Sherlock says, holding his gaze even as the production team starts frantically waving them towards the stage over his shoulder. “You have done literally dozens of these interviews before. You spoke with the NBC-International people the day we arrived—”
“I – I’m sorry if . . . that wasn’t . . .”
John lets out a breath. “I barely fucking understand it myself half the time, if I’m being honest.”
Holmes, with a frown in his slow voice: “Of which country? How the fuck should I know?”
Watson, running a hand through his hair, voice thick with emotion: “I mean, I mean you
John barely catches those last words as Sherlock stomps off without them, his wool coat flying dramatically in the wind, looking almost hilariously incongruous in a sea of puffy vests and waterproof jackets. The billowing tail of the coat whacks two other unsuspecting athletes in the face when Sherlock barges past a small bench.
He stops, just once, before he reaches the gate leading away to the road, and looks back over his shoulder.
third place finish in these Para-biathlon time trials!”
And on the day after his fifteenth birthday he planted his new board proudly in the sand on the empty local beach right at sunrise. He ran down to the shore just to give himself a first fresh dip in the virgin waves, and when he walked back up to his precious board he nearly fell to his knees in the sand when he saw someone had spray painted “faggot” across the face of it.
“Yep.”
win if he keeps thinking ridiculous things like that—the RAF taught him that much at least.
“Oh great, I’m glad that line’s been recorded in the official flight log. As well as overheard by air traffic control,” John says.
Scotty stands awkwardly in one corner, watching John look around, and shrugs. “I built it.”
Sherlock looks handsome in the sunlight, glowin’ just like he was that first time I ever saw him leanin’ against his truck in the gravel parkin’ lot. I look at his little pulse flicker along the side of his smooth neck. He looks at the front door and nods.

John huffs out a laugh. “Two weeks – not even that, two fucking days. I stayed with him in Oahu. We hadn’t . . . we hadn’t, before then.”
They always make him think about a ripped off leg spurting blood into the black sand. The famous photo accompanying that news article of the sunrise over the dunes from the rescue helicopter cockpit, looking down at the still-smoking wreckage of an RAF helicopter with a little black speck beside it in the sand—the speck named Group Captain John H. Watson, barely alive and holding on to what they all at first thought was just another piece of wreckage. A fuel pipe or an engine blade. Certainly not a
“Shut up,” he says. His voice is a rumble. I can barely hear it over the chorus of hooves.
“Don’t Holmes me over breakfast. And it has nothing to do with me liking or not liking silence. What I don’t like is watching you be incompetent using a
Your granddaddy is the most beloved person in the whole world. He stands alone on the highest mountain peak as every breath I take, every choice I make, every sound from my lips, they all travel to the farthest reaches of these here mountains to cover his skin. To follow him. To protect him. To adore him. To keep him close.
We stand there for a long time, watchin’ the horses slowly roam through the tall grass, bending their long, steaming necks through the mist, and the early sun shining in their coats. Baker appears, slow, like it’s takin’ its sweet time to start the day. It rises through the fog, pressin’ up into the clouds and brilliant green. Haloed with gleaming white which pours its light down on through the rocky pass.
And Sherlock’s still looking up at him with an apology on his face, and John can feel that Sherlock is still completely soft where he’s pressed into John’s hip, and John kisses right next to Sherlock’s worried eye with a quiet hum.
John curses at him when he finally does fling himself across them onto the mattress, whirling up the sheets into a perfect cocoon around his body. And Greg kicks him so hard in the shin he wonders if he’ll have a beautiful bruise there in the morning to help him remember this night. To remember this moment when everyone knew almost everything and they still asked him to come on, to come to bed, please.
The bartender nods. “Stop looking for him,” he says seriously. Then, “come on, have a drink and stay. What’ve you got, an hour left?”
Without waiting for John to answer Scotty ducks back into the hut for a moment and emerges with a backpack and a thermos which John barely catches after he tosses it to him. He feels like he’s back in the whirlwind, back to being the breathless disciple chasing after the sunlit storm. He keeps waiting for himself to feel annoyed, to feel goaded and patronized by the apparent goddamn tour guide leading the way in front of him. But instead his excitement and curiosity only grow, drawing him forward with each step as he follows Scotty back down the road and through the trees up to the whitewashed house. He follows him in silence, breathless to try and keep pace. Scotty’s walking the way he did that day on the dockyard – the way John watched him walk up to the starting line in Hermosa a lifetime ago. Legs long and confident, back swift and straight.
Alright, let's be real, this chapter and the next one are *very altered* from how a normal Paralympic Biathlon competition would work. BUT the key elements remain the same in that the athletes do not all compete together at the same time, but rather in different rounds for each Class: sitting, standing, and visually impaired. Each Class has its own unique course length and shooting adaptations, as well as different equipment allowed.
Greg finishes chewing and nods. “
John’s heart is in his throat when he realizes the surfers around him are cheering.
“I Dispatched him,” the stranger says, getting calmly to his feet. He brushes off the dust from his pristine black trousers. “He’ll awaken in the World with an alarm on his Device. Whatever nurse is looking after him will know how to take it from there. He won’t be allowed back to Visit. Or Stay.”
He turns to leave before Scotty can respond, hating the fact that every fiber of his being wants to stay. He’s half a dozen steps away when he hears his name called out sharply into the peaceful quiet.
Walter shakes his hand with a firm grip, growing solemn.
John angles to the right on the straightaway, his arms pinwheeling his poles into the snow over and over again in a terrifyingly fast rhythm, almost like an animal, and Kuznetsov is falling apart, like a machine with the parts crumbling out of place. John’s five metres behind him now, and Greg can hear his grunts echoed back to him across the ice.
Greg just stares at his face.
His eyes track outside the window, and we also watch Robbie, Patrick, then Watson jog towards the freshly washed helicopter. Watson’s helmet glints brightly in the flare from the sun and snow.
pas trop mal : not too bad
The photoshoot had been awkward at first, even for Greg, who was more than used to such a scene. While Sasha had taken a few simple shots of them in their flat after the interview, Greg hadn’t been surprised when the editor contacted them to request an official photoshoot in the studio a few weeks later.
John would know the clean lines of that skier anywhere. Would know them in his dreams, with his eyes closed, in the middle of a storm.
It strengthened, it grew and grew and grew, until I suddenly couldn’t imagine that I’d never woken up like this before, not where his words dripped down my bare skin like sweet honey, and he showered me with praises, kissed under my arms, across my chest. Kissed the dip just under my chin. The bones of my hips.
But Greg, though. Greg deserves a special paragraph. We met up at a pub – I hesitated over that choice for days. . . I knew the man well enough to know he wouldn’t cause some sort of scene, but still, it felt like such an impersonal place to have to suddenly split myself open and reveal my internal organs, the beating of my heart and soul, the warmth inside my skin. On the other hand, though, I needed him at his most relaxed.
It takes no time at all for John to get dressed and geared up for the outdoors. Sherlock silently praises John’s undying, military-grade organizational habits as the roommate tosses and turns on the other bed, threatening to wake up at any moment. It isn’t until John is walking toward the door and reaching for the handle when he turns back and frowns in Sherlock’s direction.
“Me too.”
It’s yet another one of the things Sherlock would probably open his mouth and say if he ever allowed himself to join them for couch chats and whiskey.
Watson half-grins and flashes her a look of appreciation, then scratches at the long stubble across his jaw.
The feeling of John’s hands on his bare skin, just five minutes away from a beach full of people, sends a fiery thrill through Sherlock’s core. He feels John’s thick and hot desire suddenly pressed into the dip of his hip, thinks of the way John’s thighs had bulged as he clung to his board and soared across the face of the wave, and in a rush of pure desire Sherlock reaches down for the underside of those thighs and lifts John up against the wall, thrilling as John wraps his legs around his waist without hesitation and grinds Sherlock’s body into himself.
Sherlock closes his eyes for a beat then pushes his sunglasses up off his eyes to perch in his hair. He needs to see John Watson fully. Needs to see the true color of his skin contrasted with the waves, and track the black speck of his wetsuit bobbing through the swells, and see the flash of golden light in his hair.
