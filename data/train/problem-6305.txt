This chapter is in Steve’s POV.  Please remember he is suffering from untreated PTSD here, which this chapter attempts to portray.  Please be safe 💖
Closing his eyes, Tony felt Steve's lips press against the top of his head, whispering a soft, "It's okay, sweetheart. I've got you."
“Yeah.  Or even nothing, as it were,” Dad said with a smirk.  “Actually, come to think of it, I’m pretty sure I prefer the nothing.”
"Yeah, I'd like that," said Peter. He swiped at his nose, attempting a smile. "When are you leaving?"
“You're not gonna believe who I met today, Ashes,” Steve murmured as he squinted against the last of the evening sunbeams reflecting off the tower.  Ashes glanced up at him, her nose twitching as she responded with a rather bored-sounding
Tony watched as Steve's gorgeous blue eyes scanned the room. "I don't see why it wouldn't be," he murmured. "But if you're not comfortable here we can talk outside."
As soon as he heard his dads' footsteps disappear down the hallway, Peter grabbed for his phone, typing out a quick text to Gwen that they had said yes to the dance and that he would talk to her more about it tomorrow. He smiled when he got a response barely three seconds later; she'd apparently been waiting to hear from him.
Unfortunately, clicking on the Project Rebirth title under Howard Stark's name only got him back to the same information that he'd already read, causing Steve to grit his teeth in frustration.
"Um…" Peter stammered as he stood back up, handing the laptop to Gwen. "You almost dropped your computer."
"Pete, we've already moved the sceptre," Tony said quietly, once he was able to find his voice again. "That's the reason why we didn't come home right away, okay? It's not at the Compound anymore."
"That's 'cause that's exactly what he's doing," Bruce cut in. He looked up at Tony, who nodded in apparent agreement. "It's like his skin is losing its cohesion, and his cell membranes are just… dissolving."
"Yeah, okay, but no matter what Steve's reasons are, it still doesn't give us the right to go against his wishes," Uncle James said. "Now, I can see what he says the next time we talk to him, but we're trying to keep the conversations to a minimum to preserve his oxygen, so I'm not exactly sure when that's gonna be."
"While I was unable to identify who accessed the server, I did discover that the person or entity that did so was located in New York City."
Tony let out a frustrated growl. "I said, we need to fix your ship so we can get off this goddamn rock."
Peter wasn't quite sure what he'd been expecting Thanos to look like, but he did know that this wasn't quite it. For one thing, he was purple, completely bald, with his chin covered in deep horizontal creases and his cheeks criss-crossed with either scars or age lines, Peter couldn't quite tell which. He was dressed in a metal and leather chestplate and boots that reminded Peter of the armour worn by horsemen during medieval times.
—preparing a lecture on basic flight aerodynamics for Colonel Rhodes' new cadet class that was beginning in two weeks.
"Well, how fatherly of you," said Dr Strange. "But have you figured out how to turn the ship around yet?"
"No!" Tony shouted as he attempted to crawl over Steve's legs. Steve always slept closest to the door, yet another habit left over from his days in the Army. "No, he's not! He's—he's—oh God, he's—!" He grunted, jamming his knee hard into Steve's thigh when he refused to get the hell out of the way. "Goddamnit, Steve, move! I need—"
Which he was.  The evidence of which was now sitting in about a thousand ripped-up pieces scattered across Tony’s desk.
"You!" Tony finally choked out, bumping into the bed and nearly falling backwards. He sucked in a deep, shaky breath as he righted himself, his heart threatening to pound right out of his chest. "What in the goddamn
But that was a conversation for another time.  On this night, Steve had far more important things to take care of.
"Tony?" Steve said as he looked behind him into the ship, obviously searching for Peter. Tony could tell the precise second when it dawned on him, when his eyes changed from pure elation to fear, and tentativeness.
"No, hon, I know that," Tony murmured. "No one is. But as far as perfection goes, I'd say you're a lot closer to it than the rest of us."
After making himself and Peter some quick scrambled eggs and toast, Steve poured a large mug of steaming hot water over one of his regular herbal tea bags, stirring in a teaspoon of honey.
"All right," Steve said after a short pause. "Is there any way JARVIS can find out who accessed this information?"
"As am I, Captain," said Thor. "I have already left Loki and Valkyrie alone for far longer than I am comfortable."
Steve cuts her off with a raised hand.  “Nat, please.  I know you’re trying, but… I’m just not ready.”
"Oh no!" Peter yelped as the panel began to close behind him. "Um, I don't think I have a choice anymore."
"Well, that's just great," muttered Sam. "So we just gotta cover this entire field until these things somehow run out?"
"Yeah, we both are," added Bucky, biting into a pastry. "Seems like we've been gone a lot longer than just a few days."
"No!" Tony yelped, squeezing Steve's hand when he flinched. "No, honey, just…" He couldn't risk Steve asking too many questions when Project Phoenix was so close to being implemented. "Not yet, okay? Let's make sure that the trial missions go okay first and then see if Phillips still wants to green light the whole thing. There's a lot of steps that kinda need to go in order here."
"I'm ready!" Bucky said, his eyes wide behind the glasses and his fists tightly clenched. "Start now!"
Tony thought as he pinched the bridge of his nose.  He didn't really want to think about the five-alarm tantrum Obie would throw if he were to show up at the office empty-handed.  According to Obie, the military leadership was “chomping at the bit” to hear all about the new Jericho missile that was “going to change modern warfare as we know it”, or whatever such bullshit line Obie had fed them.
"It's gonna be okay, Peter," Papa whispered a few seconds later, his fingertips massaging Peter's scalp. "I'll make sure of it."
"Okay, how 'bout, the one where they blast a hole in the side of the ship and the huge, mean alien thingy gets blown out into space?" Peter said. "Sound familiar?"
Emotionally, though, Steve wasn't there quite yet, and he had a feeling it was going to be a long, long time before he was.
Without another word, Tony turned on his heel and practically sprinted down the hall to his office, sucking in a deep breath as soon as the door was closed.
"Hotter 'n hell with the humidity to match?" Bucky retorted as he tossed a grape at Sam's face. "And the answer is, no one. 'Cause I don't need any."
"I wish I knew what was best, little guy," Papa said. "I wish I knew if it was safer for you and Dad to stay here with me or if it was better to send you away, but I don't. I wish I knew exactly who outside of our family we can trust, but I don't. Right now the only thing that I do know, is the very thing that I've been most afraid of ever since that battle in the Miami bunker is now spelled out right here in black and white, which means that my contingency plans have to start taking shape a lot sooner than I originally thought, and—"
Tony stood next to his workstation as Barnes—Bucky—and Peter entered the lab, his hands clenched into tight fists at his sides as he attempted to take deep breaths. Conversations with the Department of Damage Control were never what he would call enjoyable, as trying to accomplish anything government-related had always been a royal pain in the ass, but the last several discussions had been particularly frustrating. Apparently someone, or more likely a group of someones, had decided that the convoys transporting artefacts from the Triskelion wreckage sites in Washington D.C. were the perfect targets for robbery attempts. So far the perpetrators hadn't been able to make off with anything of importance thanks to the newly upgraded Iron Legion, but as usual, trying to thwart future attempts had fallen squarely on Tony's shoulders.
I’d love to hear any and all theories on what Steve’s thinking at the end here 😉 😎 Don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! ♥️
"Mmm, fine." Peter burrowed closer, closing his eyes as he absorbed the warmth that Papa radiated like a heater. "But can I ask you just one more thing first? It doesn't have anything to do with the bug dude."
“Yeah.”  Tony ran his palm down his face, scratching at an itchy spot under his jaw.  “I’ve… ah… I’ve got kind of a different assignment for you.”
“Two weeks?” Obie said, nearly choking on his Scotch.  “Oh, c’mon, Tony!  You can’t do it any faster than that?  They might forget about the whole damn thing by then!”
Peter watched as Cindy winced, then shuffled over to the podium, looking sheepishly at Liz for her topic.
"Your new suit's in the closet, honey," Tony murmured as Steve pulled on a clean pair of underwear. "And I can't wait to see it on you."
"Whoa!" he exclaimed, crab-walking backwards as the woman's eyes went wide and the tips of her antennae began to glow. "No, no, no! Please don't put your eggs in me!" He quickly shot his webs at her, immobilising her just as he was kicked off to the side, the sound of Dad's repulsors firing filling his ears.
"Well, it's a good thing you haven't completely lost yourself," Steve said once Tony had settled back against his pillows. He picked up the mug of tea, holding it up to Tony's mouth. "Careful, okay? It's pretty hot."
"Thank you, Helen," Tony said, breathing out a sigh of relief. The last thing he wanted was to have to argue with his stubborn-as-hell husband over the best way to treat his multiple injuries.
"He actually did make off with one of the rolls," said Wanda, pointing to the large baking sheet next to the pies. "But at least he asked me if he could have it first."
"You're sure I look okay though?" Steve asked. He'd chosen his favourite blue t-shirt and a pair of soft, well-worn jeans since they were going to be outside on the grass, but he was already second-guessing himself. Or more like tenth-guessing, if he was honest.
“Then what’s the problem?” Peter cried as a single fat tear snaked its way down his round cheek.  “Daddy, we can’t just leave him there all alone!  Please!  We just can’t do it!”
"Oh, whatever," Tony muttered as he grabbed his coffee cup and tablet and headed towards the kitchen, nearly running headlong into Peter, who was busy shoving Doritos into his mouth and reading from a piece of paper as he walked.
A wide grin slowly spread across Peter's face. Grandma was now the second person to tell him that he was similar to Papa, and he absolutely loved it.
Scott shook his head as he stuffed the rest of the sandwich half into his mouth. "I'm pretty sure it was somewhere in the middle of Kansas. Or maybe it was Nebraska? I can't be sure, you know those flat states in the middle there all kinda look the same. I was trying to just drive straight through, but then I got to the point where I started smelling colours, so I thought it'd be best to pull over for a bit."
In a flash Tony's expression morphed from teasing to absolute seriousness as curled his arms around Steve's waist, dropping his forehead against his collarbone. "God, Steve, I could never wonder about it," he whispered. "Not in a million years."
And losing his son, and having to watch as his husband slowly faded into complete catatonic madness definitely qualified as getting knocked down, didn't it?
“Yeah, honey, okay,” Tony said, his hands sliding up to hook over Steve’s shoulders.  He rolled onto his back, hiking his legs up around Steve’s waist as Steve settled on top of him, their hard cocks sliding against each other through the soft fabric of their sleep pants.
"All right, all right, all right," Tony said before the kid's voice managed to shatter every single piece of glass in his office. "I'll… I'll talk to Steve sometime this evening, okay?"
"Yeah," Bucky said, shrugging. "I mean, you even know that I was over an hour late to meet him 'cause I got the spot wrong, and well… not everyone would've been as understanding about it as he was, so… And then, he’s just so…
Peter smiled tiredly. Papa's stovetop hot cocoa was practically legendary in the Tower, and something that he never turned down.
"Whew!" Peter said a few seconds later as he slowly lowered himself from the ceiling. "That was close!"
Hammer just rolled his eyes, jerking his head towards Wanda. "This is getting pretty boring, don't you think? So do you mind giving him a zap so we can get started, my dear?"
A second later the kitchen's view screen lit up with an image from the security camera guarding the Compound's gated driveway entrance. Steve squinted as he struggled to identify the ugly brown striped van in the image, and the man standing in front of it, frantically waving his arms.
"No, Grandpa, I didn't," Peter answered with a sigh. He glanced up at the clock, noting that it was already 1500 hours. The last thing Peter wanted was for Dad to drop by and see his grandfather sitting in his room. "You might want to start heading back soon though. Don't wanna get caught out after curfew."
"And you are absolutely sure, Mr Stark, that now that this Adrian Toomes has been apprehended that the convoys are safe to proceed?" asked Senator Davis, his syrupy tone with just enough of an edge of condescension to be obvious causing Tony's fists to clench at his sides. "Because I don't believe it would be in anyone's best interests to have yet another attack take place."
Tony muttered under his breath, thankfully far enough away from his microphone that it wasn't picked up. Steve's cheeks were a bright pink, his full lips pursed tightly in anger.
"Yeah, yeah," Phillips interrupted. "Look, I'll cut right to the chase. Why the hell were you looking up information on Howard Stark?"
"He's fine," Steve answered, just as casually. "Sam stopped by here before his run and told me Peter was still sound asleep. Oh, and he also says he's glad you're feeling better, by the way."
Peter shrugged as he tore the pages from his notebook, handing them to Dad. "So, how's Steve doing?"
"Thanks, Colonel," Anthony said as soon as Phillips stepped back. He handed his stack of papers to Carol to pass down, awkwardly pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose as his eyes flicked over to Steve. "I've prepared some final notes on the operations of the X-302, just a few more things that I thought might be of some interest. Nothing in there will affect any of your patrol this morning, but—"
Tony dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head.  “I can't tell you that either, bud.  Not yet.  Not till I get some stuff figured out first.”
For his part, Steve told him a few stories of his childhood as well, leaving out the fact that he'd spent most of it battling the sick lungs that he'd feared would kill him before he was twenty. Project Rebirth was one of the most closely guarded secrets in the Air Corps, and Steve wasn't sure where Tony's security clearance fell or if his father had ever mentioned it to him.
Steve made sure to have his Air Corps ID badge prominently displayed on the front of his jacket as he and Tony headed out to the parking lot, his heart the lightest it had felt in a long time. Peter's sweet face had lit up so brightly the moment he'd set eyes on the two of them that it had been impossible not to feel giddy himself.
"Yes, that's definitely something we should start looking into," said Steve. "But first we need to find out where the other stones are."
"The dance!" Peter exclaimed, quickly smashing his face into his polar bear. The dance would be the perfect opportunity since none of his family members would be there and wouldn't be expecting him home for a few hours. It would mean skipping out on Gwen, and Peter felt a sharp pang of guilt at the thought of disappointing her again, but… hopefully she would be able to forgive him once she understood what he was doing.
"Um, excuse me, Mr Wizard, but where the hell do you think you're going?" Tony demanded as he took off after him.
Grandma smiled as she set the tray aside. "And I highly doubt that it's a lot of fun for you to be sitting here, hooked up to all that stuff, hmm?"
"Wow," Ned said once their teacher was out of earshot. "He really didn't know any of that stuff about fabric softener?"
"Ahh," he said, gasping as another freezing shiver raced down his spine. "It's—it's not a comet, Gwen. I'm afraid it's—it's—"
"Like this afternoon, after practise?" Peter asked with a rather sly grin. "I doubt she was just hanging around at the school just 'cause she felt like it."
Tony could almost feel Steve’s blush through the phone, and his grin grew even wider as he pictured that goofy
"That's fine, little guy," Steve finally said. He pulled back, planting a kiss on Peter's forehead. "And we'll figure out a time to talk every night too, okay? Even if it's just for a few minutes."
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Dr Cho finished her exam, turning to Steve and Tony with a wary look on her face that sent Steve's heart into his throat.
Peppermint-laced cake aside, Mrs Stacy was an excellent cook, and her fried chicken and seasoned mashed potatoes were almost as good as Uncle Sam's. Between passing the salt shaker back and forth and dodging flying splashes of milk from the boys, Peter ate his fill, so that by the time Dad texted to tell him that he and Papa were on their way, he was feeling much better.
"Cap's right, Ro," said Clint. "You two are Avengers, yes, but your battle experience is still pretty limited." He clapped a reassuring hand on his surrogate son's shoulder. "And personally, I'll feel a lot better having you guys as backup."
"Okay, so she's probably not one of them," Steve murmured as he wrote down the lady's name and what state she represented in his notebook. He had already been watching the debate for over three hours, pretty much ever since he and Tony had dropped Peter off at school, taking detailed notes as he tried to determine exactly how many of the senators were hooked in with HYDRA and who they all were.
"Uhh… one of the guys that I've been working with the last few weeks. He's—he's one of the X-302 pilots."
At least since it was a desert there weren't any bodies of water that he had to worry about, so hopefully little to no chance of being swallowed up by ice again. Ever since the incident at the lake Steve hadn't been able to bring himself to be immersed in water, something he knew hadn't escaped Tony and Peter's notice. Tony because he and Steve had taken to enjoying the occasional bath together over the summer at the Compound before that fateful afternoon, and Peter, well, mainly because he was so observant and perceptive that one could almost say he was empathic.
Steve’s cheeks flush pink against his will, his jaw clenching so tightly that his back teeth scrape together.
Tony tilted his head as he studied the drone hologram in front of him, making a few final adjustments to the targeting system. He had been able to almost double the firing range on the various units stationed around the Tower, to the point where they could now reach Peter's school if necessary. This unfortunately came with the unpleasant side effect of revealing their existence in order to fire, but at the moment Tony couldn't see a way around it.
"Well, good." Then he tipped his head back against the wall and closed his eyes, and less than three minutes later he was snoring.
Biting his lip, Tony trailed his fingers down Peter's round cheek, smiling at the adorably crooked grin on his little face as he mugged for the camera. How innocent he had been back then, how blissfully ignorant of everything that was so unbelievably fucked-up in the world, as it should've been for such a tiny kid.
And Dad was even sound asleep, something that both shocked Peter and didn't at the same time. Dad had told him multiple times growing up that the only way he'd been able to sleep as a baby was if Dad held him against his chest, with his ear over his heart. There was just something about the rhythmic beat of Dad's heart that always managed to soothe Peter no matter how upset he was, and since Papa had come along, Peter had lost count of how many times Papa had been able to get Dad to relax in the same way when he was super stressed out.
Because he couldn't stop yet. From what he could tell, there were at least three of his fingers that were still intact, so he had no choice but to keep going.
Steve grinned as he watched Bucky open his mouth to respond, then snap it closed again a second later, probably trying to figure out if Sam was yanking his chain again, as he called it.
And then he was shot again during the whole Project Insight mess, which led to Bucky coming to stay at the Tower while the team worked on trying to deprogram him, a process that Steve was convinced would not have been successful without Peter's calming influence.
Pulling his ancient car into the driveway, Tony cut the engine and tipped his head back, curling his fingers around the steering wheel. He only had about thirty minutes to get cleaned up and get back to the base before curfew, which while normally would've been plenty of time, the fact that he hadn't been to the house in almost two weeks had him dreading what it was going to look like once he got inside.
And yet, ever since he and Maria had brought Tony home two weeks after the attack, the boy had been absolutely terrified of the dark. It had gotten to the point where he was now refusing to sleep—to even close his eyes—unless there was a light on, and as he was still trying to recover from his complicated, nearly eight-hour surgery, he needed all the rest that he could get.
"No, Peter's definitely not a dummy, but I'm telling you that this is coming directly from Steve himself," said Uncle James. "He told both Tony and myself that he absolutely does not want Peter to know what's going on until we have no other choice."
"I don't think I'd call it luck, sweetheart," Steve murmured. "I think it's something more than that. Something like soulmates, or fate, or another one of those things that people talk about in movies and books all the time. You and I were meant to be together. I believe that with every part of me, because if we weren't, all of the challenges that we've faced up until now, there's no way we would've survived them. Any one of those challenges could've killed one or both of us, but they didn't. And I think it's because we're meant to be here, now, together. In this family, with this team." He paused, bringing his hand up to cup Tony's cheek, his blue eyes intense in the moonlight glinting off his hair. "I don't know what this new year is going to bring us. But what I do know, is that as long as we have each other, we'll be able to get through whatever it is. As long as we have each other's back, no matter what, we'll get through it."
Shuri had essentially regrown all of Tony's damaged skin, fortifying it in the process to be even stronger than it was.
He bounced impatiently in his seat as Papa pulled into the parking lot of one of their favourite little cafés, a place he and Papa sometimes ate at when Dad was out of town.
"I don't remember calling for a meal delivery," Tony said as Steve set down the tray, leaning back against the counter. Steve crossed his arms, holding Tony's gaze firmly.
And Tony shuddered to think how in the hell Steve would've been able to adjust to the twenty-first century without Peter's help. Everything from learning how to use a microwave to shopping for groceries and clothes to using a smartphone and driving a modern car, in those earliest days it had been Peter who Steve had leaned on the most. One of the fondest memories Tony still had of his two boys was that first night that Steve made dinner for the three of them at the Malibu house, and both he and Peter regaled Tony with stories about their afternoon adventures in the pool as they all ate together.
He was also hoping that after the proposal—as long as Tony said yes, of course—he could give up that apartment and move into the penthouse permanently.  Ever since he and Tony had spent their first night together, Tony had told Steve that he was welcome to stay in the penthouse whenever he wanted, which Peter later informed Steve was Tony’s way of telling him that he wanted Steve to stay with them, but still leaving Steve an out if he felt that he needed time away.
"Shh, mo grá, you know that's not true." He finally hefted Tony off the bed, practically carrying him to the back of the room where he gathered him into his arms. "This wasn't your fault, Tony, none of it was your fault. It was all HYDRA."
“Well, that was fun,” he said once the flame had burned itself out, leaving the tree surprisingly unharmed.  Getting to his feet, Steve brushed the bits of dirt and pine needles from his uniform as he studied the tree, committing its size and shape to one of his mind’s memory files so he could keep an eye out for more of them.
Glancing back at his half-completed armour, Tony pecked a kiss to Steve's lips and stepped back, closing down his holographic images with a clap of his hands.
The sight of that hateful symbol stretched across his own chest would've been enough to make him vomit, if he'd actually had anything in his stomach.
"Well, then that'll be the easiest thing I've ever done in my life," said Tony. "But now, we should probably go feed you, hmm? I wasn't kidding about Pete eating all of your pizza."
"Um, is there a reason why all you guys are just standing in the parking lot?" Carol suddenly asked from behind Steve's shoulder, with Colonel Rhodes standing next to her. "'Cause I thought we were supposed to be meeting inside?"
"Project Rebirth," Steve muttered under his breath as he slowly typed it into the search bar, adding in his clearance code when prompted.
Tony’s heart lurched, and he reached for Peter’s shoulders, pulling his precious boy into a tight hug.
"Oh, give me a break," said Natasha. "Weren't you just grumbling earlier today about how early the twins have to get up for school?"
"Ohh, Hank's not gonna like that," warned Lang. "No offence, but I don't think he likes SHIELD very much."
Bruce huffed, removing his glasses as he stepped closer to the screen. "Ahh, well… I honestly can't say that—"
The beginning of the Quinjet's descent into Wakanda startled Steve out of his semi-doze, and he looked up to find Natasha gently prodding awake a sleeping Wanda, whispering into her ear as she yawned and rubbed her eyes. She shot Steve a sympathetic smile as she then gently poked Pietro in the side, whispering for him to wake Clint, who was sprawled out across most of their shared couch.
Steve visibly flinched, and Tony immediately reached for his hand, bringing it to his lips. "Sorry, honey. I shouldn't've said that."
Tony frowned, but nodded as he sat down on Peter's bed, curling his arm around his son's skinny shoulders as Sharon took a datapad from Bucky's lap and tapped it several times.
Tony said as he grabbed the lube from Steve's bedside table and moved to straddle Steve's hips, their erections sliding against each other as he settled over him. Heat blazed through Steve's body as Tony took his hand, squeezing some of the lube into his palm before guiding it between them.
He only wished that his son's selfless act hadn't been rewarded by Steve's utter failure to win the most important battle of their lives.
"From my understanding, Captain," Davis began. "You were initially rejected in your attempts to enlist in the Army. In fact, you were rejected four separate times before finally being accepted into the Strategic Science Reserve. Is that correct, sir?"
Shock swept across Steve's body like a wave, amplifying the pulsating pain in his ribs and foot to almost unbearable levels as tears stung his sore, swollen eyes.
Choking and gasping, Peter clutched Gwen's body to his chest, rocking back and forth as tears flowed down his cheeks.
The scan began again, panning from south to north this time. Peter yawned as he watched the waves breaking against the shoreline, pinching himself every time his eyelids got heavy.
"That's what I'm thinking," Steve agreed. "This place used to be a prison decades ago based on the intel from Clint and Natasha, so it would make sense for there to be a guard tower stationed close to the entrance."
"Damn, but that thing is big," Sam said under his breath. "Someone must be compensating for something."
knowing that those words are still buried somewhere deep inside my mind, where no one can reach them except the bad guys, and I just… I just want them
"Thanks." Tony ran his fingers down his unkempt goatee, trying to concentrate on the fact that they were going to find Steve instead of the possibility that it might take another week, or even longer.
"Hoo boy," Tony said as he watched them go, trading gentle—and some not-so-gentle—barbs the entire way. "Were we ever like that?"
"Anyway," he said after a short pause, holding up his camera. "Is it okay if I take a couple pictures of you? Some before-the-wedding pictures?"
"You mean, these could make me as small as a real spider?" Peter asked once they were home, his pure, boyish delight warming Tony's heart like a heater as he studied the vial of reddish-pink dots. "Dad, that's so cool!"
The foot that had been smashed by Justin Hammer and his HYDRA-controlled drones, almost beyond repair.
And the fact that Steve had obviously gotten to not only know Peter's father but decided that he liked Dad enough to ask him out on a date, well, that was just funny.
“Pete… what…?” he stammered as he scrambled around in the glove compartment for a pair of sunglasses.  After unfolding them with his teeth, he then proceeded to poke himself in the eye as he went to put them on, nearly causing him to rear-end a taxicab that was attempting to make an illegal left turn into an alley.
"Copy that," said Dad. "And keep your eyes open. You'll probably be the first one to see Thanos when he gets here."
"No, I'm not," Steve answered. "From the looks of things you and your dad are gonna have us pretty well prepared, so I don't see what there is to be afraid of. I'm actually pretty excited."
Of course, incredible food hadn't been the only way Steve had been spoiling Tony. In fact, if his math was correct, Tony was certain that he and Steve had had more sex in the last three weeks than they had on their own honeymoon, when it had just been the two of them. From sleepy morning handjobs and blowjobs and the occasional afternoon quickie to hours spent exploring each other's bodies after Peter went to bed, the two of them had probably spent more time getting each other out of their clothing than they had actually wearing any.
And so far, aside from one gym class where Peter had forgotten that he had only packed a short-sleeved shirt, and therefore had to dig through the very smelly and gross lost and found for a long-sleeved gym uniform, it had worked out just fine.
Which only made Peter even more determined to get to the bottom of what was going on. If he could somehow keep his family from being torn apart and help them actually catch all the bad guys, then he was going to do it.
Tony sighed heavily as he leaned back in his chair, waiting for his computer to finish compiling the last of the code he'd just entered. He had asked Phillips if he could continue working in his office during the X-302 patrols instead of just sitting around in the hangar, to which Phillips had agreed as long as Tony agreed to follow the comm chatter over a speaker and report any potential issues to him right away.
As soon as he hung up the phone Tony shoved his fist into his mouth, biting down hard on his knuckles as he tried to keep his tears contained. No amount of tears would help Peter now.
"Um… I kinda broke 'em," Peter mumbled. "While you guys were gone." And if he was being truly honest, he didn't even know where they were at the moment.
If he hadn't banked right when he had he would've gone up too, and likely taken Sam right along with him.
And yet at the same time, now that he had gotten a taste of being admired for who he actually was as a person instead of a certain selective skill set, Steve found himself constantly craving more of it, almost like a drug. Peter was just so…
After pondering for a couple of minutes, Steve typed in another query, this time searching for the names of current and former civilian scientist liaisons, a list for which his clearance level was just barely high enough.
Apparently, she and Howard had struck up a friendship of sorts, something that Tony had found rather… interesting.
Natasha and James. Two of his teammates that were still alive, even if 'alive' no longer quite meant what it used to.
Quill scoffed, grimacing at Mr Clean. "Yeah, Drax. Did ya really have to bring up my father's ding-dong right now? Right in front of me?"
could construct the model to present to the Joint Chiefs, and then step back and watch as they proceeded to drool all over themselves, something Tony was convinced that Obie got off on.  He was never in a better mood than he was after one of those presentations.
"It's okay, buddy, it's okay now," Tony said as he climbed into the bed, smoothing Peter's sweaty hair from his forehead as his eyes fluttered open, wet with tears. "You're safe."
"Steve, where is he?" Tony cried, revving the boat's engine as high as it would go, attempting to drive it through the ice that now looked to be at least a half a metre thick. He managed to get within about ten metres of where his boys had gone under when a split suddenly appeared and Peter was tossed onto the surface, choking and sputtering and shivering as he slid across the slippery ice, struggling to find a handhold.
“Um… yeah,” he says quickly.  He clears his throat as he indicates the mounted guns.  “These here look a lot like the pulse cannons that Johann Schmidt built back during the war, using energy he channelled from the Tesseract.  They’re definitely a HYDRA design, and they pack quite a wallop, so we’ll have to make sure we all stay on our toes.”
Gwen's eyebrows knitted together. "If it's just an internship, why're you acting like I'm breaking up with you or something?"
"Uhh, I can't tomorrow," Peter said sadly. He ran his hand through his hair, likely sending his curls running in every which direction. "My dads, they don't let—they don't like me going anywhere when they're out of town, it makes 'em too jumpy, so… but as soon as they get back, I'd really like to come, that sounds—that sounds like fun. Yeah."
"No, not unless something really weird happens." A knot rose in Tony's throat. "Mine… I never got as bad as Pete. My defect was pretty much the same as his, but… he should've had his surgery over eight years ago, after he was first diagnosed, so—"
The fact that Gwen was probably seriously considering Oxford as a college choice suddenly hit Peter, and he let out a hard shudder, feeling like he'd just been zapped by one of Auntie Nat's widow's bites. He could barely handle the thought of Gwen being away for eleven weeks, there's no way they'd be able to survive four whole years apart on separate continents.
"Yeah, I did," he said. "'Cause as soon as I peered my head over the top of the bassinet, Pete opened his eyes, and he looked up at me with this adorable, tiny baby expression that was something like, 'who the hell are you?' But then once the nurse picked him up and put him in my arms, it was like he already knew me. Even the nurse remarked on how comfortable he seemed with me right away. And his eyes… Steve, they were mine. They were the exact same as mine." He sucked in a sharp breath as another tear slowly made its way down his cheek. "And I knew right there, in that very second, that I would do absolutely
Peter shot Tony a rather harsh frown.  “If JARVIS’s ‘however’ is his way of saying that you stayed up all night working on that dumb missile schematic instead of sleeping, then I already know.  I just wish you didn't try to lie to me about it.”
“We have evidence, Obie,” Tony added before Obie could think of a response.  He held up the papers, rifling through them.  “Orders, shipping manifests, and decrypted communiques between your friend General West and the bad guys over in Sokovia.  It’s all here.  The gig is up.”
"It's not too far, little guy, okay?" Steve murmured, kissing the top of Peter's head. "We'll get you set up in no time and then you can go to sleep."
“Oh.”  Steve ducked his head, inhaling the slightly coconutty scent of his beloved boyfriend as he tried to push those awful memories back into their appropriate file.
"All right," Tony said as he shook Stacy's hand. He glanced down at Gwen, her green eyes glassy but determined. "You good at keeping secrets?"
"He's not gonna think any less of you, so you can let go of that dumb idea right the hell now," Tony said firmly. "Pete's not shallow, babe. Not in the least."
Tony moaned as Steve broke away from his mouth and kissed a path down his cheek to his neck, sucking gently on his pulse point as his trembling hands worked the buttons of Tony's shirt, shoving it off of him before going to work on his belt.
"Yeah, I know! Just a sec!" Peter answered as he shoved his trigonometry textbook into his backpack, carefully zipping it closed. Then he patted his back jeans pockets, and his hoodie pockets, and his front backpack pockets, searching for the stupid phone that he couldn't seem to find. Again.
"I do not see any errors in either the design or its specifications, sir," answered JARVIS. "Would you like to run a diagnostic on this projection?"
They both looked up as Gwen entered the classroom, balancing an inordinate amount of books in her arms, along with a laptop perched on the very top of the stack that looked to be dangerously close to sliding off.
So instead, he simply says, “Sweet dreams” and closes his own eyes, revelling in the knowledge that no matter what happens next, he at least knows that the man that he loves, loves him back.
As if in direct contrast with his stormy emotions, the sun was shining brightly outside, the late spring air crisp and cool as Steve mounted his motorcycle and took off in the direction of the nearby hospital, smiling as he felt the breeze whipping across his face and through his hair. He never bothered with a helmet, something he knew drove his ma mad with worry, but he had always rather enjoyed living a bit dangerously. There was nothing quite like the adrenaline rush that one got pulling out of a 3G dive just in time to avoid pancaking against a mountain, and since Steve had been driving motorcycles even longer than he'd been flying aircraft he figured he didn't need to worry about a helmet.
"Dr Banner is already working on locating the exact source of the server, Captain," said JARVIS. "However, he is unsure how much of his time he should devote as he is also still attempting to decrypt the coded files from the Mongolian base."
Which was yet another thing that he and Steve had in common. Tony knew all about trying to bury traumatic memories to avoid dealing with them, or finding less-than-helpful ways of dealing with them when they refused to stay buried. Drinking, gambling, and throwing himself into his work, Tony had tried them all in his attempts to process the various traumas associated with his father, both when he was still alive and with his abrupt death.
Gwen smiled, her pale cheeks flushing a light pink. "Well… even if I do, there's still the whole logistics of me moving to England for three months, which Mom and Dad aren't too sure about."
But apparently Steve had made some pretty definite plans for the room that night, as Tony discovered as soon as they set foot inside. Flickering candles sat on top of the dresser and both of the bedside tables, throwing shadows onto the walls and giving off a soft, glowing light that highlighted the lighter blond strands in Steve's hair. The bed was already turned down, with a large bottle of what looked like scented massage oil sitting next to their smaller bottle of lube on Steve's bedside table.
"Shh, Peter, it's okay," Papa whispered as he patted Peter's back. "I'm scared too. But what we have to try and remember is that we're stronger than our fear, okay? And as long as we all stick together, there's no way that our fear can win."
"Mmm, this is nice!" Gwen said as she tapped in her information, handing it back to Peter with a shy smile. "I bet you get to try out all the prototypes from your dad's company, huh?"
“I’d be happy to, Mr Stark,” replied Sam, his eyes never leaving Obie’s face.  “I counsel veterans from all five branches who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Also known as PTSD.”
"I told you you would die for that," Thor said, low and tight as he pushed the blade of his axe even further into Thanos' chest. Thanos let out a harsh cry of pain, one so terrible that Steve shivered.
“Take your mark,” says the announcer, followed immediately by all of the swimmers grabbing onto their starting blocks.  As Steve bends in half to reach his block, the camera zooms in on his face, which has hardened into a look of frightened trepidation that was nowhere to be found on either of the previous videos.
Which was all par for the course with Peter. Aside from a few psychopathic criminals and a couple of schoolyard bullies, Tony hadn't met a single person who didn't absolutely adore his sweet boy.
"Are you all right, Captain Rogers?" JARVIS suddenly asked, quietly but still loud enough to cause Steve to jump. "Are you in need of any assistance?"
"There is no safer place for the stone besides Wakanda," T'Challa said firmly. "And I also do not believe it would be possible to destroy it."
"Yeah, thanks," Peter said, trying to smile. Of course the first time he was ever this close to a girl that he liked it had to be when he was so sick that he could barely walk.
"Uhh, well…" Tony stammered. "He went out for a run early this morning, and I saw his sketchbook sitting there on the table so I just decided to flip through it while I was waiting for him to come back, and I found a drawing that was just like the one that you drew. With the birds. It was just too similar to be a coincidence, so…"
Tony had just finished turning Peter onto his opposite side and readjusting his pillows when JARVIS spoke up. "Pardon me, sir, but Dr Banner is requesting your presence in the laboratory. Captain Rogers is already there."
It also didn't mean that he wasn't almost scared to death about the fact that he was now placing the man he loved in danger of getting arrested for treason. Tony had no doubt that Steve would gladly go along with whatever version of Project Phoenix came to be, and especially if he knew that it was Peter's wish as well. But the fact that the stakes had already been raised about a million-fold haunted him. Tony had heard various stories over the years about Air Corps widows and had personally seen the anguish Rhodey and Carol had gone through after his accident, and it wasn't something that he was at all looking forward to having to face.
Steve grunted as Tony unlocked the door and helped him inside, bringing him over to the bed. Curfew was due to begin in about ten minutes, which meant that he had just enough time to hurry down to the mess hall and grab some food before the lights went out.
"Ahh, yeah. Or at least I hope I can," Scott said. He clasped his hands together, shifting nervously.
"Yeah, it's better." Peter pecked her lips again before drawing her in for a big hug, inhaling the sweet lavender scent of her hair. "We need to do stuff like this more often."
T'Challa gave him a rather sly grin. "We do get news from around the world here in Wakanda, Mr Stark," he said. "And your incident in the Middle East drew quite a bit of coverage."
"Mmm," Peter mumbled as he dragged his gaze over to Steve, his eyes widening in shock as they took him in.
“There's a lot about it that’s instinctive,” he concludes.  “And that’s not something that can really be taught.  It’s more innate, like a gift.”
"Steve?" Tony said as he touched down about twenty metres away, his voice laced with trepidation. "Honey, is he—?"
Besides, Peter already had a father, and one that he obviously loved very much. And he really barely knew Steve.
She broke off then, covering her face with her hands. "They made my brother and me watch while they—while they killed him, and then they took us and gave us some kind of drug, and—"
"Well, damn," said Carol. "If this metal can do that then why aren't we using it to build all of our aircraft? The Meridian missiles and bullets would just bounce right off!"
"Good. 'Cause as much as I might like you, I'm not really in the mood to take a missile shot for you at the moment, is that clear?"
Hmm," muttered Tony as he studied the tablet. "Seems pretty sparse for such a big base. You thinking it's been abandoned?"
"Like Bucky," Steve murmured. Fresh tears stung his eyes, recalling Bucky's mangled arm as he hauled him out of his busted-up cockpit.
Peter did have to admit that it was kinda funny how flustered Mr Harrington got whenever Papa appeared though. Most of Peter's classmates had gotten used to having one or more of the Avengers showing up at the school on any given day, but whenever Mr Harrington happened to see either Dad or Papa, he practically dropped to his knees in worship. And while Dad tended to take it in stride, Peter knew that it bothered Papa quite a bit and he was just too polite to say anything. Papa never liked drawing extra attention to himself. The celebrity status he had garnered from being Captain America and from being married to Iron Man was already more than he wanted.
"Would've had to have been moving pretty damn fast to be unseeable, especially by JARVIS," Uncle Sam cut in. "And as far as we know, no human can move that fast."
"No, I think I'm too hungry to sleep," answered Peter. "Can we please stop and get some food on the way home?"
"Got it!" Sharon said as she yanked out the tube. She quickly shrank back, allowing Steve and Tony to rush to Peter's side as his body began to relax, his eyes slowly blinking open.
"Oh yeah, she's definitely a hot one!" Carol yelled over the comm. "So why don't you boys get your asses up here and see for yourselves!"
“And…”  Steve trails off as clears his throat of more stubborn apple juice.  Once again, he’s at a loss for words, trying to figure out how to tell Natasha that somehow, her million-to-one shot-in-the-dark turned out to be spot on.
"I'm just informing you, Stark, that Thanos will be a more difficult challenge than even the technomage who brought us here," said Dr Strange. "Which means we must be prepared."
He was just on the very edge of a light sleep when calloused fingertips suddenly brushed softly across his forehead, burying into his hair. A wide smile stretched across Steve's face as he opened his eyes to find Tony looking down at him, that smirky half-smile on his lips that only Steve ever saw.
"Yes, Papa," Peter said with a sigh. "Liz told me at practise today that both of her parents would be here the whole time. There's nothing to worry about."
"It sucks, doesn't it," said Tony. He pressed a soft kiss to Steve's clammy forehead. "Not being in control."
The officer frowned, glancing towards his partner who reached behind him, pulling out a pair of handcuffs.
"Yes, Mr Stark," Lang said rapidly. "It is very, very clear. Like, crystal clear. I swear it. For the record."
“All right, just hold your horses.”  Dad’s eyebrows knitted together as he positioned the glasses on Papa’s face, giving his nose a playful tweak once he was done.  “Well, what do you know?  Even those ugly glasses look gorgeous on you.”
"They got Loki's sceptre, Tony," Steve said firmly. He grabbed onto Tony's elbows, preventing him from escaping off the bed. "Whoever this was, if it was the Chitauri or someone else, they knew exactly where it was being held. Clint and Natasha said that the attack stopped after the two blasts, so the enemy knew exactly where to hit us. And then, probably while everyone else was busy scrambling around, they came down and took it."
"Not too bad this morning," she said once she was finished. "You're a bit damp, but nothing I wouldn't expect given your history."
"There's nothing wrong with just sciencing for fun every now and then, Pete," Dad playfully retorted. "It's what all you kids do in that school of yours every day, isn't it?"
Peter stared up at the clock above the classroom door, watching as the second hand slowly ticked its way around. He'd been staring at it for so long that the numbers were starting to blur together, but seeing as it was his last class of his last day of his junior year of high school, he didn't want to be caught off-guard when the bell rang.
"No, not exactly. But…" Papa trailed off, glancing back at King T'Challa, who was standing at the head of his warriors, flanked by General Okoye, his sister, Shuri, and another tall, broad dude who looked like his bodyguard. The king's lips twitched as he gave Papa a nod, one that Papa grimly returned.
"Oh gods, sweetheart," Steve whispered only a few heartbeats later. "I'm so close. I—I can't—you just feel too good, and I—"
it was, Tony," Steve said. "And he also said that so far none of the SHIELD scientists have a clue what it was either, so—"
“Oh my God,” he rasped as his stomach gave a violent swoop and his head started to swim, grateful he was already on the floor as he watched Image Papa start tossing bloodied chunks of cinder blocks over his shoulder.  “Papa, I’m so sorry!”
And then, all Tony would be able to do would be to step back and let the chips fall, hoping like hell that they fell the right way.
"Well, it helps when we have such an awesome team," Gwen said, elbowing Peter on the arm. "I'm predicting that we'll win State this year."
“So about two hundred and forty doses per day,” said Tony.  “Enough to stock a field hospital out in the middle of Sokovia, yeah?”
"Well, then, what?" snapped Uncle Bucky. "We can't just leave him alone the whole damn day, Sam! Then he'll really start to catch on."
As he stepped through the second door from the restroom, Tony gasped, stopping short as the cat suddenly bounded gracefully onto the end of the tiny cot shoved against the wall.
Steve pleaded as he attempted to reach for his t-shirt, halted by Tony's tight grip on his arm. "Tony, you're obviously sick, so why—?"
"Thank you," Peter answered with what he hoped was a kind smile. His smiles had been so few and far between lately that when he did manage one it seemed so foreign on his lips that he was afraid it looked fake. But the lady gave him a kind smile in return, so maybe it hadn't been too horrible.
"Oh, Papa's always talking about minding our surroundings," Peter said, trying to sound nonchalant. "Says it can help you avoid getting into fights, that's all. Pretty sure it's a military thing."
"Wow! That's incredible!" he exclaimed as Peter proudly showed him his completed drawing, which was so richly detailed that it appeared almost lifelike. "You have such a natural talent!"
All Tony could think about was that he had to get out of there, somehow had to get Peter out of that godforsaken hospital and somewhere else, where he could be safe. He'd heard various reports over the years of a few people who'd managed to defect over to Meridia, so maybe somehow he and Peter could—
"Yes, thank goodness for Peter," Steve agreed, sneaking a quick glance at the wall clock. "And if we get going right now, we should be able to get back into the city in time to pick him up from school."
"Which we both know that we would never use unless we had absolutely no other choice." Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead, then tipped his head back, eyeing him intently. "If it'll help us sleep better at night, sweetheart, then I'm okay with it. Peter deserves to feel safe in his own home, and that includes all of our land up at the Compound as well."
And an extra-huge thanks to @therollingstonys for all of the beautiful moodboards, and to @allthesinnersandthesaints for being such a wonderful beta!  💖
, Tony. So scared to lose what I've found, and then when I almost did—I couldn't take it, sweetheart, I couldn't! I'm not—I'm just not strong enough!"
"Yeah, well, tell her I said hi next time you talk to her, okay?" said Carol as she glanced at the timepiece fastened around her wrist. "I'm already late to meet James."
these guys, out there in space when I flew that missile out of New York. I saw how big their ship was before it blew up, and—and if that was only one part of their invading force, then… I don't know how us learning more about a handful of rocks is gonna help anything."
"That's 'cause he won't be, babe," Tony stated. "I don't care what he says or how much he begs, he's still just a kid."
Natasha's eyes flicked to Tony in alarm. "I'm all right, Steve, really. You're not exactly a hundred percent yourself yet, so you don't need to worry about—"
“What?” Tony asked, shaking his head as he climbed into the driver’s seat of the orange Audi.  A lot of the time he honestly forgot that Stark Industries was even involved with the development of drugs, much less actually testing them.  Howard had created the pharmaceutical research division of Stark Industries at the request of Tony’s mother, to try and rehabilitate his public image after one of his many blunders.  But since Tony wasn’t really involved with its logistics and Obie hardly ever mentioned it, Tony often forgot it even existed.
"Oh, yeah," said Cam. "When you see your kid tonight, tell him that we all say hi, hmm? No way any of this would've worked without him."
"Eh, it's coming," answered Tony. "I'm hoping to get it done before we leave for Italy, that way we can test it once we get back."
"JARVIS, run another pre-flight check for me again, yeah?" Tony asked, nervously adjusting his headset for the umpteenth time.
Swiping at his leaky eyes, Steve turns back to his computer, pulling up yet another grant proposal draft.  He’s written so many of the things since he started working at Empire State that he can practically do them in his sleep, which is exactly the kind of busywork that Steve needs while he tries to conjure up a mental picture of what this Mr Tony Stark and his son might look like.
“Ehh, not necessarily,” answers Steve.  “Just because I used to be a swimmer doesn’t mean I know how to coach.  I’ve met tons of swimmers who would make really lousy coaches, and a lot of really good coaches who never made it anywhere beyond their high school teams.”
Tony's throat tightened at how utterly defeated Steve sounded, and how helpless he felt to offer any sort of comfort to him. The kind of bone-deep mental fatigue was all-too-familiar to Tony, and not something he would wish on anyone.
Tony wasn't aware of how much time had passed. It could've been seconds, minutes, hours, or even centuries for all he knew as he sat there, his eyes never once straying from the ashes that coated his hands. Clung to them like the stubborn moss that used to try and climb the walls of the Malibu house.
"Don't see that we've got much of a choice," Tony replied. "If we don't get those suits into some open air it'll be just like you said. They'll squash us all like bugs. Plus it'd be nice if we could break through their cloak and give Bruce a chance to hack into their files before they manage to delete everything."
Peter never sees what sport he actually wins in, only that he does in fact win.  To him, the actual sport never matters too much, only his desire to excel in it.
Just then the glasses activated, projecting an image of a dark, dank, bunker-like building. Steve gasped as soon as he saw it, grabbing onto Tony's shoulder.
The starting gun catches him so completely off-guard that for the tiniest fraction of a second, Steve freezes.  He’s thankfully able to recover before anyone notices—besides Phillips, if he’s watching—but he still is last to hit the water, already giving him a huge disadvantage.  Once underwater, Steve completes his usual six dolphin kicks, but with the pain in his shoulder ramping up he’s not able to squeeze his hands together as tightly as he usually does, and therefore doesn’t get nearly the amount of push he usually gets from them by the time he surfaces to take his first stroke.
"No, no, I forced myself to go home and get cleaned up," answered Tony, laughing for the first time in he couldn't remember how long. "Those uniforms really are hideous, aren't they?"
"Well, you did an exceptional job," Steve said. He patted Peter on the shoulder as his cowl retracted, momentarily surprising him. He wasn't used to not having to remove it himself. "I'm very proud of you both."
"This must've been what happened when he was taken out of stasis and given a new mission," Steve said, his Captain's voice wavering ever-so-slightly. He wrapped an arm around Peter's shoulders, tucking him close. "Sam, keep going, we're almost there!"
"C'mere, sweetheart," he said, pulling Tony onto his lap. He opened his sketchbook, taking out the two portraits that he'd finished only the day before and handing one to Tony. They were identical, two copies of the same picture of he, Tony, and Peter standing in front of the massive tree that Peter had told him so much about. The three of them were posed as for a photograph, with Peter in the middle and Tony and Steve on either side, their hands resting on Peter's shoulders.
According to Uncle Bucky, apart from some pretty heavy dogfighting while Papa and Auntie Carol were flying towards space, the actual coup seemed to go off with only a couple minor hitches. General O'Brien and all of his government cronies were now locked up in the Air Corps brig, under guard by a bunch of soldiers loyal to Colonel Phillips, while the various bases and weapons facilities located along the former DMZ were being raided and catalogued by another squadron of soldiers. Uncle James had also reported just yesterday that Dad had finally managed to uncover a database hidden deep inside the Meridian computer systems that had been basically a massive library of Langaran blueprints and design schematics. The stuff in there dated all the way back to when Grandpa was still working for the Air Corps, allowing the Meridian government and its scientists complete access to any and all Langaran tech.
He did have to admit, however, that the fact that Steve wasn't trying to hide that they were together helped quite a bit. They had even entered the mess hall holding hands, with Steve sitting Tony with his teammates while he went to get their food, and aside from a few curious glances in his direction, no one said or did anything that Tony would've considered less than polite.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together into what he probably hoped was a fierce glare, but his red-rimmed eyes and the tear track winding through the grime on his face lessened the effect, causing him to look almost pathetic.
Tony leaned forward, tossing an almost imperceptible wink in Steve's direction. "It was actually the other way around, Senator," he said. "Mr Fury was kind enough to negotiate on my behalf with the Armed Services Committee when the request was made for me to head up the agency. The committee wanted a civilian, and obviously someone with the means to get the job done as quickly and as thoroughly as possible."
"Yeah, yeah, J, it's in the same place it's always been," Tony answered. "Tell him to make himself at home, but no shooting any lightning bolts indoors, all right? I'm definitely not in the mood for any holes in the ceilings. Not to mention last time he blew out at least three fuse boxes."
"No, they left there the day before yesterday. They're in Mongolia now, I just talked to them last night."
"It's just a standard barracks room," added Steve, once again mistaking Tony's silence for hesitation. "I—"
Steve chuckled.  “Well… then, how ‘bout because Peter needs you at home?  I know how much you don't like leaving him.”
With three Stark men all living under one small roof they definitely needed the peace, and lately Tony had just been too exhausted to put up much of a fight.
"Absolutely nothing," stated Carol, earning an eyeroll from James. "I'd personally be more worried if all you two were doing was just going to sleep every night."
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, his long fingers wrapped tightly around Tony's arm, clinging to him as if he was afraid he was going to drown if he let go. Tony brushed his lips across Steve's forehead and temples, murmuring soothing words as he waited for Steve to calm down. He had learned through trial and error that trying to rush Steve through one of his anxiety attacks was the absolute worst thing he could do.
"What the hell?" Tony mumbled as Steve gathered him close, pressing his ear over his heart. A few heartbeats later Tony's head snapped up, his eyes narrowing as they focused in on Steve.
As soon as the school’s doors closed behind Peter, Tony’s heart began to flutter.  He’d been trying to psych himself up for any number of possible reactions Steve might have to seeing him after almost three days of no contact, his way of hoping for the best while at the same time preparing for the worst.
But first, he had to make sure they all knew how much he appreciated them, how important they were to him, and how proud he was of them.
As Tony and Colonel Rhodes buried their noses in the documents, Steve turned to Bucky, who looked about as uncomfortable as Steve felt.  He held out his arm, relieved when Bucky stepped forward for a hug.
"Oh, you do, do you?" barked Tony. "And what're you gonna do, just sit around on your ass and watch while we work?"
Finally, as clean and prepared as he could possibly be, Steve headed back towards his room to grab his sketchbook and motorcycle keys. But as he headed down the hallway towards his room his heart hopped into his throat as he noticed Tony sitting cross-legged on the floor by his door, papers strewn across his lap and a pencil in one hand.
Steve gave a tired nod. "Thank you," he forced past his scratchy throat. "And how long until his ribs heal?"
"Barely, hon," he admitted. "But I'm not on here to talk about me right now, yeah? I need to know how you're doing."
"And again, Steve, this is not your fault," Natasha said. "From everything I've heard, our boy was a hero while all of this was going down."
"My father was an Air Corps pilot too," she began. "He loved to fly, loved the notion that by being up there in the air that he was helping to protect our country, and us by extension."
Tony draped his arm across Steve's waist, burrowing closer as he closed his eyes and breathed in his husband's intoxicating scent, ivory soap and the slight hint of vanilla that always seemed to seep from his skin. Whoever thought that the plain, ten-cents-a-bar ivory soap could smell so damn good?
“Hungry,” finishes Mags.  “Yes, yes, a growing boy like yourself.  And you’ll only get more famished as you start training more, hmm?  All those swimmers are so lean, you know it must burn a lot of energy!”
After realising that Tony hadn't been home in over three days Rhodey had decided that he'd had enough, practically yanking Tony's arm from its socket as he dragged him down to the cadets' locker room. Once there he shoved a bar of soap into Tony's hand and ordered him to not come out until he smelled better than the overflowing trash can next to his desk.
“Oh,” Steve says with a nod.  He should’ve guessed it was something like that.  “I thought you told me that your math’s never wrong?”
"His heart rate and respiratory patterns were consistent as such, Captain," answered JARVIS. The UI paused then, as if he was weighing his next words. "However, Master Peter specifically requested that I not report it to either yourself or to Mr Stark."
Searing, piercing, throbbing pain, burning across every single nerve fibre in his body and intensified by the faint but piercing constant noise being piped through the speakers mounted in the upper corners of his cell. Even the slight movement of regaining consciousness had been enough to send hot flashes of pain shooting across Steve's body like a million bayonets stabbing him from all directions. His head was pounding like someone was driving into his temple with a jackhammer, his chest crackled and protested with every single shallow inhale, and he was pretty sure that at least a few of the bones in his left foot were broken, if the throbbing keeping time with his heartbeat was any indication.
"Oh yeah, you do," Bucky cut in. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a tin of the Altoids that he always carried—whenever he wasn't around Peter, at least—and tossed one onto Thor's lap. Bucky had loved peppermints for as long as Steve had known him, often buying bags of the brightly-wrapped candies at the corner store whenever he was able to save up the ten pennies he needed in order to pay for them. With Peter's sensitivity to peppermint thanks to his spider DNA, Bucky mainly stuck to cinnamon candies now, but Steve still remembered the day that he first asked for a peppermint as one of the biggest turning points in his recovery.
"All right, that's all well and good, but then what about Thanos himself?" Dad asked. "From what you guys said, even without the gauntlet he still packs a wallop, right?"
Plus, Tony couldn't wait to start tinkering again, to lose himself in a project just because it was fun. It'd been years since he'd had the time.
But, just like Steve had managed to change Tony’s mind about his own lovability, he had also completely shattered Tony’s formerly-ironclad fears about allowing his son out of his proverbial sight, and all by being nothing more than his usual, wonderful self.  Tony liked to say that Steve had not only courted Tony with all of the genteel of the quintessential 1940s gentleman, he had also courted Peter, proving that, amongst all of his other impeccable qualifications, he was an absolute natural when it came to parenting.  Taking Peter out to eat, and to baseball games when Tony was particularly busy, picking him up from school, and in general slipping so easily into a co-parenting role that when Steve sheepishly asked Tony a few weeks ago if it would okay for him to officially adopt Peter, Tony had said yes without a single moment’s hesitation.  After Afghanistan, Tony had been dogged with the realisation that he’d had yet to nominate an alternative caregiver for Peter in the case of his untimely death, and, given the need for the hunk of metal currently embedded in his chest, not to mention his new, not-an-office-job side gig as an Avenger, it was a huge weight off of Tony’s shoulders to know that if something were to happen to him, Peter would be taken care of by someone who loved him just as much as Tony.

Peter's brown eyes were glassy with tears. "But Papa, I can heal just fine on my own! Please, it's Dad we need to worry about, and I wanna stay with him!"
But finally having a good-paying job and the ability to chip away at his lingering debt still doesn’t mean Steve is ready for a relationship.  Especially with the father of the boy he just agreed to coach.
As if on cue, both Tony and Peter turned to look behind them, where Antennae Lady—Mantis, apparently—was standing with Mr Clean—Drax.
"I'll be a lot better once you take this bastard out!" Joseph yelled back, grunting as he banked a hard left and curved into a dive, pulling up just in time to avoid crashing into the top of a mountain.
