“No, you didn’t know that.  Everyone else did.  I skip the turn, I don’t need to pick up the cards.”
He also wanted to yell out Hallelujah because despite Sherlock being a twat on a constant basis and insulting Greg multiple times in a day, Greg had missed the man.  More than he thought he would.
Just then Donovan jogged up to his side, stopping to look at the sorry mess in front of them.  She threw Greg a look to say ‘
“Oh, Lestrade.  I thought I recognised the dog” Came Sherlock’s voice, completely unfazed that he was caught without his pants, pushed up against a tree with his legs wrapped around John Watson’s waist.
“Do you know anything about it?” he asked as he was indeed here about the body, found in the top floor of the warehouse.
The sheets are wonderfully cool against my skin and I let out a little sigh of satisfaction.  Another sigh leaves my mouth when I turn my head and realise the pillows smell of John.  John has such a wonderfull, homey smell.  I could get lost in that smell.  And apparently I do, because it is not until the left side of the sheet is being pulled back that I realise that John has returned.
“Donovan” Greg growled.  True, Sherlock was the most unsocial person he had ever met, but there was a line that he would not let his team cross and Sally was getting pretty damn close to it.
It was as John was drying up the last of the dishes that he heard a triumphant cry come from the living room followed by Sherlock yelling, “I knew it was the sister-in-law, I just had to find the right piece of evidence!”
Greg sood there for a few seconds, wondering if giving his details to a junkie was a good idea and then, deciding that there was nothing for it now, he turned and headed out of the waiting room and down the corridor.
“I think Rosie is going to love having her own room” Sherlock said, his tone indicating that he was definitely trying to avoid the topic of conversation.  “We could paint it pink.  Or orange.  She likes orange.”
Greg dug into his pocket and pulled out an evidence bag with a wallet inside.  “I do believe this is yours” he said, dangling it up in front of the consulting pain in the arse.  “Unless there is another posh looking git going by the name of William Sherlock…”
“Says the man who brought extremely deadly plants into the flat which is home to a very curious toddler.  Well, done you.”
I knock on Johns door, not wanting to ring the doorbell incase Watson is asleep.  Whoever said I am an inconsiderate arse hole, clearly don't know me too well.  There is no answer, but I know John is home.  There is no reason he would take Watson out in this heat.  I am pretty sure that would be considered child abuse and John tries to avoid things such as endangering his child.  It was why he refused to come along on the case with me two weeks ago when he couldn't get a sitter.  It was only surveillance work - Watson could have napped in the back of the car - but John called me a tosser and hung-up.  It had been a long night, indeed and extremely safe, which I made sure I let John know.  But he had just ignored me, much as he is doing now.
'  I'm not sure what he is dreaming about but the grip is actually a bit painful so I gently rub his hand and his grip loosens.  A content sigh leaves his mouth and his whole body relaxes against mine.  A bit too much apparently as in the silence Johns relaxed body lets go and an almighty fart rips through the silence.
“That from the little wifey” The forensic tech taunted and without another word, Sherlock’s face shuttered closed and, tapping a quick reply to whatever message he had, he locked the phone and put it in his pocket.
"Water will be perfectly acceptable" I tell him, sitting down at his kitchen table and ignoring his own melt down.  That will teach him for ignoring mine.  Clearly, he doesn't think this should be ignored.
“Why would I be.  I was in there three days ago, looking for evidence.  Who do you think directed Dimmock to the correct location?”  At this a disbelieving laugh left the taller mans mouth.  “God, you don’t actually think he figured it out on his own, did you?”
John looked down at the book, not even bothering to question how Sherlock knew what he had been reading with barely a glance in his direction and conceded that yes, Sherlock was probably having a better time than him.
So, to feel completely soft and pliable and rubbery now was a completely new experience for Sherlock Holmes.  It could be that John was, in fact, a fantastic lover, quite possibly the best in the world, or it could be the anticipation that had built up over the years, or it could be the fumes from the chemical soaked rags that were hanging in the bathroom, or maybe it was a combination if all three, but regardless of the reason, Sherlock Holmes could not move and for once in his life, he didn’t care.  All he cared about was feeling this good forever.
Greg was about to reprimand Sherlock on involving his homeless network when another voice filtered down the hallway.
“So you will marry me?” Sherlock asked, suddenly feeling nervous.  He waited what felt like forever for Johns answer.
I let out the breath I was holding, the relief washing through my body making me far dizzier than the lack of oxygen was doing. I lay in the dark trying to parse what the hell is going on.  John doesn't do this.  Ever.  Well, he does do cuddling.  I had witnessed it multiple times.  It was stomach turning, at first because I thought all forms of sentiment were a waste of time and brain cells and then later because I realised that I wanted to cuddle.  Not just with anyone.  That would be deplorable. It had to be with John.  Although, I don't mind getting the occasional cuddle from Watson, but that is something completely different and not worth mentioning.  She is adorable.  Even Mycroft has offered her the odd genuine smile.  You would have to be made of stone not to show her affection, but I am really getting off topic now and not really addressing the elephant in the room, which is, John Watson is cuddling me, in bed, at night time and I am not wearing pants and he seems to be perfectly okay with it all.  So okay that he has apparently gone back to sleep.
I stand in silence, right under the flow of the air duct and let the cool air flow over me.  Instantly my melting body starts to solidify once more.  I am interrupted in my salvation when John speaks.
Still utterly bewildered Greg nodded his head and then quickly said “No, no.  Not an emergency. Just hadn’t heard from him in a few weeks.  Wanted to make sure everything was all good.”
Mycroft knew John was not in bed as he left his door and Rosamund’s door open while they slept, and both doors were shut.
“Oh, I don’t know.  Maybe it was the thirty-odd text messages yesterday demanding I give you a case.”
John gave a shrug.  “Lots of stuff” he replied, which was no help at all.  “Erykah Badu, Queens of the Stone Age, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder.  Don’t mind Nine Inch Nails, either. To be honest, I mainly like your stuff a lot.”
It was then that John noticed that Sherlock had actually put on a bit of weight.  It wasn’t much, but his cheeks weren’t so drawn and his shirt buttons weren’t as lax (not that they were very lax to start off with).
Both men had a slight limp to their gait and neither found it comfortable to sit for long periods of time, nor on hard surfaces at all.
“Ah, Mycroft” Sherlock said, rather amiably considering not only their usual relationship, but also his current position. “Enjoying an evening stroll.  This isn’t your usual neighbourhood, is it?” And there was the usual childish bantering.
Sherlock turned away again to place his violin back in the case, making a mental note to buy strings, and shrugged his shoulders in a bored, apathetic way.  “You wanted to. I was bored…”
.  That was not how Hallooween was supposed to go.  Nowhere in Sherlock’s plans did a succubus come and take John away.  It was him and John, not him and John and an old crone.
Mrs Hudson reads, will not come to the surface and scream themselves at John.  What if I fondle him whilst declaring my never-ending love at John.  It would definitely involve me breeching Johns side of the bed which will apparently conclude in being kicked out of John's bed and worse.  Out of his life.
It had been a while since he had allowed himself to do this, and judging by the amount that he was already leaking, it wasn’t going to take long.
“Ignore the order, false alarm” he said into the phone somewhat weakly and hung up, as he slammed the lid of his laptop shut.
I don't beat John at a single game.  Had we been playing for money, his wallet would be bulging.  As it is, we are playing for skittles and that bastard wins all the green ones.
Sherlock looked up from what he was doing to see that John was holding Watson a bit tighter than he normally would.  Her squirming and frown was a clear indication that this was not appreciated on her behalf.
“Is that a wedding ring around your neck?”  Sally Donovan sounded like she wanted to laugh and it took a few seconds to realise that she was looking at Sherlock.
That didn’t sound as friendly as it could have and Greg couldn’t give a shit.  “Sally, let them through” he called and after a glare from Donovan she turned back and lifted the tape for both men to duck under.
What an abhorrent thought.  “Would you like me to start shooting up the walls again?”  The reply was sulky and petulant and Sherlock dropped into his chair and sunk down as low as he could go.  Seriously, why had he had to think of Mycroft and his stupid ball, of all things, to distract John from his
“Of course you didn’t fucking lose” John was yelling again and even to his ears it was a bit hysterical.  “You made up a new fucking rule every time something didn’t go in your favour.”
"You naked?" he asks sleepily.  I feel the mortification light my face on fire.  I have never felt ashamed of my nudity before.  Now I wish for layers of clothing; my suits and scarf and coat, despite the heat which is slowly increasing on my body as shame spreads through every pore.
"But, you are sleeping on the couch" I tell him, although I shouldn't have to.  It was clearly very obvious that that was the arrangement.
Sherlock let out a low sigh.  “If only I were. The restaurants had been in the family for two generations.”
"Sh'lock?" he mumbles into my shoulder.  Here it is. Here is John realising the situation we are in.
By the time John got back with Japanese take away (clearly out of revenge for Sherlock ruining the book, as Sherlock didn’t like Japanese food) he still hadn’t thought of anything.
“As I was saying,” Sherlock said, speaking over Greg.  “The only reason that I managed to get cut in the first place….”
Mycroft was concerned. The Watson’s flat was in complete darkness. The kitchen and living room were devoid of all light, including the Christmas lights that were usually placed on every evening. The hall light was also out and while Mycroft had not gone as far as putting a camera in John’s bedroom or bathroom, it was clear that no light was coming from those rooms either.
The drive back to the flat was silent.  Whatever was on Sherlock’s mind was not going to be discussed.  They pulled up to the flat and Greg let Sherlock go up to the flat on his own, opting to go knock on Mrs Hudsons door.
“What’s different about this one?” Sherlock asked, looking around at everything but Greg and not acknowledging that he had brought his husband along to the crime scene with him.
He knew it would. It always did. With the release came the reminder that Sherlock would never want him, in that sense. Sherlock didn’t do sexual, or even romantic, relationships. John would only ever be, Best Friend.
It was this thinking that had Sherlock blurt out the first thing, the thing that had got him making plans for Halloween in the first place, that came to mind.
John counted to three to eliminate any sarcasm or irritation from his voice.  It wouldn’t do well to start a fight.  “Well, I was trying to read the newspaper.”
This may be the only time I get to cuddle John Watson, so I force myself to relax and bring my hand up to rest on the arm that is across my waist.  I close my eyes and let the darkness envelope me.  I let the smell and sound of John relax me.  I forget that Hell was trying to take over Not-Hell and ignore that my body is hot wherever John is pressed against it.  It is a welcome heat, a comforting warmth and surprisingly, My brain shuts up and I fall asleep.
He left to the sound of John saying “Yes, Lestrade” and Sherlock calling out “I wouldn’t hold your breath.”
“True” said John thoughtfully, and then with a more suspicious tone  “Is this going to be a new habit of yours then? Socialising with your brother to fight of boredom.”
“More” Watson called out excitedly and Sherlock pulled a salmon atrocity out of the wardrobe and threw it over her blonde curls.  The child squealed with laughter and proceeded to try and pull it off again.
It was then that Sherlock exited the bathroom with what looked like a blood sample and stopped to prepare a slide at his microscope.
huddle under that for warmth.  If Sherlock played his cards right, he would be able to wriggle his feet under John’s thighs.  Maybe he would forego socks, so his toes were like ice, then he would have an excuse.
I don't want to go in there.  Already, I feel my clothes starting to restrict me.  It is then that another idea lights up my magnificent brain.  I really do blame this insipid heat for me being so daft today.
Sherlock bloody Holmes.  An unusual name for an unusual man. And a pain in the arse, to boot.  Greg just knew, that if he had the fortune (he still wasn’t sure if it’d be good or bad) to run into that man again, he would be trouble.
“I’ll be unavailable for the next two weeks.  Don’t bother me” Sherlock said, in that bored yet demanding way that he has and then strode away.
The groan that sounded through the dark was low and pained. Automatically, Mycroft lifted the receiver on his desk phone and hit 04. On the second ring, it answered. Not good enough.
“Right, I’ll leave you two to it, shall I” Greg said, his amusement at Sherlock’s uncomfortableness growing.
Is what okay?  The fact that I am in his bed?  The fact that he is fine with the fact that I have no pants on?  The fact that we are cuddling (well, he is cuddling me.  I am laying here like a stiff plank of wood, but shock will do that to a man) ?  The fact that he hasn't kicked me out of his bed yet?  Well, yes.  It is all fine.  It is all perfectly fine.  Therefore, there is only one thing to say.
Ignoring Sherlock’s assessment of his own blood, John opened his laptop and started composing an email to Harry.  He was four paragraphs in when he decided that what he was doing was a terrible idea and he deleted the whole thing.
Greg looked at the message with bleary eyes and then at the time on his clock.  3:37 am.  God, when that bastard got back in the country he was going to make his life a living hell, at least for the first 24 hours.
John momentarily stopped making the tea and looked over to Sherlock, a slight crease of confusion between his eyes.  Or it could have been annoyance, Sherlock was never sure with this one. “Huh?” he asked.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.  Shut the door” and Greg turned around and marched out of the room, closing the door behind him.
He rounded the edge of the hotel, the idea that he would go sit on the edge of the pool and soak his feet.  He knew that the pool was closed for the evening, seeing as it was past midnight, but he also noted that the owners didn’t actually lock the gate.
“Then I won’t buy you another one, but I’ll still need a hand carrying them over and you’re the only one here not drunk.  Come on” and Greg got up and made his way towards the bar, not giving Sherlock a chance to decline.
"Only with fondness, you berk, now go to sleep" and with that, John settles back and presumably closes his eyes.  It takes me a few seconds to realise that he is still facing me.  I don't know what that means.
Whoever was on the other end of that Skype call must be interesting, that’s for sure.  The last time Greg interrupted a conversation like that was between Sherlock and his parents and Sherlock had just slammed the lid of his laptop shut as soon as Greg walked in the room.  No goodbye or anything.
“You don’t want to go in there” Molly said as Greg went to push the doors to the morgue open.  He glanced over at her and took in the timid way she held herself and the fierce blush that was on her cheeks.
A gasp escaped his lips, as he let his fingers extend down, on a down stroke, to brush over his sack.
toddler wakes up she will be happy to see you and you should know by now, Sherlock, how much she likes to pull on things.  If you think her yanking on your hair brings tears to your eyes just think what the result will be if she yanks on something else and finally, she is not going to get a chance to yank on anything else because you, Sherlock Holmes, are going to put your bloody pants on RIGHT THIS INSTANT."
Thank you to all who have been following this fic. Your kudos and comments have been encouraging.  Apologies that this next chapter has taken so long but my computer died. It was reported back to me yesterday that it is going to take longer than expected to fix, so I am having to do all of the rest on my phone. Apologies for any typos or formatting errors and a big Kudos to those who do all of their typing on their phone. I didn’t realise just how much it sucked until I had to do it.
He had come to the crime scene and looked around.  Not much had left his mouth but what had, had been mumbled.  Except for the insults.  Despite being fewer of them, they were a lot harsher and because, despite what Sherlock said, his team was smart, everyone kept out of Sherlocks way.  Everyone, except for fucking Donovan.
“Is, umm, is Sherlock around?” He asked, looking past her to the stairs leading up to apartment B, hoping she’d get the point and let him in.
John let out a sigh.  “Sherlock, if you want to watch something, feel free.  You don’t need me to do it.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “The report is on Molly’s desk. Make sure the door shuts when you leave” he said to Greg, and turned back to John.
“The body has been here for four, maybe five hours, but he wasn’t killed here” Sherlock said, lifting up the corpses hands and studying the fingernails.  “He was killed then cleaned meticulously before being dumped.  Judging by the state of his hands and the tread of his shoes, I would say that he is an office worker that does some walking around.  Nothing too fancy, real estate agent, possibly small time lawyer.  Cause of death was the blow to the base of the skull.  There is no indication of alcohol or drug use, nor any sign of being in an altercation before he died, so either he didn’t hear the person coming up behind him or he trusted them.
I am going to die.  I am going to slowly come undone and melt into a puddle and soak right into this mattress and no one will ever realise what became of Sherlock Holmes because there will be nothing left of me except for an odd stain in the mattress and people are far too stupid to realise that it is all that remains of me.
Surely that message could have waited.  Greg had only got to bed an hour and a half ago and he had to be up in less than three hours.  Plus, the ‘
Sherlock sunk lower in his chair, his scowl deepening on his face as he desperately tried to think of what he could blow up on the 5th November that would a) keep John by his side and b) not get him arrested.
“Well, clearly your memory is lacking.  After we had cleaned up, I said ‘Marry me’ and you replied with
The inevitable doesn't come, which is sort of an extreme contradiction if you think about it, seeming as the very word
John shook the paper, trying to get his focus back on the article before him.  “Because I don’t want to.”
Greg put the cigarette in his mouth and lit it.  One day he would stop smoking for good, but that would have to wait until Sherlock stopped being an utter pain in the arse.
He was about to ask why when a loud shout came from the other side of the doors.  A very familiar shout.
Normally Mrs Hudson's hand is cool to touch.  Lovely, invitingly and blessedly cool.  Not today.  Today it is warm and of no comfort.  I am not sure if this is because she is suffering more than she lets on or if she truely is Satan.  Or, maybe the bride of Satan, nagging him and bossing him around and making him hot lava cake for tea (her lava cake is simply perfection on a plate.). Yes, that is it. My landlady is the bride of an imaginary fallen angel who rules over an imaginary kingdom of fire and brimstone.  A kingdom they felt that I apparently needed to be dragged down into.
The man held out his hand.  “Mycroft Holmes” he introduced.  “We have spoken on the phone, several times.”
It didn’t matter though.  Greg needed to get Sherlocks observations on the body that had been brought in late last night. They could finish their argument later.
When he turned back to Sherlock the man was practically hyperventilating.  “Look, Sherlock” Greg said, placing a hand on the other man’s arm.
With a sigh, he got into his car.  “A couple of weeks” Greg mumbled, starting the engine.  If Sherlock voluntarily stayed away from New Scotland Yard for two weeks, then this was serious indeed.
“No” Greg snapped.  “You don’t get to pull that fucking shit on me, do you hear” Greg said sternly, but quietly enough that only Sherlock could hear him.  Sherlock’s face slackened and his whole body seemed to droop.
"So this is still okay then?" John asks in the semi-dark of the room.  The sun will be coming up soon, which means Watson will be awake soon.  These cuddles are not going to last forever.  If I don't respond to his question, John may possibly think I am having doubts.  That is a notion that must not cross his mind.  If it even creeps to the edge of his mind, he will stop because John is like that.  John doesn't like to make people uncomfortable.  That is my job and I am quite good at it.  But I don't want to make John uncomfortable, so I should probably answer his question.
“Your suspect wears a foot brace, more than likely due to some childhood deformity that was never fixed - probably because his parents were poor -, quite possibly caused by polio...”
"When is the saint going to arrive to fix the air-conditioning, thus dragging me back up from the depths of Hell and back into the land of Not-Hell?"
I slowly peel myself off of my sheets and make my way out of bed and down stairs.  I should at least put on my dressing gown but just the thought makes me sweat even more, and it's not like it is anything she hasn't seen before.
Sherlock frowned for about five seconds and then suddenly his face came to life and he grinned.  “Oh, that is marvellous.  Graham, text me the address, I’ll be about ten minutes behind you.”
Greg winced at the sight of the tails of what he was certain was a ridiculously expensive jacket, dragging in the dirt and possibly other unsavoury substances.
“Not much” the man said, trying and failing to get to his feet.  He fell back down onto his arse and hissed as his arm jolted, but decided that that was the best place to stay.
It doesn't take long for John to fall asleep.  It never does.  John, being a doctor and a soldier, knows how to fall asleep at the drop of a hat, should he need to.  Unless something vexing is keeping him awake, unless his depression is playing up then he has always been able to just sleep.  It was one way I envy John.  I have to run my body to exhaustion to get my brain to shut up long enough to fall asleep.  And right now that isn't going to happen.  Right now it is screaming at me with all the things that could go wrong.  The Mycroft voice is telling me to get up and leave.  Lestrade is there telling me to not panic and to just lay there and appreciate the cool air and the fact that John is by my side.  Mrs Hudson is mentally patting my cheek, telling me it will all be okay.  Anderson, the idiot in my head can't see what the problem is. Mary is there giggling away, telling me to snuggle closer to John.  Irene is reprimanding me for not going to her.  She could have helped me, after all, she knows what men like John likes.  Thankfully, Moriarty hasn't joined the party. He must be avoiding the heat, like a sensible mental image.
With a very controlled inhale, John closed the book and stood up.  “Cheers for that” he said, dropping the book on his vacated chair. “I’m going for a walk now” and then he left, leaving Sherlock alone to sort out how he could possibly get out of this mess, without revealing that a) he had lied and b) revealing his true
Greg couldn’t believe his fucking luck.  What he had come out to avoid was the exact thing he had found.  Looking up he could just make out, thanks to the full moon and clear summer sky, John’s head and shoulders, leaning over the edge of the pool, his head resting on his arms.  Behind him, Sherlock was slowly moving, his face buried in Johns neck, the water lapping in time with his slow, gentle thrusts into Johns body.  The whole act was the complete opposite to what he had walked on previously and it seemed that now, it was more of an intrusion that he be there.
Just then the far corner lit up, catching Gregs attention, and he turned to see the light from Sherlock’s phone light up the mans face.  Sherlock looked happy, like really, truly happy.
Monday night the two of them were laying in bed, John encircled in Sherlock’s arms as the two of them listened to the quietness that surrounded them, barely there shadows danced against the darkened ceiling, whenever a car drove past.
He always asked after a case, so long as it wasn’t too late and the consulting detective always sneered down his nose at Greg, but not tonight.
Although it would serve him right if Greg did text him.  Constantly.  Greg hadn’t gone on many holidays since meeting Sherlock but every time, Sherlock interrupted his few days of peace and quiet with ridiculous and very irrelevant deductions and constant complaining and nagging.
"Afternoon" John says, standing there in shorts and a t-shirt and a smile and it is then that I realise that he doesn't sound at all concerned about my well-being.  I hadn't even done my hair before I arrived.  That should be a perfect indicator that something is clearly not wrong.  He should have his concerned doctors voice on now, not his smarmy
Greg thundered up the stairs, thankful that Mrs Hudson was a night owl, because Sherlock Holmes was not answering his bloody phone.
The driver is clearly not impressed with a lack of tip and makes this clear by calling out some insult, that involves me having a phallic-shaped appendage incorporated onto my head, but I don't care.  I just wish his air-conditioning to stop working and then make my way to Johns door, convinced the soles of my shoes are starting to melt the more contact they have with the pavement.
“Oh, Detective Lestrade, how lovely to see you” Mrs Hudson chirped.  “It’s been a while, how have you been?”
"I saw you get out the cab" He tells me and the look I throw him is of utter disbelief.  And they call me a psychopath.  I would assume he was Satan's nephew or something, but his house is too cool, so clearly he is just a mere minion.
"If you didn't want to cuddle, you only had to say" John grumbles and then makes to pull away and that is just not right.  In fact that is very wrong and would be going against everything I had hoped would one day happen but never actually really expected so, before he can pull his sweaty arm away from my sweaty stomach I clamp a damp hand over his arm and cling tight.
“Leave” the man said, not even looking at the woman.  Right then and there, Greg decided that Sherlock was definitely gay, because no straight man could ignore breasts, that big and bouncy, when they were practically thrust in ones face.
"I'm not sure what that has to do with anything but I already have that in my life, you git and do you see me complaining."
“Right.  So, stir-fry or risotto for tea?”  Clearly, John didn’t want to discuss this.  Weather it was the topic of music, boy bands or Cosmo, Sherlock wasn’t sure.
Oh, god!  This is worse than the time I had to decide whether to tell Molly her current boyfriend does in fact detest cats.  I still haven't decided if I should tell her.  I think I should, but the John in my head tells me to let her find out herself.  I mean, I could set him up so he is arrested so she will just dump him and I won't have to say or not say a word to her but Molly is already skittish about potential partners being criminal masterminds, so that probably isn't a good idea at all.  God damn Moriarty, making my life difficult, even now!
“Just telling her not to waste her time.  Plenty of other fine men in the pub, she at least chase one who is going to acknowledge her.”
Once breakfast was had and Sherlock was in the shower, John wandered downstairs.  He looked at the front door, wondering if it was warm outside and then turned and headed towards Mrs Hudson’s flat.  He tried the door. Unsurprisingly, it was unlocked. He went inside and checked to make sure the back door and the windows were secure and then perused her book shelf in the living room.  Noticing an author he was familiar with, he plucked out the book ‘
“One of these days, you are going to get yourself killed and then do you know what will happen?” Greg practically shouted as the medic pulled the shirt off of Sherlocks shoulders with a gentleness that Greg wasn’t really sure the consulting idiot, currently sitting in the back of an ambulance with several knife wounds along his ribs and torso, deserved.
Deciding that letting John continue to hug me is probably more than a bit not good I start trying to move my legs from under his.  Apparently, this is the wrong thing to do.  John growls, pulls himself closer and then proceeds to drape an arm over my waist.  Fuck. Despite this being one of my deepest fantasies, this is also a right bloody nightmare and not at all how it was supposed to happen.  Well, it wasn't supposed to happen, at least not outside of my mind palace.  And both of us are supposed to be naked.  And there should be more bodily fluids being transferred other than sweat.  And both of us are supposed to be aware of the fact that we are cuddling.  If that what this is.  Is this cuddling?  Maybe John just likes to spread himself over the bed and I just happen to be in the way.
“The music to be played is a compilation of your favourite pieces that I play for you.  The cake is the orange one that you liked. Although, to be fair, Watson was very fond of that one too.  Every step of the planning involved you.”
He swept the torch back over what he had originally thought was a bundle of old rags and took a step closer.  Sure enough, sticking out from the old, stained blanket was a hand, far too skinny and pale than a living person’s hand had any right to be.
After walking for an hour or so with Mycroft, Greg decided that since it was dark and there was practically no one around, he would let Darcy off of her leash.  As it turns out, it wasn’t his best idea.  As soon as the stupid mut got a whiff of squirrel, she was off, Greg chasing after her, calling her back.
It was Sherlock’s time to let out a sigh, his short and irritated.  “Not really any point on my own” he grumbled and then stood up and went to his room.
Lestrade walked past the empty office cubicles towards the elevator, making sure he left the door open.  One final up yours to Sherlock Holmes before he went home.
It was then that a car drove past the flat, it’s headlights temporarily lighting up the room in a dull, yet quick light, that Mycroft could make out a shape on the couch. A shape that was not, at all, in any danger.
“No you weren’t.  You have been starting at the same diagram for the proposed update for the  Redbridge roundabout for the past fifteen minutes.”
Sherlock was a bit put out.  He liked explaining these things.  When other people got it, it wasn’t  clever, it was just normal.
“How much caffeine have you ingested?” Sherlock asked curiously as he watched John tap his fingers on the arm of his chair.
"What took you so long to answer" I grouse, pushing my way into Johns flat so he can shut the door.  It wouldn't do for Satan (or his vengeful and cheerfully sadistic bride) to direct all of their hot air into Johns safe haven of euphoric temperatures. "I have been out there, on your doorstep, dying for ages."
The cab ride over to Johns little suburban apartment is a brief, yet somewhat mildly blessed relief.  The cabbie has the air-conditions blowing a gale in the back of the cab. Unfortunately he also speaks.  A lot.  And what does he want to speak about?  The weather.  I tell him three times to shut up, but apparently he is either deaf, stupid or just plain rude.  When we arrive at the Watson's, I pay the driver and make sure he doesn't get a single penny more that the cab fare.  It gives me an excuse to sit in the air-conditioned car for a bit longer as I slowly count out the change.  Clearly, Satan hasn't commandeered the London taxi companies as of yet.  It won't be long.  It is a good thing I had thought of this sooner than later.
“And nicotine patches” Sherlock repeated, to confirm the fact that he had gone through twice as many patches as he did normally.   “You can’t, though.  You need to keep your body active or you get restless.  As for shooting holes in the wall…”
“Oh, god, definitely not” Sherlock shuddered, dropping that one to the floor with full intentions of burning it later on.
After ten minutes, Greg sighed and pushed the blanket back.  Sleep was clearly not coming anytime soon.  Maybe a shower would help.
Greg didn’t wait for them to continue, he quickly backed out of the room, letting the doors swing shut behind him.
I ignore her questioning.  I am not speaking to John.  John made a joke about the fact that he had air-condition when I rang to
“No” Sherlock said without even looking at him.  He was far too busy laying on the couch to acknowledge the man any further.
"I'll let you know now" John says as we step into the hall way.  "If you hog the bed, I will kick you onto the floor."
had picked out for him.  “She didn’t do any of it. It was her ex-husband using her drunken blackouts to confuse her.  He killed the neighbour.”
The man looked up at Greg and kept talking, completely ignoring Donovan’s existence.  “The bodies, according to the papers, were all female, white, nurses, aged between twenty three and thirty.  Other than that, they had nothing in common.”
Sherlock turned back to John.  “Yes. That shouldn’t come as a surprise to you.  I am bored frequently. There are holes in the living room to attest to that.” At this, his hand waved towards the smiley face above their couch.   John looked in that direction and gave a resigned sort of sigh.
John frowned again.  “It would have been nice to know I was getting married today.  To have some say in it.”
“You’ll have to find something else to do tomorrow” John pointlessly pointed out.  Sherlock would be well aware that his lock-in entertainment was over.
What an absurd idea.  Why would I set my bed on fire.  The frame doesn't creak.  It has a very good mattress on it which supports my spine, no matter where I lie or how I lie.  It has sheets, much softer than what I am currently lying on and my pillows remember the shape of my head.  Unfortunately, it doesn't come with it's own cooling system.  Maybe I could look into that, should Hell ever try and merge with Not-Hell ever again, providing one day Hell does go back to where it came from eventually.  Plus, setting my bed, or anything for that matter, on fire would only make things hotter and that is just not on.
Anderson huffed, and walked back out of the flat to see where the technicians were with the floodlights and Greg didn’t miss the smirk that came over Sherlock’s face at Andersons reprimand.
On Sunday, there was a game of poker but, as it was bound to do, quickly turned into strip poker which then quickly turned into Sherlock poking John, a broken chair and rug burns on both their knees.
At this, Sherlock may have blushed.  “I, umm, may have forgotten to send out the invitations.  They all got a text message at eleven thirty last night.”
Jesus, he had thought that with John on morphine while recovering from a stab wound, he’d be safe from all that.  Clearly he was wrong.
When the meal was ready, Sherlock was too preoccupied with a series of photos that he didn’t hear John tell him that the food was ready.  Knowing it was a lost cause to try and get the man’s attention, John placed the bowl of stir-fry next to Sherlock and then headed back into the kitchen to eat his own dinner.
“American ambassador is visiting”  he answered with as little enthusiasm as possible and turned and made his way back into the living room.
At this, John looked from Sherlock to the room behind him at all of the bouquets of sunflowers that were around the room.  The green of their ties, Watsons dress and table decorations had been selected to complement the sunflowers.
Greg took another few steps closer.  Instinct told him that this man wasn’t going to hurt him, especially if his wrist was actually broken, which Greg was certain it was.
“Oh, I can’t complain.  My hips a bit twingy in this weather, but if that’s all of got to complain about at my age.”  She left the sentence hanging and gave Greg another friendly smile.
John groans.  Well, it is his own fault. if he chose to forfeit the comfort of his own bed, then he has no one to blame but himself.  No take-backs.  The bed is mine.
I don't know why John is so shocked.  It isn't like he hasn't seen any of this before.  He has patched me up on multiple occasions and on several parts of my body.  He is a doctor and was a soldier for crying out loud.  Nudity should in no way garner the reaction he is having at this very moment.
Eventually, his mind cleared enough to realise that John had climbed back into bed with him and was curled up against him with his arm over Sherlocks stomach.  Sherlock would try to offer some form of affection back but while his mind was coming back on line, his body most certainly wasn’t.
John sighs.  "I hope you are actually just being over dramatic and you didn't actually set your bed on fire."
“What that means, Sherlock, is that I will actually have to put up with your more than arrogant brother in person - which if I am being honest, just the prospect of that eventuality scares the shit out of me.  It will also mean a fuck-ton of paperwork for me because you are not actually meant to be here, let alone, running off without me.”
"Good" he snuffles and then he does go back to sleep.  I can hear it in the way his breathing deepens and evens out.
"Whenever you want" John replies.  He sounds relaxed and not at all surprised that I want to cuddle. I like that about John.  He just accepts me.  It's a nice feeling.  I couldn't have found a better person to want to cuddle had I set out to do it myself.  I must remember to thank Mike for bringing me John.  It was a fine move on his behalf.  I might even stop stealing his passes to the labs.
Any moment now, Mycroft will join me, equally as naked and melting from the heat because this is Hell and the only way it could get worse was to know I will be spending eternity with my brother.  My naked brother.
Greg turned and, flicking his unfinished cigarette into a nearby pot plant, he made his way back to his room to enjoy the airconditioning and the absent sound of Sherlock and John having sex.
Greg waved a thanks to Mrs Hudson and jogged up the stairs, only stopping briefly to knock on the open door.
I think over Johns offer again.  No.  It definitely wasn't obvious.  I tell him.  "No.  That wasn't obvious at all."
"There is a spare toothbrush in the second draw of the bathroom" John tells me as he rummages through his draw looking for pyjamas.  Oh, the bane of having a small child.  No more nights of sleeping in the nick.  "I'll let you use the bathroom first."
“You stupid cow” he snarled and instantly, Sally stepped back finally aware that Sherlock had a limit.  “If you put half as much effort into your work, as you do at being useless, you wouldn’t have to sleep your way to the top, waiting for Greg to retire or be killed so you can get his position, which, by the way, won’t go to you, despite what the Superintendent says.  If you channeled even a fraction of your energy into actually doing your work, people may actually respect you for more than just a walking pair of ti…”
“Yeah, I figured there was enough posh in there with all your stuff” was Johns reply as he stepped to the bed and lifted Watson up, sending her into a fit of giggles as he pulled her up onto his shoulders.
“I deleted anything that had to do with boarding school, including ties” Sherlock said, batting Gregs hands out of the way when he went to smooth Sherlock’s hair.  Greg grinned.  He knew it would get a reaction to try and touch those curls.
John and I sit in the kitchen, and John coerces me into a game of poker.  One game turns into five as I am determined to beat him, but the blasted man has a much better p-p-p-poker face than I gave him credit for and bugger it.  Now that damned song is stuck in my head.  Curse Lady Gaga and her catchy tunes.
“You’re normally a bit more dignified when you eat” John stated as he watched a noodle slap against Sherlock’s chin before the man sucked it up.
Feeling a bit dumb and not really knowing what else to say, Greg just nodded. “Yeah, thanks.”  He had so many questions running through his head but clearly they weren’t going to get answered today, because Mrs Hudson bid him farewell and closed the door.
Mrs Hudson reached out and patted his arm.  “It’s much better now” She said.  “I’ll let him know you dropped by.”
There were quiet moments on the couch, where half a movie or a single episode of something simple was viewed, but it never lasted long before wandering hands distracted them from what they were doing and coaxed them into doing something else.
I backtrack out of the room and make my way to their little bathroom.  There I find the toothbrush and brush my teeth.  I use the toilet, but not before turning the rubber ducky around so it isn't watching me with it's pervy little grin and then wash up before heading back to the bedroom.  When I get there, John has changed into boxer shorts and a t-shirt.
He wished he hadn’t.  The last thing he heard, before the lift doors shut, was Sherlock groaning out, “
John drops his arms to the side and just looks at me as if my brain had melted.  Maybe it has.  Maybe that was why I couldn't win back any of the green skittles.
"Going to bed.  You could have put one of the lamps on so I didn't have to stumble in the dark."  John turns on his side so his back is to me and it is quite clear that the man is preparing himself to go to sleep.
“Anderson.  The fact that we can’t see anything in here means that you’re not doing your job.  Go see about the lighting.”
’.  By the look of the guy, it could be either or.  He was clearly off his tits, if the track marks up his bare arms and uneven pupils was anything to go by but then, take away the bruising and the sallow skin and the guy was a right looker; angled features, plush lips, dark curls, albeit in desperate need of a wash.  As Greg got closer, he realised that the hair wasn’t the only thing in need of a wash.  He was only two feet away from the man and he could smell him.  He wasn’t rank, but he smelled by no means pleasant either.
Sherlock was in fact, looking forward to Halloween home, with john, watching old scary movies on the couch.  It would be chilly and John hadn’t had much work lately so, not wanting to up the electricity bill and use the heater but not thinking it cold enough to go through the effort of lighting the fire, he would bring his thick, soft blanket down and they would both
John laughed again as he pulled Sherlock down into a kiss.  “You utterly mad man” he smiled between kisses.
The room falls into absolute silence.  I realise I have stopped breathing.  Despite what almost everyone thinks, I am not new to sex.  What I am new to is bed sharing.  Especially with your platonic friends with which you have unrequited non-platonic feelings for because clearly, despite there being some bi-sexual activities in the past, your friend does not return said non-platonic feelings.  That leaves me completely unprepared as to what to do next.  Do I just let John sleep on?  Maybe he will role back over.  Maybe he will wake up and not be absolutely mortified.  Do I hug back?  Is it a hug if done with the legs?  Can you hug without your arms?  Surely you must be able to.  Otherwise, how would amputees manage?  If I hug back, will John wake up?  If he does, and is furious, can I use the defence that he hugged first?  Will that make things okay?
fan” John said, walking into the room.  Watson looked up from her blocks and Sherlock looked up from his laptop.
“No, Detective Inspector.  My brother hasn’t fallen off the sobriety wagon” Mycroft assured, all business like.  “But he is going through a bit of personal turmoil at the moment.  Perhaps if you were to give him a couple of weeks before inviting him along on any more cases.”
“Yeah” John replied cheerily, not looking up from his book.  “Karren, the woman I met at the bookstore” at this he nudged his current book up a bit and Sherlock decided he didn’t like where this was going.  Clearly, anyone called
Sherlock considered this.  Of all the things he would have thought John would have liked, he never would have guessed that something so safe and ugly would be his choice.
“Who is that?” Greg asked, surprised that not only did Sherlock have a visitor, but one that appeared to be in his bedroom.
Since I have been extremely lucky so far I decide to try and push Johns goodwill just a bit further.  "John?" I ask.
“No” Sherlock mumbled, throwing the shirt onto the bed, making Watson laugh as it covered her head.  The first time had been an accident, and then it had become a game.
“Sherlock” he said very quietly and very carefully.  “We have only been going out for three weeks. We were not even engaged and I think I would know if I was planning a wedding.  As you said, it wouldn’t be my first time.”
John, looking furious, opened his mouth to snap back a retort, only to stop and close his mouth, his face going from mad, to thoughtful.
Good.  Yes, I suppose that is one way to sum it up.  Bloody fucking fantastic is another way, but there is still a chance that John will wake up properly in the morning and still kick me out of his bed and also out of his life.
After the Uno incident, Sherlock seemed happy to keep to himself as he immersed himself in the cold-case that had been giving him trouble the last day or so.
Finally, John looked up from his book with a look that said he was trying to figure out Sherlocks plan.   “But I thought we weren’t going to that” he finally said.
Oh, God, I am dying.  I am being smothered as I sleep.  Satan has finally decided to grace me with his presence and smother me with a blanket.  A heavy, sweaty blanket.  But I refuse to go down without a fight. I reach out, in the dark and push against the blanket, I push it away from my body.  Push on it's smooshy face and free myself.
Suddenly, composing a playlist was that much simpler and it was done with a small smile on his face.
“This one left a note” Greg said slowly as he looked at the shorter man.  Something seemed familiar.  Distant, but familiar.
Sherlock looked up from his laptop, the animated smile on his face quickly turning into one of calculating observation as he took in Gregs harried appearance.
John burst out laughing at this statement.  “Sherlock, you stated at the beginning of this that being locked up with you for two weeks was a high risk scenario.  You get bored on a daily basis.  You shot holes in the wall.”
Damn, he owed Sally 50 quid.  He was certain Sherlock would have been a top and a bloody bossy one at that too.
“Our wedding, John.  It’s the day that me and you have decided to get married.  That is what a wedding is. There will be vows, signatures, cake, speeches and dancing.  You should know this. You have already done it once and why are you so surprised? You helped plan it, for crying out loud.”
“Well, now you do, so, Doctor Watson, should we get married?” Sherlock asked, smiling back at John and holding out his hand.
have to pick up the four cards.  That is how the game works” Sherlock replied, sliding the card back on top of the pile.
“There were no traces of blood or semen, from the victims or the killer and no evidence that the bodies had been molested in anyway.  Cause of death was strangulation and then they had their necks snapped once they stopped breathing.”
“Ummm, someone want to tell me what is going on in here?” came the oddly calm and bemused voice of John from behind him and Sherlock whirled around to see John standing in the doorway, work bag still clutched in his hand.
I turn my nose up at him for using my words of much needed help against me.  "And you call yourself my friend.  Next time, I will go to Gavin's and you shan't know if I am alive or dead because I will tell him not to tell you."
"Hmmm?" he replies.  That seems to be one of his favourite replies.  I like it.  Sometimes it means he is listening to me and is at least vaguely interested in whatever it is I want to say. Other times it is an acknowledgement that I have spoken to him, even if he hasn't actually taken in what it is I am saying.  It is an indication that he is still in my life, when other people would rather not be.  I like his little
Sherlock was going to have to rectify this, and soon.  But at the moment he had other things to worry about.
Greg positioned his torch to where he heard the moan and almost missed the huddled heap of miserable as the beam swept across the floor of the musty warehouse.
“Sherlock, you can’t use skip to get out of picking up the cards.”  Sherlock had copped four draw-2’s in a row and was now laying a skip card to get out of picking up eight cards.
Greg had made it a life rule that, unless it were actually a last resort, he’d never hit a woman, or anyone smaller than him, but right now, he was willing to break both those rules and punch Sally Donovan in the fucking mouth.
She reaches out and pats my arm.  "You'll survive dear.  Why don't you have a cool shower.  That worked last time."
I bristle at being treated like a child, but John is in a mood and chooses to ignore my very obvious bristling.  "First, if you drive me so nutty, then leave."
A small chuckle leaves Johns mouth and I can feel it travel over my chest.  It is a wonderful feeling that leaves goosebumps in its wake.
“If it looks like a bunch of beautiful, yet very harmless flowers, then it is not what it looks like.  On the other hand, if it looks like stems of English Broom, White Snakeroot and Lily of the Valley, then I am sorry to say it is exactly what it looks like.”
Sherlock was acting weird.  He had spent the morning looking at John like he was a particularly frustrating case to solve.
The junkie looked towards Donovan, as if only just noticing her, and judging by his current state, Greg didn’t think that was an impossibility.
“Call for a medic” Greg whispered to Donovan, and she turned and spoke into her radio as the man continued what he had to say.
John sighed, dropping his head against Sherlocks shoulder in resignation.  Sherlock just glared at Greg.  “As is letting one’s dog run loose, in a public area, when there are multiple signs stating that dogs must be kept on a leash at all times.”
John bit the bottom corner of his lip,  Swearing wasn’t going to help this situation.  It wasn’t that he was unaware of house rules but Sherlock seemed to be making them up as he went.
“But your preference, John?”  Surely John could hear how impatient Sherlock was getting.  He wasn’t usually this slow.
“No, nothing so exciting” Sherlock said, sounding somewhat disappointed.  “He shut down a chain of five star restaurants across Europe to instead run away with an American woman named Barbra and opened up a kebab shop in New York.”
This isn't summer.  It is Hell.  I apologise to Satan for never believing in him but clearly he does exist because I am currently laying somewhere in his home.  Possibly the torture chamber because this is truly.  Unbearable.
"Can we do this again sometime?" I ask.  I bite my lip, waiting for his answer.  Am I asking to much?  Was this a one time thing?  Is this actually him just apologising for eating all the green skittles?
The blonde just giggled, thinking Sherlock’s refusal was him playing hard to get.  She apparently didn’t get turned down that often.
Again, Mycroft smiled that not smile and gave a short bow of his head.  “I’ll be sure to let him know.”
John ended up picking up the four extra cards and informed Sherlock that there would be no more introductions of new house rules.
“Sherlock, you can’t place a reverse on a draw four” John said, sliding the card back towards Sherlock.
“Well, you introduced us, for one but you have also been keeping him occupied while I was away” John said with a genuine smile.  “You have no idea how comforting it has been to know that he has had things to distract from the noise in his head, that and, the few times I was here, I had to try and keep him from getting himself killed - I know what you put up with.”
“Evening” he nodded to a tall man, dressed in an impeccable suit, coming in the doors as Greg patted down his pockets and withdrew a packet of cigarettes.
“Measuring your fingers, John” Sherlock replied.  He had started with just the left hand ring finger, then curiosity got the better of him and he decided to measure all of them.  It was a good thing ebay had been selling packets of 20 disposable ring sizers. It meant he could do his own as well.
“Nope! Mycroft’s party is it.  Not that I believe you for one second that you only accepted out of my welfare, but fine, if you’ve said we’d be there.  I’ll just text Karren and reschedule the date. Maybe she is free Guy Fawkes night” he added on absentmindedly.
The arguing on this topic went back and forth a few more times before both men conceded that both were tired and that words weren’t communicated properly (which then sparked an argument with John saying Sherlock wasn’t speaking clearly and Sherlock stating that John wasn’t listening properly).
Sherlock had been standing to the side, looking for all the world, like he was lost, after spouting out his deductions.  Several times he had raked a shaky hand through his unwashed hair.
“I haven’t asked anything” was John’s reply, sounding a bit amused and a bit annoyed.  It would be nice, Sherlock thought to himself, if the man would exhibit just one emotion at a time, but then again, that wouldn’t be John.
Sherlock shrugged and swallowed the mouthful he had.  “Stop cooking and I’ll stop eating” he said and piled the last of the stir-fry into his mouth.
I hear John inhale slowly.  It is something he does when he has had enough and can't believe something is happening.  "Sherlock" he says slowly.  I am about to learn something.  This is the moon all over again.  "When I offered you my bed, I wasn't giving up my bed.  It is my bed.  I thought it was obvious, when I offered my bed, that I would also be sleeping in my bed."
I stop.  What?  Kick me onto the floor?  What the hell does that mean?  John has just made it sound as if we would be sharing a bed.  Surely, I misunderstood and make my way to the bedroom.
