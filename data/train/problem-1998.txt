John turned his gaze up in surprise. He hadn’t seen the figure above them; a pale man, medium build from what John could see, with his greyish hair either cropped oddly or just hanging at a weird angle as he looked down. He had a more subtle accent than the woman’s; a French one. He flicked the ashes off his cigarette down towards John, though it was entirely an empty gesture with the wind as it was.
Breaking into a full run once he’d swung the gate out of his way, the square came into view… A crowd or more accurately a mob, all as humans (thank Christ), surrounded Sherlock as a cloud of Neighbors churned above them.
under the proverbial rug to rot and stink there, he stalked swiftly past them. He was confident he could deduce the correct vehicle while the others brought their case and returned the ridiculous trolley.
Mycroft looked about to argue, but apparently thought better of it. “Andrea and Basil will be leading the team sent to the first, fifth and seventh locations, to start. Keep us up to date on your progress and we shall endeavor to do the same.”
There was a long pause, which Bluebell suspected was processing of data Sherlock rarely indulged in letting go through his mind. His barriers were likely set a very long time ago, and maintained as a second nature at this point. They were more fragile right now, but still… not something he’d likely want to comment on.
“Thank you for being patient with her. This is Maddie and Estrelle, or Mads and Strel as they prefer.” The woman introduced the twins. Strel was still glaring and wary, but she'd moved closer to the large figure curled in the corner to hide behind now. “I am Gigi, the quiet one does not speak English but I think his name is Gord, the cat is Faas, and the fellow in the corner is just called Colonel. They haven't shedded since I've known them, and mostly they just sleep.”
Not waiting for a reply, and with it some sort of argument, John marched from the bathroom. He unrolled his sleeves as he traversed the hall to their room. At this point, it was somehow assumed they would share, but they’d never discussed things after
“What are we doing today?” John rubbed his circled eyes and poured himself a third cup of the strong black beverage.
“No, you disallowed me from bringing mine because we were supposed to be here to work on my shifting issue and Bluebell’s recovery and not research or cases. As you put it.”
“Yeah.” Kirsty agreed, looking at a frustrated Bluebell. The woman pushed her hair back from her forehead. “I wanna have Bluebell
“And you’ve obviously been ignoring fae as long as you could see them, or written them off as fantasy. Now you haven’t any idea how to go about it properly, evidenced by how easily they’ve provoked your fae instincts and nearly spirited you away.”
The man before them was blond, with a scar over one green eye. He was well and simply dressed, and he held a microphone under one arm to leave free his hands. John scowled. He knew exactly who this was.
’ He thought, putting a hand to John’s forehead. He was feverish, though not enough to panic over. “We’re not remotely safe yet.” He spoke softly, eyes scanning for anything new, any injuries he hadn’t witnessed.
If Sherlock thought the distinction between taking them off and replacing them odd, he didn't say it. He just used the same care to slide both legs in and tug them up. As he got them over John’s upper thighs, he used one hand to hold them there while offering the other.
to love and be loved.” He let the music settle so he could hear John hum assent. “Who, then… someone Sight-less but who knows and accepts you as you are.” The music picked up, setting a feeling of anticipation into the space. “Who could you feel comfortable around, enough to share this secret and allow them to keep close regardless?” John raised his head at the behest of the violin as it picked up speed until the strings vibrated visibly. “Who, indeed, would love a werewolf?”
About two hours later, things were calming down. After the discovery the bogle and butler were both gone, speculation had been wild. There were whispers and shouts of him feeding the girl to the bogle, or her just screwing up and it taking her and then butler freeing the creature out of guilt so he could punish himself. There was no proof of anything, other than the torn up dress (apparently Strel had expressed her feelings for it while changing), the shattered orb, and the absence of three of the household’s ‘belongings’.
"Oh... you're good. When I die they won't get much, my kids" he explained. " Not a lot of money in driving cabs."
"John would be fine. My own doctors gonna take care of him." A tall man with umbrella shown up. He smelled familiar to Sherlock's nose. His own blood, his brother. He can trust him. "But now it's important to take them to their nest. John to recover and Sherlock to calm down. If you'll excuse us..."
He kept his lips tight, walking behind Sherlock. He was using his cane again now they could set a reasonable pace. Sherlock, whether cognizant of the stress on John’s leg or just deep in thought, wasn’t travelling very quickly.
Bluebell seemed to be done, so John gave her some water to see if that would stay down. “I don’t think there’s one within a very large area from us. Not even the morgue had much in the way of equipment. It was mostly a giant freezer for storing bodies until they could be picked up by the closest city. I meant it, we’re really not here to work cases. I agreed because I thought it’d be good for you.” John looked up at his detective’s back, a swell of sadness bubbling up in him. “I’m not sure I still think that.”
John didn’t take his eyes off her. “Sherlock. Could you come in here?” He huffed. This was the last thing he wanted to deal with at the moment… but Sherlock had noticed something already, he would be able to finish this, whatever this was. He put up his hands with a sour face.
Past the burning that encompassed every nerve in his body, past the near inability to think at this point, Sherlock mustered the awareness of anger. He had maybe seconds to make a deal before he lost consciousness and went into shock.
Beside him, where she’d been casting a simple charm with her blackberry, the brunette’s device was interrupted.
John stopped, Something was wrong. He couldn’t think, everything was lulling and foggy. If he really tried, he could still feel the stiffness of his wounded leg, so he let his hand rest directly over the place the bullet had torn through and
Humming sadly as she sipped her tea, Kar shook her head. “Not so. In the eyes of other Shifters, perhaps. But most of us here are Metis or Aboriginal. The government of our country doesn’t care about us past keeping us quiet and out of the way until they need to take more from us.”
After going through the blueprints in his head, Sherlock found his path. He slowly released John and helped him stand, eyes never leaving their enemy.
-Basically the entire chapter is Sherlock being dramatic (aka himself) and Bluebell shaking her head a lot but following along anyway, and annoying him but in a way he's not super used to because it's not from a place of bitterness like most of the people around him who are assholes ANDERSON. There is zero romantic chemistry. And there never will be. This fic will eventually be johnlock. Sherlock still sort of looks at her as a rabbit, which is why he's more fond of her than people.
Finally, John planted his foot and wrenched out of Sherlock’s grasp and turned away, pacing up the road and back. “What…”
With a huff of resignation, Lestrade thinned his lips and furrowed his brow all the same as he turned instead for the door.
“She’s not his niece, obviously.” Sherlock reemerged with an apple he seemed to have nicked from Mrs Hudson’s flat. “She’s on the run from her kidnappers, we can’t go to the police due to her circumstances, and she had no other family than a twin sister we have yet to locate.”
Frowning, Sherlock took the page from John. “How am I supposed to collect any data if all my resources are splattered with false leads? I may as well scrape through the children’s section at the library for all the good research will do.”
Sherlock’s expression ticked a moment before setting back as it was, his eyes flashing. “Did you now?” His reply rumbled out of the depths of his chest, and John felt he’d hit a nerve.
“Lovely to meet you, dear.” Mrs Hudson chimed shortly, taking Bluebell’s hand in two of hers. “Sherlock.” She turned her attention right back at her tenant as she blocked his way up the stairs. He huffed, annoyed.
John has a lot of exploratory thoughts, not least among them 'why is Sherlock better at this than me'. They also sort of vacation in Ireland but not really.
Of course Sherlock could hear him, with the great twitchy ears he currently possessed. Curled on the couch in a ball, unseen under his throw, a couple pillows and his favourite dressing gown (on hand for when he shedded, which had yet to present a discernible pattern), he lay still and attentive. John didn’t seem the sort you'd want to get bad doctor’s news from, given how stern and serious he was while donning the stature of a medical professional.
Bluebell eyed the door. “We’re not getting the others, not just now. There’s just no way with the risks and what we have available to us.” She looked at John, who’d already begun to protest, but Sherlock cut him off first.
John sucked in a breath and sighed. “No. But I’m glad I… got to tell it, at least once. Makes it feel real, you know? It didn’t for so long…”
Andrea waited another moment, tapping on her blackberry. The Bugul-noz reached over and tapped a key now and then, looking as if it were a friend pointing to something missed on the screen. John saw something shoot out of the mobile, making him flinch back, and through the wall out of sight.
She glared. “Are you serious?” She sniffed the air dramatically. “I’ve been searching for months, researching, listening. I know a Shifter has been helping the black market capture us, I know you’ve been at the center of their latest activity, I know that once picked up… no Shifter gets out, not without being allowed to do so. Why would they let you go, if you weren’t involved?”
John rolled on his side as the weight on his chest lifted and vanished, clutching his throat as his body convulsed and he coughed himself raw.
Scrunching his face in thought, John considered her questions. After a moment, he took a drink, put down his cup, and replied, “I can’t say I have any of those things. Actually, it’s sort of the opposite. Between moving around a bunch as a child and being in the army, I’ve never attached myself to physical possessions. I could leave everything and start over without much trouble. It just seems… practical. And I’ve never noticed or had anything pointed out that was odd about my body, besides you know… when I’m a wolf.” He sighed, crossed his arms, and leaned back. “Don’t suppose asking them would be the obvious answer.”
John was a little surprised at his self control. Here was a sublime mystery, totally new and relevant information… and he managed to put that aside. Not permanently, he was totally sure of that. But just for now was enough. “Yes.”
I am fluttery and inspired by all the hits and kudos in the last two days! Feel free to also comment. Love you all!
“Um. Tell me a secret.” He narrowed his eyes, looking at her like a frivolous child. “I mean, a personal secret. Something you don’t like other people to know. I’ll let you see this part of me, if you do something similar.”
“I don’t… they let us go and we came out in a field in the Irish countryside. That’s the best I can do, I don’t know where they kept us. I spoke to your son, but as another prisoner.”
“No. I might’ve agreed with you at one time, but living with Sherlock just… No, it’s way more convenient if he treats me like a grade-schooler because at least he’s sharing his process. The better I get to know him, the less he tell me things. And it’s infuriating, since he does it assuming I’m picking up on everything by this point like he is!” John pounded back his beer and reached to pour himself another.
Mads seemed to either understand or not care she didn't. She mimed the explosion. It tickled. “Did it hurt?” She looked up at him.
It wasn’t long before things were back to whatever the Baker Street lingo for normal is. Notable exceptions included Sherlock’s new cast, which Lestrade explained had been rigged with ink explosives. The sort that banks and shopping centers used. And he said it in such a manner that John considered perhaps the DI had come up with that solution personally.
“Mother told you not to come in here.” Faas faced his brother as he moved around to John and Bluebell. He looked… scared.
see. It wasn’t difficult to identify which people to be wary of, even if he had no Sight. He checked his golden pocket watch. They’d arrived during cocktails, the auction wouldn’t begin for another hour. That was his time limit.
John’s attention was caught by something hissing as soon as Sherlock had addressed their kind; a cat. It looked normal enough. John looked away quickly, but then… Sherlock seemed to see it, too.
“No no, she’s quite lovely. Spirited, definitely. But I have not been able to show her off yet. Come, come.” She put up her hand but stayed sitting. Sherlock didn’t miss a beat, standing and taking her hand delicately to assist her.
The assailant’s face was a red mess of criss-crossing lines, but he was holding Bluebell down with his knee on her head, on the floor. She looked shrewd and wild, spitting and scratching at the dense material which protected her captor's legs.
“I have a working knowledge of anatomy, and of medical practices.” Sherlock finished taking off the gauze and put it aside. Then he looked up at John before peeling off the dressing, slowly. His discerning eyes flicked over the spread of dried blood on the unmarried skin around the entry wound, the careful stitching (just two in all) still holding the torn skin closed… “Wait a moment.”
John watched him carefully as he tucked his hands together behind his back and moved into his bedroom. He left the door open. “You don’t think that’s what it is, though.”
John caught the flicker of white sailing over the rail into another enclosure. This might actually work. Moriarty was clever enough to not have cameras, which can
“So me and my new mates, we went everywhere the next few days. Harry tried to keep me nearby, in the cabin or with our parents. Everyone thought she was being silly, which drove her mad.
“I am sorry I assumed.” John said, feeling awkward and embarrassed. He took the ‘canotila’ to be some sort of fae. “Do you have any idea why it is they like me? I run into that almost anywhere I go where Neighbors are. They often ask me to leave this world to come to their own.”
Reaching into all of this was very upsetting to John, who had long since left it all behind. He watched Sherlock, who paced the kitchen as he placed an order over the phone. He insisted on always doing it himself, even when he wasn’t eating. Unless he wasn’t paying attention, and then he just passive aggressively sulked around or pointed out some mistake, related or not, John had recently made.
Not paying attention overly, Sherlock was doing calculations (John could tell by the way his eyes flitted over things) of the 15 foot fence and their other immediate surroundings. The moss was so thick here even with the small slats between each stone, you couldn’t see past it.
It seemed to work, somewhat, and Sherlock took a moment before relaxing. John could be patient, and it seemed less like surrendering in that light. “He wanted this.” He soured. He wasn’t making excuses. His hand itched to touch, to get reassurance in the terrible wake of his broken promise. John seemed rather aloof, even though he had come to retrieve him from Ireland. Was he only staying to care for Bluebell?
“I’m fine, thanks.” John mumbled, taking out his torch and clicking it on as the light faded. Sherlock followed suit.
“I said something foolish…” Sherlock said, not looking away from the top of the stairs where John had disappeared.
“A point, Inspector?” Sherlock put the bones down and stood tall, looking down his nose at Lestrade.
“Yeah and how is Clara by the way? She’s always been the one to stop you coming after me to yell ignorant shit in my face.”
So they walked the small distance down the road from the station to a small bed and breakfast, John taking in the charm of the little hamlet, and Sherlock walking too damn fast while ignoring it all. John didn’t fix his pace to keep up, if Sherlock wanted to race around he was free to do so.
“Sherlock oh my god,” John stood, his chair scraping against the floor as it was pushed suddenly backwards. “Why would you do that?!”
John watched, though Sherlock’s face revealed nothing of his inner thoughts other than they were unpleasant. But he didn’t push or ask for clarification. It would come.
John raised his brow a bit and smiled. “Isn’t it?” He glanced at the window again, things familiar now. “Now, if you’ll excuse us.” He helped Sherlock up and out, only to be brushed off. Before John could exit behind him, something hooked around his supporting arm. It didn’t take much of a tug to pull him down onto the seat again.
“That was hardly the most interesting thing to happen that evening.” A woman in a kitsune mask huffed. “I suppose you were off making your bargain and completely missed it.”
Bluebell cleared her throat and John, having forgotten she was there, pushed Sherlock back to his own damn side of the bench.
The night of the party, which was a masquerade, John highly suspected Sherlock’s choice of costume for him. Likely he was taking advantage of the situation, because only for something this important would John be caught dead in this.
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
Between the mother being allowed, after a week, to hold her baby and Bob sitting Jack down nearby to have a chat, they were able to slip out without more bawling or thanks.
Sherlock tugged minutely on John’s sleeve. “I think we can let them sort it out from here.” He nodded towards the door.
“It’s no wonder,” John said quietly as he scooped her out of Sherlock’s lap, “she’s been under so much stress. You should have seen…” He stopped. He didn’t want to talk about the dollhouse.
Sorry for the delay, I have been very caught up. No promises about next chapter but it's been started. Should be a longer chapter as it's a case fic chapter. Hope you're as excited about it as I am!
John himself was pleasant enough, especially considering he’d been the one to have to contact Mycroft about a favor…
“No. From what I’m given to understand, that would be very difficult to do once, let alone on an ongoing basis. Also if she has a familiar with her, what reason would she have to not use it.”
Having to clean up seemed somehow beyond Sherlock’s abilities at the moment. Something held his attention and it wasn’t the feeling of yolks in his shoes.
John stood and approached, watching carefully. He could see the object more clearly; a glass orb. He couldn’t make out what was in it before the butler turned to lead him out of the main area, down narrow steps that were obvious for servants only, and out a back way to the garden they’d stood at the opposite end of the night before.
Miss me? Damn but this is a long chapter, and as much as I wanna skip ahead sometimes... I gotta lay the groundwork first. If it helps, Chapter 17 (or what at this point will be chapter 21) is almost entirely written. So that'll go up quickly following A Drama in Four Acts.
Andrea stepped forward, her heels clicking like a defined metronome, and the familiar (Basil apparently) reached out with its surprisingly long arm and took the pouch. John wondered what that looked like to the Holmes’, who were Sight-less.
“Yeah, uh…” Lestrade rubbed the back of his neck with one hand. “Like I said, meant to give it over earlier, but the elder Holmes indicated it shouldn’t be given unless you complied with certain… restrictions. It’s not… I know you expect more from me…”
"It's a nice quite spot for a murder." Explained the cabbie. They went in. "Shall we talk?" He take a seat, and Sherlock sat down in front of him.
It all slowed down as John shedded, slumping forwards and catching himself as Sherlock swung his coat off and in one movement had it around John’s pale, boney shoulders. He placed his hands on the shoulders, unconvinced they’d stay where they were, that
Hollow eyes devoid of recognition stared at him, a dumb grin sliding along her face. “Looked so soft…” She muttered as her hand slowly fell down his ear and off.
Crouching, the trap door barely open, Sherlock watched people walk briskly back and forth in front of his line of sight, chattering at one another or themselves. All busy, with purpose… if he hadn’t any context, he might have thought they were actually preparing for a performance, just ordinary stage hands before the show.
’ before he stopped himself. There were plenty of things Sherlock could explain, that John thought previously were impossible. He couldn’t stop himself from a pained smile when he thought how perky the detective got when he was asked for clarification outright, given an excuse to show off. Was he alive? Was he still stuck in the middle of Dartmoor under a rental? John pinched the bridge of his nose and inhaled sharply through it. Then he let his hand and expression fall to neutral.
John sighed and crumpled another paper off the pad, throwing it into the pond. He’d been able to shed once he woke up and get his clothes back on.
Seeming to come to his conclusions, Sherlock turned to face John and walked right up until they were almost touching, looking down at him; stoic, unreadable.
Sherlock looked at him affectionately, huffing out the last of his exasperation. He stood carefully, taking John’s cane and handing it to him. Then he helped the cane help him stand. “Come on. If we are very, very fortunate… we can still catch the ferry back and take the midnight flight from Siglufjordur to London.”
“I’d watch what I was saying more carefully if I were you, Mr Blythe.” John huffed, looking down on him. “You’re tied up on the floor.”
John wasn’t much of a fan of this new fame, but he supposed most everyone on this case would recognize him. “You can’t buy people, Mr Blythe.”
“You don’t understand what you’re asking, Mr Holmes. This process is very intimate, it’ll leave me extremely vulnerable. You of all people should understand the desire to keep your walls up.”
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
“Anyway…” John regaining the attention of the room, “I’d like to also thank you, now that we have a sober moment.”
John laid his head back, too full of warm Thai food to get angry. Instead he just felt… exposed. “I dunno. I got sacked, I was too busy with cases and the blog for her… she put up with a lot, though, more than probably she should have had to.”
As he carefully began to open the door to peek, it slammed hard against him and threw him back. He managed to stay on his feet, but the knob had hit him in the eye. He blinked, getting it re-orientated as he crouched, adrenaline pumping hard through him.
“Why is this one smaller?” She asked, gently prodding the bullet’s entry wound. Nobody had done that since the last time a doctor who wasn’t him changed the gauze on the original injury.
John looked suspiciously at Sherlock, setting his weight back on his good leg as his arm was getting sore. “What are you doing?”
When they finally arrived in Toffen, a small settlement south of Bern, Switzerland, John had finally just turned off his mobile’s alerts. He’d only brought a small case as Sherlock insisted they wouldn’t be there longer than two days. Sherlock had no luggage. John didn’t ask.
“Left behind. You’ve already told me. You think I will leave you behind, or not allow you to work with me. But even if you can’t follow me, there are things you can do to be part of my work. I can’t do it, not nearly as well, without you. ‘Incandescent’, I believe was the term I used before.”
The rabbit-shift took up her cup and felt the warmth through the ceramic just as real as the tenderness from this odd woman. “Someone very special gave it to me.”
“Well typically…” Bluebell was explaining the real reason the circle at the crime scene was unused as Sherlock unlocked Baker Street and swung open the door. He didn’t hold it open for her, but he fought the urge to slam it in her face and prevent an interloper to follow him in the place John should be. “... in order to tap into the forces necessary to bend physics, which is all magic is, you need to be connected enough to the fae to see them. Humans-”
“Jesus…” John gripped his cup. His worries about human vs fae seemed goddamn petty now. He had no clue what to say. He’d learned a little about the similar situation in Australia with their indigenous population in school, but only in passing. Without being involved, it left his mind. And he knew his culture was directly responsible.
intimidating and insane. As the others fooled around, likely with minimal instruction from the leader, they were in the process of making this.” She indicated the circle. “It was sketched in a particular kind of ink, then covered over to hide its legitimacy as a ritual. Which, by the way, was never performed.”
“I moved around a bit, I think. Plain toast and tea. Talking to… I dunno, Sherlock maybe? Then… some kid, He gave me something else, like a candy or something…”
“Yeah? I guess that includes me now, too, doesn’t it?” John retorted in a low, dark tone. He put aside the bloody wipes and took out his gauze and tape, lifting Sherlock’s arm so he could wrap it around properly.
“Nothing to be done about it now.” John sighed, putting a hand on his hip and turning his head down. “I’ll deal with it.”
The animal let out a sort of yipe or bark, then deeply frowned. John barely stifled a laugh, getting a more pronounced look of disapproval.
A hand brushing against his ear shook him back to the room, where the greyed image of bony fingers came through his squinted, over sensitive eyes.
Thinking on it a minute as he took the half drunk glass from Bluebell and helping her rest back down, John clicked his tongue. “Definitely not the son, then.”
John huffed, used to Sherlock’s lack of respect for who possessed things between them. “Sherlock, we should look for the ones we have a direct link to. We can’t leave them where they are longer than we need to.”
The village came into view all at once; John thought he’d blinked and it was there. They were already passing several small, homey cottages as the vehicle slowed.
“There’s something else you should see…” Molly pulled on her gloves and carefully moved the raccoon to show it’s back. There was a clear rectangle shaved, clean as the cut on it’s stomach. Carved into the pale pink skin and then expertly stitched back up (during life, if the marks were at all similar to human skin) was one word; SHERLOCK.
John laughed all the same. “Honestly, he wishes. No. Extenuating circumstance. Dunno yet if it’s permanent though that seems likely.” He leaned forward and flicked Lestrade’s cup, making a dull *tink* to remind him it was there.
In the meantime, Faas approached the desk and watched carefully as Sherlock took apart the cube, setting parts aside as samples. “What d’ya need fer lab stuff?”
Still, as John sat between them sipping his coffee, he wondered if he wasn't of a mind to just take Sherlock’s side and hope dismantling the Shifter trade alone was easier than playing referee to two Holmes’. That and thinking back to the offhand comment about the ‘Christmas dinners’ Mycroft has alluded to the second time they'd met. Maybe he should get their actual mother involved, find out if she could handle it any better than he was.
Standing, Sherlock pressed a kiss to his landlady’s crown, eliciting a fond giggle. “Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
“Target secured.” Andrea spoke simply into her radio, watching as her familiar put its arm comfortingly around the terrified Shifter.
reminded him of what the sourpuss expressed towards people who were particularly troublesome according to Holmes standards.
Something ground around him, and shifted. He could hear men and one, no two, women calling instruction and conditions. He pushed them out of his awareness. “You are damn late,” He rasped, finding it grated terribly on his throat and he sounded nothing like himself.
Sherlock moved into the bathroom, waited for John to gargle and spit, then put his hands on each of their foreheads. “Hm. Yes. Higher than your average. Likely a side-effect of the Oxycontin, nothing serious. Still.” He backed up to catch John’s eye. He was still not really reacting, which made the detective uncomfortable. Pliable John wasn't natural. “My bed. I'll fetch your pajamas.”
Seeing rather than hearing the smirk from Sherlock’s reply reassured John, “I see you’re not entirely a lost cause when it comes to deductions, John.”
He moaned loudly, frustrated. His brain felt like it was in a taffy pull, stretched and rolled over and over. If Mrs Hudson could deduce him so easily, he was in a dire state indeed.
with superiority, “seems coming to your senses wasn't overly much to covet after, Doctor Watson. Clarify it for me, if you would.”
-Bluebell gives Lestrade the name of an occult book as a lead and proves she actually knows what she's doing
It hadn’t been as long a walk as John would have thought, though part of it he had to carry Sherlock’s clothes and wait out in the brush (what little of it there was) before continuing. When they reached the next town (jumping the fence, Sherlock had admitted, was unnecessary. Just faster.), Sherlock went into the local grocery first thing and flipped through more papers, buying a few and leaving the rest. All the ones he’d chosen were very local.
Sherlock looked over at Bluebell, who was stone faced and returned the gaze with a small shake of her head. Sherlock breathed. She’d confirmed these were not Shifters.
Sherlock curled his lips into a grin. He’d stopped fighting and now John was just holding his wrists. “As you have attested multiple times, I have a thick skull. I was dazed briefly and by back aches, but I am fairly certain I have no concussion nor any other serious injury.”
“I told Kelley I didn’t want this, I’d be fine here.” Blythe mumbled. “She was supposed to be a bodyguard, alright? But I wasn’t going to train her, I guess my brother thought she could fight already. I don’t know. I just wanted to be left alone.”
"Tell him! Tell him the truth! It's over now." Said Moriarty. Sherlock radiated with rage. "Don't touch me!"
"It wasn't me. It was my alpha. And sorry if I do not find pleasure in a sight of an aging man bare, wounded body."
"You are much more than just your brain. You groomed John like a good mate. You took him to your own bed, take his clothes off, take your clothes off, and warmed him with your own naked body all night." Sherlock was poppy red. It wasn't enough he didn't remembered any of this, his brother witnessed his actions. "I know you don't want my advice, but you should let your alpha to do few things it wants, in return, it won't take the lead. It's compromise."
"Sherlock?" John reached out his hand toward him, but the detective pulled back, before he could touch him.
Suddenly from the nothing a gunshot roared. Sherlock dropped the pill, and the cabbie fell to the ground. The detective looked out from the window, where from the shot came, but saw nothing. He went for the murderer.
"I made the right thing. Why are you angry?" He frowned." It's about him, isn't it? You put me in the corner because of him!"
John sighed. He will call Mycroft later. Sherlock turned back the duvet. John pressed himself close to Sherlock, he knew it calms him down. The alpha immediately wrapped his arms around his form. John started to stroke his back.
Sherlock inhaled deep breaths, his alpha upset him. He wanted to shout, shooting to the wall, wrecking something, but John would be angry.
Sherlock-from hour to hour-felt worse and worse. Mrs. Hudson left the flat. Sherlock can's stand anyone in the flat, expect John. He sat on his armchair, his head clenched between his hands. He was sweating bullets, hyperventilated. Distress was in the air.
John only perceived the screams and howls, the death rattles. He saw The Woman ran to the safe, punched the code and take out her phone, then run away through the window. When the doctor dared to look up, the room looked like a battle field in Afghanistan. Blood and dead bodies everywhere.
"You are a doctor." A deep voice interrupted him. "In fact, you are an army doctor." Sherlock stood in the door.
"I'm so sorry!" He babbled perplexedly. "He hired me." Pointed to Sherlock." I needed money, I'm an actor..."
"Do you know what I love?"  The detective asked as he peppered John's whole face with kisses. "Your nose! So cute."
The corner of the detective's lips curled up. He let John to wash his hair with pure satisfaction. When Dr Watson wrapped him in a towel, Sherlock catched his hand and looked into his eyes seriously.
"No." Mike made a wondering face, but didn't pushed further. "You know I was in the army. What's new with you?"
"I got you a present! It was al because of this." A door opened and Sherlock's greatest shock, John walked in.
"You know, what I mean. That idiot ruined everything! You left! It wouldn't happened if I were with you!" The alpha was angry.
Lestrade came to arrest him. John was apparently nervous. He punched the chief inspector on the face so hard, his nose started to bleed. Sherlock was proud. They ran hand by hand as fugitives from the police. The newspapers were full of with false accusations: Sherlock : The socking truth, Close friend Richard Brook tells all. Exclusive from Kitty Riley. Who the hell is Richard Brook? Only one person knew the answer: Kitty Riley.
Mixed blood and saliva was important during mating, it wasn't the same, but near thing. Loophole. Bloody alpha!
"Of course I know. You're the one who chooses. Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one. I wont cheat, it's your choice. I'll take whatever pill you don't."
"I don't know how to do a relationship, John." Sherlock said quietly. He saw John's naked form was covered with love bites, his alpha took advantage on his blogger, and Sherlock himself didn't even remembered it. It made him mad.
Few weeks later he visited Sherlock's grave with Mrs. Hudson. Her eyes watered while John only stared numbly.
"No. I'm done with you" answered Irene as stopped in front of the older Holmes. "You know I have so much more on my phone outside of compromise pictures, so much more. I have few demands, to not use them against your superiors."
"I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud." And my alpha is calmer, when you are around.
"I'm a fake." Sherlock lips trembled. He never wanted John thinking him this way. He wanted John would be proud of him. Tears rolled from his eyes. His alpha cried too.
"I hope you had the right reason to drag me back here Mycroft, or I swear..." his voice faded, when he saw the older Holmes's worried expression. "Where is Sherlock?"
John was sitting naked on the toilet. Sherlock didn't tolerated clothes. They were unclad all day. Sherlock was  unbelievably clingy. He followed John everywhere.
John tilted back his head over Sherlock's shoulder. The detective's hands touched John everywhere. He stroked his ribs, massaged John's nipples with his thumb.
What riding crop? Is this guy some kind of pervert? John screamed inside. He is gonna kill Mike for this. He don't want a flatmate. He don't even wanna move out his actual flat. What is Mike planning in his head?
"I'm a consulting detective." John never heard about consulting detectives before. "Only one in the world, I invented the job." He sound proud.
"I'm serious! I want to be with you this time. I want to remember... the smell of you, your touches and kisses, your face when I am inside you. I want to feel everything."
John used his room, his bed. It filled Sherlock with satisfaction. It meant something. Maybe he has a chance to make things right.
"Finally we are here. Only you and me, Sherlock. And the final big problem. Staying alive. Sooo boring, don't you think? All my life I hunted for great games, and you were fun. But now you are not entertaining me anymore, cause I defeated you. And you know what? It was child's play. Now I can go back to the ordinary people, and you are one of them as I found."
"So this is what bothers you. In my opinion you don't have to worry." Sherlock looked at him questioningly. " Don't you think your alpha doesn't presenting because it don't feel necessary to control you? Because now you want the same."
Suddenly John found himself on all fours again. Sherlock desperately rutted against him as he felt the pleasure building inside. His trusts were so deep, John felt Sherlock's balls slapped against his thighs.
Sherlock was so serious, John frowned. The detective didn't know where to start, but he saw from the features of the doctor, he demands answers.
He couldn't wait for John to make the first step. He got closer and hugged him. He smelled John's hair. It turned to grey a little, reminding Sherlock of the wasted time. He felt John sniffed into his neck before he wrapped out of his embrace.
"I've been thinking about you the whole time. That kept me alive. The thought I can come back to you, that I can be with you."
"Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. It could have been a seizure. Possibly drugs."
God, his head hurts. His alpha wanted took control again to go back to John. John is safe, he reminds himself. John is safe and fine, sleeping in his bed.
"Losing it, in fact." They argued. It turned out, Mycroft Holmes occupied a minor position in the British Government.
Mycroft would never risked John's wellbeing of course, but he also would never let his little brother be unhappy because of a beta woman.
"It never will be. You close yourself from the whole world. You are depressed again. I know an excellent therapist..."
"You know, I had a plan, a brilliant a plan... " Mycroft walked out from the shadow. "...about a terror attack without victims. But one lonely, naive man, desperately to show of and a woman clever enough to make him feel special were enough to destroy this plan."
John found himself tangled with Sherlock when he woke up. Sherlock was on his back, John upper body lay on him, his arms were around the detective, his nose in the detective's neck . Yesterday night he didn't payed attention, but now he felt how thin was Sherlock, thinner then before. The doctor stroked the ribs. Sherlock twitched a little, still asleep. John looked carefully under his shirt, and saw bruises, they  did not come from him. Moriarty's men must have caught and tortured him. He wasn't only beaten, he had cuts and burn injuries. His body was still sensitive, is spite of that he let John to beat him and thanks to the doctor, the face of the genius was also swollen. Sherlock's eyes suddenly were open. John moved away from him and got away from the bed.
They went to a nice little Italian restaurant, sat at the table next to a window, where from Sherlock could keep an eye on 22 Northumberland Street. The detective was sure, the murderer would show up again, 'cause he needs audience, applause... He haunts in the middle of the city. His victims disappeared from busy streets, but nobody saw them go. Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?
"Mrs Hudson, the landlady given me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out."
"Shhh!" A cold nose touched his face, it smelled his hairline.  A tongue licked blood from his temple. A cheek rubbed to his.
"I didn't rejected him. We are not a couple, he don't wants me. Call an ambulance. Now!" John was desperate.
John's eyes widened. Sherlock caught hold of the back of John's head and smashed their lips together. He acknowledged with satisfaction that his omega snuggled obediently to him. John put an arm around his neck and kissed the soul out from his idiotic lover. The fog started to got out of Sherlock's brain, when he felt John's chest shaking.
"The name is Sherlock Holmes and the adress is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon." He left, and John only could stare at Mike, who just smiled.
"You are so ordinary, really. She gave you a puzzle and watched you spinning. How quick you figured the e-mail out for her?"
John giggled again, and Sherlock growled a little, because he found it offensive, but then his lover gripped his penis gently.
There will be what will be, decided John. He reached out for the strawberry flavoured lube on the bedside table. They bought it together in the Tesco. Sherlock watched as John poured a lube on his fingers and he started to finger himself. The alpha disliked it. It was his duty. Take care of his omega. He growled.
He was definitely not okay. He even smoked a cigarette. Didn't talked. Composed lethargic sonatas. He's grieved. It was unusual. John was helpless. Mycroft told him, he has to stay with him. John doubted it helps. He also saw that photos. Irene Adler was breath taking. Also very smart. A true match for Sherlock, John thought sadly. Yes, Sherlock liked her. Maybe it was more. He felt jealousy. He broke up with Sarah with reason. Of course he didn't dared to hope, despite of Sherlock's alpha showed courting behaviour towards him. Sherlock clearly told John, he separates himself from his alpha's want. He avoided him for a while after the incident. John was old, average, boring. He sighed.
Sherlock couldn't finish the sentence, because John grabbed his collar and pulled Sherlock's face to his.
He only wished it would've been Mycroft who he met. Irene Adler even in her restrained clothing were beautiful with her long eyelashes and blood red lips. John felt the ground run out under his feet.
John gathered his clothes he planned to wear today, he wanted to get ready to work. He wanted to take a shower and have breakfast. Alone... Sherlock understood the hint. It's time to him to go away.
"I want all of you, Sherlock. But it's impossible, because you make it difficult! My intention is clear. What is yours?"
John wanted to hit him, but he was too exhausted and relaxed from their lovemaking. Sherlock kissed him once more. It was soft, gentle, sensual.
Sherlock raised his head. John seemed to be sure of their relationship. It was good. It was very good. Sherlock was satisfied. He laid John back between the pillows.
"It doesn't happen for no reason." John insisted. "It can help you get in touch with your lost alpha part and bringing me into a full heat."
"The genius detective is only a cheater. I read in the newspaper, then it's true. I love the journalism."
"Are you serious?" He glanced the bouquet of rose in Sherlock's hand. "I agreed to the dinner, but it's not a date." John cleared the situation while he stepped back to the flat to put the roses into a vase.
"What would you like me to make him say next?" He opened the parka he worn to show the detective the bombs under it.
The American ambassador's children were kidnapped. He wanted Sherlock on the case. The game began. Only it was Moriarty's game. When they finally found the children, one of them screamed like hell when she saw Sherlock. Like she knew him as her kidnapper. Soon also the Yard started to think Sherlock got something to do with it.
"You were the little bird, weren't you?" John realised suddenly. " You told Mike Stamford to introduce me to Sherlock."
"My key can open any door anywhere. A few tiny lines of computer code. The man with the key is king, and honey you should see me in a crown." Moriarty straightened himself like a peacock.
Sherlock stroked his scalp with his fingertips, he went on his back down to the bottom. John's mouth was shut hard, he waited to the penetration. He was dry. It won't do any good. Than he felt a gentle tongue licked into his hole.
"What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here." The cabbie pulled out a gun under the table.
"Your smell... very interesting. I also smell Sherlock's on you, but it can't covers yours. Your recovery is a miracle. Maybe you two destined be together."
He obeyed. He was scared. Sherlock was inexperienced. Of course, the alpha side helped a lot for his owner with instincts, but a virgin, exited alpha wasn't supposed to be a gentle lover.
"Clearly. Well, this has been very interesting. I look forward to the court case." Sherlock got up, ready to go.
For a moment Sherlock didn't even had a clue what offer he mentioned. He was too busy with the feeling that John's hand caused.
"No, there's something else. You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your children."
"I'm glad no one saw that. You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might talk."
Sherlock didn't gave her phone back, so one average day, when they arrived home, they found a sleeping Irene Adler in the genius's bed. John sucked a harsh breath but didn't say anything.
Since he was dated with Mary he could almost forgot Sherlock. Sometimes it felt like cheating. But Sherlock was dead, and it was time to move on.
"Here, use mine." The short man offered his own. That was Sherlock wanted. The man came closer, and gave Sherlock his phone.
"I need you to send a text from your phone, my number is recognisable, it's on the website. on my desk there's a number. Enter it in your phone." With a sight, John started to typing. "These words exactly: What happened is Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland Street, please come. Type and send it quickly." He stood and put up a pink suitcase on a chair.
"Actually you can't." Sherlock smirked. "I read after it in the Alpha-Omega courting etiquette lexicon. You can refuse me, but can't forbid the courtship."
"I saw men die before, good men, friends of mine. Thought I would never sleep again. I would sleep fine tonight." Sherlock watched John intense. "You were going to take the damn pill, weren't you?"
"I know I can't trust her. So, Mr. Holmes, will you just do me a favour? Or I count three, and Mr. Archer would shoot Dr Watson."
Sherlock was adamant. In return he ate and drank everything, the doctor put in front of him. He took every opportunity to hug John close, to pet and kiss him. It was annoying. Was it? The alpha was especially romantic, so different from Sherlock's logical side.
They chased the taxi through half of the city and when caught it, found out, they run after the wrong taxi all the time.
Sherlock gave no signal from himself for more than two weeks. John missed him, however he was the one who asked more time and space to be alone for thinking. He didn't go much with it. He was still angry, at the same time he felt warmness and regret for him. Deep inside John knew Sherlock suffered the same way as him. There was nothing left but the terrible, aching loss.
John was uncertain. He dreamt several times Sherlock came back to him alive, and the awakening was always painful.
"Because I was terrified! I was terrified my feelings will take place my intellect. I was terrified you will be disappointed in me one day, and leave for another, because I'm not a real alpha, not a good alpha. I didn't know how to make an omega happy, how to make you happy. I only know I want to be the one for you."
"A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer would panic." Sherlock jumped up and took his coat.
"I'm not crying, I'm typing and this stupid bitch is reading it out. You have 12 hours to solve the puzzle Sherlock or I will be naughty."
"It had temper tantrums all the time. It constantly protested against leaving John. Couldn't bear the idea never see him again." SH
The doctor was sure the man was waiting for him to take the firs step. So he went there and slowly snuggled up to Sherlock. He scented John immediately.
John was confused. Mary quit her job and left, not only the job but also the city. She wrote a letter to John.
It was all so sudden. Mary loved her, didn't she? They wanted to move together. What the hell happened?
"The MI6 would place Sherlock in East-Europe, such a secret mission which in Sherlock would die within half a year. Do you really suppose from me I wish my own brother's death?"
His alpha chest rumbled with joy. He pulled John's hip up so he could touched his cock. He pulled it firmly at the same time he was tender. John moans were loader. It excited his alpha further. He slipped his penis between his omega's arse cheeks, rutted rhythmically while bite angry kisses at his neck.
"I wanted to protect you, not to risk your life. I had to finish Moriarty's men off, so I can guaranty our safety. If I had died, you could going on with your life, as you did." Sherlock's voice cut like a blade, the acid in his voice was unmistakable.
"What the hell I am doing here?" John asked himself. He stood before 221B Baker Street. The area seemed nice and the flat itself looked good from outside, but he originally didn't planned move out his previous place. "And now here I am."
John wondered it's just some kind of manipulation from Mycroft, to keep him with his brother, but what if it's really important? What if Sherlock is in danger or took drugs again?  He got in the black car.
"You could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational." Sherlock's heart warmed a bit at John's outburst, but he just silenced the doctor.
In that moment it was a big show for John. Sherlock knew Moriarty wanted to uncertain his friend, his mate, his omega. It would broke him, if John would left, because he believed what Jim Moriarty told him.
"I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
John saw Sherlock from the window. He called Jennifer Wilson's phone, but nobody picked up. He tried to search it it with the laptop. Lestrade didn't understood why the detective leaved, he felt Sherlock let him down, so he left the flat with his people.
He took Sherlock's hand and led him into the bedroom. Sherlock looked dazed, like he caught a heavy flu. He let John to help get rid of his clothes.
"Don't! Look, I don't say no to the sex. But no mating!" Sherlock growled. "Please! Alpha..."John licked his alpha's chin, he hoped with a little submissive act he can convince him. The tightness on his wrists eased.
Soon John was also able to smell. He was aware the person by it's odour. Mrs. Hudson smelled like lavender, Molly like cherry blossom. Greg's scent was similar to gunpowder, very different from Mycroft's ink and chocolate cake aura. But none of them was as pleasant for John as Sherlock's fresh, wood after rain smell. John liked this scent on himself, and Sherlock usually scented him, but it was more his alpha's act, like the detective's. He returned to his cases. So John found himself on a crime scene. Triple homicide. Sherlock seemed exited, he clearly missed the work. Lestrade stood by John.
Sherlock longed for this moment for a long time. He buried his nose in John's hair as he enjoyed the heat flowing from his body.
"Rachel is not a name. On the luggage, there's a label. E-mail address." Sherlock sat in front of a laptop. "She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone. A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled. So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address and all together the password is... Rachel. She used smartphone, it has GPS. Which means, if you loose it, you can locate it online. She's leading us directly to the man who killed her."
John's head was on Sherlock's chest. He wanted to hear his heartbeat, to know he is still alive. His skin seemed warmer, but he was still motionless. John thoughts whirled around his gun. It was in his suitcase. He didn't thought about it since he met with Sherlock. But if Sherlock die...
John tried to follow the events, and got interested about the case, became disappointed to left behind. How could be useful? Meanwhile Mrs. Hudson kept chirping.
Suddenly Mike Stamford walked in the door, and a short, blond man limped after him. His smell was neutral. Interesting.
"Congratulations, Dr Watson!" He read the letter. "Or may I call you brother-in-law? Unfortunately Sherlock's sex education is very incomplete, but don't worry. His alpha knows exactly what to do. ;)"
"You did it together." John stroked the detective's raven black hair with adoration. "However I had no heat since I joined the army, if our bonding would not be possible, my recovery would not have been possible."
"I want to solve the problem. Our final problem. It's gonna start very soon Sherlock. The fall. But don't be scared. Falling just like flying, except there's a more permanent destination."
"Do you know the big problem with disguise Mr. Holmes? However hard to try it's always a self-portrait."
"You didn't take anything because you don't need to. Nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville prison could possibly match the value of the key you opened all of the places."
"The mess and the noise he made! Body parts in the fridge!" She started to be hysterical. "I go now. Leave you alone with him." She went.
"Come back, Sherlock! Come back to me." He sobbed. His tears run down his cheeks to fall Sherlock's face.
"Don't be obvious. I will kill you someday. I don't go rush it though, I'm saving it up for something special. If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you. I'll burn your heart out of you."
He hold John close and turned them so they lay on their sides. Sherlock put John's legs around his hips and hugged him tight, petting his hair. He waited until John started to rub his groin against his.
"Sherlock. I've got you something." The detective played on his violin, looked out the window. John put his Christmas present to the table. "I know you use mine, but that's old, and I think you can make good use of this one." Sherlock still showed his back at him, so John went to the kitchen to put the kettle on. Soon the violin play fell silent. John wondered Sherlock want to see his present at all. It was ordinary, just like him. Irene would gave him something special... His flatmate walked in and stopped next to him.
Irene felt herself in danger without her phone, it was her life. The datas in the phone should be very important. Sherlock can't solve the phone's code, he had to gave it to Ms. Adler to enter in. Irene had a costumer worked for the Military who got an e-mail once, an important one, and she took a picture from it, but she can't found out what is it about. She toughed it was some kind of code. Sherlock took a look for it.
"You all right guys?" Lestrade approached to them. Sherlock growled. John seemed wounded and the genius held him as some kind of treasure. "Oh!" The inspector held up his hands. "It's okay Sherlock, It's just me. I'm bonded remember? Have a wife who cheating on me in your opinion. John needs help. Let the paramedics check on him."
Mycroft intently watched his shoes for a while, but raised his head when John punched his little brother on the face.
Mike probably  wanted to bring him together with this alpha, Sherlock Holmes. Yes, he has to be an alpha. However John didn't smell anyone since the suppressants, every aspect of Holmes shouted he is one of them. He was handsome, but a dickhead as well. John didn't need and alpha patron, but maybe he has a chance for a better life.
Sherlock knew the doctor needs time, but he couldn't hide the growing feeling of belonging in his stomach.
"Sherlock?" John checked Sherlock's fangs, dried blood was still on his lips. The detective was in his alpha state, but he spoke more clearly and John didn't take it as a good sign, still he was relieved. Sherlock is alive. "You have to drink and eat." He tried to sit up, but Sherlock held him down. "Sherlock, I wont leave." He caressed Sherlock's dark hair. " I thought you wanted to be with Irene..."
John shocked again for a moment. He didn't had to thinking on how his jumper got there. He just tried to imagine Sherlock as he sleeping in some dirty place, squeezing his jumper.
"His name is Richard Brook. Moriarty is not real. He never exists." Kitty explained to John as she talked to a confused little kid. "Just look at him! Richard Brook is an actor hired by Sherlock Holmes to play Moriarty."
John woke up from a terrible nightmare. He saw Sherlock in blood again, lifeless. But Sherlock is alive, isn't he? He was there, wasn't he?
"No, look at her hair. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking..." Something got in Sherlock's mind. "Oh... Serial killers, always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake."
"Where is she now?" asked John. Sherlock, who avoided his blogger naked chest's sight, now looked at him.
"I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in higher power. In your case it's yourself." Brilliant, John would say. This woman is stunning. "Somebody loves you. If I had to punch that face I'd avoid your nose and teeth too." Oh, John.
"Shut up! You did enough! Leave me alone!" Sherlock felt he has two different personality, and his alpha was louder as ever.
"It's not your business! If you want to be useful, take Sherlock's stuffs away. Mrs. Hudson don't have space for them."
Life with Sherlock wasn't easy. It's not enough he was messy, he kept a jar of eyeballs in the microwave and a head in the fridge. He manipulated Molly to get body parts from St. Bart's. John also arranged the shopping, he felt himself a housewife. John sometimes fall asleep at work, because Sherlock sent him different places getting information at night to his cases. Sherlock was unbearable, when he got bored, shot into the wall, terrorized Mrs. Hudson, and insulted John. He usually sabotaged the doctor on a date. Watson was even kidnapped by Black Lotus when they confused him with Sherlock Holmes. Despite all this, John stayed. He felt himself important, his life was interesting. He started writing a blog about their cases, however Sherlock offended, when John mentioned, the detective against his brilliant intelligence, he is ignorant in a few things. During their fights, John left to Sarah Sawyer, his so called girlfriend. Sarah was a beta, also a doctor. How dull. John must felt safe with her because of her gender, it wasn't a good excuse he went to dinner with Sarah instead of him.
"Sorry boys! I am so changeable. It's my only weakness. You can't be allowed to continue. You just can't. I would try to convince you, but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind."
"Not much" and here comes the showing off. "She's from out of town. Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff. Dr Watson, what do you think?"
"So you missed our not average life then? That's why you attracted to Mary Morstan. I suppose she brought some excitement to your days."
The lady, named Jennifer Wilson, lay on the wooden floor. He was dressed in pink to the feet. The grey haired inspector, Lestrade provided details about the circumstances of her death. Sherlock closely observed the body.
"Don't try to blackmail me with feelings!" John stood up. "I think you told me everything you wanted. It's time you to go away, or I will."
Sherlock could concentrate on his job again. The doctor closeness and touches totally diverted his instincts to another way which he didn't want to deal with. But now his brain wheels moved in motion. The owner liked his shoes so much, he kept them clean. He suffered from eczema. There are mud on the sole from Sussex, on it sole from London, he knew this from the pollen analyses. So the owner came from Sussex to London, and left them here, but why? What happened with him? Oh... Oh!!! Carl Powers. His first case! A kid came for a swimming competition, he got some attack and drowned. His shoes were missing. These are his shoes! He analysed the shoes further and found clostridium botulinum on the shoelace. It could be in Carl Power's eczema ointment, caused  muscle paralysis while he was in the pool. He solved it! John will be satisfied.
"Would you like a cup of tea?" Sherlock looked at him with an odd expression. "It's Grey's Anatomy, I thought... Doesn't matter. It's only a book." The doctor stared at the floor until Sherlock reached under his chin.
After handing over a piece of thick cardstock with Runic writing on it, Sherlock and his companion were ushered into the luxurious theatre. There were many other people mulling about, some dressed in robes or adorned with odd jewelry, and many others dressed as Sherlock was; in a fine, custom-tailored tux. He hadn’t given up his coat, but he’d allowed Mrs Hudson’s contact to fiddle with his hair. It was slicked back, a plume of his dark curls fluffed around the back of his head above his neck. Bluebell was similarly made up, her hair (now entirely a lush chestnut) pulled back into a crown of braids which met atop her head in a complex bun. She’d been sewn into her gown, which she was about as pleased about as Sherlock had been with his hairdo, but walked well in her tall heels. She itched around her neck where the sapphire collar rested, it reminded her vividly of her time as a test subject… but her face was pleasant and docile.
It was past sun up by the time they finished, and John was about to ring for coffee when there was a soft knock announcing the innkeep had brought their tray.
Watching the cab pull up on the curb, Sherlock leapt out of the chair, pecked Mrs Hudson on the cheek, and was off. After all that time to plan, he knew exactly where he was going. Exactly where he might find an elusive door into Shifter society. He tried, after giving the address, to not dwell on the very frustrating fact he’d not seen the proverbial hide nor hair of all of this before it’d been thrust in his face. Stupid.
“John…” The DI huffed, relief softening the lines on his face. He took two great steps to where the doctor was standing, about to take his teacup to the kitchen for a refill. Lestrade grabbed him unexpectedly, hugging him.
are sold-!” Sherlock started, keeping his voice in check but barely. “We can come back with Mycroft, shut it all down.” He’d nearly forgotten this part, this altruistic stupidity. The stage was beginning to calm, movement…
“Come on, you can sit in my lap the rest of the way, and then we’ll get you a bit of sleep before we leave this place far behind. Okay?” John spoke softly, but Strel glared at him. He figured maybe he shouldn’t speak to her so carefully, she didn’t seem to appreciate it.
“You’re wrong, it’s our best option. Not only for this case, but for every case after. If I’m going to work with you-”
“You could look at it like that.” John offered, grinding the gear shift but managing to continue down the dark country road.
He heard rather than saw John descend the steps a moment later, then sink into his armchair. He rolled his head so he faced out, looking John over carefully as he could. “Problem?”
Rumligen Castle was much more impressive and a great deal less foreboding in the light of day, and by way of the front gate. Less of a castle and more of a very large, very old church, it nevertheless inspired awe.
Lestrade, by comparison, was less composed, and it wasn’t any wonder why. He was holding up his teacup, but staring at the animal hanging upside down by its tail (by the hook that once hosted a suicidal mannequin) as it’s small dexterous paws worked with something pliable he couldn’t make out. “Is it contagious or something?” He asked, half serious.
Through the trees, past where he could see, a most lilting and beautiful song started to flow. He could almost see the notes run languorously around him, and he felt like he was floating in a sun-warmed pool. Everything else fell away but the song and the calm safety it instilled.
“Dammit…” John huffed and pulled off his scarf. “If you don’t clean this up before it dries, it’ll be a nightmare.” Throwing the scarf into the hamper, he sat on the edge of the tub and started the water. He frowned at his fingers as he ran them under the stream to find the right temperature. Things had gone sideways before he could get his head around them. In fact, the last time he could remember feeling solid and sure of himself was… before Baskerville. God, what was his life? He ran his dry hand over his face, shook off the other, and stood. He watched Sherlock’s odd outward display of inward thoughts as he pulled off his jumper rolled up the sleeves of his button-down.
And then the figure peering down at him in the dark was just that; a blob roughly in the shape of a person, all in black save a line around the eyes… the face must be exposed between the hairline and just above the cheeks.
Sherlock wasn’t far behind, his own equipment discarded on the way back in favor of his coat, which he kept on. “Just listen, I can explain it another way.” He tramped after John like a puppy.
“So that was…” Henry stumbled on his tongue as he asked, color just beginning to seep back into his face.
Later that night as he stared at the ceiling and tried to fall asleep, John couldn’t shake the fear of the curse. Sherlock had lied to him before, and quite easily. And of all the myriad of things John would do to keep his home, seeing Sherlock cursed as he was was
"Because you are an idiot." Don't call him that!- something in him growled. John looked offended. "No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is. Now look, what is it missing?"
Sherlock knocked John on the floor in a moment. He grabbed John by the hair, forced him to look into his eyes.
He slowly took his way to the stairs, up to his room. He felt frozen. He just sat on his bed, he felt more lonely than ever.
Victor wanted to Sherlock fight over with other alphas for him. Sherlock said, it's an unnecessary display of power. He rather used his brain. He craved for puzzles, mystery cases. Victor didn't understand him. None of the omegas could. He stopped try to understand with them. When desire started to outgrow him, he tried to rid it with cocaine. It worked... For a while.
"Oh, I'm playing. This is my turn." John would enjoyed this, seeing him brilliant. " There's a photograph of children in your cab. Their mother's been cut out. If she'd died, she'd still be there. The photograph is old, but the frame is new. You think of your children, but you don't get to see them. Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them, it still hurts. Your clothes recently laundered, but everything you're wearing is at least three years old. And you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about? Three years ago. Is that when they told you?"
Sherlock was sure, it has to be somewhere, so he ran out, and asked about it from the others outside.
"You keep me safe. You are brave, honest, loyal. I'm not alone with you. You are my home. My only friend, my everything. My chest feels warm, when you are around." Sherlock slid his finger down on John's shoulder to his old bullet wound.
"Yes. And I can reed you military career in you face and in your leg, and I can tell your gender without a smell of it.
"So he didn't know either." It was a statement so Sherlock didn't answered. "Right, he wasn't an important person in your life either."
"It won't happen. I trust you. As reassurance I remind you, I was a soldier, I could kick your ass anytime."
Sherlock paled. He felt like his heart stopped beating. All the happy lights vanished from his eyes.
"Irene?" The alpha blinked. Seemed he don't remember The Woman at all. "Are you jealous, my John?" He cocked his head. "You are my omega." He licked the tears from John's eyes.
The crease in John’s forehead increased and they bounced over another hole in the road. His crossed arms went down to steady Bluebell. “Great to find that out once we’re already out here.”
“Hm, yes, well…” Mycroft twirled the tip of his umbrella in the dirt, where it poked down to help support his awkward position. “Middle of nowhere as this is…”
“Not really, I’m afraid. She changes frequently, within a half hour most times, and she has trouble remembering she isn’t in a lab.” Mrs Hudson reported before putting a hand to her mouth and gazing down at Bluebell with concern. John put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed gently.
John let his face sag in weary resignation. “But I have it.” Just saying that made his throat threaten to collapse in him and anxiety throb through him. It eased a bit when Sherlock gave him a small smile and a nod. “I will try.” John mumbled under his breath.
John picked up his cane about the middle to carry it as he ran after her. Sherlock kept close behind.
When they finally made their way there and walked around to the front, they saw the figure standing halfway between the cliffs and the lighthouse door. She had been looking out on the ocean, but turned now to face them. The breeze caught her full length coat and threw it around her wildly.
Finally letting go of Faas, who turned to Sherlock (remaining unseen), John took decisive steps (formal at least, though not militant per se) to her and held out a hand. “Miss Kar. Thank you for accepting us into your care.”
Sherlock had shared that their hostess had gone so far as to register the Andean Cat as her exotic animal with the proper authorities, so if they were getting the girl out of the country without incident, it was going to be as a human. That held it’s own set of problems, which Sherlock assured John he’d taken care of. When John asked for details, Sherlock refused, saying the fewer details John had to remember, the less likely it was he’d be caught having to lie. And they hadn’t yet figured out how to handle the bogle.
“Your family aren’t Shifters.” Sherlock asked in his ‘I want to know more about this but I already know this bit’ way.
Sherlock scoffed, not looking up. Blythe had helped him figure out the password, but apparently there was quite a bit of code to go through in order to find the safe release. The one that wouldn’t result in death. “John? I wouldn’t think so, not with a WPM speed of about ten.”
“No, no. What, you’re the expert now?” John snapped. He couldn’t calm down. His chest itched and he wanted to run. ‘
“Come on. We have a lot to do before tomorrow.” Sherlock said instead, turning and going back to his side of the car.
“I’m becoming more restless as the night wears on, Mr Cavendish. I might consider moving up the main event. She is just the most beautiful thing, especially when she changes. I’ve spent days having her do just that, back and forth.” Ms De Mueron sighed dreamily.
John quickly pushed the door shut and sat back against it. He tried to catch his breath, and felt terror and malice through the hard wood that separated him from the horror happening in the hall.
The sun had only just begun to set, casting long shadows around and of them, when John suddenly stopped.
Followed by an angry hissing, a growl. John pulled at his chains, at gravity, at his body’s protest. He let out a threat he didn’t know if he actually articulated or if it was just howling, then there was pain, and then darkness.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he felt John stiffen, unsure of what that meant. He watched John’s eyes widen and follow unseen movement around past the light, and felt an awful twinge. This world he could never access, that John was entrenched in… A place he could not follow.
“Strel.” She answered with a cocky smile. He could see her worry behind it. She must have realized if he had to ask, they hadn’t yet found her sister.
Yeah this is one of five parts of this chapter. Woof. Next update sometime next week unless I get a rush of inspiration this weekend. Next act likely won't be quite this long but I dunno I can ever tell entirely.
“You were out when I left?” John asked as he went to the fridge to grab some water. Somehow they’d come home to a spotless kitchen (though more than half the counter space was still chemistry tools) and a fully stocked fridge. John had yet to find any human remains in it.
Bluebell gave him a look, then gazed out the window. She didn’t much like the city, and soon the green would be all but gone. “Yeah. But unlike you, I know I can be wrong. And I don’t like when people piss all over others who’ve made mistakes. So just tell me and we can skip the dramatics.”
Releasing him out in the hall and blocking reentry, John looked at Leo and tried to fathom how he could be that similar in looks and yet so entirely different in personality.
Looking very proud of himself, hair slicked back, Sherlock wore a flashy suit shirt loose at the collar. It was tucked into ostentatious pinstripe trousers, he had a suit jacket thrown over his shoulder, and he tipped his shades forward on his nose. Even those had some logo John was sure belonged to some prestigious company, but he didn’t pay attention enough to those things to know which.
“Excuse me, this is private property.” A biting, lyrical voice asked behind him. “Is there something I can help you with, Mr…?”
Breath frosting in front of his face always made Lestrade itch for a smoke if he wasn’t engaged in other things. He scratched unconsciously at his arm where he had forgotten to put his patches today and checked his watch. 7:20. He let out a longer breath and looked around. He could guess at Sherlock’s meaning for him being here, but he’d been surprised before. He furrowed his brow as a somewhat familiar face came ‘round the end of the street, headed towards him. The figure stepped under the pub’s front lights and returned the DI’s quizzical look as they placed one another.
“No…” Bluebell sat up straight. “I certainly am not. And I’m not here to find John, not entirely. I’m here to find kidnapped Shifters. There’s been an enormous spike in abductions in our community over the last ten or so years. But as you’ve said, I can’t find them on my own. You can.”
John took a very deep breath, knowing he should ignore it and not engage. But he also knew, from the first ridiculous request he’d performed for Sherlock (come back across London to send a text because I can’t be arsed to get up), that he’d never do that. He turned around to stand in the living room doorway, leaning heavily on his cane due more to fatigue than pain. “How d’you figure that? We had to leave ours in an airport locker just to go somewhere we wanted to
“Put your hands against the back wall and surrender. Comply and you will not be harmed.” The voices from the other side of the door announced.
Following Sherlock’s line of sight as he took off after him, John saw the proprietor briefly as she moved past a window above them. She was high up, running across the room in an enclosed gangway.
Lestrade shook hands and nodded. “Not ‘mates’ exactly, but basically. What brings you out this way?”
Even from the greenhouse sitting room in the Kar family house, shouting carried from the middle of the miniscule town and caught John’s attention. It rang through, bouncing around off the stone and sounding more like barking than yelling. His guts twisted terribly as he pushed himself up, knocking over his teacup but ignoring it as he started in a brisk walk to the door. “Faas, stay here.” He called back even as the teenager jumped down.
With talon-like claws, he raised the mic back to his maw and spoke, his once sweet rugged voice a throaty grating. “A demonstration, a show to break up the tension of bidding.” He said shortly… then he let his arm fall and crushed the microphone in his hand. The reverb made Sherlock flinch, but John doubled over clutching his ears. He gripped the gun tightly while gritting his teeth, trying to regain equilibrium. Everything was ringing again. He managed to make out a dim cry from behind him before something heavy struck him from the front, throwing him back off his feet and rolling over the floor. God, he felt sick. His whole left side throbbed.
John smiled. “Well, excuse me for being suspicious. The last time you were nice, Sarah had to help us fight off Chinese acrobats.”
This unnatural attachment to his live-in army doctor was becoming more of an issue than it was worth… Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. He knew his brother was on a dangerous path when John Watson crossed it, but there must have been better men… he should not have allowed a therianthrope of all people to live with Sherlock. One way or another, those sort complicated things. It shouldn’t have mattered Watson was aggressively denying his innate abilities or that he had no real ties to the underground community.
When John looked up again, the area was empty. The only movement he could see was the silver thing wandering far off. He blinked. He hadn’t seen anything like this before, only in the city were Neighbors sparse.
“Hm. I also don’t stand idle when the people in my company are in chains. Though no…” Sherlock looked over with a blandness in his face, “I am by no means a ‘saint’.”
Mycroft cleared his throat. “Very well, I shall begin then.” He looked sidelong at John and frowned politely, if that's possible. “I am privy to certain knowledge pertaining to the therianthrope community, knowledge neither of your have access to. A pertinent example is what occurs when one such creature denies it’s nature overlong. Doctor Watson seemed to be an exception, but since recent events involving his exposure to the other side, I am no longer confident of that.” He looked at John. “In layman’s terms, I don’t trust you can stay in this form indefinitely anymore, nor that you’re able to control yourself once changed.”
Now, as they sat in the cab and drove towards Heathrow, Sherlock was caught somewhere between sulking and relieved.
Lestrade chuckled and agreed, then left. Neither man saw the scowl Sherlock wore behind the book open an inch from his nose.
John stood up straighter, in the stance that had initially informed Sherlock of his military origins. “I’m
“Hey there Pet.” He said comfortably, a low trill of a purr, as his posture relaxed and he stuck his hands in his pockets. He was like Faas only in outward appearance, that much was obvious.
