"I'm fine, as I believe you can vouch for and I hope you told him as much. I wouldn't have been fine if you were dead. A conclusion he clumsily helped to almost facilitate."
Sherlock whimpered and those sounds John had become all too familiar with began; the low moans, the little gasps and soon enough he felt the detectives warm hand circling his lower back. Due to their spacing, their frenetic movement and the emotion of the situation it wasn't as dextrous as it had been in the past but by God it was getting the job done.
He inhaled deeply and brought the balled up tissue to his eyes."I don't know that I definitely want to live...I just...I don't think I want to die." He paused and covered his face for a moment before speaking from behind his hands "Yes, yes, today, this day, right now, I want to live. ...I don't know about tomorrow"
"Yes, let's." John tried to feel and appear comfortable and casual as he sat in the thin gown on the crinkly butcher's paper.
"I love it, I love it so much and I wish I could taste it and you. I wish I could be in two places at once. Make a mess, my love. Yes, my darling boy, make a mess for me."
"Glad you lads were free and could take her." She said with a grin. "We shouldn't be too late but we'll likely worry you with frequent calls throughout the evening to check on how you're doing. Now you have both our numbers?"
"No, of course, I don't mind. Things were a little up in the air. But I'm all checked out, papers signed, bags packed."
"And I would think you would have the decency not to shoot up in front of me even if you were so inclined. I intend to show the same courtesy. I don't need a drink. John."
"The temperature of the penis is lower and the vacuum pressure may cause the veins to appear distended. There is usually an increase in girth and there may be pivoting."
They hadn't done it so he imagined it now. Kissing those lips, nipping, sucking and biting down his neck. Marking him, finally marking him. Putting his mouth on his chest, more nips, more bites, kissing down his abdomen and finally arriving at his cock. Hard, straight, pre-cum beading on the head. All he knew about blowjobs were some of the stellar ones he'd received. He knew what he liked and what he wanted and he was determined to give that to Sherlock.
"Not the first two, and I've already replied to them. But, yes, the last one was fictional. So, what do you want to do? You are correct, I promised you this day."
In fact, sometimes his life felt so bright, so happy, so ready to burst at the seams he didn't think it could get better.
"Do you like him?" Sherlock asked and she nodded in reply. "And who gave that to you? Who is that?" He said pointing at John who suddenly felt trapped and inadequate in the unexpected spotlight. "Who is that? Remember the pictures I've shown you? Who is that Rosie?"
"We should get some rest, don't you think?" John asked after Sherlock had yawned for the fourth time.
"Open them. No more disconnecting. This is rudimentary, Sherlock. No analysis, no Mind Palace required. Just you and your hand. Watch yourself so you can tell me what you like."
"Thank you." He took a deep breath and began. "After my ill-planned meeting with you and Mary at the restaurant, I went to see Graham."
"No, that's the thing. I'd forgotten about it and by the time that I remembered...well...we had already been in very close quarters. We were already in bed together by then. But the dreams are still there. The last time I thought about it in daylight was..."
"No," Hanah said firmly. "Leave it there. That is the point of this. Not to make admissions and then retract them. You can tell what you believed was the truth and still regret it but it doesn't make it any less true for you. You are an angry person, John. That is something I have been trying to get you to face since day one. Now, whether you are disgusted or content with your past actions you have to face them and acknowledge why they happened. Do you understand that?"
"And with that ringing endorsement you're on salad duty." he said with a laugh. Grabbing Sherlock's hand he linked their fingers and pulled him toward the kitchen.
"It's alright, I'd had practice with that plan. The suicide, I mean. I was going to kill myself awhile after I got back from Afghanistan."
And now he was here, where he'd denied himself that he wanted to be. And he didn't want to wait or hesitate anymore. Without further pause he took him into his mouth and Sherlock, who kept things relatively clean, swore like a longshoremen. An appreciative and complimentary longshoreman at that.
"Relax, Dr. Wason, I'm not going to force anything on you you're not ready for and I'm also not going to subvert your therapists work. You also checked alcoholism."
Fair warning, though; I play the violin when I'm thinking. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential partners should know the worst about each other.
He'd never heard it put so succinctly and still, it made him bristle. It also made him sound like a drama queen something he'd accused Sherlock of on more than one occasion. He wanted to take umbrage at the idea that he enjoyed being trapped in an endless cycle of guilt and forgiveness but he wasn't sure it could stand up to the harsh light of reality.
John smiled and inhaled deeply at the nape of Sherlock's neck. HisÂ thoughts were lost in the happy prospect of forever
"To obliterate myself. To not have to hear people talking to me or at me. To not have to deal with my own thoughts anymore. To be unconscious."
"Mrs. Hudson, I think I can say with complete certainty that he is not back on drugs. I keep a close eye on these things and none of the tell tale behavior is there."
I sat back on my heels, my cock bobbing comically before me. Sherlock was clearly enjoying the attention.
"Yeah, yes, absolutely." He said being both disappointed and confused by the hesitancy he heard in his own voice. Mycroft's words from earlier had come back to him.
"I know." He said simply. "So, after accepting that as a reality I asked Mycroft if there was anything a little dangerous, all-inclusive, time consuming, what have you that I could do. He gave me an assignment, or a half dozen actually."
Rather than handing him the books and loose papers at the last minute she emptied a box and dropped them inside.
"Passion isn't love. Even I know that. What good does passion ever do anyone? Give me that man that is not passion's slave..."
"Yes, she did." Sherlock replied with a smile. "It seems she wants both of us. Come back over here."
She had nodded but not said anything else to that point. They'd continued on with that session and when it had ended he'd gone into the bathroom, crushed the pills under a spoon and snorted them up his nose. He'd never, in his life, snorted
Patrick cleared his throat and John tried not to hold his breath. He affected an easy, confused posture. Concerned but confident. After all, what could someone like the man sitting before Patrick in this moment have to fear? They were equals. They were colleagues.
There was a woman, on a bus. Pretty. She fancied me. I liked her. We've been texting. So I guess I've been cheating on you as well. Haha. My wife goes into the other room and I start texting another woman about how I miss her.
"John you spent two days essentially in a coma and he spent months agonizing over you. I don't think anything is exactly
was looking for a flatshare. I told five people I didn't know of anything but I'd keep an eye out just to get you two together. Last time I play matchmaker, I don't have this kind of patience."
"But you're right this place...this place is a benevolent meat grinder. All of you just gets eviscerated and masticated and packed back together into some sort of meat patty. You get your certificate and you get called human again, but what are you? What are we going to be when this is over. What if by dredging the bottom of who we are, we come out worse?"
John called an Uber and put in the address of the nearest Tesco. He wanted nothing more than to go back to the flat and crawl into bed but more than that he wanted to get this over and done with first. He asked the driver to wait and after dropping off the script took a seat, his eyes wandering to the cheap and awful wine selection to his left. He'd found, and mentioned at his last meeting that sometimes he thought addiction was like a ghost.
"I had no desire to be your project, not then and not now. Despite how much you think it would complete me as a human being."
"Fighting, is that what you call it when he hits a 10-year-old so hard they go flying across the room."
The smiled faded but before any protest could be raised John pulled his mobile from his pocket. "Now I haven't logged in out of respect. But you said you didn't change the password."
"Enough travels and experiences to fill three weeks, I assure you. I'm an excellent travel planner and tour guide."
"Well, there wasn't much more I never knew how to follow it up after you came in my mouth in the cab."
A few steps inside their house he realized he'd forgotten to ask Sherlock just what they knew about his drinking and rehab and-
When they finally crawled into bed it was with happy, tired smiles and brief kisses before sleep claimed them.
His father hadn't wanted this for them, he and Harry. In some ways, taking their personalities into account he had purposefully pitted them against one another. Their own attitudes and bad habits and addictions and personal miseries and secrets had done the rest.
Any debt I owed you is paid in full. And to view a receipt just go to Mary's grave and read her headstone.
"No, Sherlock, you don't have to chase me." He soothed him. "And I like hearing you talk about everything being new like this."
John leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, watching the man before him carefully. Watching the twitch of his mouth, the slight shift of his posture, the way his finger was almost imperceptibly stroking the edge of his plate. To butcher a phrase, his cold stare was writing a cheque that his body couldn't cash.
"John...why do you still wear your wedding ring?" Sherlock asked. And now he had turned to face him, tall and stern, his face a mask of anger and pain. So much hurt and pain that he never let show.
"Sorry, you're breaking up. I'll have to call you back later." He said and endedÂ hisÂ pretend phone call.
"And how about looking after this little dear?" She asked turning her attention to Rosie, her face softening. "You never exactly were the family type."
A few people in the thread mentioned that the story was rather Sherlock-light/Johnlock-light and perhaps too John-centric. I'd never thought of it that way but I suppose it's true. So, because of that, I've added "John-Centric", "John POV" and "Character Study" to the tags. I know certain users are more interested in stories that focus on them one-on-one and if that was something I was looking for I might be a touch disappointed with this one. I know, in addition to this there's some reluctance to start a WIP. I also admit I'm just as wary when it comes to WIP's and tend to avoid them myself. This slow burn is turning out to be a little longer than I anticipated but I'm ok with that if you guys are.
"John, you look positively refreshed!" His mother exclaimed. "Healthy tone, good weight. I'm so glad to see you well."
"Good. Really good. I think it's time to let it go. Long past time. For theÂ longest, I could only think of the bad memories I made there. But I had good ones too. It's not a bad house and it should be filled with people again. My life isn't there anymore and it hasn't been for aÂ good while. My life and future are at Baker Street."
"How do you feel about that? I saw something pass over your face." She said never one to miss a thing.
He felt it happen but his disbelieving mind didn't quite register it even after Sherlock arched away from his touch.
His anniversary came and went. "Mary" had long since gone mute, as she promised, and then vanished entirely. He tried to summon her up on the 18th of May. He apologized and pleaded but it seemed as if she were gone for good and he used it as a reason and excuse to drink himself into oblivion.
"I think you have reasonable expectations, John. You'll need to hang on to them. You need to understand that prioritizing your addiction over a relationship with your daughter limited your rights, perhaps not legally but emotionally, ethically."
They were in the middle of exposure therapy, something that had left him more anxious and upset than he'd been in a good long time.
"She was. I asked her something similar and she stated that while your issues were complex she hoped after you returned from rehab you might be able to put things to bed."
"Yeah, privilege points for chores and stuff. They explained this to you in theÂ beginningÂ and it's in the handbook."
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me all I saw in your eyes today when I asked you to be my best man was surprise. Just surprise that I thought of you as my best friend, which is ridiculous by the way. I think, again, I've answered my own question. If that surprised you...if it surprised you that I felt that way about you how could you possibly be thinking anything else?
"You're in pain. You've been favoring your right leg and hip for some time now but you've been trying to conceal it from me. Don't play stupid, John, you know how I hate that."
"Your parents are incrediblyÂ gift-y, as you put it. ThereÂ were an absurd amount of presents under the tree for me and Mary and you and even Mycroft. I think what you mean is
John tried to move his arm and winced before he'd raised it half an inch, the IV needle stabbing from inside. He felt awful, his entire body ached, his head throbbed, his throat was sore, the lights were too bright and he had the most awful sour taste in his mouth. He could go on and on and on but at that moment Sherlock, wearing a sling on his right shoulder, entered the room and froze in his tracks his eyes going wide. Seeming to regain his bearings he rushed towards the bed and smiled.
It was exciting andÂ time-consumingÂ and exhausting and frantic and somehow he was still able to catch an AA meeting every single day, all in person except for one on his laptop.
." I said giving him a shove forward. I didn't feel bad about feeling rough. I was fed up to the teeth with this.
Pauline looked confused atÂ havingÂ been so summarily dismissed and John immediately apologized on hisÂ boyfriend'sÂ behalf.
It would have felt, well...prideful to say he was proud. He wanted to wait. Sink back into life in London, in Baker Street. He wanted to get some time under his belt before he started patting himself on the back. He wasn't one to be superstitious but to have anything but a cautious and fragile optimism seemed to be inviting trouble. He knew where every bar was within walking distance of their flat, he knew the ones he could easily reach by cab as well. All of them waiting, patient neon eager for his return. Shops with row after row and shelf after shelf ready to soothe and abate and erase anything he needed them too. Was he a truly different man today than he was December 25th? Had he killed that John Watson as he'd wanted to? Perhaps not in suicide but murder. Murder by way of sobriety. He hoped against hope that son of a bitch was dead.
John watched as his daughter seemed to be weighing the offer, turning it around in her mind until eventually, she consented.
"Nonetheless," He continued undeterred. "I had always imagined it might take a bit of coaxing, were we ever to find ourselves in this position for you to let me do the penetrating."
You wouldn't believe the amount of decision making that goes into choosing a stone. Mycroft took care of your...body. What that means I still don't know. Are you here, underneath this ground? Are you in an urn somewhere? He wouldn't tell me.
"Me quoting me back to me. New depths." He said with a sniffle and she wrapped an arm around his shoulders and lay her head against his.
"I thought you might say no. And before we go any further, to avoid confusion, I want to show you something. Here's the receipt."
"John, you're thinking about it and I'd really rather you didn't. I'm a grown man and I am capable of making my own choices. I don't need my big brother's opinions or approval. I pleaded with him to get you in here but I offered no pound of flesh in return."
He'd answered the next day to say he was sorry but he wasn't going to be able to make it but hopefully next time round. Duck had been understanding and as it turned out hadn't been able to make it then himself. His trip had gotten pushed back...to this evening it seemed.
"Incorrect." Sherlock replied quickly. "Your behavior makes me unhappy and only your recent behavior at that. I abhor being lied to and dislike secrets. You've been dealing in both. The solution it would seem is simple, tell me the truth and a large chunk of our problems vanish. Next."
It was met with silence and then a burst of laughter from Sherlock. Great, rollicking laughter that surprised John who soon joined in. He was shocked his mate even knew the reference. But he clearly did and they both giggled like boys at the joke.
John was mesmerized by the site of his finger disappearing then reappearing from Sherlock's arse. Someday, someday, some bloody day soon it was going to be his cock. He was going to be inside him and that tight heat that was enveloping his finger would be surrounding his hard erection. His hand would be free and he'd have them both on Sherlock's hips controlling his movement controlling everything until they both came loudly together.
Hi guys, very briefly, I put a lot of links in this one, all about Molly. The three Tumblr links are from an absolutely wonderful, in-depth and helpful blog and lay down a very good case for Molly likely being a surgeon. I think it makes absolute sense so I went with it. You might find it interesting so take a look if you like. The other link is directly to Molly's official BBC blog. It's no longer updated and only had a few entries but it's worth a look in as well.
âI was with Duck. He and I didnât go to the same school we actually met at a park near my home. He was hanging out with a group of other blokes, clearly holding court. They were all older than me but it was one of those rare times where I had this powerful urge to just belong. By this time my sister was older and spending less time at home so I didnât have to be there immediately. I think I was just skulking about, hoping to be noticed. God knows what they were talking about, I canât remember, but I guess I made some smart comment, clever enough to get Duckâs attention and he asked me my name.â
getting clean for. You are not getting clean for your daughter, you are not getting clean for your sober sister, you are not getting clean to keep some sort of promise to your dead wife, you are not getting clean because you have disgraced Duck or the army, you are not getting clean for your father who didn't and you are not getting clean for Sherlock Holmes." Hanah had put down her notebook and was looking at him critically. "You have to understand this, John and you have to understand it now because otherwise, we're going forward under a false belief. A lot of marriages don't survive rehab and do you know why? Because the process of recovering from addiction is just as selfish as being addicted. Because after months or years of the addict focusing on what they
"Yeah, quite a lot actually. They became essentially non-existent. But that makes sense, doesn't it? It's not so much him anymore, it's the ones from the war and Mary. Relieving what happened to Mary."
Hanah had been right as she usually was. Coming to grips with what he had done on a personal level, not just with Sherlock but with the rest of the people in his life had been cathartic, hard but cathartic and he had told her as much.
"Sherlock, I love our flat and I don't want to be anywhere else but here. So, I think to stay on Mrs. Hudson's good side we should get her some noise canceling headphones."
Breakfast. Gym. Chores. Group. When he'd become such a creature of habit or better put a creature who enjoyed this type of habit he didn't know.
"Oh God, sorry, I say things like this in group and people look at me in horror. Especially the new people. I made that girl from
"I'm implying the opposite. I'm saying you mightÂ need to consider that one of the reasons you have traditionally kept your distance from people is because you fear that. You fear that your anger will grow out of control."
âYeah, I guess so. It was certainly the first time I had the means and space to put anything into a friendship.â
"No, you're being Sherlock. I just didn't want to grab your chin and plant a kiss on you outside of Speedy's if you didn't want me to. I mean, I'm not going to be shoving my tongue down your throat at every crosswalk but, I just wanted to know "
John watched, hands thrust into his pockets, forcing a smile as the vehicle made it's way down the mountain.
He came inside him, hips still working erratically as wave after orgasmic wave broke against them both. He felt a pool of sticky warmth from Sherlock's cock coat both their bellies.
It took the sound of theÂ vibratingÂ mobile to alert John to the fact that he'd fallen asleep. Sherlock too had drifted off and he reached a long arm toward the nightstand and blearily reached for his mobile.
He wasnât alone. At night there were disturbances. The sudden clatter of something being overturned, fighting, shouting, screaming, crying. It was like being stuck inside a madhouse. Sometimes he covered his head with his pillow, sometimes he joined his voice with the noise yelling for them all to kindly âShut the fuck up!â
"It arises because you were literally behind on everything when I moved into the flat. They were about to shut off the lights, do you remember that? That was remedied by me bringing a bit of order to the chaos."
John looked at Sherlock and they wordlessly agreed to leave their new closeness as something between them.
"Yessss...like now. Like you are. You kiss me, you take off your clothes. I feel your body on mine, on top, and then you're inside me and it feels so good."
"Yes, yeah it's good." Hoping he kept the lack of surety from his voice. "Anyway, it sounds like yet again we're in the same boat."
"Not nearly as loud as I intend to get with you. And not nearly as loudly as I intend to make you come in the future."
To John, it seemed that one moment they were right next to the sink and the next he was above Sherlock in the expanse of the large, soft bed. They were both naked, warm,Â excited and hard and Sherlock seemed eager to make up for what they had missed out on the previous night. He seemed to be feeling particularly bitey tonight and John groaned as teeth sank gently but firmly into his skin.
You choose now to come back. Now. Once it's done. Once I can't go back. Can't change my mind. Can bow out or back out. Can't *possibly* tell her it's off. You come back now when I was finally ready to move on. I am furious.
Hours later and the heavy fog of dissatisfaction still hadn't lifted. John was still upset by the facts the figures and what appeared to be the almost certainty of relapse. If the predictions were so dire then what was he even doing?
The creeping dread that John had tried to push away came rushing back now as he recalled what he'd revealed about his younger days. It was vile and disgusting and some of the absolute worst that he was capable of. And beyond that it was terribly tangled with his feelings of affection for Duck and the relief at being free of his father and sister. To deny who he was back then would be to deny a confusing mix of joy and pain and ugliness and beauty. But that was how
He nodded, sniffled and brought her into an embrace that in no way logically made sense. Still, it was real and warm and true. They held each other for a moment before pulled back and pressed their foreheads together, closing his eyes.
Once the meetings was over he hurried to the bathroom, downed a few of the pills he'd been craving and returned to his partner, ignoring the slight frown he gave him.
Regretfully he parted from his mate and slipped into the bathroom to shower and dress. As he was shaving Sherlock came in as well and John smiled as he saw his friends reflection in the mirror.
He didnât know what heâd been expecting. Maybe to be scolded which he felt he deserved for his rudeness. But that didnât seem as though it was forthcoming.
John took his free hand and squeezed it. That was all. Just squeezed it and then held it in his own.
They weren't saying much at all and John preferred it that way. He actually didn't know what words were appropriate here.
"John, you are an absolute menace and you have put me through the ringer. And there have been times where I have wanted toÂ throttle you. But I'm going to tell you something I don't know if you've ever heard."
"I'm sorry for not telling them about us. But...oh, it's so stupid when I even think about saying it aloud."
"I do love when you makeÂ requests," John said. He reached over again and traded the dildo for lube. Changing his positioning so he was at Sherlock's side he slicked his digits and parted his legs. He knew how to play his body now. He'd never be a virtuoso on the violin like Sherlock was but he knew how to make theÂ maestro himself make the loveliest sounds.
After 12 days I've been given the detox all clear. Or at least, the all clear in terms of needing medical supervision.
After a late, light lunch or early dinner, Baker Street was again closed to new business. They found themselves on the sofa again, it was often where they liked to get the preliminaries going. Sherlock was kissing his neck, that purple shirt of his that John loved seeing on him was more than a few buttons undone.
But this time, though he refused to admit it, even to himself, he was caught between hiding it from Sherlock and making him see it.
Futilely he spared a thought for how much he wished he had his cock in hand, hard, ready, eager, dying to be buried inside his boyfriend. But this wasn't a time or place to feel pity. He had and was enjoying himself and it was more than time to return the favor.
"Orgasm begins and ends in the brain. You told me that. Not that I didn't already know but it seems you're the one who needs a refresher. Do you really think the simple act of friction is all that's involved? Your ability to come has more to do with your spinal cord than your cock. And it's not just that, it's all the things you won't discuss. Do you think your depression doesn't factor in?"
It was funny too, but all the things Reggie mentioned, the last time he'd been in bed with someone he cared about, the last time he'd held someone or had been held...
The questions went on like that, some ridiculous, some not nearly as cut and dried as they might seem. All in all he finished and waited for her to return.
"We hop in the cab, you give him the address and you know the windows that separate the passenger from the driver? Well they roll up, like in a limo. They're black. He can't see us." I say, as I wrap my hand around a cock that isn't mine for the first time ever.
The rented Luton was parked out front and he, Sherlock and Rosie had been in and out of it for the past few hours. Sherlock was as casual as Sherlock got, sporting trainers,Â John didn't know he even owned, a Barts t-shirt and a pair of jeansÂ he found absurdly distracting. John was dressed much the same and they both had rings of sweat around their collars. Rosie was in the highest of spirits, mostly getting in the way or playing with a few neighborhood children. She'd wanted to come along and Harry had dropped her off early in the morning. Both she and Clara had offered to help with this final clean-up but John had wanted to do it mostly alone. Despite the sweating, it wasn't actually that big of a job. There were more small things than large. Most of the furniture they were leaving behind. It was barely used. The house itself was barely used. And despite the fact that it was extra work to keep an eagle-eye on her, John wanted Rosie along. This was her home too even if she didn't know it. Or it had once been, and she deserved a chance to say goodbye.
"So typically, as I understand it, when someone pours their heart out to you you're meant to respond." He paused and swallowed.
"Excuse me one moment." She said picking it up. "It's on silent except for emergency announcements."
How had it lost that feeling that at the time had felt so large, so all-encompassing, so real that it seemed like it was a part of him? How did he lose something like that? How did he lose her? How did his love for Rosie somehow get subtracted from his world?
John scanned a bit lower but unable to find the tweet that had caused the uproar eventually went to Sherlock's timeline.
âHmm...then I wonder why he saw fit to pass along his number?â John said holding up a slip of paper triumphantly.
âThe first thing I want to say is I owe you an apology. Iâm sorry for not showing up yesterday. Youâve been nothing but kind to me, hard but kind and you donât deserve to be ignored like that.â
"No, of course not." John said and as he approached his mate he entered into doctor mode. Crouching down in front of him he took his wrist in hand to feel his pulse. It was the first time they'd actually touched. As his own foolhardy behavior had ramped up they become more demonstrative with one another, more physical. Hugging and that sort. And then, of course, there was the kiss...But the distance between them now made John wonder if that was over and done with. A phase now past.
Once inside he closed the door behind him but not before they'd all made one last play to get a rise out of him.
I'm just trying to make sense of my life these days and I know so are you. Having the remodel of the flat take over so many of our waking moments has been incredibly helpful. I needed something all consuming and I think so did you.
"John, now...inside me, please," Sherlock asked looking up at him from the bed. A few careful maneuvers and one glorious thrust and JohnÂ was hissing with pleasure at how gloriously snug the fit was.
"Well...um...to continue the metaphor...I...I'd be willing to do another search for the spigot for you. I'd be happy to. It must, after all, be around here somewhere."
"I know you've probably heard this in your meetings already but especially given your history I want to caution against jumping into a sexual relationship too soon."
John paused and thought back. Thought about the few pictures he'd seen of her. Tried to remember her face. He'd been five or so when she'd died. Everything he ever heard about her was good. Everything he ever thought about her as well.
Seeing his lover like that was indescribably hot. He was still wearing his t-shit but the rest of him was nude and the shirt itself had ridden up a little. The muscles in his arms were bulging ever so slightly as he supported himself. There was the tantalizing dip of his lower back. The curve of his well-muscled arse. His strong thighs and calves even his feet were somehow attractive. But, as hot as all that was there was one element that took John by surprise with how attracted and ready and aroused and loving her felt. The vulnerability. This position and the speed with which Sherlock had assumed it showed nothing but absolute trust and it hurt just as much as it felt wonderful. He hadn't imagined anyone would ever trust him like this again, that anyone ever should. But here he was, Sherlock, the love of his life, waiting patiently, eagerly for him.
"I don't know...um...metallic noises...like silverware in a restaurant. Anything that sort of whizzes by my ear too fast. Sometimes, running too hard, getting winded, I think because it reminds me of the bullet just seeming to suck the air out of my body. A car backfiring...we talked about that one before."
"Thanks, I um...I really couldn't have done it without you. Things we talked about at The Location and things we discussed here. It all came back into focus when I was there."
John's eyes widened as Sherlock dropped to his knees. Once there he pulled John's cock from his pants.
"I'll eat at home." He breathed as he parted Sherlock coat before sliding his fingers over the smooth material of his shirt and up across his chest.
"I..guess I've learned that things I thought were dead and buried with my father, especially my feelings about him aren't. I learned that I'm predictable. Maybe not just in my patterns but in the people I choose as well. Huh..." He paused. "That one is just occurring to me now. Um...what else, I suppose I'd say my ideas of depression missed the mark. I think I've been trying to deal with it or not dealing with it since I was a teenager. Maybe it's colored a lot of my life."
"After Carl Powers died. Not directly after but...I knew I was onto something with his case. I was close. But I couldn't solve it. I couldn't make it work and it infuriated me. But there was something else. I was 13 and it was the first time in my life I could recall being stimulated by something. It was the first time I felt alive. I started scanning local newspapers, then national, then international, looking for cases, unsolved murders, mysterious disappearances. I kept a notebook to log all the information about the cases I could find and discern and those became my great experiments. They captivated me. I didn't think about the people. They didn't mean much to me but I was obsessed with the puzzles their lives presented. Sometimes I would try and call the police stations and tell them of my findings but they never listened. All they ever heard was a child on the other end of the line. One day Mycroft found my notebook. I was so worried he was going to proclaim it a waste of time or tell our parents but instead, he decided it was a good exercise. I so looked up to him that when he asked if he might serve as an adviser and proctor I leaped at the chance. My brother is...smarter than I could ever hope to be. But for God sakes don't tell him I said that. He was helpful in guiding me, in sharpening my methods, my thought processes, my observation and analytical abilities. "Narrow it down." He would say to me. "Narrow it down." Eventually, I did. Eventually, the two of us, both in our spare time, were solving cases all over the world, though no one knew. That was sufficient for more than a few years. But soon Mycroft went into government and no longer had time for me. Plus I was just about to enter Uni and that changed things as well."
printed on the side. That poor fool. That poor, stupid, unlucky fool. There but for the grace of God go I."
"No, no one can ever tell the great Captain Watson what to do, can they? Even when he's pissing his life away, yet again. This ends now."
âI think, due to your insolence, Iâd prefer it if every first and last word out of your mouth was sir.â
Work, our great work; you and I together. The lens and the instrument hardly matter without you by my side. In light of all this, I have decided that you don't get to leave me. I won't allow it. I want you to stay and ultimately I always wind up getting what I want. So, have you completed your arguments?"
"I'll uh...go to my bedroom then." John said standing to his feet. Though it hurt, he hopped up with enthusiasm.
John had given Sherlock a last minute checkup before finalizing their plans. But after finding him in good shape, much better than when he arrived and after tiring of Sherlock's protests they began.
"Yes, thank you." John said at the same time Sherlock said. "Here, hold her and once you've got her reach behind you and grab the bag with the colouring books and crayons."
âNow, was that so hard?â He asked releasing his hair and returning his hand to his cock. âOh, I guess it was.â he teased.
At that Sherlock burst out laughing and John joined him. The man he'd met years ago in the morgue at Barts hadn't seemed like the type that would enjoy being teased. But the Sherlock before him actually enjoyed when John took the piss. In that momentÂ his partner snuggled next to him, setting the popcorn on his lap and whispered; "Start this silly movie, would you?"
"That was...mmm... incredible. John...mmmm...that was..." He couldn't seem to space out his kisses or his words evenly and John smiled as accepted and gave kisses in return. "I feel so...so..."
"Because it had to be organic. Because I'm on your journey you're not on mine. I can't lead you anywhere, not really."
So, by and large, he'd packed sexuality and desire and everything that came with it away. Packed it up like a box to be shoved into an attic. The truth was he didn't quite feel the urge anymore. Memories of Mary still made him happy but that visceral pleasure was for the most part gone. In the early days, back home, in the suffocating quiet of his room he'd tried to have a wank to no avail. Whiskey dick was a stone cold fact whether he drank whiskey or not.
Sherlock caught him up on the latest trash telly he'd been viewing. John mentioned a book or two he'd been interested in getting from Amazon, a few thrillers, and mysteries.
"So I got to Barts, got out of the cab and you called me. You direct me to look up and you start spouting off these lies. Awful, awful lies really, one after another. You were a fake, you looked me up, it was all a trick, etc. etc. And you were crying. See, I'd heard you upset before, frantic, lost, scared but I never heard you cry. Not ever...and I wanted...I felt so helpless. I avoided getting close to people because that helplessness is always, always part and parcel. And here it was again. I couldn't believe what you were planning.
"No, I am not on any other medications. I'm not on any medications at all. Are you listening?" He snapped. He was already growing tired of this line of questioning. They'd promised him a bed and if he couldn't get a drink then he at least wanted to retreat under the covers.
Having regained his senses John became aware that Sherlock was in the midst of speaking almost as if he hadn't heard his plaintive 'Fuck me' entreaty. But the smile in his voice betrayed his cool demeanor.
His words were interrupted by a knock on the door and John was suddenly being nudged aside as someone tried to enter against the impediment that was his body. He stepped away and he and Sherlock were greeted by the smiling and apologetic face of a nurse and the surly, grimace of a young man who couldn't have been more than 18. John was pretty sure he was in a boy band, or he
"Who LEFT MEÂ TO DROWN in a well next to the bones of your former best friend! Is this at all ringing any bells with you? And I know what you're going to say because I left you wide open for it. What about Mary? What's the difference? Well, let me tell you the difference, everything. Mary and I were in the open. I never went behind your back saying one thing whileÂ omitting the truth only to pop up months later to announce; Guess what? I've mended fences with the woman who nearly killed you! Sure hope you're alright with that!"
Hanah had looked at him with concern from the screen. There were times when both of them together and separately felt the limitation of not being in the same room together as they were at The Location. This was one of the times where, if his memory served, she seemed to feel it keenly.
Things improved markedly after that night. Which is not to say they were suddenly normal. Far from it. But they were a better them than they had been.
"We've got a unique opportunity here." Hanah began. "Sherlock, I had intended on discussing these things with John anyway but to have you here and receptive I think will make the process that much more useful. First, we're going to talk about your "death"."
He had no ill feelings towards Sherlock and that was what made it harder to leave and harder to stay.
âI didnât know you had this in you.â John said with lusty admiration. âPlease, Sherlock, Iâm ready, please.â
Duck and the woman he'd been seeing had split. That came out after a long while. Something surprisingly real, personal.
Authors Note: Well...here we are, at the end of the road. I may...**may** do a soft, short little epilogue. But I'm not quite sure. In any case, this is essentially the definitive end of the story and I consider it 99.9% complete. :)
That was the last of his breakdowns for that late night or early morning session. By the time it was over and Hanah tried to send him back to bed he was exhausted. His throat was raw, his head felt near splitting, his eyes burned red and dry and he felt as forlorn and lost as he had a year ago.
"Is there anything I can do?" Sherlock asked at the same time John defensively blurted; "It's quite real, by the way. Nothing psychosomatic this go round."
lying to you. I have a short quiz that I want you to take, ok? It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes." She handed him a piece of paper and a pencil as she rose from her chair. "I'm going to grab a cup of coffee, would you like one?"
I noticed he had shaved and his hair was looking much less unruly than it had been the night before. He was in his dressing gown a t-shirt and pajama trousers. For all intents and purposes, back to business, back to normal.
It was the direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console and the fuzz pedal in The Beatles,
"No, not tonight. So, um, we could move your stuff to your room after dinner, if you like. Or, if you wanted you could stay with me again."
He set himself laughing one night as he imagined standing at the top of Barts and calling him. Calling him to apologize for everything, saying everything that needed saying and then plunging off.
"Alright, well, what sparked it was a time where I went missing for a week. No one ever intends to go missing for a week, you know. You intend to go out and get your fix, whatever your fix is and then proceed with your day. But stuff happens."
She was holding Rosie in her arms and the little girl mimicked the gesture, putting a small hand on Sherlock's cheek. In a superb act of breaking any tension he pretended to bite at her fingers and she squealed in delight.
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen." He recited along with everyone else. The sentiment was hard but valuable and he said the words earnestly.
"After everything that's happened, you want me back at Baker Street?" He asked finding the offer hard to believe.
By the time John returned his focus to Sherlock's mum even he had lost the narrative thread of the story. She was asking her husband something but shaking her head at every answer he gave.
"Ok, ok." John said and steeling himself he reached out to cup his chin. "And no, you daft man there is no lovely woman I'm waiting for. There's you and only you. I just wanted to...to lash out."
"It was the time of my life." Sherlock replied with painful earnestness. "Better than I'd even dreamed. But you didn't have an...you didn't come."
"I love you, Sherlock Holmes," he said quietly. "You're going to come to doubt a lot of things but I hope you never doubt that."
"Speaking of the rimming," He said grabbing his own toothbrush. "Iâm going to have to try that on you as soon as possible.â
"So if this changes anything...I...fuck." He swallowed hard and sniffed before going silent. Jesus, could this be the way it ended? Not with violence or a fight. Not with nasty, spiteful words but with the simple and silent movement of a skeleton being forced out of a closet. He sniffed again and avoided his partnerâs gaze, instead focusing his eyes on his sister. He would have glared but Rosie had stopped colouring and watching him earnestly as though she were as invested in the conversation as anyone else.
"I tried reading your blog. It's better than his blog but still a bit boring. I was following your mate on twitter for awhile but he mostly just likes slagging people off. He stopped tweeting a few months back so I unfollowed him." Yet another woman said. This one was a bit older than the first and he recalled seeing a trailer for a movie she had coming out next month. "Do you have an Instagram. I follow back."
It was probably the most words Molly had ever said to him and in her earnest, quiet yet commanding way she humbled him. They weren't friends. Not really. Acquaintances at best. Aside from Sherlock, he didn't have friends. He realized that now. ButÂ that was no reflection on whether or not she was a good person
"I took your advice. I chucked the script, I laid it out on the line. I told her things that I hadn't before, hadn't dared. I mean we went places in therapy that...well I just never imagined."
"It's his moods, you know." She continued as if John hadn't spoken. "Sometimes he seems so sad. You don't see it because you've usually just left the room. But also, lately, he's been positively bubbly. Well, bubbly for Sherlock. He's smiling more. He even made me tea! And there wasn't a finger in it, just regular tea!"
to keep up on chores and meetings to retain phone privileges. And once Sherlock was gone that would be essential.
"Your change and receipt, eh? Don't ya want 'em?" She called after him but he was already on the move. Weighed down by bags he pushed past the photog at the end of the belt and hurried out the door. They followed, fast on his heels as he hailed a cab, nearly surrounding him.
He tore into the box and then into the bottle swallowing a few of them dry. He'd once read an article about an athlete who took up to 50 pain pills a day, every day. John had lost count of how many he'd had. But it couldn't be anywhere near that many. Could it...?
"Oh no, I agree, I'm not apologizing for that. As though it were an accusation. I'm apologizing for not believing you or hearing you when you said it."
Admittedly John had a difficult time paying attention, he felt...conspicuous. And whether it was genuine or all in his mind he couldn't shake the feeling that they were studying him...perhaps even judging.
I've been thinking about stuff, specifically identity and rigidity. I realize now that it was convenient for me to have this crutch. It was convenient for me to use it as aÂ camouflageÂ for other, older things that were wrong. If people can see you're an alcoholic they leave you alone. Or if they don't leave you alone they figure your problem is the drinking and you just need to stop. Usually by agreeing you can get them off your back. It's apparently all part of me keeping people away. Bu of course, it didn't phase you, it wouldn't. Toward the end there, I was trying to keep you away but you wouldn't budge and that stupidly, made me angry. And as for the rigidity, I...like a schedule, I like things to run on time, happen on time. And even though the addiction became part of the rigidity, it worked for me. There was something comforting in knowing just when that need would pop up and everything you wanted me to do disrupted that rigidity. It prevented me from focusing on the one thing I thought I could handle and manage. What am I saying...I guess I'm saying I'm so sorry for treating you like the hired help. I'm sorry for letting my habits push one of the few people who was trying to help me, out of my life. I'm sorry for raising my voice and I'm sorry for ending things with such a curt, impersonal letter. I am sorry, Hanah. You have been in my corner since day one and I haven't forgotten that and I am sorry."
"Oh I know precisely who I'm dealing with and I'll repeat my words from earlier. You love this. You love being the hero. Not much call for it in Afghanistan. At least not as much as you had hoped. We've never talked about that have we, John? Just why you joined the Army. Oh you may be running away from things now but you were running
As John scolded him about not biting the bullet and taking a chance with The Woman it occurred to him that perhaps they had finally traded places. Sherlock, reborn, maybe, just maybe on the verge of truly letting someone into that final place in his mind, his heart, his life and he, John Watson, willing to close up shop for good.
He'd thought Sherlock might close his eyes but instead, he kept them open and they grew wider as he let himself feel. Those beautiful eyes, two pools of ever-changing color always teetering on the edges of blue and gray and green. John had wanted to see those eyes at this particular moment when they were as connected and as one as they ever had been. Sherlock's hand moved up the landscape of John's back to rest on theÂ nape of his neck, gently tugging, silently asking for a kiss which John gave.
âHe apologized for leaving but said none of this was going to blow over for him. He needed to get away and he wanted me safe. He left the money for rent and the gun for protection. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry.â
"What was that?" John asked, trying to play dumb, something that always raised the ire of the detective. They were both staring at their laptop's, hard at work and he hoped Sherlock might be so engrossed he'd forgotten he even asked the question.
I never noticed all the spots where the sun faded the leather. All the spots you weren't. All the spots you aren't.
"It's been a difficult year. I wasn't sure about lasting effects. I...I know I was in the news, you may or may not have seen."
Late one evening, so late, in fact, it was technically morning John rolled over and found the other side of the bed empty. He patted the blank space and found that it was still warm so Sherlock hadn't left long ago. When he concentrated he could hear the floorboard squeaking rhythmically as though someone was walking back and forth, pacing.
from it. But still, we were worried about his mawkish ways and the boys were getting too close, too secretive, too independent. So we decided it was time to have our third."
It turned out to be one of the best decisions he'd made inÂ a while. He hadn't been aware of just how much flotsam andÂ jetsamÂ wereÂ floating through his head, how much garbage about medication and mad-midnight cravings and knowing when you'reÂ burdeningÂ your partner and knowing your own triggers andÂ warningÂ signs there was until he started talking. It was different than therapy, it was different than conversations with Hanah. It was different than meetings. Talking to Eric was something altogether unique and he was shocked that it was helping.
It was the same logic you used when a mysterious letter arrived in the post, or there was a voicemail from an unknown number.
When I was discharged I was referred specifically to a bedsit that housed mostly other post-war headcases like me. Thick walls. That was a selling point and do you know why? So the screams of the other residents wouldn't bother you and so your screams wouldn't bother them. It was like a mental hospital where we were all allowed to come and go as we pleased.
"Jesus...Sherlock...for fucks sake!" He paused clutching his chest. This had happened before, or at least he thought it had. It seemed that once "Mary" had left Sherlock would occasionally take his place. He'd see him. or think he saw him, just briefly, just a flash, sometimes just the whipÂ of his coat as he turned a corner. It was disturbing and unnerving and it also made him feel terribly barmy and terribly lonely. How many nights had he spent talking to "Sherlock" only to discover he'd never been there at all. So many ghosts. "You nearly gave me a heart attack!"
"I..." He started and then paused for a moment to stroke Rosie's hair. "Yes, I loved him. He was my best mate."
"Yes, but you were thinking and I could hear you. How could I be upset that you cared enough about my daughter and me to do what you did."
Sherlock's hands moved to his waist but John could immediately tell it was less sexy and more appraising.
I told the therapist this go round that there were things that had been on my mind. Things that were suddenly becoming clear to me about you...about us. And just when I was playing about with the idea of letting you in on it, well, you went and did this. You absolute bastard.
"No one did. I didn't either. It's ok. Nothing to be forgiven for, just like I said at my party. I'm trying to set a new course now, you know? New life."
John tuned her out a bit because of the squick factor but mostly due to thoughts about Sherlock. His mate was sad. His mate was happy. Happy when he was in the room. Sad when he left.
The mashed bananas were more played with as opposed to eaten which necessitated a warm bath. When Sherlock had gotten a toddler bath seat, John had no idea but it was waiting in the tub when he came in with the baby shampoo and the child's towel with the hood that looked like a crab's head and one bath toy, also a bright red crab.
In his haste, he'd neglected to bring in anything but a dressing gown. No pants, no trousers, no shirt.
"That's not even halfway close to how long I want to spend with you." he said drawing him down for a kiss.
Oh God but this was perfect. It was everything John had ever wanted to hear ad more. So much more. In fact, he was quite convinced that he could listen to Sherlock talk about his fantasy life for hours.
"Right, I'd better dash." After grabbing his wallet and keys he went to Sherlock's chair and tilting up his chin gave him a kiss. "See you later."
"Dada!" She called and turned away from John before rushing toward him as though she hadn't seen him all day.
Snow quickly covered the dark head of hair which he only just caught a glimpse of in the headlights of the vehicle.
Dipping his tongue in the well of Sherlock's belly button along with the quick strokes of his hand finally pushed him over the edge and he came again, his voice too raw to reach previous heights. John was sure he felt a splash hit the back of his head but he didn't stop, licking and nipping at Sherlock's belly, stroking his cock until he gently pleaded with him to stop.
He grabbed at his laptop, woke it from sleep and went to his email. Nothing much there upon first glance. Real Estate agents doing cold contacts, trying to see if he was interested in selling the house. Essentially just a lot of spam and nonsense.
He'd given it a go more than a few times here at The Location but had always wound up stopping when his cock had no interest in being anything other than limp. It was maybe too early to panic. Erections didn't just come back once you got off the booze. It took time. As a doctor, he knew there could be temporary nerve damage and serious changes in his hormones to repair and it wasn't as if the depression had just gone away or the anxiety with it. The penis is such a simple, stupid thing...except when it's not.
"No...yes, I...just need a few moments to myself if that's alright?" He said, his voice strained as he stood with his back to John.
John searched his feelings, trying to sort them out properly. Cross wasn't the right word. Surprised, yes. Bewildered, yes. Perhaps a bit hurt, of course. Jealous? Unbelievably so. But not cross.
"I don't think so. When you think about it I averaged, what, 4 partners a year. That's one person every quarter. Does that sound so terrible?"
. It's time to let some of it go. Stop trying to rebuild on such shaky ground. Find something new and steady andÂ solid beneath your feet. Perhaps you need to realize
"He's a war zone. He's constantly being torn apart, from inside and out. He just looks calm but he's not...he's not ok. He was getting there, getting better and then I had to go..."
He timed the appointment so that it would likely allow him to cut across London via cab and arrive on time if not early for the LGBTQ meeting at the small chapel.
"I'm fine. There was some nasty business earlier concerning a man and a khopesh sword. But it's all sorted. Are you ok? Why do you still have your phone?"
"Then invite him. This isn't just about seeing your best friend this is about moving forward and embracing what's true and what isn't, no matter how painful. I can't guarantee he'll accept and I can't force you, but I can strongly advise that you invite him, all right?"
It wasn't just that the pain was lessening it wasn't even just that Sherlock virtuosity with his hands was not limited to the violin it was also the fact that somehow, without him even noticing John's cock was positively rigid.
he really want? They were going to live together again. It was to be just the two of them. John had no intention of dating and neither did Sherlock so didn't they already belong to one another? For God sakes he had already tacitly agreed to retire with him in Sussex and raise bees. And the idea didn't even scare him. He was happy.
Words were life and words were goodbye and the both kept flowing from her lips. All he wanted to do was stem the tide. Please don't waste them. Please, love, please. Please.
I've got a little less than 60 days left here and Hanah has put some interesting ideas in my head, about not going back to a life that made me so unhappy. I may be leaving London for good. Going somewhere else, try and start again.
"I was going to. When Harry initially told me she wasn't going to show I figured I had more time to ease you into it. I didn't want it to blow up in your face like this."
John retreated to the relative safety of his room. The common area was overcrowded, the hallways were thick with people, everything felt cramped and overwhelming. It wasn't until he was in his room with his dinner that he felt able to breathe. James had spotted him in the dining hall and motioned him over but he'd begged off as politely as he could with a brief wave. He couldn't do it now. The smile on his face was already tight and alien and he wanted nothing more than to drop it, curled up on his bed, music playing softly, nose in a book.
Watson, know what the results will say. You are still a doctor, aren't you? Or have they revoked your license? Doesn't matter. The test will say you're killing yourself."
"All the time. Every time. He always listens to you and he always does what you say...in his own way. You're the only one he listens to."
It seemed like ages ago but he and Mike used to meet, almost exclusively, at any number of local pubs. They spend time getting just this side of absolutely shit-faced and cab themselves home. Come to think of it that was how they'd spent a good deal of their early relationship as well. Things were different now. Jesus, did they know each other outside of getting wasted?
"I will." John pulled away from the warmth of his coat and body and words. He cinched the Belstaff around Sherlock and straightened his scarf. Now, go home, get something to eat because I know you haven't and go to bed. Promise?"
"I was always here to talk to. I still am." He said quietly putting a hand on his knee. "You can move back here and I will take care of you both."
"Probably for the best. Even if you and he have an open relationship seeing other people can still chafe. My husband thought it was a grand idea until I started seeing that young man who bagged our groceries..."
"Well, they hate me. Even though they invited us for Christmas, I know they still hate me. And they can't approve of the match, I imagine."
Emboldened by John's command he started to bob more rapidly up and down pushing him towards the inevitable.
He drifted back to sleep happy and content, imaginingÂ himself and Sherlock as old men, still having their verbal sparring matches, still disagreeing, still being utterly flummoxed by each other but in the end, always in the end, coming together, mending, fixing, healing.
"John!" The desperate shout might have made him jump if he hadn't wholly been expecting it. Instead he just smiled. He was a little surprised by how easily this was all coming to him. How much his want for this man was just beneath the surface. How unbothered he was by this new masculine terrain, this new body. He gave him a gentle suck this time, just the head, just the tip and immediately felt more ejaculate coat his tongue. It was good. So good. And he wanted more. Only Sherlock's pleading made him stop.
"No, you're right. I'm the occupant or the former occupant." John said raising his hand. "We were just leaving. I was checking to make sure I hadn't left anything and just, um...saying goodbye."
Or, will it be the angry, hurt man who left my hospital room and instead sent his brother to tend to me?
He didn't toss the pills. He wasn't crazy, he just put them away and out of sight. Normally he would have accompanied Sherlock to France but his cover was very specific, so he said. The story just didn't make sense with two people. Though not eager to spend the weekend alone John understood and tried to look upon it as an opportunity to set things back on course.
But as both thoughts rattled about his head he decided they each sounded a little too dangerous to say aloud.
There was movement as Sherlock shifted in bed. He reached for his phone and started entering information. The next thing John knew he was staring at his boyfriend's bank account balance. He looked at the number, blinked and looked again.
Well this was unexpected. Though when he thought about it, Sherlock could turn on a dime, go from zero to a hundred with a snap of this fingers and this certainly constituted 100. Quickly changing into clean clothes, brushed his teeth, he gave himself a final look, grabbed a few condoms and a newly purchased bottle of lube and headed to Sherlock's room.
After a 2015 filled with sporadic tweeting, the account had effectively gone silent. There was nothing for the new year.
But John hadn't been interested in the letter opened instead he'd focused on what he could see behind the object Sherlock held in his hand.
"You are helping me. Just...keep doing this ok?" He asked pulling his partner's arm tighter around his body, sleep already starting to reclaim him.
"Good morning everyone. My name Jan and I'm an alcoholic. I'd like to welcome you to this regular closed meeting of Alcoholic's Anonymous. Now I'm going to invite all who'd like to participate to join me in a moment of silence for those who are still sick and suffering, both in and out of the room, followed by the Serenity Prayer."
"It's what you do for those you love. Hardly a hardship." He was quite for a few seconds before adding. "She looks like you."
I started to cast a net at his first level haunts, as I called them. The places he looked for leads, the places he went for information, but no one had seen him.
"I do. I do say so. Now, I want to talk about what might trigger these particular memories in everyday life."
Given their walk and their breakfast which only consisted of coffeeÂ John was famished and eager to sample whatever fare the Wotton House had to offer. He wasn't disappointed as they dined on Truffle Orzi Croquette for Starters,Â Duck with Pearl Barley, Mushroom and Peach for a Main and John opted for chips on the side which they shared. It was a glorious meal in a lovely location. They took a brief tour, John snapping pictures the whole time. Sherlock was indulgent, lovely and serene, everything John worried he might not be able to manage with such a long holiday hanging over his head. But damned if he didn't seem to be enjoying himself.
"So...we're official then?" He finally said to the detective. It was bold and a leap and it could absolutely backfire.
"If everyone could stop staring at us right now that would be absolutely lovely." He said to the other party goers. His tone was sweet because of the little girl present but no one missed the irritation. "Either join in on
He was sitting in Hanah's office with a death grip on the arms of the chair, precisely the kind of grip she was trying to get him to loosen. He stopped and wiped sweat from his brow he didn't even know was there.
"I'm sorry...I think I'm going to..." He couldn't finish his words and instead reached for her waste bin and retched into it violently. His stomach clenched and he dry heaved again. He hadn't eaten anything and the alcohol had long since soaked into his system. It was mostly thick, repugnant bile and he heaved once more before he felt slightly confident in lifting his head from the garbage. Tears were streaming down his face and that vile flavor was in his mouth and nose.
"I'm sorry." He replied and it was laden with more anguish than John could stand to acknowledge. "Can I please help you? Please?"
"It can be." John replied. "But a lot of times they're too tired. It is, however, traditional for them to go at it like rabbits for weeks afterward, though."
John seemed to be beyond speech at this point and only nodded. His cock felt hot and hard in his hand and Sherlock was a moment away from asking the doctor to put his hand on his own.
His need to touch Sherlock, to be touched, to have him close was overwhelming and so they fell back into the comfort of soft touches and conversations and voices and kisses. They were neither platonic nor lusty instead settling somewhere in between. They were just
"Yes, well...yes, that sounds...-" John chuckled behind him, listening as he struggled to get the sentence out. "That's...I'll place an order first thing tomorrow."
Authors Note: As you can no doubt tell we're approaching the climax of the story and I consider this chapter to be the penultimate to the fall of John Watson. There's like 2 chapters left to write. Maaaaayybe 3. I'm not sure. I'm never sure until I get into it. :) I put a few hot links in this one. I wanted there to be this particular sort of feeling for John when he gets high. This feeling of everything being blotted out, of sound being dampened. You know how your ears feel all ring-y and like you're trying to hear through cotton balls stuffed in your ears after a really loud concert. I loveÂ distortion in music. I love heavy fuzz and vocal filters and if you're in the mood you can click and hear what I feel like it's like for him.
"And then you were going to do the Dutch. How thoughtful," Sherlock said shortly and John watched as his anger flared. "Mrs. Hudson and several others are waiting outside to see you. They'll be pleased that you're awake."
He recalled a time when he'd spent the day at the beach with Mary. A long, warm day, in and out of the water, running through the waves, rolling in the sand. She'd smelled of salt water and sweat. By the end of the day any trace of that sunscreen scent had been stripped away and she just smelled like
"Or Duck." His friend continued perhaps reacting to the look on John's face. "Though you're the only one left who would know to call me that these days."
He loved it when Sherlock begged and his 'sexual awakening' had brought forth a lot of great bits of info. He always begged when he was close to coming. When Rosie wasn't around he was actually deliciously vocal and downright demanding.
âI hung around after class with some of my mates. I just got distracted and I got home too late. I was always supposed to be there. I made sure Harry was out of the way by the time he got home but this time I hadnât. He came home and he picked a fight with his eight-year-old daughter. By the time I got there she was under her bed. I coaxed her out and saw she had a bloody nose. I asked her what happened and she said he backhanded her in the kitchen. She was shaking. Iâd never actually seen anyone shake before. Iâd read about it in books, you know, someone trembling in fear... Anyway, I cleaned her up and I said I was sorry over and over and over again. Thank God, nothing was broken. And I told her Iâd never leave her alone again. I made her dinner, tucked her in. Dad was gone down the pub and when he got back I made dinner for him. Spaghetti. And when he sat down at the table I poured the boiling water on his hand. I told him that if he ever touched her again heâd get worse. I told him next time it would be his dick while he slept.â
." With that I made fantasy reality letting my mouth descend on his cock. He was hot against my lips and tongue. He was hard, he tasted slightly salty and smelled like fresh sweat. Beneath it there was that something else. That masculine smell that can so easily turn sour or ripe in the wrong conditions on a hot day or in the weight room at a gym. It had a tipping point and usually when I noticed it on someone it was because it had gone wrong. But with Sherlock is was right, completely right, it smelled like youth and virility and strength and male. Just male. I liked having it flooding my nose as much as I liked having his cock in my mouth and in an effort to taste more of the latter and inhale more of the former, I took him deeper, my nose getting closer to that dark pubic hair.
Then those horrors broke free from his dreams. He'd start to sweat and feel ill if he saw anyone standing on a roof or washing windows. He'd once walked past some men unloading heavy bags of cement from the back of a lorry on a rainy day. Smack-smack-smack the bags hit the wet ground. He'd had to break away from Mary's hand and duck into an alley to vomit.
The first, the oldest, the one most tried and true, let them hit rock bottom and realize they need help.
No matter. Balancing his phone under his chin so the light shone on the notepad he started writing. His hand and handwriting were unsteady but the words were there. The same words he'd thought of the first time but now tinged with so much more love and understanding for what he'd had. What he'd been given. What he was losing. And what he hadn't given back. It wasn't poetry but it was truth. At least it felt true as he was writing it. He stopped periodically to scratch something out or rewrite it, to readjust the phone or pull his jacket tighter. Once he even stopped just to rest for a moment, to close his eyes, just for a bit. He wasn't sure how long he'd dozed for but when he opened his eyes he was drunkenly aware of approaching footsteps.
âI didnât dare hope for more. I was ready to subsist my whole life on just this, John." Sherlock said sleepily.
He got up from the floor and I could see the wet spot on his sweatpants. It instantly made me feel like I could be ready for another go sooner rather than later.
He turned on his heel, and furious and defeated he returned to his room. Childishly, and he knew it was childish, he slammed the door and sat on the edge of his bed.
"Drawer." Came the hurried reply and then Sherlock was reaching for it before John even had a chance. He passed it to him and John popped open the lid.
"I am clean and sober. I have not nor do I have any intention of attending meetings. I'm pleased if they help people. Doubly so if they help John. I, however, have no place there."
"Thank you." Sherlock said as if John had gifted him something. "I believe it would be too awkward for us both to attempt this on the sofa. If you'll go to your bedroom and get comfortable I'll be in shortly."
