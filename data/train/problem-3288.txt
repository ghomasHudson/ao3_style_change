“To Amenadiel, actually,” Lucifer continued, guiding Detective to sit down at the piano before going back around behind the bar. “I spent millenia after millenia down there, taking my punishment in stride, but he goes down there for two bloody seconds while I fix some things on Earth and suddenly Hell no longer needs a king.” Lucifer pulled three glasses and a bottle of scotch from the shelf. “Not that I’m complaining, of course. Would you like a drink, brother? Now that you have invaded my home, ruined my date, and insulted my intelligence.”
Castiel ran his thumb over the address Sam had given him, looking up for the third time to confirm that he was, in fact, at the right place; Dean might have called it “stalling,” but he called it “verifying his location.” He let out an unsteady sigh before finally pushing on the heavy doors that lead inward, resisting the urge to certify where he was for a fourth time. A woman—the receptionist, he presumed—looked up as the gust of air shuffled the papers on her desk, greeting him with a warm smile.
And then Dean turned his focus towards him, bordering on accusatory as he said, “No pouting at the dinner table.”
Dean continued to stare, and Castiel was about to try backpedaling again when Dean seemed to reboot, opening his mouth to reply when Sam beat him to it.
“What could be so outlandish that it had to wait until after the other two went to bed?” he asked, pulling on the ribbon.
“So you don’t have a favorite movie, or TV show, or...?”
that,” Castiel corrected a bit breathlessly, wiping at the blood on his face with the sleeve of his trench coat. Probably not the smartest, given he was doing laundry now and bloodstains were a bitch, but it was better than leaving it on his face.

“Great. It’ll be at six.”
“Amenadiel likes
He felt a small something blossom in his chest at that. She sounded damn convincing, and for a moment he dared to think that maybe,
Without time to process the bizarre encounter, Castiel flicked his head in the opposite direction, finding a short, kind-looking woman with cascading blond hair and glasses standing in the space between the lobby and the hall. Her small frame was shaped by an elegant blue dress and white cardigan, and she smiled at him with the warmth of a campfire, inviting him to greet her. He stood and made his way over, shaking her hand stiffly. Physical contact with strangers was probably his least favorite part about acting human, even if this one appeared harmless enough. “Yes.”
Cas’s face grew red with embarrassment. “I, uh, it’s supposed to say ‘happy birthday.’”
Castiel stood, wiping blood from his mouth where he had inadvertently bit his lip, and gave something akin to a laugh. “You know I’ve never listened to Michael.”
Linda gave a soft smile, but Castiel could see a hint of sadness flicker across her features. “Don’t feel bad on my behalf. It’s over and done with now.” She gestured toward him. “Lucky for me, I have friends in high—and low—places.”
“There is
Truthfully, he did wish that they could have an “us” that wasn’t marked by constant, unyielding peril. He rather liked the idea of camping for the fun of it—watching the stars travel across the sky as the night passed, listening to the crackle of a campfire with the smell of pine in his nose and a grin on his lips. Maybe if this case went well they could finish out the week with a few days of actually enjoying Petoskey, but he doubted it. He’d observed that the Winchesters weren’t very good at sitting still.

. TV show, movie, book, whatever...what did you say? ‘Human media?’” He gave a small laugh, signaling that, yes, that was what he had said. “Whatever piece of ‘human media’ tickles your fancy. And don’t tell me nothing does, because Amenadiel said the same thing but then I found him absolutely
They made him
(See the end of the chapter for
This was why there was a new contender for the most shocking thing to happen to Dean on the twenty-fourth day of January: Cas was already out of bed.
The tension in Castiel’s chest cracked, just a little bit, and he returned a genuine smile before setting off to find where Dean might be. Given that there was no case, and it was the middle of the day, Dean could be literally anywhere; if he knew what was good for him, he’d be eating lunch, but Dean wasn’t the kind of person to keep a consistent schedule. This point was proven when Castiel poked his head into the kitchen and found it empty, giving a small sigh and turning his attention to the second most likely place he would be.
an FBI agent—well, maybe you are. Lucifer is a civilian consultant, after all.”
as she took their orders: Castiel got a cheeseburger, per his usual modus operandi; Dean got a burger with too much stuff on it and a milkshake; and Sam got a burger that also had too much stuff on it that he further complicated by asking for no bun, and also a milkshake. Dean tried to goad Castiel into getting a milkshake, too, but he insisted that it was a waste of molecules he probably wouldn’t enjoy.
“Are you alright, Castiel?” she asked gently, taking a seat across from him as he flopped onto the couch.
And then he laughed bitterly, because Lucifer wasn’t even the problem, was he? Rebellion or not, Castiel couldn’t imagine a universe where he returned faithfully to Heaven after rescuing Dean from Hell. He just couldn’t. He had put too much of himself into Dean’s soul to leave, became too concerned with protecting him to care about the other commands he was meant to carry out. The Winchesters didn’t look at him like a war general—they looked at him like a friend, even though he didn’t deserve it, and he would betray Heaven again and again if it meant sharing beer over a dumb movie none of them cared about and eating cheeseburgers and laying awake in shitty motels looking at each other in the dark and laughing at nothing just to feel at ease.
“You certainly didn’t use to curse, either,” Lucifer grumbled, standing up again. “And, pardon me for being curious. I’ll have you know no one in Hell has ever suffered by my hand personally, but I would like to know what about two damned souls is so worth protecting to you.”
Truthfully, it didn’t taste any different than most of anything else, but his incredibly focused taste-test made Dean smile, so he didn’t mind.
“I don’t want to have this conversation right now,” Castiel said flatly.
“Why do you feel the need to apologize?” Linda asked, her voice light and delicate.
“I have been better,” he admitted. “I made some...reckless decisions, which lead to a bit of spiraling.”
Castiel’s lips twitched into a small smile at Lucifer’s genuine-sounding apology, even if he wouldn’t accept it. Not yet. “I’m your little brother. It’s my job to terrorize you.” And then he stood up, deciding to leave before the encounter could completely sour again. “I should best be on my way, then.”
Clearly, Lucifer had taught his therapist a little too much about the family sass.
“I dunno, non-stop flying on wings that we weren’t even sure worked a month ago seems to fit that category pretty well.”
“Well, yes. That is the purpose of a washing machine, and I’ve been told it’s bad for the environment to run it for singular articles of clothing.”
Castiel sat back down slowly, cautiously, eyeing her with a careful wariness. “I’m not? The first celestial you’ve met, I mean.”
“I am

He was practically begging, which would have embarrassed him at any other time but right now he was so desperate to
“Thought you were all ‘bout exercise,” Dean replied around another mouthful of burger. Castiel snickered a little, because it was nice to finally have something to laugh at, before taking a bite of his own cheeseburger with a content sigh.
He couldn’t even finish the thought, swallowing thickly. He wasn’t a soldier of Heaven anymore, and Dean
He turned back towards Sam and Dean, and the latter smirked at him. “What?”
As the day progressed beyond breakfast, Dean was finding it harder and harder to hide his disbelief at just how much they had actually done for his birthday. Jack had forced them all into kitschy plastic cowboy hats the moment Dean had finished his pancakes, and then promptly dragged them all down to the Dean Cave where he proceeded to eagerly push presents with paw print wrapping paper into Dean’s hands. The first two had been from Sam, who had gotten him a cookbook—a normal one, thankfully, none of his weird “paleo” nonsense—and a beginner’s guide to guitar, so he could finally “learn to play the one hanging on the wall instead of leaving it untouched forever like some elitist rock and roll asshole.” Cas had gone next, much to Jack’s chagrin, and had gotten him an espresso machine to replace the dingy coffee maker in the kitchen. Dean had pointed out that it seemed more like a gift for
“Consider: I enjoy a milkshake and a burger, and then I have a lot more patience to clean up the monster mess. ‘Sides,” he continued, “they aren’t stupid enough to take people in broad daylight, and the sun’ll still be up by the time we get there. Plenty of time to investigate.”
Castiel frowned. “I’m
“It’s very gross of him, is what it is,” Sam corrected, taking a dainty sip of his own milkshake—
“‘Were’ able to?” She frowned, but it seemed more perfunctory than out of genuine confusion. “You didn’t drive twenty hours for a therapy session, did you?”
He left the room, and Castiel gave a small, amused huff in his direction. Finding a therapist in Kansas probably
he was upset about. Lucifer, obviously, but the specifics of his agitation eluded him. The movie night with the Winchesters had been nice, sans the weird look Sam had given him when he had seen his black eye, but after the movie had ended and both brothers had fallen asleep Castiel had just felt...
He chewed his lip. He
Their food came out a short while later, complete with their cardboard cars and another tease about Dean’s eyes, and the Winchesters promptly dove right in. Castiel, on the other hand, focused his attention on watching Dean’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed, tilting his head slightly with curiosity before covering it up by finally taking a bite of his own cheeseburger. His gaze inevitably flicked back up at the sound of their waitress returning, though, watching Dean’s jaw work as he thanked Jolene and threw another flirt in her direction.
Castiel, would you.” It wasn’t a question so much as an accusation, and Castiel stood up abruptly, muscles tensing.

“Jerk.”
the principle of the thing.” Dean’s eyes flicked up to the rearview mirror again. “Any thoughts from our resident angel?”
“Apologies,” Castiel muttered, casting his gaze downward and taking another bite of his meal to avoid talking.
that’s not the kind of self-description I’m asking for here, Castiel.”
Castiel mulled over that for a moment, trying to figure out how to phrase the situation without including mentions of his frail divinity. “Most injuries are...simple. Need a couple stitches, maybe, but typically don’t run deep enough to be of any serious consequence. This one had the potential to be unfixable.”
but it certainly eased him a bit. With that, he relaxed into the rest of their conversation, absentmindedly planning out the next week in his head.
“Would you
Linda gave him a rude smile. Well, maybe it was only rude because Castiel didn’t want her looking at him like that, like nothing he could do would change her mind about pressing the issue. So much for drawing attention away from himself. “You know which family I’m referring to, Castiel. Your avoidance of the topic tells me you have some deep-rooted issues with your biological relationships, so, if you’re done having your eldritch temper tantrum, I’d like to talk about that.”
to do.”
“Of course.” She didn’t seem at all shocked, instead jotting something else down and transitioning back into their previous point of discussion. “This ‘reaction’ you had to your injured coworker seems to be the inciting incident for your visit with me today. I imagine that in your line of work, injuries received on the job are not uncommon; what made this one different?”
“Dean,” Castiel said easily. “And Sam.”
Sam, who was mid-process of removing the tarnished top pancake, glowered at him.
“What, you like listening to me slurp down a milkshake?”
sore and irritable, because he couldn’t drive and that meant any time he wanted to leave he had to use his wings. He was amazed he hadn’t lost them completely, and with the constant abuse he was putting them through it wouldn’t be long before they were shot to hell and essentially useless anyway.
To his surprise, Sam laughed, looking back up from his computer with a certain amount of amusement dancing across his features.
“Pancakes, huh?”
The fallen angel sighed, shaking his head. “It’s different, for me.”
“You have to make a wish,” he instructed.
Cas finally stood up and faced him, grinning. He looked...different, but Dean chalked it up to the pancake mix smeared on his nose and dusting his hair. “Yes, though I wouldn’t recommend eating the top one now. Jack got confetti on it.”
“Get a
“But I’m not—”
“Would that second coworker happen to be the ‘Sam’ you mention in your preliminary forms?”
who was responsible in large part—if not in full—for the Winchesters’ traumatic bouts in Hell. How the fuck was he supposed to mesh those two things together nicely? The short answer was that he couldn't, but that wasn’t an acceptable answer, so he was stuck pondering.
Linda tilted her head like a disappointed mother as she gave a deep sigh, but otherwise didn’t seem at all surprised, confirming Castiel’s suspicions. “So it
“Not much to talk about,” he growled. “We don’t like each other.”
And so now he was here, because Sam was usually right about things that might be helpful.
to do?”
“You’ve been thinking for too long,” Linda said, not unkindly. “It’s clear to me that you care deeply about the Winchesters, and they care very deeply about you. However, it isn’t fair to you if they’re isolating you on the basis that—”
Finally finding the bottle, he squeezed a glob onto the dark stain marring his now-damp tie, massaging it in with his finger. And then he got pissed off, because the stain wasn’t letting up, and swiped a towel from the shelf of them nearby to scrub it more vigorously.
“He does. They both do.” Linda chuckled. “Took them long enough to get together, but they’re both better for it.”
Dean grinned at him, appearing slightly bemused. “What, you wan' me to clean it?”
.” She shifted in her seat, now just looking slightly concerned. “Please tell me I’m not introducing a new concept to you.”
For now, he had the case as an excuse: he couldn’t leave Dean and Sam alone in the middle of the woods with a bunch of vampires, could he? But once this case was over and they were settled back in Lebanon, he really would have no reason
“I was busy!” Castiel protested in self-defense. “We picked up a case, so I spent the week doing
“Try again.”
Dean gave a fleeting smile, eyes flicking down to the blade and back again, before he breathlessly added, “‘hind ya, Cas.”
Jack prompted eagerly, and Dean chuckled.
“No need to martyr yourself,” Sam teased, taking a pointed bite of his burger patty. “You do enough of that already.”
“I can see that,” she replied patiently. “From how your brothers have described it, the family politics of Heaven seem...strained, at best.”
I think it’ll help.”
“Yes, but I

“Best molecules you’ll ever have, I swear.”

“And what about Amenadiel?”

something. Having an infinite amount of it just means that when one wound heals, another replaces it. Celestial beings get bored. They fight because peace grows stale after thousands of years. If the apocalypse were to come—”
“Hey now, that’s different,” Dean argued, watching as Sam set aside the confettied pancake for when one of them would inevitably scrape off the paper bits and feed it to Miracle, who was sitting patiently at Cas’s feet. Jack took the opportunity to lean forward and eagerly spray the remaining stack with whipped cream, and Sam stuck a candle in the middle.
“Careful,” Cas warned, and his heart was racing again, “or I’ll give you the rest of it to wash, too.”
. He had a weird desire to be
Castiel shrugged again. “Whatever the Winchesters want to watch. I’m not picky.”
Castiel leaned forward, resting his hands on the table.
Beating up the people who wronged him was therapeutic, but he had been told that was not
It continued on like that for a while, banter and burgers and a general good time. When he knew Dean wasn’t looking, Castiel stole glances in his direction, watching him gesture animatedly with a fry or roll his eyes at some wisecrack by Sam. It was almost easy to forget that he had nearly bled out a few days prior when he looked so
Dean reappeared, bag of ice in hand, and Castiel stuffed the notebook and pen back into his pocket. He would still be pissed at Lucifer in twenty years, let alone the five minutes talking to Dean would take; finishing the entry could wait.
“Sam, what is ‘homework?’”
“She seems nice,” Castiel commented, hoping for further input.
“Part of building meaningful relationships is allowing ourselves to feel vulnerable,” Linda continued, undeterred by his less than enthusiastic response. “The ability to let our guard down around those close to us is an important and needed part of being human.”
He didn’t wait for an answer, turning back to Baby’s open hood and beginning to poke around at things Castiel was pretty confident didn’t need to be poked at.
“And what do you do in-between cases?”
Castiel returned to the hotel room he was sharing with the Winchesters to find it curiously devoid of Dean, which immediately spiked some amount of what he was learning was “concern” in his chest. Sam was sprawled on one of the two beds, looking the opposite of that as he scrolled through something on his laptop, when he heard the door click and unclick with Castiel’s entrance. He glanced up, smiling when he saw his friend standing in the entry hall, hands in his pockets in typical Castiel fashion.
The constant motion that made Dean Winchester Dean Winchester halted, and he ducked back out to look at Castiel with an expression caught halfway between apologetic and angry. “Am I wrong, Cas? I haven’t seen you more than twice since you almost ate shit Saturday.”
rebellion maybe they still would be.
To his surprise, Linda appeared to take his story in relative stride, and he wondered if either of his brothers had ever expressed similar sentiments to her. He could still see the pity gathering in her eyes, but it didn’t hinder her interrogation. “What will convince you that it isn’t?”
He must have reflected his shitty week in his demeanor, because as he walked into Linda’s office she seemed to drop into a state more calm than the bubbly woman he had conversed with at his first two sessions (though, he guessed his last session didn’t really count, considering he had stormed out after about five minutes).

something dumb like running into a telephone pole, or crashing into the sidewalk. “Sam made dinner tonight, unfortunately, so there's probably nothin' you'd like. We were gonna put on one of the Bourne movies, though, if you wanted to grab a beer and join?”
“...are points of vulnerability for you?”
“We’re not done yet. Shoo,” Cas said without looking up, but Dean could see a grin crinkling his features, so he shoved the pistol into his waistband and leaned against the wall of the entryway.
He scoffed.
“Listen, Maze...”
“What’s her real name?” Castiel asked suddenly. Linda furrowed her eyebrows, clearly not following. “Detective,” he clarified.
The million-dollar question.
“My first mission on the newly created Earth was to chastise Aziraphale for discussing Heavenly matters with a demon, especially when he was
Dean immediately looked concerned. “You okay? Do we need to wait a—”

He didn’t even know. “Just tired.”
fault, not theirs, and what energy he did have was going to his tensing muscles to bolt if Linda continued to press.
“Yes, that sounds most sensible,” Castiel confirmed. Linda nodded, clicking away at her computer for a few more seconds before closing the lid and looking back up.
“Sounds great.”
“He’s

an experience I want to repeat, woo boy.” She gave a chuckle, like the whole ordeal was over and just something to laugh at now, but Castiel could see her obvious discomfort at the subject.
“No, but if the King of Hell’s personal entourage is here I can make a rather well-informed guess.” He scowled.
“Happy birthday Dean!” Jack yelled, taking a fistful of confetti out of his pocket and throwing it up into the air. The confetti that already littered the floor suggested he had been practicing for this moment all morning, and Dean let out a laugh.

“Well...because! He’s
“Whatever, man. I’ll wash your stupid tie.”
“As I told Dean, that is my only method of getting to therapy, which, might I remind you, was

“Not shocking,” Castiel agreed. Hearing someone talk so casually about Lucifer made him feel...well, maybe not
It had taken a few day’s worth of poking and prodding, but the park rangers had finally coughed up the trail along which the attacks had been happening like a particularly nasty hairball, and now there they were.

“I, uh...had religious parents,” he explained nervously. “Have. Especially my dad.”
The diner Dean had picked out was marked by bubblegum pink siding with teal trim, which naturally stood out starkly against the surrounding buildings, and a flickering sign bearing a graphic of an older car with the same pink hue. It was easy to see why he had attached himself to this place in particular—Castiel wasn’t very good at differentiating between any decades before the early 2000s, but whatever decade this diner’s decor had pulled from, it was very Dean.
had a staring problem.”
“Bitch.”
He looked over his shoulder hopefully, finding that Sam’s quiet simmering had been replaced by a dopey grin.
He shook his head and left, walking down the block to find a bus station.
If he had been anyone else, his emotions probably would’ve stopped at “shock” and he would’ve just gotten up to go find him like a normal person. But, he was not anyone else, so instead “shock” progressed into “panic” and he grabbed the pistol from his nightstand drawer as he shot to his feet. He had enough clothes on not to offend anyone who might be lurking the halls, so he crept out of his room, following the sound of quiet chatter all the way to the kitchen with the pistol held flush against his hip.
in Lucifer’s penthouse, not fighting with him but simply chatting on the Italian leather couch over drinks, which should have sounded ludicrous but actually inspired some small amount of comfort in him. Maybe it was the fact that Lucifer was the first of his siblings he had seen in a long time that hadn’t immediately tried to kill or otherwise manipulate him, and it was a nice break. As much as he cared for the Winchesters, there were certain things they would never understand, things that Lucifer...would.
“Seriously, Cas. Did we do something to piss you off?”
“Well, I’m not going to. I forged this path on my own, and I will continue down it as such.”
take place [I say, having also added a
Linda tilted her head, considering. “Oftentimes, we repress our emotions when we feel it is unsafe to express them, due to a fear of being judged or punished. Allowing your emotions to ‘develop,’ as you have phrased it, could be an indication that you are in a position where you feel you can be vulnerable.”
That was how Dean had found himself routinely waking up to a snoring not-angel pressed into his shoulder, his arm occasionally looped around his waist as he radiated warmth like some kind of once-divine heater. They never started out that way; Dean would very pointedly start the night out on the left, and Cas on the right, but they always woke up entangled somewhere in the middle. It wasn’t helped by the fact that human-Cas slept like a—well, to say “corpse” would be morbid, but it was the truth. It was pointless trying to hold a conversation with him in the morning unless he had had at least two cups of coffee, and dragging him out of bed to
. “Muted, skeletal versions, I guess you could describe them. Bare essentials. But, since choosing to stay, they’ve grown. Insurmountably, at times.” He gave a wry chuckle, once again thinking of his most recent conversation with Sam. “Logically speaking, then, the conclusion is that as long as I am here, I will have them, and I have no intention of leaving.”
“I’m fine, Dean,” Castiel grunted, and took a very deliberate bite of his quickly diminishing distraction. Sam kicked his leg lightly under the table.

to have. She seemed to think he was right there, on the edge of it, but he felt no such development imminent; just the renewed urge to break his brother’s nose.

call me that,” he hissed, but Lucifer just waved his hand dismissively, lifting his glass to his lips as he bumped against Detective. “Fucking prick” is what Castiel imagined Dean would say in response to that, so he let the words fall out of his mouth, too, before vanishing from the penthouse.
“Your name,” she began, narrowing her eyes knowingly. “It’s a very uncommon one, I’d wager. Very...

was the driver—”
Castiel looked at his hands. That was comforting to know.
“When we were created in Heaven,” Lucifer began to explain briefly, looking at Detective with a certain affection that Castiel couldn’t name, “we were given a form to parade around in on Earth. That’s how you see me, or Amenadiel. If that form were to be destroyed, one would need a capable human vessel to leave Heaven—or Hell. Take my mother, for example. Or,” and he gave that
Linda wrote something down and then tapped her pen against the clipboard thoughtfully, looking at her notes before looking back up at Castiel. “We started this session with a discussion of vulnerability, which you dismissed as a possibility for your newfound emotions. Is it possible that these coworkers, Sam and...”
“How kind of you to remember me,” Castiel replied, avoiding the question, as he had gotten so skilled at doing. He halted his advance and gave a wry smile, taking in the sight of Lucifer after centuries of him existing only in his unreliable and patchy memory (the multiple wipes he had undergone certainly weren’t doing his celestial hippocampus any good). “Thought that you might have forgotten me after all these years,” Castiel finally continued, tender gaze turning to analysis of Lucifer’s weak points. “I certainly look different.”
“To understand both what and why you are feeling,” she explained, “it could be useful to note descriptions of what emotions you experience and when. For example, you felt panicked when your coworker—Dean—was injured, but felt relieved when things turned out alright in the end.” Castiel began to nod in understanding, accepting the notebook and letting his hands fall back into his lap, finding comfort in absentmindedly thumbing the journal’s corner. “It may resolve some of your confusion, and give us talking points for our next session. Consider it therapy homework.”
“How long until forgiveness runs dry, Doctor?” he asked finally, studying her coldly. It wasn’t a direct answer to her question, but it seemed fitting regardless. She stayed quiet, so he figured whatever it was he was doing it was working. “You humans like to say that time heals all wounds, but you are also given the gift of a measured existence, where time
around them,” Linda surmised. “I can imagine you wouldn’t have chosen to stay in Kansas if that was the case—assuming they are also part of living in Kansas.”
Castiel was interrupted in his writings by the feeling of a heavy presence standing over him, and he looked up, disquieted. A woman dressed in tight leather was walking past him, dark brown hair hanging loosely down around her exposed shoulders. The shift caught her attention and she narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously, as if sensing the same strangeness he did, before continuing out the door.
“They’re
Between his talk with Dean on Wednesday and his therapy session on Saturday, Castiel had mostly managed to pull himself out of whatever hole talking to Lucifer had dropped him in. Dean and Sam had thankfully left well enough alone, not asking so much where he had been but more so just giving him hints that they were glad he was done leaving for the time being. On Thursday evening, they had gotten wind of a potential case and settled back into their normal routine of research and cross referencing, ultimately deciding that it could be worth it to haul ass out to Petoskey, Michigan and investigate up close. At present, they had plans to leave Sunday morning, which Castiel definitely knew to be Sam trying not to interfere with his therapy appointment. It was a kind gesture, but an unnecessary one. He was fine.

In the middle of the night.
“Ah,” Dean replied just as simply. “Well, easy solution is you get a therapist in Kansas.” His hand hovered next to Cas’s jaw, frowning. “Didya run into a telephone poll or something? I mean, Jesus, Cas, let me get you some ice.”
“Yes,” he confirmed, a bit startled by the instant recognition. He stood awkwardly in the entryway until the receptionist beckoned him forward, pushing a clipboard across the large desk she sat at as he stepped tentatively towards her.
about him had changed, but that didn’t mean it was enough, or that Castiel was willing to receive his apologies with open arms—Lucifer had still been the King of Hell (and a shitty one at that, who had let innocent people get hurt time and time again), and he had still abandoned Castiel for the sake of a rebellion. Castiel wasn’t exactly eager to think too much about any of it; bitterness was easier.
“What are you thinking about, Castiel?” Linda asked then, head tilted as she looked at him curiously. Her eyes bore a knowingness that Castiel hated, but it undid him at the same time, and before he could stop himself he softly said,
He needed time to recover but he wasn’t given any, forcing himself to his feet to stop another vampire attempting to rip the veins from his body. What was that, three now? Four? Fuck, how many were there?

had interacted with her and he hadn’t. He hadn’t seen or even really thought about his mother in several millennia, not since God had condemned her to Hell. It had been for good reason, and he truthfully hadn’t even missed her that much, but...
“Because I love you,” Cas answered, tone matter-of-fact like it was the most natural and obvious thing in the entire world, “and I want you to know that I’m not going anywhere.”
She yelped in surprise, pulling what Castiel could make out as a gun as she shouted, “L.A.P.D., put your hands up!”

there,” Castiel growled, irises flashing. Lucifer raised his eyebrows at the display of ferocity, and Castiel’s loving contempt for Lucifer’s shenanigans melted into a new anger as he remembered Dean’s face pale and slick with sweat after waking up in a state of terror. Castiel had pretended he didn’t remember it when morning had rolled around, because he figured Dean didn’t want to talk about how his friend had comforted him after a nightmare anyway, but that didn’t mean it hadn’t happened and that it wasn’t Lucifer’s fault. “Shitty demon deals, probably because you were
Instead, she just sighed, giving him the sense that he had won—for now, at least. “Alright. I’ll let it go for the time being. But,” and her expression turned therapist-y again, “it truly is okay to put yourself first sometimes, Castiel. You are as much a person they are, which is why I’m pushing you so hard to figure out your identity as an

“Then make a small miracle,” Linda said, like it really was that simple. “Your distrust is not irrational, certainly, and I don’t fault you for being afraid.” Castiel moved to argue that he was
Despite this, he imagined they would have spent most of the early day lounging around Chicago—the latter half of their trip amounting to only (relatively-speaking) around five or six hours—if he hadn’t shown so much blatant discontentment for the place. He felt almost bad for ushering them out so quickly; Dean had seemed quite taken by the bright lights and loud music playing at every street corner, and had kept going on about “Chicago-style pizza,” whatever that meant. Maybe the brothers could drive home without him, and as they enjoyed a break in Chicago he could deal with the emotions waiting for him in Los Angeles.
“I am...good with a blade.”
He flipped to the next page, finding the questions to be much more manageable than those on the first, so he started there instead.
It was Wednesday when the exhaustion from his endlessly looping thoughts finally got to him, and in attempting to wake himself up with the black sludge Dean called coffee he spilled it all over his tie. Bemoaning the fact that even stupid human tasks were now getting the best of him, he dragged his feet all the way to the laundry room, undoing his tie and dumping it in the sink unceremoniously as he searched for the bottle of dish soap that was usually nearby. He didn’t understand why
“I have no vulnerabilities,” Castiel said, confused. “It is not a matter of repression and expression, Dr. Martin—Linda. It is a matter of these feelings coming into existence, and I am seeking your counsel in hopes of finding an explanation for them.”
“Do come again, Cassie,” he said, and Castiel bristled.
“It doesn’t matter,” he tried. “I already told you. Dean and Sam are my family. I don’t need anyone else.”
“I can assure you there is nothing trivial about human existence.”
“I am...” and then he huffed and gave up. “This is hardly fair, Doctor. My entire reason for being on Earth
“Okay, like hell it is. What’s going on?”
“How exactly
“What, you’re not gonna hand me mine, too?” Sam said accusingly, closing his laptop and setting it to the side as he stood up to grab his own dinner.
“Any chance y’all would be down to just have a nice conversation instead?” Dean asked the darkness, and Castiel wanted to smack him.
be a smarter decision than continuing to fly back and forth across the country and wrecking his stamina, but what were the odds he was going to find a celestially-educated therapist anywhere else?
“You had a panic attack,” she clarified, once it was clear Castiel was not going to be independently forthcoming of much else.
Wait.
to think about. The idea of meeting up with Lucifer again hadn’t seemed so daunting when he was just musing about the prospect in Linda’s office, talking about “family” and “small miracles,” but now that he actually had to
“Right.” Linda looked down at her notes, doing that thing where she tapped her pen against the clipboard contemplatively whilst preparing some accurate but brutal call-out, and then she looked back up. “We’re talking ourselves in circles, Castiel, and I think this speaks to a larger issue of you not having an identity outside of the Winchesters.”
“Not as far as I can tell,” Sam replied, swiping through the rest of whatever article he was reading. “It looks like they just posted more warnings: always hike in groups, keep track of the food you have on-site, things like that.”
Castiel shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “Wouldn’t be us if there wasn’t the threat of impending doom.”
cheeky grin again, “Castiel. Is
“I don’t eat,” Castiel grunted. Setting the bottle of soap down by the faucet, he turned back towards Sam with the wet tie in hand, raising it up pointedly. He had gotten most of the coffee out, and the rest would have to be the work of OxiClean and a good wash. “When are you doing laundry next?”

Linda said, face falling just slightly. “Especially considering you’re here, in the same city as them.”

“I’m not surprised. They’re attached at the hip, more often than not.”
“I’m glad! Speaking of next sessions,” Linda stood up and walked back to her desk, opening her computer and typing for a few moments before continuing, “when would you like next time to be?”
Castiel raised his eyebrows, surprised that she had remembered the man’s name. “He is doing well. Our case here was resolved, and we were able to head back to Kansas safely two days ago.”
He gave her a small nod and a smile before sitting down in one of the lobby chairs, crossing his legs while his foot bounced idly. The lobby itself wasn’t very large, furnished only by a couple of chairs and side-tables, all varying shades of beige or green. There was a mini-fridge at one end, with a water-cooler and what looked like a plate of cookies to accompany it, but considering Castiel didn’t like the taste of most things he let his eyes flick back to the form he had been given. He started scanning the first page, snorting as he realized he didn’t have answers to half the questions asked, if not less. He had told Sam that he wanted to go alone, but now he was musing that he probably
“If I tell you, it isn’t gonna come true,” he pointed out, and Jack pouted at him before deciding that finding the secret box of Lucky Charms Dean had bought for him against Sam’s wishes was a better use of his time.
“It’s only different because it’s
“Oh! No need to worry about the forms. This is plenty, thank you.” She nodded at him with a pleasant smile, and then returned to her call. Castiel furrowed his eyebrows and tilted his head, going to say that he hadn’t even filled out the first and arguably most pertinent page, but Linda was too involved in whatever conversation she was having to notice that he was still standing there.
Castiel wished he had that dumb little cardboard car.
he said then, voice hoarse and more than slightly choked as he watched vibrant indigos and cornflower blues swirl lazily against the glass.
“How did your visit with Lucifer go?” Linda asked, and her piercing gaze made Castiel wonder if she already knew he hadn’t gone through with their plans from last session. Chewing his lip, he tried to think of an adequate response, settling (
“Hush,” Castiel reprimanded, and Dean joined the quiet of the night without a word. There was a crunch behind him, and before either Winchester could react Castiel spun around and sawed the head off the last vampire with the practiced efficiency of a being as old as time itself.
“Cas?” Sam said from behind him, and Castiel stifled an irritated grunt. He didn’t have the patience to talk to anyone at the moment, least of all Sam “you shouldn’t bottle up your emotions blah blah blah” Winchester. “Hey, man. You’ve been in and out a lot the past couple of days. Everything alright?”

by a little mishap. Nothing much, of course, but Sam thought it prudent enough to sit him down and ask if he was okay. He was fine, really. It was his vessel at fault, he had consoled, but Sam had simply shaken his head and handed him the phone number for the office of one Dr. Linda Martin. “Only if you want to,” he had added, patting his shoulder in an unusual act of comfort, “but I think it might help.”
“She’s not—Jesus, dude, why you gotta say things like that?” Dean shifted, clearly uncomfortable now that the attention was turned back to him. “She started it, may I remind you. Forgive me for entertaining someone at their nine-to-five.”
“‘Bobcat.’ Jesus. Did they close down the campground?”
Dean knelt down next to him again and gingerly pressed the ice to his swollen jaw, giving a near-imperceptible frown as Cas flinched in pain.
Or, at least, trying to seem fine.
“Take a seat,” Linda said, gesturing towards the couch while she took a seat in the chair opposite it and the table. Castiel did as instructed while she did a quick flip-through of the paperwork in her hands, explaining, “I like to start my introductory sessions by reviewing these forms, as a way to ease into conversation.” The papers fell back against the clipboard, and she pulled a pen out of her pocket. “I noticed that you simply wrote 'having emotions’ for why you decided to reach out to a therapist. Could you elaborate on that?”
Dean flicked his ear and stood up, fixing him with a look of equal parts relief and irritation. “You told me you weren’t gonna do dumb shit like fly around.”
Before he could answer, Lucifer spoke, readjusting his cufflinks as he did so. “Yes, he is. Did Michael put you up to this?”
“I...suppose I assumed you
Castiel stood, cocking his head with amusement at the weapon as he walked towards them. “Your bullets will do me no harm.”

desire from your time on Earth?”
Castiel frowned, pouring himself a glass of water to keep busy even though he knew he wouldn’t drink it. This dialogue had always been inevitable—it’s why he was there in the first place, after all—but that didn’t make him feel any more prepared. “A couple of days ago, I experienced a...call it a work-related dilemma,” he started, drumming his fingers on the glass as he sat back into the couch. “One of my...
“You have the chance to have some of both, Castiel,” Linda pointed out, voice still gentle. “Lucifer and Amenadiel are both here, on Earth, and evidently you don’t like it when I compare you to them but—between you and me—they feel the same way. About humanity, Heaven, all of it.”
Dean corrected. Cas rolled his eyes again.
“Yes, that you d—”
“They do, but I don’t have a preference. I usually just pick something Dean likes, because if I tell him to pick instead he gets all huffy about me not taking our decision order seriously.”
She tilted her head thoughtfully. “That may be Lucifer’s fault, though.”
“Hello, Dean.”
The tension in his chest knit itself back together, and he felt irrationally angry. Why did they even want him to stay? He couldn’t even get coffee out of his tie without being a nuisance, let alone be useful on whatever actual case they were about to pick up because the sheer thought of being helpless as Dean bled out again had made him puke twice in the past week. He hadn’t even known he possessed the
“And done. You can always call or email me if you need to reschedule.” She smiled, going to open the door. “It was wonderful meeting you, Castiel. I look forward to seeing you next week.”
“Oookay. Is there any particular reason you decided to seek out therapy while on business, rather than waiting until you returned to Kansas? Something to do with this idea of ‘insurmountability,’ perhaps?”
“How else am I supposed to get to therapy?” Castiel asked, folding his arms across his chest defiantly. Dean’s eyes widened a little, as if in surprise, and Castiel guessed that Sam hadn’t told him about his new extracurricular activity. “Sam’s idea,” he elaborated simply. The “as a result of my panic attack” bit went unsaid, but Castiel saw the recognition pass across Dean’s face.
tell her he had had two more of what she and Sam called “panic attacks,” which would likely lead to some introspection he really was too tired to deal with at the moment, or he could blatantly lie and say he was doing great.
So instead he just shrugged, finishing off his burger and licking his fingers clean for emphasis. “The fact that you find so much joy in blended milk, ice cream, and strawberries—”
“Your visit to Lucifer,” Linda guessed.
Castiel gaped. He had no concept of a schedule, ever.
he exhaled quietly, fingers hovering on the box flap as he met Cas’s eyes. The warm blues were peering back at him with the same intensity as always, rocking seas focused on him and him alone. “I can’t accept this.”
“Yeah.” Another pause. “Dean’s making dinner tonight. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind cooking for three instead of two.”
Sam just shook his head with a small chuckle, turning to his computer once again. Castiel didn’t stop him this time, instead beginning to rummage through the stock magazines on Dean’s nightstand to find something to read. He found a

in danger?
“Fucking—” Castiel gasped, slamming a vampire that had attempted to claw at his neck into the ground. It went limp, definitely no longer living, but the ones that had been flanking it didn’t seem to get the hint. “—do you always have to taunt them, Dean?”
“You know me,” Cas answered, smiling slightly. “Picking fights, placing bets.”
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. He thought he looked relatively put together, all things considered, and he wasn’t quite sure how to respond to the idea that he might not appear as he thought he did. Thumbing the journal in his pocket again, he was about to respond when Lucifer beat him to it.
“Friendship goes both ways, you know,” Dean muttered, but he relented, loudly slurping his milkshake. It was a very Dean thing to do, and Cas found himself snickering a little despite himself. Dean raised an eyebrow.
Linda tilted her head. She had that sad look again, and he had to look away because it was too much. “Do you really think that?”
[Side note: I start school again this week, so while I’ll still try to upload every Saturday I may switch to just uploading the chapters as I finish them if I can’t keep up.]
But a fear still lurked in the back of his mind, a nasty feeling that it would all come back to bite him if he dared to trust them. Linda must have picked up on his doubts, because she started speaking again.
“I did,” Dean answered. “It just came true.”
Sam?” he snarled, a bit more aggressively than he meant to, and he turned back to the sink and his tie to avoid making eye contact. Softening his tone, he continued, “I appreciate your concern, but I am honestly fine. It was never a big deal in the first place, and you
afraid, but that would have been a blatant lie, so he closed his mouth and let his therapist continue. “But I would be remiss if I didn’t also point out that Lucifer and Amenadiel didn’t have a relationship when they first came here, either.” She gave a small laugh, shaking her head. “I actually met Amenadiel under false pretenses whilst he was trying to send Lucifer back to Hell.” Castiel watched in near-disbelief as a genuine fondness took over her features, listening to her reminisce. She caught him staring, and she turned that same fondness towards him. “I genuinely think you could have them in your life, if you want them.”
Sam’s voice was flatter now, almost passive aggressive. “You’d have to ask Dean. He’s on laundry duty for this week.”
man,” he chided, “and let Jack put the whipped cream on first.” Dean rolled his eyes but drew his hand back obediently, fixing his gaze on Cas as he waited for an answer.
Her name tag, pinned to a white apron tied around a pink dress cut off at the knee, denoted her as “Jolene.” With a wink and a smile, she seemed to capture Dean’s full attention, slipping in compliments about his face, his hair, his
“Would you...like dinner?”
Dean winked at him through the mirror before turning his focus back to the road, and Castiel grunted. It always bugged him when Dean did that; it made his insides turn to mush and he didn’t understand why, despite having had some thirteen hours in the car to think about it by that point. They had driven for about ten and a half until hitting Chicago, where Dean had thrown up his hands saying he couldn’t drive any further without a nap and they had consequently decided to check into a hotel for the night. While the Winchesters had slept, Castiel had discovered that he hated Chicago—compared to the peace and quiet of their typical small-town adventures, it was harsh, grating, and the wind that had earned the city its nickname always carried the vaguest smell of trash that should have been taken out at least a week ago.
“Very. Did you meet her?”
Castiel scowled. “...fun.”
“...Castiel?” Lucifer asked with uncertainty, furrowing his eyebrows as he stepped in front of who Castiel was now surmising to be the officer he consulted for. “Ha! I almost didn’t recognize you. What brings you to Los Angeles?”
idea.”
Lucifer scolded petulantly, and then his voice grew almost soft—as soft as the Devil’s voice could be, anyway. “And, I’m sorry, for whatever your friends had to go through. I’ll admit that even when I
That added a whole new layer to this mess that Castiel was not ready to deal with. Instead, he forced himself to stand up and looked pointedly at the liquor bottle in Lucifer’s hand. It shattered, spraying scotch and glass everywhere. Lucifer swore loudly, and Castiel smirked—it appeared his messy grace was still good for wreaking small havocs.
“Dean went to get dinner,” he explained before Castiel could ask. Castiel frowned.
“Yeah. That,” Castiel grunted. This seemed like a fantastic time to draw attention away from himself, so that’s exactly what he did. “He’s as much of an ass as he ever was. Though I must admit, I am a bit dumbfounded to see what he’s been doing with his life.” He leaned back, crossing his legs. “I figured he had come up to Earth to expand his realm of sin, tempting wayward souls down paths that would end in Hell. But he’s just...solving crime. And in a relationship.” He started gesturing wildly. “It has to be a ruse, right? I mean—
“Unprecedented how?”
if it hadn’t been easier then.
“‘Earthly form?’”
“Yes, she was,” Linda said gently. And then with a dark, almost sad laugh added, “Rotisseried me like a chicken, I’m afraid.”
“So you reacted in a way driven by terror, which was new to you because such strong feelings are not something you are accustomed to experiencing.”
No one had to know that his hands were trembling as he did it.
“I’m not going ask what ‘case’ you’re referring to, because I honestly don’t have the mental stamina for new celestial information today, but why was it so important you tagged along?”
Jack stuck his tongue out at him, turning to the fridge to pull out a carton of orange juice. Dean crossed over to where the three were standing by the kitchen island, positioning himself across from them and eyeing the syrupy pancakes as he rested his elbows on the counter. He could vaguely make out what was maybe a “y” near the bottom of the top pancake, but it was even harder to read now that it was flecked with colorful paper bits.
“The laundry room sink,” he answered, watching Dean. He chewed the inside of his cheek. “Sam told me you were making dinner.”
“Not in technical terms, no,” Linda amended, “but from what I understand, the emotional capacity of most celestial beings is limited. You experience feelings like us silly humans do—”
“How was I supposed to tempt Adam and Eve without a distraction?”
really—had had contact when one of them wasn’t injured or dying. Maybe he had looked like he was dying.
“Besides, as riveting as that story was, that’s not what I meant. You have a newfound concern for humanity, brother, one I wouldn’t expect from the ever-diligent ‘Angel of the Lord Castiel.’” Lucifer leaned forward, elbows resting on the counter as he smirked. “What, fall in love with a human?”
“Don’t talk about my mother,” Castiel hissed, but there was no true venom in it. He did miss her. He missed all of it. He missed when trivial pranks were the extent of what his family would wage on each other, when his father had commended the way he and Gabriel had arranged the stars in the sky, when Lucifer who had been Samael would hum and Castiel would start humming with him. They had never been perfect, but they had been
“I’m so glad to hear that,” Linda replied, appearing genuinely pleased. Seeming to realize that Castiel wasn’t likely to divulge information unless prompted, she then asked, “How is Dean doing?”
“You can’t wait until we’re in Petoskey?” Sam poked, and from what Castiel could tell he was still thumbing through articles on his phone. “The longer we delay getting there, the more of a mess we’re going to have to clean up.”

you are feeling, or what?”
Castiel whirled around and met what he was hoping was the last vampire, grabbing it by the collar and violently throwing it back. It slammed into the ground, and after a few tense moments where it didn’t move, Castiel heard the Winchesters relax. He turned back to look at them, trying to hide the fact that his heart was racing and the world was currently being filtered through a persistent ringing in hears. He thanked the night for obscuring the panicked creases in his face, lest Sam (or Dean, apparently) made some comment on his fragile mental state.

for the life he led.
His focus jumped to the lofty bookshelves next, running his fingers along ancient spines and pulling a few off their shelves out of curiosity. This was a side to Lucifer that Castiel hadn’t expected; as far as he knew, Lucifer wasn’t really the sentimental type, meaning this surprisingly vast personal library couldn’t be comprised of historical gifts, but he figured he wasn’t one for academia either. Maybe his millenia in Hell had bored him to a point that he had actually taken up reading to keep himself entertained—but, then again, the condom wrapper suggested otherwise.
“Yes. I’m, uh—I’m here on business.” Technically, he wasn’t lying. He and the Winchesters had made the long trek out to Los Angeles for a hunt, one that had been, ah,

“I am...an angel.”
“So you two have met, then? Formally, I mean, not just in passing in my office.”
The warm feeling spread to his chest, and when they had finished eating and the Winchesters had gone to bed Castiel took a seat at the hotel room desk. He found a pen in the top drawer and took the journal from Linda out of his pocket.
The most shocking thing that happened to him on the twenty-fourth day of January in the past forty-two years of his life—Jesus, he was getting too old for this hunting shit—was one morning two or so years ago when he had come into the bunker kitchen to find that Sam had made him french toast, topped with whipped cream and strawberries because Heaven forbid his brother dropped the healthy shtick for even one day (the strawberries had actually been delicious, but Sam “all the Whole Foods employees know me by name” Winchester did not need to know that). More common was his brother just got him a birthday card, and even more typical still—and what happened the vast majority of the time—was he just went “happy birthday, Dean” and then they would return to their hunt, or their research to find a hunt. Dean had all thirteen of the cards Sam had given him in a shoebox under his bed, the more recent of them being stock Hallmark cards but a couple being from when they were younger and Sam had stolen restaurant crayons to make his own. There was also one that Cas had made him, done in his messy cursive scrawl the one year he had had the time between killing things and doing weird angel business to make him one.
“An explanation for
taken an interest in his relationships, after all—but he also couldn’t deny that, by and large, the people of Los Angeles seemed to have favorable opinions of him. He’d seen the way he softened under the touch of Detective, too, like she really meant something to him.
“Whatcha got your hackles up for, Cas? We—”
“They’re not,” Castiel interrupted. “I have a certain role to fill, and I am failing to fill it. That’s hardly their fault.”

“It’s a gift. I’ve been told you’re supposed to keep those.”
“Be that as it may, your holiness, it’s not about necessity. It’s about wanting. What do you
Dean’s voice was awkward and stilted, reminiscent of the box of parts at his feet: a little lost and a bit disjointed, but still purposeful. Maybe even a little hopeful that Cas would say yes.
“I am sometimes,” Castiel interrupted. Linda gave him a bizarre look, and kept talking.
“That is what he called it, yes.” He set the glass down. “A brief bodily malfunction, truly. I don’t understand why he made such a to-do about it.”
“The situation in Hell is sorted,” he said bluntly. “I believe Dad’s exact words were something along the lines of, ‘Hell no longer needs a warden.’”
“I’m doing pretty great myself, thank you,” she replied, sitting down in the chair across from him. “It’s always a good day when my son sleeps through the night.”
“I agree that it could be in my better interests,” Castiel said. He lifted the notebook, gesturing. “I appreciate it.”
he finally heard someone say, and he snapped back to said human men sitting with him. Dean was smirking. “Did E.T. go home, or what?”
“Well, that’s that, I guess,” Dean said after a few moments, as if they had just decided on what to order for dinner and not killed a nest of vampires. “Now what? Drag ‘em to the lake? I figure a fire would attract too much attention.”
To his shock, Lucifer looked like he might argue against his departure, but ultimately he just pressed his lips into a thin line of a smile.
“Yes, well, funny little thing about being on Earth,” he jerked his head towards Detective, “she makes me vulnerable.” She gave an uncomfortable smile in Castiel’s direction, and Lucifer let her hand go to grab a different liquor bottle from his shelf of many. “Now,” he said, turning back to Castiel as he started to pour, “it’s your turn. I’m not complaining, but you’re a far cry from the curly haired, cleanly shaven Castiel I saw before our father punted me to Hell.”
He grabbed Dean’s jaw with delicate hands and pulled him back towards him, kissing him with a loving tenderness that almost made him cry. He cupped Cas’s face in return, hands sliding back into his hair as he kissed him fervently, and almost broke away as laughter bubbled to his lips at the fact that kissing Cas was giving him genuine fuckin’
“What is this for?”
Claws hooked into the skin over his collarbone and he hissed, grounded just long enough to roll over and pin the vampire to the ground. He promptly sliced through the creature’s neck, unphased by the sickening squelch that followed, and sat back, breathless. Fuck, the wound in his shoulder hurt. It shouldn’t hurt. Fuck. Fuck.
“Right..." Linda trailed off, looking at something in her notes, before snapping her head back up again. “Castiel, do you mind if I ask what may potentially be an incredibly bizarre question?”
“My friends suffered for decades at your hand,” Castiel hissed, spitting blood. “The very least you could do is stay in Hell and protect what precious time they have left on Earth by controlling your army of
“Dean,” Castiel supplied.
He heard Sam sigh, resigned. “Alright, if you say so.” There was a beat of silence, and Castiel was tempted to apologize for being so short-fused when Sam spoke again. “For what it’s worth, we like it when you hang around.”
Castiel humored him for a moment, widening his eyes and parting his lips, before his expression snapped into one of loving contempt. “You know that doesn’t work on me, you ass.”
“It means,” Linda started, ever-patient, “that I believe you are struggling to form an idea of who you are outside of your relationships with Dean and Sam.” Castiel opened his mouth to argue, but Linda put a hand up. “Tell me, how would you describe yourself? And you aren’t allowed to reference either Winchester.”
“Maze, short for Mazikeen.” It was Castiel’s turn to be accusatory, setting his jaw as his lip curled. Linda didn’t seem to notice, too caught up in the excitement of her hunch being right, and nodded.
“Are you
and didn’t have time for my sinful brother.”
rather than for him, and Cas had given him a non-committal shrug in response that had earned him a gentle shove. Jack, excited to have finally gotten his turn, had given him a handmade card (technically, they all had, but Jack’s was the only one that had brought him to tears because it said “Happy Birthday, Dad <3” in crayon along the top) and a John Wayne Monopoly set, which had led to hours of intense real estate wars broken only by dinner and pie before Cas was finally declared the winner.
“I’m just—” Just
“I said,” Dean repeated, and he leaned forward to press a very quick, very “first teenage romance” kiss to Cas’s lips. “You missed.”
“If you would stop jabbering and open it, you might find out,” Cas teased, bumping his shoulder. It was Dean’s turn for an eye roll, and he pulled back the wrapping to reveal a nondescript cardboard box. It felt warm in his hands,
Dean let go, walking towards Sam. “Who says I’d complain, sunshine?”
“I work for the FBI,” he replied, before realizing that was probably not something an actual FBI agent would say so openly. “I can’t really go into the specifics, of course.”
“Not that I would know,” Castiel spoke, tightening his jaw against the thoughts whirring around in his brain. “Right.”
Lucifer tilted his head, a small, teasing smile of realization spreading across his lips as he gave a breathy laugh. “You’re telling me you lost your Earthly form to

Sam gave him an awkward smile from where he was standing over Cas and Jack, who appeared to be militantly arranging a plate of pancakes. Or rather,
been going to complain that Dean was the one who actually needed to eat, so he should choose, but he seemed pretty bent on not going any further until he got Castiel’s opinion. This was proven when the light turned green and he still didn’t move, something he only got away with because they were the only ones on this particular road in the middle of nowhere.
“What kind of movies do you like to watch?”
Linda mulled over that for a moment, nodding more to herself than in response to what he had said, before finally replying, “So, you wouldn’t be the actual, genuine,

“How?” he asked, tilting his head in confusion.
“Yes, actually,” Castiel answered, giving a small smile. “And the first coworker is fine, now.”
“...Times table?”
“Small miracles,” she reminded him. “Little steps. You’ve already reunited with Lucifer, so why don’t you start there? Amenadiel can come later, when you’re more sure of yourself.”
Cas smiled.
“‘Petoskey State Park ranger warns against hiking at night as another bobcat victim surfaces,’” Sam read aloud, squinting at his phone screen from where he was hunched over in the passenger seat. Dean scoffed.
Dean made an exaggerated display of thinking, and then blew out the candle.
“You’re the driver,” he decided on, folding his legs over each other as he sat up. “We stop when you stop.”
“Good afternoon, Castiel,” Linda greeted, holding the door open for him as he stepped into her office. “How are you today?”
“How is everything so far?”

“I...”
“Fine,” Castiel answered bluntly, not looking up.
“Dad spoke to you?” Castiel asked with genuine curiosity, pushing himself into a sitting position. He winced as he moved his jaw, touching it gingerly. Explaining his wrecked face to the Winchesters was going to be a fun conversation.
“He was concerned for you,” Linda said gently. “Panic attacks are brought on by extreme levels of stress and anxiety, such as a coworker you deeply care about sustaining a potentially fatal injury.”
Dean’s head fell forward into Cas’s shoulder, and he took in a shuddering breath as he repeated the sentence in his head over and over.
That’s another thing he wasn’t used to.

Dean laughed again, trying to hide how fond he was made by the fact that Cas, former Angel of the Lord and self-proclaimed raiser of Dean Winchester from “perdition,” didn’t understand that syrup, by nature, would soak everywhere after it was poured.
Apparently, there had been plans for a movie and popcorn, too, but after their long and tedious game of Monopoly they had all agreed to just go to bed, so Dean now found himself heading back to his bedroom, tailed by Cas. He was chattering on about how Cas had
