"In those songs you played me... I was under the impression that 'baby' was frankly illogical slang for your lover. Were they talking about cars, Dean?" If Dean hadn't been too busy laughing his head off, he might have noticed the soft growl in which Cas always said the word
“What?” Dean said with a quirk of his lips, threading the floss through the needle. “You’re gonna wanna drink more of this,” he gestured to the whiskey.
Fuck, he was losing it to the heat spreading through his stomach, to the pure feel of it all. He tried to hold back. He’d wanted to fuck Cas while he came. Dean moaned. “Fuck, Cas.” The words were hoarse, pure.
Cas, not that other Cas, in that other time. The thought grounded him somewhat. “I guess I never thought of it.”
Cas jumped as if he hadn’t realized Dean was behind him. Then he resumed his surveying of the lake. “Apologies. I like standing here – I feel like I’m part of the lake. I can think.”
I licked a stripe along his pink entrance, fascinated by the way his eyes rolled back in his head at the sensation. I circled my tongue around the hole, wetting it thoroughly before poking my tongue inside. He groaned above me. He sounded almost...surprised. I sucked on my finger for a moment before breaching his entrance slowly. His muscles clenched up, but I stayed perfectly still. My own arousal was clouding my mind, desperate to be touched, but I would not hurt him. I wiggled the finger, adding my tongue back to soothe the hurt.
Cas didn’t reply, just stared up at him with those open blue eyes. Dean’s breath came shakily, wondering what the feeling whirling in Cas’ eyes was. Slowly, ever so slowly, Cas lifted his head up until his eyes were just below Dean’s. His pink lips were softly parted, and he wore that thoughtful expression Dean had grown too fond of. Every muscle in the hunter’s body was tense, his brain screaming that he ought to move away, before he did something stupid, but he didn’t want to -
“How the hell would I know?” Damn, he could’ve sworn he actually saw Cas flinch. “I just mean… I don’t know. I don’t think it’s more important than other stuff, no. But I guess there’s this idea that once you find the right person then everything falls into place.”
When we were both on the edge just from rocking together in our jeans, he grabbed my hips to stop me. I growled, until I felt what he pressed into my hand. Lube. I laughed. Probably with an expiration date of 2010, but what did that matter. I had no idea where he'd gotten it, and I didn't care. I ripped it open and we laughed as the smell of artificial strawberries filled the air. I unzipped his jeans and pulled them down around his ankles, watching hungrily as his hard cock sprung up to his stomach.
"Well, this time's gonna be different. No disappearing, either." He drummed his fingers against the wheel.
Dean could hold out for a long time, even with the touch of his own rather experienced hand. He’d started off slow, but something about the way Cas was looking at him went way down, made him want that explosive pleasure
Cas reluctantly spun around in Dean’s arms, and clasped his hands at the back of Dean’s neck. Dean blinked, surprised at how naturally the position came. He said, “All right. I know how to waltz, but this isn’t really a waltz, so let’s just start off slow and see what happens.” Dean grinned.
I had laid myself at their mercy, and pointed out that such an action in itself showed the desire for forgiveness.”
Cas strode across the distance between them, shoving Dean back on the chair he'd been sitting on and straddling him. If Dean's breath had been short before, it left him completely now. Cas was kissing him before Dean had a chance to say anything else, lips hot and soft, just for him. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, sliding his hands over the deliciously bare skin. They kissed deeply, Dean's tongue mapping out the inside of Cas' mouth. Cas moaned into him, and it became all too clear why he was so eager. "Cas," Dean said, breaking off the kiss to brush his lips over Cas' shoulder, "How come angels get morning wood?"
them so much more vividly than normal, full and velvety, juxtaposed by the scrape of stubble against his chin. Cas’ tongue swept along his lower lip, and Dean melted for him, letting him in. When Cas pulled away, Dean was panting slightly, eyes blown wide with lust. But Cas was considering him with something more like a question in his eyes, and Dean gasped, “Believe you. I believe you.”
More silence. He couldn't believe he'd been in this stuffy room, in this stupid fugly chair, with this silence rolling all around him for days straight. He cleared his throat, not sure if he could bear to speak again and not have Cas' gravelly voice reply.
The night was cold, but our bodies were hot, and I ground against him. It didn't seem to matter that anyone could walk by, and if he didn't care, that was good enough for me. There were lights in his eyes, ones that looked like the reflection of lights on water. I knew they weren't really there, but I watched them intently nonetheless.
The idea comes one day when Sam sees Dean praying. He’s doing it silently, but his lips moving is the closest he’s come to speaking in a week. Sam has faith he’ll get better: it’s not the first time Dean’s stopped speaking, judging from Dad’s journal. Mostly he makes him soup and musses up his hair and leaves out artefacts from his archival of the bunker that Dean can turn over in his hands while Sam talks to him in a soft voice.
“Sit,” he said numbly, gesturing towards the chair. Cas ignored it and sank to the floor instead, suddenly overcome. Dean was only a moment in sliding down beside him. Letting their shoulders touch.
He died a while ago. Headshot after he was infected by the Croatoan virus. I picked up his guitar and hid it in my cabin, so it wouldn't get turned into scrap material. It only had three rusty strings, and I held it across my lap. I didn't know how to play. I wondered if it was true. Was I falling? Still falling, after everything?
“I told you before, I can regulate my vessel’s body temperature.” Cas sighed and returned his attention to whatever he was turning over in his hands.
All at once, the engine juddered to a halt, an assembled pile of clothes fell on the floor, and the only sign they’d been in the Impala at all was a slight rumple in the leather. Dean blinked. They were laying in his bed in the bunker. Cas grinned lazily. “Coulda done that later,” Dean muttered, but he started grinning too. Cas was in his bed. Because he had one of those now. A bed, and a home, and someplace to shelter from the storm outside, and Castiel. It was too good to be true, Dean knew that. But he thought after everything he was due a little peace. At least for this afternoon, he told himself.
“Speaking of which, the ship leaves tomorrow. Is there any chance you could, you know, zap me back?” Sam hated to ask. But he also thought Dean should get a chance to stay by the Grand Canyon for a little while longer.
“Dean, what are you guys doing here? My plane’s not til tomorrow.” Sam surveyed his brother and the angel and couldn’t help but notice that they were standing awfully close. Then again, they always did.
“Garage in fifteen. Got something to show you that doesn’t smell like musty romance novels,” Dean muttered, retreating to his room. He could’ve sworn he heard Sam mutter something like,
“Wait, did you just say you’d screw the guy by the pool table?” Dean stopped short, staring at the shot in front of his lips.
Sight. Cas’ blue eyes, shining with wonder even though his brow was furrowed with concentration, his pink lips hanging parted. White, white cherry flowers all around them. Every petal, jumping out into perfect definition.
I realized belatedly his hand was still in mine, and I stroked it. "Do you like how the flowers smell, Dean?"
A short time later, Dean was laughing his face off, rose petals littering he and Cas’ chests. He might have been exasperated that his life was turning into a rom-com, but roses carried a bittersweet feeling for him. Although he now associated them, however reluctantly, with the best night of his life, he could also think of Cas, insane, alone, sitting in the Berkeley Rose Gardens and wishing
He started to read to Cas the day after that. It was easier than talking. He read any book not about monsters that he could get his hands on. He raided Sam's box of books, which had been slowly expanding since they moved into the bunker. He even read the poetry anthology when he was sure Sam was out. He read badly, stumbling and doing awful accents for the different characters, changing the words when he didn't know how to pronounce them. He read until his voice was hoarse and it was dark outside.
“So you could always read it for the first time again,” Cas said, and there was something unreadable in his eyes, something Dean had seen maybe only once before, but it was gone in a flash before he could remember where. “You’ll remember someday. I promise.” Cas said, and squeezed his hand.
Dean stood and, glaring pre-emptively at Sam, made his way over to Cas. “Here.” He wrapped his arms around Cas, joining them at both hands so he could guide Cas’ arms. Like he’d do if he was teaching the guy how to shoot a rifle. “Like so. You hold it steady and then, just real quick-” He flipped the pancake up in the air and maneuvered the skillet to catch it. “See? Easy.”
Guilt smacked into the pit of Dean's stomach. He'd forgotten Cas didn't really sleep. "I, uh... Sorry." His voice cracked, because suddenly, the fact that he got up for a glass of water in the middle of the night and didn't come back meant way more than it should, to both of them.
Dean dragged Cas into the shower. “See, Valentine’s Day is what I used to refer to as Unattached Drifter Christmas.” The side of Dean’s mouth twitched up bitterly, but the expression was gone as soon as he pulled Cas’ sweatpants off. “It’s a holiday for couples.”
The fireworks had died down by 1 a.m., and Sam hit the sack, clapping Dean on the shoulder with a muttered, “Keep it quiet.”
Cas followed Dean to the car, subdued until Dean held open the shotgun door for him. He practically beamed. Dean sighed, hopped over the hood and slammed the door behind him. He took a moment to run his hands over the steering wheel and feel the cold leather press against his back. "Oh baby, I'm home." He crooned before jerking the key in the ignition.
He dug through his pockets and found a small but sturdy knife, glancing up at Cas as he approached the rock face. There was no one around, weirdly enough, and he was positive they weren’t allowed in this part. It wasn’t really a rule he minded breaking.
Cas was never broken. He was an angel, with all the whole steely soul and badass motherfucker status that went along with it. To think that he’d broken an angel… that was a whole new level of arrogance, even for Dean. Plus, he was just a blip on the radar in the life of an eternal being. No, Cas couldn’t be broken.
Cas blinked, and turned to Dean. “Yes,” he said, running a damp thumb over the corner of Dean’s mouth. “Of course.” Then he was walking back toward the shore, clothes and hair dripping, shouting back to Dean, “Come.”
“Huh.” Dean scratched the back of his neck, hoping Cas didn’t remember the time he’d compared them to Thelma and Louise. “Yeah. Zeppelin were big on fantasy. Lucky them that they didn’t know most of it’s real.”
The flash of shock I had expected to see didn't come. He stared at me, steadily. I waited for him to speak, running my fingers teasingly under the waistband of his boxers, mouthing at his erection through the dampened fabric.
"I have to." The taller man steadied himself. "You know he might not wake up. And you need to be ready for that." With that, Sam took his leave, clasping the empty whisky bottle in his hand as he went.
If Dean had been able to see himself as Cas could right then, he would’ve jumped in the Impala, slammed the door and driven to the nearest dive bar, leaving behind all that damn sentiment and replacing it with alcohol and some single women. Dean made a mental note to himself to figure out how exactly he was feeling whatever he was feeling towards Cas when he’d only ever wanted to screw women. It was a relatively low priority though, he had to admit. But Cas, looking at him then, saw all the softness in those green eyes, conflict too, the slight opening and closing of his lips, and Dean Winchester was an open book. People in the next room may as well have been able to hear how fast his heartbeat was.
Dean would never admit it, but yes, he likes having someone mess with his hair in the shower and flick bubbles at him and trail soapy fingertips along his back. In short, he likes girly showers.
They were on a winding mountain road in the middle of nowhere when Dean pulled over. Cas followed him hesitantly. Dean watched Cas, heart heavy as the angel spun all around, taking in the land underneath them, and raindrops fell onto his cheeks. Cas grinned in spite of himself. Dean offered a half-smile, and finally, he broke the silence. “It’s not the Alps, but it’s good enough.” He didn’t even know what state they were in.
“Where the hell did you get those?” Dean asked, wondering if he would ever get used to Cas appearing before his eyes.
He could swear the plants had changed  since the last time. Then again, that wasn’t exactly surprising, given that it was a magical greenhouse. Cas had somehow hijacked the
"So," he started again. Stopped. "Don't you dare die on me." His left hand was holding Cas', but on his right hand, his nails were driving into his palm, threatening to draw blood. He laughed, startled that the words had come out so easily. "Look at me," he said, quiet now the laughter had gone. "Yeah. OK." And he looked away, unable to say any more.
Cas’ eyes snapped up, and his hands curl into fists. “I may be a poor excuse for an angel, but that doesn’t make me powerless,” he snarled.
Ordinarily, Dean Winchester was a man of action. Castiel was extraordinary, in the literal sense, and that made everything different.
When he woke up, he huddled closer to me, as if he could shield himself from the pain in his head. Once, I could have flicked my fingers and made it go away. Now all I had to offer was a glass of water.
That was what undid him, that final feeling of being held close while Cas was inside him, while Cas let his wings show, and he cried out
Cas dunked his head under the water, blinking water out of his eyes as it dripped down from his soaking mop of hair. “It’s warm!”
“I thought you would.” Dean was pretty sure Cas’ pumpkin held an enochian sigil of some kind, but he had no idea what it meant. Instead of asking Cas, he committed it to memory. Dean grinned, and he and Cas’ hands brushed in the dark field.
Oh, they were good dreams. But they always left him gasping for air, sweaty and desperate and thinking of Cas. He knew it should feel wrong – waking up in the middle of the night, sheets bunched around his waist, with his best friend’s name on his lips. The dreams, though, they were always so… beautiful. He could see Cas’ wings in them, black and majestic. The dreams were never the same, either. Sometimes he and Cas were strangers, meeting on a dusty road. Sometimes they were in Purgatory. Tonight, he’d been hunting, and Cas had been the man he’d saved. Cas had worn a black suit and tie – that is, until he’d pulled it off hurriedly, pushing Dean back against the wall. Dean had moaned in his sleep at the feel of his lips, his tongue, even if it wasn’t real. The dream had been going perfectly, Cas stripping off his clothes and sinking down to his knees, dragging Dean’s pants down and licking a lazy circle around the head of his cock – when he startled awake. “Fuck,” he muttered, mind still hazy and swimming with pictures of Cas. He couldn’t say for sure what had woken him.
Somewhere, the Empty is screaming. But underneath them, a glowing door is being cut into the blackness, and then they’re falling.
“I like Bob Seger.” The phrase sounded alien, and a little bit too much like a seventies teenie- bopper for Cas. “His music is… it feels like home. Not my home, of course. But someone’s home.”
Cas moaned, and Dean could feel the vibrations travelling along his dick. He cried out. Cas was going faster now, and Dean’s eyes were half closed. He was shaking with how close he was, the heat coiling in his stomach and begging for release, but he never wanted this to stop. Cas was worshipping his cock, eying Dean like he was something marvellous. It should’ve felt wrong, like he was corrupting an angel, but it felt perfect. Right. Cas moaned again, louder, and shoved a second finger into Dean’s tight hole. He blinked up at the hunter through hooded eyes, and Dean knew his soul must be laid bare.
“No!” Dean burst out as he realized what Cas was asking. “Cas, no.” Cas still wouldn’t look at him, so he lifted the angel’s chin with his other hand, before cupping both sides of his face and kissing him hard. “I don’t want anyone else, OK?!” He ran his tongue over his lips, desperate to make Cas understand. Cas stared directly at him. “I just want you. For the rest of my godforsaken life. Only you, all right?”
"Shut up. You were the only angel who loved this world. You did what God himself couldn't do. If you think that’s not
“No,” Dean answered honestly, sliding closer to Cas, positioning himself between the angel’s damp thighs. “This is to make you come so hard you forget your own name.”
He took my clothes off slowly, treasuring each inch of revealed skin with his lips. When I tried to turn him over, to pin him down - as I usually did - he stopped me. So I sank back down onto the pillows, and let him have his way with me. He planted open-mouthed kisses on my collarbone, making me shiver. Ran his hands along the curve of my hips. Trailed the pads of his fingers over the muscles of my chest.
“Good.” Sam nodded. “We hunt together, mostly. She’s not big on the whole dating thing. I think her calling me in the first place was her sort of compromise. But we’re good.”
The words were so much worse, when his voice was deepened by sex and strewn with pain. I recognized now what that look in his eyes had been - how
When Dean opened his eyes, the kitchen was completely empty. He padded out into the corridor, and only then realized just how hard this was going to be. The Bunker was giant. He also tried to tell himself that he was just playing this stupid game for Cas’ sake, and not because it reminded him of happier things he hadn’t had.
He plunges his fingers deeper and searches until Dean lets out a broken, shuddering moan. Then he rocks his hand against that spot and bobs his head along Dean’s dick. It’s too much to keep track of, too much to take in with the musky smell of Dean’s sweat, the feel of him clenching around Cas’ fingers, the sound of his cries. But Cas does it because he wants to be lost in Dean. Cas watches him quake and come apart as he hollows his cheeks. He tastes bitter salt on his tongue and lets it come, lets it flood his mouth with Dean’s warmth, keeps fingering Dean through his orgasm.
The world around him rattles and hums before settling down into the shape of a Greyhound bus. “Um…” Dean said, looking around. The only other passenger was a guy looking to be somewhere in his thirties, blowing balloon animals. He waved, not seeming bothered by the fact that two men had appeared on a moving bus locked at the lip.
“So, about us heading home-” Sam tried to intercede, shuffling his legs and trying to get comfortable.
Dean started stroking Cas’ cock again, harder but still slow. Cas moaned as he kissed the feathers, explored them gently. His wings shook like the rest of him when Dean touched them, and he chanted Dean’s name under his breath. His eyes were gently shining with white light, and Dean knew he might have to close his eyes at a moment’s notice. He didn’t care. It was the most breath taking thing he’d ever seen.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean muttered. He spent a few moments searching for the right one. “There you are, baby.” With a click, it slid into the right slot and guitar strings started to ring out. “All right. Go over there, and stand in the sunshine. Just let go.”
Cas cleared his throat. “Is this about your… hook-ups?” The word sounded foreign and horrible on his tongue, and he avoided Dean’s gaze. “Do you want-”
I hummed a little while I thought about it. "It was warm. The sunshine was exquisite. And Dean, everything smelled like flowers," I beamed. I wondered idly if I smelled like flowers, too.
They didn’t talk about the kiss, but after that, the touches started. Quick, fleeting touches that still somehow lasted longer than they should. Cas would press a hand to Dean’s shoulder, or skim his finger over the hunter’s knuckles while they sat and talked. In return, Dean would rest his hand over Cas’ knee, and would sometimes draw the angel in for hugs which weren’t strictly warranted and lasted a second too long. Days went by, and there were a thousand moments when they could have, but they didn’t kiss again. There wasn’t anything remotely sexual about the touches, but that was when the dreams started, too.
He was breaking. Just skimming his knuckles over Cas’ skin, staring at the space where his collarbone poked out, just the guitar winding its way up and down, well stitch after stitch, he was breaking. It wasn’t the bone-crunching sort of breaking, or like glass shattering, it was more like when a dam broke, but if the water rushed in slow motion. And if he was breaking just doing this, who knows what would happen if he looked Cas in the eye.
Dean wants to laugh, but Cas’ voice is still hollow. “Hey. Look at me. I want you to pick out the things about me that are different to the copies of me you had to kill, to that time. It’ll pull you into the present, OK?”
“Right.” Dean stood still, running a hand through his hair. Cas gazed up at him steadily. He had to admit, at this point he was used to waking up to Cas staring at him. There was just something curiously domestic about the way he now read a book while at it. Whatever. “So, uh, what happened last night?” He finally ventured.
Dean doesn’t tell him why: it’s funnier to watch Cas and Sam’s brain circuits fry when he calls Cas his wife. But he remembers that night Cas got back from the Empty, and all he wanted was to see stars. And he remember, too, that Sam runs a damn fine hunter central in his absence. It looks like it’s going to go that way, with Sam’s spellcraft ramping up and him taking on more of a consulting role. Watching Sam makes him ache for Bobby, the old Bobby from their world.
He removed his hands from Cas’ and trailed them instead over the angel’s chest. Cas’ lips twitched as Dean’s fingers brushed over his nipples through the flimsy material of his white button-up. Dean circled his fingers over the fabric-covered nubs until they were hard and standing to attention. Cas’ expression remained stoic. “Shoot,” Dean said.
‘Told you once that in my book, this was the same as begging. Well, it is. I’m begging you. I...I.” He lost a handle on the words and felt raw sentiment wave up in his chest, longing that lapped up his throat and tugged his tongue down. “Castiel,” he said, fighting to speak.
Cas was gone. “Shit,” Dean exclaimed standing up. “Cas?” He called out tentatively. When the angel had disappeared and not reappeared for over twenty minutes, he’d started walking. “Cas?” He shouted quietly, still trying not to be worried. Cas was an angel. It wasn’t like he could fall into the lake and drown. Right?
I think he could see the change, the hope leaving me, burning his own to ashes, and his tenderness vanished. He dropped my hands and straddled me, pushing me down on the floor and pinning my wrists. I didn't try to stop him, not when he stripped off my clothes barely touching me and his nails drew blood. I wanted everything he gave. Our kisses were hard and quick, teeth knocking together. He bruised my skin with the tightness of his grip, as if with his touch alone, he could stop me from leaving. I had missed his heat, the familiar smell of him. The fact we were hurting each other seemed such a small thing in the face of all we'd been through together and the pain inside of us.
Cas cocks his head to one side, body suddenly still. His blue eyes are oceans Dean wants to lose himself in. "Let me show you," Cas says, like it's a question he already knows the answer to. "Trust me. Dean?" He asks.
“Whatever.” Cas started to take the jacket off, but Dean stopped him. “Keep it.” Cas nodded. The room was spinning, just a giant wash of gray. Cas pushed him back towards the bed, and Dean laughed. “What are you – what are you doing?”
“Uh. Maybe. Maybe it worked.” Sam sat down cross-legged next to Dean, who stayed kneeling. The silence closed in around them.
The thought occurred to him a few days ago, just as he was about to fall asleep. He couldn’t say what sparked it, maybe the gentle weight of Cas’ head on his chest combined with staring up at the ceiling. He marveled that they were
It took me a moment to realize that he meant the bees. "You're right. I should return them to their homes." I snapped my fingers, bidding them a silent farewell. When they were gone, the field seemed emptier, and the distance between Dean and I was now stark, obvious.
When Cas has finished riding out his orgasm, his thrusts slow to a halt, and he collapses on top of Dean. He doesn't pull out, just drapes himself over the other man and presses a lazy kiss to Dean's jaw.
We didn't last long. Hot sweat cooled on our necks, marks were sucked in hidden places, and I buried myself in the hot core of his being. I came inside him and he cried out as I jacked his throbbing cock, stroking every ounce of bliss out of him. His eyelids fluttered, and I carried him inside.
It hurts. Jesus, it hurts so good. Dean loses all control over his body, and he hears himself moaning, sees himself shaking, but he doesn't try to stop it. He focuses on Cas' blue eyes, so dark, and how fucking full he is. When the thought occurs to him that Cas is inside him, really, truly inside of him, he moans softly. Cas takes this as a queue, and starts to pull out and fuck into Dean.
“What else could I have done?” He finally spit out, and knocked back another shot of whiskey. Cas had no right to be this angry with him, he tells himself. The angel had teleported himself back to the bunker after the hunt, leaving Dean and Sam to ride back in the Impala. They’d wondered all six hours whether he’d actually be there when they got back. Sam had said, “Diffuse him carefully, alright?” Dean had frowned. Cas wasn’t a bomb. Looking at him now, he thought maybe he’d been wrong. Sam had left the two alone in this wing of the bunker, distancing himself as much as possible.
He'd barely even thought about it, when he was carrying Cas, when he was lifting his unconscious body up to put a fresh shirt on him - one of Dean’s, if it mattered - or when he'd folded the trenchcoat up on the pillow next to Cas. Not even when he'd unlaced Cas' shoelaces, still muttering
“OK,” Dean announced when there was a visceral pile of pumpkin seeds at their feet. “Now you’re gonna cut a design through the outside. Like this.” He started cutting a pentagram without quite meaning to. “Er, it can be whatever you want.”
He came to me the night before the attack. His eyes were so soft that for a moment, I thought it might be 2009 Dean out for a walk. I wasn't sure how much that Dean knew, and so I said everything I could without explaining me and Dean to him per say. But no - it was my Dean, tonight. He thought maybe 2009 Dean could change things - he had hope that maybe, just maybe, all his perceived wrongs could be righted. I didn't care. We would die tomorrow, maybe take the Devil with us, but I wouldn't take it back.
Dean tried not to drop the plate. Were they really about to have the, ‘Hey Sam, I’m super gay with my best friend, you know the one I told you I wasn’t gay for for so long, the angel, yeah, how long have you known?’ conversation?
“You’re gonna need it where we’re going. Come here.” He cleared his throat, and Cas walked around the corner, eyebrows raising when he saw it. It was a glossy black motorcycle, ready to rev to life. Dean had spent all of yesterday fixing her up, and was pretty sure she had protection symbols etched into her. “Hop on,” he said handing Cas a helmet.
Dean gulped, unable to drag his mind out of the gutter. Cas didn’t strictly need a bed, as he didn’t sleep. Dean tried to spend as little time as possible in Cas’ room, both to give him personal space and to avoid spontaneous urges to pin Cas to the wall and kiss him senseless. “Come outside, there’s something I want you to see.”
“So… you want to take drugs, what, because Jimmy Hendrix did it?” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose.
He leans down and presses his lips against Cas’. When Cas startles, opening them to draw in a gasp of air, he breathes in the grace. His body goes rigid and his spine arcs in Dean’s hands. Somewhere, glass shatters, and Dean’s ears ring. Cas' true voice. He’s never been more grateful for that sound.
"I don't love you just because you know how to be human, or feel like one," Dean managed, grinding up against Cas' pelvis. "I love you for everything you are." It's funny, how much easier it's gotten to say that. He slipped his hand under the waistband of Cas' sweatpants and wrapped his fingers around Cas' cock, before starting to stroke him.
He darted another glance at me. "You don't even know how far gone you are." He started laughing. "It's my fault. If I'd just stopped you before all this started. But then," and tears started welling up in his eyes even as he shook with laughter, "It's your fault, too. You're the one that opened Purgatory, cracked the wall in my brother's head and sucked up all the crazy." I looked away, and wished he would stop talking. "And I can't even
Blue Letter, by Fleetwood Mac (My Favorite Fleetwood Mac song!! Ironically written by somebody outside of the group, but still.)
“Dean, given that I’m perfectly intelligent, what’s so wrong with going in the lake?” Cas asked, sitting on the ground by Dean’s feet again. Dean reeled in his fishing rod aggressively before casting it out again. Dean didn’t answer, because the perfectly logical explanations of freezing or drowning didn’t really apply to the angel. “A shark could have eaten you.”
What Cas isn’t used to is his own arousal, burning a hot line against his leg and up into his groin. When Dean rolls his hips against Cas’, it feels like salvation. He groans and mirrors the movement, feeling his own flesh throb and Dean huff a laugh against his throat.
“Jack...hey, kid...hope the whole God schtick is going well. We miss you down here. Uh. Car rides not quite the same anymore. Yeah. Um. I know you’re out and about in the raindrops and stuff, but it’s about Cas. I guess maybe you woulda gotten him out if you could.” Dean waits. Steadies himself. “Look, fuck, I know I haven’t always been good to you. And I regret it all the time. But I just – if there was one thing...”
They fucked hard and deep, rocking the desk back with every thrust. Dean savored the dull ache and stretch of being full. Cas held his hips tightly and bit at his neck, but it felt good. It felt like they were claiming each other back. He listened to the silence, the slap of their skin together, Cas’ soft sighs. He could just make out the shadow of wings flickering in time with Cas’ eyelids fluttering shut. It occurred to him then, albeit in a garbled and sex-hazed way, that part of what he loved about Cas is this very angelic power, how strange and beautiful and -
They move out of the bunker. It takes its toll on Dean, but he seems to have decided through some inaccessible logic that Cas is his
“I’m an angel of the Lord,” Cas said, but it was almost slurred, said so hurriedly and quietly it was indistinct.
he recalled Cas saying. Damnit. Why the fuck didn’t he listen? “Cas…” and he sat down on the table beside Cas, their arms just brushing. “I‘m broke too, Cas.” He said finally. “Have been for a long time. So if you’re sitting here and telling me that you think I don’t trust you cause you’re broken, or cause you don’t think you’re good at that whole being an angel crap… you’re wrong. I’m kind of the resident expert on broken, you know?”
Matter-of-factly, Cas picked up the camera, turned to Dean, and pressed the shutter button. Dean hadn’t been paying attention, and had been staring dreamily at Cas. He flushed red. “What the hell, Cas?”
After aeons, the one story that kept you awake at night was the one that never ended how you wanted. After all of time, God was stuck on the Winchester boys.
“No.” Cas paused and turned to look at Dean. “Are we here on a hunt? Nothing to do with Samhain, I hope.”
It’d snowed for days straight, and finally the rain had come. Cas stood, nose pressed to the window, watching the rain pour down. Black clouds were on the horizon, and Dean could see distant flashes of lightning. The storm would be here tomorrow. Dean strode up to his lover and circled his arms around his middle, kissed his shoulder and then let his head rest there. He missed Sam, and worried about him too. But a small part of him sure was happy they were alone. Cas melted into Dean’s touch, and they stayed that way for a time in silence.
“Mostly good. That’s all anyone ever is.” Cas nodded as if he’d just imparted some great philosophical revelation.
They drove until dawn, Janis Joplin singing and screaming at them all the way. The sky was cloudy, so they couldn’t properly see the sunrise. Dean didn’t look at a map the whole way, largely because he didn’t need to. He was driving randomly, taking the highest road whenever there was a choice. Rain flecked the wind shield, and Cas watched the world sail by. They didn’t talk. Dean didn’t know what to say.
“It’s, uh, good to see you happy.” Dean nodded once, wondering why Sam was still staring at him. Just his little brother being weird, he decided later as he turned over on his stomach and closed his eyes.
“Of course.” Dean smiled and nodded, before pressing play. He’d been worried about this, because how the hell could he help an angel having an existential crisis? But this felt good. An unfamiliar kind of good, sure, but it was still good.
Dean kissed Cas, and let himself melt into the other man. They kissed for easily an hour, slow and soft, until they were both hard and Dean remembered his earlier intention. He rutted his hips into Cas, enjoying the brazen moan it produced. “Come here.” He let Cas push him back onto the bed, and climb on top of him, straddling his hips. Cas put a finger to his lips as he made to say something else. He was running his hands over every inch of Dean’s body, more gentle than Dean wished he would. It was like he was contemplating Dean’s skin and muscles and bone like they were some kind of miracle. That reverent look again.
“Yes, fuck,” Dean bit into Cas’ shoulder as they fell off the edge together, pleasure flooding through them and reducing the world to this narrow view of a steamed up shower cubicle and tangled together fingers.
One day, he gets a message that sounds so much like Dean he can’t quite breathe. NealSolo. Why does the number sixty-seven ring a bell? He shakes his head. It’s not Dean. It could be anyone. Whoever it is, though, he can help them. He starts to types back.
An electric shock went through his whole body, starting at his fingers. Followed by a single squeeze of his hand.
Dean had grinned, watching his breath linger in the air between them, relishing Cas’ eyes widening. Finally. He’d thought he’d feel shaky inside, vulnerable and needy and about to fall apart if he ever spoke these words. It was a miracle, really, that he wasn’t like that with Cas. He’d felt stronger than ever when he told Cas he loved him, like there was no mountain he couldn’t climb. Cas hadn’t grinned back; he’d just looked at Dean, eyes too blue and like he’d finally found The Truth. Their Truth.
“Oh.” Dean realized that, at this point, he was never going to teach the angel to stop staring so much. He’d gotten used to feeling Castiel’s blue eyes on him, pretty much all the time. Dean cleared his throat. “Right.”
Sam and Jack are long gone. Dean distantly hears the sound of pancakes being made in the kitchen, and maybe, if he strains, a talk on the birds and the bees.
He gasped, a horrible shuddering thing like I'd punched him, and pulled back. Tears glistened angrily in the edges of his eyes as he tried to hold them back. He opened his mouth to explain, but instead I leaned forward and met his open lips with mine. I pushed against him, body trembling with something I now recognize as wild, hopeless need.
We all knew, though. Surely we all knew. He wasn't really ever hers, how could he be, once he'd been mine?
Dean nodded. He’d learned a while ago not to question Cas. “This is amazing,” he said instead. Cas smiled, settling his head against Dean’s shoulder. “Thank you. And Cas?”
if you liked this, I'm publishing a book later this year, an LGBTQ+ romance/coming-of-age with lots of pining and hurt/comfort. Follow my writing
Dean added silently. As if he read his mind, Cas spoke again. “I would’ve come to dig you out, if I’d understood better what I do now. I was still a wavelength of celestial power, far removed from human struggles. I hadn’t taken a vessel yet. I didn’t know what that would have been like.” Dean opened his mouth, to let Cas know it was all right, but Cas kept talking. “I was so sure you would be able to understand my true voice, when I spoke to you.”
Dean swallowed. The buzzing wasn’t exactly pleasant, like excitement or lovey-dovey crap. It felt like that ache to be on the road, or that question that just keeps popping up even when you try to shove it down. And so he asked what he’d been wanting to ask for days, heart thumping in his chest. The question sounded loud in the darkness, and harsh in comparison with the gentle touch of Cas’ skin. “What did you mean when you said I’d remember some day?”
Dean bit his lip. This was unfamiliar territory. Never, in all of his sexual escapades, had anyone wanted to watch him jerk off, which was actually surprising when you consider how many women he’d slept with. This was intimate in a totally peculiar way.
I smiled. "I suppose so, yes." I looked up at the sky - clouds were gathering over the horizon, leaving the rest of the sky dark blue. The sun was setting through the clouds, turning them the faintest shade of red. "Can I kiss you?" I asked then.
Defeated the Devil. Stopped the Croats. It was foolish and nigh impossible. But I thought that then, maybe we could heal together, really heal. Our wounds might be scars instead of scabs. And in some alternate reality, where we were OK for once, I thought I might tell him. About the song, and how I thought the answers to my life as a human might be found in an Aerosmith song and a broken guitar. He would laugh, really laugh, like he used to. I smiled at the thought and closed my eyes, blissfully unaware of him watching me and his lips twitching as though they were trying to smile just as he was trying not to cry.
“What did you… hey! That was perfectly arranged in the other room.” Dean glared, releasing his grip on Cas.
“Indeed. It’s unpleasant.” Cas looked out the window, evidently unable to look at the source of the belligerent music.
Cas sighed. "You can't fall asleep, Dean. It's not even ten o'clock, it's Christmas Eve and I hung mistle toe above our heads."
When they broke apart, he noticed Cas had a light dancing in his eyes. Dean's eyebrows drew together. Maybe it was the alcohol, but Cas definitely seemed less inhibited than usual. "Cas?" he asked, noticing the angel's hand snaking its way up his thigh.
Dean couldn’t help it. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to Cas being here and them being all right and together. It was a fucking miracle. Consequently, he marveled at Cas and couldn’t resist touching him, drawing him close just to gaze wide-eyed, realizing that Cas was still here. Cas understood. For a chronic womanizer, Dean had meant it when he said he wanted Cas for the rest of his life. They were a miracle that would never wear out, just like the electricity that tingled his fingertips as he ran them along Cas’ skin would never stop.
“Dean, I…” Cas ran his hands along it, exploring every inch oddly tenderly. Dean refused to let his breath hitch, drawing in air steadily. He couldn’t be imagining what it would feel like if Cas touched him like that. Thing was, Cas did touch him like that. Whenever they hugged each other close, or sat without talking, their shoulders touching, or when their fingertips touched – that was exactly how Cas touched him. Fuck, that breaking feeling was back.
Cas rested against the door, having insisted they go in when Dean was colder than he cared to admit. He was eyeing Dean with his head tilted to the side lazily, and Dean felt warm under his gaze. Dean stood straight, a small smile creeping across his face. Finally, water droplets running down his cheeks from melted snow, Cas said, “I love you.” He said it softly, and his words would’ve sounded shy, if they hadn’t carried that
He realized Cas was waiting for him to continue, looking slightly confused. Then again, he always looked that way. “No matter what’s going on, if you’ve got the right music, you can make it better. Driving with music is the perfect combination. Feels like you’re flying. But we’ll leave that for later. Now,” he said shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, “Led Zeppelin are the end all, be all of classic rock. Got it?”
I remembered that once, he made me hear beautiful words only with his hands. Had showed me more than I could bear to think of now, such pure pleasure he had coaxed out of me. I felt like I must be broken and bleeding somewhere inside, and it was in this state that those wondrous memories spurred me to grab a hold of his shoulders and kiss him roughly, desperate to make him understand. He stood stiffly as if deciding what to do, as I needily pressed myself against him, pleading with my body.
Cas pins his arms back and kisses Dean again, hungrily, hotly. Dean's head spins, and he stammers, years of everything he ever thought about himself coming to the surface, "Wait."
“What?” Dean’s features are pained. “Cas, man, don’t...just tell me what you mean, and tell me fast. My heart’s breaking from the suspense over here.”
Dean had prayed himself hoarse every night, had left the Bunker unlocked, his phone on full charge begging for his texts to be answered. He'd driven the Impala around in the afternoons for long miles, pretending he wasn't looking for Cas.
Dean gasped out a startled laugh as they appeared on the floor of the Grand Canyon. “What the hell, Cas?” He asked, still laughing.
Dean added a finger under his tongue, wiggling it all inside of Cas and then crooking it until he cried out. “Stars,” Cas said dazedly. “I can see stars.” He stroked Cas’ prostate mercilessly, watching his whole body shudder. “I never knew humans were made for such indescribable pleasure,” Cas panted, his voice rough on the word ‘pleasure’. Dean added another finger, pumping them in and out of Cas. “The things you do to me. Beautiful, Dean. They feel…” He threw his head back, and then repeated, “Beautiful.”
He went faster now, sliding his lips up and down determinedly, fisting what he couldn’t take in his mouth. Cas panted, moaning softly. It just struck him how fucking unique this was, an angel, willingly exposed and almost letting his wings show, making love to a hunter, a broken human, just because they needed each other –
Dean looked up, meeting his brother in the eyes. He wasn’t so much surprised at the statement, it was more of a,
“You fill up my senses.” Dean repeated, opening his eyes and studying Cas, trying to understand. “This song… this is how you feel?” A small smile was fighting its way onto his face.
Cas closed his eyes against the frustrating pleasure, but did as Dean bid. “My, ah, heart beats faster. I feel... light inside. Boundless. Maybe like my chest might explode.” He let out another broken cry as Dean rutted up against him. Dean was careful to listen to what he was saying, to look him in the eye as he talked. This wasn’t just about sex; how could it be?
of what will happen when you die, but I know… well. Hester once said the moment I laid a hand on you, I was lost.” Cas let out a breath. “Perhaps. But when you die, I
He gripped Cas’ cock in one hand, stroking him until he was fully hard. Dean knew he couldn’t last long, not with how perfectly tantalizing this felt. They were hungry for each other, consummating the years of longing and prayer and pain, and no matter how much they got of each other, they’d still need more.
Cas stared at the white wall to Dean’s left, as if answers might appear written on it. He looked lost, and Dean reached up, found his hand and squeezed it. Dean didn’t want to make Cas unhappy. Just when he was on the verge of dropping it, Cas said, “If we’re going to do this, I think it should be somewhere special.” Dean’s eyes went wide with surprise, but he uttered a quick nod.
We ripped our clothes away, careless with desperation. His skin felt perfect against mine, and I glided my hands over his scars, his muscles, his cock. "Mine," I whispered.
Dean nodded jaggedly, trying not to notice how his torso was almost on top of Cas' and he'd been quite clearly crying on his friend's shoulder. "How?" he asked suddenly. "How did I trigger it?"
At least so he thought, because when he squeezed some onto his fingers, it became evident the entire world was conspiring against him. Rose-scented.
“Dean.” Cas is frowning. “You know, I love your strength. But,” and he’s sneaking his hands around Dean’s temples, rolling them in a circle to make Dean relax. “You can love softness too. And I do.”
“Don’t, that’s littering.” Cas said quickly. Raising his eyebrows, Dean set it back in the cooler. “Why?”
Dean stepped to one side, and Cas followed after a moment, frowning. Dean said softly, “Don’t overthink it. Just move.” He was, of course, talking out of his ass. He didn’t really know a damn thing about dancing. But Cas seemed to like the advice, and they moved more smoothly after that.
It should take longer than it does when he's already come. But Cas feels twelve years of unexpressed bearing down on him and he turns desperate, nearly sobbing into Dean’s shoulder with the wonder he feels. And Dean – Dean feels like this was what he needed in his bones, like nothing was ever more right than an angel of the lord railing him into his memory foam mattress. He reaches a hand down to his cock because God help him, it’s okay to want, and to have.
What Dean didn’t know, of course, is that Sam walked up the stairs to the roof and stood behind Cas as the angel stared up at the sky. “Hey, Cas.” He said softly.
When Dean reached the shore, Cas was already sprawled back on the pebbles, guitar resting comfortably on his thigh. Dean stood there, water flowing through his toes while Cas began picking out an arpeggio pattern. He really had gotten pretty good at playing. Cas looked straight up at him, a determined set to his jaw and an expression that made it seem like they were the only two there, before he began to sing.
, he thought again, stronger this time, and Cas grinned as Dean pushed him backwards and pinned him against the wall, kissing him as the angel’s shoulders shook with laughter.
They geared up, jamming silver bullets in their place and reaching for another handgun, until they were ready. Sam smiled for a moment too long at the beat up guitar resting in the trunk. They had reason to think a pack of werewolves were organizing themselves, which was unusual, apart from the werewolf cults. Usually werewolves turned out to be civilians by day who had no idea what had happened to them. This clearly wasn’t the case here. Which meant the wolves were gonna be nastier than normal, but also removed any gray lines they might have struggled with. Dean could do with a cut and dry case.
They packed up their gear and climbed into their respective seats. They hadn’t actually caught anything – at least, nothing which was big enough to merit cooking or not on an endangered species list – but Dean didn’t mind. It was more about the fishing than the actual fish.
Dean stayed silent. Every fibre of him was ready for something bad to happen. “I don’t answer because, well, I want to.” Castiel bit his lip. “I want to answer you, Dean, and that’s the problem.”
“C’mere,” he said, kneeling down. “You gotta pack it like this.” Cas studied how his hands moved carefully before mimicking it, forming a perfectly made snowball. “Yeah, just like-” Dean’s words were cut off with a mouthful of snow. His face stung. He shook his hair, releasing a flurry of white, before wiping the snow off best he could. Cas was smirking. Dean grimly packed a second snowball in record time, but when he spun to throw it at Cas, there was a flap of wings and the angel was gone. “That’s cheating!” He protested. But he set off into the forest to look for Cas.
After scouring every room in the bunker, putting off the eventuality of what he might say or do once he found the angel, he noticed that the room with the cassette player’s door was shut. Frowning, he gave three ginger knocks. There was no response, and Dean opened the heavy door.
Sam smirked. “Come on, Dean. It wasn’t so hard to guess. All the times you couldn’t stand losing him. The awkward eye stares. I’ve known you my whole life, figuring you out isn’t exactly rocket science.”
“I will always come back to you,” Cas murmured, breaking through Dean’s reverie about how on earth he’d never noticed just how good the leather smelled all the other times he’d had sex back here.
When Sam and Dean only stared at Cas, clearly lost, he continued. “Hide-n-seek. You said you didn’t play it as children. I clearly don’t know how to play. Why don’t we?”
Going on his knees, he crouched behind Cas, peering over the angel’s trench coat. He was rewarded with a glare. “Come on, what’s so interesting? Found another 1940’s copy of Busty Asian Beauties?”
Beethoven would have said. I had saved him from hell, he had saved me from heaven, together, we had failed. And now we were here. Es muss seine. It must be.
“If you start comparing me to a rose, I’ll-” he couldn’t think of a suitable threat. “I have an arsenal in the trunk,” he muttered.
They rocked from side to side, Cas studying him with an earnest expression. Dean almost laughed, he looked so serious, but he knew that wouldn’t go over well. The angel wore a dark purple shirt Dean had called girly when he first got it, but which looked damn good. Dean was almost cold, wearing his worn AC/DC t-shirt in the wide open room. He made a mental note to introduce Cas to AC/DC, and couldn’t believe he’d let it go so long. Cas’ hair was longer and a little shaggy. Maybe he was letting it grow. What a funny thought.
Later, they collapsed onto the couch together, laughing as Dean tried and fail to get his jacket off, tugging in all the wrong directions. Cas fell on top of him, their bodies tangled together. “Dean,” Cas said quietly.
“But I mean…” Dean ran his free hand over his chin. “There doesn’t always have to be a reason, y’know? It can just be…” he scrunched up his face. “Random, I guess.”
“I…” Dean stared up. When had the sky turned red? When had the sun set? It was jaw-dropping, sending red tints all throughout Cas’ hair.
“I don’t understand your preoccupation with breast size,” Cas said, turning something over in his hands.
“Oh.” Cas looked almost crestfallen, like he’d been anticipating engaging in some new courtship ritual with Dean.
“For that werewolf gig?” Dean asked, turning onto the highway, admittedly in the direction of the Grand Canyon.
This is a bit of an angsty chapter, but I hope Destiel feels will make up for it. Thank you, Ravenwolf36 for recommending this song!
He sunk down onto the grass, which smelled just like real grass in summer. He let the earth hold him and the sun warm him and closed his eyes. Bees droned somewhere out of sight.
Dean looks up at him. His hair presses silky soft against Castiel’s bare thighs. He stops and beckons with two fingers. Cas frowns. Dean grabs the side of Cas’ hip and pulls him in, then looks up wide and pleading.
Cas pulled his head back into the car, black hair mussed and falling into his eyes. He shivered. By way of explanation, he said, "I wanted to really feel the wind."
“Almost, angel.” Dean said, his world briefly stopping when Cas’ lips fell open and his eyes squeezed tighter shut, only barely holding on. “I want you let your wings out.”
Prayer was a sign of faith. He fell to his knees and closed his eyes before her. One word. “Please.”
Dean wanted to drown in that sound. He wanted to ask him to say it again. It couldn’t possibly be true, but he needed to hear it. The moment stretched. His throat closed up. No, no, fuck, it was happening again. He couldn’t talk. He’s not looking at Cas. He can’t bear the devotion on the angel’s face, not with the million and one ways he could fuck this up simply by being Dean Winchester racing through his mind.
The smile that spreads across Cas’ face is nothing short of beatific. Dean wonders how many lives he’d give up saving just to make Cas happy.
understand. But it’s kinda common knowledge you shouldn’t cage something with wings,” Dean said, closing his eyes. That sounded like a quote, but he doesn’t remember where from. Rambling. He was rambling, about his feelings of all things.
“Still… I… I shouldn’t have made you stay. Just because I wanted you to. Just because I thought it’d help. You’re not like me, man. You’re an angel and I guess I
“I… I made it so you wouldn’t remember. It’s an Enochian spell.” Cas said, running his thumbs over Dean’s chest.
I'll admit that I had entertained thoughts before that night of what it would be like to kiss Dean. I didn't think these thoughts strange, or inappropriate. I was unaware of the invisible boundaries he'd erected, and just as unaware that he had to tear them down. I stood too close and I stared too long and I
“You’re so fucking perfect, Cas,” Dean groaned against the angel’s neck, sucking red marks eagerly into his pale skin. “Beautiful,” he muttered, snapping his hips up into Cas, sighing at the angel’s velvety heat around his cock. Cas’ arms held Dean firmly, and Dean couldn’t help feeling that he was completely lost in Cas, surrounded by his hard muscles and arms and that perfect space inside him where it felt like they were one.
The word nearly knocked Dean’s tears out of him. Nearly. “Heaven? Why would you – why did you go there?” There was an edge to his voice now, a hint of that dangerous tone he used so effectively when torturing confessions out of demons. It seemed to say,
The fifth song on the mix-tape was Led Zeppelin. Of course. Dean stood in The Greenhouse, and his breath had been swept away.
No wonder Sam had been acting so weird. “I’m glad we have you, Cas,” Dean said. “Glad I have you,” he added, running a finger under Cas’ Adam’s apple to feel it bob. “And I promise you, that every day until I die, I will love you, and we’ll learn how this whole life thing works together, and every night, I’ll-” he leaned forward and whispered in Cas’ ear.
“Cas,” Dean said in between bouts of laughter, “I thought we got this the first time around. Clothes and water don’t mix.”
I wondered then what it would be like if he whispered the words, ‘I love you,’ in my ear. His touches no longer spoke the words as clearly as I had heard them once. I thought, if he had said it then, I might have turned back. Turned everything upside down.
“I’m the man,” he said dumbly, lost in the lyrics. “Asking. Cas, you better be coming back, you sonofabitch…” A sob worked its way into his throat, making his chest ache. “Why didn’t you tell me you were goin’?” He asked, staring at the light beams filtering through the dust of the room, voice almost inaudibly soft.
It’s on these visits that he realizes how much pain these humans hold. He listens to their thoughts, and to the quiet throwaway remarks they trade about wanting to end things over coffee, brushed away the next second like the crumbs on their napkins. He wants to help.
I’m finally following my dreams instead of everyone who told me I “should” do something more sensible or worthwhile, and all I really want is to get my writing out there.
I wanted to say. My lips did not cooperate. "Broke you," he slurred. "Fuck, Cas. I'm so sorry." He fell off the chair where he was sitting, to his knees. He took both of my hands in his and looking at him then, I was more reminded of what his soul had looked like when I dragged it out of Hell than I was of the man I had grown to love. "You shouldn't even be here. With me. Did I - did I break your wings?" he asked quietly. "Human," he laughed. I was steadily starting to hate those shuddering laughs, and so I laid a finger to his lips to stop him from speaking.
Then Dean takes his boxers off and licks him, and Cas isn’t responsible for the strangled noise of wonder he lets out. Dean’s pupils darken, and he leans in again, taking kitten licks all across Cas’ cock. He purses his lips at the head and lets a cool wash of saliva slick its length. Cas watches those plush pink lips open to take the head of his cock in. Dean’s mouth is just as pliant and wanting as it was when they’d kissed. Cas moans at the thought this is something he’ll get to have again, to have over and over. Dean sucks and swipes his tongue over Cas’ slit, and Cas goes hazy with pleasure. “Dean,” he murmurs. That name – it’s all he has to hold onto.
Cas steadies his breath, then props himself up on an elbow. Slowly, watching Dean, he thrusts into the hunter’s mouth. Dean’s jaw goes lax and the lines around his eyes melt away. He moans, helpless and contented, and Cas feels it around his dick. Cas starts taking his pleasure from Dean, curving his palm to Dean’s cheek to feel the shape of him pressing inside, and watches Dean let him take it. Cas can’t last long like that. Dean looks so beautiful like this. His mouth is hot and sweet around Cas as he aches for release. Cas’ whole body burns with a fever to show that it’s alive, that it’s really whole again. Cas groans, loud and broken and melodical, twisting his fingers in Dean’s sweat-damp hair. He comes in long, shaking, ecstatic jerks down Dean’s throat. The fuse in the bunker goes out. Neither notices.
I cut him off. "The only thing I think we have left, Dean, is each other. If you say it’s time to go out in a blaze of glory, win or lose, so be it. I’m in. But then…” I smiled at the ground, before darting my eyes up to him. I wasn't about to let him die thinking my pain, my inevitable death, was on his hands. "That’s just how I roll," I said.
I grabbed one of his hands in mine, and as the sun set, our bodies aligned in the long grass. I pushed inside him. He gasped as the head of my cock slipped inside, and I kept thrusting into his hot tightness until I bottomed out. I let out a breathless moan. "Dean," I whispered, perfectly still in the core of his being.
I closed my eyes, and when I opened them, the world seemed clearer somehow. "I found grace in this pain, Dean," I said softly. "You think I'm..."
Dean dialed Sam’s number, not without some trepidation. The last thing he wanted to do was call his brother while he was, y’know,
Dean wasn’t sure which to respond to – Cas calling humanity ‘small’, although he supposed that opinion was justified to someone like Cas, or the fact that the angel had just made his first pun. He did neither.
Dean smirked, and spun around. “Merry Christmas, Cas.” He trailed a finger down Cas’ cheek. It was amazing how second nature these touches had become, these touches that before their time at the bunker had been largely forbidden. He was about to lean in and press a quick kiss to Cas’ lips when he noticed a familiar, over-large frame in the doorway, complete with floppy brown hair. “Sam!” Dean let out a sharp breath, too shocked at his brother’s appearance to worry about the fact Sam had just seen him fucking
A startled laugh from Castiel prompted him to turn his neck. The angel was craning his head out the window, wind blowing his hair haphazardly. His smile only dampened for a second as he paused to wipe away the tears that had run from his eyes, staring at them in puzzlement.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You remember those cassettes I got you for Christmas?” Cas nodded once, eyes sparking. “I made you a mixtape. Songs I… thought you might like.” He said shyly, realizing how much of a teenage girl he sounded like. He switched the shower on and steps under the scalding hot water, just to have something to distract him, pulling Cas in with him. “We’re gonna go somewhere for the day, somewhere special, and I’ll play it for you. You can pick the place if you like, hell, we can go wherever you want.” He was babbling, he knew. Cas was grinning at him, though, so he kept on talking. “I mean, I wasn’t sure if you wanted to go full-on –normal on this or not.” He broke off, not sure if Cas would go for the normal dinner-and-movie combo. It seemed a little... highschool-esque, after everything.
There was a moment of silence, Sam struggling not to smile and Cas turning his earnest contemplation on Dean. It was Cas that eventually spoke. “Why don’t we play?”
Dean was pretty sure Cas slipped up and cut himself once, but a flick of angel mojo later, and it was gone. Dean shook his head. Half an hour later, two sloppily cut pumpkins sat before them. Dean stood back to admire their handiwork. Cas was still by his side. Finally, Dean took out his lighter and two tealights he’d hurriedly crammed into the pocket of his leather jacket. To be honest, he was pretty sure some hippy chick Sam had banged had left them in the car – maybe during the year he didn’t have a soul, but he was trying not to think about that. He handed them to Cas, who cupped them gingerly while Dean lit them. He lowered them down into the pumpkins and heard Cas’ breath hitch behind him.
“Yup.” Sam’s eyes looked kind of misty now, Dean noted with an eye-roll. “And for the record, Eileen didn’t stab me. The blood’s not mine. Turns out the reason she didn’t call me was because she was being held as a sacrificial offering for some Valentine’s Day black magic-fest.”
“Everything.” Cas said, slamming down another shot. “Mm. This one is good. Very chemically unstable.”
When they were back in the bunker, they both kicked their shoes off at Dean’s door. From there, it was a matter of moments before their jackets, over-shirts, shirts and t-shirts were flung to the floor and they were locked together in a kiss, bare skin brushing tantalizingly. Cas’ tongue darted into Dean’s mouth, punctuated by shallow thrusts of his hips. They had almost all week, but Dean was more than ready to get this show on the road. He undid Cas’ belt and sank to his knees, unzipping Cas’ fly and drawing Cas’ hardening cock out. He sank all the way down, feeling Cas’ dick stiffen on his tongue. He smirked, and swirled his tongue around the head before bobbing up and down a few more times. Cas’ cock was hot and heavy between his lips, stretching the flesh there wide, and Dean groaned at the feeling. His own cock was twitching and hardening, straining against the confines of his jeans. Dirty little moans were falling from Cas’ lips, and Dean wanted to memorize every sound. He pressed a palm down on himself, desperate for some friction. He watched as he took inch after inch of Cas into his mouth, watched the smooth, red flesh disappear into his mouth until he was struggling not to gag. He remembered Cas’ grace slipping between his lips, filling every inch of his body with their mingling souls. And he pulled off and said all in a rush, “I want you to fuck me.”
They'd brought him back from the battle bloody and broken, in the back seat of the Impala, slumped and gasping in Dean's arms. Sam had driven like a bat out of Hell while Dean uttered a silent litany of
“No, I’m merely-” Dean cut him off with a quick kiss. He pulled back, watching Cas trying to remember what he’d been saying. A thin stream of what looked like smoke but what Dean knew was just his breath drifted out from between his parted lips. His cheeks were pink; he must have been letting go of his control over his vessel. Something in Dean’s stomach jumped. When Cas blinked, and just said, “Dean,” he took one step closer. They were maybe six inches apart, Cas’ back pressed to the Impala, Dean’s wrist still firmly clenched in Cas’ grip. Dean leaned forward, torturously slowly; Cas’ breath hitched. Dean smirked and finally let their lips touch. Fuck, how were his lips so soft? Cas moaned into the kiss, and Dean obliged, flicking his tongue slowly into Cas’ mouth. Cas dropped his hand, arms instead circling around his waist, pulling him closer. Not for the first time, Dean noticed how strong Cas was, lean muscle pressing against him through the fabric of their clothes.
“We’re happy, aren’t we?” Dean nearly stopped breathing at the simple question. Cas wasn’t even looking at him anymore, he was looking at each leaf like it were a little miracle.
They were sitting in the Impala, driving slowly through the street. The windows were rolled down, night air gently gracing their cheeks. Dean tapped his fingers against the smooth steering wheel in time with the rock oozing out of the car speakers.
He was certain of it when Dean slumped against him up on the roof and asked if it was OK. Dean needed love and kindness, and like a misguided child, would use whatever means were at his disposal to keep that. Cas wished he could tell Dean that his love was infinite, unconditional, a wellspring that would go on forever because nothing had the strength to stop it up. That Dean didn’t need to kiss him to keep it.
“They’re cassettes,” Dean said, and mentally hit himself in the forehead. Of course Cas knew what cassettes were. “One of them’s blank, so you can put whatever songs you want on it. I’ll show you how. The other one has a mix on it. I thought, uh…” He swallowed. Cas considered the two cassettes curiously, nestled together in the bottom of the box as they were. There was a third item, in the corner. Cas picked it up, turning it over in his hands carefully. Dean told himself to get a grip. He was worse than a boy bringing flowers on a first date. Finally, the realization dawned on Cas, and the smile that broke free was like the sun.
She stayed up all the long, dark hours of the night, writing. Her email arrived in the morning. The body read:
Dean checked the clock. It was just past ten pm. “Cas, you’re centuries old-” Cas sniffed at this point “-millenia, whatever, and you’ve never celebrated Halloween. I’mma gonna fix that.”
Dean rolled his eyes at Cas' pained expression. "It's your super special magical trench coat, I get it. I'll help you find it later. I promise."
"Fuck, Cas," he said in a broken voice as he thrust into Cas erratically, coming inside him, and Cas cried out at the spill of wet heat inside him, and they were coming together, united in waves of pleasure that made them both scream. Dean thought to himself, as they collapsed back to their prior positions and he stared up at the mistletoe, that this had been the best Christmas Eve of his life. He tightened his grip on Cas.
,” Dean whines, low and indignant. “Why did you even kiss me in the first place if you didn’t want –”
Dean was past arguing terminology, and so he thrust inside Cas, letting out a blissed out moan at how much wetter it was now, wet with his own come.
And he didn’t know how to describe it, other than that the same feeling he got when Cas smiled at him, really smiled from the depths of his heart, had completely engulfed him. They were dancing through shared wonder, every inch of his body vibrating with it.
Cas knelt by him, and cupped his cheek. Dean closed his eyes, and the wounds which had dotted his body now dissipated to nothing more than scars and dried blood on his clothes. Dean leaned into the touch. He didn’t mean to; it was a habit now, more than anything. Cas didn’t move his hand until Dean jerked away, suddenly aware of himself.
“Hot chocolate,” Dean muttered. He walked to the window. “You’re telling me that’s all that happened.”
“Well yeah, but you can’t just-” Cas pulled the photo out, and blew on it like Sam had told him, watching the ink dry with a satisfied expression. Dean shut up. Cas was going to do whatever the hell he wanted with that thing if he liked it so much. Cas looked down at the photo, smiled so it made Dean’s heart ache, and folded it before shoving it in his trench coat pocket.
. He lost himself in them, tracing gold labyrinths through them until he rather forgot that Cas was staring back at him through them. When he remembered, his breath caught in his chest and he said, mouth dry, “Fuck you’re beautiful.”
Sam sighed, and ran a hand over his face. “There’s a problem.” Dean waited. “I fell for her,” he said sheepishly. “And I told her so.” Dean prepared to wince, wondering if the wedding ring gift hadn’t made things worse. “I mean, we’re both hunters, so I didn’t expect lollipops and roses. I just thought she oughta know. She got this funny look in her eyes and said she should think about it. That’s not the problem. Do you know what, Dean? Even when she was walking away from me saying she needed ‘time’, I still… loved her.” He frowned at the words, then smiled.
Some of the tension went out of Dean’s body. That was how he felt. Not about sex in general; sex in general was hella fun but meaningless. With him and Cas, though, every touch was a promise, a declaration. And the red marks they left on one another lasted longer than any words would have, because words disappeared when the breath they were fuelled on dissipated. There were some things that he needed to sort out, though. “Right… right. But I guess we should talk about what this means.” His voice cracked on the word means, because he thought they already knew what it meant, but somehow he needed Cas to say it.
I think the moment I became his friend was when I rebelled for him. Of course, I had helped him, healed him, stitched him back from nothingness, broken all of heaven's rules simply because he wanted something, let him swear at me and told him all I knew of the truth. I'm not sure he was really aware of what all those things took; he probably still isn’t. When I rebelled for him, that was the first thing I did he could understand. This, then, was when we became friends in his eyes. I was unfamiliar with the concept and made no such classifications. I am not sure, though, when I became something
was burning a hole in his throat, making it impossible to get anything out other than a harshly empty laugh. The words he should have said, had to say, were
Anyway, Cas and Sammy were in the middle of a conversation about whatever the latest book they’d read was when Dean tapped Cas on the shoulder.
Shrugging on his leather jacket, Dean headed up the stairs. He was pretty sure Castiel was on the roof. Cold air bit into his cheeks as he opened the door to see Cas’ back to him. The angel was staring up into the night sky.
“What?” Cas asked, running his fingers over Dean’s chest and staring, as if entranced by the invisible patterns he made there.
Eventually, he spoke. “You wanna go inside?” His words were so soft it was like he’d barely spoken at all, but it was such a relief, to find that speaking didn’t shatter that beautiful calm that had settled inside his chest.
“It’s okay. Really.” His voice cracks a little. Do Gods go through puberty? ““Shit happens,”” and the air-quotes are back, and he looks too much like Cas. Dean crumples a little. Because he's not just like Cas: he's like Dean, in all the worst ways. The world was dangerous, and Jack had to grow up too fast, and Dean treated him like a weapon or a monster, and he's staring at a mirror of himself. Maybe he should've left Jack well enough alone. Maybe he should've left Cas well enough alone. But he didn't, and all he can do now is try to make it up. Try to be better.
Dean let out a breath. While he thought that sounded like the recipe for a bad trip, he trusted Cas. “All right.” And he was the first one to sit down, to lean against the solid trunk.
He found Sam hunkered down in the bath tub behind the shower curtain. He looked ridiculous – six and a half feet of sasquatch, crammed into the bottom of a bathtub, trying to be inconspicuous. “Did you think there was even a
Dean rubbed his eyes. He’d been cataloguing lore for a good three hours, Cas sitting opposite him. While Sam was away getting his rocks off with Eileen – Dean assumed, anyway – they were picking up the research slack. It was boring as fuck. Dean had surreptitiously chosen the stack of books about angels. He knew if there was anything he was curious about, he could just ask Cas. But the more he thought about it, the more he became fascinated with every aspect of Cas. The times he seemed almost human, when he was a full-blown angel, now in his fallen state. He was more than a little curious.
Slashing here, hacking there. Blood spurting across his face. A howl. Stab. Pain slicing along his back. A naked dead guy at his feet, another lupine face looming in front of him. A burst of white light when Cas iced a wolf. Dust in his eyes. Sam shouting out. Gun shot. Fuck, reload. Bang. Dead.
“Okay. But you have to take your shirt off.” Dean winced at the way the words had come across. “Trust me.” He hoped that conveyed what he wanted to say.
“You found your faith again?” He stumbled. He felt almost… what was this churning in his stomach? It was something petty and stupid, he knew that. He’d thought he and Cas had made each other better. Wasn’t some weird enchanted temple-greenhouse the angel hadn’t told him about kind of cheating?
“Don’t be sorry for this, Dean. Never be sorry for this. We’ve changed each other, you and I. And this is a mark that we belong together.”
world, the one Zachariah had shown him. Cas downing pills with a twisted smile and a, ‘That’s how I roll.’ He stared at the sink, trying to find focus in the droplet of water hanging off the end of the faucet, trembling against its inevitable descent. It didn’t work, and he turned to Cas, burying his hands in the towel to dry them. He reminded himself firmly that this was
He undid my belt and pants more smoothly than I could have done myself, though his hands were shaking. I noticed this and grasped his wrists for a moment, steadying him. He pulled my jeans and boxers down, biting his lip as he stared at my exposed cock. I liked the way he looked at me. Not that lecherous smirk he reserved for women at bars, nor the tender stare for his friends. It was fiercer, and altogether beautiful. He ran his thumbs over the dark swirls of hair on my thighs, before leaning forward and swirling his tongue around the head of my dick. I whimpered. The last coherent thought I formed before he swallowed me down into the hot slick of his mouth was how strange it was, in the vast scheme of the universe, how unbearably good this one moment felt.
Cas replied by lifting the hem of Dean’s black t-shirt over his head. Dean chuckled. Clothes were discarded lazily. They weren’t in a hurry. Even when their bare skin touched, when Cas started stroking Dean’s hardening cock, it was slowly. Dean wanted this moment to last forever. Cas knelt before him, and Dean took his time working him open with his tongue and teasing fingers. He was more aware of Cas’ sighs and moans than he was his own breaths, which were by now ragged with want. The rain fell hard, echoing on the roof. They made love slowly, rocking against each other until they couldn’t stand it anymore. Until they let go, and let sweat and ecstasy and steadily thumping hearts take them over. Dean didn’t pull out, they only fell to the floor and lay there and were still together once more. Their bodies tangled together, and the rain fell.
Dean had pieced this together from the set of his jaw, the downcast blue eyes. Little things which helped him stumble through his and Cas’ emotional stupidity.
An hour later, he set about looking for Cas. He found the angel in front of the bunker, watching a bee pollinating the sole flower that was springing up from a crack in the concrete. “Castiel,” Dean whispered, looping his arms around Cas’ middle and pressing himself against Cas’ back. “Would you, uh, wanna go on a date with me?” He asked, letting some awkward schoolboy charm creep into his voice.
Right. He’d probably want an answer. And so before the ringing had quieted, before the surprise had died down, before he had fully processed the magnitude of fucking everything –
“Well it occurred to me how you’ve never gotten properly drunk when the world wasn’t about to end.” Dean shrugged, and said to the bartender – a blonde chick maybe in her fifties – “Two of everything.” Turning back to Cas, he decided to get it out of the way. “And never gotten laid with someone who didn’t try to kill you, as far as I know.” Cas had frozen, and when the bartender skeptically started pouring shots and laying them out in front of the two men, he downed about three as soon as she laid them down.
