His phone lights up.
Sherlock could appreciate a unique name, so that didn’t help Joe’s case, in Sherlock’s good opinion.
“You’re serious?” John broke into laughter, doubled over at the bar and wiped his eyes. “How long do you think you have until she notices?”
“My work, if you could call it that, grabbed the attention of one of their snipers. One who matched me in skill. It’d become an obsession of mine to eliminate him. I’d see a risky shot, but it could attract insurgents to our ground units, so Victor would talk me out of it. But I knew I could make the shot. I knew it. I’d be famous for it. I...I got cocky.
Ned let out a surprising chuckle. “Now there’s a woman.”
John’s face brightens like a small child promised an ice cream cone. His eyes light up like stars and a smile spreads across his face, one that you can see he’s trying to restrain, but the mirth spills from him in waves. Sherlock returns his smile and satisfaction glows in his chest when John’s hand flips over to grab his.
That night, John learned of the giant gaps in William’s movie repertoire. William simply didn’t watch movies. But he loved to predict their plots, and since John had seen them all, he didn’t mind. He laughed. He made popcorn. They held hands.
“John?” he says.
“I love you too, mom.” And this time, it wasn’t the usual quick, perfunctory statement between them. This time, his chest swelled with happiness, and his eyes blurred.
John, stiffer than a starched shirt, shook the bastard’s hand. “Peter.”
“Yes. When you...when you walked out the other day and had supposedly sold her to a pawn shop, I visited Harry.”
William stretched along the sheets like a cat in the sun, all glorious sinewy limbs and muscled torso. His cock stood at attention.
He opened the door dressed in a leather jacket and jeans that hugged him like spandex.
“Can you?”
Though, his ears aren’t that much of a concern any longer.
William looked as if he suppressed an eye roll as he said, “A person sexually aroused by another person who has committed murder and rape. Sometimes used to refer to prison groupies.”
“Why your sudden fascination with my love life?” Sherlock asked with a hard edge to his voice.
Sherlock meets his gaze, letting a small smile slip onto his lips. “No, not just to the Work.”
“Mike and Molly spoke highly of you after you left the party. I was...intrigued. As well as attracted.”
John held his glass with two hands, while reminding himself not to hold it too tightly. “Excuse me?”
the odds?
He met Ned’s gaze. “It was hell. And there wasn’t really a home anymore.  No family, no friends. My house was covered in paint and swear words and ‘killer,’ left by angry people who thought I helped my wife kill all those people.” He crossed his leg over his knee to stop it from wiggling. “I went from having a normal life, career, family, to nothing.” He didn’t mention the state of his marriage. “ I thought life was good. But...she...this person I thought I knew was not who or what I thought she was. And when I was acquitted, I had nothing but a lot of angry people calling me a murderer.”
John shoots Sherlock a look that borders on laughing. “You’re a nutter. And I like that about you. But you’d give anyone else a heart attack and they’d have the police in on you in seconds.”
Sherlock walks to the center of the lounge. Overhead, weight shifts, a moan ripples through the floorboards.
John looked at William. “Why is that? You’re some kind of genius and you’re gorgeous and…”
“You’re infatuated with me?” That compelled a smile from John.
At times, dark times, he thought it would be easier if he just didn’t exist. He’d idealized how he’d do it. Ella worried about him carrying a gun, but what did she know about his bleakest hours?
John chuckled. “You’ve got a big, beautiful cock. I’m gonna enjoy this.”
Bonnie made one of those worried sounds, a cluck of her tongue and a sigh. “I just wish there was something more I could do for him. And for her. But I’m just an old lady and what do I know, right?”
Well, there wasn’t much he could do about it.
“The lines Victor highlighted were not intended for me. Not in the way you think.” Sherlock licked his lips again, his voice a gentle rasp of gravel. “He left those words, and his note, because like you, he thinks I should be...romantically involved.”
As he walks up the stairs, he gets the sense that a presence lurks in his flat. He pauses. Notes the time and checks the steps for signs of mud or debris. It was a dry day aside from the light fog that started to rise with the twilight, but he looks anyway.
William’s chuckle resonated through him.
“Yes. I’m in the downtown area.” He’d ended up taking the one-bedroom condo. The neighborhood wasn’t too awful, and the condo came furnished. It belonged to a man who was jailed for tax fraud, according to the man’s mother, who was renting it out. It suited him perfectly, with restaurants within eating distance—once he started making any money. For now, it was canned beans, ramen, and cereal.
“I’m serious. You may be the bloody genius here, but that doesn’t mean I’m a pushover,” John says and wags his finger. “You hear me, Sherlock?”
He stared up at the ceiling. Worked his throat. Forced the words out. “It didn’t matter, though. Everything was destroyed. I got a job as an overnight stocker for a grocery store, and then I had to move. I couldn’t stay with the Stamfords with their first child on the way. I was on the move for several years because Mary’s...
Sherlock’s pulse lifts. “Good,” he says, though he almost stumbles over the word as it exits his mouth. “That’s....thank you.”
Sherlock stills. Listens. Head tilted like a cat and every muscle as still as stone.
“So you thought you’d go through my personal things and borrow some?” His tone borders on angry.
John stepped down the stairs and out onto the stoop of 221B. His skin crawled a bit with the idea of presenting this new person to the world. To his coworkers, at least. Getting divorced. They’d agreed to go public with their relationship once the divorce was final. It gave John time to wrap his mind around the fact that what he had desired all along had become his reality.
“Poor guy. Must have seen some terrible things.”
“Yeah,” he said as he pursed his lips. He’d learned well at his dad’s knee. And he was smaller than the other boys in the Georgia Liberation Front, but he was quick and he hit where it counted. “A few. Are you an angry person?”
“It’s mine, Sherlock, and if I’m staying down here, it stays with me,” John says. The whip-crack of heat in his voice sends an unwelcome jolt down Sherlock’s spine, like a lightning flash. Static electricity seems to hang heavy in the air. John continues, his voice thick with displeasure. “You’ve got dead things in the lounge and body parts in the kitchen, and you want to talk to me about a doll?”
William’s face showed his surprise, eyes wide and mouth ajar.
“Oh.” John blinked. Victor stood, and of course he was bloody tall. Taller than Sherlock or Mycroft, by at least two or three inches.  “Hello, I’m Doctor John Watson.”
But this job! He could end his lease on the cabin, set himself up with an apartment—
Sherlock heads down the stairs. The doll is lightweight, likely no more than a kilogram. The popping sound was the ball joint of her elbow coming undone.
He opened the door.
Or rather, John ate.
He looked up. William’s eyes were locked on John’s phone with a tightness in his face that John didn’t recognize.
“Then I shall tell you.” William stared at the wall, his eyes glassy. “Should I start at the beginning?”
His voice was pure sex, deep and smooth, clipped by thrusts of tongue to teeth and palate. A feverish sizzle unspooled in his gut, and John could swear his heart skipped a few beats.
“I - I don’t know.”
“What will you be doing while I’m gone?” John said, his throat clogged with emotion.
John barked a laugh at the thought of sleeping with Mike Stamford.
“Okay, sure.” John chuckles. “Don’t think I was doing that either, but maybe I wasn’t paying attention.”
“Doctor Watson,” he said.
The crowd was young professionals, at least younger than John’s thirty-eight years. Women in fashionable light sweaters, leggings, and heeled strappy sandals. Men in collared shirts or polos, wearing khakis or brand name jeans. John’d been no slouch to fashion back in the day, but his years in Vermont led him to collect more lumpy sweaters and flannels than the average person probably warranted. Tonight, he wore jeans and the same collared shirt he'd worn for the interview. No tie, no suit jacket. His black dress shoes. On the nicer side of casual, but he had the feeling he lacked the sophistication other men in this room flaunted with ease.
He stared at the words as his fingers clenched into fists. It wasn’t fair. In his appointment with Ella the other day, he’d griped about his astronomical debt. His work as a mystery author, along with the odd job here and there, wasn’t enough to cover his bills and back-breaking student loans. Had he become the doctor he’d wanted to be, he probably would have been fine. But secluding himself in the green Vermont countryside and writing to earn his keep wasn’t cutting it. What he ‘wouldn’t give for a regular paycheck,’ he’d said to her.
He scratches behind one ear as his eyes duck away. “I, um, I found a pawn shop, and I sold the doll.”
John knew the next line by heart and smiled as he beat Sherlock to it. “I shall feel all the happier when I see you again.”
“Holy christ. And - people I’ve visited? I’ve just come from a friend’s -”
The rest of the dinner passed in a haze of come-hither stares and softly uttered innuendos, checkered with William’s observations of other diners in the room and John’s entirely-too-loud giggles. They skipped the dessert menu. An Uber picked them up. They tumbled into bed with vigor, grasping and groping and frotting, each chasing their release until fantastic completion.
A smile bubbled up. “Good. Really good.” When John had finally gotten up the nerve to tell Mike that he and William were dating, Mike didn’t even blink an eye. His face opened up like the clouds parting, all shining eyes and shining teeth. He joked William was a ‘looker’ and John was ‘lucky to snag him.’
How would John explain himself?
“And did you meet him at Baker Street?”
It started with a headache unlike any other.
“No, I mean about the coronavirus. Cases are rising in Britain. You really shouldn’t stand too close to people, and make sure you wash your hands -”
A voice in his head chimes,
“Yeah. You know, I realised that it was holding me back. Maybe holding us back. My parents...my parents died a long time ago. It’s been years, and though I’ll never forget them, or feel at peace with what happened, I shouldn’t let it control my future. So here. Right now. I’m leaving the past behind. And I’m moving forward, with you.
“If you used your -”
Sherlock shrugs into his coat and ties his scarf. John’s sneakered feet drum down the stairs.
Maybe he should call Ella.
“Hmph,” Sherlock says, feeling a tightness at the nape of his neck and between his shoulder blades. His equilibrium is upset. Pricked. Prickly. Like cat’s claws walking across his scapulas. He rolls his shoulders.
Sherlock couldn’t know. That was the whole point. And if Sherlock didn’t know, then Mary didn’t know, and John would never have to know, because he was here in this house with its garden and his wife and their daughter, and that was the end of it. His success; his achievement. A life of heteronormative achievements. He could tell his parents to go fuck themselves if they were still alive.
One avian silhouette catches his attention now - one that’s been hanging around more and more as of late. The bird perches in the nearby weeping cherry tree, its leaves like dripping orange flames at this time of year. Sometimes Sherlock thinks that the bird, perhaps a crow, is waiting for him.
Ned looked away. “I can still see their eyes at night.”
He stared at the floor though his jaw ached and the beginnings of a headache poked in from one temple. The vise that had been tightening his chest squeezed and he was desperate to breathe, to exhale, to let it all out. “You leave me out of things because you like to prove that you’re clever. And - with Mary, you… You did it again. You and Mary with your stupid jokes. I was just some dog. Except I didn’t bite you.”
“Well, it’s settled then. You’ll move your things into my room and that way we have easier access to each other’s bodies.”
John released his breath as the man left the office. He stared at the spider plant hanging by the window, variegated green and white leaves hanging down, a new baby dangling in the air off the parent plant. Sins of the father redeemed by the son. Sins of the wife, redeemed by the husband?
“I hope so.” She pushed her glasses to the top of her head. “It’s a shame what they do to these poor men and women. So many forgotten heroes left to their own devices.”
If you like my work, you may like a spooky post-canon fic,
Sherlock slid his arms around him and held him tight.
“Oh? How’s that going?” he said, his voice soft with sympathy. Bonnie was usually full of good cheer and town gossip, but she’d been in knots over her family situation. Her grandson, Steve, was suffering PTSD after his tour in Afghanistan. His mother, Leslie, was at her wit's end.
“I’m just saying, you’ve been in a sulk, and it’s not just anxiety over this whole having to stay inside all the time thing. You look at your phone like it’s going to bite you.” She smirked at him in that knowing way that he used to find endearing. “He can’t bite you through the phone.”
“Mmm.” John watched as William pulled several times on his dick, then squeezed the tip. A shimmering drop appeared at the slit. William swiped his forefinger over the droplet, and brought it to his tongue.
“Um, no, actually.” John placed his medkit back on the shelf, praying this line of questioning would end.
“Yeah. It’s not the same. He’s not the same. I feel like I’m just watching him fade away into this little old man. The only time I see him smile is for Rosie, or for you-know-who.”
It was nice to share this. And, it felt like maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t as big a loser. Did he seem like a loser to these guys? He did the occasional Grindr hookup, but when they talked about clubbing and dating and random meetups, John had little to contribute.
“Let me show you around, John,” Molly said, and grabbed his arm.
After teasing his lover’s nipples, he feathered his tongue along obliques and across abs, dipping into William’s navel, listening to William’s deep chuckle as he did. William’s muscles tensed as John hovered over the fly of his pants.
In the afterglow, when they’re cleaned up and resting in each other’s arms, John whispers to him, “I didn’t know it was you I was looking for all my life.”
“It was good on me.”
“Why?”
Ella with her sharp brown eyes and buzzed haircut, she’d peered at him, scrutinized him with those eyes until he felt like a fish being filleted.
John put the book down in his lap. “My voice needs a rest. Why don’t you talk for once?” it came out as more of a statement than a question.
“I want to do this,” Sherlock says. Eager, now.
But did it matter?
“Like you don’t already know that about me.”
John huffed a laugh. “Yeah. So Mike’s said.” He stretched his neck and rubbed it. “They still tried me, even as thin as the evidence was. All they had was her sob story. I asked to speak to her, but they refused to let me see her. I—I couldn’t believe that she said all that crap about me. I was so naïve then. I kept thinking it had to be some kind of mistake.” He breathed out again. “The house where I lived with Mary got trashed. Graffiti on the house and rocks thrown through windows, eggs crushed in the mailbox, sacks of shit left on the porch. I couldn’t go back to my residency. I stayed on Mike’s couch for a while. He was the kindest person to me. Anita, too. They’d been married a while and then Anita got pregnant and my trial was in progress and the whole thing was shit. My mom fled to her sister’s in Wisconsin—she says she was planning it all along, but that was such bullshit.
snow. John did his best to copy the Connecticut accent, but it took time to hide his drawl. Still, switching high schools in ninth grade hadn’t been too bad. He was quick and skilled on the sports field, and that tucked him right in with the more popular kids.
John turned his face away, but the statement drew a smile from his lips. “Me too. Um, I mean, I feel the same way.”
“I think I will as well.”
“Yes.”
John grimaced, but said nothing. Mary worked now as a receptionist for a dentist. He flat out refused to stay with her if she went back to nursing on a faked degree. She loathed the receptionist job but hadn’t looked for anything else. He didn’t encourage her to look, giving her free reign on what she wanted to do professionally, so long as it stayed within the legal realms of the law.
Some past violence is described here. For content warnings, please check the end notes.
Candlelight set the room aglow while soft violin music played over the speakers. The gleam of William’s eyes reflected the gentle illumination of the room as they chatted over dishes of
“Fuck the entrees. I want dessert.”
“I thought I should ask, rather than assume,” Sherlock said as he stepped forward.
“Doctor Watson, I’m glad you could make it.” Dr. Chowdhury appeared at his side. She didn’t smile, but her words seemed genuine.
William tipped his face to his. “Holiday plans?”
Thank you so much for your comments and kudos. I value them all, and am answering comments as I get a chance to sit down and do so! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
'Have you ever had anal sex with a woman?'
But eventually, Greg had to solve it by himself, for Sherlock is still in his coma after the third month.
'I do! But it stopped whatever you were starting there,' he says, making a sound of frustration.
'Oi, it can happen to any man.'
'I'd pay even if you had.'
John grumbles, turning in Sherlock's back. The TV is still on and there is a woman's voice, music and moans. He opens his eyes. 'What woman?'
He stares at her and she stares back.
. Watson.'
John grins. 'When did you realise you liked him?' he asks then.
'That's just you,' Sherlock says. 'Except you didn't seem like you wanted to go on dates with me.'
'Beginning to?' Mike echoes and scoffs.
'Can I… can I have your private mobile number?'
'Coat?' John asks and gets up.
'The victim's uncle. Goodness, John why are you so stupid today? Call Lestrade. If I'm right, you help me get out of here. If I'm wrong, you can go home. I'll bribe someone.'
Sherlock shrugs. 'Not much. You got a new haircut towards the end. I liked it.'
'Hmm?'
'It's not Calvin.'
John kisses him. 'Not at all.'
Sherlock frowns. 'You're my friend, John.'
'Bye, John.'
,' Sherlock says and scrunched up his nose.
'The new patient's brother wanted none but you. Um, he's called … Christ what was it? Er, it sounded like Microsoft or so.'
Sherlock doesn't die and doesn't wake up.
'You're really not helping create a romantic mood, you know?'
John smiles. 'Did you actually sleep with him?'
She chuckles. 'We've all seen how you looked at that Sherlock Holmes back then. You'd have asked him out, had he ever woken up.'
'Your friend.'
In fact, John is not there.
Sherlock takes a look at it. 'Dull.'
Watson. John
Mike is quiet, looking up as he thinks. Then he shakes his head and pats John's shoulder. 'Sorry, buddy, I don't think I know anybody you could ask.'
John glances to his girlfriend. 'There are other competent doctors there, you know that. This is my free time, it's bloody Christmas Eve. I have plans.'
There is a long silence.
John sits back. 'Sorry, I'm a bit lost here,' he mutters eventually.
'What? …oi, Dr Watson, you don't need to – there are competent people in there taking care of the junkie. It's covered, you can go home.'
They haven't really spoken about the coma again. Sherlock doesn't appear to have the need for it and John doesn't know what to say.
'That's what you always say,' Sherlock grumbles.
'Oh and did you know about those serial suicides? Was in the papers last week.' Obviously, Sherlock's eyes are closed (and he doesn't listen anyway), but John still holds up the newspaper. 'They've solved it, finally.' He smiles a little. 'Bit slow without you, hm?'
But he's afraid this derails into an awkward conversation about love and other things. Sherlock's certainly been in love with his version of John and John doesn't know if he is all that different in reality. Character wise, that is. It's strange to think that Sherlock might be deeply in love with him as he is.
'Perhaps he's lost it.'
'What?'
'You're tedious, John.'
'Mary. But she died from a bullet intended for Sherlock. Only after making a baby with me, of course.'
John sighs.
'What uncle?'
'You say he knows?' Mycroft asks eventually and John nods.
The moment lasts too long for John to not feel the heat creep into his cheeks so he turns away and sits in the chair. 'You are officially allowed to leave the bed now, you know?'
'Yeah, I want this,' John says. He sits up, straddling Sherlock, and slowly takes off his shirt. 'You too, yeah?'
A nurse arrives soon enough, the computer having called someone. Together, they work quickly, figuring out what exactly is wrong, what needs to be done and how. They have to be fast, but Sherlock will be in the stable position again. He will, John tells himself. And some day, he'll wake up. They just have to be quick and professional now.
'Can you tell me tomorrow?' John asks sleepily. 'Not now.'
'Epic. Your mind must have put on quite the show.'
'As soon as they arrest the guy,' John hears himself promise. 'You should have some rest.'
'He'll be over the moon,' John replies with a smile.
Sherlock tries to toss a pen at John. 'I'm trying ask you for a break here, John,' he says. 'Some distance,' he adds when John frowns. 'I need time to myself to think.'
either. And I'm not gay! He's a patient, I care about all my patients,. That's why I'm a doctor.'
The dark skinned woman at the tape doesn't allow them to come closer but luckily Lestrade sees them and jogs over. He looks incredibly relieved to see Sherlock and surprised that John's there as well.
On a particular day in June, John hurries into Sherlock's room, bent over a little. He closes the door firmly then steps towards the bed. 'I really know I shouldn't do this, but you never open your eyes so…' He goes quiet and sets down something small on the bed. It meows and moves. Gently, he takes Sherlock's hand so his fingers touch the soft fur. 'She's really cute, Sherlock.'
He said my name again. I clench my hands against white porcelain instead of punching the mirror. Squeeze my eyes shut against the harsh light. Did he somehow change every lightbulb while I was in the shower?
"I am.” The words come out harsher than he intended.
He breathes hard into his shaking palms, cupping them against his mouth to feel the warm air.  Listens to it regulate, calming himself with the sound.
“The one time Sherlock Holmes apologizes for something and he’s done absolutely nothing wrong.” John is smiling.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
A growl rips from your throat as you shove a pillow over your face, the tapping rain becoming incessantly louder.
He collapses back against the soft and slightly damp pillow, realizing that his body is not sore.
“I want this,” I blurt out the words, staring at his chest. I can’t stop myself now. The words I’ve kept hidden for so long rush out of me and I don’t want to stop. Every word that’s been teetering on the edge of an unsteady cliff, I
. Because he hasn’t seen this version of me. “I don’t want you here,” I growl, covering my chest with my shirt as I brush past him.
That voice. Dangerous. Possesses the power to erase all the time and space between us. Its gentleness has been resting in my heart, shut away from the light, like a silent bomb ready to detonate at any second. Five minutes ago would have been a proper time.
There is another sound filling the air of his room. He shakes his head to clear it and holds his breath.
Crisp. Cool. Dark.
“Sorry?”
And John is suddenly falling, falling,
. With each inhale the burn fades. The weight lightens. All of your focus is on the strong hands against your ears, the fingers tangling in your hair. The soft breath of whispered words caressing your face.
Where the hell did he even get a shovel? God only knows, but he starts digging anyway.
“You’re taller than I’d thought you’d be.” He drops his hand back to his side and clenching it into a fist, looking up at me from under-
“Mhm. Broken syringes in the trash too, in case you were wondering.”
“Your brother-”
He steps forward on shaking legs before kneeling next to Greg, who only glances at him before turning back to whisper to Sherlock.
Neither of them has spoken a word since Sherlock took John's shaking hand and led him to his bed. The silence feels so uncomfortable Sherlock finds himself holding his breath, the sound of it impossibly loud in the quiet room.
John Watson.
“John. Look at me. John.” He waits, heart pounding until John looks up at him. “Just breathe for a moment.”
You inhale just to see if you can. The wheeze is unexpected, shocking you so much that the edges of sleep fall away. It feels as though you haven’t taken a proper breath in days and the inability to do so leaves you panting.
I want to scream the words. Wrench myself sideways and create as much distance between us as possible. Before I can react, his skin is against mine and my brain stutters to a halt.
His breath hitches and I can’t stand it any longer. I’m across the living room floor and kneeling in front of him in an instant. What I expect is for him to flinch, clear his throat, rise from his chair and mumble about making tea. What I do not expect is for him to catch the front of my shirt in a gentle fist and pull me towards him. Which is exactly what he does.
Sherlock forces his own breathing to calm, watching closely as John does the same.
His steadying breath almost ruins me.
Pounding. Pounding.
Sherlock says in his head.
“No,” dropping the half-burnt cigarette and crushing it under my foot.
"You will be no good to him in this state. Tomorrow morning I will have a car collect you."
'Him?'
'He hasn't woken up since he got here,' John breaks the heavy silence. It had been his task to fill this Mycroft Holmes in with what they knew and he's gone through several lists and forms with him. 'It might tip into a coma.'
'Like I imagined it,' Sherlock says and smiles, picking up his violin. 'How are you going to introduce me in your first blog post? Any way you can leave out my drug habits?'
Mycroft lets out a small chuckle. 'No need to get so defensive, Dr Watson.'
'Uh, the one you woke up from last week. You were gone for a whole year after that Moriarty thing.'
Sherlock's piercing blue eyes fixate on him, like a predator looks at its prey. Or as if he's about to say
'Aren’t you gonna…?'
'I'm thinking about giving him an MP3-Player for Christmas. Or rather a radio?' John jokes as he grabs his walking stick.
A myriad of emotions fly over Sherlock's face before he can school his face and straighten. 'So we never went to solve a single case together?' he asks coolly.
'Hey, they show that Victorian ghost detective film today, and Mary's at a friend's place over the weekend anyway, shall we watch it together? It's about this bride whose ghost rises again. Critics say it's surprising and clever.'
Sherlock tells him the story of Baskerville. It is very epic.
'Haven't seen him for two weeks,' Sherlock says. 'I don't think he knew anything before.'
shouldn't even try to think.'
'Not a very healthy lifestyle, was it?' John mocks gently.
'But the police don't go to private detectives.' He pauses. 'They go to Sherlock.'
They both look up at the waiter with a certain annoyance in their faces. 'Just water for now,' John says.
'Terrible, but I'll be better. Let's go and see Lestrade.' He tries to sit up and moves his legs over the edge of the bed.
It's more difficult to stop thinking of all that. Even if all John's lost is a little habit, more of a ridiculous tradition really, it's difficult to be a doctor and to know that by now Sherlock must have died. John could get Mycroft's phone number probably, and just ask, but John knows what answer he is going to hear because he is a doctor, he has seen the reports and he knows. Though Anderson suddenly started to come up with ridiculous theories, like that Sherlock actually woke up and got some new organs. Or that the whole thing was faked.
John startles a bit. 'Well, I didn't see that one coming,' he mutters.
It's weird working in hospital and not seeing Sherlock for a longer period of time. Completely different to when John thought Sherlock had died because he was very alive and awake and close now and more importantly, John knew him now. A bit.
'Neither.'
'A good doctor would never do this,' he mutters while pulling the covers back and setting down a stack of clothing on the bed. 'No-one who's in their right mind would do this. You've clearly manipulated me. This is the stupidest thing I've done.'
'Did I look differently?'
Fortunately, Sherlock doesn't laugh at him.
'Come on, John.' Sherlock rolls his eyes. 'Girlfriend? Not my area. Does that ring any bells?'
'Idiot.'
Sherlock shakes his head. 'You wouldn't be here if he disapproved,' he says matter-of-factly.
'Making people laugh isn't the same as flirting.'
. Of all things. I'd just got to terms with Hamish.'
John calls Mycroft but they still haven't found the guy who created the Moriarty drug. The fucking mixture isn't even off the market.
'Hurry, John.'
'Experiments.'
And Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.'
'He was oddly calm about it but Sherlock explained to me that he had dreams that were sort of contortions of the reality. So while he did seem to know a lot of things about me or the past months, he keeps getting them confused.'
John doesn't listen to him and lets the weeks and months pass. Maybe (probably) it's good that he spends less of his free time in the hospital. John has met someone.
He keeps looking at him, which might be a bit creepy if Sherlock wakes up, but he doesn't. The ads change to the film, but it's still muted so he doesn't notice. It's quiet and outside, it's getting dark. John shifts in his chair, half asleep and then he really dozes off.
'Move it…yeah, like that… no, more like–yes, yes, that's good. Oh, oh, John…'
'I'm texting Molly Hooper.'
'Oh. Him. Why did you call him Greg? Does he pretend to be somebody else sometimes?'
Luckily, though, officially they remain just that because nobody notices when they get back and Sherlock gets back into bed. Mycroft stops by again that evening just when Sherlock is being transferred to another room in a different part of the hospital. He's awake but drowsy from the medicine they just gave him. While Mycroft and John have a little talk in the cafeteria, John feels like Mycroft is looking right into his brain again, much like his brother does but with Sherlock, John feels more comfortable.
Sherlock's lips curl up in an amused smile. 'Worrying about cleaning?' he asks, not in a mocking way, though. 'I can explain you how to do it. Is that awkward? There are good guides online.'
'They actually still fuck each other when Anderson's wife not at home,' Sherlock says.
His first destination is the coffee vending machine. Ah, elixir of heaven. John gulps down all of it before he even reaches the right floor to start his shift. It's a dull day at work, a particularly exhausting but dull and tiring day and the only person not complaining is Sherlock but then again, he never does. Sometimes, John wishes he would.
'Yeah, but what about the case? It was the uncle, right?'
It takes the detective in the book awfully long to get a single hint and John rants how even he has understood more. His gaze falls on Sherlock's calm expression as he talks and he loses track of the initial topic. Instead he asks him questions about his consulting detective work. It really is ridiculous so he stops after a while and instead just imagines going on a case with Sherlock. Chasing criminals through London.
He waits. As naturally, patiently, as he used to all those years ago. It’s infuriating. I glare long enough that the shyness fades away and he glances down, sucking in a nervous breath before looking up to stare back at me once more. The hope now present in his gaze has my stomach twisting itself into knots.
"Take me to him."
It wakes you from your sleep.
“Is she late?” I try my best to keep my voice as uncaring and cold as I can, but the glint in his eyes tells me that he heard the slight crack as well.
"John."
"Because I've already forgiven you."
“No. I’ve got it. Thanks, mate.” A door slams. “Your landlord is a prick.”
Standing on shaking legs, Sherlock crosses his room in an instant, kneeling in front of John.
“Exactly as I said, Dr. Watson. We will have to reschedule this little reunion,” Mycroft replies, glaring right back at him.
Sherlock looks...christ, he looks the same and so different at the same time. The first thing John notices is the fading bruises marring the pale skin of his face, along with a cut on his cheek that has been stitched.
Chest stuttering, you place a trembling hand over your eyes to block out the hazy moonlight shining through your window in a weak attempt to calm yourself. Darkness falls over you like a blanket. The quiet calm lasts only a moment.
Sherlock freezes. His shivering body, trembling mouth. Everything stops and the silence is deafening as John waits for something awful to happen.
“Dr. Watson,” she greets, smile growing wider by the second as if it is not weird at all that she knows his name just by seeing his face.
"There were complications. He-" Mycroft sighs, pulling a handkerchief from his pocket and pressing it firmly to his nose, eyes downcast. "He was retrieved only a week ago."

I don’t want that. Do I? Toss the phone on the Persian rug Mycroft sent as an obligatory housewarming gift. As if there could ever be anything warm about this place. Though burning it to the ground might do the trick. Now the wooden floors are vibrating. I sneer at the thin, offending rug as I pick my phone back up.
He’s lost count.

Greg nods.

Thank you all so much for such a beautiful response to this! ♥ It means the absolute world to me!
were a prelude to something wonderful. Like seeing a ship come in or finding a note in your letterbox when you weren’t expecting one. That swift, surprising transition from nothing to everything.
“Don’t have one.”
Familiar anger simmers through him for a moment before his attention is back on Sherlock, body aching to run to him. It takes a few tries to slide the keycard into the slot before he’s gripping the handle and slowly pushing the door open.
John shoves both hands through his hair, gripping the edges and pulling. "I've just found out that I have been
John leans back in his chair trying hard to control his breathing. I have to fight the urge to ask him specifics. These days, it could be any number of things.

He doesn’t want to know. Whatever that file has to say will not prepare him to...to see
Two little words that hold a world of promise.
“How many- Fuck, Sherlock. How many times has that happened?” John cries, thrusting a hand out, face crumpling once more as he buries his face against his knees.
Mycroft looks stressed. The lines across his forehead seem to have made themselves permanent today. His eyes are red and a light sheen of sweat coats his brow.
“Don’t,” Greg says, gently grasping John’s wrist and pulling it back. “Don’t touch his face...he freaks out a bit.”
, alone. His body falling slightly to one side where I should have-
Relieved?
The sounds around me come to life once more as I push through the swarm of bodies, ignoring the mindless chatter trying to swallow me whole and pulling a pack of cigarettes from my pocket. Smile as I wrench the back door open and feel the relief of frigid air rushing over me. Alone.
John studies Mycroft's face. He can see a brief pass of some emotion pass his face and it all he needs to know. "He's hurt."
He was only half aware of where his feet are carrying him and the next thing he knew he was waving down a cab with a heavy arm, practically growling his destination to the cabbie who glared at him in response before begrudgingly turning his eyes to the road.
Or maybe the twentieth.
Nodding at her, John slowly does as instructed, gripping the door handle and stepping through. The hallway is long, with three fairly large rooms on each side. Six slightly tinted windows allowing someone to see inside adorn each one. The large black doors are numbered and a card swiper sits beside each one. Before John can even make it to the end of the hallway, Mycroft steps out of what seems to be an office at the end of the hall to intercept.
The first time I see him feels like one of those ridiculous romance movies. Him standing by the front door, head down, beautiful eyes underneath long lashes, catching my gaze and holding it. I don’t really know if his eyes are beautiful, I’m too far away to tell, or if his eyelashes are very long, but standing here in a mess of sweaty bodies and drunken smiles, I can only see him. And he’s beautiful.
“No, ah,” he laughs nervously. “It’s good-you’re a good-”
. “How long did it take?”
“Yes.” Sherlock nods, standing and offering a pale hand to John.
The rasp of sheets jolts him and he turns his head to find John lying on his side staring at him. "Breathe, Sherlock."
He barely has enough time to reach the bathroom before falling to his knees and getting sick.
Slowly, as if reaching out to a terrified animal, John lifts his hand once more, placing it gently on Sherlock’s left cheek.
“Your heart is racing.” My thoughts come to an abrupt halt. His gentle fingertips are resting against the pulse point of my wrist, my sleeve pushed up -
“I wasn’t going to, you git,” he laughs, shoving me playfully and then pulling me back to kiss the corner of my mouth. “I was going to say thank you.”
“Did you come here just to insult me?” I sit up, blinking rapidly to clear the black dots coating my vision, mostly from the damned light. My foot knocks against something on the floor and I wait until he looks away to judge some other part of my flat before looking down. As silently as I can, I push my foot against the wooden box to nudge it back under my bed.
“This is important, love.” The sentiment sobers me and I feel a push and pull between my head and my heart. He cannot possibly mean that. It was a slip of the tongue, something he’ll wake up and regret tomorrow. An endearment that was never, could never be meant for me from this impossibly beautiful man. This man I’ve put through so much and he’s still here and I- “I just need you to know that...me too. I’ve wanted this too.”
"John-"
All he had dreamed of for the past two years, wished for, was for Sherlock not to be dead or to join him and end this cycle of mourning. He’d been ripped to shreds. Devoid of emotion. And now...now he knows ‘

“Is this going to become a habit of yours?”
to say it. “I’ve wanted this for-...for so long. You don’t realize, John. You don’t know how long-“
“-the goddamn door!”
John wants to yell or scream at him, but his lungs are burning and he can't find the air, let alone strength, to do anything, but collapse.
“Your own good.”
“Your acting like a child.” Ah. Still too patient with me. Doesn’t want to hurt me more than he already has. Have to go a bit deeper.
The weight sitting on your chest.

And there it is. My name in
He nods and John moves. Reaches out to pull Sherlock into his arms. They settle only when Sherlock’s head rests over John’s heart, his head rising and falling with each calm breath.
“I hear you, John. And I forgive you. Please hear
He’s ridiculous. The most ridiculous man to think he needs to apologize for needing me as much as I need him. We could go back and forth, stumbling over our embarrassed words and defending each other’s actions. It’s pointless and something about this night is too fragile for such unnecessary things. We are tired. Tired of hiding behind stumbled words and embarrassed apologies. So I do the same thing he did. It’s awkward at first, reaching for his hands and pulling him down. He ends up in my lap, both of us giggling with slightly confused expressions. It’s awkward and then it isn’t.
And now his feet are on soft grass, moving him quickly past gravestone after gravestone until he arrives at the one he loathes with every fiber of his being.
Domesticity has never been the same since John Watson limped into my life. The joy of simply being in each other’s company stripping away the dullness from day to day life. Now, it’s brilliant. It is wrapping arms around one another while one cooks and the other makes tea. It is smiling through large bites of food that puts a swell of pride on John's face. It’s picking bits from his plate as I’ve done for years, but now that seems to matter more; it’s intimate, a facet of our love, known to both of us.
. That
“You were- uh...Sorry.” ...
“Uh...Yeah,” John starts managing a small smile but by the slight frown that passes across her face, it must have been more of a grimace. “I’m here to see-,” he clears his throat and tries again. “I’m here to-”
His tears collide with the blood slowly pooling around him. And he just wants it to stop.
Even the thought of opening it makes his stomach twists itself into a knot.
Sherlock hadn’t ever known himself to be a vocal sleeper, even in the throes of a nightmare.
Hold it until the weight grows impossibly heavier, settling comfortably enough to burn you from the inside. Melting the frost. The burn leaves you gasping.
“For what?’ I rise slowly, pulling my shirt over my head as I try to steady myself.
“Breathe, Sherlock,” he whispers, lips run along your hairline and you can feel yourself melting. “Breathe for me.”
“Down the sink?” Wrench a cabinet open and slam a glass down, filling it from the tap and draining it in a few large, painful gulps.
“What the hell does that mean?” John growls, glaring and trying to decide whether to slip past him. Mycroft notices and places himself in the middle of the hallway, straightening his shoulders.
You can feel from the twitch in his fingers that he is itching to do more. To run his hands over your tense body. To whispers reassurances. But it’s enough. This man, this beautiful man grounding you in his arms. Radiating comforting heat. It’s bliss. And you can feel your body sinking into the feel of it.
“Hm?” Tilt my head in mock innocence just to watch his glare intensify.
Rain beating against your window. The rustle of bed sheets beneath you. Even the desperate sound of your own shallow breathing grates on your ears.
“Not even close.” His voice is all too near. I spin, shoving my lower back against the counter when I see him moving across the floor towards me, tense hand stretched out.
“It’s alright, John.”
I can’t think of a single thing to say. No lie. No excuse for the misspelling. This hollow feeling in my mind, my chest is one I’m not accustomed to. Not anymore.
Did I say that? No. I know that voice; it’s haunted me for eight years.
Loud.
He looks...small. Frail. Fragile. He has his back pressed hard into the far corner of the room. His eyes are distant, staring at seemingly only something he can see. There is a man kneeling in front of Sherlock and it takes John longer than he’d like to admit to recognize who it is.
“Your date.”
John scoffs at him and before he’s even aware of what he is doing, he has Mycroft pinned against one of the glass windows.
As day fades into night and snow falls from the sky, John sits in his armchair watching me play the violin.
John stares, watching the exhaustion and emotion flint through Greg’s eyes. How long has been here taking care of Sherlock? Why him? Why not John?
Throwing on some jeans and a jumper after quickly brushing his stale mouth, John grabs his essentials before rushing down the stairs and out the door.
I’ve not been outside for more than two minutes before careful footsteps sound to my right and then-
The effect is immediate.
"Two years," John screams, at least he tries to. He's on his knees in front of Mycroft, not even sure how he got there, but he can see in the bleak darkness that a bruise is forming on Mycroft's cheek and his knuckles burn where they rest against his chest."Two-" He can feel the veins popping out of his forehead with the effort of trying to put the rage he feels into words, but it comes out as a hoarse whisper. He winces. Weak.
Sherlock brushes his thumb over John's lips. 'Well, my mind made up some parts,' he says, 'I… obviously I don't know how you behave in situations where you're likely to die.' He sighs, then he leans forward and kisses John. 'I miss those times.'
John shrugs, putting their empty bowls on the coffee table. 'Oh, I think she was rather jealous.'
'I can't believe I'm doing this,' John mutters and checks Sherlock through again. Whatever was in the drug, it resulted into a very weird sort of coma because Sherlock is in a better state than to be expected. Still, he is very weird. Clearly, his brainwashing skills though are perfectly alright. John fetches soup for to see if he can eat and then waits another thirty minutes until he finally decides to carefully remove the needle on the back of Sherlock's hand and sets him free from all artificial nutrition.
John remembers something else. 'When he got here, he woke up briefly and said something about a killer and… what was it? Ah, ink in the victim's lymph knots. Could that be of any importance?'
'No, I want to hear you groan again,' John says without thinking. 'I want to know if you're loud during sex.'
Mycroft Holmes straightens, picking up his umbrella and letting it swing slightly. 'Consulting Detective, that's what he calls himself. The only one in the world. He invented the job.' One last time he looks to his unconscious brother. 'Take good care of him, Doctor Watson. Please.' Then he leaves.
Maybe it’s the quiet calm, quickly melting away my shock, bringing forth my need that I try so desperately to hide, but I cannot refuse him this. Wrapping my arms around his middle, I squeeze him just as tight. We stay still for a moment, his warm breath in my hair. I cannot help myself but bury my head further, breathing him in, committing the scent to memory and labeling it
“My apologies.”
“It’s not,” John cries, shaking his head viciously and breathing hard through his nose. “Jesus fucking christ, Sherlock. It-It’s not ok. It’s not fucking ok. What I did-”
Keeping his hands firm against your ears as you both collapse sideways. His breath is a whisper against your face. You're breathing his air.
It only hits me as I’m drifting off that he had a cane leaning against his chair at the restaurant.
the whole way out the door of this godforsaken restaurant.
Hell yes.
Not bleeding. Unharmed.
John scrambles to grasp his wrist. “Sherlock, no.”
"Retrieved," John repeats because apparently, he is only capable of speaking in one or two-word sentences right now.
Rough kisses filled with years and years of built up desire finally being released. And then, just holding onto each other, falling into a restful sleep with our hearts beating against one another’s.
“Shut your eyes, sweetheart,” John mouths and maybe he said it out loud but it’s quiet now.
John Watson is a genius.
"Where is he?" John growls, gripping hard at the grass beneath him in an attempt to stop himself from attacking Mycroft again.
The door. And a voice. An angry, fierce voice punctuated by a fist against wood.
He knows exactly what this is and he glares at the offending thing waiting to consume him with its contents.
"Leave me alone," John growls, reaching down. As soon as he does a hand on his shoulder rips him back and he lets out an anguished cry as he turns shoves Mycroft back.
and desperate pleas for more more
It’s a small building. White concrete, one large black door and no windows on the front.
Sherlock stops him with a gentle hand on his chin, forcing him to look up once more. His eyes are anguished and Sherlock can feel his heart clench.
'I'm not smuggling you out of the hospital,' John says then. 'What sort of doctor am I?!'
'Mhm. Don't stop that,' he mumbles. 'But do stop talking.'
within just half an hour. On the counter, above rows of sandwiches, a small electronic figure of Santa Claus is dancing. Apart from all that, it's nearly bearable in the café/snack bar, right across the street from St Bartholomew's Hospital.
'Seriously?!' he asks then and looks down.
'This man is dying,' someone behind John says and he turns to find another doctor there, standing next to Sally Donovan.
'That what I first believed to be real, then turned out to be a dream caused by a high consummation of drugs, was in fact partly true but different in reality than what I thought? Yes, I am aware of that, John, and to piece it all together correctly, prove it to myself and move on I NEED TO GO TO MY FLAT.'
'Where are we going, sir?' he asks with a glance at John in the rear mirror.
He rolls on top of Sherlock now and there's another long series of kisses on lips and necks. John lets it grow slower and more tender eventually before he ends up aroused. Not tonight.
Sherlock sighs in exasperation and takes a pen out of his inner suit pocket. He grabs a napkin and quickly writes down a few words. Then he hands it to John.
Sherlock makes himself comfortable on the bed again. 'I love you, too,' he murmurs.
'Go back to sleep, John.' Sherlock says softly, running his hand up and down John's spine slowly.
'Naturally,' says the man with a roll of his eyes and falls back into a state of unconsciousness, though his eyes move behind his eyelids as if he's slipped back into a dream.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. 'Tell me about it,' he mutters.
'What happens if you wake up alone?' he challenges.
'Don't be too proud to ask – ah – questions.' His sentence is interrupted by a gasp when John slides his fingers between Sherlock's cheeks until his fingertips find the rim and press gently at it. 'Wait, lube.'
?' Sherlock looks like he doesn't understand anything anymore.
'Not half as sexy as “doctor”.'
'Doesn't make much of a difference.'
He spots a small smile on Sherlock's face but Sherlock doesn't look up or say anything.
It's late when he leaves. They've talked some more, kissed some more. To be honest, when they were kissing in the hallway next to the door, John was close to asking Sherlock if he could just stay the night, but then Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and told John to bring milk, cucumbers and curry next time.
'The internet?' John asks, raising an eyebrow. 'Don't tell me you googled how to be a good… lover.' At what point exactly would they be “boyfriends”? There were going to get there, right?
'Huh?'
'You're planning to pay for me but let me stop you right there,' Sherlock says when John walks up to him on Wednesday. They're meeting in a small Italian restaurant, Sherlock's already sitting in a booth by the window.
Instantly, Sherlock stops. 'I was just… it's just your shirt. We don't need to go further tonight,' Sherlock says after breaking away from the kiss. He's visibly nervous now.
'Why exactly do you want to leave the hospital again?' he asks, feeling like an idiot indeed. Their banter has distracted him. He hasn't even told Sherlock about the coma yet though he wonders if Sherlock knows. The fact that he knew about Mary and Rosie, about Afghanistan and Anderson and how he talked to John as if talking to a friend builds up to the theory that he's heard everything that has happened around him. But why isn't he freaking out now? How can he be so calm? John composes himself. 'Sherlock. I mean, Mr–'
'It's his real name,' John says and gives him the file.
A whole month passes. Two.
'To convince me not to do something stupid like getting you out of here.'
'You look conflicted. You're not having qualms about smuggling me out of the hospital, are you?'
She lets him get away with that change of topic and they continue talking about everyday life stuff until they've both finished their coffee. John wouldn't admit it but as much as he likes her, he still misses spending some of his coffee breaks with Sherlock.
'Give me something to pick the lock,' Sherlock commands, holding out his hand.
'Can't get enough of me?' He pulls off his condom and Sherlock takes it from his hand. John doesn't even know if he's going to throw it away or keep it for experiments which should be weird but this was Sherlock.
'Wait,' Lestrade says and steps out of the room. 'Pull that on,' he gives John a white crime scene onesie and blue bags for his shoes.
'I love you, too, Sherlock,' John says.
'Yes, well, why would I have money on me?'
When he glances up, Sherlock's smiling. 'You were being so nice to me that I didn't realise for a whole week that we're not actually best friends that have saved each other's lives multiple times.'
Sherlock instantly shuts up and looks at him again, gaze sharp. 'I've been dreaming about kissing John Hamish Watson for years,' he says then, cocking his head ever so slightly. It's the mix of blatant honesty and teasing spite, that makes John's knees go a bit weak. Then, Sherlock just shrugs and puts his feet on the coffee table. 'But I suppose, if nothing better comes around, I'll have to take John Clive,' he continues airily.
John ignores her.
Sherlock chuckles tiredly. 'Promise you'll be in bed when I wake up,' he mumbles.
'It's a woman.'
'Anyway, I'm going to bring up the topic of moving in with each other tonight.'
'Just met your brother again,' he tells the unconscious man. 'He is proud to claim to be your arch-enemy. Do people have arch-enemies?'
'No worries, John,' Sherlock says and kisses him as soon as John pushes the shirt off him.
'Doctor Watson?' He glances aside to see the nurse that's been running in and out of that room next to Mary and him. 'About this new patient, could you come and have a look for a moment.'
'And I was alone with Moriarty! Twice. Come on, John. This way or another I'll get out of here anyway.' His smile is so confident and devilish that John nearly believes him. From Mycroft, Molly and Greg he's heard enough stories to know Sherlock would definitely try and do something crazy or manipulate somebody else to help him.
'And what?'
Surprised by that suggestion and Sherlock's sudden use of the crude words, it takes John several moments to realise Sherlock had merely meant to put John off his stride. He huffs a laugh. 'Not what you imagined the glorious first time with John Hamish Watson to be like,' he tosses back before thinking. Crazy how they can joke about it like this.
'That's rude.'
'Sorry, what?'
'Sap,' John accuses softly, smiling. 'Where's the cheesy morning sex in your visions?'
, John thinks, shifting a bit, handing sinking down again. A small smile plays on Sherlock's features but he visibly tries not to smile. His eyes are glinting, wonderfully blueish and greenish. As terribly cheesy as it may be, he loses himself for a moment, not yet leaning in. They have time after all and Sherlock doesn't seem like he's about to run away.
Two days have passed and Mycroft turned up twice, Lestrade, too, but Sherlock was asleep then. Neither Anderson nor Donovan got to talk to him and John feels weirdly smug about it.
'My best wishes to Sherlock.' He gets up. 'Ridiculous, but don't you talk to him anyway?'
'I have a case for him. A nice, bloody murder, that might cheer him up,' Lestrade says then and takes out his phone. 'Wanna see the pictures?'
John puts a hand on his nape and pulls him in for a lazy, open-mouthed kiss.
'Girlfriends are not your area?' John asks.
'You might want to avoid the fridge.'
Sherlock pokes him. 'I thought you were going to fall asleep,' he complains. 'Must you always have the last word?'
'Twenty. There was this madly attractive man in one of my classes at university who kept thinking about how to ask me out. It was so obvious. Amusing, too.'
'I would have loved to investigate a monster in Dartmoor with you.'
'No. The toes are in the bin. I've got some dead frogs wrapped in human skin next to the milk.'
'I watched that film about secret agents last night. And there was this guy who blackmailed people with things he knew about them. He had this strange memory technique only clever people can use. Greg told me you're pretty damn smart, so do you have a memory house? A mind house or so?'
John stares for a moment, then he narrows his eyes. 'You prepared that phrase to justify the fact you fucking googled dating advice.'
'Sap.' Sherlock smile is back. 'You really aren't making this easy for me, John.'
'You okay?' John checks.
John's ignored her and now pulls the door open. There are people in there indeed, another doctor, Anderson and two nurses. Oxygen is now artificially pumped into Sherlock's lungs, he's getting an injection and someone else is doing something else. A beep alarm is just being turned off as John enters but a look at the monitor is terrifying enough.
'You don't want a flatmate, you want a boyfriend.'
John pulls back. 'Why?' he asks with a frown.
'We have to entertain the possibility, Dr Watson.'
'Shush, Mike!' John needs to drink more before he can discuss that in more detail. 'I don't know, but I think he's in for it. He's got the experience with men anyway.'
John smiles. 'Tell me something about your dream. You and I were living together, you said?'
John frowns. 'Er… no… not that I know. A list of what?'
'It could be, if you want,' John replies, feeling utterly foolish.
The waiter brings them their drinks, but Sherlock doesn't notice. 'What coma?'
'I read crime novels and case files to you and I came up with theories.'
'It was quite nice, yes.'
'I proved that, instead of murdering the victim, he was involved in a burglary at the different end of the city.'
For quite a while, nothing really changes, but John has long since figured that this Moriarty stuff has messed with Sherlock's brain and body. And well, coma patients don't all wake up normally anyway. Some stay in the coma for decades and then die. Some wake up after years. And almost half a year has passed when it gets really bad for Sherlock, worse than the last time.
'I thought we're friends again,' Sherlock says. 'You said you'd forgiven me for the death of your wife.'
Another moment of silence, then Lestrade laughs. 'Fucking hell.' He pats John's shoulder. 'That was a good one.'
John rolls his eyes and their banter continues like that. John tells a bit about his week which must be terribly boring to Sherlock but he still listens to most parts of it, John thinks. However, Sherlock doesn't talk much about his private life. Instead he deduces the people around them to impress and entertain John.
'Do you think he would like your moustache?' Mary asks, breaking a heavy silence.
John narrows his eyes. 'You'd like it!' he says then.
'I really don't think so.'
John indulges him and presses his lips against Sherlock's. The kiss lasts and he presses closer. For quite a while the lie there and make out slowly in the most sappy way imaginable.
From the first date to a breakup in one evening. A round of applause, please. John gets up and clears his throat. 'Yes. Of course. I'll try to have the other doctor perform the routine checks on you.'
But Mike doesn't stop so John orders another drink.
'Don't be rude.'
'Hello, Doctor Watson. I see there were little anomalies with my little brother's blood pressure and heartbeat. I am aware that this is not ensuring too great danger or definitely promising that he wakes up soon, but I'd like you to stay near. Just to be on the safe side.' Mycroft Holmes pauses. 'I do have access to the computer that's constantly controlling him, don't question it.'
It's become cold. The streets are now filled with brown snow slush, the sky is grey and an icy rain starts and stops and starts again. People are rushing down the road. The tube is overly crowded. Everyone's cursing the weather, Christmas atmosphere won't really settle. Merely shop windows and the people in the ads are excessively joyful. In the restaurants and cafés, someone has at least tried to pretend the world really does consist of red and gold glitter. Some even have decorated trees. In Sherlock's room though, nothing even hints at the upcoming holiday season.
'You haven't even read one word, have you?'
There are about ten seconds of silence.
'Sure,' John says and tries to keep up with their fast pace. Damn his leg! 'Do we know who he is? Any relatives called?'
'The junkie's about to die, let's face it,' Sally Donovan, one of the nurses, says one day. 'Anderson thinks the same.'
'I'd say … private detective?'
'Am I allowed to eat this, Doctor?' Sherlock breaks the heavy silence and turns his menu, pointing at something. His tone is teasing.
Sherlock's expression is conflicted. 'If we must,' he says eventually.
Sherlock takes several deep breaths.
This kiss is less tender and more demanding than the previous one. John wants to show off his best skills and Sherlock's clearly enjoying himself. One of John's hands is on the small of Sherlock's back so he slides it further down until he can cup his arse. Sherlock pushes into the touch and slips a hand under John's shirt at his waist.
She stares at him. Around them, people rush for an arriving train. 'You know, my friends are wrong about you.'
'Seventeen.' He's glad the conversation is as easy as always. 'First wank?'
She turns and after the initial surprise they talk about the medical proceedings. Eventually, John leaves the room (reluctantly) and calls Mycroft. He doesn't pick up so John leaves a message, telling him to call back ASAP. He starts his shift then.
At about five o'clock in the morning, John fetches a coffee for himself and a tea for Sherlock. It's crazy how after a whole year, he was awake now and they were talking as if he always had been. Like friends. When Sherlock explained the case to him, John uttered a 'brilliant' and Sherlock smiled. John felt at ease talking to him, like before, but it was so much better now that Sherlock's eyes were open and focused on him. It was so much better now that he reacted and replied. Even if it were remarks like 'idiot' or 'stupid'. He said it in a fond tone, actually.
Sherlock doesn't give him a sarcastic answer but actually appears a bit nervous as well. 'John, well, you have been so nice to me. And after all this time and everything that happened, we're… you're my friend.'
John swallows. 'I'm sorry. It's just actually very easy to talk with you.'
'I need to see the victim's desk,' Sherlock announces, 'John. The wheelchair.'
John walks faster down the corridor.
'It was fun in the beginning and then it became a matter of principle. I didn't think you'd get my bloody birth certificate,' John says, holding the damn thing up.
Just when his hand touches the door knob, Sherlock speaks up again. 'Uncle.'
John's eyes widen in alarm. Somehow he manages to frown in confusion at the same time. And smile a bit.
Sherlock scoffs. 'What did you expect? Candles and roses?' he mocks.
They exchange a long look and Sherlock sighs when John takes out his mobile. 'Tell Mycroft his caring is flattering. Or bug Lestrade until he gives me a new case!'
Sherlock doesn't seem to mind it much. His face is as emotionless and peaceful as ever. Well, if one is attracted to men, unlike John obviously, one could say Sherlock Holmes is a very handsome man. With those cheekbones and that philtrum. Oh, and the dark voice. John remembers it from the day Sherlock arrived. Fit body, too, well, back then anyway.
'Has anything happened or did you spend hours goggling at his face again?' she asks sarcastically and studies the monitor.
'Just kidding, Greg.'
John nods and pulls him up, helping him back into the wheelchair.
Sherlock actually smirks. 'Don't pretend, John. You miss that kind of things. The thrill.'
Sherlock eagerly climbs on John's lap, dipping his head down to kiss him thoroughly with both hands cradling John's cheeks.
'Oh, I didn't even get to Baskerville yet.'
Sherlock pushes himself up, to look down at John. 'What?' His gaze is sharp, he's frowning and his eyes are examining John's face. 'What did you say? Did you not–'
'Not so quiet yourself,' John pants.
John frowns. 'I thought you heard everything that happened while you were in the coma. Oh! Was Rosie a human baby in your dream?'
Sherlock sniffs. 'I was looking at naked women in the morgue.'
The desk is a small one in a large room with many others. It's half eight pm now, so nobody is here right now apart from a caretaker and a manager. In the victim's wallet was an ID, now on the desks there are plaques with names. Sherlock pushes the chair away and rolls his wheelchair there instead. But instead of looking into the drawers, he just sits right in front of the computer and looks out over the room. Then, he checks the position of keyboard, mouse and screen and corrects his own.
He does fall asleep soon, feeling warm and safe.
Again, John smiles. 'Yes. Okay. I'm your friend,' he says because Sherlock looks strangely lost. John straightens then. 'Let's eat and get you back to the hospital before anyone notices you're gone.'
'As if.' He takes out the bowls and puts them under warm water from the tap for a moment while the water in the kettle starts to boil. Luckily, John's found milk, teabags and sugar. The quiet, only broken by the boiling water and then the spoons in the bowls as he stirs the sugar, is comfortable. It's good, John thinks, that they can have easy banter like this about seemingly everything and that the silence isn't awkward in the least when Sherlock is awake and watching John. It's good how they can sip tea from bowls together and talk about murder and medicine and lots of other things. Sherlock makes John laugh and seems less put off when he discovers more little differences between the coma and the reality.
He turns and presses his face against Sherlock's chest, grinning. 'What a choice of words.'
'John, please leave me alone.'
'Still… Hurry, John, I want to leave this bloody hospital.'
'I've heard there are elections in South Korea today, you must love your brother a lot that you decided to come here,' John says.
Sherlock sighs dramatically, looking out of the window again.
Now, he is standing in front of his younger brother, who is more or less peacefully lying in his hospital bed. Around the recently identified William Sherlock Scott Holmes are now several machines, one a monitor showing his heart beat, breathing etc. His brother keeps referring to him as Sherlock, though, instead of William.
Sherlock smirks. 'You wouldn't tell me.'
'How old were you?' John asks.
'You know, John, there's a reason why I don't ever watch TV with you. John.
'You'd rather have anyone but him on one of my tables,' she says, leaving the room.
'Yeah?' He leans a bit closer.
Sherlock pouts but he can't rebel really because he is weak and John is much stronger. Next to 221B Bakerstreet, there's a small bistro and that's where John is taking Sherlock, getting them both something to eat and drink.
. Watson, not John
'Do you even like all that crime drama?' he asks Sherlock.
John stuffs his hands into the pockets of his white coat, waiting for the other man to reveal the answer.
'I need to call Lestrade. No, I need to see him,' he says after the drinking, glancing around the room.
But Sherlock grabs the glass with fierce determination, gaze focused on it as if it was a hard challenge. Which it is, since it's much heavier than the small plastic remote and that bit should have powered Sherlock out enough. He was asleep for about a year. It's a wonder that he can move his hands and arms at all and talk so naturally already, not more than a slight slur to his words.
'You must have understood that it was the only way, John.' Sherlock huffs. 'Idiot.'
'Thought so,' John mutters. 'Does Greg know?'
'It's nice to know something you seem to want to know but don't,' John corrects himself.
Sherlock sighs. 'Can I borrow yours?' he asks.
The man is shaking, black curls sticking to his sweaty forehead. His breathing is rapid, far from normal. Just as John has assumed before checking, his heart is hammering very fast in his chest. Along his arm are several traces of injections, some fresh, others a day old and some mere scars. His face is pale, expression pained. It could be a pretty face, John thinks, the cheekbones and the philtrum could look quite attractive. To someone who liked men, that is. John isn't gay, and anyway it certainly does not matter now!
'I'm out of it,' Sherlock simply said.
'Oh. Too late for that.' He frowns at his phone, then at John, cocking his head to one side.
'It was great,' John says when he returns. 'I loved it.'
'Sherlock, stop!' John rushes over. 'You need rest.'
John applauds and gives Sherlock the shirt, helping him only a bit, same with the blazer.
For quite a while it goes on like this. They're getting to know each other on another level. John learns how much he likes it when Sherlock kisses his neck and his slightly scrubby chin brushes over John's skin. After that, he discovers how he can make Sherlock gasp if he tugs at his hair. Biting his lip appears to be appreciated as well. John's hands roam over Sherlock's back, arse and shoulders, feeling his muscles work under the fabric of his shirt. He explores his mouth and takes in his scent when he presses his lips to Sherlock's jawline and neck.
She looks at the monitor. 'Looks rather problematic,' she comments, not at all caring. It really is 'problematic' though, Sherlock's not exactly doing well. 'The finale's coming then?'
'She wanted to tell people that he raped her. It would have destroyed his career.'
Sherlock looks up now, then he moves and does exactly what John's describing. Ever so slowly, he's pushing his groin against John's, watching him.
Sherlock deftly unbuckles the belt, opens the fly and pushes the trousers down. He drops to his knees, pulling the pants down, too. John's about to say something but Sherlock's already reaching for the bedstand that's close by the door so he just steps out of the trousers and pants and kicks them aside. Quickly, Sherlock rips open the condom package, then he looks up at John with a grin before rolling it on him. John's breath is going faster and arousal and lust are sending a shiver of anticipation down his spine.
They smile at each other, open and warm smiles. Eventually, John manages to turn away and walk toward the tube station. Despite seeing a corpse, it had been a nice evening. Just when John unlocks the door to his flat, his phone buzzes with a new message:
John stares at him and doesn't know if he should be in awe that Sherlock knows about Rosie or confused because his speech doesn't make any sense. 'That is my private life, Mr Holmes,' he manages in the end, voice tight.
'Just a few days.'
'Worth a shot.'
'John, I can practically hear your thoughts, goodness,' Sherlock mutters. 'The internet emphasises it's better to wait if you're unsure.'
'You know it is.'
Sherlock rolls his eyes. 'Fascinating. I've been dying to sit at the table instead of in the bed. Besides, I can't make my way to the toilet on my own yet.'
In the end, John is almost too late for the date.
'Shut up.'
'It's as if there was … emotional attachment,' Mycroft says slowly, looking intrigued.
are,' Sherlock says but he smiles back.
'Well, find yourself a new thing “I want to know but don't”, John
Sherlock narrows his eyes and doesn't speak for a few moments. 'You're weirdly concerned today,' he says and suddenly speaks very fast. 'You always care but you behave different today. You have a new haircut, but you're wearing those clothes from four years ago again. You had a long day, but you didn't spend it with Rosie because there are cat hairs on your shirt. They're from this morning, and then there are slight scratch marks on your wrist from a week ago. Who do we know that has a cat? It's not Molly, nor Mrs Hudson, and why don't I see any signs of Rosie on you? Where is she?' He pauses, eyes wide. 'John. You're not dating someone new with a cat, are you? Not after Mary. Not so soon.'
'There's a stab wound on his back but the killer or someone else stuffed their sock into it,' Lestrade says. 'Must have been right after the attack because there's barely any blood on the floor.'
Sherlock grins smugly now. 'I'm merely being attentive. And a genius, obviously. What's your world like? It must seem so simple and mysterious at the same time. When you can't–'
'It's not like I have a tight schedule, John.'
Sherlock nods. 'Three times. I'd had non-penetrative sex for about a year before that, though. How old were you the first time?'
John looks up briefly to take a new catheter. 'Evening,' he says, glancing to the monitor again. 'This is a turn-up, isn't it?'
'Doctor Watson.' Another nurse has brought new tubes and bags with liquid.
Sherlock groans in frustration and throws his head back. 'She's an idiot. You're an idiot. Sometimes you're worse than Anderson.'
'Matches?'
One of the nurses tries to pull him away, muttering something about this being someone else's shift and John seeming not really ready to do anything. He manages to grab Sherlock's wrist and take his pulse, but there really is no heartbeat. Anderson pushes him out of the room.
'Great, now let's take the conversation to the bedroom.'
'So hard to please,' John teases, threading his fingers through the dark curls. He feels like he wants to touch and kiss every part of Sherlock's body.
'I'm beginning to doubt he's going to my anything.'
out of the hospital, after all this time still embarrassed for staying in the coma patient's room for so long. The sounds of the walking cane betray him. Damn the leg. And damn that book and the procrastinating, John won't have more that five hours of sleep then. He'll be damn tired tomorrow and it's going to be a damn long day. Damn Tuesdays. Damn the flat for being so cold. It's June for god's sake. After feeding Rosie, John goes straight to bed.
At home, John sends Mycroft a text, explaining what happened. He leaves out the fact he took Sherlock out on a date in a restaurant.
John doesn't look at Sherlock and puts the blazer aside. It'd be the work for a nurse to change Sherlock's clothes. 'Am I calling you “Mr Holmes”?' he asks.
John looks up and his lips curl into a smile.
Cute, but wayward: the cat makes it's way over Sherlock's body in her adorable clumsy way then jumps to the bed stand.
A whole week passes until he asks the other doctor how Sherlock's doing.
It's half eight when Sally Donovan comes in for a routine check and to change the artificial nutrition. By that point, Sherlock's asleep again and John has changed into his white clothes, but he doesn't much like the idea of starting his shift in thirty minutes and leaving Sherlock alone.
'You're rather concerned, Dr Watson,' Mycroft Holmes interrupts the steady flow of facts that comes out of John's mouth.
Sherlock snorts. 'You don't like reading romance novels anyway,' he says. 'Aren't you a doctor? Have a medical view.'
'Well actually. There was that one time… I absolutely panicked. I was devastated.'
They are quiet for a moment, staring at a poster about first aid that hangs on the opposite wall.
In the week after, he sees Lestrade walking through the corridors and stops him. 'Do you know he's found out?' John asks without preamble.
'Shut it now,' he cut him off. 'You got Harry's gender wrong, Mr Genius.'
'Have you heard of Mycroft? The scary big brother, usually always there to protect his princess little sibling?'
'Ugh, don't say things like that.'
He speaks up a few more times and John tries more things. He has three fingers in by the end and Sherlock is clinging onto him. 'John,' he groans and kisses him hard, grinding his hips down. 'John, I want more.' He grabs John's wrist and pulls his fingers out.
