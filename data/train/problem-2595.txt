As expected Jesse's crew are well ahead of schedule by the time they arrive, and he voices enthusiastic support for Dean's decision to take some time to work on his own project.
“You watch your mouth, young man,” she says, crossing her arms. “There’s nothing standard about my place.” Her tone is harsh but she’s working hard to suppress a smile as Dean pulls Cas away.
“What are you talking about? I’m a boy scout, Cas.” He glances down the bar and adopts a more serious mien, tapping his knuckles on the highly polished wood.  “Keep sipping that. I’ll be back, and then you can tell me what ails you.”
She shrugs, returning to the linen cloth of blackberries and taking her time to choose one. “Everyone here has nightmares, it must be an entry requirement.”
“Okay, vendors check in on the left, contestants on the right,” she directs, and three people line up eagerly in front of Dean.
"Of course, of course you...wouldn't want that. My apologies." He turns and trots back up the corridor, and Dean is looking after him strangely when Sam pokes his head out of his own door.
Instead Cas grabs him firmly around the waist and turns them until he’s leaning against the couch himself. Looking Dean in the eye, he falls over the back of it, twisting to fall onto it lengthwise as he goes and pulls Dean down on top of him at the same time.
"Stop, all of you just stop." Sam pinches his nose as though he's trying to stave off a migraine, and Dean takes pity.
“You’re not even leaving for like two months, and it’s an hour away.” Sam peers at him from beneath the fringe of hair that hangs in his eyes and Dean looks away, sneaking a glance at the screen of his computer, but to his relief the screen saver has come on .
“Samuel,” Mary suggests, looking up at John, who nods and puts a hand on her shoulder. “Sam, for short.”
“No goddamn idea,” Dean admits. “But I have to try, and I have an idea about who else can help us.” Sam looks at him for a moment before pulling him into a hug, clapping him on the back. “It’s okay, Sammy. I’ll be okay.”
, it said, and so he holds it back like a precious thing, the  revelation of it a choice that isn’t his to make.
"Chance to get Winchester out of your system, don't you see? Here." He takes Cas by the wrist and drags him to the other side of the room, gesturing to an open doorway with a staircase leading up. "When you open the door at the top of the steps, Luke's room is the one directly in front of you."
“Guess the two of you had something in common. You could have just stayed at home binging Netflix and they never would have found you. Instead you came out of hiding to help me beat up drunks and rescue kittens.”
“Yeah, Sammy, just a sec!” He rubs his palms on his thighs, taking a few deep breaths before leaving the room.
"You think you can part with him for a little while, Millie?" Bobby says as he gets up from the table, followed by Rufus.
"Switchblade Syko, and I still cringe every time I see the spelling. If he had to battle English majors regularly I'd understand, but there's no reasonable explanation for making me endure that." She sighs, turning away from the monitors and putting her feet up on the chair, hugging her knees. "Like I said, though, it still doesn't make sense. From what we've been able to gather about how the Campbells work, Christian is next in line to lead. Trying to bring you into the fold would jeopardize his position."
He doesn't see Castiel the next night, or the one after that, and he worries in a way he never has before. He thinks about the kiss, and how right it felt for him to finally cross that line, stunned to find that Castiel felt like blood and breath and bone only to disappear from his grasp.
“I’m happy for you, you know,” Charlie says at the end of another day, as they sit on their rock in the pasture eating blackberries, their lips and fingers stained with juice. “You have someone there for you now, when nightmares chase your sleep away.”
“I’m afraid to trust how good it is,” he muses, spinning the chair side to side slightly as he stares at the ceiling. “I’ve never really felt like I belonged. I was too awkward to make friends as a kid so I was always alone, and by the time I got to high school I was effectively an outcast. The only friend I made was a transfer student who didn’t get the memo that I was to be universally shunned.” He laughs, remembering how he’d tried to discourage Bal from talking to him lest he be stigmatized by association, and Bal finding that notion utterly ridiculous.
"Look, Cas. I know this is the first time we've seen each other in ages, and we weren't even friends then, but..."
hot and he's never heard a sound like that come out of Cas before, it's more like... "You need to get away from me."
Sam simply nods, clapping him on the shoulder before leaving the room, and when the door shuts behind him Dean puts his face in his hands, listening to Cas's ragged breathing. He doesn't move until he thinks Cas is finally waking up, and it's only then he realizes that hours have passed.
The contestants are all sent to hang out in the locker rooms as their offerings are put on display, and the judges make their way to each station tasting a single one, while leaving the second pristine for the auction.
"What if I want to be crowded?" Cas looks away as though he wishes he hadn't said it, and Dean hesitates for a moment before he stands, catching the flicker of disappointment that crosses Cas's face.
"You know, like, when two characters who are destined to fall in love meet for the first time in a movie? But it's always in a cute way, like," and he gestures at the screen where Natalie is inadvertently cussing her way through meeting her love interest for the first time. "Or like, in Notting Hill where he runs into her on the street and spills his orange juice all over her? Or in When Harry Met Sally where they share a trip cross country together? Oh, or in Two Weeks Notice when she wants him to pledge not to tear down the community center and he offers her a job?" The glee on Jack's face morphs into a quizzical look. "That gentleman is in a lot of these movies, come to think of it. He must be a professional rom-commer."
“Why didn’t you tell me?” He doesn’t know, here in this moment, why he’s so angry. It will take several years, turning this event over in his mind, for Dean to understand that what he felt was betrayal: that he had shared so much, described every memory of his home in detail, confided all his childish fears night after night in the dark, and never known that he was confessing to a ghost. By the time he comes to this conclusion, it’s years too late to take it all back.
“That won’t change just because my address does.” He hooks an arm around Sam’s shoulders, pulling him close, pressing his face into his hair like he used to do when he was just a baby, small enough to cling to Dean when he was scared. He feels Sam nod, and he lets out a relieved breath. “I’ve got to go.”
Dean smiles, his eyes alight, and in them the true kingdom Castiel wishes he were beholden to. He gazes up at his human god and thinks,
“Look,” she says, and he already knows nothing good follows that word unless you’re somewhere scenic, like the Grand Canyon, or a safari. He’s pretty sure he’s not going to hear “Look, a giraffe!” in the middle of his bare bones apartment with no windows. “This is shitty timing, and I was going to talk to you this weekend, but at this point no time is a good time. I was offered an assignment out-of-state, and it’s a really great opportunity for me.”
"Oh." He does so, then bends over to untie his shoes without being prompted and slips them off as well. Once he gets situated with his back to the headboard he turns on the TV, and Dean closes his eyes, listening to the susurration of channels being changed one after another, until Cas finally settles on something that Dean recognizes by sound alone.
“Like the walls themselves might crumble,” Crowley answers, nodding. “Yes. It used to be a beautiful place, so much like those little pockets he would make for you, but it began to reflect his mood long before you and your brother ever came. Now it’s falling apart at an alarming rate, and there’s very little we can do to stave it off forever. That it still stands at all is the only reason we know he’s not dead.”
“No.” Dean can’t even muster the strength to be disappointed anymore. “I miss you, Dean, I do, but…”
"So that you can figure out how to seduce me? How do you know I even like dudes?" To be fair, Dean didn’t even know until becoming friends with Charlie, who freely points out that his sexuality seems to get very fluid when it comes to Han Solo; he’s just not ready to explore that aspect of himself for the first time with a mystical being that sees him as some kind of curious conquest.
Meg puts her hand to her chest as if scandalized. "I would never tell you to do anything that goes against your nature, boss. I'm simply suggesting you be yourself out loud and in the general direction of a specific person at the table with whom you share a mutual interest. If it happens to ingratiate you with that person while simultaneously needling another member of your party, well, then that's just a bonus."
were put on with magic) and the rest of his clothing, throwing it all into a corner of the room to deal with later before he maneuvers the inert form under the blankets, curling up beside him. He studies that sharp profile in the fading light of the afternoon, telling himself that this is real, that Castiel will be here when he wakes, will be here for good.
you. It's not that you're not handsome, or fun, or anything. It's just that you're not for me." She looks over her shoulder, lifting a hand when Donna waves in their direction. "Now
"Is she thinking what I think she's thinking?" Charlie asks, not even pausing at her task. "Because I like you Dean, but I don't
"I just want to go home," he says, and Storm makes a plaintive sound, nudging at his hands like one of the horses. Dean sighs in defeat, looking at the dragon carefully.
Balthazar smiles, closing the balcony door behind him with a snap of his fingers before sitting in the chair previously occupied by Sam. "That will do nicely, thank you." Dean watches him in stunned silence as Eileen leave the room. "She has manners. I like her."
“Yeah, yeah.” His phone buzzes against the desk and he picks it up immediately, smiling at the screen when he sees who the text is from. Benny lets out a low chuckle before Dean even types a response, and he puts the phone down like a child caught with a forbidden cookie. “What?”
Unfortunately, his nightmare continues at Ellen’s station. He narrates for the crowd about her fantasy chocolate pie as she pours an egg mixture over layers of chocolate, coconut, pecans and almonds, but as she covers the edge of the crust with strips of foil Bobby speaks to her lowly.
, and Cas glances around. He doesn’t see who he’s looking for, but does catch a glimpse of his least favorite person, who catches his eye and beckons him over to an empty spot beside him. “I can’t believe he’s still pulling this shit,” Meg hisses. “Take a hint, buddy.”
Problem the first: he's brought a naked stranger into his house even though he knows nothing about him. Point: he could be a deranged killer. Counterpoint: nudity puts paid to the idea that the man possesses a weapon. Still, maybe Dean should hide the knives before he goes to bed.
They fall silent, each lost in their own thoughts, sipping their coffee until Dean's mug is completely empty. He slides it to the side and leans into his elbows on the table.
The phone goes off again as he's putting on his coat and scarf, and he needs a minute to breathe and collect himself when he reads the reply.
"Hey, Cas," he says, watching him empty microwave popcorn into a large ceramic bowl, sprinkling it liberally with garlic salt. "Have you given any thought to a new name for yourself yet?"
“How do you know so much about everyone’s business? I’ve lived here most of my life and I don’t know as much about everyone as you do.”
"I'm simply offering to give you a lift to a place we're both going, and then take you to the home we still share afterwards. You can simply take it for the kind gesture it is, or not."
Balthazar sighs. "It will take a single night for you to grow bored of this boy, Castiel, I promise. Bring him here now, sate your curiosity, and get him out of your system. You'll be happier for it, I promise you."
"Here we have some other first timers," he says instead, as they near two stations where a couple of teenagers have set up side by side. "These are seniors from the school's home ec class. Every year the students in those classes vote for the two of them to compete."
John looks at him for a few minutes, then leans against the counter heavily. "Listen, Dean, there's been something I've been meaning to talk to you about." Dean waits, curious and confused. "You're graduating next month, and, well, you're eighteen now." He shifts uncomfortably, turning his back to get a beer out of the fridge before he continues. "You're old enough to shift for yourself now, and I know you've got the skills to do so."
"I'm glad you have the opportunity to mend fences with them. Perhaps they have come to see that they need your faith after all. It is never too late to bring a lamb back into the flock."
The diminutive man comes closer, blinking a few times as though he’s trying to dispel the illusion before him. “Bloody hell, if it isn’t Dean Winchester, as I live and breathe. You’ve certainly changed.” He peers over Dean’s shoulders. “Where’s that gangly baby deer that trailed after you before?”
"Every Thursday?" he asks incredulously. "What do you mean every Thursday? How long have you all been doing this?" Two people nearby shush him, and he gives them a quelling look.
Those hands tense ever so slightly, the tightening of the skin around the knuckles nearly imperceptible; but Dean has spent years studying Cas in the way that stargazers study constellations, mapping out the tiniest of movements to discern their effect on the whole. He lets his own hand crawl slowly across the gap between them -- two feet, twenty inches, fifteen inches, nine -- until he's close enough to reach out with his index finger and brush the length of Cas's pinky.
"I guess we're about to find out," Sam says, and he and Eileen stand as well, and the air in the room grows heavy as Sam backs away from the balcony doors, taking Eileen's hand.
“He’s a grown man, Dean, I’m sure if he really didn’t want to come he would have found a reason not to. But I think he’d just tell you no, not decide to start ghosting you.”
“It is...expected. I don’t particularly care to do what anyone expects me to, but Balthazar persists because despite his love for gossip, he doesn’t enjoy it when it’s about me. He’d much prefer having a companion to gossip with.”
It’s Dean that pulls away first, leaning their foreheads together as he catches his breath, hands never leaving Cas’s face.
"Why are you still in the back seat?" Cas says nothing, and Dean sighs. "You can't see from back there, man, come on. If we're gonna do this stakeout you need to get up here where you can see."
"If you're the target then you're just giving them even more opportunity to take a shot at you, Dean!"
Balthazar leans against the doorframe with his arms crossed, regarding his brother without saying anything else. Castiel sneers at him across the throne room, empty of anything except the detritus of dozens of goblins that are off doing mischief elsewhere, then twists to sit properly in the throne and put his head in his hands.
"Clarence," she drawls. "That much is obvious. So. What were you doing until the wee hours of the morning? And don't say Dick, because while the double entendre would be amusing we both know he hasn't got the staying power."
"Would you like me discuss them in alphabetical order or by preference?" Dean goes completely silent, mouth agape, and Castiel smirks at how easily the tables have turned. "Or perhaps chronologically?"
Dean studies the goblin king, waiting patiently without moving a muscle, but Dean could swear he has a swagger even as he's standing still. The figure he cuts is imposing, astonishing, and Dean feels a little bit breathless with something he can't quite name.
"Yeah," Jack says sadly. "He said that he'd determined that the meet-cute was a fallacy and he didn't want to do anymore research."
"You stop," she replies saucily, and he sinks back against the sofa and crosses his arms defiantly. Balthazar grins wickedly as he swirls the amber liquid in his glass, looking at the three of them.
She dips a cloth into a basin several times, then wrings it out and starts rubbing his face with it as he grimaces. She doesn’t say anything else as Dean begrudgingly lets her scrub him clean, then helps him dress in fresh clothing. It’s plain and it itches, besides being too big for his small frame, but he doesn’t want to complain because now he’s hungry. Mildred looks him over, nodding in satisfaction before taking him by the hand again and leading him back outside and across the grounds of wherever they are.
“Did you do something to her?” Dean asks sharply, getting out of the bed in nothing but a pair of shorts, and Castiel can’t even pretend to look away. He notes the effect time has had on Dean’s physical features: the broadening of his shoulders and thighs, the soft roundness of his face more chiselled, chin darkened by coarse hair as though he’s letting it go on purpose. Castiel has only seen him this unclothed in brief glimpses in the curve of enchanted glass, and those do not compare to seeing the trail of light hair that disappears into the jeans he pulls over his hips, before covering himself with a long-sleeved shirt.
"Who are you?" finally takes the lead, forcing its way past his lips only to lose steam and come out in a harsh whisper that does nothing to rouse him. Reaching out carefully, Dean lays the back of his hand on the man's forehead. His body temperature seems normal, though he'd been much warmer than a normal person when Dean had finally lifted him off the sand. He pulls his hand away, but not before brushing an errant lock off the man's forehead.
Monday. Dean had been doing laundry late on Sunday night. He starts to smile to himself, but then thinks about the look on Cas's face when he took off, right after Dean told him 'It's weird to think of you touching my skivvies." It must have told Cas pretty definitively that Dean was unreceptive to the idea of Cas ever getting his hands in Dean's pants. He ruffles Jack's hair as he stands up.
He doesn’t look at them as he tells the story, Sam signing it all for Eileen as he speaks, but Dean notices Sam’s hesitation when he explains things he’s never heard before: the way he was drawn to Castiel, the fever dream of the masquerade when he ate the peach, and especially what happened when the clock struck thirteen after they were separated.
Dean laughs at the face Gordon makes, and as he turns away he spots someone unexpected across the room. It’s that kid with the bright blue eyes and unruly hair that’s in half his classes, but never speaks unless he’s answering a question from a teacher.
"Cas?" He questions, tilting his head. Dean crosses the room slowly until they're standing toe to toe, curling a hand around the back of Cas' neck and giving him a lopsided smile. Trading touch for touch.
you been up to since school ended?” His voice comes out rougher than anticipated, and he hopes Cas doesn’t notice.
"Oops. Dropped your towel." Cas gives him an odd look before moving to pick it up, and Dean takes that moment to crouch down and lean into his shoulder, effectively knocking him on his butt so Dean can pick up the towel instead.
He jacks himself faster and Dean obliges with his own pace, and right before Castiel topples over the edge Dean shoves both fingers deep inside him. Castiel is about to beg him to keep going, he can't stop, he can't stop now Castiel is so
"I should have left as soon as you realized that Sam had set us up, that he meant for it to be a date. Honestly, I should have never spent all those months flirting with you before that, but I kept telling myself it was innocent, that as long as it never went anywhere that nobody would get hurt. It never occurred to me that I was so transparent, that Sam could see so clearly what I wanted, or that he would try to make it happen for me. And once we were there I didn't want to leave, and I started thinking that maybe it was possible, maybe there was a way for me to have that, have you." He takes a shuddering breath. "And then the building across the street blew up, and I knew it was a sign that I was kidding myself, thinking I could have some kind of regular life. So I left you there and went to help, and I've hated myself for it every day since."
Dean swears he would never have forgotten a name like Castiel, that if he'd ever seen those eyes before they would have been burned into his memory. However, a lot of things from that period of his life are a jumbled mess, ever since the first day he'd gotten off the bus and she hadn't been waiting for him at the front door. Dean sighs and decides not to push further right now. There are a myriad of things he needs to know. If there's anything Dean's learned from raising a recalcitrant Sam, it's that information is more easily gleaned with an indirect approach.
. Fist clenching ever so imperceptibly on the pipe in his grip, desperate to be pushed into action, and Dean is only too happy to oblige.
"No." He bats it away, and Castiel drops his torch to the floor where it sputters but continues to burn, casting a sickening shadow on the walls. "You can't be serious."
Dick had always adopted the same mien when Cas spoke to him, and in the beginning it felt like a rainy midmorning in his father’s study all over again, when he was desperately seeking guidance. It took some time for him to accept that Dick wasn’t multitasking while letting Cas talk through a problem, thinking of a solution. He simply wasn’t listening at all. He wasn’t
The shop teacher is a crusty old sod in a wheelchair named Mr. Singer, gruff in mannerism and speech, impatient with most of the kids who think his class is an excuse to goof off. Dean is not one of those, so Mr. Singer treats him with an indulgence that he pretends is reluctant, but his eyes glisten with pride whenever his most eager student demonstrates how quickly he's learned a new skill.
"That's just it!" Castiel throws his head back, frustration overriding his caution. "I know that he wants me, Balthazar. His desire is palpable, all the signs are there. I can hear the quickening of his heart at my proximity, smell the warmth of his blood as it heats up beneath his skin with want. Yet he won't succumb to me, has outright told me he never shall."
"Oh, I don't know about that, brother. Given the little scene I witnessed in the alley it seems he might have
“Don’t listen to Missouri, she gets upset if I stay away from her for too long.” Missouri tries to give him another stern look, but cracks a smile when he pouts at her, slapping him fondly on the shoulder and shaking her head as she walks away.
He throws back the blankets and hisses when his feet touch the floor, the carpet uncomfortably cold under his feet. The coals in the wood stove are barely alive as he enters the room, and though he's tempted to get a roaring fire going he knows it will be a waste when they'll be working on another floor all day, and sweating despite the cold.
"I’m not certain, but there are definitely sleeping quarters in here. I can hear three people breathing shallowly in a room to the east. One of them has a deviated septum."
First he makes a reassuring phone call to Sam, who immediately drives the Impala back to Dean’s house with Eileen in tow. Dean showers away the cobwebs and dust, moving around the second floor as quietly as he can, but Castiel never moves. Dean stands in the doorway for a while, watching him breathe, then goes downstairs to make some coffee.
Hundreds of naked fantasies about Cas over the years did not prepare Dean Winchester to be clinically stripped naked and laid face down on a motel bed by the angel so he could carefully remove a cactus spine from his ass. Or three.
"I called a cab to take your friend home," he says casually, not looking at Dick directly. He's been thinking about what he'd say when he appeared, but that was not an opening salvo he'd considered until he heard it leaving his mouth. Dick doesn't even have the grace to look ashamed. "I'll be happy to call a cab for you as well while you pack a bag."
Bobby glares at him as he dutifully does the last of his stretches, sighing in relief when the cool glass of the bottle hits the palm of his tired hand.
He drags them out onto the floor of the gymnasium to do their rounds, hoping they’ll forget this conversation by the time they reach the man himself.
"Please, please, I am begging you. I am in enough pain without having to watch the two of you eye fuck each other in front of us. I am begging for mercy,
"I mean it. Fantasizing about a thing isn't the same as actually getting it. The minute you aren't enjoying it, you say so. Okay?"
"Whose house are we even in?" Cas asks, voice raised to be heard over the dance music that seems to be coming from the very walls.
“I don’t want you to feel pressured to make a decision right now,” she says, looking him in the eye as she sits sideways and cross-legged on the far cushion, elbows on her knees, as though they’re talking about what movie they want to see instead of the end of everything they’ve been. “Honestly, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking these last few weeks.”
“Yes, very tasty,” Crowley concurs with a purr, leaning closer to her. “He certainly does have a type, doesn’t he?”
Dean wakes with a start, sitting up in bed to stare at his visitor as though he’s never seen him before.
“You don’t seem like yourself,” Castiel observes when Dean doesn’t immediately drop his hand, still staring out at the vast ocean all around them, phosphorescent sea life aglow like lanterns in the dark. “What is the matter?”
“Of course.” He turns away to wipe down the bar, because suddenly he can’t look at her. “I was your stereotypical jock back then, complete with varsity letters in three different sports. All my free time was spent going to parties and drinking, and my hobby was making my way through every available cheerleader like they were worth points.”
"What do you think you’re going to do without me, hmm?" The sneer that twists his face is not unfamiliar to Cas, though he doubts anyone else has ever seen the carefully crafted veneer of that public persona crack. “You think you’ll be able to find another successful man willing to put up with all your gauche quirks, your ill-informed opinions?” He takes a step, and Cas instinctively backs away even though the kitchen island is between them. “No one else will tolerate your behavior as gracefully as I have all these years.”
The light’s infinite invasion of his privacy gives him something to focus on until the last moments of each day when it retreats, leaving him in darkness once again.
"Lost?" Balthazar laughs, shaking his head. "You never had it in the first place. You didn't choose to be what you are, so your heart's never been in it." He pushes himself off the doorframe, ambling into the room. "You were touched by how much those boys wanted to get their brother back, weren't you?" Castiel looks away, but Balthazar nods sagely. "Tell me: how many others have defied you to have their loved ones returned to them?"
Unfortunately for Dean, by the time they finish their last interview it's far too late in the day to go to the museum, and he tries not to pout on the drive back to town.
"When are you going to learn that Cas doesn't wait to be asked when it comes to saving people he loves? Especially where you're concerned!"
“It doesn’t matter when,” Cas says, turning away to focus on the tip of his own finger as it traces a scratch in the wooden tabletop. “Only that...you were right.”
"You think all the bad guys are starting to avoid doing crime within a hundred mile radius because they fear me?" He stops pacing behind Charlie, arms crossed and face pensive before he nods to himself with a grin. "Actually, yeah, that makes sense. Pissing their pants at the idea that Daredemon is coming for them."
Cas looks out over the scrubland, peering into the distance towards the Pecos River and the wildlife refuge it runs through. Dean watches him surreptitiously, appreciating how well the cowboy hat and the trenchcoat actually go together. It's fairly cool for a spring day, but Dean is still feeling the weight of the sun between his shoulder blades, persistent and strong. He finds himself wondering how many layers Cas actually has on, if maybe he can tempt him to peel one or two of them off...
thing on his mind now. He knows there are Things They Need to Talk About. But that doesn't change the fact that finding the words, or the right time and place, remains as impossible as it's ever been. Dean was waiting for Cas to get over the touch of pneumonia, now he's waiting for Cas to be his old self again, and all the time he's waiting he's waking up every few hours to creep to his door and listen for movement on the other side to reassure himself that Cas is still there.
"True? Isn't it? It's been ten years, Dean. Nothing says your feelings are unrequited than not even having them acknowledged after a decade."
Bobby nods in agreement as he leads the way, and both men hover close to Dean as they introduce him to the first of the three horses in the stable, as though they expect him to be frightened; but Dean is used to large beasts bred to carry knights in armor as they joust with one another, playing at war. He goes right up to the first stall without fear, and the enormous black horse bends its neck to greet him.
Dean turns away, stunned speechless. He quickly runs back through their conversation  as he starts to walk away, trying to figure out what he did to cause this shift in demeanor. It doesn’t take long, and thankfully he hasn’t even passed Mildred when it clicks. He turns back, even though he can see Mildred watching him intently in his peripheral vision.
"Not on purpose, perhaps, but he would be hurt all the same." Balthazar peruses the vast selection of gloves, choosing a pair in ivory. "As you pointed out yourself, our lives here are repetitive, boring. It's not like the old days anymore, when we could entertain ourselves easily among humankind, when they believed in us, knew the rules of interaction. Anything outside the norm is enticing, as I assume Dean's life is for you. Which is why I hoped a single night would be enough for you to...work it out of your system."
"A friend? Dean, every friend you've ever had that can do anything with their hands now works for you."
“Sure, sure. I just meant, uh, if you’re already warm enough to remove your coat you’re probably going to get too hot while you bake.”
“Duh. It’s like it just occurred to you at graduation that school is really over and you’re going away to college soon.”
It happens on a nondescript Tuesday afternoon. Mary Winchester had waited for the bus with Dean that morning, carrying Sam in one arm and a brown-bagged lunch in the other. The air is cold as winter still lingers, and Dean keeps wiping his runny nose on the sleeve of his dark blue coat when his mother isn’t looking.
"Oh?" He curses himself for the definite interest that one little word reveals, but can't help but do internal cartwheels of glee. Then he reminds himself that he is
Balthazar strides to the wardrobe, throwing it open dramatically. "Let's see, shall we?" He begins tossing articles of clothing on the bed, and Castiel finally drags himself off the balcony.
The brothers stay at the graveside for a long time after they've lowered the smallest casket of the three into the ground, a summer rainstorm soaking their clothes despite the large black umbrellas above their heads. Bobby waits at the house for the crowd of the bereaved, the muddy terrain more difficult for him to traverse than a bunch of grieving strangers he’s never met. Sam turns away before Dean, following the muddy path cut by the feet of a dozen other mourners undeterred by the rain; all of them friends of Kate's -- with the exception of Rufus, who'd stood apart but was there for them nonetheless.
“You never told me yours, either,” Cas says in a conspiratorial whisper, and Samandriel smiles in return. He has a sweet face, and it reminds Cas of another smile like that from long ago. He blinks the thought away.
The air has turned from chilly to downright frosty by the next time he decides to trek up to the top, but he's been cooped inside all day with a hammer and nails, and desperately wants to get the cloying scent of sawdust out of his nostrils. The moment he steps onto the gallery, a sense of calm and relief washes over him, and he takes several bracing breaths before turning his face up to the sky.
Cas studies his profile, wondering what it could be, and if Dean will stick around long enough for him to find out. He decides to throw the die.
“Okay, okay,” Dean says, turning a corner to see a familiar sight  through an opening in the next corridor: four soldiers, guarding two doors from behind their red and blue shields. “Great. Talking to these guys went so well the last time.” He cringes at the thought, the thing that still haunts his nightmares.
Castiel gives him a pensive look, then turns away. "I could make him forget, if you wish," he says hesitantly. "I could make you both forget. You would only remember during the time you spent here with..."
“I didn’t want you to be afraid," Castiel whispers. “When you went away the first time, I thought it was what I deserved. That it was inevitable. I thought you had figured it out.”
None of the mourners stay at the wake very long, as awkward around Dean and Sam as they are around so many strangers. Bobby and Rufus stay long enough to help them put away the food and tidy up the house; Dean sees them both out the door as Sam finishes drying the dishes, clapping Rufus brusquely on the back and shaking Bobby’s outstretched hand.
“Did you guys see?” His excitement is palpable, and Bess can’t stop grinning. “It’s been such a long time!”
It's still dark out when Dean wakes, body well programmed after decades of early rising. Even going to bed late can't throw off his internal alarm. The first thought in his mind, even before throwing back the blankets and fumbling for the light, is whether or not his visitor is still on the premises. He dresses quickly, pulling his boots on without bothering to lace them, and exits the bedroom cautiously. The living area is empty, undisturbed, and he creeps quietly to the opposite side of the room to press his ear against the door. He hears nothing, and though he wants to peek in he won't be able to see anything without turning on a light, so instead he backs away. Coffee first. Just in case there's a dead body in there. He's definitely gonna need coffee in him to deal with that.
"That was an exclamation of excitement, not dread, you dork," he finally says when he comes up for air.
Cas growls low in his throat, and Dean pulls away. "Fuck, don't do that unless you want me to get you naked right here."
"Don't stop, Dean," he says breathlessly as he strokes himself, but Dean shakes his head gently, moving just that fingertip in and out ever so slightly.
“Didn’t know you were so invested in the guy,” Al says, giving him a strange look, and Dean tries not to let the panic show on his face.
I thought rich people loved the Swiss.” He bursts out laughing at that, and she grins. “You should keep some at the office now. You can drink it whenever you're forced into the same room together, I bet just the smell of it will make his nostrils curl."
"What's wrong?" Dean puts a hand on his shoulder, shaking him slightly. "Sam, what is it?" Rain begins to pelt the glass, and thunder rumbles in the distance. "I didn't know it was supposed to storm tonight, I hope it doesn't wake the baby again." He peers down at his little brother. "Are you okay? You're as white as a sheet."
"That's because you take the circuitous route to my office whenever you deign to visit now, and that one time you saw him coming up the hall you hid in the stairwell!"
He shakes his head, facing forward again. “I know about Bobby’s, because I lived in his cottage for so long. There’s a man who scares him, though he mostly dreams about his fists.” He glances sidelong at her. “Don’t tell him I told you that.”
Balthazar looks at him sideways. “Did he never tell you why he was chosen as king of the goblin realm?”
“Because I’m your friend, and I know how your mind works. I also know that you feel pretty vulnerable right now: you just got out of a relationship, Sam is leaving for school soon, and things have been pretty tense between him and your dad for a while.” The thing he loves most about Charlie is the reasonable way she looks at a situation, explaining it so rationally that he can’t even form an argument. “Mr. Mystery didn’t move on because there’s something wrong with you, or because you’re not good enough. Things just didn’t work out. It doesn’t make you a bad person. Sometimes the unfortunate consequence of playing hard to get is that someone else intercepts to catch them before you get tired of running.” Okay, it might be the thing he also hates the most about her.
Breathing hard, he braces his hands on the rail as he looks down over the beach below, finding the spot easily with its one sand sculpture still intact for now. From this vantage point he can see the shape of the depression much better.
He’s reread the story in Sam’s tattered old book so many times over the years to know it by heart, and learned enough of what’s true to know which parts are for real.
“How long do you think you can keep this up?” he asks, alarmed when the mirth leaves Castiel’s face in a hurry. “What did I say?”
you let one of them hit you with a chair. You shouldn't get lazy and let your guard down, even with the simple shit, ya idjit."
Dean takes a shuddering breath, turning to meet Castiel's eyes just as the sky above turns pink. "Is that all you think about?"
Castiel grimaces. “His father had beaten his mother to death, and Amara was nearly too late to save him from the same fate.”
He swings his legs off the bed, glancing at the clock on the nightstand as he plants his feet on the chilly floor. Not even six a.m., far too early to be awake on any day, much less a Saturday. He sighs, rubbing his face with both hands, rasping over stubble with his palms before he finally stands and shuffles out of the room. The coffee is programmed to start brewing at half past seven, but given the hour he hits the button to get it started before making his way to the bathroom.
“Of course,” Crowley says, and when Castiel raises an eyebrow he continues as contemptuously as possible. “Your Highness.”
"What they did was make me wary of every surface in our apartment, given that you probably fucked your connections all over the place.”
It’s like a tickle on the back of his neck, the distinct feeling you get when you're being watched. Normal people in a situation like that will turn and find someone staring at them hard from the other side of a room, but such things are usually far simpler for Dean, who can focus his enhanced senses enough to hear the flutter of a butterfly's wing a thousand yards away.
Cas blinks at him in stunned silence for several minutes. "How do you retain so much completely useless information?" he finally manages to ask.
“I can’t believe Zachariah would approve of this,” Cas says darkly. “He detests the human race, he would never stoop to giving them weapons, no matter the price.”
Dean is eighteen years old and Castiel seems unchanged by the decade passed, though Dean would have sworn he was barely twenty when they met. Each time he’d asked, as a child, Castiel had just rolled his eyes and said "older than you". Seeing him now, like this, only reinforces his sense that Castiel is something unearthly, unreal, and that Dean should probably be afraid.
“I know it’s been years but, to be honest, I can’t believe you’re even talking to me. That you would even give me the time of day after the way I acted back then is just…”
“I was still a child then, even as a dragon, and became an age appropriate human.” He gestures down at himself. “Dragons age roughly a hundred years for each human one. I don’t know exactly how I look now, but I can certainly see how my body has changed, and that the floor is farther away than it used to be.”
It's the closest John's ever come to any kind of acknowledgement of everything that came between their mother's death and his marriage to Kate, but Dean has a feeling that's all he's going to get, so he doesn't press.
The nervous anticipation that has driven him all week slowly bleeds away as he sinks deeper into Dean's couch, drawn into the plot of the movie, the aroma of cheese and tomatoes slowly permeating the room until his stomach starts to rumble.
The story rolls off his tongue with practiced ease, even though the only person he's ever told is Charlie. All their lives they had traveled the same circuitous route eight or nine months of the year, following the carnival company their dad worked for. They’d come to town for whatever festival was in season, building a fairway from the ground up in an empty parking lot or an abandoned field, then break it down a week later and move on to the next town on the list. It was the only life Sam had ever known, but Dean vaguely remembered a different time: a time when he had cookies and played with toys rather than watching other kids win them, when he got tucked into bed at night and kissed on the forehead.
Where he'd been draped in all black at their first meeting, the king is now bedecked in white like a bride come to church.
"A terrible one. It got our baby brother Adam kidnapped, and it's only because of Dean that we managed to get him back."
“What?” He stops what he’s doing, black plastic clutched in his left hand and a crumpled pair of jeans in his right. “You want to move in together?”
“What ghost?” Mary asks as he climbs into bed still in his shirt and hose, and John tucks him in to the distant sounds of revelry from the bailey below as his mother places the sleeping baby gently into his cradle by the window.
He conjures a crystal with a flick of his wrist, peering into its depths, his gaze made manifest on earth in the form of an owl, and watches Dean Winchester sleep.
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugs. These are things he's long since ceased to be angry about, especially since there's no outlet for it anymore.
He tries, but it's more like shuffling, pulling one leg after another as the Winchester brothers practically carry him through the bunker. It feels like ages before they reach their final destination, and Cas is so grateful to sink onto the soft surface of his bed that he promptly passes out again.
The weight doesn't really lift off of him until he's on his knees, a set of wings burned into the ground before him, and he feels gutted and hollow.
"Charlie, come on. We barely knew each other and he probably thought I was a dick. I'm sure I'm the last person he'd seek comfort with."
"It's true that I have very...carnal intentions towards you," he begins, rewarded with just a hint of a smile at his turn of phrase. "But the thing I want, the thing the church can't give me, is the time we spend together. I love Fridays when you ravish me before I'm barely in the door." Dean's hands clutch at his shirt before sliding lower, palming his ass through the utilitarian boxer shorts he still wears. "I love Saturdays when we watch silly things on TV, and you make me dinner before you take me to bed."
"Two weeks! Got it, thanks Sam!" Charlie hits a button and Sam disappears from the screen. She glares at Dean. "What were you gonna do, piss him off even more and get him to refuse again? Take what's offered, renegotiate later. You've been dealing with your brother three times longer than I have, how have you not learned how to handle him yet?"
"Fuck, Sam," he says, placing his palms on the counter and hanging his head. "I don't know what I'm going to do with him. I really don't. He nearly got his stupid ass
Sometimes he catches himself absently rubbing his left bicep with his right hand, like it’s a wound he can’t stop poking at. It doesn’t actually hurt anymore, but it doesn’t seem to be fading, and he can’t bring himself to mention it. He can’t imagine Castiel would have an explanation, and Dean doesn’t want him to blame himself for what was probably some kind of a freak accident.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean is sitting curled up in a ball on the bed, arms around his knees, head tilted back against the headboard. “Been waiting for you.”
. It means that something doesn’t exist anymore, that it’s gone forever and there will never be anything else like it again.”
“Moving on now!” Dean says loudly, glaring at all three of them and practically shoving Crowley down to the next station.
Castiel laughs before turning on his side and curling into Dean, nuzzling at his throat, and he can feel Dean smile into his hair as he puts an arm around him.
“And you didn’t put it together yourself, after all the pretty illusions he created for years, trying to seduce you?”
"Is that so?" He grunts as the seat belt finally clicks into place, leaning back against the driver's side for a moment to catch his breath. Thank god for superstrength, or he'd never have been able to get Sam's drunk ass to the car at all. He’s like an octopus trying to walk upright on land. "Why would you want that?"
"Alright," Cas says, and Dean sinks into the mattress with a sigh, feeling Cas shift behind him as he resumes his position. He closes his eyes, letting the sound of the program wash over him like white noise, feeling the warmth behind him of another body in the bed. He tries to imagine what it would be like for Cas to put down the remote, sliding his body further down the mattress and curling behind Dean like he's the companion piece of a joined set, linking their hands together against Dean's stomach as he breathes softly on the back of his neck.
"I just, look, I need to pretend I’m a civilian for a bit. Got to get a look at something and can’t risk giving myself away. I’ll be back."
"I didn't get it, I made it. Your job is to drink it and stop asking dumb questions." Cas isn't fooled by his gruff demeanor, and he feels bad for making Dean worry.
He puts his forehead on the steering wheel and takes a few deep breaths. Not for the first time he wishes for a way to reach out to Castiel, to talk to him, to not have to face this long night and all those in the coming year without him.
He raises his head, turning towards the castle, a darker silhouette against the night sky, blotting out the stars.
"No, no, that's the problem, see. You used to get a delivery every Thursday, like clockwork, and then I noticed that you weren't anymore. So I thought maybe you were away, which, okay I was maybe a little judgey about, because who goes on vacation in a pandemic, but then a couple of weeks went by and there was nothing and so..."
"Cheap Trick." He spits the words out and takes a step back as he says it, but Dean follows without thinking, taking two steps for Cas's one.
"What about this?" Dean says, pulling a hammered silver ring off his right hand. It’s not expensive, and certainly not elaborate, but it’s the shiniest thing on his person.
“Sam?” he manages to croak out. He’s supposed to graduate in a month, and Dean is suddenly paralyzed with fear that he’ll never see him again. His shoulders sag in relief when Bobby shakes his head.
"I'm not as valuable to the greater good as you are. You and Sam. With all the mistakes I've made, all the wrongs I've done?" He shakes his head, gaze firmly on the ceiling.
, he thinks, but cannot say. "I just thought, after I made you wait so long for this, that you'd be desperate to get started."
“It’s just the first that I found,” Sam explains. “I’m pretty sure if we went looking we’d find some more.”
, Castiel realizes, and it's so endearing that he can't help but lean in to place a tender kiss on his lips. "Why don't you tell me your plans while I change?" Dean smiles, his shoulders dropping as the tension releases from them, and it warms Castiel even as he shrugs out of his black button-down and plain white undershirt.
"No," he says, pulling the mask off his face, glad to be free of his own hot, humid breath. "I mean, I've looked into things, but." He shrugs. He's sure Bobby knows more about Dean's history than he lets on, same as all the other teachers who've looked at his file. "No big plans in my future other than finding a job."
“Oh,” Dean says sadly, and Castiel squeezes his eyes shut. He knows that physical attraction is not the same as romantic feeling, and he should not have allowed himself to hope. His heart feels like an organ exposed, tender to the touch and trembling in the open air.
There’s an en suite in their bedroom, meticulously appointed, and there’s no reason Dick would be using the other one unless their shower was broken. He dithers in the hall for a bit, considering while he stares at the little strip of light bleeding out from underneath the doorway, biting his lower lip. He travels once a month at least, and he wonders if Dick has been taking advantage of those absences, and for how long.
He nods, hoping he doesn't look as nervous as he feels, then starts rearranging glasses as he takes steadying breaths. He sees Cas approaching in his peripheral vision, and by the time he reaches the barfront Dean feels somewhat calmer, raising his head with what he hopes is a charming smile.
"Have you slept all?" It's not unexpected, that this is the first question Sam asks, but it still makes Dean clench his teeth.
Balthazar sighs, putting down his empty glass. “He wandered into the labyrinth, but other than that I don’t exactly know. I suspect he doesn’t want me to.”
He doesn't adhere much to his manners as he eats, talking with his mouth full as he recites all the things he accomplished during the day, the things he plans to work on tomorrow.
Cas sits stiffly, back against the headboard, legs rigid, hands clasped together in his lap. He doesn't move so much as his head, and his tone is as wooden as his posture. "I don't know what I would enjoy." Neither does Dean, and for the first time it occurs to him to be ashamed of this. Cas is his best friend, has been by his side for a decade, and he's changed drastically from the stoic angel that doesn't understand humanity -- but has he ever had the chance to discover things for himself? Things that aren't pushed on him by Dean, encouraging Cas to do what
Dean looks at his earnest face, open and honest and worried, and leans in carefully to kiss him. "I think you're going to learn that we both want the same thing."
“Please,” she says plaintively. He looks away, focusing on the field of grey tombstones through the rivulets running down the glass, wondering where the strange figure he’d spotted before went. “Could we try again?”
“Oh, I don’t know. There are a lot of useful things we both learned along the way that we wouldn’t have known otherwise.”
"I hear what you're saying, and I know you need more to connect the dots, but I know what I felt in my gut."
"Cas, if you can be here than so can I, it's no more dangerous for you than for me." He moves closer, slowly reaching out with one hand to touch Castiel’s face, his eyes silently asking for permission. Castiel closes his eyes as he relents, and Dean’s fingers graze his cheek, solid and warm.
“...letting him take you on all kinds of adventures that you’ve somehow managed to avoid despite being almost forty…”
“Where are we?” Castiel asks, his voice rough and husky with a full day’s sleep. “I don’t know this place.”
I could not stop thinking about them the entire time they ran the labyrinth. I meant only to satisfy my curiosity, but the opportunity to spend more time with him presented itself and I took it, and now…” He stills, eyes staring unfocused into the distance. “Now it seems as though all the time in the world will not be enough.”
He's been at it for about thirty minutes when Mr. Singer clears his throat, a paper cup of coffee in one hand and a magazine in the other, and something occurs to Dean.
Dean had come close to giving in to one particular temptation, at a masquerade ball he'd found his way to in some kind of a fever dream. He'd taken a bite of a peach Crowley had offered, wanting to make sure it was okay before he handed it to Sam; but his mind started swimming and the next thing he knew he was in a ballroom full of costumed revelers at a party celebrating he knew not what.
"My brother's a prince, too, but I’m the oldest," Dean says, approaching Samandriel with her treat, smiling as she gently takes the apple from his hand. He turns too late to catch the rude hand gesture Bobby makes at Rufus, taking the last apple over to Impala.
"I have this," Sam says, holding out a twenty dollar bill. "I got it for my birthday. You can have it if you help us?"
"What's this?" she asks, her demeanor serious as she senses the change in the air. Her eyes move back to his with a question, and Dean clears his throat.
"Nothing happened, why does something have to happen?" Charlie just crosses her arms and cocks a hip, staring at him until he sighs in defeat. "Nothing happened, okay?"
Dean realizes he’s not alone as he leaves the larder, and the weak light offers just enough illumination for him to see a familiar face. Everything drops in his surprise, the apple rolling into the feet of the man pressed against the wall just before the flame goes out.
He opens his mouth, prepared to spill everything, when a door behind them opens. He's been so focused on talking to Cas that he stopped paying attention to the sound of others in the building, and as a result he didn't notice anyone coming. Dean curses himself for once again letting his guard down, knowing that Bobby is going to give him a repeat performance of being hit with a metal chair until he finally learns this lesson.
Dean finds the short corridor that mirrors the other, expecting the heavy door to creak open under his hand, but it moves inward silently, leading to a short set of stairs winding upwards. His head finally breaches the opening to the room above and there, silhouetted against the night sky, is a lonely figure.
He doesn’t particularly want to stay, but he’d never say no to Donna. He’s too restless to sit and wait, so he begins to wash dishes, blushing a bit when Missouri gives him an affectionate pat on the cheek.
"Of course. Something is definitely fishy. Owner is a subsidiary of a shell company owned by an investment group that's tied to a whole web of anonymous investors. You’ve only been out of contact for ninety minutes, so I haven't run all those down yet -- but whatever is going on there smells. Why are you in there?"
Dean was almost done with the task when the power went out, everything falling dark and quiet. Castiel could hear the swish of the wind and snow outside. He just focused on the feeling of Dean fixing the last few feathers by feel, already so good at it. Then, warm arms slid around him and there was the soft press of lips against the back of his neck.
“I...I’m really not,” Castiel started to protest quietly, blushing some and tipped his head. He paused to think about the nests, few he’d seen, in Heaven, the bed he had at the bunker; then he thought about what would make him most comfortable. He quietly grabbed for some of the pillows and started to arrange them, “did the woman give us every pillow in the motel?”
“Sounds wonderful,” Cas agreed and he let himself glance up at Dean, studying the other man. There was a happy smile on his lips.
“All right, think you can sit up?” Dean asked now and Cas nodded his head, shifting slowly to ease himself upright and then twisting around to sit properly for the second time that afternoon. He smiled as he saw the artist was holding his shirt in hand. He reached out to accept it and carefully tug it on.
Cas paused blinking a few times to clear his vision, though he couldn’t hide the flush on his cheeks now. It was clear and in the open that Dean had read him correctly, there was no point in hiding it.  He did duck his head just a little.
Now that last part was thoughtful. Castiel hadn’t considered the best way to dispose of them on earth. He nodded in approval. “I’ll just wait here then,” he agreed quietly. Perhaps after Dean groomed some more loose feathers out, he’d show him how to oil them properly.
//I suppose I could, Cas, just don’t leave me there.// Dean jumped up onto his shoulder, definitely the familiar’s favorite place now.
“Is it selfish of me that I want our second date to be sooner rather than later?” Cas found himself asking quietly, just over the sound of the classic rock playing softly on the radio. Dean glanced at him, his green eyes sparking with something, pleasure he was fairly sure.
“Shops open for short hours, but yes. I try to be there every Sunday,” Dean replied, and then he moved to slid his arm around Castiel and turned him back towards the parking lot that they’d left the Impala in, in front of the Roadhouse.
“Not at all,” Dean promised now. “Just a double cheeseburger with bacon and some good fries, as well as a tall glass of beer and a side whiskey.”
“Dean, what if I wanted to see you before then? Not, as my tattoo artist?” Cas found himself saying, a flush rishing on his cheeks. He wasn’t generally this bold and it made him feel a little silly, but he wanted to ask, he needed to ask, right now.
“I wouldn’t mind going at all, Dean. If it’s easier for people to think we’re dating…” Castiel let his shoulder shrug and Dean just laughed softly.
“It is going well, though? You had good reviews,” Castiel pointed out honestly. He’d enjoyed the research of the place and was glad he’d chosen it.
He wasn’t prepared for it in the slightest, and the shiver that went down his spine was almost immediate. But instead he found himself fully focusing on how gently Dean was brushing his fingers through his wings, coaxing the loosest of the feathers out and straightening others. His touches almost seemed instinctive, with the way that Dean’s fingers moved some of the lightly twisted and tangled feathers till they were straight and laying like they should.
“Sure thing. Usually can’t fit someone in so soon, but I have an opening tomorrow if that works for you, around 2pm?” The voice was easy and sounded pleased.
Dean felt his heart thud. He felt worried, his stomach twisted. What was Cas trying to say? Did the angel want to leave? Even if he did, where would he go? He started to open his mouth.
“If you’re the guardian, can you take me to the Lady so I can ask her to take me home?” Castiel looks down at his hands.
“Yeah, it’s a relief. He didn’t have any experience but he’s eager to learn, and he picked things up pretty quickly. No replacement for Andrea, mind,” he says with a wink, and Benny chuckles softly. “But give him some time.”
“You act like you were putting up a fight instead of giving as good as you got.” Benny laughs, loud and full-bodied, his eyes crinkling at the corners in the same way that drew Dean to him a dozen years ago from across the room at a party sophomore year. By then he’d become more confident in his own skin, less reticent to act on impulses he would have denied not long before that.
"I got you." Dean lowers them both carefully to the ground, heedless of the blood seeping into his jacket as he keeps one arm around Cas's shoulders. "Fuck, Cas, listen, you gotta hang in there, okay? Charlie, can you hear me? Is the tracker still working, can you pinpoint our location?"
“Holy shit,” Dean mutters, then the door opens and shuts rapidly and he knows he’s all alone. His head falls back against the chair as he tries to calm his still racing heart, but there’s nothing he can do to quell the frantic pace of his thoughts. They replay every single moment, the sound of that voice causing his imagination to apply a specific face to this stranger, one that he will obsess about in the weeks to come. The memory of this night visits him often when his sleep is restless, or his days idle, and though the frequency of its occurrence will diminish over the next fourteen years, it never truly goes away.
“...and I don’t understand why you won’t let him take you on the biggest adventure of all and get naked.”
“I thought that Grandfather would come when the Master called his name, so he could see Sam,” he finally admits in a whisper, and his mother and father give him a fond look that does nothing to quash his disappointment at not seeing an actual spirit.
Dean pulls it out of his fingers as he turns around, fixing Crowley with a dark look as he steps towards him, then again, until he's pinned up against the wall. Dean braces himself with one hand on either side of Crowley's head, leaning in to nip at his throat and whisper darkly in his ear.
“All right, clear out and go back to your duties,” Missouri says in a tone that brooks no argument. “You’ll get to see our new friend at dinner, once she’s had a little time to adjust. Scoot!”
“Dude, I’ve been standing here for like ten minutes, and you’ve walked in six circles. You’re going to wear a track into the carpet. What’s wrong?”
"Would you rather I left?" Dean manages to keep his disappointment from coloring his tone, relieved when Cas shakes his head slowly. "Then close your eyes and go back to sleep."
"Eileen what the hell are you..." Sam starts to say, but the rest of the sentence dies on his lips as thunder rumbles in the distance, and rain suddenly starts to patter against the glass of the balcony doors. "No. It can't be."
"There you are, old friend. I've missed you." The wind picks up, pushing against him with more force, and the clouds shift enough to obscure that familiar light again. "I'll come back tomorrow night," he says without thinking, and is surprised to find that he means it. He lowers himself back down into the service room, pulling the hatch shut behind him.
“You kinda mentioned that before. It’s a big part of your life, then?” Dean asked curiously, but Castiel was thankful the man didn’t seem to stumble at the idea. He’d run off people just for being a religious studies student in college.
By the time Dean finished this grooming, though, Castiel wanted to do something. He felt like he was about to explode, and neither of them could ignore how hard Cas was, not with how Dean was now kneeling in front of him as he finished the feathers underneath his wing from the front. Castiel was panting a little bit, his eyes following every movement Dean made with an intensity that even he couldn’t deny.
“Yeah but you might not even be stickin around, You said it depended on work right?” Dean sighed a little. “How would I ever find you again?”
“I don’t mind, Cas.” Dean didn’t blame him for not remembering half the staff at the company. Sometimes Dean himself struggled to keep track of them all. They moved inside, someone taking their coats in exchange for a check ticket, and Dean was given a key card with a room number and wifi code scribbled on the envelope for later. With that taken care of, they shortly had drinks in hand and were stepping into the main ballroom of the party.
It was possibly the most peaceful date he’d ever been on. Dean wasn’t pushing anything even though they’d briefly discussed sex, and that made Castiel feel more confident when he finally shifted to put his glass down and tipped his head to study Dean’s face, almost unsurprised when he found green eyes considering him. Cas leaned up to kiss him gently.
“Come on dude, we’re friends right?” He said firmly and then he moved to get out of the car before Castiel could stop him. He’d help him with whatever it was. He was sure of it. “Girl trouble.”
“Well then, hun, you’re in the right place. Dean, your usual?” Ellen asked his date. Dean simply nodded and then Cas couldn’t help a little half smile now still on his lips as he felt Dean’s foot press against his own under the table.
“I thought I might do a small cleansing spell today,” he mused aloud as he and the squirrel made their way downstairs and cool spring morning. “Just to clear the air in the shop. What do you think?”
His hands moved now, and slowly the oil was spread. Cas couldn’t help the way he trembled, though, as Dean worked. He was trying to focus his breathing, trying not to think about how good this felt. The man was far too good to him; he hadn’t earned this sort of affection and he knew it.
“And as you have seen, I don’t have a familiar. You are welcome to stay as long as you need, Dean.” Castiel smiled and took another bite of his burger and chewed thoughtfully as he watched the squirrel swallow some of the food in its – his mouth. How Dean took his time, eating the small burger slowly, but fully. Dean flopped over when he was done, his stomach round. It was cute.
Saman was really the baby of the family, a surprise, coming along almost ten years after Castiel. He did miss him sometimes, they’d been surprisingly close despite their age difference. Castiel’s trips home were usually more to check on Samandriel and his mother than to appease his father.
The inside of the Roadhouse was much more bar like than the outside. Warm light, soft noise, the smell of beer and deep fried food hit his nose. Castiel let it twitch a bit at the smell. A handsome blond woman was behind the bar and gave Dean a familiar wave that he returned, and then the brunet was leading him down to a booth, only letting go of his hand so that they could slide in across from each other.
Castiel squinted at him, his blue eyes uncertain. “You realize that Christmas is just a pagan holiday that…”
Dean seemed quite content to work him over slow and steady now, letting him catalogue the sensation of his mouth, of the brush of his beard against his skin each time it came in contact with Castiel’s skin. A soft little groan slid from him again as he felt Dean’s hand slip away, but the familiar snicking noise of the lubricant bottle opening was enough to stop him from any further protest.
“Uh, yeah. He does.” Dean managed a little half smile. Okay, not a perfect relationship. Castiel didn’t want to push; he recalled Dean’s admission that his father wasn’t comfortable with his bisexuallity. He knew pressing could ruin things, and they’d only just started. “So, Cas, you ever been to the Roadhouse?”
He tried to think if he’d used candles at all in the last several weeks. He had, but he thought perhaps that the little squirrel had been in his nest and hadn’t seen. He kept the candle away from the little creature, watched how it relaxed as he moved it slightly further away. Fire scared it, then. Not the candle itself.
“Well, I am glad, I was starting to worry you’d never feel right…” Castiel paused and looked at the squirrel. “I am Castiel. What’s your name?”
“I do,” it was a soft and easy reply. Cas sighed happily now and then he let himself just look at Dean, thankful for this. “So, what’s next?”
A little snort left the Angel without him dwelling on the human action. “It is not something I expect you to understand,” he replied quietly under his breath, but knowing that Jimmy would hear him. “May I speak with you face to face?”
Once the phone was plugged in to charge Castiel moved quietly to undress himself. It was relaxing to strip down at the end of the day though it was a difference to end a date undressing alone, no matter how much he’d wanted Dean to stay. He found himself already half hard at the thought of the artist.
//Yeah. Hey, thanks, for all the care you’ve been giving me. You sure didn’t have to.// Dean shifted and curled up, his fluffy tail tucked against himself.
“That’s fine, Dean, I can wait.” She grinned and moved to sit, crossing her legs and sitting with perfect posture that, well, put everything on display. “He just help you out, handsome?”
Castiel breathed out quietly and then he set the candle gently in a holder and put it next to the bowl of water. Then he scooped the little rose quartz stone into his hand and closed his eyes. He focused on himself, breathing slowly and carefully, and drew all of the negative sensations into the stone. He could feel them shift over his skin, curling slowly into the confined form of the quartz. In a few minutes it was all gathered, and he placed the quartz down gently to mix some salt into the bowl. nce that was done he placed the stone into the bowl, then held one hand over it. Castiel’s eyes closed again as he started to murmur softly, a blessing of positivity over the bowl, allowing the gentle warmth of the spell to tickle his palm and spark in the quartz.
//Nah, I’m good here. You take good care of me, and don’t mind that I’m a squirrel. At least I’m not a moose or something.//
Cas blinked and turned his head to give him a curious look, those beautiful blue eyes resting on him.  Dean felt his breath hitch at that and found himself almost instantly grabbing Castiel’s hand as he dropped to one knee.
Dean seemed obliged and followed him into the swirl of pleasure, grunting against his skin as he came.
“Mm, take a picture?” he asked softly now, sighing a little. The hand squeezed his neck then pulled away, and he almost whimpered at the loss of contact.
“Oh….Cas..They’re beautiful.” He whispered, his fingers raising up, though he didn’t quite touch them yet. “Can I....”
“Dean, it’s just a chill little party. We want you to have a good time, you don’t need to sit around at home handing out candy.” Sam appeared in the doorway, he was dressed as Zorro, and Dean know that Eileen was dressed in a beautiful dress to match as Elena De La Vega. He rolled his eyes at his taller brother. “Look you get too drunk to drive we’ll make sure you and Baby make it home safe…”
He paused to hang up his trench coat, smoothing the fabric gently with his hand, and then leaned down to remove his shoes to leave them neatly on the shoe rack next to his trainers and Lucifer’s fancy leather boots. He rolled his eyes at the boots and straightened, padding sock footed into the next room, loosening his tie and chuckling over the sight of the blond sprawled out on his couch.
“Sounds like he’s a terror, so living up to his name, then?” Dean asked as he worked a bit more. They easily fell into this conversation, sharing a few bits and pieces about themselves, making it quite a bonding experience. Castiel watched two episodes of the X-Files before Dean pulled back.
“Take care, Cas, I’ll see you soon,” Dean called after him, and then he heard something more blurred in his mind being said to Meg while she laughed easily as the door swung closed.
“I suppose on occasion we do,” Castiel mused quietly and then he rolled his neck, humming a little, his blue eyes looking thoughtful. “You don’t have to take me, do you?”
“A moose?” Blue eyes went wide. Castiel had never seen a familiar that size, though he was sure they must exist.
“You better,” Dean adjusted his hat briefly and then nodded. “All right, let’s go.”  He gave Eileen a roguish wink, she rolled her eyes and then playfully winked back as he went past her to go towards the door.
Cas couldn't help wondering, absently, how it would feel without the condom. He also was starting to drift down and could feel the mess on his own stomach, the way Dean was already murmuring softly in his ear, his fingers moving to grab something that was used to mop up the worst of the mess.
Castiel doesn't know how to respond to that, so instead he puts his arms around Dean's waist, pulling him close before rolling him into his back.
That evening at supper she hands it back to him, now fastened to a sturdy leather thong, and he slips it over his head with a grateful smile.
Dean waits, every muscle in him tense, and when several minutes go by with no movement he finally takes a deep breath and runs for the opposite treeline, legs pumping hard, forcing himself to keep his eyes on the forest and not look behind him. Storm screams in agony, and Dean stumbles in surprise and nearly falls, arms flailing wildly as he regains his balance. With every pounding footfall he expects to feel fire upon his back, but he reaches the other side without incident, diving into the foliage headfirst and landing hard on the forest floor, rolling onto his back to catch his breath.
“You mean, what if he does to you what you did to him?” Dean closes his eyes, then nods. “Then I’ll be here to comfort you. And maybe, when he’s had some time, he’ll give you a another chance, too.”
“I suppose that’s true, in a way. Who better to guard a realm of discarded human children than the first of those we were asked to take away?”
"That was your only expectation? Did I not strike you as imposing?" There's a hint of humor in that voice, and it takes all Dean has to stay where he is, staring skyward with his hands behind his head. "A mystical being to be feared? It seems you at least thought I’d do harm to your person."
“You spit anger in my direction because I disturbed you with your lover, though you know full well that we have an appointment that falls on this night but once a year. Did you think I would quietly excuse myself because you had
“Do it yourself if you’re so eager to die!” He says it in anger, realizing his mistake too late when resolve crosses Castiel’s face. “Cas, don’t…”
He's mulling it over, letting his head continue to hang against his chest as he pulls in the net, and notices that he's not alone. Someone else is in the room with him just a few feet away, their breathing even and heart beating dully inside their chest, the scent that lingers on their clothes familiar and warm.
Cas places a hand against the wall on one side of Dean’s head. “I’m sorry your friends and family are trying to embarrass you.” He turns to face Dean, placing his other hand on the wall, caging him in but not touching, and Dean swallows. “But I thought you might want to know that I find it very encouraging.”
"I do, because normally it's unnecessary, but considering the situation your paranoia is probably warranted a bit."
"Yes, yes," the king says, standing to face Dean once again, hands clasped before him, crop dangling from his long fingers to brush at the dusty earth on which they stand. "Except that I'm afraid I can't give you what you want."
“I think that you know more about this place than you’ve told me.” Castiel’s whole body tenses, and his eyes widen slightly. “And I think that you want to tell me, but you don’t know how.”
"I'm pretty sure ditching out of the bathroom window of the bar was a deliberate act for which I am solely to blame."
The horses are fidgety as he works, knowing that something is up, and when he's finished he goes to the far stall first. Gabriel bumps Dean's shoulder with his nose as if to wish him luck, but Samandriel lowers her head to brush against his face, as if to ask him to stay, and he whispers that he's sorry as he strokes her. Impala gives him a baleful look and stamps the floor of the stall with one hoof.
"Hey, don't be like that. Everybody has at least one really bad relationship that they have no idea how they got into, much less stayed in. You’re still socially stupid when you're coming out of college, even if it’s grad school."
Cas gives him a small smile, and Dean returns it before sliding out of the booth to saunter off to the back as casually as he can manage. Thankfully there's no one in there, so he shuts himself into the lone stall and leans against the door with his hands on his knees, trying to calm his racing heart.
“Where are we going?” Castiel doesn’t answer, but by the time Dean’s finished with his question they are standing in the throne room of the castle at the center of the labyrinth. He snaps his fingers, tapping his foot impatiently as Dean watches him with an amused smile.
“Yeah, and he’s probably sore that one of his best ones went missing around the same time as a certain dragon, naturally he’s going to be suspicious of you.”
Darkwing comes closer, standing just out of reach. It strikes Dean as odd, but he keeps his gaze out on the city, not wanting to spook him.
Still no fire burns, the bed frame is empty and in disrepair, and the balcony curtain he’d touched ten years ago is still pooled on the floor. He’s certain now that in another life it was his family’s solar: his mother’s chaise sat in front of the oriel window, his father’s desk opposite the fireplace, the tapestry that fascinated Dean so much hanging beside it.
Samandriel visibly relaxes. "I'll, um, I'll get dressed, but yeah. I'd like that. Thanks." He turns towards the bedroom but pauses.
The boy opens his mouth to answer, but then his eyes fall to the amulet hanging from Dean’s neck. “Where...where did you get that?” he sputters, pointing to the pendant, and Dean clutches it defensively as he backs up a step. The man shakes his head, running a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry, they told us none of you know where you came from. Don’t be alarmed. It’s just, I
“Hi Mother Mary!” he says cheerfully, and she pats his hand with a smile. He’d started calling her that years ago when Dean introduced her as “My mother, Mary” and it stuck, first because he thought it was funny, but then out of habit.
"Don’t be petulant. I'm doing my level best to be civil to you, given the situation you've put us in..."
"But only you have reached the end," the king says solemnly, and Dean falls to his knees again, hanging his head, hands dangling between his knees.
. The way you might be drawn to a person you see across the room, or find yourself enmeshed in a conversation that you never want to end. You know what I mean?”
“Hey handsome,” Dean says, giving him a wink that shows he’s completely recovered. “Fancy seeing you here.”
"I thought so." Dick's tone is full of the smug satisfaction that comes with assured victory, and Cas jerks his arm away.
Dean actually laughs at this, falling onto his back again, any trepidation forgotten for the moment. "It means when you're not working."
Air exhales from Cas's nostrils as harshly as a bull preparing to gore a matador, and Dean wonders if Cas still has enough power to smite the single human being who has pissed him off beyond his breaking point today.
“I know. It’s okay. I’m proud of you. You’re gonna do great.” He manages not to choke as he says it, and Sam smiles faintly before turning to place a hand on the bookshelf next to his closet; empty now, a thin layer of dust that stops where dozens of spines lined the three shelves the only evidence of their recent occupation. “Wish I could take this with me.”
"You know, don’t you?" He hangs his head, lets out a huff of air, pressing his palms against the table as hard as he can, wishing he could leave his embarrassment pressed into it when he pulls away. "That's why you're always so nice to me, so willing to go along with whatever I want to do. Because it's all you can give me."
"I went through all the crime scene photos from the suspected arson cases. I've been through them before, but they seemed unremarkable at first."
His old friend is much closer now, and he knows it has nothing to do with atmospheric conditions or the rotation of the earth. It looms larger than every other star, so much so that he can't block it completely from sight with a single raised fist. It pulses a white so pure it's almost blue, like a breathing object instead of a lifeless rock that burned out a million years ago. Dean stares, breathless with wonder, unable to believe his eyes as it comes ever closer. He can actually track its progress across the night sky, as though it's been creeping ever closer these past few weeks and is now in a steep dive towards the earth itself.
“In the castle,” Sam says easily, matter-of-fact, like it’s a discussion they have regularly. “We should have let that king dude keep him, and he’d probably still believe. No. Be alive. Yeah. What was his name? Castle. No, that was the building.” Dean holds his breath, wondering what will happen if Sam says the name out loud. Until now, he wasn’t even sure that he knew it. “Cassiel? Carriel? Carry on?” He giggles, belting into fragments of song and then trailing off, somber again, then turning his head to look at Dean. “We should have left him there.”
"But,” Charlie starts, and when Dean rolls his eyes she barrels forward in a rush. “If I make an app we can kill two birds with one stone! You can hook up with someone who's actually in the life, and they'll understand special circumstances like that, even that you have to keep your true identity a secret. I can make it nationwide, maybe you could meet someone in one of the big cities who's looking to settle down somewhere quiet?"
"Wait, so you just ran into a guy you went to school with when we were kids and now he's living there and working as your lackey? Did he lose a bet?"
Castiel is still staring at the ceiling, only the hand resting on his chest telling him he's still alive as he feels it rise and fall with each breath. In his peripheral vision he can see Dean prop himself on one elbow.
"I can't," Dean whispers, but his face is full of confusion, like he's no longer sure why. As though he's not burning with the same curiosity that Castiel feels like a living flame. He wonders if this is what it's like for humans when they encounter the fae: speechless with wonder, longing to touch, bespelled by the sight before them.
“Dean, we’ve been together for almost four years. Haven’t you thought about it at all?” Cassie is sitting in the middle of his bed, legs folded beneath her, staring at him quizzically.
"...so glad when the season finally ended, I swear it was, like, coach was on a mission to spit in all of our faces while screaming until that vein popped out in the middle of his forehead and, like, it was so hard not to laugh and make it worse..."
The thing is, spending time with Cassie really does help ease the ache that’s been lingering in his chest, like the tail end of pneumonia that just doesn’t want to leave your lungs. She’s smart and attentive, and Dean can see the burgeoning journalist in her by the way she asks him questions. She’s also very pretty -- curly brown hair, dark eyes, smooth skin -- with a smile lovely enough to light the room when he finally gets to see it in all its glory.
"It sounds like the kind of bullshit mantras they cling to, but I can't see the reasoning. Why now, after all this time? Don't make a lick of sense."
"I'm saying it requires far less effort for equal reward. Whether I stay here or go to the masquerade, the outcome is predictable."
"Yeah," he says, having decided. "That will be the last thing I do before I go away for good. Tear it all down and lay it to rest. Maybe I'll drag the timbers down to the beach and pile them up on the sand, right in the spot where I found him." He wonders at the tightness in his throat, talking about a father that died for him long ago, for all intents and purposes. "I can set it alight like a funeral pyre. Cleanse myself of the past so I can leave it behind."
He throws his head back with all his strength, hearing the satisfying crunch of Bartholomew’s nose breaking as he stumbles backwards. Dean turns and grins, grenade pin dangling from his teeth as Cas throws his arms around him.
“So you’re trying to get him to talk to a professional, so he can, what? Learn to apologize to Sam?”
"Isolation is a form of self-harm, Clarence," she'd said senior year, when her psych major was making its presence known so much that he was beginning to feel like the third wheel in their friendship. "Emotional cutting for people who don't like sharp objects." There was worry beneath the sarcastic lilt of her voice, and he could never explain well enough to put her at ease. He still can't, but time and physical distance makes it more difficult for her to nag him about it constantly, and the added value of the current pandemic is that he doesn't have to justify his lifestyle even to her.
"Gee, how can I resist the urge to be just another name on this exceptionally long list? It's all I ever wanted."
“You never said goodbye. I always thought that meant you would come back, but so much time passed. I had begun to give up hope.” He smiles, and in that smile is a starry glow at the distant corner of the universe. “Suddenly there you were, only you said that soon enough you would go away. Go away for good. I couldn’t lose you again, and so...I fell. I fell for
"Sure, unless you're around, and then he's just going to follow your lead and do whatever you want to do."
Castiel clenches his hands into fists, and Dean can hear the leather of his gloves creaking against the strain.
"I wouldn't believe it of Gwen," she murmurs, scrolling down a bit. "She's more level headed than the rest of them, and though she tends to hang back and let others take the lead, she doesn't go along with things that don't suit her."
“Bad enough that I still feel guilty about it. I took advantage in a situation when he was vulnerable, and...and he doesn’t know it was me.” He rubs his chest now, because suddenly it aches, hollow and deep. “When we first started hanging out I...I figured he’d get bored with me quickly, and it wouldn’t be an issue. I’d never have to tell.”
Before they leave, he sees just a scrap of blood-soaked cloth, all the remains of a once tan trench coat. He pinches it between his fingers, then crushes it into the fist of his left hand, his own blood seeping into the fabric.
“New York. The Gray Lady, if you can believe it. Bottom of the ladder, but better pay than I get now with the opportunity to move up.”
Calm again, he raises his head enough to make eye contact with himself in the mirror, then nods and stands up straight. He peruses his reflection, turning to the side with a hand in his pocket, then doing his best blue steel before he shoots finger guns at himself.
“We are not naming our children after ancient legends and folktales,” Mary says without looking up, rocking Sam against her. “It’s bad luck.”
,” he says firmly, making a left out of the cemetery and keeping his eyes on the road. “And I’m glad I figured that out before I made a huge mistake.”
“She wasn’t right for you, you know.” There’s still a bit of lag in Bobby’s speech, but Dean understands him just fine even though he wasn’t paying attention. All week he’s been distracted, hands on whatever he’s doing while his mind floats far afield, thinking of blue eyes and long fingers and Castiel, always Castiel, hovering on the edge of his consciousness.
Sam runs to his brother, throwing his arms around his waist. "I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Dean, he's coming and it's my fault!"
“You wear a different face when you think no one is watching. Pensive, and maybe a little sad.” She rolls onto her side to balance on an elbow as she pokes Dean in the ribs, and he shies away from her with a grunt. “You can talk to me about it.”
It's difficult to immediately stop doing something that has so quickly become part of his daily routine, so it takes a couple of days before Cas catches himself mindlessly adding things to his online shopping cart. He stares guiltily towards the kitchen at his new coffeepot mascot, imagining the little bear shaking its head in admonishment. His cursor hovers over the button for checkout while he bites his lip, considering as he reviews the items and realizes that not a single one is a necessity, despite the fact that the last Buzzfeed list he'd combed through touted itself as "32 Helpful Products That Will Solve All Your Bathroom-Related Problems". Does he really
It's early evening before Dean gets back to his apartment and heads directly to the shower, eager to wash off the grime from the garage. There's a part of him that really wants to go to bed for a few hours after that, see if he can get some more sleep before he goes back out on patrol tonight. He'd gotten six in after he finally kicked Charlie out of the cave, so bone tired that he'd slept hard, but ever since then his mind has been racing with the events of the night before. Bobby knew he was distracted, but years of experience as Dean's father in practice if not by blood had taught him when to leave well enough alone.
Castiel returns to his castle in a swirl of feathers and bad temper, snapping his cloak away and flopping into the throne at the far end of the room.
"You think they're deliberately referencing what killed your mother as a way to communicate with you?"
“I can take it from here, then,” Dean says with a calm he doesn’t feel. Balthazar turns to face him, bag of whiskey clutched to his chest, and Dean tries not to laugh out loud at the contrast of his regal outfit offset by a canvas bag decorated with cartoonish produce and emblazoned with
There’s a door at the bottom, slightly ajar, and he pushes it open with both hands. “Hello?” he calls out. This corridor, too, looks much like that of his own home even in the dark, though this place has no tapestries to warm its damp stones. “Is anyone here?”
"Well, we got some info from this guy Davey that we didn't have time to follow up on today..." Dean trails off at the look he gets from Cas. "What? We really should look into everything, after all the time it took for us to get here."
"You know, I never thanked you before. For the cupcake, when it was my birthday." He hadn't known how, truth be told, and Mr. Singer had never mentioned it.
“No. I know nothing about diplomacy or politics, I barely even remember how to read, Sam.” He holds out his hands, palms up, rough and hard with callouses. “These aren’t the hands of a soldier, or a king, and I’ve no desire to be either.”
"That," Charlie says as she deftly makes a cocktail. "Why do you keep staring after that guy you were talking to?"
"I can still enjoy their company when I'm in it, especially when they're as extraordinary as you are." She laughs brightly, and if he didn't know better he'd think she were at least twenty years younger than her true age.
In the beginning he'd made an effort to get up and dress for work everyday as though he were going into the office, forgoing only his suit jacket as he sat down to his laptop. Initially there had been a constant flurry of Zoom meetings and calls as everyone tried to adjust to the new normal; he was wary of being caught off guard, of looking less than professional. Still, it only took a week for him to lose the tie, and soon after that he stopped fastening the top button of his crisply ironed shirt, and then the one below that was left unfastened as well. He started cuffing his shirt sleeves before even leaving the bedroom, then stopped bothering to tuck the shirt in altogether. Finally he got up early one Monday morning and looked long and hard at the line of meticulously cared for suits in his bedroom closet, the stiff-collared shirts, the rack of blue ties in varying shades and patterns. Eight years of accumulated wardrobe, not much different from the first bunch of suits he'd purchased at the Men's Wearhouse after getting his first job out of college. It had taken him a single afternoon to spend what took four years of overnights at the Gas-n-Sip to earn, money carefully put away for just this investment, for the future person he planned to be. He'd cringed at the price tag even though he knew it was necessary, and never imagined that in less than ten years time he would find himself staring into his closet for twenty minutes before making the command decision to stay in his pajamas for the work day.
"Your brother's been calling every half an hour, so you've got about twelve minutes before his next one."
Super Mario raises the pipe over his head with a roar, spurring his buddies out of their frozen tableau, and as they rush in Dean's direction he gets into his best fighting stance and mentally winks at his unseen admirer.
By the time they finish their food -- and even Sam can't restrain a smile at Dean's glee about having the top of his burger branded with a cowboy boot -- it seems obvious to all of them that this is just a normal case, nothing paranormal, supernatural, or otherwise.
"Maybe you could tell Cas that you got spooked because you realized you were on a date and you weren't ready, and tell him you really just want to be friends? It's not even a lie."
. Dean spent most of sophomore year wondering what his deal was, why kept to himself. He seemed to shun everyone around him as much as they did him, and Dean couldn’t understand it at all. He wondered if it was one of those things that went all the way back to elementary school, long before he’d transferred here. Some weird kid stigma like having cooties that unfairly follows you all through puberty.
“Tell Gabriel he can mind his own fucking buisness.” Castiel growled and then he was tugging at Dean. “I have better things to focus on, thank you Sam.”
Many years ago, when he’d first attended a scene event there, he’d almost lost himself. Thankfully Balthazar had agreed to come, to watch his back, and pulled him out before he could get himself into too much trouble. Never again, though, had he gone there with the singular idea of just hooking up. The club was good about their patrons and their safety, but there would always be Doms who turned out to be less than savory, and there would always be those who managed to appear normal and safe until you were alone with them.
It took a few moments, Cas moving to shed his suit coat, and  shirt as well as his coat had been, though shirt, jacket and tie landed in the nest on top of the trenchcoat in the bed. He settled, arms on the back of a chair and breathed in and out a few times before allowing his wings to pop into existence, they shook and fluttered slightly as he got them unfurled, but made sure they were small enough for the space they were in. They still took up a lot of space. Dean was very quiet for a moment or two.
He was going to need to run into town; they didn’t have any tomato sauce. He hummed under his breath and checked the time. Yeah, sauce, some pie. He didn’t have time to make his own pie, not if he wanted to spend actual time with Cas today, but…
“Someone likes his food,” Castiel laughed softly but he also sighed contently and found himself leaning back in the booth. Dean was just as easy to talk to now and he liked this a good deal, just chatting with him, getting to know him.
“Mmm, I’m getting a towel, and then I want you to get on the bed,” Dean breathed as he pulled back out of the kiss. His green eyes were dark and delightful and Castiel was in heaven—absolute heaven, and they’d hardly done much. His heaven was green eyes and a firm touch.
“Not even a one night?” Dean asked thoughtfully. His mouth moved down, his beard teasing his skin further and then there was a soft breath against his nipple and he groaned softly at it.
“The one that hurt you?” Dean mused quietly. He raised a hand though and waved it to stop Cas before he could say anything else. “You don’t have to give me any details. Been there, absolutely understand.” Dean offered an easy wink at him now and that was unexpected, but made Castiel feel warm inside. “I had to avoid the place after a break up, too, and haven't really had much reason to go back.”
The week had gone even more quickly than he could have expected, and Thursday found Castiel striding up to the front door of Family Business Tattoo in a pair of comfortable jeans and a loose button down, the sleeves rolled up to show off his forearms. He was mostly relaxed and finding many of his lingering worries from a week ago had lifted. Dean had been very responsive in his emails and they’d settled on a final form of the tattoo just the night before.
The natural urge to please Sir was strong inside of him. Cas couldn’t even start to explain it, and Dean seemed to already trip so many of the buttons he loved to have touched.
The man didn’t try to thrust into his mouth, but his fingers flexed some in encouragement, and Cas let his head bob in response. Somewhat to encourage more, somewhat because he loved the friction. He breathed out hard and then he gave a good swallow and Dean growled audibly. That was a good move, then. He shifted his position forward a bit, allowed his jaw to relax further, and then took a little more. Dean was not so long that he couldn’t comfortably take all of him; it was just something he had fallen out of practice with.
“She might have,” Dean chuckled and shortly they settled to work, Dean putting things out and letting Cas fuss until he was happy. It wasn’t really a nest, a pillow pile and blankets in a bit of a horseshoe shape. He didn’t want Dean to struggle to get out of bed to go to the bathroom or anything, but once it was assembled. High enough that when they decided to lay down they couldn’t see over it, Castiel was satisfied, not perfectly happy. It didn’t smell like his bed nest at home (which had a couple pilfered shirts of Deans and one of Sams under the pillow, the family scent was important) but it was comfortable, and Dean was here next to him, delighted by all of this.
“Sounds pretty serious to me,” Dean countered playfully and his hands trailed just a little more. “I’m down.”
Then there was the brilliant smile that made Dean’s heart pound harder. Why did Cas have to be so perfect? Why? Dean wouldn’t ever dare do anything to mess up their friendship by trying to take things further. It was far too precious to him.
//I’ll scare it off!// Dean’s reply was sharp, and the squirrel darted towards the darkness. Castiel startled, but dropped the jar, ignoring the honey in favor of raising his hands into motion. He started to chant in Latin, a simple protection spell. He cast it as fast as he could, as Dean slammed into the darkness.
