Mycroft downed his measure of port before handing out the others and moving to stand over Mina. There was panic and devotion in his expression as he watched his niece whimper in her sleep, batting her fist at some imaginary foe.
“Excellent, if you take the door to the right of the en-suite you’ll find an empty closet. You’re welcome to the entirety.” Greg goes to the door indicated and opens it to reveal a room bigger than the family bathroom at his old property. Cream walls framed dark mahogany shelves and clothing rails, all of them empty apart from a number of solid wooden hangers.
So he sits and unloads the washing basket onto the table, removing his jacket he starts organising the clothes into categories, he divided by owner , then by clothing classification from there he divided by occasion for John, casual, work, social and for Mina he went with a more functionality system, sleep wear, day wear, there was one example of something Mycroft would consider formal for a child, a white dress with large black dots, it seemed to be cotton in material but had little sleeves which would only cover the top of the child’s shoulder, he would not have guessed John would purchase her something of this ilk he had noticed the doctor straying away from anything too overtly gendered, Mina was more often than not in dungarees and a t-shirt when he visited, he had to admit the clothing was practical and allowed Mina a ease of movement he could not see a dress allowing.
Thank you so much to everyone who's followed along from the beginning or come to this near the end, you've made this a wonderful experience by way of Kudos, Subscriptions, Comments and Bookmarks and I cherish every one.
‘This is John, little one although perhaps he will simply be Dad to you, and this place right here, this is home. I think you’re going to love it.’
“Mycroft knows. Mycroft knows because Sherlock killing himself never made sense. Bringing Moriarty down was in no way impossible was it? Disproving his lies.”
“Not my orders, no, and no one within the EU, I’ve been collecting data since the termination of the interview.”
None of them struck him as special enough however, the Holmes men seemed to have such original names, did the women? Should he be selecting something to fit their expectations. But the question and mystery of this child’s creation were a source of anxiety for him. The idea of Sherlock and some faceless woman made his stomach clench, the less he analysed those feelings to more he’d be able to sleep at night.
They undress each other in silence, John taking the time to pepper Sherlock’s shoulders with kisses, taking the time to drop to his knees and kiss the small pink scar left behind from the bullet that had pierced his abdomen. Sherlock gasps and his cock twitches in interest from within its silken confines but John just smiles up at him and doesn’t touch.
Met in university, wife wants children and is unaware the husband made that impossible last year after his mistress of the time for pregnant with her second child. Secret vasectomy. riveting I know.
‘I’m sure you’re right Mrs Hudson but, I’m not sure your hip or this old bath tub is going to thank you for scrubbing it to within an inch of damage. Come on, you should be drinking tea and helping me pick baby names, not alone in here, you are after all not our housekeeper.’ At that his land lady smiled a little more brightly and took his hand, she was only slightly unsteady on her feet as he accompanied her back to the living room. The somewhat intimate moment he had interrupted earlier seemed to have come to an end, John was glad to see Mycroft maintaining his composure, it would be more difficult to make important decisions if he wasn’t.
All of that before I went to university and none of it worked. There was no relief until I went to university, until I met Victor and he introduced me to the blissful serenity of cocaine. The floating disembodiment of a seven percent solution's high.
Greg answered the phone, his voice tight with the gravely edge John had learned to expect after working a manic case.
‘Yes you are required to fill out and complete these forms, we have already been provided by most of your documents but these require your signature.’  He handed over all of three pieces of paper, John turned to find a pen amongst the clutter of the desks only to find Mycroft extending his own Montblanc towards him. He checked boxes, filled out the relevant personal information and added his signature before having the papers pulled out from under the still uncapped pen.
“What does any of this have to do with Mina, Mycroft?” John asked, losing his temper with the speed of the proceedings.
“Such a shame, your brother liked a good fairly tale, didn’t he Mr Holmes? Although perhaps you tell yourself you’re less fanciful than him. Am I right?”
“Oh but Mr Holmes, that’s not how this story ends. Oh no, it ends with three words. I like the symmetry, three gun men, three bullets and now three words. They’ll bring you to your knees, you know.”
The van he’s in stops not far from the dock, the cover of darkness should help mask their approach but there’s always the possibility of early discovery with these jobs, he addresses his team, they’re some of the best the Mets got.
‘Alright, Mrs. Hudson’s got her heart set on visiting Kew Gardens and taking Mina on the Christmas walk. I’m thinking we’ll go for the whole day and do lunch and everything but honestly you don’t have to come. You might just want to stay home with the wife or something.’
John met Greg’s eyes over his desk and considered how thoroughly he wanted to punch his onetime friend. He had been dragged out of the surgery for this, some illusion created by a criminal or some prank played by a vindictive officer. It could not be real, it was cruel and the fact Greg seemed so determined to go along with it offered John no comfort. Greg had been drowning in guilt, the dark rings under his eyes, tobacco stains on his fingers and the general manic energy that comes from too much coffee and not enough sleep made it oh so obvious. He wondered if Greg was haunted by Sherlock too, whether the image of his flatmate flashed behind his eyes when he closed them at night. The nightmares had returned in full force and he knew he was slowly sinking back into the depression his life post war had consisted of. But it was like that, like coming back from war, being without Sherlock, being without his brilliant mind and the excitement which followed in his wake.
Greg wanted to scoff at the tabloid nature of their comment but he couldn’t help the hit to his self worth. He was a good copper and liked to think he was a good team leader but sometimes the responsibility put him on the wrong side of the public eye. He was too well known now anyway. His face had graced the newspapers too often over the last decade to truly make him feel anonymous in a crowd.
John turned when he felt a hand on the shoulder furthest from Greg; Mrs Hudson leant over smiling down at Mina sleeping soundly.
“Alright, so let me first say that my marriage for the last few years has been somewhat…” Greg seemed to be struggling for the word so John filled in.
The other members of the room fell silent; Mrs. Hudson and Greg looking at him while Mycroft was doing anything but.
“Well alright, if you’re impatient, we’ll miss out the love story and jump straight to the confrontation. The hero and the villain stand on a roof. They look out over London, seemingly insignificant to the sprawling metropolis, and they discuss their final problem. Two brilliant minds, two players, one bored and the other terrified, the great game and a final solution.”
‘I’ll see you tomorrow John, promise me you’ll think about it.’ She smiles at him slightly and it hurts John that she looks sad, he hadn’t meant to upset her but he can’t see how doing what he wants isn’t selfish.
He hears Mina stir behind him and he prays she doesn’t wake up, he wouldn’t be able to sooth her while holding the gun. He has to move, his leg doesn’t want to support him but he manages to bring himself to standing. He half falls forward as he tries to walk but catches himself on the door frame. He sees the emergency mobile Mycroft had stashed in every room of the house. It’s an old Nokia, one of those bricks you used to get when mobile phone technology was something new and exciting, the ones that look nearly indestructible. He grabs it up, the damn things on silent in the bedrooms but the idea is for them to call out not accept calls. He pulls the door to behind him before taking a seat on the top step, he stretches his leg as much as possible before it seizes.
‘No thank you Doctor Watson if you just bring the bag up, the car ride put her to sleep. You’re lucky with this one, she seems to be an okay sleeper, I’ve seen much worse.’ He follows the woman’s slow and steady footsteps trying to get a clearer view of the little girl encased in the bundle.
I find myself at a loss as to how to approach this one John, with all the people I have faced over my journey I have never really struggled to find a point of weakness to attack or exploit but I am struggling to read this man. He has little in his life he cares overtly for; with his parents’ dead and a serious lack of affection towards those children he himself has fathered this man appears to the outside observer, heartless.
“Tell me about your children, Abram? What is it, boy and girl? No, no, two girls. Separate mothers; you loved the first, not the second. Why was that, I wonder?”
“Well, Gregory, they are numerous and only partly salacious. Mostly I enjoy the idea of you finding comfort in my home. I do so wish for your happiness Gregory.” Greg found himself grinning fondly, he believed Mycroft wholeheartedly and informed him thusly as well as telling him the feeling was reciprocated.
The silver pocket watch was an antique and John was surprised it still worked but work it did, minute hand was a little fast but still it ticked.
She tapped that same finger over the picture of his face. “I know this one. I don’t remember where from but I do.” She looked to John who nodded his head in agreement; who was he though? A former client, villain, was it something to do with Sherlock?
“So, you know after Sherlock, I just ended up doing some thinking about what made me happy and what didn’t and how I should be happy, you know,” Greg carried on; waving his arms in a display John was sure had many passersby looking for the aeroplane the fool was trying to guide in.
Mycroft leant back. They’d been so close in that moment that Mycroft had been able to smell the halitosis lingering on his breath. “I’m going to tell you a story, Mr Holmes., Part of this story you know but part of it, oh, part of it is a mystery, Mr Holmes.”
‘I’m making the assumption that’s a good thing.’ John slides off the chair so he can look his daughter in the face. She stares at him while sucking her fist, he can’t stop smiling, she garbles and he can’t stop the laugh, it makes it all the better when, releasing her fist with a slip of drool, she laughs too. He can see some teeth but not the correct amount for a two year old. From everything he’s observed he’s certain Mycroft is right, she can’t be two, he says as much to Lisa who looks down at the pair of them from his old chair;
‘John Mr Holmes is waiting in his study for your arrival, if you’ll follow me,’ The other brunette is still smiling at him and John wonders vaguely if the hair colour forms some part of a Mycroft employee uniform,
Greg deliberately raised an eyebrow at the camera putting on the most enthusiastic pout he could manage. Behind him he heard Francis smother a snort. The poor man tried to cover it with a cough but he could hardly fool Greg.
‘No wait Mycroft,’ The detective's use of his first name brought him up short, ‘look I know we're not as close as we were a few months ago but believe me, this is something you’re going to want to stop work for.’ His screen was a blur, Anthea
“Oh yes; a Detective Inspector, the British Government, a former Army Captain and Mrs. Hudson, who was apparently instrumental in the running of a drug cartel. I wouldn’t want to meet us in a dark alley, would you?”
His life had changed just before his eighth birthday when his brother was born, he had spent the eight months leading up to his arrival on tenterhooks, his excitement could not be contained in the school rooms of the tutors his family employed and he spent many afternoons sneaking in to see his mother, he would lay with his head in her lap as she conducted experiments or considered equations. She would pause often to explain her workings and run her fingers through his hair; even now in his early forties he finds comfort in the memories of her soft attentions.
‘I’m sure John will tell you the dangers of treating withdrawal while your patient is already ill, but I digress, so yes, sex for Sherlock would appear to have been linked to his consumption of drugs. My understanding was that he was gay, but perhaps that was wrong, we never discussed our sexuality and Sherlock never strove to share a confession. He merely was himself, in the same way I am, our parents never cared who we dated as long as they could hold a decent conversation and made some form of effort not to bore them, yes our impatience is a family trait John best try to wheedle your influence into this young girl early in order to avoid it. To return to the premise however, Sherlock had vanished and managed to stay out of my notice for a year, although I searched for him continuously. You will of course know of his homeless network, they hide their own when they need to and at that time Sherlock considered me his enemy.  It was to my great surprise when a month after the year anniversary of his disappearance he showed up in one of the country’s leading substance abuse rehabilitation centres. He had placed himself in their hands for treatment and for once it seemed to take, he never confided in me the reason for this sudden decision to leave cocaine behind and I maintain to this day that he has never been truly free of it. But, for the time that he lived with you John, I do not believe he used, we all remember danger nights I am certain, but there was never an indication he gave into that temptation again. I should have had more faith in him.’
The trip is a gift for the wife. Christmas? No something more romantic, anniversary then. Husband is overcompensating for weight gain, 18 lbs over 5 months, with an expensive suit. Indulgent for a man whose hours have been cut recently but the girlfriend said it made him look young. Girlfriend younger: early 30’s, no late 20’s. Works with him. Stereotypical; underpaid assistant.
‘Yes he was, he was four in that image, he went through a distinct pirate phase and we once spent a summer trying to build a boat’ The memory is a pleasant one, even if the resulting capsize had put him off small water vessels to this day, ‘tell me you do not see the similarities, tell me I am wrong in this.’ There's silence for a long while, John continues to soak up the picture like a drowning man, desperate for any new piece of Sherlock knowledge he can have.
She has been attempting to seduce me John and I am ashamed to say I have been allowing it to continue. Not ashamed because I feel it is a betrayal to you John or even a betrayal to my sexual identity, if such a thing is possible, it is more that with every flirtatious utterance and every well placed hand I hear your voice telling me that playing with this woman’s emotions is ‘a bit not good’ but John I see this to be the most expedient and painless way to gain access to the place I need to be and security systems I need to learn.
They finish their meal happily discussing the latest football match and their colleagues, he’s glad to learn Danny’s making friends; he knows himself how hard it can be to work in their world without support. They stop for a cigarette before Danny heads home and Greg heads back to the office, the banter is easy and he thinks looking back on it he shouldn’t have been shocked when the man placed a chaste kiss on his mouth, the flirting should have been obvious but he’d missed it, somewhere between thinking Danny had been in love with Sally and finding out he was gay he’d missed the flirting. When Greg fails to respond Danny moves forward to repeat the action, Greg falls into the wall in his haste to stop it. He can see the hurt in Danny’s face and he hates himself a little because he thinks now he could have stopped this before it got painful for anyone.
But now the man stood in front of him, the height different more pronounced than normal as the detective inspector was without his shoes.
He’d been right, he’d witnessed firsthand the mans terrible guilt when John had left the room the night before, he’d confided in Greg his feelings, how he was conflicted about the future and how he would be able to help this little girl who’d seen so much so young. He’d tried to comfort him, had been brave enough to embrace the young man briefly, when he’d pressed his face briefly into Greg’s neck he’d felt the tears that decorated Mycroft’s face. He’d felt the dull ache he’d grown so used to while Sherlock had been new to consulting work, whenever he’d had to inform Mycroft of Sherlock having a bad day, a bad reaction, his concern about Sherlock’s social interactions, he’d felt it then, this time it was worse, he’d felt tears prick his own eyes as he’d held Mycroft through his sobs. That he was attracted to him he’d never denied but until that moment he’d never allowed himself to realise how deeply attached he was to the man.
Mycroft sniffed derisively. “If you are hoping to get a rise out of me, Mr Mitrović, you are going about it the wrong way.”
Mycroft and Greg had left decidedly not together, Greg being collected by Sally, who decided not to grace them with her presence and Mycroft when Anthea arrived with a new suit and instructions for a conference call with Japan, he’d seemed reluctant to get off the floor, they’d surrounded Mina with the few toys she currently had and had been testing her motor skills. According to their limited research she wasn’t too far behind where she should be, John would look into language development more extensively in the morning but for this evening they’d done all they could,
The front door is protected from the elements by a small portico, between the white pillars at the front and the solid dark wood door are two low walls, they provide a border between the flowerbeds lining the front façade of the house and the entry. Mycroft sinks onto one of the walls, his arms supported by his knees while his hands cup his face. John doesn’t want to pry, no matter his relationship with Sherlock or his now seeming relation to Holmes family he does not know Mycroft well enough to know if he would accept any comfort through his distress. He decides to act halfway between his instinct to provide care and his respect for the man’s personal space. He sits on the opposite piece of wall so he’s facing Mycroft but he makes no move to instigate further conversation, if the man asks him to leave he will but on the off chance he wants company John is inclined to stay.  They stay silent for a long time, at some point Mycroft moves his hands so they no longer cover his face, he clasps them together instead but seems unwilling to make eye contact.  After a break of ten minutes Mycroft speaks again;
The second year Sherlock gives John a selection of miniature home made jams in matching jars that stack perfectly one on top of the other and with the tops covered in beautifully printed cotton squares and tied with fine string.
There were general outbursts of shock from Greg and Mrs. Hudson. Greg was demanding to know how Mycroft could have missed an assassin entering Baker Street, wasn’t it always under surveillance? John heard all of this, he remembered the man walking past him and even on the day Sherlock had jumped he’d been in the hall; standing over Mrs. Hudson he could see it in his head. John heard Mycroft’s muttered apologies to a distraught Mrs. Hudson and an explanation of how someone, Moriarty or Moran, had changed the feed to a recorded section from the day before. It had been well done but was not flawless. Mycroft hadn’t been watching because Sherlock hadn’t been in residence. He had believed any danger would follow him to Barts, which as it turned out the majority did.
Denise pulled the paper in front of her chair, squinting slightly at the thick document. “What would I get, are we doing this fifty: fifty?”  She asked as Greg pulled one of the pages out of the stack to present it to her. The list outlined the division his solicitor had suggested and Greg had been happy with it. Hell, Greg would have been happy with less.
The trip round John’s local Tesco had been entertainingly novel, watching Mycroft push a trolley and exclaim over the price of milk had warmed his heart, walking behind the man and watching him stretch, exposing the true shape of his back, watching him sway his hips slightly, unconsciously emphasising his enviable backside, Greg had been so lost in his desire to stand close behind him, whisper in his ear, kiss his neck that he’d almost missed the exchange between Mycroft and the woman buying yoghurt. He’d looked up in time to see the woman, no older than thirty, throw a large pot of natural yoghurt at Mycroft, the fact the put had opened spoke both the woman’s strength and the force behind the throw, Mycroft had been decorated by the dairy product but what made Greg laugh the hardest was not the look of the bespoke suit newly decorated it was the look of pure shock on Mycroft’s face. He’d had to use the trolley as a brace while he laughed so hard he found it difficult to breath, he’d looked younger in that moment, the surprise forcing him to drop his proper persona for one so much more like Sherlock. He’d considered Greg leaning over the trolley and had quickly scooped up a hand full of the yoghurt and slapped it in Greg’s face. Greg hadn’t stopped laughing, he didn’t care if he looked moronic but being there with Mycroft had been the happiest he remembered feeling in months, since well before Sherlock had died.
Mina let out a cry of distress from her car seat at Greg’s outburst but stayed mercifully asleep. John slapped him hard on the shoulder, the last thing any of them needed right now was a screaming infant and with the sheer amount of tension in the car Mina was sure to react. Greg raised his hand to acknowledge his mistake but kept his phone glued to his ear, clearly listening to Sally on the other end explain some form of fuck up.
‘Hey no, don’t, don’t worry, you didn’t know, I speak about him like he’s here a lot, it’s my fault, don’t, don’t be upset or anything’, yeah definitely awkward, more awkward when he sees a slight shine in her eyes behind the thick glasses. He reaches for another topic, anything right now to diffuse this situation, pointing to the glow he asks,
‘Oh those belonged to Sherlock, my old, I mean Mina’s dad. We lived here together when he was alive and he conducted science experiments. Those probably got put in there by Mrs Hudson; she tidies without even meaning to half the time. But it would be best to leave it there for now, Mycroft can probably remove it but I would hate to interrupt the sexual tension in my living room’
“Denise you can have the house and I am willing to divide the pension fund in a way which reflects both of our deposits into it but I won’t be paying you maintenance payments and I won’t be expecting any off you. Our incomes are our own and yours have been separate from mine for the majority of our marriage. You have no right to my income and you know it.”  Greg watched his wife suck her teeth at his statement.  She slid the list back over to him and stood inelegantly from her chair.
‘Night Tammy, we’ll see you in the morning. You can help me stay calm about meeting Sherlock’s folks in the evening.’ He tries his winning smile but he knows something’s missing from it. He watches his new friend wander down Baker Street before forcing himself to bed. Best get as much sleep as he can, who knows what tomorrow would bring.
That final time I stood in a room with you, in one of the labs at St. Barts mirroring our first meeting, you were astounded by my lack of love for that woman. Know that your shock was well founded. I have never known a woman so deserving of devotion and protection as Martha Hudson.
Moran seems to be moving on so I suppose I shall do the same. I wonder if you ever had a pet, I wish I could simply ask you, or deduce it I suppose.
‘Mr Holmes, your wife wished for me to inform you that dinner is ready to be served, if you and Dr Watson would like to make your way to the main house, I believe Mrs Holmes is waiting in the drawing room presently.’
‘JUST FUCKING LOOK AT HER MYCROFT’ he’d not expected his voice to rise, not expected the horror to morph into an anger so violent he couldn’t see straight, he wanted to hurt someone, someone had hurt this little girl, the child of his best friend and he wanted to hurt them. Wanted to end them.
“At the start I would tell him not to call you, you know, I figured you wouldn’t want to be interrupted, but that just made him worse. It was like this itch to him in the end, he was strung out without you there in that moment. So I’d crack and yell at him to get you here and the second you said you were on route it was like his entire body relaxed; went loose as cooked spaghetti sometimes. It was worrying, like you were a new drug, but I think that’s what love can be like sometimes; especially if you’re as intense a person as Sherlock.”
The sound of heavy footfalls on the stairs, coming down from the upstairs bedroom, bring John back into the present. There’s been no real sound since the two men had gone up to review what would become Mina’s bedroom; the realisation that this meant John’s would now be occupying Sherlock’s old room was something he repressed, how he would be able to exist in that space was beyond him. He’d failed to take it in earlier only stepping in to change his clothes before the social worker had descended and even those few moments of naked vulnerability in a room so inherently Sherlock had caused a deep routed ache in his stomach he couldn’t identify.
It was so inherently Sherlock, the sword on the wall, dark wooden frames holding antique pipes, silk slippers holding an ungodly amount of cigarettes, those he removed, it wouldn’t do to have little hands picking them up, framed scientific images; DNA structure and what John is certain is a copy of the molecular composition of cocaine, that could be thought of as rather disturbing; considering Sherlock’s addiction but John had to admit the formation of molecules was beautiful in its way.
‘Come on Tammy I told you it was one time,’ she’d come to stand next to him at some point during his recollections, she’d lost the puppy face but he determined one was even worse in John’s opinion,
‘How’d I manage that sir?’ Sholto chuckles, his smile suggests a story John will find humiliating for years to come is to follow,
‘Air support this is D.I. Lestrade indicating readiness for declaration, ready to move on activation of flood lights.’ There’s a moment of silence while the helicopter circling above receives their signal.
‘Just over three years ago Sherlock took himself off grid, he’d done this occasionally taking himself out of my surveillance as a way of proving himself smarter than me, but usually I found him quickly.' He took a slightly deeper drink from his cup before putting the cup down, 'The drug problem started in university you see, Sherlock came to London to live independently from the family but instead of the intellectual equals he’d been promised by our mother he found himself surrounded by fools, temptation and boredom. As the spray painted image above John's head proves my brother has never dealt with boredom well, university i'm afraid to say proved to be no different.’ Taking a sip of tea again Mycroft loosened his tie while crossing his legs in front of him. He had stopped making eye contact with either of them a sentence in and didn’t seem to be in any hurry to recommence it. This was a narrative to him and one he clearly did not enjoy revisiting.
He unfolds himself from the chair and the thick blanket, stretching is back and shoulders he thinks he feels a little better, warmer certainly and his brain is a little clearer, it feels a little less heavy on his shoulders than before his nap. He walks towards the nearest of the suited men and asks quietly;
‘I’ he suddenly feels awkward, Mycroft dismissing his concerns would be a blow and he feels slightly fragile already, ‘you know what this was stupid, ignore it, just how are you?’
“Yes she does, she deserves the whole world. But until you can figure out how to give her that we should focus on making the one we all have safe for her and for everyone,” John said.
Sally secures his gun, he realises he’s shaking, he’s going into shock, he looks down at his hands and realises they’re covered in blood, Sammy’s blood, definitely shock, he’s lost officers before but this is worse, she’s so young, it’s all he can think.
Greg was still married, Mycroft seemed to be ruling the world from his desk and there was still the mystery of the silvery haired woman who’d been running around Mycroft’s house. In his warm embrace Greg had forgotten to ask about her identity but he was sure she was in some way related to Mycroft; her eyes had been too similar for them not to share DNA.  God but that kiss, he ran the tips of his fingers against his lips lightly, bringing back the feeling of pressure he’d experienced earlier. It’d been slow and light but he’d felt more emotion in it than he could ever remember experiencing in a kiss before. He felt they’d been working up to this moment for so long that the idea of waiting before progressing made him unhappy but he knew it’d be a disservice to both of them for this to move forwards before Greg was free of his wife. It’s not that he’d never had grounds for divorce, he had numerous, but he’d never found something to motivate him to take that final move and hire a lawyer. He was scared to be alone, he’d been married for fifteen years and he wasn’t sure he knew how to be without her anymore, his friends told him he should respect himself enough to leave her, his family said he deserved better and Sally liked to remind him on a regular basis that he would be a catch for anyone. He’d never hidden his bisexuality from anyone, he was comfortable with himself and what it meant to find both sexes attractive but he thought it might still shock some people if he ended up dating men, one particular man especially, he wanted to find Mycroft, wanted to know if he had something to look forward to once he signed those papers. Walking out of the library he entered the same hallway as before, the empty space was filled with the ticking of an old fashioned grandfather clock, the sound reminded Greg of a metronome he’d had while learning to play the piano with his grandfather, he’d always found the regular tick soothing.
‘He can’t have her.’ The near snarl that escaped John when he registered who Greg was referring should have been concerning, Mycroft and John’s relationship had never been good but the younger man had never struck him as distrusting. Greg knew Mycroft well enough to know such a reaction from John was unnecessary. Mycroft would see why it was imperative the child stayed with John. Sherlock would have wanted it that way.
‘You doubting yourself won’t help anyone, especially her, no one knows it all John and right now what she needs isn’t your uncertainty, she needs your love.’ He supposes she’s right but he’s not even certain of that completely, over the last day he’s felt more than he has in months, he’s emotionally and mentally exhausted and the only thing keeping him upright is the knowledge that this little girl now exists, he’s completely smitten and completely terrified, to top it all every time she smiles she gets dimples that remind her of Sherlock.
The room stands empty, a black canvas without the photographs, books and assorted writing supplies he’d littered the space with when he’d been its resident. It left him cold, the whole idea of living in this space without Sherlock made him nauseous, having to face the idea of walking down these stairs every morning and face an empty space did not appeal.  He could almost hear the violin music that filled the flat when he’d tucked himself away for the night, nights filled with nightmares of hot deserts and the heavy weight of war had left him breathless until he’d heard the chords of his flatmates musical ministrations. It never occurred to him while Sherlock was living to bring attention to the private concerts meant for him alone, but he missed them now, now the nightmares were different and there was no comfort, musical or otherwise. He couldn't stay in this room, it would have to be the nursery, which left him with the reality of staying in Sherlock’s room, inhabiting his space, a room he’d held as a private sanctum in life and now John felt like an invading force, but there was nothing for it, the baby needed somewhere to sleep and John wouldn't sleep in this room.
‘Ok this would have gone a lot smoother if Daddy didn’t have to hold you while you ate.’ John looked around the kitchen table, thirty minutes, one bowl of baby porridge, two pieces of toast, an abandoned cup of tea and a sippy cup of formula had turned the once clean kitchen into a slight disaster area, the porridge, which Mina had eaten three spoons of before deciding it would be better used to decorate the floor, table and Johns clean jumper, the slightly soggy piece of toast which Mina upon investigating had licked the jam off without eating the bread  were currently being combined into some form of starchy soup. Removing the items from his toddlers grip proved more difficult than anticipated and John was now seeing the real benefit of high-chairs.
John moved sluggishly away from the car, Mycroft watched him walk with a slight limp towards the house he knew John had been avoiding, but this to his mind was where this little girl would needed to call home.
“I know Gregory; it very rarely is,” Mycroft said before turning to address Anthea. They stood close, whispering to each other, Mycroft handing over a series of note cards and Anthea nodding in seeming agreement at whatever they contained. John was quickly losing patience.
‘Well I was wondering if you and Missy here might like to join me for a trip to Kew. The newspaper says they’ve got a lovely Christmas trail on at the moment and I thought Mina might like to see the lights. I’d certainly love a trip; I haven’t been to The Gardens in so many years.’
‘Her name was Samantha and she was wonderful, she’ll be mourned by everyone who knew her and so many who didn’t. Yes she was too young to die, none of this is fair, we lost another officer as well and just because he was in his forties not twenties doesn’t mean there isn’t a family that will mourn his loss, it’s a terrible, terrible thing to have someone you care about, someone you’re responsible for die but none of this is your fault.’ He wants to comfort him, wants to physically reach out and touch him but they’re new to this, new to intimacy and this is such an odd way for anything to start, ‘it’s no one’s fault but the man who attacked her, I feel guilt because I was her commanding officer and I left the room trusting the clear was correct, I shouldn’t have taken that decision, even if I know that I could do it a hundred times over and still pick the same option, I feel guilt because when I was helping her and comforting her, I couldn’t stop the bleeding, but I know I followed the rules, I followed my training, I know I did everything I could do, logically, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t feel the guilt of not being able to save her, the guilt of losing someone under my command. You always feel that guilt.’
He walks back to his office, locking himself in the room before Sally can interrupt him; he leaves the lights off and falls ungraciously into his chair. He should be flattered he thinks but in reality he just feels slightly sick and very sad. Sad for himself because his first kiss in six months just came from a young man he respects but has no feelings for but also for Danny, he doesn’t want things to be awkward but he thinks there’s no way to avoid it. Rejection hurts people especially if you’re not expecting it. He needs to talk to someone but the only person he wants to talk to would most likely scoff at his predicament, he decides to take a chance more because he misses his voice than anything else,
Tammy stands pointing at the Star Wars section, the higher shelves are filled with detailed Lego sets and hobby craft models but further down the shelves are filled with learning toys, there’s another non-cuddly Death star which has been turned into what John thinks is a multisensory toy, when he pushes it lights flash while the theme music plays, certain sections have been made out of reflective material while others have smooth indents and waves,
His mother shot him a look of relief, she had arguably been on her best behaviour all evening, that much was clear, but he knew her subconscious was riddled with questions, misgivings and a great deal of worry.  She’d clearly been holding them in hoping to win John over somewhat but Mycroft understood that restraint would only have lasted so much longer. Better for him to take control of the conversation now before it devolved into something obstructive; it was in all of their best interests, not to mention the interests of Mina, to create an open dialogue sooner rather than later.  He turned to John and the man’s continued smile gave Mycroft hope that this interaction may go more smoothly than their initial interactions concerning his niece.
“His friend told him he now worked at the Palace and was training new knights. The friend told our Knight that he should come along because there was someone he wanted him to meet. The Knight and his friend walked through the palace and the Knight remembered when he had studied there and felt very sad, but he followed his friend into one of the many rooms in the castle and there - do you know what he found?”
Greg feels a groan leave his lips and Mycroft inhales as if shocked. Greg pulls back slightly resting his arms around the taller mans shoulders. He clings tighter when Mycroft tucks his head between his shoulder and chin. The angle slightly off but all he cares about in the moment is getting as close as possible. He hears the light sniffs and feels a growing dampness on his collar, he clings all the tighter to the man who’s stolen his heart.
‘There is nothing wrong with projecting a perfect self image Mycroft; you only get one chance to make a first impression. You must always use it wisely.’
‘Please don’t wake up, please don’t wake up’ he muttered while waiting silently to hear any noises from Mina. None came, John was so thankful he almost forgot to scowl and Tammy when she flounced through his front door moments later brandishing a bag of what smelled like Chinese take away. Thursday night was steadily becoming John and Tammy movie and take out night a tradition which although young was providing John with something to look forward to again, his life had become more solitary while he was living with Sherlock, John had failed to realise the degree to which his life had revolved around the genius during those last few months of his life and now, with Mina, John had little opportunity to socialise with his former friendship circles, few of the rugby lads had children and his friends from the army seemed to find it difficult to relate to civilian life. Not to mention the fact none of them knew how to handle to dead housemate, best friend, potential criminal live bomb that was Sherlock, in life they’d been able to ignore his existence for the most part but in death they seemed to find it near impossible. John couldn’t say he found his life to be lacking without them but it had left him lonely.
‘She’s a good one that Mrs Heather,’ the door creeks open and the woman is back. She’s smiling slightly at him and he once again recognises the eyes, ‘Sally I’ve got to go but call me if you need me or if anyone else does. I’ll check my messages too.’
‘Doctor Watson you seem a little nervous, am I right?’ He thinks he hears humour in her voice and for once it doesn’t bother him that someone may be laughing at him. Any self-conscious thoughts dissolving at the sight of the child she lays on the sofa. Now he can see her face he doesn’t think he’ll ever stop wanting to look.
Mycroft chuckles lightly at this, but to John there’s no happiness in it, ‘How little you know John, that’s always been my responsibility.’  John, who’s spent the majority of his life caring for others is crushed both by understanding, because he has often felt this way, and a deep seated sadness, because he knows from experience that there is little someone can say to remove that feeling of guilt and responsibility.
“I’m sorry ma’am but Mr. Holmes has asked that we hold off on the details until he had a chance to speak with you himself.”
'Because I could never be good enough Greg,' John had always believed Mycroft Holmes had impeccable timing, both bad timing and good, but either way it was impeccable, he entered the office,just in time to hear John's dejected response, his emotions firmly hidden behind the neutral shield both the brothers had shown on so many occasions. John remembered it last from the encounter on Mycroft's doorstep;
“Simply put, the only word he was saying was “Holmes”, like a bloody broken record until  Daniel started on his family; I’ve noted it as a potential weakness in his file that his mother died last year. He started talking about the refuge where we’ve moved the children. He knew all about it; which children were there, which agents were guarding them, which of them sneak off to have a cigarette two hours in.”
‘You need to pick a bedroom, a name and then you need to accept your impending fatherhood’ John laughs at that, Mycroft is being entirely honest, but he can sense the edge of panic in the man’s tone.
She had proceeded to look him over once, cup his face in her hands and declare Gregory to be her patient for the duration of his stay, Mycroft had objected, going as far as using John’s impending visit as a reason for her to keep her distance. Of course she had insisted she was perfectly able to do both before she pushed her way past him into his bedroom. So he had left her to her ministrations safe in the knowledge his staff were on hand to prevent his mother from becoming too enthusiastic in her care. He wouldn’t have put it past her to try shaving the man’s face or washing his hair.
“Well Sebastian wasn’t a runner or anything; he didn’t technically work for Frank. He came over with a load of uncut product the year before Frank went to jail. He had propositions for Frank about expanding outside of Florida. I never liked him, Mycroft, I don’t mind telling you. He had a rather nasty habit of rubbing cocaine into his gums. They’d bleed something awful and he’d just spit that blood anywhere he liked.”
‘I am afraid dear Mrs. Hudson that this was not a planned outing, there have been some interesting developments in my late brother’s life and now I need access to his home, for reasons that will shortly become obvious. I am not alone however.’
“Am I allowed to ask questions, John, or are we leaving the topic of Sherlock alone? Either answer is fine.”
‘I’ll try Mycroft’ their conversation ends here, John quietly thanks Anthea for her help so early in the morning but the only response he gets is a slight nod. Her features are kind however and he doesn’t come away from the morning’s drama with quite the same level of self loathing he would expect.  He’s uncertain how to spend his morning now; he knows he won’t return to bed, fear of another nightmare would keep him awake if he tried, but he wants to do something useful or constructive. He finds sitting with his own thoughts so soon after an attack of this kind deeply unhelpful but for once the house is clean and organised, the laundry has been done and even Mina’s toys have been organised in the toy chest they’ve taken to keeping in the living room.
‘Well Dr Watson in answer to your question,’ he pulled the folded paper out of his pocket and passed it to the Doctor. ‘This photograph changed my mind.’
‘Doctor Watson, it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. We have heard so much about you from our boys.’
Mycroft nodded. “Did you ever overhear your husband and Sebastian talking about any particular business?”
I'm about to add a series link so please head over and subscribe if you would like to keep up with John, Mina, Mrs. Hudson, Greg and Mycroft as well as witness the return of our wayward Consulting Detective.
‘What. Greg no. No I can’t. Jesus is that why I’m here, you’re going to try and make me look after some poor kid you found on a job.’ He couldn't accept any reality where this child was Sherlock's because, and John knew this for certain, if she was he would never let her go,
‘I have waited for longer than I would care to admit to touch you like this,’ Mycroft’s voice is soft as he moves slightly to stroke through the short strands that curve around the shell of his ear. Greg feels a slight shiver move down his spine as he slips to his knees and runs the palm of his hand across Mycroft’s thigh, the younger mans legs part slightly to allow Greg closer access, he moves his hand up, caressing the man’s hips and the side of his ribs before stroking down the firm chest in front of him,
“No buts, Francis, Gregory is a trusted member of New Scotland Yard and that should be good enough. Now John, you need to stay calm, I understand that you’re panicked slightly and I’m sure that this is bringing back all sorts for you but darling clenching your fists and lashing out is going to help no one. We don’t need defending at this moment, we’re not under attack.”
“Not to our knowledge; the information we’ve intercepted indicate he has set out to collect pictures of you; enjoying yourself while the nation mourns or some such rubbish.”
He reached for his gun at the end John, when I told him why I was there. When I said Moriarty’s name. When he truly realized he was going to die. He threw that poor girl off him and grabbed for his gun. I took him down before he reached it but it was so messy in the end. There was so much blood John.
‘How dare you make assumptions like that, how dare you, don’t you understand that I can’t do this, I can’t be here, not without him, I CAN NOT BE HERE WITHOUT HIM.’
He just needed to reach out and knock on the door, he’d bought a bottle of wine, something nice the guy in the specialist wine store had recommended, suitable for impressing people who probably had their own wine cellars. John hadn’t recognised the name but judging by the hefty price tag it should be a good one.
“Boys!” Mrs. Hudson shouted; Mina hedged sleep this time. John caught her eyelids flutter but they closed securely again when Mrs. Hudson began rubbing a small circle on her stomach. “Boys please, this is hardly important, Gregory has the gun and that’s fine. He’s not about to turn around and shoot everyone, unless that’s what you’re suggesting, Francis?”
“What bloody good is that? We had a case against him; my team have been working constantly to get ready for trial. You lot can’t just swoop in and take over. He killed two police officers; two of mine. How would Mycroft feel if one of his team died and he could do nothing but watch the perpetrator swan off to Russia?”
Greg draws his weapon once more and charges to the small room, two other officers are tight on his heels.
‘John, John are you alright?’ Greg was stood beside him, hand gripping his arm as if John was about to fall. He looked at the pair of them breifly, noting how Mycroft had yet to remove his overcoat, but he’d stood without knowing, his body shaking, he couldn’t get enough air into his lungs but he couldn’t stop staring at this little girl.  He could hear a high pitched noise, similar to when you left the kettle on the stove once it had boiled, that high pitched, soul splitting shriek, the noise was coming from him but it was happening without concious thought. He was certain he was about to throw up, his stomach may be empty but it was making a valiant effort to bring something up. He couldn’t control his tears, couldn’t control his shaking and couldn’t control himself. He thrust the paper at Mycroft and he felt nothing but a dull throb of horror running through him, the knowledge there was a little girl in the world with the DNA of the best man he’d ever known, the best friend he’d ever had, the one person in all the world he believed in without doubt. She was real, she was here and she could never know the man responsible for her existence.
He takes the stairs quickly and only stops for a moment before opening the front door wide. A young brunette stands on the front steps, her smart casual suit and badge make it easy to deduce this is Lisa. Not to mention the presence of a head of dark curls popping over the edge of a blanket. He stands for a moment simply staring before realising she’s got a bag at her feet and he’s blocking the door. Grabbing the bag he moves aside;
Mycroft remembered everything about that evening, remembered helping Sherlock into the bath, washing his hair, picking the larger sections of stuffing out in order to expedite the activity. He remembered Sherlock’s laughter when Mycroft taught him to make a bubble beard, how the nanny had returned just as he was washing the shampoo out of Sherlock’s hair. She had grabbed his arm, shouting about how irresponsible he was being, when she had pulled him Sherlock had slipped, leaning back as he had been, he lost balance, his head coming into contact with the porcelain bathtub before Mycroft could catch him. They had both cried then, the nanny screaming at Mycroft that it was his entire fault, he had hurt his brother. The moment his mother swept into the room he thought he was saved, the nanny started spluttering explanations, blaming Mycroft. His mother merely looked at him, her eyes still mostly empty. She had taken Sherlock out of the nanny’s arms and held him close while asking Mycroft to explain what had happened in as much detail as he could. At the time he had been reminded of the birds of prey his father had taken him to see when she had looked at him, he now knew she had been deducing him.
Wife is more intelligent academically. Something in science given the slight chemical stains on the cuff of her shirt. clearly a favorite even though she has lost weight and the fit has changed. Chemical is Iodine; assumed because of the colour it has settled to once dried on cotton, recent, perhaps two days old.
“There’s something travelling from the East killing off member’s of our syndicate. Dismantling as it goes. We want you to make this to stop.”
He tries to make it as clear as possible that Sherlock won’t move him on this because John thinks there is a chance he might try. He’s relieved when Sherlock doesn’t, he’s almost relieved when Sherlock freezes but when he sees the panic make another appearance he pulls the man into a fierce embrace.
‘I don’t mean to make it awkward John, you were so good last week and you seemed so happy. I thought you enjoyed it,’ She takes a step back before straightening her jacket. A glance to the clock tells John it’s nearly eleven, both of them needing sleep before having conversations like this. Tired and cranky were not ideal circumstances to find yourself in when trying to talk reasonably.
‘But how does that end up with there being a child, if you’re right and Sherlock didn’t like sex unless he was high? She could have been conceived at any point in that year’
‘Hear me John Watson, you’d be letting those kids down, they loved your story, the school called and deliberately asked if you would be continuing the story this week because they’d love to send more kids the ones who came last week enjoyed it that much, please John, for the children’ it was a low blow and they both knew it,
‘She is a scared and traumatised child. She will need warmth, comfort and safety. She will need love. Just as Sherlock did. I trusted you with the most precious thing in my world once before and you never once failed him or me,' he tries to smile but the pain is too close to the forefront of his mind, 'You are the only person on this planet who can do this John, who can make her the person she could have been if Sherlock had been here, because you, you are the only one who knew him, knew the whole of him. He needed you more than you will ever know, you saved him and now you will save her.’
‘Mycroft it’s hardly her fault, we’re talking about her Granddaughter and there’s a difference between reading something and having it explained to you. I agree that her reaction makes conversation difficult but they’re entirely understandable and there are ways around it. I told her to write me a letter with her questions, I shall write back and she shall have her answers. It seemed to be an elegant solution to the problem.’
Mycroft closed the file in front of him, letting Mitrović take the lead and spreading his arms to indicate he was ready for the man to begin his tale.
Quick warning however this is quite an unpleasant list and if you would prefer not to read it I don't imagine it would spoil the story.
I have to say I have not felt the need to extract that particular box from its hiding place for a long time. Perhaps if you do get this letter you might dispose of it for me; you’ll find a rosewood box with a carved top at the back of my wardrobe. It has a false bottom which slides away from the main body. The small vile within contains a seven percent solution of the finest cocaine I could find in London. There’s enough inside for two hits. I must admit I do still crave the fierce bite of that liquid in my veins after the sting of a metallic needle.
“There were assassins living on Baker Street and neither of you thought to include the police,” Greg stated.
‘Well I suppose they did send Monkey’s into space so we could do worse.’ His attempt at humour leads to Mycroft’s patented “you mere mortals look” but John’s started seeing it as some form of thinly veiled affection so he doesn’t take offence at its appearance.
I don't know how happy I am with this chapter, it feels clunky but it's taken two days and I figure I should publish before I end up editing it all again. Oh well, I hope anyone reading enjoyed.
The brunette smiles brightly at him over her shoulder, John thinks under the right circumstances he may once have tried flirting with her, the idea doesn’t appeal to him presently however,
‘Well what a tool that man is! Honestly dismissing John in such a way, he’ll make a fine father, you will love and nothing some small man says will change that.’ If looks could kill John thinks the one Mrs Hudson is aiming at the ceiling would cause some serious damage to the social worker, ‘And he rifled through so many things, look at this mantelpiece, nothings as it should be, oh I could have smacked him.’
“I mean we’re not heading into London anymore. Something’s happened and Mycroft is having us taken to his house in Northaw.”
There is so much I wanted to experience with you John. I do not remember sober sex and the intoxicated experiences I do are more nightmares than pleasurable material to dwell on. You though John are the creature of my fantasies. You dwell there in my dreams always tempting me into unexplainable pleasure. Manipulating my body in ways I have never experienced. I trust you John. With anything. With everything.
‘Anthea, now’ His colleague aborted her movements instantly and retrieved her blackberry, typing one handed as she holstered her weapon once more.
OH and a final thing! This chapter has an interesting formatting choice. I couldn't decide on the best way to write out text messages so i've gone with indenting but if you, dear reader, think it looks messy I'm happy to reconsider.
“I apologise John, I needed to make sure of Mrs. Hudson’s recollections concerning this man, Sebastian, because it is the opinion of the British secret service that this man has everything to do with Mina.”
But Greg's rose tinted glasses had not blinded him to the fact the man would not be guardian material, his obsessive behaviour with Sherlock had driven his younger brother to the warped relationship he had witnessed the brothers' share. Pushing so hard someone cracks, no Mycroft Holmes was not who this would little girl need, she needed someone warm and kind, quiet and considerate, someone strong enough to hold her above the terrible things she would have been witness and make her better.
Mycroft rose from his chair to ask a hovering member of staff to remove the remnants of their coffee, none of them had touched their deserts and although he dearly wanted to, he thought the reaction may be being caused by emotional distress rather than any great hunger. Chocolate had always formed a large portion of his comfort food routine, being surrounded by such high levels of emotional distress tended to warrant such behaviour reasserting itself but he refused to fall back on all of his bad habits in one evening.
The files on his screen moved near frantically as his assistant scoured the available information for anything relevant. Arrest records, forensic reports, none of it provided a clue to the Detectives reasoning, as much as he would have loved an afternoon in the D.I.'s company he knew it would be unwise for him if he pursued the desire, the Gregory Lestrade was married which left him for all intents and purposes off limits to Mycroft, even after Sherlock's death.
The four of them shared in jokes and stories of travel and work, John sharing stories from his time in the army and his periods of leave spent all over the world, Mycroft had never realised the breadth of the man’s travel experience and wondered why he had continued to travel so far afield when it was clear to everyone how dearly he loved England,  his Father spinning tales of espionage and betrayal within the botany world, Mycroft knew the stories and knew their details were not as lurid as Siger was painting them but John appeared rapt on every detail while seeming to equally enjoy his mothers grandiose retellings of the devious nature of French scientists.
‘Yes he’s sat opposite me right this second, look, just, please.’ The note of desperation in Gregory's voice was the deciding moment for him, he may not have been a slave to sentiment like so many others but he owed these men a debt, his family did at least, and he would be damned if he failed to come through for them.
‘I know, I’m so sorry Greg, really, this is just awful.’ Definitely a cigarette John thinks as he listens to the quiet noises of his friend drawing the smoke into his lungs. He fights back his inner doctor who’s screaming at him for not nagging Greg about quitting again but he thinks that if ever the man was allowed a cigarette the death of one of his closest protégés was likely to be one. ‘What even happened Greg? The bloody tabloid rags were talking about a raid gone wrong. They’re spouting some nonsense about your division kicking you out.’
John could see it; the idea haunted his dreams. His own tearstained face asking for her to be returned, shots of Sherlock being shown alongside some smiling picture of Mina. It was his worst nightmare, worse than the war or watching Sherlock jump. Someone taking her from him and him being powerless to stop them; being taken unaware and drugged while Mina was torn out of the safe bubble of 221b, but something was missing from the image. He felt overwhelmingly sick but not panicked as he did in his dreams because he was stood in one of the most secure locations in the Kingdom and his daughter was sleeping safely surrounded by people, a whole house of people that would kill anyone who made a move against her.
Greg shook his arm loose from her hold. He dragged the last of his suitcases from its place next to the stairs. Anything else he gave two shits about was already packed in the boot of his car. It had taken him a distressingly short time to bring together all of his belongings but it had felt cathartic to remove them from the room he had once shared with his wife, cathartic to know he was actually leaving her this time and that it would be for good.
Greg, who had been missing for most of these developments, was watching John and Mycroft with calculating eyes.
‘My mother came to this country having spent her life  as a French academic, for two decades her life had revolved around physics and the brilliance of science. Upon arriving in England, already married and pregnant, she was faced with the stifling customs of the upper classes and a family ingrained with the importance of social standing. My father you see followed his love for the study Botany to Lille, where they met and to my mother's recollections at least my father seduced her away from her love of science with passion and rare flowers, I have to admit that at this point I normally chose to exit the room, but the story of my father’s aunt is closely related, she lived in a cottage just down the road from the main portion of our estate in Yorkshire, a place my parents were encouraged to stay by my grandparents, my mother grew fond of walking the distance in order to escape the controls of that house.' Mycroft shook his head at the memory, perhaps he to was seeing the similarities in the woman he described and Sherlock, 'My great aunt welcomed her with love and an eccentricity my mother has always claimed made her seem more French. She would bake for her, tell her tales of her travels and foreign lovers of youth and for those few months my mother had a sanctuary. However Six months into her pregnancy my mother was placed on bedrest and trips to her little hideaway were forced to come to an end, that is until said Great aunt commanded my father bring her and a box with her one afternoon to visit. Upon being left alone with my mother she revealed that the box contained all the equipment my mother would need to conduct minor experiments while confined to her bed and a telescope so she would watch the stars from the window box in their room. My mother never forgot her kindness. She died when I was young, only five years old but she was a wonderful woman Aunt Mina; I know my mother still misses her a great deal.’
Lonely enough that when three weeks ago Tammy had popped over to drop something off he’d ordered from the store and discovered she’d never seen any of the James Bond series he’d invited her to stay and watch the rest of the movie he’d been watching. The rest of the movie turned into a three movie marathon, Indian food and Tammy falling asleep flopped on the sofa, she’d woken up disorientated at four in the morning and wandered into John’s room thinking in her sleep fuelled haze that it was her room; the resulting shouts of shock from both Tammy and John had woken Mina and led to a rather awkward conversation with Mrs Hudson in the morning when she gave him a pointed look and told him he should keep it down in future.
“Given that none of us are dead it’s safe to assume there was more to it than that,” Greg said, seemingly unaffected by the idea of international criminals focusing on him. “Some sort of trigger that would make them act?”
‘Sherlock was always a tall child, I have wondered if she might be younger than anticipated, my guess is that once our good doctor gets a solid look at her we will know for certain. But until then by my reckoning she is under two.’
“I don’t want a rise out of you, Mr Holmes, I want you to listen to my story and I want you to listen to it my way. Just like your brother listened to his, he did listen so well sometimes, Mr Holmes. Moriarty was awfully complimentary when your brother played along.”
‘From Mycroft, lord no, it was star’ Siger grins at the memory, ‘it was summer and Violet, she developed this habit of bundling Mycroft out of bed when he woke up the second time, always at one A.M. and taking him out onto the balcony attached to our room. She’d sing him the names of the constellations in French. I think she was slightly disappointed you went for the English Myc, would have profferedétoile, all things considered.’ ‘My second word was French; I imagine it pacified her somewhat.’ Siger bobs his head in response. ‘Now his lordship, Sherlock, he caused some mischief. Didn’t speak in front of anyone until he was two, we would hear him sometimes talking to his bear or his puppy but whenever we would try, nothing. His first word to us, unsurprisingly, was no.’ It’s John’s turn to snort now, it’s so Sherlock he can hardly stand it,
Do you still wish that John? Do you still wish for me to return. I had hoped that perhaps by Christmas I would be able to contact you. That enough time would have passed and the lens that was upon you would have shifted but I know it has not. You are still in so much danger John. I fear for you more than myself most days. My surveillance, such as it is, is lacking in technology but I have over heard conversations and intercepted communications that relate to the continued monitoring of yourself, Lestrade and now my Brother. Their interest in Mycroft grows everyday that he is seen to be responsible for my actions. I have realized that they have placed the blame upon him for the disruption in their enterprise and I fear I am grateful for this John. I think it may prove useful to me in this instance for as much as I worry for my brother's safety the longer I can keep the attention away from myself, the longer I can move within the shadows of these organisations, the more likely It is that I will finish them and be able to return home to you.
There were many things Sherlock didn’t care about. Murder between adults, fraud, theft but he had never been able to stomach abuse, cruelty was not in his nature no matter what anyone said.  John knew that. So how could have a child that had existed in such a place and experienced things that made John's stomach turn. Could it be possible he didn’t know though. Could he have fathered a child and never realised.  God he might have, she’d been found in a drug den, if the mother had been a user, she could have met Sherlock on the streets, any number of ways, could have had a child and never found him. He’d become famous though, he’d become a national treasure for a short period, ‘the detective with a funny hat’, his picture was everywhere. Surely the mother would have come forwards then. Surely. He was about to make this point when he looked once more at the picture. The girl was small, inky black curls framing her face, eyes too big for her face looked straight at the camera, the precise shade and shape he remembered Sherlock’s being. He could see it now.He'd been staring at this picture for so long but he hadn't really seen it till now,
“I was already a target, Mycroft, and I would be even if I didn’t love you.” Mycroft drew in a sharp breath at that. “We probably shouldn’t be having this conversation with an audience, Myc.”
You always take the decision from me John, tilting my head up and meeting my eyes. You move forward as I do and our lips meet. It is slow to begin with, a gentle thing, the pair of us uncertain and surprised by the others participation. You draw back and realize I do not move away. You look in my eyes and finally see the depths of those feelings I have for you. That is the moment you smile. You smile at me and I smile back. You pull me on top of you, my narrow hips fitting within the cradle of your legs. I lay there shocked as I feel your erection beneath my own. You grin this time, that way you do when you catch me unawares and I can not have that John. So I rush forward crashing my lips against yours. My hands grab you, clench you to me, because now that I have you John I will not be letting go. I want you to be mine John just as I am yours. I want to hold your heart in my hand and know that you trust me not to break it.
The following chapters were divided into two because of their length, the first is John centric to second follows Greg. MJ.
Gregory was a very good man, Mycroft would admit to an attraction, he struck him as clever, witty and charming, his devilish smile had stroked Mycroft’s ego many times. He had yet to discover if the attraction was mutual but all his evidence suggested it was, their shared body language, conversation topics and light flirtation had been occurring for years and Mycroft liked to believe it had never progressed because of a mutual respect for the others position and their shared morality.
“Sweetie, don’t pull Uncle Greg’s hair like that, it’s not nice.” He forced himself not to smile at the devilish grin he got in response.
John scattered kisses across Mina’s head, losing himself for a moment in her steady breaths and the feel of her safe in his arms.
They walked in companionable silence for a number of minutes; listening lightly to Mina’s intermittent commentary about the plants she clearly found the most interesting. John kept her out of reach of any low branches and flowers but was more than happy to kneel for ten minutes with Mina resting against his chest to watch the miniature water feature. The continued along the path, flanked as they were by two members of their security detail; once word of the photographer’s presence had spread between the three adults walking the gardens they’d consented to a more obvious security presence. Mina seemed unaffected and, dressed as they were, the security team blended almost perfectly with the small swell of tourists enjoying the winter exhibits.
So yes I hope you're all well and happy. It's not been so long this time which is a bit of a celebration for me but this chapter is shorter so maybe that makes sense. I hope you all like it.
“Ah, I should have made myself clearer. The house is currently empty. I am staying at the property you visited previously for the duration of my parents’ stay. I can arrange for a member of my staff to come and open the property but apart from that, and the cleaner that comes three times a week, the house would be yours for at least a week. Would you please consider it? I believe you would be more comfortable than at a hotel.”
“Yes, I suppose I did but I only asked because I didn’t like the things being around. So many of the lads were addicts. I just thought it was so much temptation for them.”
Tammy raises an eyebrow at him before ducking under the counter, there’s the sound of rustling bags before she reappears ‘You think that’s cool, think fast’ she tosses a grey ball at him, John catches it one handed happy with the maintenance of his reflexes and realises it’s a cuddly Death Star,
Now Mycroft looked truly uncomfortable. He went back to the table shuffling the photographs back inside just to replace them with new ones. Each photograph contained a profile shot of a different individual. Three men and one woman; John recognised one of the men but he couldn’t place a finger on where from. Mrs. Hudson was studying the same photograph with a great deal of concentration, tapping a finger gently against her lips as one would do with a pen.
‘We needed to find her mother, or someone, anyone really, needed to know if she belonged to any of the men or women we'd arrested.' Greg moved to reassure him when John's head shot up at the statement, Greg sees the slight panic and hopes that means he's finally getting through to his friend again, 'She didn't, but her DNA did flag up a report, Sherlock’s report and nothing else, no indication of a mother, just him, half his.I think you can see it if you look at her eyes, I guess you can't see them clearly on that, but, take it from me, they're just like his, and maybe other bits too, like her face a bit, her cheeks maybe, her hair certainly, but her eyes are what shows it the most’ Greg looked down at the image over John’s shoulder. The younger man seemed to have damaged the edges with his grip, but overall, John didn't react half as badly as Greg had envisioned. Ideas of punches flying and screaming fits had filled his mind, yet another performance piece put on in his office, before he had considered that those reactions had been more relatable to Sherlock than to John.
The mini jam pots are forgotten about and used in their entirety during John's lazy day breakfast's. Sherlock smiles every time he sees them on the table.Tiny cotton squares folded and kept carefully next to a paper bee.
‘Mina, we will have to make a list,’ his declaration was met by a toothy grin and the piece of toast joining the mess on the floor. ‘Mrs Hudson will not thank me if I don’t clean up after us so you’re going to have to sit in the lounge and play for a few minutes little lady, then we will make our list and head out into the world.’  The text he’d received from Anthea, when her contact had been added to his phone he had no idea, said the pushchair would be arriving at 8:30, it was now just after eight and John reckoned once he’d cleaned the kitchen some they’d be ready to go. Apart from her hands Mina had proved herself to be quite a clean eater, holding the spoon seemed to fascinate her but she was more than happy to eat porridge from her fingers and as long as she was eating John thought he could teach table manners later.
‘Yeah I’m ok, I was worried though and those men whisked you off and all the other ones would tell us was that you were going to a friend who would look after you. Where the hell are you? Do I need to come rescue you?’
“That’s quite distressing Mycroft,” Mrs. Hudson said, having been silent for most of the conversation. All of the men seemed to have forgotten she was present. “That you don’t know who’s carrying out these attacks, I mean.”
“One day the Knight had a very bad dream and he took himself to the gardens early. He walked along the same path lost in his thoughts until an old friend called his name.
He hears Mrs Hudson’s voice trying to coax more words out of Mina, who laughs in return; she’d hidden her face in John’s neck then, hiding from the camera,
That was the moment he’d thrown his first punch, he had missed connecting with his face because Mycroft had quicker reflexes than anyone would have imagined. He’d not seen him since and yet here he stood, witnessing John’s anger once again but this time not directed at him, directed instead at the wide eyed, silver haired police officer he’d once so admired.
‘Sure thanks’, he’d just turned towards the bedroom once more when he noticed Mrs Hudson on her hands and knees scrubbing the bathtub. Tears streaked her face and she was scrubbing with such ferocity John was sure the old bath would end up with dents. Moving to her side he said her name quietly, watching as the older woman exhaled deeply and turned to him. Her eyes were bloodshot but there was a faint smile upon her face.
“John told me about your wife. He’s awfully worried about you and I can’t say I blame him. All those horrible things in the papers, Detective Inspector, I don’t mind telling you it was rather distressing to read.”
‘Rare flowers, especially beautiful ones such as these, can sell for thousands of pounds.’ At John’s continued looks of shock and doubt, the man explains in terms of supply and demand, some of the Orchids in this room are one of ten examples held around the world and some others are unique; John understands this point to some degree but the idea of ever becoming so enamoured with the plants to spend so much money on a single one strikes him as ludicrous. There’s a knock on the glass door back where they started their tour. The brunette from early, John remembers she said to call her Holly, stepped quickly into the room before closing the door behind her.
‘John is there?’ He owed the man; he had once again been dragged into a farce of a situation. John Watson deserved some peace at least.
He thinks it is highly likely he will throw up all over Sherlock’s wonderfully tight ivy green shirt if the man continued his attempts to drag him to his feet. Something about the jolting movements and the flush of arousal coursing through John’s system with Sherlock pressing up against him in the manner he was mad John’s stomach feel akin to a washing machine on spin cycle.
‘It’s called a slumber bee, it’s actually a speaker as well you can connect devices to it and play lullabies straight into the crib. It attaches to the side of the bars,’ she shows him the back where Velcro straps tighten depending on the style of crib.
‘Of course she was upset John, She is whenever you leave but you both have to get used to it. She’s perfectly fine just tiered, I’ll tell you what I’ll check on her in thirty minutes and check her forehead, if she feels even a little hot I’ll call, but until then shouldn’t you be socialising. I hope you’re making a good impression John Watson.’
‘I fear you may have been made to think of our parents as something abnormal or perhaps neglectful, I will not blame you for that and certainly my mother is occasionally challenging but in the case of my father, he has always been a most attentive parent, both for myself and Sherlock, they spoke every week on the phone you know?’
One may wonder why Mycroft Holmes had never considered this eventuality, well in all honesty because his brother was gay. He had always been gay. He had always excelled at keeping secrets, but this was never one Sherlock had needed too, with the added experience of performing on stage his brother had adopted the moniker;
There food arrives and they eat in relative awkwardness, at least he got it out of the way Greg thinks, he’s always liked the chicken Caesar salad here, the chef always puts minimal dressing on Greg’s with a small amount on the side so he can add as his mood prefers, he wonders if they serve Caesar salad in Italy or if it’s just another bastardisation that the British or American’s came up with, whoever it was it’s highly tasty.
So how do I handle a man that seems to embody a number of personality traits I myself had once found desirable. Perhaps that is the trick with this John. Perhaps I should look to what would have destroyed or damaged me in those days. He seems to take issue with losing John; his behaviour with his cohorts during our journey seems to blatantly highlight his most traditionally masculine traits. He is not the tallest of men John and clearly he is not the most academic. He hides his regional accent well but it is still present in the more casual utterances in his speech.
‘Oh no, that’s just the night light section, Tammy clears her throat before returning her eyes to John with a smile, ‘you wanna see?’
‘Now, now little miss we must teach you some new words. Your poor Daddy will develop a complex if not,’ Mrs. Hudson said  Mina just cast their landlady a glance before returning her attention to her already ruined breakfast.
Siger had gone to inform the staff of the changed number to their party while John volunteered to go in search of Mycroft, Siger had seemed reluctant to John’s suggestion but acquiesce when John promised not to disturb him if he found him working. But Sherlock’s brother didn’t appear to be working, if John didn’t know the man better he would have said he was daydreaming.
‘You know I’m pretty sure I told you to knock if you came over after seven’ Tammy silently raised her eyebrows at John before shaking the take out bag at him, he swiped at it while stifling a grin, Mina hadn’t woken up so he supposed he’d forgive his new friend her mistake.
He notes Mycroft scanning his face, his movements with those deeply coloured eyes and makes a conscious effort not to hide any of his feelings, allowing the man to deduce everything he wants to do to him in this moment, he’s at war with himself, wanting more than anything to simply say, fuck it and pull Mycroft over him, feel the heavy press of the man’s body on top of him, experience the biting kisses as well as the soft, give himself over to the fantasies he’s been repressing for years. But they’re both currently fuelled by guilt, grief and lust, he worries moving forward now would be something they’d come to regret later and he doesn’t want that. Greg knows he’s been holding himself back for years and if Mycroft’s words are true it’s been much the same for him, he’s been patient and he’ll be able to continue for as long as he needs to for this to be right. He chooses to stay on his knees but brings both his hands to hold Mycroft’s, it’s still a comfort but less inherently sexual.
The memory of his grief hit him so hard in that moment he had to hang up the phone, forcing it into it's cradle with more force than was truly necessary, he bent double having to pull in deep breaths of air just to stave off the overwhelming feelings of nausea sweeping his body. This farce could not be real, this child, whatever it was, it was a trick and yet he failed at repressing the smallest slither of hope. The desperation not to have lost his brother compleatly, but it could not be, he knew that this was something else, something dangerous. ‘Anthea!’ the volume of his voice surprised him, the high notes of panic and potentially feelings of shock more so.
“Gregory, I am going to suggest something and I want you to give it a little thought. It’s only an offer and there are no expectations, you understand.” Greg nodded before realising Mycroft couldn’t really see him and verbally confirmed his assent instead. “What I am wondering is, well, the option is available.”
Mycroft and Sherlock made a deal. Mycroft would always help Sherlock and Sherlock would always be honest and clear.
I will find a way John. Believe me when I tell you I will not stop fighting no matter how impossible the target.
“I am here on a mixture of business and pleasure. Business being activities which produce my income and pleasure being whatever I can have your countries pretty little bitches do for me.”
“Would you like to know what we’re going to talk about Mr Holmes?” He said it quietly, as if to suggest what came next was some great secret. Mitrović was intelligent and experienced enough to know that every word spoken was being recorded.
‘From the research I have done and from the doctors that have been consulted the treatment revolves around providing love and safety, making sure to provide comfort when she reacts in a specific way as well as learning her triggers,’
‘Well you’ve been under for three hours, nearly a record for you.’ John risks raising his middle finger to the man, the bark of laughter informs him he’s not crossed a line. They’re good friends, having already served four tours together, Sholto may be his commanding officer but he’s his friend as well, Brothers at arms.
“Gregory, it is no imposition. If I could insist then I would but I know that’s not my place.” Mycroft’s voice held a hint of the longing Greg was forcing himself not to acknowledge. “I would be honoured if you used the property. I find myself quite fond of the image it creates in my mind.” Greg felt himself blush slightly.
The walk from the sofa to the kitchen had become an obstacle course of building blocks, cuddly toys and most noticeably an antique rocking horse Mycroft had bought the evening of Mina’s third day at 221b, ‘The creature’  as John liked to call it was hand carved with a softened leather saddle and hair which had seemed so real John had been forced to ask Mycroft if it was, the man had treated him to a Mycroft patented look of disdain (John couldn’t say he’d missed them) before reassuring him that the hair was made out of woven strands of fine silk, they’d been tied together at the back in a braid and Mycroft had taken great delight in telling Mina the exact bread and temperament of the horse it was modelled after. It transpired that both rocking horses and horse training were large parts of growing up a Holmes, John had wondered what Sherlock had thought of the, in John’s opinion, aristocratic tradition, when Mycroft had promised to buy Mina a horse when she was old enough John had felt the need to input that she’d only need a horse if she took up horse riding which was in no way a given, Mycroft had raised an eyebrow at this before being distracted by Mina’s babbling while she stroked the main of the horse. John had to admit she’d been taken with it, he’d found her today clinging the table so she could load her Ewok toy on the horses saddle without falling over.
“That may be the case John but there’s going to be a good reason for that. I trust Mycroft and if he has told Francis that he’s not allowed to tell us, well then that’s the end of that in my opinion and Gregory sweetheart I understand that you’re frustrated, I don’t pretend to understand why or how the information you just found out affects you, but if Mycroft is behind it there’s a good reason. Trust him.” Mrs. Hudson reasoned.
“Alright, this might be a little awkward but I don’t really know anyone else that talking about this subject with would be alright with so just bear with me okay?” Greg said.
‘I’m thinking we should wake her up and do introductions, I’ll stay for a little while, help you get her settled and then we’ll see how you do on your own, Dad.’ The smile on her face is genuine and he feels himself return it. The news that’s waiting for him in the manila folders she bought might dampen this moment and he doesn’t want that. He wants to meet her for the first time just seeing her and not all the terrible things that might drive him to revenge.
‘Oh thank God Greg are you okay?’ it’s Sally and she sounds stressed, there’s a noise in the background that he thinks might be a television,
‘Yes Mrs Hudson,’ he moves to great her and quickly helps by removing the majority of the boxes she has resting in her arms, he lifts the security lock on the baby gate to allow her access to the main living space, ‘watch your step Mrs Hudson, Mina would appear to have built a small maze of obstacles for our collective enjoyment’ he’s found it easier to get along with the woman since Sherlock’s death. She found him once when he visited Sherlock’s grave, she’d come to change the flowers, he later found out she did this every Sunday, he’d been sitting staring at the black headstone and cursing his own stupidity. He’d watched Sherlock near constantly threw the years of his addiction but once he removed himself from the world, once he moved in to 221b, once he found John, he’d begun to worry about his wellbeing less. He’d watched just as closely on occasion but the majority of the time he’d taken a step back. He received two, instead of four, security briefings a day and removed Sherlock’s security team altogether after the third time Dr Watson accosted his brother would be attacker before the team had even mobilised. She’d joined him in his contemplation, laying a hand on the one he had clenched on his knee, they didn’t speak but every Sunday since they met there, shared stories they had of the periods of Sherlock’s life they’d both known well. When he’d offered to pay her for the upkeep of 221b for the foreseeable future the older woman had smiled softly at him and said it was his for as long as he needed.
