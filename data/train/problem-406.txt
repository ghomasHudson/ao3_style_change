“After my Fall, I learned that it was no accident that these cases came to my attention. It galls me to admit that I did not recognize the pattern in the moment. But in truth, nearly every case you and I handled in our first year together was...”
Sherlock is inches from him now, shaking with his fury. Mycroft stands perfectly still, watching him as if he were a very rare, dangerous specimen. Sherlock takes a ragged breath and roars into his face.
He shivers in his wet clothes and with a huff, decides it’s time to stand. His stiff muscles protest as he pulls himself to his feet and starts to stumble, but he’s suddenly caught by firm hands. Sherlock whirls, agents and spies filling his imagination, but it’s an even more shocking sight to behold beneath the trees.
“It does indeed, young man." Her smile crinkled around her grey eyes. “I’ve not met a halfblood ability quite like yours before, and I have seen countless variables over the years.”
you are! My word, it’s been driving me half mad watching you two dance about one another all these years.”
With a knowing nod, she squeezes John’s hand, gathers up the empty dishes scattered on the workbench and bustles out, but not without a healthy wink at John.
The sound of the gunshot takes heartbeats to reach his brain, the whole room slowing down as he turns and finds Sherlock stumbling backward, the bloom of red at his shirtfront so small, barely larger than the red buttonhole of his coat, and though some part of him demands he keep his weapon trained on Mary, most of his mind is screaming
Sherrinford smiles at him gently between the messy array of glass apparatus, lighting a Bunsen burner, pipette in hand. Sherlock stares down at their heap of notes, the equations stirring on the page as he imagines their chemical reactions instead of meeting his brother’s eyes.
The silence stretches out. Shivering, aching as warmth begins to spread through his limbs, John feels a twist of panic. He’s misread everything. He’s a right idiot, spoiled it all, just when they were beginning to find their rhythm again.
“It’s alright, Sherlock,” John breathes, resigned, the fire extinguishing. “I get it. A bit of thrill, a good dose of The Work. I’ve missed it, too. I was honestly excited to visit a place you remember so fondly. It just... brings back... things.”
“I could not prevent the trigger they placed in him. It was only a matter of time. I gave you the summer and kept you as safe as I could – there was certainly no stopping you. After his return home, I had hoped his advanced illness, obviously imposed by the Collective, would keep you out of harm’s way. Be grateful you had the time with him that you did.”
“Your patron,” she smirks, but no humor touches her eyes. An alarm goes off in his lower mammalian brain that would usually signal a predator. He takes a step back.
I know you won’t like this, but–” John’s fierce demeanor suddenly cracks and he crosses his arms, chuckling and blushing. “Really, there is absolutely no way I am going to be able to talk to you seriously like that.”
The copter dipped again and Lestrade clutched his stomach miserably as the surgeon’s final words rang through his memory.
The neighborhood is quiet. Kids have been called inside, televisions flicker through windows, someone’s barbeque is cooling on a porch, still smelling of charred steak. Crickets chirp and a dog carries on a few blocks away. Nothing at all seems out of the ordinary. You can’t tell at all that at least twenty highly-skilled and very armed operatives wait for the signal if John’s little plan fails. That was Mycroft’s contingency, of course.
Mycroft sniffs. “The greatest minds in modern medicine have yet to crack this code. What on earth makes you think a fifteen-year-old can do it? You’re simply in denial brought on by shock.”
those memories. As part of my punishment.” Sherlock turned away and appeared to become engrossed in the foggy silhouette of the City of Steam.
Sherlock took the envelope carefully, feeling a thrill at being challenged and knowing a fair portion of his eagerness was the chance to show off in front of John. He studiously ignored him, focusing on the letter.
“Do come in, John!” Her merry voice sounded strangely far away. “Lune will show you the way! Help yourself to a biscuit!” John swallowed nervously and pushed into the flat, finding it warm and comfortable, smelling of cinnamon.
“I had been Brook’s choice, and I played my role, but I was not exactly a model Moriarty. I ferreted out enough of the cancer to restore the balance largely in favor of benevolence. They want a Mycroft these days, they don’t want me. I was given back my life.”
For ten years, John had hidden in plain sight among the Wall Guard, the least likely of havens for a secret supporter of the Faerie. He’d managed to learn so much, but he was still far from his dream – to cross the Wall, to meet true Faerie… and find the
“Good thinking, that.” He plunges his stiff hands to the well floor, the slime of algae making him shudder. In this position, the water reaches his throat. He strains to keep his face above it.
Thinking suddenly of a trick he’d once seen at a circus, Johnny wriggled out of the sweater, tumbling painfully into the leaf duff and rotten apples. He stood, wincing, and brushed pulp and bits of lichen from his clothes. His hands were shaking. Johnny retrieved his traitorous boot from the weeds and looked up at the thick grey sweater hanging in the high branches. He sighed wearily. He only had the one. His mum would be furious if he lost it
Sherlock scrubs at his hair with irritation, but John rests a gentle, hesitant hand on the nape of his neck, stilling him. With a shudder, Sherlock breathes.
"If I don’t do it now, it’ll soon be over my head anyway.” He pulls in a sharp breath, squeezes his eyes shut, and plunges under the surface.
The idea of you, or our child, being manipulated in some criminal game… I will not risk it. Never again.”
“Right, Sparks, we’ll get up,” John addressed the fiery creature, standing with a groan and pulling Sherlock to his feet. “But look,
it was entirely Sherlock. “William’s attention to detail is marvelous – your brows are thick as caterpillars! And your hair is jet black, did you know? Not a trace of silver.”
Sherlock feels the color in his own cheeks and slides his hands under the table to grip John’s thighs, making him inhale sharply.
John’s face relaxed gratefully and a tumble of thoughts filled Sherlock’s mind – words, images, a waterfall of information. Sherlock gasped and braced himself against the tall, lichen-spotted stone.
After class, the schoolyard had buzzed with the news. Johnny had pushed through the crowd of whispering children and run, as far and fast as his feet could take him, trying to outrun the tangled knot in his chest.
"Of course," he says earnestly, then chuckles. "I think we'd inevitably end up there anyway, but it's nice to be officially invited to your bedroom.”
“Deconstructing them tested even my considerable mental abilities – I had setbacks. There was also the corruption to unravel. The destruction of Jim Brook’s time will be felt for generations, I fear. Many machines have been set in motion that they will struggle to correct for decades to come.”
He feels a subtle spasm of muscle under his arms, a quick intake of breath. With a pulse of mortification, Sherlock realizes it’s too late. He tries to squirm away, but John’s hand moves with surprising speed, gripping Sherlock’s forearm, holding him in place. He can’t breathe..
Some of the 2017 readers had subscribed for future content, so it made sense to post new chapters to the existing A03 post. The story hasn't changed, but the much bigger Iron Collar needed a prologue! And the original ch1 grew into 2 chapters! But I couldn't find a way to move around chapters and keep their comments attached. Thanks for understanding! <3
He pulls back from their embrace, kisses John quickly on the mouth, then darts from the bathroom, towel forgotten.
When he returns, mugs of hot tea in hand, he grins to find John gently swaying at the window with the baby in his arms, singing in his soft tenor,
“Now look at this.” Sherlock holds up the autopsy photo for John and offers him the lens, which he takes with interest.
Sherlock bolts across the parking garage toward the suspiciously idling black car. Wrenching open the car door, he is surprised to find Mycroft inside.
“Thank you.” He tugs on the clothes while John moves all evidence to the hamper, unlocking the bedroom door as he walks past. Sherlock rolls over with a deep yawn. “Lie in a bit tomorrow. I’ll handle breakfast and Her Highness’ whims. Maybe go to the park, collect bugs.”
“Then I have you to thank for keeping my memory intact when the new serums crossed in my system,” he says, smiling gently. He holds her at arm’s length and looks at her seriously. “Thank you,” he says quietly. “Thank you so much for... helping him. So many times. When I couldn’t.” He hugs her again. “You have saved us.”
for him. Covered him in a cocoon of leaves. Sherlock had felt genuinely safe for the first time in years, and he must have slept, because John had woken him, frantic, his thoughts screaming into Sherlock’s mind:
As their hands clasped, a snapping arc of purple energy crackled vividly between their skin, both of them inhaling sharply. A pulse of John’s tangled fondness bloomed in Sherlock’s mind as his own surged outward. For a stunned moment, they clung to one another’s hand.
“No key, looked,” John murmurs against his shoulder. Now that he has something to rest on, the weariness has flooded him and he lets his eyes slide closed. “Don’t s’pose you brought your lock pick.” He is surprised to feel Sherlock’s chuckle deep in his chest, rumbling against his own.
“And what’s wrong with that? You’re an excellent doctor.” The lift dings, the doors slide open, and they hastily move their argument inside its private confines
“I’ll run to the shops tomorrow, there won’t be a drop of food in the flat. We can get takeaway tonight.”
“John… steady.” He feels ready to lunge, to strike, but Sherlock is at his side. When did he get there? Mary watches them, sipping her tea, bemused. His hand on John’s elbow is very firm as he speaks in a low tone. “I realize this is a horror for you.” He mumbles very quietly, “We do this together, now.”
He is baffled by this fierce, protective affection. What should he do? From somewhere in his mind palace Molly shouts,
Once approved for entry, he had met his guide – a lean, grim surgeon in a long black work coat. Lestrade had tried not to stare at the four fingers of the man’s right hand which had been replaced by intricate silver instruments necessary for his work. Like all of the scientists Lestrade saw that day, the man was clad simply in black, but his senior status – a golden gear hung from a purple ribbon – shone on his chest.
He nods absently, drifting to the curb, eyes on the ambulance. Behind him a very fit man and woman in dark clothes exit the flat, nod to Mycroft, and disappear into the black car. Mycroft passes his umbrella to Molly, then stands shoulder to shoulder with Sherlock in the drizzle watching the approaching ambulance.
His actions seem to influence the nightmare, now blending the horrors of John’s past with the trauma of the day.
Sherlock’s stare slid away from John’s face. With a sharp exhale through his nostrils, he nodded curtly.
A cloud passes over the sun and he shivers. His body needs him again, bloody nuisance. He plods through the silent crowd of creatures toward the tall, thick hedge enclosing the garden and slips through a wrought-iron gate, bracing himself.
“Oh, honestly Sherlock,” John waves his hand to brush aside the compliments. “We’re all just making it up as we go. You’re brilliant with her. Truly, I’ve been astonished at this side of you – before we know it, you’ll be carting her off to toddler taekwando, have her fluent in six languages, and blowing up things in the kitchen.”
Warily, he eases her down onto the carpet and takes a step back as if from a subdued tiger he expects could wake at any moment. She looks like she’s just dozed off. John prods her with the toe of his shoe. No response. He does not envy her the headache she’ll have when she wakes in custody thirty minutes from now.
, which he began reading aloud that morning. Bending over, he gently slides his arm under John’s back and shifts him up onto several pillows, then scoots next to him on the bed, sitting close so he can support John’s head. After several small feedings each day, he’s gotten quite good at this.
Sherlock thinks I made to get us here.” John described the flickering water sources he’d seen above the burning forest, then their leap away from the Netters in a dead-end alley of the Cloud District.
Magnusson lies in a crumpled heap on the floor, a bloody cut on his forehead. Sherlock, his hands raised, glances at John. He does not look the least bit surprised to see him, only sad. Terribly sad. In two steps John has placed himself in front of Sherlock, blocking him from Mary-no-
“Third: you were infected with a deadly virus. You only had the first symptoms, the fever and malaise. We were able to administer the antidote through your morning tea before the paralysis kicked in and ceased your breathing.”
Sherlock's head spun. His mind was having a short circuit and it went blissfully blank. He felt the soft but sturdy lips pressing against his own. It was not as he had expected. He had thought that if it would ever happen,(or rather, imagined it) it would be hard and rough. But John's touch was soft but pressing, his mouth opening a bit to get Sherlock's lower lip between his own, softly sucking it and releasing it again. Sherlock felt the tip of John's tongue brushing against his lips, and he invitingly opened his mouth. He felt John's tongue slowly licking his lower lip again before carefully exploring Sherlock's mouth. When their tongues met each other, they both let out a soft moan. Their tongues circled each other and played for a moment before Sherlock's mind was starting back up.
Sherlock was already heading towards the mentioned hatch, and put in his whole pack minus one and a lighter. He studied the small space.
"Yes John. That was the best I could think off to get us both in the class at the same time. If we pretended not to know each other, we couldn't talk together, could we? Can't you see that it's quite brilliant? And besides, you might be to old to act like an eighteen year old, like you said, but your definitely to young to act as my father."
"I apologise for the cold again. When you get to chilly, just say it. We can take a break then, so you can warm yourself up."
When he was behind the shorter man, he softly leaned against him, unable to wrap him in his arms without falling over.
David held the door for John and he had no choice than to pass the man on his way out. He could just feel the eyes of the man behind him burning in his back. Great. Now he had to handle that too. John opened the door of the classroom where the others had already started again. Sherlock was sitting with his back towards him, so he didn't see John coming in with David. John hurried himself to his desk, and turned around his sketch again.
"But I'm feeling much better. Have you got any idea how boring it is in here? You can at least go home and sleep in your own bed."
John made the decision to get some take away after he brought back the rental and before he went home, and by the state of Sherlock's skin tone it was a good thing that he did.
Together they walked out of the classroom, out of the school and Sherlock flagged down a cab and got in to get them to Bakerstreet. Neither of them said a word.
He got out on Blenheim Grove, looking around for the drug den Angie had told him about. This wasn't the best place in London to wander on your own, and John was glad he had his gun on him. He saw some crackheads going into a building on his left, and he decided to follow them inside.
"That was four months and six days after we've met. And it was the fourth time since we've met. It was a superb seven percent solution. But I didn't really enjoy it. Couldn't stop feeling guilty about it. Anahita opened my eyes that day."
Sherlock tried to open his eyes and sit up. His body spasmed directly, the pain intense. The pink colour stayed, but there were black spots coming back in his eyesight. His whole body was on fire again.
"Two of them were useless, but it seems that we managed to make something that shuts them off for a few hours."
"Not much. They saw person one getting out of the pub at St. Martin's lane tonight with a broken nose. Got hit by someone. Small bloke, blond. That's all I know."
The look John gave him was something in between the 'Fuck you and do as I say' Captain Watson look and the 'trust me; I know what I'm saying’ Doctor Watson look.
They both got to work. Sherlock was deleting everything from the computers he could reach from his own, while Ava went down to give Beth her lethal dose of sedative. Then she started to gather every sample she had down there. They were linked to each other through the connection the whole time.
"If you had been really gone. I promised myself to never live through that again, facing the world without you. I would have shot myself."
" Your work, It's mind blowing. I would love to see more of it. If you feel like it, of course. If you have more like this, we can even make an exposition of them. I know several galleries that would be happy to provide the space for art like this."
They were back home again. Sherlock had dressed himself in his favorite pajama bottoms and dressing gown, and was seated in his chair in front of the hearth, while John had taken his shoes off and was walking around barefooted.
The young man that had talked to me went back with me to the crack house, and offered me some of his stash. He didn't call himself Sherlock at that time, and he definitely didn't look like the posh boy he actually is. Although you could hear it in his speech, definitely upper class. From that time on we became pals, and we both lived in that house for a few weeks together. He talked about helping out the police whenever he was clean, and I told him about my dreams for the future.
This must have been one of his fellow soldiers in Afghanistan. The man looked at ease, just enjoying the sight in front of him, probably looking to something pretty in the dessert or something.
"Don't be scared, John. Your secret is safe with me. Although our Pretty boy is to dumb to see it, it doesn't say that we all are. I know you're in love with him. You know I'm falling for him, but I'm going to be dead within a few hours. So you don't have to worry about that."
I hope I managed to give you peace, the opportunity to built yourself a life without me. I like to think about the life you are making for yourself right now, but I have to say that I am also scared for it. I always thought that I would come back to London, to you, and it frightens me to think that you don't need me anymore in your new and carefully build life. That whatever you have found for yourself is enough, that there is no place anymore in it for me. It would break me. But it seems like I am not coming back after all, so I worried myself about that for nothing.
John went to get a cup of coffee in the cafeteria and greeted his fellow students. Chatted for a few minutes, and followed after Esmeralda when she came to get them.
Why was he blushing? He didn't seem angry. Was it the fact that he had to start drawing again? Or was it something else? Was he blushing because Sherlock was going to be his study object? It was too dark to see John properly, so he had to study this reaction some other time. Very frustrating.
They were greeted by Major Barrymore, who still looked angry at them for their last visit. And after a short briefing, they were send down. The lab where the virus had spread was in quarantine, and there was only one lab technician at work there. No one could go in, and she couldn't come out. All the other chemists working the medicine were infected, so she was on her own. The virus was dangerous, and it had to be controlled as soon as possible. It was out of the question to bring in other specialists. It had to be kept a secret. They were afraid that there would be a mass hysteria if the world heard of what had happened. (Something to do with a zombie apocalypse.)
Sherlock felt a sudden urge to see John bent over a piece of paper, pencil in hand, his face focused, the tip of his tongue peeking out, wetting his lips as he did when he was intensely focused on his work. He wanted to see how the doctor looked using the right side of his brain, the creative side, instead of the left.
"You mean the labs where your crazy and spectacularly ignorant brother locked me in and made me hallucinate as an experiment? You can probably imagine that I do."
John nodded approvingly, although he already knew what his preference were, and when Esmeralda put the paper upside down he knew she understood the privacy the artwork held for him.
he muses, but wonders sleepily if it would feel different if they’d had ages and ages of time, just the two of them, before becoming parents.
“Oh. Um. Good,” John croaked, shivering at the thought of what would have become of them if the panther had not approved.
He realizes Sherlock is not really listening and gives him a poke. “So, what do you think, now that we see her in person? Better than the aubergine?”
John and Sherlock sit reclined in bed, leaning on pillows propped against the headboard in a warm pool of light. Outside the cottage, rain patters in the darkness, tapping on the leaves of the nasturtiums growing in profusion from a flowerbox below the window.
The baby. That tiny bundle of cells nestled in its mother’s womb, a ribbon of existence unspooling from its incredible potential, yet so small, utterly out of his reach. He craves that potential desperately. Sherlock’s practical voice in his head is incredulous at how much he can grieve the
John, as ever, has no reaction, though Sherlock imagines that if he were to try anything like this with a lucid John Watson, he’d likely flinch away and reaffirm his not-gayness while magnetically pulling toward him with his eyes.
Sherlock thinks he understands him. He, too, loathes being bored. He chases the adrenaline surge of a fresh, risky puzzle, but he also relishes the long, meticulous trial and error, the isolating and hypothesizing, so vital to their work. He wishes he could become molecule-small and study Sherrinford’s mind from the inside, observe the hormones and synapses at work to determine how best to rewire him, see some of his brilliant theorems to completion. Sherlock’s been reading about the brain for years. He could probably manage it.
The danger hinted in his own premonition, so tangled up with John, was becoming clearer all the time. But rather than feeling frightened, Sherlock felt
Sherlock snaps up his mobile and taps out the request. Order placed, he tosses it onto the couch cushions. He eyes John warily. While he’s been distracted, John has stood and is taking a few experimental steps to the light switch. He reaches it, floods the room with light, then turns and wobbles. Sherlock tenses to leap to his side, but John holds up a hand, regaining his balance and completing the trek, finally slumping into his chair.
They sit in silence and John begins to nod off when he feels damp warmth on his neck. He thinks about this for a long, fuzzy moment then realizes with a sharp breath that Sherlock is
Sparks suddenly burst through the mist, running toward them at high speed, her flame-fur puffed out like any startled cat. As John goggled at her, dashing back the way they’d come, a rhythmic clanking suddenly registered, setting his nerves alight. He gripped Sherlock’s arm hard.
< “I was thinking of Melissa – from the Greek μέλισσα for honey bee. Melissa was a nymph who learned the trick of getting honey from bees. She took care of baby Zeus, but rather than feeding the baby milk, Melissa fed him honey straight from the bees.”
“Good, see that it continues. While the Wall stands between us and Faerie, our dreams are free to travel as they like. I had a very meaningful dream last night.”
Sherlock takes his time, sipping his lemonade, enjoying this part. He’s saved Sherrinford a dozen times, though it’s always been for some dull lab practical or a term paper.
“Best dry you off,” the deep voice said ponderously. John was shivering visibly, though not entirely from the chill, and wrinkled his nose against the stench of the polluted water in their hair and clothes. He tried not to think about how much he’d swallowed in the whitewater.
This child he had hoped for, given up as impossible, then craved so fiercely, wishing he could pluck her from her dangerous womb into his own by some feat of modern science.
.” John’s face is shining. “Not sure how you’d have possibly read my rank in my, I dunno, my bike bag or the way I part my hair.”
in 1897, as a result of his belief that homosexuals would not be accepted openly in society and must therefore have a means of underground communication.
I would love to hear if there are certain moments or stories you'd especially like to read. I love a prompt. Their night of dancing. The trysting tree. Getting their tattoos. Lissa at the frog pond with her dads. Please let me know in the comments.
Leaning back into the seat, the baby asleep between them, they doze off into exhausted slumber for the remainder of their journey home.
In less than 30 seconds, she’s done it. Lissa scampers to the other end of the maze, face aglow beneath her goggles, and reaches into a pocket of her little lab coat (a birthday gift from Mycroft) for a crumbly lump of muffin. She watches with frank adoration as the little rat devours her prize.
Lestrade though enviously. Even at Tobi's terrifying speed, they’d still need to track the outlaws long into the night. Queen’s orders.
“No – it’s… I’m not upset with you. I’m fine to wait, really. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed. You keep surprising me, with the way you think about things. It’s… this is a
Mornings with Sherlock, like this, bantering in bed, tussling over the papers and tossing them aside spontaneously to make love. Tramps in the highlands they’d never managed to get around to. Libraries Sherlock had mentioned that he’d never taken him to.
John felt a deep pain creeping into his gut, a wave of nausea washing over him. Mrs. Hudson’s prediction had come true. “Right, then,” he announced with resign into the silence. “Back to work.”
Sherlock stands frozen in the doorway. The Inn is full – only seven rooms – no possibility of a swap.
He knelt and set to work shredding strips of bark into a tinder pile a safe distance from Sherlock’s cocoon of leaves.
John’s sense of awe and horror began to ebb as he worked in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen. She flicked her fingers at a phonograph that began playing a bouncy tune good to dance to, and sashayed out of her pantry sipping a honey-colored liqueur from a tiny, fluted glass. She sliced a knobby root with a silver knife into the savory broth simmering on the range, then consulted a chart on the phases of the moon before adding three pinches of something peppery that made Lune sneeze.
As they set off again, Sherlock leads – he needs to keep is eyes open for clues now that they’re nearing the scene of the incident. Sherlock picks his way carefully over loose rocks on the narrow ridge, barely a few handbreadths’ wide in most spots, the slope dropping steeply to either side as if Rhitta’s child had mounded a mountain of scree, then scraped off sheer slopes in frightful play. He sneaks glimpses back at John who, while a bit too pale for the heat of the day, a bit more silent than usual, follows stolidly without complaint.
“Brother mine,” Mycroft croaks around a mouthful of smoke. Exhaling with force, his voice returns to its usual nonchalant tenor. “You know something about this.”
John glares at the floor, lips pressed together tightly, but doesn’t refute the string of evidence. Sherlock continues to knead his shoulders.
these thoughts. But it didn’t matter. Sherlock had heard it all. He saw the man’s hurt hidden behind his thin mask of anger.
“Next… we give the photos to Meredith, tell her what we saw. The footprints indicate a struggle. I genuinely thought we would find concrete evidence of an accident, but it’s not enough to incriminate him."
Sherlock jams his hands into the deep pockets of his Belstaff. “We did just wrestle three cretins to the ground together…”
Sherlock flops onto the stripped hospital bed. “That one where we put names on our foreheads and have to guess.”
Sherlock is up and out of his seat in a moment, standing behind John’s chair and, fingers poised, begins to massage his shoulders. At his touch, John’s eyes slide closed and he gives a little groan.
“Sherlock, sir, you have my most heartfelt apologies for not being present at the time of the break-in. I was a block away on patrol, ran as fast as I could when I got the all-points notice.”
Johnny’s stomach clenched as he was dropped. A frantic look told him Orvis had pointedly stuffed his hands into his pockets, holding back his magic. Johnny squeezed his eyes shut as the branches rushed to meet him.
And so oblivious that by summer’s end, the sturdy, chestnut-paneled Inn would be a pile of ash, his family flung to his aunt’s stony southern sheep farm, and his lonely nights plagued by dreams of Faerie magic.
Sherlock uncovers his eyes, wrapping both arms around John’s middle and resting his chin where it fits nicely into his shoulder. John blinks. The yellow legal pad has been propped up in front of him on the worktop, showing a line drawing of a tree growing from a double infinity symbol. John marvels at it – he’s never seen Sherlock draw so much as a stick figure, and now here’s this intricate, expressive sketch.
he whispers hoarsely, knowing the signal will send operatives swarming through the back door in less than fifteen seconds.
His companion, too, seemed brighter in the forest, looking relaxed and fond, though still well-barricaded. Sherlock lifted onto an elbow and let John help him to his feet.
John feels more than sees that Sherlock’s hand has drifted away from his elbow and, from the cover of John’s back, slipped into his dressing gown pocket. A nod, hardly a tremor. It’s enough. John coils himself to spring.
and pointing upstairs. I brought her up to see what she was after, but she just kept it up, pointing all around and saying it over and over!”
“Sherlock, just stop it, already,” John rubs his temples with frustration. “Do you think so little of me? If I sat you down one day and fed you a mountain of my secret history, would it honestly make you question…
Sherlock steers him through the gates of Regents Park, the trees shadowy above domes of lights dotting the path, the city skyline glittering.
“Maybe not here. But. In a nightmare. I hit you. Many times.” They had been in a morgue. Sherlock was high, brandishing a scalpel for some reason. John had been so angry, couldn’t stop hitting and hitting him. He can remember Sherlock’s battered face, the bewildered, broken trust in his eyes. John shakes his head to free himself of the awful vision.
Clutching his index fingers in her strong fists, her big blue eyes widen to focus on his face as she gives him a toothless smile that could be gas, or could be happiness. Either way, it makes him grin at her with a ridiculous pulse of affection.
John watched them go, feeling a surge of warmth for the woman, his mouth finally catching up with his mind, calling out, “Thank you – thank you for everything, Mrs. Hudson.”
“I hope they’ll be alright,” Sherlock said quietly. “The Telekinetic who minds them was a good enough person, he never beat them, but I do hope they make it back to their native India one day. They were so hopeful for my escape.”
“What?” Sherrin grins at Sherlock’s discomfort. “You need the guidance of an elder.” He snorts. “And it’s not like you’ll get much from Mycroft.”
Kinsey grinned, clearly misinterpreting John’s horror for astounded disbelief. “Just a matter of months till they make the order. So you see? Doesn’t matter if you're old or have a bum arm or whatever – everyone’s soon to get their chance. Incredible, eh?”
It’s horrific, but it’s, well, I feel incredibly fortunate to get this glimpse of you so young. I imagine not many people have heard this tale.”
Sherlock snapped up guiltily, catching John’s eye and seeing the ghost of a fond smirk. He’d become unexpectedly engrossed in a cluster of fascinating fern sporangium growing near the log they sat on.
John pelted through the forest in what he hoped was the direction of their shelter, adrenaline and fear glossing over the pain in his leg. He’d get in the shield, they’d hide or run, try to push across the Wall. They had a chance now.
Sherlock thumps down onto a fallen log, replaying his memories of the summer in the blinding light of Mycroft’s information.
Mrs. Hudson flopped onto the sofa as Lune padded through the door, likely sensing her distress. He lunged up onto the sofa and settled next to her, the frame creaking, and rested his head in her lap. Mrs. Hudson idly scratched behind his ear. “I can’t find one, though not for lack of trying,” she said bitterly.
He nodded sharply to himself. It was all very simple. With a roar in his ears, John stepped out from behind his tree into the clearing, holding his hands palm-down peacefully, declaring no magical intent.
Mary gives John a quick peck on the cheek as he tidies up the last of the home-rental medical equipment. She watches him for a moment, then drifts into the kitchen to greet Sherlock. John can hear them chatting amiably, Mary asking after his treatments, how he’s feeling, is the pain very bad these days?
The next file is a video, the panorama John had shot. He thumbs ‘play’ and the mountains move gently from right to left as John had slowly pivoted, taking in the ridge, the hulk of Snowdon up ahead, the blue-green mountains rolling off to a humid horizon. He hears a tiny, tinny version of his voice say off-screen,
The bloated hulks of zeppelins dotted the horizon, drifting ponderously toward their destinations. If he hadn’t known they were being pursued, wearing time-sensitive guises, and headed to an unknown safe-house, it would have been almost pleasant to stroll in the quiet of the morning and take in the sights with his new magical companion.
John ignored him, tears smarting in his eyes as the pain lanced through his leg. Hands poised above the break, he struggled to focus his magic, sweat breaking out on his forehead. He hissed as the shards of bone slowly knit together beneath his flesh, the surrounding muscles and sinew settling into their proper places.
“Bet it’s your dad that’s the damn Faerie,” Byrum jeered. The sturdy boy sniffed and rubbed a fist against his nose, scowling darkly as he saw the smear of blood on his pale skin. “What’s say we help him out, eh Orvy? He thinks he can fly, maybe he just needs a
“And the fifth?” Sherlock asked, thunderstruck. The injustice done to their kind made his blood boil. His mind spun as he tried to see a pattern.
“Mm, almost forgot,” John hums, eyes closed. “Happy anniversary, love.” He feels Sherlock stiffen beneath him. His voice is pained.
“I know my part in this, my hands are not clean.” Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. “If I hadn’t been so selfish, you would never have been put at risk. My… feelings for you have always endangered you. I wanted you, and they hurt you for it. I can’t forgive myself for that, John. Neither should you.”
far deeper than had any right to be in Marylebone. Even the wide expanse of Regents Park was a tame lawn compared to this ancient wood towering over him.
weird. But he says there is a high prollybillity that the new med’cine will help you remember. Are you ready?” The rat sniffs energetically at her nose in response, making Lissa giggle.
“Sorry. Nasty cut. Not too deep, fortunately, but you’ve lost a fair bit of blood. Mostly clotted, now. How long did you wait to call?”
, trying to mash the ache deep out of range, deep in the catacombs with his rage for his employer. It’s safer for Victor to be far, far away from him, better for the organization to think he isn’t a pressure point.
His mum cries soundlessly the whole ride home, his dad grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. Mycroft casts him a few meaningful glances, but stares out the window for most of the trip. Sherlock slumps in his seat, weighing the potential outcomes and risks of his choices over and over. His nerves suit the situation perfectly and do not have to be disguised.
“Ah ah ah, no hints,” Sherlock scolds playfully and John grins, pushing off his chest. Sherlock makes room for him on the couch. John settles and waits, a glimmer in his smile, for their little ritual to begin. Sherlock fixes him with steady, searching gaze, reading the shadows beneath his eyes, the fibers of his shirt, the messy fingerprints of his day scattered all over him.
John sighed. There were too many magical mysteries to sort out. For now, he needed to focus on his patient.
He holds out his hands to take in Sherlock, the flat, their discarded dinner, the piles of books and oddments on the shelves.
John blinked quickly. It was ridiculous. Preposterous. He should tell himself he was being scammed and run, but a quiet voice inside told him Sherlock was telling the truth. Somehow he’d always known.
Sherlock’s talking nonsense. But his face, hovering before him, makes John catch his breath. It’s grayish and lined, hollows under his eyes, tear-stained, a solid grizzle of beard darkening his usually sharp, smooth jaw. He looks utterly wrecked. Except that he’s positively glowing with relief. John blinks and blinks.
They were deep in conversation about Mrs. Hudson’s adventures when John emerged in the sitting room looking sleep-rumpled. His face lit up as he caught sight of Sherlock sitting by the fire. Their eyes snagged, igniting effervescence in Sherlock’s belly.
“Fine, keep your secrets. But mark my words, Billy,” Sherrinford points at him with a half-eaten scone as he plops into his seat across from him at the workbench.
The creature raised thick, bushy brows. “Saw you sparkle out of the sky, drop like a stone into my river. Very interestin’. Got out my net to have a looksee.”
Please note that the end of the last chapter has been adjusted – nothing plot-shattering – just some character interactions that tie into this chapter. You might want to go back and read the end of Sherlock and John's scene in the flower shop. :}
with The Work. Tonight was the end of it, wasn’t it? I just… I understand, I do. But it will take some time to understand how we
With a shudder, Sherlock is awake and rational, his mind orienting himself inside the Inn in Beddgelert. He’d fallen asleep at his work table, the hard chair digging into the old scar tissue of his back. How long? His laptop battery is dead. Too dark to see where he’d left his phone. The river babbles just outside the window. Standing to stretch his sore back, he can see a few stars, but no moon.
"Ah. Anti-acne potion, I assume." John heard Mcgonagall say. She turned to the confused faces of the guest teachers, "Oh yes. Thief's Downfall is a security measure at Gringott's. It removes enchantments: no polyjuice potion, and no disguises."
“Indeed. I wasn’t joking about the coffee, by the way. The one on the train is appalling and I didn’t have time to make one myself before I left.”
His last thought before he falls asleep is of the hearth at Baker Street, of the faint orange glow, and John’s warm, steady hands as he methodically stitches up his wounds in front of the fire.
The most recent update is written in scrawly, messy writing from a shaking hand, often tilting downwards by the end of the line.
He thinks about all the times he has found himself miserable and bored and playing crappy games on his phone to pass the time, wishing for company. Now here he is with most of the tables filled up with all sorts of chattering people - mums with toddlers, people on dates, businessmen on phone calls as they drink their heavily caffeinated drinks - and yet he's still bored and desperate to leave. Or rather, desperate to find Sherlock again and find out what is going on with the case.
“Don’t shout, love. Oh, you’re getting the shakes again. Here, we’ll get you inside and give you something for your...irritation.” Victor smiled, emphasising the last word with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
"Better?!" John repeated incredulously. "Bloody hell, Sherlock, I am not better without you. Have you any idea what effect you've had on me the past week? How much you've been helping?"
"The answer to the riddle is 'tomorrow', in case you were wondering," The knocker said as they passed.
Tomorrow, he compromised with himself, as he climbed in beside John, curling up on his side with an arm thrown over John's stomach. Tomorrow morning, when they were well-rested and recovered and Sherlock looked a little less like a corpse, he will wake John up and finally, finally, be rewarded with the reunion they deserved -
Fortunately, he doesn't wait long before he sees John coming out from the train carriage, with a beam bright enough to fill Sherlock with warmth and make him forget the atrocious weather. He is also wearing a raincoat with a hood covering his sandy blonde hair - clever, well prepared - and is somewhat shielded from the weather.
"Nice of you two to join us - Mr Holmes, Watson." Mcgonagall said with a sardonic tone. "If you two could please straighten yourselves out and at least try and behave civilly to our guests - that means you, Holmes," Sherlock scowled discreetly, "then maybe I will let you off detention."
"If," John persisted. "Try to be optimistic here, Sherlock. If he comes back, we'll go looking for him."
"And what is it you want?" Sherlock demands. In answer, she points a gun right at him, safety off, finger on the trigger, and John doesn't think, except to immediately grab Sherlock's arm and pull him behind him.
discuss this with Greg later, and ignores it for the time being. He whispers quietly in Sherlock’s ear, “That deduction you did just then?”
When he reached his dorm room, he was the only one there. He suspected every one else was off celebrating.
Secondly - yes, you would be an idiot for having to double check if being in a romantic relationship - being boyfriends, even, and yes, that term is perfectly acceptable - is okay. I hope I did make myself clear enough in my last letter and I dislike repeating myself. Though I probably wouldn't slap you. I'd like to think myself above physical violence. With the exception of self defence. And when I used to fight with my brother
“It all started around three years ago,” the client, Joseph Weber, says quietly into mug of tea. “I was in a pretty rough place at the time; my parents had died, I was in a job I hated at the bank. And then Eliza Fischer joined. She was like… a ray of hope. Of course, I fell in love with her.”
It wasn't a struggle to leave the dorm at 11:55. The boys were sound asleep, and his feet were silent, even in his leather school shoes. So he opened the door to the common room slowly, being sure cast a muffliato to prevent creeks ringing out. As he left, he had silently thanked Rowena Ravenclaw for not putting a morally obliged painting on the door, that could call for staff and give him away, like the Gryffindors had.
Sherlock turns his head to pout at John. "You know what I mean. We've had two weeks with each other. Two weeks. And now we're going to have to separate again. Who knows how long it will be before we meet again?”
Running outside, he caught the first taxi, spurting out the name and address of the club. Unfortunately, in his plan to arrange a third-first meeting with Sherlock, he didn’t take into account little things like traffic, or being stuck with the oldest, slowest, most cautious taxi driver in the history of taxi drivers. By the time the cab pulled up, John was already pulling out noted from his wallets, chucking enough to pay for the ride up and with change he didn’t stop to collect. He ran out, and joined the back of the queue (he may have been in a rush, but damn it, he was British, and would always respect the queue system.)
Tiana went on to describe the necklace- a blue and purple charm on a black string - and that she last had it two days ago in the Forbidden Forest, having worn it during a Magical Creatures lesson. Sherlock nodded then left for the forest, John by his side, assuring the girl he would have it by the next morning.
“Exactly. You’re injured, you’re hungry, and you’re dehydrated: your priority is clean water. Go from there.”
“Oh, she’s definitely not allowed in, but all the more reason to take her,” he replies with a smirk. “You know I do nothing but strive to annoy my brother and his smug associates in any way I can. Imagine their faces when they see a baby there.”
home?! You’re — you —“ At a loss for words, Sherlock lifted his head off the pillow, and at the same time, John met him halfway and crashed their lips together. Every second of their separation, every minute spent yearning and pining, it all poured out into this one kiss, until it was gone, and Sherlock felt only light and warmth and heady arousal.
The running water stopped, and within a minute John was out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist and traces of shampoo lather left un-rinsed from his shoulders and hair. “You want me to come?”
"I know, Molly's nice. But everyone else is so dull." John kept reading his schedule. "Oh, we have potions together, Sherlock! But I then have herbology with the slytherins."'
If he could have, Sherlock would have laid there in silence for hours, nothing but the sound of their unified breathing and the comfort of John's fingers in his hair. But all too soon, the new nurse came and kicked Sherlock out so that John could have some alone time. "I imagine you'll need to get ready for the day too. See friends, find out what you've missed," the nurse added in a friendly voice, which made Sherlock all the more irritated. He got out of the bed, put on the shoes he had taken off the previous night before climbing into John's bed, then kissed John briefly on the lips . "I'll be back soon." He promised, ignoring any protests the nurse may have had, then left to Ravenclaw common room, where he immediately fell back into bed and closed his eyes, too drained to talk to anyone, friends or otherwise.
Mycroft gives a forcefully cheerful smile that didn’t meet his eyes. “Brotherly concern, that’s all. I was wondering if after six thousand years cabin fever was starting to settle in yet.”
By the time the rain passed, they both came out of their impromptu shelter flushed and grinning, thoroughly dishevelled and entirely unaware of how much time had passed. They decided to give up on finding the necklace as a lost cause, but overall, Sherlock considered it a fairly productive day anyway.
“Oh, come on.” Sherlock takes a swig of his drink. “You obviously knew that already. Mary told you.”
John unintentionally gave a bark of laughter. "I'm sorry. Me? Smart? This coming from you, the guy who figured out what my job was just from looking at me?"
Janine whispered in Mary's ear, and she laughed. "Janine just said that you're avoiding the question because you can't admit that she'll probably beat you."
His smile grew brighter. "Excellent. Do you have some time on your hands? I have to introduce you to someone."
"It was awful. The police wouldn't let me cooperate." Sherlock complained, and John suppressed a bark of laughter, "They haven't caught the murderer yet. But, then, the murders stopped in late August and there haven't been any since."
The next morning John woke to the sound of his phone ringing, the weight of Sherlock’s arm thrown across his stomach. He groaned as he reached blindly for the floor, trying to find his trousers where he kept his phone. He found it soon enough and answered it. “Hello?” He croaked.
John sighs, praying that Sherlock won't go back home just yet and that he will forgive him, while he curses this stupid job with its stupid tables and stupid customers and stupid salary -
"I know. But I told you, they're really, really, nice. Besides, you think things have gone well so far, haven't they."
“The criminal classes of London have been very slow lately. I wouldn’t count on it,” Sherlock grumbles, reluctantly sitting up and poking at his plate sceptically with a fork, as though expecting it to get up and dance any minute.
"I'm John Watson, by the way." He offered his hand out to the man for him to shake, which he willingly accepted, his (full, pink) lips curled upwards into a smile as his considerably larger hand enveloped his.
“Yup. You didn’t eat at all while we were out, so you will eat all of this. And I would hope that it isn’t too much to ask for you to have seconds.”
“Didn’t get the attention I wanted. Critics called it a shit bit of writing. ‘One-Trick Watson’. That was the Guardian’s opinion. Apparently I’m repetitive. Boring. It was nothing to do with the actors. Nothing to do with the set or the director or anything. Just me.”
He responds with a brilliant, false grin as he finishes dressing, then leaves, closing the door behind him to find Lorenzo Alfonsi, his next target.
"And were they tested on rats or real people?" Sherlock asks sardonically. "I only trust myself to get the results I need."
John looked over to Janine, to make sure she understood, and she seemed relatively calm, if a bit bored, though she still looked pale and her hands were shaking. Clearly she had been told all this before.
"Even with the nightmares and getting shot?" Sherlock's hand moved to touch John's scar, gently touching the damaged skin there, impossibly delicate.
“Bugger off. I’m not gay. I’m just... very, very drunk right now. And so are you. So I can say this here. That I’m - that I -" The word is stuck in the back of his throat.
"Come on, even you have to admit there's something romantic about that," John points out. "They were obsessed with each other for two years. And even then it took them a whole month of writing to realise who it was they were writing to."
Sherlock exhales softly, then nods solemnly, taking another long sip of his coffee like it's liquid courage. “Into battle.”
"I think so," Sherlock says with the uncertainty of someone who would do anything and everything to look after the baby perfectly, scrutinising his every interaction. "By the way, John, before you go - Mackerel Watson? Really?"
"Those weren't favours. Those were you employing your intellectual skills to solve what my 'minions' could not. If anything, you should be thanking me for giving your brain stimulus when you hadn't had a case in so long."
He can look at every single person and see the time they have left like a clock ticking down their finite lives to completion, unbeknownst to them. He recognises symptoms of ailments and diseases that have brought many souls down to him in the past, he sees bruises and cuts shared by other victims, whose spouses went a little too far and sent them to the Underworld, whether that was their intention or not. He sees traces of the ghosts of the past, an ancestor’s nose or bright green eyes or curly dark hair in their descendent. It’s all remarkably fascinating.
"What about it?" Sherlock replies casually without looking up from his plate. It makes John want to scream with frustration.
Sherlock rushes out of the room. With a sigh and a smile and avoiding eye contact with Lestrade, John follows, his forehead tingling where Sherlock kissed him.
His grand master plan was this: one day, John would be on a jog around London, as part of his fitness regime he was getting into to prepare for the army, and, coincidentally, happen to jog down the street where Sherlock lived. If he was lucky, he’d get to see Sherlock and Bar Bloke (as he now called him, with a slight bitterness) and give John closure, knowing that Sherlock was far better off without him and he could stop being a creepy stalker. If he was even luckier, he’d bump into Sherlock - hopefully with John on the more attractive side of sweaty and flushed - who, in an ideal world, would be newly single, attracted to John on sight, and strike up a conversation with him. Perhaps he’d invite him out for coffee to make up for knocking him to the ground (as would happen in this fantasy scenario), or even offer him coffee at his flat…
“Of course. We were just finished anyway.” John glances down sadly at his half finished pancake but nods in agreement nonetheless. “Excuse me while I get dressed. John, keep him entertained.”
Why would a trained agent and assassin be so clumsy as to let a civilian like Joseph spot her and take pictures?
"Of course, dear. It's nice to get to speak to you at last. Sherlock's been very secretive about you."
He approached a junction - the path was divided into three. He muttered "point me" again, and the wand indicated to him to keep heading straight forward. Or did it? John never had a good sense of bearings. Sherlock and Mycroft were probably rolling their eyes if they saw him now, most likely heading in the completely wrong direction. Could they see him? How would they see him? He went with his first instinct anyway, shaking the thoughts out of his head.
He felt a hand on his shoulder. "Good luck, Watson." He heard Mcgonagall say. He turned to look up at her.
One side of her told her that this was stupid, petty even. Was this really something worthy of revenge? He's just a boy.
“July 15th. At the end of the letter I crossed a bit out. When I was complaining about you wanting to do something as mundane as go to the cinema.”
"No, I'm not going to be here long." John fiddled with his sleeve anxiously and looked down at the floor.
"The next day I received a letter from 'M' in handwriting I didn't recognise, telling me to meet them in the infirmary at midnight. They had the upper hand; I couldn't change the location or not go. They were to be here, in the same room as you, barely 12 hours out of surgery, and I had to be there too, if only to keep my eye on you. Mycroft tried to convince me not to go, and I'm sure you would have done too. I went anyway.
Although, perhaps that would mean a spike in infidelity and divorces as the number of trials and therefore failures increased, perhaps causing a rise in more crimes of passion. That would make things very interesting.
Yes, by all definitions, I think we're in a romantic relationship. I would double check with you if this is okay and that you're comfortable with all this, but I'm fairly sure you'd travel up to London just to slap me and call me an idiot. And I'd probably let you.
"Relax, only good stuff," Samantha says reassuringly - from John's maths and English class, and also Amy's soulmate. "You should hear him. He's like...Shakespeare when he talks about you. Or Petrarch."
John's face softens and he swears that he can feel his heart melting in his chest. He stands on his tiptoes and pulls Sherlock down for a kiss.
“How charming.” John knelt on the other side of the woman’s head and Sherlock watched in amusement as John started to examine her: sniffing her fingernails, pulling back her hair to observe her face, sniffing her lips, feeling her skin on her cheek. Then he drew back to look at Sherlock. “She’s been dead ten, eleven hours I would say. Self-poisoning. No sign of alcohol consumption, as far as I can tell.”
"Who knows, maybe there is a round which involves crawling through hobbit holes and identifying bones in the human body." Mary shrugged.
"He did. You even replied. Something along the lines of 'I don't care, go away, I have an experiment to complete and your presence will affect the results." Except with more insults."
"Right. Got you. No more puns for the rest of the night." There was a pause, only the sounds of their synchronised breathing and the traffic outside, until John grinned mischievously and suggested, "My Kremlin for a horse?"
TW: panic attack. I'm not sure how realistic it is, as I've never had one myself, or how serious. But there is a panic attack.
"I'm sorry. That didn't go very well in there," he admits. "I thought I could control myself, set a good example for Harry, get through dinner without shouting at some point. Turns out I couldn't."
I'm writing to let you know that I'm now home, safe and sound, as requested. I'm sorry that it's a tiny bit late - I was bombarded with questions about you and my trip to London from my parents for several hours and it completely exhausted me, so I accidentally fell asleep instead of writing to you. I suppose it was probably the same with you and your parents. You should know that my parents greatly approve of you (mostly because I left out the tiny detail of our slightly illegal misdemeanours) and are asking about when they get to meet you. You don't have to meet them just yet. Or ever. They're incredibly annoying. As is my brother, who would definitely get a 'convenient' day off work to cross-examine you. I can only apologise in advance if you do choose to ignore my warning and meet them.
"Merlin, you're dramatic." Sherlock came and sat on the stool, dragging it across until he was sat opposite John.
So, to clarify: we both liked kissing each other, and we both want to kiss each other again. Okay then. Good.
Alissia willed herself to turn back to normal, and after a few seconds of waiting, she returned to her normal height. "I transformed fully? Into a spider?"
John attempts to finish Sherlock's sentence as he struggles. "As his..." Colleague? Friend? Experiment subject? None of those labels seemed adequate, except for the last one, which would only make it seem weird. Mrs Hudson simply nodded knowingly and smiled.
Sherlock felt a tap on the shoulder, and turned to face Janine. "He's here. I can introduce you." Janine said, overly excited.
Before stepping outside, though, he placed a finger on his abdomen through his shirt, where John was stabbed, and tried to name the blood vessels or organs that could have been injured. No major blood vessels. Colon? Intestine? Nerve damage? Possibly. But as far as Sherlock could tell, the wound was not meant to fatally harm. At least in terms of where the wound was. There were so many other possibilities that could cause some kind of fatal injury. A knife laced with dark magic. Something gone wrong with the treatment.
"No, no, it's fine. I'm glad you told me. Now I know not to do anything completely stupid. And I'll still act somewhat surprised when Harry tells me. If she tells me."
"Right. Right." John nods slowly. "So now I have my sister's confidence in my hands as well as my parent's opinion of me. Huh."
"I know, I just wanted to - officially break it up, I guess." He scratched the back of his neck. "So, are we okay?"
When John had woken up in Afghanistan after getting shot, he was alone. His eyes had blinked wearily open under the blinding white of the military hospital lights, he had looked around and there was no one. No family, no friends, even the nurse had someone more urgent to attend to. He could do nothing but wait, his voice too hoarse to yell for attention, wearied by the fever that had wrecked his body while he was unconscious, the ache his shoulder and leg barely numbed by the painkillers he had been allowed. He realised then that this was his future now: solitude. No army friends, no career. Just a military pension and the pitying gaze of strangers falling to his cane.
"Hang on, last berry... There." John added the berry to the cauldron - turning the potion  dark blue - and handed the knife to Sherlock, who started cutting. "Listen, Sherlock, I'm sorry if me and Mary made you - uncomfortable."
Sherlock visits, occasionally. He says hello to John and Mary, if she’s home from work, then to Rosie, who is always pleasant in his company (a small victory over Mary, whose friends cause Rosie to scream and wail in protest whenever they hold her.) Sherlock gives vague answers to John’s questions about cases: it’s the quiet season, only fours and fives, bank robberies and adulteries, but hey ho, needs must when one is in need of some more money.
Harry: So he does what anyone would do and marries this woman bc A) he could end up happily married and safe or B) He could get enough money to go back home
"Don't. The woman will have her wallet returned to her and that man genuinely does steal from people. That guard should find eight more wallets on his person."
Then May came, and the pressure from teachers increased. They set up revision groups in houses, and gave students their own individual revision timetables so that the time John and Sherlock could spend alone decreased. The amount of schoolwork and essays grew, and soon his and Sherlock's time together was limited to actual studying and meals together, with walks around the lake to clear their heads.
He knew it would happen eventually: Mary and John. He was watching the entire time as Mary crawled her way back into John's life and pushed Sherlock out. Sherlock thought with a hint of irony about John's words earlier: "You're getting replaced." Now here he was, pushing through crowds aimlessly to get as far away from everyone as he could. Especially from them.
John lay there anxiously, waiting for the feeling of a needle being stabbed through his head, but surprisingly - or unsurprisingly, really - he felt nothing.
Sherlock hands gripped onto John's shoulders to prevent his knees from buckling weakly against him. John's hand was in his hair, tugging lightly and Sherlock couldn't help the gasps which resulted from John's actions on his sensitive scalp. Then Sherlock bit down on John's lower lip - experimental - and the noise John made travelled straight down to the bottom of Sherlock's belly.
Once out of the room, the doctor pulls off his mask and hat, revealing a worn yet somehow youthful face that defies age or time. His hair is sandy, almost grey, and his eyes are the most exquisite colour Sherlock has seen in over a millenia. The underworld is grey and dark and damp. This doctor - this
The last word that came to John's mind took him by surprise. Would the castle be mourning him? Was he that important? He liked to think that he wasn't a self-absorbed person, but the suggestion still appeared possible.
"Sorry to burst your bubble, Sherlock, but - " John stopped to cast a quick summoning charm, in vain - "at first, you're going to need any case you can get. The consultant detective business isn't exactly popular."
“Should I come? I mean, if I can take Rosie…” The girl in question is currently happily sucking on her fist - not exactly suited for a high end, all male, silence only club.
"He was stabbed." He kept his eyes fixed on the ground, not letting Mycroft see whatever his face may betray. "In the abdomen. The side. There was a lot of blood and he was unconscious. I don't know how deep the wound is, how big the knife was. I couldn't see."
As soon as he was ready, he headed straight for the infirmary, making a beeline against the current of students heading for the Great Hall and dashing through corridors. On his way people tried to stop him, tell him to go to breakfast, ask him how he was doing. One of those people was probably Molly. He couldn't tell. He had kept his eyes focused on the middle distance, in thought, his mind completely overwhelmed by the thought of seeing John for the first time after he was - after last night.
As John finished talking, they hopped on to the self-drawn carriages (which Sherlock was almost certain that it was just an invisible creature drawing it. Not that he knew why. Couldn't they hire other wizards or squibs to drive it? Or invent a spell that actually self-draws the carriages?) and conversation diverted from dull to mind-numbing, so Sherlock closed his eyes and started to wonder how badly injured he would be if he happened to fall out of the carriage at this speed.
“Nah. That’s not that weird.” John sees Sherlock’s eyebrows raise in surprise and he adds quickly, “I mean, it is. Because I’m married now. And I’m not a cheater.”
"And I'd prefer for us to meet in happier circumstances. It's meant to be important, our first time meeting. Those are the stories that get passed down generations and all that."
Still, life went on. John worked hard to heal  using the simple exercises the nurse gave him and various potions he had to take daily, so that by the end of the week he could walk without a limp and sit down and stand without hissing through his teeth and pressing a hand to his abdomen like it was still bleeding. The pain would never really leave, but it was at least tolerable for the moment. He also threw himself into his schoolwork, pushing himself to catch up with his classmates and work until his mind was too exhausted to even think about that night in the maze. Sherlock didn't really put much effort into any of the tasks and essays and research the professors gave him, but that wasn't much of a change. Still, the fact that he did this without his usual proud and stubborn exclamations of the pointlessness of the tasks worried his professors and friends. He was unusually and unbearably silent. What was even more worrying, he rarely tried to correct anyone. Anderson noticed this change more than most.
(Looking back, that sounds harsh. It’s not. Imagine it being said in a nice way. You’re smart in your own way. Love you. Don’t be mad.)
John chuckled, his determination to stay and talk to this man unshaken. "That, you do. So, in celebration, may I buy you a drink?"
“I never make spelling errors. No, I was going to say ‘where’s the boy I fell in love with?’ So there. Proof. Exhibit A. So on and so forth.”
I have sent a photo from a couple of years ago of me and Redbeard. There are few pictures of me where I look like I enjoy having a camera shoved in my face, but I'm sure this will do. It's not from a special occasion or anything - my mother insists on taking pictures at random times. But I think it was a good day. Just us at the park, me throwing tennis balls for him to catch, and him going in the complete opposite direction to greet a nearby labrador.
Fifteen minutes later, the two hopped off the train to be greeted by Molly Hooper and Greg Lestrade - a fellow Gryffindor and quidditch player of John's.
"Not gay?" The Milverssen's voice turned female, and it transformed before John's eyes from the reptile-arachnid hybrid into a girl. Dark hair, red lipstick, cat-like eyes, and with only a grey-ish tint around her skin to show it was in fact the Milverssen, John recognised her - it? - easily. Irene Adler. "I know. I heard you."
With that, Sherlock dashes out of the flat and heads downstairs. John sits there for a moment, stunned into silence, then breathes out, "damn it!”
“Please, this case would have been a six at best,” John jokes. It eases the tension slightly and Sherlock’s lips reluctantly twitch into a smile. “You wouldn’t have bothered changing out of your sheet or leaving the flat. You would have solved it in a heartbeat.”
Being Sherlock Holmes' flatmate was the best, worst, most torturous, most exciting thing John had ever experienced.
"The retinas get damaged when exposed to bright - oh, never mind." John blushed and looked at his feet.
Those deductions are brilliant as usual, and pretty much all correct. It was actually the first tournament the team ever won, and I happened to be captain at the time. It was a pretty brutal game, the finals, which is how I got so injured. The other team had a bit of a reputation for that. Another one of my friends ended up with a broken collarbone, and someone else twisted his knee. Still, somehow, out of sheer dumb luck I guess, we won. But you're probably not interested  in knowing rugby tactics.
"You don't have to. Besides, you've already called me intelligent and tolerable and kind and funny. We're even in that respect now."
purple shirt -  his hair previously made frizzy by Summer heat, now tamed into curls. John doesn’t disguise the appreciative look in his eye as he smiles up at him, and nor does Sherlock for him.
“Ugh, I don’t know. A lot of things. I miss uni. I miss my friends. I miss you. I miss pubs. I miss going out.”
“Drama queen,” John says affectionately. He doesn’t visibly respond to this, though John likes to imagine the insulted face currently being hidden by the sofa cushions.
"Oh, um, I don't know. Probably since fourth year. Longer than I've been aware of. Why do you want to know?" John asked. His heart was beating so fast he felt sick. "Because I know why you're here. You're going to say -" John made his voice lower, doing an impression of Sherlock-"'listen, John, I'm flattered by your interest but I don't like people, especially you, in that way. I'm an asexual sociopath who doesn't need human emotion. All I care about is the Work but don't worry we can still be - "
“But I need you!” John yells this before he can stop the words from falling out, and instantly the air sobers and the room falls silent. Sherlock opens his mouth to respond, then closes it, frowns, his eyes soft and confused in a way that makes John’s chest tighten. Does he know? He looks like he’s on the verge of knowing, with the same look on his face as just before he solves a case, the moment where everything is nebulous and urgent, before the dam finally breaks.
John holds out his hand and Sherlock steps forward without hesitation, wrapping long arms around him as John rests his forehead on his shoulder.
Molly feels her cheeks flush with pride. “Oh. Well, I - I sort of cheated a bit. Had a head start. I studied Twelfth Night in year nine so I know about the play and the character. If you had the same advantage - “
The other side of her reminded the other that this is not just about the boy. This could be an escape from the everyday mundaneness of France and Beuxbatons and its restrictions. This could be a chance to learn things her school wouldn't dare teach, improve her potential in the things she had learnt in her days working for her parents.
Even under the dim lighting, John can see Sherlock blushing, a faint pink rising from his neck to his face. It’s a beautiful sight when he blushes and John’s praise never fails to cause it.
He approached her in the Great Hall at breakfast while she was sat with Janine. They both looked up at him - Mary coolly, Janine in surprise - and Janine nodded in understanding before sitting elsewhere. Mary glared at him.
“I wouldn’t have been allowed to travel any sooner than I already did. It’s fine. We’re home now.” John offers a warm smile, which Sherlock echoes half-heartedly. “Play something, will you?”
Of course it was true. Sherlock had no reason to deny it. The wizarding community in Britain was small - over 70% of couples met while at Hogwarts for this reason. If they were sharing a room, then they must be thinking about moving in together, and working together, and getting married and -
Sherlock stretches out his hand and John uses it to pull himself up. "Do you think we can risk going to the bar and getting a drink and some crisps?"
In terms of meeting, I'd really love that too. I'd prefer sooner rather than later too, but it'll depend on a lot of things. It's not surprising at all that you want to meet so soon, because I do too. It doesn't matter if you don't know what my favourite food is (curry) or what clothes I normally wear (plaid shirts and jumpers with jeans) or much else. We'll find that out in our own good time. Besides, some people meet within two weeks of talking to each other. We're fairly slow compared to some.
Sherlock rolls his eyes as a grin appears. “Excellent deduction. However did you come by such a conclusion?”
They chase him down the road, passing pedestrians, cutting in front of cars and taxis, cutting down alleyways. The man is fast, but so are Sherlock and John. The adrenaline pumps in John's veins and he grins, even as the wind stings his veins and his legs and lungs ache, desperate for oxygen. Eventually, they come to a dead end and the man presses against the wall, breathing heavily, panic-stricken, a knife steadily held out in front of him. John points his gun back at him, still on safety but ready to disarm him if he dares to even touch Sherlock.
"Who did this, Mycroft? Why?" Sherlock's vision went blurry, and he wiped away the impending moisture from his eyes. Not here, not in front of Mycroft. "Why John?"
"I'm afraid, if I didn't I would be utterly irresistible. People would flood from all over to come and see John Watson in the blue shirt, crowd around him wherever I go - "
"Of course." The corners of John's lips turned down to show that on this, he was completely serious. "You're one of the most...non-ugly people I know."
"It's always colder than expected in Britain," Mcgonagall replied coolly, "Even to the people who live here. Why do you think we complain so much?"
Previous summers had been...lonely at best. Each year, for two weeks, they hired out the same villa in the South of France, next to a beach and with a swimming pool. Sherlock was not interested in swimming, and the beach was too full of irritating tourists and Mr Holmes insisting on throwing a ball at him, as though any sane human would derive pleasure from catching and throwing balls. From the ages of one to eleven, Sherlock had had Mycroft for company, either to play games with - mostly Pirates - or to help with experiments (or, in one memorable summer, to be the subject of experimentation, particularly on the reaction of the human digestive system to the consumption of seawater. The results were messy and Mrs Holmes had banned experimenting on family members thenceforth. Sherlock hadn't dared to argue but it was well worth it. Particularly as a suitable punishment for Mycroft abandoning Sherlock for university in Oxford the following autumn.) After Mycroft stopped going on family holidays to focus on work, Sherlock had only his books and boredom. That was until he had his soulmate journal to talk to John with. And now, this year, John was here himself, not just as words on a page or a voice in a phone.
Thankfully, the wait was shorter than John expected. On October fourth, the day before he could enter, the other schools arrived.
"Your father is just saying, John, that there's no need for you to commit so quickly," Mrs Watson explains calmly, but it still makes John's blood boil. "You two could still just be friends. There's no pressure for you to be in a relationship so soon after you started writing to one another."
"You alright, Sherlock?" Mary asked, and John jumped slightly when he remembered she was there, "I heard about what happened at the Yule Ball. Sorry about Victor."
"Yeah, I think the latter is a bit better." John grins and takes the cane from him. "Thank you, Sherlock. Seriously."
Harry reads out the cast list one by one: Viola is played by Molly Hooper, a pretty girl who blushes as everyone claps politely; Orsino is played by Greg Lestrade, who groans and swears under his breath at the cruel whims of the universe; Olivia is played by Kate Johnson, Irene’s girlfriend and shamelessly the object of her favouritism (though Harry has assured John that Irene has said that she was actually a good actress, since she took GCSE drama); Malvolio is to be played by Philip Anderson; Maria is Sally Donovan; Feste is Clara Lambert - the list goes on to minor characters that John can’t bring himself to care about enough to pay attention to.
“It’s always me. It’s always my enemies, my cases that hurt you. Everytime you get kidnapped, or stabbed, or placed into a semtex vest, or thrown into a bonfire, it’s all due to your association with me,” he spits. “And every time, I always wonder, what will be the final straw that takes you away from me?”
“We’ll be at Scotland Yard in the morning to go through the evidence,” Sherlock announces. “The police will be here soon. Come, John, I think it’s time we get back home. Rosie would have at least noticed our absence by now.”
"I don't know how your therapy goes, but normally thinking about hypothetical scenarios is not something most people advise."
I hope you’ve been well the past few days. I myself haven’t really been my best, to say the least. You probably knew that anyway – it hardly takes a psychologist or psychic or whoever deals with emotions to know it.
“Okay!” In a remarkable feat of athleticism for his hungover state. Sherlock leaps up off the sofa and ushers her out of the room. “Thank you for visiting. We’ll bring down your gingerbread plate when we can.”
"Gryffindor have never been particularly clever with their passwords, I got it in a matter of seconds. But that's not important. You know you have five minutes until you and Mary have to go down to the hall with the other Champions, right?" Sherlock said.
(For the record, I am not one of those people. We are not romantically entangled so I have no reason to have a say in your personal life.)
- is light and radiant, made from the oceans and beaches and all the beautiful things Sherlock has gone without for so long.
Kiara nodded slowly, then raised her eyebrows at the quill. The notebook shifted so that John couldn't see what was being written. "I see. How did you feel when you were chosen? When, out of all those people the Goblet could hand picked,  it picked you?"
John mock salutes and leaves the room obediently. Once he does, he takes a moment to lean against the wall outside, suddenly tired to the bone and needing a long nap. Or caffeine. Just as he's about to muster up the last of his energy to get a drink of water, he hears the rumble of Sherlock's voice from inside the hospital room.
John laughed. "Thank you. Besides, it might be fun for you. Mary has a friend." John emphasised the word friend in a way Sherlock didn't want to identify the meaning of. "Janine, remember?"
“You’re thinking too loudly. It’s annoying.” Hopkins sighed, mumbled something under her breath, but she complied. John stayed in the corner, arms folded.
The paper unrolled, to reveal a moving photograph of a serpentine creature, repeatedly crawling across the floor of some darkened room towards where the camera would have been. It was long - at least five foot - and had shiny scales coating its body. It's eight scaly legs stuck out from the side of its abdomen, spider like, and at the end of the legs were sharp, needle-like claws. But it was the fave that haunted John the most.
“Why? Aren’t there enough diseases going around without strangers willingly touching hands with each other?”
“Usually, no. But with very pretty men such as yourself…” In the dark, Sherlock sees Marco’s eyes travel up and down him as he trails off, somewhat appreciative, mostly hungry. He resists the urge to blush and button up his undone shirt;
The cab pulls up outside of 221 Baker Street and John steps out, his exhausted brain only barely remembering to pay the cabbie before leaving. Cabs are an indulgence John rarely can afford, but given how sleep deprived he is, with the lack of caffeine in his system only making that worse, the idea of getting on a crowded tube or dealing with ticket machines seems like a nightmare. The tube is hard enough as it is with his cane - the sympathetic looks, people feeling guilty and drawing attention to his injury by giving up their seats. It's humiliating more than anything, as he is usually perfectly happy standing up.
"I don't think you've thought this through. Where will you live? How do you start a consulting business with minimal qualifications? Who will be there for the flashbacks and nightmares?" John's voice raised in volume. "What about me? What will I do without you in school?"
Harry: Actually, it’s precisely your closeted, emotionally repressed energy from high school that you will be bringing to this role
At midnight, after a long day of avoiding all interactions and pitiful looks from her fellow students, she crept out of her bed, put on a thick jumper and some shoes, then tiptoed out of the carriage ghosting across the floorboards as silent as the night until she reached the door. She barely noticed the cold as she walked to the Forbidden Forest, her heart in her throat.
“Right. Finally,” Harry says calmly, though John swears he can hear a smirk in her voice. “Let’s start - Greg, it’s your monologue. Act 1, scene 1.”
"It's fine. Worth it." Sherlock smiled. His eyes diverted to the floor and John's breath got caught in his throat when Sherlock looked back. He didn't speak. He only felt himself subconsciously leaning towards Sherlock -
Sherlock isn’t entirely sure what he was thinking when he approached John first with his deductions.
Sherlock inhaled. "You have obvious bags under your eyes and shaky hands from drinking multiple cups of coffee this morning.  Therefore you stayed up later than usual. You have ink smudged over your hand from writing; it was an essay. I knew it was charms because you hate charms. You find it useless and dull. Well, you also find potions dull but you want to become a wizard-doctor. It requires newts in potions, so you wouldn't leave it until the last minute. So charms it is." Sherlock finally exhaled.
"Of course. Anytime. Though preferably, as little as possible. Once a year is probably more than enough. No offence."
"Undid embarrassing situations, mostly. Got my sister out of a couple of scrapes. Used it for the occasional date. Time travel is great for practising pick up lines."
Moriarty cackled. "How adorable. You were right, Sherlock, by the way. There was no point in sparing a potential witness. Madam Pomfrey, was it?" Before the information could properly sink in, the criminal mastermind then flicked his wand, shooting out a spell wordlessly, which Mycroft barely blocked in time. The man grinned. "Very good! But you can't be allowed to continue. You just can't."
"Not physically. Not yet. It's only a matter of time." The man's sing-song voice fuelled her anger further. "And I know what kind of girl you are. Fuelled with life-long anger and sense of vengeance. When the inevitable happens, you will want help with that, and trust me my plan will serve you enough justice to last a lifetime. You know what, I'm running out of time." He drew something out of his jacket's breast pocket. "Take my card. It will have the details you'll need if you change your mind." He offered her the card and she took it cautiously, keeping it in her hand. "I hope to see you very soon, Alissia."
Okay, John thinks. So he's a policeman and not a writer. Still, that doesn't let him sway his imagination, switching the nature of the fantasies from quiet and mysterious writer to intelligent but mildly dangerous cop - chasing down criminals, manipulating suspects into confessing with his deep voice, maybe even wearing a police uniform. (Would the man suit a uniform? ... Yes, he definitely would.) John can only dream of the exciting life this man must lead, if he ignores the logical side of his brain pedantically reminding him of all the paperwork the policeman must deal with.
all seemed too accurate and too honest. Thankfully, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a man oscillating on the pavement, pacing anxiously and looking around with jerky head movements. "Sherlock," he says quietly, "is that him?"
"Why don't you just tell all your minions to deal with it? This is a three at best," Sherlock had complained, stretched out dramatically on the sofa in his pyjamas and dressing gown, with his feet hanging off the end.
The night goes on and was mostly spent simply talking - Robert recounting the story of his first visit to America and the disasters which occurred there, Liam telling the story how he broke his leg in rugby, John joining in with the story about his collarbone. Samantha launching into a long rant about her favourite author - mostly alcohol induced, but Amy clings onto every word and listens as though it is gospel - Sherlock showing off and deducing other people in the room. No one is particularly bothered about dancing, until the song transitions into a slower one, and as though in a trace, everyone instinctively reaches for their soulmate partner, if they are present. The teenagers in the room take a little longer, murmuring questions to their partner and shrugging, as if they don't have particularly strong feelings on the matter, on wanting to dance with the other for the first time. (Robert simply mutters something about going home and calling Lucy, then leaves after a few quick goodbyes.)
“Like ordering away for a fancy fruit basket,” John quotes himself quietly, puzzled, then blinks hard, “Oh.
From far off, he can feel his body nagging him for attention. As he trots to a door that will bring him back, he passes by a wall safe he’d hastily built the day Sherrin showed up. Twisting through the combination, he tugs open the heavy door to find a chain-wrapped wooden box brimming with his anxiety over Project Redbeard. He pulls a ring of keys from his belt and unlocks several padlocks, snaking the chains away. He doesn’t open the box. He knows what he’ll find. But he looks at it for a very long time. When he finally closes the safe, he does not lock it.
Sherlock watches the car drive off, his chest very tight, and turns to find John watching him. He swallows hard. “Hungry?”
Does he know too much? Will he be dosed? Kidnapped? Killed on the spot? She looks like she could do the job. He rattles through his options and their probability of success.
And then, the camera sees what they had not, preoccupied as they had been. The solid silhouette of a bird slides through the sky, angling sharply down toward the ridge.
for your thrilling project so I may inquire after your activities without threatening my very life,” he sniffs lazily.
Royal guards had first verified Lestrade’s identity using coils of copper wire and sparking glass domes. Clockwork storks had tottered around them, recording and evaluating Lestrade’s voice and scent.
“White oak,” he said quietly, rolling it between his fingers. He pocketed the trinket and gave the fiddler one last long look over his shoulder, the reel of the jig fading as they followed Sparks around a corner. He sighed wistfully. “I used to play.”
“John!” Sherlock storms out of the bathroom, forgetting his plan to hide. “You’re a wonderful father. You’re affectionate and present. You’re the only one who can make her do that laugh that sounds like a goose, and you know all her favorite songs. You can get her to sleep properly – I’m sure I’m just instilling bad habits.”
John blushes. “I’d not’ve thought those sorts of moves were acceptable in public if the whole crowd hadn’t been doing ‘em too…”
The panther blinked at him slowly, then sauntered over to stretch out by the fire. It was comforting to have Lune nearby. The magnificent creature had flitted through his feverish nightmares, guiding him to gentler dreams. They had sat for ages by a stream from his boyhood forest, trading stories.
Gradually, the wave passes. Sniffing hard, feeling wrung out and embarrassed, he surreptitiously tugs up his shirt to wipe his face before daring to face John. Suddenly his mortification softens.
He peeks in again on John, stationed in his room, looking more comfortable in the old pajamas Sherlock took from his house that morning. Detached from all the wires and monitors, he looks as if he’s just nodded off in Sherlock’s bed.
Mrs. Hudson stepped over a low ring of stones, placed very intentionally around the trunk, grown over with thick moss on a carpet of rust-red pine needles. As she and Lune strode into the ring, they simply disappeared as if they had walked through a thick curtain.
A chill, damp day weighs heavily outside the flat. Inside, the fire crackles in the hearth and John is half-dozing on Sherlock’s lap, both stretched out on the sofa beneath the tartan blanket. Hot toddies sit half-drunk on the table and Sherlock’s deep voice rumbles as he reads aloud from a worn paperback:
“The joint was inflamed, but I’ve reduced the swelling. It will likely return in a day or so, but I’m happy to attend to it while we’re here.”
John emerges from the bathroom, skin pink and scrubbed clean, smelling of his shampoo and an unfamiliar chamomile lotion that must have been complementary from the inn. Sherlock surprises him by having plates of steaming fish and chips, peas and carrots already brought up from the dining room.
With Lissa’s eagle eye, they found one untouched pod and, as if the thing were a stick of unstable dynamite, pulled up the plant. Lissa delegated the tricky job of transport to Sherlock and ran ahead through the damp grass toward the cottage, the soles of her pale little bare feet flashing.
PSS For any curious, my 8yo still likes to bounce outlandish plot ideas off of me now and then, and often says, 'Mama, you should go write!!' but is now pretty removed from the project. Which is perfect timing, since the simmering, slow-burn romance would definitely not be his cup of tea. ;D He prefers when I write him Kiki's Delivery Service 'easy-reader' fanfic! <3
He peers at Sherrin through the glass tubes and beakers, his prickly layer of protective condescension slipping.
Even though he sees the logic, the very idea of being left in the well alone again horrifies him. He bites his lip and nods, aware that Sherlock is only inches away watching him very closely. He guides John’s stiff hand to the rope, squeezing it closed.
Since, due to the security risks, we are not able to procure milk from Rosamund, why not go for home-cooked instead of defaulting so quickly to formula?”
“John–” Overwhelmed, Sherlock burrows his face into his shoulder, clings to him. John nuzzles his neck and rubs his back while their hearts thunder together between them. John is considering kissing him again when the familiar, tinny whine of sirens becomes audible through the trees. Sherlock’s head snaps up.
A tension he had not realized he’d been carrying finally dissolves. He feels light. Sherlock turns his head toward him at the door. Their eyes meet. Slow, warm smiles bloom on their faces.
“Shot? Jesus, Greg, who?” John shakily releases the bedclothes and folds his arms tightly to control the tremor in his hand. Lestrade considers him, confused.
Molly rips off the sheet and Sherlock erupts from the table. He rubs the fake blood off of his face with his sleeve and pauses just long enough to grip Molly’s hand in what he hopes expresses his deepest thanks. He locks eyes with hers, watery and worried.
While still a young, reclusive Princess, Toria’s brilliant clockwork had so impressed her royal parents that she’d been given a full experimental laboratory. No expense was spared. No request was too outlandish.
John’s reverie suddenly snapped. He blinked quickly, coming back to himself with a sharp breath. There were voices in the distance. John froze, realizing with a shock that he’d walked very far from Sherlock.
The Queen was dead, long live the Queen. The Princess’s royal duties loomed. Toria was instructed to leave behind her childish whimsies and focus on duties befitting a Queen. The Laboratory was to be shut down.
There are no windows in the room and his phone is out of reach in the bag, but John can imagine it’s well past 3am.
“You look like you just saw a ghost. Here, let me get you some water.” He led the pale man to a large barrel propped on logs over the muddy, sawdust-strewn ground. He drew him a paper cup of tepid water. Kinsey drank it, then several more, standing tense and mute.
John is startled as Sherlock suddenly pulls away from him to drop to all fours by a trim flower bed, his nose practically in the zinnias.
To John’s horror, the tracker-wielding pair began following the Wall back the way he’d come, toward Sherlock sleeping in his dome. John didn’t know how strong the shield would be, but considering Sherlock’s weakness, he guessed it could fail if challenged. He’d be completely defenseless.
“Oh. You won’t have milk for your tea in the morning. I’ll go out now–” Sherlock says guiltily, squirming to get up. John holds him down with his legs.
Gradually, the festival air faded. It was difficult to speak with the chill roar of wind in their ears. Villages thinned to pasture and trim fields turned wild. As they flew farther away from John’s life among Faerie-hunters, his mind slowly began to absorb this new, impossible thing.
Sherlock tried to focus, but felt impatient and distracted, his knee bouncing. The hot sun made his thoughts fuzzy. This lesson reminded him of the long, tedious lectures his grandmother had given him as a child.
“Oh – of course, I’m so sorry to have delayed you,” John said quickly, feeling abashed. “Please, can I help you downstairs?”
“Really, John it’s just basic procedures,” he says, half-distracted by his checkup. “I observed your doctors. And I’ve watched you for years. I did my research, I know what I’m looking for.”
during their acquaintance is far shorter, though far more confusing to Sherlock, the night of tears being the most baffling. They had stood close together, tense, John soaking sherlock's shirt with his sobs. Sherlock had not been so much
He returns quickly with a warm, wet flannel and ceremoniously cleans John’s belly and thighs, grinning at the sweetness of his cock in repose. He ducks to give it a small kiss, eliciting a giggle from John, eyes closed, curled on his side like a cat in a sunbeam.
With a huff, John dutifully scraped the pungent paste from his mortar into the simmering soup and marveled as it snapped with white sparks.
“I made one other stop on my way.” Sherrin pulls an envelope out of his back pocket and holds it out for him to take. “Lest you think I’m taking advantage of your brilliance…” Sherlock stops and tears it open warily. The texture and scent of the paperstock tell him
Sit.” Sherlock thumps the paperback onto John’s chest and whirls out. John laughs quietly to himself, thumbing open the book, but his mind can’t concentrate on the words.
“How will this child have any sense for its place in its lineage if it has no notion of its roots? John, you have ancestors from
At John’s words, Sherlock jolts out of his sleepy, syrupy reverie and twists around to face him, eyes flashing, coiled to spring.
“I’m going to climb out now and pull you up, John. I’ll just be right outside the well.” John wonders if Sherlock can deduce how frightened he’s been. He worries now about how his reedy friend could possibly lug him all the way up single-handedly. Sherlock grips his shoulder reassuringly. “There’s a young beech tree nearby I can use for leverage.” John nods weakly while Sherlock climbs up and away.
Sherlock smirks, a victorious glint in his eye. “Are you sure wouldn’t like a try? It’s quite stimulating.”
He finds two of Sherlock’s dressing gowns hanging on the back of the bathroom door and chooses the cozy plaid flannel in favor of the blue silky one. Tying it on, the scent of Sherlock puffs up from the fabric. He heads to the kitchen to make tea, a jaunty little hop in his step.
John’s tightly-contained panic could propel him out of the well if his numb hands could only grip the rope. Shaking like a poplar leaf, the cold in his body is a dull throb.
You can see it yourself quite plainly. A socially ostracized genius, bitter toward his fellow man, self-medicating his fits of stagnation with powerful narcotics. You were a self-destructive mess. He knew you would leap to his bait.”
Sherlock points to his screen and taps ‘play’ on a YouTube video he’s loaded. A sheer, stony ridge appears, rust red, shot from above by a drone. Brightly colored dots move along the narrow crest, the sides sloping steeply to the valley far below. John stiffens and suddenly the flutters in Sherlock chest are frozen, replaced with a sinking dread.
Whatever culinary trifle Sherlock is about to describe fades on his lips as he pushes open the door to 221C, his eyes taking in the new cast-iron bee knocker.
The humans were honestly thrilled to be rid of their wild captives. The prison never held halfbloods for long. And so for
The quadies thumped their retreat, quickly gaining speed as they followed their route back to the edge of the forest. Lestrade stared absently into the dark blur of trees, turning over the night’s events. He’d already sent a Repeater ahead to prepare a team for northward pursuit. He hated the things, but he had to admit it was convenient to have a messenger waiting in his satchel who wouldn’t mind the smoke.
Breathlessly, reluctantly, Sherlock pulls away from their kiss to better understand why John isn’t in his lap, only to see his rakish grin.
Sherlock suddenly hears a faint buzz and pounces on the sofa, pushing his fingers between the cushions to retrieve John’s mobile from its depths, 2% of its battery remaining and each and every text from the last night and today waiting to be read.
John can’t trust his voice so he just nods curtly. Sherlock flashes him a sudden, unexpected smile and pulls himself up the rope in a strong, lithe movement. Water drips off of him as he climbs, pattering onto John below. He watches him scale the distance with surprising steadiness and speed, oddly touched at the sight of his long bare feet gripping the rope.
his heart had cried. Too late. The clockwork was already in motion, no way to stop it. It had taken all of his willpower to stay limp on the pavement, cricket ball clenched against his side to silence his pulse, to convince John, clever John, that he was dead.
Dead battery? Impossible, John is meticulous about keeping their phones charged, in the event they ever need to call for an emergency. He’d even bought extra chargers and left them near spots they tended to get stuck under their sleeping baby. Sherlock always texted John at the clinic when Melissa was asleep on him – it was a whole new playing ground for flirting – and John had caught on to the habit.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock. So, so sorry you had to endure this horrific experience. I’m bloody raging inside that they took such advantage of your mind.” Sherlock can feel John’s hand clench against his back reflexively and leans into him, relief fogging his thoughts.
The back door suddenly opens and the kitchen and living room fill with civilian-clad operatives, all looking like they’ve just wandered into the house for a casual dinner party.
He scrambled back into the branches.“Not that you lot bother with that.” He looked up at a yellow-eyed starling just above his head. “See, if I were a
Inner Sherlock lists out the symptoms of hypothermia he should be watching for. He’s still shivering violently, which is good, but the exhaustion and clumsiness are bad. He doesn’t have Sherlock’s powers of deduction to know the temperature of the water, or gauge how long he’s been in it by how quickly it’s risen or how much the moon has moved. Realizing his thoughts are getting fuzzy, he doubles up his treading efforts, thinking forcibly of people he should be trying to stay alive for.
“Not really. So, Magnusson recovers his memory and recalls that Rosamund drugged and betrayed him. He tells the police he’s been framed for my attempted murder, and uses all of his media mite to demonize her. It will certainly make it tricky for her to get through customs now that there’s a warrant out for her arrest, but I sincerely doubt it will impede her very much. Magnusson is a mosquito to her. The police won’t find her until we do.”
“You will say nothing of our little arrangement to John Watson or the League. When I have my serums, you get John.”
Sherlock stands on the curb holding a bloody tissue to his nose. Blood has spattered his white dress shirt.
Back in the cool, polished mahogany-quiet of the manor, Sherlock curls up in a wing-back chair, knees folded under his chin, eyes settling into a familiar soft focus as he studies the crumpled formula. Sherrinford pours a whiskey for himself from their father’s liquor cabinet and finds a lemonade in the ice box for Sherlock, lobbing the bottle toward him. Without looking up, Sherlock holds up his hand, catching the bottle with a sharp slap against his palm.
Sherlock lets go of him and John slips below the water, arms flailing out to bob himself higher, but the weight of the chain pulls him below the surface. He feels Sherlock perform a tidy surface dive, feels hands at his ankles, tugging the chain, assessing in the darkness. He tries to be patient, but soon John’s lungs are burning. His hands grope through the water for Sherlock, find a leg, tug.
Those first nights, as he lay on his cot in the crowded barracks listening to the talk, he began to realize how few of his fellow recruits believed they’d
“You didn’t sit out many, as I recall,” Sherlock hums contentedly, his arm twined tightly around John’s waist as they walk.
He wishes he could help, but all he can do is cling to the rope and watch as the opening of the well creeps closer. Glancing below, the dark water slips away from him.
The door is shaking. Funny, that. Wonder why? With a sharp crack, the metal of the sliding bolt snaps and the bathroom door slams open, John hurtling through.
“Oh. Oh!” Sherlock looks up at his brother with wide eyes. “You’re trying to induce unconsciousness.” Sherrinford, sprawled sideways in a matching leather chair, smiles over his drink at him.
Outside the medium’s dingy tent, John huffed a weary sigh. Those days had turned into years, and though he’d learned more than he could have imagined and seen the horrors the Wall could unleash, he’d still never met a Faerie. John had been hanging around Kinsey for days, hoping to earn his trust, get a scrap of real news about the Kent Downs halfbloods. But clearly the young Private wasn’t going to spill his secrets.
Lissa suddenly beams at this, nodding vigorously. He breaths a little sigh of relief to have avoided a powerful bout of temper that would have put off the rest of the experiment for at least an hour.
He cries for their younger selves, separated by the height of a building; for Sherlock, alone and dead to the world, out doing god knows what for two years trying to keep him alive. The grief of those years surges into him and he grips Sherlock more tightly.
"Don't be daft, gorgeous. How do you think they feed me? There is a small hatch at your left. When you open it, you can put something inside. After you closed it, I can open it on my side. The air will be cleaned and filtered before you can open it again. But it's a one way thing. I can't send anything out."
"Eve and Ley are always together. And they must be in the area. Let's hope they saw something. Come, follow me."
John looked around him for something he could use to do something for him, anything. Finally he got up and grabbed the roll of paper next to one of the artworks Jenkins had made of Sherlock. John didn't look at it. He didn't want to see. With the paper he gently cleaned the vomit from Sherlock's jaw and chin, and the urine and blood from his abdomen, groin and thighs. Carefully watching Sherlock's breathing and heartbeat. They were both shallow and quick, but stable.
Maybe you started dating again, found yourself a nice, lovely woman. Someone who fills your heart as you did mine.
"Listen and try to hear the things he doesn't say to you, Then you'll understand what I mean." She explained. with a small smile on her face.
While John was the one that sort of poured his heart out, told Sherlock his deepest secrets, he still felt the need to comfort Sherlock. It should have been the other way around, shouldn't it?
John could just hear the confusion in Sherlock's voice, and despite the big slip he just made, he had to laugh at it.
David's eyes were scanning John's torso. His gaze lingering to long on his hips, going back to his chest. John could see him swallow and saw a blush coming up on the man's cheeks.
They talked. There was just so much they could do. Sherlock wasn't going to be released just yet, so John was sitting next to the hospital bed as much as possible. The first three nights he had spent in the hospital, but the two nights after that he went home to sleep. After their confessions to each other, John stayed the night in the chair again. The next day, Sherlock had almost panicked because John wasn't there when he woke up. When John came in ten minutes later freshly showered and with a hot cup of coffee, he assured him that he didn't change his mind, and that the conversation of yesterday really had taken place.
He looked at the box on his lap, his curiosity growing fast. Long slender fingers caressed the lit of the box, leaving behind a little trail of clean. The box was a bit dusty. He really shouldn't do this. When John found out he had been snooping around in his room again, he would be very mad. Not the kind of mad that made his skin the pretty shade of pink, but the kind of mad that made his voice harsh, increased the frowns on his forehead, and made his lips turn into a small stripe. The 'not good' kind of mad.
"Hello? Ow hello, Marc... Yes... And you? Great. Okay... No. I'm flattered, but I'm sorry. But that's something I don't do. And besides, it wouldn't be fair to the other students, would it?... Sure, no problem... Yes... I'll see you Tuesday. Good evening, Marc."
Did he just say that he loved him? John? No. This wasn't happening. This wasn't real. It was all an act. A cover they had made so they could investigate this case. This was not real.
Ava and Sherlock had just finished their dinner together. He brought another bottle of wine and they were drinking and smoking together, talking about their favourite music before there was a long silence between them.
Sherlock just nodded at that. Ava bent forward and took the pack of cigarettes from the desk. She lit one.
Energetically he stood up from the sofa, his blue dressing gown swinging dramatically around him, when he went towards the stairs to John's bedroom, barefooted as always.
"Of course. When I'm finished I'll turn you around and start on that side. After I've finished that too, we'll prepare you for the next round. Now, hold still."
John's smile got wider and he shook his head. At least three of butterflies in his stomach went completely bonkers.
John's face lit up when Sherlock entered the cafeteria. The man was really into character. Acting a bit clumsy, being open to everyone and smiling, (bloody fake, John could tell, but the rest seemed to accept it.) as if he enjoyed their company. He even lost a bit of his posh voice. John couldn't help but grin at it. This was definitely not the man he lived with. Sherlock joined John and Marc, and he did take an interest in the man's new car. (Or acted like it, to be precise.) Knowing what model it was and what it's consumption in urban cycle was. (Really, Sherlock?)
Its been months now since leaving you. Ten to be precise. Three hundred and four days. Four hundred thirty-seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-five minutes. I have been all over the world. From America to Taiwan, from Russia to Australia, from China to South Africa. Sitting in planes, roaming the streets, infiltrating in his network, taking it apart one piece at the time. It's so much bigger than I had estimated it would be, and it took me longer than I had expected. It should have been just a couple of months, sixty-one days, ninety at most. But I keep discovering more. I miss you. I miss you being beside me, I miss your company. I know I made the right decision, taking this one on my own, but I wished I could have taken you with me. Without you, I feel incomplete, alone.
The man said. Who was that? Why was he here? His head hurt like hell, and his thoughts seemed to spin in his head. Sherlock tried to open his eyes again, but it didn't work. He knew he had to go, he had to try to escape, he needed to find John. Sherlock tried to move again, pain spiking through his body. But then the man (Marc. Marc Jenkins. Art student, mid to end fifties, suspect in the missing art models case. Well, more than a suspect now.) Stamped his foot hard down on the inside of Sherlock's left knee. Sherlock felt something pop and tear, and with a scream he passed out for the fourth time.
“Of course not, john. Mycroft may have only sent you with me to keep an eye on me. But you know i work better with you on my side and there might be patients for you to treat. And you need to make a blog about it, don't you?”
They had to stop this investigation. It was too much. Sherlock felt as if his heart would explode out of his chest, and there was a huge headache coming up behind his eyes. He had trouble keeping the act and real life apart. That had never happened to him before.
Ava sight. The scratch on her cheek wasn't healing. There was a dark spot forming around it, and it itched. She put her hand down, realising that she was scratching it.
"Hey buddy! Good to see you here! Are you alone? Wait, I'll get us something to drink. You want a pint?"
Ava pressed the needle against the skin, and it went through easily. She emptied the syringe and pulled the needle carefully back out.
"I'm not surprised, really. But this one happened two days ago." Ava said, pointing to her cheek. Then she rolled up her sleeve, showing a bandaged arm underneath. She started to get the bandage off.
As soon as the man turned around to get the bartenders attention, John grabbed his phone and started typing.
"Mycroft send me the files of the developed medicine. Some brain scans from the monkeys with it. It seems like the infection only starts after the subject wakes up from the coma. At first they seemed to get better, but in a few days the brain activity reduces, to go back to a minimal within one week after the first signs. That means that the infected subjects are aware of the change at first."
"I've never seen you like this. All talking and laughing while on a case. And you even bought her her favourite wine. Sherlock, are you falling for her?"
Breath. Act normal. You're a grown man, he's a grown man. He's your roommate for God's sake! It's just Sherlock. Just ignore the heat settling in your stomach and groin. Don't think about all the things you want to do with him. Do not get aroused in a full classroom. You're not fifteen anymore.
It was the first thing he had said to him since leaving the art school Tuesday evening, if you didn't count in the 'Hmmm's'. And of course he was being the bloody mind reader again.
"We have a new case. Starting next week. I need you to come with me on every Tuesday and Thursday evening."
"Thank you, little devil. You gave me more than I would have ever hoped for. I'm living the happy life you wished for me, and I'm grateful for that. You have a special place in my heart, Ava. And I'll cherish you there until the end of my days."
As if he could. The angel was indeed an idiot. A pretty one, but still. He heard more than he saw the angel getting his jacket off. No sheet then, pity. The jacket was lied out over his body. It hurt. He moaned.
"Quite good, I have to say. You're the best male model we've had in years. You're body looks like it's made to be painted and your posing is spectacular. It's hard to find models of your age and physique. The last one disappeared before I could finish my work."
The next morning Sherlock put John to work at the village. They needed to be sure that the virus really didn't leave the lab, despite Ava's confirmation, and John wanted to catch up with Henry Knight, the man who got them here three years ago.
The man in front of him pumped himself up. He was big, but in the state he was in, he was never going to win a fight against John, and he knew it.
"I tried some. But it was never as satisfying as working with pencils. I'm not the type who can wait for paint to dry. And things like charcoal is too messy for me."
"Jesus Christ! You are unbelievable! Stay, fucking, still!" He heard the stool scrape over the floor again, and he braced himself. The man started hitting him and kicking him again. He really lost his temper now. It was just cruel. It hurt like hell. The man kicked him on the chest again, and then on his shoulder. He felt his left shoulder dislocate and he screamed with pain. It earned him an kick in his face, letting his already swollen lower lip spit, bleeding heavily.
The students stretched themselves and went out to the cafeteria or outside to smoke. Just like Tuesday, Sherlock first went to the back to put on his jumper and jacket, and he saw that John and the other students had already left the classroom when he reappeared. Only Esmeralda was still in the room, standing behind John's desk again, looking down at the sketch. Without looking up she signed Sherlock to come closer and have a look.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you. Unless you want you're life to stop tonight." He said to me. And something in that deep voice withheld me from getting in that car. It saved my life. The man was arrested two days later for murdering three prostitutes.
"Separated by a two inch glass wall, unable to feel your fingers touching mine, I even don't know how your voice sounds in real life, without an intercom or a phone line in between. And we never will."
"And you say that I am slow." John said, softly laughing, rolling his eyes. The anger on his face was gone.
John didn't answer. Instead he turned back to Sherlock and dropped himself on his knees next to him again.
Slowly he pushed the door open. He sneaked inside. The room was dark as night, and John couldn't see a thing. It smelled like acrylic paint, vomit, blood and urine. He softly closed the door behind him and searched for a light switch, hoping that it wouldn't lit up the whole garden. He reached with his hand across the wall next to the door until his fingers found what he was looking for. With the Browning steady in his left hand, he switched the light switch with his right.
John carefully put his drawing in his folder, and he when he stuffed his pencil box into his bag Sherlock was standing besides him.
Sherlock smiled and kissed the top of John's head. John lifted his head from Sherlock's shoulder. I'm going to see my parents grave. Do I see you there?"
John woke up. He turned himself onto his back, feeling his jeans turn around his waist and legs. Shit. He forgot to take them off last night. He squeezed an eye open and looked at his clock on the nightstand. Four forty six in the morning. Good. That meant he still had a few hours to go. He unbuttoned his jeans and wriggled himself out of them, pushing the jeans off the bed with his feet. He reached for his blanket to put over himself again and let himself enjoy the warmth of his bed and the silence of the early morning.
John grinned at his phone and wondered himself about the trust the genius had in him, when David put down a pint in front of him.
"True. Love looking at that arse of yours. And besides, are you in a hurry? If you don't want to sit model anymore you just have to say so..."
Sherlock turned towards the door of his dressing room and John finally managed to look away from him.
Observant as he was, Sherlock saw a slight tension coming up in the man's shoulders when he mentioned painting or drawing.
They talked. Ava explained where she was now, and told him everything she had found out about the virus. It confirmed the sheets of data Sherlock already had received from his brother. John came back and went off again to get Sherlock equipment he needed, so he could set up a lab at his side of the glass, with a computer that was linked to the machine's in the secured area. That way he could follow every test and experiment that Ava was doing. Every hour or so there was someone from the facility that came to check on them, but both Sherlock and Ava seemed to deep into their conversation to notice that. Deep in the night, with John fallen asleep in his chair, Ava started to yawn.
The leather belt hit his chest, arms and abdomen. Leaving behind no open wounds or cuts, just bruises. Sherlock felt his head spin from the pain, and he was now shamelessly moaning at every hit he got on his sore body, and when Marc hit him hard in the groin, he passed out.
"I thought it was a dream. I died and went to heaven. I already thought is was weird that the angel had your face. But dreams can be strange, can't they?"
Sitting still like this was harder than expected due to the cold in the room. Sherlock blocked out all the other students looking at him and concentrated only on John. He could stay still for hours looking at him. Normally he didn't get a chance to do it when John was awake. He always seemed to feel Sherlock's eyes boring at him, making the detective to look away. Almost always too late, but John didn't seemed to mind it.
"Sherlock! Wait!" John yelled after him. Sherlock pushed the people in his path towards the door aside, not slowing his pace.
John got up from his chair next to the hospital bed and walked towards the window, looking outside. It was dark out, and raining, of course, so there wasn't much to see.
David asked him, and started to grin when he realised how much that sounded like a bad opening sentence.
John didn't think anymore, he just reacted on that possessive heated gaze in Sherlock's eyes and actions. He put his right hand on Sherlock's arse, pulling that body even closer against his own, and his left hand went up to the back of Sherlock's head, his fingers gripping in his soft, dark curls, pulling him further down.
John said. His fingers had found those nipples and he pinched them between his finger and thumb. Sherlock moaned.
"Twelve fucking days. I got scratched by Daniel. That's when I called for help. And on the thirth day, you walked through that door."
John rushed upstairs towards his bedroom and thought about the most disgusting things that came to mind. After his starting erection decided that it wasn't going to challenge the things John was thinking about right now, he set himself to work, getting himself dressed for a proper night out.
"Quick. Get him on the stretcher. The morphine will keep him down." They covered Sherlock's body with an emergency blanket and pulled the stretcher down next to him.
Well, to be honest, he wasn't thinking at all. Seeing David hit on John had made him furious. There was just one thing on his mind at that moment.
"I'm getting there, just hear me out. I went from drug den to drug den searching for you. I was sure you were having a danger night. And in my search I met a woman named Nita."
“Ava, please. I have the feeling we will see each other a lot these next days to come. So just call me Ava. I would offer you two tea or coffee, but...” She signed at the glass wall between them.
"Good. Because you and me are going to make sure that this will never fall into his hands, or in anybody else's."
Sherlock showing his soft side (and something more.) John's getting warm (from both), But we can't blame him. Who can resist such a picture in front of them?
John tried to look impressed, but couldn't care less about the man's new MPV. John would be happy when they could return to their work. Even looking at Sherlock's way to attractive torso and hiding his blush was better than entertaining himself with this man. The man was bloody boring.
Carla tripped. The tray with coffee and tea fell from her hands, and before he knew it, John was covered in hot liquids.
David leaned a bit closer to John, as if he wanted to hear him better. Their shoulders touched for a second and Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the sight, feeling protective all of the sudden. He pushed the feeling back down and listened further to the man next to him. Once in the classroom, the students went to their desks to set up their working space, while Sherlock went to the back and took off his jumper and shirt underneath. Thank god the heater was working now. Tuesday he was freezing. (Although he would never admit it, of course.) Now the room felt nice. He folded his clothes onto the desk chair in the separate room before heading out to the classroom to take his place in the middle of the room again. He took the pose he had held Tuesday for over three hours, remembering it as if he did this on a daily basis. It earned him an approving smile from Esmeralda. She excused herself to the group for the cold from last class, and assured them that they would work the full four hours this time. After a few minutes the whole classroom was silent again. Only the soft tones of the classical background music, the sound of brushes and pencils over paper and canvas and the murmured advises of the teacher were there. Sherlock had planned to focus himself at the other students this time, but he did need to hold this pose. So his eyes were stuck on John again. Not that he was complaining about it. The man seemed to has forgotten everything around him. The pencil in his hand had become a piece of him instead of a tool to use. His eyes were focused and the tip of his tongue stroked his lips from time to time. It must be the same pose and focus that he used when he worked as a trauma surgeon. Just like Sherlock thought he would. It was fascinating.
Sherlock's torso was bare. The slender man walked towards the chair that was standing in the middle of the classroom and sat down on it. Esmeralda went towards him and gave him a pose. She made him stretch his back and made him put one arm to rest across the backrest and the left arm resting on his lap. John saw that his muscles were tight, bringing out the abs of his chest and abdomen. There were goose bumps all over his skin because of the cold, and when John's gaze settled on the man's hard nipples, he swallowed heavily and noticed that his mouth was hanging open. He snapped his mouth shut, feeling his cheeks getting red.
Sherlock grinned as he crouched by the body, observing her jewellery (clean necklace, dirty ring except from polished interior: adulteress), her coat (wet collar, dry umbrella), her nails (bright pink to match her coat, the left-hand nails scratched from her carving into the wooden floorboards). He quickly researched something on his phone, before looking at the word next to her hand: rache. German, noun: revenge. Motive? Unlikely. He thought of the possibilities for what else it could mean – was she intending to write more, before her inconveniently timed death? Yes.
"I - okay. Maybe he's a bit right. But that's only because Lucy got me into them. I have to be supportive of her likes and hobbies, don't I?"
They make their way up the stairs, attempting to stifle their giggles and guffaws at their private jokes as they enter the flat.
Their time was nearly up, so they hugged one last time, before Mary left to take her place in the audience. Sherlock went to wish him luck.
“They’re not technically theatre kids,” John points out. “They’re just friends of Harry and Irene. Or friends of friends.”
The cold December air hit his face hard as he left the crowded, heated castle. With one hand puling his cloak further around him for warmth, he took his wand out and cast a lumos charm, allowing him to see that little bit better. "Sherlock?" He called. No one replied. He walked slowly, skirting the castle walls, calling Sherlock's name. Finally, he heard a deep slurred voice reply back, "John?" John breathed a sigh of relief, approached where he heard the voice, and saw Sherlock slumped against the wall, his head leant back and swaying ever so slightly. "I knew you'd turn up eventuallly?" Sherlock slurred, a slow careless smile crawling drunkenly onto his face
"Relax, it's probably going to be something easier." Mary said, placing her hand on his. "I'll talk to Janine, see if she knows anything."
"Fine. Congratulations." Mary stood up, leaving her breakfast, "I hope you two will be very happy together."
Still, he didn't understand why dressrobes were obligatory, when muggle tuxedos were so much more comfortable and didn't make him look like an out-of-place barrister, fresh from the court room, whose robes were too long for him. He thought with envy about how much more freedom the girls had with their outfits. He recalled those lunchtimes Mary spent talking to Janine, grinning excitedly as they squealed in rapid french and made flowing hand actions describing the shapes of their dresses. John managed to pick up words like 'bleu' and 'jusqu'à mes chevilles', whatever that meant. Meanwhile, as far as he could see from watching the boys sharing his dormroom opening similar packaging, all the boys had to wear the exact same styles and colours as each other, the only variety being whether that boy suited their outfit.
“In part. Technically I’m the god of spring. Rebirth and healing comes as part of the package deal, I suppose.”
"Well, speak of the devil," Sherlock whispered to John. He then spoke to the girl. "Mary, I assume?"
Sherlock shook his head. "You've made me watch too many terrible sci-fi films for me to not come to the conclusion that if we went back all those years and reversed our decisions - if I didn't go to the bar to meet victor, if you didn't help your sister, if I had gone to rehab earlier, if you had not enlisted in the armies - something awful would replace it instead. Things are fine as they are now."
“Yes. Cabin fever was starting to settle in after several thousand years in the underworld. So I’m just taking a look around Earth for the next month or so, at my brother’s insistence that I socialise with people other than the dead.”
“So am I,” he shrugs. “You and Rosie could never be an imposition. I’d be happy to help in any way I can.”
Sherlock bit his lips and felt his face heat with shame. "A bit. Partially. I had other reasons too that still have to be taken into account."
Please, write back as soon as you can. Or call. I would call but if your parents picked up I’m not sure how likely it is for them to pass the message on.
“No one! I swear it! I’m just a jogger! I have a route, you know,” John spluttered out, his heart beating wildly as he wondered what the hell had happened in the last few months to make Sherlock like this. (And also, if it was weird that he was turned on a little bit.)
"8 years old. So he's getting on a bit. He - he's slow. I don't know how he managed to run away. I mean, I do know, we left the gate open when we left for my aunt's house. No, I left the gate open. So it's my fault."
Suddenly remembering that most humans don’t see three-headed dogs in their lifetime, he covers two of the heads in a mist no mortal can see through, leaving him looking tragically normal.
He knocks on the door of the bathroom as Sherlock brushes his teeth, dressed in pyjamas with the t-shirt inside out. When John raises a questioning eyebrow, Sherlock sighs and hisses quietly, "The tag irritates my skin!" John giggles slightly, making sure to keep quiet for the people in the flat sleeping. As they brush their teeth, their shoulders bump, sending warm tingles up John's spine in the quiet comfort of the room.
Train journeys are going to be hell, going back and forth between home and uni for hours on end, with little to occupy my time. But it will be worth it if it means I can see you again.
"Seeing as this is our last full day together before September, I was wondering if we could just spend it here."
"Your reaction when I told you about my old addiction says you've had medical training, or at least trained to be objective when dealing with medical issues - and the ink on your hand says you do a lot of writing - probably for prescriptions."
One by one, the players joined in with the complaining, until the entire crowd of them were yelling about how disgraceful this was, what a waste of time this was, how they didn't turn down the Royal Albert Hall for this, until John sighed, then barked out, "Enough!" in his best Captain John Watson voice. The room immediately fell silent. John could feel Sherlock's gaze next to him, burning into his skull, but he ignored it for now. "Unless you want this performance to have no orchestra, and for you to have no pay for this gig, get in a line. Now."
Later, he would wish that he was shot for a good cause, saving someone's life - a father of two perhaps, or a daughter with an elderly relative, or a nineteen-year-old with their whole life ahead of them.
Sherlock smiled at him before going back to eating his breakfast. He did that a lot since the day before, smiling.
"We did, zank you, Professor Migonagall." Madam Maxime emphasised every syllable. "Alzough, ze wezzer is... Colder zan my students and I expected."
The string of pulls him further and further into the hospital, down corridors until he comes across an emergency surgery room. Perfect. A bit of entertainment, whether the mortal lives or dies. Perhaps he’ll go to dinner once the show is finished.
After two months of hearing stories of cases, latching onto every word of every high-speed chase, every deduction, every plot twist like a dying man draining the last drops of water in his supply, John finally gets invited to a crime scene.
“Do you, though? I thought some things were obviously worth repeating. Like not running towards a group of criminals when I specifically told you to wait!”
“There’s nothing that you could do that could possibly put me off. Yeah, you’re a bit annoying when you experiment with body parts and play violin in the middle of the night and don’t tell me what’s going on in cases. But you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me. Bar none. I’m not going to leave you. Not for anything.”
Nothing of the usual post-case high, making him light and giggly like he’d downed two flutes of champagne. No satisfaction that it was a job well done, restoring balance to the universe with the arrest of the killer. Only the gaping, hollow, loneliness that had resided like a parasite inside him since the morning John shipped out for Afghanistan, eight months ago.
That night, he dreamt for the first time of bullets flying past him, bombs exploding by him, each step he took bringing more dangers and fatalities, but each time John was left standing. He dreamt of the man whose life he couldn't save, and all the others he had let himself forget in the chaos of war.
"Of course." Sherlock pulls out a police badge from his pocket and John's eyes widen. "GOt it from Lestrade. I pickpocket him when he's being annoying. Don't worry, I have another one here if you want it."
"Where were you then?" John hadn't meant to sound accusing, but Sherlock winced nonetheless, so John breathed out slowly and apologised. "Can we just start simple? Did you eat while you were gone?" John's eyes traced Sherlock's face - Sherlock knew that his cheekbones were now ever more prominent, the dark bags swollen under his eyes, the pale skin that had, since John last saw him, grown ashen and dry. Sherlock felt his face heat up guiltily. "My mother got me to eat sometimes."
“Oh.” Sherlock’s fingers twitch, clench into a fist by his side, suddenly self-conscious. “And it’s… not a pleasant smell?”
Irene: Or that I was going to say anything. Can’t a girl compliment her friend without an agenda or ulterior motive?
Besides, Sherlock had been very clear on the first night - married to his work, he said. As John had insisted - it was all fine. If Sherlock no longer wanted or was no longer in a relationship, that wasn't his fault. It just wasn't meant to be.
They enter the flat and go to separate rooms to change. John had insisted that Sherlock really didn't need to - he always looks like he was going to a semi-formal event anyway - but Sherlock had shaken his head insistently. "Unless you want me in sweaty clothes that have been on a stuffy train, I'm changing. Besides, social etiquette generally dictates that the colour scheme..."
John chuckles, “of course. Just keep her head supported and you’ll be fine.” John gently hands her over into Sherlock’s arms, and Sherlock emits a small gasp of surprise.
John comes out of his room a little while later, refreshed and in new clothes - a blue shirt he had worn every year since he was fourteen, and still managed to fit into, though rugby playing had made it tighter, straining around his biceps and chest.
Thank you so much for every hit, kudos, bookmark, comment, recommendation, etc, etc. I've honestly really enjoyed writing this so I hope you've enjoyed reading it to.
“Really? Oh, so he has. Didn’t realise.” Liar, Sherlock thinks with amusement. “Best stitch him up just in case.” And just to confirm Sherlock’s suspicions, the doctor looks up with dark blue eyes that widen in recognition as they look straight. At. Sherlock.
“Come in,” an impatient voice demanded from within, which John obeyed. When he entered, the actor in question was sat at his dressing room table, spiking his hair up with gel into a style he seemed at least ten years too old for.
"Worse comes to worst, we shout the answers at you from the audience." Mary shrugged, "Just give us each a share of the ten-thousand galleon prize at the end."
"Silence!" The hall obeyed. "I know you all must be very disappointed, but believe me when I say it is for a very good cause. This year, Hogwarts will be host to the tri-wizard tournament." That was when people started to realise what was going on and responded excitedly - chatting and grinning amongst themselves.
Mycroft wasn't the only one who felt the need to comment on Sherlock's feelings. When he went down to breakfast the next morning, Janine was staring at him sadly. He looked for John, to find that he was at the other end of the hall, with Mary, Greg and Molly. Sherlock sat next to Janine.
“Johnny!” John immediately sat up at the sound of his sister’s voice, which was hysterical and hoarse, as though she had been crying. “I’ve been trying to reach you all morning.”
John curiously skims through the previous pages of the notebook and finds pages upon pages of observations of Sherlock's own behaviour after so many hours of sleep, about how levels of caffeine and blood sugar affected this, how efficiently he was able to work on cold cases and cases from clients. The man leads a fascinating life, something that seems more out of a work of fiction than reality.
"Yeah. That alright? We can go back if you want. Or forwards, rather. Can't be much fun preventing the murders your career relies on."
"Oh, I can do much more than that," Sherlock replied confidently. "The state of someone's marriage, for example. The addictions they've been hiding from their family. How many siblings they have. Affairs, scandals, crimes. It's surprising how common these people are. People who hide things."
Sherlock laughed and it stabbed at John's chest even more. A sardonic chuckle was one thing: a genuine laugh was so rare and so beautiful-sounding John always smiled back. If he could, he would bottle that laugh so that he could listen to it whenever his dad started drinking or Harry was shouting the house down.
"It doesn't have to be...cult-like. Just... gather friends and family around and say a couple of things about all the good times you had with Redbeard."
indeed. This time he was sure it absolutely would be. No back-pedalling like the first time at Angelo’s, just waiting, subtle hints, testing the waters until the right moment came.
"Minor details. If you go back to her, it would stall her from leaving the country and give Mycroft time to find out more. Currently, all she has keeping her here is the baby. Once she's born..."
The last thing he saw before everything went black was Moran shooting red sparks into the air with John's wand, then him tossing it at the ground in front of John and disapperating in a cloud of black smoke.
Also, my morale has been somewhat boosted by what you said on our last phone call. The bit about ‘when’ we’ll meet, that is. I hope it’s not too presumptuous to say, but I would like us to meet soon. After exams are finished, preferably, but I am definitely not opposed to sooner.
"Ugh. How disgustingly romantic of you." Sherlock turned away from John in a dramatic display of disapproval, while John grinned and pressed himself closer, his chest against Sherlock's back, an arm flung over his waist.

I think this year my friends may be bringing their soulmates too, if they can get them to agree to come. We don't have to go to it, if you'd prefer to do something else, but I thought it would be a good idea to throw that idea out there. If you have any other ideas, don't hesitate to say.

He was extraordinary. Not something to lose easily without losing a part of himself.
“Not specifically. It seems that this order of events geld for all infected individuals. They want me to take a look at the medicine, and see if i can manage to help make an antidote.”
"Well... thanks... Yes... I just... I forgot to bring something to take it home with me. But, I can just leave it here. We will work further on this Thursday, don't we?"
