Steve ran this all through his head. He definitely checked the first box, as he was free and clear of the army. He wasn’t even dating someone right now. Whether he had the strength and talents remained to be seen. He didn’t know enough of Tony Stark to make that judgement yet. That third clause, though, that was the kicker. Steve did like to be committed to a cause, or at least dedicated to something he could believe in. Tony’s magic had somehow picked up on that? From across the continent? But why link Tony and Steve? Just who
“Uh, yes, that’s currently how I’m paying the bills and just how comfortable are you with mages that you can recognize an artificer’s workshop in a glance? And, sorry, back up but did you say shot at? People shoot at you?”
Tony snorted. Magical power wasn’t the issue. He’d measured himself often in the early days, trying to understand why his magic wasn’t performing like everyone else’s. Power had never been the problem. But he humored Rhodey because he didn’t want to argue that, too. “Sure, I’ll call you in if I need to. Let’s just get this over with.”
Okay, that Tony couldn’t let stand. He hopped off the stool and went towards it immediately, studying it better. He lifted it in his hands, felt the solid weight of it, but saw too the construction. The spells integrated in with the cold metal. “Wow. Seriously, wow, I’ve not seen something constructed like this. It’s pure vibranium, the highest concentration I’ve ever seen. And you’ve got some serious spellwork in this thing. A call to home tied in with your blood—seriously? You have a shield acting like a carrier pigeon? Who even thought of that? And there’s reinforcement spells, not that you likely need them on a vibranium shield. And a beacon spell, I assume so mages can target on you. Shit, Steve. Who
Excuse an evil chuckle.
A knock at his door signaled that someone was coming into this lab. Workspace, whatever you wanted to call it. Pepper voted for carnage-in-distress. Rhodey was more apt in calling it a horror-show. Tony hadn’t heard high heels on the stone steps outside his door, so it was likely Rhodey braving his doorway. “Come in!”
It was a motorized skiff, the engine large and hanging over the back side of it. Steve had never seen the design before, but he had no chance to study it. He and Tony loaded quickly into the narrow skiff, finding seats on the two benches on either side, and Marsha maneuvered to the back, her hand on the lever jutting out of the engine. It fired up with a roar, Steve yanked the line mooring, pulled it into the boat, and they were off.
With a sigh, he let the letter fall into his lap. Really, he couldn’t act surprised. He’d known this day was coming. It was just annoying that it had happened today and not some other day when he could ignore it. Well, annoying wasn’t likely the right word. This had some pretty serious implications.
“I can stay longer,” Steve returned amiably.
“I know—we
Tony blinked up at him comically. “You’re taking this rather well.”
“Oh, you have a defense this time?” Rhodey made his way around the cluttered work bench and tried, rather in vain, to find a spot where to put the tray down.
“We weren’t sure of that ourselves.” Steve’s eyes turned blind in memory. “We didn’t go looking for that fight. But it came to us regardless. Every able-bodied man was called to enlist. I tried, but I wasn’t fighting fit, not then. I had two terrible health conditions that barred me from it. As the war progressed, they were desperate for more soldiers, and the mages started putting their heads together. Trying to find ways to heal people, take in the ones not healthy enough to serve, and get them to a strong state. I volunteered for one of their pilot programs. It was touch and go for about three months, but one of the mages made a breakthrough. It worked on me and worked well. I became what you see now.”
Snorting, Tony denied, “I wish. No. A familiar-mage bond would not change how my magic works, more’s the pity. It comes incredibly handy when I’m working on something, though. I can see the strength and weakness in any metal I’m crafting, for instance.”
Tony pulled his keys from a pocket to open his apartment door, talking as he jiggled the lock. “Of course, I’ve also been known to catch sight of something shiny and drift to a stop while I stare at it. Drives both Rhodey and Pepper insane.”
The mage had both hands over his face as if he were beyond pained. “Rhodey, just kill me.”
Tony evaluated him for a long second. Something about Steve’s confidence must have sold him, as an answering smile spread over his face. “You know, I think you can, at that. Alright, let’s do it. I’ll probably need a full minute on this.”
“You came out to help Tony, I take it?”
Rhodey kept going, not letting Tony sidetrack him. “—but summoning a familiar is the basics. The very, very basics and even your magic doesn’t completely screw up the basic magic tenants. Every time,” he muttered that last words.
“A soldier,” Tony breathed, and the proverbial light flicked on in his dark eyes. “Gods above, of course. Of course.” He abruptly turned, words tripping over themselves as he explained, “My magic is strange. It doesn’t work like any other mage you’ve likely seen, it can’t do creation magic to save my life. I actually put that to the test once and failed miserably—”
“Morning,” Henry returned. An amiable man with a fatherly paunch and bushy mustache, Henry always seemed right on the verge of a smile. “Your timing is good, Tony. This stupid contraption is acting up again.”
“No chance in hell, not with magic at least, which is why I use other means. Guns and I are friends.” Tony swallowed hard, eyes still locked on Steve. “You said you’re were a soldier? As in no longer?”
Tony’s default was to talk when he didn’t really know what he was doing, so his mouth was running full speed ahead even as he locked the front door. “—two different clothing stores that I think might have things in your size, as you’re rather tall and those awesome shoulders are definitely going to give us problems in the shirt department. But I think we can find things to work. I swear, I probably don’t need to keep you more than a week, maybe less, maybe more, but there’s a lot about what happened last night that flat out doesn’t make sense to me.”
“Sorry I had to destroy the complete net.” Tony gestured to the blank space.
Steve’s expression relaxed, transitioning into a slight smile. “I like this one. What do you think, Tony?”
back in harbor.”
“Yeah. In a nutshell.” Tony’s eyes were sharp on him, evaluating. “Most people, when they see me do it the first time, they’re many things but not amazed.”
Midway through on the second, he flickered to life and found that Steve was watching him in amusement. He stared back, slurped another mouthful of his caffeine goodness. “I have an epic bedhead, don’t I?”
He turned in place and walked, not precisely quickly, as he was enjoying the air and anonymity. And he liked to walk and think. Certainly he had a lot to think about.
Tony’s head snapped around. A portly man was frantically waving over his head with one arm even as he ran toward them.
Rhodey seemed to think that Steve had been called for a reason. That Tony’s magic had brought him, specifically him. Steve was rather of the opinion to agree, for several reasons. One, magic didn’t do arbitrary things without a reason. Sometimes the caster didn’t give the right instructions, granted, and they got a strange result. But that didn’t mean magic did things willy-nilly. So if there was nothing wrong with the spell Tony cast, and he’d gotten Steve?
Rhodey startled as Tony stood, heading to a clear(ish) patch of floor. “Wait, now? You want to do it right now?”
Tony Stark, anyway?
“Truly? Those kind of mishaps happen when you travel.”
Snorting, Steve unclamped and let Tony find his own feet. “That was amazing, Tony. I’m still in shock. That’s what your magic can do?”
Sure enough, it was Rhodey that slipped through, carrying a tray of something that looked like food. There was an exasperated expression on his friend’s face as he asked archly, “Did you order food from the café across the street and forget again?”
Steve didn’t need to be given directions. He put a hand on Tony’s shoulder and requested, “Two seconds.” Then he charged up the narrow stairs, threw his clothes onto the couch, snatched up the shield he hadn’t bothered to take this morning, and rushed right back down.
Yes, Tony, Steve is more than a pretty face and awesome body. Pay attention now.
“I’m not going to fall over.” Probably. Odds were good, at least. Tony prudently went back to the bar and sat down in a stool to lower the odds further. His balance was a little impaired some days.
Tony flashed him a quick smile, but it was strained. “I’d appreciate it.”
It didn’t sit well with him, not knowing where he was. It was like an itch under the skin, needing to know the lay of the land. So he walked along the sidewalk, head turning as he took in his surroundings. A port city, it looked like, as the sea was right past the road. The wind was brisk, carrying the hint of salt and water. It reminded him a little of home, as Brooks on Lynn was also by the sea. Familiar, but jarring, as his city was packed in tight. Here, it was more spread out with space between buildings and gardens. Sometimes they were mini gardens, just boxes outside of windows, but gardens regardless. And it was warmer here. Back home was usually cool, especially this time of the season. They were heading into fall. But the air against his face made it feel more like the beginning of summer.
Tony bit his lip, eyes roving over the fit body in front of him. “Steve, what he did…that wasn’t just to heal you. Your musculature is changed, enhanced to a staggering level. Your reflexes and nerves, too. He tapped into your healing ability as well, literally supercharged it. I bet it’s hard to truly injure you.”
Steve finally moved from his spot. He only had a flimsy grasp on the situation, and it did feel utterly surreal to him, no lie there. But he wasn’t a person that sat still under any circumstances. So he moved, towards this strange man that had accidentally summoned him. Lifting a hand, he pinched the man’s cheek and waggled it gently back and forth. “Not a dream, I think.”
Steve had to parse through some of that but he got the gist. “So, let me understand this properly. You’re a mage-in-training, which means you’re at the stage of summoning a familiar? Which you attempted, and got me?”
Steve thought about that. How disorienting that must be, how confusing it probably became. It tied into his second question, of how a regular familiar could even begin to cope with Tony’s talent. Familiars were always smart, of course they were, but to that degree? Steve had seen magicians in action, in the thick of battle. He’d guarded more than a few as they worked because the magic was too complex for a quick one-off spell. Their familiars, try as they might, couldn’t fully protect a stationary mage while they worked. Tony did complex magic all of the time, that was his norm. Frankly, the idea of a normal familiar guarding this man chilled Steve’s blood.
“About twenty minutes ago, they realized the problem!” Marsha answered, eyes intent on the water as she drove them past the other shipping vessels in the round harbor. “They were coming back in with a haul of fish, I think they assumed they had a mother catch!”
It was a man.
“I can see how that would be helpful,” Steve allowed.
Their shopping trip gave Steve new questions. Three, in fact, although he had a feeling he might not get an immediate answer to the third one. But the first two seemed like something that he could ask Tony about.
Steve stared back at him, eyes locked as he tried to read this man. Tony couldn’t use a grimoire? But all mages used grimoires, it’s how they managed to use spells in quick succession. It must be hell to have to create a spell every single time. And three minutes? “If something attacked you, you couldn’t begin to protect yourself.”
Oops. “In my defense—”
Tony peeked at him from the side of his eye. “Try what? What can I possibly try at this stage?”
“Well, buy enough clothes that I can afford to replace it, and I’ll do so,” Henry joked as he always did. “And who’s your friend?”
“Fine,” he decided on a whim. “Fine, let’s do it.”
The upstairs was living quarters. Living quarters in need of a broom, as whoever stayed here didn’t really clean up after themselves. Tony immediately headed to a side cabinet under a window, pouring himself a glass of some amber liquid before knocking that back and pouring himself a second. Rhodey budged him with a soft hip check to pour himself a glass even as he asked Steve, “Want one?”
“I keep telling you, you need to upgrade it to a newer model.” Even as he said the words, Tony was heading around the long counter to get a look at the register. It was older than he and Henry combined, the gears slowly stripping away. He’d taken a look at it more than once, replacing something or other.
“Right. So let’s get you at least a week’s worth of clothes to tide you over. Uh, Henry’s store, let’s start there. And if someone asks, you weren’t summoned, you’re just a friend of a friend that I’m showing around, okay?”
“I’ll still do that for you. Because I know this place means a lot to you, and it’s a good way for you to work. Hell, Pepper said she’d do it if you promised not to drive her insane. But Tony,” here Rhodey ducked sideways, trying to catch his eye, “I want you to try just one thing first.”
“You’re in Calin,” Rhodey answered slowly. “Where are you from, Steve?”
Two men stared back at him. One of them was clearly the mage that had brought him here, as the magic swirled around his extended hands, connecting him to the spell. Steve stared at him, perplexed by all this. He was a nice enough looking man, dark hair with some wave to it, golden skin, a goatee around his mouth. If he were much older than Steve himself, he’d eat his boots.
Steve nodded immediately in agreement. “I’m not a fan of pain myself. Are you confident you can figure it out?”
“Let’s sit down, first. I think we all need alcohol for this conversation.” Rhodey turned around and headed for a staircase, as comfortable doing as if he owned the place.
“I’m peachy keen,” Tony answered, once again tilting his head up to look at Steve. “You?”
Looking at Steve reminded him just how long ago his last encounter had been.
Steve got smiles and nods of hellos, curious looks from the people that he passed by. He smiled and nodded back, and it was nice. Being able to do that without someone taking a second look, as if he were familiar. The papers had liked to splash his picture because he was photographic and one of the few super-soldiers that made a difference in the war. And while in the war, it hadn’t really mattered if they’d written up articles on him. Steve had been focused on keeping people safe and defeating his enemies.
“Get in already!” the brunette ordered even as she hopped down.
The same man that had greeted them earlier approached, a smile stretching from ear to ear. “Tony Stark, you are the man of the hour. Thank you so much.”
Tony grimaced a smile. “Unfortunately. I assume they tried to cut the lines?”
“I’m really not trying to pry here, there’s just things I need to verify. You said you don’t have anyone waiting at home for you?” That made no sense to Tony. The man was gorgeous, for one, why didn’t he have a lover waiting on him? Friends? Someone, anyone. And more than that, Steve was
“So, can I ask how your bag got into the water?”
I’M GONNA DIE! I haven’t even gone to class and I’m already gonna die!
“See you’re enjoying this, Rogers”, Tony says with a sly smile as he rubbed against him a little harder, earning a deep groan from the taller blond. “I came all the way here. So, before my mood changes. Let’s - ”.
They finally found an old looking door, it looks abandoned from the outside. Tony gazed back to Bruce who gave him a nod, agreeing to enter the room. They were soon blinded by the colorfulness of the room filled with decorations of bright lights and an amazing set up. It was like a penthouse suite.
“Girls should get it in their head that perfect guys like from the TV dramas and books don’t exist. Ever”, saying that he let out a frustrated sigh.

“That’s right. Mom was always busy with her work from morning till night so I also had to learn how to make food and clean up. She taught me in her free time. I’m not good at making food yet but it makes me really happy when I get it right sometimes and see the smile on her face when she eats it”, he said with a sad tone and had all the undying attention of the girls.
From: Tony Stark
If you’re male, liking someone would imply looking at her face first, followed by her legs and then her chest I guess. What else is there to love? Tony thought gazing out of the classroom window besides his seat. He was the senior most in the school being a third year. His classroom was also located on the third floor as well. Talk about coincidence.
“Got it~”, he laughed.
“Thought you’d still prefer to climb. If you did though, I’ll be here ready to catch you again”
“I’ll keep that in mind then. I’m Tony by the way”
Tony picked out a black and grey ball boot. “This looks pretty cool”, he said handing it to the blonde. Steve looked over to the brunette and smiled at his choice. “That is nice. I’ll try it on then”
“That’ll be 20 dollars with tax. Here you go”, the guy told him as he handed the pizza to Steve as Tony searched around for his wallet he can’t seem to locate on him.
“No, we’re not. He just happens to save me when I fell down trying to get in here. He just likes to tease me about that, the annoying bastard”, he denied.
“That bastard’s gonna pay for what he did to Tony”, Clint stated, anger boiling up in him.
“Another job well done”, he hummed to himself. Now that he had finished the last job for the day he wondered what he should do next. Since it was late it would be a bother to go back to New York so he decided to stay in Brooklyn for the night. But where? He knew a few people who would gladly let him stay over but he could also easily book a room in a five star hotel. Money wasn’t a problem. He
Tony’s eyes widened at those words. “Hey, lemme ask you something”, he started looking down at his fingers, interlocking them nervously, feeling a bit awkward as well, “Are we supposed to be dating right now?”, he asked with a stupid expression plastered on his face.
Steve was bombarded with his teammates and the girls who were coming onto the playing field. Congratulating him and some even trying to kiss him which he sincerely declined.
‘Ugh, too much positive energy for me to handle so early in the morning’, he thought with a wince.
“How could we not, Tony? You practically give off the aura of pure joy right from first period”, Pepper stated.
“So, are you gonna share or do we have to find out ourselves?”, Pepper said poking at Tony’s side. Tony dug into his school bag for the letter, handing it to his friends with a grin plastered on his face. They opened, read it and soon both of them had the same expression as their friend.
From the moment he stepped into the school this guy is extremely popular with all the girls.
Tony caught by surprised slipped off his grip on the railing. He shut his eyes tightly, was sure he was gonna hit the ground and broke a bone or something but the pain never came as he felt himself being caught by a pair of strong arms. Adrenaline rushed through his whole body, his heart pounding loudly in his chest.
Why? Why can’t I be more determined about this? He thought, clenching his fist slightly which Tony noticed.
“Nonsense”, saying that Tony reached out to put some of his food on Bruce’s plate. Bruce ran away, blocking his plate from Tony. The boy ran after him, laughing but soon food himself tripping on a leg and dropping his plate. The room was soon filled up with snickers and mocking laughs. Tony realized one of them had intentionally tripped him up. He got up, determined to give them a piece of his mind but then saw his lunch splattered on the floor and to his horrid realization on someone as well. Not just someone but a very angry looking classmate Tony had nicknamed as Metal hand. It was James Buchanan Barnes.
Shoving the last piece of his Shawarma Tony replied with a smile that it was alright.
Noticing the loosely held cup with its content almost spilling on the smaller boy’s hand Steve pried it off from his hold and put it down on the nearby cup holder. He then gazed at the figure sleeping calmly on his shoulder. Tony had a peaceful expression.
Steve’s car was a Mercedes Benz E- class. The inside was great. The seats were very comfortable. The inside of the car was warmer but Tony felt a shiver. He wished that he was home soon; take a warm bath and sleep. Steve noticed the subtle chattering of teeth so he took off his blazer and put it around the smaller boy’s shoulder.
“Just leave it to me, Steven. I will take care of it. You do not need to worry”, Thor told him as he put a hand on Steve’s shoulder in a reassuring manner and gave a warm smile. Steve thanked him and handed him the paperwork. Thor waved them goodbye and went on his merry way, greeting people loudly as he go.
“It’s fine ladies. Here, I’ll drink it first”, the blonde said taking a sip. The room went silent as the rest watched in anticipation. Steve stood frozen at his place, looking as if he’s deep in thought.
Tony let out a breath he didn’t even know he had held back, sighing in relief. “I thought I was dying for sure. Oh my god….”
“Now everyone will know how you tried to assault me and you will soon find your poor self being expelled once my brother and I post this around school”, Wanda said with a sly smirk.
“Don’t get carried away”, he bit out at the brunet who was squirming under his hold.
“Steve….”, Tony started, his voice hoarse from crying. “Steve…I don’t want to forget you…I don’t….Steve”, he continued in a shaky, barely audible voice as he pressed further into the crook of Steve’s neck. It brought tears to the super soldier’s eyes. He couldn’t help it. He doesn’t want that either. He wants Tony to keep the memories of them together. To remember how much he loved the genius, to never forget. He wants Tony to love him, always.
"I do not think liking would be the case. More like 'I bet you a fortune on you'. And stop calling me sir. I'm not that old", the blond said, looking humorous. "Just Steve is fine".
Captain's focus returned to the bad guys. He was getting closed when lot of wood took his vision camp. He maneuvered and jumped between the trunks. With Tony there the double of precaution had to be taken. Steve saw the ramp in the backs of a truck and used that as lever. They jumped ahead another cars. Something fast was getting closer on his rearview. He raise the left arm and grabbed his shield. He felt complete now. One more time he pressed the metal. His jacket felt the squeeze of Tony getting tigher. Cap prepared another jump. He flyed above the persecuted, and turn the vehicle to be in front of them. When the thiefs doesn't stop, Steve launched the shield. The bikers fell on the track. One of them was able to reach for a gun and directed to the blond man. Rogers tried to get away of their vision camp when a red and gold metal got in front of him. The sound of a bullet rebounding on the armor was heard.
"Relaxing, don't you think?", said Steve, looking up in frustration at the young man who just laughed.
"I saw what you did. Well, everyone saw it". It looked like the opponent had finally reached its goal.
In front of his house, Steve already carries three squirrels and two rabbits, a result of the traps that his father taught him when he was small. The forest, as a source of survival, also proved to be an escape.  A place where the wickedness of the capital, the destruction and poverty of the country, could not seem to touch.  Steve always saw himself as calm and it seemed to connect with the sound of trees and birds.
In the moment Tony already got close to the blond. Rogers almost forget that he was mad at Tony. Almost.
Tony and Steve were late. Nick Fury really wasn't happy. But he never was, remembered Stark. The others Avengers looked bored, except Rhodes and Natasha who probably would kill someone on the room.
Screams and exclamations caught the attention of Rogers, the program had begun. Caesar looked more excited than ever.
The venom of those snakes acted very fast, Steve realized. In a few minutes his ankle will begin to swell, his breath starting to wheeze.  He felt on fire. The heat rising from his leg was desperate. Three cannons were heard in the sky. By their accounts, there were still seven tributes in the competition.  Soon, he realized, there were be only six of them.
"Wow! Very straightforward", Stark couldn't help but get suprised by the aproach. "I expected a thank you to begin with.  But 'why'? Good question, actually". Stark pretended to think. "You are ... hmm ... pretty handsome!?". Tony made the first attempt.
It was still dawn when they saw a dark silhouette. The careerist. The man should not be more than 22 years old. He was one of those who volunteered only for the desire to become a winner. The boy's hands were adorned with a long machete and a large ax. His tanned face contrasted with his planted, almost white hair. His eyes indicated an expression of psychopathy. Steve felt sorry for him. The games influenced more than anyone could imagine.
The first day of training was intense. When he arrived at the training center, Steve was easily intimidated by the great careerists who spun and jumped like mortal assassins. Not that Rogers showed that. He needed to look like he knew what he was doing. District 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 tributes were the oldest.  All over 22 years. The others were just kids. He decided not to think about it now.
One day passed and no sign of the careerist. No cannon sounded. Surely the capital should be bored one more time. Steve's thoughts seemed to be read. Peter was sitting next to the grown man when he felt a breeze blow through his brown hair. At that moment, the men were already on their feet. The breeze turned to gale. And the gale became a kind of intelligent tornado. Their instinct was to run once again. Around him twigs and stones were sucked into the event, making it even more deadly. If they stopped for only a second, it would be overwhelmed by the artificial event. The young men hit trees and shrubs. They noticed scratches covering their faces as the air grew heavier. They had come out of the forest. They were led to the cornucopia. They did not have to be a genius to realize that the idealizers wanted to end the games where they started.
"Do not call me like that". The blonde grabbed his backpack and continued walking.
Even so, when a tall, young, blond and impressively strong man for one of the poorer districts volunteered for the games, Tony can not contain the admiration. Of course, he had seen many volunteers. Only in this edition three men and one woman ran to show the world how brave and honored they were. Where was the honor in annihilating children for pure fun Tony had not yet been able to find out. And he was a genius.  The fact is that with Steve Rogers, it seems that was the name of the volunteer, was different.  The man's gaze showed no joy or excitement, showed determination, pain, and hurt.
- I was talking to Romanoff - answered the dark hair easily and took a seat besides Bruce and Steve. He received only a look as warning by the ex-assasin. He liked to remember the "ex" part.
The mechanic kept the focus on his image in the book that he holds now. - I didn't know you draw me - confusion and admiration mixed in his voice.
- Hey Cap - answered the genius with heavely breath as he closed the gap between their lips.
"Your biggest problem will be the careerists. You look strong but you have not been trained like them", the winner began. "Do not underestimate them, and you may be able to survive for more than two days."
I was not in a certain death situation right now, at least I did not think so. Picking up the object, he saw that another note was there.  "Go west. Take the pill. Do not die," once again signed by the 'Mechanic'. He really needed to find out who that person was. Sponsors could not provide tips on the arena.  Just help with food or medicine.  Whoever the mechanic might be, that person was probably in great danger. Along with the piece of paper, a small round pill and a vase with water. He hoped it was not poison and threw it in his mouth. A wave of energy passed through his body and he felt incredibly aroused. So that was the function of the medicine. The mechanic seemed to have heard his thoughts.
“You’re exaggerating, Clint. Sorry about him. He gets too hyper. What are you two doing here?”, Steve said brushing him off.
“But Steve…. I won’t have any memories of you. I’ll forget everything. The feel of your lips on mine, your touch, the warmth of your body…..That I love you with all my heart”
“I don’t know what will happen to me if I did”, another girl added.
Tony continued running errands for the club like making coffee and handing out treats for the guests. He looked at the hosts in their element. They seemed pretty focus on their job. Passing over Clint’s corner he heard him say something about how the girls were all so beautiful he felt like he was surrounded by angels in heaven and was soon followed by girls who were all screaming in joy.
Steve let out a small chuckle as he took out an ID card from his pocket and swiped it across a panel near the gate. The gates finally opened up to let them in. Tony realized that Steve is a student here after he finally pulled himself together to check out the guy. He was wearing the traditional uniform of SHIELD. He followed Steve through the gate and into the building and man was it as grand as it looked from the inside. Like they used an old royal family estate for the academy. Tony stood out like a sore thumb. He was soon met with a number of stares from the people he met along the way. ‘The hell they’re staring at? Haven’t they seen a normal person or what?’. Angry and feeling kind of down he almost felt like dropping the whole thing off and go back home already.
“Can you afford it though? Aren’t scholarship students from low income family?”, Clint stated. Tony hung his head in defeat.
He picked up his phone again and started to push the button down, searching for a certain contact name. Upon coming down on a Tony Stark he select the name and proceeded to send a good morning text to said person.
“You thought of one just now. Spill it, Rogers”, he demanded with a playful grin.
“But we do have proof of what you just did then. That’s enough”, Clint said flashing his own high end digital camera.
“That’s okay. You should get going before your pizza gets cold”, he said handing the box to Tony, “I have to go that way. See you later”, he continued leaving a confused Tony behind.
“Don’t be so confident, I might not fall for you a second time, Rogers”, he stated with a playful smile, tears still flowing out with else. Wiping his tears away, Steve asked what Tony wanted to do. Tony’s lips curved into a smile, gazing up at his super soldier making Steve’s heart beat loudly in his chest. God, he really loved those brown eyes. He never gets tired of gazing into them. Tony finally told him that he wanted to this.
“Do I have to repeat myself? You are jealous of my relationship with Steve”
“I like you already. Here we are, the locker area. Knock yourself out. Just search for your name and swipe the I.D. and voila! All you need for class will be right there”
“This is all your fault you dirty commoner!!”, saying that Wanda ran away, tears in her eyes followed by her brother Pietro.
“Night, Pres”
Steve woke up to the ringtone of his phone. From the tone of it he knew it was a call from Peggy. Rubbing his sleepy eyes he felt around for his phone until he found it. He opened it and saw the miss call. He contemplated on whether to call back but in the end he decided not to and left it on his night stand to go back to sleep.
Tony was working on some project all night long. He hadn’t been getting enough sleep for the past few days which were clear from the dark circles under his eyes. It was already the next morning when he got up to make some coffee for himself. Even if they were poor coffee was a must for him. He’d gladly trade his normal sustenance for it. He was about to have his first coffee of the day when the doorbell rang. He realized his mom must have a morning shift at the bar as there was no one getting the door. Yawning he went for the door and got greeted by a hyper mail guy who gave him a huge smile.
“No, I’ll pay. It will take a while, no, it will take years but I’ll give the compensation myself. You don’t have to do that, Steve. I seriously appreciate your kindness but I have my own pride”, Tony said getting up infront of Steve with a determined look.
“That’s not too far from here. Come on, I’ll show you around, newbie. The name’s Clint Barton. If you ever need any information on anyone here I’m the guy to go to”, Clint offered.
“Just because you happen to do well in your studies doesn’t mean you have any right to ignore my lecture like you don’t care about it”, the teacher retorted, glaring at him. Well he really actually don’t care for it.
“It’s fine. We found the wallet. I’ll take the bus home”
“I don’t want to talk about that, I hate you when you side with him”, saying that she hung up.
“Huh?”, came the confused reply.
“Thor, it is I, Thor Odinson. Nice to meet you fellow comrades. How may I address the two of you?”, he said putting his hands on each of their shoulder.
“Oh, you guys noticed, eh, honey bear?”, was the reply the brunette gave with a sly smirk, sipping on his drink.
Tony wasn’t surprised to find Natasha acing this host act and even Thor was a good one. What surprised him was that Barnes was pretty good at this. He’s never gonna admit it out loud though.
“Steve, I baked a chiffon cake today. Will you eat it?”, one girl with braided hair said shyly.
“Have fun kid”, the girl quickly ran down the hallway. Hmm, that must be Natasha then. Now he understood why Clint would be hiding from her. She really is scary as fuck.
“I have my reasons, Peggy. I have class so I’m hanging up now”
“What are you two arguing about right from morning?”, Bucky asked, staring at the pair.
“So, have you been confessed to today yet?”, Tony asked out of the blue.
Speaking of which, something smelled. He wondered where it was coming from. He saw a black sock hanging off at the end of his bed and picked it up. Was it this? Did that shitty Stark left this stinking thing behind?
Tony quickly shut upped. “Eh? No, I’m fine where I am right now”
“OF COURSE”
“Likewise. Call me Tony”. He feels that this Banner person is the quiet and shy type. He felt like he would get along with the guy.
“Have you seen a stupid looking guy coming down this hallway?”, she asked, a cool icy tone to her voice.
“What’d you do that for? I’m in a hurry, Rogers”
“I had a really rough childhood but mom and I have managed to somehow make it through just fine”, he added with an innocent smile.
“Tony? What are you doing here?”, a voice Tony recognized spoke from behind. Tony hung his head. Of all people why was it him who got to see him like this?
Steve and Tony waited at the bus stop together. It was already quite late into the day. It had taken a while for the football club and its members to clear up the field. But Tony patiently waited for Steve as the blonde had texted him that he’d like to go home together with him.
“Tony?”
“Stop, Rogers…You idiot!”
During the day if Steve happened to see him in Brooklyn for one of his secret info dealing jobs or something Stark would usually taunt him into a fight and then run away from him and his bullets or if he was currently in his job, he’d pointedly ignore him. So seeing him act like this was rare. And weird.
Tony looked around frantically. The guy was suddenly bursting out in tears. What was he supposed to do? Pat him on the back and comfort him? The way he had talked to him. He felt like he was close with this person. And for some reason he heart clenched painfully at the sight of him crying. God, someone please help.
Beep beep beep. Tony hung up on him.
But when the time came for his confession he had looked forward to for the whole week ended with him finding out things that broke his heart.
“That hurts! Geez, what is it?”, he asked in an annoyed growl, rubbing the back of his head to sooth the pain. He turned around to see a grumpy Pepper Potts glaring at him.
The two of them went into a shopping mall and right to the sports wear section. There really had been a lot new styles coming in. Everything looked good. They didn’t know what to choose, too many great designs and color to choose from.
“I had some work I had to finish. I’m sorry, mom”
Maybe I’ll fall in love this time?
After walking around he soon found his locker located at a corner with a Steve Rogers written on the locker beside him which he recognized as the blonde who helped him. Guess they were locker mates. Quickly opening his locker he suit up for class, taking out the school issued bag and some text books and a notebook, shoving his own bag inside the locker. He was on his way to his class when someone suddenly corners him to the wall. He squinted his eyes from the pain and soon found himself face to face with an angry red head with her knife pressed to his throat.
“Tch, don’t apologize”, he tried to brush it off, “Anyway, you were late for practice but I guess you were still really good. You scored two goals”, he said looking up at the ceiling of the bus, his lousy attempt at trying to compliment the guy. Steve smiled at him relief but didn’t give a verbal reply.
Not giving a reply Steve simply took off his shoes and socks as well. Rolled up the pants and got into the fountain with him. Feeling around the water he asked what they were searching for. Tony had stared at the guy, trying to fend him off but he seemed determined. With a soft voice he replied that it was a black wallet. Steve was such a good guy it kind of pisses him off but he can’t help liking him all the same. Totally as a friend though.
Rather it’s all about my face.
“Wrong idea?”, she asked with a sly smile.
A hard smack on the back of his head woke him right up.
“Good to meet you too, Banner”
“Question time, tell me Bruce, buddy, why are the people here super weird and some are scary as shit?”, he asked biting on his pudding spoon.
The brunette got out of the car and took out his bag as well. “Thanks a lot for you know…helping me and dropping me off. You shouldn’t have”
“You got club activities don’t you? Right?”
“I should have known it was you, Clint”, he said, lips twitching in annoyance.
“Wow, so quick. You really have no patience, do you?”. Tony smirked at him. “I might have serviced you if you had pretended to fall asleep a little while longer”.
Tony groaned in his seat, feeling quite sleepy with the after effect of his late night projects finally kicking in again. And to top it off, he was feeling quite full right now. He felt as if he could sleep for a week with the tiredness he was feeling. He almost dozed off from time to time, barely able to keep his eyes open through the lesson. He must have actually dozed off at some point when he vaguely heard someone calling out his name.
“I did say that drinking something for commoners would upset the body”, the girl smirked in her seat. She was totally shock as everyone else when Steve smiled brightly, ”This is delicious, Tony. I’ve never tasted something so good”, he said putting a smile on the brunette’s face as well.
“I get it now. You’re jealous of me, aren’t you?”, Tony concluded.
“Clint, I can’t work with you making so much noise and….. what are you doing to them?”, Steve said, letting out a sigh. “If they aren’t interested just leave them be”, he continued as he reached down to lend a hand. He was surprised to see that it was none other than Tony.
“If you think you can do a better job than me why don’t you become a host? Let’s see you taking on some customers”, Bucky challenged.
“That’s obvious, Steve. You sure have been keeping an eye on him”
Tony tilted his head to the side, confused at his words to which Steve replied, “So, I can be with you a bit longer”
“We’re so happy for you, Tony”, Pepper said as she brought Tony into a warm hug which the genius happily returned, laughing. Punching playfully at Tony’s shoulder, Rhodey asked when he was gonna join the big leagues. Betting that he must be ecstatic to leave this place.
“When you are working on your machines and latest projects, Tony, you look beautiful, handsome. Those eyes that became alive as you work with all your attention. Even though I know exactly what kind of person you are deep inside. I still catch myself thinking that”
“Oh my god, I can’t believe this. Is this a genuine letter from SHIELD?”, Rhodey asked amazed.
“So, you’re Tony from the special class like Steve and the others?”, one of the three girls who had her long black hair in pig tails asked with a friendly smile. They kept asking him questions with curious glints in their eyes. Tony’s lips twitch in annoyance as he tired to fake a smile. I shouldn’t have agreed to Barnes’ stupid dare. I don’t want to do this. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. He thought in panic looking at their expecting gazes.
“Steve, I don’t want to do this. Please don’t do this”, Tony cried out, clutching tightly on Steve’s uniform. The super soldier wrapped his arms around him, bringing him closer to his chest. “We don’t have any other choice, Tony”, he whispered in his ears as Tony cried harder.
“It makes me feel like a lousy person though. Borrowing stuffs and giving back without cleaning it”, Steve let out a chuckle,” And I bet you totally knew I still had it. You should have told me, idiot Pres”
“Since you don’t feel like it….How about we forget it for today?”, he suggested.
“I get to make you fall for me again and you also get to fall in love with me all over again”
“It’s fine, Bucky. I’ll sort it out with the principal”, Steve told his friend in a calm voice making Bucky arch his eyebrows at the statement. “I’ll even pay it if that’s needed”. Bucky’s eyes widened at that. Steve would really go as far as paying it off himself?... If Steve was okay with that I guess they’ll do that then.
“I see. I’ve already taken care of most of the task but it would be great if I could leave the rest to you”, Steve replied.
Tony smiled, “She told me that I wasn’t the person she thought I was”, he explained.
“As expected of poor people. They don’t even have manners. I was just talking to myself. Why would you think I’d want to talk to you?”, she replied putting on a smile which was utterly fake. As if laced with malice instead. As to why he thought that, Tony didn’t really know. He doesn’t remember doing anything to her. And this is the first time he’s seen her. Even though she was a girl, Tony felt like hitting her. Besides she was totally meaning him.
After a few minutes of silence Tony finally spoke up, “Um…about compensation…”
Steve flopped back onto his back on the bed, sighing as he put an arm over his eyes to hide the light coming from his bedroom window.
Natasha and Clint looked at each other and stepped out of the room. Bruce and Thor followed them out as well and the sorcerer opened a portal to let himself out.
What I mean is I hate you for waking me up this early in the morning. I only got to bed just an hour ago.
“Course, it’s two classes from here“
“Listen here, lady. I don’t care if he drinks it or not. I’m just doing what I’m told so butt out”
“Anyway, normal guys like me will never understand people who are popular”, Rhodey admitted.
“You ARE chickening out”
Clint grinned, Natasha let out a sly smirk, Thor looked at him, tilting his head in confusion and Bucky’s brow frowned, a bit annoyed.
I can hear you guys you know
“Instant coffee?”, their guests said in unison looking lost. Like they’ve never seen it before. Wait….they really don’t know about this!
Tony let of a groan and slings his bag pack on his shoulder, “This is one of the reasons I hate these kind of schools. The stupid dress code”
Tony stared at her not knowing what she meant. Then it hit him. He quickly took off Steve’s blazer and explained to his mom that a friend had lent it and that he forgot to give it back. Ignoring the rest of her questions Tony ran to his room.
“It’s enough for me, Tony”,
“No fighting you two”, Steve scolded them with a stern look.
“Long time no see, Rogers”, he told him with a playful huff.
Tony took off his uniform and went to take a bath. The warm water really loosened his tense muscles. He got out from the bathtub and put on clean clothes. He flopped on the bed with Steve’s blazer at the end of it. He looked at it for a while contemplating whether he should washed it or simply return it.
“Tony. We can’t be your only friends”, they replied in unision. Letting out a small sigh he promised them that he’d atleast try to make new friends. Mostly to make them less worried.
“So shoes”
I knew it. Even though the time limit is one week. This is…
“I’m sorry we couldn’t meet your expectation. Now, hurry along to class. You have a lot of catching up to do”
“I can’t believe someone like you is spending time with Steve. Don’t think that he really cares about you just because you’re getting some of his attention…”. She went to saying how unworthy he was to be in his presence and that it should be her instead, having the attention of the president.
“I thought you hit me with a book but….Did you hit me with your fist just now?”, the brunette asked in astonishment. Pepper just continues staring at him coolly. “You did, didn’t you? Wow, how scary”, he admitted smiling nervously.
Tony started to forget things.
“That’s seriously not why we’re here. And what do you mean by host club?”
“Football boots?”
“I see you had the privilege of taking the Odinson tour”, Steve said looking at the state of the two newbies, Tony with the leftover yellow pollens on his uniform and Bruce covered in a towel, water dripping down from his hair. “He likes showing the new applicants around and letting them try out things. Don’t mind him, he’s a really good guy. Just wanted to make you feel more comfortable here. I’ll let the teachers know about it”
“I’m glad Anthony is alright. Steven had us worried”, Thor said, smiling with Bruce doing the same. Tony took in his surrounding. All the members of the Avengers Host club had come to his rescue.
“I can’t believe girls fall for such talk”, Tony scoffed as he took a break to sit down with Bruce who had been reading alone at one of the empty table.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Tony. We’re almost there”
“Good morning, Mr. Stark. My name is Steve Rogers”
“It’s fine, Tony. You didn’t need to”
“Then, we have to find Loki, fast”, Natasha said, getting up from the sofa. Her eyes serious.
They found Loki inside a building, a type of bar, being served wine by the women. Loki, on seeing them gestured the girls to leave the room. “My, my, what brings earth’s mightiest heroes to seek my presence?”, the mischief god asked twirling his wine in his glass. It took all of Steve’s effort to not charge at him and beat the crap out of him. Maybe the spell would break along with him.
Why was the universe so cruel? Why those memories? Maybe it’s to punish him. Punishment for all the things he’d done wrong. The result of being The Merchant of Death. Fate had come back to bite him in the face. I guess I deserve it though. He admitted bitterly burying his eyes in his palms.
They continue their chat as they made their way back to class and taking their respective seat near each other. They kept telling Tony how much of a lucky bastard he was and teasing him that he should not forget them just cause he got to study in the big shot school. But their conversation was put to halt when the teacher came in to take the class. They make no attempts to continue their chat as this particular teacher is the strictest person alive. You know, the types that simply punish kids for the heck of it.
“Ah, sorry I forgot”
“Cause it’s already Tuesday. One week will go by in a flash. I have to use my time wisely”
“You’re early today”, was the reply he got with a chuckle.
Steve then checked up on the rest of the gang. He found that no one suffered any serious injuries. That was a relief. Telling them to get themselves patched up Steve got onto one of SHIELD’s bike and droved off to see his lover.
“You never listen to advice when it’s given to you”, she said with a sigh, “Keep this up and your girlfriend is going to fall out of love with you pretty soon. Maybe even today”, she continued with a small playful smirk.
“No, but…”, he was about to reply when the classroom started to fill with murmurs and squeals. It was Steve Rogers smiling at him from the doorway.
“Come on, don’t be like that. How is your experience so far, Tony? Good I hope”
He felt irritated just thinking about it.
“How are you doing so far errand boy? I hope it’s not too much for you”
“Felt like it”, was Tony’s simple reply.
Tony looked horrified on seeing all the members of the host club together. “Don’t tell me….all of you are in the same class?!”
“And here I was planning to give some host lessons”, Clint pouted.
Even if I do fall for this person. I’m sure that it won’t go as I want it. I have to tell him! This isn’t some kind of game. So if I don’t split up with him right now….
Everyone had already gone home. There were no lights nearby. Tony’s feet started to feel numb standing in the cold water for so long.
“You don’t like it when people just went along with you?”, Steve asked, looking at his untouched plate.
“Not really, I don’t have anything I need to do”
He’s really gonna die now isn’t he? There’s no way out of this mess. He thought bitterly. He just stood in his place like a statue. Not knowing what to do. Barnes brushed off the mess on him and got up silently, making his way towards Tony. The smaller brunette shut his eyes waiting for the pain. To everyone’s surprise he walked passed him without even a threat or a punch to the gut.
Karma seems to follow him everywhere. What was a banana peel lying around anyway? He heard someone trying to stifle a laugh and immediately knew that Clint was responsible for that.
“Why don’t you give it a try? Being a host will get you to pay off your debt faster”, Natasha said crossing her arms infront, looking at Tony with an amused smile.
-END-
Steve was working on a sketch he had started a few days ago, sitting by the window of Bucky’s living room.
“My name is Bruce Banner. It’s good to meet you, President”, Bruce said and the two shook hands.
When Steve got the notice that Tony had finally woke up, he rushed out of the debriefing room, leaving Fury yelling at him while his team looked over with happy understanding eyes. In his hurry he had bumped into a few hospital staffs on the way, shouting his sorry as he ran on. A wide smile adorning his lips.
Making his way out of the detention room with a loud slam of the door he met up with Pepper and Rhodey who were waiting for him at the hallway. “I don’t care about anything. I’m joining that new school first thing in the morning. Damn teacher thinking he can send me to detention just for dozing off a bit”, Tony complained with a huff. “Still managed to get detention even on your last day here,huh?”, Rhodey said with an amused chuckle. “Life’s gonna be so boring now without you around”, Pepper said giving Tony a side glance, a small smile adorning her lips.
Once they reach the cafeteria they lined up near the buffet table. Tony stack up his plate to the brim with food, planning to eat away his worries. “I feel a bit sick looking at your plate”
“It… doesn’t matter… if I forget ….everything else. Just…not you”, Tony breathe out slowly. He was getting tired, his vision blurry and his mind in a haze. Letting out another sob he fell asleep on Steve’s arms. Steve carried Tony into their room and pulls the sheets on top of him. Instead of getting to bed he continues to gaze at the sad expression on his lover, caressing his cheeks and brushing his fingers in his fluffy hair. God, he loved this man. And he was willing to do anything for him.
I was curious to see how he would react if I confessed to him. That’s all.
Steve showed a knowing smile, “Just wanted to make sure our new genius don’t climb anymore gates soon”
“Hey, do you guys wanna order pizza?”, Rhodey said halting the conversation.
Though he was all alone in the dimly lit room he seemed so satisfied and happy to be there. How the brunette’s lips curved into a relaxed one as he was putting his invention together, an excited glint in his brown eyes. Totally engrossed in his own world.
It’s settled then. Let’s go crash at Rogers’ place tonight~ (more like piss him the hell off)
The team decided to get him checked up but they couldn’t find any reasons for it. Nothing was wrong with his brain. It was functioning properly. Steve was at a loss on what to do next. Doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with his lover but he keeps getting worse.
The teacher came in to take the class and just as Bruce had feared Tony got called out for his attire. He got sent to the principal’s office. Sitting in front of the one eyed principal of SHIELD Tony felt an urge to make fun of the eye patch but he didn’t. He was currently in trouble. “Already sent to the office on your second day, huh, Stark?”, Fury said leaning his arm on the desk.
1 year ago
Twirling a pen in his hand he looked down to see two girls who were waving at him. He looked around to check whether or not the teacher was busy. On finding out he was occupied with reading out boring words from the text Tony waved back at them with a smile, earning a happy squeal from the girls.
Anyway, those girls don’t know anything about me except my looks. But it’s human nature to judge by appearance. It’s not just guys who are superficial. No one bothers about things they cannot see. Like the heart.
“Steve…”
“5 MILLION DOLLARS?!” Tony shouted at the top of his lungs. He slumped down, crouching at a corner, totally depressed.
“Speak of the devil, here he comes”, Barnes said as he eyed at their new errand boy, Tony Stark, who grumpily walked over to them , hands occupied with shopping bags.
“No, I won’t. I don’t really mind leaving, sir. If you don’t allow me to wear it like this I’m coming to school stark naked”, he said staring pointedly at him.
It’s always ‘like’ one second and ‘hate’ the other with her these days.
At the beginning of each week he will definitely go out with the first person who confesses to him.
“You sure have nerves picking on one of the host club members”, Bucky said, leaning on the gym wall.
“Am not!”
“Wow, Rogers seems to hit the goal every time”, one of his teammates told to his friend as he wiped off the sweat from his face with his shirt.
“About that, he happened to be assigned to meet me and escort me to the office. I was scared of him at first but he helped me when one of the guys here were talking bad about some poor kid getting to join the rich kids. He got angry and almost beat the crap out of the guy. So, I feel like he isn’t such a bad guy, only looks the part”, Bruce said with a smile, adjusting his glasses.
“Bucky…”, Steve started
“I see you have no problem entering the gate now”
With that Steve’s face lit up in pleasure and went off, really leaving Tony this time. Tony knocked on the vice principal’s door and got permission to enter. “Hello, I’m To-“
“Hello, Tony? How was your new school? Made any new friends yet?”, she enquired.
At school~
Hearing that pissed the hell off of Tony.
“So, why did you join the host club, Tony?”
“He is a natural at entertaining people, that punk”, Bucky said watching them from across the room.
Tony smirked. “Oh, I see. If it’s gonna be like this, I wish I came out while you were doing perverted things with my sock”, he teased. Tony’s eyes widened in surprise as he felt Steve suddenly bring him into a tight hug. Burrowing his face in the crook of his neck.
Tony was shouting over at him from his seat to get in the game and score some or he was gonna regret it later. The guy sure was determined to win the game. Seeing him like that Steve resolved to play a better game in the next half. He didn’t want to let him down for some reason.
“Stop assuming I know useless stuffs about the club”, Tony stated, crossing his arms.
“Pff…bad boy type? More like the scary and creepy type”, Tony laughed.
Pizza delivery in a Porsche?
“Okay…”
-Flashback starts-
On the first half Steve wasn’t able to make any goal as most of his teammates didn’t want to pass him the ball. On the other hand their opposing team scored twice. It was rough. Skipping practice wasn’t such a good thing right now when he’s drenched in sweat and losing.
Pulling up a chair next to sit near Tony’s desk Rhodey said, “It seems like Rogers hasn’t shown up yet today”
“I feel like if I drink this my father would scold me”, one girl said looking nervous.
It was supposed to be just another day in the lives of the Avengers. Fighting for the people and protecting lives. Steve wouldn’t have known that the fight with the God of mischief would end up like this. If he did he’d never let Tony took part in it. In that fateful battle.
“I got it. Bye”, Tony replied, waving at him and got ready to knock on the door when he heard Steve call out  to him again, startling him.
“Oh…. Is that all is it?”
Normal guys like me will never understand people who are that popular
……….He couldn’t have taken me seriously, could he?
“Make sure you go to club practice. My friend Rhodey said he’d like you to be more active in the club. He’s also a player there. You might know him”, he called out at Steve’s retreating back. Steve waved back at him with a cheerful smile saying he’ll try. But can’t make any promises.
“What?! That makes no sense. Wait! I said wait!”
Lunch time~
“EXACTLY! I hate it. Because if we aren’t both enjoying ourselves what’s the point?”
“Are you chickening out, Stark?”
___________________________________________
“Now that you mentioned it he was really good when he played that practice match. I couldn’t keep my eyes off him that time. I totally forgot he was even part of the school football club. Since I rarely saw him even when I came to see your practice with Pepper. You two close?”
“YESSS! You’re the man, Rhodey bear”, Tony’s face lit up in pure joy. Pulling out the take out menu of a nearby pizza store the three friends sat down to decide which to order, having an argument about which topping was the best.
“But I’m certain though that he’ll still retain the memories of him becoming Ironman. That’s all I can assure you, but no more than that”, he told them.
“I’m not the emotional type but man am I gonna miss you guys. You two are the only reason I even put up being here. I don’t know if I’ll enjoy the new school without you two. Who will nag me to do my chores or take care of me there?”, he said tackling them both into a hug on each side, laughing out loud at their surprised yelp.
Steve didn’t think much of it. He guessed it happens because Tony had hit his head pretty hard during the fight and Tony didn’t seem to think much on it either. Brushing it off. But….
“Heh, as if I’d tell them the truth. Of course it’s not true so stop looking at me like that and get back to work” , Tony simply replied. But Steve felt like that wasn’t quite true.
“If you’re gonna be that persistent then I guess I have no other choice but to leave it to you”, he said giving a playful punch at Steve’s chest. Then he nodded to Loki to start the spell. The magician came over and his hands gave off a blue glow, shining it upon Tony’s feature. His friends watching in anticipation.
Next time as an official host~
“Alright! Gonna aced the classes and beat all those rich snobs”, he proclaimed with confidence.
“Now that you mention it. You’ll probably die after a few weeks without us having to remind you to eat”, Rhodey stated making Tony pout.
“Of course”, Steve replied as a matter of fact.
“He doesn’t even come to practice often. He only comes here once in a while and he just gets into the game”, the other said in a disgusted and annoyed tone.
“You didn’t put up much of a fight, my friends”, Thor told them.
“It’s fine”
A smile curved on Bucky’s lips. He had an idea. “That’s good to hear. I like that you have some backbone, kid. Tell you what, you can be the club’s service boy. We’ll pay you for the errands you run for us”
Steve was caught off guard. What the hell was Stark still doing here? To make it worse he just saw him like this. His cheeks reddened at how his current position was. He seriously did not want to think of what Stark would think of him right now.
“Tony, where are you going?”, Rhodey called out.
“Just one more room. This place is huge, Bruce. I’m sure that they’ll be atleast one empty room we can call our own”, Tony insisted and Bruce gave a nod.
Steve was crushed on getting to know the truth. His friends knew it, everything, his feelings. But they had acted like they didn’t and even fake supported him knowing all this. How important it was for him. Peggy was the only girl he had ever like. Who had treated him the same before and after his physical change, from a scrawny kid bullied everyday to the muscular, handsome blonde who caught the eyes of everyone.
Before the next half of the game started Steve walked over to Rhodey whom he used to see hanging around Tony. Figuring he was a decent guy to ask for help. He told him to pass the ball to him if he happens to get it. The guy stared at him baffled but nodded all the same.
“Not your business, Barton”, Tony shooed him away.
“You have no proof I did that!”
“So? Your point?”. Tony was baffled. What’s her problem?
“But this is just Regal Shopping Street..”, Steve said but Tony had long walked away into the crowded street. Eh?
“Did you drop something? I’ll help you”, Steve offered.
“Why don’t you go out with me, Steve?”
“Ahh, a type? I’m not sure about that. I don’t really think about looks….”
“As you’ve heard before Steve is the most popular host. He’s the ‘Gentleman type’, Natasha as the ‘Mature type’, Clint as the ‘Mischievous type’, Thor as the ‘Jock type’ and finally me as the ‘Bad boy type’”
“I was wondering if we could go home together today”
“Seriously… what’s with you?...Why are you still here?”, he said softly, so soft that he was able to hear it just because it was being spoken near his ears. Tony could feel his breath on his skin, leaving a tingling sensation. God, what is Rogers thinking?!
Next morning~
“Wait, are you the Tony Stark who recently won the best engineering award in the field of Robotics 2018?”, he asked clearly amazed.
“I think he knew that someone did that to you on purposed. Barnes maybe scary but he’s nice once you get to know him better”, his friend explained. And Tony felt like he finally understood Barnes a bit. He really isn’t so bad.
“I..can I help you?”, he managed to choke out looking at the really pissed off girl.
Then class went on. Even though he was told that the class had done a lot lessons before he joined Tony found that he didn’t miss much. Everything was pretty clear to him. To be honest they were kind of teaching him stuffs he already knew about. The studies are the easy part, studying with these characters was the hard part. Bruce was the most normal one he met so far.
Steve sigh then got up and opened the door, sketch book in hand, “Don’t say things you don’t really mean”, he says and walked out of his apartment leaving her alone.
Ahh, geez. The guy had shown up at his apartment one moment and then gone before he knew it.
Steve then opened the door for Tony to get in. Joining him soon after. Steve gave Jarvis Tony’s address and they rode out.
After a few minutes of silence Tony spoke up again. “Isn’t your house at this stop?”
Peggy was the kind of girl who did exactly as she wanted. Especially when she was drunk.
Boarding the bus Tony tried not to think about the impending horrible events that awaits him at SHIELD. He just has to suck it up, avoid the annoying characters except Bruce and maybe Steve and he’ll be fine. Getting to gate he took out his card and slides it along the panel like a pro.
“Yes”
“…Rogers? What’s wrong? Were you lonely because I wasn’t there when you woke up? Haha”. He said in an attempt to taunt him and get rid of this odd atmosphere but got no reply. The guy continued to hug him silently, his hold getting tighter than before.
Something was seriously wrong with Tony. It’s like his memories is being wiped out little by little. It worsens as the days went by. Tony would suddenly run out in horror when he finds Steve in the bed with him. Steve would comfort him and calmly explain to him and Tony would remember again after that. It used to happen once a week before but now it seems to occur every morning these days.
Well, this sure is unfortunate. Hmm, how come, he seems like he’s not how he looks from the outside. “It’s honestly kind of cute”, Steve said to himself as a smile starts to curve on his lips, re-reading the text. He was caught by surprise when his phone rang.
Steve gave him a look and dropped the topic. The rest of the ride went on in silence. Tony didn’t even feel like breaking it. He feels better in the quietness of the car and the sound of its humming engines. They soon reached Tony’s place.
But as the brunette continued his silent stare he let out a small sigh and says, “I guess I’m a bit troubled”
“I sure am having the time of my life there. It’s so great I’m dying, literally”
It was a pure relief when the loud roar of the Hulk woke up Tony who opened his eyes and looked up at them in shock.
I always thought he looked the most beautiful when he’s concentrating on his work but he’s so much more beautiful when he’s smiling and laughing like this.
“No…!Not…yet..!Don’t!”. Steve did not stop though, he kept on hitting his pleasure spot time and again making Tony cry out both in ecstasy and pain.
Saying bye to his mom he head off for another day of being a host again. He had folded the coat and put it in his bag running to the station.
“Great! Let’s go eat something. I’m starving; it’s your treat by the way, Rogers”
After the host club activities ended for the day Tony went over to pick up his bag he found it to be missing. He asked around if anyone had seen it but no one did. He then looked out the window and noticed something in the fountain. He squinted his eyes trying to make out what it was and soon realized that it was his bag. Someone had thrown his it in the water. Even in an elite school bullies were everywhere.
It had been the happiest day of his life when he confessed to Tony who had burst out in tears, tackling him into a hug and told him that he also loved him. Sealing their love with a kiss so sweet that had made Steve craving for more. Tony’s kisses were addictive. He couldn’t get enough of it.
Tony glared at him. “I’m waiting for pizza. Just so you know we’re having self study right now so I can do whatever I want”
He was ecstatic to see Tony. Now that his lover was okay he could take him back home. Everything would be like it was again. But everything was not gonna be like it was. When he saw Tony he looked as if he didn’t even know him. He looked so confused and scared. What was wrong?
“My type?...You won’t know if someone’s your type just by looking at their face, would you?”, Steve replied with a chuckle.
