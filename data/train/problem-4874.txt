“We have four unique heat signatures off the East Coast of New Jersey Boss. Two are confirmed to be Asgardian, the third and fourth are of an unknown origin.” Almost as an afterthought, “Not human.”
“Nope,” Tony replied easily, sensing a button whenever there was one available to push. There was a twitch in what would have been a face that was otherwise an ode to symmetry.
“I think so,” he answered instead. Tony could only say as much because it was at times like this he almost could. There was something so intense about having Steve’s full attention on you. To listen how earnestly he conversed that it was difficult to escape. To think of anything else. Tony could pretend for a moment that this was the only moment.
Then realizing what he’d done Tony stared at his hand in horror, ignoring the quiet sting along his knuckles. Steve had his own wide eyed expression going on before they narrowed. Steve shook his head laughing quietly as blood dripped from his mouth.
After they’d died… After his mother died, Tony had a hard time playing anything. It’d never been for him the way inventing had become. Still, at every property, he owned it felt empty without a piano. Without an armchair in the corner of some grand space. Even if he didn’t play it, the items were necessary to even pretend like it was a home.
Tony chortled and took a seat on a stool that also allowed him to lean into his workbench. “Why do I somehow doubt that? Hey, here’s an idea, let me have a go.” He wasn’t sure who he would start with when it came to setting up Steve, but he would definitely have more fun with it than Nat currently was.
Tony collapsed into the nearest chair upon hearing the doors shut. “How bad was that JARVIS?” Tony asked referring to his sleep addled, nearly incoherent, conversing abilities. If he wasn’t so practiced at embarrassing himself he’d be blushing right now. As it was he felt too tired for all of that.
Steve put his hand around Tony’s upper arm and easily pulled him up into a standing position. The hand moved to his opposite shoulder so that he could continue to steady Tony as they took a step forward. “I wasn’t coming here to convince you to put on the suit.”
“The plan was not be seen Spider-Man, let alone get caught,” Tony said quietly, well aware that Steve could pick up every word. Secrecy hardly mattered at this junction.
Steve smiled instead. “No, it’s alright. I should talk about them more. If it wasn’t for my mom- I was a pretty sick kid. I’m sure you’ve seen my pre-serums files.”
“Oh god,” Steve whispered just loudly enough that Tony could hear it. He couldn’t tell if it was the good variety or one of condemnation.
“I’d like them just as an assurance. I won’t call the suit unless I need to,” Tony tried again with less animosity. He could reliably keep himself to that.
Mindsets could settle over you like a second skin. Fall across and you’d wonder if this wasn’t always the landscape. It was easy for Tony to believe he was always meant to be this. That he was the closest he would ever get to being good, when in this. No wonder he couldn’t walk away. The fear. The adrenaline. The consequences. It all fell away in the face of this.
Steve gave in and started really laughing hard then. Tony was so shocked at the sound of it that he just stared open mouthed until Steve had finished. If he found out he’d dreamt all of this while nodding off he would not forgive his subconscious. “Tell you what,” Steve began. “You get some sleep and you can take me wherever you want tomorrow.”
Walking out of the hallway, there was a ghost of temptation to look back. To see Steve pull up his clothes along his legs. To lean against the door with folded arms and smirk. To wait for him. Kiss him one more time, before putting his life on the line. There was something exhilarating about the idea that he could not come back. That one last kiss from Steve wouldn’t haunt him or be left to deal with when he strode back into the facility. He could take one last second-
When he opened his eyes Steve was there. Staring at him as if he’d never seen the Iron Man Suit. As if this were the the first time. As if there were no slates to clean. Tony should have moved away when Steve’s hand reached out and traced along the outer shell of the helmet. They really didn’t have time for this, but he couldn’t seem to make himself move.
“I don’t want to fight,” Steve said and it appeared honest. He may have not have grown up with Tony’s childhood, but he sure lied like he had.
Steve gingerly set Tony on his feet. Tony slid down the glass wall onto the floor. His hands were trembling. Even with the endorphins rampaging their way through his body reality was crawling its way back in. He could feel Steve’s come sliding out of him, already cooling. The burn of what they had just done resonating through his body.
“Not as bad as the 2002 interview Sir.” JARVIS didn’t need to specify which one. Tony groaned into his hands, but couldn’t wipe the grin off his face when he realized he was taking Captain America out shopping tomorrow.
Tony walked back over to him, finding strength in this distraction. “Steve.” Tony placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder, ignoring the way the muscles moved underneath his palm. “From one Avenger to another, we have got to save the world from seeing you like this. Let me take you shopping for twenty-first century clothing.”
Steve was going full tilt on the glower he was sending Tony’s way. “Gone,” the word fell between them. “I’ve got her guys tied up and unconscious in the helicarrier.”
There’s a slight hesitation, as if Dr. Stark is wondering if he should stop anyway, no matter what Steve says, but then he hears him sigh. “All right, then I’ll go ahead and check your prostate now.”
“Can I get you something?” he asked in a hushed voice, glancing at the leftover food on the table, but Tony gave the barest shake of his head and started towards his bedroom. It was more of a shuffle than a walk, and Steve’s heart sank to the vicinity of his knees to see it.
“And I love it,” Tony said, the soft look on his face convincing Steve that he was being truthful.  Tony was a hard man to shop for, and Steve had finally given up trying to buy something one of the world’s wealthiest men didn’t already have.  Instead, he’d painted a picture of the team laughing together based off a photograph Pepper had taken during last year’s Christmas party.  It’d been right before the two of them had started seeing each other, and Tony and Steve had been standing side by side, the expressions on their faces revealing a lot more than either of them had realized at the time.
Only then did he say, “I’d like to ask you something,” because Steve talked and acted like he still wanted Tony, but Tony needed to be sure. He’d always “known” what Steve wanted, almost from day one, had assumed instead of asked and as a result, had gotten nearly everything wrong in the process. He didn’t want to make that mistake again. “But you have to be honest,
“I—” His voice cracks, and he tries again. “I am so sorry.” He can’t lower his legs, no matter how strong the urge is, not with Dr. Stark in between them, and there’s no point anyway. Steve would just have to raise them again in order to proceed with the exam—
“I do actually have the base model ready for manufacture,” Tony says, leaning forward in his enthusiasm, “but I did a few market studies, and one thing several doctors want is for me to include …” He trails off, clearing his throat, and it might be Steve’s imagination but he thinks his face gets redder.  “Anyway, I don’t want to bore you, but yeah, I have to add a little more functionality, and then it should be ready to go. I imagine I’ll be able to start production with the advanced model in less than a year.”
The humming of the repulsors snapped him out of his thoughts. This wasn’t the time or the place, especially when he still didn’t know what he to say to Tony. There wasn’t a point in starting the conversation when he couldn’t figure out what his own answers were. But later . . .
“Call me when you’re feeling better,” Tony says, starting to slide his hands free, like Steve’s getting over a cold or something instead of planning to masturbate until his arms practically fall off, Tony’s shirt pressed to his face as he searches for hints of his scent even with the blockers Tony uses for work, and fuck. So many alphas would assume after everything that had happened that Steve had taken them home for sex, but Tony’s getting ready to walk away so Steve can take care of himself, and is it any wonder that Steve wants him so much?
“Like this. Stay like this for me,” Tony said, and it was all Steve could do not to whine in agreement, his hole clenching down greedily as if he could make Tony keep touching him, even though Steve knew it’d be over soon. Tony was just ensuring that Steve was stretched out enough to take his … to take his tail. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that Steve had responded to this degree.
or anything; it’s just good to have a clean apartment is all, in case unexpected visitors decide to drop in.
“No,” Steve says brightly, looking into concerned eyes and somehow keeping his voice steady as he smiles with what feels like too many teeth. “Just remembered something, but it’s fine.”
Maybe it’s because he goes to Dr. Stark, knowing he’s going to get naked and be examined and that he’ll end up collecting fodder for all the long nights in between visits; if he went to Tony, however, he’d go wanting to be held, and since that’s not going to happen, he stops himself before he can get started.
Tony didn’t seem to expect a response, not that Steve would’ve been able to give him one as Tony’s fingers started moving faster, the pleasure turning more intense and deliberate.
(Bruce had kept the audio of that first meeting. He still alluded to it every now and then when he wanted to blackmail Dick.)
He just wishes that it didn’t mean he was being so overstimulated that he’s barely keeping himself from yelling.
Steve had a vague thought that this must be how a turtle felt as Tony gentled lowered him to the ground so he was on top of the shield, rocking slightly from side to side, and then Tony said, “You sure you’re okay?
The sneer on Captain America’s face seemed to get bigger and bigger the more he talked.  “Making money by creating weapons designed for mass murder and being lucky enough to have a father who could pass along his genius don’t make you
He’d thought he was doing the right thing by keeping his head down, both literally and figuratively, but he hadn’t expected the situation to blow up in face. Maybe he should have though. When had anything gone right for him with Steve after all?
Steve paused for just a moment before moving, slicking up his fingers. He went back down on his knees in order to make it easier to reach around himself, and taking a deep breath, he used one hand to hold himself open and then pushed one finger in, his thighs twitching.
“Different how?” Pepper asked when he said as much, but Tony could tell from her tone that she wasn’t giving their conversation the consideration it deserved.
Instead he said, “You know what?  The penthouse isn’t even that big.  I’m sure you can find your own way around,” before leaving, being extra careful to ensure that their bodies didn’t touch on the way out.
, and he can blame it on curiosity if the Angel wakes up. It’s the truth even, although it’s only part of it, the rest being that Tony is so drawn to his Angel that it’s almost a compulsion to slide along his broad back and trace where his wings connect to his body, to stroke up and down his smooth legs, even to wriggle over feet and between toes that seem much cuter this close up than they had before.
“—and is turned into a Beast, and he only manages to break the spell by finding true love. This curse follows that same path, but maybe the villain—”
Between the two of them, there was no doubt that Steve was stronger. Their sparring every day only reinforced the knowledge, as if either of them would forget. He hadn’t thought, however, about how helpless he’d be when he was in the air, how it would feel for Stark to hold him, trapped and safe.
, he thinks, because there are only two omegas on the team, and Clint went out on assignment three days ago. That means that Steve is in heat. Steve. Is in heat.
“When I thought about it later, I didn’t believe him,” he said, his eyes drawn back to Tony. “You’re a good man, Tony, and I know that better than almost anyone, but Nick is a good man too, and he still supported Insight. Even good men can wander from the path sometimes,” he said, imploring, willing him to understand. “I didn’t want to bring up Insight until I was ready in case you’d … in case there was something I couldn’t … I couldn’t handle. I still didn’t think you’d gone along with it,” he said, knowing that it seemed like the exact opposite, “but if you had, I wanted to be able to discuss it with a clear head.”
—that Steve needs is to leave here feeling unwanted. And if his first Dom won’t touch him or teach him, then how else is he going to feel?”
to be one, and honestly, he looked forward to wringing as many orgasms out of Tony as he could. He felt antsy at the thought of Tony being unsatisfied, even if Tony said that he didn’t need an orgasm. Needing and wanting were two different things, and while Steve had gone along with Tony’s wishes, when it came down to it, he just didn’t want to leave Tony with an erection. Not when he was perfectly willing and eager to take care of it with his hands, or his mouth, or if Tony just wanted to use him, Steve would be happy to bend over or ride Tony or let him come on his—
His hectocotyli are descending without conscious direction, and that has literally never happened to him since he reached sexual maturity. He doesn’t understand why he’s acting like this, especially around an Angel who he’s never talked to or even seen his face. He’d just wanted to save his Angel, get to know him a bit, maybe brag to everyone he’d met one, not do whatever the hell it is that he’s doing right now.
Steve jabs at the elevator button again, even though he knows that won’t make it come down any faster. He needs some way to release his anxious energy, though, and this is the only outlet available.
Stark’s eyebrows came down in a slight squint, but he didn’t comment on his tone, and Steve hated the relief he felt when he noticed that Stark was giving him his full concentration, was
“Steve, you …” He looked away for a second. “If I were the best kind, then you wouldn’t be here, on your knees.”
Not that Steve hadn’t already known that, because he had, but it was different seeing Tony without his heavy metal band T-shirts or one of his business suits. Or the Iron Man suit, for that matter. He was much more muscular than Steve had given him credit for, with heavily corded arms, a thick chest that Steve had always assumed was due to the arc reactor but really, really wasn’t, and strong thighs. Tony was just
He put his hand on the pad next to the elevator doors and kept his eyes open for the retinal scanner.
"No, no, don't try to convince me," Tony said, shaking his head and waving his hands. "It just won't work between us. I'm sorry, Steve."
The texture was different from anything he’d experienced before, a little rougher and drier, but far from unpleasant. Tony’s tongue was really long, though, gliding over Steve’s whole cock and even his balls at the same time. It lifted and pulled gently at them as it moved, and it was a dizzying flood of sensations, especially when more and more of Tony’s saliva started falling onto his skin. Tony just produced
Tony snorted. "Yeah, okay. We can go with that if it makes you feel better.” He gave Steve what could only be considered a condescending pat on the shoulder before turning away.
“What? No, oh no, Steve, what are you saying?” He moved forward, closing the distance between them without thinking, and gripped Steve’s upper arms, barely resisting the urge to shake him to get him to listen and understand. “You
At least … at least Tony wanting him naked meant he still liked his body. Right? At least there was something Steve could give him.
“You don’t know my parents, Steve,” Tony said darkly.  “It’s always something with them.  ‘What do you mean it’s going to take you two years to graduate college and three to get your doctorate?  You want to start your own company?  Why would you do that when you could take over after your father?  You’re only bringing in ten million a year; how do you survive?  Do you have to wear sunglasses all the time?  You look like a drug dealer.’”  He sniffed.  “As if I could ever look anything other than amazing.  Seriously, it never ends with them.  When they started hinting about the marriage thing, I thought—I just wanted to get them off my back, you know?”
“Can you unbutton your jeans?” he asked, quite levelly, he thought. He could probably have Tony lie down at this point so he could stand up and pull off the jeans by the bottoms of the legs, but as he looked up at Tony, he decided there was no need to make things harder on themselves. He was fine where he was.
It was that fact that Fury was counting on when he dangled Captain America like bait in front of him, even though he knew Tony liked his privacy and disliked attachments and had never accepted a long-term Sub.  Howard Stark had spent years and millions of dollars searching for Captain America, attention and energy that he hadn’t ever focused in the same way on Tony, and Fury had to be thinking that there was no way he was going to walk away from that, from having the man his father had preferred over Tony down on his knees in front of him.
“Or ‘please, I don’t care where you bite me, as long as you keep doing it?’” he said, regretfully moving his hands away from Steve’s chest—although he’d hardly call it a disappointment to rest them on Steve’s hips. He inched down the bed so he could get a mouthful of Steve’s side, just above the rise of his buttocks. He didn’t have to be quite so careful there, and Steve’s breath hissed out as Tony bit him, his ass tensing appealingly under Tony’s palms.
“Don’t worry about it. I’m just glad I finally remembered. Now let me set this up, and then we move on to the next part.”
wrong, because Tony hadn’t actually given him permission; there just hadn’t been any other choice. He needed to know, however, even while he didn’t want to hear the answer itself. “Can you tell me what I did?”
, or any of the other things that fluttered behind his teeth, wanting to escape, words that would potentially put pressure on Steve or anchor him toward one answer over another. He still wanted to be with Steve, even after everything, and he was willing to do whatever it took to keep him. But that only worked if Steve wanted to be kept.
“Yeah,” Steve breathes in a stunning display of intelligence, and fuck. The first impression he’s making by being late is already bad enough; he doesn’t need to make it worse.
do you think you’re doing?” Stark asked, and Steve’s head whipped around in time to see him stand, the chair legs knocking as Stark shoved his seat against the wall. Steve had never seen that expression on his face before. He hadn’t known Stark
The two assigned to Steve’s thighs are restless now that they’ve been usurped, and they trace the seam of where Tony’s connected to Steve, as if to see if there’s any room for them as well. There isn’t, but Steve tilts his hips back anyway, as if he’s inviting them to try, and it makes Tony narrow his eyes, even as he strokes Steve’s hair and presses hot kisses to his temple.
“Whatever story we concoct, you’re going to be around me a lot, and I need to know I don’t have to worry about you in front of other people. Notice I don’t say the same thing for when it’s just the two of us or when Happy and Pepper are around. I wouldn’t want to have to explain to the government how you suffered a nervous collapse from all the strain.”
But Steve would be alright. They still needed to talk things over so Tony could explain, but Steve would be better because Tony had done it, and wasn’t that more important than a few more wounds to Tony’s heart? It was an ugly thing anyway, damaged and barely held together, and he’d known from the very first day that Steve had stumbled into his life that he’d be lucky to get through their relationship with just a few new scars.
“Are you crazy?” he burst out. “I’m not going to fucking punish you for—I’m not that kind of Dom, alright? I don’t do that.”
Dick was all for Bruce and Clark being together. Bruce wasn’t the type of guy to display a lot of emotions when he wasn’t in character, but Dick had honestly never seen Bruce so at peace with the world around him since the two of them started getting serious. They balanced each other out, with Bruce’s pragmatism and Clark’s optimism, and they were there for each other; they could depend on each other for anything, from lending a supportive ear after a bad day to being at their side when they battled an intergalactic warlord.
“Oh yeah, that was kind of weird, wasn’t it? They kept clumping around my face for some reason,” Tony said, wiggling his fingers next to his cheek. “I never could them to stop. Ah well, you win some, you lose some,” Tony said, shrugging. “So tell me about the mission. How did it go?”
“This will be a somewhat fluid list until we get to know each other better, but here are the basics. We’ve already discussed one of them, so rule number two is you don’t embarass me in public.”
“Don’t worry about it.” Dr. Stark smiles reassuringly, but his eyes dart downward before coming back up to meet Steve’s. “It’s a common reaction.”
He stayed the longest in what was obviously a playroom, looking at the various apparatuses that stood not-so innocently along the room and wondered what was inside the three armoires. He imagined he’d find out soon enough, and after staring at the St. Andrew’s cross for a while, he took a deep breath and closed the door, heading back to Tony.
“Please, the … the clamps. I want them,” Steve said, his shoulders twitching as he fought to keep the lower half of his body as relaxed as he could. The clamps wouldn’t exactly help with that, of course, but Steve always preferred pain with his pleasure. It’d taken Tony a long time to realize that when they’d first gotten together, but he knew it well now.
“Steve?” Tony said, not angry, no, of course not, but confused, and Steve didn’t know who was more surprised of the two of them, because he hadn’t meant to do it. It had happened on its own, and he could only be thankful that there were only a few other people in the hallway and they all had their backs to them.
When he’d woken up that morning, it’d been to a feeling of confusion. Why was the sun coming in from the wrong side of the room? Why did his sheets smell and feel different? The answers had come rushing in immediately after, all of the anger and impotence he’d struggled to deal with—that he was
He waits until Dr. Stark is safely behind the drape before bringing up both hands to cover his face. This is his friends and family’s fault, he decides, because how could they have ever thought it was a good idea to let him be an adult? If they truly loved him like they claimed, they’d keep him locked in his apartment and never give him the opportunity to embarrass himself like this again.
Coffee …? Yes, he did, he thought, his heart lifting slightly at the realization. Strong and black first thing in the morning, although later on in the day, Tony might add some cream and sugar as a poor meal replacement and for the quick energy boost.
didn’t know what he’d been planning to say. “We’ve got your baseline of one time per day. That’s your bare minimum. But you have to take into account the circumstances, right? It’s once a day when you’re single, but what about when you’re with someone?” Tony asked, and it was kind of surreal for Steve to hear his own thoughts echoed back to him from Tony of all people.
He pressed the power button with some trepidation, and the screen lit up, making it incredibly easy to see the cracks which hadn’t been there a minute before. That wasn’t good.
“Yes,” Steve said, resisting the urge to squirm a little. He didn’t remember being this ticklish—although not many people had tried to tickle him, so he might have been. If Tony would just use a little more pressure, it probably wouldn’t bother him at all. “Very much.”
“Which parts, Steve?” he bursts out, and he doesn’t mean to, he wasn’t going to get into this.  Tony knows that he shouldn’t be angry, or at the very least, he shouldn’t be
He can feel another surge of wetness, his ass empty and throbbing, and he has to grab the edges of the table before he does something he’ll regret.
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve said, because it didn’t anymore. Tony hadn’t been part of the project, and he hadn’t been keeping anything from Steve. The rest wasn’t important. “Nick just said some things that—”
“Wait,” Tony said, holding up his hand to stop Steve. “Keep them from becoming real ones. What do you mean by that?”
So, so grateful, Steve reminds himself as he looks down at his bed, which definitely won’t be seeing any use other than sleeping today, because he and Tony are being good and getting to know each other.
It’s an old argument. What’s the point in downloading the app when Steve is just as fast writing out the texts on his tv? It’s always just some combination of his class, light level, and willingness to join a group, and he rarely even does that much anymore since he’s got his friends. Why does he need to download the app for that? He has no idea what that has to do with anything, though, unless–
“Do you have anyone who you’re in regular contact with on a social basis?” she asked, and her voice was horribly gentle.
Never mind the fact that Steve hated the idea of someone having sex with Tony when he was this vulnerable and couldn’t really say no because of the circumstances.
He doesn’t want to abandon Tony, wants to stay with him and learn more about the things he likes to do and exchange silly stories and see if Tony kisses on the first date (and what else he’s willing to do as well), but in order to do that, he somehow has to admit that he’s leaking through his pants and barely refraining from throwing himself at Tony and riding him right then and there, other patrons be damned.
“Then why are we even having this conversation?” he asked, throwing his hands up, feeling like he’d gone from careening through the air, inches from crashing into the ground, only to have the system reboot at the last second. “Because the last thing he wants is me—”
Oh, the mortification will come later, and Steve will convince himself he’s not ever going back to Dr. Stark’s office, will refuse to go out with his friends on the off chance he sees one of the staff members in public …
He kept his words vague, because while the—brand new—phone was technically secure, that didn’t mean it was secure from SHIELD. He wouldn’t be surprised if SHIELD kept a transcript of every agent’s calls, and he didn’t want his questions about the newest upgrades Tony had given the helicarriers and whether or not Tony knew what the helicarriers were going to be used for to be part of his files.
Tony wanted to take his time, to give Steve the chance to ramp himself up more, but he found himself rushing through taking off his clothes, clumsy in a way he hadn’t been in years. He had to force himself to slow down, to just watch as Steve did everything he could to avoid making himself feel
, and sure, I’m not any Joe Schmoe off the street, but you have to be quite the problem child if they’re so eager to get rid of you.”
So Tony fingered him until he cried, or tied him up so it was logistically impossible to do anything else (even if they both knew Steve could break free in a second if he wanted) or Tony rubbed his cock all over Steve’s face and neck before coming across Steve’s outstretched tongue, and felt like he was avoiding a time bomb for a few minutes more.
Steve took a deep breath and then raised the ottoman. Okay. He could do this. The ottoman wasn’t heavy, but then, this wasn’t about strength. It was about endurance. About what he was willing to endure for Tony. About what Tony had endured for him. Except Tony had had to wait for three days, and Steve just had to wait until Tony told him to stop. That was all.
The words had been like a blow, leaving him hurt and reeling, because they could only mean one thing: Stark had finally decided to assert his rights as his Dom without asking, without caring how Steve felt or what he wanted. Nevermind what Steve had dreamed last night—although for one awful moment, he’d wondered if it was his fault that Stark had brought it up, if he’d just
“Well, I mean, the sooner the better, right?” he says, and it side-steps Dr. Stark’s question, but he’s sure Dr. Stark doesn’t want to be here any longer than he has to be.
Oh. He’d thought Tony was going to suggest Steve take some time to get used to the idea of pet play, or do some research maybe, but he wasn’t interested in either option. Having Tony with him, though, no matter how humiliating it’d be, was something he did want.
For one horrified second, he’s tempted to jump on the table right then and there and slam his ass down on the paper and cover every part of himself he can reach with the sheet Dr. Stark had given him.
“Go out where?” Steve asked suspiciously, even as his heart started to beat faster. They hadn’t left the penthouse all week. Why the offer now? Especially after the way Stark had been acting all day. What was Stark thinking? And did Steve even care if it meant leaving?
It’s all Steve can do not to cover his face. He just, he feels like he should be apologizing for Bucky, but it’s way too late for that.
Steve finds himself pressing more firmly against Tony, acutely aware that he’s mostly naked and in danger of getting even more so with every step they take as the towel attempts to slip free and Steve makes very little effort to stop it.
They’d started to achieve a balance back before everything had gone wrong, and maybe it was just a matter of time until they found it again, but in the meantime, its absence made him unsettled.
“I didn’t message Tony and ask him if he was bi,” Bucky parrots back, and Steve doesn’t believe him for a minute. “No, really, I didn’t,” Bucky says, and the amusement is practically oozing from his voice. “I’ll text you our conversation.”
Stark had paused. “Fuck, do you even understand the literary reference I just made? Whatever, look it up. Or not. Look up whatever you want. Or ask JARVIS. Quite truthfully, it’s faster than typing everything out, and he’ll always give you a truthful answer, even if it’s just, ‘I am not at liberty to answer your question,’ and he has a smooth, melodious voice, so there’s that.”
There’s a quick moment of silence where Dr. Stark doesn’t move, doesn’t do anything, and Steve wonders if he’s looking at how his nipples are standing at attention, if he can see Steve’s cock, lying hard against his stomach under the sheet, but then Dr. Stark steps up to the table, and Steve has other things to worry about.
“Then don’t worry about it.” Stark had slid on a pair of sunglasses and smiled sharply. “I’m not going to put a collar on you that you don’t want.”
“Go get the ottoman,” Tony said suddenly, making Steve flinch in surprise, and he nearly said, “Yes, Tony,” the habit of responding when Tony asked for anything deeply ingrained in him. He barely managed to keep back the words, and it shook him, how easily he might have done something wrong, might have destroyed whatever progress he’d made that day so far at earning Tony’s forgiveness because he’d been distracted. He had to be careful, had to
“Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head slightly, although not enough to dislodge Tony.  “You covered the entire
It wasn’t necessary. Nothing she was asking was information they wouldn’t put in his files after all, something which Stark had complete access to as his Dom. He appreciated the gesture, however, and the intent behind it.
“Yes. Please, Tony,” he said raggedly, desperately hoping that whatever Tony had planned would be enough, enough to teach him, enough to make up for every blow that wouldn’t fall on his back.
, and there was a certain expectation of isolation to a degree, like Tony could be in the room with Steve, but he wouldn’t be actively participating.
Two weeks later, she didn’t even bother to ask, pulling out a magazine that had been between her and the armrest of her chair as soon as they’d exchanged a greeting.
He’s heard that the best time to get an omega to orgasm is right after he just did, but this is ridiculous. It hasn’t even been ten minutes yet! He doesn’t think it’s even been
The next time they saw each other, Steve was on the ground, in the middle of getting his ass kicked by Loki. It wasn’t the way he’d hoped to see Tony again.
Steve could hear the creak of his chair, and he wanted to hide the vibrator, wanted to huddle into a ball so Tony wouldn’t notice him with SHIELD on his mind, and then Tony was walking past him.
, so I jokingly told you about this thing I’d heard that could work.  Then you wanted to try it out, though, which, color me surprised, and the rest, as they say, is history.”
the privilege of being taken with you?” Steve asked, his lips curling in a sneer, and even though Tony had expected it, he couldn’t help stiffening at the implied insult.
The fucking machine just wouldn’t work, guys. I tried and I tried, and I rewrote portions of this chapter multiple times, but it just never felt right. Sorry for the people looking forward to it! I might add it in an epilogue one day instead. Assuming I ever get the end of this fic, and it doesn’t go to a million words, omg. >_> I mean, this feels really close. But I said that about 25K ago too, so...
He stood frozen when they realized Tony was falling, not flying down, and his legs nearly buckled when the Hulk was able to grab Tony in mid-air before rolling him to the ground.  Thor reached Tony before he could, but he was the first to drop to his knees next to Tony, to press his ear against Tony’s chest and listen desperately for any sign of life.
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Really. All it means is that your glands are doing what they’re supposed to.”
,” Steve says, his voice rising as Dr. Stark starts pushing into him, and fuck, fuck, fuck, why does his finger seem so big?
“You look uncomfortable,” Tony said, his head tilted to the side, one arm resting on the back of the couch. “Why don’t you relax a bit, take some clothes off.”
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve said raggedly. At some point without Tony noticing, Steve had let go of him, and his hands were clenched tight against his thighs.
Living alone had improved his cooking, so he was able to make pancake batter from scratch, and he cleaned and halved some strawberries, putting everything away in the refrigerator. He got the pans out he’d need for the pancakes and the bacon, set the table, and then he waited for Tony. And waited some more, trying not to be impatient, even though that had never been a strong suit of his.
“I thought they’d forgotten about us,” she whispered as she stepped forward, tears starting to well in her eyes.
But when Steve would have happily gone down to his knees, Tony stopped him, using his leg to drag the ottoman over so it was snug against the couch, and then he turned Steve so his back was to him and guided him down. Steve ended up in the V of Tony’s legs, reclining on the ottoman against Tony’s chest, his body highlighted by the light from the screen.
deserve—is for us to be as open with each other as we can. Don’t we?” Tony asked imploringly. “You can tell me if you want to end things, if-if it’s too much, if I’m …” He swallowed the rest of that sentence down. “But you can also tell me if you want to stay. There’s no wrong answer, Steve, I promise. I just need to know.”
of him, and he wants to touch his cock so badly that his fingers are cramping. He doesn’t, though, barely even twitches when Dr. Stark swabs his cervix, and it’s not what Dr. Stark is doing so much as the possibility of what he
He grabbed the first guy and bashed him head-first into the wall, swinging the shield around into his partner’s face while the other two started cursing and scrambling for their radios. One roundhouse later and there was just the last one to deal with, but he seemed to know what he was doing, because he’d given up on reaching his radio and activated the baton in his hand, using it to block Steve’s arm and giving him a nasty shock in the process.
So, no, even knowing what was going to happen, what agreeing to Steve was going to do to him, he didn’t want Steve to go. But it’d never been up to him, had it?
Tony had spent a lot of time thinking about Steve when he couldn’t fall asleep the previous night, too wired from imagining all the various ways Fury was going to take advantage of his newfound knowledge. He’d finally gotten fed up with worrying about it and moved on to more important things since one, he’d always faced up to the mistakes he made, and two, while blabbering to Fury might not have been the smartest move on his part, it wasn’t like he could say
Steve may or may not make some kind of noise, because everyone in the meeting he’s in turns to look at him.
He remembered calling Steve, only for it to go immediately to voicemail, and being annoyed Fury was keeping him buried in meetings; seeing the coverage on the news in horrified disbelief; glancing at his phone obsessively and constantly checking with JARVIS that he hadn’t been sent something out of the ordinary, some kind of code or a spam email or
“It would be a lot of effort,” Steve said, squeezing Tony’s wrist. “I’m very determined when I want to be.”
his body—but one of the things he likes the most is his smile, honest and open, and the way it causes his heart to clench and makes him want to smile back.
He swallowed thickly and wondered when Tony would want him on his knees for a different reason. He’d only tried it a few times before, but he’d liked it, and he looked forward to doing it again. Maybe Tony would even grab his hair again, and Steve remembered the cascade of shivers that had triggered, his shoulders coming up in reaction. It made his nipples tingle, embarrassingly enough, and he lowered his fingers from his mouth to rub at one, but it didn’t soothe the sensation so much as make it ten times worse instead.
to believe: in Steve, in his feelings for him, in some kind of happily every after that Tony had never dared to hope for himself.
It’d left Steve anxious but eager, and he was glad they were finally going to get started. A part of him wanted to skip exploring the house and get down to business right away, but he never felt quite like he could relax in a new place until he’d seen it for himself, even knowing that JARVIS was watching over them. He owed it to Tony to make sure all of his attention was on him during the actual punishment and not on his surroundings, so Steve walked into every room, taking note of the layout of the house and the location of all the windows and doors.
What else could he have done, though? Honestly, what had Steve expected? No Dom worth his salt would’ve punished Steve for not feeling the same way, as if a person could force someone to love him. It didn’t work that way.
He goes to the coffee shop and glances inside, but Tony’s not there yet, so he waits, and it’s just a few minutes later that he sees Tony walking down the street toward him.
, but Stark’s expression was too open, not irritated or amused enough to go along with the comment the way Steve was imagining, and he realized he was just referring to the fact that he’d been on the computer twice today.
“You’re not thanking me,” Tony said, as he went back to stroking just the head, adding a twist at the top so he dragged them through more of the precome that steadily kept leaking out, and Steve sobbed.
He couldn’t worry about that right now, however.  He had to get them out of wherever it was they were.  And then turn Tony in.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologized, his hand gripping his doorknob tightly.  “I was just . . .”  He trailed off, having no idea how to finish that sentence.  “But yes, you can borrow a flashlight and some candles if you’d like.  Or, or you could even just stay over here until the power kicks back on.  I don’t mind,” Steve said, not wanting him to go.  “I even have some left-over pizza if you’d like.”
His heats have never been that bad. Oh, he wants to climb out of skin with the need to touch and be touched, has thought about Tony more than he feels comfortable admitting, but he can get through them without outside help.
She sat back down and opened her magazine with the cover blatantly on display. There was a grainy picture of Natasha and Clint firing from behind a car at several Chitauri, and across the top of the magazine were the words,
So...have some, haha, tentacle sex. >_> For those of you that aren't into that sort of thing, this chapter adds maybe just a teeny tiny smidge to the story, if that, so please feel free to skip.
He rubbed roughly at his face, smearing wet streaks across his cheeks as he cleared his throat. “It was just … the way it happened.” Because he’d wanted so terribly to believe in Steve. “That was so hard to take.”
“Gorgeous,” Tony crooned.  “I wish I could keep you like this forever, round and sweet.  You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Steve?” he asked, his hand picking up speed on Steve’s cock, his other hand moving to his nipples, pinching and rolling one and then the other as Steve whimpered.  “These would get full and swollen; you’d be so sensitive.  I’d take such good care of you, Steve.  I swear I would.”
He’s shivering all over, his ears ringing, and he only distantly hears Dr. Stark say absently, “Almost got it,” still sliding over and along Steve’s prostate.
And Tony, as his SHIELD-appointed Dom, had been part of the problem. At least in the beginning. Even when that had changed, though, even when Steve had wanted to be Tony’s, he’d gotten so used to the way Tony treated him that he’d started expecting it. Tony, who asked but never really demanded, who pushed, but only as far as he thought Steve would allow.
“There is a significant energy spike at their location, matching the one we saw in India. I count eighty-seven civilians within the potential blast radius.”
“Tony is fine,” Tony muttered moving over to another workstation and began fiddling with objects that lay there. Not actually doing anything, but relieving his jitteriness. It also felt like a good reason to not look Steve directly in the eye. “What can I do you for Captain?”
“Also, you two are very different.” That cut off any laughter in its tracks. Tony leveled Steve with a sobered, confused expression.
Tony didn’t give Steve a chance to utter a word. He made the decision that he would do better. Be at the new facility more often, because if there was one thing a Stark knew how to do it was present themselves how they wanted the public to absorb them. He could do that, Steve came all this way and he could do that. Also, if it meant that these idiotic late visits came to a stop, Tony was all on board for that.
Tony laughed again and for all of Steve’s faults Tony didn’t have this much fun with anyone else on the team. Even half paying attention as he was, he couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. “At least it’s efficient.”
“You want me to tell you what it looks like?” Tony didn't need to be told, he could imagine. Not a single strand of Steve’s hair could agree on which direction it wanted to go. While Steve had managed to wipe his face down, unlike Tony, his mouth was an abused red. In a few steps they’d be able to see imprints of Tony’s hand and teeth along Steve’s skin.
He might as well be upfront. “I actually have a floor for you,” he said slowly. Drawing out certain words so that the sentence became weirdly structured.
“What about me? I’ve got it built into my suit and the helicarrier too for that matter. If we have any civilians that we can’t get out of the zone, we need to get them in here. This hasn’t been battle-tested, there is a chance that the shields won't hold under the impact.”
This time when their mouths came together Tony was better prepared. As one tongue curled to meet another all he could taste was copper. All he could feel was the sting of his lower lip as he tangled his hands in Steve’s hair. Pulled hard so he’d come away with strands even as he brought him closer. Steve had one hand back to his face. The other around his throat sliding idly over his pulse. Just a hint of threat that had Tony nipping lightly at the cut he’d given Steve.
“This is idiotic,” Tony muttered to himself. Turning away from the controls to produce what could look like a watch or a bracelet. “Hold out your arm Rogers.”
Steve nodded tightening the various straps of an outfit Tony had designed. It was for the Shield agents and wasn’t tailored to Steve’s wide shoulders, but he still managed to make it work.
Steve took a minute in which he allowed the silence to stretch. Appeared to be processing the words and Tony’s anxiety built while he waited. “Gee, that’s very kind of you Tony.”
Tony liked to consider himself logical. This was the best result they could possibly gain after their previous confrontation. He should be happy and take the steps needed to mend bridges. There were higher stakes than his hurt feelings. They were smart, well intentioned thoughts.
“There’s your opening,” he had no doubt Steve would take advantage of it. “Get the civilians into the helicarrier. I’m going after Amora.” He shot up from the ground, adjusting his angle to catch up to where she was over the water. The green energy was permeating every wave that lapped impatiently against the shore. He didn’t need a visual timer to know they were in a countdown now.
“Damn right I do.” Tony dragged him down further so Steve had to brace himself against the glass. Drew his tongue along the whiskey that was rolling its way down Steve’s face. “Tell me otherwise when we’re done and I’ll know you’re a liar,” he pushed farther.
“Yes, Boss. I’ll be landing the vehicle in approximately one hundred and eighty-two seconds. Is there anything else you would like me to do for you?”
The reminder of the exercise was pointless. Terror had him right where it wanted. Steve was knelt over Tony barely breathing at all. It did nothing but emphasize the height and size disparity. Steve didn’t let go of either of his hands. The one held against the glass was in a tighter hold than the one pinned to his side. Tony debated kicking Steve but didn’t quite have the leverage for it.
“We have don’t know what the extent of her abilities are, it’s not safe to engage her by yourself,” came Steve’s voice over the comms. Disapproving and if he was still the Captain Tony knew it’d be an order not to go at all.
Tony blinked at the change of gears. “Aren’t you well informed? Two guesses at who the double agent is,” Tony said laughing bitterly.
“I call it like I see it. I also predict you are going to encourage one of them like the big sap you are within the next year,” Tony said just as dryly. “Nat still trying to hook you up?” Tony couldn’t suppress the smirk that went along with that question, she was surprisingly invested in matchmaking for a cold blooded spy.
Tony punched him in the face with as much human strength he could muster. Didn’t hesitate. Marveled at the way Steve’s head snapped back. A little surprised that his reflexes hadn’t saved Steve from the hit.
“But in the end I’ve always believed in building a better future than the present. I’ve tried living in the present, only got me into trouble.
“I’ve got this,” He was hoping it would be less of a lie this time around. Tony clapped Rhodes on the back a little too hard, they both winced. The awkwardness grew and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this uncomfortable around anyone. He wasn’t sure if it was the reality of Rhodey’s injury re-presenting itself or the fact that he’d just had some of the best and stupid sex of his life.
It was a good enough answer. Steve buried his face at the crook of Tony’s neck. Pushed forward roughly. Tony felt like his insides were burning up and had no doubt he’d be sore tomorrow. There was pain, but for all of that, pleasure in the overwhelming sense of fullness as Steve sunk all the way in. It was here that Tony wouldn’t be able to return from.
It had been five days since he’d met with Steve last. Tony knew better than to ignore Steve for too long. He would always take matters into his own hands if given the time. Tony knew that, but with every questioning text and missed call to the ancient technological device Tony found it harder to respond.
But then, that was exactly how he felt, aching and empty and needing to be filled, like he couldn’t get enough of Tony’s cock, no matter how many times he had it in him.
At least the Angel is pretty light, which is surprising considering how muscular he is, but Tony supposes it makes sense. If Angels were too heavy, they’d never get off the ground.
Steve knew he could reach back and guide Tony in, but it felt more daunting to touch Tony’s cock with his hand than to let him fuck him. He couldn’t even say why, but it was stupid, whatever the reason, and he could use the opportunity to lube Tony’s cock, which he’d forgotten to do.
Also, this is a loose definition of "forced bonding" but whatever, for the "forced bonding" square of my avengers_tables card.
“What do you mean?” he asked, because he was pretty sure he knew by the tone of Steve’s voice what he was insinuating, but he was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt—actually no, he just wanted to give him enough rope to hang himself.
“I know so,” she says, and the dawning wonder on Tony’s face is better than anything Steve could've imagined.
Steve’s eyes searched his for a second, and while he didn’t smile, his expression turned surprised and pleased, and he said, “Alright,” leaning forward to take Tony into his arms.
Dr. Stark nods, his expression turning sympathetic. “I’ve gone to the same doctor for the last twelve years. I know how stressful seeing someone new is, and as a matter of fact, the reason I was going to step out of the room was so I could get something to help with that.”
“Do you want my mouth?” Tony asked, his voice gone low and gravelly, and he wanted Steve to say yes, could almost taste him on his tongue already.  He rubbed his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock, eliciting another of those gorgeous sounds from Steve, and said, “I could lick all the come away and then take you into my throat, let you fuck my—”
“Oh, you know you like it,” Stark said, but he slowed down and swung back over the city, pointing out buildings and parks and little delis that served pastrami you could die for, and he told Steve how they could visit them all, whenever Steve wanted now that they’d finally left the roost.
“I told you you had a choice, and you left!” Tony said, and fuck, the alcohol had maybe not been a good decision after all.
do with Steve in this position that has him teetering on the brink of another orgasm. He just feels so
“I need twenty-four of your best roses, if you please,” and if his smile is a little more flirtatious than charming, well, who could blame him.
“And you didn’t think that should be something we discussed before you asked?” he said, his voice rising. “We might have completely different ideas about what’s appropriate—”
“That seems like it’d take a lot of energy,” Tony said, letting out a weak huff of laughter, “so no.”
“Yes, of course.” He can’t help tensing as Dr. Stark reaches out, but it’s not as bad, now that he’s expecting it. It even starts to feel … kind of good. The way massaging a knot of muscle feels good, a little painful but you don’t want it to stop.
Steve blinks and realizes Dr. Stark has put up a drape, which is connected to the two poles Dr. Stark brought in, one on either side of the exam table.
“Hold onto the headboard,” he said, and fuck, Steve was a thing of beauty as he stretched out his arms over his head, the muscles in his back moving smoothly. Tony thought he could stare at the dip of his waist for hours, the rise and curve of his buttocks, the firm lines of his thighs as he flexed against the bed.
“Of course you can,” Tony said gently, and Steve’s eyelashes fluttered closed as he sat back onto his heels and pressed his forehead to the top of Tony’s thigh, his hands loosely gripping Tony’s calf.
“And even knowing all of that, I still want to ask again,” Steve said, the words filling Tony with a dangerous hope. Steve’s fingers squeezed around his arms as his eyes dropped down to Tony’s shoulder, Tony’s gaze following, and Tony could see the edges of the bandages through his blurry vision, all too obvious since Tony was shirtless, something he hadn’t noticed until now. “Even after—”
Steve watched Stark leave the room, knowing he should say something to stop him but unable to find the right words.
“Good?” Tony asked, his voice hoarser than normal, and Steve nodded. It wasn’t until after Tony slowly pulled his hand away, his fingertips lingering on Steve’s jaw in a caress that Steve kept leaning his head into so it’d last as long as it could, that he made the connection that Tony was referring to the collar. Steve ducked his head to hide the flush that threatened to overtake his face and focused on the coolness of the leather around his neck instead.
. Look at it. LOOK AT IT. (assuming you're not at work as it is extremely NSFW) It makes me so happy. *sobs* It’s not a scene in the fic itself, but it might become one, because damn. DAMN.
“It’s alright. I’m not actually bothered by it, just curious what prompted it,” she said, an invitation to share.
“And while I’m sure the sex would be fantastic—I mean, when I started debating all of this, I thought about all the things I’ve been wanting to do to you,” Tony said, his eyes turning dark for a second as the tip of his tongue touched the corner of his mouth, and Steve nearly shivered, “and I almost gave in.”
“Um, actually,” he says, because there’d been that one time, but it’d been for charity so he hadn’t actually gotten paid.  And he hadn’t been completely naked either.  He’d been wearing a strategically placed Swedish model, which he’d rather enjoyed.
“Good. Because that’s the only thing keeping me from delivering the thrashing of your life. Get out of here.”
Steve felt saliva begin to gather in his mouth, and he swallowed hastily, glancing at the security camera out of the corner of his eye. He couldn’t believe Tony had asked JARVIS to tell him that, and although JARVIS sounded normal, he had no idea what to say to him now.
“Look at me,” Tony said, and Steve did, his sight made blurry by the tears that Tony had predicted obscuring his vision. Nothing hurt, but the tears had come anyway, and it made him feel helpless for Tony to see him this way, made his thighs clench together as his cock pulsed and dripped while he kept doing his best to please Tony.
“So apparently the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” it said, and Steve had to lock his knees to stay upright. Steve didn’t know why it caught him off guard, but hearing Tony’s voice after so long ….
He hadn’t been sure. He’d wondered if Tony recognized how hard he was trying. How much he wanted to make up for doubting Tony. For leaving him alone and being the reason invaders came into Tony’s home. For not loving Tony the way he should.
“You are one kinky motherfucker,” Steve hears dimly as he opens his eyes, and he groans, immediately shutting them again.
Of course Tony’s first priority would’ve been his family, so days before he’d shown up at the ceremony, he’d looked for the two of them. Only to discover that Pepper had gotten remarried three years ago.
“I know how to say no.” It came out harsher than he’d intended, but for Tony to say that, for that to be why Tony had safeworded … it would’ve been one thing if Steve had-had, fuck, if he’d refused to obey maybe, or if he’d used his strength to break the machine, or heaven help him, if he’d tried to lash out at Tony somehow. But what was he supposed to do with the fact that Tony had stopped everything for his sake? As if losing Tony was something he should be
He needed to get out of there. It had taken him years to realize just how destructive his inner voices could be, and if he wanted a chance in hell of being able to
Steve, who’d not only told Natasha and Clint that they were together, but had been willing to show them as well.
He knows Dr. Stark is an alpha, has signed the release forms that say he doesn’t need another omega or beta in the room during the examination with him, and he doesn’t understand how Dr. Stark holds himself back when an omega like him comes in, someone who
“I’ll be back late,” Tony said, looking down at his phone, swiping past one screen to the next. “You don’t need to wait up.”
what I was or wasn’t doing?” Tony demanded, hitting his own chest as if to emphasize that he was right there.
That was true. A rinse was probably all he needed. Except . . . he really wanted to sleep with Tony tonight, wanted it more now than he had before even, and that meant not being sticky with sweat or smelling of sex, not giving Tony a reason to hesitate about having him there.
whether or not it was actually Tony, but rationality didn’t hold a candle to the pain of being in the same room as someone that looked and sounded and acted like Tony and not being able to touch him.
Steve knew it was foolish of him, that he had no right to think about a permanent place in Tony’s life now, especially considering why they were there, but it still gave him hope in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time.
“It’s all right, Steve,” Dr. Stark says soothingly. “You’re doing just fine,” but he’s not because Steve’s hips are tilted up now, and Dr. Stark ends up getting his prostate multiple times in a row.
It hadn’t helped that he’d been all too aware of being in his own bed. He’d wanted to sleep in Tony’s, but his courage had failed him. He hadn’t known what he would’ve done if Tony had come in and ordered him back to his own room, or if Tony had taken one look at him and turned and left. So he’d come here instead, hoping that Tony would join him but knowing that he wouldn’t. Tony never came into Steve’s bedroom, had never, the whole time Steve had lived with him, and would never, Steve knew without being told, because it was an island of privacy that Tony refused to invade.
“I can’t believe you’re picking me up in a Prius,” he sighs, and the dawning happiness on Steve’s face makes his heart clench in his chest.
“No, Steve. I can do it,” Natasha said calmly, squaring her shoulders. “We already know Tony finds me attract—”
Tony didn’t know why the idea of Clint and Natasha coming for lunch made him so possessive, but it did. It made him completely, irrationally, and ridiculously possessive. He’d tried to ignore it at first and pretend the event wasn’t hanging like a black cloud on the horizon, a sure harbinger of doom. When that hadn’t worked, he’d tried to convince himself that there was nothing they could or would do that’d make Steve leave him any sooner than he was already planning. And when
It was another reason to hate it there, however, although he reluctantly had to give Stark credit for revealing the cameras to him. Since Steve had already given written permission that he could be watched, it’d only been Stark’s sense of decency that had led to the admission. He wondered if all of Stark’s guests were told or only the ones that were going to live with him for any period of time. He was also curious as to why Stark had them at all—but then, Stark had already had attempts on his life. Steve remembered reading about his time in Afghanistan and then near-death at the hands of his business partner, and that had been before he came out as Iron Man and made himself a target. Maybe for Stark, the cameras were a necessary evil.
Captain America blinked, giving himself a little shake.  “You need to get out of here,” he said, turning around, and Tony gave a silent whistle, the back view was almost as good as the front.  “I don’t know what Nick told you, but I’m not—I’m not safe right now.”
“Put on the suit,” he said, and he was so angry, rage heating his face and making his hands tremble. Steve knew that he shouldn’t let what Tony had get to him—that it wasn’t the time or the place—but it was Tony. And Tony had always been able to get under his skin. “Let's go a few rounds,” he said, and in that instant, he wanted to fight Tony; wanted to beat away his pain.
He shook his head. The only things he might have wanted to say—that he loved Tony, that he was sorry for hurting him—didn’t feel appropriate, not now that he was on the cusp of finally being able to prove he was actually sincere. Nothing else was important.
“Don’t believe him,” Tony pressed on when they were let in the lower level elevator. “If you’d only see what goes on behind the Tower walls, you’d be shocked.”
This time when they came together for a kiss Tony laid on top of Steve, skin to skin. Steve wasn’t sure which one of them shivered due to the contact.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark. My grandfather was in the 45th Infantry division. You crossed paths outside Strasbourg,” he addressed the last part to Steve.
Tony looked at him with a considering frown as he usually did when he wasn’t sure if Steve was actually was quoting pop culture or not.
Tony utilized his left hand, free, in a delicate facepalm. ”I don't know how to take that.  Embarrassing, condescending or dirty.”
Tony sighed theatrically but acquiesced. “Alright. You drive. It’s got pedals and a steering wheel, nothing’s changed in 70 years.”
Tony opened his mouth in shock. ”Why are you always funny when I'm too uncomfortable to appreciate it properly?”
Steve knew a big part about the thing between him and Tony had to do about their chemistry, about how they never really had been able to ignore one another.
Tony expected Barnes to turn and leave at that, come back later, but he took halting steps in, stationing himself on the other side of the bed.
Steve breathed deeply. “Alright. For future reference, I don’t need help finding someone. It was bad enough when Natasha tried to act as a matchmaker. I’ll retire if you start, as well.”
Steve gave it a second before giving in. “A bit, yeah. I mean, he didn’t generally care for what was appropriate so it’s not like he kept it very professional, but I’m pretty sure he didn’t mean anything by it.”
Tony strained his head around to press their faces together as he came. Steve stroked him gently through it.
They all made it in mostly uninjured, though Steve had felt a bullet graze his flank. They were a good distance away from the Hydra base when Tony said something about it.
Steve could smell Tony’s cologne, feel the heat of his face against his own, the prickle of his mustache.
”FRIDAY helped. A lot. I didn't really have time to match every cut to the music. Also,” Tony realized to add, ”I wouldn't call it a love letter.”
At least his plan worked, Steve thought. It was just that this, this was completely unexpected, out of the left-field, not how it was supposed to go. Tony’d said he wanted –
“You ready?” He asked, nodded at the technician in the room aside Tony: probably there to watch him.
Tony seemed to understand how close he was, already, for he slid his hand down Steve’s thigh to grab his ass, pressing his blunt nails into the skin while his teeth caught on Steve’s lip.
"Ah, but wouldn't that mean that it's reciprocal? Your imagination has so far come up with nothing. So, we clearly aren't on nickname basis or --"
“The workshop doesn’t do it for me, either,” Steve said. He knew these were uncharted waters and the last thing he wanted was to make Tony more uncomfortable around him, but weirdly enough this topic seemed to be transforming into an inside joke between them. Steve would gladly use his romantic proclivities as a conversation point if it kept things friendly between them.
He started running a moderate speed, trying not to give much attention to Steve lapping him all the time. Tony wondered if it wasn't a good thing they would never have sex. He was perfectly fit after the Extremis operation but keeping up with a thirty-year-old supersoldier... He'd dodged a bullet there, really. He was sure the relief would set in at any moment, now.
Steve nodded slowly. ”That's a good position to take, but I'm not sure I see how me punching this bag into your wall is making people's lives better.”
Tony felt a stab of embarrassment somewhere deep inside. Not because of what he'd said, exactly, but to have been caught in a private moment.
Tony’s hand found Steve’s left thigh where it was pressing against his hip. Tony’s grip on it was like a catalyst to pick up the rhythm of their bodies. Steve moaned involuntarily against Tony’s mouth, surprised at the wave of pleasure that hit him.
“I was wondering if you wanted to go through some specs Fury sent me together?” He lied, except that he had meant to show the blueprints of Hydra artillery to Tony anyway.
Tony came to stand close to Steve, not exactly just behind him, but too close to be completely casual.
In the penthouse, Tony finally seemed to forget his short bout of sobriety that had lasted the car ride and went for the bar. On the way, he took off his tuxedo jacket and threw it on the counter.
There was a brief silence and Steve was somewhat surprised Tony didn’t reach for the minibar. That was usually a given in a limo with Tony.
How to say that to Tony, though, when the man couldn’t apparently make up his mind whether he was up to something straightforward and physical?
Otherwise Tony kept the video from becoming clearly sexualized. It would have been slightly crass, and not really fitting for the wholesome picture they wanted to paint about the Avengers at the moment.
Tony stopped in his tracks to the driver’s side of the dark blue fancy sports car and turned to give Steve an incredulous look. “I didn’t know you could drive.”
He started to wonder that if flashing a strip of bare skin felt like this, what would a touch feel like.
And alright, maybe he was doing this on purpose, alluding to his body where he knew Tony could hear them well, standing some feet behind them with Clint, but he didn’t have any other ideas. He was hopeful Natasha didn’t clue in on what he was doing.
“I can’t deny it, I love it when Cap goes full righteous mode on them, especially when it comes with an aftertaste of Vibranium in your teeth,” Clint joked.
After, Tony dropped down on top of him and pressed his face against Steve’s neck. Sated and content, Steve stroked his back until they drowsed off.
He had been lucky Pepper came back. She balanced him, got him out of his head. She made him remember that not everything was on him. The whole world wasn't his responsibility: he shouldn't act like it was.
He’d had ulterior plans anyway, hoping the convenience of being already unclothed and in a bed would result in Tony staying the night.
Bucky nudged Steve with his toe from where he sat at the other end of the sofa. ”I don't understand why you even try that with me. Say you don't want to talk about it, and I'll leave you alone after a while, but don't lie when it's so obvious.”
Tony seemingly acquiesced, though Steve had the feeling this wasn’t going to be the last time he heard about it. Tony had a habit of bringing up uncomfortable matters at unfortunate times, often to just crack a joke.
”Why don't you tell me,” Tony demanded, not nicely. All of a sudden they were earlier incarnations of themselves, ready to bite each others' head off for the smallest of provocation. Steve was fairly certain they'd had a similar conversation before, in a kitchen, just like this. Well, Tony's hand hadn't been cupping his breast, but to be fair, they were touching each more often than not during their spats. One memorable time Tony had accidentally tickled his side when he had tried to grab Steve's arm. Steve had given an involuntary giggle and Tony had lost the plot for a few seconds, at least, forgetting he was angry.
He waited a few minutes until the discussion turned to something else and he could easily get up with the excuse of getting more drinks and food from the kitchen.
After ten or so minutes of silence, Steve was acutely reminded that for all his at times never-ending jawing, Tony didn’t care for small talk.
“Well. All who were still awake at 5 am heard Clint moan about nobody having any taste. And ‘Cap being surprisingly gay and mooning over Stark’.”
It had. They had fallen asleep tangled together in each other’s arms. They had separated mostly to their own sides during the night, Steve noticed when he woke up first.
When Steve started kissing back, Tony began moving again, now with a single-minded focus. He broke off the kiss and pushed himself upward so his weight was mostly on his arms.
Steve considered that for a brief moment – if only to call Tony’s bluff, but decided it was too much. A compromise between modesty and comfort, he stripped down to his boxer briefs.
Steve sat up. The sheet pooled at his waist. Tony couldn't help a glance at him. Steve didn't bother covering himself up. He rather had his nakedness be a reminder of what had happened just a few hours before. ”Will it help?”
”Speak of the devil,” Tony said and grinned. He lifted his arm and curled it around Steve’s shoulders.
“Just in case you go rogue,” Steve suggested. “Not that it’ll help them much after you make new adjustments. But at least it’s somewhere to start with the anti-Iron Man gadgetry.”
Alright, he figured as he turned back to his drink. That hadn’t been very platonic, as far as he was able to read the signs.
Tony surged up and kissed him at that and that hadn’t been Steve’s goal but maybe, for just a few more seconds –
, my God, so you know, I don’t actually think it’s going to happen. You just… drive me crazy and for once I thought I’d change the script.”
Tony kissed him wetly, hungrily, his mouth open. He broke the kiss to breathe against Steve's lips: ”Get down.”
And sure enough, he was tempted to take the offered option of this-talk-never-happened, but, he realized, he was curious what Tony saw for them. He was beginning to think saying the unsaid might be worth it.
”We'll wake someone up if we continue,” Steve whispered, all of a sudden aware that they were not alone in the house.
"As long as you are aware that you look ridiculous. Which brings me to the elephant in the room. What's with the skintight black number?"
At the tower, they took the elevator up to the penthouse, Steve not pushing the button to where his apartment was on the level below Tony’s.
Tony started on the buttons on his shirt as he went into the ensuite. ”Feel free to make yourself comfortable. Take off what’s rest of your suit – or don’t. What you feel like.”
Knowing he was really pushing his luck with the nudity, Steve collected his clothes and started to dress. Tony was following his example, though a bit slower, something obviously still on his mind.
“What? No, I didn’t. I just thought I’d inform you about his inclinations after I found out. A public service,” Tony defended himself.
There wasn’t enough room for two on the cot so Steve lowered himself to the ground. Why they had let them stay together, he’d didn’t understand. Maybe, he hoped, there were rookies in charge of this Hydra group.
He could see Steve with blood trailing down his face. Dying, and it was no less bearable than the first time. A world where he was alive and Steve was dead… A world where the entire team was dead. A world where he wasn’t dead. It didn’t make any sense. None at all.
“Don’t like it?” Steve let his hand wander along his jaw, touching it in a look of contemplation. Still too far away for Tony to take stock of his eyes. Determine his intentions.
“I dunno. Guess I’ll have to wait and see.” Steve moved his hand away from the zipper. Curling it around Tony’s thigh, pulling the limb up into a folded position. Used his thumb to rub circles there.
“Just my first name!” Peter shouted over his shoulder whilst sprinting across the lawn, less out of excitement and more to get away from the thrumming vein in Tony’s forehead.
Rhodey’s wide stretching smile didn’t last long before a more serious mask took its place. “We’re gonna talk about this later. Go save the Jersey Shore for the both of us.” He nodded towards Steve who was almost at the end of the hall and at the door leading outside. Rhodes may be walking away and teasing now, but this was far from over. It wasn’t a heart to heart Tony was looking forward to. In fact, he was suddenly remembering a conference in Australia he needed to desperately attend.
“Yeah,” Tony said stiffly and then continued under his breath, “Got a whole room in the Stark Mansion with memorabilia and everything.” Not that he went there often.
“I wasn’t-” Steve started looking frustrated. “I’ve had sex before Tony.” He emphasized Tony’s name. “Which you know. You also know why we need to talk about this.”
Steve’s face scrunched together like he’d tasted something disgusting. “I wasn’t romantically interested in Howard, Tony.”
Maybe ignoring all of those phone calls was a poor plan, but Steve showing up like this wasn't a much better one.
The two additional civilians were police officers standing far to the right, guns drawn and trained on the figures standing before them. Both of their postures appearing to relax when they saw the vivid colors of his suit. “We got this from here. Make sure quadrant four is cleared up,” Tony said sub-vocally, tapping into their radios to deliver the message to them directly rather than broadcast it to everyone on the field. The officers didn’t withdraw their weapons but made a careful retreat back onto the boardwalk.
Steve was grinning in an infuriating fashion. “I’ve become a rebel in my old age,” he called back to Tony. His arms folded neatly over his chest, showcasing all of the muscular definition Tony shouldn’t be staring at.
Steve had his brows drawn together. Tony knew he was probably struggling to follow the twists of this conversation, but his next words came easy. “We won't. Not with you around and I don’t mean as an Avenger. There’s more than one way to support a team. Help me train the new recruits. They are shaping up, but they aren’t quite a team yet.”
“I hear congratulations are in order.” Tony stiffened. Not because of the words themselves, but the cold look that accompanied them. If adrenaline hadn’t been flooding his system before it certainly was at the moment. The conversation was hitting a turning point where Tony could be more certain of what action needed to be taken.
“On your little road trip?” Tony questioned. Wanting to turn his gaze elsewhere, but it felt like admitting defeat.
“Nothing you could have prevented.” Tony looked over to the side. “Believe me I’ve looked at it from every angle.”
“Well,” Tony started and brought his hand to a table top. He thrummed his finger against the surface. “During the rebuilding process I thought since it had been renamed the Avengers Tower it would make sense to give all of the Avengers their own spaces in the tower. So I designed living quarters for each of you in the case you were in the area.” Tony changed his posture so he could easily speak with hand gestures. “Uh don’t feel obligated to use them after today or anything. Just they’re there if you ever need a place to crash or if we are getting ready for a group mission. Not really sure what the arrangement you have with Shield is.”
Meeting small rings of blue that were more familiar than his own eyes was startling. It reflected back everything he’d ever felt. Ever thought. All the moments of restraint because the world would come crashing down the second they came together. Tony waited for his vision to be filled with rubble next. Breathed in a shaky breath that Steve was temporarily allowing him. Tony looked down at all the complicated straps and zippers happening in Steve’s outfit.
“We don’t know enough about what the Asgardian is up to, to clearly know how and if we can counteract.”
“Oh, we are doing this. All the way. Like this. Okay,” Tony stared at the hand extended towards him before clasping it. Steve’s grip was strong, but not in an overly assertive way. “I’m Tony Stark. Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist.” Steve looked like he wanted to make a comment but resisted. “You may see me flying around in a red and gold suit sometimes. Hard to miss.”
“That’s the only reason you’re making the commute? I’d have thought you’d have found a way to anti-Vision your walls by now.” Tony leaned back into empty space, the soft, careful measure of Steve’s voice doing nothing but setting him on edge. His proximity jarring when Tony spent all day keeping his distance from everyone. He was there to help train, nothing else.
He hadn’t heard a word from Steve since they parted ways months ago after the Chitauri incident. He’d only finished renovating Avengers Tower a couple weeks ago. The rest of New York City was still in the stages of recovery. Tony was doing his best to speed that up so that its residents could get back to their lives. Perhaps looking at an unbroken environment would eradicate some of the new fears they now lived with every day.
Tony forced himself to look away and back at Rhodey. It only took half a second for Rhodes to swing his head back and forth between the two of them. Pieces coming together perfectly behind his eyes.
Tony breathed out while stepping back from Steve and too many complicated emotions. All of that practice in pushing feelings to a background noise now felt like an under-worked muscle. It didn’t have the strength it use to in that moment. He breathed again, slower this time. Turned to walk further down the small airfield. He didn’t look back.
“I would have never guessed,” Tony said, resisting too much sarcasm. “What can I do you for Cap? You’ve seen me every day this week and still needed more?” Tony drummed his hands lightly along the piano top, trying to summon up some arrogance to paste on. “I can’t say I blame you if that’s the case.”
Tony’s fingers continued to fly over the schematics, but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Steve. Terribly awkward and uncomfortable Steve. “Why? We’re friends and you were friends with Howard after all,” he tried for a different angle.
“Okay fine. I don’t like you. You don’t not like me. Happy? If you want to talk go find Sam or Bucky. I’m sure your pals will love to chat it up. I need you to leave though. Now.”
“Really, Tony?” Hearing his name in Steve’s mouth was a shock to the system. He wanted to shovel it out so Steve would never be able to use it again. The idea of wedding invitations hadn’t pleased the former captain in the slightest. If anything he appeared to be gathering up anger as he stood there. And what right did he have to that anymore? Assuming he had any right to begin with.
The words may not have been true, but the iron grip on his lungs lessened in its pressurized hold. He’d never gone into details with Steve about what he’d seen. Steve had never gone into details with him. He didn’t plan on changing that, but he still needed to know what more looked like. “Can I ask you something Cap?”
Tony occasionally entertained the idea that if he lived in a completely different universe where he had any iris color than brown he wouldn’t have this problem. That the additional pigments were somehow the fault of why he never looked away when he should. That in a world with blue eyes, Tony would see Steve leaned up against his car and be able to walk right back into the Avengers facility without a single care in the world.
Tony gave a weak smile, curling his hands into fists and lowering them back to his side. “No, no she wasn’t.” He sighed again, each one heavier than the last. Tony was sinking like a stone with the assumption that there was a bottom, but what if there wasn’t? How much darker would he allow the world to get on his watch? “But she didn’t tell me the cost of creation either. That the bigger you build the more you take.” Tony forced himself to pause and leer at Steve. “I’ve always been more of a giver.” Cue the wink.
“I wasn’t expecting you to make them for everyone.” The grousing would have been convincing if Tony hadn’t risked a glance in Steve’s direction. He was smiling fondly up at the ceiling.
“I’m not rejoining the team.” He couldn’t be in the battlefield when instead of being able to run calculations the only number that matter was one hundred and seventy-seven. Too high of a price to pay.
Only when Tony imagined Steve, he was never questioning.  Unsure. There wasn’t any lightness or concern in the depths of his iris. He didn’t hesitate to move closer into his space. This Steve hesitated. Took in Tony’s languid pose on the couch. His rumpled up shirt and loose pants, mussed up curls and the lack of stylization with his facial hair. This Steve’s mouth turned down in a deep frown.
Tony still found himself smiling. He brought his hands to Steve’s thigh and squeezed it. “Thank you.” Tony then placed his hands on the keys. Arranging his fingers as he brought music sheets into mind. Trying to remember how he use to order all the movements.
“I hear you were friends with my father. Won’t hold that against you, no worries,” Tony breathed and then picked up into a faster pace, “It’s an honor to meet you too. Grew up listening to stories about you. You were my hero,” Tony paused wishing he could backtrack on the last part. Erase it from existence. Oh man, he needed to figure out how to get a good night’s rest.
Tony put all of his weight into aggressively shaking Steve’s hand off. It didn’t budge. “Knock it off Rogers. I’m on a clock and this is not up for negotiation,” he broke out his reprimanding voice again, but it was going higher pitched than he’d like. It wasn’t the most intimidating words and it did nothing to deter Steve from glowering down at him.
“Your engagement.” The words sounded vaguely like a curse. Fell to the floor as if they weighed thousands. Tony couldn’t help but be surprised.
He lay there dazed, he could hear a buzzing in his ears. There was nothing but that buzz for an eternity of moments. The rest of his body too busy playing catch up to process what was happening. When his surroundings floated back into focus Tony couldn’t concentrate on his cracked eye slits or the different graphics FRIDAY was rapidly displaying for him. All he could concentrate on was his own breathing. Taking stock of that before moving onto the body. His legs moved his toes. Then all the way from his shoulder to his fingertips. Tony rolled his head and grimaced. He may have survived it without any last damage to his person, but getting out of bed tomorrow was going to be an experience.
He rattled off his thoughts on Natasha and Bruce, “They are alike in all the wrong ways. They’d hide away from the world together. Which, romantic, I guess? But not the best foundation for a relationship.” Tony would prefer to stay out of it entirely, but the sidelong glances were hard to miss. He couldn’t believe anyone could be more obvious about their attraction than those two.
Steve was looking at him seductively from under his lashes. Maybe it wasn’t intentional. Didn’t matter, Tony was captured. Wanted to ask if Steve was too. “Tell me you want this,” Steve said bringing his mouth past the waistband. Breathing over the fabric that covered Tony’s cock.
“It may not seem as bad now, with how far medicine has advanced. Back then all my health problems were as good as a death sentence. They didn’t expect me to make it a few months, let alone years.”
Tony said nothing. Didn’t allow himself to think of the reasons why he needed to say something. Just glared back with all the emotions he’d never been able to make sense of.
Tony’s laughter was shaky. “When I was a kid I use to daydream that they would find you alive. That you would stand in front of me and my father. That you would tell me that I matter and that he would believe it too. Isn’t it funny how much things change?”
There was no point in denying it. “It’s a little what it looks like,” Tony admitted, pasting on a fake smirk. If he thought his heart had been pounding before, the concept of battle had nothing on this. Whatever this fucked up thing was, it was no longer just between just Steve and Tony. It had escaped into reality and Tony could see the full extent of his mistakes reflected back at him through someone else’s eyes. What he found there was damning.
for taking the time to beta this chapter. I appreciate it so much! Thank you to the readers for reading and commenting. <3 Please enjoy.
“I don’t want to wear a bunch of monkey suits Tony,” Steve said, but his mouth was twitching upward.
“No civilian casualties. Managed to keep it out of the news. Think we did alright without you Cap.” Tony said dryly looking up at Steve from under his lashes.
“You wouldn’t be giving it to me if you didn’t think it’d work,” Steve said, that annoying smirk on his face.
“Contrary to popular belief, the fake flattery comes off as condescending. Try not to bring anymore kidnapped children to the facility Rogers. I’ll see you and your band of criminals at nine tomorrow morning.” Tony straightened out his suit. Steve tracked every movement wordlessly. He took the win much more gracefully than Tony would have. Appearing more solemn than anything else.
“The man behind the mask?” Steve questioned. Appearing thoughtful, bottom lip pursed as he looked around a room that held no answers. Tony knows, he had looked.
Steve’s mouth became that straight impassive line, his eyes getting a hard look in them. He glanced away towards the wall, the armchair. Collecting his thoughts before facing Tony again. “I came here weeks ago now. I told you I missed you, that we needed you there.” Steve paused. “Thank you for helping.” Tony narrowed his eyes. “I still-” He paused again. Dragging his hand through his hair. It wasn’t often to see Steve be so deliberate with picking out precise words. He was much more off the cuff, but there he was struggling next to Tony and Tony was letting him struggle.
Tony leaned against the wall, next to where the doorframe would. There was the temptation to jump out preemptively, but maybe he had gained a little bit of patience in his older age. “I’ve got your back shell head.”
Tony couldn’t fully interpret the look he was at the receiving end of. It was obviously another rejection in this line of question. “I could- Is it because you don’t-” It’d been over a year since the discovery that Bucky Barnes was alive and Tony knew he could help. Do more in a way that wouldn’t hurt anyone. “The things I can do with recognition software you wouldn’t believe. Let me help you.”
Steve stared for a long moment. Long enough to make Tony shift and look out the window. Steve had been doing that a lot lately. Tony let… Steve see too deeply into his broken soul and now all he got were those long searching stares. What Steve was searching for remained unclear, but if Steve was looking to fix something in there Tony would be happy to inform him the train had left that particular station.
The landing onto the sand surface was gentle enough that it would have been undetectable if it weren’t for the door sliding open to reveal what the heat signatures had hinted at. Three Asgardians facing the hellicarier. The only barrier the five humans standing before them. A quick scan revealed there was nothing physically keeping them in place. If the civilians stared blankly ahead, left hand at their side, right holding what looked to be a knife or something along those lines across their chest.
“Really, what do you want Rogers? Not the suit, supposedly. Not my health initiatives for the team. Tech? I’ve been keeping up with repairs.” His words were too full of intoxication to fully get the defensive aggressiveness he’d been going for. Better an angry Steve than one helping him down the hallway to his bedroom. “What do you want from me?”
Tony’s breath was coming too fast. Maybe he’d throw up. Throw up the contents of everything that made him, him. Let them spill across the floor so Steve could recoil away in disgust and Tony could finally walk away as a better person. “You told me I could have saved you.” Us. “You asked me to do more.”
Tony turned and walked away before Steve would have a chance to. Whenever Tony saw Steve retreating from him it caused a panicked jumbled of flight or fight responses he hadn’t sorted out yet. It made him feel doused with ice water. Shaken with regret. Drained and desperate for just one more second of contact. All of these emotions he had names for, but wasn’t willing to label. He did stupid things when in the grips of turmoil and there were only so many stupid things Tony could do before there was no going back.
He hurried downstairs, saying, “JARVIS, please turn off the music,” as soon as he walked into Tony’s lab.
“It’s fine. These kind of things always look a lot worse than they actually are.” The words were dismissive, but Steve knew better than to believe him. “Besides, it’s just an elevator ride down and up. I’m pretty sure I can handle it.”
suggested they end early multiple times and had finally been the one to call it quits—that it hit him.
? He couldn’t seem to look away from Tony’s fingers. “Ever since the serum, it hurts if I don’t . . .”
He’d never call himself shy, but he definitely felt self-conscious. Sure, he’d been naked for Tony just a few hours ago, but he hadn’t been the only one with his clothes off, and Tony had been a lot closer. He felt distinctly vulnerable standing up there for—well, for Tony’s viewing pleasure.
“Steve,” Stark wheezed, and Steve glanced down.  He looked horrible, pale and drawn, his skin clammy.  It was obvious that he needed immediate medical attention, but there was nothing Steve could do.  “Left at the fork.  Two rights.  Access code is 598320.”
“Yeah, of course, Steve. Let’s get back into position,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve hesitates slightly before parting his legs once again.
There was supposed to be more medical kink in this chapter. It just wouldn't work though. Seriously, I could write pages and PAGES of medical kink. But no.
“We did terminate the contract,” Tony said and apparently they had some old business to clear up first before they got down to the real stuff. Fine, it wasn’t like he had anything better to do than relive an extremely painful period of his past.
If he could just do something or even understand what he’d done to hurt Steve enough to lead to this …
think about it, about having to tell Tony every single thing he’d hoped Tony would do to him, about how humiliating it’d be to reveal some of his base desires.
Growing up, people had said all kinds of things to Tony, to his face and behind his back, and he’d learned how to handle the insults, the lies, even the truth most of the time.  But that was when it was from people who didn’t matter, people he didn’t look up to, and maybe he didn’t know Steve Rogers, but Captain America?  He didn’t think there was a person alive who knew more about him than Tony did.
He barely caught Steve shrugging from the corner of his eyes. “No one special.” Only, he paused and ninety percent of Tony’s focus went to Steve Rogers. The one that was staring thoughtfully at a wall with more emotion than it deserved. Tony picked up his coffee mug and took a long draw from it.
She brought a finger to her face in a thoughtful gesture. “But I might as well hedge my bets. I’m here because Earth has been the God’s playground for eons. You wouldn’t believe the things Odin has hidden here. I’m going to take what I’ve come for and be on my way… And if I have to stomp on a few ants in the process, so be it.”
“Couldn’t shut up about you,” Tony said because even now there was something about that smile. He’d wager Howard had screwed him up real good because even now a smile could be everything despite the pain that surrounded it. “Do you have to keep telling people you are from Brooklyn? Everyone knows that. It’s like knowing the capital of,” Tony paused looking for a word. “Massachusetts.”
“If you have a guest bedroom to spare that would be great.” Steve was once again smiling. It was the kind of smile that filled you with warmth. Tony wasn’t sure how to handle this turn towards friendship with Steve. Hadn’t completely wrapped his brain around any of their interactions over the last few minutes.
Steve nodded, carefully considering each of Tony’s words. “I don’t know what I think about the future, but I believe in you. And if you think you can build a better future than I believe in that too.”
“What else do you got for me?” Tony muttered, tapping rapidly against his watch. His suit was waiting and raring to go.
“Sure, why don’t you let me have my glasses then? You don’t fight. I’ll punch.” Tony took in their position and began to think up counter measures against it.
Tony frowned. “I do.” But Steve already knew that their quarters were directly across from each other.
He didn’t need to hear FRIDAY’s urgent warning to know what was going to happen next. More of the green aura dripped from her fingertips into the water, causing it to go from glowing to blinding. The shields threw itself up as an almost transparent blue around his entire armor. The shields weren’t designed to take all of that energy at this close of a range. It had managed to handle the brunt of the damage, but Tony felt more than processed the pressure of the resulting explosion throw him back towards shore. Repulsor technology temporarily rendered useless as his body was flung into the nearby seaside restaurant.  He took the window and part of the wall with him. Tony tumbled headfirst into the floor and the tables. Body doing an uncontrolled somersault before slamming to a halt against the other wall.
“It was close. Closer than I thought possible given two super soldiers teaming up on me.” Steve grimaced while Tony looked on bitterly. More bitter for Steve acting like it was painful to think about. “You don’t have your boyfriend with you now. You’re on my turf, we are several stories up. I may not be the master strategist, but odds aren’t in your favor this round.” Which was probably true working under the assumption Tony could get his suit in time. Otherwise, this would be a laughable fight on his part.
Tony shook his head hard. “You didn’t,” Tony said sighing and squeezing shut his eyes tighter. Enough clarity was coming back that embarrassment over the realization of his current predicament was crawling in. He laughed dryly. “You’re right I’m just- I need some time.”
The bed pressed downward when Steve sat next to him instead of leaving Tony with a smidgen of his dignity left. “You’re looking in a bad way. I get that you need time, but come visit us at the facility. People want to see you. I think it could do you some good.”
“I can’t see you-” Die. Tony groaned and tried to figure out a better way to put it. No one could promise not to die when their business was self sacrifice. “I can’t see us fail. Together. Alone. I can’t see that again Rogers.”
No one was being intimidated by Captain America, not on Tony’s watch. Tony braved himself to turn to Steve and dispel the hostility brought on by the clothes fisting portion of the evening. “And you, bringing him all the way to the Avenger’s facility? He has a curfew,” Tony muttered. “Aunt May is going to kill us.”
“Boss, energy levels are rising quickly. I’m projecting approximately five minutes until the blast,” came across both of their intercoms.
“I don’t not like you.” Steve was studying him intently. It was unnerving given he had basically no clothing on and they’d just fucked like it was their last night on Earth. Already Tony could feel several places where soreness emanated.
That was the truth, but when Steve offered him a smile at Tony’s compliance it was difficult to remember all of that. How many smiles would it take for Tony to completely forget himself? It wasn’t the first time he’d asked that question. He didn’t have the answer.
He sighed heavily. “We’re agreed on bringing back the red and white?” Tony tried again for the third time to pin down Steve’s uncertainty. He had the projections of the uniform lined up against Steve’s body. He’d just made a couple alterations to the leg to tweak what Tony considered problem areas.
“You’re joking,” Steve said looking a mixture of embarrassed, fascinated, and little perturbed at the idea. Tony had forgotten that the serum helped boost senses such as hearing. He was forgetting a lot of things lately, such as how to control his mouth.
“Yeah and they all start with Tony Stark.” Steve used his free hand to fumble through one of his pockets.
Staying at the newly named Avengers Tower part of the time while this went on had felt like a good idea two weeks ago when he’d been given the clear.  Now, with the constant reminders of what happened back in May he was a lot less confident. Even when putting his suits to work on the reconstruction of the city he felt more of a hindrance than a help. It wasn’t enough, he wasn’t doing nearly enough.
“You don’t talk about him a lot,” Steve said and it was slightly off topic because Steve knew Tony’s avoided subjects just as well as Tony knew his. His steering it toward Tony’s avoidance of Howard was tactical, and Tony couldn’t let him get away with it too easily.
“I don’t want to fight,” Steve repeated his eyes a dark reflection of the landscape behind them. There was whiskey dripping from his hair where he hadn’t quite managed to avoid it before the bottle had been knocked away.
Tony would deal with where exactly Steve thought he was heading in a second. First, he swung his head over to his friend. “You’re being a real Richard right now Rhodey.”
Steve recoiled a bit. Tony understood that too. He’d thought he had a better handle on his emotions than he was currently displaying. Even had begun working on ways to improve Steve’s shield, prototype in the works. He’d walked himself through what had happened multiple times. Made himself see and comprehend Steve’s actions. Hoped it would allow him to look at Steve again without all of this clouding his judgement.
Tony shivered and would have responded with either a quip or an apology if Steve hadn’t prevented him from doing so. One large hand framing Tony’s face. Fingers digging into his jaw to force his mouth open. The pain was dulled once Tony complied.
“I know this selectively escapes your notice, but before I became Iron Man I was a businessman. I still am. The tower is a much more convenient location for me to meet with… People.”
Tony held out his other hand. “Don’t.” He turned his head back against the wall and slid his way down to the floor. “Don’t Captain America me. I don’t want the speech. I don’t want my spirits lifted. There are families out there grieving because of me. That would be here if I-” he was shouting. Steve may be there, but he was only a member of the audience. The shouting was all for himself.
“I like what you’ve done with the place. Seems like you’ve put in a lot of work since the attack.” Tony jerked at the mention of said attack. Didn’t really appreciate the whole small talk niceties thing happening right then. Would rather have Steve insulting him again or at least get to his point.
Tony felt mildly affronted and it was also a non answer. “Pretty sure my IQ would run circles around your IQ.”
It was then that he should have come to his senses. Demanded Steve to get the hell out of there and never touch him again. Despite the wildness in the gaze that met his, Tony knew he would listen. Would remove himself and it would be another few months before Tony saw him again.
Reopened eyes, Tony turned to look at Steve. He wasn’t quite smiling, but there was obvious relief in the tension of facial muscles. “What are you still doing here Cap? How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep if you keep chatting me up? I can’t help train the misfits if I don’t have my beauty sleep.”
“Hey Cap,” Tony said, mostly to break the silence. Steve had been studying his appearance and wasn’t doing the best at masking what he thought of it. “Bruce’s workshop is a floor down if you are looking for him.” He could also be in the smaller workshop that connected to the common area, but Tony weighed the probabilities and found it unlikely.
Steve shook his head, still making that face. “Back when drinking held a purpose I was more of a cold beer kinda guy.”
Tony rose to see Steve, taking on the two Asgardians. With them, both having longer-ranged weapons and Steve relying on hand-to-hand it was a lot of Steve jumping back in evasive maneuvers before quickly darting in to get a few licks in. Tony could help finish it for him easy, but the greater concern was the remaining civilians attacking each other. Going over the Enchantress command’s she hadn’t asked them to kill themselves but to die. Methods not specified. They were ordinary human beings of varying age ranges, all men. They weren’t going about it the most effectual way, but given enough time Tony was sure there’d be fatalities.
It was a similar version of the conversation they’d had, but Tony had been drunk then. He wasn’t now and the statement burned rather than drew him in further. “You’re such a bleeding heart Captain,” Tony drawled, knee bouncing.
It came too quickly, Tony came too quickly. Wanted to savor the moment for an eternity, but he’d made the mistake of eye contact. He saw the expression that was an equal mix of warmth, coldness, desire and anger. Felt himself come apart at the seams from it. White flashing behind his eyes as he pulsed between them. Steve was groaning Tony’s name in what could have been a chant in his ear. Movement coming faster and uneven until he stilled, throbbing inside of Tony.
Even that caused an ache somewhere deep inside of Tony. All these phantoms in his brain made him miss the real thing. It’d only been a couple months, but he missed Steve. He missed his full body laugh, surprisingly snarky personality. The annoyingly domineering streaks and the way Steve always knew he was right. Tony missed their talks about the nothing and the important. He missed everything.
Steve was slicking himself up, unzipped and pulled himself out without Tony taking notice. Had apparently thought to bring the lube along but hadn’t bothered with a condom. Tony wanted to make several very sarcastic remarks on that, but preferred it this way. With nothing between them when everything was between them.
The landing was just as smooth as their initial one. Tony was up on his feet, debating whether or not to wait until he got to his quarters to take the suit off. If Steve got a solid look at him under all of the metal casing the lecture was only bound to be longer. Tony had definitely not missed that part of being together on a team. When the doors slid open, he’d been expecting the med team to be waiting. He wasn’t wrong, but who was standing in front of them was the real surprise.
“Now I know what you look like when you’re lying, but think you’re telling the truth.” Before Steve could argue, because he would argue, “I think I told you a while back… That I would play for you. I owe you a song. Let me know what you think of this.”
“I think I could.” Steve was trying not to laugh. Tony continued to be flustered while Dum-E whirred over to clean up the mess.
Peter shouted Happy’s name as he neared the building’s entrance. Tony grimaced and his hand went from carding through his hair to tugging at the strands.
“You have serious problems Rogers,” Tony barked, because that was seriously unnecessary. Couldn’t say more when Steve had his hand wrapped around him. Already setting a pace that would have chaffed if not for the fact that Tony was leaking an embarrassing amount of precome.
“Pretty sure if I give you the glasses you are flying out of here before we get a chance to talk,” Steve said almost looking amused. Always acting like he knew Tony so well.
A silence. “I didn’t ask but he told me, already. Gleefully. Turns out you were the only one,” Tony said. He shrugged, “Not even Pepper showed me any loyalty.”
“Alright,” Tony said. “But just so you know, them having your blood: that’s not okay. It’s yours, not government property. I think it’s enough reason to go through their research if you want.”
Tony had been ready for a repeat performance in the communal living room but this time Steve had finally put his foot down and lead them to his bedroom.
Steve knew his time was up. In the end, it was the thought of sleeping the next night alone, wondering if he had passed up his chance of experiencing something good again, that made the choice for him.
The next time Steve saw Tony was at Sam's place. Sam needed some time off to go back to Washington to be with his family while his parents were in the middle of a divorce. They needed to discuss the details, all three of them, since Steve and Tony now lead the Avengers together. Tony had put a lot of work to the new team while Steve had continued with Sam and the others underground. It was natural to share the responsibility.
”What are you – ” Steve gasped, surprised with the onslaught, feeling the coldness of Tony’s hands through the thin undershirt. He grabbed Tony’s wrists to stop him.
Following the hallway with the bathrooms, they found a staircase cut off with a rope at the end of it. When Steve had made sure nobody was watching, he jumped over the rope and helped Tony do the same. Tony wasn’t so drunk that he couldn’t have made the stairs alone, but as Steve had already gotten into the habit of guiding him, he gave him an extra push with his hand to smooth the climb.
“That? That was said based on a completely wrong data set. I thought I was saving myself a heartbreak when you’d have inevitably called it quits after a few times. Not that it couldn’t still crash and burn, of course. Taking into consideration it’s us, it actually probably will. Maybe this is a mistake,” Tony said, though he didn’t seem too concerned.
Tony was brilliant and ahead of Steve in many ways, but one thing Steve knew he was better at was handling failure. He could take Tony’s ire but his guilt would be harder to handle.
Steve turned on his side, putting his back to Tony, and closed his eyes. ”You are welcome to pretend I'm a good-looking, tall blond you've worn out. You can even cuddle me if you want.”
”That's not the word I'd use,” Tony said and downed his drink in one go. He was back on track. ”Is it impenetrable?”
Too bad he didn't really have a clue what it could have been. Steve knew from experience that feeling uncomfortable usually stemmed from caring too much about what people thought of you, from the fear of being humiliated or misunderstood, of being turned down. All that was fixable with more time and effort.
”I'm not the one giving out horrible advice. And anyway, you seem to think Tony would be on board  while he's the one who has got everything to lose.”
”Uh, I can’t sit through another,” Tony said as if reading Steve’s mind, ”but, you know, the bed is pretty big. To sleep.”
Steve felt a hot thrill go through him at the implication. He flopped down on his back and closed his eyes.
Tony just made a non-committal sound. Then: “I’m sure you could have asked him out, had you wanted. I mean maybe you’re not too much into the fannish type but he let it slip he’d broken up with his boyfriend.”
Tony turned to look at him, bemusedly. “You need clear skies for these. Fog, clouds, smoke – the beam doesn’t pass those.”
Steve had gone once or twice to Sam's Marvin Gaye fan club -session so he, too, recognized the song. He, too, died a bit inside.
The friction even without the clothes wasn’t quite enough so Tony made a little bit of room between them and put his hand around Steve’s cock.
Okay. Steve wasn’t sure what he thought about where this was going, especially in the back of a car, not certain that the driver would not hear the conversation.
Having made the landing, more of the ceiling started to break down and Tony stepped back to give him room to get away from the edge. He tripped and with a grip still on Steve’s arm and Steve having a momentum going on they fell down together, Steve landing on top of him, face to face.
”I’m sorry, I just – for a moment there I had one of those out-of-body experiences, you know, looking down at myself wondering is this where my life this far was really leading me? Asking Captain America for a roll in the hay. A roll in the Egyptian cotton?”
Steve didn’t answer that but waited until Tony had gotten the door open. He stepped past Tony and onto the balcony. It was maybe 18 feet down and there was a drop-down fire escape ladder. Perfect.
”Not you!” The kid raised his arms defensively. ”I mean, they cleared you off, although maybe it's like once a cheater always a cheater kind of thing, once a criminal, always a – ”
. I'm really not into men that much, but most of the time around you I think about little else than choking on your cock.”
Bucky looked away. ”You know when you get these notions, and you believe you are right, but maybe, maybe sometimes you're wrong.”
Steve blinked but agreed quickly. It was very uncharacteristic of Tony and Steve didn’t want to wait for him to change his mind. Not that Steve thought escorting Tony was going to be too interesting for him, but the offer in itself was.
When Steve was sure Tony would hit it just right, he lifted him up in a quick motion and pushed upwards so that Tony was basically standing on his extended hands for few seconds there before Natasha got a good grip and helped him climb to the upper floor.
On the other hand, it felt unjust that this should be such an issue when everybody else could choose whoever and nobody cared: but because it was him and he’d picked a man that was noteworthy.
”Take the clothes off,” Tony commanded in a low voice Steve had never had the pleasure to hear before.
It wasn’t only the artist in him that came to life seeing the look on Tony’s face as he hit his peak, but the man in him, as well.
“Not of your clavicles,” Steve answered. “But I did have a thought or two about your nipples,” he said, half-jokingly but really not at all.
Steve got it and he didn’t usually mind it that much even when he’d rather be doing something else. Often enough, there were moments where it was just like hanging out with his friends, even if in tuxedos and evening gowns.
With a final caress, Tony stepped back. Steve closed his eyes and took a deep breath. There was no way to do this now, but maybe later, he figured. He’d take the beers, stay for an hour or so and then leave, citing his oldness.
Tony didn’t, surprisingly, decline the help, and even let Steve put a hand on the small of his back to steer him through the mass of people.
It was safe to say he wasn't looking too impressed. It was poetic justice, really, Tony thought, actually amused, that it was now Barnes whose surprisingly smutty speech got interrupted.
Steve snorted. “You're more horrible than your advice. I'm not going to do anything about Tony, except act around him like with any other friend.”
Clint didn’t seem to understand. Steve made a mental note to have that harassment training for the Avengers the SHIELD HR had been pestering him about. His earlier reluctance hadn’t been because Steve didn’t think it an important cause but because the Avengers worked better as a group of friends than as a group of colleagues with normal workplace rules. But if harassment training would have prevented Clint from interrupting his slow sink into la-la land, it was worth the try.
Steve pulled in smoothly to a parking slot and stopped the car. “Maybe,” he said. Getting out of the car he continued: “You can afford it.”
But he liked it. He didn’t want it to end. He wasn’t quite ready to make a more concrete move, though. Happy to just – to just have this, especially with Tony with whom they had had their ups and downs and difficulties but when it worked between them it really
“I just thought,” Tony said against his jaw, his shoulders and head being the only point of contact with the table, “Is this what they mean by saying ‘climbing someone like a tree’?”
and Steve would have been sure this was a practical joke if he didn't know how much decorum Sam had.
“Yeah. Asked around people’s crushes or exceptions in the team. I understand he had a bet with Thor. As if he could compete with a god,” Tony said.
Steve started to feel alert and that made him panic a bit.  He wanted this. He needed this. Goddamn Clint.
Steve shook the man’s hand and asked for his name. After a short chat, he saw Tony had his jacket back on and was waiting for him at the door. He said his goodbyes and left with Tony.
“Tony,” he warned. “I have to go back there in a minute and I’d rather not do it sporting an erection.”
Tony wasn't heavily muscled but he was well defined all the same. He had a workman's arms but at the same time smooth, perfect skin.
Just when Steve thought Tony was going to ignore him for the rest of the night, he said: ”I don't –  know.”
“Perfect,” Tony answered and Steve remembered they’d had the same conversation immediately after the sex.
Steve crossed his arms. He wasn’t going to say they’d made love because he wasn’t too keen on getting laughed at, but he knew it wasn’t just anything: they’d kissed until their mouths were tender, they’d laughed together, touching each other all over. The final stretch to chase satisfaction had been the least important part of it all.
Or the big little spoon, he thought as he felt Tony’s breath against his back. He snorted at the thought.
”Oh. Should I – I don't know, tone it down? Maybe change my voice,” the kid babbled on, the next words in a considerably deeper voice, ”stop right there, criminal!”
It was, Steve found, curious that they could so easily cultivate the low-burning interest between them into something more urgent. Maybe it was just the fact that it was spoken out, put into words, that made it into something corporeal. Maybe it only existed right here and right now where they had announced it, like a spell.
Had Tony been holding anything in his hands, he would have probably dropped it. He had hoped the born-in-the 1910s ex-US-army sergeant would have shown at least a little discomfort about homosexuality, but he wasn't at all fazed. Tony was mostly sure Barnes was fucking with him, though. He didn't think the man would have been so blithe about it had they really been lovers with Rogers at some point. Tony had tried to get under Barnes's skin, so Barnes had countered the same way.
Tony blinked. “Oh. Yeah, sure. Or you can just send them to me and I’ll brief you later,” he suggested.
”It's like if you two were... lending each other a hand every once in a while,” Sam explained, re-entering the room. ”You know, if you weren't in a romantic relationship but decided to get some relief together. And to be clear, I mean if you, just as friends, were having sex.”
He tugged it so the hem got pulled out of Steve’s pants. Steve had good enough reflexes he could have easily blocked Tony’s hands but some mix of disbelief and curiosity stopped him.
“God,” Tony gasped. Steve had the strength to keep the hold he had, but Tony saw to make it slightly easier by curling his legs around Steve.
Seeing the hint of distaste in the turn of Steve’s mouth Tony went on to elaborate: ”Or, you know, maybe you’d have asked me out and we’d have figured out how we fit together by spending time on a date.”
Tony shrugged. ”What do you think? Until around a week ago I was in a serious relationship with an amazing woman. I tried valiantly to ignore the fact that nobody turned my head around quite as well as my annoying CO.” He grimaced like he had said more than he had meant.
”Yeah, I was just thinking how I’ve been blessed with such supportive, easy-going teammates who trust my judgment,” Steve answered, and alright, maybe he wasn’t so above it all, himself.
Tony straightened an imaginary wrinkle from Steve's shirt. Steve filled his shirts far too well to leave room for wrinkles. ”I'm sure I would come. Although perhaps after watching.”
There was nothing else than to just try to suppress it, ignore it. It would go away in time. If it didn't, well, then he would just live with it. Being painfully in love with your  – whatever Steve was – wasn't the worst thing in the world. Not by a long shot. Not when he had the real love of his life next to him.
It was funny how the more contested their relationship was, the more they touched, a habit they had started during that very first 24-hours they’d met, grabbing at each other underneath the influence of Loki’s scepter.
So, Tony had had to face the fact that he could get so angry at Steve that he could have killed the guy that obviously meant the world to him. It had all been of course really muddled in the heat of the moment, and Tony wasn't sure if he would have really gone for the killing shot, but the bottom line was that for a short while at least, he had honest-to-God wanted to hurt Steve that much.
Steve nodded, haltingly. ”I’m sure nobody would, anyway. Like you said, no one would believe it. Not the tabloids who’d want it to be true for the sales alone and definitely not the public or people who know us.”
Tony had already turned around so it was made that much easier when Steve didn’t have to see his face.
got stuck in his throat. It was like all of a sudden they weren't the same people they had been mere seconds before. He shrugged. ”I suppose.”
Tony gave a surprised laugh. “Shoelaces? Is that what does it for you? I don’t know whether to feel insulted or relieved.”
Tony knew he had to stop, but he didn't exactly know how. He usually got over his obsessions only after they exploded in his face.
When Steve woke up he was alone, but he was certain somebody had been in his room before. He thought he remembered Bucky and – Tony bickering? He hoped not. After he felt around a bit and was relatively sure he had all his limbs in working order he sat up.
Feeling silly just standing there alone, Steve sat down on the side of the bed and took off his shoes and socks. His pants were the next logical step – he wasn’t going to sleep in them – but it still seemed a bit presumptuous.
”I was just telling them how great it’s to work together, a team effort, collaboration. Wouldn’t get to use my skills to the fullest if it was just me alone,” he snarked and Steve knew him well enough that his displeasure was obvious to him, but he hoped the reporters missed it.
”You know Clint can’t resist an open bar even though it’s not like he pays for that here in the Tower.”
“You know,” he started, feeling daring, “speaking of your father, you’re only the second Stark to fondle my chest.”
“It’s got pedals and a steering wheel,” Steve pointed out. He didn’t really care that much who drove, but it was amusing to him to rile Tony up.
Tony gave up and rolled his eyes. “Fine. Whatever. The specs? Meet me in the workshop in an hour, that good enough for you?”
“I’ll help you,” Tony said and proceeded to do the opposite by reaching his arms around Steve and moving some of the stuff around. Steve would have laughed if it hadn’t brought Tony flush against his back.
Tony had removed the arc reactor some months back so the skin of his chest was smooth. Steve had of course seen the reactor a lot of times since Tony used to cut his shirts to fit it. There had been one time he’d seen Tony shirtless with the arc reactor.
A thrill went through Steve at Tony's words. He kissed open-mouthedly the back of Tony's neck as a reward. He was ready to go again but getting a few hours' worth of sleep was more important, so he ended the kiss in a gentle peck instead of finding Tony's mouth.
It lasted about two seconds too long for completely casual, Tony making sure every camera got it immortalized. When Tony stepped back and let his hand drop back to his shoulder, Steve tried his best to school his expression to normal. Slight incredulity was fine and expected, so he gave Tony a pointed look which in turn amused the reporters if their chuckling was anything to go by.
Tony was an expressive guy, generally speaking, but now Steve couldn’t have interpreted his feelings any more he could have interpreted those of a stone wall.
“Just peachy,” Tony answered, still short of breath. Steve helped him up and they turned to follow Natasha, who had watched their clumsy acrobatics bemusedly.
Tony wasn’t the strongest guy but he definitely had a good pair of arms on him and it took next to no time to make the climb.
At the same time that their jailers got to the hole in the wall, Clint landed about a hundred feet from them. Natasha started running backwards with her pistols raised to give them cover fire.
A second, two, and Steve opened his mouth to taste the seam of Tony's lips. It alighted Tony who grabbed Steve and pulled him down completely on top of him. ”Yeah,” Tony breathed against Steve's mouth.
Hands around his shoulders and back, Steve pulled Tony tight against him, probably too tight, and with a final thrust, came.
“Just one answer and I’ll leave you alone. Out of all the Avengers and connected personnel, who would you want to do the most? You’re leading the poll, by the way.”
When Steve woke up the first thing he remembered was that he should throw his shirt away. The second thing he remembered was wiping him and Tony clean with it – twice. If their first time had been rushed, the second had been prolonged with Steve sliding his cock between Tony's thighs, stroking Tony in time to the slow, slow rhythm. Tony had writhed against him, eyes closed, mouth open and with an iron grip on Steve's thigh.
Steve felt like he could only breathe when the song ended. The next song Steve didn't recognize, but Tony painfully obviously did since he groaned out loud.
“Not that competent,” Steve noted. “Or they would have killed us instead of most likely trying to coerce you into designing them weapons and using me as a test subject.”
”Oh shut up,” Barnes said, but didn't seem mad, so Tony figured he hadn't crossed any lines just yet.
Tony nodded. He was standing, leaning slightly against his work table. He had the whiskey glass in his hand but it didn’t look like he was even that aware of it.
He didn't think Tony would try to hurt Bucky, but the thought of two of them alone did not sit well with him. He had to get out of the room.
It was normal enough that Steve had a short moment of doubt whether he had imagined the whole avoidance thing. He decided to tread carefully.
“I can’t outfly a laser beam, it’s light. I suppose I could reflect or intercept it? I’d have to think about that,” Tony said.
That shut Tony up for the moment. Steve regretted asking it. This wasn't really the moment for any kind of serious talk and he didn't want to just leave it at that: didn't want to seem like he had used Tony's obvious hesitancy around him as a weapon. Steve had long ago realized that when Tony wasn't needling him, he wasn't saying much else to him, either.
Steve made a displeased noise as he complied. “Sure.” The silence that followed stretched longer than Steve was comfortable with. “Do you think anything is going on with-”
Some things were easier thought than done. The tick in Steve’s jaw was readable from here. Tony had to smile at the small victory. Winning one skirmish after he lost the war seemed pointless.
How quickly fear can turn a hero into a villain. How easily power can turn a man into a monster. Tony continued to assess the distance between them. Decades lay there and it was no comfort.
When Steve touched him he was alight. Arching into it because Steve wasn’t one of hundreds. He was singular. The only one in his orbit and Tony would have to come to terms with that, later. Not now when Steve’s mouth was back on his skin licking his way down. Whispering words that Tony didn’t have the hearing to pick up. Didn’t particularly care about picking it up when a hand landed on his zipper. Felt the hardness there. Tony wanted to say he had never been harder in his life. That it was to the point of being painful. Everything with Steve felt good until it became painful.
Steve’s facial expression had started out earnest and open. It shut down immediately. People like Steve didn’t feel fear the way regular people did. Didn’t often have it reflect obviously across his face. This wasn’t that, but it wasn’t a far cry from it either.
Sitting with his legs splayed out in front of him, he leaned back against the cool glass to take in the view. Here in his first real home since his parents had died. Not that the mansion had ever been a home, but his mother a reprieve. Something familiar about Howard’s scorn that he could see a welcome mat in it. Tony had been thinking about his parents more often lately. He was trying on a paintbrush that shaded it all in lighter colors.
