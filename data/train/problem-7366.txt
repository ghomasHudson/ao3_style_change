“Okay, so do you maybe wanna explain what that was?” Tony asked, spinning around and looking at Steve with folded arms as soon as he got into the open air. “Gotta admit, I wasn’t expecting to have to break up a fight whilst on my way back from picking up my stuff from Science club.”
“Steve—”
“Steve, just let it go. Walk away. He wants to be an asshole, fine, but you’re better than that, come on,” Tony said quietly, a hand pressing Steve back a little, knowing it would do jack-all unless Steve relented.
Rumlow simply sneered. “Maybe. But I’d rather not risk it. Plus, I never really liked Rogers anyway. So if it’s all the same with you…” rather than finishing the sentence, Rumlow rushed forward and swiped his blade sideways, aiming for Steve’s midsection once more. Were he not disadvantaged by the rather excruciating pain in his side, Steve would probably have given him a fair fight. But Rumlow had a knife, and all Steve had was an inch-deep wound in his side that was currently restricting a lot of his movement. He knew that he wasn’t going to be able to compete. Not in the long run.
“Thank you,” he said honestly. “For- everything. You really stuck your neck out for me. Again.”
. He was efficient, he tended to incapacitate as opposed to kill, and when he did he made it fast and clean. Not
“Has anyone ever told you you’re not a morning person, Steve?”
Tony himself was stood at the doorway, having only just walked in from a late night at Stark Industries. He’d been aware that Thor had intended to have a ‘small gathering to celebrate the day of his birth’ that night- but when he looked around the open-plan communal floor, he had to say, it definitely didn’t look like it had been ‘small’. There had to be at least fifteen people passed out on the floor alone. Not even counting those still standing.
“Steve?” Came the confused voice from the door, and Steve jerked, turning around quickly and looking up, spotting Tony leaning against the wall with his arms folded, looking at him in confusion.
“Yeah yeah,” Tony waved a hand and hopped onto the desk, “semantics.”
He looked so… happy.
He hated Natasha.
And it was all just a fucking mess.
Some dreams felt real. But whatever it was he'd just seen in his sleep was no dream. It had been... something else. An insight into another, far more tragic reality. He just knew it, down to his very bones. Every element had panned out in vivid detail, although already the specifics were fading from him like smoke in the wind. Steve was ultimately glad of that. It was a could-be world that he’d rather stayed forgotten, lost, just as his alternate self had intended. He found his mind settling on Elliot Redford, and for the first time since laying eyes on him, Steve felt something for the man that wasn’t just pure hatred. After all— it appeared the grief had driven Steve mad, too.
Steve stilled. “Because I made a mistake.”
, the bad guy that I had to bring you in to keep people safe—but I was still just as in love with you as I had been the day I asked you to marry me. And if I had had any fucking sense, I would have never gone through with it. And I’m not—it’s not an excuse. It doesn’t change what I did. But I’m just… so, so sorry, Tony. So sorry.”
family I have left,” Tony whispered, wiping at his eyes before anything spilled from them, “I am
“Night,” Tony copied, biting back the urge to click his tongue irritably as he stepped out of the room. He shut the door with a soft snick and then made his way down to the workshop. That, at least, was free of any evidence that Peter was a part of his life. He refused to let the small, curious, serial-chewer into his expensive and highly dangerous workspace. It was just a recipe for disaster.
Steve found that a little hard to believe- but then again, how many of Tony’s friends did he actually like? Thor- and Rhodey, but he went to college, not highschool. And then…
He really wanted that.
“I wasn’t going to argue,” she told him, “I was going to say I’m coming with you.”
“Not right now,” Steve said swiftly, taking Tony’s face in his hand and looking down at him seriously, “you’re upset. Which is what I’d expect after seeing something like that. But you need to give yourself a little bit of time before you try and look at that stuff again, and I don’t want you doing it alone. Let’s just… eat dinner first, put Peter to bed, and then decide what we’re gonna do with all the files and stuff, okay?” He swallowed and blinked a few times, looking down at Peter and shucking him gently on the chin, making the boy’s face crinkle up. Steve smiled. “Look at him, Tony. He’s okay now. He’s safe. Happy. Just focus on that, sweetheart.”
When Steve woke up the next morning, however, he didn’t think about that. He got up and went normally through his routine, brushing his teeth and flatting his hair down, not feeling anything strange happening under his ribs. In fact, the whole event slipped from his mind, and he left the bathroom with a little skip in his step as he looked back to the bed where Tony was still curled up and sleeping. When Tony had days off Stark Industries work, he tended to lie in until at least ten, as opposed to Steve’s rigid body-clock forcing him up at 7 on the dot.
It was Steve.
And Steve just can’t have that.  Not when Ma’s health and financial security are at stake because Brock turned out to be a complete asshole who—
And the worst part of it was, Tony still had no idea where HYDRA had taken Steve, or even if he was still alive.
A single tear snaked its way down Tony's cheek, cross-crossed with pillow creases. "Whatever it takes," he said as he covered Steve's hand with his own. "Just… please, don't leave me. Steve, I can't—I don't know what I'd do if—"
“Thank you, Miss Potts.”  After switching off the intercom, Tony leaned back in his chair, tilting his head as he studied the schematic in front of him.  He had originally developed it as a way to manufacture control chips for an innovative line of personal computers, but it wouldn’t take much to alter it to fit his new specifications.
and now—"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nah, I'm fine," Tony said quickly, scowling when Steve raised an eyebrow. "Okay, I s'pose I might just be a bit nervous about meeting your ma."
Especially since he had driven out to that hospital so many times he likely could've done it in his sleep.
"And I'm gonna head down and start on some contingency plans," said Sam. "Nat, you and Clint gonna head out in the morning?"
"I'm—I'm scared," he said, rubbing at his nose. "And I'm so tired of being scared, but… I guess I can't seem to stop and…"
"Oh, yeah," Gwen said nonchalantly, rolling her eyes. "They're probably just fighting over who gets to use the blue controller for their PlayStation. Apparently the blue controller works better than the red one, helps Nathan Drake jump a split-second faster or something like that. Don't worry about it. As long as there's no visible blood and everyone's conscious, they're fine."
"Steve, Clint's getting the jet ready," she said, her usual slightly raspy voice even lower and raspier than usual.
Peter let out a sigh as he shifted again, trying to get comfortable. "Actually, you probably can't. The Broadway musical casts usually stick to just playing on Broadway, so…"
It still should've never happened in the first place, and—"
looks.
"Agent Bartlett, sir?"
that?"
Tony thought bitterly.
"Well, good afternoon, kids," Uncle Sam said, a goofy smile plastered on his face as Peter opened the back door of his car for Gwen. "How was school today?"
"I'm losing him!" Mantis cried as Thanos' bared his teeth, his clouded-over eyes narrowing at Gamora's twitching body.
"I love you," he whispered, tracing his fingertip down the scar marking the centre of Tony's chest, the scar he'd always associated with Tony's never-ending strength and determination. "
"No, Howard, I'm afraid I actually don't know that," Pym said. "So I guess it'll be up to the courts to decide now."
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments on the first chapter!  This story is very personal to me, and I’m thrilled that so many of you are enjoying it! 💗
Like nearly burning his skin off in a shower that was way too hot. Or trying to box against his vibranium shield.
Steve huffed, hesitating. While Wanda and Pietro had been official Avengers for a while now, they were still so young—only about three years older than Peter—that he'd been hesitant to put them on the front lines.
"Damn, but that thing is big," Sam said under his breath. "Someone must be compensating for something."
They pulled into the Tower garage only a few minutes later, with Steve carefully guiding Peter's stretcher up to the penthouse and into his heated room while Dr Cho readied her EEG machine to examine his neurological functioning. Steve clung to Tony's hand as Dr Cho conducted the test, his chest aching with every shallow breath.
"Thanks, Colonel," Anthony said as soon as Phillips stepped back. He handed his stack of papers to Carol to pass down, awkwardly pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose as his eyes flicked over to Steve. "I've prepared some final notes on the operations of the X-302, just a few more things that I thought might be of some interest. Nothing in there will affect any of your patrol this morning, but—"
The thought of sleeping, or even trying to sleep, or even thinking of trying to sleep while Peter was sick… well… it was ridiculous, is what it was.
The very same golden light that had arrived to rescue Tony and the others when they were stranded in space, at almost the exact moment when he'd lost all hope.
At least he was as broadsided by the invitation as Tony.
Steve's stomach growled then, and Tony couldn't help but burst out laughing. "Guess we should feed you before we sleep, hmm?"
“Shall I inform Mr Stane of your success, sir?” JARVIS asked.
"Um… well, Gwen and I were just talking, and—"
"Spare his life, and I will give you the stone."
“Fuck!  Tony!” he cried into the darkness as the coil snapped deep in his gut and he came, harder than he ever had in his life.  He laid there afterwards for several minutes, relishing in the final ebbs of the pleasure as it surged through his veins, igniting pathways that Steve wasn't sure would ever catch fire again.
Panic suddenly welled deep inside Steve’s gut, and he stopped, squeezing his eyes closed as he tried to focus in on his breathing.  He’d never heard of such a thing as a panic attack until just a few weeks ago when he’d been woken by a particularly bad dream, one that had him crashing the
"Um, hi," Steve said, pressing his palm to his chest. "I am Steve Rogers."
"Take that, you ugly piece of shit!" he muttered as the missile embedded itself right below the neck of the suit and exploded, shearing the suit's head clean off before the rest of it impacted against the wall.
you to try and stop me!”
"Mmm," Tony grumbled under his breath, prompting Steve to squeeze his hand. He knew where Tony was coming from, but he could also understand the rather difficult position that T'Challa was in. Sharing his country's resources with only the U.S., or even just with their team, would no doubt result in outcries from nearly every other modernised country, and that was not something Wakanda was willing to deal with.
"Ready?" he asked over his shoulder.
He had just finished the last of his tea when the door to the coffee shop opened and George Stacy and another police officer stepped inside. Steve instinctively shrank back, trying to avoid eye contact but Stacy noticed them right away, a wide smile stretching across his face as he waved hello.
"Really? Oh, that's awesome, Dad!" he exclaimed. Then he shifted on his feet, fiddling with the binding on his sketchbook. "Um… do you think that we'll ever have time to go on one of these… vacations? My friend Ned at school told me that his family's planning one for our next school break, and I just thought… well… it sounds like it'd be a lot of fun."
to be confused with the Hawks Nest, otherwise known as the very same outcropping on the opposite side of the dome.
"Huh? Oh, yeah. Ms Sharon trimmed it for me," Peter said as Steve gently ruffled his hair. "Hey, Steve!"
“Cool.  I think we’re ready, Pete.”
Tony begged. "Tell me what happened this morning! I've never seen you like this, what the hell'd the general say to you that's got you so worked up?"
"For starters," said Tony. "I mean, whoever controls the military really has the ultimate control in a country, wouldn't you think? Hasn't that always been the case in the past?"
"Oh. Well, I'm also half-god, so that probably means I'm stronger than you," said Quill.
After helping Steve brush his teeth, they both crawled under the covers, Steve's chest pressed up against Tony's back.
As soon as the ring was in place, Steve curled his fingers into his palm. The shiny, silver-coloured metal with a star and stripes design felt a bit foreign against his skin, but Steve knew it wouldn't be long before he was used to it.
"It does sound pretty cool when you put it like that," Peter said. He quirked an eyebrow in Dad's direction, asking a silent question that Dad answered with a slight shake of his head.
He just hadn't been good enough.
"Yeah?" Tony said, low and tight. "Well, then thank the gods that I'm nothing like you, because there is no way in
Peter nodded, forcing himself to take small sips to keep from choking. "Thank you," he said once he was done. "I think… I think I'd like to take a nap now."
"Oh, geez, of course," Carol said. "Just give me a sec to kick everyone else out, okay?"
"Yeah, that's fine," Peter said quickly. "I'm glad Dad's still sleeping. He needs it."
"Don't you
"Tony, you know you don't have to," Steve cut in. "I've told you that. I'm fine with finding out with everyone else."
"Pete? Something on your mind?"
Peter thought bitterly. While Colonel Phillips had released a statement during his initial press conference saying that Howard Stark had in fact been framed for treason all those years ago by some guy named Hank Pym, Peter knew that the public's opinion of him was probably not going to magically change overnight.
"I know." Steve sucked in a deep, shaky breath. "I'm gonna try and find him once I get cleaned up."
"Oh!" Steve said on a gasp, blinking as he watched Thor land in front of Thanos, his face filled with so much malice that he was almost unrecognisable.
“Eh, not too bad, JARVIS,” Peter said.  He flung his backpack onto his bed and kicked his shoes towards his closet door, setting his new book set down onto the round table in the corner and staring at it like it was an unearthed rare treasure.
And after the serum, he could.  For the first time in his life, Steve could actually stand up to the bullies he had despised ever since he was a tiny, sickly lad, and not come out of each engagement half-dead.
"Pardon me, sir," said JARVIS. "But Ms Hill reports that FBI agents have indeed arrested Spencer Smythe at his apartment. According to her FBI liaison, Smythe will be transferred to the same holding facility where Adrian Toomes is currently residing."
The thought came barrelling towards Peter like a crashing freight train, and he raised his head, barely blinking as his frozen fingers danced across the keyboard for about fifteen minutes straight, inputting the final commands that should override the stupid Ultron thingy for good, and hopefully—
By the time all the football games and chess matches were over and every single last crumb of pie had been eaten—and the refrigerator raided of leftovers no less than three times—Peter was so exhausted that Steve practically had to carry him to his room. After Tony helped him into his pyjamas and coached him through brushing his teeth, they tucked him into his bed, reminding him that he would be going Black Friday shopping with Natasha, Bucky, and Sam in the morning.
"Why don't you get your pjs on and brush your teeth now, yeah?" Tony suggested, covering his mouth as a yawn suddenly attacked out of nowhere. "'Cause I don't know about you, but Papa's still pretty wiped out, so he needs to get some sleep."
"He didn't hear anything, if that's what you're wondering," answered Tony. "He's been asleep for the last three hours, and I had JARVIS disable the audio for your chip on his stuff."
Peter thought.
"Huh?" Peter said, rolling his eyes when Gwen giggled.
Then came the hospital visits, something that Steve had begun doing as a way to satisfy his desire to think of himself as a father-type figure without any of the responsibility—and risk—of having an actual child of his own. For a long time they had been an excellent source of stress relief, revealing in the oohs and aahs of an awed child for an hour or so every few days. Steve had always imagined that he would've been the same way if his father had lived, hanging onto Papa's every word as he told story after story of the aircraft he had flown and the battles he had fought.
"I don't know, little guy," answered Papa. "And I wish so badly that I did. I wish I could just take you and Dad into my arms and hug away all of the horrible things that we've been through. But—"
"Well, one's better than none," said Sam. "And what about actually seeing where we're going?"
"Long as he doesn't get in the way."
"Well, then at least there's that," said Steve.
"My papa is the leader of the Avengers," he said evenly. "But the whole team works together. My dad designs and manufactures their equipment, Papa plans their missions, my Uncle Sam—"
"Dad, I really don't think that now's the time to be going swimming…" Peter muttered. His frozen fingers were still clutching the ship, his arm shaking as he tried to rip the mask from his face. "I can't—I can't—I need to breathe!"
"And please let us know as soon as they arrive at the Tower, JARVIS," added Steve.
After all of that, falling in love with Tony and adopting Peter had seemed almost too good to be true. A reward, perhaps, for overcoming all of his previously un-overcomable odds, one that paid dividends every single hour of every single day.
A few seconds later, the image began to shift, its pixels reorganising from the destroyed building into what appeared to be a hospital room.  Peter’s throat tightened as he saw Papa, now cleaned up and wearing a simple Army green t-shirt and camouflage pants, sleeping in a very uncomfortable-looking chair next to Uncle Bucky’s bedside, his hands gripping the chair’s arms and his brow tightly furrowed, like he was trapped inside one of his nightmares.  The room had that harsh, sterile look to it that all hospitals had, and it was quiet except for the occasional beep of the monitors.  Peter gulped as he studied the two men, letting out a sharp gasp as he noticed Uncle Bucky’s left arm sitting on top of his blankets, which was so covered in blood-soaked bandages that only the very tips of his fingers were poking out.
"Mr Stark-Rogers? Ah, excuse me, Mr Stark-Rogers? Are you still with us back there?"
"Soon as we get you fixed up, babe, okay?"
Okay, maybe ‘convinced’ wasn’t exactly the right word to describe the all-out tantrum that Peter had thrown, but whatever.  It had at least served its purpose of getting Dad to lie down for a while.
"Yeah, okay," Steve murmured as he slid his pants off and laid down on the bed. He never wore underwear while sleeping, so laying there completely naked for almost an hour while Tony's glorious hands massaged the soothing cream into his sore skin and aching muscles was almost like the sweetest form of torture that he could imagine, but once Tony was finished and they were curled up in bed together, Steve couldn't deny that he felt about a hundred kilos lighter than he'd felt after his nightmare.
Ma nodded, wiping her eyes. "He reminds me so much of Steven at this age," she said. "Such a fierce strength of mind, but trapped inside a weak body that's trying to hold him back. And now he'll finally be able to break free from it, just like Steven."
"Even so, I'm still gonna start making some contingency plans," Steve said. "I know the bill hasn't been passed yet, and judging from that committee meeting we may still have some members of the government who aren't buying into all this, but we still need to be prepared. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst."
"Okay, so let me get this straight," said Sam. "We've got this Pym guy who's running secret experiments on Stark's project, and then it goes wrong, and—"
Thank you so much for all of your wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story! 💗
There was a short pause, followed by some shuffling noises interspersed with muffled grunts of pain before Papa spoke again, clear and true even as he sounded like his heart was breaking.
Strange glanced up, still huffing like he'd just ran a marathon. "Fourteen million, six hundred and five," he answered.
"I promise, damnit! What'd he say?"
The whole team was there. Even Gamora, Nebula, and Rocket, the three remaining Guardians of the Galaxy, were there to witness the experiment.
"As a weapons' system?" JARVIS asked. "Then yes, it would."
Wanda took a step back, scrubbing the tears from her cheeks with her palms. "Well, I guess you're stronger than I was, 'cause I couldn't fight them. They gave me that drug, and it poisoned my mind so that now all they have to do is say the words, and—"
Tony's eyes gleamed as he grinned. "Oh yeah," he said as he brushed another kiss across Steve's lips. "Hold on tight, baby. We're just getting started."
"No, no, you're right," Tony said as he pulled out his phone. "JARVIS? Has Pete left the school yet?"
"Fine," Peter said into Steve's chest. "Are you gonna try and go back to sleep when you get home, though? 'Cause, no offence, but you seem like you could use it."
Steve gave a nod. "Yeah, that's what I thought. But…" He trailed off as he tilted his head, hoping against hope that he wasn't somehow imagining things.
"That's my boy." As soon as Sam took off, Tony dropped to his knees and fired up his laser, attempting to burn through the ice and cursing when it didn't seem to want to melt fast enough for his taste. He didn't have any missiles available, and while the repulsors were another option, he suspected that the force required to break through the very thick ice could possibly injure Steve, and Tony was too afraid to risk it.
"I am Steve Rogers," he whispered.
“All right, honey, did you hear that?” Dad asked.  “Pete says everything’s good, so if this is it, then let’s do this, yeah?  Let’s do this and get you free of this monster’s claws!”
"Sounds like a plan, sweetheart."
"Mmm," grumbled Ned. "It'll probably mean we won't be able to go see the Lion King when my grandma's in town though."
And even though Steve had been the one to ask Tony to sleep apart the previous night out of tradition, he had ended up sleeping so poorly without Tony in the bed next to him that he'd already decided he would never, ever do that again.
look.
"He was dying."
"And there's a huge garage for you and Dad to work in, and I even asked Colonel Phillips to set up a mini art studio for us," said Steve. "With some real canvases and paints. How does that sound?"
“Thanks.”  As he began to peruse the article, Peter’s jaw dropped open, almost unable to believe what he was reading.
"Is there no chance of one of us getting in to see Toomes?" asked Sam. "I mean, the Avengers' name still has to carry some weight with the feds, maybe it's worth a shot?"
"Exactly," said Steve. "This wouldn't be like the cave, or Stane and Killian, or even all those semi-enhanced attacks that he went through. Sweetheart, if we time this right, Peter might not even have to know what happened!"
Once again, a huge thank-you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh, and to all the amazing people in the POTS discord server.  You guys are awesome!  💖
“Hey there, old man,” Tony says once Steve’s finally done upchucking.  “You gonna make it?”
To which Tony had agreed, now that Peter had been named an official member of the Avengers. He and Steve had debated long and hard about making Peter's presence on the team official, eventually deciding that after his heroic performances in the initial skirmish in New York, on Titan, and in the Battle of Wakanda, they really could no longer deny him.
Steve dropped his gaze to his plate, poking at his eggs with his fork. "Yes, I do."
"Language,
Tony yelled, his heart lurching when Steve flinched. "It just can't, okay! I don't give a damn what Fury said, I need to get this done! Because if I don't, then—oh God, Steve, if I don't, then—"
"I hope so." Sharon huffed out a sharp breath as she bit her bottom lip, lowering her voice even further. "I'm not really allowed to talk about his family, but… let's just say that he needs a pretty expensive operation, but there's a lot of mitigating circumstances out there that are muddying the waters. It just sucks because he doesn't deserve any of it, you know? And yet he's still the one that's suffering for it."
Carol's eyebrows shot up. "The Avengers? You people call yourselves the Avengers?"
"Or just cut off his arm," said Tony. "Either would work, so long as we get our hands on the gauntlet."
"All right, Pete, don't you think you've had enough?" Tony asked, watching with wide eyes as Peter devoured his sixth peanut butter sandwich. It'd been so long since Tony had seen him eat with such gusto that he felt a bit bad telling him to slow it down, but the last thing he wanted was for Peter's stomach to suddenly revolt and send it all right back up again.
“We’ll see, bud,” Tony murmured into Peter’s hair.  He planted a quick kiss to the top of his head before releasing him, giving his curls one final ruffle.  “Am I s’posed to pick you up at that bookstore again this afternoon?”
“Well, actually, chlorine’s not—” Peter starts, then shakes his head.  “It’s mainly the humidity, Ms Mags, but I’m sure the chlorine has something to do with it too.”
Peter grinned.
"I know," Steve said, sounding so tortured that Tony nearly came right then and there. Steve's body was so sensitive, and he had such a short refractory period that whenever they made love, Tony would often start him off with a handjob or blowjob, to help him take the edge off a bit.
"Mmm," Tony grumbled. "Not really."
"All right, all right," Steve said, his shoulders dropping in resignation. He leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead. "I won't be long, okay?"
"Ice?" Steve said through clenched teeth, his hand clutching Tony's to the point of pain. "Tony—?"
And now all of the pieces were slowly starting to slide together.
"It was a tree," murmured Steve. "But—"
“Good morning, Mr Stark,” his assistant, Pepper Potts, said as soon as he stepped onto the lush carpeted hallway that led to his office.  As always, she was impeccably dressed, with her expertly applied lipstick a perfect match for the bright pink of her three-inch—or was it four-inch?—heeled shoes, and carrying her ever-present clipboard in her left hand, no doubt covered with various appointments and other whatnots that were demanding Tony’s attention that day.
"There have been no attempted firewall breaches since you implemented the new security protocols, sir," said JARVIS. "It appears you have scared them off."
As soon as he was in the hallway Steve checked his timepiece, alarmed when he saw that it was already 1745 hours. Practically sprinting down to the parking lot, he had just slid on his sunglasses and swung his leg over the seat of his motorcycle when he heard the sound of an approaching car. He hunched his shoulders, watching from the corner of his eye as the old car squealed to a stop only a few spaces away, and Anthony Stark proceeded to run into the hospital as if his very life depended on it.
"Christ, babe, you're such a sap," Dad suddenly mumbled from behind Peter. "Go to sleep before it rubs off on the kid, yeah?"
"It wasn't really that hard. But I'm right, right?"
which is about a kind of a weird scientist guy who creates a sort of creature that everyone views as a monster. But the monster's not really a monster, he's actually just kinda lonely. You know, trying to find his place in a world where everyone's scared of him. And so he asks his creator, the scientist, if he'll make him a companion, someone else like him so he doesn't have to be lonely anymore. But the scientist says no, you see, 'cause he's already afraid of his own creation, and he thinks if he makes another one that he'll lose control of them both."
"Me either," said Peter. He burrowed even further into Dad's arms, luxuriating in his warmth until he heard footsteps approaching them from behind, and he looked up to find Dr Strange glaring down at them.
"What's going on?" demanded Phillips. "I heard something about—?"
"Good," Steve said, smiling softly. "Now, after I get you a cool washcloth for your forehead and fluff up your pillows, I'm gonna go into the kitchen and make you some of my ma's chicken noodle soup and her cinnamon/honey tea. And while I'm gone, I want you to stay in this bed, all right? No getting up unless you've gotta use the bathroom or something. Okay?" He held his breath as Tony's lips twitched, his eyes scanning Steve's face as though he was looking for something specific.
“Ah huh.  Which probably means that he reports directly to Pierce then, hmm?”
Technically, he’s not supposed to need the sling anymore, and Sharon warned him about continuing to wear it since his range of motion still sucks.  But at least when he wore it before it served as a visual reminder to the people on the subway to stay away from him, which Steve appreciated since anytime anyone got even remotely close to touching his shoulder, it hurt like a son-of-a-bitch.
He’d been trying to ignore the fact that Steve Rogers was literally the living, breathing embodiment of Tony’s vision of the perfect man, limiting their conversations strictly to small talk when he picked Peter up in the evenings.  He’d even backed off on allowing Peter to invite Steve over for dinner, thinking there’d be no way that Steve would ever agree to such an invitation.
Tony scoffed, giving Steve one of his
"Do you think you can walk?"
"But that would go against the wizard's prediction, and I'm not sure we should do that," said Mantis, sounding absolutely horrified. "He made it very clear that there were only two ways we could possibly win, and—"
"Not exactly public, but yeah, it was a Damage Control server," answered Tony. "They wouldn't allow the Iron Legion to be used in guarding the cleanup convoys until they could have their so-called experts look over the design first. And I've made a lot of upgrades since then that they don't know about, but the basic design is still pretty much the same, so—"
—bond with each other over their love of drawing and all things outdoors had been one of the greatest joys of Tony's life, and he literally could not wait until all three of them could be together as a true family.
Then again, Dad was the best at dealing with an anxious Papa. It still amazed Peter that Papa could be just on the verge of one of his super-overprotective fits, but yet just a couple of touches and some soft words from Dad and he'd be almost back to normal again. It really was incredible to witness, even if it was kinda sad at the same time.
as the twin engines on Carol's aircraft suddenly flashed orange and she took off down the runway, lifting off about five seconds later. Steve's heart thudded as he watched her clear the first guard tower and go into an immediate series of tight barrel rolls.
"All right J, give me a scan of the prosthetic and magnify, yeah?"
"Yeah, he does," Steve said, frowning. "But how do you know that?"
"Yeah, well, Stevie's just exceptional that way," said Bucky. "Guess I'll see you on the flip side."
"Are you sure that you're comfortable, little guy?" Steve asked as Bruce finished attaching the various leads to Peter's head and chest that would allow him to monitor his vital signs from the anteroom. "We can get you another heating pad, or another blanket, or—"
Thankfully, after a few fits and starts, the dinner conversation flowed rather easily, led mainly by Peter.  Steve absolutely loved how with just one or two questions about one of his favourite things, Peter could literally talk for hours.  Which he did, all while being completely oblivious to Steve’s underlying nervousness.  Tony wasn’t quite as oblivious, as he had been forced to witness yet another of Steve’s bad dreams just the night before, but he at least kept his concerns to himself while they enjoyed their meal, laughing at Peter’s exaggerated stories about his classmates blowing stuff up in chemistry lab and boasting about how cool it was that he had a papa who had literally lived through the history he was currently studying.
"Yes, I'm sure that must've been difficult," Davis said, so incredibly patronising and with such false sincerity that Tony hands clenched into fists.
Steve gave a somber nod as he got to his feet. Then he leaned over, pressing a kiss to Peter's pale cheek.
"Okay," said Scott, scratching the back of his head. "Ah, why?"
Tony said as he grabbed the lube from Steve's bedside table and moved to straddle Steve's hips, their erections sliding against each other as he settled over him. Heat blazed through Steve's body as Tony took his hand, squeezing some of the lube into his palm before guiding it between them.
"You're always in the middle of a goddamn nap, Barton," Tony snapped. "And this isn't helping."
"C'mon, man," Tony muttered, checking the conference room clock yet again. Pepper had offered to attend the meeting as well, but Tony had declined. She was already busy enough overseeing the opening of the new Stark Industries building in India, as well as coordinating a second run of their newest StarkPhone since the first had completely sold out in only a couple of weeks.
"At your service, Captain Rogers. How can I be of assistance?"
The tesseract.
But while a bit of salt could improve the taste of something, too much would effectively ruin it. So as much as Steve had been tempted, he knew that he couldn't abandon his team now. Not when literally the entire universe was depending on them.
"What?" Peter exclaimed. "No! They never said anything to me about it!"
“Oh, yeah, I’m sure you could, Mr Stark, but I’m afraid that I already have plans,” Steve said, ignoring Peter’s exaggerated groan.  “You see, I’m going to be spending the weekend upstate with my husband and son, so—”
"With the idea to use the system as an energy source, yeah," Tony said proudly. "Howard, he was running experiments on this device back in the day so I know it exists, and I've studied as much about it as I can possibly study so I know that Pete's right. This would end the war."
"Papa," he heard again, his heart leaping into his throat. "Please, help me! I'm so tired!"
Gamora rolled her eyes, shooting Tony an apologetic glance. "Sorry. He's not used to not being in charge."
“Yeah?  Why wouldn’t I be?” Steve asked, apparently just a bit too quickly when Tony frowned.
Dad lifted his head, attempting a smile. "Sure, bud. No problem."
Unable to speak, Tony simply nodded.  He had no earthly idea how Steve could know everything was going to be okay, but he did at least appreciate the sentiment.
"George, is this really necessary for dinnertime conversation?" Mrs Stacy cut in. "We're here to get to know Peter, not to pester him questions about his parents that he probably doesn't even know the answers to."
"Oh, come
"Shh, mo grá, you know that's not true." He finally hefted Tony off the bed, practically carrying him to the back of the room where he gathered him into his arms. "This wasn't your fault, Tony, none of it was your fault. It was all HYDRA."
“It’s okay, honey,” Tony murmured as he kissed the frown line between Steve’s eyebrows, a line he had so lovingly decreed as his ‘worry wrinkle’.  “I’m right here.  I’ve got you.  You can tell me anything.”
"That's because Uncle Bucky volunteered for it, Pete," Tony cut in. "There's no way I'd force it on him, you know that. And he can still change his mind if he wants to, but for right now he's volunteered. And he's an adult, so he's allowed to do that."
about when we'll talk about it? That's just code for 'we'll see', which is just another way of saying 'no', isn't it?"
"Which would mean no more vibranium bomb casings," said Tony. "But that's still not gonna be the limiting factor, Pete. The biggest hurdle here is—"
But he was cut off by Bucky who had Peter in his arms, still whispering into his ear, his words a mix of English and Russian.
Wrapping his arms around his front, Steve slammed the back of his head into the wall, trying to knock himself out. But like a cruel joke, all he managed to do was magnify the pounding in his head to an even more unbearable level.
Peter dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "I didn't really want to talk about it, Ned. Dad and Papa were already so stressed out, and… I don't know, I just didn't feel like being constantly reminded, ya know?" He didn't add that he'd been so continuously exhausted lately that even the thought of the whole registration act thing was enough to almost make him cry, not to mention the stress of his upcoming experiment with the MAUDE glasses. He was far too old to be bursting into tears at school, of all places.
The gut-wrenching horror he'd felt as he watched the six glowing stones lock into place on Tony's gauntlet. The excruciating pain when he took Tony's hand, knowing that for Tony it was a billion times worse.
“All right, here’s hoping I understood that little exchange,” Tony said as he pulled out his phone.  “JARVIS?”
“It’s no problem at all,” says Mr Rogers.  “And please, call me, Steve.”
"No, no, no!" Steve yelped. "JARVIS, cancel that! Tell Sam it was a mistake, that—!"
"Okay, then what's that?" asked Bucky.
Peter thought as the sound of gently falling rain filled his bedroom.
“I do?” Steve asked, squinting as he studied the board.  “Oh, yeah!  I guess I do!”
"Okay, but then you'd better put a lid on it for a while," said Tony. "'Cause if you're still trying to convince me that you're not perfect, well… I hate to tell you this,
“I’m already done with my homework, so please?  If you're that paranoid, you can just tell the security guys to follow me!”
Tony sighed as he studied his boyfriend, his beautiful blue eyes glassy and the fading sunlight bouncing off the lighter blond strands in his hair. He was just so unbelievably beautiful that Tony still didn't quite understand what he saw in him, someone who not only was almost the exact opposite in looks, but also a civilian. With the forbidden last name of Stark.
"Oh, and now you need your girl to stand up for you, little prince?" sneered Flash. "Didn't your papa teach you how to stand up for yourself?"
A knot rose in Steve's throat at the mention of Bucky. He and Tony had just visited him at the hospital the previous night, and while he was thankfully in a bit less pain than he'd been the day before, Sam had told them that the shock of losing his arm still hadn't fully sunk in.
Instead, he just smiled. “You made me happier,” he said simply, before drifting out of the room, feeling Tony’s eyes on his back as he left.
“Ignore it,” Steve mumbled into his chest, nuzzling in close, “jus’ go back to sleep.”
And that left the one thing that AIM had truly set all this up for. It left Peter, unguarded, in the one place where not a single Avenger could get to. It was a pretty well organized plan, if he was being honest. Not one Tony had ever seen coming.
When Steve sat down with his friends again on Friday morning, he watched them all slowly stop talking in order to stare at him in surprise.
“Tony!” He called out to the figure as he wandered down the corridors and tapped a knuckle against each locker. “Tony, wait up!”
walking the fuck out of here.”
No, no. It would be fine. Steve was a fighter. And Tony was almost certain he was still alive. If they’d killed him, they wouldn’t have bothered to take his suit from him first, and so the flatline would have shown up on Tony’s update. And it hadn’t, ergo, Steve must still be alive. Anything else—it was secondary. The point was, Steve wasn’t dead. Tony just had to focus on that.
finding my spanner, which, y’know, would’ve secured that little bolt in place just there,” he pointed into the side of the machine and Steve leaned in, trying to look at what Tony was seeing. Unfortunately, to him, it all just looked like wires and buttons- but he did see the loose little bolt from where Tony’s spare finger was pointing, and he nodded his understanding. “But yeah- I dug around and did all the hard stuff, but when it came to just securing it in place, I looked around and-“ he thrust a hand out to the desk, and Steve huffed in amusement when he spotted the little spanner just balancing on the edge of it. Out of reach.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve shrugged, “he’s gotten the cops in on it, I think. They’re gonna press charges according to Principal Fury. But I’ll deal with it as it comes. It’ll be okay.”
“You kissed him?” Nat asked, raising her eyebrows, “wouldn’t have called that one.”
Wordlessly, Steve shucked off his coat and stepped through the door, Bucky following on behind him. The door shut and then he felt Bucky’s arm wind around his own, linking them together like they’d used to do when they were kids and both the same height. Now Bucky had to bend in order to get the angle right.
Just like Steve and Tony, Bucky tended to blame himself, even when there was absolutely no reason to do so.
So he simply tightened his arms around his husband, whispering another, "I love you," into Tony's ear and closing his eyes as Tony threw his leg across Steve's lap and tucked his head under his chin.
Except, he
A chuckle bubbles its way up from Steve’s chest.  Leave it to Natasha to be the pragmatic one.
that you don't get a say in this," Tony snapped as he tore himself away, rubbing at the back of his neck. "I'm sorry, honey, I know that sounds, well…
Peter sighed.  Leave it to his father to twist everything around to make himself look like the bad guy.
his brown eyes stated.
After filling a paper bag with two of just about everything, Steve made his way in the direction of the X-302 hangar, where Tony's office was only about a hundred or so paces away. His heart started to thud as he rounded the corner and saw the strip of light under Tony's door, wondering if Tony had been able to break away from work and see Peter that afternoon. Steve had asked Colonel Phillips to try and ensure that Tony was able to leave on time to visit Peter at least a couple times per week, and Steve had already noticed a change in both Tony and Peter because of it. Peter especially looked better than he had in days when Steve had visited him the day before, and he'd noticed that Tony seemed to be a bit less stressed as well.
Papa thought for a moment, his fingers tracing patterns on the back of Dad’s neck.  “No, it’s more than that, little guy,” he finally said, shaking his head.  “I’m not only relieved.
"It was shortly thereafter, sir, about two weeks later."
"Goddamnit, Steve—"
“Hello?” he tries again, the word tearing through his frigid throat like a jagged blade.  “Help!  We—we’re down here!”
“Aww, don't mention it!”  Peter held up the bookmark.  “I have this quote on a t-shirt too, it’s one of my favourites.”
"That's exactly what I was planning to do, Tony," said Howard, rather proudly. "And I've also adjusted the dose of the serum a bit as well. It should just be enough to heal his heart and lungs and any possible brain damage from his hypoxic events. We're not looking to make another super-soldier here."
"Yeah, sure you are," Tony said as he next unwrapped his left hand, which was considerably more beat-up than his right. Steve had been taught to write with his right hand, as back in the early twenties the nuns at the elementary school still believed it was the sign of the devil if a child wrote with his left hand, and while the serum had made him almost ambidextrous he still sometimes favoured his left hand when punching, and his knuckles often paid the price for it.
“It wouldn’t be on the shelf for sale if I wasn't okay with it,” Steve said, smiling softly.  “And while it is a fair price, at least in my opinion, it is still pretty expensive, so… don't you need to ask your parents first?”
"No, you were doing what you thought was best for your son," Steve said firmly. He slid his hand underneath Tony's chin, tipping his head up to meet his eyes. "No parent should ever feel guilty for that, sweetheart. And especially not such an excellent father as yourself."
And as Tony carefully pulled it out of the box and prepared to slide it onto his finger, he noticed that there was something else etched on the inside of the band, something that he had to squint to fully make out.
"I do. With my life," Tony said without hesitation. "No, with my
“No!” Steve screamed as his entire field of vision narrowed to only those three books, and the explosion he knew was imminent.  Because that sound, that hateful, terrible sound of a single sniper shot, was always followed by an explosion, which meant that Steve had only seconds to protect the two people he loved most in the world from being crushed.
"No, not if you mean what I think you mean," Peter argued. "HYDRA could've ended up destroying Earth too, Papa, if we hadn't stopped them, and I'm sure Uncle Thor would've been able to handle his psychopath sister a lot better if he'd known that she existed before it was too late, so I don't think that it does any good to compare them. They were both evil, and they both caused a lot of people to lose their lives, but now they're both gone."
"That charge was just the excuse you people used to get me," Steve said, his injured ribs protesting his vehemence. "Now, what the hell do you want?"
He had even sucked it up and asked Bucky for some advice a few days ago. Thankfully, Bucky had picked up on Steve's nervousness and kept his needling to a minimum, answering Steve's questions with a mostly-straight face and even offering to pick him up some necessary supplies. Steve had thanked him but declined the offer, because really, if he wasn't ready to buy lube and condoms by himself then he probably wasn't ready to have sex. But then, just the previous morning he'd returned from his run to find a small paper sack sitting on the floor outside the door to his room. Apparently Bucky was getting just as impatient for Steve to finally have sex as Steve was.
Tony rolled his eyes, yanking his glasses from his face and tossing them onto the desk.
"The Iron Legion, Mr Stark. Forgive me, but it just seems odd that someone who had shut down the weapons manufacturing aspect of his company would be able to produce what amounted to at least two dozen of these flying armoured suits."
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"Thanks." Draping his jacket across the back, Steve settled his large frame down onto the uncomfortable chair, crossing his legs. "I fly patrols that monitor along the DMZ border every day. I was up in the air by 0630."
separate paternity tests at Howard’s insistence, Peter Edwin Stark was entitled to a share of Stark Industries equal to that of Tony’s, and that was something that Obadiah was apparently not prepared to allow.
He was going to figure out exactly what his family was up against, and then he was going to help them stop it.
And then, as if on cue, they both turned to Colonel Phillips.
Silently, he and Tony headed across the main lab to the opposite side, where Sam, Clint, and Natasha were standing by the double doors.
"Well, I'm pretty sure that we just made Pete's month," Tony said once they arrived at the motorcycle. "Did you see the look on his face when we walked in together?"
"At least the Avengers were close and got there fast," added Ned. "Before too many people could get hurt."
"Mmm." Tony watched as Phillips shot a furtive glance at the door before stepping closer. "Look, I know what happened, and I just wanna say that—"
"Steve, I'm counting seven hostiles out in the open here," Sam said from somewhere above him, his dual guns blazing as yet another grenade exploded about twenty metres to Steve's right. A second later Bucky emerged from the trailer and dropped to the ground, aiming his rifle at a two story building across the street.
"Well… yeah," Peter said. He rubbed at his temples, wishing he had a spare pair of glasses. "She said her mom and dad wanted to meet me, so… why? Is that weird or something?"
Tony internally groaned.  It was too late now.
"But I'm not, honey," Tony said. He lifted his head, gazing at the man that he loved more than he ever thought he was capable. "And neither is Pete, and so… you've just got to know what you're getting into here."
"Longing," Sam said, clear and even. Steve flinched as Peter's limbs immediately went rigid, fear evident in his huge brown eyes.
"Ladies and gentlemen," Phillips began. "So as not to venture too much into what you might call hyperbole, I am
Which meant Steve wouldn't have either.
"Peter!" Steve shrieked as Image Peter's hands slipped slightly on the railing. He jerked back as he saw himself enter the image, looking up at Image Peter dangling from the railing as he raced up a broken metal ladder.
"Yeah, Steve, what's wrong with you?" Bucky said, thick with sarcasm. "Everyone knows that."
It was a testament to how worn out Peter really was when he didn't even try to argue as Tony started to help him get undressed.  Getting him into his pyjamas wasn’t too bad, as Tony had done that plenty of times before, but since his brief nap had essentially glued his contact lenses to his eyeballs that part ended up being a bit interesting.  But once Tony managed to get them out and helped Peter brush his teeth, he tucked him into his bed, brushing the curls off his forehead just like he always did.
“Just… shitty night. I’m tired. Had a few nightmares. It’s nothing.”
It hurt, it hurt, oh god.
“I need- I should probably shower,” Steve mumbled, breaking away to rub a thumb across the streak of colour that was now lining Tony’s cheek as well as his own.
Tony’s face fell, and he leaned back. “How much damage did you do?” He asked Steve quietly, and Steve shrugged again, looking away.
Tony blinked, looking behind him and then turning to the rest of the room, where the remaining conscious friends were all sat. “Has he seriously just fallen unconscious on my ass?” He asked with a wave.
The rest of dinner was spent talking about other subjects- mostly all the gossip Darcy had accumulated over the week, because apparently people cared about that sort of thing and she knew literally everything. Literally. Everything.
Looking down at her grave- marking the spot in which one of the three people who’d ever truly loved him was laying six feet under- he really wished he could believe her.
"I know. Tony, I
Gwen begged, her beautiful green eyes filling with tears. "Please, don't do this!"
“So, Peter, I have something very important that I need to ask you,” Steve said once they had all received their dessert orders.  He swallowed hard, trying to get his thudding heart under control as Peter looked up at him with his huge, innocent eyes that were so much like his father’s, waiting patiently.
"You might want to make sure that Gwen can go before you get too excited, little guy," said Steve.
"Did—did you build that yourself?" he asked, indicating the air canister. "Петр told me that you build most of your own equipment."
"I'm sorry I woke you."
"If it's all right with your dads, Петр," answered Bucky. "I know you're all pretty busy."
Silently, Steve poked his head around Peter's slightly open door, letting out a small sigh of relief when he saw that yes, Peter did appear to be sleeping peacefully, hugging his polar bear as usual with his favourite white noise rain sounds playing in the background. He tiptoed inside the room, reaching down to brush Peter's curls off his forehand, his heart leaping when Peter instinctively leaned into his touch. The boy had grown at least eight centimetres over the summer and his jawline had sharpened up a bit, but he still had the same round cheeks and full lips that he'd always had, so he wasn't done growing quite yet.
"I know." Steve let out a heavy sigh as the doors opened into their living room, turning to Tony as soon as they stepped out. "And as much as I wish that we could tell him no, I just—"
Well,
"You wrote those just in the last few hours?" Papa asked, stifling a yawn. He really did look horrible, all tired and beat up, but Peter wasn't about to tell him that.
"Mmm, sure," Ned said, unconvinced. "I s'pose you can think that if it makes you feel better, but I still say that you haven't been the same since."
"Aahh, I need—I wanted to ask you something," she said, yanking so hard on her ponytail that Peter winced. "Um… my mom told me that I should invite you over for dinner sometime, she wants—she and my dad both wanna meet you, so… would you wanna come… sometime?"
"You're incorrigible," Steve rasped as he claimed Tony's mouth, sweeping his tongue between his lips. "But if you hold that thought for when I get back, I might just take you up on it. Okay?"
"Copy that," agreed Tony. "You call Sam yet?"
With himself, however- it’s harder to care so much.
Tony tilted his chin defiantly. “I am not smitten with him.”
“Natasha will blow her top if she sees you eating that- it’s her turn to cook tonight. And if she chooses to murder you for eating beforehand, then there isn’t much I can do. I know you’re my son, but the whole parent-bond thing only goes so far-”
“Tony knows what happened with you,” she explained quietly, “he knows it wasn’t your fault.”
“Stop talking,” Steve shoved her away hastily whilst they all just laughed, “you are the worst people ever, oh my God, don’t put that thought in my head-“
Stepping out onto the common floor five minutes later, he wasn't entirely sure what he'd been expecting. Mayhem, perhaps. That was closer to what he'd been envisioning, if he was being honest. However, the scene that he took in seemed remarkably serene and somewhat disturbing. Mainly because Tony could see the Black Widow in her full uniform, sat on her belly and looking up at their giant HD TV screen as it played an episode of what appeared to be Peppa Pig.
“Steve,” Tony looked at him as if he’d just grown another head, “Steve, what the fuck, you’re not doing anything
“God, I’m getting hives just listening to him,” Clint told Natasha, who gave him a swift smack across the back of the head and then gestured for Steve to continue.
They may have had a point.
“Don’t,” Steve gritted sharply, finally looking down and glaring at the lake below them. He heard the metal groan under his grip. “Don’t say that, Natasha, not now.”
The door clicked open, and Steve practically fell inside, his feet sliding clumsily over the marble porch. He sprinted down the length of the room, heading for the stairs and then bounding up them two at a time. Goddamn Thor’s apartment—had to be on the top floor, didn’t it? He didn’t slow down though; instead just pushing through the tightening in his chest and keeping up the pace until he arrived. He didn’t need to bother pounding on the door, because Thor had already left it open, so Steve jogged inside, looking around the spacious apartment.
He stepped further in, turning on thermal vision in his HUD in order to pinpoint the location of the survivor. It wasn’t hard; tucked away in a corner, curled into fetal position, was a hot ball of orange-coloured life. Tony looked at the curve of his shoulders, the tufts on his hair, the outline of his trousers.
“Said that Bucky—my best friend from back in the war, the one who I lost… he said that he’s alive.”
"A note," he responded, and Natasha's eyes encouraged him to explain further, "said: 'I can't keep him, he's one of you'. "
Steve wasn’t sure what to do with that information. It was weird, to think of himself having that much of an impact on people, really. In his own eyes, he just wasn’t… important enough for that. He wasn’t a big character, he wasn’t hilarious or rich or even particularly interesting- all he was was stubborn and loyal and opinionated to the point where it tended to get him into more arguments than most people were comfortable with.
But what choice did they have, really? Like Natasha had said, they couldn’t fucking keep him. That was just absurd.
That was proven on the thirtieth video. This one wasn’t taken in a lab. This one was taken in a bathroom, the camera perched awkwardly on the sink as she herself sat on the edge of the bathtub. She looked ill. Her eyes seemed haunted.
in response to this. So Steve was going to follow him and see where that led.
“Oh, Steve,” Ty walked even closer, bringing them nearly to touching distance as he loomed over, a face like thunder, “you really think that I’m just going to let you win? You don’t get to take what’s mine away from me-“
He asked again about what had happened after he’d passed out in the cabin, and this time, Rhodey began to retell the story with his usual flare, because no matter what he said, the man was dramatic as hell. The way he described it made it sound as if certain death had been inevitable, and from the way Steve tensed up a little next to him, perhaps that hadn’t been too far from the truth.
“Yeah, well, you’ve had experience.”
to him- they never left that drawer; not in the ten years Tony had known him, why the hell was he putting them around
Ah, well. Tony could live with that.
Luckily Steve had seen him go, and managed to scream at Sam to get to him before he fell, which he did, but that wasn’t the fucking point. He’d nearly died, and yet all Tony thought Steve gave a shit about was the part where Tony hadn’t listened.
Tony grinned as he stood, cracking the vertebrae in his spine as he started to walk over to the stairwell. “Honestly, who’s teaching you to be so rude these days? I bet it’s Nat. She’s good at finding unique ways to irritate me.”
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but ultimately decided to just let it be. If Thor wanted glue his furniture to the floor, who was Steve to judge? Instead, he simply shook his head, smiled, and then slouched into Tony’s side, making himself comfortable there.
There was a beat of silence. “Mr. Rogers, this is not anything you will have dealt with before. Sir has been preparing for an attack like this for a while. You have not.”
“It’s not just about me and you. If you stay, you’re not going to be living the easy life, exactly. I’m Iron Man. I have to get to the bottom of whatever it is HYDRA is planning.”
There was a murmuring of agreement around the room as everyone acknowledged the sound nature of the idea. Tony himself still didn’t entirely like the idea, although he wasn’t too sure why. Maybe just something about displacing the kid over and over sat wrong with him. Like Clint had said on the first day, babies needed stability, love. They needed stupid cuddles and someone to hold them, because they were at an age were affection was a necessity, not an option. Throwing him from place to place in an attempt to find a fit just felt wrong.
But how well did he know the organisation he worked for? Enough to trust them with Tony’s life? Enough to take their word over the word of the man he’d lived with and loved for years?
Steve shrugged, giving Natasha a glare and shove when she became unable to hold back a snort of laughter. “Okay, listen, this has
on their goddamn anniversary and leave Tony with nothing more than a note to apologise for it.
“For the next time your self preservation instincts fail you and you require some assistance,” Tony grinned, scrawling out his number across Steve’s arm- then he winked and added “although, if you’re coming to me, I’m guessing they’ve deserted you completely anyway.”
They let him out after three days of observation, once they were sure that Steve was back to normal. He left with Natasha, and she guided him quietly to a coffee shop, where she sat him down in the corner of the room and then bought two coffees for them. He remained very still, hands tucked under his legs. The coffee was left untouched.
Steve nodded in agreement and snuggled down further. "If all goes to plan, there won't have to be a tomorrow," he said, before kissing Tony's forehead and running his hands up and down Tony's arms, "let's try get some sleep before he wakes up again."
“Yeah, your lot weren’t so bright, were they?” tony replied, jostling his shoulder and then curling a hand around the lighter as he lit up with the ease of an expert.
“I know.” Steve glanced sideways, absently tucking a damp strand of Peter’s hair back behind his ear. “Let’s put him to bed, shall we?”
"Phone got taken by Miss Hill," he said mutinously, "turns out I know shockingly little about the history of medicine, and now I'm sat eating rabbit food because I didn't bring enough money for an actual lunch. School sucks."
There was the sound of a door opening outside of the pillow fort, and Steve sat up suddenly, but Tony just shook his head. “Loki,” he murmured, shooting Thor a look. “Bet he’s gonna find this very-“
that the SUV had blown. That Tony’s whole life had crumbled around him and then been rebuilt from the ashes. This day three years ago had changed Tony’s life forever.
He was just fine staying in bed, thank you.
He wasn’t sure why exactly he needed it so badly—maybe he just wanted to know whether the guilt that was eating him up was valid or not. Tony said it wasn’t his fault. But he wanted to know what Howard had said; a morbid curiosity that he couldn’t control. Had the man mentioned him? When he’d been beating his own son senseless, was it Steve’s name he was spitting?
“Tony, what the fuck are you doing?” Steve said loudly, jerking forward and instinctively grabbing his wrist, “Tony, fucking hell, get down, you’ll fall-“
The compound was silent. FRIDAY said good morning. Tony didn’t answer. She didn’t try anything else.
Things were hard, after that.
That was the crux of it. That was why people got violent with him. They couldn’t handle him, because he was loud and abrasive and rude and just took everyone’s love without ever giving jack shit back. No wonder so many relationships he’d been in had gotten violent.
He could still feel his heart beating in his ears, and his body felt like it was alive with electricity. He wondered how long that feeling would last. Probably a very long time- the thought of ever… of ever getting used to something like that was just absurd, really.
The little girl nodded solemnly, and as the bell rang for their recess, Tony found himself mulling over his own words. Down the hall, he knew Steve would be just finishing from his own lesson, and unlike Tony, Steve was going to be sticking around for a little longer in order to give the whole school a talk. He’d offered it, happy to help out. Happy to inspire the young minds.
“Yeah. Trippy.”
They ate their breakfast quietly after that; Tony continuing to tear off small chunks until he’d finished off the slice. He didn’t eat the other one, saying that he wasn’t very hungry. His mind was somewhere far away, eyes blank as he stared at the wall. Every now and then he asked JARVIS a question about flux density or slingshot velocity—it didn’t make any sense to Steve, but he figured Tony was just working in order to keep his mind occupied. He did that sometimes. When the world got too much for him.
He felt strong hands curl around his biceps, the fingers splaying over his back. He looked up as Steve knocked their foreheads together. “Breathe,” the man whispered softly, “breathe, relax, just think. We’re going to get to him. It’s going to be okay. Just breathe.”
Tony looked away, shaking his head. “I tried. I didn’t… there were just so many other things going on in my head and I wanted to go back and find you, and I was- I was on edge from what had just happened, and I couldn’t focus and so I had to make Howard step back in and take it while I left.” Tony laughed humourlessly. “He’s gonna fucking kill me for that later.”
It made sense.
“What?” Tony asked blankly.
Tony was one of the first to get in, trailing close behind Steve as the man rammed his way into the Penthouse floor. Every last one of them had been frantic on the journey, dealing with the panic in their own separate ways, but now, it was all over. Tony saw it all instantly; the trail of destruction mapped out right in front of him, starting at the window they’d blasted through, marching into the living room where tables and couches had been upturned, boot-marks had been imprinted, and finishing at the opposite end of the floor, where Happy’s body lay.
He paused in his steps for a moment, stumbling over his feet as he caught sight of a group of kids- few years older than him, college, maybe- hanging by a parking lot in front of him. He knew instantly that they weren’t any good. Years of practice had given him a pretty decent indicator of threats like that.
“No, Tony, stop,” Steve said broken-heartedly, taking Tony’s hand and pulling it up to his mouth to kiss his knuckles gently, shaking his head as the tears slipped freely. “This was never,
As more alcohol was consumed, everyone gradually began getting louder, and most of them ended up on the floor watching Die Hard 2 with an intensity that only drunk people could really achieve. Tony and Steve both joined them all; Steve lying on his stomach with his elbows braced against the floor and Tony doing the same thing over to his left. Whenever Steve shot little glances over to him, Tony was smiling. It was really nice to see. Made Steve kinda want to kiss him. A lot.
Steve just laughed woodenly and nodded his head a little. “Could say that, yeah,” he looked down, watching Tony as he played a gentle rhythm on Steve’s pulse.
Steve flicked his eyes sideways again, pursing his lips. “Is it going to get us killed?” He asked.
And maybe Steve would be okay with that. Maybe steve would be happy with whatever Tony could give him.
“Exactly,” Thor said beside him, wrapping his arm delicately around Tony’s shoulder, “and we’re not leaving. Not for anything, okay? It’s always been me and you, hasn’t it— getting through highschool, one shitty day at a time? You’re not alone; I goddamn won’t let you be. I need someone to braid my hair for me at morning break, and I sure as hell am not asking Sunset to do it.”
Steve took a step forward automatically, and then the last addition brought him to a stop again as reality crashed back down around him. God, what was he… what was he doing?
to be you so that he can murder me, yes.”
“But I want to,” Tony had whined, and he’d looked so frustrated as he’d bowed his head and then sighed, “I want to, Steve,
cute,” Steve admitted with a toothy grin, looking unbearably happy as he curled his hands around the back of Tony’s knees. “Also very hot and sexy though, don’t worry.”
?” He gasped incredulously. “No way, Tony. You’re crazy, I’ll fall-“
He was so busy, but, as he’d pointed out to Steve many times, he was also so much happier at work now that he hardly noticed it.
"Then I've gotta stay ahead of it," Peter said. He pushed himself up to a sitting position and cracked his knuckles, taking a quick peek at the door to make sure no one was coming. Uncle Sam had gone up to the base with Uncle James to help Dad, and Uncle Bucky was sitting out in the living room with Grandma, trying to offer her support. Ms Sharon would be stopping by to check on him soon, once her shift at the hospital was over, but at the moment, Peter was unsupervised.
“Yeah,” Steve said, giving a single nod.  “Much.”
"No, maybe not," Steve said after a short pause. "But Tony, didn't you tell me that Dr Strange mentioned something about fourteen million possible outcomes of the battle with Thanos?"
"Okay," Peter finally said about fifteen minutes later, brushing bits of dust out of his curls. "I think I'm done."
"If you say so, bud," said Dad. He jerked his head towards Peter's notebook. "You've got some more code for me to go through?"
All of Peter's emotions that were bubbling just beneath the surface finally boiled over, and he cupped Gwen's cheek in his hand, hesitating only long enough for her to nod before pressing his lips to hers in a kiss. It was absolutely
"I don't think I could handle him being under like that again, Steve," he admitted. "I don't—I just can't—"
"Thank you," Steve said as he carefully took Tony's left hand, absentmindedly fiddling with the wedding ring on his third finger.
“Yes, I am,” Steve said softly as he held out his arm to Tony, warmth spreading across his chest when Tony took it.
"It's—it looks—"
novel that had ever been published, even dating back to before the prequel trilogy was released.
“Uh huh.  Thank you,” Peter said happily.  He leaned against his father as the elevator started its ascent, closing his eyes when Dad wrapped his arm around his shoulders.  For Dad to actually block Obie’s calls for an entire weekend was a huge deal, and Peter was very grateful for it.  Obie spent more than enough time bullying Dad during all hours of the week, he didn't need to do it on the weekends too.”
Steve huffed. He really wasn't in the mood to deal with this at the moment. "I thought you guys were able to bypass the battery?"
Clint raised his eyebrows. "Yeah, yeah, all right. And we'll all obviously keep our eyes peeled, so—"
Within reason, of course. But Steve could not recall a single time where he and Tony hadn't dropped everything the very second that Peter needed them.
"But,
"JARVIS," Scott slowly repeated. "Ah, okay."
“Hey, hon?  You feel like taking a bath?” Tony asked as he watched Steve carefully hang up his uniform.  “We’ve still got almost two hours before we can pick up Pete, so—”
But, just like he hadn't been fast enough the one other time this had happened, he wasn't this time either.  His heart skipped at least three beats as he watched the books land in succession, the sound of their impacts way too unbearably close to the sound that haunted his nightmares.
He had a flight to catch.
“Oh, nah, it should be fine,” Tony says.  “Happy and Pepper said they can always drop Pete off if I get into a jam at work or something, so I don't think it’ll be a problem.”
"I'm not gonna leave you alone, honey," Tony said firmly. "Not for one single second, okay? Don't you even think about it."
And, despite his insulated boots and gloves, he could no longer feel his fingers and toes.
Steve stood in the empty hallway for a long time after that, before nodding his head and turning on his heel. The weight inside his chest dragged him down like an iron weight with every step forward.
Tony hummed. So that was adhesive abilities and now superstrength too. He wondered what else the kid was hiding up his sleeve. “Why was he hitting you in the first place? Thought Thor might have calmed him down by now.”
“I’ve had worse.”
He remembered Fury’s earlier words.
“Hey,” Steve murmured quietly, and Tony jumped when he realised that his partner had come back into the room once more and was sliding onto the bed, arm wrapping around Tony’s waist and pulling him in. He was still a little damp, and he smelled like fresh apples from his body wash. Tony leaned into it happily. “You think he’s ready to settle now?”
He grinned into the pillows, knowing his cheeks had probably gone a little pink from the thought alone. And dammit, now he just wanted to see Tony all over again- barely awake for more than ten minutes, but his mind had already gone straight back to that boy. He seriously needed to get a grip on himself.
Steve pulled a face. “He’s with his dad,” he muttered, sharing a small look with Thor before turning back to the others, “don’t think he’s gonna be able to get out any time soon.”
“For about half an hour, yeah,” Steve grinned, leaning onto the mattress and then looking up at Tony, who was just watching him with a mixture of incredulity and relief in his eyes. He pressed a kiss to the soft lips in front of him and then chucked him under the chin. “Run away with me, Stark,” Steve asked softly.
He could admit, it had been a blow. Ever since managing to find a group of solid, real friends for the first time in his life, he’d been looking forward to being able to spend the different holidays with them, bonding and experiencing how it all felt when it was done with the people you loved around you. And considering the fact that all of those friends were actually Unhuman- Vampires, Werewolves, Demons and the like- he’d been
Tony stopped moving once he got to Steve’s side and grabbed his hand excitedly. “Listen- I’m going to propose something awesome to you that you really should have thought of before deciding it was best to fuck off into the middle of nowhere on your own, but whatever, I won’t hold it to you, I
instead I was too busy worrying over the fact that you nearly fucking died yesterday, because you’re a
“You’re- you’re an asshole, I hate you! I’ve always hated you. You suck.”
Tony hitched his bag up, the anger returning as he recalled his story, "-seniors asking an eight grader to do all their homework? There were
“Sure,” Steve shrugged non-committedly, and Tony looked at him in a way that let Steve knew he was fully aware Steve was lying through his teeth but was pleased about it anyway.
“Thank you, Steve,” she said earnestly, which just confused him even further, “that… tells us a lot, actually. We didn’t mean to offend you, but we wanted to check.” Her face fell a little, revealing something harder when she added: “People tend to have ulterior motives when it comes to Tony. We’re almost all he has- we have to look out for him.”
“Because
Walking out of the school grounds rapidly, he zipped up his jacket and hoisted his bag high onto his shoulders, keeping his head down to avoid the sharp winds that bit at any exposed area of skin. He should really have brought a warmer jacket, but he hadn’t exactly been thinking particularly straight that morning, so sue him. The cold wasn’t so bad anyway. It stung at first, but then your skin just went numb and you stopped caring. The cold was familiar, in a way. Steve had been cold his entire damn life.
Steve laughed shortly. Oh, the days when he’d come back every day with a new shiner. Bucky was now a trained professional in Steve-Rogers-Based First aid. And those sorts of skills were ones you kept with you for life.
“Ugh, Peter does
But Tony merely shrugged. “Who said it was for him?” He asked haughtily, before marching down the corridor with Steve’s laughter trailing behind him
Tony was silent for a moment. “No, it’s not… why are you asking, Steve?”
“Tony?” Steve said in confusion, voice hoarse, “Tony, what’s… are you okay? What’s- what’s wrong, are you- oh God, your reactor, where’s your reactor, Tony-“
Tony looked between them all. “What the hell is going on?” He blurted.
Eh. They had the rest of their lives. Tony could wait until morning.
Tony yelled, throwing his hands into the air.
Of course, just as Steve was getting nicely fitted into his spiral of self loathing, Sam chose that moment to burst open the door with absolutely no regard for people with hangovers at all. Steve groaned louder, cursing a string of truly foul words as he curled tightly in on himself- but the idiot didn’t seem to care much, damn him.
“Yeah, never better, Rogers,” he said, beginning to turn back away, “go back to class, alright? It’s all good. We’re cool. You did me a favor with Zeke a few days ago, I returned it. Now we’re even, yeah?”
(Warnings- talks of suicide throughout the plot)
he scolded,
Thor turned to Steve. “He’ll give us at
“Hey, no Steve, c’mon—”
Then Loki knocked him out, and Steve mentally fucking berated himself for being so stupid. Rule number
“Our what, Steve?”
It was ridiculous. It was ridiculous and unrealistic and a perfect example of steve’s idealism.
Steve laughed. “I’ve always said we should try camping, but you just laughed at me.”
Goddamn Jan, opening all these doors and telling him about the way Tony looked at him. It was probably all in his damned head anyway. He shook himself, sitting back down gingerly as Thor and Tony bickered behind him. A moment passed before someone tapped his shin, and when he looked up he saw Sam raising his eyebrows over to him.
And without another second to debate the matter, the mighty Hulk turned tail and sprinted out of the kitchen, leaving Tony sitting with a lapful of pooey baby. He blinked a few times, desperately trying to resist the urge to emit a truly foul string of curses. “Hulk is a god-damn coward,” Tony declared loudly instead, turning to Steve and then Peter and waggling a finger. “You hear me? He’s a gigantic fucking wimp. I want you to remember that when you grow up, kid. If you learn only one thing while you’re here, it should be that.”
“I know,” she nodded, “I don’t blame you. I think he is too. Natasha put him in his place after you left- although I think he’d already started getting the hint after what you’d said to him.” She paused, making a little face and throwing her hair back with a twist of her neck. “He does want to try and put things right. I promise. I spoke to him this morning.”
Tony sighed, letting his head fall back against Steve’s shoulder. “Right,” he griped, “right, I guess this is just my life, huh? Fine. Okay. Lead the way, Pack-Wolf Rogers. Just please, don’t try and feed me anything raw. I will throw up. Go fetch some jello or something, I could eat a bit of that.”
Steve was okay. He was… he’d be fine. This—whatever it was—was all reversible. If they’d managed to pull Bucky out of it after seventy years of conditioning, then Tony was sure less than 48 hours would be a piece of cake.
She paused, and Steve heard he run a hand through her hair. “You lost your mother, Steve, and that is heartbreaking- but Bucky lost her too. And although it wasn’t nearly the same sort of grief you felt, it still hurt him a hell of a lot more than he ever let on to you.”
“Yes.”
steal your god-damn shoes!” Sam yelled, throwing his hands in the air, “you probably just left them in some dirty-ass corner in your room like you always do!”
“Steve Rogers, I am not your personal pillow whom you can take naps on like some stray cat-”
When his hand settled gently against Tony’s waist, the other man shivered, but he leaned in heavily against Steve’s side. Steve held him, his mouth pressing up against Tony’s temple. His skin was warm, and Steve savoured. Today had been too close, and Steve could feel the anxiety crawl over his back, as it would continue for the next few days at the very least. But this wasn't about him. It wasn't him who'd nearly died today, after all.
“It’s bad. We need to get pizza or I’m gonna starve.” She made a sad face and then pressed her hands together in prayer, and Steve snorted. She was her father’s daughter alright, that was for damn sure.
Tony’s choked, horrified. “
Tony froze, the smile slipping right off his face. Steve hadn’t called him selfish in... well,
“I don’t know why you feel the need to be a dick at any given opportunity,” Steve cut in immediately, holding tight to his bag as he stood straight in front of the taller boy, “I don’t know where you get off at from making other people feel like shit, either- but all it makes you is an asshole who no one actually likes, you know. It doesn’t make you tough shit. You’re not bigger ‘cause you pick on little fucking kids or dig in the places that you know would hurt someone, and I assure you, if I see you doing it to
Tony huffed in frustration, but the small movement of sitting up had already made him nauseous and the pain was slowly starting to edge in. He felt weak, cold and yet hot all at once, and he couldn’t move without shaking. He truly didn’t have much choice but to just lie there and be useless while his friends worked around him.
Either way, Steve wasn’t getting in unless he really put some effort into it. And Tony wasn’t getting out, either. He ignored the claustrophobia of that thought, and instead just stepped over another body, seeing the mark for SUBLEVEL4 loom up above him. “Is the biosignature moving around?” Tony asked quietly, hearing his boots clang unnaturally loudly in the deathly-silent stairwell.
bad,” he said eventually, a small smile twitching on his mouth, “not when it’s that sort of costume. It’s just that most of them… well, most of them aren’t playboy bunnies and sexy cops, and it’s the bad stuff that I associate Halloween with. But I do think we could meet in the middle a little bit. Maybe not, y’know, go through every tradition, but I could get behind some fancy dress, if you still wanted?”
He stilled. “I’m fine, Steve. Nothing I can’t handle.”
Steve snarled, and rolled right back on to his feet, sprinting back to the edge, readying to throw himself back off, but someone put out an arm, catching his waist and spinning them both around, using the momentum to shove them to the ground.
“Please don’t hate my friends, I swear, they are normal people, they are just ridiculously overprotective of me and like to vet anyone who gets within a three-foot radius of me if they can manage. Pepper is actually a sweetheart, really, I promise… Oh no, they didn’t threaten you did they? God, I’m gonna fucking kill them-“  Tony’s harried voice rang clearly through the speaker, and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle at the lack of introduction and the way Tony had instead chosen to dive straight into the middle of a conversation.
He should never have taken on this mission. He’d known, deep down, that this would happen. Tony was his kryptonite, and there had never been a hope in hell that Steve could do this and come out whole.
“I’m in.”
“Shut the fuck up, loser,” the bigger guy spat on him, actually fucking spat on him, and then punched him in the mouth for good measure, “this’ll teach you not to talk shit about people who are gonna be more than you ever will. The fuck were you even talking about- Ty’s a fuckin’ beast, he’s got people fallin’ at his feet.”
“He was the one who told me that it might be- that there might be something deeper going on with it all, actually,” Steve said with a shrug, “I can admit, I was a little too hurt to be objective at the time. Bucky… well. He likes you, you know? You’re friends. Even if you both try and tell us otherwise.” He patted Tony’s arm and then slipped past him, heading for Bucky’s kitchen. “He’ll probably ignore you. He’s watching Brooklyn nine-nine.”
Human.
It was funny, but sometimes Steve forgot he was dating someone famous.
“What the fuck is the problem, guys?” Tony asked incredulously, and
They stared at eachother for a few seconds, before Clint gave a little salute and Tony breathed out in relief.
So, without even thinking about it, he leaped forward and extended his arm, pushing it out of the way before it could land anywhere near Tony.
She remained quiet after he was finished, and it was only when the heavy silence enveloped the room that he realised he’d been shouting. His breath was coming in heavy and he could feel his heart racing, a panic response to the yelling in the room. He’d never used to shake when he’d argued with people before.
Tony saw the movement though, and he looked up in question, so Steve stammered out a small, “can—can I?”, because he didn’t think he was going to be able to sleep without hearing it.
“First to ten picks dinner?”
“Ugh, why so many questions?” Tony huffed and folded his arms, “my plan will not get us killed, Steve, I promise. And if it does, then it’s most certainly not through choice.”
There was no reaction for a moment, but then slowly, smoothly, Steve lifted his head and looked Tony right in the eyes. His face was blank for a moment, until something creased in his forehead and he opened his mouth. “T… Tony,” he answered, voice like sandpaper.
,” Thor muttered, before sighing and then getting down on his knees so Steve could slip off again. “Just wait until you want to do something against the rules-
“You just dropped your bowl,” Tony said dumbly.
“Tony,” Steve said calmly, “I think we just need to trust them.”
“Wha’ddya think?” Bucky bounced up and down on the weirdly coloured seats and turned to him expectantly, “cool, huh?”
Steve remained quiet, thinking about the fact that Thor pretty much always had an empty house ready for him and his guests. Thinking about how loud and obvious Thor always was; how he made friends with everyone and loved the attention that was given to him by them all. Because in reality, when Thor got home, it was to a vacant world. To the reality that his brother was off the rails and that his parents didn’t even care about it. They sent the money over for Thor to keep the apartment running and food in their stomachs, and that was the largest part they played in his or Loki’s life.
There were a few seconds where no words were spoken. Then: “The fuck was that noise jus’ then?”
you. That’s all I need to like him, buddy.”
Tony’s face was soft when he looked at Steve, and a moment later he came to rest his hand against Steve’s jaw, thumb stroking against the light stubble just starting to dust his face. Steve smiled up at him, tilting his head further into Tony’s hold. “You didn’t need to go to all that effort,” Tony murmured, “I can handle this.”
Steve frowned. He couldn’t tell exactly what that meant, but it sure sounded like a swear word. “You okay, Tony?” He asked.
He looked back down at the blueprint for Clint’s bow, feeling something traitorously hot and prickly behind his eyes before he shoved those thoughts away forcibly. Right now, the team had him. And all he had to be was good enough. That was it.
Sam paused, glancing at Steve, who just shook his head helplessly. Sam swallowed. “In order to protect the wellbeing of Tony, I can’t do that, Sir.”
“It’s me, Tony.” There was a distant laugh, “I’m here, and the others are on their way. Just hold on.”
Steve’s smile was soft, worn, a little sad, and he pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead before slipping away, heading off in the direction of the doors once more. “Think about it, okay?” He called out behind him, and then with one last glance in Tony’s direction, he wandered out of the workshop. Tony watched him jog up the stairs and disappear from sight.
“Someone who no longer attends this school, lets put it that way,” Natasha answered her, smiling sweetly and sending a small shiver running down Steve’s spine. He made a mental note to never stand Clint up on a date.
Steve looked out of the window, wiping his face roughly and forcing himself to stay calm. He couldn’t panic, it would make everything worse. He needed to be rational, and get Tony to the hospital as soon as possible. Broken ribs, Thor had said, black eye, concussion, something wrong with his wrist. He’d barely been conscious when Thor had found him. God only knew how he’d managed to drive his way there. Steve didn’t even want to think about it.
Clint scoffed, turning to Steve, who was stood cooking eggs on the stove. “Cap, you can vouch for me here, right? I am the master at hide and seek. No one beats me at hide and seek.”
Tony gestured to the door, opening it with a swing. He grabbed Steve by the arm and turned his head one last time, quirking a smile and cocking his head again. The hair fell back into his eyes, when he did that. “I could clear the whole room out if I clapped my hands five times, if you really want.”
"We don't have a cot," Steve said, fingers flexing against his side before lifting, just a little, as if he wanted to touch the kid. But a second later he thought better of it, and then let his hand drop again.
Clint was frozen in place for a minute, before he ran a hand through his hair and shook his head. “Don’t say shit like that, Steve,” he responded, “I don’t wanna hear that.”
Before Steve could even fully process what Tony had just said, he turned the handle and then slipped out, waving once behind him, then turning and disappearing into the darkness.
He pointed down at the toy- and then he burst out laughing again.
The bill was delivered, and Steve took a moment to gawp incredulously at the price (10 dollars for two scoops, seriously?) before putting down the money with a sigh. Tony watched him do it, eyebrow raised curiously. “Hey, so Steve, what are you doing there?”
be the divorcer!”

Steve nodded. “It’s for the best,” he said firmly, glancing over at Peter as the kid poked Thor with the Widow’s Bite, watching in fascination as the skin turned white where he put the pressure.
- that was the nearest you’d ever been to be, y’know, I calculated it. And she kept tryn’a talk to me after that, but all that was going round in my head were- were those numbers, the distances, you-“
Tony briefly thought about how glad he was about the fact that he had not, in fact, died in that cabin. And that his friends were all willing to move their Christmas-slash-Boxing Day meal down into the medical bay so that they could share it with him in here. And that they were all as insane, irritating and amazing as they were.
Tony snorted and sprinkled a few herbs into the mix. Rosemary, it smelt like. “Oh, sweetheart, my loins are positively
His face falls a little, because
“Fuck off,” Steve spat, then looked on in surprise as Bruce came around the corridor alongside him, also escorted by teachers. Then Sam followed, and Clint and Natasha too, until all five of them were getting frogmarched down the hallways, presumably to the Principal’s office. Steve seethed, chest heaving as he shook the sweat and blood out of his eyes. People were staring at them as they went, but he didn’t give a fuck. Not one.
He hoped Tiberius Stone choked.
It was a joke, but he heard Bucky sighing in relief anyway. Steve couldn’t even blame him. The last half a year had been kind of… messy. And the situation he was in right now was far from perfect.
“No. But I have you.” He broke off, biting at his lip for a second before continuing. “You can cut the CCTV from where you are, right?”
“Ha ha,” Steve rolled his eyes and swung off the door frame, “I’m gonna veto that rule on the grounds that Tony is super hot and I get to make out with him, which is honestly much more appealing than staying here and being sat on by Sam again. Sorry!” His friends booed at him loudly, but he only laughed as he ducked back out of the door and grabbed his keys from the side. “I say that with the utmost love!” He called out to them all, before pulling open the door and stepping outside.
“Find down and go to it.”
“So,” Tony began, looking around the room, “seems like you all had fun.”
Steve figured he was probably the same.
He stumbled a little when he got to the staircase, but neither of them saw it.
Of course, no one responded.
“Because—look, it’s not even an official rota, you touched him last, you do the diaper, that’s the rule—”
“Steve?” Tony asked, voice a little panicked as he squirmed, “Steve, baby, I’m okay- but you gotta let go, you’re hurting me.”
Bucky looked at him like he knew everything Steve was thinking- or at least, the self deprecating parts anyway. He was uncannily good at that sort of thing, and Steve had very often received smacks around the head because of his mind-reading abilities.
“Well, I was trying to prove a point, wasn’t I? You should know that about me by now.” Wordlessly, he reached into his jacket, deft fingers pulling out Steve’s phone from the inside of his pocket. “No, this is- this is why I brought you here. Figured it would be… nicer, y’know?”
“Sounds a little hypocritical if you ask me,” Steve folded his arms. Tony just shrugged, taking another long drag and blowing out.
and then didn’t bother to divulge the fact you’d gotten
He’d missed this so much.
Tony said nothing. Steve watched him slip through a dozen different emotions all in the space of a moment: disbelief and apprehension. Realisation. Gief. “No,” he shook his head almost dazedly, voice numb, “No, he… he wouldn’t.”
“Yes, JARVIS—”
Thor, looked between them, then gestured awkwardly toward the kitchen. “I’ll just. Uh. Coffee,” he said, eloquently, before ducking out and leaving Steve and Tony to it.
He smiled to himself and then covered it with his hand, before sending off a quick
He sighed, letting his head drop back into his arms. He felt something tap against his head a few seconds later, and then tilted his head and eyed up the ball of paper that had landed just by his hand. Of course, when he opened it up and recognized Jan’s swirly handwriting a moment later, he automatically raised his middle finger in her general direction, trying not to laugh at the thinly veiled insult she’d written on the scrap paper. When he actually glanced up at her, she was just smiling innocently.
“Fucking pathetic.”
Tony smiled, a warm feeling spreading through his chest. “It was nice,” he said simply, “he still hasn’t moved away from the Carbonara yet.”
“I mean- okay, uh, not like… majorly. Just a little. And I’d much rather it didn’t do that, you know? I’m not gonna die, don’t freak out,” Tony assured him hurriedly as Steve froze in the middle of his room, “just… an inconvenience, really-“
With one last glance back at the door now swinging shut, Steve saw Tony, his eyes fixed on Rumlow as the man stood in front of him. His gaze was hard and his chin was stuck out, defiant.
“Steve, look at me,” Bruce’s hand rested on his shoulder, firm and grounding, and Steve’s eyes darted to him, “Tony is fine. He’s alive. He brought you in. You
boxes, so-”
Tony caught him just as he was about to turn the corner, and this time when he said his name, it was more a breathless yell with the starting sound of an ‘S’, due to the fact Tony had begun sprinting the length of the corridor in order to catch up with him. Steve turned, looking at him in mild terror as Tony careered forward, shoes leaving little bits of mashed potato as he went. “Tony, what are you-”
Well. He could rectify that later.
Steve pursed his lips and gripped his shield just that little bit tighter. “I’m not too sure yet,” he murmured, head turning back to the main machine in the centre of the room. That seemed like it might answer a few questions here. He moved cautiously forward, circling the instrument once and trying to see anything particularly telling. Of course, none of it really gave anything away, and there were no obvious power switches, so Steve was pretty much out of ideas. All he knew is that it was huge and connected to the weird tubes that were holding strangely familiar silhouettes. Steve really didn’t want to know what AIM had been working on. He just wanted to shut it down.
Tony grunted, flexing his hand and wincing. He should have kept the ice-pack on. He really hated when Steve was right about things.
He sighed and looked down, checking his phone again. Tony still hadn’t replied, seeing as he was probably still in detention. Fury had kicked him out of the office before Steve could hear much, but it sounded like Tony might be spending the next few weeks kept back an hour after school because of the fight. Steve just hoped that they wouldn’t try and make Tony apologize- not that Tony

It had just happened so fast. Tony had hardly even known what to do with himself. One moment he’d been fine, walking through the door with his briefcase in hand, just glad to be home early as opposed to late for once- and then suddenly he’d been
She pouted, folding her arms and staring at him. “Just because you’re not getting any action doesn’t mean you have to be bitter, Rogers.”
“You miss me?” Tony said lightly, knowing it was dumb as soon as he’d said it.
He jerked his head to Rhodey, instantly seeing the dark clothes and smart dress and early morning and solemn faces and remembering, oh God, he remembered how his teacher had called him out of class that day 6 months ago with the same face,
Tony glared at him, jaw clenched so tight that Steve thought his teeth would shatter. Steve just stared, breath not coming at all as he gently pushed Tony in Ty’s direction. He had to do what Ty said, for his own sake.
Steve looked between his friend and the soaking wet, muddy grave. “It’s fine, you’ll get filthy and your clothes are-“
“I think you should apologize to Bertha.”
He shut his eyes and ended the call with a shaking finger, while Tony was mid-sentence talking about how he was grateful Steve had come to help, and that he’d trusted him.
“Hey, you don’t have divorce rights, I already declared

“Until next time, Steve Rogers,” Tony murmured, placing one last kiss to his mouth and then lingering, just for a moment, until finally turning around. He glanced over the window and waved, and Steve saw his friends stare back, open-mouthed.
“Really- I personally would’ve said more along the lines of cyberpunk, but y’know, I guess I can see a bit of the retro aesthetic too,” Tony looked up at him- filthy from engine grease and smoke patches, hair falling into his face in messy strands, stripped down to a worn-out tank top and the jeans he’d been wearing last night. “Hi.”
Steve stilled, his smile dropping. He pulled away a second later. “Tony, we’ve talked about this,” he said, voice gentle, but underlined with something Tony couldn’t pinpoint. However, he didn’t let that stop him, hands tightening in Steve’s shirt as he attempted to convey his point.
Tony didn’t say anything more as Steve let him into the house and flicked on the lights. He quickly shucked off his wet jumper and jacket and then tried not to shiver too obviously from the cold of the empty house. Tony wasn’t fooled though, and with another sigh he pulled off his own hoodie and, despite Steve’s protests, forced it around his shoulders. “You’re an idiot and you are going to end up taking my entire wardrobe soon,” he informed Steve as he quickly kissed the top of his head again, “hey, shall I make us some hot chocolate?”
Suddenly, there was a sudden jolt, and Steve felt the pain flare up against his temple as it was hit by something sharp and brutal.
“-WHY THE FUCK IS THERE NOT A DEFIB ON IN THE PERSONAL QUARTERS?” Tony screamed frantically, cursing himself for his own fucking idiocy,
"Nuh uh," Steve raised his hands and backed away, eyes wide, "you're doing fine. I- uh- I'll go get some soft foods. Banana? That should be okay, right? And- uh, water? See if that'll help, just give me a minute-" and like a flash, Steve had run from the room, shutting the door quietly behind him and leaving Tony staring bewilderedly at the space Steve had left. For a man who could go toe to toe with a monster and not break a sweat, he sure was terrified of a six-month-old baby.
But, after another five minutes sat staring at the opposite wall and thinking of everything that he had to do and wasn’t, he ended up accepting defeat. Sleep wasn’t returning to him, at least not today. He needed to get up and do stuff anyway- it wasn’t easy trying to keep an entire company afloat while also juggling superheroism, but someone had to do it. Tony had thousands of livelihoods resting on his shoulders, after all.
When Tony didn’t say anything, Steve barrelled on. “And I’ll teach you. We all will. Every game we can think of, we’ll do it during team-building-”
He paused. Natasha wasn't the only one there. Peter was sat on her left, fiddling contentedly with something in his hands as he looked in fascination at the screen, and Clint was on the other side, a box of cereal in hand as he too watched Peppa Pig go about her day. Clint was back in his pajamas- or maybe he hadn't even changed in the first place.
Steve pressed the button.
Tony stilled. “It’s different.”
“Tony,” Tiberius said, the same stupid smile sticking to his face as he shook his head down at Steve, like he was some sort of insolent child, “I’ve seen you around. With him. But believe me, that is not going to work out. Tony- he isn’t known for staying long. Picks up a new toy every few months, that’s just what he’s like. He finds someone interesting and then likes to make them feel special for a bit, make them think he cares. But he gets bored. He’ll drop you when he does.” Ty shrugged casually, patting Steve on the back, “you just stay with your little friends, and leave us. You don’t belong with someone like Tony, and he doesn’t really want someone like you. Not really. He’s not who you think he is- no matter what he’ll have you believe.”
“No,” Tony told him petulantly, “I’m still 23 and I won’t hear any other opinions on the matter, thank you. Steve can attest.”
He hated Manhattan.
“And what about it?” Steve eyed him with a grin, “climbing trees is fun.”
“This is your choice, Tony,” he murmured with a shrug, “you wanna risk it with your old man, fine by me. I don’t care either way. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Just come back. Where you
Tony paused. “What, you think he’s some sort of… experiment?” He asked. “If that were the case, why the hell would they bring him to us? That doesn’t make sense.”
Steve pursed his lips, hands flexing underneath him. He’d worked out the timelines of it all. “And before that, he woke up in a hospital thinking about how he was lucky to escape from me with his life,” he said bitterly, looking up at Natasha, “what did he say about it?”
“I’m looking at your nose. It’s still crooked from when you got punched by Thunderball. You think you’re gonna have an ugly nose forever now? Because I might have to break up with you if that’s the case.”
heart?” Jane asked from inside Thor’s arms. And no, if you’re wondering, that hadn’t taken long at all. He really hadn’t expected Jane to be quite so… forward. Not that it was
The name ‘Agent Rogers’ blinked innocuously back at him. The contents of the message were hidden, and so he slowly unlocked the phone, spare hand going almost subconsciously to his gun. It was a comfort thing. Agent Rogers hadn’t been seen on the face of the Earth in the three months since he’d broken Iron Man from jail. He had no means of contact with Fury.
Tony blinked a few times, then shrugged. “Just wondering. I don’t want to- to intrude or anything, you know? And there are a lot of people who don’t exactly have… the highest opinions of me.” He shrugged again, looking down at his feet, “didn’t want to ruin your party, that’s all.”
) found out that Tony was actually alive. He’d met up with Tony at the hospital where he’d been checked into and essentially barred him from leaving until the Doctor’s saw fit, shooting Tony stony glares each time Tony even so much as mentioned departing before he was suggested to.
“Ah.” That was going to be… difficult. Steve didn’t really have a backup plan. He couldn’t afford to involve Natasha any more than he already had, and other than that, he didn’t have anyone else left to rely on. “Guess I’ll just… uh. I dunno. I’ll jump town for a bit, find a motel or something—”
“I think I’m about to get mugged, which- uh- sucks,” Steve admitted quickly, paired with a nervous laugh, “but maybe if they see me talking to someone they’ll go away, so I’m just gonna keep you on the line for as long as possible-“
Because it didn’t make
The night was perfect. Things always were, with him and Steve. They bickered over the wine and played footsie under the table, and Tony didn’t even complain when Steve stole a bite of his food. Mostly. He may have complained once. Passed a comment or two about how Steve could have also had this dish if he had just strayed from his stupid beloved carbonara. But Steve had just patted his hand and then stolen another bite, and Tony figured that next time he was going to have to use more devious methods to get out of his comfort zone. Perhaps of the sexual nature. He’d always been rather susceptible to those.
oopsies,,, let the Primal Desire to leave everything i write on a cliffhanger take over,,,,
The sprint to the aircraft was relatively short, and with both Bucky and Steve shielding Tony, it was almost easy. They all reached the ship after a few seconds, and Steve quickly turned, lifting his shield up in front of Tony’s path so that the other man could leap on. With a grunt, Steve swung the shield up high, and Tony flew upward with it, landing gracefully on the wing of the ship as the momentum propelled him.
Then, a second later, there was a tremendous bang as Steve slammed his foot into the door frame and sent the whole thing flying off its hinges. Tony jumped in surprise. “Isn’t that supposed to be reinforced?” He asked Bruce in incredulity.
Steve groaned, walking easily with Tony toward the group of people, who quickly started scattering, yelling and moaning in despair as they watched Steve squeeze his hands against Tony’s ass.
Slumping onto his bed with a sigh, he pulled off his jacket and slung it carelessly into the corner of the room, toeing off his shoes and then hauling them onto the bed heavily. He knew that he wasn’t… he didn’t care about being rich or whatever, but he just wished that sometimes he had enough money to at least
But another five minutes went by, and Steve was no closer to finding solid ground.
In front of him, Die Hard was playing at full volume on the TV- to the left of him, Bucky was trying to throw popcorn kernels into his mouth and being a general nuisance- and underneath him, he was using Clint’s back as a footrest. Their rather small living room was relatively packed full with people (If nine counted as a lot, that was), and they were laying amongst what would probably be best described as a dumpster at this point. The remains of shittily-wrapped paper were strewn over the floor amongst candy wrappers and humans who’d taken to use the rug instead of couches- pillows lay in heaps in different areas of the room from where Natasha and Clint had made nests, and Steve was certain he and Sam would be picking out popcorn kernels from the carpet for weeks to come.
He found Tony’s hand and linked their fingers together, smiling at him reassuringly. Tony looked down at their intertwined fingers for a second- and he looked so fucking confused, like he really just hadn’t expected any of that at all. Steve squeezed their hands tighter.
His face froze as the penny dropped. “Tell me you didn’t,” he said as Steve came to sit down on the couch next to him. “Steve, please say this isn’t what I think it is.”
. Gone. Steve could deal with his own shit alone, obviously, despite the fact that it was Steve who was stranded in Tony’s fucking house for five fucking hours.
Tony licked his bottom lip absently and nodded. “Thank you. Now I—”
“Of course I know that.”
“Thank you,” JARVIS said, “now I must ask a favour of you.”
There was a slight break in the conversation, before JARVIS spoke again. “I took the liberty of switching on the recording device on this computer during the altercation with Howard. With clear audio evidence and visual confirmation, providing you take pictures of your injuries, we can put forward an almost watertight case against your—”
Steve just raised an eyebrow, leaning back and letting his fingers tap out against the tabletop. He wanted to say something- if he’d been living in his own home, he would’ve opened up the invitation for Tony to stay there if he needed somewhere. His mom had always, always offered the house to anyone who was in trouble- it had gotten Bucky out of a fair few tight spots in his time.
"Okay, here's an idea," Natasha said after a few seconds of heavy silence, her eyes analyzing the baby. Better than Steve's
But still. “You couldn’t have just- y’know- called me?” He asked, waving his hands through the air.
Steve nodded. “You’re brilliant,” he declared, “you’re just… brilliant.”
Steve turned to Bruce in surprise, and the boy just gave him a tired shrug. “We’ve all got shit,” he said blankly, before looking away again. Steve didn’t know why the comment had thrown him so much—maybe he’d just never really figured Bruce to be the type who needed a social worker. He’d always seemed so… put together. Then again. What did Steve know? Like Bruce had just said—everyone had shit.
, Steve. You’re breakable too.”
He wasn’t sure how long it had been. Once more, he couldn’t remember much. Falling, he does recall. There were…. The team, they’d all been there. He’d said-
“It’s not fucking
Steve nodded and moved over to the door once again. He wondered if he’d be able to move the conference table against it, stop anyone else getting in. His heart was racing under his chest, mentally calculating how long it was going to take someone to find them. The alarm had been set off a few minutes ago, a two-tone whine that informed everyone there was a breach in security. That meant that all SHIELD agents that reported to this compound would be alerted, sleeping or no, and they would be rushing in to act as backup. Those agents still in the building would already be searching; starting at the bottom floor and working their way up. This was a conference floor mostly, so there would be no one around. But the one above was a training room, and below was for offices, so that meant they were pretty much surrounded on all sides.
you about that?”
“No, don’t even try and tell me otherwise, Steve Rogers, I can read you like an open book. I know you’re going to try and deny it until your dying day, but you don’t see the way he looks at you when your back’s turned.” She sighed again, hitching her bag higher onto her shoulder as she grinned over to him wryly, “and he doesn’t see you doing the same thing, either. Hopeless, both of you.”
“Lalalala, I can’t hear you, see, this is useless-“
“There could be a reasonable explanation for this,” Tony said, pushing back the voice that kept saying
Steve gaped a little, completely shocked that his idea had even been considered. He wasn’t even sure why he’d said it- he was lactose fucking intolerant, for God’s sake, he didn’t
Steve shrugged, smiling a bit. “Well, Thor was coming too, so I figured I’d- uh-“
“This isn’t your fault,” Natasha told him urgently, “Steve, believe me, if it was, you would
Pulling out his phone quickly, he dialled Natasha’s number, only having to wait half a second before she picked up with a crisp: “You coming back up?”
Steve smiled into Tony’s neck, and the other boy felt it. “What?” he asked softly, mouth moving against Steve’s forehead.
It took less than a minute for Steve to arrive. He knocked on the door four times, said his name like Tony didn’t know who it was, and then asked if he could come in like it wasn’t his fucking room too. Tony blinked rapidly at the coldness spreading through him- it felt like they’d just gone back to the beginning again, before they’d fallen in love, before they’d even
In response, Thor whirled around and then leaned down, kissing Tony on the forehead as well. “Now it is even,” he declared, and then turned away again, wandering off to the kitchen, presumably for more snacks. Tony just sighed and smiled at Steve
"Oh yeah, sure," Steve said as he pushed open the locker room door, surprised when Bucky didn't laugh. "Wait, you're being serious?"
Steve grinned as he watched Bucky open his mouth to respond, then snap it closed again a second later, probably trying to figure out if Sam was yanking his chain again, as he called it.
"Both, in a way," answered Gamora. "Ego was a god, and we destroyed his planet, which then destroyed him."
Tears stung Peter's eyes as he studied Gwen's beautiful face, etched in concern. "You—you don't know everything that happened down there," he whispered. "I never told you, 'cause—'cause I didn't wanna scare you, but—"
"He is my adoptive father," Gamora said softly. "He destroyed half the people on my planet when I was a child, killed both my parents, and then took me away with him as recompense."
And since Sam was there too, he supposed now was just as good a time as any.
Or the boy Peter, sitting alone in his hospital room.
"Mmm," Tony moaned against Steve's skin as he reached into Steve's bedside table, searching for the bottle of lube that hadn't seen the light of day for months and handing it to Steve. Steve's hands were shaking as he flipped open the cap, pouring a generous amount on his first two fingers while Tony shucked out of his pants, throwing his head back with a guttural groan as Steve slowly pressed his slick fingers inside him.
"Tony, two choppers just landed not too far from the main entrance," said Natasha. "Clint's heading out there now."
"It's gonna be okay, Peter," Papa whispered a few seconds later, his fingertips massaging Peter's scalp. "I'll make sure of it."
“Yeah.  Fury didn't happen to send you any files in the last couple minutes, did he?”
"So does this mean that you've actually located your handlamp?" she asked as she stepped inside the room, her own lamp clutched in her slender, piano-player fingers. "I was beginning to wonder if you'd remembered where you put it."
look.
On his next inhale, Steve lowers his hands to the block, splaying his fingers out slightly before curling them over the edge.  Releasing his breath, he eases back, his knuckles going white as he waits for the blast of the starting gun.  His entire field of vision narrows to the clear blue water enclosed by the red and white lane markers, and the crisp black line painted along the bottom.
Why him? Why them?
was the difference between he and Papa and every other enhanced person on their team. Aside from Uncle Thor, Peter was the only enhanced person that he knew of who hadn't received his powers as an adult, after the fact. And while Uncle Thor was a literal god—and likely not even HYDRA seemed to be up for targeting actual gods, especially if doing so would very likely piss off Uncle Thor's father and bring down the entire wrath of Asgard upon them—Peter could see how having soldiers who were genetically enhanced from birth, mutants, as it were, would be preferable to those they would have to artificially create.
“I am aware of that, Tony,” Fury said, far too nonchalantly for Tony’s taste.  “And before you ask, yes, I am also aware that Rumlow has missed three scheduled check-ins, since you saw fit to hack into SHIELD’s computer systems early this morning.”
looks.  “Okay?  So?  Then what’s the problem?”
“Well, then it sounds like we might need to go do some shopping, right?” Steve replied.
"That's 'cause it's the absolute truth," agreed Tony. He tugged Steve's face down for another kiss, one that nearly made Steve's knees buckle. "But you are pretty cute, so I guess I'll keep you anyway."
the code said, and Tony barely suppressed another eyeroll at the thought. He'd heard enough whispered gossip just walking from his office to the classroom a few moments ago to fill an entire marketplace for the next week.
"Yes, I am," Howard said warily as he glanced at Pym, who was adamantly refusing to meet Howard's eyes. "But dare I say that I believe you knew that already, given that you're accompanied by my colleague here?"
"No, thanks," Tony said quickly. "I'm… I usually just stay in my office most of the time. Much easier to work in there with the lights than it is at home where it's dark."
And most of all, determination.
"Yeah, so far that's the current plan." Peter knew Uncle Thor and Uncle Bucky were looking forward to the trip, as long as Uncle Thor's brother didn't cause any more trouble in the meantime. He'd been having to return to Asgard almost every week lately to take care of something or other regarding Loki, which was pretty amazing considering that Loki was still imprisoned for his role in the Chitauri invasion.
"Well, I know that
"Who says I'm tiptoeing around anything?" Dad snapped. "I have never been known to—"
"Oh, really? And how's that feeling now, huh?"
that he’s never seen anything so unbelievably swoon-worthy as the dimple in Steve Rogers’ right cheek.
“But… buddy, I—I don't—I can’t believe why he would—”  Dad broke off, shaking his head.  “Even if this were true, which I don’t—but anyway—okay.  Pete, even if this were true, there’s no way Obie would’ve been able to send Hammer Industries the money for these things without someone else noticing.  After all this time, someone would’ve eventually caught some whiff of it.”
Woohoo, Scott has arrived!  😎
Tony whimpered a few seconds later, rolling his hips against Steve's and pulling a choked gasp from his throat. Steve nodded against Tony's neck, curling his arm around his waist and rolling them so he was almost on his back, with Tony half on top of him. Tony had told him months ago that this was his favourite position for making love, his back against Steve's chest with Steve beneath him, and while it was a bit harder for Steve to see Tony's face this way, he loved that it allowed his hands to roam freely across Tony's incredible body.
"I'm here, Tony," Steve said, followed by a huge rush of air. He quickly tapped the commands for his orbit into his navigational computer, unbuckling his mask once JARVIS took over. "I made it through."
"You are most welcome, sir."
"Uh huh."
"Someone obviously messed with the program somehow," he said once his monitor had stopped its annoying beeping. "But it can't have been very recently because then my encryptions would've caught it, so it would've had to have been really early on in the process."
looks. "I already know that, Peter, just like anyone with half a brain knows that. Besides, it's not like Captain America could be corrupted anyway, right?"
"Yes, I do," Green Lady said evenly, reaching for Blaster Guy's blaster. "So why don't we all take a deep breath, and back off."
But first, the race.
Peter's mind had to alter the memory himself or the experiment would be a failure, only Steve had honestly no clue how he and Tony were going to be able to just watch their boy be tortured by the very same man who should've loved him like a grandson.
"Um, is there a reason why all you guys are just standing in the parking lot?" Carol suddenly asked from behind Steve's shoulder, with Colonel Rhodes standing next to her. "'Cause I thought we were supposed to be meeting inside?"
As Steve had promised, everything was set up. He’d made sure of it before hopping into bed that night, so that Tony had nothing to worry over in the morning. Of course, no plan was perfect, and Tony ended up fretting about this and that anyway, but luckily it was nothing that they couldn’t handle, and after another set of reassurance that it really
“Care to give me a hint?”
Slowly, he turned back to the other person in the room, who was busy watching him with a carefully neutral face. Tony’s walls were up, and they were up high. Biting back the urge to sigh, Steve moved around the desk, crouching down on his haunches as he looked at Tony’s oddly positioned arm. “Think it’s broken?” He asked quietly, gently tracing his finger around the shoulder socket in case of a dislocation he’d missed.
It was just him and Tony.
But suddenly Tony seemed to snap out of himself, throwing his body sideways and taking cover behind a car just at the same time Steve skidded to a halt and met him, arms coming up and throwing themselves in a protective shield over Tony’s body. The shooter was shouting something garbled and desperate from across the street, but that wasn’t Steve’s immediate concern. He grabbed Tony’s shoulders, a hand going to cup the man’s face. “Did he hit you?” He blurted urgently, tongue thick, panic-stricken. Tony had just been
“I could probably get a good idea,” Steve said, looking down at his feet as his hand rested against the car roof, “I’m just the stupid new kid who you keep having to pull out of trouble,” he muttered.
Now all he needed to do was beat Thanos, take the gauntlet, bring back the rest of the universe, and everything would be fine.
Tony gagged again, turning to Steve in horror. “I
Steve grinned, holding up his finger in the silent request for
So yeah- Steve may have been sporting a bust up lip and a slight concussion after getting shoved into the tiles on the wall, but it was worth it. And that’s exactly what he’d tell the principal when he asked. And Bucky when he asked. And mom when sh-
Rumlow’s voice jeered at Rogers, as the camera—or, what Fury was assuming to be Iron Man’s faceplate— came closer.
“Bertha.”
Of course it had. Because that was just the sort of thing Tony had to think about; whether he’d have a home tomorrow, or next week, or whenever he and his dad had their next fight.
A short pause, and then “afraid not.”
But Bruce didn’t need to speak for Steve to know. It was written all over his face, buried underneath the sadness in his eyes.
“And that is not going to happen,” Natasha finished evenly, propping herself up and then reaching over for the small pile of nutrient bars that they had. She ripped the wrapper off and then broke off a chunk, then held it up to his mouth. “Eat.”
“Well that just shows a disturbing lack of imagination. I think I may have to take back my previous offer of marriage.”
“I don’t care,” Steve made his feet take steps. They brought him to the door. “I just need you to tell them I am at home. That’s an order.”
The boy nodded. “She’s bringing Carol and her boyfriend James over, too. You up for socialising?”
This was not another universe.
Steve smiled and sat gingerly down on the bed, making sure not to jostle Tony as he got comfy. Tony himself was pretty restricted- no shuffling down and curling up into Steve’s chest like he usually did, thanks to the massive cast on his damned leg- but he made sure to give Steve his best smile and then lean his head into Steve’s shoulder once they got within touching distance. “This… this is okay, right?” He asked, before biting the bullet and finishing with
"Well, we've already reached one developmental milestone tonight," he said as he slipped into bed next to Steve and handed him the note, "seems that we've got a name."
Oh yeah. Maybe because it was the boy he loved, and he was in this position because of Steve.
“Come on, Steve, this is
Tony stilled. “I don’t have-“
“Is that…” Steve swallowed and dipped his head closer, brushing up against Tony’s nervously, “is that such a bad thing?”
"I don't know what the context is, but I hear Clint's shins are going to be removed and I'd just like to say I'm in favour," Sam slid into the seat next to Steve and opened up his lunch. When he looked at Steve, he wordlessly handed over a cookie. Not even willing to politely argue, Steve just mumbled his thanks and then shoved it all in his mouth at once.
“Hey, who’s this guy?” Steve turned to the boy speaking, smiling tightly up at him and extending a hand automatically. The boy shook it, although looked at him a little strangely. Probably wasn’t used to kids doing that- he figured it was probably considered old-fashioned.
Steve shut his eyes, tipping his head forward into Tony’s. This was… big. Bigger than any other chance they’d had before. Tony had worked it out now, and all they had to do was act on it. Try. Do better than last time, do something that might actually bring everyone back.
“Haven’t I?” Tony checked his watch in surprise, and then gave a small nod. “You know, I
Steve broke it.
“Longer than you,” Tony gritted, snapping out his wrist in a motion that unsheathed the blade hidden under his forearm. He twisted it backward and the man had to let go of him as he stumbled away from the attack, and Tony scrabbled for the release on the helmet before the boiling plates could do any more damage to his neck. He really hoped any burns he’d gotten were only first-degree.
“I’m sorry,” Steve mumbled, kissing Tony’s throat tentatively, “I just- I’m good at always thinking the worst. Character flaw, I’ll admit.”
“I…uh, remember we had- uh- plans? Your big party at the tower! and then you and me were going to catch a movie afterward? I don’t… I mean, obviously, you’ve got other plans, and that’s fine, I don’t mind, honestly,” Tony assured him, blustering around back and forth between his two feet and generally looking like he’d rather be anywhere else than in Steve’s room.
“Tony—”
A hand fell softly onto his fist, small and warm. Steve looked sideways at Natasha and tried to copy her smile, but it fell flat. “I need him to come home, Nat,” he choked, “I don’t… this is the only thing I have even the faintest of hope in. Even if it’s unfounded. Even if I know deep down that you’re probably…” He looked away and shut his eyes. Not thinking about that. Absolutely not. “I just have to hold onto this. I have to.”
“Hey, dude, you passed my test,” Bucky butted in with a shrug of his own, leaning over to them both, “anyone who’s as absolutely willing as you were to start fighting the moment they thought Steve’d been wronged in any way is my type’a person.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Everything and anything. For Tony, Steve would do everything and anything.
“Hey, you chose to do this in the communal room, your fault,” Clint said, before waving them away, “now shoo- go have your way with him or whatever, Steve- I don’t want to see any more of this here, I’m eating my cereal.”
