“No sense of humor,” Simon tsked with a teasing smile. Then he sighed and shrugged. “Oh well. The Order of the Cenophus wants you, you want to know why. And you want to know the connections to the Unsound and the shadow men. I have the answers.”
“You still want to do this, yeah?” John stood and walked over to sit on the coffee table. He put a hand on Sherlock’s head. “Whatever you want to do, I’m with you.”
He nodded, and Sherlock continued snapping pictures. Sherlock asked a few more questions, then they went back to talk to Simon, who had finished his therapy session.
“And was it?” John was talking to his third subject, Philip Anderson, when the man mentioned Sherlock Holmes, and in that same annoyed tone as the other two investigators had. And if the developing pattern held true, then there was good reason that Holmes had “thrown a wobbly.” He might be an arrogant prat, but he seemed to know what he was talking about.
He walked over and shrugged on his long coat, his large hand slicking back his hair before setting his tall hat on his head. He pulled John’s coat off the rack and held it out for him.
On the fourth day, his fever spiked and he began to wheeze. John extracted a sample of sputum from his lung, and Felipe confirmed under Sherlock’s microscope that he had indeed developed pneumonia.
“Sherlock,” John whimpered desperately. He closed his eyes, but Sherlock had seen the shame in them.  It shattered his heart into pieces.
“What, John? What? Pray tell, what is it I'm doing to you that is soooo terrible?” Sherlock howled. He threw his arms out, mocking him.
“I did not wish to pull you away from your holiday, but a very delicate matter has come to my attention that you will undoubtedly be playing quite a role in unraveling.”
Disclaimer: Colby Keller is American and from what I can tell is nothing like Raibert MacDougal in real life. Raibert is a selfish arse where Colby seems like an upstanding, smart, sweet man. Colby is also an artist and his work kicks ass.
John watched him from the tub as he finished drying himself. He began to walk out of the room, when John asked him where he was going.
“There’s something I didn’t mention in my letters,” he said. “William’s tried to kill himself. Twice.”
Sherlock stirred minutes later, rubbing his hard, naked body against John’s backside. He pulled John’s back to his chest and kissed his bare shoulder.
“Oh God Sherlock, don’t let me hurt you,” John pleaded, his hips already betraying him, snapping against Sherlock’s body.
“I don't know,” said John. “Maybe it wasn't you that made a mistake. Maybe someone else recognized you?”
Sherlock crawled on top of him, and Raibert slicked his fingertips up with lubricant and again pressed into Shelrock’s tight arsehole. He heard the condom unwrap, heard Raibert say his name.
His mother’s breath became more labored and she began to wheeze. Her body shook as she began to draw for breath.
“Thank you, Victor,” said Sherlock, brushing past him and intentionally rubbing his shoulder with his own.
“I took on a fake identity in Turkmenia,” said Sherlock, slipping the new books behind the old. “Befriended those on both sides, locals and the Russians. The Russian army already had a presence in the area, but the fighting started when the locals banded together to push them out. I fed information to the British forces stationed in Kabul. I speak Russian, Turkmen and Pashto fluently now.” He stopped and said out loud to himself,  “I haven’t told anyone that. Not even Mycroft.”
John was grateful the innkeeper had followed them. He was able to interpret her condition for him, and he realized within minutes that the woman needed emergency surgery to save both her and the baby.
Sherlock smiled back, genuinely pleased. “Tell me the story of how you met. He never told me details.”
“Where is he?” John seethed. He gripped the strangler’s collar lifted him off the ground, shaking him so hard his teeth rattled.
He was going to go back to Spain, to the vineyard. Right after they closed the serial killer case. Then John would pack up and leave and never come back.
His phone was filled with texts and voicemails he hadn’t answered. He knew it wouldn’t be long before someone roused him out of bed. But he wasn’t going anywhere. He was never leaving the Sliver again.
He cried out, the burning pressure overwhelming at first. John coaxed him through it, told him to hold still and let himself adjust. Slowly, the majority of the burning went away, and he was left with a dull, tolerable ache. He dared to move his hips very slowly, then gingerly up and down over John's thighs.
"Oh this is going to be glorious" said Wiggins, rubbing his hands together, whether in eagerness or because of the cold, Sherlock couldn't tell.
Despite Sherlock’s insistence that he didn't hike, they had spent much of the last month doing just that. They had walked everywhere, breathing in the fresh air and finally talking about everything. John had read Sherlock’s letters twice more, and then they had read both sets together, in order. Everything was far from perfect--they were doing their best, but they were still two British men unaccustomed to analytic personal discussion at the level their relationship required. For the first time since the day they met, however, they were being completely honest with one another. It would be enough.
Sherlock stepped in closer, the timbre of his voice lowering. “You certainly seemed to enjoy it when--”
“Because I've also deduced which choice you would make, and I've been right every time. It will not help either of us to have this conversation. Please just go home, John.”
John had imagined this very moment so many times--Sherlock, naked and willing, spread out beneath him--but nothing could have prepared him for the reality of how gorgeous Sherlock was like this. The morning sun lit him perfectly and he was all creamy skin and long limbs and hard cock bobbing against his stomach, and he was gazing up at John with so much love and desire that John felt his eyes prickle. He reached a hand out and stroked down his cheek, and Sherlock leaned into the gentle caress immediately, his lips curving into a smile.
And so begins one of the oddest days of John’s life. Sherlock is extraordinarily good company but steadfastly ignores any hints John drops about fancying a nap. They go from an excellent Mediterranean breakfast to a private walking tour of an exhibit of historic medical oddities at the V&A. They lunch at a hole in the wall ramen place where Sherlock orders a massive meal in flawless Japanese and gets them both tipsy on afternoon sake. Then they go to a double feature, of all things--two Hitchcock films--before finishing up the day with a late dinner and drinks at a pub so small and cramped John can't believe Sherlock can fit his legs under the table. They laugh and talk of nothing in particular, and when they finally return to Baker Street just after midnight, John is completely exhausted and a little befuddled, but happy. He's only been back at 221B for six weeks, and there's been more than a handful of awkward moments as he and Sherlock adjust to living together again. Today had been the first day things truly felt right again, he reflects, as he thanks Sherlock and wearily turns toward the stairs. He realizes that for once, he hasn’t thought about Mary or the baby once that day.
Sherlock ducked completely under the spray as John entered the shower, so he was greeted by the breathtaking sight of water sluicing down all of that gloriously creamy skin. As soon as their eyes met, however, Sherlock stepped forward and took John’s face in his hands. “You've been crying again.”
London. He spent days walking for hours at a time, past old crime scenes and alleys they’d sprinted down and the doors of favorite restaurants; through museums and under bridges and across parks. He wasn’t sure when he’d be back. Couldn’t imagine living in a London where Sherlock lived but not having Sherlock in his life. He thought about the awful beige days in the horrible post-Army bedsit. He thought about the long black years after the Fall, when the colors and lines of the city first lost their sharpness and then faded around the edges and into the darkness he'd been drowning in. He thought about the many gray months when he’d been living with Mary, when he didn’t text Sherlock or call him for long periods of time, taking their friendship for granted. He thought about the wasted days of anger, and the long years of denial. He thought about mourning and loving and raging and hating and laughing and saving and
“There was a serial murder case that took up most of November,” Sherlock said, thankfully coming to his rescue. “Early in December, Mummy had a benign tumor removed from her lung, and I didn’t want to go too far away until she had recovered. That took me to about a week and a half ago, and I started to...second guess myself.”
Last Tuesday they'd both fallen asleep on the couch during Ripper Street, which was an accomplishment on John’s part. With Sherlock ranting either about the historical inaccuracies (“even an idiot knows there were no amphetamines in the 1800’s”) or the poor quality of the crime solving (“John, with that much physical evidence even you would have been able to solve the crime without resorting to torturing the suspect”), it was hard to pay attention to the show, let alone doze off during it. He'd woken hours later to find the TV still on (that Victorian railroad show Sherlock liked was on) and Sherlock curled up beside him, with his head in John’s lap. John had looked down and felt such a wave of overwhelming fondness that the only thing he could do was close his eyes and go back to sleep.
Henry the postman. A tall, curly-headed man who was only made more gorgeous by the snowflakes twinkling in his hair and flush of cold on his high cheekbones. A tall, curly-headed man who was looking at John, who was looking back, aware that his mouth had dropped open.
Sherlock shivered involuntarily at the low rasp of John’s voice, arching his back as a firm hand smoothed down his spine. He opened his mouth to answer, but let out a sharp cry instead as John’s hand lifted and came down, hard, on the left side of his arse.
There is no dramatic moment. No one is leaving; no one is dying; no one is marrying anyone else. Later, when asked how it happens, it is not a story that will embarrass either of them to tell. It is, in fact, barely a story at all.
Mycroft picked up a small pile of envelopes from the seat next to him and passed them over to John, who took them without thinking. "Pick one.” It wasn't a request. “I'll make the arrangements. Leave my brother with the only things he has left: his work, and his home."
. I do not choose to work at anything I do not feel is worth it, which I think you know,” Sherlock said. “And I believe if the last year has proven anything, it is that for me, there is no ‘moving on’ from you. But you, John...you
Another pause, and then another nod. “Not...all. But I’ll email you a few.” He slid off the stool and moved toward the door. “Thank you, Molly,” he said, not turning back around.
“Whatever sort it is, you built it. And then you made more plans, and were ready to make those real as well.”
“Your mouth needs its own warning label,” John said some time later, when they’d made it back to the bed, dry, dressed in pajamas, and (momentarily) sated. Sherlock, smiling a little, fussed with the pillows behind them so they were both propped partially upright. He reached out for John's hand and twined their fingers together, and then the smile faded.
Mycroft Holmes wasn’t often welcome at Baker Street, but that never stopped him from intruding whenever needs must. Usually Sherlock was aware of his presence the moment he opened the front door, greeting him with some sort of shouted insult before he’d even begun to ascend the staircase to the flat. The silence that hit him was unsurprising given recent events, and he had no idea what sort of reception was awaiting him at the top of the stairs.
They walked back to the house with their hands tucked into their pockets, each lost in his own thoughts, in his own mix of certainty and fear. Sherlock crowded John into the door as he wrestled the lock open, and barely let him over the threshold before he had engulfed him in a tight embrace.
“I wasn't considering that, but you were still panicking over my arrival not two hours ago. I think you have at least a small amount of doubt as well. I believe it might be easier for us to begin this in a place where we have no history. Perhaps an unfamiliar location will help us to concentrate on making sure this is what we want.”
It was long moments before they had recovered enough to pick up where they left off, but this time, when Sherlock sank to his knees, John pushed his fingers through the wet curls and just hung on.
As the officers of the Met looked on, Sherlock looked down at what he'd gotten from Sally in the party gift swap, a perplexed look on his face. “Thank you, Sally, for the…” his voice trailed off. Everyone looked at him, incredulous.
Greg held his hands up in surrender. “Okay. Okay. If you need--if there’s anything--you know where to find me, yeah? Send me a text and I’ll come as soon as I can.”
“Dodged a bullet, you did,” Greg grinned at her, nudging her with his elbow. “I mean, it can’t be a picnic, living with that brain and that mouth all the time.” A shout of some kind came through the door, followed by a series of lower sounds. “Wait. Molly, was that--”
bed--and knowing no matter what else the day would bring, be it good or horrible, that he would love and be loved by this man.
He hovered at the top of Sherlock’s prick, tonguing at the slit and the edges of the foreskin until Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down at him. Only then did he lick a long, wet stripe up the side, grinning as Sherlock’s back arched again and his mouth fell open in a moan. John held his gaze while he flattened himself on his stomach and slipped his hands underneath Sherlock’s arse. He nudged Sherlock’s thighs open farther with his head, and then let his intention show on his face as he nudged again, encouraging his thighs wider. Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise, and then John’s hands tilted his arse up further and he flicked his tongue lightly over Sherlock’s entrance.
Molly wasn’t surprised to push open the doors to the morgue at 6 o’clock in the morning and find Sherlock slumped over a table, his legs tangled around his stool and his head pillowed on his arms. It had been almost a month since she’d seen him, and she knew from Greg that he hadn’t been taking many cases. She could also see for herself that Greg’s observations about Sherlock’s health had been correct - the detective looked terrible, even in sleep.  Her normal inclination would be to leave him there, but she had a group of students coming in for a rotation at 7 and she needed to prepare. She shook his shoulder gently and then harder when he didn't respond. “Sherlock.
“And if it doesn’t…” John’s voice trailed off and he swallowed, hard. “Yes. Alright. We’ll take the month.”
A reminder: there will be no new chapter tomorrow. This fic will be complete after this weekend, with chapter 11 going up sometime on Saturday and the epilogue following on Sunday.
“Mycroft will. He’ll fix it. They take volunteers for smaller periods of time; you can do it in a year or two if you still want to, but John. You cannot go to Africa.” Sherlock’s hands were tight on John’s shoulders, and one finger was digging a little too deeply into his scar. He grimaced, and Sherlock loosened his grip a little, though he didn't let go completely. “I'm asking you not to go. I'm a selfish prick, John. The world has plenty of doctors and I only have one you.”
“Stop thinking so loudly, John; the semen you deposited all over my stomach has congealed and it’s quite unpleasant.”
“Don’t be an idiot, John,” Sherlock said, eyes still closed. John moved closer until his body was pressed to Sherlock’s, and then two long arms pulled him still closer. “I missed you.”
“I thought it prudent to remove the means from your possession in case the temptation overcame your better angels.”
Another sip of tea. “Very little; thank you for asking. I’ve got an ongoing experiment about the deterioration rate of--”
“I'll call Mycroft the day after Christmas,” John said quietly, stepping even closer to Sherlock and turning his face up. “I want to come home.”
John opened his mouth to answer, and then closed it again, all the fight draining out of him. “I know. Fuck, Greg, I know. I know he has.” He sat for a long moment, tracing the condensation on his glass. “It took me a long time to figure it out. Not just me, but...him. I didn’t know. For so long. He’s always called me an idiot, and he’s right.”
The vehemence of Greg’s response had John’s head snapping back up. “I’m not moving back to Baker Street, I’m moving to Ireland. For a year, anyway, and then after that, I’ll see. I fucked it up. Sherlock got tired of waiting. Can you blame him?”
John shifted uneasily in his arms, but stilled again when Sherlock stroked his back a little more firmly. “What changed?”
Somehow, finally, Sherlock had deduced it. He'd anticipated why John was there and was trying to save them both from the inevitable British awkwardness that was about to follow. But John Watson was no coward, and it had taken him a long time to get to this point, and damn it, he wanted to be able to see Sherlock when he told the detective he loved him.
Sherlock himself looked thinner than Mycroft could remember seeing him in a long time. Even in a fully reclined state his thin cotton pajama pants hung off his hips. His knees jutted out at sharp angles, and the veins on the back of his hands were more visible than ever, the pale skin stretched over them tightly. Sleep had done little to relax Sherlock’s face, and a deep furrow bisected the skin between his eyebrows. The urge to reach out and stroke it away was overwhelming, so instead Mycroft looked away toward the kitchen briefly before settling his eyes once more on his brother.
There was a hesitation, and then: “No.” And then, before John could say anything else: “I believe we may have each made an error, Doctor Watson.”
John dragged his cock over Sherlock’s mouth once more and then shoved in, hard. Sherlock moaned, long and low, and John chuckled as he felt the head bump against the back of Sherlock’s throat. “Fuck, love, you’re gagging for it, aren’t you?” Sherlock moaned again, and John took his hand off his shaft and fisted it in the other side of the mass of curls. “Hands behind your back,” John snapped, and, as Sherlock quickly obeyed, John began to fuck his mouth in smooth, sure strokes. A choked moan came from Sherlock every time John hit the back of his throat, and soon tears were forming in the corners of his eyes.
in the furthest point southwest in Ireland. They don't allow tour buses on the peninsula, so it is quiet and rugged and windswept and wonderful. I think about going back there all the time. I have borrowed liberally from the town and peninsula for this story.
Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s back, tentatively at first, then with more surety as John holds on. They stand there embracing in the darkened sitting room, and after several minutes, John chuckles into his shoulder.
There would be more, very soon. There would be the shattering of walls, and the crashing of resistance, and the sighs of contentment. But right now there were just two hearts and two hands softly brushing against one another in the pale London morning, while all around them a city began its day, never knowing that within the four walls of one flat the entire world was different.
Sherlock was impatiently rocking back and forth on his feet in front of the window when the cab finally pulled up to the curb. He watched John get out, watched the cabbie help him lift two suitcases to the ground, and watched John shoulder a large backpack (green, left over from his Army days) as the cab pulled away. He should go down and help; that’s what people did. At the very least he should open the door, even though John still had his keys. Or maybe he should just wait in the flat, ready to welcome John home with all the unfamiliar giddiness that was coursing through him.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but John could see the hope and fear warring in his eyes. “That’s your deduction?”
He stirred, mumbling something she couldn't hear and turning his face into the crook of his arm. One eyes cracked open and, after a moment, focused on her. When it did, he sat up quickly. “Molly. What time is it?” His eyes flicked upward to the clock on the wall instead of waiting for an answer. “I didn't mean to fall asleep. I was out walking last night and ended up here. I was just…”
“So did I,” John said before he could stop himself, and he could hear the bitterness lacing his words. “I--Sherlock--
By 8 am they've received their lecture, given their statements, filled out their paperwork and handed a check by the sour-faced accounts payable clerk. Yawning, John walks out of the Met behind Sherlock, who hails a cab with his usual ease. He is surprised, however, when Sherlock gives a strange address instead of directing the driver to take them home.
Molly waved a hand in the air. “He’s gay. Picking the gay ones seems to be my thing. I had a good cry when I found out and then did my best to get over myself.”
“If we go back together, I need us to be sure. I believe that I--we--need more than a handful of hours together before we try to return to our old life. It has been a very long time since we were in that life, John. It has been a full year since we were in
Maeve looked from one to the other, and a smile began to spread over her face. “John, dear, is this your young man?”
Sherlock nodded, no longer meeting his eyes, and after another long silence, Greg made his way to the door and away from Baker Street.
Greg’s head swiveled left to take in the kitchen table, empty but for a small bowl of fruit, and the counters, devoid of anything that wasn't related to the preparation and consumption of food. Sherlock stood by the sink, a mug in his hands.
John thanked him and stared at the letter critically. Mailed from the U.K. He opened it up carefully and noted the thick, creamy stationary.
John had never felt so vulnerable, yet so powerful and desired. He felt safe and protected in Felipe’s arms. He knew he would always be safe with him. He would take care of him and love him. The day he’d met the Spaniard he’d fallen head over heels. Dr. Felipe Canales was the living, breathing example of everything John had ever desired.
“I...wasn’t sure how long I’d be staying,” Sherlock said quietly. “I didn’t know what to bring, and Lestrade kept yelling at me to pack and then threatening to pack for me, and I ended up just waiting until he fell asleep and then heading for the airport.” He sighed. “I suppose it was nice enough of my brother to do that, although the idea of Anthea pawing through my sock index is abhorrent.”
Sherlock slid his hands down to John’s shoulders and pulled him closer. “‘I have never loved, nor will I ever love, anyone or anything as much as I love you,’” he quoted, his voice very low.
John let himself into the flat and took the stairs two at a time, his heart pounding. There was no greeting as he swung the door open, but he saw Sherlock’s coat hanging up as he stripped his off. “Sherlock?” He hung up his jacket next to the Belstaff and craned his neck to peer into the kitchen.
Except of course Sherlock knows a back way into this museum, has figured out how to jimmy the lock to a sanitation closet that has both an outside wall and an air duct just big enough to crawl through if you're either a lanky consulting detective or a doctor who hasn't been eating enough as of late. By 4:30 Sherlock is cradling a bruised face while John sits on the suspect, knowing that the tripped alarm will bring Lestrade and his raised voice soon enough.
"I need--" his voice cracked, and he stopped and tried to take a deep breath. "Can I have some time? To think about it?"
“He thought he heard a knock at the door and he’s gone to answer it. I'm guessing it's Henry, and if I know Bertie, he’ll make him come in for a cuppa before finishing the route.” Maeve tilted her ear toward the door that connected the cozy back sitting room to the rest of the house. “Yes, I definitely hear two voices. John, if you’ll take that tray through to the kitchen and--”
Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. “John. I need. Please. Turn around, go home, and come back tomorrow. Come back tomorrow, after you've slept and realized your mistake. Just don't--”
I am pretty sure the tags will be updating daily, now; please continue to check them for anything that might concern you.
“Thank you,” John says, pushing his face into Sherlock’s neck, brushing a kiss there, and holding on. It feels like a promise, and a beginning, and a confirmation, and it's all that's necessary in that moment. “Thank you.”
Something--not a laugh, not a sob--broke free from John’s throat. Hysteria was building. It would burst from him eventually, and he began to silently promise the universe anything it wanted if he could just hold the explosion back until he was alone. “No. It didn’t go well.”
.” The word was a quiet hiss in the room, and the two just stared at each other for a long moment before Sherlock spoke again. “I know Mycroft told you I’ve decided to receive no knowledge based on any foreign surveillance he may have set up. Please honor that wish.”
To John’s shock, Sherlock’s voice broke, and he took a few shaky breaths before turning back to meet John's gaze. "I thought I could wait forever. I thought I would always trust you. But I couldn't, and I can't. Not with this. I have died for loving you, and I have killed for loving you, and it's gotten me here.
Then John let out a low, humorless chuckle, and Sherlock’s pulse skyrocketed. It had been an even worse day than he'd deduced, then. He knew exactly what John needed, and he rolled over onto his back, reaching up and holding onto the bed rails. As John--pupils blown wide, jaw set--made quick work of knotting the ropes around Sherlock’s wrists, Sherlock stretched his neck out in a gesture of submission, his eyes hungrily roaming the length of John’s body before settling on his rapidly swelling cock.
“If you're quite done fellating the scenery, perhaps we could get back to Sligo in time for an early dinner?”
Bored Sherlock had appeared from time to time, but between the sightseeing and the sex, they seemed to keep busy enough for him. He’d stopped an animal smuggling operation in the making at the Fota Wildlife Park early in their trip, but had waved off John’s suggestion that they let the various local police departments know of their presence. He was content on this holiday--they both were--and he had made sure John knew it. Slowly, any worry that Sherlock might eventually grow bored of him faded.
Greg stared back at him, disbelief still flashing in his eyes, but his mouth softened. “Let me talk to him.”
It had been almost two weeks since he’d seen Sherlock, and the last time had been in dim light; they'd been investigating a murder in an alley behind a florist’s, and Sherlock hadn't needed to come by the Yard after. The light in 221B showed Greg everything he'd missed seeing then--skin paler than usual; hands thinner than usual. Shadows under the eyes that looked more like bruises; hair absent its usual product and care.
John had been a surgeon; he knew the human heart couldn’t actually wither inside your chest. He wondered if his heart knew it. “Are you sure?” He rasped, barely audible. He felt, rather than saw, Sherlock’s immediate, infinitesimal nod.
Sherlock’s heels were shoving at his arse, not-so-subtly encouraging him to pick up speed, and John took the hint and began to thrust in earnest. Sherlock fucked John’s mouth with his tongue as John fucked into his body, and his hips rose to meet John’s with every thrust. Something primal and raw seemed to overtake them both, and John was only barely aware that the headboard was slamming into the wall with the force of his thrusts and that Sherlock had shoved a hand between them and was frantically pulling himself off. Their mouths were still pressed together but they were only gasping now, and then Sherlock cried out suddenly, his back arching impossibly higher as he came between their stomachs. As Sherlock’s muscles clamped down around John’s cock his thrusts became shallower and more erratic, until he was following Sherlock over the edge, shouting his name as he spilled into the condom.
Five minutes after arriving at the scene, Sherlock was already rolling his eyes and insulting the team. “Lestrade, if you wanted to see us, you could have come up with a better excuse than this.”
He watched John slip his hand into his pocket and pull out his phone, and seconds later, Sherlock’s phone was ringing.
John reflected on these two prior incidents when he woke up in his bed a week later with Sherlock’s body sprawled half on top of his, legs and arms everywhere like an octopus had wandered in through the window seeking refuge. He might buy that this too was just an accident if he hadn't gone to sleep in a bed that contained zero Sherlocks and woken up with one Sherlock twined around him like an invasive vine.
John felt Sherlock begin to go to his knees, and he scrabbled at his elbows to bring him back up. “You don't have to--”
John didn't miss a step while looking over at him incredulously. “Sherlock, you were often an insufferable prick, and I've loved you for years. Do you think I expect you to be different now that we've both said it?”
"I've warned my brother time and again that caring is a liability. Letting people get close to you ultimately brings nothing but pain."
“Alas, there’s only one genius in this house,” John sighed, and slid from the bed to take care of it. In the en suite, he stood in front of the mirror for a long moment, examining his face. Seeing what Sherlock was seeing. He was still too thin (though Sherlock made him look positively robust; clearly their time apart had been a strain on him as well). His hair was more silver, his wrinkles deeper. But his skin had a healthy glow to it, thanks to all the time he and Einstein spent outside, and his eyes...didn’t seem as dead to him as they had for so long.
“You’re afraid to trust them.” He hesitated, and then nodded, and she took a deep breath and squeezed his hand to stall for time. Somehow he had trusted her enough to bring this to her, even though he knew she hardly had a stellar track record in this area herself. If she didn’t distinctly remember waking up, eating breakfast, and taking the Tube to work, she would think that she was still dreaming. She didn’t want to give him the wrong advice. “Do you want me to take a look and let you know what I think?”
He ignored Sherlock’s cock then in favor of deep, filthy, spit-slick kisses against his hole, his tongue teasing it open slowly until he could dip inside. He'd done this to a couple of his more adventurous girlfriends at their request, and enjoyed it because they enjoyed it, but in this moment he'd be willing to admit to anyone that licking Sherlock Holmes’s arsehole was about the hottest thing he'd ever done in his life. His hips were involuntarily thrusting against the bed, and he was certain he could make both of them come this way. But then there was a grip in his hair, and a tug, and an urgent grunt, and he reluctantly left off and raised his head.
“MOLLY.” Greg leaped up, shooting Molly--who was now laying back on the bed, her whole body shaking, her hands clasped over her mouth to muffle her laughter--an aggrieved look before kneeling down on the floor and poking around under the bed. After a minute or so, he pulled something out into the open.
Sherlock let out a huff that was meant to sound annoyed, but didn’t quite make it. “Molly yelled at me when I showed up at the morgue several days ago, and then she texted Lestrade, who sent me an increasingly unhinged series of messages, which I ignored. But then he just showed up and yanked my suitcase out of the wardrobe and sat on the couch and refused to leave until I agreed to come. That was last night.”
He wasn't terrified to be in love with Mary, because he wasn't. Not really. He loved the idea of her, and the tidy future she promised him, and the fact that being with her didn't terrify him in the least.
Behind Lestrade, Donovan started to complain under her breath to Hopkins. “This is your fault, Sally, so keep your comments to yourself.” Lestrade glared at her before turning back to Sherlock. “Tell me what you know and then don't do this at a crime scene again.”
“I was already up here when you sent them,” he said, breath hitching as John ran his fingernails over the reddened flesh. “Didn't feel like moving.” The carelessness of his tone belied the racing of his heart. There was no predicting what John might do when this mood came over him.
John ran a hand through his hair, looking around on the floor for his pants. “I can't exactly make you scream at Maeve and Bertie’s, love; the walls in those cottages are thin, and while I know they're on board with this relationship, I don't want to scandalize them. It'll be a couple of days before I can really touch you again.”
, and what could he say to that? What counterargument did he have that was worth anything? Sherlock had come back for him--twice--and John had given him nothing but pain in return. And now that he was ready--eager--
Before they'd even left on their Irish holiday, Sherlock and John had already had one another in all the ways John had imagined in his letters, and had moved on to experimenting with new ones. Sherlock had a very slight preference for being the penetrated partner, but they both had given and received many times by that point. They had made love in antique four-poster beds, narrow motel twins, and an extremely uncomfortable Swedish-make bed that Sherlock had told the clerk at checkout to repurpose as kindling. They’d fucked in three oversized showers (and only fallen down in one), and had a frantic mutual wank session in a hot tub. John had bent Sherlock over desks and sinks and ridden him slow and silent one glorious afternoon in the most fussy toile covered armchair either of them had ever seen. After being forced to take impromptu shelter in a gazebo during a torrential downpour, they’d frotted on the floor until they both came in their pants.
Her voice was stopped short by the sound of the tray slipping from John’s suddenly numb fingers and hitting the floor. Bertie had opened the sitting room door and was ushering in a man: a tall, curly-headed man in a long dark coat who was most definitely
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “You can't be serious.” By way of answer, John grabbed Sherlock’s trousers from the floor and tossed them at him.
he thought, and then he repeated the thought out loud. “I came here tonight to tell you something, and I think we both need me to.”
Lestrade sighed. “Yeah you do. That’s not it. What is it? Is it still the whole ‘not gay’ thing? Because...just...stop hiding behind the bullshit. Either go be with him, or don’t, but either way, he deserves to know. He’s been waiting for you long enough.”
John gave him a small, rueful smile. “My track record isn't exactly stellar either.” His eyes drifted down to the spot on Sherlock’s chest where proof of that would never disappear.
Finally Sherlock met his eyes again. “Tell Mycroft I’m fine, Lestrade. Why he cannot deduce this himself, I do not know. I have left his latest surveillance cameras untouched. I am keeping to a fairly regular schedule. He’s had the flat searched so he knows I’m not in possession of any illegal substances. If you’d like to stay, I’m planning on ordering Chinese takeaway in a little while and some company would not be unpleasant. However, you’d need to cancel your evening with your children, and surely that is more important than staying here to make sure I am not overly despondent about the departure of my flatmate.”
John just stood back muttering about overinflated egos and delusions of grandeur, watching in disbelief as Sherlock greeted young women and men with cartoon hearts in their eyes (some wearing deerstalkers), signed copies of newspaper articles they thrust at him, and, wearing his most insincere smile...posed for selfies.
“It's a five at best, John,” Sherlock drawled, shaking the Ball lazily. “Is this case worth leaving the flat for?”
Sherlock’s eyes were blazing, and his cock had smeared pre-come all over his stomach, and he gestured frantically toward the bedside table with his chin. John saw the lube and condom he'd somehow gotten out of the drawer, and swallowed hard.
Hope everything’s well on the Emerald Isle. Those Instagram shots of the gloomy sea are starting to give me seasonal affective disorder by proxy, I think. You ever consider getting one of those full-spectrum lights? Hopkins swears by his.
Eventually, though, the plates were set aside and they both grew steadily more quiet. Sherlock was refilling their wine glasses when John finally took a deep breath and asked:
And so we have come to the end. This is more of a last chapter with the teeeeeeniest epilogue at the very end. I am so floored and flummoxed and flattered by your kudos and comments and links and reblogs. I got so behind on the comments but I am trying to catch up, at least with the latest ones, but I need you to know how much they have meant to me. This was my first long foray into this fandom, and it has been such a good one. I feel very fortunate to have had this experience.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but obediently took out his phone and made a show of deleting the app with a flourish.
"Catch up," Greg said, shoving a full pint across the table at John before draining his first and reaching for the next. John took a long pull of the lager gratefully before eyeing Greg up, gritting his teeth, and diving in.
“This was the last thing on our Northern Ireland list,” Sherlock said. “What would you like to do now?”
It wasn't immediately obvious. After all, they'd shared a bed--or a couch, or a set of stairs, or a jail cell, or on one memorable occasion a (thankfully disabled) walk-in freezer--many times over the course of their friendship. They needed to sleep (well, John needed to sleep), and sometimes, there just wasn't a lot of space available. So they'd shared, sometimes.
John again tried to protest, but Jean was stubborn. John took another look around. He knew he could do it. If it didn’t work out, well, he was out nothing.
An hour later, both young men were still naked, now lying on the couch and eating noodles. The sun had set and the room was dark, save for a small lit lamp on the desk. Sherlock was half on John’s chest, his impossibly long legs stretched over the end of the couch.
Felipe gasped and clenched tightly around his length. John calmed him with soothing words and hands. Once relaxed, he carefully pulled out.
“It’s my geography lesson,” he replied. “I am reading about a place called the desert where people live in tents and ride camels.” John stopped and thought for a moment. “Mr Thomas, what’s a camel look like?”
His voice startled Sherlock, who quickly turned and began coughing. He finally got a hold of himself and said, “What time is it?”
“South Africa, yes. When do we leave?” He managed to sound indifferent, though his heart was pounding with excitement.
The comment rendered John momentarily speechless, not just because of its perceptiveness, but in the tenderness in which William uttered the words.
"Promise me," John said seriously. "Never find yourself alone with him. If you do, leave immediately."
John was relieved beyond words when Agnes took care of all of the arrangements. After the funeral, he helped her pack up her older sister’s belongings.
The timing was, for once, fortuitous. It was John’s turn to take holiday, and Easter was upon them.  John was absolutely giddy with excitement, knowing he would see Sherlock soon. His step had a bit more pep during rounds as he chatted with with colleagues and patients.
“It is,” answered John. “But it’s a bit chilly right now. I’d suggest your heavier coat until the frost melts.”
Upon seeing the lush green of England, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. The air was cooler and humid and felt glorious against his weathered, sun-kissed skin. Once docked and on shore, he resisted the urge to kiss the ground. John loaded their luggage onto the carriage and they left for Cornwall.
The Spaniard looked tired and frankly, furious. But he still cracked a smile upon laying eyes on John.
Instead, he hurled it across the room into the wall. The heavy container punctured the wallpaper and landed with a thud on the floor.
William nodded and swallowed loudly, his eyes falling shut. “I pretended it was me coaxing those moans from your lips, that it was my name you were shouting in pleasure.” He exhaled. “I touched myself for the first time that night. I hadn’t realize...I didn’t know it could be like that.”
John felt his face go hot at the compliment. Tears unexpectedly welled up in his eyes, but he quickly wiped the wetness away before any drops could fall.
Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck as he felt warm lips pressed tenderly against his temple. Sherlock was beginning to understand that John wasn't anything at all like his former lover; the one who had taught him all those tricks with his mouth and throat, all those sessions of getting it just right, over and over again. The only release Sherlock had ever received was by his own hand. Sebastian Wilkes had never touched him in tenderness, never kissed his forehead, never stroked his chest. John had done all three in the last few hours, on their first date no less. Sherlock was trying to respond in kind, to give what he thought John needed. He'd resorted to the only way he knew how to be sexually intimate with another person, and he realized it wasn’t normal. Shame and embarrassment momentarily overwhelmed him.
His friend studied him, and John let him. He needed Sherlock to see how serious he was. “Need?” he finally asked.
“So about seven years ago, an eleven-year-old boy was placed in the hospital after supposedly murdering his parents. Simon Reese, you might have heard of him when the story first came out?” John sat in the chair across the table from Sherlock, dishing out a meal he would eat and Sherlock would pick at.
. There are no cave paintings there that I’m aware of, but when I did a search for significant caves in the UK, this is what came out, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ why not.
“You used it to offer the reward,” John concluded, sipping his lapsang souchong, letting the smoky warmth curl up cozily in his belly. The room was far more comforting than his own cold, gray bedsit. He was glad he hadn’t decided to wait until later to do this. It was a perfect end to his unexpected, exciting day.
“I think you need a fire. It’s still cold in here.” She moved to the fireplace and began laying it. “It’s not really autumn without a fire, is it? You’re not as cold this far south, but it’s still chilly.”
.” He rolled his eyes at the pronouncement but then squinted at John before raising his eyebrows in surprise. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“I’ve written three times,” he said. “I have called on you twice, to be turned away each time. This time, Miss Turner -”
A fortuitous bolt of lightening swelled the sky, and flickered long enough to expose  the figure of a man, lying on the shoreline along the water. John took off like the hounds of hell were chasing him.
“Quite all right, Dr. Watson. Again, please accept my apologies for my behavior yesterday evening,” Sherlock replied sincerely. “I’m given to bouts of brief illness when I push myself too far. My attempts to unlock my memories have proven quite...tedious.”
“I believe we should go back to the way things were,” John said, lifting the dinner jacket off the hook and opening it for his lordship.
Sherlock hesitated. He’d been down this road before, his gifts of observation and deduction never winning him friends. In fact, it often proved quite the opposite. He’d made up his mind to stop when John Watson said:
John collapsed onto his back next to Sherlock, his chest rising in jagged swells as he recovered from his release.
Sherlock nodded eagerly and slid down to John’s abdomen. He quickly realized that John had no intention of abandoning his place inside of him. In fact, he felt him explore and stretch him again ever so gently. Sherlock softly moaned at the sensation, then trembled with pleasure as John held his large length up to his lips.
“God, you’re amazing,” he whispered passionately. “I’m going to make you feel so good. I’ve never wanted anyone so much.”
“Her ladyship insisted you be next door since you are Lord Sherlock’s doctor,” said Dimmock, who motioned for John step inside.
"Sherlock! Come in, come in, close the door," said Brook. "I like to chat with students new here to the school."
It was then the hot water disappeared. Both men shouted in unison and jumped simultaneously out of the bathroom to avoid the freezing water pouring out of the shower head.
So this story is going to be longer than five chapters. Hang in there, I've got a lot written and it's coming soon. Please know anything is possible...
Halfway down, John stopped mid step. He gathered a fistful of Sherlock’s coat lapel and gently pressed him up against the wall. Sherlock felt warm breath on his face as a stubbled jaw grazed his neck.
John stepped out to watch the Captain Lestrade and his soldiers march away. He realized after they’d disappeared from eyesight that Felipe was not among the crowd. He went back inside and ducked behind the curtain. He crawled up the ladder pulled himself up onto the covered ledge.
Sherlock immediately obeyed the implied command. He played the most difficult piece he knew, Locatelli's Caprice in D major Op. 3 No. 23 'Il labirinto armonico. For a full three minutes, he worked the strings with his fingers and bow through the hell of the solo, crescendoing into the high note, holding it, until the sound slowly diminished.
As he stepped inside the familiar room, John tried to look around without appearing to do so. He knew it was foolish to even attempt pretense with Sherlock in the room, but it seemed the polite thing to do.
“But it’s your birthright,” Sherlock growled back. “You are the heir. You are the marquess of Berwick!” He hissed.
“Um, yes, um,” stuttered Molly. Sherlock turned around, looking at her in confusion. She didn’t want to go, not yet. She needed more time. So she lied.
They both tried to make it last (they really did) but the tight clothing and Felipe’s large, skilled hands made John come hard right in his pants. Felipe watched him writhe with pure admiration, and then with ease, turned him facing out on his huge lap. The Spaniard pushed his hips up shamelessly into John’s little arse. He braced himself against the tops of John’s thighs and ground his hard cock in a steady rhythm until he came with a long, languorous shudder.
That evening, John relaxed in the guest bedroom. He opened a bottle of cava and poured himself a generous glass. He settled back in the chair with his notebook in his lap and began to write.
They had ridden by lamplight to the Felipe’s home. John briefly met a sister, an aunt and a nephew before being led to a bedroom on the far left wing of the villa. He’d collapsed into the clean, comfortable bed with only the energy to remove his shoes.
John at first hid the telegram from Sherlock, but it was little use in trying to keep a secret from the man. By that afternoon, Sherlock had already sent a letter to the Alnwicks to request an extended visit.
The violin solo abruptly halts. A deep ripple appears in the young musician’s smooth forehead as he rubs his palm impatiently over his eye socket. It forces the burning to subside. He sighs, silently admonishing himself, and pulls the violin back up to his chin to begin the piece again.
Before John could protest, Jean opened the door and walked inside. John followed. The room was deep, and was separated in the back by a partition. The front waiting area had several old chairs with a huge, dusty curtain hanging from the ceiling. Jean pushed the curtain back to reveal an old wooden desk and empty shelves lining the wall. Two high wooden slabs sat in the middle of the room, and several cots were along the opposite wall.
John closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against the Spaniard's. “I don't deserve you,” he whispered.
John Watson failed to suppress a smirk at Mycroft’s comment, which made Sherlock like him even more. He allowed his eyes dip below the young man’s face to observe filthy rugby regalia, neck and arms dirty from play.
For a moment, John thought he meant Tangier, but it quickly became clear that he meant the apothecary.
And what kind of life would he have with Sherlock if they crossed into something more? Constantly sneaking about, stealing a kiss here and there, always under the veil of secrecy. It sounded terrible. John desperately wished he could banish the desire and lust eating them both alive.
Sherlock tried to hide the suspicion in his voice. The secretary was gone, the door shut behind her.
Felipe gripped his lover’s hips and pulled him deep inside, still feeling his muscles pulsing and contracting.
John's tumultuous childhood is explored as well as his time in the military, where his separation from Sherlock takes it's toll on both their lives.
As hard as he tried to stop it, the frame continued it's banging while the bed squeaked with their lovemaking. John was too aware of the noise- it was obvious the whole flat could hear them- so he tried to slow Felipe’s hard thrusts plundering his tight little body.
When he opened his eyes again, the room had ceased spinning and his stomach had settled. He carefully sat up and rubbed his face with his palms. He gathered it was late. The air was cool and the room was dark and quiet. The only light was from a lamp by one of the beds towards the back of the tent. A man lay awake, his upper body propped up so he could read.
“Ah,” said Brook flippantly. “Richard Brook, Sherlock’s professor.” He reached forward and held out his hand as if to shake.
“Sherlock?” Still no response. Sherlock lay quietly against his chest. “What happened in South Africa?”
John sat the paper down and leaned back on his hands. “I was on the front line,” he began. “I found your father kidnapped and being threatened by these two Afghan soldiers. I was forced to... to take care of them -” he said, glancing up at Sherlock. “- your father was wounded so I flagged down a Cavalryman to take him back to camp.” John took a long drink from his cup. “Later we were in the same infirmary, and he was very kind to me. He offered me a job as repayment. I was very grateful.” He smiled again, deep in thought. “I recognised him by his eyes. You definitely have the same eyes.”
Huge kudos to my precious BanimalQ who was the sick fuck who came up with the idea that Raibert had slept with all his cousins sans Harry. It was a stroke of genius that added another dimension to the Watson family mess.
“Come on, I’ll buy you a pint,” said Sherlock, taking him discreetly by his good arm and leading him into the pub.
Sherlock sobbed as John squeezed his erection and at the same time tightened the grip on his wrists. Sherlock lifted his hips again, and again, and again. He helplessly whined into John's neck. It was exquisite torture.
Watson’s words triggered a memory in Sherlock’s sharp mind, something his father had mentioned a few times after he’d returned from war. He talked of being indebted to a young man who had saved his life from enemy soldiers during the Battle of Kabul.
Sherlock pulled out his fingers and held on with both hands around John’s neck. Sherlock pounded into him, then slowed down, then pounded some more.
"Lie back," mumbled John against Sherlock's red and swollen lips. Sherlock did as he was told, settling back on the pillows propping his head. John kissed the top of each of Sherlock's bony knees, then deftly slid a finger inside his still slicked and open center.
Molly Hooper thought Sherlock Holmes wanted to take her to dinner. Of course Sherlock Holmes had something infinitely more compelling, wonderful and thrilling planned for her.
Mycroft glanced at the reference over Robert’s shoulder. They both gave each other a look. Mycroft turned and spoke.
He grew strong and lean, the sun darkening his skin as it lightened his hair. His posture went from one of rigid anticipation to relaxed confidence. One day, Sherlock looked out at the ocean from the house and didn’t recognise him standing in the sand. He no longer resembled the John Watson he’d brought to Morocco. This man was virile, vibrant, and no longer followed orders. He gave them.
Irene leaned forward and whispered. “You’re looking a bit peaky, dear. Would you like a bit of dry toast?”
“Oh my God,” gasped Sherlock, holding on to Raibert's auburn locks for dear life. It felt like a dozen men were sucking him at the same time, a dozen men fucking him, holding him, forcing him to feel it all.
After the discovery of John's noble lineage, Sherlock had returned to Edinburgh as he promised to allow his partner to finish his prestigious fellowship. John knew Sherlock was bored out of his mind, but as luck would have it, John was offered a position in London six months later. He took the job, knowing the farther away from the dowager marchioness of Berwick the happier they would be.
The two men struggled as John tried to force William back to his feet. William pushed back as John stood, and his chair toppled over, taking his wine with it. The glass shattered as John grasped Willam’s forearms together, the younger man still on his knees as John towered over him.
Finally, as dusk settled in, Mr Frank approached him and asked if he would like to sit down. When John went to move to the chair, he collapsed to the floor and didn’t awaken until the following afternoon.
A crowd of fifteen men stood in a semicircle in front of the hospital, holding knives, swords and rocks. The same man that John had confronted several days before stepped forward and shouted at him angrily.
Sherlock was now a patient, desperate for his help. He would do everything within his power to make sure he found a healing path.
“Can you find it in your heart to be with me, just as I am? Just once? I won’t ask you to stay again. I promise.”
He reached forward in his drunkenness and placed a small, strong hand over the Spaniard’s heart. He rubbed the spot tenderly with his thumb, then rested his blonde head on Felipe’s wide shoulder.
John froze, and Sherlock kept talking, more rapidly now. “I meant to say it as soon as I got here, and then before the nap, and after, and you've already said it--I mean, before, at 221B, and again in your letters, and I didn't want to wait any longer before--”
John felt his eyes go hot again, and blinked furiously. This was getting ridiculous. “I was only in the bathroom,” he said, but he knew that wasn’t what Sherlock meant. “I thought…”
John took the opportunity to examine Sherlock’s arse closely, as Sherlock had helpfully flipped the Belstaff up over his back to avoid dragging the hem on the ground. He had become very familiar with Sherlock’s arse over the past month, and, despite having been familiar with said arse just that morning, his cock gave an interested twitch.
John swallowed hard, steeling himself for the inevitable questions his request would engender. “I need to look through the current job postings. The...out of town job postings. I was thinking Scotland, maybe, or even America, if any alumni have sent queries in from overseas.”
Except John was looking up at him now, unmoving except for the clenching of his left hand. Sherlock lifted a hand, wanting to make sure John knew he’d seen him, but John still didn’t move to come in. The sun was bright that afternoon, and it was hard to discern the exact expression on his face. The giddiness in Sherlock was slowing down, slipping away. What could be the matter? John was here. He’d brought his things. He wouldn’t have done that if he had changed his mind.
“You're quite grumpy during this season of brotherhood and good cheer,” Sherlock tsked. “Did you quarrel with my odious brother?” As Lestrade reddened, Sherlock held out his phone. “May I recommend consulting the app?”
Sherlock pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a couple of times, and then typed several words. It wasn't until he started shaking it, though, that John understood what was happening.
Sherlock opened his mouth, closed it again, and then abruptly stood, presumably heading for the kettle. John reached out, snagged his lover by the wrist, and pulled in just such a way that Sherlock tumbled into his lap. Sherlock immediately tucked his face away into John’s neck, and John chuckled, running a hand through the curls brushing his face. “Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing, you great git?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John, you have spent a portion of the entire time we have known one another trying to improve me. Don't pretend that's not been the case; it's tiresome.”
John opened his eyes, startled by the closer proximity of Sherlock’s voice, and looked up to see that the detective had quietly moved around the table while John was trying to regain control of himself. As John watched, Sherlock dropped down to his knees beside the chair and slowly, carefully placed one hand over John’s.
“Maeve and Bertie. They're retired G2.” When John looked still more confused, he explained further. “Irish intelligence.”
That statement was enough to make Sherlock snap his mouth closed. John would remember that in future.5. John was in love with Sherlock, and had been for a very long time.
If he’d had to guess, he wouldn’t have imagined that he would find Sherlock asleep, curled on his side on the couch, clutching the Union Jack pillow that used to sit in John’s chair.
He crosses to the far end of the coffee table and lowers first the sandwiches and then himself down. He is greeted with a level, mildly curious gaze from the eyes he knows better than any others.
“You’re still making me wait, John,” Sherlock managed, and this time when John laughed, it had more strength behind it.
“We're going to miss you, John,” Maeve said wistfully as she crossed behind his chair and over to the coffee table, where she began to unload a tray of filled appetizer plates. John jumped up to take the tray from her hands, allowing her to move the plates more swiftly, and she flashed him a grateful smile.
“Want you,” Sherlock gasped, sliding his hands around John’s arse and teasing a finger down his cleft, making John’s hips buck. “All those things you wrote about…I want to do them all, right now, right here.” He thrust against John, and they were both fully erect now. “But I want to do this first.”
Sherlock’s tone is smooth, but John can see uncertainty in his friend’s eyes now. “Sensible.” He repeats.
John takes a step closer. “You did. I didn't think about them all day,” he admits. He pictures them now, Mary and the baby who wasn't his, and wonders again where Mycroft had stashed them, though John had made the elder Holmes promise never to tell him. He closes his eyes briefly, indulging in a thought of how his first Father’s Day might have gone if things had turned out differently.
“The mind boggles, John; and to think I once thought highly of Gerald.” But there was a glint in his eyes that told John he didn’t really mean it.
John knew what Sherlock looked like asleep in the dark, and in full afternoon sun, and in the pale foggy light of morning. He knew that Sherlock slept on his stomach (when he wasn't sleeping on his back) (or his left side). He knew that when the air was very dry, Sherlock snored (just a little) but would become very defensive if you ever brought it up, especially if you called it anything like “little nose wheezes.” He knew that Sherlock’s hair looked ridiculous if he slept on anything but a satin pillowcase; that Sherlock would steal the entire blanket and John’s pillow if given the chance; that Sherlock looked both heartbreakingly lonely and impossibly young when he slept.
What he didn't know was why, when the hotel in Manchester wasn't remotely full three weeks ago, they still ended up in a room with one bed. He'd been too exhausted to ask that night, and was barely able to strip down to vest and pants before collapsing face first and falling asleep. When he'd woken the next morning, Sherlock was up and dressed, but there was a definite head dent in his pillow. It had occurred to him to ask about the bed thing later, but he had decided to just let it go.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he said quietly, his hands gripping the mug tightly. “I shouldn’t have presumed. I shouldn't have just shown up here last night. I don’t--I know I can’t expect things to just go back to like they used to be, for us to go back to how we used to be.”
Sherlock barked out a bitter laugh, and anything good that had been left in the atmosphere was gone. “I've lain here at Baker Street month after month, year after year, alone. You've never chosen me, and you're not choosing me now. I'm just what's left.”
Hi, Greg, it’s Molly--Molly Hooper. I was wondering if you’d heard from Sherlock. I’ve texted and left a couple of messages about an autopsy he was waiting on, and he’s not getting back to me. Maybe he’s out of town? If you know where he is, call me back?”
He let his gaze skitter over Sherlock: his beautiful, beloved face; the pale expanse of his neck; his impossibly long fingers. His rigid form, completely motionless and so close that John would only have to lift a finger to touch. Twice before, John had thought he was seeing Sherlock for the last time. On the tarmac, he’d stepped away after only a handshake. Could he leave Sherlock (forever) without...something?
As he stepped into the bathroom, there was a low rumble of “Are you coming in?”, so he pulled the door closed behind him and quickly slipped out of his vest and pants. The room was full of steam, but he could still see the hazy outline of Sherlock’s naked body through the glass door of the oversized stall shower that was usually one of his least favorite parts of the house. John loved a proper bath and hadn’t had one in nearly a year.
It would take less than thirty minutes for John to regret their conversation--practically a new record. He was heading to the bar for a drink and asked Sherlock if he could get him anything.
I know many of you are eager to read them, but Sherlock's letters will not be part of this project. I could not decide on a way to fit them into the story organically. However, I do plan on completing them and making them available; that will be an ongoing sort of ficlet project that I'll begin sometime after this has all been posted.
John took himself in hand and lined up, just barely nudging at Sherlock’s entrance with the tip as their eyes met. He saw the same love and desire, amplified if anything, and trust. They both took one more deep breath together, and when Sherlock nodded, John pushed in slowly. As his cock slid further into Sherlock’s body, John wondered for a moment if people often passed out while doing this. By the time their hips were flush together, he had to close his eyes and just breathe for a moment. He wanted neither to faint nor to come immediately, and both seemed equally possible just then.
Their eyes snapped open at Mrs. Hudson’s voice, and John’s mouth curled in a rueful grin. “More waiting.”
Of all the ways he has envisioned (fantasized about) it happening over the years, the reality doesn’t match any of them.
And then a foot shoved at him impatiently, and his eyes flew back open. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, and everything was...
Not until he looked up at his wedding as Sherlock loved him in front of everyone, unflinching and unafraid, and he realized that after all this time he might still be in love with his best friend and not with the woman he'd just pledged his life to. And the merest hint of that mistake was the most terrifying thing of all, so he waltzed with his (pregnant) wife and he went on a honeymoon and he came home and just stopped calling Sherlock.
“As you wish, m’lady,” answer Mr Frank. He gave John an assuring look and left the room, closing the large wooden doors behind him.
“Ah,” smiled Brook. “Just a little relaxation session before practice.” Brook’s hand dipped inside Sherlock’s shirt, palming his chest.
“And where’s your better half?” she asks, nosily poking through the kitchen. When Sherlock doesn’t answer, she suddenly stops and returns to the living area.
John looked up and smiled. He placed a hand on Sherlock's, then rubbed his cheek against his knuckles.
He smiled at Felipe, who was now whistling as he drove the team, the wind blowing carelessly through his dark, silky hair.
“You want more, love?” whispered John. Sherlock responded with an impatient, muffled moan since his mouth was stretched full of John's cock. The vibration almost gave John reason to release, but he forced himself to hold back.
“They believe his body was lost to the falls,” he continued, his voice hollow. “That type of force, it...the waters are freezing and very deep, I’m told.”
John shook his head. “No, I’m not. Matthew is the marquess.” He licked his lips in frustration. “My father decided to be a vicar. That’s my legacy.”
“You have it, too, I suspect. You would appreciate my Sant Sadurni d’Anoia. It is beautiful there. Vineyards, olive trees, beautiful women, beautiful men…”
Sherlock, remembering the brick wall in the tunnel, immediately felt around the rocks and within moments, pushed a lever that popped open the bogus barricade.
John did wait up for him, but even he was surprised at how late Sherlock arrived back at the suite. He was dozing off with a book of common German phrases over his chest when he heard the door click shut.
Sherlock let John roll him gently onto his side facing out, his solid arm embracing Sherlock's chest, still holding him close. His tender lips sucked marks into the pale flesh of his neck as his thick palm pulled firmly on Sherlock's hardening cock. Sherlock could feel John's erection pressed against his coccyx, and he heard himself moan as he reached behind him to grip the back of John's muscled thigh.
Sherlock picked up the torch and followed John into the original passage when he froze. He cocked his head, listening.
The Earl shifted in the chair, as if weighing his words. Finally, he leaned in close to John and said kindly:
The tense moment from before seemed to fall away at the news. A half-smile creeped onto John’s lips.
“Will it ensure us a straight ticket to hell if we shag in the crime scene?” said Sherlock, gesturing towards the bathroom.
He shook his head in disbelief. He looked up into the mirror above the washstand and said to his reflection:
John shifted so he laid face to face with the Spaniard. He stroked his stubbled jawline with his forefinger.
He squirmed underneath John’s weight, pressing and rubbing his naked, full erection against his trousers.
Sherlock moved to the foot of the bed. He glanced up at John and stuck out his pink tongue, licking the tip of John’s sex.
In response, Sherlock buried his head in John's shoulder and pulled him closer. He’d done his best to cover the spot along his jaw, but John would eventually notice. He was not looking forward to telling him what had happened the night before.
John headed downstairs to the servant's hall. The housekeeper stood in the hallway with an envelope and a basket.
Sherlock obeyed, his chest heaving. Something wet fell on his arm. He reached up and felt his cheeks. When had he started to cry?
“This is a complete waste of time,” Mycroft said. “Squandering your potential has become your occupation, baby brother.”
By the time they made it to Donovan’s office, William was in an obvious state of distress. Sweat poured off his brow as his shoulder’s slumped, and he had turned white as a sheet.
“Ok. Maybe a bug flew in my ear. Bar 115. Five-six-and--” He cued the orchestra with his hand, then seconds later, cut them off.
William wisely didn’t respond, but his crystal eyes filled with shock at what the doctor was insinuating.
John’s heart fluttered so forcefully in his chest that he had to dig his heels into the floor to steady himself. He gazed in wonder at the slender, aging man, still as graceful and beautiful as the day John had met him so long ago.
Sherlock, roused from his slumber, looked down with sleepy eyes to see John’s blonde head bobbing over his abdomen. He gasped and groaned and pulled John off of him, forcing him up to his own full lips, kissing him and licking him.
John continued down the worn path until he came to a small house snuggled against a cluster of ancient trees. The trunks were gnarled over and above the ground like giant snakes, and it looked as if someone had used them as a place to sit more than once. John watched as a mangy looking dog crawled from under the porch and plopped lazily in front of the door.
The dinner from the night before had been calm and anticlimactic. As John suspected, Sherlock was a regular at dinner in the beginning, but had failed more times than not to appear in recent weeks.
Anderson smiled so big Sherlock thought his cheeks would pop. He shot out of his chair and was at the professor's side within seconds.
A brutal rhythm ensued as powerful hips smacked against a tender behind, Sherlock's bottom no longer white but a splotchy pink. John drove into his body hard and fast, Sherlock watched him, his eyes now clear but his expression blank as John took what he wanted.
Sherlock walked over and ran his hand carefully along the table. "A skilled surgeon could slice an arm off at the shoulder in seventeen seconds,” he said.
“Anderson is a bloody snitch who needs additional duties to keep him out of other people's affairs.”
Sherlock failed to reply. A whole week without John and facing Brook everyday was suddenly very overwhelming.
Sherlock’s moans were muffled as the good doctor kissed him deeply, the hand not curled tightly around the detective’s neck pulling off his unbuttoned shirt and throwing it to the floor.
“Did I s-s-stutter?” laughed Brook. Sherlock stood up to unbutton his shirt. Brooks swatted him hard across the arse.
Once he determined mother and child were out of danger, he collapsed on the back porch in exhaustion. He fancied a whisky and large cigar, but pushed the thought out of his mind as he knew Mr. Thomas would not approve.
A tube and bus ride later, John and Sherlock happily entered the warm dormitory. Sherlock tried not to be embarrassed as he passed his classmates, none of who greeted him or even tried to make eye contact.
This time Sherlock got it right. He swallowed and relaxed his throat, and John, now a less hesitant recipient, allowed for about 90 seconds of incredible, thrilling deep-throat fucking for both young men. Sherlock swallowed, licked, sucked and reveled in the abuse as John became rougher and stricter with his movements, until Sherlock's nose was buried so deep in his partner’s pubic hair that he couldn’t even breath. It pushed John over the edge and he came, deep inside Sherlock’s throat. Afterward, he collapsed without any grace onto the floor. Sherlock finished silently on his own just seconds after, and laid down next to John.
“Student dies in mysterious drowning accident,” he quoted. “Carlos P. Powers II, 19, of Nottingham, died yesterday in his dorm room at Cromwell Music Conservatory. Powers, the son of Carlos P. Powers I, British composer and maestro of the Munich Symphony, was found dead at the scene face down in the shower located in his dormitory at the Cromwell student living quarters. Cause of death is ruled drowning. Authorities do not suspect foul play.” John gave the phone back to Sherlock. “That’s awful.”
“We, actually,” answered John automatically. He pondered his response for a bit before attempting another stitch. “Well, no, Sherlock solved them. I just tagged along usually. Wrote my little stories.”
Sherlock placed a gloved hand on the back of John’s head. “You tried to save her life, John. I’m sure wherever she is now she’s grateful.” Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him. “I know I am.”
On the way back from the village, John stepped out of the way of wagons full to the brim with milk bottles, or flowers, or summer hay. The smells of the countryside brought memories of his and Sherlock’s early days, when they used to ride together from morning until tea time. John cherished those moments. He thought of them often during dark times, warm memories that helped him cope.
He placed the baton back in the case after a brief pause, and hit the control pad, shutting the glass slide.
The trip was long but not nearly as uncomfortable as John had imagined. He could actually stretch out and sleep on the boat and the train and there was food to eat and beer to drink. The further south they went the warmer the air, and when they finally reached Tangier the sea breeze felt like heaven on Earth.
“Why?" he answered. “Every question I have, every problem I bring to you you give me half-truths or placate me with some trivial nonsense. You keep me far away.”
Sherlock snapped back to attention. “It’s nothing,” he said, brushing past her to gaze out the window.
John shook his head. “One could set his watch by him. It’s unusual for him not to show, and to not send word.”
John beamed, his posture rising, chest swelling. He pulled Sherlock close and kissed him, softly at first, then with growing passion. Sherlock rubbed his large hand between John’s thighs.
“Look, here,” he said suddenly, lowering his lamp to a trail of dark liquid that had soaked into the wood.
He was pleased to find the door locked from the inside. The room was fitted with a chair, music stand, a coat rack, large bench and two small shelves. One shelf held a stylish wooden metronome, while the other was filled with mineral oil, polish, cloths and cork grease.
Victor signaled the waiter for another ale. “See, I found some documents in his flat,” he said, lowering his voice.  “Multiple passports with different names, all with his photograph. And he’d have to take these sudden phone calls. Sometimes he’d speak in German. I think it’s when he didn’t want me to understand what he was saying.”
John remembered that day he was turned out of Halidon by the marchioness. Like his shoulder, it was a wound that had never properly healed.
“Sherlock.” John began to lose his composure. He cleared his throat but it didn’t help. The emotion welled up through his chest and into his head. He grabbed Sherlock’s hands and squeezed them tightly as he broke down, his voice strained as his throat tightened.
Shocked at the discovery and not quite sure of his next step, Sherlock quickly shut the door and placed the thick vines of ivy back over the entrance, obscuring it from view.
The good doctor’s arm reached up behind him, grabbing a fistful of the younger man’s curls as Sherlock slowly penetrated him. Both men were still half asleep, moving on instinct and lust. John closed his eyes and enjoyed being filled. He pushed his hips forward into Sherlock's slicked hand, then pulled back, his round bottom slipping easily onto Sherlock's cock.
He proceeded to buy two train tickets in utter silence and board the passenger carriage. The train was only half-full so they had a row to themselves.
It was the term Sherlock used that brought John to his senses. He laughed awkwardly though his tears. “You called me ‘love’,” he said.
Sherlock's mind was no longer on Richard Brook, or Victor Trevor, or Carl Powers. He was consumed with how terrible he’d left things with John. Of course he’d lied, how else could he keep the investigation going? Lives were at stake.
A rush of heat, just a rush of something, and Sherlock was whimpering into Raibert’s mouth. “Fuck me, fuck me,” he heard himself whine. And that huge cock filled him up, and Sherlock felt no pain, and he rode him for what felt like days, gripping the back of his thick, muscled neck, rubbing his cheek against his sweaty forehead, grinding his leaking cock against his rippled stomach.
But the play in the bedroom happened only when they had the luxury of time to do it properly. Otherwise the two men engaged in a sexual routine that of a normal couple, albeit their appetites were a bit more vigorous than the norm. It was unusual for the two men to go more than a day or two without touching each other in such a way, and with traveling for weeks on end, they were now practically starving for each other.
Sherlock slid his arm into the vest and primped in front of the mirror. He turned around for his boots when he realised something was terribly wrong with his valet. His eyebrows knitted together as his crystal-like eyes filled with immediate concern.
But he was still standing, and he was breathing, so he wandered back over to the ledge, and called out again his beloved’s name.
Sherlock sat on the floor in the far corner of the hallway, purposefully out of sight.  He held the Reichenbach Concerto sheet music in his hand, using his mind technique to methodically commit as much of it as possible to memory.
"I'm going to murder them," said John, his anger rising as he bolted off the bed. He reached past Sherlock to grab the bottle of Scotch, filling the tumbler full, only to chug it down in a few gulps. His whole chest and neck were flushed, and much like Sherlock, he was trembling.
"An operating table," he said amazed. "This was back when doctors would operate on people without anesthetic. Would cut people's limbs off as a last hope of saving them."
Sherlock pressed into John’s belly with his palms, arching forward and then backwards, then bouncing his hips gently, his behind grinding into the top of John’s thighs. His length, which had softened, began to fill out again and was soon bobbing along with his hips as John watched his lover take his enjoyment from his own broken body. It was glorious.
Felipe’s smile faded a bit. He held John’s small hand up to his mouth. He kissed the back of it with care.
“Examine your patient. Ask them if they are injured elsewhere. Absence of proof is not proof of absence, yeah?” said John, looking expectantly at Felipe, who shook his head while wincing in pain. John quickly examined the Spaniard from head to toe, at one point lifting the tail of his shirt to reveal a large, mangled scar on his abdomen. He quickly covered him back up. “Now, clean and stitch the wound.”
Felipe snorted softly. “The fucking bugs aren’t aware of our borders. The blight loves the vine in Sant Sadurni d’Anoia as much as Bordeaux.” His confident demeanor seemed to sag a little. “Every year it eats up more and more of our crop. Last year, we didn’t produce enough to make profit. But that’s not the worst part.”
“James Stuart reportedly died during a raid in one of the villages where he was a stationed, leaving the title to Albert, and then after he passed, to his first born, Matthew.”
The next morning, before sunrise, Sherlock used Mycroft’s complimentary car service for the second time during his tenure at Cromwell to take John Watson home to his bed to heal. Sherlock insisted he ride along, and John, for once, let him care for him, holding him during the commute, helping him out of the car and up the stairs. When John realized he'd forgotten his key at the hospital, Sherlock picked the lock, which amused John to no end.
Ahad set off to find the medicine as John ignored and pushed his way through the two men. He picked up a medical bag and headed back out across the courtyard.
"Shit, shit, sorry!" whispered John, visibly upset. Sherlock quickly took John's hand, placed it again on the back of his head, and lifted the solid cock back up to his mouth.
“Turkmenia?” said John. “Isn’t that part of the Russian empire now? Why would we have a regiment in disputed territory?”
The former servant-turned-investment authority smiled as he spotted Felipe. He shook the Spaniard’s hand with enthusiasm.
Sherlock looked up, annoyed. “No, thank you.” He shook his head in disbelief, and continued to text.
John gazed longingly back at him, his eyes hooded, darting between his beautiful eyes and the sinful lips stretched wide around his sex.
“Sergeant Reginald Baxter, God save the Queen,” responded the soldier. He waved for two more ales to be set at the table and pulled out a bottle of whisky from under the table, removing the cork with his teeth. “Here, this’ll put some hair on that chest of yours.”
At first, Mr. Thomas had the good sense not to encourage him, but the laughter was infectious, and he found himself giggling along with his younger cohort. When they finally managed to get ahold of themselves, Mr. Thomas leaned forward and grasped John tightly by the shoulders.
The bow flies over the strings as plopping sounds of nimble digits over the fingerboard become wilder and wilder. Sherlock struggles, and with each passing moment falls further behind the impossible pace Brook has set with his claps.
“Sherlock, listen to me,” said John. “You have to stop thinking about it over and over again. It's the only way to heal. The only way to forgiveness.”
“I'm extremely grateful for the kindness bestowed upon me upon entering this household,” he said humbly. “I know this has been a tremendously difficult time for you, and there is no doubt that your support is the reason I am still with you.”
“I'll be right back,” John said, kissing him on the forehead and bounding off the bed. He found his medical bag and retrieved the salve from its pockets. For a fleeting moment he remembered the gentle caresses of the Spaniard. He forced the bittersweet memory aside and thought only of Sherlock, ready and waiting in bed just steps away.
"Uh-uh, arpeggios, triple it. TRI-PEL-ET!” commands Brook, clapping his hands widely, moving about the room, back and forth, back and forth.
“I apologize. I thought you meant Pilar’s baby girl.” He wiped his eyes and drew a long, deep breath. “Penelope.”
The terror in the room was palpable. Sherlock averted his eyes and looked directly ahead at his music stand.
“Dr. Watson, let's return, to make sure Mr. Holmes didn’t make it to Rosenlaui after all,” Peter said sensibly.
Of course, that was 132 years ago. Due to the expense of keeping up the rest of the facilities, the subterranean level had not been maintained properly, and the stone was crumbling. The stench of mildew permeated the rehearsal rooms, and the steps that led down to the hollowed out core were steep and loose. In 1998 the rooms were considered an official health hazard. The mold count was off the charts, but most students continued to brave the creepy rooms until a generous grant from a wealthy donor prompted its closing. The donated millions were spent to remodel the fourth floor of the main structure, and seventy-five soundproof practice rooms, some with a view of the courtyard, became available for use in August of 2012. As for the old, dilapidated practice rooms underneath the structure, most assumed the entrance had been filled in and sealed off, for safety and structural concerns mandated by the building codes office.
The men shuffled inside and ordered the special, roasted lamb and potatoes. John went ahead and ordered for William, whom he assumed would show at any moment. It wasn’t like the man to be late, but it was only half-past the hour.
At 7:59 pm the following evening, John Watson walked into the tiny little restaurant in the center of town.
Sherlock ran his thumbs over his wet, red eyes. “When I was told my identity had been compromised, I refused to leave. Instead I tried to warn them,” he said. “Lestrade gave the order to have me restrained and taken back to base by force.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I thought it was your mate who didn’t know ‘his arse from an ankle tap’,” he said.
The violin player’s tune became slow and sweet. Friederich grabbed Fritz by the hand and they held each other, dancing and swaying in the middle of the room. Two other men joined in, dancing and holding onto one another. John watched their mouths meet, kissing and hugging and nuzzling each other as they moved slowly around the room.
The whole consultive detective obsession started with a paragraph in the Times about a murder in Notting Hill.
