“More like pounded on the door, and then barged upstairs. I’m surprised that John didn’t greet you on the stairs with the firearm in hand. No need to worry about getting shot now, John is disarmed, Lestrade.”
“The official one.”
The radio from Mrs. Hudson’s flat carried thought the air, offering a soft tune to the quiet staring stalemate between flatmates, best friends. It was true; John would be unable to get that much sleep, even less so if he knew that Sherlock had an injury that needed to be treated. He knew that Sherlock wouldn’t do it himself. Not without more prompting. And nagging. And hounding.
Licking his lips, John stated in a hardened tone, “I know that you wanted to say something in the bedroom, but didn’t. I want to let you know that you can tell me...anything at all…all right? It’s all fine, of course.”
“John?”
“It’s a crime scene, Sherlock. It’s not going anywhere.”
“You’re going to work yourself up into a sulk,” John countered casually, padding around the room to look for that bottle of lube they had earlier. The last he had seen it was when he fetched it out of the bedside table. He paused in his search to coax Sherlock back down on the bed.
He pulled out the dead mobile from his pocket, the two slips of yellow messages, and presented it to Sherlock.
The DI walked towards them, rubbing a hand over his face. “What took the two you so long?”
A/N: Man...the long awaited chapter. Give love to my beta whitehart for being brilliant and adding more 'mmmm' to smut. Can I say that here? I was really really close to ending the fic here, so all of you should thank Whitehart for talking me out it!
He stepped forward, closing the small distance with his forehead resting against Sherlock’s chest. He felt Sherlock’s beating heart, warmth radiating from his skin, the smell of his expensive cologne. He had desperately wanted them to be together, and now that he had it, John had no idea what to do next. Sherlock’s hands ran a heated trail up his spine. One elegant hand held the back of his neck, covering it fully, and the other hand stopped on his shoulder.
“Two females. No IDs. From we can tell, maybe out of towners with a mugging gone wrong.”
“Yet,” John added. They shared another glance before bursting out into laughter. When the cab pulled up to New Scotland Yard, John was wiping the tears from his eyes. He paid the cabbie and followed after Sherlock, who had disappeared inside. John greeted several officers before finding Sherlock standing with Lestrade. He joined them, catching the conversation as the inspector spoke.
His hands balled into fists when Sherlock hummed, as if he was saying something around John’s cock to counter. But John didn’t ask. In this scenario, Sherlock didn’t need to have the last word, not right now, for god’s sake. He resisted the urge to tilt his hips forward. Gently, he reached his hands forward and caressed Sherlock’s neck, slowly made his way up to his head, letting his hand move along with the detective’s head.
“What are we doing in the lab?”
Sherlock let out a mixture of a sigh and a groan in complaint. “Get on with it, John. Stop attempting to mollycoddle.”
He grabbed his trousers from two days ago buried underneath yesterday’s clothing. John rustled through the pockets. The first pocket and then the second pocket. Then the back two pockets. And found nothing.
It seemed his question went unnoticed as Sherlock muttered lowly. “The fingertips were tilted up, not down, not made by their own hands, or the killer’s if grabbed from behind. It would have to be…oh, obvious!”
“Yes, and your superiors are idiots. What about the missing footage of the jumper within the lobby? Do they count that as evidence as well?”
“I was joking, yesterday, about sending Mycroft a cake. You shouldn’t tempt him into failure like that just so you can remind him of his weaknesses,” John lectured flatly.
“Right.”
“A bit of everything.”
“And bloody.”
“Even when he means to invade our privacy in our own home?”
Sherlock remained quiet. John sighed. “Dinner then?”
John didn’t bother asking how Sherlock knew. “No. The wife was dead for hours. When I left, Lestrade was sealing up the crime scene. I found something else though.”
The screeching of the violin made John jerk away from his task and into the living room. Sherlock had the chin rest resting on the side of his face. The bow was in the air, hovering over the strings as Sherlock retorted, his brow furrowed together. “I’m not being hunted, Mycroft.”
Jack Ripper laughed boldly, and threw his head back. His blackish grey hair reflected the bright lights in the room like dull silver. Laughter bounced around the room as if Sherlock’s reply was the funniest joke he had heard in months. When he was finished, the grin was plastered back on his face.
John matched the pace, fucking into the channel of their hands interwoven around their cocks. Between the moans, John moved one hand from Sherlock’s hip, and behind. Stroking, teasing a finger up and down the line of his buttock. John broke the kiss, and whispered over Sherlock’s lips.
John shook his head, his voice lowered to a whisper when a nameless person walked by on his mobile. “You are not getting me out of my clothes.”
“Crime scene.”
Chapter 21
Moran flicked the ashes out the window before returning the cigarette back on his lips. “Hand it over,” his hand motioning for the empty pistol.
“It took me a second longer.”
As John approached 221B Baker Street, he spotted a familiar woman, and the familiar car that she was leaning against parked on the street in front of the door.
John scoffed lightly. A half-grin bloomed over his features, entertained by the fact that Mycroft dared to utter that phrase at him. Even after all these years, the elder Holmes didn’t realize what John could understand of him. Both Holmes could read a person like reading a book, but ‘knowing’ a person was completely different from reading a person’s clothing. Mycroft had different levels of ‘worry’. Level one: he was the atypical nosey older brother, who had a problem with kidnapping…. and bribery. Level four John saw on the tarmac, the he was genuinely worried that he may lose his brother forever.
The end of the line buzzed empty before John could even offer his farewell. He quickly answered the phone to another pain in the arse. He couldn’t even get a ‘Hello’ in before the older Holmes started.
“Not in the system?” asked John.
“I have no idea, Greg,” he answered truthfully. The mobile beeped his ear, John pulled away, and the read the caller ID. Mycroft. John sighed before returning the phone to his ear. “I’ve got to go. Mycroft ringing.”
Seeing the time on the phone face made John yearn for his bed. Or tea. Or perhaps tea in bed. Either way, his eyes burned looking at the blue numbers. He flipped the phone open. There was a-
John yelled through it. “Mrs. Hudson, it wasn’t what it looked like!”
“If he had, it certainly wasn’t the first time you’ve been hung up on,” Sherlock countered informally. “Send him a text if it bothers you. I doubt he would respond. Even I heard the shout about a body from here. He’s busy.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, hung an expression of disagreement on his face. John just stared down at him, using their reversed heights to loom over the detective, just as Sherlock had done to him so many other times. Sherlock’s jaw clicked shut, his head nodded within John’s hands.
Which was the reason at two-thirty in the afternoon, John exploded.
The mixture of their colognes and sex combined in the air, along with their voices. Each moan, gasp, sigh, and creak of the bedframe echoed throughout the bedroom.
Molly smiled at him, waving her hand. “You don’t need to explain. I’m probably the last person you should be explaining to. Like you said, ‘allowed to have a life that I deem fit.’ That goes for you too. I can’t judge people for what I overhear.”
“There was a text message. Kill ‘Issac Spoo’ in the next 48 hours… or you’re next.”
“I really didn’t like the moustache. It was like you were… someone else. Not my John.” It came out as nothing more than a tender whisper.

With great timing or luck, Angelo returned to their table with their orders. It smelled heavenly. John’s stomach turned, desperate for his first meal since the apple he had eaten earlier this morning before his shift at the clinic. John devoured his order eagerly. As he chewed he watched Sherlock eat. It was enlightening; a rare sight that showed Sherlock was human and not devoid of human needs. Even though he had witnessed Sherlock’s human side more than once, most of the time it was a battle to get him to eat one bite, especially on a case. Here, now, Sherlock was taking one bite after another like he couldn’t get enough. The candlelight reflected in Sherlock’s eyes, and undetectable to anyone but John, there was tiredness. Something nagged at the back of his head, the doctor part of him when he sees a patient; John cleared his throat.
“The spider has returned,” Sherlock stated hollowly.
John scoffed. “Yeah? You’re not as great as you think you are.”
“Breathe love.”
How much more could they take?
“Good,”- John inhaled deeply, recalling what he really wanted to say after the cab ride before he got too distracted with his newly rediscovered attraction for Sherlock. Before the temptation to touch completely overshadowed the conversation he needed to have with the man before him. Whatever expression that was on his face made Sherlock sigh loudly.
With that, Sherlock stalked away, with his collar upturned. John snorted and glanced back at Lestrade. “I’m taking that as a no. You better meet us there.”
“Sex, John. We should have sex.”
“I can’t be a hostage to the both of you.”
“Order more next time.”
Finish kissing, heart to heart, and the writer undoing a nasty bit of Season 4.
John turned around at that declaration and spoke into Sherlock’s throat, nosing at the bruise on the skin. His lips trailed over it as he retorted. “Noted. Sherlock Holmes prefers his doctor’s clean shaven.”
“Kind of difficult for me to say otherwise when you’re already in there,” John yelled after him. Sherlock probably ignored him again in favour of cleaning himself up. John was also looking forward to that, he did not want to walk around with pants stuck to his skin in dry semen all day. The bedroom fell silent after the last traces of his shouts drifted away. John glanced at Greg, and shook his head at the man.
“What is it?”
A/N: Please bookmark/comment/and kudos. They give me writing life!
“Did the suspect say something?”
“John.”
“Tea?”
John nodded. “Yes, text me if Sherlock shows up.”
“You’re planning to do something stupid.”
“How do you know him? It wasn’t me, no, I’ve taken preventive measures to defer your meeting even during the creation of the plan for my fake suicide…it had to be… it was through him, wasn’t it…they’re together?” Sherlock groaned, “Oh god, that was one deduction that I wished I hadn’t seen.”
John nodded again, smiling down at Sherlock. Sometime in their conversation, his hands had navigated upwards, cupping around Sherlock’s cheekbones. His roughened fingertips barely caressed the still smooth skin. It seemed that he was doing the aging for the both of them. Sherlock still had youth on his face with few lines drawn to make himself look older. It wasn’t noticeable at all really. The detective sitting before him was a gorgeous man.
The video went silent again. But John could see Hageman shook his head in refusal. The angles jerked crazily, and another scream followed. John hadn’t like him. Hageman was a criminal, an arse, and a psychopath that killed four people without remorse. But torture was too much, especially when the man was broken enough already. John was about to pause the video when the earsplitting screams stopped into heavy breathing.

John absolutely did not like the sound of falling asleep. Yes, he was tired from the early morning crime scene and the two whacks on his head earlier didn’t help, but this was the opposite of sleep. He wasn’t sure if he should be aroused with Sherlock ordering him about. It would be quite a scene when they are out on a care, or when he ordered John to make him tea.
A/N: So what did you guys think? Please leave a comment/bookmark and/or kudos!
“You tried. You were wrong.”
“I’m in the tub, remember?”
“What is it?”
“Why?”
John hummed. “I don’t like that answer. Do better.”
“We’ll be out in a moment,” stated Sherlock. “John.”
“Fear has a distinctive features on a person’s face and the body is hardwired to react to it with chemicals fixed in our biology. It’s a horrible mechanism that can betray even the bravest of men. Your face, right now, is radiating fear, no longer that false bravado you portrayed earlier. No, I believe that you’re being cohered into relaying this message, the punishment of failure would be your life. Am I wrong?”
Chapter 23
A muffled chime sounded from nearby. John blinked, remembering that Sherlock’s mobile was sandwiched between them. He jumped to a stand. His hands fixed over his towel as Sherlock sat up from the couch with his phone in hands. Pale fingers flew over the buttons while he spoke.
“Good.” grinned John flirtatiously. His hand ran through his wet hair, carding his fingers backwards. “You had me worried for a second there.”
“Sherlock…” any other words that John had, escaped him as he pulled the detective upwards with a gentle hand around the sculpted features. Sherlock followed the pressure willingly. John sighed when he saw Sherlock, prismatic eyes closed, and face shocked, like the last bit was a confession of sort, an accidental deduction that he discovered about himself. John didn’t care. Intentional or not, he closed the distance, bringing that full, soft mouth to his.
John smiled at Sherlock, and placed his left hand on Sherlock’s knee. He curled his right arm on the sofa. His fingers glided in soft slow tantalising circles, relishing the heat, and the solid feel of Sherlock under his hand. There was a spike of pride when Sherlock shivered underneath his touch.
Looking at his best friend, John grew serious. His doctor eyes roamed over the tightness around Sherlock’s eyes. Taking in the subtle twitches in Sherlock’s hands. The rather grey-sickly looking complexion compared to a healthy pale.
John grinned. “He was thanking me. Apparently I was still on the phone with him when I ran back to the flat to find you.”
“What the hell is your problem?!” John bellowed. “I thought we were done!”

“John.”
John pulled away from studying over the last victim in the one-way street. A spread of people hovered near the police barricades in the light rain. The presence of the Yarders seemingly gathered a larger crowd than when they arrived. Perhaps the crime scene was more exciting compared to youth party days. It was only a matter of time before the reporters caught wind of a triple murder. At least- the Yarders caught their shooter, and Sherlock got to look over the crime scene before it was contaminated.
“I’ll have to make a note of it for later. Not that I’m complaining, but what brought this on?” John motioned to Sherlock in his lap. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for a bit of snogging.”
John stopped in midsentence when he turned his head towards the cabbie. He found a recognizable Sebastian Moran behind the wheel. One hand was actually on the wheel, while the other hand had a gun aimed in John’s direction. A lit cigarette hung from his lips as he grinned, pushing the other front door open for John.
“People might talk then, John.”
John cleared his throat and coughed to cover the huff of laughter that bubbled from his throat when he met Sherlock’s eyes. The look plainly told him, ‘I told you so’. Remembering that Sherlock had deduced Mrs. Hudson had been showering them in biscuits because she had lost Sherlock’s engagement ring in a game of cards. John nearly started laughing again; his shoulders were jiggling with effort not to laugh. Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked away.
“From what?”
Then Sherlock took off briskly, leaving John scrambling for his wallet to pay the fare, cursing about tall, git detectives in stupid coats. Then he chased after him. Again. Wondering what the hell he had meant by that.
Lestrade grimaced, as if John’s question caused him actual physical pain. John pressed forward and added. “I’m not going to believe that she’s dead unless I go check. I’m a doctor, I have to help!”
The End.
Chapter 34
“John?”
“Just like that?”
“I don’t rely on him. I annoy him.”

“You sure do rely on him awful lot. Do you think you’ll progress beyond the arch enemy, sibling rivalry, into older brother view yet?”
“Interesting.”
John roamed his eyes over the criminal, estimating in his head the other man’s height Jack Ripper was only a wee bit taller than himself. Essentially, his wife would have found him unattractive as well. Oh, how badly John wanted to say that aloud, but he knew it was only going to make him look insecure. It wasn’t like John had turned into an insecure little baby at the mention of his height, but one can occasionally be sensitive about it.
Lestrade waved him off, and sighed. “I’ll be there. Go on.”
“Distraction from my wife’s murder?” he repeated in a tone of disbelief. “Why?”
“Before or after you changed your linens?”
“I wouldn’t say useless, since I figured out that you have a third sibling, and all. Mycroft tried to lie about it. But you do have a third sibling out there, somewhere. You’ll have to talk to him about it.”
“I don’t remember attending primary school this morning. Quit bullying him for letting him do your job because you can’t,” he murmured lowly.
Glowering at Sherlock, John murmured. “I don’t care about finding leads. I’m a bloody doctor; I know the different between ‘taking’ and ‘using’, Sherlock. You are using drugs…” he paused, and hummed again before continuing lowly, -“you don’t need them to be brilliant, fantastic or any other way I’ve described you...how have you…I should have seen the signs.”
He gave Mrs. Hudson the mobile with Sherlock’s voice still calling for him. It took everything he had to walk away and not turn back, heading for the door. “Mycroft’s people will be here soon to take you back to Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson. Mary… do make sure your leg is seen to and have a nice life.”
“My wife always thought you were clever…She was a big follower of your gay blog. Said it was romantic. She also said it helped that you were easy on the eyes to make up for your arsehole personality. Want to know what I think?”
“Bingo! Now what do you think about this? Clever, isn’t it?” Moriarty motioned over to the pool.
“Well…that’s a bit new.”
Thank you for reading!
“His underwear.”
He pinched at the bridge of his nose in frustration. Then John sighed when he thought of something. It would make sense really. “Let me guess, Mycroft? You know, I’m not even going to ask. But did you ever think that I maybe wanted to get divorced in my own time?”
John reached for Sherlock. He didn’t have to reach very far, because Sherlock met him halfway. John brushed the hair from Sherlock’s face with a grin. Sherlock’s smiled back, seemingly brighter than the afternoon sun. It was the face of a man who knew how much he’s loved. It was a face no one else will ever get to see, except for John. It was the face of a self-declared sociopath finally finding his heart, and finally seeing a future not alone.
Something pushed at the middle of his back, and John stubbornly remained as he was. Until something kicked him, a boot, judging from the impact on his ribs. He went to eat a mouthful of carpet, blessed that Mrs. Hudson did hover every day.
Lestrade groaned. He rubbed a hand over his face, “Their fingerprints are getting programed into the system. We’ll know more once we have their names.”
“You cold and calculative-”
John looked over the edge of the front counter, gun at the ready, expecting either an enemy or a victim. It was clear. No one was tuckered away in order to get the jump on him. For now. No bodies either, lying in the well-worn carpet, oozing blood or bone. Not even a vacant stare that came with them. John turned left going over the carpeted floor, and past several dark offices before reaching the pool entrance. Memories from their last visit here flooded through his veins, reliving the emotions he felt when they left this building with all their limbs, and alive.
John grabbed Sherlock’s sleeve again, halting the taller man. “What are you going to do? Burst in there, making demands? Deduct the secretary until she slaps you then storms out? Propose again?” John remarked darkly. There was an unsettling twist in his stomach as he recalled that particular moment in their lives.
Jack Ripper spoke, his raspy tone carried in the space. “Sherlock Holmes, I was wondering when you would show up. You look taller in your photographs.”
John ignored Sherlock, and only stared at the object on the bedside table. Sherlock continued to complain as he pulled the sheet over his face, “John, seems like you don’t have the same goals as I do.”
His name again and the ‘take me’. He’d hope that it was referring to taking the phone rather than whoever had planted it. Someone knew that he was going to be here. John hated that. Predicting his every move like he was some piece on a chessboard. He was a human being for god’s sake, not something predictable to be in someplace, at the right time, hours in advance. John stuffed the other note away, joining the first in the pocket.
Then he grimaced. Another murderer? Another person, John meant. Hating that he sounded cold. These were people’s lives. It was just that he hoped that it would be a simple one, not increasing the probability of a serial killer was roaming about. Something easily solved so they could get back their case.
“One condition!”
“And if I refuse?” Sherlock’s eyes lit up, and then narrowed at John. “I see.”
“When? I though you were getting undressed.”
John didn’t pause at the door; instead he pushed it open and walked inside. There was some pride in interrupting Mycroft. He partly expected Sherlock to be in the bed. How terribly injured would he be if he were insulting the hospital staff? Who knew how many people have come across Sherlock, tried to tend to his injuries but instead had gotten sliced by his sharp mouth. He was also verbally sparring with Mycroft- all good signs?
John’s eyebrows met his hairline, already fiddling the knob of the bedside table. He found a bottle of used lubrication and a new box of condoms. Throwing the items next to him in bed, he motioned for Sherlock to come closer.
“If you must,” Sherlock replied, making a beeline to the microscope with the post its notes and mobile in hand.
John decided that he would have to say something to Greg about what Sherlock and himself were now, sooner rather than later. He immediately missed Sherlock’s body heat next to him in bed, and John knew that his longing was probably obvious. It probably always had been.
“And Patrick Dubar?” asked John, pulling out his notebook for crime scenes. It was helpful to have references for when he typed up the case on the blog later. That, and Sherlock never quite kept track of the victims in any of their cases; it was John’s job.
John ignored the detective and cast a look over his shoulder at the DI, who looked somewhat bemused at their exchange.
“His what?”
He would have this.
“We don’t have time for a new plan.”
“My wife, Megan, thought you were a bit short for her. It’s a very unattractive trait in a man.”
“Good.”
Sighing, John reiterated what he could remember from his conversation with Mycroft. He licked his bottom lip, stared out into the fireplace on the flickering embers, dying but still illumined the floor around.  He was now tempted to get that drink he brushed off earlier, while recalling that Sherlock’s jump from Bart’s rooftop. They had both gone through hell, and after the whole ordeal, he was going to tell Sherlock that the man who drove him to ‘fall’ might still be alive.
The name that he knew her by seemed so foreign now, much like the woman that he had sworn to have the rest of his life with. It seemed long ago now. “Or, should I call you, Rose now?”
“I could ask you the same thing.”
“You weren’t joking.”
John rolled his eyes, and cursed his annoying git for not listening. Because of course when had Sherlock Holmes had ever followed instructions, especially John’s? It was infuriating. Sherlock always had to be the one in charge…not this time. John was going to keep his infuriating love safe… even if it’s the only time.
The inspector shook his head, pausing, “I…don’t…I wasn’t paying attention. How important is the color of the walls?”
It was time.
He marched over the pavement, turning around the corner into the busy main road. John stared straight ahead, soldiering on through the gawkers who glanced over his rather odd uniform. Sherlock’s blue dressing gown caught into the chill breeze, undoubtedly showing off the gun that John had tucked away in the small of his back into the stolen too-tight trousers. The many gasps told him he was a sight. John broke his stance for a second, and his eyes flickered over to a store window. His uniform was a sight all right, but more so was the purpling bruise across his jaw, and crawled up his cheek.
John gritted his teeth together. “I was called into the clinic.”
“I…my gun…I was going to…” John motioned with his hand. He doubled over, holding his ribs as he laughed.
John licked his lips, as his will was tested when long legs parted for him to perch between. Not a part of him touched Sherlock. John kept on his knees, not daring to push his hardness against Sherlock. He wasn’t there for pleasure, but to get Sherlock to understand. He didn’t know if the detective would, considering that Sherlock was moving to undo his trousers. He placed his hands on each side of Sherlock’s head, being careful not to catch a curl underneath, bringing their faces at an even level. John exhaled, meeting vivid green eyes from below. “That’s quite enough. Keep your trousers on.”
John propped himself up on his elbow to glare at Sherlock. “You didn’t have to kick me, Sherlock!”
Sherlock didn’t comment.
There was a honk from behind him as John answered loudly. “Does it look like I got the time?”
John paused in the small clinic room; he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Was he still using his mind palace when you came in? Did you say anything that might have triggered a-”
John laughed lightly. The pounding in his heart was no longer of panic, but of lightness, of complete and utter relief to finally have those words out in the open between them. He covered Sherlock’s hand with his own. “You’ve probably deduced it long before me, Sherlock.”
The detective stepped out his trousers and pants. John watched, licked his lips and swallowed heavily when Sherlock crawled above him, creaking under their combined weight. He stayed hovering above John, knees brushing the side of John’s hips. John held the bottle of lube, about to coat his fingers to help Sherlock when the taller man grabbed his wrists and pinned it to the side, all while shaking his head wildly.
John rolled his eyes at the beginning traces of Sherlock’s sulking. It wouldn’t last long, and would disappear as soon as they arrived at the scene. Three murders, and a suspect that would only talk to Sherlock; something still didn’t set right. He could only hope that the feeling in his gut was wrong. Even if the same gut feeling told him that it was wrong, trying to be wrong.
John grimaced. “Pleasant.”
“Explain what Mycroft wanted. Tell me everything.”
Sherlock’s mouth tilted upwards. “Does my health meet your standards, Doctor? Or are you going to expound further upon about my prismatic eyes?”
“You’ve known that for years.”
The slight ‘pop’ of Sherlock’s lips made John jump, recalling ‘The Incident’ as he called it in his head. He pushed away from the counter, slowly migrated around the table to the hallway. “I’m going to take a bath then.”
“Hello,” she greeted shyly, her fingers played with her long hair. “I’m sorry if I made your friend uncomfortable. I’m not typically that forward, but would you like to go back inside for dinner, well you’ve had dinner, but a drink then?”
Sherlock ignored him, turned around and asked, “Why not?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and whispered, “As you know, proposing to Janine was necessary to get through his security, and as you probably recall, the miscalculation in that plan didn’t end too well for me. Now, it is hardly necessary, and would do more damage in harassment, and attracting security than finding the schedules to make progress in this case. Besides,” he added as an afterthought, “I don’t have the ring anymore. I gave it to Mrs. Hudson.”
“You don’t fancy to tackle the killer yourself?”
“It’s not hesitation this time. It’s decisiveness.” Her voice pierced through the silence. There was a little quiver, but laced with hardness.
Then Sherlock closed the distance. John protested against the insisting mouth. His hand shoved at Sherlock’s shoulder. Breathlessly, John broke away and fled, squeezing himself close to the other side of the cab as he could go. His mouth buzzed from the contact. His body craved for more. There was a hum of lust under his skin, along with anger. His eyes roamed over Sherlock’s smug face.
“I’m apparently not going anywhere anytime soom. Might as well have a chat. Let’s start with why are Mrs. Hudson and I tied up like hostage instead of having a civil conversation over a cuppa? Or we could talk about where the hell is my daughter? Or we can even start at the beginning, yeah? Where the hell have you disappeared off to?”
“Then you can wait a bit more.”
Sherlock pointed to the body.
“So you’re thinking we retrace the girls’ steps, and we’ll find the crime scene?”
“You killed them just to send me a clue?”
“No, I didn’t do it! Don’t like getting my hand dirty in that mess. They had a choice and they killed themselves. I just watched. Now, speaking of Sherlock…”
Greg nodded. “Well, they are mobile for a reason…we’ve got another one.”
Oh god yes, he was.
A silence hung between them. John didn’t want it to come to this. Hell, it would’ve been easier if Mary hadn’t appeared back into their lives at all. But here they were, a divorced, bloody train wreck. He swallowed the lump in his throat. “I wish it hadn’t come to this, Mary.”
“Of course. Don’t be daft.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but his attempt at pretending to be annoyed was futile. He couldn’t wipe the lust from his eyes, and smile from his face. And of course, when one is impaled on another’s cock, there’s really no way to pretend.
John dove into the black bag. He found another loaded 9mm Beretta pistol that seemed promising. He also found two Smith & Wesson’ Model 66 Combat Magnum Revolvers, which made him roll his eyes. All he would need with that would be a cowboy hat and challenge Moriarty to a dusty gunslinger fast draw. There was also a pump-action Mossberg Maverick 88 Shotgun that John wouldn’t mind keeping at the end of all this. That is if he was alive and well at the end of all this. Lastly, there was a Savage 10 BA Stealth action rifle, with its scope. The rest of bag had a hodgepodge of ammunition, accessories for wear and cleaning.
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock or any other variations.
“For God’s sakes.”
John retorted breathlessly, mirth echoed in his voice. He flickered his eyes down, motioning to his toes barely touching the floor. “Is that what you’re trying to do? It seems like you are trying to decapitate me instead.”
“Perhaps with a bit more tact, Lestrade.”
“You’re the one who bought the lucky cat for me. And technically, I didn’t gift you a death threat, it wasn’t on our list this year. Someone else did, and I just found it. We have 48 hours to find this Issac Spoo bloke or you are dead. We shouldn’t be happy about this.”
John ignored the befuddled expression on Greg’s face in favour of following the detective inspector downstairs. It was quiet without Mrs. Hudson’s radio. The landing downstairs was also dim in her missing presence. The cream colored wallpaper was a grey from the fading light outside. John stared at Greg’s silver hair; much like his, and in a year or two, John’s would be completely silver. They were too old for this primary school business. They were also much too old to be pointing fingers accusingly at each other. Though the visual did want to make John laugh at bit. John heard a snort of laughter from in front of him.
“I’m sorry.” And she did sound a bit sorry.
“Fuck. Sherlock. You’re so tight... so …perfect!” He pushed a few more times with every word, riding out both of their orgasms before he finally collapsed onto Sherlock, face on chest, chest on Sherlock’s stomach, and the detective’s hand still holding his softening cock in between them.
“What did you do?” asked John.
John wished he could see Sherlock’s face. “When did they happen?”
The detective inspector shook his silvered-head, with a grin on his face, his hands waving innocently in front of him. “I don’t know what you mean.”
He couldn’t tell if they were breathing. He couldn’t tell if either person had a healthy flush to their skin because of the blue light. But there was something about their stillness that told John they were both dead.
Sherlock shook his head. “There will be plenty of other times. Just the bed, for now. I need to prepare myself.”
“Both victims were first years taking general education courses. We’ll follow their schedules and investigate their classrooms.”

China clinked together when Sherlock set down his teacup. “I’m composing.”
The detective drew back with a visible flinch, grey eyes rolled, and his mouth moved into a frown before talking in silence again. John tracked the movement, picking up the words, ‘loud’, ‘deaf’ and ‘gun’. Sherlock’s mouth moved again, John only assumed that Sherlock was calling him an idiot or something of the sort.
“You’re a good man, John Watson. I know you’ll make the right choice.”
The taller man began to grin madly and stepped away from John. Sherlock stalked into the sitting room, pacing as he spoke.
He walked closer to the man, close enough to be sure the second bullet would do the job that the first one didn’t. He didn’t aim for the head, but aimed for the heart. It had to be in Moriarty’s chest. Then perhaps, he would put another one in the head.
He reached for the bedside lamp, and switched it on.
“After listening to everything? You’re just going to turn him away?”
“You could say that you have them memorised because you love me.”
“I see. I will get my people on it.”
John was being careful of the injured knuckles that somehow lost their bandages and kissed it.
Instead, John cleared his throat. “Still in a rush?”
His bed creaked. John’s eyes bolted open. In either utter horror or fascination, he stared at Sherlock as he propped on the singular pillow. Someone had been busy and stripped himself from his dressing gown and black dress shirt while John was trying to reason internally. The taller man was a sharp contrast of dark hair with vivid pale skin, black trousers against white bedding. He was  a vision of light, the sparkling city lights from the window danced over Sherlock’s skin. He was a part of the dark shadows within the room, from the disappeared sun to the dark hair. Pale, violinist fingers laced with those curls. The abrasion on Sherlock’s arm stood out like a darkened line. He was a dream of seduction in black and white.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
“How do you know it’s not the professor?” he asked, hoping that it would be that easy to avoid this.
“Sherlock’s not your only brother, there’s another one isn’t there?” John questioned in disbelief.

“John-”
“Then it must be something else. Are you alright? Are you in pain?”
“From the grieving mother,” Sherlock stated softly. John stiffened before he focused on making breakfast the way that he knew that Sherlock would eat it. It had completely slipped his mind last night that he wasn’t the only one affected. That he may have blurred the lines between his nightmares and reality, but losing that infant was someone else’s complete reality.
John turned his head, finding Sherlock’s eyes closed, mouth slightly agape. It was then when the detective let out a soft snore and John shook his head. Unbelievable. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. And once more, John got up, slowly pulled his softened member out while holding onto the condom. After a quick knot and the condom properly disposed of, he fetched a flannel from the bathroom and gingerly tended to Sherlock.
Well, it wasn’t a comfort now. John closed his eyes. Red beams flickering over Sherlock in the bright floodlight. His palms up in the air. Mycroft’s voice shouting. His own surprise. His eyes couldn’t leave Sherlock’s as he was tackled to the ground after killing Magnussen. Their eyes were still connected as Sherlock was taken away. The longest week, waiting to hear good news that only ended in a goodbye. John clenched his jaw. He couldn’t lose him a fourth time.
The camera nudged a little, as if the person behind it was encouraging Mr. Hageman. The voice was a bit uneven, reminded John of someone talking with his or her mouth full. There was a sound of a flick, and smoke drifted into the frame. Whoever it was, they smoked.
A/N: I hope you guys enjoy this chapter. It was fun to write. Thank you for all the comments and everything else. I don't know anything about guns, so all the names and everything was picking off of a gun site. I'm sorry if anything is wrong and please let me know about it. Thank you beta Whitehart for looking over this chapter.
“As you like reminding everyone,” John retorted. He shivered from the wet clothes, shrugged off his coat and stood. He walked across the flat, heading for his room upstairs. “I’m going to go get changed because for some reason I ran all over London in the rain.”
“There are lots of reasons why people would drink at midday. Frankly, those types of people could have the most interesting stories.”
With that, John silently followed Lestrade as he took point across the short yard, up the steps leading to the door. It creaked open when Lestrade pushed it in with his toe. They were greeted with the view of a wooden staircase to right, and a grey corridor on the left that led deeper into the house. John glanced at Lestrade, wondering which way he should investigate. He got his answer when Lestrade nodded towards the staircase. The detective inspector’s torch flickered at the stairs. John took the hint and went. Lestrade disappeared in seconds, scouting out the lower level.
“Of course not.”
“How do I know they’re dead?”
He would play verbal sparring if it got Mycroft off of Sherlock’s back about them. Everyone in this room knew that Mycroft was a ‘concerned’ older brother. He didn’t need to prove it every time John shared single space with Sherlock. It was just getting embarrassing at this point.
“To the university. I know the Dean- owes me a favor. Lestrade and the rest of the officers may have to wait for paperwork, but I don’t. We’ll look over their schedules faster.”
“You’re breaking his heart, John Watson,” Mrs. Hudson called after him.
The door clicked closed before he could protest.
John resisted the urge to wink at the Sherlock. After all, he was a professional doctor when it came to tending his patients…except for when Sherlock unfolds his long limbs, and spread out to frame John, like he did now to give John more access to his injuries. His memory recalled the last time they were in this position. Even with a blush, John moved to work on the cut on Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock’s voice trailed off when John grabbed Sherlock’s right arm. He pushed up the black suit jacket, unbuckled the cuff at the pale wrist, and pulled the silver shirt away. Quickly, John began pouring over every vein, inspecting for discoloration, blemishes, anything that looked fresh. He moved to the other arm. Both arms were perfect, fitting, somehow, for the man in front him. After checking every vein, John tilted Sherlock’s face up towards him. Green eyes were wide as John studied them. They looked clear, calculating, and fully Sherlock.
Shaking his head purposely, John sent more water sprinkling over Sherlock’s face.
“Well, that explains that. What about the missing mobile numbers then?” John asked.
“Are you alright?” John asked.
“You would think that he would have better things to do other than spying on us.”
This time, the worry was familiar, in the older sibling protectiveness. It was very same worry that John had felt with Harry, when she would bring new girlfriends home. He snorted, and laughed. John couldn’t help it, knowing now what he was on the receiving end of.
“So being pregnant, you thought it was a fantastic idea to stage a rescue mission?”
“Sherlock Holmes,” wheezed Hageman. He wiped his nose on his sleeve, and made an audible hiss at the contact. With Sherlock’s name, it seemed the man had straightened upwards in the corner from the huddled lump of mass he was earlier. The change in his posture might be a reflection of some pride left even after taking the physical beating, or he was still pissed at Sherlock… not that they would ever find out. Mr. Hageman’s body was cold in his holding cell at New Scotland Yard.
“Lestrade needs us. Two bodies found.”
“That is the idea,” John remarked in the same tone as if they were talking about the weather. “Only if you’re up for it.”
“Shouts,” he finished flatly.
“An oversight.”
“You have no idea,” smiled John as he nodded in farewell. He started down the corridor and checked his phone. Instead of going after the lift, he pushed open the door leading into the stairs. The grey metal banged loudly when it closed behind him. Then John was greeted with wooly blue vision as his jumper collided with his face before falling into his arms.
“Take me to bed, John.”
John gave Moriarty a cold stare. “Sherlock.”
“I wanted a normal life, a boring life. You couldn’t have given me that once Sherlock was back in your life.”
“Or what happens?”
“Oh Christ.”
Before John could finish asking, Sherlock walked through the door with his palms up in air in surrender. John cursed lowly as he watched Sherlock smiled pleasantly, walking away from the doorway and disappearing out of his sight. The only comfort that he had was the continued sound of Sherlock’s voice.
A/N: Hello all! Thank you for all the feedback! And happy pre-Halloween if you celebrate it and if not, happy day in general to everyone. Thank you my beta Whitehart for cleaning this chapter up. It's so much better now.
“Well, that’s good to know.” John was relieved to know that there were no witnesses of his own private time. Both inside the bedroom and out of it. Then he added, “So, what happens now? Someone was in our flat, what do we do about it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Moriarty motioned to the pool. “People die all the fucking time, get over it!”
But it was finally happening. They are now together after running circles around each other for years, and they were here.
He couldn’t help but to grin. John echoed, “I’ve heard that people do little else.”
Moran frowned. “Yeah, I figured that.”
“Two ideas.”

“Death threat. That text was much better than the lucky cat you gifted before.”
Sherlock placed his violin aside, and leaned forward. Darkened curls brushed over a pale forehead as calculative eyes narrowed. “Mycroft has been trying to get me clean for months, John. What are you going to do that he hasn’t?”
“Did Sherlock say where he was going?”
John felt his stomach sink. He resisted the urge to look back at Sherlock, to see what kind of face he presented. He wondered if it was still the smile that they shared moments ago. Instead of looking back, John pursued his lips together, in the pressing silence as Greg took in the scene. John ignored the uncomfortable pull at his pants. They should have cleaned up before falling asleep, and then maybe they wouldn’t have been caught together. He shook his head, that wasn’t it. He wasn’t ashamed. There was no possible scenario in which John would leave Sherlock alone in his bed, not after what they had done together. It was a step forward, finally in the right direction.
“Opened eyes,” answered Sherlock finally. John stepped away and flopped back into his chair. He shook his head, furrowing his brow. “You know, if you were trying to sound cryptic as hell just then, you succeeded.”
“That’s something you’ll need to talk to Mycroft about. Did you know that he’s blackmailing me?”
“Tell him, it’s not here.”
John sighed, his head pounded from the caffeine, which was not working fast enough. “He plans his fixes around my schedule. He’s been getting high while I’ve been working. I’m putting a stop to it.”
He stepped deeper into the room, glancing down into the boxes.  There were landscape pictures, rich in pinks, blues and purples, knick-knacks, and even a box full of women’s shoes. John stepped around the women’s blouses littered around the room from boxes that had been tipped over. He made his way through the mess and checked the small wardrobe in the corner, which was empty. Besides the mess, the room was clear.
Before John could finish, Sherlock bolted from the sofa. John watched as Sherlock through the door, and noisy footfalls echoed up the wooden stairs. John quickly followed. He walked through the doorway and was bombarded by the taller man in seconds.
“Do you-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you think?”
“Just keep your eyes open.”
“I’m dripping on you?” John repeated in disbelief, he pulled Sherlock’s mobile phone out from his pocket and dropped on Sherlock’s chest. “I was in the bath! You could have gotten it on your own! It was in your pocket!”
“You had dinner last night.”
John just nodded at Mrs. Hudson words as she moved back to the table and started to pour the tea. He didn’t dare to argue against his landlady/not his housekeeper. “I’ll be sure to get a cuppa when I’ll get back, Mrs. Hudson. I’m off to get our take-out.”
Silence fell in the cab again, leaving John to think. Moriarty was doing something big, apparently. Which may or may not end with death. John needed a plan, a weapon, and a way to get the advantage over Moriarty, however difficult that may be. As John sat, thinking, he stared at Moran’s fingers dancing to the beat on the steering wheel.
“Well, it’s a good thing I missed him,” John stated, while casting an apologetic glance at Greg.
“You’re bisexual, not straight,” Sherlock countered with a grin. “I could have told you that years ago.”
“Yes, we could have, but it was about to rain.”
“What are you going on about, Sherlock?”
“I would’ve loved to.”
He could feel the heat of Sherlock’s hand sweltering into his skin. The embrace they were in now felt absolutely right. It was what they had needed, more than they care to admit, more than they have ever shared with one another. And it had been waiting to happen.
“Almost as important as the color of the suitcase,” John muttered lowly.
“Though, none of my favourites. You could safely take the horrid green one that Harry sent me last year. I think it’s the one you referred to as an abomination.” His fingers trailed into the light spatter of hair on Sherlock’s chest, then lightly brushed over one of Sherlock’s nipples. He chuckled lightly when the detective hummed and threw his head back, extending his pale long neck. John pressed a kiss to the darkened bruise he left earlier.
He tried to look at the scene like Sherlock would. The barest of colour came from the faded painted apple tree in the corner. It reminded John of the baby’s nursery that Mary picked out. Apples, or whatever fruit were supposedly a new trend- according to her. John didn’t care either way then. But seeing the apple tree tugged on his heartstrings... not a good time. He swallowed the lump in his throat.
A/N: Here's another update! Yay! Thank you to my awesome beta Whitehart, as usual.
“Oh? Did we? I must have missed that part of the conversation while you were gone, it’s difficult to talk about baby names when you’ve been wherever the fuck you have been the last two months, Mary.”
“He probably wanted to send his car.”
“You were dripping on me!”
“Because men like you love the prospect of power. Thrive on taking control of others. You work at a high rate company judging by your suit and watch. I can easily conclude that you are in a position of power in your work, therefore have control over your employees. That fixes in your urges at work but at home, that want of control is severely lost. You set your wife to be murdered as we speak, but not with the motivation of love since your wedding band has been removed but indention line still remains, so it had to be recently removed-“
Moments later, Sherlock appeared out of his bedroom, wearing a white shirt replacing the black one. The dark curls were smothered to perfection. The only sign that Sherlock had been completely rumpled by John was Sherlock’s mouth, still puffy from their kissing. John fumbled through the rest of the order. His eyes flickered between the menu in his hand and Sherlock. John was torn between the two until the detective sat down at the kitchen table before his beloved microscope.
“Ah. Well, yes it is.”
“I need more data. I need more information!”
“I was surprised to see Sherlock letting me in. It’s usually Mrs. Hudson but Sherlock had said something that she escaped for the night, gossiping about the two of you would…get…together.”
“Rewind it.”
When he walked onto the rooftop, he paused in his steps taking in the scene. The suspect stood on the edge of the building. The baby squirmed in a bundle in the free hand. He swallowed heavily when he noticed the gun was focused on Sherlock. It was always Sherlock at the wrong end of the gun. He could see her face, pointing a gun at him, thinking that he was Sherlock in their trap. The baby cried.
John shifted in Sherlock’s bed, knowing that he was right. They both had scars, both physical and mental. He refused to glance at the angry skin littering his left shoulder.
“Sherlock?” he questioned evenly, his eyes peering around the corner, looking for the target that seemed no longer keen on staying alive by John’s judgment. He was expecting to see Sherlock, lying in a pool of blood again, grey and barely breathing. Expecting his name to be called out as Sherlock bled out, as the detective did when he was in trouble. As he always did. Through his mind flashed memories of pale hands grabbing for him as Sherlock went into cardiac arrest. The desperation in Sherlock’s voice. The sense of panic growing, wondering if Sherlock was…
“John? Are you awake?”
“John…” Someone’s calling my name.
“Promise?”
He pressed the ‘on’ button and leaned back on the counter, glancing at Sherlock when a witty retort never came. John fixated on pale fingers delicately twisting the knobs. Sherlock’s face was set in the utmost focus; probably going unnoticed that John was looking him over, checking him out in a sense. He exhaled, flushing from what he just thought, from what he remembered, from how his body reacted.
John snorted. “I don’t fancy the idea that Mycroft’s cronies are going to be looking in on me. There’ll be no privacy.”
“You should know that feeling of grief, and I wish you didn’t. I can never apologise enough for what I did. But do keep your hands off your life. It is not your own, and I do not wish to be left behind. And in trade, my life belongs to you. I will never leave you behind under any circumstances. I swear it. Never.”
“That was unnecessary.” His hair bounced around, wet curls in an adorable mess.
“Moriarty’s only weakness, or so he said, was his ability to change his mind. He had done it once at the pool. He had done it just now with my death threat and Issac Spoo. He’ll do it again, I’m certain of it.”
He fished his phone from his coat. Then groaned when read over the text message. A white lab coat brushed against his arm. “What’s the matter?”
He walked into the kitchen, and dug into the salad drawer for the menus. As he looked for their favorite menu, John wondered about Sherlock.
Sherlock whispered in his ear. “This interrogation room is shut down from water damage at the end of hall. You’ve seen the closed signs, John.”
Sighing, he rubbed his forehead with his sweaty palm and lowered his face to the floor. This nervous habit of his … it’s bad. He knew it would send Sherlock mixed signals.
John’s words trailed off while he looked around. Dark grey room carried slim light coming from the small window a bit higher up than normal windows. They were most likely held in a basement. There was one wooden door at the far wall without a doorknob. It wasn’t as if he could get over there to see if it was locked.
The brown haired man sighed and nodded. His head bobbed like it was the only action he could manage at this point. His eyes fell to his lap again. “Yeah. She had a row with her girlfriend, and was upset that she was getting mixed into that kind of scene.”
“I thought you would want to take the more masculine position.”
Her hand held onto John’s shoulder. “Sorry, dear,” she whispered behind him.
John hummed into the kiss when Sherlock’s arms encircled around him, tracing his long fingers along John’s back. His vest wrinkled upon the pressure of Sherlock’s fingertips. John could feel the warmth of those hands over his back, burning into his skin underneath.
John smirked, then smiled. “Flowers all look the same, except the colors. I’m sure I’ve never seen a tree leaf like that around London. It seemed similar to palm trees in Afghanistan.”
“Hardly, and this was your idea. Now, hold your arms out. I need someplace to rest my clothes.”
When Sherlock finally stopped, John glanced over the other crime scene possibility. White bricks reflected the sun like snow. Shutters were bright blue, unlike the usual sky in London. Rainbow lights flickered in the upper frame of the large bay windows and were the only light source within the darkened pub. John didn’t bother reading over the business hours this time. Instead he followed Sherlock as he rounded the corner of the building hidden away from the main street. John grabbed the door handle and jiggled it. It was locked.
John did consider that. Hell, he knew that the hospital was right around the corner. They’ve been there often enough with the serious injuries that couldn’t be tended to at the flat, and that speaks for how often they get injured. He could see the gaggle of women, stumbling across the road, disturbing the route of traffic.
The inspector took it readily, already sipping at the heated beverage. “Ta. I’m on my last leg here. I hadn’t heard from Sherlock every hour or two like I usually do. I was wondering if he had thought of anything.”
John aimed his gun at the other dark corner of the room, and found a glint of metal aiming back at him through the shadows. John stepped into the light, still pointing the gun in that direction.
John interrupted, cutting her off. “You’re relying on me, now?” he asked incredulously. “What happen to this piss two months ago, Mary?”
His mobile buzzed within his pocket again as John stared at Sherlock. “It is?”
Sherlock’s hand left his hip, and motioned to the gun. Wordlessly, John clicked the safety on and handed the gun to Sherlock, who took it gingerly out his hand.
He probably didn’t warn Sherlock as low as he should have or imagined, because Greg turned his head and looked at him with those eyes. Ones that considered him harmless before considering that he could also be dangerous too. John was a doctor and a captain in the army, taught to heal and destroy. John knew that Greg was a good inspector, regardless of what Sherlock said most of the time, and a good friend. Sherlock’s information didn’t look all that surprising on Greg’s face, but almost like he considered it before. Maybe, he already knew- it would explain a lot- how John still had his illegal firearm and no one has pursued the cabbie’s case.
“We had a car in the area,” argued the DI, then his face morphed in a frown after realizing what he just said.
A sense of accusations lingered in the air around Greg that he was on Mycroft’s side that Greg knew Mycroft was trying to blackmail him, even knowing about the third Holmes, and Moriarty. There was even the suspicion that Greg was sent there in order to persuade John to keep his mouth shut. His anger wanted him to leap out of red chair, cross the distance, grab Greg’s shoulders and shake him out of Sherlock’s chair for answers. In fact, the only words that John traded with Greg were about take out, and whether or not the detective inspector wanted any. He did not. He might’ve been pissed at him, but John didn’t want to be rude. Well, he hadn’t made tea for anyone, so, he was still rude. Did he feel bad? Not quite. His anger overruled his need to be accommodating. Spite in the small doses, apparently.
The hands gripped tight around his hips, and tugged. John pulled himself closer to Sherlock’s body, stepping between opened legs. John sealed his lips on Sherlock’s, opening the mouth under him to explore Sherlock’s taste with his tongue. His hands dove into the inky curls. John pulled gently at the strands, and he swallowed Sherlock’s moans. His hips burned with need when Sherlock’s hands moved across bared skin. John didn’t notice that his tucked jumper had been carefully removed from his trousers. He broke the kiss with a breathy chuckle and a moan of surprise when Sherlock’s hands came over his arse, kneading into the firm muscle.
“You should wear gloves because of your hands.”
“Have Mycroft finish the job.”
A/N: Angst. Oh, it hurts.
“Need anything else?”
Live Nudes In Charcoal
A/N: And....?
John found the separated flesh when he prodded gently at the neck so as not to move the body from its facedown position. “But the other two didn’t have-”
“Oh John! Mmpphhhh!" Sherlock held his breath for a good four seconds when he came, spurting streaks of cum up along his stomach, chest, and even got a few drops onto John’s arm beside his face.
The three bodies, two men, one woman laid facedown on the pavement before the skin club SophistiCats. The darkened black door easily blended in the night sky, sandwiched between a pub and a sex shop. The golden scroll reflected in the lamplight, mobile lights, and the random number of torches. The music beat from inside oozed through the building walls, drumming the bass over New Scotland Yarders, Sherlock and himself. The black awning over the club rattled and danced loudly with the beat. In his younger days, John would have worked his magic happily across the floor, but now, all he has is a headache. His body protested as he moved from his crouched position and pulled off his dirtied latex gloves He deposited them in the bin and walked to Lestrade, who was leaning on a red post near the black doorway.
Sherlock snorted. “No.”
John turned away from the note and followed the layout into the living room. It wasn’t much better. Photos of two men decorated the walls in mismatched frames. Most of the pictures were all smiles; some had silly faces. There was only one picture, of a large group of people in which neither man was smiling. John recognized the Eiffel Tower in one of the pictures. The last and largest framed photo was of the two men kissing in front of a castle with fireworks over their heads.
He clicked open the messages folder. The Outbox was empty. So was the Draft. There was only one received text message.
“Alright. I’m…” Sherlock held himself still for a moment and breathed really hard before he continued, “I’m perfectly fine.”
Of course, he called Sherlock right away after discovering it. He watched as Sherlock roamed over the house with his studious eyes, taking in every detail as he could see them. In the end, John asked for Mycroft’s resources, while hearing endless complaints from Sherlock. Hoping with Sherlock’s mind and Mycroft’s connections, that they would discover something. Last night, they reached the latest lead. It seemed now that ‘Mary Watson’ was gone forever.
John’s mind whirled and his body reacted quickly in thought of his plan. In the following seconds, he leapt off the bed, snatched the plug from the bedside table, and strutted into the bathroom. John admired Sherlock’s arse as the detective dove into the stream of water. Grey eyes connected to John’s through saturated curls.
Chapter 25
The remainder of Sherlock’s glass was downed in a second. “I’m returning to the flat. I need to think.”
“John? You have ten minutes.”
“The killer is escalating, rather quickly, rushing to perfect the technique,” answered Sherlock. The DI sighed, “What for?”
Disclaimer: I don't own Sherlock
“Yup.”
“If he was arrested, how the hell did he get of prison?” asked Lestrade.
Paperwork flew into the air, raining down over their heads as Sherlock joined them, ranting as he went. “The foliage found at the first crime scene disintegrated during analyzing. The traces that were miraculously rescued tested as paper! Paper! What kind of morons do you have in that lab?”
John’s eyes canted to the man at the wall, and then up and down Mary herself. She didn’t look the same as before and it took a second more to figure it out. Her face was thinner, seems like she had lost quite a bit of weight, and the weight mostly disappeared from her abdomen. She didn’t look pregnant anymore.
“John! You still here?”
John cast a glance to the CCTV perched on the nearest corner. It shook at him repeatedly like someone shaking ‘no’ with his or her head.
Rage pulsed through his entire being. He sniffed sharply, trying to gather some wit for himself before he actually succumbed to punching Mycroft. God, it was tempting. Resentment that he had buried rushed forward, screaming at him to hurt Mycroft. Just as Mycroft hurt John by covering Sherlock’s death. For making it sound like he was to blame him for that death. For Sherlock’s missing years. For the wedding. For the exile. Even though Mycroft had sold Sherlock’s life to Moriarty in the first place! Nothing would have happened if Mycroft hadn’t betrayed Sherlock first!
John felt the muscles clench tight around his cock. He dropped his face onto Sherlock’s shoulder, not caring if his face would be covered in Sherlock’s semen, instantly folding his lover into half and fucked the tight heat viciously.
John just gaped, in surprise, awe, and pure admiration in which Mrs. Hudson took down a freelance assassin before remembering that she was supposed to be tied up.
“Moran.”
The woman rubbed her hands together and blew on them. “Well, I best be getting back inside, if you want you can join me for a drink, but there’s a waitress that I was hoping to get to know better if you didn’t-”
John grinned. In the lamplight, John could see the outer purple bruise underneath the scarf. He licked his lips and realised a familiar feeling down in his stomach. He shook his head, trying to dampen his arousal. The last thing he needed was to remember last night, and feeling the effects of it while on a new case.
John immediately noticed the scars around Moriarty’s chin, thick, long healed blotches where the skin has to be patched together. John could relate in that, which made him frown. He never wanted to relate to anything when it came to Moriarty, the man who had sent the Jefferson Hope after Sherlock, who had tortured people for hours because of some stupid puzzles, and ultimately lead to Sherlock’s disappearance from his life for two years.
Well. John was thoroughly confused now. What situation? Was it now? Was Sherlock taking painkillers? Because he just overheard Sherlock refusing them. And who the hell said that? Surely, Sherlock would have mentioned it to him if it were recent.
With the short courting, quick engagement, and the wedding, John felt like he had when he thought Sherlock was dead. That it was a means to an end and he was still grieving, moving forward one day at a time. When Sherlock was ‘dead’ his days were easier, knowing that he wasn’t out there. Living without him. Then he could settle into a life with Mary but that wasn’t the case. Instead, it was two halves of him, fighting each other and as he realized long ago, relationships and Sherlock couldn’t coexist together. He moved back into Baker Street, hoping to restart his life once again. To hopefully recreate the sense of normalcy that had existed before Mary, Moriarty, Sherlock’s one-time relapse on the plane, and start taking cases again.
“Sherlock knows-”
Blood had oozed across the white tiled floor from the victim’s head wound. Shot through the temple, through the back of the head caused a tangled mess of blood, bones, and brain matter. A singular shot. It was a quick death, small victories for terrible circumstances. John glanced at the white cabinets to his left. Blood trickled down the surface in darkened river stains. She had been dead for a while, at least two hours.
“On maternity leave until the end of the month,” answered Sherlock. Grey eyes trailed up and down his John’s body. “Take off your jumper.”
“Yes, I never thought your romanticism would be quite this challenging. It was entertaining to observe your interaction with others, but it’s torture to experience it. And I’ve been tortured. I’ve waited years to have you in the same bed, and you spill some nonsense about waiting for the perfect time like we’re both made of glass.”
Sherlock’s hands moved away from John’s shoulder. The long, elegant digits sank into inky dark curls as Sherlock stepped away to pace barefoot across the floor. John observed the motions, watched for any differences in breathing in case Sherlock had another ‘not panic’ panic attack. “Talk to me, Sherlock!”
“Yes. I do.”
John leaned his head back against Sherlock’s shoulder. His lips brushed over the milky white skin on the side of Sherlock’s neck. The laughter vanished as both their breathing hitched, then deeper and longer breathes in between. Fingertips trailed in slow circles around John’s inner thighs, stomach and his lower abdomen, purposefully avoiding his cock.
“Do get on with it.”
“Sorry,” he sighed. John rubbed his hands on his thighs, his pinky finger grazed against Sherlock’s thigh. He ignored the memory of that muscle underneath his hand at the pub where it had been dark, adrenaline-fueled, and heart pounding lust. “I’m just trying to sort out on how to begin.”
“You had wine.”
“You moved your gun.”
“You’re going, aren’t you?” Mary asked.
“Where’s the fun in that? His fingertips, John!”

“Stay seated, Sherlock.”
Sherlock hovered next to him by the doorway. He smiled at the detective, who somehow slipped on the blue dressing gown while John wasn’t looking. He had to have slipped it on between Mrs. Hudson’s tea drop-off and John’s hunting for Sherlock’s card. It was John’s favorite. How Sherlock knew was a mystery. John added that to his lists to ask Sherlock.
“She expected that from Sherlock, but she was surprised when it came from you.”
But it didn’t. The doorknob wouldn’t turn. It was locked. The hand on John’s shoulder loosened, sending flares of pain throughout his back. Yeah, being in the chair did not help his shoulder any. But thankfully his adrenaline was slowly rising, and the pain on his shoulder eased into light throbbing.
Moriarty made a show to look over John’s shoulder as if John were hiding Sherlock somewhere. “Where is he?”
By the time, John walked on pavement leading to the flat; he was calm, collected, albeit still slightly conflicted. He decided that he would come clean, telling Sherlock everything once the case was solved and they had some down time-usually happened after cases because Sherlock would neglect his body’s needs. They should tackle one problem at a time. John’s mental list so far: One; Solve a murder, Two; catch Sebastian Moran, and lastly three; tell Sherlock about Mycroft’s blackmail, about Moriarty, and the third Holmes.
“No.”
“Like the solar system in your blog.”
“Before his death, Jim Moriarty had stepped in our flat. Not once, but on multiple occasions. Slept in our beds, messed with our things. You never knew or noticed. I would have Mrs. Hudson wash everything he touched. I would start an experiment to cover the scent. I had…believed…that Sebastian Moran would have been here as well. Everything that Moriarty would have touched hasn’t been moved.”
John grimaced. “Not what I meant.”
He sat in his comfortable chair with a sour taste on his tongue from one bite, stared at his cooling pile of food that he wasn’t hungry for. Sherlock flinted throughout the sitting room, his dressing gown whipped around behind him as he carried copies of the case files in both hands and pieces of naan disappeared into his mouth. The naan that started on John’s plate had vanished long ago, liberated away with nimble fingers. At least, someone was enjoying the food.
“I think I will send him a cake.”
John glared in the direction of the kitchen. His arms folded across his chest.
