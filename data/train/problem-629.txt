“It’s not just Rosie, Sherlock.” Sherlock watches him carefully. John takes a shaky breath. “It’s everything. Mary’s dead, I’m still in the flat, you’re in recovery…” His voice trails off when he can feel himself choking up, and instead of continuing, he sighs and falls silent.
Every evening, whether they were tired out from a case or had had nothing on all day, they somehow found time to fit a practice in. At first, John had been a stumbling, off balance mess, but as the weeks went on, and his confidence in dancing grew, so did his and Sherlocks chemistry - perhaps it had been because of his extreme lack of self confidence, but John hadn't really realised how perfectly they'd danced together until Sherlock had commented airily on how far he had come since the beginning, and John had felt his face flush with embarrassment.
Sherlock glances at him from the corner of his eye. It takes only seconds to deduce his thought process, “Sorry, John, I didn’t - “
John leans against the dresser and looks right at him, "Take it from someone who had a shitty childhood; this is the best decision for her."
His phone screen glows brightly against the ceiling and John turns on his side with a groan as he reaches out a hand for it.
But he can't help himself. While Sherlock's staring out the window in thought, he digs his hand in his pocket for the phone and he can see Sherlock glancing at him out of the corner of his eye, but he ignores it and clicks the screen on.
John purses his lips, but does so and he’s not surprised to see Sherlock sitting up in bed. He hadn’t even heard him move.
Sherlock gently draws away, but still keeps John at arms length, and his face is the most serious John thinks he's ever seen it, "No you wouldn't."
John smiles wryly, but he knows there's no point in trying to convince him. He does as Sherlock's said and goes about the room, moving anything back that he thinks they'll bump into or will step over. He even goes over to the curtains to draw them closed as an afterthought and the room seems to get brighter, making John smile. He almost jumps when he hears Sherlocks voice, who's still at the radio, he realises.
John takes a bite of chicken as he points his chopsticks in Sherlocks direction, but he’s still looking at his plate, “Back there, at Angelos, he said something about a Headless Nun Case…..” He pauses to look up, but when he sees Sherlock, his words stick in his throat, “What’re you looking at?”
There’s a knock at the door, and Johns head turns as a nurse comes through with a tray, “Dinner, Mr. Holmes.”
He stops to wait for Johns reaction, and as he lowers his head to the carpet, deductions start flying at him. None of them are of John changing his mind.
Sherlock smiles shyly, "You could stay tonight." John lowers the phone to look at him, "The cabs don't run at this time, and it's a 30 minutes walk." He hesitates, "I should mention however, that when you moved out, I converted your room to another lab so you no longer have a bedroom."
“Mycroft, he - he had to live with this when we were growing up. I would get high all the time.” He winces as the morphine kicks in, “He'd find me in a back alley somewhere, far from home, or a secret drug den I'd managed to find with some help from a few...dealers.”
- it's always the dip that has him freeze up. He knows, he has to do this exact waltz with Mary and if he does go still out there, he'll look like an utter fool and embarrass both of them. But he just...can't do it. In the lessons, he always looks off or ends the dance abruptly before going off to his room with Sherlock staring after him in utter confusion. Despite this, Sherlock has never brought it up, and John continues to carry this strange guilt on his shoulders. That is, until tonight.
"Y-Yeah, I mean - who knows what the media would have done with that." Again, a weird sense of 'intruding' comes over him, but he squashes it down and keeps his gaze trained on Sherlocks curls.
John stands there, waiting, but when Sherlock makes no move to help, he shakes his head and goes about doing the task himself. Just as he's finished putting Sherlocks chair against the bookcase, he speaks up again with a suggestion to move anything else that he thinks will get in the way.
The gears are turning in Johns head, and Sherlock can almost see them. Still, he doesn't push him to get the answer right away and just lets him figure this out on his own. Sherlocks body is more tense than ever and he can't stop tapping his fingers together. He knows John is completely okay with this, but that doesn't erase how terrified Sherlock feels right now, and for a quick moment, he wonders if John can sense his panic.
“Oh, lovely!” She sighs, “I knew he was perfect for you, Sherlock. Oh you raved about him before he got here - “
John sighs in defeat, letting out a final laugh, "Sherlock, feelings don't run on the head. They're in the heart." When he sees Sherlock isn't getting it, he steps away from the door, and his voice softens, "You can't help how you feel about someone. You
Sherlock simply nodded in acceptance of that as he picked up their meager belongings, leant John an arm for support and led them to the house.
John gritted his teeth as he and Sherlock squeezed each other’s hands in the confirmation of what they already knew. Mycroft and Natalia waited.
John looked to Alpha Rivera. “Rivera…? Someone messed up. None of these are of Sherlock’s left ankle.”
John Watson and Oskar Alperin have been good friends since uni and have always had a type of friendly rivalry between them. As other couples were eliminated, and it became obvious it was going to be down to the two of them that rivalry became enhanced.
Sherlock saw that happiness coming towards him and beamed. He saw more of that sandy blond, turning silver hair, saw the familiar smile on the face that came closer.
Knowing this day would come to them does nothing to ease the pain of facing the reality of it for the very first time.
John looked into Sherlock’s eyes surprised to see the widening dilation. There was no way it meant what he thought that meant…
Tradition decrees that before the official announcement of the death of a loved one, the head of the Pack, usually the Alpha-Patriarch must greet each direct family member with a touch and remind them of the first time they met or a dear memory as far back as possible. It was a reminder that their travel on this plane of existence has not ended yet.  The words are usually spoken out loud, but John and Sherlock, being who and what they are, made use of their unique talents instead.
“Papa!”  Donna looked from her omega father at the internal sound of her alpha father as he arrived on the scene.
Where Omega Alperin leaned her head back on her alpha lovingly, Omega Watson sat straight, head raised and faced forward. John stoically tried to ignore how bereft he felt now that Sherlock’s warm body was no longer against his.
This was his life now. He could not say he was happy. He does not know if he will ever be happy again, but out here in the vast acreage and demanding work of running the ranch he was surprisingly content. He looked out at the horizon. The long shadows of the surrounding trees in the distance indicated he had maybe an hour and a half before the sun fully set and rendered the land so dark the only reason that he knew there were mountains in the distance on moonless nights were from the peaked breaks in the horizon that blocked the multitude of stars in that direction.
Several in the room had cried out, one or two fell to a knee, all felt the tear all before he shut them out again.
Hands were held. Faces were caressed. Hugs were given. There was gentle sobbing all around as backdrop as first memories were shared.
Detective Inspector Gregory Holmes-Lestrade as a Beta, even a bonded one, did not have the pack connection. He was at a crime scene when he received the alarm. He had stepped away from the scene about to call Mycroft for details when he was contacted by his husband.
“He who has danced under the Alpha sun and howled at the Omega moon has travelled.” Mycroft pulled up a chair to sit by John with the greeting of condolence among Alpha Omega.
Sherlock and John stood side by side at the fireplace when done. Mycroft and Greg as senior Pack always faced them on the other side. The second generation in attendance stood closest to John and Sherlock, three holding tablets with live connections to the ones overseas. Their children’s respective Packs spread around them all in a rough hierarchy of bond mates for those who had them, and then offspring. Anthea and Lauren along with Harry and her family were also with them. John gave a nod to Natalia when they were ready.
The only reason Alpha Watson and his second mate were at El Enlace again was for a case where Sherlock suspected an omega of drug dealing under her Alpha’s command. Sherlock who rarely gave in to his omega nature, had let his omega pride at how well he and John knew each other get him challenged by another omega into participating in the event.
Air Commander Ianto Spéir Holmes Watson-Alpha, beloved sixth Alpha, eighth child and fourth son of Alpha John and Omega Sherlock of Pack Holmes-Watson was killed when a surface to air missile brought down the Chinook helicopter he piloted during a reconnaissance and rescue mission in hostile territory. He is survived by his wife of three years, Ulani Holmes-Watson (née Lanuola).
The only thing worse than the feel of their his daughter's panic, was the sudden silence that followed and Sherlock’s panic right behind it.
John could not help but feel the Omega Care that poured from Sherlock. This was not the acting they had done inside.
“Daddy!” Donna Clementine burst into tears at the sight of her omega father when she awakened minutes later in the back of one of the SUVs, understandably shaken.
“My pleasure.” Alpha Nourry walked over to John’s table and turned over the photos. It was to everyone’s amusement when the A initial appeared in the third turn. It was one of the picks Oskar had chosen wrong. To prove the point Alpha Nourry switched to Oskar’s table and turned over the left ankle pictures where the stylized W was found. Alperin would have never had the correct answer and now all knew why. The remaining ankle photos on John’s table were turned and shown to be blank. John was correct none of the left ankle photos on his table belonged to Sherlock. A loud cheer went up in the room as Alpha and Omega Watson were declared winners.
Alpha Carlson sat with his omega wife Irina. Carlson held a hand on the back of the omega’s neck. His fingers dug in slightly in a display of ownership completely unwarranted among Primero. John knew it was a hold used often by the various faded bruising. Every instinct in him knew the holds were not for the omega’s pleasure and felt his ire rise.
“Clem!”  Sherlock pulled the girl into his arms and calmed her through their pack connection. “It’s okay. It’s okay…”
The two stood and simply swayed in place for a long while until the cry of the child on John’s back made her presence known.
Sherlock stood in the field and squinted. The late afternoon sun beaming down was only slightly better than the broiling noonday sun. He could see the steam rising from the ground in the horizon. It reminded him of the last time he was in London. He grimaced not wanting to remember how hot it was. Not wanting to remember all the people that walked the crowded thoroughfares. Not wanting to remember how he search each face. Each sandy blond turning silver head. Each stormy deep blue sea eyes. Not wanting to remember the several moments of hopeful wait could it be? When he thought it might be, only to be followed by the hurtful no, no it’s not. It’s not him.
Sherlock and John have been a couple for less than a year on paper. And while they were bonded, absolutely no one in the room knew they had yet to mate. They did not have the intimacy one would naturally presume of a bonded couple. Alperin sees his comely omega, Stella, nightly. This was literally the third time John has seen Sherlock naked
“You gave all your winnings to the charity including the side bet. Do you want nothing for yourself?” Oskar asked sometime later after the club had returned to its usual business of Alpha pleasure. His wife sat on a cushion between his legs as she chatted with another omega in the conversation pit.
The infamous Holmes control is shattered. Sherlock was not even trying to contain his emotions. The feel of Omega Hurt pours over John in unyielding waves that tore at him. He instinctively tried to send love and comfort, but he knew neither were going to be of much use to the omega, when his own Alpha Hurt poured off him in equal waves.
John slowly turned in his seat with both fear and anticipation to prepare himself for whatever shenanigans his omega was up to.
Years before Alpha John Watson and Omega Sherlock Holmes met, Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade worked case involving a string of home burglaries spread out over a few months. After the sixth robbery Lestrade realized there was a pattern, but after two misses realized he could not reliably predict when or who the thieves would hit next. He brought in Sherlock, not quite The World’s Only Consulting Detective yet, but had proven his usefulness on tricky cases. The culprits were caught amid their next home invasion. While the other accomplices could only be tied to no more than three of the robberies, Hugo Perry, the ringleader of the group was convicted for seven of the nine counts.
John did not want to think about the disappointment he felt as Sherlock’s eyes quickly sharpened back to normal while they took their seats.
Seconds after the first tear, just before his pack scan, Alpha felt the sudden distress from Omega as Sherlock immediately woke up.
"She's terrified John. Not for the first time I wished I could send feelings with our children the way we can with each other."
It is in effect an obituary for the Pack. Natalia segued into her brother’s accolades and accomplishments as brother, a man, a fighter pilot with the Royal Air Force and as an alpha.
Alpha knew then the first tear he felt was for him, the second tear was when he felt his omega’s tear through their connection and then knew what it meant.
John gave Carlson a look that showed how little he believed him before he turned back to Alperin and Rivera. “Shall we continue?”
As Pack Associate to Pack Holmes-Watson, as Alpha Familiar and Proxy to Sherlock and head of Pack Holmes, and simply as family, John knew Mycroft Holmes would have been notified. Though long retired, John still thinks of Frosty the Spookman by his former position as Antarctica. It is now Natalia Olivia, who currently occupied
As he and Sherlock had no warning; John gave them no other warning as he then opened his mind to all of the Pack Holmes-Watson offspring. He shared how it felt as for them as Alpha and Omega when one of their children is torn from them.
Less than a year after Perry’s release, their ninth child - the fifth daughter of John and Sherlock of Pack Holmes-Watson, ten-year-old musical prodigy, Donna Clementine was kidnapped when the sedan scheduled to pick her up was late as she waited outside the music academy she attended. Donna had just enough wherewithal to activate the hidden emergency tracker that all in elite families like theirs wore. The silent alarm activated before she was rendered unconscious.
El Enlace was hosting a charity night to raise funding for a new adoption facility that specialized in Alpha/Omega care. Someone had the brilliant idea to include a Newlywed Game type of competition, but open to all the couples of El Enlace’s Primero level. The £2000 entry fee per couple just to play the game barely raised an eye among them. The new facility had a guaranteed £34000 off the bat before the first question was asked. Each couple added another £100 to the pot per round. If a couple didn’t take themselves out of the game, couple were eliminated after three incorrect answers. Non-participants were free to watch the game or go over to other parts of the floor where the usual games were played.
John and Oskar were once again tied, each getting thirteen correct of the sixteen parts turned currently over.
Francesca gasped as she grabbed her twin brother’s hand in realization. Francois, always on par with her and nodded. They looked to their fathers as the crux of that truth truly hit.
This tearing was different. John and Sherlock as the Alpha and Omega sires felt the tear directly. Because of whom they are as Aadeshyakar, they had accidentally shared that horrible moment from their core with four of their offspring before John shut them down. They were about to share it with more on purpose. Only the betas in the family who cannot sense and feel as they do, with the sole exception of Greg Lestrade-Holmes, would be spared.
Sherlock nods, “You have my word, John.” He pushes the paper away to change the subject, “Are you...going to sleep in that chair tonight?”
"Yes, that's the only option you have, John. Then you can be happy and you won't get your heart broken. Metaphorically speaking, of course."
Sherlocks eyes fly open and they run over Johns face, who's looking back with such a longing in his gaze. His mind suddenly falls back to reality, to what exactly they're doing, and he almost drops John on the carpet as his mouth falls open in shock. He looks away as he steps back and gently lets go of him to study his expression, his lips pursed. He knows. He's figured it out in one look. And while this usually impresses John to no end, tonight it has him want to sink into the floor.
John turns to face him, but he doesn’t answer right away. He’s strangely fixed on the light from the streetlamps are shining on Sherlocks curls, and how completely warm and soft his face is. It now just dawns on him of how they’d been behaving all night, and he smiles carefully at him, “Oh, um...it was no problem.”
John goes to knock again, but uncurls his hand at the last second and walks back down the hallway to the door, grabbing his sweater on the way.
John softly knocks on the door, already feeling the happiness leak out of him, "Sherlock, I..." He pauses when he feels a crushing weight press on his chest and he runs a hand through his hair, "I have to go," he says finally. Despite himself, he waits. Maybe he'll come out to say goodbye. Hell, maybe he'll even slip a note under the door.
Before John can sutter out an apology, an explanation, Sherlock cuts in and his voice is soft, almost reminiscent, "I still think about it sometimes."
John sighs, “Please don’t take that the wrong way, Sherlock. I meant that well...Rosie’s just lost a mother, you know? And…” A sadness creeps in his chest. He hadn’t let himself sit on that thought for too long. “And it would be...too much if we were to move to a different place in a short time…” He pauses, “Do you understand?”
can." Sherlock opens his mouth to reply, but John lifts a finger. "No. Shut up. It's 3 in the morning and I have to go to work in a few hours. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to bed - which is what you should be doing, too."
He shakes his head, ignoring her and fumbles for the door handle, "I'll be back soon." Before she can say anything more, he kisses her cheek then takes off into the hallway, a cold dread slowly seeping through him.
Sherlock looks up then, and there’s a flicker of hurt on his face, “....Oh…” He takes a breath, “It’s alright, I understand.”
Before either can say another word, a waiter comes back to gather their plates. John lets go, drawing his hand under the desk as he says a thank you to him and they both stand to leave. As they walk off down the street, the neon sign in the door switches off and the lights inside start to dim. The streets are empty and the sky’s clear of cloud this evening, with the stars shining brightly down on them. The police cars and tape have long cleared off, and the only sound is their shoes against the pavement.
He looks John dead in the eye, his lips curling in disgust at his flatmate goes back to his beer, "You're drunk again," he says firmly.
Sherlock smirks, and John’s about to reply when the waiter comes back with a small plate and fork. He sets them down in front of John, and he nods a thanks before he leaves again. After giving him a large helping, he passes the plate and fork over and Sherlock slowly begins to dig in. John watches him this time - partly to make sure Sherlock actually does eat, and partly because he finds it funny how Sherlock got so embarrassed over the uncooked food.
Sherlocks eyes widen but he stays silent as John continues, “I’m not the perfect husband, I never was.” He pauses when he sees Mary smile from the corner of his eye. “But that’s just it. She taught me to be that person, and I let her down in the end.” He breaks Sherlocks gaze as it slowly crashes around him, “I could never be enough for her.”
Sherlock nods, and that's all the confirmation John needs to roll on his other side to fall back to sleep. As he's drifting off, he feels Sherlocks arm encircle him and pull him gently to his chest, and John smiles when Sherlocks chin rests atop his head.
John chuckles, "Oh, that's right. It's about you, isn't it. Sorry the great detective can't handle this. Sorry his flatmate's gotten shit drunk almost every night when he discovered his wife had shot him. Sorry I'm going through a very
Sherlock puts his hands in his pockets, "Alright." He hesitates, unsure whether or not John's going to snap, but decides to go on, "The wedding's next Saturday. Correct?"
"We shall continue discussing these 'hidden assets' at the same time tomorrow" the Judge announced, "And, Mrs. Lestrade? I suggest you and your lawyer have a nice
It was far too late for anyone to be out walking, and he'd chosen these woods specifically for their lack of campers. The terrain was too rocky and steep for hikers, and no one lived close by enough to just wander in. Which just left hunters. But John was a hunter himself, albeit of a different kind...
"No it isn't. Didn't you get my text? I objected" He replied, "That alone should be reason enough for you
Grinning, John turned to face an exasperated Gregory Lestrade, "That'll be £231, when you're ready".
He smirked, "Yes. Into my penthouse in London... I don't know why you're so shocked looking, brother mine, it was you who advised it, after all".
"Oh you- I lost a cigarette for that?!" He exclaimed, before suddenly piercing blue eyes were pinning him in place, "You'll get nowhere by just pining over him. Go back to the bookstore tonight. Ask him out. Friday is more preferable, as the store closes early and you have no classes. Bring him to that café I always drag you to".
"Tea? Coffee? Hot chocolate?" Sherlock asked evenly, straightening up and returning to the kitchen, and the doctor stared at him, cautious.
And if he could believe in a dead man for three years, he could believe in himself for three minutes.
"John!" Sherlock snapped, looking strangely worried even as undid the rope tying his hands together, "Keep your eyes open. Look at me, John, I need you to stay conscious".
feelings, even if they were fake. Because not even the great Sherlock Holmes could remain stoic when confessing his love.
Four and a half days into his capture, however, Scarface, as Sherlock had taken to calling him, burst into the basement and flung his phone at him.
He slowly trailed off when he saw the pile of tissues on the floor and bottle of cough medicine next to them.
It so happened that it was his favourite, and based on Greg's nervous glances every so often, it hadn't a clue.
"She's only a few days old, Sherlock. I'd say she resembles a potato more than a person whom could be considered
"Essentially, yes" He replied, struggling with the zips on the backpack she'd failed to notice him carrying.
"Disintegrate, probably" He replied cheerfully, "Now go on, I want to get out of here so speak to Lestrade quickly, would you?"
She angrily scrubbed at the tears running down her face as she straightened up, knowing there was only one thing for it.
"Because us Holmes never do anything the easy way" came the eloquent response, "Do you want to hear something rather... embarrassing?"
John pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes, willing himself not to kill the genius with his bare hands there and then.
The younger Holmes shifted from one foot to the other restlessly, "Because you've always been kind to me, even when I didn't deserve it, and... I wasn't thinking straight. Not then. Not when... not when I thought you were about to be killed".
you, or whatever. It's just... well... I'm 13 years old, and I still find chess really complicated. You must be really smart".
Making his way over to the monkey bars, Sherlock watched with interest as once red-haired boy made it completely across, his feet swinging half a meter off the ground.
It wasn't until two and a half weeks later that he finally found out just who had captured his daughter's attention so thoroughly.
"Lestrade... Detective... Lestrade!" He lightly tapped the older man's face, and couldn't help but sigh in relief when two daze blue eyes slowly flickered open.
"I prom'se" He slurred, understanding that whatever it was he did, had to have been bad to cause Mycroft to cry like that.
John looked up as the bell above the door chimed, and felt his pulse quicken as he realised it was the man from last week.
He frowned, head tilting once more to the side like an overgrown and confused puppy, and it warmed her heart to the core.
He spun around to face him, both hands resting on the countertop, "Mycroft, if you were a woman, the two of you could have successfully conceived a small human by now!"
"Greg, please" He interrupted, voice an octave lower than usual that made something twist painfully in the younger man's stomach.
had agreed, after all, as there were many lose ends that needed to be wrapped up after the entire Eurus debacle.
Sherlock stared at him blankly, brain scrambling for an answer to a question his mind was too heavy to understand.
The crowd riled up once more, and Mycroft subtly glanced past the angry boy to see Sherlock crouched down in front of Eurus, far away on the other side of the playground, with Greg standing guard in front of them, and a young girl, who he could only presume to be Greg's sister, talking quietly to his youngest sibling. And as if sensing his stare, his brother looked up, meeting his gaze squarely as he gave a small nod.
John stared resolutely at the floor for a minute, before slowly looking up, taking in the man still standing in front of him.
"Well I don't see any reason not to be" He admitted, "He stayed over last night, and then this morning I found him making pancakes, and being perfectly honest I think he's kind of cute, so why wouldn't I be happy?"
Immediately dropping his book at the sight of glistening cheeks, John rushed over, "Hey, Rose, what's wrong? What happened? Are you alright?"
as well!" He snapped, folding his arms across his chest, and Mycroft sighed, putting down his cup "Oh, I should have known this would happen, you never did like to share, did you?"
"It took a while to convince the Superintendent that I wasn't imagining things, and that you were, in fact, in trouble".
Reaching down, he picked the lock on the door in mere seconds, and silently slipped into the penthouse apartment.
She couldn't help but laugh, despite the bitter reminder of why she was in the bathroom in the first place, "I happen to be dating one of those
Slowly sitting up, he yawned and stretched, before standing up and softly padding towards the kitchen, right hand absentmindedly scratching his stomach.
"... No" He reluctantly admitted, and his brother nodded, "Exactly. So stop your fretting, it's illogical and rather unbecoming".
"And the pot calls the kettle black" He muttered, before finally giving in at his younger brother's glare, "Sherlock... we were going to tell you eventually. We just... weren't quite sure how".
sleep, idiot" came the snappish reply, and Lestrade sighed, "Look, guys, I'm too tired to be dealing with your bickering right now. Sherlock, get dressed, we've got a corpse in the river Thames and no idea who put it there".
"Spain" Holmes replied easily, "Down the south east, I believe. About an hour's drive from his hotel. A lovely sea side town, apparently, and plenty of war museums to keep him entertained".
Waking up the next morning in the detective's bed was a rather strange experience, but he quickly brushed off all uncertainties, and redressed in his freshly-washed suit.
hours later as they sat in the police station getting debriefed, that Anderson came in and reluctantly announced that Lestrade sent him to ask what they wanted to eat.
He slowly nodded, and Mycroft gave a small smile, leaning forwards to take his hand into his own, "... Promise me that you'll never do this again".
Across from him, Sherlock sighed and reluctantly lowered his newspaper, "What's not fair? Or are you simply referring to life in general?"
So now, John was lying in bed in his miserable one-room bedsit, and wondering if the dirt beneath his fingernails was actually real or not.
resulted in the 'freak' taunts increasing by tenfold, he decided that, perhaps, there was more to this 'sociopath' thing that just a simple definition.
Lestrade sighed in relief as he finally found the secluded bookstore, and took a long drag of his cigarette before stubbing it out on the pavement beneath his feet.
Mycroft swallowed thickly and slowly walked over, taking the seat next to the older man's bed, "I... I'm sor-"
"He'll be out in a minute" John explained, walking over to the couch and picking up the long cloak that was draped over it, "Sorry for the mess, I'll just put this away".
But because they had prepared, John merely blinked and looked him up and down, "Yea. Your clothes are alright".
"Perhaps this isn't the place to explain myself" He interrupted quietly, and John was suddenly aware of everyone staring at him.
later as the Inspector wrapped up all arrests and send Sherlock's kidnappers away in patrol cars, that he had a chance to properly talk to the man himself.
"Well, people who spoke have a higher chance of moving onto harder drugs. That, and the fact your eyes were slightly red when you called me a liar..."
and this time John actually does realise that he's left his walking stick behind but it doesn't matter of course it doesn't matter because
occurred, and the teacher asked Sherlock for his opinion, an opinion that he almost-immediately realised was considered unacceptable because
Taking the seat at the foot of the bed, he waited until Sherlock looked like he was two seconds from flinging himself at him, before answering.
The part that killed her the most, was the fact that the great Sherlock Holmes had been reduced to begging. There, in the moment, she hadn't realised it's significance, not when he was doing that to her, teasing her, mocking her,
Molly couldn't help but laugh at his furious expression, and her laughter only increased when his glare turned to a pout at her ridicule.
Sighing for the umpteenth time that hour, he heard John groan from across the room and put down his newspaper.
Lestrade melted into the embrace as Mycroft finally leant forwards and sealed his lips with his own. His found his own arms coming up to wrap around the man's neck while the hand on his waist tightened enough to
he spent between ever-growing stacks of books, reading everything he could get his hands on about psychology, sociology, and the dreaded word itself, poured over medical journals as thick as his arm, psychiatric reports by the doctors of Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Diane Downs, and reports dating back as far as 1792, as he attempted to find answers, to find cures, to find out
Sighing, he put down his newspaper and stood up, putting his empty tea cup in the sink as he passed.
"Agreed" He replied easily, stepping forwards as his brother did the same, "But you threatened by baby sister. So don't expect me to fight fair".
than just the boxers, considering that the word 'Mycroft' was embroidered just above the breast pocket.
He didn't realise he'd spoken out loud until he heard quick footsteps behind him, "Are you alright?"
"Another body found, you said?" Sherlock interrupted smoothly, gliding from his room fully dressed, and the forensic scientist blinked in confused, looking between him and the now-closed bedroom door and then back at John who had placed the cape out of sight in his own room.
He nodded quickly, stepping into the apartment before the older man changed his mind, and awkwardly hovered at the doorway of the sitting room as the officer put the beer in the fridge.
John sighed as Rosie giggled at her phone for the millionth time that hour, lost in a world of her own.
Sebastian swallowed nervously and glanced to the side, and Mycroft followed his gaze only to find the dark-haired boy that Eurus had knelt down besides staring back, calmly.
"Right" Lestrade announced, clapping his hands together, "Your brother will be back soon, so... until then... Care for some pancakes?"
"No" Sherlock replied definitely, "No, that truly was just an excuse for him to be here... Mycroft, however-"
"Scarface? Who the hell is- Actually. You know what? You can save all that for the debriefing. Let's just focus on getting you out of here, alright?"
He re-emerged only a few seconds later, now wearing a bathrobe, which, personally, Sherlock found even
" He said quietly, voice so full of threat and menace it had even Lestrade shivering, "Do you understand?"
"You're an ass" Sherlock interrupted, "And a cowardly ass at that. Go to Lestrade. Tell him you love him. Move in together. And more importantly, stop pretending you want to be here with me when we all know you'd prefer to be with the man who took a bullet for you!"
The doctor blinked, slowly lowering his weapon, before clearing his throat and rushing over, "Sorry, I... I haven't shot someone, haven't
Turning to Rosie, he whispered conspiringly, "Promise me that you'll never turn out like any of them".
Lestrade sighed, fighting back a smile as he realised what they were up to, and nodded, "Yea. Found in the Thames, same place, same murder weapon..."
Picking up the shovel again, he stabbed it into the damp earth, and then stood on it for good measure. He was about three feet down, currently, and knew there was a lot further to go before he'd reach six feet.
Meeting his brother's eyes, he gave a near-invisible gesture at their sister hovering in the middle of the group, and received an imperceptible nod in return. Sherlock was the slightest of the three, after all, and his lean frame would have no trouble squeezing in between other's twice his age.
Lestrade looked up, surprised, only to find one piercingly blue eye open and glaring right back at him.
"Yes, well, no one asked for your opinion Anderson, you ignoramus!" He snapped, before quickly turning to look down at Rosie, "That means idiot. You should learn that, I use it quite a lot".
A smile that would be unnoticeable to the untrained eye, but considering that his job basically revolved around reading people and judging their facial expressions to see if they're lying or not, it was pretty bloody obvious to him that the man was happy with the idea of drinks.
It took John a full five minutes after she had bounded from the table to finally register what had just been said.
He scrambled to do as told, not wanting any more bruises than necessary, and once on his feet, his arms were grabbed harshly and he was dragged out of the van.
"Yes!" He snapped, dragging the younger to his feet, "You came home Tuesday night, and then Mummy got a call from the school on Wednesday asking where you were. When she couldn't find you, she called me. When neither of us knew where you were, she called the police-"
, as if he could try and stop me" He rolled his eyes, "I'm sure it doesn't surprise you, John, that our government has enemies. Some of these, the public know about, others…
If they hadn't practiced this exact moment a hundred times, he would've been completely stumped as to what the man was going on about.
, you're really one of a kind, aren't you?" He whispered, staring up at him in such awe that Mycroft felt himself blush again.
John stood there in shock, slowly blinking, until Sherlock cautiously peered out from his own room, "... I take it she's finally found out, then".
"How are you so sure it's a 'she'?" He muttered, dragging over a kitchen chair, but, of course, Sherlock heard him anyway.
Lestrade pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath, "... Do you honestly believe that bringing a
"Oh for- You've only been complaining about your massive crush on him to me for the last five years!"
Sherlock's open mouth stopped mere inches from his neck, as two pearly-white fangs gleamed under the streetlights.
The younger man blushed adorably and marked the page in the thick volume he was reading, "Can I help you find something?"
"Alright, Sherlock, it's ok, I don't need to know" He interrupted, fetching a glass from the kitchen, "But why do I have to
, causing him to hiss in delight. Mycroft took no notice, stepping forwards until the detective was forced back against the kitchen counter, hard press handles
Arriving at what was now most certainly a fight, Mycroft quickly squeezed himself into the circle with every intention of finding out
Mycroft's eyes darkened when he saw the black eye and split lip, and the faint bruises littering the detective's jaw and neck. Glancing down even further, revealed bloody wrists from too-tight handcuffs, and various scratches and cuts lining both arms.
He sighed, and turned his petulant brother, "Sherlock... This really doesn't have to change anything. Gregory and I are two consenting adults who
"John, you're a soldier, and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life, and writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you".
John sighs. A wave of sudden fatigue breaks over him and he shakes his head, "Alright...yeah, I'll stay here tonight. Just...gotta tell Mary…" He deletes his response to put a new one, and presses send as Sherlock frowns.
Sherlock has an urgent need to take the bottle away from him, "You're right, I don't. But what you're doing isn't fair to anyone, John. You can't just sit back and let your daughter miss out on knowing who her dad is."
Sherlock rests his elbow on the table, chin in palm as he stares across the table at John, a warm smile curling his lips. Much to Johns persistence, he had eventually caved and ordered a plate of something - some pork dish, though he’s not entirely sure - but he hasn’t touched it once since it came to their table 12 minutes ago. He’s been too busy thinking about today, and trying to figure out the man on the other side of the lit candle.
He looks at him sharply, "Well, it's better than what I grew up with, Sherlock. A drunk...bastard who hated both Harry and I." He bends down to grab at the bottle again and Sherlock sighs at the ceiling as he tilts it to his mouth for the last few drops.
“ - No, no, it’s fine, it’s just...I’m still...going through losing Mary, you know? And...well, moving back in with you would be….a lot to...adjust to.”
Sherlock snorts, “‘Course not, John.” He pauses, and a strange look comes on his face, “Though, that would be helpful, wouldn’t it. No harm in getting free food all the time.”
Johns face flushes. He's suddenly thankful that Sherlock didn't turn around to say all this, "Oh...uh, right. It's...good you changed it then."
John swallows hard. He carefully sets the bottle on the carpet, then resigns himself to letting Sherlock in for the first time that night; Sherlock's quiet as he watches John take the photos out, and his voice is brittle as he goes through the pile, "She sent these a few days ago, I...I only glanced at them."
"Well...I cured your limp, for one." John smiles, "We became friends. You met my brother, we ran around London, you also discovered I had a drug habit which does pop up now and again. We had dinner too. Twice. Never got to finish the first…" He hesitates.
Sherlock rests his fingers by his bottom lip, “I’m just trying to understand why you shot the cabbie.”
The owner of the restaurant had just approached the two with a joyous smile and Sherlock had had to explain to John of how they knew one another - got him off a murder charge too, apparently. After he’d walked off, John had continuing eating his food, before a question had arisen in his mind and he’d stared at Sherlock with his chopsticks poised in the air.
Sherlock narrows his eyes. Perhaps he can get something out of John this time. He purses his lips, digs his hands back in his pockets, then casts his eyes over the shadow of his reflection, "Care to elaborate?"
Seeing Sherlock in such a state rips at him horribly, and a deep well of guilt currently sits inside him as he watches Sherlocks chest slowly rise and fall. The heart monitor beside him is beeping quietly, but to John, it’s the loudest sound in the room. He puts a hand on his cane - a would’ve-been parting gift had he not changed his mind right as he’d gotten to the door - and looks at his flatmates sleeping form, his eyes taking in the mark on his cheek, the heavy bags under his eyes, and how he looks just so utterly worn to the bone. He had gotten some information on his condition from the nurse earlier; malnourished, double kidney failure, and a few bruised ribs (which he knows is his fault from before) and being told that alone had the guilt multiply tenfold. With the overdose and the beating, there’s no doubt that Sherlock’s going to have to stay in here for weeks while he recovers.
"You don't really think you're going to be with Mary forever, do you?" John opens his mouth to speak, but Sherlock waves a hand, "The honeymoon phase is fleeting, John."
She smiles at the both of them and sets the tray above Sherlocks stomach, her brows raised when she sees he’s already sitting upright. She lays down a knife and fork, then nods to them both and leaves - Sherlock waits for the click before lowering the morphine dosage and he grimaces as he pushes the tray away. “Hospital food. A curse if there ever was one.”
There's nothing but silence from upstairs. He takes the stairs two at a time, his stomach tied in knots. Please, please, please…
"You…" John chooses his words carefully. Not incase of insulting him, but worried over if his memory will serve him correctly, "You never said boyfriends weren't your area…" His brows knit together, "You thanked me when I said it was fine if you did have a boyfriend…"
John had had to quit his job, and hardly came out on cases from the bleeding hangovers he'd had in the mornings. And while Sherlock didn't always need Johns input, he missed having him by his side, and Lestrade had caught him more than once speaking to thin air in great detail about a case he was working on. It was sad, really. The whole situation was. And all Sherlock wanted to do was talk to John. But his flatmate would just go up to his room and shut the door when he saw an impending conversation going on in Sherlocks head.
His heart seems to suddenly sink. He looks back at Mary, who's watching him with a hesitant smile, "John, you okay?"
In an instant, Sherlocks eyes fill with tears, "I...I don't know." Because he really didn't. He had had no real reason to keep this from John. But it was still something he felt needed to stay secret. Not because it wasn't of any importance, but because it was something so personal of himself that simply sharing it to anyone, regardless, was a heart stopping experience.
“....Yes, of course I would. I thought I already was…” He begins to laugh and Sherlock picks at the pieces of cookie.
John had moved back to Baker Street as soon as he'd found out. He'd read the flash drive a week in, upstairs in his room in privacy while Sherlock was in his armchair reading a book, and when John had come down an hour later, they'd stared at eachother with him on the landing, and Sherlock had wordlessly watched him walk to the fire and toss the memory stick in. He'd stayed there until the wood had turned to ash and the flames had finally burnt out.
Alpha Carlson raised a brow when Sherlock stood and lifted his own chair. “You’re not going to help your omega?”
John made a single, but decisive, chopping motion with his hand and shook his head in the negative. He had seen Carlson looking at Sherlock earlier. He was not surprised by the request. Nor by the level of possessiveness the thought of his omega with anyone else stirred within him.
Cannicular days, he sighed to himself as he took off his hat and shook the sweat from his dark curling hair. He wiped sweat from his forehead and neck with his bandana before he donned his hat again. Neither of which alleviated the shirt that stuck to the front of him yet allowed rivulets of sweat to trail down the center of his back. He wanted to rip it off, but hard lessons learned in how his body did not like the feel of too much straw against any part of him other than his face and hands stayed the urge. He absentmindedly started rubbing his arm through the sleeve in memory of the irritation. A rancher somewhat sensitive to hay; the irony of it amused him.
In seconds, Sherlock's kissing back, and John giggles as his hand comes around to cup his cheek. They kiss and kiss and kiss and neither come up for air until Sherlock whispers his name, and John sighs softly in response. They rest their foreheads together, eyes closed as they just let themselves stay in the moment - the radio has switched to another song, and they may as well have parted now for bed, but they're too far gone in one another to move.
is what you wanted to talk to me about? How long it would take for me to stop....feeling the way I do about you?"
There's a lull, and Sherlocks eyes search him, but he doesn't carry on, and John looks away to re-think that evening….
From the darkness of the space between the stairs and the hallway, Sherlock squeezes Johns hand, and Mrs. H lights up.
It's a clear Saturday night, with the occasional laughter and voice heard outside from the usual passerby, and the street lights glow dimly against the window panes. It had been a hard day for both men as they had worked hours on a case that had seemed impossible to solve. Well, impossible if Sherlock hadn't been there - even so, it had taken a long while before he'd been able to figure out the killers motive, and when they were done, the clock had just ticked over to 5pm. After a quick takeout dinner, and seperate showers at seperate times to wash the day away, the duo had retired to their seperate armchairs to finally relax and go about their own activities in silence for the remainder of the evening, which entailed John reading a battered copy of "To Kill A Mockingbird" and what looked to be Sherlock quietly tuning his violin across from him, though John had come to know this meant he was going over something in his head.
He turns back to the door, but just as his fingers touches the handle, Sherlock speaks from behind him.
Sherlock had seemed so cool the entire evening, and here he is all flustered over a dish not being up to its standard. John finds himself biting back a soft smile, and the two finish their dishes in silence, each making furtive glances at the other.
He waits a moment, but she doesn’t say anything more, and he clenches his fists, forcing himself to look up at Sherlock again. He takes a deep breath, steadies himself, then speaks in a clear voice, "I cheated on her, Sherlock."
That...god that hadn't even occurred to him at all. Only today had been on his mind, how wonderful and beautiful it had all been with Sherlocks speech and him and Mary dancing to their own waltz. Although an incredibly unforgettable day, the first day him and Sherlock met had been it's own whirlwind of moments in of itself.
He doesn't see it, but Sherlocks face goes a light pink, "Yes, remind me not to go off script when you have your next marriage."
Sherlock steps up so they're closer together, "You still have to go through with this marriage, and you'll still be in love with me." His voice sounds so full of sorrow that it makes John swallow hard. Now it's sinking in.
With every lesson Sherlock had been giving him, Johns feelings had grown gradually stronger, and with their overwhelming chemistry and closeness - especially at the dip - he had realised he had been slowly falling in love. But of course he hadn't been able to act on it, because of his commitment to Mary.
Sherlock frowns at him, but when John swaps the chopsticks for a fork, he reluctantly takes his own sticks from the napkin and goes to pick up a piece of pork. From the corner of his eye, John watches him chew it, and his brows furrow when he sees him grab the napkin and put it to his mouth.
John licks his lips. He goes to reply, but he stops when Sherlock begins taking off his coat. All he has underneath is his blue dressing gown, but even then that's only made out of silk, "What're you doing?"
John smirks and there's a comfortable silence between them as they just let themselves live in this moment for a bit. Johns phone doesn't go off and the front door doesn't shut, indicating Mrs. Hudsons return. They can give themselves permission to have something like this, even if it is to be short lived.
His gaze clips back to the street and John sighs, his hands resting on the soft fabric of the chair. Another beat of silence.
When he finally manages to get a hold on himself, he swallows thickly and threads his fingers together, “What about you?”
John looks at him for a long time, and when he senses his gaze isn’t wavering, Sherlock meets his eyes, “How long have you been waiting for me to move back in?”
To his surprise, he goes back to the window and clasps his hands behind his back as he stares at the street below. John doesn't move from the doorway and his fingers are curled around the bannister. When a few seconds pass, he steps carefully into the room and makes for his chair, lowering his head onto his chest to wait for Sherlock to speak, and when he does, his voice cuts easily through the silence.
Despite having a tight grip on it, Sherlock easily takes it back and John glares at him, but he ignores it to spit bitterly at him, "You're not a bastard, John, but you're making quite a clear example of a drunk who hates himself."
Sherlock exhales, "Victor...was smart. He did and said a lot of terrible things to me that I didn't take notice of until Mycroft told me about it later. We broke up because...I started to see it." His eyes search Johns, and his face becomes suddenly soft, "I don't want that to happen to you, too."
"Oh. Right." The smile slips from Sherlocks face as he recounts them all, and the pink in his cheeks slowly brighten, but again, John doesn't see this. He tries to come off as nonchalant as John watches him, "They were just words, really. I found them in a book under the chapter of nice things to say about your best friends fiance."
Though they're on the brief topic of marriage, John suddenly has little if no desire to go back to the ceremony. Surely if Mary's worried, she would have called by now. And despite having a constant knot of unease sitting in his gut, John isn't exactly running to the door to leave in any haste. In a way, he's interested to hear what Sherlock's been preparing to say to him the whole time he had been gone.
He taps a hurried reply then clicks the phone closed and drops it back in place. He almost misses the small smile Sherlock gives him, but chooses to brush it off as he waits for him to start speaking again.
When they go inside, John’s expecting to be greeted by their landlady, but when she doesn’t emerge, he passes Sherlock (who’s taking off his coat and scarf) to make for the stairs. Just as he gets to the second step, Sherlock stops him with another statement,
But Sherlock can't hear him. He's examining it, his eyes running over the familiar return address and feeling the light weight of its contents. Just as Sherlock's about to tip them into his palm, it's ripped from his fingers and John scowls at him, the package by his side.
Sherlock chuckles but doesn't say anything, and John has no choice but to follow on, though he's still in a slight daze from the move. Although the song is slow, they both begin to quicken their steps and John laughs as he's spun around again, Sherlock bringing him back to hold him closer as they practically glide across the room. Every now and again, Sherlocks eyes catch the lamps lights, and John still does step on his toes, but they never once look away from one another, and John swears he feels something pass between them, but he's having far too much fun to think on it. They soon break the standard rule and begin spinning one another around, smiling hard and laughing together, and suddenly...the rules don't matter.
"No. You're not leaving, Sherlock. You got me out of bed to see you. Whatever you have to say must be important."
Sherlock smiles, “You’ve never had to prove yourself to me, John. I should think we had established this a long time ago.”
to exactly, but he'd done it from a cursed reflex, and swore inwardly when he got to 6. 4 if he hurried. Take-away places were always packed on Fridays, and when Sherlock had seen the many people waiting around for their meal, he automatically clocked on another 2.
Something plummets through him when he sees Sherlock’s blinking back tears, and he smiles half-heartedly, “I loved Mary. I loved her so much, but she’s gone and...and now I...move on.” He hesitates, “That’s...what I did when I thought you’d died. I got on with it.”
Sherlock smiles, and that catches Johns attention. For a moment, he thinks he's going to say something on the case, but when he places the instrument back in its case and stands, he closes his book, "Sherlock?"
Sherlocks gaze holds on the street lamps across from him as he recites them, almost as if he's giving his speech again, "Intelligent, beautiful, talented and deeply caring."
His flatmate ignores him to walk over to the radio, and he wordlessly switches it on before fiddling with the dial. Johns heart sinks. He places the book on his side table with a drawn out sigh, "Can we have one night off?" When he doesn't get a reply, he rolls his eyes and stands, gesturing to the chairs, "Are we pushing these back then?"
Sherlock attempts to fix the atmosphere with a smile. He has an idea where John's going with this, but to him, it's a dig at Sherlocks own guilt, "Yes, I suppose it does."
A long silence comes between them as Sherlock watches him carefully and John looks at him with a glassy stare and a few giggles slip out as Sherlock finally comes forward to take the bottle from Johns hands. He places it on the floor, and steps to his right, but otherwise doesn't move to sit beside him, "You
There were a couple of things Sherlock hadn't told John, such as him also saying Mary deserved those same qualities (intelligent, beautiful, talented, deeply caring) in the man she were to be wed to, and that John had been the second person Sherlock had felt any romantic attachments to, but, really, they didn't exactly need to be said.
“Good.” He smiles, “We could still stay over for a few nights, if that’s okay.” Sherlock stops playing with the napkin, “But she couldn’t sleep in Mrs. Hudsons flat…”
In minutes, John finds himself asleep in a bed next to Sherlock, who’s lying on his side despite the pain in his ribs. Thanks to the morphine, he’s soon drifting off and John sighs into his pillow, facing the window - he’s both mentally and emotionally exhausted from these last few hours and he soon feels himself begin to be taken in...until…
John's blinking back tears, though doesn't say anything in reply, and they both go through the scans together. After a moment, Sherlock looks up at John, and something suddenly falls on him. How John's looking at the photos, how he has a gentle hold on them, how he opened it the moment he realised it was for him…
Sherlock pauses, and when he speaks again, it's like he's had a revelation, "You'll have to cancel the wedding."
“If it’s alright with you, John, I’d like to take this relationship slow. I know what Mrs. Hudson said, but I’d feel more comfortable if we were to get to know one another a bit more first. Is that okay?”
As he gets to the last shot, tears begin to well up in Sherlocks eyes and he hurriedly wipes his face before they stain his cheeks. He takes a shuddering breath, and John stirs beside him, turning over so he's facing him. To his surprise, Johns eyes slowly open to land on him, and he smiles softly at him,
"I had a friend at University; Victor Trevor. We were roommates. He was, I think, the first person I had felt...anything remotely close to romantic for."
John suddenly gives an impenitent giggle, and though it should somehow lighten the crackling tension in the air, it's just..made it worse, especially when Johns face relaxes and his eyes glaze over, "It's like a bloody soap. All that's missing is an affair."
John's halfway through his drink when Sherlock crosses the room, and he's snapped out of it upon hearing him grab something from beside him. Sherlock steps back as John looks up, and when he realises what he's holding, he stands in an instant, "Give it back."
Sherlock clenches his jaw. Despite the completely burning frustration over his flatemate, he just manages to put it aside to speak clearly for the first time since he came up here, "I know what she did was unforgivable. I know she hurt you and destroyed our lives, but you have got to listen to me when I say that you have to go back to her." When John starts shaking his head in disbelief, he sighs, "If you won't do it for her, then do it for Rosie."
As soon as her door shuts, Sherlock presses his lips to Johns, then when he draws back, John has to hide yet another burst of giggles at seeing Sherlocks usually pale face having turned a bright red.
John stares at him and his eyes widen slightly, "Because she shot you, you idiot." He puts a hand out in exasperation, "She almost
He’s about to continue up, but Sherlock takes his hand again and their eyes meet, “Would you mind if I thanked you now?”
what you call normal? Drinking your bodyweight in alcohol for weeks until you black out in the kitchen? Moping about the flat while your wife sits at home, 7 months pregnant as she deals with this alone? For gods sake, Mary
John glances at his own meal, thinks it over for a second, then makes up his mind, “We’re okay for now. But could we get another plate?”
John places his fork down and raises a hand to get a waiters attention. Sherlocks eyes widen, “What’re you doing?”
Sherlock slowly stops kissing him and bows his head in embarrassment as John stifles a giggle against Sherlocks curls. It’s like being caught by a parent. But John’s far over the moon to feel any sense of wrong-doing.
He had gone to get dinner for the both of them, having forgotten to order it on the phone, and knew that once he left the flat, John would start his challenge of 'How many glasses of alcohol can I down before Sherlock gets back?' Sherlock had calculated it on the way to the restaurant. He didn't
When he speaks again, his voice is soft and he doesn't even glance at John this time, "The speech I gave, it...wasn't everything I wanted to say. Though Lestrade had initially helped me, I had learnt from a few books that it's best to speak from the heart and...that's exactly what I did…" He trails off, almost confused at what he's admitting, "But it was almost an hour long, so obviously, I had to cut a few things out."
When they’re a long way off from the restaurant, it’s Sherlock who speaks first, “You could’ve gotten another dish. It was all on the house.”
John grins. With everything being said in the open, the atmosphere’s suddenly shifted into a more relaxed one, and he reaches over to lift the lid, “If you won’t have it, I will.”
"Not concerning the speech, no." He slowly exhales before thinking on his next set of sentences, and Johns phone buzzes in his pocket. But he ignores it. From how Sherlocks behaving, and his body posture, this must have been what he had been pondering over, and the cut outs of the speech were only the tip of the iceberg.
Mary has tears in her eyes as she watches them both and as John glances at her, he feels a weight taken from his chest. Looks at Sherlock again, “And I think I always knew that.” He tries a smile, but it only makes fresh tears form.
John snorts, "Right, well, I can't stop you." He turns to leave, but at this, the music stops abruptly and he moves back in time to see Sherlock putting the violin away, watching as he clicks the case closed before straightening up, and Johns heart squeezes when he sees utter sadness on his face, and though his eyes are still that ever pale blue, they're dim against the light.
No sooner are the words out of his mouth, then Sherlock slowly blinks awake and he looks over at John. Mary gives him one final smile, then leaves.
When he gets to the landing, his knees just about give out beneath him from the relief that floods him. Sherlock's stood at the window with his back to him, dressed in his sweats and silk gown. His violin is held in a loose grip against his side as he stares out at the street below. Though John's breathing loudly, and it's now clicking that he must have seen the cab stop outside, he hasn't moved at all to give a sign that he knows he's there and John doesn't step inside, only watches him as he slowly lifts the violin to his chin and starts playing a steady, sad melody, which John immediately picks up as a rendition of his and Marys waltz.
Sherlock doesn't reply, and they look at each other for a long while, until Sherlock comes forward to kiss John on the cheek. His eyes dart across his, "I know. It's okay."
John looks him over for a moment, before nodding, "Okay." His phone buzzes in his pocket and he automatically reaches down to grab it, making Sherlock take a few steps back. He reads it and his shoulders slump, "It's Mary. She's wondering where I am." He types a reply back, but still keeps the phone at eye level, "It's pretty late. I should be getting back…"
After the incident at the flat, John hadn't been able to sleep a wink. He had eventually come home at 8pm to, thankfully, find Mary had gone to bed early, and he had crawled in next to her. She had stirred but otherwise hadn't woken in the slightest, and though John had tried to get some shut eye himself, he just hadn't been able to get the thought of Sherlocks lips on his.
Sherlocks eyes crinkle, "Yes. A lot of what I wanted to say was too...personal, too…" He pauses, "Us."
Johns hand goes to his side. He blinks up at Sherlock, who’s fiddling with the napkin and refusing to look his way, “Um...Sherlock, I….that’s, um….thank you, but….”
As the song begins to fade out, Sherlock spins him one final time before turning him for the dip. The last move.
Sherlock bites back a genuine smile, though his face is shining, "Thank you, John, that...means a lot."
They sat in silence, both in their chairs, as they were meant to. John had been studying Sherlock the entire evening, not being able to find any symptoms of having suffered a trauma in Sherlock. After another thirty minutes, Sherlock grew annoyed. “What is it, John?” His voice was sharp, as he lowered his book. “Huh? Oh, I… Nothing”, John responded, trying to seem genuine, but obviously the detective was having none of it. The world’s most successful detective in the history of mankind wouldn’t fall for any of John’s lies, ever, and the doctor should have been aware of it. Sherlock’s stare was drilling holes through John’s skull. “You seemed to survive jail well”, John finally told him. For a fraction of a second Sherlock seemed confused, before his lips parted and he looked down, realizing, what John meant. “I was. Repeatedly”, he admitted silently, biting his teeth together. John could see Sherlock’s facial muscles tense up. “Oh my god, Sherlock… I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock always did look good in purple, but John wasn’t gonna dwell over that as he started to unbutton said color shirt. He had already discarded his jumper and Sherlock’s jacket on the floor. The detective looked absolutely delicious laying on his back on the bed, looking up at John with lustful eyes. Never mind John “Three Continents” Watson, this was a
God, he looked so beautiful, absolutely wrecked with pleasure. Judging from the lube, Sherlock did please himself every once in a while, but John was sure he had never experienced something this good. Sherlock’s ivory skin was covered in a thin sheet of sweat, riddled with hormones that made an intoxicating scent. His dark hair was messy and his plump lips parted, as he breathed heavily after John had guided him through his orgasm. The doctor completely ignored his own touch-starved erection, and just kneeled between Sherlock’s long legs and watched the beautiful view in front of him. Sherlock opened finally his eyes as the corners of his mouth tugged upwards. “That was… good. I apologize for my lack of a better word.”
“They said it was the only thing this pretty mouth of mine was good for”, Sherlock quietly said later that evening, laying in bed with John. They had showered and had dinner, before crawling back into Sherlock’s bed together. But as he saw the horror on John’s face, he realized, that he shouldn’t have said that. “I’m sorry, John, that was very insensitive of me-” “No, Sherlock. If you need to talk about it, talk about it. I’m here, I’ll listen, day or night. Don’t you once think you have to keep this inside.” John was almost defensive, sounding nearly… Angry? Had Sherlock angered him? “You are the world’s most brilliant, most successful detective. Your mouth tells the rest of us what’s going through your head, and it’s bloody brillint. The most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed”, the doctor kept talking, looking at Sherlock with a serious look. “Don’t ever think they were right.” “Thank you, John.”
“Good god, John!” Sherlock’s body was tensing up and he felt a heat building in his stomach, pushing him to worm against John’s fingers even more desperately. John knew Sherlock was chasing his climax, so he added just a little more pressure in massaging, and wrapped his other hand around Sherlock’s twitching cock. A few strokes did it, and Sherlock came undone with a cry.
“I want to.” John felt his heart stop for a second, as he looked into Sherlock’s silvery blue eyes. Sherlock actually wanted to have sex with John. It couldn’t have all been the effect of one good orgasm, could it? “But you just climaxed”, John protested. “I recover fast, doctor”, Sherlock smirked at him. John shook his head, slightly amused at Sherlock’s reply. “You sure?” he confirmed, and got an eager nod in response.
Sherlock looked around and soon spotted John, his face lighting up a little. Clearly he had not expected John to be there when he would finally be released. The detective strode over to his doctor, who grabbed him in a tight hug. It felt good. John felt Sherlock’s dark, smooth curls and breathed in his fresh scent. Sherlock had showered and shaved, and judging by the short strands of hair on his shoulders, he had gotten a hair cut as well. He looked exactly the same as the day Lestrade had cuffed him. John was sure half the department had volunteered as the arresting officer, but due to their history and Lestrade’s undeniable fondess for Sherlock, Greg had handled the arresting himself.
John shakes his head, "I can't believe I'm having this conversation with you..." He raises his voice a notch, and it's bitten with frustration. At Sherlock or himself, he doesn't know, "Yes, I am. But I'm just
“That’s our dynamic, isn’t it?” Sherlock looks over at him, his brows knitting together as John shrugs, “It’s been like that for years.”
Sherlock looks away, grabbing the pieces again, “Well, I could get the nurse to bring in another bed if that would suit you better.”
Sherlock pauses to gauge his emotions, and he points behind him when he sees Johns eyes glint in the light, "Actually, you know what, this can wait till morning - "
"Mm, I agree." He hesitates, "I also said that we had talked about marriage, and…" His voice falls away again, and he blinks but picks it up as if realising where he is, "And how we had discussed it a few times…" He stops, and his eyes linger on Johns face in the reflection, but it goes unnoticed by him.
Sherlock eyes him curiously, but doesn't say another word and John walks over to him as he voices a "got it" and spins a different dial so the volume increases. In one swift move, he turns and holds out a hand as a light piano begins filtering through the speakers and John smiles, letting Sherlocks fingers curl around his own, with his other hand coming round to encircle his waist while Johns rests lightly on his shoulder. As the lyrics start, Sherlock easily leads them into a simple box step, and it doesn't take long for them to find their own rhythm; in the months prior, John had been possibly the worst student Sherlock had had to teach - he would stumble over both their feet, keep his eyes down at all times, and eventually he would feel so awkward and uncomfortable that they'd have to cut their lesson short while he'd apologised profusely and said he would try harder next time. To his surprise, Sherlock had been wonderfully considerate with him; he hadn't once snapped at him, and had been so incredibly patient that John had wondered more than once how he had gotten so lucky to have somebody like him to be giving him lessons.
"I…um..." His gaze roams the people dancing around them, but there's no sign of him anywhere. He frowns when his eyes land on Molly, who's on the other side of the crowd in a group with Mrs. Hudson and Tom, and she looks over with a grim expression; even from this distance, he can still make out the words 'he left' falling from her lips.
John nods, "Okay…" When Sherlock doesn't continue, it quickly dawns on him that he's waiting for a response, "Oh...yeah, that would've given them something to talk about." He forces a laugh, but it sounds strangled, and he clams up.
Sherlock looks at him evenly. He knows he's crossing a line. He knows he should have walked out and left it alone. But he couldn't bloody help himself. He glances at the package, then holds Johns gaze, "They're scan pictures, aren't they?"
Sherlock swallows, now feeling a lump has formed in his throat. From all that bloody emotion. John laughs quietly and carefully swipes some tears away, "You thinking about what happened yesterday?"
John stops, and he goes to respond, but sees that Sherlock really does mean that, and his voice becomes sincere, “Sherlock, you’re the most brilliant person I’ve ever met. Why would I turn away from all this?”
He doesn't need to be told who 'she' is. They've had this unspoken conversation every single day since John came back here.
“Mrs. Hudson’s looking after her. I organised it while you were out.” John swallows when he sees one of Sherlocks eyes’re bloodshot and he feels a wave of guilt wash over him.
As they’re about to part, a door from below opens and Mrs. Hudson appears in a light purple nightie, “Oh, you’re back.”
When John finally moves on to his fortune cookie, he realises Sherlock’s got his eyes on him again, “You’re not opening your cookie, then?”
Johns heart speeds up and a lump makes it’s presence in his throat. He goes down a step to be at Sherlocks height, and is just able to voice a quiet ‘sure’, before Sherlock softly kisses him. With his other hand, he cups Johns face, and John rests a hand on Sherlocks shoulder, the silk of his shirt between his fingers.
It’s a stew of some kind, poured over a serving of rice with peas in the corner, and a small pudding cup off to the side. Though it looks anything but appetizing, John hasn’t eaten in hours, and it shows as he begins to dig in. Sherlock leans back on the pillow and stares out the window, hands on his lap, and he doesn’t speak until John makes a move for the pudding, his eyes lingering on the tray when he sees it’s almost cleared.
He throws the covers off and quietly pads out of the room, phone gripped tightly in his hand. Using the light to guide him, he makes his way to the kitchen to grab a glass from the cabinet, and crouches down to find the bottle of scotch in a small cupboard under the bench. After pouring himself one, he leans against the table and with the glass in his fingers, finally taps open the message:
“Not hungry?” When Sherlock doesn’t answer, John reaches over to take his hand away, “Hey, stop staring. You can admire me back at the flat.” That shakes him out of it. John sits back in his chair, “Now eat.”
Sherlock bristles. He feels a sudden anger begin to rise in him, and his body tightens, "This isn't about you. None of this is."
John feels a lump settle in his throat, and as he watches Sherlock leave, his vision blurs with tears. When he's gone, he wipes them away and goes back inside.
. Please, go home. We'll talk about this tomorrow...today - look, I." He sighs, "Goodnight, Sherlock."
“Maybe you’ve found your true calling, Sherlock.” Before he can reply, John’s cracking open his, and Sherlock settles for quietly watching him, the flame making his eyes more alight than they are.
John shakes his head before Sherlock can carry on, “No...No, you didn't deserve that. That was way out of line, Sherlock, I never should have laid a hand on you like that.” He stops, voice low. “You have no idea how guilty I felt after what I’d done. I regretted it as soon as I saw you on the floor.”
Sherlock smiles, and he gives him a final thank you kiss before they go inside. The place has been cleaned up thanks to the police team, and there’s no sign that a crime scene ever took place here. He lets go of Johns hand to head to the kitchen to put the kettle on, and when he’s out of sight, John takes his fortune from his pocket to re-read what it had really said:
That's it. Nothing more. Sherlock still hovers at the door, but when he knows for sure John's done with the conversation, he begins to slip out, until a thin brown package sticking out of his nightstand drawer catches his eye.
