“Honestly, nothing,” Sherlock said. “We have the bottle warmer, the steriliser, all the clothes and linens, the bassinet, bath things.” He paused. “Diapers of course, Mycroft recommended a service and we've got them on standby, but I have to admit, I'm reticent about allowing that many people access to the house.”
“Does she appreciate how accommodating you are?” Sherlock asked.
"Oh, lovely, thank you."
“The ravens don’t keep London from falling.” John rubbed his hand up the furrow of Sherlock’s spine, rumpling his tee-shirt.  “I could say the same about you.”  He held his hand tight to the base of Sherlock’s neck. “Please, just for a few more weeks.  When the baby comes, we’ll figure out what to do then.”
“John, it’s such a pleasure to finally meet you.  I’m Zilpha Holmes, Sherlock’s mother.”
“I may have to get a tablet computer,” Sherlock said, continuing as if John had just walked in.  “I anticipate that I will likely be spending more time than normal in bed or on the sofa.  This  phone is adequate for reading short articles but it’s going to strain my eyes shortly.”
John’s jaw started to ache, his shoulder burning faintly as his body began to protest being held in one position for so long.  He moved his free hand from Sherlock’s hip, sliding it up the curve of his arse, tracing the cleft there.  Sherlock mimicked his motions, pressing down against John’s arse, just as John was doing the same to him.  John’s crack was already slick, sopping from the liberal application of Sherlock’s saliva.  John brought his hand to his face, swiped the slick off his own chin, and brought his finger back to Sherlock’s hole, pushing down.
“It looks fine.  Alright, I’ll go let her in.”
“You were gone for hours, on a case, in the river, I don’t even know where you are and oh, even if I did it’s not as if I could come to you because you left me alone with the egg.”
“Where did it come from?”  John had never known Sherlock to order anything from the internet, not since he had John to boss around.  It wasn’t that he was computer illiterate-- quite the opposite-- but rather that he became bored by the redundant design of the sites and would quit halfway through, before securing the delivery of his item.
"Mummy came with us every time we visited, and Father travelled to England at least twice a year.  It worked well for them."  Sherlock's chin was digging into John's shoulder, almost painful.
“And you’re sure you won’t find out the gender before the baby is born?”
John felt Sherlock breach him just as he pressed into Sherlock, perfect symmetry, warm cling around his finger even as he felt his own hole twitch against Sherlock’s finger.  Seconds later there was a sense of straining in his throat, a rhythmic pulsing all along the length of his tongue, steady squeeze and release around his finger even as he felt himself coming, all of Sherlock’s motions echoed in his own body.  He swallowed reflexively, easing his head back onto the pillow as Sherlock’s cock softened.  Sherlock’s fingers were twined in his, holding on tight, nearly crushing John’s hand, but only lightly touching the egg.
Sherlock turned his head, looking up at John.  His hair lay in dark ringlets over his forehead, and with his last working braincell John thought he looked like a debauched angel.
“I’ll just bring this up to Sherlock,” Mrs. Holmes said.  “Back in a moment.”
“Eventually, perhaps.  She’ll be far too small to be in her own room for a while, and for now I think it likely behooves us to at least keep the option of a second bedroom.”
Sherlock reached forward slowly, so slowly that John didn't flinch despite his outstretched finger landing directly on the tip of his nose. "Your columella is distinctly lower than your ala, which are even," Sherlock said, pressing slightly on the tip of his nose, until the cartilage gave slightly.  "That feature is highly correlated with what is aesthetically referred to as a Roman nose, although in truth it's quite common amongst Germanic people as well.  Your nose, though, does not possess the coarser bridge that often goes with that nose, and while the tip of your nose is turned up, just here," he slid his finger disarmingly close to John's nostril, "it is not a snub nose.  In a police artist's composite book, a picture of your nose would be filed under both Roman and Ideal, and there would be hundreds of like examples."
John looked up and grinned, feeling the stretch of the dry skin on his lips when he did, imagined that his mouth looked much like Sherlock’s, now.
John’s heart sank.  “Do you not want me to sleep in your bed?”  The size of the bed that he’d seen looked more than commodious, and more than that he wanted to be near both Sherlock and the egg.  He’d never been married, but he was used to sleeping next to his partners.
"John, please," Sherlock's voice was clear, muffled only a bit by the bed as he tried to slide backwards, fitting himself more tightly to John's cock.
He drew in a breath to speak, wanting to point it out to Sherlock, but he was surprised by the sob that burst out of him, his face heating as his entire chest shook with it, a shuddering breath followed by the tears hot on his cheeks.  He wiped his hand over his face but he couldn’t stop, his lower lip shaking as he tried to blink his eyes clear.
"Hello," Sarah said, composed despite the fact that Anthea was weaving in and out of traffic in a frankly alarming way.  "Will you be joining us for lunch?"
“Of course.”  Annborg shut the door behind her as she left, and John felt cocooned again, content to occupy the few square feet that held the three of them.
“You have, haven’t you,” John said. “Did you imagine this day?”
John didn't doze, but he was quiet, his hand finally still where it rested against Sherlock's back.  When he lifted his arm his hand was steady.
John sat in silence until the car slowed to a stop.  Looking outside he realized they weren't home at all, only paused outside a shop.  He dashed inside, bought two bottles of Lucozade and two packets of crisps, then walked back out to the waiting car, hoping he didn't look like a nutter being picked up by men in black outside a bloody newsagents.
John turned the egg around.  "You will.  Probably other things I'm not even thinking of yet.  You're not going to be able to apply logic to this."
“Sherlock.”  She set her bag down on the floor and went to him, bending forward to press her forehead against his.  Sherlock sat still and suffered the affection.  “About two degrees higher than normal,” she said, straightening, revealing that maybe it wasn’t only affection after all.
"I won't even ask why that's significant," John said, but he took the money, grateful for that little reprieve.
“Alright, then, I’m off.”
"So soon?"
Sherlock nipped at the back of his neck.  “Maybe I have and you just haven’t noticed.  She is, in reality, as unassuming as Mycroft.”
“You know what I mean.”  She went back to cutting the chicken into broad strips, the skin already neatly disposed of.
John felt the soft skin of Sherlock’s stomach against the back of his fingers as Sherlock licked a broad stripe up the side of his cock, tip of his tongue tracing around the head, pushing down on the thin ridge of his foreskin.  John shivered, fingers spreading, holding the egg more loosely, attentive even as Sherlock drew him deep into his mouth.  John let his hips arch up, cock sliding slowly deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, soft bump of the head against Sherlock’s soft palate making him shiver anew.
John felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up.  He knew that candling didn’t have anything to do with an actual flame, not now, anyway, but the urge to protect the egg was still strong.
"We're supposed to read to babies from the first days of their life," John said.  "It's good for brain development."
He laughed softly as the camera's picture blurred and moved again, Sherlock holding the camera to capture his own face.  He wore a black watch cap, his only nod to being incognito on a night when most people didn't notice anything in front of their own faces, but it was unmistakably him.  He spoke briefly, and then the screen went dark.
John woke to find the bed empty, his stretching arms encountering nothing, not even a warm spot on the sheets. Since the egg it was unusual for he and Sherlock to wake separately, but somehow the man had gotten out of bed without him noticing. John rolled over onto his back, breathing deeply, just taking a moment to start his day. When he rolled over it took him a moment to figure out what was different about the room. There was no bassinet, no mobile. His feet hit the floor with a muffled thud and he made his way down the stairs awkwardly, torn between walking slowly, as if some time would help him figure it all out, and breaking into a run.
John hurried to Sherlock’s side, sitting close, thigh to thigh, the anxiety of not having been able to hear a thing over the last week weighing on him.  The firm curved surface of the egg was not ideal for his stethoscope, only the rush of blood in his own ears evident when he tried.  The doppler made a hissing static noise as it glided over the curved surface.  Then a rushing noise, vital but insubstantial, and then a heartbeat.  He let go of the breath he’d been holding, relieved to hear such a human sound.  He counted in his head, estimating.  A placental human’s heart rate was at least 120 at this stage of development.  Even considering the egg’s accelerated development the rate seemed slow, only about 90.
"Hello John, Dr. Sawyer," she said as they settled themselves in the back.
Sherlock bent his head, leaning his forehead against John’s.  “Never.”  He pressed a kiss to John’s mouth, lingering there before stepping back.  “What did we come in here for?”
"But we need to talk about how, exactly," John said, exasperated.  The higher temperature that the egg imparted always left him feeling a little irritable at first, and Sherlock was doing nothing to allay that.
“But then you decided not to.”  Mycroft pulled out a cloth and shook it out, then folded it in half and laid it over John’s right shoulder. “I never guess.”
“In a few short weeks now, I'll be getting up more than once each night,” Sherlock pointed out. “Might as well get some practice in.”
“Hello,” Sherlock said softly, reaching in and brushing his fingers over the whorl of hair, careful to avoid the soft fontanels.
“I’ll work fewer hours,” John said, “if you don’t take anymore bloody reckless cases.”
“Yeah,” John said, as it hit him, too.  “The baby.  Not the egg.  The baby.”
"No, I was not."  John traced the bump of the egg, trying to feel its contours the way Sherlock had shown him.  It wasn't quite as clear without Sherlock's hand guiding him, but it was obviously there, firm and immovable.  "And I want this too.  I want to do this with you."  He had stumbled over the words, had almost said
"Well.  Good then."
John shook his head. “I kept it free because your father was supposed to be coming?”
"John."  Sherlock hadn't moved from the table, didn't even bother lifting his head before asking for his attention.
“But where is the egg?” John found himself yelling, his voice finally clear.
“I’ve felt much the same.  As for me I could put it down to hormones, but I don’t know of any mechanism that would allow you to be so impacted from such a distance.”
"We lived, at that time, in a small community in Norway, near Stryn.  I was being educated with a number of other
Sherlock was goading Mycroft about something, a modified limited hang out, whatever that was, when John realized that he had been staring at Sherlock's profile for far too long.  He tore his gaze away, realized that while he was looking at Sherlock, Zilpha had been looking at him.
John sighed with relief.  “I didn’t realize she was still in the city.”
Leaning forward it was far easier to kiss him, the weight of John's body holding Sherlock in place, rather than his arms, but Sherlock's neck was still craned.  Some small part of John cared, even as he seemed to be taken over by an animalistic urge to just keep fucking, no matter what might be happening to Sherlock.
) and he let himself be pulled into a loose, genteel embrace, the navy wool of her light jacket soft under his hands.   She kissed each of his cheeks quickly, too quick for him to even think of reciprocating, and he simply stepped back as she did, sliding her hands down his arms to clasp his hands in hers for a fraction of a second before letting go.  Her hands were strong, short fingernails, and she was dressed simply and warmly-- heavy navy trousers, a crisp dark blouse, the wool jacket.  If John hadn’t known Sherlock he would have guessed that she was a retired woman who spent a lot of time either in her garden, or perhaps with horses.  That might still be true, he reasoned, though there had to be more to it than that.
“I have to admit that I did not. I have had a difficult time picturing her, or him. Every now and then I think I feel some movement, but it's so different from my expectations for the end of a gestation that I just can't picture her. Or him.”
John growled at him, nipping against Sherlock's mouth before he pulled away, leaning and twisting enough that he could pull on Sherlock's right leg.  Sherlock was pliant enough to let him, and in moments John had both of his knees hooked over his shoulders, Sherlock's thighs spread enough to be out of the way as John leaned over him, Sherlock's cock brushing against his stomach.
John ventures out to work while Sherlock stays home with the egg.
When he stepped inside, Sherlock was much as he'd imagined him, laid out on the sofa, dark blue dressing gown only accentuating his pale skin.  He'd showered, and his hair looked darker than ever, splayed out behind him on a cushion.  A glass of cloudy liquid sat on his chest, barely sipped, from the looks of it.
"I'll be here by then," John said, trying not to think of all the times he had missed her in the past.
He nearly held his breath waiting for the response.
“So would Mycroft, though,”  John said, thinking of all the times Mycroft had anticipated their needs, surveillance or not.  “So would your father.”  The fortified entry way was a testament to his unwillingness to let a need go unaddressed.  He set his hand on the worktop, steadying himself.  The Holmes family, as it turned out, was by far the most supportive one he had ever been a part of, and somehow that fact seemed to have snuck up on him.
"Already?"  But even as he spoke John was reaching out towards him, hand grasping his hip again as he pulled himself closer.  The way Sherlock was lying, John's stronger shoulder was down when he spooned up behind him, surely not an accident.  He slid his right arm under Sherlock's shoulder and brought it up, holding Sherlock tightly against his chest.  Sherlock's greater height meant that John's face was about level with his higher shoulder, a strange feeling.  Spooning behind women, he'd often been able to lean forward to kiss them, or they'd been able to lean back.  He kissed Sherlock's shoulder in apology, even though Sherlock would have had no idea why.
John thought about that for a moment, a growing sense of annoyance growing at the back of his mind.  “Why?”
John finally worked up the momentum to pull backwards, nearly groaning with the loss of the tight warm slick, then snapped his hips forward.  He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's hips, holding him tight against his own pelvis, his thrusts short and hard, the urge to somehow get himself deeper into Sherlock's body almost overwhelming.
, but
“It's the hormones.” Sigeursonn looked reticent, an interesting expression on his face that had been, until that moment, entirely devoid of any kind of apparent self awareness. “Were you not going to try to find out?”
"Does that make you the mother in this scenario?" John asked.
“Good.” John found himself going from fear to fear. Now that the crisis of the nightmare was over it was as if his mind wanted to rove to every other worry he might have. “I hope I can deliver what our child needs.”
"The fact that some people take this other than medicinally is a blight upon common sense," Sherlock opined before he sipped at it.
"And the world would be poorer for it, but you wouldn't have suffered.  I didn't want you to die, because I didn't want to live in a world without you in it."
I started writing this story a long time ago, and I worked on it in bits and pieces.  There are scenes and themes that cropped up in more than one place.  I did my best to stitch the pieces together, but there's some repetition.  However, I have to assume that if you've read this far in a story about Sherlock and John incubating an egg that you're not going to give up over the number of times John thinks about baby clothes.
Sherlock nodded. “Echos of my previous betrayal, of course.” He put his hand on the table, palm up. “I will never, at any cost, lie to you again.”
"But even with you?"
“I ate adequately.”  Sherlock’s attention was still on the electronic reader he was holding. John bit his tongue, but Sherlock had already noticed, or anticipated, his look.  “It’s a Kindle.  There is no EMF from it at all.”
“Until recently, I’d say,” John said.
“I doubt that even Mycroft has the power to make you a prisoner here,” Sherlock mused.  “Though I also wouldn’t put it past him.  The symbolism would be right up his alley.”
“What indeed,” John asked.  “Keeping the other party comfortable is a kindness, don’t you think, at times?”
"That's the right word," John allowed.  "But what do we do about the others?"
"Oh, Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock dismissed this with a wave of his hand.  "She's aware of my origins.  She'll be only too delighted.  I'm sure she's been waiting for this."
John fought against his knee-jerk urge to ask "how did that make you feel," knowing that with Sherlock, anyway, it was the wrong tack.
"No, he's single, no kids," though as soon as he said it he realized that for all he knew Mycroft might have a country home and an entire passel of children.  It was so ludicrous a thought that he pushed it out of his mind quicker than he'd initially rejected the idea of men laying eggs.
"Sherlock's fine."  It wasn't a lie.  If he was able to text about self-care then he was fine, for a given value of fine.
Later that week John returned from another shift at the surgery to find Sherlock on the sofa, feet dangling over the arm, the egg in the shallow dish of his abdomen.  He’d consistently failed to put on any weight despite his unusual inactivity-- it was the higher temperature, combined with the fact that if he was engrossed in what he was reading he would forget to eat.  John had to remind him, when he was home, but as the days had ticked down from 90 he’d become more and more aware of the fact that he’d want to work less when the egg hatched, possibly less around the time that it was due to hatch, as well.  Sherlock’s work brought in money, but inconsistently, and even though Sherlock continued to earn through his consulting John felt the approaching due date of the egg keenly.  He was about to be a father, and fathers provided for their children, full stop, even if certain consulting detectives told them that they needn’t worry.
At first John thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, or the light had shifted, but there was truly a thin crack running along the top third of the shell.  As he watched it widened and other cracks sprang from its edges, reaching towards the thicker ridge that ran around the middle.
Back at the flat John ran up the steps, the desire to hold the egg foremost in his mind.  What he saw when he opened the door stopped him in his tracks.
"Hmmm."  Sherlock shifted, carefully putting one leg over John's thigh, hitching him closer still.  "I think what you mean is that, were there a baby here who needed you right now, you'd put your own needs aside for the infant."
“Gathering wool?” Sherlock asked.
“That’s true,” Annborg said, moving from her spot on the bed to stand in front of them.  “In most respects she will have the same milestones as a gestational infant.”
"Am I hurting you?"  John pulled back, leaving the tips of his fingers inside, then slipped in with his smallest finger too, pushing in beyond his knuckles, only his thumb left outside, slotted neatly against the base of Sherlock's spine.
as they referred to us, children who had been hatched.  They were, for all intents and purposes, my cousins.  It was a happy time, and the idea of secrecy was woven into the stories that we were told.  Secrecy imparted to children by adults is considered sinister in most cases, but this was entirely benign.  By the time we came back to England Sherlock was three, and I was ten.  The most exotic thing about me, other than my intellect, which I was able to conceal just to the point of assimilation, was the fact that I spoke Norwegian.  It never occurred to me to tell anyone that I'd come from an egg.  It just wasn't a topic that ever presented itself."
“Right, then, see you tonight.” John practically threw himself out the door, the urge to simply stay in the flat overwhelming until he’d made it to the street.  The egg seemed to have a certain hold over Sherlock as well-- he seemed entirely unperturbed at the prospect of being relatively still all day long, and while his moods had waxed and waned the entire time John had known him, from fierce energy to stubborn lassitude, he’d never seemed content with being still until now.
“Just a magic trick,” Sherlock said softly.
“Is he alright?” John asked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, while John wondered if he was supposed to be confirming the fact that they knew time had passed, or that the egg was warmer.
"Do you have a boppy?" Sherlock asked.
“Annborg has been back to the flat to check on the egg and I several times over the past few weeks.  She’s only come when you were at work.”
“Probably Mummy,” Sherlock said, taking a slice for each of them to the toaster.  “She would think of this.”
Sherlock rubbed his chest, looking thoughtful while John held his breath.  "No.  We're not."
“Must have been a terrible dream.”
John turned himself around so he was looking up at Sherlock, who was looming over him now.  "Sometimes it is kinder not to be entirely to the point.  We've discussed this."
Anborg looked mildly amused.  “Let me know how that plan works for you.”  She ran her hand over the mattress, covered with a simple sheet, ran her hand around the edges of the oval mattress, nodding when she found no gaps.  “I’m glad you have a modern bassinet.  I brought a warming pad for you, from,” she paused, thinking.  “From Sherlock’s great aunt.  Or if not, Sigersonn calls her auntie, so I’m going to assume that’s correct.”
“No, caffeine has no effect on me.” Sherlock's hand wave was second nature, John was sure. He pulled down the orange pekoe and prepared a strainer for each of them. Sherlock watched him prepare the tea in silence, speaking only once John had seated himself at the table.
The conversation was nowhere near as stilted as John would have feared with at least three of the five people at the table pretending that no one else knew the nature of their work.  John complemented Anthea on the orange sauce she'd used on the stir-fry, and she'd guilelessly admitted that it was something she'd picked up in Beijing while working in a Fangshan restaurant.  John didn't even ask the obvious questions--
“She seems very nice.  I only spoke with her for a few moments.”  John turned the egg slightly, rotating its smooth surface against his skin.  It was almost instinctual, trying to make sure it was evenly heated.  Even though it had been less than a minute he could feel his temperature going up, a certain amount of heat behind his eyes.  It wasn’t painful, but it was still, even after the weekend he’d spent with the egg on and off, surprising.
John thought for a moment, trying to place it.  "It's rather high church, isn't it?"
"You're planning on telling Sarah at lunch that you're expecting a baby in a few weeks.  She's going to be shocked, and you're preparing yourself to handle that shock, and to tell a lie which, as we've covered, you are adequate at but not adept.  I stand by my assessment though.  She will be so excited that any issues with your duplicity will be covered by her own rush of adrenaline." Sherlock stood up, the egg a smooth green mass on his stomach.  John still wasn't quite over the fact that Sherlock was, no matter what he said, the baby's mother, and he looked the part now.
John took his hand. “At any cost.”
John turned to him, standing so close he had to look practically straight up.  “Ours must never include us living in separate countries,” he said.
John shivered.  “I think I’d rather not contemplate that.”
“Why are you home?” Sherlock asked at the same time.  He slipped his phone back into his pocket.  “I put her on the floor because she’s moving so vigorously it’s shaking the egg about.  This way she can’t roll off of any surface onto the floor, as she’s already there.”
Sherlock glared at the empty glass.  "I remember the pain.  It was excruciating, and I use the term in its original sense of harkening to an actual crucifixion."
“No doubt,” Mycroft said as he turned to the dresser. “Now, if I know Sherlock he would have placed the burp cloths,” his hand hovered over the knobs, then chose the drawer closest to the bed. “Aha.”
"Having all that sorted out.  Mycroft made it sound as if you'd have a much more difficult time of it."
"I kept thinking that I would explain, soon, and then I never did.  Cowardice.  But I did most of my eating when you were out of the flat, at work, though I also ate meals with you."
"Greg Lestrade, Sherlock, Inspector Lestrade.  Remember, one of the three people you went into hiding to protect?"  John would have thought that Sherlock's inability to remember that simple fact was a put on except for the fact that he was so consistent.
John tilted his head up, looking out the window.  The light was fading, but still warm.
“Do you need something to drink? Some water? I can get up and make you some tea if you like.”
“The Themes,” Sherlock replied. “It’s not half clean at this time of the year, and the scent was repellent. “  John breathed in deeply and thought he could smell some of it still, likely clinging to Sherlock’s hair, which was covering his head in stiff ringlets.
"It's John she wants to talk to," Anthea said, slipping back into her seat.  "Go on."
"Egg," Sherlock said, gesturing to his stomach.
“The egg?” Sherlock paused to look at him. “The egg is gone, John. It amounted to nothing, in the end.”
He had barely made a dent in the pile when the phone chirped again.
“Hmmm.”  A black town car glided to a stop in front of them.  “We’ll see if Mycroft has a different opinion about that.”
John opened his eyes and looked up at Sherlock's earnest face, and couldn't help but smile at him.  "Why can't you just say that it makes you happy to see me."
“Shall I give you a moment before I send up Mummy and Daddy?” Mycroft asked.
“Not correct, but correct only in that it is the image Mummy has cultivated.  That may be her only connection to gardening, that I know of.  She keeps her fingernails short and her hands unadorned because she can’t be bothered with the tedium of cosmetics and jewelry, but she does not have any of the other marks on her hands that would be typical for an equestrian, and there is certainly none of the dirt or tannin stain that would be typical for a gardener.”
“We shouldn’t have left you alone for so long,” John said, relieved to see that the glassy look to her eyes was resolving.
“You’re routinely gone for ten hours, many days of the week,” Sherlock countered. “Surely I can be forgiven for daring to go outside for twelve in one week?”
John held still, every muscle in his body screaming for motion.
John was silent for a moment, looking at Ann, who seemed to be making a point of looking at the steer skull on the wall.  Sherlock had stated that they couldn’t stop the development of the foetus, not that he
"And his family?  Everyone has something," she pointed out.
The extent to which Sherlock did not believe in an afterlife sometimes surprised John, who believed it in with a vague sort of misty conception of a heaven full of clouds and a benevolent God who touched the earth with fingers made of light in old paintings.  If challenged he would have been hard pressed to define his beliefs, but when he had asked to be allowed to live, there'd been a distinct sense of someone listening, and not only in the manner of a dying man's desperation.
The texts started not soon after.
"The first few times at least it will go well."  Sherlock trailed off, his tone not inviting further consideration on the matter.  “Are you going to work today?”
"Surprised you can't figure it out, John.  Cramp."  He was pale, now, sweating, the curls at the edge of his forehead already damp.
Sherlock had only just gone into the kitchen when there was a knock at the door.  He walked through the living room, alert and focused, almost worried, and John felt his own apprehension building.  It was only the fact that he could hear Mrs. Hudson’s pleasant tone of voice that kept him from anxiously demanding that Sherlock somehow prove it was an expected guest.  He stayed seated as Sherlock opened the door, trying not to crane his neck for a glimpse of the visitor.
“Alright.”  She smiled at them.  “I’ll see you soon.”
Sherlock sniffed.  “He won’t tell me.”
Sherlock's father comes to visit.
She stood carefully.  “I think so, yes.”
"Would it be so awful to have to admit that you're attracted to me?"  Sherlock's fingers on the back of John's head weren't quite pushing him down, but keeping him there, so John couldn't meet his gaze.
“There never was an egg, John, not really. It was just an illusion that you were all too willing to go along with. Think about it.” He waited, as if he were a teacher and John was a recalcitrant student. “Could you really, truly believe something so ridiculous?”
“We can see far more with x-ray, but there’s the exposure of the foetus to think of,” Ann said.  “Ultrasound works only so far on the firm shell of the egg, and MRI would take the egg away from its parents for too long.”
John was still reluctant to leave, even as Sherlock feigned (or, more possibly, actually possessed) nonchalance on the sofa.
"Hmm?"
She chuckled.  “Didn’t think I had any of those left.”
“The egg is gone, John. It never really was an egg, not as you understand an egg to be. It was just an illusion.” Sherlock's smile was ugly, his mouth twisted to a strange extent. “You know I'm good at those.”
John leaned against the edge of the kitchen table, somber as he thought about the truth at the bottom of that statement.  His first assessment of the flat, years ago, had been that it was full of junk, but he’d had nothing to add to it other than a few clothes, his laptop, a mug, and his gun.
"Exactly.  Everyone was shocked at how quickly I forgave him in the first place.  Telling people we were a couple just seemed beyond the pale.  So I just kept not telling."
"What? Oh, no.  I mean it resolved with menopause, of course."
Sherlock followed his gaze.  “There’s nothing about the ravens that inherently keeps London from falling, and I know that.  But if someone did let them go, do you not think that there would be hell to pay?”
“Mrs. Hudson!”  He was moving again, swift careful steps to where she was lying on her back on the sofa, the egg carefully cradled against her stomach and her arm, leaning on the back of the sofa.
“He didn't say?”
"Alright, fine, I see your point, but it doesn't change the fact that Lestrade is going to ask where you are, might even show up at the flat looking for you."
"No, I," she trailed off, pressing her lips together, hard, until he could see something of Sherlock in the expression, the shape of her jaw, the determined cast to her eyes.  "I love both of my sons.  I worry about them both.  Mothers do.  Parents do.  I used to worry that Sherlock would die, when he was younger. I was always afraid that he was going to die in some horrible place, where I couldn't find him.  Mycroft told you about when he was twenty-one?  I thought he might die that day, and at least I'd have known where he was.  Then he improved, so much.  He had work that interested him, and even if he was still alone he wasn't bored.  And then he had a friend, so shocking, so wonderful, and then he died."  Even the memory of it was enough to leech the color from her face.  She took a deep breath.  "Once he was back, that was enough, it had to be enough.  I'd given up worrying that he'd be lonely.  What could that matter, now that he was alive?  Who could ask for something more?  No one gets this.  No one gets to have this, but we did.  His father and I got our child back, Mycroft got his brother back.  I just let go of the hope that he'd find someone.  But now he has you."  Her hands that had formerly been clutching at the edge of the sink reached towards him, and he took her hands, cool and smooth, in his own. She pulled on him, and he stepped forward, hugging her awkwardly, one arm around her shoulders as she rested her face on his jumper.  He wasn't sure if she was sobbing, but she began holding him very tight, one hand clutching his bad shoulder hard enough for it to smart all the way down his back.  He looked up as he gingerly rubbed a hand up and down her back, and realized that from where she'd been standing Mycroft could see him.  Mycroft nodded, almost imperceptibly, then looked away as Mrs. Holmes loosed her grip on John and stepped back, taking a deep breath.  "Thank you, John.  I think you'll find that most of the time I am not easily overcome."
Sherlock picked up the pace on John’s cock, sucking harder, pulling back to let his tongue swirl firmly around the shaft before swallowing him down again.  John groaned, earning him a firmer press of Sherlock’s cock against his throat, the barest fraction of a second of feeling like he might gag, then the acceptance as his body took him in again.  Sherlock’s hand was shaking next to his, almost fluttering over the egg, over the back of John’s hand, as if he was fighting not to squeeze down.  John felt relaxed, like keeping his hand loose was easy.   He wrapped his thumb and first finger around Sherlock’s hand, and held him steady.
"Yes."
"And you've no other family?"
Sherlock remained on the sofa when they entered, but did sit up.
“We know,” Sherlock said.  “And if she is sleeping in the bed with us we need to reduce our pillows and blankets as well.”
"What's wrong with him?" John asked, emboldened by Mycroft's show of sentiment.  It was likely only a show, but still, it worked.
“I figured as much.  And, it was easier to let Mycroft be the one to tell you, especially as I was taking ill at the time.  Not really the conversation to have through a closed door.”
"I already was.  Consider it practice."
"Please trust me, and please, go away!"  The last was shouted as Sherlock hurled himself through the door, slamming it shut behind him.
"I think this way would be best," he said, his voice quiet, but still clear.
“Oh really,” John said.  “How was I operating?”
.  If Sherlock felt controlled by chemicals, then it was John's duty, however much it might hurt, to respect his great mind and step away and respect the choices Sherlock had made when he was in his right mind.  Even Mycroft had alluded to it.  Sherlock would not turn back to drugs as long as he had his work-- not as long as he had John.  After all, he'd left John in favor of his work, once.  He could do it again.
“It was good enough that I have looked forward to meeting you, and I have no qualms about you being a partner to my son.”
“Not long at all.”  John felt a prickle go up the back of his neck.  “I keep thinking it’s going to be today.”
"Father had built a life for himself in Strynn, while Mummy was merely waiting to go back to England.  It was their agreement that they would return when I was three, but as the time got closer and closer Father realized he didn't want to leave.  He was from Norway, while Mummy only had grandparents who were from there, and no close living relatives.  The rest of her family was in England and France, but he'd never felt at home in England.  He had been a scientist of some renown in England, but in a smaller community like Strynn his influence could be felt far more clearly.  Mummy was always more comfortable working behind the scenes."
John shook his head.  "I'm just a locum so it's unpaid anyway, but you're right, I should get on that."
"Oh, right.  Thank you very much."
John heard the bell ring, a short burst of sound, and groaned.  “Client?”
“Your mother said you were finding the fever difficult.”
“You have gone warm all over,” John pointed out.  “Your body temperature rises a little when you’re holding the egg.  It’s hormonal.”
CW for discussion of miscarriage, not related to any specific character.
John curled up with his face to the back of the sofa, the egg tucked into the space between his abdomen, thighs, and the sofa back, and dozed off.
Once he was downstairs he found himself bewildered by Sherlock’s energy and movement about the flat.  It was tidier than it had ever been in his knowledge and yet Sherlock kept finding things to do. John settled himself on the sofa with a cup of tea and accepted the egg, remaining a calm center in Sherlock’s whirlwind.
Sherlock’s hand curved around the egg, nudging John a bit, his smallest finger against the side of John’s hand, just enough of a touch to make sure that John was aware of him, that they were holding the egg together.  Sherlock straightened his legs out slowly, lowering his hips towards the bed. John turned his head, lapped at Sherlock’s hip, urging him closer.  Sherlock kept John’s cock held deep and still as he twisted, weight held on one hand, his left hand still gentle around the egg as he arranged himself, knees on either side of John’s head.
"Yes."  John spoke before he thought, his voice a whisper, hands fumbling on the sleeve of Sherlock's gown, trying to pull it off of him at once.
"How did that come about?"
"I could," Sherlock started, but Anthea interrupted him.
“Alright. John, give me the egg.”
"I thought that was just my good influence paying off," John said.  "Wait, does that mean you're hungry now?"
“Does she need water?” Sherlock asked.
"Of course."  John reached down to touch the egg, glad Sherlock couldn't see the smirk on his face.  If anyone could have used the comfort of placing their cares in the hands of the divine, it would be Mycroft.
"And us being together for over a year without anyone knowing, and hiring a surrogate, that's believable?"  John chewed at the inside of his cheek.
"For a given value of large, yes.  That would be why my shirts aren't fitting lately."  He sighed.  "You haven't noticed, I'm fairly bursting out of them."
“When you dream about the war, you tend to shout names, and you always fall back asleep. You've had dreams that involve other shouting, but you always fall back asleep, or else you do not wake at all. This time you screamed and you lunged for someone with your arms out, and when I said your name you turned towards me, for a moment. Besides, you have faced terrible things. What past or imagined menace could be worse than someone intimate to you betraying you? And have I not betrayed you?”
She stood at the foot of the bed, looking down at them.  “Hello, little one,” she said, resting a knee on the mattress so she could lean closer.  “You can take the rest of the egg away.”
"I'm so sorry."
Sherlock shook his head.  “I won’t be, and if by chance I am, I’ll text you.  Or Mrs. Hudson.”
“Why didn’t you just say?”  John sat down on one side of the sofa, hoping that Sherlock would join him.
“Annborg would know.  I can call her.”  Sherlock had no sooner reached for his phone than the egg shook, the two cracks along the upper part of the egg widening, then joining at the apex as the entire shard was pushed out.  It hung on by a thread of albumin, but the egg was open, the top of the shard easily wider than the two thumb widths that Annborg had warned them about.
"Then the egg goes in here like so," she said, taking it from Mycroft, "and you cross the fabric over again, over the shoulders, across the egg again, around the back, and tie underneath, like this."  When she was done Sherlock looked to be wearing a light green shirt, the egg firmly swaddled against him.  He moved his arms, testing it, bounced on the balls of his feet, his hands linked loosely under the egg, though it was secure.
“Egzanthe Johannah Watson Holmes,” Sherlock said. “It suits her.”  He nuzzled against John’s temple.  “Doesn’t it?”
John relaxed a bit at that.  If Sherlock hadn’t texted to say what his actual ETA was before, it was only that that wasn’t his MO ever, at all, not that it was a new form of incivility.
John leaned his head  against the high back of his desk chair and rubbed at his forehead.  The day had been long enough, but just as they were about to close a frantic mother had called and asked him to re-check a young child with a sore throat. Sarah had prevailed upon him to stay, and he’d agreed.  What he thought was going to be a simple case of reassurance and a feeling of having done well for keeping a child out of A+E turned into a surprise case of epiglottitis and the resulting tense transport to the hospital, all the while trying to convince the child’s mother that yes, this really was necessary.  Then there was the paperwork, and the paperwork he had allowed himself to get behind on over the last few days.  He rubbed the top of his head, trying to stave off the headache, and began.
John raised his eyebrows, having never heard Sherlock speak to, or even of, his mother.  "Really?"
She read it out loud.  “L'on est bien faible quand on est amoureux.”  She laughed.  “One is very weak when one is in love.”  She handed the phone back to him, trying, unsuccessfully, to hide her amusement at his stricken expression.
In the kitchen he sighed with relief again at the sight of the clean table, the tidy room without any evidence of experimentation. The food grinder that Sarah had insisted upon sat on the worktop, awaiting the moment when it would shine, in no less than half a year's time, the bottle warmer next to it. John resolved to put the food grinder away the next day, above the refrigerator, at the very least. He put the kettle on and sat down, but every time he closed his eyes, he could see Sherlock's doppelganger, taunting him in this very room.
John thought for a moment.
"There's nothing difficult about it.  Within a matter of days the egg that has been forming inside my ovipositor for the last two weeks will be complete, a series of hormonal checks and balances will be in place, and I will, through a combination of a generous dose of endogenous muscle relaxants and peristaltic contractions, lay an egg.  I've done it before, though I do have to say that the first episode, while memorable, was probably not entirely representative, given that I was an adolescent and not fully an adult, and the egg, being minus any actual genetic material, was somewhat smaller than this one will be."  He drank again.
John couldn't help smiling and shaking his head fondly, nearly able to hear Sherlock's voice through the texts.
“That’s good,” she said softly.  “I was so parched.”
“For looking at, sorry, what’s she calling herself today, Persephone?  For looking at Persephone’s legs.  You may look John, I know you can hardly help yourself.  But that is all you may do.”  He looked up at John, not really expecting an answer.
“What was I doing in it?”
"You know that experimenting on the baby is more than a bit not good," John said, hoping beyond hope that he didn't really have to explain that.
He turned over to something else, mindless morning chatter, and took out his phone again.
Once she shut the door John sank back down into the same sort of trance he’d been in earlier, the egg, and Sherlock, the only things in his field of view or on his mind.  When the egg rocked, shifting the blankets beneath it, they both gasped, leaning closer, John’s forehead pressed to Sherlock’s temple.
Sherlock shrugged. “You’ve been sleep deprived and you’re going back to bed after a significant shock.  It wouldn’t be all that out of the question for you to sleep past noon.”
Sherlock took his hand as they stepped out the front door.  John quelled the sudden stab of nerves at that, annoyed that he felt it for even a moment.
“Why?”  Sherlock finally turned himself over, never losing contact with the egg.
John followed him, painstakingly taking the stairs one at a time as he held the egg against his stomach.  Sherlock waited for him at the top, then led the way to John's room.  As he stepped over the threshold he realized he hadn't even set foot in the room in days.  Half of his clothes had migrated to Sherlock's room and he did always sleep in there.
While this is marked as the final chapter I've got a couple of epilogues in mind, so this isn't the last we will see of them.  Thanks for reading!
"Now."  Just one word, but his voice broke, making it sound like a question-- making it sound like he was begging.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the living room, his phone in his hand, the egg in a sturdy nest of blankets and throws on the floor.
“In your case, I am sure they’d be preferences.”  Sherlock stood and nudged John towards the stairs, giving him a kiss as they both stood at the bottom.  “I will wake you if you should risk sleeping through my father’s arrival.”
"I gathered."  She looked pointedly around the opulent decor of the dining room, then back at him.
"Not the story I'm here for, is it?"  She sounded happy at the prospect of being told something new, and he wondered if she had any inkling that the word
John lied on his side, propped against Sherlock, who was flat on his back once more, the dressing gown now discarded.  John couldn't stop resting his head against Sherlock's chest, practically nuzzling into his armpit.
John swallowed a mouthful of tea and shook his head, trying to clear out the cobwebs of the dream that still clung there. “I dreamed that I woke up and the bed was empty. The bassinet was gone, the mobile was gone. I came down to the kitchen and you were doing some noxious experiment and you told me that the egg was gone, that it had never even really been here. You said that it had been an illusion.” He looked Sherlock in the face as he finished. “You said it was just a magic trick.”
“Really?” Sherlock stroked the back of John's hand with his thumb.
“It requires a certain technique and a definite texture of fabric, and as of yet I have neither,” Sherlock remarked.  “It will take some time until we’re that at ease with the egg.  Mummy or one of the cousins can show us.”
“I could do with a cuppa, too,” Sherlock said, sitting himself down at the table with the egg against his lap, one of John's jumpers wrapped around it.
John shook his head, but knew that if he tried to convince Sherlock that it would have been Moriarty's fault, not his, it would be a losing battle.  He couldn't match Sherlock's wit and leaps of logic, not tonight.  "But for me, I would have been dead."
"Exactly like Mycroft."  Sherlock shook behind him, and John realized he was laughing.  "It is one of the great amusements of my life that each of them pretends to the other that they don't know what they're really up to."
John looked at the expanse of space that Sherlock's limbs were taking up and had a sudden vision of him as a tiny infant, tiny arms, bones like peppermint sticks.  Everyone started that way, of course, but for the moment the fact that Sherlock had once been an infant seemed very
“It’s barely warmer than human skin, and the light will let us see the shape of the developing foetus.”
John curled up on his side, the egg held between his abdomen and thighs.  The higher body temperature was becoming second nature, and he didn’t even really feel it as he waited for Sherlock.  Sherlock climbed into bed behind him, pulling the duvet over his shoulders but leaving John covered by only his nightshirt.
Sherlock's assessment silenced his laughter, but thrilled him at the same time.
John imagined Sherlock being plied with biscuits and weak tea, surrounded by doilies in some Floridian retirement community home.
“Thanks.” John took the bottle and hurried up the stairs, half worried at what he would find.
“Unless something comes up,” John pointed out, ever the back-up plan.
John took a deep breath and tried to read into Mycroft's speech so far.  Monotremes had electrolocation-- that could be useful for a person in Sherlock's profession, but to a limited extent, and he could see no reason for it to cause him GI distress.  He waited for Mycroft to continue.
“Yes.” Relief, like air after a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding, washed over him.
"You want the baby to be able to choose for himself when he grows up," John said, astonished that Sherlock would be that progressive.
“I want that very much.  I’m merely acknowledging the suddenness of our arrangement and my own idiosyncrasies that might cause you to want a room of your own.”  He shifted, and John thought of the sharpness of his hipbones, the utter lack of fat on them, and wondered if he should warn Sherlock to turn himself every so often.
"That was going to be my next question," John said.  "How can you be sure that the baby will resemble you?"
“I do.”
"Obvious," Sherlock muttered, his face barely turned.
“Within the next two years we will likely have to move, unless we can negotiate an expansion.  We both need our space, but Mrs. Turner’s married ones don’t look like shifting anytime soon.”
Sherlock frowned.  “You may be right.  We’ll consult the doctor when she arrives.”  His expression softened when he looked at John.  “But of course, the opinion of my doctor will trump hers.”
“This can be a good compromise if you want the baby to be in your bed some evening,” she said.  John took it in his hand and examined it, found it to be of sound design.
"Empiricism, then."
“Is that normal?” Sherlock asked,
“I am,” John said.  “I’m not scheduled to work tomorrow but Sarah asked me to keep myself available.”
“Let me,” John said, afraid his senses were deceiving him. He held his hand steady with his forearm against the table and there was no mistaking the movement of the egg, the little shudder that completely coincided with the beat of a foetal heart.
Mycroft curled his lip.  "Really.  Yes, we can stop on the way back."  He tapped on the partition.
Sherlock leaned back so he could look at John properly.  “You looked up the meaning of my name.”
“I told you, John, case.”
“Going to be difficult, considering at least one of her feet is up here,” Sherlock said, reaching just into the open part of the egg to touch her foot, resting sole up against her shoulder.
"Yes, exactly."
“A wonder you never tried it.”
“Lovely,” she said, as she walked away.  In any other person John would have taken the tone to mean she’d ignored everything Sherlock had said, but he knew that she’d not only heard, but transmitted the minutiae to Mycroft before she’d even turned around.
Sherlock pulled away from him, and John gritted his teeth as he struggled not to surge after him.
He glanced back at his phone as it buzzed again.
“I think so.” John kissed his forehead as he stood up, tucking a blanket closer around the egg as he walked away.
“We will call for you if we aren’t sure,” Sherlock said, reaching out to touch his phone where he’d left it on the bedside table.
“You know, it’s kind of funny, this,” John said.  “You treating me as if I’m an expectant mother who needs coddling.”
“You don’t know the manner in which I entered the river,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock shifted behind him, so his chin was barely brushing the top of John's shoulder.
"Sherlock, and Mummy before him, are part of a rare sub-class of humans who lay eggs.  The cycle is one egg every seven years.  There is no guarantee that the child of an ovipositor will be an ovipositor.  Broadly, it appears to be a Mendelian recessive trait.  Sherlock is an ovipositor, I am not.  His sudden 'illness' this morning was not unexpected.  He was due for a cycle, and his current state is analogous to the stomach upset that pregnant women who are nearly to term sometimes experience.  Broadly, it's a clearing of the system, making way for the egg."
John was only surprised at his lack of surprise. "She's aware?"
He helped her to her flat, covered her with a light blanket when she laid herself down on her bed.  He made sure that she had a beaker of water and her phone near her before he left, promising to check on her in an hour if they’d not heard from her.
“Whereas Egzanthe is a bit clever.”
Sherlock watched him.  "I'm tired of this sofa.  We should go lie down on my bed."
Mrs. Hudson finished the rest of the drink.  “I still feel so tired,” she said.  “I think I need a bit of a lie down.”
“I’m alright,” he said, leaning on Sherlock as the other man tried to turn towards him.  “I’m alright.  Just watch the egg.”
Sherlock's face was flushed, his eyes as bright as if he had a fever, the bright gray of his iris now a thin ring around his pupil.  He pushed back against each of John's thrusts, his hands moving about restlessly, trying to hold himself open, trying to let John get deeper.
"Am I hurting you?"
"The flyer in the center showcases some of our gluten free options," he said.
“No,” Sherlock admitted, his hand gentle but firm on John’s lower back.  “I have no way of knowing that.”
He checked on Sherlock, still curled around the egg in John’s bed, reading something on his phone.
"Go to work."  He gave John a gentle kiss, holding him at arm's length due to the egg.  "Go."
"She can hear us?" John knew that gestating babies could hear their parents of course, but the shell seemed so impermeable compared to flesh.
John reached out, laid his palm flat over the swell of Sherlock's abdomen, just below his sternum, and pressed.  There was a sense of more bulk beneath his hand than there would be in another very slender patient.  He shifted the pressure to his middle three fingertips, palpating.  A sense of fullness, no fluid entrapment, no distinct edges of organs. The sides of Sherlock's abdomen were softer.  He pressed down firmly just beneath his xyphoid process, and frowned.
"Have you been eating enough?" he asked.
"Oh, no, I hadn't thought of it," she said.
"Thank you."  He leaned forward and kissed her cheek, bending at the waist.  John wondered again how tall his father was.   She let her hand linger on his cheek as he stood.  "My beautiful boys," she said, softly, turning to look at Mycroft.  John looked at him too-- he was quiet, still dressed as he'd always seen him, to the nines, and wearing an expression that on anyone else would be termed a sulk, but on Mycroft was likely just deep thought.  Sherlock wandered towards the kitchen table, engrossed in looking at and touching the egg.  Mycroft stood and offered his mother his arm.  She accepted, laughing softly even as she swatted at him, and he looked appeased.
His brain felt split in three-- his cock in Sherlock’s mouth, the egg cradled between them, Sherlock’s cock in his mouth.  It kept him on the edge for what felt like ages, the pressure against his own cock mirrored in the pressure on his throat.  Once comfortably settled there Sherlock hardly moved, shifting his hips inch by inch, John’s head pressing into the pillow a counterpoint.  John felt the saliva running down his chin, warm but quickly cooling, didn’t care, really, didn’t have a free hand to wipe it away.
“The effects of being home with the egg,” Sherlock said.
“Mother’s name goes second,” Sherlock said.  “As I contributed the egg, that would make me her mother, biologically. Besides, I like the descending number of syllables in the names.”
John hitched himself forward on his elbows and hovered over Sherlock's face for a moment, looking into his eyes, trying to discern if Sherlock wanted him to move.  Those long fingers carding through his hair, again, urged him forward, and John let his lips brush against Sherlock's.
"I guess I can understand that."
“About eighteen days, give or take a few,” Sherlock said. “I was apparently quite reluctant to come out of my egg. There is some variation.”
“I know.  It had to be said.”  She turned back to the food.  “You could set the table, you know.”
John nodded. “You know, I'm sure this kind of dream isn't unusual amongst prospective parents.”
John finished his tea, feeling like he'd had a double shot of espresso, couldn't stop himself checking and double checking his wallet, his keys, everything about the flat that he wanted left just so, considering that Sherlock was going to be spending the day inside.  There was a pitcher of water on the coffee table (despite Sherlock's protestation that he was perfectly capable of walking into the kitchen, and in fact doing so would be medically preferable to staying in one position on the sofa) and a plate of sandwiches, courtesy of Mrs. Hudson, in the refrigerator.
"I know, I know."  John felt like spinning around in the center of the room, barely restrained himself.  "Why do I feel like this?"
"All of it.  I only remember a haze of pain.  Mummy reassures me that minus the rigors of detoxification and with significantly better health in general, now, it won't be a repeat of that nightmare."
Sherlock looked at him, eyebrows raised.  “Didn’t we just discuss this two hours ago?”
"Then you might have noticed that all parents perform those experiments.  It's called parenting."
“I didn't think there was an option,” John said.
"I think you can," Mycroft said quietly.  "You've felt this way about him for a long while.  Is it not gratifying to discover that your regard is returned?"
Sherlock shrugged.  “No one out there knows that.”
"Hmmmm."  Sherlock was nearly purring.  John wasn't sure he'd ever heard him so amused.  "Is it a bluff, though?"
“I thought you said you could tie the egg to yourself,” John said, finally pulling his jacket on.
“Should we,” John asked, glancing at Sherlock.
“Could you not have told me that we were expecting company?” John asked.
“It was somewhat cowardly of me to leave that up to him,” Sherlock said as they approached the main tower.  “I could have told you, or tried to tell you.”
"You're only going to be gone for just over six hours," Sherlock pointed out.  "Less if you're late, so you should leave within the next two minutes."
“Not these, particularly,” Sherlock said.  “When Moriarty feigned to steal them, it was actually a set of replicas.  These are the real items.”
"I've got coeliac," she said, not looking up.
Sarah smiled at John as he passed her in the hall.  “Not long now, is it?” Sarah asked him.
John looked at his tense, peevish expression for a moment, then laughed out loud.  "You know what's going to happen, in a matter of weeks?"
“You were gone for twelve hours!”
"You need one of those," she said, suddenly authoritative.  "All my friends who have babies swear by them.  Alright, you need a boppy.  What about nappies, are you doing cloth ones?"
“She’s getting warmer,” Anborg said.  “About halfway through.  But you knew that already.”
John closed his eyes and shook his head.  "That's not really the usual response to that."
“That’s the theory, anyway,” Ann said as she put the doppler away.  “Shall we candle the egg now?”
“Should we remove the rest of the egg?” John asked.  “Does she need to kick it free herself?”
“No, not really,” John agreed.  Inside the tower it was cool and dim, only the barest lights on and the light through the narrow windows.  Without the press of bodies the air was still, nearly moist, like a deep cellar.  They walked to the room with the crown jewels, passing a security guard who did not so much as nod at them.
“You really can’t tell with an egg, can you,” she mused.  “Still, it just feels precious, doesn’t it?  I feel like I’ve gone all over warm and doting on it.”
Mycroft stood up as she left, then glared at Sherlock and John.
“Is it always evening?” John’s voice felt rough, as if from disuse.
Sherlock didn't move, didn't open his eyes.  "I'm awake."
"Were you really expecting the usual response?"  Sherlock shifted, twisting so the firm bump of his abdomen nudged John in the nose, a reminder of how decidedly not normal this all was.
“All good, I hope,” John said, resisting the urge to kick himself after that idiotic reply came out of his mouth.
"So, quite large then," John said, coming back to himself.
“We’ll have to decide on an aesthetic then, as I begin to acquire some.  I don’t have a stockpile anywhere, after all. What you see is what you get.”  He walked into the living room, surprised when
John looked down at his phone, typed a message.
"I liked seeing my father, and all my cousins.  Speaking Norwegian was an interesting challenge, and many of the cousins spoke English and another language besides, so we had plenty of opportunities to practice.  Father is also conversational in Kven, though I've never found out why."  He sounded peevish.
"Fine.  Yes, I swear."
"Did he want Irn Bru last time?"
"Is it enough?"
“A bit.  Thinking about visiting Norway, some day.”
She nodded.  “He’s finding the higher temperature difficult to adjust to, especially as it comes with a faster metabolism.  He didn’t have much extra energy saved to begin with.”  She took the bottle of lemonade out of the refrigerator and handed it to John.  “That’s going down a treat with him.  Bring it up to him.  I’ll call you when dinner is ready.”
"No, it's perfectly natural.  Happens sometimes."  They'd made it to the door of the washroom.  "Please go, John.  This may take a long while and I don't wish to be humiliated."
The waiter reappeared and took their orders, gliding away in near silence.
“He chose well, I thought,” John said, conversationally.
Sherlock’s mouth was swollen, wet, his lips parted as he took in deep slow breaths, measured as if he’d just come back from a run.  The red of his lips and the pink irritation on his chin were in marked contrast to the rest of him, pale except for the flush that still covered his throat to his clavicle.  His cock was still wet, too, soft but still red, lying wetly against one thigh.
“Seems to be,” Zilpha said, as Annborg nodded.  “I’m sure there’s the odd child that comes in the morning, but the eggs always seem to hatch after the sun has set.”
“So, to my point. What did I do.”
“I’m sorry John.”  When she spoke her voice was dry, parched, even though the pitcher of water was empty.  “I hope I’m not hurting her.”  She nudged the egg towards him, and, realizing that it was the source of her fever, John picked it up immediately.
"Wouldn't dream of it," she said.
John looked at the egg.  "Won't he or she qualify?  I mean, technically."
“Thank you.”
When John got downstairs he was surprised to see that Sherlock had his shirt off again, standing in the middle of the living room with the egg now being held loosely by Mycroft, who sat on the sofa.  Zilpha was winding a broad strip of fabric around Sherlock's shoulders, across his back in a tidy X, making a pouch of it just against his stomach.
"How do you want to be?"
"Fuck, can you feel that?"  He grasped Sherlock's hips.
"You're an atheist," John pointed out.
“Mycroft sent it.  It has the entire Britannica on it.”  Sherlock actually looked happy, and John brushed a hand along the side of his face, lingering over his cheekbone.  It had been a while since Sherlock had looked truly happy, the stress of being primarily responsible for the egg weighing on him.  John resolved in that moment to make more of an effort to take that burden off of him.
was the first text.  The names suggested got more and more outlandish-- or John hoped they were outlandish, Sherlock did come from a family positively given to making up names, it seemed-- until finally there was a pause in the stream, as if Sherlock had become tired of pestering him, and a final message.
"You're trying to remember if I have ever lied to you, and coming to the conclusion that I have not, though there are times that you wish I had been more forthcoming.  On the other hand, I know for a fact that you have never lied to me.  You have never lied, that I know of, and now I need to ask you for your word.  I need to require that you swear never to reveal what I am about to tell you to anyone other than Sherlock or myself."
"Yes.  And you are going to do things that you weren't planning on doing.  You'll sing.  You're going to jiggle keys.  You're going to beg an entirely nonverbal being to reason with you."  He laughed again at Sherlock's incredulous expression.
“You left on a hunch?” Sherlock asked softly.
"As I said, once a baby is involved, people tend to believe anything.  We should say that I was the sperm donor, as well."
John leaned his head against the back of the seat.  "It's not obvious to me, however much you think it should be."  They were driving through Southwark, and he wondered if the driver had any destination at all in mind.
“Why don’t you already have one?” John sat down on the side of the bed, his hand reaching out towards the egg before he’d even thought of it.
“Reasonable,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock's eyes closed, fingers of one hand scrambling at the sheets while he reached for himself with the other.
John's head swam, flashing back to a moment in Buckingham Palace.
“You could have died,” John pointed out.
"It's not that strange, John, all children at that age wish to be helpful to their parents, and I was no exception, despite my significantly higher than average intellect.  It is nearly universal that children hatched from eggs have an advanced brain development, most likely due to the richness of the yolk that they feed from during their gestation."
“Let me get you some more of that,” John said.  When he went back to the kitchen he looked over at Sherlock pointedly, trying to ask silently if the egg was really alright.  Sherlock nodded once, calm, but somehow not entirely reassuring.
"Sherlock, no, we do, we really really do," John said, clinging to sanity the best he could.
Sherlock wandered back into the kitchen.  “Charmingly disheveled naturalist,” he said. “Feel free to add any of your own things, as you see fit.”
John summoned all of his wherewithal to answer.
Sherlock shrugged.  "No more so than any other human.  My scent is merely the byproduct of diet and hygiene."
Sarah looked shocked again.  "That would mean that you've got a baby coming in just, what, a month?"
"Oh, of course, silly me.  Now, what was the mnemonic for remembering the position of the ovipositor relative to the peritoneal cavities?  I must have learned it in medical school.  Oh wait, no, I didn't."
"Don't need it," Sherlock said, pushing his bottom against John's cock.
"What do you think, John, does it satisfy you?"
Once he was sure John was still, Sherlock climbed up onto the sofa, a foot to either side of John's stretched out legs, perching lightly on him.
The answer was nearly immediate.
"The baby will have half of my genetic material, it will of course resemble me in some way.  It will also resemble you, but that will take less explanation, or none at all, as your features are ordinary."
“She will be a little later at holding her head up and sitting up, because she didn’t have the isotonic pressure of amniotic fluid, but otherwise her development will be indistinguishable from a gestational infant’s.”  She took her stethoscope out of the pocket of her sweatshirt, and John carefully transferred the baby to Sherlock, noting how effortlessly he seemed to take her, resting the back of her head on his forearm.
“Will you take the egg while I get dressed?” Sherlock asked, unwinding the sheet.
John turned to look at him for the first time since he'd woken up. “Might as well get some sleep in, more like,” he said. “I'll be back shortly.” He studied Sherlock's face, the new softness to his cheekbones, the subtle sheet wrinkles around his temple where he'd been lying. This face had nothing in common with the man who had jeered at him in the nightmare. He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock's forehead, breathing in the scent of him, bringing himself back to the real world again.
“Certainly, but I’ve never considered it my job to keep another person happy.”  Sherlock’s voice was strong to the end but then faltered and John bit back the knowing smile he nearly gave him.
"You can feel it, if you like."
John thought she was giving him a piece of advice, until he realized she was translating.
“They do love each other,” Sherlock said, once they were in the kitchen.  “In their own way, their love story might be one for the ages.”
"Give me your hand," John demanded, tapping Sherlock on his hip.  Sherlock reached back, only to have John turn his hand so he was grasping his own arse.  "Open yourself up for me.”
In response, Sherlock rolled onto his stomach, arms folded under his head, then lifted his ass in the air.
John thought again of the amount of time he'd spent at work, covering shifts all over London and the surrounding areas, and realized that he really hadn't fully grasped the fact that there would be a baby in the flat, in his life, in just a matter of weeks.
He had a sudden clear vision of what Sherlock must look like, stretched out on the sofa, pale, grimacing at the ORS.
John struggled for a moment to make sense of his train of thought, then followed Sherlock’s gaze over Tower Bridge, watching as one of the morning buses made its way towards the city.
"When will we know if it's viable?" John asked, smoothing his hand over its narrower end.  It wasn't as tapered as a hen egg, but there was a visible difference.
"No, at this time the yolk is formed.  The egg is nearly as full of material as it ever will be, though it will begin changing as soon as it is fertilized."
“I thought it might be about time,” Mycroft said, holding up the bottle he was carrying.
"He did." Sherlock tapped at the screen.
Ann was opening the case that John had carried up the steps-- inside was a simple light box, with a surrounding plexiglass frame.
"Perfectly normal, John," Sherlock said.  "For me, anyway."  He sighed deeply, a content sound, as John, unable to help himself, let his fingers slip inside again.  "More please."
"A myth.  Our baby has been listening to Chopin and Mendelssohn.  And us, of course."
Once home Sherlock was already dressed to leave, the only thing out of place his open shirt front, the egg against his skin.
“I can only surmise regarding your childhood. I can not deduce it, but I can make an educated guess. Children are too plastic to allow for the adult to be a sure signpost to their upbringing, but your sister's alcoholism and your devotion to the military are almost enough.”
"Yes," John hissed, feeling the heat gathering at the base of his spine, spreading and gathering, tightening up his sac.  "Wank yourself."  His thighs burned with the effort of staying crouched, back aching as he wound up curved over Sherlock's body.  The bed shook and bounced alarmingly with every thrust, and he barely noticed.
his phone.
“What?” John asked the phone aloud.  Sherlock knew he couldn’t read French, though he knew enough to know that the message contained the words love, and dangerous, and without.
"How have you kept this a secret, all this time?" she asked.
"I see you've had something of an epiphany."
“Really.  Only a fool doesn’t listen to his doctor.”
“Annborg,” she said, offering him her hand.  “You can call me Ann.”  She had a bag over her shoulder as well as her leather doctor’s satchel, and what looked like a heavy case.  John lifted it for her as he held the door open, surprised to find that it was lighter than it looked.
"So, it's all just to do with chemicals, then?"  John thought of Sherlock's text to him when he was in the car.
“How are you feeling?” John asked.  Sherlock looked pekkid, a bit drawn, though that could have been the effects of the generation of the egg itself, still making themselves known.
“Mrs. Hudson, can you hear me,” John asked.  She had gone glassy eyed, but her breathing was even.
“I won’t be giving up any of my habits,” Sherlock said, slightly snippy.
“Supper went well,” John said.  “Your mother seemed to like me.”
"You are not a gifted liar.  The story that we have a surrogate is going to be all that you can hold up.  When she asks if you have various baby things laid in, you're going to be hopeless at saying that you do."
John opened the top drawer that had until recently held his socks and pants.  In their place was pile after pile of tiny folded babygros, all white.  He held one up, unfolding it, still shocked at how small it was.  The tag at the neck said 0-3 mos, not a preemie outfit, but for a normal newborn baby.  Despite the fact that he held the egg every day he was still having a hard time believing that the baby that would emerge would be so small.
"I know."  Sherlock seemed content to lapse into silence.
“What shall we name you?” Sherlock asked, his voice soft.  The baby had closed her eyes again, barely stirring as he spoke.
“No you didn’t,” John said, soft and fond.  She took that moment to open her eyes, her arms flailing above her head, stretching out, toes pointed towards John, brushing against his jumper.  Her stretch was over quickly, limbs lax as she blinked, eyes closing again in an instant.
John texted back.
"No, I'm not going anywhere with you in this state.  What's wrong?"
"He told me something interesting," John said.
Sherlock sighed and came closer, but still was obscured, partially, by the thickening smoke.
"Yes, I know.  Consider, John, what's going to happen to me very shortly.  Please, do as I ask."
There was a scraping of the chair on the floor, and then Sherlock was standing in the doorway, stretching his back with his hands on his hips, as if he were actually a pregnant woman.
"There wasn't much chance of me cooking at Baker Street," John allowed, thinking of the state of the kitchen back then.
“Of course.” Sigeursonn handed the egg back to John and followed Sherlock into the kitchen. “I brought you nothing, as Anborg already brought all your infant things and I didn't bring your childhood clothes. It would have been interesting for John, but who knows where you'll be living by the time your child needs those things.”
"We shall disagree, then.  Now, as for the books, the neonate will be completely unable to appreciate them for some time.  Klekket barn are exceptional, but not to the point of needing books."
“May I hold my grandchild?” He held his hands out for the egg.
"None.  Some distant cousins, in America, but we never speak to them, just the odd Christmas card."  It made life simpler, usually, if lonelier at times.
“Can you manage the stairs?” John asked.
"How big is it?  I mean, when it's... done."
Sherlock glanced at the clock. “Well, it's past midnight so any time, technically. Though I did check the most likely flights. Knowing his preferences and habits I'd say he'll arrive at Gatwick around noon and be here no later than half one.”
“Well, aren’t you?” Sherlock asked.  He barely turned towards John, twirling a feather duster over the rows of books on the high shelves before turning to the mirror over the mantle.
'Happens sometimes, what do you mean?"  John had never known him to have any kind of irritable bowel issue.
"It does."
When he woke the thin light of dawn was filling the flat and his bladder was screaming at him.  He set the egg down and pulled his jumper over it, and went to the loo, looking around for any sign that Sherlock had come home and simply not disturbed him.  It was unlikely-- for one thing Sherlock tended to bound into the house after a case, and for another there was no blanket thrown over John and his shoes were still on.  Those rudimentary courtesies were things that were not beyond even Sherlock Holmes.
"Did you eat something?  Take something?"  The suddenness with which it had come on made bacterial or viral illness less likely than some kind of poisoning, food or otherwise.
"Really?"
“She won’t go home until well after the child has been hatched.  It will take some time to falsify her records, and it would be easiest to explain if we wait until she’s attained a birth weight more common to a gestated infant.”
“I suspect she will wake often to eat a tiny amount, and then sleep,” Sherlock said. “Luckily I’ve been training my whole life to tolerate broken and irregular sleep.”
"You need reservations there, even for lunch," she protested.
“I’m listening.”  John forced himself to look at her.
"I'm sorry," John said, thinking of the obvious regard, if not outright affection, both of the Holmes boys had for their mother.
"Come here then."  Sherlock was lying on his side, all the way to the far edge of the bed, his arms outstretched.  John carefully laid himself down facing Sherlock, inching closer until his abdomen bumped into the egg, Sherlock pulling him just a bit closer as he wrapped his arms around John, clasped behind his back.
"He'll be delighted, I'm sure."  Sherlock lifted up the blankets with one arm, inviting John in.
"I will do none of those things."
"I was nearly sure," Sherlock said, softly.  "I was sure.  I am sure."  He let go of John's hand, only to curve his hand around the back of John's head, pulling him closer until John's face was leaning against the side of Sherlock's belly, the egg a firm curve under his cheek.  "I am sure that you love me."
“Of course.” John stood as he handed it over, expecting the other man to take it and sit down, but Sigeursonn stood holding it, turning it over in his hands several times, running his hand over the shell before he held it against the front of his shirt. “Not long now,” he said, his voice warm, pleased. “I never had the chance to raise a girl myself, but I have known many of Sherlock's cousins. Anborg was an infant when I moved to Norway. It's a pleasure watching them grow and acquire new skills and sharpen their senses. Girls are subtly different from boy children. It was fascinating because Zilpha insisted that there was no difference but there clearly is.”
"In the future,” Sherlock said,  “I plan to take my time, and plenty of it, cataloging our respective responses to a variety of stimuli, but today I find that I can't wait.  Please."
They pulled away from each other slowly, Sherlock rolling away to stand at the edge of the bed, one hand still lightly on the egg, as if John might let go and let it roll off his stomach.
“I like it too.”
“I remember,” Sherlock said, taking it in his hands.  “I loved this.  I think Siguersonn’s aunt made it.”
John grasped Sherlock’s cock with his free hand, angled it towards his lips, licking at the already moist glans, Sherlock’s scent strong in his mouth as he drew him in, familiar weight on his tongue, throat loosening in an almost Pavlovian reaction.  Sherlock’s smallest finger brushed against the back of John’s hand, a message, even if he wasn’t sure what it was.   Then Sherlock lowered his hips, nearly lying across John’s face, his cock slipping in deep.  John breathed in slowly through his nose, ran his thumb lightly against Sherlock’s hand--
“Our crib,” Sherlock said as they entered the bedroom.  “She’ll sleep in here for the first year, then move to the nursery.”
"There will be movers.  You'll have to move to my room with the egg."
“Here, we’ll let this warm up.”  She set it on the coffee table, then crouched down next to the sofa, looking for the outlet.  John realized too late that he should have been helping her look, but he couldn’t seem to leave Sherlock’s side.
Once inside Anborg unpacked a more impressive set of instruments than John had previously seen from her.  He refrained from asking if those were for his benefit and simply watched as she used a proximity thermometer to measure the temperature of the egg.
"Feel for yourself."
“The doctor from Strynn, arrived in London this afternoon, probably went to her hotel to freshen up before continuing to Baker Street.”
“Are you ready for our date?”  Sherlock had also done something to tame his hair, but he still looked more disheveled and younger than usual.
“I think her temperature has gone up, quite high,” John said, handing the egg to Sherlock, who already had his hands outstretched.  Out of the corner of his eye John could see Sherlock sitting down in the basket chair, running his hands over the shell.  He held the egg up to his shirtfront, not against his skin-- it must have felt slightly warm to him, too.
“You’ve gained some weight,” Sigeursonn said.  “It makes you look younger.”
John fixed tea for the both of them with a setting for Annborg as well, and they sat in companionable silence as they drank.
“Well, you know him. Typical of him just to show up.”
Sherlock took a sudden tiny step forward, hand grasping hard at the stonework.   His face was smooth, but John knew him well enough to know that he’d nearly swooned.
“Hello darling. We love you so much.”  He couldn’t stop himself from constantly assessing the color in her cheeks, the rate and depth of her breath, and the way her eyes seemed to lock onto his own, holding his gaze for a few seconds at a time. When Sherlock leaned over his shoulder she looked at him, then yawned hugely, her eyes rolling before her lids fluttered shut.
“John! John!” The voice was Sherlock's, really, truly Sherlock's, and John wondered for a moment how he could have thought the apparition in his dream sounded anything like the man keeping him from flying off the edge of the bed. “John, you're having a nightmare.”
“My hope that you will like him is directly related to the fact that he is very much like me.”
He pressed the back of his hand to her forehead.  “Apparently just enough.”
John clumsily texted back.
“It does not matter what the condition of the child is inside the shell, as we can neither fix anything that may be wrong nor halt the development of the foetus at this point.”
