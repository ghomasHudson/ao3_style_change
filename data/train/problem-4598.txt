There was another round of hugs, and Eileen telling Dean he’d better call them this time if he needs them, before Sam and Eileen were hoisting their bags onto their shoulders and heading up the stairs. The door clanged shut behind them and Dean was left with the book and the glowing blue stone.
Years passed, gray accumulating in Dean’s hair. He didn’t move as quickly as he used to but it was all right. Sam and Eileen gained gray right along with him as their twins ran them ragged. As they grew, both were told about the life. When they turned eighteen, both were given the choice to become hunters or not. Connor decided not to become a hunter. Instead, he went to college and became a writer. Nothing like Chuck, writing his own versions of people’s lives and controlling their fates. Just fun little stories that entertained. Elizabeth enthusiastically threw herself into hunting, also going to school for paramedic training.
After finishing his prayer, Dean sat back, eyes still closed. Part of him was terrified Cas wouldn’t show up. Maybe he’d misunderstood what Bobby meant? What if Cas was still stuck in the Empty and all Dean had done was twist the knife that much deeper? Or what if Cas didn’t want to talk to him? He’d admitted his love but what if he’d decided that that was enough? What if he’d changed his mind?
"I'm so proud of you, Sammy. My baby brother," Dean smiled, holding his head up to meet Sam's eyes even as the effort grew more taxing with each passing second. "I love you, so much. You promise me, promise me you'll live."
"You're the Empty," Dean said but there was just enough of a lift at the end of the words that made it a small question. NotCas nodded.
Dean chuckled, poured a generous dollop of lube into his hand, and slid back so he was sitting on Cas’s thighs. He smeared the lube over his palm, using his body heat to warm it. Then, he wrapped his fingers around the base of Cas’s erection. Slowly, he worked his hand up, making a twisting gesture every inch or so to make sure the lube was spreading. He watched Cas’s face as he did so, drinking in every quiet groan and facial expression. When Dean reached the head, he rolled his palm over it and slid his hand back down Cas’s shaft. At the base, Dean rested his hand in a loose circle around Cas’s erection and just stared for a moment. He could have this now, could have Cas. Could touch and kiss and feel and
Oh shit. Dean froze as he reviewed his last couple thoughts. Yep, he’d thought what he’d thought he had. He was in love with Cas. For the second time, Dean groaned. This was exactly what he needed. Wanting Cas, being attracted to him, okay he could deal with that. Keep it all to himself and keep working. But love? Love was harder and Dean was selfish when it came to the people he loved. When he loved, he made sure the people he loved knew. But now, he couldn’t.
Dean couldn’t imagine a better ending.
"Hell, Cas, this isn't easy for me," Dean said, panic spiking as Cas moved away. He moved a few steps closer, hand rubbing the back of his neck again. "I know I'm not obligated, to use your words, but I have things to say too. Everything happened so fast and, fuck it, I thought angels couldn't even feel emotions like humans. Love, in general terms, yeah. But being
“Yes?” Cas asked guardedly, tilting his head to the side as he studied Dean out of the corner of his eye.
The drive back to the bunker was quiet. Sam and Eileen slept, slumped against each other in the backseat. The other hunters peeled away, heading back to their own homes. About halfway back, Sam and Eileen firmly asleep, Cas turned to Dean and pinned him with a mock stern look.
He hadn’t gone to sleep without alcohol since.
"Forever," Dean repeated, the word feeling like a benediction in his mouth. He captured Cas's mouth again in a deeper kiss, smiling the whole time.

Then Sam yelped and grabbed for his tray as Dean surged up, his tray held securely in his hands. Nearly running, Dean headed to the truck where the pies were sold, grabbed three boxes, and headed back to the bench. He all but threw two of them at Sam and started packing away his pie slices.
Dean didn’t jump, hearing the familiar voice speak those familiar words. Instead, he opened his eyes, turned to the person sitting in the passenger seat of the Impala, and smiled. The final weight in his chest fell away in a burst of absolute love as Cas smiled back with that tender, soft expression Dean had memorized.
. On a sigh, Cas’s lips opened beneath his and Dean slowly licked his way into Cas’s mouth. The kiss was warm and comfortable and thrilling, everything he’d imagined in the depths of the night when he couldn’t get Cas out of his head. When his want and need were all but prayers screaming in his head.
The hunt, while daunting, was familiar. There were about thirty vamps and they’d managed to bring together twenty hunters. While they were slightly outnumbered, it should be enough. They’d all gotten practice fighting vamps, knew the drill. Besides, Sam and Eileen had managed to gather a decent store of dead man’s blood. Every single hunter would be going in with their machete coated in it. Their bullets had all already been treated with it. It should be enough to slow a vamp down enough to behead it.
~*~*~*~
"Dean, Dean, Dean," came from behind him in Cas's voice. But that mocking derision and accent was nothing like Cas's. "Will wonders never cease. I'm being visited by Dean Winchester. How did a human get in here?
Then he felt the tugging around his middle. He held tight to Cas as the spell pulled both of them through the rip. They steadied each other as the rip closed. Then, they were standing together in the storage room, Dean’s arm around Cas’s waist and Cas’s arm around his shoulders. The last time they’d been here, Cas had confessed his love to Dean and been taken by the Empty. Dean caught his breath at the memory.
“So get to it,” Dean ordered, nodding decisively. “Kill the monsters.”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean murmured, his eyes never leaving Cas’s. “I am in love with you and I have been for years.”
Some time later, Dean couldn’t say how long as there was no way to tell time here, the small hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stood up. He rubbed his neck, surreptitiously glancing around. The rustlings came and went but, so far, nothing had approached him. Still, that sensation on his neck and a cold chill in his belly told him he was being watched. Maybe one of the angels or demons who resided here or even the Empty itself. He walked a little faster, still praying desperately. He hadn’t come across anything or anyone here but he couldn’t give up on Cas. He had to find him.
"Under
He didn't feel it at first. Thanks to the adrenaline from the fight, the aches from already having been thrown around, and the sheer relief as Sam beheaded the vamp, Dean had no idea anything was wrong.
Dragging Cas’s head down, Dean kissed him and poured all of that into the kiss. He could feel Cas start to tremble and grinned into the kiss. Several long seconds later, Dean leaned back and just looked into Cas’s eyes. They shared the moment, Dean no longer feeling uncomfortable that Cas seemed to be staring into every fiber of his being. It was safe and familiar.
“Now we wait,” Sam signed back before taking her hand again. He needed the comfort and the support and had a feeling she did too.
“You’re the Empty,” Dean said as his eyes widened. “I thought you were all... black goo and shit?”
. Maybe the fact that it wasn’t comfortable meant he was the best suited for it.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam’s voice came from the phone as Dean switched it to speakerphone. “How did it go? Did you get him back?”
Timeless moments passed as they kissed. It was unhurried, warm, and full of all the words that had been unspoken between them for too long. The most important ones, though, had finally made their way past barriers caused by fear. That was enough for now. It was a good foundation to build on. They broke the kiss to lean their foreheads together, their breaths mingling in the shared space between them.
"Thank you, Cas," Sam said, putting a hand on Cas's shoulder and squeezing. He nodded once when Cas looked up at him. "I'm really glad you're okay and that you healed Dean."
“If it was you, I wouldn't hesitate to go after you,” Eileen said, looking up at Sam. Sam sighed and smiled at her softly before looking at Dean.
“Do you want to explain or shall I?” Meg asked, taking another sip of wine. Her eyes were darkly gleeful.
The kiss was unhurried and soft. It was love and affection and
His eyes almost blurred as he read through the lines, heart in his throat. When he got to the end, a sharp stab of disappointment knifed its way through his chest. It was nothing more than a poem. It had an odd staccato beat to it and it made him feel uncomfortable in ways he couldn’t describe. Maybe lethargic but with undercurrents of wrongness? He wasn’t sure but he was sure that it was nothing more than useless words. Underneath, the author mentioned that he’d heard a story from an older member of the Men of Letters that linked the poem with the void. In the author’s opinion, the only thing that linked the two were mentions of emptiness but he included it just to be thorough.
“I can’t believe he came through,” Eileen said disbelievingly.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said. Taking his hands off the wheel, Dean turned his whole body to face Cas. Then he just looked, taking in everything he could of Cas’s face and how he seemed. “How you doing?”
Here, Dean paused his prayer and swallowed hard. Even now, it was so hard to just speak what was in his heart. All his life, he’d been taught to bury everything but the anger, the righteous anger at things that went bump in the night. All his life, he’d swallowed every emotion but that anger, feeling them burn in his chest as he did. But he had to say it. This was Heaven. No more fighting what he felt. And this was Cas.
quiet leaving. I won't be so generous should I wake again."
Kansas on the radio, a perfect fall day, and a stretch of open road with nothing in his way. Dean took off down the road, bobbing his head to
“Are you sure you want to be bound to me?” he asked quietly, looking down. Not wanting to see Cas’s face. Not wanting to see it if Cas changed his mind. “It sounds pretty permanent.”
“You’re welcome,” Cas replied against his lips, his own curving into a smile.
maybe, though Dean was more partial to Zeppelin.
There was absolute peace on his face. His lips were quirked in a small smile at the corners and his blue eyes were relaxed. They held such affection as they looked back at Dean, affection that had always been there but Dean hadn’t allowed himself to really see. Now he did and he was kicking himself that it had taken both of them dying, again, for him to allow himself to see. To want with the hope of reciprocating.
Slamming closed his notebook, Dean left it sitting on the table and stalked back to his room. It didn’t matter that it was early. It didn’t matter that he’d only just woken up a few hours ago. He was going to lose himself in the bottle on his nightstand. Maybe not come out for days.
A thought struck him at the same time Sam’s phone buzzed. Dean trailed off, his mind suddenly whirling at a mile a minute. Even if he had found a way to get to Cas, found a way to get him out, he had no way of dealing with the Empty. And he didn’t believe he would be able to get into the place without meeting the entity. But if he had something to trade...
“It was rather pleasant,” Cas said smugly, kissing Dean’s temple. “And now we’re bound. I’m yours and you are mine. For eternity.”
Sam stood outside Dean’s door, his heart breaking. He knew Dean had gone back to his room early yesterday and hadn’t emerged. Looking at his research table, Sam saw the notebook that was never out of Dean’s reach these days and a book tossed carelessly to the side of it. Whatever it was Dean had found, it had driven him even further into the bleak grief that shadowed him.
“That’s it,” Dean murmured, arching his hips back towards Cas’s touch. “C’mon, I’m not gonna break.”
They were never letting go again. Here, in Heaven, they didn’t need to.
“I do too,” Dean said quietly. He reached into another drawer in his nightstand, pulling out a silver ring he hadn’t worn in a long time. He took Cas’s left hand and slipped it onto his finger. “Cas Winchester. Mine now, no takebacks.”
But Dean didn’t reply. Instead, he shook his head, turned around, and walked away.
They stared at each other as the spells settled around them, binding them together, grace and soul. Their eyes glowed blue, Dean’s wide with surprise and awe and Cas’s filled with love. Within a breath, they desperately start kissing again. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, holding him tight against his chest as his hips continued pumping. Arousal flamed higher and their movements are desperate and needy as Dean rode Cas’s erection.
It felt good to laugh. Even if only for a moment. And it felt good to pull into the parking lot near the pie faire and see people enjoying all sorts of different pies. Dean’s mouth watered as everyone piled out of the Impala. An impish sense of mischief overtook him and he murmured to Sam, “Last one in line pays for everybody” before taking off.
“I accept,” Cas said simply, turning to Meg. “My grace and I leave here. No strings, no deals, no way to drag me back.”
“What did you just think of?” she asked, signing at the same time. Before Dean could answer, Sam sighed and put his phone away.
“I know you healed me,” Dean replied, shooting a warm glance at Cas for his promise to follow him. “I just think it’s time. I want a life of my own. I want a life with you.”
Take this morning, for example. All of them, Dean, Cas, Sam, and Eileen, had just gotten back to the bunker the night before from a hunt. It had been a rough one, though they’d all made it out. Their wounds had been healed by Cas. All that was left was the exhaustion. It was likely Sam and Eileen were sleeping in and Dean decided he and Cas weren’t leaving the bed for a few hours. Not even for coffee.
As Cas pumped his finger in and out of Dean, ever so torturously slowly, Dean’s hips started rocking with the movement. They kissed desperately, breaking to take quick gulps of air then diving back in. At this point, Dean was fully hard and he ached to be touched. But he kept his hands away from himself, wanting to prolong everything. Instead, he wrapped one hand around Cas’s wrist and tangled the other into Cas’s hair. Against his butt and lower back, he could feel the head of Cas’s erection rubbing against him.
He knelt, holding his hand gently to Dean’s chest. He glowed again and warmth flowed over Dean. The skin knit back together, the pain fading into an odd itching for a few moments before it disappeared. When Cas pulled his hand away, Dean saw an unbroken stretch of skin through the rents in his shirt.
Dean wandered the Empty, lost and confused at the lack of any sort of landmarks. How was he supposed to find Cas in this? He could be anywhere. He could be just out of reach and Dean would never see him because of this pervading darkness. He tried speaking, calling Cas’s name. But his voice was swallowed up, barely reaching his ears. He could hear odd sounds in the distance, shuffling of feet and a murmuring of voices. He wandered for what feels like forever, with no ways of telling time. He doesn't come across anything or anyone though he kept hearing those sounds in the distance.
“Okay, and why is he texting you?” Dean asked. Then took a bite of cherry pie and closed his eyes in bliss.
“Don’t die, got it,” Dean patted Sam’s back and pulled away. He was immediately pulled into a hug by Eileen.
So this was it. It felt serious, something that would take a miracle to survive. And there were no more miracles, no more healing hands and concerned blue eyes and a soft gravelly voice. And some part of Dean was okay with that while the rest of him screamed internally at the time now going to be cut short.
Another rumble of footsteps mixed with loud yells interrupted Dean. He watched as Meg's whole body flinched this time and she pressed her palm to her forehead. And, though his heart was pounding a mile a minute, he found the courage to step forward, give her a confident grin he's had way too much practice at, and pull out the folded piece of paper with the poem on it. He was careful to keep it folded so Meg couldn't see what was on it.
They drank, enjoying the peace and the sun and being together again. They’d done their best, they’d fought for the world and each other, they’d saved the world and each other. They’d made it a better place for the people who would follow after them. It was time to rest.
“I am and I also look like this,” Meg shrugged and took a sip of wine. “It’s easier to talk to people if I’m wearing a person. For some reason, angels, demons, humans, what-have-you, get a little creeped out talking to, how you put it, black goo.”
“I am glad to see you, Dean, even if you have passed to Heaven. What about Sam? Is he here?” Cas asked, making no move to remove his hand.
“Yes, yes, yes, need you, Cas, need you so much,” Dean muttered as he mouthed over Cas’s neck. He pressed a kiss to his pulse then trailed his mouth over the skin above Cas’s adam’s apple. Latching on, Dean sucked and worried a red mark into Cas’s skin. Then he laved his tongue over it. “Mine.”
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, great," Sam stammered, stepping away quickly from Dean and making a frantic gesture towards him with one hand. "Good to see you, Cas. Really good."
The raw pain in Dean’s voice broke Sam’s heart. He moved closer, close enough to put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. For a second, Dean leaned into the comfort. Then, he pulled away to take a slug from the bottle.
“Got it. Good luck, Dean,” Sam said. “Get him back.”
“Yeah, that’s the gist of it,” Sam nodded. Impulsively, he pulled Dean into a hug, which Dean returned. “Go get him back. And don’t die doing it.”
"So what do you suggest?" Meg asked, speaking each word distinctly as if conferring a favor on Dean in even considering he might have something to say.
Dean swallowed down the handful of angry retorts he had to that. Yelling at Meg, or the Empty, wasn’t going to get Cas out of here. He had to be clever. He had to think. He had to outsmart or negotiate with the Empty. Cas was depending on him. Dean wracked his brain for any idea, any advantage he might have. And then he remembered the end of the story the beggar woman had told.
Well, that was the signal it was time to get back to work. Dean left his dishes in the sink and hurried to the table he’d taken over as his own for the research. He passed Eileen on the way, Miracle at her side. They nodded at each other but Dean hurried on before she could stop him. The book was sitting on the top of the stack and Dean grabbed it before he even sat down.
A heartbeat passed after the last syllable left Dean’s lips. Before he could turn away in disgust, expecting nothing to happen again, a rip appeared on the wall. It was like the rip that led to the alternate dimensions only pure black instead of glowing orange-gold. It spread from the point on the wall Dean had seen the Empty appear. It stopped once the rip was about six and a half feet long.
“Hello, Dean.”
“No, you aren’t but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to tease you a little,” Cas said.
“I might be able to relieve some of the pain,” Cas offered. His voice was casual, diffident, but Dean fancied he could hear something else under it. Or maybe he was imagining it. “If you like.”
But it was enough. Because Dean was leaning forward, pulling Cas’s face towards him. He watched him the entire time, making sure he wasn’t making a mistake, wasn’t doing something unwanted. And then he closed that final space between them, his lips meeting Cas’s in a kiss that Dean had imagined every time his eyes had flicked down to Cas’s mouth.
“Did you...
Though life was known for changes. A year and a half after they got married, Eileen announced they were expecting. Twins. It was a huge change, for everyone, but it was a good one. Sam spent the pregnancy alternating between terrified and proud. They decided to buy a house a little outside town, not wanting to raise the kids in the bunker.
"You have someone trapped here I want back," Dean explained. "You're gonna give him to me."
. While Sam dealt with the texts, Dean stared off into the distance, pie forgotten in his hand. He only came back to himself when Eileen poked him.
“We can do it,” Dean finally said, interrupting the second time Sam started reciting the spell. “Get everything together. I’ll get you the last piece.”
Well, it was perfect too. Jack and Cas tearing down all the walls, releasing the souls that had basically been prisoners in Heaven. Letting people roam freely, create their own Heaven, be with the people they loved. Tearing up Chuck’s script and letting people... just be people. It was what Heaven should have been all along, instead of sealing each soul away in their own personal bubble.
He read it through a second time, staring hard at the words on the page. This had to work, right? This was the closest he’d gotten in far too long. Surely reading them a second time would get him into the Empty’s realm? But as Dean came to the end of the words, nothing at all happened in the room. For a few seconds, silence reigned. Then, the ventilation kicked on with a thump and Dean jumped.
Then, of course, another reception at Rocky’s Bar. While Dean had only wanted his closest family around him for the ceremony, he wanted everyone at the party. So, much like Sam and Eileen’s wedding, the bar was full of well wishers and people having a good time. And if he and Cas snuck out to the Impala halfway through the night, no one blamed them. Though quite a few smirks, and a few twenties, were exchanged.
It took a few more months but everyone settled into their new normal. The bunker was running smoothly, as was the bar. Hunters knew to come if they needed help and they often had at least one overnighting in the bunker. Everything was perfect and Dean didn’t think things could get better.
"Stay with me?" Dean asked, moving his hands down Cas's shoulders, his arms, around him to pull him into a hug. He opened his eyes to stare intently at Cas. "Please, Cas. Stay."
"Look, I have to say thanks," Dean started, rubbing at the back of his neck for a moment. He smiled crookedly as he continued, "what you told me? Everything you said? It saved me.
Day 1
Finishing the text conversation she was having, Eilleen stood behind Sam and rested one hand on the back of his neck. He leaned into her, taking comfort in her presence. The last of the hunters had checked in, had been directed to call someone if they needed help or a place to stay. Things were back to normal. Or, as normal as they could be.
And suddenly, it was the easiest thing in the world to say.
“No, it isn’t,” Sam nodded but his eyes narrowed as he stared after Dean. There was a pattern that Dean followed when they lost Cas. There was a devastation to him, almost a fragility to him, that Dean never seemed to have with any of their other losses. As if losing Cas leached something vital out of him.
The fingers on the back of his neck froze. A sinking pit opened in Dean’s stomach and he gritted his teeth. Son of a bitch, he knew better than that. He knew how to keep his thoughts to himself. Now what? Cas was gonna be offended and stalk off or be clueless and still leave. And Dean had probably damaged the friendship they had. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, to try and salvage the situation when Cas’s fingers started moving again.
“I don’t know,” Dean shrugged. His stomach grumbled and he reached for the sandwich. “Guess I could eat.”
He looked down at himself, over at Cas, and back down at his chest. A curious certainty settled into his mind, one that he didn’t want to fight. It went against everything he’d been taught to be but he didn’t care. Like his relationship with Cas, it felt right.
“I second the not dying,” Eileen told him. “When do you want to do this?”
He didn’t count how many times he hit the wall, didn’t notice as his knuckles scraped bloody on one swing. He didn’t hear Sam and Eileen come running, didn’t see them standing in the doorway with identical expressions of concern. All he saw was Cas, standing in front of him covered in black goo with satisfaction in his eyes. All he heard was the heartfelt speech Cas gave him before telling him he loved him. All he could feel was the hole opening in his chest as he realized Cas was going to be taken.
“What? I only got one slice of cherry, Dean,” Sam complained but he stared at the peach pie and licked his lips.
Nodding, since speaking hurt too much, Dean took as deep a breath as he could. Something shifted painfully in his chest as he did so and he had to bite back a groan. As soon as his chest finished rising, Cas had his arms around Dean's chest and was pulling him forward off the rebar.
Day 21
"Well that's simple," Dean shrugged. "Let the ones who woke up go home. Demons to hell, angels to heaven. They're out of your hair. Assuming you, uh, you know, have hair," Dean gestured at Meg's head with the paper.
“Not without you,” Dean whispered, taking Cas’s hand as he helped him stand. “All right. What’s the sacrifice you’d demand so Cas can get out of here?”
Dean and Cas both ignored an increasingly awkward Sam as the hug went on. Several long seconds later, Cas was the first to start to pull away. He smiled at Dean, a small bittersweet smile that went through Dean's chest with a pang.
"It's impressive, how much you look like Meg, even have some of her mannerisms. Creepy as hell but impressive," Dean replied. Then he leaned down and stared into Meg's eyes in clear challenge. His lips pulled back from his teeth in a smirk. "But we both know you can't handle it. Look at the exhaustion in your eyes, the desperation. You're at the end of your rope."
. Tasting skin and running fingers over exposed flesh. Taking time to learn each individual curve and angle, pressing a kiss to every sensitive spot.
“Sure,” Dean said after a few silent moments. “Go ahead and try.”
It was nice to know they cared and were willing to let him do what he needed to do.
Besides, the son the three of them had raised was God now.
“Do it fast,” Dean said.
“No, Sammy’s fine. He’s good.” Dean reassured Cas. And his heart beat faster over the fact that neither of them were moving their hands. But it felt good. Felt right. “He’s gonna be fine.”
Dean looked away to hide the blush that started to burn across his skin. He dropped his hands, albeit reluctantly. Then, out of sheer gratitude and unable to stop himself, Dean surged forward and pulled Cas in for a hug.
“It’s not required, no,” Cas finally answered. He smirked when Dean glanced at him quizzically. “Let’s call it... interesting timing and a wonderful side benefit.”
Worry lines appeared on Cas's forehead and his eyes narrowed as he saw the blood on Dean's lip. He moved so fast it was almost like he flew to Dean's side. A gentle hand reached around Dean's back to explore the rebar and the wound. The worry lines deepened as Cas met Dean's eyes.
“It won’t hurt any more than when I used my grace to put you back together,” Cas explained with a smirk that told Dean that, as long as it were Dean, Cas wouldn’t mind a little pain. Might even enjoy it. “Doing that didn’t diminish me and doing this won’t either.”
At Dean’s feet, Cas started to stir. He groaned lightly, one hand lifting to press against his forehead. In a moment, Dean was on his knees at his side again, helping Cas to sit up. Their eyes met and Cas’s widened in surprise and fear as he looked from Dean to Meg behind him.
“Still beautiful,” Cas remarked, staring up at Dean with a smirk at the corner of his mouth.
“Yeah, we’ll tell you the whole thing when you guys get back,” Dean promised, twining his fingers through Cas’s.  “How’d your hunt go?”
Pausing to read silently through the words, Dean made sure he had the correct pronunciations prepared. It was a short couplet. It seemed so odd to him that something so small and innocuous on the page could be the answer to the only prayer that had been on his lips for a month. Then, Dean read through the Enochian a third and final time.
“I should have told you then, should have found the seconds before you were taken,” Dean continued, his voice soft and wondering and a little sad. “Hell, I should have told you years ago instead of dancing around how I felt. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long. You didn’t deserve that and I’m sorry.”
“Dean, you shouldn’t be here,” Cas said urgently, sneaking another glance at Meg. “You have to get out of here.”
Whatever he was going to say next was swallowed as Dean leaned up and kissed him. As Dean traced the seam of his lips with his tongue, Cas slid the tip of his finger into Dean. He waited, throwing himself into the kiss. Then, when he allowed Dean to slip his tongue into his mouth, Cas pushed his finger further inside. They both moaned, the kiss growing hungry.
“Fascinating,” Meg replied dryly. But her eyes never left his face as she took another sip of wine. Then she continued, “What story?”
They didn’t leave their room until hunger drove them out in the afternoon. And both were too blissfully happy as they ate to notice Sam’s knowing looks at the ring Cas was wearing or Sam gesturing to Eileen. Their eyes were full of each other, now bound through Cas’s grace.
saved me."
"Hey Cas," Dean said, coughing again as he spoke. A fleck of blood landed on his lip. "I could use some help."
He was interrupted by the oh-so-familiar sound of wings.
Running a hand through his hair again, Dean glared at the words on the page then at the wall. Part of him was sure he’d just gone on a fool’s errand and that this wasn’t going to work. But the greater part of him wasn’t ready to give up on Cas yet. No. This had to work. It had to.
He dug through the books, looking for one he’d thought useless. After finding it, Dean grabbed a pen and flipped his notebook open to a mostly empty page. At the top, the words GET IN were written in all caps. Dean opened the book and found the page with the poem on it. Reading it through quickly, Dean realized that what he took for useless words actually sounded a lot like a spell. It was a spell to put the Empty back to sleep. And, if he was right, this would give Dean the leverage he needed to bargain with the thing.
He started reading, the odd structure of the poem lending it an strange cadence. But it was apparently the right cadence because Meg let out a long sigh and leaned back in her throne. A relaxed expression came over her face as Dean read to the end. He started the poem again, part of him thankful it was in English.
“Yeah?” Dean called, his voice a little hoarse with the pain of his headache.
“That was a lovely sound,” Cas said darkly in Dean’s ear. He moved his knee again, chuckling when Dean groaned again. “Just lovely.”
“Ah, thank you,” Cas said, a touch awkwardly as he stepped away from Dean. “For rescuing me. Thank you, Dean.”
He glanced up at Meg when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. She'd reached one hand out to Cas, palm up. As Dean reached the middle of the second repetition, she turned her hand palm down in one smooth movement. A heartbeat later, Cas's eyes opened. He glanced around, taking in the scene in a moment, his eyes widening to see Dean and Meg together here in the darkness. He opened his mouth to speak when Meg held up a finger to her lips to shush him. Dean reached to the end of the second repetition and paused.
‘Me too.”
“I found a way to get to Cas,” Dean explained, waving the book. “But I can’t find him in the Empty’s realm.”
"Yes," Meg hissed. "And several powerful people have broken their promise to me. Don't make their mistake. Cast the spell, Dean. On the second repeat, I'll wake your precious angel. On the third, I'll be asleep. I recommend you be
"Oh yeah, lots of people following the rules," Dean drawled, gesturing at the encompassing darkness around them. "Rather busy in here for a place that's supposed to be so quiet."
. The longer he stayed silent, the more Sam talked. Eileen even joined him, patting Dean’s arm in support.
“I’m good, Dean,” Cas nodded, his eyes never leaving Dean’s face. Then his smile faded a little, his expression starting to turn sad. “I had hoped you would have more time before ending here.”
Then he dipped his head to take Cas’s lips in a lazy, gentle kiss. As they kissed, they scooted a little closer to each other. Now, skin pressed up against skin and shared warmth bloomed between them. It hadn’t taken Dean long to decide, once they’d started this, to sleep naked next to Cas and Cas had decided the same.
“That’s great,” Dean said and clapped his hands together once. “Let’s get with the magic then. What do we need?”
“Well, I’m glad for you guys,” Sam said, taking a seat and grabbing a beer. He held it out to Dean and Cas.”To family?”
A yawning void filled him then and Dean felt tired and broken. He stared at the wall in silence, unable to muster the energy to even glare at it. Then, he turned and walked out of the room. He brushed past Sam without a word, managing the tiniest of nods to Eileen. It was good she was back, good to see her again. Sam needed her. But that was all he could manage as he made his way to the kitchen.
With an extravagant gesture, she encompassed the space all around them. Then she brought her hands together and clapped sharply once. It made no noise. All of a sudden, the noise around them ceased. She sighed in relief.
Dean woke up again to a headache and a nasty taste in his mouth. He groaned and rubbed one hand over his face. He’d only drunk one of the bottles before passing out last night. The other sat on his nightstand, within easy reach. He started to reach for it before a thought oozed out of the treacle his hungover mind had become.
Then it was Cas pulling Dean in for a kiss, his arms wrapping tight around Dean’s waist as if they belonged nowhere else. Dean went willingly, sliding his hand up in Cas’s hair and twining his fingers through it. This second kiss was still unhurried but hungrier, full of want and need. It went on and on, perfect and delicious. Dean lost himself to the sensation, joy bubbling in his chest. They kissed each other breathless, broke apart to breathe for a moment, then they were kissing again as if nothing else in the world mattered.
As Cas stared at him, Dean leaned forward. He kept his eyes on Cas’s, pausing when their lips were just an inch apart. But there was no denial in Cas’s eyes. Just a growing hope. So Dean closed the last distance between them and pressed his lips to Cas’s. Finally,
Yes, this. He'd dreamed of this, of kissing Cas, of feeling his body pressed up against his own. Of telling him how he felt about him and hoping Cas didn't tell him to go to Hell. Or, worse yet, explain all the reasons why Dean shouldn't be in love with him. But those worries disappeared as the kiss stretched, as Cas leaned into it just slightly, as Dean's fingers tightened a little on Cas's jaw. It was unhurried, a timeless moment that lasted as long as either could wish.
Instead of letting himself sink to the ground, Dean forced his legs into motion. He closed the distance between him and Cas, close enough now to touch. Which he didn't. Not yet.
Well, no, not really. Cas had been a huge help with research. But having him there, so close but not being able to touch, was pure torture. Not that an angel would ever let a ruined human like him touch him. No. Even with the little things that Cas sometimes did or the way they’d touch after being injured, there was no way a heavenly being would want that. Want him.
“Nearly?” Dean repeated, standing up and staring down at the book. “What are we missing, Sammy? Spit it out.”
Making his way to the kitchen, the silence in the bunker told Dean he was alone. A quick glance at his phone showed an unholy hour that he was normally still asleep during. That meant Sam and Miracle, and possibly Eileen, were out on their morning jog. There’d been a hunter staying at the bunker for a few days, to recover from a nasty wound during a hunt, but she’d left yesterday. It was a relief to have the place to himself. At least for a little while.
It had been a month since they’d defeated Chuck once and for all. One month since Cas had sacrificed himself for Dean. Again. One month since Jack had absorbed Chuck’s power and disappeared to go run the universe. Or something.
Day 4
It was mostly a hunters bar but locals did mix in. Mostly those who had had some brush with the supernatural in the past or knew who the Winchesters were. There were a couple kids, just barely old enough to walk in the door, who had known Jack who liked to frequent the place on karaoke nights.
Cas held Dean’s eyes for another moment or two. Whatever he saw there must have reassured him because he nodded. Then, he reached over to the nightstand on his side, grabbed his angel blade, brought it up to his throat, and used the tip to slice a small line just above his adam’s apple. Blue-white grace glowed through the slice, haloed by the red mark Dean had sucked into his skin.
“We’ll figure out a way to get him back,” Sam promised.
“Your words helped me and Sam fight Chuck. Helped us be more than he originally planned us to be. Planned me to be. I wasn’t just a killer, just a blunt instrument designed for violence and death,” Dean explained. He scooted a little closer on the bench seat, unaware of moving as he tried to make Cas understand what his words had meant. “Because of you, we saved the world. You saved the world, Cas, by loving me. You saved
“Well, that’s an easy answer. The only thing worth enough to an angel to leave this place,” Meg shrugged but her eyes gleamed in a way that sent shivers down Dean’s back. “His grace.”
). But it would be better to be tired than to be hungover. Pie deserved to be savored. He drove, rolling his eyes a little in fondness when Sam and Eileen both crammed into the backseat. Every once in a while, when he glanced in the rearview mirror, he’d see them with their heads together, sharing some story or other. It was adorable. And when Eileen grabbed Sam’s head and pulled him into a kiss, Dean automatically let out a wolf whistle to tease the both of them. Sam glared at him but couldn’t hold it when Eileen winked at Dean.
Making up his mind, another longing waking in his chest, Dean pulled over to the side of the road and put Baby in park. Listening to the purr of the engine, his hands resting on the wheel, Dean took a deep breath to try and calm his suddenly racing heart. It was hitting him. Now he had the time. Now, there weren’t enemies beating down the door, deals waiting to be fulfilled, people taken before he could even process what they’d said. Now, Dean could say his piece.
"Thanks, man," it was Dean's turn to whisper into Cas's ear. "I can't tell you how relieved I am you aren't trapped."
But no matter how much Dean wanted to, something stopped him from praying to Jack to get Cas back. If Jack had been able to get him out of the Empty, wouldn’t he have? Wouldn’t Cas have been waiting here in the bunker with Eileen if Jack had been able to get him out? After Cas’s confession, Dean couldn’t imagine anywhere else Cas would go. Even the apocalypse world hunters had been brought back. Charlie had helped with some long distance research but there was only so much she could do. The bulk of the information Dean was looking for, if it existed at all, was likely right here in the bunker.
“You better work, buddy,” he told the stone. “Let’s go.”
“You mean, leave?” Dean asked, his chest tightening at the thought. “Why?”
“Hello, Sam,” Cas said, grinning when Sam let out a whoop. “I’m back.”
“Goodbye Castiel. I hope I never see either of you again,” Meg said before she and the throne faded away.
A throat cleared itself behind Sam.
“Charlie and Stevie had a line on a demon,” Sam explained, rubbing his hands on his jeans before Eileen twined their fingers together. “We needed blood for the spell so we bled the thing before sending it on its way. You sure you wanna go through with this batshit plan?”
The twins, Connor and Elizabeth, were born on a dark night speckled with stars. Everyone fell in love with them immediately. Now, when hunters came to visit, many came with baby gifts. And nearly all of them spent a little time playing with the babies.
Then he got up, folded the jacket carefully, and headed into the kitchen. There, he grabbed the book then made his way back to his room. He set the jacket on the seat of the chair, patted it, and left without a backward glance. When he got back to the map room, Sam was holding the lodestone, which glowed a pleasing blue, and was signing with Eileen. They stopped their conversation when they saw Dean.
story. Not ours," Sam snapped, pulling out his cellphone as he started to walk outside. "We write our own story now."
“What is it, Dean?”
“Touch me, Cas, please,” Dean begged, pressing sloppy kisses to Cas’s mouth and cheeks. “Need you to touch me while you come for me.”
Dean and Cas were partnered, of course, as were Sam and Eileen. The four of them stalked through the building in silent concert, using sign language to communicate as needed. But even with how careful and vigilant they were, no one saw the vamp that suddenly threw himself at Dean.
Shrugging, Dean stepped back to lean against the counter and took a deep drink of his own beer. It was good, one of his favorite brands. It cooled his throat, dry and scratchy after having almost died. The only reason he hadn't was because of the angel standing in front of him, still staring. The angel who'd poured his heart out in an attempt to save Dean's life. Again.
“What are you thinking?” Cas asked, reaching out to cup Dean’s cheek. His expression was tender.
“Thanks Cas,” Dean said. He grabbed the back of Cas’s head and pulled him in for a quick searing kiss.
"But you want Castiel back, of course," Meg snarled, rolling her eyes. But she immediately locked them back on the paper. "Doesn't stop it being loud in here."
“Hey,” Sam said, looking at himself in surprise. He’d been old when he’d died but now he was near the same age he’d been when Dean had died. Then he looked at Dean and Cas’s joined hands and smiled. “I see you guys finally figured your shit out.”
"Fine, fine," notCas sighed then, within an eyeblink, Meg is stood in his place. She rolled her eyes at Dean then sat down in a throne that materialized under her. She lounged, a glass of deep red wine appearing in one hand. She drank, staring at Dean over the rim of the glass. "Better? I like this one better anyway. All dewy."
Silence fell between them, broken only by the random noises around them. Dean whispered another prayer to Cas in his mind, telling Cas yet again he as going to get him out of here, no matter what. The moment stretched, Meg never blinking as she studied Dean. She tapped one nail on her wine glass in a steady pattern.
“Yeah, I’m sure, Cas,” Dean nodded and the grin changed to something soft and tender. “I love you.”
The sigils lit up in the order he painted them in that same greasy anti-glow. The sigil Dean added his own blood to had a slight red hue to its glow. Then, a rip opened up into a pure black space. Absolute silence filled the room, a palpable presence. Dean put the bowl down, cleaned his pocketknife, put it in his pocket, patted the other pocket with the poem, and stepped through the portal. It shimmered a little and then Dean was gone as if he never existed.
On the other side was the familiar darkness and silence. But now, there was light and a warmth in his hand. He swung the stone around until it started glowing even brighter and the warmth pulsed. Then he started sprinting, the stone held out in front of him. He had no idea how far away Cas was but he knew he had to get there before he was yanked back out.
“Maybe?” he hazarded. “Let me go look through some stuff, do a little research. There might be something I can put together.”
While Dean didn’t run to his room, he didn’t dawdle either. His room had mostly become a physical representation of his grief. There were empty bottles littered over the desk and spilling onto the floor. There were a few half-empty mugs of stone cold coffee, evidence of the few times Sam had brought him some. Next to the bottles on the desk was a messy stack of papers that contained the sum total of Dean’s research before finding the book. Clothes were strewn about the room and the covers were haphazardly pulled over the bed. Only the nightstand on the right side of the bed was clean and empty. In short, it was a mess.
, that might help. Then, near the end of the story, his breath stopped.
“Oh god, that feels so much better,” Dean murmured. “I love you, Cas.”
He sighed silently when Dean made a soft noise of relief as one of the trio of knots finally released. At least here was something he could do for the human he loved. Shifting a little, Cas used both hands to massage Dean’s neck. And he would commit every detail of this moment to memory to hold and remember later.
He walked away, giving the two of them a few more seconds by themselves. The two boys were standing next to the Impala, the older brother with one arm wrapped around the shoulders of the younger one. They watched with wide eyes as Sam approached, poised to run if need be.
“Are you all right?” Cas asked quietly. “You were pale when you walked out of the room.”
“So,” Sam started awkwardly, jamming his hands into his pockets. “I uh, watched the security footage. In the storage room. From... from that day. With Billie. And... Cas.”
A knock on his door startled Dean out of his thoughts. For a moment, he stared in the general direction of the door through the darkness. Was it Sammy or Cas? What did they want? Did they have to show up now of all times? He was going through some world-changing epiphanies right now.
The day of the wedding, the Winchesters, Cas, Jody, Donna, Claire, Kaia, and Alex trooped into the courthouse. There, Jack met them, beaming at his extended family. Sam and Eileen were married in a simple civil ceremony, exchanging rings and kissing to the whistling and cheers from their family. The reception was held at Rocky’s Bar, the place full to bursting with friends and family.
“I’m glad, Dean,” Cas replied, his voice as soft as Dean’s. “I love you too.”
But it wasn’t to be. What felt like a few minutes later, but could have been an hour or a day or even a month, Dean felt a tugging around his middle. He pressed a hand to his chest in confusion. What was going on? Was something attacking him? Before he could take stock of his surroundings, not that anything was really changing, he felt like he was tugged backwards. The breath left him in a rush as he was thrown back through the rip and into the storage room. He stumbled and caught himself on the chair. The book threatened to fall off but he caught it. It was too precious to lose.
“Yuri,” Sam explained. When Eileen’s eyes widened in surprise, Sam continued, “He helped with the bullet wound. Sort of. Anyways, he’s kinda like a... librarian? collector?... of supernatural information and stuff.”
“You... the way you push me away, the anger you felt towards me, just... you don’t, do you?” Cas waved his hands a little helplessly. “Besides, I’m in a male vessel.”
And while they were hunters, Sam couldn’t stop himself from taking pieces of normalcy. He convinced Eileen to join him on a few morning jogs, Miracle happily panting as she ran between them. They bickered about movie night, joked around with each other, took care of Miracle, and generally started creating a life between the two of them. Each day felt more and more right and Sam couldn’t imagine this happiness with anyone else.
This was his problem, not Cas’s. His wants, his desires, his sins. His fault he wasn’t pure enough for an angel. He’d made choices and those had ruined him. Blackened his soul until he wasn’t worthy of being saved. An echo in Castiel’s voice ran through his mind and Dean groaned again. He wanted to believe, he really did. But what he did, all the lives he’d lost as a hunter. The only thing he could do now was save as many people as he could to try and balance the scales. Falling in love with an angel didn’t factor into that.
“But... she, it, the Empty, took your grace,” Dean said, staring at Cas. He didn’t really see anything different. Though, maybe, Cas looked a little... smaller? Less bright? He wasn’t sure. He also wasn’t sure if it mattered to him. It was still Cas. “What does that mean for you?”
“We?” Dean repeated, arching an eyebrow at Cas. “You sure?”
~*~*~*~
“Absolutely,” Cas nodded. He grinned and pressed another kiss to Dean’s hand. “Just because we retire from hunts doesn’t mean we can’t be useful to our fellow hunters.”
“Now? Now we wait until your little spell snaps you back home and you stay there,” Meg said, a thread of anger in her voice. “While Cas stays here.”
“Here we go,” Dean said and walked through the rip.
At that, a silence fell over both of them. It was comfortable but there was something tense and anxious in it. But not a bad anxious. At least for Dean. It was the anxious of anticipation, of words burning on his tongue that demanded they be spoken. There was just the tiniest kernel of fear that kept him prolonging the silence. Then he looked, really looked, at Cas’s face.
Then their kisses moved over the line of a jaw, down the throat, and across the curve of collarbones. Breathy moans joined the murmurs as mouths closed over skin to suck and bite. Featherlight kisses followed, soothing the delightful pains. It was everything, being together, being
Cas shook his head, smiling back at Dean. And if there was some self-deprecation in that smile, well, that was his choice. And even though his hope faded a little, Cas said, "I spoke nothing but the truth, Dean. I needed to and I was happy to have it be my last action. Or so I thought at the time. Standing with you, saving you, was the best death I could have hoped for."
Taking a deep breath, Sam bowed his head and closed his eyes. It had been a long time since he'd done this, an even longer time since he'd believed it might make a difference. But it didn't matter now, when Dean's life was in the balance. Sam would try anything.
"You want silence, you want to go back to sleep?" Dean asked. He waited until Meg nodded slowly, curiosity coming into her eyes, then continued, "How about a trade? I know what you want and I can give it to you."
“Headache,” Dean replied. Along with a few other things. “Just a bad headache. A nap should help.”
Dean weathered Sam’s anger, letting his little brother vent for a minute or so. Eileen caught his eyes and signed “You’re an idiot” at him before looking back at Sam to read his lips. Yeah, they really were a good match for each other. When Sam started to repeat himself, Dean raised a hand to cut him off.
"That's why you agreed so easily," Dean breathed. "You want to sleep so badly. It's all that matters."
Cas didn’t reply but the door closed and the room stayed blissfully dark. Dean heard footsteps move closer and felt Cas stop next to his bed. Now that he’d admitted to himself that he was in love, it was as if Dean could feel Cas no matter where he was.
When they broke the kiss a third time, Dean tucked his head into Cas’s neck in a hug. He smiled when Cas pulled him even closer so that their bodies were pressed against each other along every inch on the bench. Dean relaxed, finally letting go of every bit of stress and tension.
On a deep, gravelly groan, Cas reached between them and wrapped his fingers around Dean’s erection. Pumping in time with his hips, Cas watched Dean fall apart in his arms. Warmth curled in his belly and his muscles tighten up as his orgasm neared. Finally, when Dean, his eyes still glowing a fading blue, ground his hips down hard into Cas, taking him as deep as possible, Cas’s orgasm ripped through him. Shouting Dean’s name through clenched teeth, Cas threw his head back and rode out his orgasm. His hand never stopped moving on Dean and, within a moment, Dean was coming over his stomach. Their hips slowed, turning languid again as each came down from their orgasm.
The room looked the same. They hadn’t had any guests and none of them had needed anything stored in here. In his memory, Dean saw Cas standing in front of him while the Empty appeared on the wall behind him. Saw Cas smiling at him. Heard those three words again. Saw the Empty enveloping Cas, who had that peaceful expression on his face. Heard his sobs as he realized Cas was really gone.
“I don’t know if other angels do, but I feel love like humans do,” Cas said. “Are... are you sure?”
With a small chuckle, Dean sealed his lips over the slice. They both sighed as Dean started to drink. It was like swallowing ice and lightning, Cas’s grace coating his mouth and throat. As he swallowed in delicate sips, savoring it, his hips started to rock. Cas’s grace coursed through his body like it was mapping every single inch. And Dean swore, as Cas’s grace filled him, that he could feel what Cas felt, could feel how much Cas was into this (as was Dean), could feel how much he
“Maybe all he needs is time,” Eileen continued, pressing a kiss to the top of Sam’s head. She smiled at being able to reach it since he was sitting. “All we can do is be here when he needs it.”
While the boys shared the water, Sam leaned against the Impala and waited for Dean and Cas. They came out a minute later, walking as close to each other as they always did. Sam snorted to himself at the sight. Yep, everything back to normal. They took their accustomed places in the car for the drive back to town, though Sam noticed even more frequent glances from Dean in the rearview mirror at Cas.
"Yes, Dean?" Cas asked, tilting his head curiously. And he waited, hope and fear threading through him simultaneously.
"Hello, Dean," Cas's familiar voice filled the barn and the empty hole that had grown in Dean's chest after his death. "Hello, Sam. Jack heard your prayer and sent me to help."
“Sam,” Dean interrupted Sam, clutching the stone tight. “I got it. The rock will help me find him.”
"What?" NotCas pouted for a moment then laughed. "Not happy to see your angel in a trenchcoat?"
A distance away, a disturbance kicked up. Raised voices for just a moment, distorted enough to be unable to make out words. Meg visibly flinched, her eyes narrowing. She tried to hide the reaction behind another sip of wine but Dean caught it. His own eyes narrowed as he stepped forward again.
“I’ve always wanted to do that,” Sam chuckled and wiped his eyes. “Oh, so worth it.”
A cavalcade left the bunker, cars filled with deadly hunters and the weaponry that was their tools. Donna took the lead in her truck with Dean, Cas, Sam and Eileen behind her in the Impala. The others followed at their own paces, mostly spaced out so that it wasn’t a huge line of hunters following.
In her turn, she shared stories of her and Sam’s life. How they’d married, how they’d made a life together, how Sam had become a nexus of help and research for hunters. How they’d had a son they’d named Dean in honor of the brother Sam had lost and they’d both loved.
Real Cas.
“Let’s go home, Dean,” Cas whispered against his temple. “Let me show you what I’ve made.”
Dean let himself linger a bit over breakfast. Bacon sizzling tempted his appetite and his stomach grumbled hungrily again. While things cooked, Dean made himself a cup of coffee and refrained from splashing a little whiskey in it. He had a good feeling about the book he’d found last night. A clear head would be better for it. When the eggs and bacon were done, Dean ate quickly. He swallowed down the last of his coffee as he heard the bunker door open in the distance. He recognized Sam’s laugh, likely to something Eileen said.
“It’s good to have you back,” Dean began.
“We need some of Cas,” Sam explained, pointing again at the book. “To make the lodestone work.”
love? I didn't think that was possible. That you guys could feel like that."
“Yeah, yeah,” Sam said and exchanged a significant glance with Eileen.
One word forced its way past his lips, around the screams that had died down to pained whimpers.
Cas looked at the ring, tears burning in his eyes. He knew the significance of the ring, knew that Dean had worn it for years. Knew what it meant for Dean to give it to him. Taking Dean’s hand, the ring pressing against both of their fingers, Cas kissed the pad of each one. He savored the intake of breath after each one, using the gesture to all but worship Dean.
While Dean lost himself in a fever of research, Sam and Eileen did what they could to put the world the hunters knew back together. With the Apocalypse world Bobby, Jody, and Donna, they put together a network for the hunters. Now, no one needed to worry about having their covers checked. Someone would answer properly, give all the reassurance that was needed. Sam found himself one again becoming a de facto leader. It was a role that still didn’t feel comfortable but it felt
Laughing, the four of them walked down the steps to the beach. Above, the sun started sinking towards the horizon, painting the sky in a riot of pinks and oranges and reds. As the Winchesters and Leahys joined the party, everything was perfect in their lives.
Once back in the bunker, Dean beelined for the kitchen. A set of footsteps followed him, so quiet Dean didn't think he would have heard them unless he was listening for them. He grabbed two beers out of the fridge, opening them both with a careless ease. Then he turned to Cas and held one out. Wordlessly, Cas took it but didn't drink. Instead, he only watched Dean.
“I want that too,” Cas murmured, lifting Dean’s hand to his lips to press a kiss to his knuckles. “So we retire from hunts.”
As Sam continued to try to console him, going through the spell and explaining every little detail, Dean let the words wash over him in a senseless torrent.
"Well?" she asked, gesturing with the wine glass. When Dean didn't say anything, she sighed again and continued, "To what do I owe this dubious pleasure, Dean? And how
Dean's heart stopped in his chest on seeing Cas. It thumped when he saw the expression on Cas's face. And his heart was in his throat when he turned to the Empty.
“I mean, you don’t have to,” Dean shrugged, deliberately nonchalant. “I mean, I could eat it all myself...”
"No, Sammy, this is it for me," Dean shook his head and coughed. He could taste blood in the back of his throat. "This is how it was always gonna end for me."
Quietly, Sam and Eileen left the room. Eileen closed the door behind them, a soft smile tugging her lips as she took a last glimpse at Dean and Cas. As she and Sam walked away, to give the two some space, they decided to leave the bunker for a little while. It would be more comfortable for everyone all around if they did. Besides, Dean and Cas deserved some space to themselves for a while. After a quick, joking argument half in sign language and half spoken, they decided to go get dinner and maybe catch a movie.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed. He tilted his head up and kissed Eileen, smiling into the kiss. “I’m so glad you came back.”
“Something of Cas’s?” Dean asked, narrowing his eyes as he thought. “Well, the trenchcoat would work well but he was wearing the damn thing. I think there’s some clothes of his in his room. Hasn’t worn them in a while, though. Think they’d still work?”
“How can you ask me that?” Dean demanded, anger flaring in his chest.
They hurried to catch up with the others, always keeping an eye on their surroundings. By the end of the hunt, thirty-two vamps lay dead. None had gotten past the pairs set at the doorways, there to make sure none of the monsters escaped. There were injuries, one worse than Dean. One of the hunters had lost an eye. But Cas went through the group, healing the worst of the injuries and closing wounds. He couldn’t do anything about the lost eye but he could heal the wound so that it didn’t hurt and wouldn’t become infected.
"And how do you feel, Dean?" Cas asked, his voice soft. A strange ache filled his chest but it wasn't painful. It was anticipation and hope and nerves and a trilling joy begging to be released.
Then, he stirred the mixture in the bowl with the knife. A greasy, almost anti-glow came from the bowl. Dean picked it up, walked to the wall that the Empty appeared on (and where he'd gotten the residue) and started using the knife to draw a series of sigils in a circular pattern on the wall. Lastly, he used a clean pocketknife to add his own blood to the final sigil, as he would be the one traveling to the Empty's realm. The last part of the spell was a final phrase in Enochian
As for when, right now seemed pretty damn good. Sam and Eileen were on a date. For once, no hunts were on the horizon. Everything was pretty normal, for them. So Dean had the bunker to himself, though Eileen had signed to him before they left to call them if he needed them. There was no way Dean was going to interrupt them, though. Not when they were getting a slice of happiness. Besides, he kind of wanted to do this himself. For himself and for Cas.
"We both will," Sam promised. He pressed a hand to Dean's shoulder, holding up his other to stop Dean when his older brother opened his mouth to speak. "I have an idea."
“Cas, c’mon man, I need you to wake up,” Dean shook Cas, speaking and praying the words simultaneously. “I got us a way out of here but I need you to wake up. Please, Cas, come back with me. Come back to me.”
As he looked up, preparing himself to go through the rip again, it shrank into itself and disappeared. Huffing out a breath, Dean couldn’t help the relieved smile or quiet chuckle that escaped him. He hadn’t found Cas yet but he would keep searching until he did. He had a way in now.
He’d rolled over to see Cas watching him sleep. The brilliant blue of his eyes was dim in the shaded nightlight Dean had plugged into the far corner. It was just too dark in here otherwise. Cas smiled at him as soon as their eyes met, the hand draped over Dean’s waist shifting as Dean moved then tightening into a hug.
“Wait,” Dean said again.
Dean shook his head sharply, dispelling the echoes of his crying. It was time to do something about the Empty taking Cas. He glanced around the room, trying to decide where to stand. In the open? Or against the wall? There wasn’t much in the story about getting to the Empty’s realm. Just the little tidbit about getting in and making a sacrifice if one wanted to get out. Finally, shrugging, Dean moved to stand by the wall where the Empty had appeared. Stood to reason the entity had come into the world here so it might be easier to get to its realm from here.
“The woman who told it said she was given visions by God. That God had a dark entity that helped him, kept his children in its realm when they died,” Dean said. He watched Meg’s face carefully, seeing a thread of curiosity in it.
"Ah, right, your angel," Meg laughed. She held her hand in a fist, thrust it out to the side, and opened it. There, a short distance away, Cas stood.
“I mean, yeah, there’s a spell to help locate someone,” Sam said, dropping the book on the counter and pointing at the relevant passages. “Works kinda like a lodestone, homing in on the person.”
“You need to eat so you can be ready when Sam comes back with something,” Eileen explained. She gestured at the sandwich and ate another chip as if to coax Dean into eating too. “When’s the last time you ate anything?”
“Me too, though I suppose the question now is, what do I do?” Cas mused. He looked away from Dean but Dean thought he had to drag his eyes away. “Perhaps... perhaps I can find my own place, go on some hunts, help other hunters.”
A second finger joined the first, stretching Dean a little farther. Now, Cas moved a little faster, burying his fingers deep before drawing almost all the way out. He drank in the pleas and the moans that fell from Dean’s mouth, enjoying the taste of each. And he let his hand roam over Dean’s chest, tweaking a nipple or drawing trails down his belly.
"That's it? All of them are back?" Dean shot back. When Meg nodded, he continued suspiciously "Where's Cas?"
Taking a deep breath, Sam knocked on the door. And he kept knocking until Dean answered, grumbling and swearing under his breath. He blinked up at Sam, his eyes bloodshot with more than alcohol. He stood there, waiting for Sam to break the silence.
Inside the room, Dean and Cas were still locked in their hug. Neither seemed willing to let go. Both had tears in their eyes. More tears tracked down Cas’s cheeks, his hands fisted in the back of Dean’s jacket as if he was never going to let go.
when he’d never believed he could before.
“It’s Sam,” Dean said when he looked at the display. “Trust him to interrupt. Hiya Sammy.”
A grin stretched his lips back from his teeth as Dean closed the book and set it on the chair in the middle of the devil’s trap. Then, without hesitation or a backward glance, Dean stepped through the tear into the Empty’s realm.
“Well, first, thank you,” Dean said after a few false starts. But as he spoke, the words came easier, drawn out of him like water falling into a well. And he was falling, into the deep blue of Cas’s eyes. Into hope and love. So much hope. So much love. “Thank you for telling me what you did. How I changed you and how you love me because you feel I am capable of so much love. Of how everything I do was for the love of family.”
And the most important thing to say.
Dean looked around, eyes narrowing. He was as sure as he could be that he’d pronounced the words correctly. Enochian had some different pronunciations than he was used to but he’d made a point to learn to speak it since finding out angels were real years ago. Maybe he needed to read it again?
Were there holes? Sure. Like how was he going to find Cas once he got there, how was he going to deal with the Empty, would the spell get them back, and, if not, how do they get back? But, well, fuck it. It was Cas and this was the first decent chance Dean had of rescuing him. He was grabbing it with both hands and not letting go.
Sam closed his mouth with a snap and huffed out an angry breath. He looked at Eileen and they held a quick, silent conversation. At the end of it, Eileen shrugged. Sam huffed out another breath and shook his head.
Day... fuck... 20? Yeah.
“Yeah, sorry,” Dean blinked, focused on Cas’s face, and smiled. “What’s up, sunshine?”
“It’s true,” Cas started to say before Dean shook his head with a shushing noise.
they made a sacrifice,” Dean said. He whispered a prayer to Cas in his head then continued, “What do you think about that?”
More bottles, one harder than the beers he’d drunk yesterday. Dean glanced around the kitchen, wondering if he was hungry. But his stomach twisted at the thought and nausea clawed at the back of this throat. Hair of the dog, then. Dean wove his way back to his bedroom, shutting the door behind him with finality. Then he proceeded to crawl to the bottom of all the bottles he’d brought with him.
Which didn’t make what Sam wanted to talk about any easier. After Dean had drowned in the alcohol so early in the day, Sam finally found the strength to look at the security footage from the room. To see what had really happened, other than the barebones facts Dean had given him. To see that Cas had sacrificed himself to the Empty to save Dean from Billie. He listened to the confession Cas gave Dean, tears blurring his eyes. And when it was all over, Sam could only watch Dean mourn. Now he understood why Dean hadn’t answered the phone. Now he understood why it had taken Dean hours to get to them, why he hadn’t wanted to talk about what happened to Cas. Why he had still worn the jacket with the bloody handprint on the shoulder. Why that jacket now held pride of place on a chair in Dean’s room.
“I like cherry,” Sam argued while Eileen just ate her blueberry pie and watched.
“Of course, Cas, of course I’d find a way,” Dean replied. He stepped closer to Cas, something in his chest dropping when Cas took another step away. Taking a deep breath, Dean continued, “Hey, look, I’ve been thinking about what you said. Before the Empty took you. About how the one thing you want, you can’t have.”
Dean let out an explosive sigh, feeling a punch to the gut at Cas's words. In Hell, Dean had become something he'd always fought against. He'd broken on Alastair's rack and had, in turn, become the torturer. When Cas had appeared, a shining light so bright that Dean could barely stand to keep his eyes open, he hadn't believed it had been to save him. At first, he'd thought that the light was purging Hell. Cas had seen him at his lowest, his worst, and had fallen in love with him then? The thought humbled him and filled him with so much relief he thought his legs might buckle under him.
So, Dean had reasoned, it was up to him to get Cas back. Jack couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do it for whatever reason. Maybe he just didn’t know how. Maybe absorbing Chuck’s power didn’t give him all of Chuck’s knowledge with it. After all, the kid was only three, much as he might look like he was in his twenties.
Reverently, gently, Dean picked up the jacket. He cradled it to his chest for a moment, staring down at the blood. Then he left the room to go find Sam. He and Eileen were in the map room, having taken one of the tables to set up the spell. As Dean walked up and took a seat at the table, Sam dropped a piece of dark gray rock into a bowl that already had a few other ingredients in it. He murmured something in another language and the rock started to glow.
Cas laughed as Dean used their join hands to gesture up at the ceiling. Honestly, he’d only heard of the spell being used once. It was something most angels knew about, of course, but not something many wanted to use. Which was understandable. How often did one know, without question or hesitation, that one wanted to bind oneself to another being for all of eternity? Here, with Dean, Cas had no hesitation or doubts.
Thinking about it was just something to keep him occupied while the room filled with hunters. There were a few late stragglers, still driving to the bunker. Cas was sitting next to him, their hands loosely tangled together on the table. It was perfect, even if they were gathering all these hunters to go after the biggest vamp nest any of them had ever heard of.
“It means I’m human,” Cas shrugged and a corner of his mouth lifted in a wry smile. “Which is not as bad as being trapped. So, I’ll take it as a win.”
Afterwards, neither could say who moved first. But within a heartbeat, their bodies were pressed together. Dean’s fingers tightened on Cas’s jaw as their lips met. It was soft, tentative, a question rather than a declaration. It didn’t stay a question for long. It felt too right, too perfect, to remain anything less than a promise.
So that’s exactly what they did. A few of the older hunters jokingly referred to the bunker and the Winchesters as Bobby 2.0. But while they joked, they were grateful for the help. Sam and Eileen continued to hunt as needed, Sam even continuing to learn and use magic. Always carefully, always without harming the innocent. Magic was another tool, one that was incredibly useful. And Sam was good at it.
He looked up at Dean, his eyes going dark with sympathy. Putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder, Sam continued, “I don’t have anything of Cas, Dean. No grace, no feathers, no hair, nothing. Without that, I can’t make this spell work. And it’s the only one I’ve found that I think has a chance of working.”
Nodding, Dean swallowed hard and picked up the knife sitting next to the bowl. There was a black, gummy residue along one edge of the blade. Using a bit of holy water, Dean washed the residue into the bowl. As he did, he murmured a few words in Latin. Then he grabbed the jar of demon blood, pouring it slowly into the bowl while saying other words in Latin. Lastly, he grabbed another jar with a handful of feathers, some dark, some light, some patterned. The last of their stock of angel feathers. Dumping the feathers into the bowl, he spoke another set of words in Enochian.
Taking a deep breath, Dean stepped the final step closer to Cas. Their bodies almost touched, close enough to share warmth. His hand slid up from Cas's shoulder to cup his jaw. Then, Dean tilted Cas's face up slightly, paused for a moment as he looked into his eyes, and kissed him. The kiss was soft, gentle, a featherlight touch. Dean kept his eyes open and saw as Cas's eyes widened in surprise then closed. A small smile tugged at the corner of Dean's mouth as he closed his own eyes.
. Not like Dean was with him.
Meg tried to smirk back but the expression was fragile, the smirk dropping to a frown. When a yell burst from behind her, Meg flinched hard. She closed her eyes and Dean waited in silence, heart in his throat. He recognized that half-crazed look in Meg's eyes. Seen it in himself more than once in the last weeks. Here it was. The moment when the Empty would be ready to deal. Or not.
Ater making sure the books and artifacts were back in the box, Dean closed it up and set it back in its place on the shelves. Then, he tucked the important book under one arm and left the room. He paced the bunker for a few minutes, trying to find the best place to attempt the spell. The story didn’t say anything about ingredients or special locations. It seemed all he needed was the words.
Dean said nothing, just studied her for a few tense moments. Like notCas, this is decidedly not Meg. Much as it might wear her face.
"Not that I'm not grateful as hell, Cas, but how are you here?" Dean asked. He didn't realize his hands were still holding Cas's coat in a death grip.
Dean stopped in front of the chair and stared down at the bloody handprint. It was in the same place as the brand Cas had left on his shoulder when he’d pulled him out of Hell. It was all Dean had left of the angel who loved him. The day after they’d come back to the bunker, victorious, Dean had balled up the jacket and thrown it in the corner, unable to look at it. The next day, he picked up the jacket, smoothed it out gently, and draped it over the chair. Then he’d turned the chair so that he could see it from his bed. The handprint was the last thing he saw before passing out at night and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes in the morning. And now, that handprint would help him find Cas.
“I don’t want to be... a burden, an awkwardness,” Cas murmured, glancing up at Dean before looking away. “When I... told you how I felt, I did not expect to come back. I know you don’t feel the same so I don’t want to impose.”
“I love you,” Dean said when they broke the kiss to press their foreheads together. “I love you so damn much, Cas.”
“I didn’t think angels felt things like humans did,” Dean continued. He grinned self-consciously. “Looks like I was wrong.”
When Cas opened his mouth to speak again, Dean shook his head and held his finger to his lips in unconscious mimicry of Meg. When Cas's lip curled at the gesture, Dean quickly prayed.
As Dean drank, Cas tugged at his hair as an exquisite pain blurring in pleasure coursed through him. He couldn't help but start pumping his hips again, no longer smooth. He moved in stuttering motions, Enochian falling from his lips in time with his hips as he worked his way through the spell. On the last word, Cas’s eyes flared. Taking a breath, judging that Dean has drunk enough, Cas pulled him away from his neck. The wound healed quickly, disappearing as if it never was.
“And it’s my favorite,” Dean shrugged. Then, as if he hadn’t been planning it from the moment he saw them bring out the peach pie, he pointed at the uneaten slice. “You wanna trade?”
Dean was silent for a long moment, his eyes locked on the slice in Cas’s neck. There was something unreadable in his face. The moment stretched, the only sound in the room their breaths. Finally, Dean broke the silence.
“Yes, it was dumb. Yes, I should have told you,” Dean said. “But I didn’t. So can you help me? Do some kind of spell or something that helps me find Cas? Or something?”
“We were but are you sure you want us to leave you?” Eileen asked, moving to Sam’s side. She took his arm, making them a unit. “You want us to wait until you and Cas get back?”
Running footsteps moved past, what sounded like several pairs. Whoever it was was swallowed up by the darkness and Dean couldn’t catch a glimpse of them. Meg rolled her eyes and shook her head but the motion had a flavor of exhaustion to it.
“Great, see you when you get back. Burgers all around,” Dean said. “Great job.”
“I would follow you to Heaven, Dean,” Cas said immediately, his voice softening as he took Dean’s hand and cradled it in his. “But you didn’t die. I was able to heal you.”
A few disparate pieces of information came together in his mind. Suddenly, the poem he’d found a few weeks ago wasn’t so useless. Not if it did what he thought it might. The Empty
They continued to kiss and murmur to each other. Time passed in a slow, liquid crawl, neither in a hurry to move on or even get out of bed. Hands roamed over skin, fingers tracing soft trails over old scars, remembered hurts, freckles, and muscle. Their mouths moved together in what had become a familiar, yet no less thrilling, dance.
Following Cas’s directions, Dean drove to a house not far from where Bobby had told him John and Mary lived. It was a comfortable place, with a lived-in, well-loved look that Dean immediately liked. And inside, it was almost like an amalgamation of everywhere Dean had felt was home on Earth. It was Bobby’s house and the bunker and Baby, somehow portrayed but not copied. It felt perfect.
Now. Now he was home.
"No. No, you don't get to wear his face. Pick someone else," Dean's voice went flat and angry as he stalked a little closer to notCas while speaking.
On the sand below them, hunters and their families lounged or played. Adults, children, those who’d grown up in the life and those who’d been thrown in. Friends, family, and their extended family. Connor and Elizabeth were playing in the waves, trying to dunk each other. Claire and Kaia cuddled on a blanket, Jody and Alex a few feet away talking earnestly with Donna. Charlie and Stevie were debating over a grill, the scent of cooking meat filling the air. It was a good scene. Even Jack had taken a break from being God for a bit and was curiously watching the meat cooking on the grill.
The use of their full names felt oddly formal but right for this moment. It was a vow, as much as whatever this spell was going to be. They were each other’s and were never going to change their minds.
Not bothering to turn his light on as he stalked into his room, Dean threw himself on his bed. He rubbed a hand over his face, silently cursing the headache that was pounding behind his eyes. It had been building for the last several hours of research and staring at the little words in the books had not helped. Nor had Castiel.
During the briefing, Sam had decided that the hunters would all hunt in pairs. It made sense, watching a partner’s back and having yours watched when they were all outnumbered. It stood the hunters in good stead now. There were injuries, hunters clawed or thrown into walls. But, thankfully, there were no deaths. Their partner guarded them, distracting the vamps long enough for the injured one to get to their feet or killing them outright.
“It’s just... that, well, Eileen and I might have found a case,” Sam explained, hunching his shoulders a little. “Something about home invasions and people’s tongues being cut out while the kids are abducted. The last one, the father was exsanguinated.  It sounded familiar so I went back to Dad’s journal. It’s one of his old hunts.”
Dean felt a blush flame across his cheeks but warmth filled his chest at Cas’s words. It felt strange, but a good strange, to hear Cas say things like that. Not that he was attractive, no. He’d been hearing that and variations on “You’re pretty” for nearly as long as he could remember. But when Cas said it, there were worlds of meaning in the words. He meant it literally and he was in awe. He knew Dean as no one else did, had seen every part of him including his soul. Had seen everything he’d done, knew every regret, knew everything and everyone he’d lost or failed. And still considered him beautiful. It was a miracle Dean often went weak-kneed with gratitude for.
“W-what?” Cas stammered, unconsciously leaning a bit into Dean’s hand. His eyes were wide and locked on Dean’s.
Dean shot Cas a look that begged for patience. Then he started saying the poem again. As he spoke, Meg's eyes drooped and her head to lolled on her shoulders. As he neared the end, her eyes closed and her head dropped back to rest against the back of the throne. Once he spoke the last word, Meg melted into black goo and pooled into the darkness below them.
Picking a direction at random, since every one looked just like every other one, Dean started walking. He tried calling out a few times, but the sound was swallowed. Plus, from the enveloping darkness, a few worrisome rustlings seemed to be pacing him. It was nothing he could name nor could he pinpoint a direction the rustlings were coming from. So he walked in silence, praying desperately to Cas in his head.
The bed sank as Cas sat down on the edge. He didn’t speak again. Instead, he reached out and found Dean’s shoulder. His fingers rested for a moment before sliding up and splaying out over the back of Dean’s neck. Rubbing slowly, Cas worked out where the tension was. There was a knot at the base of Dean’s skull and a trio of knots that fanned over his neck and towards his shoulders.
When it came to Sam and Eileen’s turn to order, they took a few moments to look over the offerings. Eileen ordered a slice of lemon meringue and a slice of blueberry. Sam decided to get the sampler, which was six small slices of whatever pies he wanted. And, of course, he took the last slice of Dean’s favorite cherry pie. But that was okay. As Dean stepped up, Sam and Eileen hovering to the side waiting, they brought out a fresh peach pie. Dean smiled as he ordered the sampler and made sure he got two slices of peach. After paying, the three of them found an out of the way bench to sit on.
"Hold on, just a moment more," Cas whispered in Dean's ear.
Finally, he tried praying.
He squirmed away from Cas, lamenting the loss of his fingers as Cas pulled away. Then he rolled Cas onto his back and ranged his body over his. Grabbing the bottle of lube, Cas took Dean’s hand in his other one, pressed a kiss to the palm, and followed the kiss with the bottle. Then he sat back, propping his head up on his hands to watch.
“How can we help?”
Day 2
“I’m listening,” Cas said softly when Dean fell silent. He gently pressed Dean’s hand on his shoulder in reassurance. “What did you want to say?”
As the final truth settled into his mind, soft as a feather and heavy as a mountain, rage filled him. Red darkened the edges of his vision and Dean found himself up and running before he even knew he was moving. An eyeblink later, or so it seemed, found him in the storage room they’d been in. Where they’d tried to hunker down away from Billie. Where the Empty had taken Cas. With a scream, Dean picked up the chair sitting in the center of the devil’s trap and swung it at the wall the Empty had appeared on. Over and over and over, tears streaming down his face and heart-wrenching screams boiling in his chest.
“So, that’s everything but the piece of Cas,” Sam said, looking at Dean. His eyes took in the jacket Dean held and then widened. “Oh.”
"Jack," Cas smiled, fond and proud of his son. "He rescued me from the Empty. Same with the others awake. Now that it's quiet again, the Empty has gone back to sleep."
Cas grunted then his mouth opened wide. Blue-white light streamed from his open mouth and his eyes, curling into a ball in Meg’s hand. It went on for a few moments then the light stopped. Cas slumped against Dean and would have fallen if Dean hadn’t wrapped an arm around his waist.
“I think they’re gathering because they’re scared,” Sam finally said, cutting into the third round of the circular argument. “Things have changed, what with Chuck being depowered and Jack taking over. Things are quieter, on the monster front. I think they’re gathering together for protection.”
“To family,” Dean and Cas echoed, picking up their beers and clinking them against Sam’s.
Then, a surprised grunt whooshed from between his lips as Cas threw himself at Dean. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas a second after Cas did the same. And, this time, he doesn’t stop himself from tilting his head into the crook of Cas’s neck, doesn’t stop the tears burning in his eyes. All he could do was hug Cas tighter, grateful beyond words that it worked.
Cas.”
The only other fairly clean point in the room was the chair that had a green jacket with a bloody handprint on the left shoulder draped over the back.
Moans and names spoken like a benediction filled the room now. The sound of flesh sliding on flesh joined them. Dean’s head fell back on his neck as he moved a little faster. His own erection was throbbing now, leaking a little in arousal. But he was too focused on Cas inside him to touch himself. Besides, the ache and the need only added to the sensation.
Dean slowed, turning the radio off as he stared down the road. It was on a road like this one, with fall trees displaying gorgeous foliage, that he’d once hallucinated Cas walking down. When the angel had still been trapped in Purgatory, when Dean still had believed he’d failed to get him out, he’d seen Cas here because he’d wanted him to be here so desperately.
He swiped claws down Dean’s chest, opening bloody furrows that bled freely. It hurt like a bitch, enough that Dean was shaken for a few crucial moments. He didn’t see the look of triumph on the vamp’s face, didn’t see the fangs descending towards him. But he did hear Cas’s roar of rage and see the angel grab the vamp by the back of his neck and throw him halfway across the room. He saw Cas stalk towards the vamp with deliberate steps, saw as Cas held him down with one hand on his chest. Watched as that hand started to glow and the vamp started to scream. Within moments, a charred shape was all that was left.
"This is going to hurt but I can heal you," Cas promised. "Take a deep breath for me, Dean."
Dean trailed off again but this time, it wasn’t because of uncertainty. This time, he fell silent so he could touch. Sliding his hand up Cas’s shoulder, Dean cupped his cheek. It was the same as he’d done it so many times before, only this time, Cas wasn’t dead or dying or injured. There was no terror here, no worry that he’d lost him. There was only peace and love.
And a year later, it was Sam’s turn to come to Heaven. He was greeted by Dean and Cas, their hands linked as they sat in chairs by a table. A third chair sat empty across from them, three beers still wet with condensation sitting on the table.
“Sure,” Sam said, signing at the same time. “What with?”
Nodding slowly, Cas reached up and patted Dean’s hand. Then he just rested his hand over Dean’s. His skin was warm, the touch soft, and Dean was struck breathless for a few moments at the simple contact. At the wealth of affection and love that Cas could show in a single gesture.
"I will. Once you start the spell," Meg replied. "It's going to take multiple repeats."
“Dean?” Cas leaned close to murmur in his ear. “You’re staring off into space.”
He leaned down again, needing to be closer. Instead of letting his hands go, Cas let his arms slide down to the bed. Their fingers were still locked together, Dean’s arms spread out along Cas’s. Cas caught his mouth, licking into it hungrily. With Dean spread over his chest, he wasn't able to move as easily so Cas started pumping his hips. Up and down in long, smooth motions while Dean panted against his lips.
By now, Dean had to admit that he needed some help. So, holding the book with the spell in it, he went to find Sam and Eileen. They were in the kitchen, making lunch and being disgustingly domestic about it. Dean smiled when Eileen hip-checked Sam and signed something at him that Dean couldn’t quite make out. Sam laughed and shook his head, throwing a chip at her. She caught it, winked at him, and ate it.
“Later,” Dean said, blinking hard at the tears that suddenly burned in his eyes. But it was right. It was perfect. “Right now, I’ve got other plans.”
"You're very welcome," Cas said, as the silence stretched for a few awkward moments. "You owe me nothing, Dean. I chose to save you by summoning the Empty. I chose to tell you everything I felt. You have no obligations to say anything in return, feel anything in return."
you get here? That's what I'd really like to know."
A faint hope took root in the center of the void in Dean’s chest. He turned away from the bottle on his nightstand, stood up carefully, and stretched. Then, with a sense of purpose filling him, he grabbed clean clothes and headed to shower. There was a lot of work ahead of him.
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean replied. “
"Pick. Someone. Else." Dean grated between clenched teeth.
Sam dashed after him, Eileen just laughing and calling encouragement to Sam. And, of course, with his gigantor legs, Sam made it to the line first. Dean punched his shoulder but stood in line behind Sam. When Eileen caught up with them, Sam took her arm and pulled her up next to him. Dean rolled his eyes and huffed out a breath but a smile still tugged at his lips.
“Yeah, oh,” Dean said while Eileen looked between the brothers in confusion. Dean caught her attention and held out the jacket so she could see the bloody handprint on the shoulder. “It’s Cas’s blood.”
Setting the book aside, Dean let his head dip a little. Tears burned in his eyes as his hope was dashed. He’d thought this might have the clue he needed, some way to bring Cas back. But no. It was just a dead end. It was useless. Just as he was right now.
"It's done and we're gonna bring you back to your mom," Sam reassured them.
Behind the bar, stuck to the wall, was a large art piece that Dean had bought specially. It had taken him a while to accept himself because of the life and the man his father had wanted him to be. Dean didn’t want that for any of the hunters who might come through. To most patrons who didn’t understand the significance, the art piece was just a collection of colored lines. But to the people who claimed the identities the flags represented, the bar was marked as a safe haven. It became Dean’s habit, whenever he caught someone eyeing the Pride flag art and smiling or sighing in relief, to slide them a beer. On the house.
His fingers pressed against the wound on Dean's back. It was as featherlight a touch as he could make it but it still wrung another grunt of pain from Dean's throat. Concentrating as he never had before, the love he'd finally spoken to Dean not too long ago filling him, Cas's hand glowed with healing energy. And in just a few moments, the damage to Dean's back, the internal damage in his chest, and all the aches and scratches from the vampire fight were healed.
“You should take that, it could be important,” Cas whispered, his breath feathering over Dean’s lips.
It wasn’t until he was wandering aimlessly down one of the side streets in town that Dean saw it. A For Sale sign in an old bar. He stopped the Impala outside the front doors, staring at the sign and the building it was attached to. For as long as they’d been living in the bunker, this building had been empty. The sign above the bar was faded enough that Dean could only make out the word Bar towards one end. Memories of a bar formed completely in his head ran through Dean’s mind. And he made up his mind in that moment.
“He won’t wake,” a familiar, droll voice said behind Dean. “Not if I don’t want him to.”
“I’m surprised God told anyone about me and my function,” Meg said, her lips turning into a scowl before she smoothed her expression. “Go on.”
Dean nodded, licking over his lips as he stared down at the blue-white glow in Cas’s throat again. He braced one hand on the bed next to Cas’s head and threaded the fingers of his other hand through Cas’s. Cas tilted his head back on the pillow, his free hand tangling in Dean’s hair. Dean leaned down, pausing just above Cas’s throat to look at his face. One, because that position and expression were hot and two, to make sure that Cas wasn’t going to change his mind. When Dean took two seconds too long, Cas growled, tightened his fingers in Dean’s hair, and pushed his head down.
“No problem. A small vamp nest that kept kids for later feeding,” Sam explained. “We took out the vamps and saved the kids. They’re with family now.”
“You were the one watching me,” Dean stated. He shook his head. Of course the Empty knew he was here the whole time. Of course. It was just his luck. “So what now?”
Dean, I... should go," Cas said, moving to set the bottle on the kitchen table.
Cas,” Sam repeated. He pulled the book closer to him and read, “Finally, you need a piece of the person you are looking for. Hair, skin, fingernails, saliva, blood, bone. It needs to be a piece of them in order for the spell to latch onto them.”
Two long moments passed in absolute silence. Nothing appeared, no miracle happened. The rebar was still in Dean's back and he could feel the seconds trickling away as blood slowly dripped from the wound. He started to shake his head, opening his mouth to offer... comfort, reassurance,
“It is a win having you back,” Dean said, stepping closer to Cas. “I’m glad you’re back.”
Dean trailed off as a forkful of key lime smacked him in the face. Eileen nearly fell off the bench laughing and had to catch her slices before they fell off her lap. Sam laughed as Dean wiped the forkful off his face. Then laughed again as Dean shrugged and ate it.
“Then drink,” Cas continued. “I won’t let you take too much.”
How was he here? Had he escaped the Empty? Worse yet, had he struck another deal with the entity?
"The way I see it, I'm holding the high card here," Dean brandished the paper. "I can put you back to sleep. Let you dream all your little dreams, torturing the dead demons and angels here."
It started out well. They’d gone in during noon, hoping most of the vamps would be deep asleep. Most were. They died quickly and silently as the hunters stalked through the abandoned warehouse the vamps had taken for their own. The problems began when one vamp, stumbling out of an open doorway, took one look at Jody and Claire and started screaming at the top of his lungs.
“I love you too,” Cas smiled and bucked his hips up into Dean’s hand. “Now let me fuck you.”
A timeless eternity later, somewhere down the never-ending stretch of road, more of Bobby’s words came back. Dean had died believing Cas trapped forever in the Empty. Though he probably should have guessed that Jack would have done something about that. The new God wouldn’t leave Cas trapped forever. Not if there was something he could do about it. And apparently, he had.
The topic settled, they drove back to the bunker in companionable silence. It took a few days but Dean eventually brought the topic up with Sam. His brother was happy for him, a reaction Dean hadn’t expected if he were being honest. But it was a relief, knowing his brother didn’t feel like he was abandoning him. Besides, he and Cas were perfectly well suited for research and knowledge and providing a safe place for hunters.
“You got something?” Dean asked. “Can you do it?”
into the Empty without telling us? What the hell, Dean? What if you couldn’t get back? What if something killed you there?”
you... love him too?” Sam asked hesitantly. He wasn’t sure if Dean was going to answer as the silence stretched on. Just when he was about to turn around and leave Dean to his grief, Dean’s voice stopped him.
“Yeah, I can get behind that,” Dean laughed. He leaned up and pressed a sweet kiss to Cas’s lips. “Was sex required for that? Is that how angels do it, up there?”
Tears stung Dean's eyes as he remembered seeing Cas enveloped in the Empty. Remembered the peace on his face, how his eyes never left Dean even as he was swallowed. Remembered the void losing Cas had opened in his chest before he'd even gotten a chance to process what he'd told him. Or even say anything in return.
Dean couldn’t think of anything to say to that. He couldn’t think of anything to say at all, really. It felt like his speech had disappeared. But that was all right. They’d said everything they needed to, he thought. And Cas’s fingers were speaking in a language all their own as they massaged out the last of the knots. And didn’t stop moving. Instead, their touch turned soft, gentle, loving. Dean leaned into Cas’s fingers and savored.
