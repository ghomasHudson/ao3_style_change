There was a pause; holding his breath began to get uncomfortable and John started to panic. "I think I'd like that," Sherlock said finally, sounding perplexed at the thought.
It was almost flattering, though, not only that Will could apparently look at their relationship and see the closeness and the unexpected intimacy that John had wondered whether he was imagining, but that it worried him. He had discovered many years ago that romantic jealousy was far more long-lasting than romantic desire: he didn't want the playwright for his own in that manner anymore, but it still gave him an unpleasant twinge in his belly when his friend displayed want for anyone other than him. To see evidence of the same in the other man was gratifying.
," the Doctor continued, tapping out a distinctively short sequence at the computer. Sherlock almost laughed as the Judoon looked at each other; he didn't think their rhinoceros-like faces could register puzzlement, but their postures were doing a fine job of it.
Her cold blue eyes remain stubbornly narrow. "What story? What do you know? What
John drains the last of his Budweiser and sighs again. Lestrade waves the bartender for another. "So maybe some time apart would do him good," he ventures.
John sits down on his bed and sighs. He'd known seducing Sherlock would be risky. He just hadn't thought that he'd get quite this far before being slam-dunked. He hadn't thought he'd have the memory lingering in the back of his mind of just how close he'd actually come, refusing to allow his erection to subside.
Sherlock stops walking, his hands dropping to his side. "John, please," he says sadly. "I… he'll… he'll
They walked for another few minutes; Sherlock guessed that the forest would be right on the edge of the complex, assuming by the way she had said it that they only had one forest to power the school. He casually slowed his pace a little so that he and the Doctor were walking a few steps behind the two women.
Sherlock shrugged. "We can't know exactly what role Carfax plays until we know who she is to the Queen," he said. "But that would certainly be the most obvious reason."

, that an hour's encounter as a seventeen year-old could have such an impact on the rest of my life, but the fact is that I wouldn't be the same person I am now if I hadn't met you."
Suddenly there were hands snaking around his waist and hot breath on his ear. "What if I don't want personal space?" she said softly. John tried to stop the impulse – perhaps left over from the camp – to throw an elbow in her face and run for the door.
Because that
John grinned. "I was an exceptionally bull-headed twenty year-old." Sherlock laughed. "I don't remember much, but Bill still insists that half the people at that party told me not to go that way and I kept waving them all off. I was never a very sensible drunk."
John let himself frown a little, tilting his head to one side like Ganymede was one of Sherlock's puzzles he actually had a chance to figure out. "
"Oh, are you French? That's lovely. I'm really sorry about running into you, it's just I'm running late for the bus, Chelsea wanted me to see her room. I'll see you later, bye!" She dashed off again, and Sherlock wasn't entirely surprised when he heard the sounds of her almost colliding with someone on the next floor down. He chuckled.
He realised he was talking out loud and quickly shut his mouth and successfully kept the last sentence in his head.
Each word slaps him in the face; it's like being tied to the back of a van galloping down a busy street, face smashing at high speed against the pavement at every turn.
He was still processing what that would look like for the audience - even Rosalind had changed her dress in order to reveal herself - when there was a commotion at the stage door for Will's entrance as the deranged Malvolio. Still clasping Sherlock's hands in his own, John turned to watch them. "
You're all spectacular human beings. Here, have some smut.
John smiled. "Just do a slow lavolta," he compromised, leading the opening galliard step at Sherlock's brisk nod. They danced for a few moments, John fighting the urge to say something else under its cover. "Sorry for kissing you before," he relented finally. "I should have at least given you some warning."
Sherlock sometimes thinks he should be worried about the amount other people speculate about how he and John got together.
Sherlock grinned. "You know, John," he said conversationally, "sometimes I think I don't give you nearly enough credit for your good ideas."

because we're pussyfooting around it instead of putting it out in the open and acknowledging it." He stepped forwards, taking a deep breath that shook slightly. "I want you," he said clearly. "And you want me." Sherlock said nothing, still scrambling to pull his thoughts together enough to form a coherent response, and John's face faltered slightly. "Don't you?" he asked.
, do we, Sherlock?"

"Still there, then?" the voice answered. Sherlock considered making some kind of John-like sarcastic comment about

I handled this terribly and I promise, if you give me another chance it won't happen again. Last night was incredible, Sherlock, can we just pretend that the morning after never happened?"
Shakespeare shoved him playfully. "Oh, well," he said brightly. "
Captain Adler hummed. "You can take T'Penya," she negotiated. "But you need psi-null crew members as well. And you can't take Doctor Watson," she pre-empted; Sherlock closed his mouth with a frown. He always looked surprised when the Captain seemed to know what he was about to say before he said it: John had tried to explain to him once that it was because Sherlock requested John's assistance on
A thoughtful look came over his face. John chuckled as the expression settled on him. "It was good," he confirmed sagely.
Julien did not take his eyes away from the other man – slightly taller than him, so that he had to tip his chin upwards slightly in order to look him in the frighteningly blue eyes – as he hummed reluctant, non-committal acknowledgment.
The detective looked at the knife distractedly. "I'll pay for any repairs when I leave, he knows that," he replied. He picked up a ball of red string and tied one end to the knife and the other to the pin holding up his copy of the Carfax portrait.

"You're still here," he would gasp. "Why are you still here?"
Joseph Grieg was quick to open his office door and let Sherlock in. It was darker in there than the corridor outside; the curtains were half-drawn, casting a warm yellow light over everything. This coupled with the sheets and sheets of paper everywhere to create an almost Classical air that was warm and comforting. As he moved back behind his desk, Grieg almost looked like some ancient historian.
He thought he was being so nice, trying to coax the detective into eating and sleeping and being nicer to witnesses. Thought he was helping. He'd told himself that Sherlock would be grateful in the end, that he was improving his life, looking after him. It hadn't even occurred to him that he was, technically, trying to change his flatmate, and that said flatmate might not want to be changed, and were the situations reversed, yes, he would be rather angry.
one."
"Where you were posted during your military service," Holmes continued, helping him to heft the man back into place between them. "Eight, nine years ago? The biggest concern for the British Army was the Spanish sympathy with the French Catholics. You would have been sent to Ireland or France, which was it?"
Sherlock gave him a quick once-over to check that he wasn't pool staff – unlikely, given his chosen method of entry - then folded his arms. "Neither are you," he said coolly.

legs below the knee, couldn't think of any part of his body the web of pleasure didn't quite reach. He had just enough presence of mind to register that the detective had stopped biting him in favour of whining softly against his neck, his fingernails digging into John's back and buttock as his hips jerked involuntarily and another fat bead of liquid dripped from his long prick onto John's, smoothing the way for their thrusts.
basement."
A rush of relief hit him at around the same moment as the dog; a hairy, reddish animal that barked happily and planted its front paws into John's chest, its tongue aiming for his face. He laughed from the sheer relief of it, gently removing the dog from his chest and grinning at his best friend. Sherlock didn't return the expression.
It's lucky Sherlock's trying not to laugh too. When John loses it, Sherlock starts to chuckle as well, ducking his head embarrassedly. "All right," he admits through his giggles. "I'm sorry. That was… too prosaic."
he managed quietly.
"I know," he replied, pulling away just far enough to look into green-grey eyes and smile, weak and bewildered. "Me too."
The Doctor did drop his coffee cup this time, sending a splurge of over-milked and –sugared espresso across the tiles. "Killed yourself?" he asked, completely ignoring the stout German woman who flocked over to their table with a mop and a loud voice. "What do you mean?"
Sherlock obliged after an exaggerated deep breath in.
"Yes. The man in that cell was intimately linked with them, as was Neville St. Claire. In fact, it's not the only thing they've done – do you remember that case last November, John, with the film crew for the BBC who were cheated out of all that money?"
Smiling nervously back at him, they went. Alone in the basement, Sherlock stared at his extra shadow. "Doctor?" he said after a moment.
he suggested brightly.
John happily obliges, teasing the fraenulum with one hand and keeping Sherlock close with the other as their lips meet, gentle and lazy and passionate.
Sherlock caught the screwdriver, but didn't immediately use it. John had used to tease him sometimes about his use of dramatic timing and effect, but he'd been in enough standoffs with dangerous criminals to understand its completely practical usefulness. He looked at the screwdriver for a minute before finding a tiny dial on one side and setting the thing to setting thirty-seven. He nodded at the Doctor, who flicked the PA back on.
the detective responded, straightening his posture and appearing to compose himself.
John gaped. His reactions to Sherlock - too close, too personal, too
Lestrade actually stuck his tongue out at Sherlock, who chuckled at him. "Maybe we could return to the case in question," he suggested. "Perhaps you should bring in a few of your new recruits with all of their telly-watching experience. Shock them out of wanting the serial cases."
as well, it's not fair if I –"
Sherlock gulped down his own coffee and grimaced at the taste: the Germans, he'd discovered, made an extraordinarily strong and bitter brew. "Yes. I have to be, really. I should really start making this my home." He gazed out of the window and sighed. Frankfurt wasn't bad, really, as far as towns went. He could get used to it.

Self-disgust tears his stomach lining apart mercilessly, but he knows that mercy is not something he deserves from it. Maybe alcohol wasn't the smartest plan he could have come up with after what he just did completely sober, but when the pint arrives he downs it in three swallows anyway.
John shook his head, his hair rubbing softly against Sherlock's neck. "We already have most of it," he said, a smile audible in his voice. "I don't think it's a lot at all."
I will also readily admit that the dynamic between the Lord and Lady Brackenstall, up to and including her involvement in drawing classes with a man named Miracle, was inspired by (all right, taken pretty much straight from)
His stomach clenched unpleasantly at the half-smug, half-sympathetic tone of the assassin's voice, far too calm for a man who had just been forcibly pinned against his own living-room wall. "Thank you, Constable," he said calmly. "I do appreciate the urgency of a missing persons case and I understand why you would be suspicious of a man with a custom-built coffin in his living room, but I do think your colleagues could have handled the situation without assaulting me."
Sherlock seemed to realise he had made some sort of social

. John kissed him soundly. "I'll most definitely hold you to that," he assured him, circling his hips against Sherlock's to emphasise the point. Sherlock made a noise that seemed to stick in the back of his throat and tightened his hands on John's back, any response apparently forgotten as they sped up their movements against one another. "
He placed the two men's hands together, but Sherlock yanked his back to his side before it could touch Molly's.
John seemed to recognise his expression and stepped close to him, a subtle hand running reassuringly down his sleeve. "All right?" he asked, quietly so that Donovan wouldn't hear it.
It was unexpected, perhaps, especially given the place of origin, but he was not a man to be swayed by a little discomfort like that, and so Detective Inspector Lestrade squared his shoulders, held his breath, and marched straight in again.

of sexual pleasure he had never explored; John generally touched himself with the express purpose of getting off, he rarely toyed around with his pleasure beforehand. Sherlock, apparently, was practised at teasing, at building up the pressure until he – or his partner, John supposed, though he wasn't sure he wanted to think about the
The Doctor pulled out his screwdriver and pointed it briefly at the shadow. "It's Vashta Nerada," he said heavily.
"His name is Eduardo Lucas," Lestrade provides. "I'd give you more information, but you probably already know more than we do."
Molly laughed awkwardly. "Um. Not too much, women don't tend to fight much. I can be slapped and that's about it."

They waited on stage until everyone had taken a bow, then took one last one with the entire cast. John caught the stagehand's eye as they left the stage, already hurrying forwards to help Tobias out of his dress. "Have you seen him?" he asked.

No-one had ever complimented him quite like that before. He'd hated himself for it, but he'd pushed further, his attempt to coax further compliments out of John's thin lips pathetically obvious. But John had smiled, invited further observations, and called them

John, and a tiny flicker of sympathy for the murderer he was impersonating crept up on him.
Sherlock smiled tightly at him. "Thank you, Angelo," he said. John hadn't got the impression that Sherlock particularly liked full-bodied ale, but the detective picked up the drink and took a sip without grimacing. The innkeep gave them two thumbs up and vanished backwards into the inn once more. Sherlock cleared his throat. "What I meant was," he continued, as though there had been no disturbance, "

The detective grinned expectantly, a smile of knowledge shared. John, not quite having connected the pieces in his mind, stared blankly back. Sherlock sighed impatiently. "John," he explained, "that coffin was twice as tall as it was deep. Bigger on the outside than the inside. In fact, from the size of the outside, you ought to have been able to fit two of her in there."
He returned it with as bright a grin as he could muster, and he and Julien kept walking. "Brainless?" Julien ventured once they were out of earshot.
Lady Trelawney-Hope's silvery-pink nail polish fiddles with the hem of her tunic, a little flattered smile playing on her mouth. John shakes his head wryly, but neither of them are paying attention to him. "What?" she asks shyly.
Lestrade, too, looked up at them anxiously from his position by the window when they returned to the sitting-room. Sherlock shook his head briskly. "She didn't talk to us," he said shortly, burying his hands in his coat pockets. "I'll start looking for the man, but I think we ought to keep the search unofficial for now. There may be more to this than we thought." He pressed his lips together, clearly irritated by Lady Brackenstall's lack of co-operation. "John and I need to leave. I've finished with this room, once you're satisfied you can let her get rid of that bloodstain and have the curtains put back up."
Amy bit her lip and shrugged. "I
The playwright frowned. "That's exactly what concerns me."
The two of them let the beat stand for a moment, watching each other intently. Then Molly seemed to relent, his posture relaxing in defeat. He turned back to Sherlock with arms open in a false smile.
I was completely straight until he touched my head."
The girl chuckled too, putting the large sheet of paper – it looked like a flow-chart of some description – on the glass. "That would explain why Miss Bailey always acts like she's on a sugar-high," she mused. "I'm Sophia," she added as an afterthought.
Sherlock began to pace slowly around the chair, his vulnerability of a moment ago quickly replaced by something almost smug as he spun the false tale.
look became even more pronounced. John felt like clawing out his own heart and flinging it desperately in the direction of London. No-one had ever told Sherlock he was brilliant before, and then just when he found someone who did, that someone abandoned him like he was nothing. John could see Sherlock's life spread out before him; would he shun human contact completely now, snap at the people who tried to help him? John could have changed that, could have made other people see how amazing Sherlock was.
John shook the barman's hand; Sherlock noticed that John was standing straighter than usual, puffing out his chest slightly with a sort of firmness in his eyes that he recognised.

The consulting detective leans back in his chair, surveying her with his sharp green-grey eyes. She blushes again as his mouth curls into a lazy smile. "I really do like your haircut. Sorry, that's a bit invasive, isn't it? My sister wants a new hairstyle, it would look
Something that almost sounds like a sob echoes through the door as he closes it behind him and stumbles up the stairs to his bedroom in some state of clinical shock.
he said, his tone bordering on hysterical.
Sherlock shrugged as he waved an arm for a taxi. "I look after the people who help me so that they'll help me again."
John half-heartedly agreed, smiling at Hannah as she raised her hand in a final farewell. Maybe, one day, he'd find someone.
"Yup," the redhead replied easily, joining him on the trek through tables towards the door. "Much Ado About Nothing."
good," he agreed, his fingers twitching slightly. "And I know exactly how I could use it. Not too grandiose, slightly humorous…" John fondly watched his old friend wander off, muttering to himself and tapping his fingers against his sides. He chuckled once more.
Sherlock's smile disappeared as though John's words had Vanished it. "All right."
There's always something to be said for admitting to oneself that you're attracted to someone; John has suddenly allowed himself to sit in the armchair by the fire and really
"Oh, take your time. That cry, the greeting cry McCarthy says his father called even though he didn't know he was there? It's Australian. Turner spent time with McCarthy senior in the mines in Australia."
Sherlock chuckled lowly, leaning forwards over the desk, bringing his face closer to the teacher's. "Do you really think so?" he asked. He watched as the blond's eyes dropped quickly to his lips, and licked them; he could almost laugh to himself. The man was
Ben shrugged easily, helping John into his fairy pantaloons. "I know you're an honourable man," he said simply; John wondered if he was imagining the tiny wistful bent to the words. He made as if to help John tie the points on his trousers, then seemed to think better of it and dropped his hands. "I'll go and see if Sherlock needs help," he said, his face splitting into a grin at the thought. "Isn't this exciting? I mean - I hope Tobias is okay, and all, but doing
And that was it, he was gone: Sherlock bit down on his fist hard enough to draw blood as his release coated his hand and landed in hot splashes over his stomach and everything went white.
"Mmm. Who was the officer in charge of the investigation?"
"You… we've known each other for days, and you want us to move in together? You know my entire life history just from looking at the way I walk, but you can't possibly know if we'll cohabit well together from two days' acquaintance." Sherlock opened his mouth, probably to argue that last point, but John held up a hand to show he hadn't finished. "On top of that," he continued, "we're about to start working with each other.
"I'm not sure yet," Adler replied. Though she sounded as in-control as she always did, John could detect a note of concern in her lilting voice. "It didn't sound good, I requested they beam up before they explained further. I'm coming down to hear T'Penya's report from medical."
Lestrade reached out and placed a photograph on the table in front of her, watching her closely. "Stewart Montgomery," he said slowly. "Did you know him?"
He sits down opposite me. "Can I help?" I look up at him, trying to think what he could do to help. "Maybe you just need something to take your mind off it for a bit. Is there something we could do to help you think of something else?"
The woman shifts in her seat, looking affronted. "But Mr Holmes, I hadn't even finished my account," she protests. Sherlock's eyebrow makes another skyward bid. "I saw him in Southwark on Monday morning."
or another one of those myriad insanely unrealistic crime-shows. He insists it's luck. John reckons he actually checks to see when they're on, because as much as he claims not to enjoy them, he certainly gets right behind the characters.
A sharp rap sounded on the door; John quickly turned, putting a step of space between the two of them, to see Angelo leaning against the frame, grinning at them. "Sorry to interrupt," the inkeep said smugly.
talk to me, Sherlock. What is it?"
I'm not a performing monkey."
John caught the hand in midair with his own and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to it.
"Act Five is all one scene, and it may be a little confusing to read through, so take five minutes before we try it," the playwright said cheerfully. "Then we'll just go for it and see how far we can get."
to tunnel under this street. So clearly someone's been up to something." He brought back the camera feeds to show the room that was supposed to have the staircase; it was lined with banks of safe-deposit boxes, but Sherlock couldn't see any kind of trapdoor or hidden entrance. It didn't look like there was anything in there at all. Except…
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
The doctor hummed. "Where's your laptop? If you're using mine, I'm going to use yours."
Sherlock knelt in front of the doctor and shook him gently. "John," he murmured. "John, time to wake up."
"Protect the bullied on your own and get into a lot more scraps," Bill replied airily. "You're too BAMF to ever change."
"And you're not watching the black market? Can't you do this yourself, Mycroft?" Sherlock snaps.
The actor brightened, withdrawing the folds of paper from an inside pocket of his incredible coat. "It's very difficult to gain an accurate picture of a play from two cue-scripts, especially when they only contain the first act," he said briskly. "One day, I should hope it will be possible to give every actor an entire script before they begin to rehearse. A character is shown just as much by other people's lines as their own, and I have seen a great deal of subtext and foreshadowing left out of good plays because the actors simply did not have the information to portray them."
And then they were kissing, and it was brilliant: Sherlock's lips pulled and sucked at his own with the scientist's usual determination, their fingers clutching at each other to keep themselves upright as the floor shook around them.
John would shift awkwardly against the wall. "I… I heard my name. That's why I came in. I couldn't help it."
The detective seemed to consider the idea for a moment, but then he shook his head. "Too big to be significant," he dismissed. "Nice thought, John, but I can read Lestrade too easily for him to be involved in this."
The Doctor scoffed. "No," he dismissed, flicking a far less careful hand at a row of Chinese history books. "There will never be anything else quite like curling up with a book. Maybe it's the smell, or the texture, or just the romanticism of the
But what if he didn't?
was infinitely more rewarding. Even the scenes where it was only the two of them with dialogue there were others on the stage, watching and reacting, and the other players not roped into that particular scene were gathered on the fringes of the stage watching them. This was such a departure from the up-and-coming
Tom seemed to drive purposefully slowly, which made Sherlock smile, and when they finally arrived at the station it was to see the London Central train pulling away from the station. Tom smirked into the rear-view mirror. "What a shame," he said conspiratorially. "Lots of traffic on the road today, wasn't there, Sherlock?"
Sherlock uses the table to pull himself up, presenting John momentarily with a disarming view of the seat of his trousers. John realises after it's too late that he probably shouldn't have been staring. "No, it's all right," he says, clearing his magnificent throat and readjusting his clothing. "Send her up."
my blog?" he asks incredulously. "Can you say that again, and I'll get it on camera?" Sherlock rolls his eyes, but he's still smiling. The violin lets loose a sudden, joyful crescendo and then falls silent again.
The detective frowned as though he hadn't considered this possibility. "Why would she help her?" he asked.

John was starting to get used to being ignored by the detective's acquaintances. Sherlock, though, gave a huff of irritation. "I can choose my own helpers,

with the volume on the telly at maximum, but it still took him a moment to grit his teeth, identify that the sound was coming from the downstairs flat, and force his way through the soundwaves to the door to try and address the tiny landlady.
On the other hand, Sherlock seemed to be the exception to all of the other rules that John had made for himself in the theatre. He lifted the hand steadying Sherlock's back and stroked it through his hair instead, parting their bodies just enough to press their lips gently together.
Sherlock looked away awkwardly, pretending that he had intended to break the kiss. "I've made a lot of bad judgment calls when it comes to men," he said quietly.
The smile that had been threatening Sherlock's calm and interested expression finally broke free. "I've heard that before," he interjected when the Time Lord stopped for breath. "It's from a book, isn't it? John must have read it to me. Was it the
They arrive at Pentonville Prison in a flurry of black coats and curls and scarves – well, Sherlock does – and imperiously demand access to the cell where they're holding Humphrey Boone, the homeless man being held in connection with the disappearance of Neville St. Claire. John tries to look as though he has some idea of what's about to happen, but he has to admit that when Dimmock turns up, red in the face and clearly hankering to yell at someone, he's just as clueless as the rest of them.
The detective shrugged, dusting breadcrumbs from his fingers. "I glanced at the new material," he said, indicating it. "There's only one new scene between the two of us, but it's good."
"I suppose after we find the coffin ourselves we can have him in for obstructing the course of justice," John suggested, trying not to smile as the detective carried on walking with a distinct limp. "Want me to take a look at that foot?"
, the exercise, the reason they were there at all – but looking back at John's face he wasn't sure the doctor was remembering it either, lost in the feeling of rubbing their groins together in increasingly quick motions.
Had he been with anyone else, Sherlock would have been embarrassed at how quickly he came. It was lucky, he supposed, that he'd been
Sherlock nods and pulls out the little leather bag of lock-picking tools that had been given to him by 'Santa' at a Scotland Yard Christmas party. They're ninety-nine per cent sure it was Lestrade, and John makes a mental note to thank him sometime. He would have known exactly how much use it would get.

signal between the two of them. Sherlock glances at the doctor with a sort of idle smile on his face. "I'm afraid I can't help you."
Billy did not react to the command, merely watching as the detective extended a hand to help John from the desk. John stared at it for a moment: he didn't need Sherlock's help getting up, and the other man surely knew that. After the moment had passed, John took the hand softly and pulled himself off the desk with it. "Thanks," he said softly. Sherlock smiled tentatively.
that John almost wants to leave the carriage completely.
Oddly, the same dynamic could be applied to Orsino's perspective of Cesario's interactions with Olivia: whatever the cause of the jealousy, he couldn't help but be impressed with the speed with which the servant he had become so fond of was wooing his intended, couldn't be sure whether it was jealousy of someone else seducing his lady-love or of a woman winning the affections of the boy he liked so much. And if it
Until this one.
"Yeah," John said wryly. "And when I do, please shoot me." Bill tried to look offended, failed, and chuckled into his coffee.
Jim shrugged innocently. "Maybe it's because I wasn't scared of him? I don't know. I didn't start it or anything. He's only like that because of his father, anyway."
John grinned and switched off the shower spray. "I think we agreed it's acceptable if the sex is

"Thank you, Celine."
The crash this time was almost deafening, and John thought he heard the sound of wood cracking and splintering from far away. He looked up at Sherlock in horror, but the Vulcan was still staring at him as though frozen as their world shook around them. "John," he whispered after a moment, his fingers clamping down on John's hand.

It wasn't like any of the other kisses they had shared; warm and enveloping,

John cried, making a sweeping gesture with one arm as though dramatically entering the room.
The speaker crackled. "Of course we're here." It was the Doctor's voice, not Fitzgerald's. "Everything all right down there?"
the detective relented, waving a hand to emphasise the request.
John shrugged resignedly. "I wanted this to go on for as long as possible so we could keep role-playing. Every time someone else was murdered my heart leapt - I was
For a long moment after the last chord had been struck the two of them stood there, holding hands in front of them, each unwilling to let go. Sherlock's fingers twitched slightly when John finally made to part them, and out of the corner of his eye while making as though to pay the musician he saw the detective's hand stay a moment even after his own had left it, curling sadly into a fist as though Sherlock was struggling to hold onto the moment.
It made Sherlock feel queasy; he wasn't even sure that it was because of the intimacy that hadn't yet been earned, wasn't sure whether he would like it even if it were him and John in real life, just the two of them with no pretences. John's tongue swept through his mouth like rain in summer, cleansing him, lighting up his erogenous zones until every inch of his body tingled.
"Violently dominant bordering on abusive?" Lestrade clarified. Sherlock gave him a sharp nod as he scanned the rest of the man's body, picking up a million details about his life and habits but nothing else useful to the case. "Forensics are on their way," he mentioned after a few more minutes of Sherlock's silence. "I'm heading back to the Yard, they can fill me in later. Try not to annoy them too much," the DI said wearily, giving Sherlock a stern look. "I'll go and take Charlotte home."
His heart is busy registering its interest at this fact when he reaches up slowly to make a gap in the curtains big enough for him to see through. He sees Milverton's bald spot as the man sits at the desk and bends over some papers. Then he sees the safe door behind him.
he said fondly,
"What a shame," he remarks idly.
Sherlock's hands stroked absently through Redbeard's fur as though he was using it to keep himself steady. The dog's tail thumped heavily against the floor. "I can't go out there," he said dully. "You saw them. I know my body's going into shock, that's why I came here."
"I never thought Crocker was his real name," Sherlock dismissed. "I doubt Green is, either. He visited me to ask about Lady Brackenstall, but he denied knowing Lady Carfax. I suspected he was lying: now we have proof." He glanced up at his elder brother distractedly. "You may want to have someone look into him," he suggested. "Since he seemed to want the women found I doubt he's worth my investigating, but I'd be interested to know who he really is." Mycroft simply arched a thin eyebrow, expressing disdain that his younger brother dared to suggest actions to him. Sherlock shrugged carelessly. "What did they say about the nature of Green's interactions with Lady Carfax?"
The detective frowned, acknowledging the point. "I didn't think there would be," he replied. "But someone will have seen her with Slessinger. Any more information on the people she associated with in Sussex could be useful. And that's information that even Lestrade will have been able to collect."

She pulled at the stat monitor until it was angled towards John. "Much better," she said, grinning tiredly. "I don't know what you did in there, but he stabilised a few minutes before those things left him. T'Penya helped to defend the rest of us in case they went for us, but they went for your office and then they sort of… blew up."
John's not stupid. He knows that Sherlock is denying John's help out of spite and pride – and perhaps the tiniest bit of misplaced guilt over his outburst – to prove to him that he really can cope without John telling him to eat, that he really can look after himself. Right now, his flatmate seems determined to deny himself food until the case is over. John sighs; if Sherlock doesn't want his help, he's going to give a bloody good attempt at not giving it. Sherlock can starve himself until he passes out before John tries to force him to eat.
John wonders if he's quoting

John gave Will one last tiny grin, letting the joy of performing with Sherlock overtake him once more.
Also, my humblest apologies for both the wait and the shortness of this chapter. I reckon as long as I do the next one fairly quickly you'll forgive me, though... *winks*
Carl Powers stepped aside, but the smirk on his face wasn't a nice one. John frowned at him. "You'll find out," he said, with a theatrical mysterious air that somehow gave him the most intelligent voice John had ever heard him use. "That boy isn't normal."
He wondered whether Sherlock meant he didn't mind being surprised in performance, or didn't mind John kissing him - or maybe the two were the same thing to him, and the kiss had been nothing but a tactical stage action.
The words sandwich him between a rock and something else hard, and he stares at the profile of Sherlock's face, silhouetted by the sunlight from the window and tainted by the flickering reds of the telly. "I had a theory, but I was wrong," Sherlock elaborates after the on-screen tension has died down a bit. "Dimmock was right. I can't prove it yet, but he's dead, I'm sure of it."
He wanted to pace, but the Doctor had said

"No, we didn't," John told him, massaging the spot on his back the best he could but not moving from where he had landed, warm against the broad expanse of the detective's chest. "I overreacted to your delivery of that line. We'll talk to Will about it later and work something -"

John raised an eyebrow at him.
Photocopiers had always confused him, but this one was so user-unfriendly it had to be Japanese. He stared at it for a good ten minutes before he figured out that the top half of the machine lifted up to reveal the glass of the copier. From there there were only a million buttons that could be the right one.
He snarled the automatic reply instead. "
John stopped. "Sorry," he said, allowing the bewilderment to show in his voice as though hinting that his friend's response had been rudely abrupt.
"I'm waiting for an email from a man I met on a case last year about clients of his matching the victim's description," Sherlock replied. "I'll need it back immediately if that comes in." He lifted his feet nonetheless for John to get up and retrieve the laptop from the desk. John allowed him to lift his feet back onto his denim-clad thighs with a wry grin when he sat down, promptly resting the laptop on Sherlock's ankles and wriggling into a more comfortable position in his seat. Sherlock could see the home screen of his blog reflected in the mirror on the mantelpiece.
I whip out my phone – there's no signal – and wander around frantically until I find a pocket of service with which to access the internet and find an old Swedish folk-story about a boy whose mother was kidnapped by the sun – the boy had to climb the tiers of the rainbow, at each colour confronted with 'trials' to try and scare him away, to rescue his mother.

"I want to see her," Charlotte said instantly.
"What do you want?" John asked him. He would have died for the taller man hours after they had first met: perhaps that ought to have been his first clue. Thinking about having this kind of intimacy with him was like lifting a floodgate in his mind, allowing himself to consider something he'd always shut out of his thoughts before it could take conscious hold.
And the Athenian woman by his side:
Only it really hurt.
Sherlock smiled again. "Of course," he replied. "I'll only say that I am very definitely not like him."

The former Slytherin looked at him as though this was the most ridiculous idea he had ever heard. "What?"

, perhaps ? If you still want to work on character with me, that is," he added, suddenly looking uncertain.
Sherlock smiled the same shy smile John had seen every time he was paid a compliment. "Careful, you'll be stuck with everything I have, forever," he said quietly. It sounded like a joke, but John could see the fear of rejection behind his green-grey eyes; he reached out and stroked the boy's cheekbone tenderly.

Bill stood up abruptly, brushing imaginary dust or crumbs from his pullover. "That's okay," he said soothingly. "But make sure you think about it."
He grins, realises he might look slightly lecherous, and tries to stop. "Course not. You don't toss and turn or snore or cuddle, do you?"

they could be intrinsically linked and the connection between them could be the key to the entire case," Sherlock rejoined, throwing John a slightly betrayed glare. "Or neither. We can't take the chance."
Sherlock grinned. "Depends on the truth ," he replied casually. "My guess would be that he was her lover, and he killed Brackenstall to protect her. Arresting them both for that would hardly be

"Blow to the back of the head," Sherlock muttered, still bent close to the carpet. "He was hit while he was standing up, you can tell by the way the blood has spread. Does that fit with Lady Brackenstall's account?"
, he thought to himself, glancing over at where a stage-hand was helping Tobias back into costume.
he admitted.
"I do masturbate, John. It's a necessary evil. Every once in a while the human body must release tension."
Sherlock smiled tightly at the boy. "Thank you," he said.
Sherlock blinked. "Of course," he agreed. In fact, he should have been able to come up with that on his own. The fact that so much of his surrounding was unfamiliar, that there was

Sherlock looked at him. "What?"
that Sherlock would recognise from twenty feet away with his back turned. John took advantage of their closeness to lick the length of Sherlock's neck.
A nod of the head is due here to my flatmate and best friend, Joseph. Love you.
He'd thought about it, too. Of course he had, his best friend looking like he did - it wasn't like there were a lot of opportunities to release that kind of tension on a five-year assignment with the same crew. He'd be a fool to pretend he hadn't caught himself fantasising about Sherlock's lips or his long-fingered hands or his unnaturally perfect curls, and realistically, if John were to build his own castle for the wanderings of his mind there might be a room just like this one in it, though perhaps with a stronger lock on the door.
He was standing in a field of dry grass, under a pale sky streaked with cloud.
John blinked. "That's brilliant," he said eagerly. Sherlock frowned at him as though he'd never been interrupted before. He pressed his lips together. "Sorry," he apologised.
John frowned at him. "Are Carl Powers' shoes of personal interest to you?" he asked.
Sherlock hummed agreement. "It can also be incredibly irritating if other actors get the wrong idea from their lines. Often, that far in, it is too late for simpler men to change their readings."

John frowned. "How do you figure that?" he asked.
When Mycroft is gone, Sherlock turns to John, frowning. "You usually make an effort to be civil with Mycroft," he says accusingly.
The woman smiled fondly at him. "Of course, I'll leave the office open for you. Now; today we focus our study back to the human side of evolution. You should all have a basic understanding of the process – humans, as everyone knows, are closely related to apes, and from there…"

Sherlock gave John one of his calculating looks. "Your sister," he deduced, not even bothering to frame it like a question.

chuffed you could make it out here for us, Mister Holmes," he says genially. "And Doctor Watson, of course – love the blog."
Lestrade smiled sadly. "She wasn't there," he explained. Billy looked up at Sherlock, who avoided his gaze in something that was almost shame. "We'll send someone else later this afternoon, but it's unlikely he's keeping her elsewhere. I've no doubt he was involved with the kidnappings at some stage, but we can't prove it if he's not currently in possession of either of them."
"Foul play, you think?" Lestrade ventured, not looking terribly excited. John thought back to what Sherlock had said the previous day about these things becoming less interesting when you do them as a paid occupation: he supposed that this case becoming more than a simple burglary gone wrong might be exciting for Sherlock, but for the Constable it only meant more trouble.
God, that voice sounded so far away. But it was Bill's voice, he could see the redhead standing at the foot of his bed, looking terrified and nauseated and watching with extreme concern someone who was standing behind his bed. John supposed they must be holding some sort of needle. Or a scalpel. Or any sort of medical implement, really, Bill had always been a bit squeamish.
John shrugged, taking another sip of tea. "Also, you've just come straight from your DADA NEWT. All your defensive magic is still in your head. I'd forgotten everything I knew about everything not related to Healing, I had to learn it all over again."
was someone else. He hitched his seductive smile back onto his face as John pulled back again to look him in the eyes. "God, you're beautiful," the doctor rumbled, and Sherlock affected a shy look.
He wasn't sure if that was acceptable, to imply so openly that he stay, but the detective only smiled. "Perhaps," he agreed, pressing another quick kiss to John's lips and propelling himself to his feet.
, John wanted to protest. But the part of his mind that was beginning to sound like Sherlock rebutted the argument straight away. He would have, but then he would have resented Sherlock for taking away his dream, and it wouldn't have lasted anyway.
"Good morning – oh, bollocks. What was that?"

John smiled half-heartedly. Crocker lingered for a further uncomfortable moment, then he patted down his waistcoat and left the room.
Lestrade opened the door with bleary eyes after the third time Sherlock almost banged the door down. "What do you want, Sherlock?" the older man asked, sounding like this wasn't the first time the detective had woken him up with the sunrise.
It had been dark when they had dragged the unconscious thief back to the Constable's residence, and John had to admit he had no idea where that had been relative to anything else. He let the detective lead him down another side-street, the silence companionable, like each of them were smiling quietly to themselves in contentment. John let his thoughts turn to Will again, the way he seemed torn between pushing John and Sherlock together and trying to keep them apart.
"No, sir," she said, eliciting relieved gasps from the three of them. "They have had candles burning in the front room all night, Master Holmes, but no-one has entered or left the house since you knocked on their door yesterday morning." Billy nodded, although he looked a little bleary. John supposed they must have set shifts for watching the door and sleeping.
From the floor, he hears the distinctive sound of a consulting detective chuckling. "You put that there on purpose, didn't you, you git," he grumbles, getting up.
His fingers, thicker than he was used to, grazed over the tight furl of John's hole, drawing a startled gasp from his throat, one that sounded exactly like the gasp John made whenever Sherlock stole food out of his hands on its way to his mouth. He couldn't resist pushing in, just a little, John's come slicking the way of his fingers, the stretch echoing pleasurably through his groin. His other hand pushed against his penis, his eyes fixed on John's in the mirror. The Keeper's blue eyes bored into his as he worked his finger deeper,
"I'm sorry that wasn't as interesting as you thought," John said as they stepped out of the house and into the cold.
He shrugged off the audience member who was still holding onto one of his arms with a false smile and stepped hopefully towards Sherlock, who retreated from him in disgust.
The artist shook John's and Sherlock's hands and dipped a quick bow to Donovan. To John's surprise, he looked neither shocked nor offended at her presence. "I've heard of you, of course, Master Holmes," he said brightly. "Helped a friend of mine out with the kidnapping of his aunt. Turned out she'd run off with the local innkeep, can't believe he didn't guess it. Bloody good job." When he reached John, he frowned and said, "Have I seen you somewhere before, Master Watson?"
Sherlock smiled tightly, another cursory, polite, superficial smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Good," he said. "And perhaps we could rehearse

He didn't expect him to give in straight away. There would be some sort of moral discussion first. But it was a start.
"Yes," Sherlock replied truthfully. "I know several people who I believe fit that description." Molly, for example, seemed to constantly set her sights on men who wouldn't give her what she deserved, including Sherlock himself. He'd even thought that John could do a lot better than the vapid, self-absorbed women he seemed to attract, but he'd largely dismissed that opinion as biased by jealousy.

Sherlock removed the crime-scene photographs. "Had he been in recently?" he asked, watching Eliza closely.
John's breath catches. "If you don't go he'll know you're avoiding him. Isn't that worse? Sherlock, this isn't something you should be ashamed of. It's as much my fault as yours. We knew it was a risk, but we did it anyway. It didn't work. That's

Sherlock lifted an elegant eyebrow. "Where did she keep her jewellery?" he redirected with sugary politeness. John flushed slightly at the unspoken rebuke.

to be in top physical condition anymore, but he hadn't quite lost the habit of rigorous exercising, and so the youth's shorter, less fit legs couldn't carry him as fast as John's and he caught up with him two doors before John's front door.
. Although, he reasoned to himself as he left the stage, this was hardly the same production as the one of the previous afternoon.
"You've heard of him?" John asked in surprise.
"Encore!" the man called. "Give us a scene, o most royal of royals!"
"Oh, John," he says fondly, patting him on the arm. "If you came with me on
John nods in a somewhat scathing way that makes the corners of Sherlock's mouth turn up slightly. "Right, well, if we could –"
; accordingly, he slumped where he stood into the diminutive, threatening posture of the character he had finished playing mere months ago, raising one eyebrow curiously at the detective.
, the Doctor had spat out like a curse as he directed Sherlock's hands to them) tingling under Sherlock's palms, the rock of movement was easy to brace against, more like the rolling deck of a cruise liner than the shudder of an earthquake simulator. Sherlock smirked at the alien around the central column. The Doctor rolled his eyes, but grinned back as they settled with the same asthmatic sound they'd made on their last landing.
John cleans himself up without moving, a bone-deep weariness consuming him. He'll deal with this – and with Sherlock – in the morning.
" he cried angrily once the lovers had had their quarrel and gone their separate ways - Hermia offstage, Demetrius laying himself down to sleep before them. "
"Funny thing, isn't it?" Sherlock says suddenly, his gaze directed resolutely out to sea.
he asked quietly.
It makes a stab of sadness catch at John's heart that Sherlock really has no idea. "Sometimes," he agrees. "But most of the time it feels like…" he pauses to consider, to give Sherlock the most honest approximation. "It's what I always imagined flying would feel like. It's exciting, there's adrenaline, and it's… it makes you feel alive."
Sherlock put down his mug. "All right, Mycroft: I'll make sure I get the train if you promise not to spy on me all year."

"Oh, I

Sorry for the delay. And the swearing (there's a bit). And the possibility of typos, considering I wrote most of this chapter with my grandmother's cat on my keyboard and she still hasn't let me on my computer alone.
Billy scratched his neck idly. "Oh, yeah," he said, like he had simply forgotten to mention it. "Few years older than me. Floppy sort of hair. Dark. Looked a bit pathetic, shaking a little. Think I'd seen him somewhere before, but I can't place him."
After a minute or so, Sherlock starts to take control, pushing John backwards slightly. Grinning into the kiss, John pulls away from Sherlock's lips to kiss and suck a line down his neck. The detective groans, startlingly loud in the empty room. John breaks away to listen to the noise in wonderment:
For the tiniest of split seconds, he considered it, considered parting his lips and saying
Sherlock rounded on him, seemingly having had enough of not knowing what was going on.
The silence sits in the space between them like a bad scone in an empty stomach. John sits down in his armchair, facing the detective, trying not to say anything else, to let him collect his own thoughts.
"I don't think there's anything in this palace I could have kept from you forever," the xenobiologist said softly. "I suppose a part of me wanted you to see that room."
Sherlock lets out a growl of frustration, that almost sounds like his usual
her. Zipping his heavy coat to avoid the November winds, he set off down the street.
things he's said to his friend come back to him, like the time he tried to feed Sherlock a sandwich piece by piece by hand while the detective was hunched over a microscope, speaking in that daft tone parents use on children in an effort to either make him laugh and realise how ridiculous he was being, or eat the sandwich to make him shut up. He'd never even considered that Sherlock might feel so…
Where is he waiting?
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
John shared a look with Sherlock; evidently the butler still wasn't entirely happy with them wandering around the house unsupervised, and his pointed look at Donovan was just as clear. With Lestrade in tow and his assistant dispatched, he led them down a long corridor and up a flight of stairs before holding open the door to what was apparently Lady Brackenstall's bedchamber. John saw Sherlock's argument immediately - this room was practically at the opposite end of the house from the drawing room. Anyone coming through the house had to pass by several rooms through which John could glimpse shelves of presumably-antique trinkets and a cupboard housing the family's silverware; surely the cutlery in particular would be just as easy to carry as pieces of jewellery.
"I'm so jealous of you," he voiced eventually. "You always knew who you wanted. There's only ever been one person and you two have loved each other for the better part of your lives."
Julien smirked. The doctor's automatic assumption that Julien was
Sherlock smiled brightly. "Oh, look," he mimicked. "It's…" he stopped in mock-puzzlement. "What is it again? I'm usually good with names, but yours continues to escape me." The boy scowled, but didn't reply, so Sherlock tutted and pushed him aside. "I suggest you abandon the plan you were forming, too," he threw back airily. "I think you'll find it rather difficult to sleep with
Aaand a tip of the hat, to continue the theme, for my dear Sophie.
And in the meantime, he may as well go over the murder with John.
He tilted his hips up until their erections were aligned again, earning a tiny hitch of breath from the doctor. Surely John's response to all of this was more than just physical stimulation?
But Bill was no longer listening; his fervent green eyes had fixed on the door, and his whole body had suddenly become still. John looked around wildly. "Oh, John," Bill breathed. "It's
Mycroft's lips tighten into a thin hard line. "Ah," he says shortly. "Yes, that does throw a spanner in the works."
He shouted, and his voice was terrible – Sherlock could almost feel the floor trembling as though his words were a thunderstorm. He took that as a cue, spinning the dials on the lights as high as they would go and then switching on the sonic screwdriver on and pointing it at them, throwing a hand over his eyes and turning his face away in time to see Hannah and Marchbanks do the same.
made Sherlock do that.
John laughed incredulously. "I could never want to hurt you," he assured the younger boy.
The doctor laughed. "I'm getting old and riddled with battle-scars," he replied, but he blushed and shifted self-consciously anyway.
Julien smiled back. He would do nicely.

He gestures first towards the door, then towards the safe, hoping his meaning is clear.
. If he really is anything like me, he'll keep you around because you treat him like he's special, instead of treating him like he's foreign."
In the meantime, Sherlock rolled onto his side to look at John, still flat on his back and breathing to the ceiling. He swept his gaze down the doctor's body, smiling at the tan lines so defined at his wrists and neck it almost looked as though he was still wearing a shirt. He had always imagined John's body to be golden brown, but once the tan faded it was actually rather pale. Sherlock put out a hand and rested it, fingers splayed, over John's belly. He knew he was pale, but it was impossible to avoid a slight tan on the hands, and his hands were darker than John's stomach.
Sherlock smiled; he'd known John would agree, even though pretending to pick each other up at a bar definitely wasn't something that John's idea of 'normal flatmates' did. He brought up this notion of 'normal' when he was angry with Sherlock, but he never seemed to adhere to it himself. He was pretty sure 'normal flatmates' didn't sit quite as close to one another on the sofa in the evenings as they did, or have quite so few boundaries when it came to sharing the bathroom. Sherlock himself didn't particularly care whether John saw him urinating or showering, and he attributed the doctor's corresponding lack of shyness to his time in the army and to his medical disregard for nudity. "Don't bother, we'll do it in the kitchen," he replied. "They were standing at the bar; the kitchen counter's the closest thing we have."
For a moment, neither of them spoke, and the atmosphere quickly became thick with tension and the sound of John's still-laboured breathing. Sherlock realised quickly that the tangible awkwardness of the moment would most likely
," he opened, setting the laptop and his untouched cup of tea on the kitchen counter between them. John turned up his chin in that stoic way he had when he had set his mind on doing something. "Suggests that she'd already picked him out from the crowd – maybe she followed him there, or maybe he just happened to make the wrong gesture at the wrong time. Either way, it's hardly the behaviour of a full-time submissive."
He felt Sherlock's mouth curve upwards into a smile, but the detective obliged; the hand steadying the base of his penis tightened and his mouth advanced,
. He's never looked at it as impressive before.
Surprised, Julien inclined his head and sat down lightly behind his desk. "Please take a seat, Doctor Watson."
He hadn't really thought about either;
Adler cleared her throat once more as Sherlock craned his neck to see the dust on the floor. "I expect a full report from the both of you tomorrow when you've rested a little. Commander Holmes, you are relieved of duty for the rest of the week. Doctor Watson, I'll assess your fitness for duty after receiving your report."
"I'm really sorry," Grieg said softly. "Sometimes people are like that."
This isn't really where I'd imagined I'd be tonight, in a teppanyaki restaurant surrounded by drunk ex-military men and their giggly, chatty spouses.
he admitted.
"More," he mumbled into Grieg's neck, sliding his body down the teacher's, letting his lips catch on the tiny exposed bits of skin and breathing in the whimpers and soft sounds he was drawing out of the taller man until his knees hit the floor.
Sherlock lifts a hand to accept the pills and the glass, so John goes to remove his hand from the detective's hair; a spidery-fingered hand shoots up to keep it there. "Please," Sherlock murmurs. "Please don't stop."
He didn't try to argue when the Classics teacher placed him reverently on the bed and immediately kissed his way underneath Sherlock's baggy t-shirt, the fabric stretching over his head so that Sherlock couldn't find purchase in his hair until it re-emerged and worked its way instead into his equally loose-fitting bottoms.
Julien nodded sharply, gave his secretary a dismissive gesture to continue and left the room.
John lunged forwards and kissed him.
"You heard me," Sherlock said, not without a touch of grudging amusement.
"Oh, is that today?" Vienna asked disinterestedly. "Well, Tom will drive you there. Do try not to get into any trouble this year, won't you, Sherlock?"
"Not us, Gandalf. You, at least, people will remember."
Inside the cell, Humphrey Boone sits slumped against a corner, asleep. His entire body is covered in filth and a huge gash rends the grimy skin of his ugly face. A clown-like mop of red hair assaults the grey of the wall. Sherlock gestures dramatically for quiet. This time, John can't stop the giggle ripping gently out of his throat. The detective glares at him, folding his arms crossly over his chest. He clears his throat. "Sorry. It's just – you would have made an incredible magician."
The young olive-skinned woman who opened the door was not dressed like a servant; John raised an eyebrow at her white shirt and dark breeches. She raised a rudely defiant eyebrow back at him before her eyes shifted to Sherlock and her face fell into a disapproving expression.
Lady Brackenstall.
John started in surprise. "That's… fine," he replied, patting Sherlock's hand where it still lay on his upper arm. "I meant it all." The detective smiled weakly. Someone coughed close by: John looked around to see the older man playing Bottom standing at the other stage door, his donkey's head clamped under one arm. "You'd better go set, then," John pointed out, indicating the man.
" he continued, slowly easing himself onto one knee and offering Sherlock the sword,
he asked.
"Kirsty," she choked out after a moment.
John smiled warmly at her and confided his secret. "I had an

"I'd do anything for Charlotte," Amy said fiercely, staring at first Sherlock, then Lestrade as though daring them to challenge her. "I'd kill for her." Sherlock beat the amused smirk off his face, but the woman seemed to realise the irony in the statement herself. "I think I've proven that now," she said with a tiny smile. "I
He ran his fingers over the starburst lump of scar tissue on John's left shoulder, down over his nipples towards the white line from a teenaged appendectomy. John shivered and rolled towards him, his rough surgeon's hand cupping Sherlock's jaw and tugging his mouth in for a deep, languid kiss. Sherlock moved his hand down to John's hip and pulled their entire bodies together, warm and damp with cooling sweat.
His own shadow, in the dull lights from the observation box, twitched convulsively. Sherlock wondered what the Vashta Nerada looked like when it was already dark – ordinary shadows couldn't exist without light at all. At the very least, it must be unnerving. Or perhaps they thrived in it.
His passports were there, nestled between photographs and bank notes and the other memorabilia he had managed to salvage from the flat: the picture Mrs Hudson had snuck on them one Christmas where Sherlock was leaning over John's shoulder to read the card Molly had sent and the both of them were smiling, unaware of being watched, a perfect moment Sherlock kept in his mind for the bitterest of the cold nights. He looked like a different person in his passport photos, and the name
all the time, when he thought about it. "All right," he said slowly. "What is it?"
The detective tipped his head to one side, clearly considering it. "Perhaps you're right," he mused.
. Why was that sticking in his mind?
Sherlock sniffed. "How can they? They're not even genetically the same species as I am."
, as though he needed John to breathe. He'd never imagined that the half-Vulcan officer would want him so passionately: when he had allowed himself to imagine it he'd always thought that Sherlock would be slow and controlled like he was in everything else, almost unbearably teasing and sensual.
to make him feel like this, and knowing that his efforts on them were also working… it was intoxicating.
John and Sherlock stare at the man for a moment. John's buzzing with curiosity; he wishes, now, that Sherlock had sworn to secrecy when Lady Trelawney-Hope visited. He's willing to bet Sherlock's wishing that too. After a while, Sherlock draws in a sharp breath and seems to snap out of deep reflection, stirring in his seat. "I see. And nobody at all had access to this safe except for you and your wife?"
Sherlock sighed. "All right. What if - "
The courtyard was bare, grey stone on all sides. He had expected something of the world to become less real, more the slightly distorted fairytale of his own dreams, but Sherlock's mind was crystal-clear and sharp on the eye, distressingly accurate down to the lichen growing between the cobblestones on the ground.
I…" And then he was there, so suddenly it was almost unexpected, over the edge and down the cliff face, and Julien's hand was stroking up his thigh even as he sucked and licked the way through Sherlock's orgasm.
Sherlock lifts his eyes skyward. "Oh, joy."
"How on Earth did Tobias get mixed up in this?" John asked, not really expecting a reply. How could Sherlock know?
came the lightening-fast reply.
Something moved in his peripheral vision; reflexively, Sherlock stepped away from it. He looked guiltily around to see if anyone had noticed the movement when he realised that he had jumped at the shadow of the nearest tree. The Doctor gave him a sideways glance, but didn't comment. Sherlock tried to force himself to relax; there was something about this artificial forest and its artificial light that set his teeth on edge.
The doctor nods slowly. He hadn't wanted to discuss his steadily marching line of girlfriends, but he supposes that now he may as well run with it. "There
"Why the hell not?" he presses. "Your body enjoyed it. It's good to let your body take over every now and then. Like eating and sleeping." Sherlock's face contorts into an expression of distaste and he takes a breath to say
"Yeah. Bill made some sort of joke about Jim having to sit on my knee, so we should probably try to avoid that." She giggled. "Although, I'd rather Jim than Bill. At least Jim doesn't
"Shh," John susurrated, kissing him into silence while he leaned over the bed in search of something to tie Sherlock's hands up with. "Pleasing you will give me pleasure." He kissed him again, then frowned. "The tape?" he asked, raising an eyebrow at the empty bedside table.
" John yelled, closing his mouth in panic as soon as he had control of it again, taking quick, shallow breaths of terror. Sherlock stilled instantly, staring at him, clearly holding his breath.
It felt like forever before Julien's hips stilled and his hands fell away from Sherlock's hair, releasing him. He pulled off and swallowed a few times, grimacing at the burn in his throat. He understood what Julien had meant; it wasn't an

She looked up at him and smiled shakily. "Stewart's murder was on the news. I was at home in the flat - Amy was cooking. She dropped something and I was too stupid with shock to help her clean it up. She kept trying to say things to comfort me, but she didn't like Stewart so I knew she didn't mean them. That's why I left the flat. And then Charlie - I was at work. Someone in my cubicle found out and the whole office was talking about it. It sounds awful, but I was kind of… pleased. I've already said he was horrible. I think I said something terrible, like good riddance or something."

John waved him away with feigned unconcern.
"Why didn't you?" John asked, feeling slightly indignant. They could have had this for

I shrug. "I'll think of something." Lady Trelawney-Hope stumbles back into the room with the safe-box, a silver key dangling from her fingertips. "Open it, quickly." I shift the contents of the box around a bit – other papers and letters and two USB keys rattle around – and then slip the blue envelope near the bottom of the pile so that it isn't visible from the top. "All right. Now go and put it back – exactly as you found it."
Sherlock looked around the room again and pocketed the photograph on the bedside table of Stephens and his ex. "No," he said briskly, ignoring Donovan's indignant shout at his appropriation of evidence. "Text me if the interviews find anything, and I'll let you know if we get anything from our inquiries this afternoon. If he's actually avoiding us for a reason I'll need you."
The dark-haired boy stepped closer. "Perhaps." Sherlock tried to mimic his confident posture, act as though he wasn't completely out of his depth here. Weren't they supposed to be on an equal footing here? Neither of them had any experience. Julien didn't
"Yeah," the DI replied. There was a funny sort of background noise on the other end of the phone; Sherlock guessed that he was calling from a police car. "Look, we just dropped Charlotte off, walked her right to the door, like we said - she did know Pearson, by the way, she says he was the man from the bar who gave her the bruises."
When the skinny, oily little man John recognises from an earlier meeting to be Milverton throws the door open and wanders fitfully into the room, scowling and muttering to himself, his heart stops as well and he wonders disconnectedly what would happen to Sherlock if he dropped dead back here.
Shakespeare tapped John gently on the shoulder as he came up behind them in the line for the stage door, winking cheerfully at his linked arms with Sherlock. The playwright looked absolutely elated at how the play had gone. John grinned back. "It's fun," John told the detective with an air of finality. "Enjoy it."
The noise grew and swelled and intensified until the two of them trembled with it, burying their faces deeper in each other's shoulders to shut off their ears to it. John could feel Sherlock's heart rate speeding dangerously higher than his already frightening base rate, his arms trembling from the strength with which they were clutching John to him, his jaw almost cracking from the way he was clenching his teeth. "Sherlock," he said quickly, stroking a hand through his hair to try and calm him down. "It's all right, I'm here, you're okay," he lied soothingly.
He kept his head down, unable to even stop and fake a smile, certainly unable to show Angelo that his beloved lodger may have been hurt. His throat tight with shame, John pushed past an early morning diner and out into the cold.
was so loud it made the floor shake. Sherlock heard it coming and grabbed onto the desk in front of him; several of the people milling about the bank looking vaguely terrified were less lucky and ended up on the ground. The Doctor stood stock still, staring at the lines of code on the screen in shock.
, and you'll get shot. It's always the little chances that end up happening."
Bill stepped forwards as John felt his face turning red, but before either of them could do anything definitive a tiny hand on John's shoulder stopped him. Sophia stood behind them, a towel clutched around her shoulders as she shivered in the breeze. John shucked his jumper immediately and offered it to her. She took it gratefully.
He couldn't say anything, of course. John quite happily told Sherlock the sordid details of his every crush, all of them female and none of them anything remotely like
The fantasy shattered, Sherlock's hand gripping himself in shock even as his legs curled up to hide himself from his flatmate, standing at the door, his eyes pointedly fixed on the floor. "Sorry!" John gasped. "I heard the noise and I thought you might be hurt…"
The science officer snorted lightly. "Not while you're in it," he replied. "I'm still unconscious. You need to break the meld, and I want to see what happened to the creatures when they left me. Then I will rest for as long as you want, doctor."
I swallow and try to look nonchalant, confident. "Is that likely to happen, John?" I try to make it sound rhetorical, but a part of me really wants him to answer.
to you about the relationship she's been holding behind your back and evicted you from your own flat, or that you've been staying with your younger sister for the past two days."
Sherlock glanced at John, one side of his mouth quirking up. "I'm certain he does," he said solemnly. "Well, John, we had best let Mycroft know we have recovered it."
lip, thinner than his own, tasting of John's sweat and not Sherlock's – and threw his head back and groaned one last time in John's voice, pleasure shaking along all of John's muscles and turning his vision white.
John stared down at the decomposing woman, feeling sick. Behind him he could hear Lestrade dully attempting to smooth things over for them.
He lifted his finger from the PA system, clicking it off and turning to Sherlock, pulling the sonic screwdriver out of an inside pocket of his jacket and tossing it to him. "Setting thirty-seven," he said softly. "That'll boost the lights. Try not to look into the forest while you're doing it. That goes for all of you," he directed to Marchbanks and Hannah. "Light bright enough to hurt the Vashta Nerada will hurt you, as well."
John holds back the smile. "What
"I did," he replied brightly, half-turning back to John Watson as he shrugged his coat on as though this, the invitation, the proposition, had been his plan all along. "I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for, now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just returned from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap." The difficult leap, he thought wryly to himself, was what came afterwards, ignoring the doctor's question about Afghanistan: "I've got my eye on a little place in central London; together we ought to be able to afford it. We'll meet there tomorrow, say, seven o'clock?" He tossed the doctor another smile, wrapping his scarf around his neck, preparing for a hasty exit so he could drop the air of complete composure. "Sorry, I've got to dash – I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary."

way to deal with the way that made his chest hurt. "What you said, after – just spending some time together, I want that. And obviously I want what we did before, only without… me leaving afterwards."
Touched speechless, John takes Sherlock's head in his hands and holds it to his chest. "I love you, Sherlock. So much."
By the time John gets there the DI has already ordered and received two beers and holed himself up in a booth at the back of the pub. He smiles gratefully at his friend as Lestrade slides a Budweiser Classic across the table to him.
The redhead opened his mouth to say something indignant at his companions' complete ignorance of his contribution, but McAuliffe looked up and beat him to it. "Murray! Watson!"
Sherlock smiled. "Not until tomorrow," he replied quietly, leaning forward so that John could hear him over the music. He let John see him breathe in deeply when he was there. The doctor still smelled of asphalt and synthetic leather from the cab, undercut with just a hint of the sweat that Sherlock could see dampening his skin, the smell of
Will frowned. "Did you make a good impression?" he asked sternly.
. When he first began to contemplate the idea of being attracted to John in that way he'd shut himself in his bedroom and spent almost an hour just lying there, idly fondling himself while imagining his flatmate in all manner of sexual situations. He'd almost given up on the idea – not finding any of his lurid imaging particularly arousing – when the memory of John reading the paper had drifted into his head. Just reading the paper, the tiny creases Sherlock could map exactly over his forehead as he frowned at something Afghani, one browned index finger stroking over his lips.
"I don't know, but they must be keeping Lady Brackenstall somewhere," Sherlock replied thoughtfully. "Once we have people watching the house, if she's not there herself it should be simple to follow him to wherever he is keeping her."
Bemused by the younger boy's embarrassment, John didn't push the subject. Sherlock had already opened up more than he'd ever done before; if he got too embarrassed he might just clam up for the rest of the evening. "Of course I would have," he dismissed, but he bit into the Cauldron anyway. "I wasn't about to just leave you on my doorstep."
He sat back on his heels, opening his mouth, taking a deep breath to say something –
Slowly, he loosened his hold on John and attempted to stand on his own feet, swaying slightly. John smiled at him. "This doctor is recommending bedrest," he said firmly, and then frowned. "Can you get rest inside your own head?"
"An address," the detective supplied. "London's homeless are infinitely useful. Certain of the city's Constables have grown used to the idea that if they let the street children know that they are looking for me, I will get the message within the hour. In this case, Constable Lestrade put out the word and the address at which he requires my help with a murder case."
hated the word; anyone using it in the army had used it once and once only. His flatmate looks up at him, surprised at the anger in his voice. "One day, I am going to start going around and punching everyone who calls you that, because you're not. They're just scared. You know, they called Janet Frame a freak, too."
against him, hot and throbbing, and wasn't the human erection a marvellous thing, so soft and hard at the same time? John's good arm was trembling beside Sherlock's head with the effort of holding him up and little drops of sweat were forming on the bridge of his nose, and Sherlock couldn't hold it; he threw his head back and pulled John closer with the hand that wasn't clenched tightly around their pricks and cried out to John, John,
Shakespeare grinned. "Sherlock Holmes," he said. "And please
Sherlock tossed his head like an impatient horse, dropping one hand to stroke the hair of his youngest fairy. Oddly, he glanced at Ben before turning back to the audience.
It was a funny thing, really, John mused as his friend said something flippant about the relative merits of solving crimes over rehearsing theatre. His army fellows had teased him when he first got involved with the Lord Chamberlain's Men, claiming that acting romantically beside boys dressed up as women made him either homosexual or perverted, but John had never considered himself either. His mind did get itself muddled up sometimes, but that was all: only that occasionally he spent so much time
He looks up at me. "Um, I don't know off the top of my head – Gloria Heian went missing in February, I remember her son reported it, he was distraught. They'd lived in England all their lives, but I think Gloria's mother migrated from Sweden or Norway or something like that. Why?"
Sherlock stopped as he was about to round the corner, turning back to face them with one eyebrow raised. "Are you coming, John?" he called back, a touch of a smile colouring his lips.
" Tom called out, sliding two fingers of whiskey across the bar in front of Sherlock and pouring out a similar glass for himself. With a clatter, a young woman tumbled down the stairs to the living quarters on top of the bar and straightened expectantly at the door with a wince at her own clumsiness. Sherlock relaxed slightly at her unruly shock of auburn hair. It had been dyed, but not recently; hints of darker brown were creeping out from her temples. "Did
Sherlock turned to the woman, straightening into a more commanding posture and looking her up and down with a predatory expression. She smiled demurely, shivering slightly at the attention. Definitely an established submissive, then, not someone who was only in the game for revenge. Especially since Henzell's language suggested she'd been a member of his club for quite some time. "Sherlock Holmes," he introduced, watching her face for any flicker of recognition or panic as he held out a hand.
John nodded half-heartedly, but he knew that not keeping his appointment with Sherlock Holmes was going to be one of the things he regretted most in his entire life, one of those things that kept popping up at inopportune moments to crush his self-esteem.
The detective paused for a moment, as though to allow John to catch up. John made a gesture for him to carry on.
The next time he woke up his throat was raw from screaming, but he couldn't stop.
he said after a moment.
have to admit that this is true, especially since this is the second time my knowledge has failed me where John's was perfectly adequate for the situation. "That's why I have you, isn't it?" I reply, not looking at him. His step falters, but he doesn't stop. He's touched – why? I didn't tell him anything he didn't already know, and I wouldn't consider what I just said to be exactly complimentary – but not surprised.
Mike Stamford frowned, and Sherlock could feel it boring into the top of his head as he refused to look up. "What's wrong with the landline?"
John rolled his eyes. "Shut up. She's not that bad. It's not like she's going to jump me the second I turn around."
The Doctor frowned. "Maybe not. But come on! Whole of time and space, wherever you want to go. Stars and planets and people you couldn't even imagine. Isn't that even a little bit tempting? What have you got here to leave behind?"

aloud, but the amused curl of his upper lip said it for him. "Lady Frances Carfax went missing from Sussex seven days ago," he began instead, ignoring the irritated press of his audience's lower lip that suggested Sherlock hadn't missed the nonverbal barb. "She lived in Whitehall but was vacationing in Sussex for three weeks when she dismissed her maid without warning. The maid immediately alerted a Justice of the Peace, who put out inquiries to her lodgings in Sussex only to find that she had checked out only three days into her vacation without giving notice as to her next destination. The maid is adamant that Lady Carfax would not have dismissed her in this manner unless something was wrong."
Frustrated, Sherlock squirmed again. "Joe,
John frowned. "Viola and Olivia?" he repeated questioningly. "I only know that it is a comedy - Will compared it to
He hands a mug of tea to the detective and places his own on the table beside his chair; to the woman, he smiles politely and asks, "Tea, Ms…?"
He did so; quickly and without ceremony, the older man whisked his school trousers and pants down to his knees and placed him back down on the desk. Sherlock shifted slightly; he was sitting on someone's essay.

Mr O'Doherty, tall, lanky and looming, rolled his eyes and caught sight of John. "Ah, Mr Watson!" he called. John flinched. He'd liked O'Doherty, but he got the feeling the teacher wouldn't be quite so amicable towards him since he'd dropped the course over the summer. He'd liked English, but it wasn't relatively important for his chosen career path. He smiled tentatively.
Sherlock swept out of the room without a word; John shook his head in mock disgust at his oldest friend's antics before he followed him.
"If that was
Sherlock gave him a wry look. "Yes, it is," he contradicted, "but that isn't all the evidence. You've seen the Randalls' work before, this isn't anything like it. Who
"Stop that," Sherlock snapped instead after the first few lines.

in such monsters as the Vashta Nerada.
Hannah breathed out shakily. "Will we still have to seal off the forest?" she asked, her voice trembling. Marchbanks put an arm around her, tugging her close, but his expression was curious.
Sherlock chuckles, too. "Really, John. Can you imagine Mycroft marrying the Cockney cleaning-woman of a cutthroat blackmailer?" The flood-gates John so carefully erected to stop the giggles collapse and the two men giggle a bit. Then John sobers up.
John remembered the tall, confident woman they had spoken to at the Brackenstall residence. He could easily imagine a lesser woman - less beautiful, less poised, less worldly - being caught up in adoration of her. It sounded jarringly familiar. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was absently tapping his long fingers against his lips. The detective hummed thoughtfully.
Kirsty shook her head. "No, everyone that's died has been in the forest. But we can't just

, this time; even after years of messing around with Will it had never been so comfortable, and he had never felt so unselfconscious. He stood with one shoulder resting on the door and squeezed himself lazily while he watched his lover kick his trousers off the edge of the bed and fix one hand around his growing arousal.
John entered ostentatiously, arms outstretched, seeing Sherlock and their attendants fan out behind him. The two players turned to him with an apprehensive look.
approached
Mycroft looks them up and down once, calculatingly, when they walk into the office. His eyes glitter, but he says nothing as they sit down side by side on the settee facing the desk. John follows Sherlock's lead, crossing his legs and waiting patiently for the elder Holmes to open the conversation.
Typically, the room was sparsely-furnished and unspeakably plain. Within hours, he knew, every teen on the floor would have papered their walls with posters of Bowie, Michael Jackson or Madonna, but he usually left his room as he found it. It was just a bedroom.
They have the compartment to themselves, and John is almost disappointed when the train stops in Brighton and they have to rejoin the realms of other people. Sherlock, too, surveys the mass of people running around the train station with undisguised disdain.
I've always liked the idea that the state of 221B Baker Street reflected the state of John's and my relationship. Well, not always – at the start, when his things were desperately attempting to find a place in and around my own, to look at things that way would have been less than flattering – but once the place began to find an odd sort of harmony in its dysfunctionality I began to see the poetry of such a metaphor.
The Doctor nodded. "Oh. The Great Hiatus. I see." Sherlock didn't understand what the Great Hiatus meant, but there was such sympathy in the Doctor's big green eyes that he smiled sadly at him anyway. "So how's the hunt going, then? How many more operatives, do you think?"
Sherlock glanced up at his flatmate through his eyelashes, burying his nose coquettishly in his teacup. John, who had slouched carelessly against the opposite counter, smiled widely back at him, the arrogant and indulgent smile of someone incredibly confident of their own attraction, so much so that he didn't believe he needed to move at all in order to pick up a woman. It wasn't a good look on John at all.
The taller boy rolled his eyes. "From the way you've described him he sounds like Jim. He probably makes more enemies than friends with his
image he was seeing now - a human representation of the Vulcan's consciousness, his own mind attempting to make sense of what was actually here - or Sherlock's own image, the way he wanted to see himself?

managed to keep holding on and supporting a fair amount of his weight; Sherlock would be tempted to consider alternate explanations if he were not routinely surprised by the things people were capable of in near-death situations. John had laughed and said something about someone called Doctor No when he had last mentioned it.
