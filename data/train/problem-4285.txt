“Nothing.” Dean just steps forward, falling back into step alongside Castiel as they turn and head down the main road, but out of the corner of his eye Castiel can see the corner of Dean’s mouth pull up in a proper smile. Cas doesn’t know what it is he’s doing to keep making Dean smile and laugh, but whatever blessing it is, he fervently hopes it never leaves him.
“Green,” Castiel whispers, watching a flare of rich pine swirl lazily through the lines wrapped around his wrist. So there really was something to his years of absent daydreaming. He still has no idea how
Most of the time, Castiel is just glad Naomi doesn’t have a TV in the house. Between that and the adblocker he’s put on his browser, he’s at least got a little respite from the soulmate overload when he’s home. Tucked up under his duvet in the middle of the night, secluded from the relentless media barrage, he can run his fingers over the fine lines of his mark and imagine what a soul bond
with women. Men, for so long it was always. Not. I had to. I didn’t get to.” He stops. Gulps down the nausea.
It’s foreign in his heart, strange and new on the back of his tongue, and for a moment he feels like there’s a second person under his skin with him.
Castiel’s just reaching out to touch the arm of the bench when his heart skips and heat shivers through him. The colours of his mark blossom in vivid green and he realises.
“You sure this is going to help you rebuild the cosmic warding? Cause this book looks like a fuckin’ slog, man.”
Dean’s eyes widen instantly at the sight of it. He sucks in a startled gasp that Castiel finds himself echoing. The mark is brighter than it’s ever been, rich with vibrant greens, the thread of gold almost glowing in the cool winter air. Castiel’s mesmerised by the colour, but Dean’s already looking away, fumbling at the collar of his shirt.
He only registers Dean has sat down on the bed next to him when Dean turns the bedside lamp on and leans down and to kiss him on the shoulder.
“Seriously?” Dean shakes his head. “Everyone round here must be goddamn blind then, cause they really, really are, dude.” He pauses, chewing his lip, flicks a glance up and down Castiel, mumbles awkwardly, “actually all of you kind of is.”
Cas rolls his eyes, leans to wind the window down so the fresh air buffets his face, drowns out Dean’s stupid voice.
,” Cas growls into his mouth, and Dean does, but part of his head is screaming at him and he can’t sink into it when he’s so scared that Cas is hurting.
In the bathroom, Cas shuffles off his pyjama bottoms and beelines straight for the shower. Dean pauses to sling a couple of towels over the heater to warm up before kicking off his own sweats. The tiles are cold underfoot and Dean hisses a little, hurries to join Cas. Cas has cranked the water heat up so it’s billowing steam and his skin is already blushing pink and warm. Dean grins to himself, grabs Cas around his waist and curls his chilly toes into the side of Cas’ calf. Cas yelps a startled
“Ready?” He asks, and before Castiel can do more than sit up and nod Dean’s turning his back and yanking his t-shirt over his head.
dropping from his lips with a quirk of a smile and a sparkle in his eyes that never appears for anyone else.
He goes down hard, back first onto solid concrete. His breath punches out of him like he’s taken a shotgun to the heart.
Dean’s grin ratchets up a notch. He leaves it for the minute. Changes back into his own clothes, gathers up the pieces he wants and heads for the checkout. Cas trails behind him, half tripping on his dragging feet.
to me. This isn’t,” his hand tightens convulsively on Dean’s shoulder and Dean feels it right into his core, “this isn’t anything like what I felt for my father. I have never felt
Halfway down the corridor Cas squeezes his fingers. He fixes Dean with a knowing stare and presses his fingertips into the pulse point of Dean’s wrist. “Were you trying to seduce me with bacon and honey ice cream?”
The softness of Cas’ smile cracks Dean’s heart with a love so fierce it’s pain. He slumps forward, hands clenching in Cas’ t-shirt. Cas catches him, cradles the back of Dean’s head with one hand, and Dean exhales long and shaky. For a long moment Dean just feels Cas’ heart beating against his ear, breathes out the fumes of poisonous memory, breathes Cas back in.
He wanders down a couple of rows of stalls, casting his eyes over the wares without really focusing on them. Over here the vendors are all looking to offload twentieth century junk, nothing near old enough to pique his interest. He’s drawn momentarily by a stall full of vintage books, but he resists with the thought that he already has a to-read pile forty deep he’s barely touched, and Dean keeps making pointed comments about wanting to use his desk for something other than book storage occasionally.
Finally the cooling mess between their stomachs tips over from ignorable to honestly kind of gross and Dean shakes his head, pushes up from their comfortable tangle.
“Sam and Eileen are ten miles down the road, I’d call them.” Dean drops to crouch by the bed. “Do you not want me to?”
“We figured we know what we want, what’s the point in waiting?” Dean glances down at Cas and Cas grins back up at him, eyes crinkling. Balthazar mouths noiselessly.
Cas melts into him as readily as he did the ice cream, like Dean’s the sweetest thing he’s ever tasted. His fingers slide up Dean’s chest, twist into his collar. Dean curls his hand around Cas’ elbow, his jaw, tilts his head a little more for that perfect angle, lets the warm slide of Cas’ tongue crowd every other thought out of his mind.
That finally makes Cas look up. His eyes lock straight onto Dean’s and instantly soften, turning so warm and bright Meg can see it from the other side of the table. She’s never seen that expression warm Cas’ face for anyone but Dean, and for a brief, sour moment envy bubbles on the back of her tongue.
“What.” Dean growls without lifting his head from where his face is pressed into Cas’ collarbone. “The fuck. Are you doing. In my house.”
They leave the shop quickly, Dean literally having to lead Cas along by the hand to get him to walk. When they reach the car, Dean glances over at Cas, who promptly turns to stare pointedly off into the distance. His fingers fidget at the edge of his jacket. Dean’s smile widens as he unlocks baby’s doors.
Grinning, Dean strips Cas’ socks off. He keeps hold of Cas’ left foot, bends down to run his tongue up the fine arch of it, looks up at Cas’ face through his eyelashes. Cas’ toes curl and his eyes darken, so Dean does it again, ending with a kiss planted firmly on the jut of Cas’ ankle.
“Load the dishwasher and be at the door in two minutes,” she orders, brusque, then strides for her office, leaving her coffee cup on the table. Castiel quickly lobs the last few bites of toast out the window on the back lawn, stacks the dishes into the dishwasher, and is in the hallway lacing his shoes by the time Naomi re-emerges with her phone in hand, tucking the personal bible she prefers into her handbag. It’s a rare illustrated edition, and she never fails to take it with her every week. Castiel knows better than to roll his eyes at it, but today the urge is so strong he has to duck his head lower over his shoes and bite his lip to keep it in.
Dean meets his eyes and for an instant something surfaces in Dean’s gaze that turns Castiel’s mouth dry because in that second he knows with absolute certainty that Dean understands. Castiel doesn’t have to offer any kind of explanation or even say a single word, Dean already knows what it is to be in Castiel’s position.
The third time Sam visits she finds herself alone with him at the cafeteria table at lunch, the rest of the group still caught in the food line. He’s got his nose stuck in a battered paperback but he looks up when she leans forward.
“He was at the wedding, would’ve been hard for him to miss,” Dean smiles. “Obviously Sammy and Bobby knew too. We haven’t exactly been hiding it, guys.”
The other one, the one with the flag pin, looks back up at Dean. “Yeah.” He agrees. “Thanks. That was so badass, man.”
“I’d better get going,” Castiel continues as he retrieves his half-empty coffee mug from the table, empties it into the sink. “I have to return some library books before class.”
Dean is glad it’s dark because his face feels hotter than the sun. What the fuck is he supposed to say to that, to answer that?
Dean, not when you’re done bitching, actually now. Confused when Dean has said or done something Cas doesn’t understand. That one is maybe the most familiar. The one Dean finds most endearing.
Castiel tucks his hand under the table and slides his sleeve up to just above his wrist. His mark leans predominantly green, apples and dappled shade under trees and sunlit grass. There are other shades in there too, blues and hints of red, a flicker of purple across the face of the amulet, but other than the greens the only constant is a tracery of gold that twines in amongst the others, one moment sharp and bright, the next muted but warm.
“Why do you always have to throw yourself in front of knives, Dean?” Cas douses the wound with disinfectant. Dean jerks, eyes rolling up a little. As Cas dabs the wound dry with cotton wool, Dean glances down at it.
“Here,” Cas says, grabbing his angel blade off the bed beside him and proffering it. “Take this with you.”
“So, uh, like I said, my mark’s on my back. My shoulders. Um.” He scratches his ear, another nervous tick Castiel hasn’t seen before. “I guess we could sit down and I’ll… I’ll take my shirt off so you can see?”
Cas says nothing. Just twitches, pressing minutely back into Dean, hands slipping down to grip his hips. Dean feels the hard heat of him against his thigh and smiles, shaky and exhilarated on his own survival.
in this sort of awed voice, which all kinds of strange and lovely even the hundredth, the thousandth time. But it’s a problem when half the time it makes something in Dean’s head come unstuck and he forgets that he was trying to read up on a hunt, or cook a meal, or get Cas’ clothes off.
“You kids all right?” Dean makes himself tear his eyes away from Cas to look at the two boys. Check on them. They’re still leaning on the wall, but they’re not clinging so hard to each other and they’re staring up at him and Cas with a kind of astonished wonder.
Cas hooks his leg over Dean’s knee, tucks his bare foot into the back of Dean’s calf and pulls them tight together. He rests one of his hands on Dean’s side, thumb smoothing over jut of Dean’s hip. His other arm is trapped under Dean’s head, so he just curls his hand up to comb idle fingers through the downy hair behind Dean’s ear.
“Okay. Okay.” Sam soothes. “I just mean why did you decide to… let that part of yourself out again, after such a long time?”
“Not im-“ Sam sits up straight, leans forward to plant his hands on the table. Now he looks properly pissed. “Of course it’s important, it’s your whole life. Your whole fucking life and you’ve just been, what? Hiding it from me?”
He’d better also get moving, he realises with a little jolt of anxiety. Naomi likely already suspects he was lying about the library; she suspects anything he does that’s even slightly out of his normal routine. If he’s up here too long she’ll take it as a certainty.
Dean’s throat closes up. He jerks his head, an abortive shake. It shouldn’t hurt like this. They have Cas back. He’s a minute’s walk down the hall, sprawled out across Dean’s bed –
Dean rolls his eyes. “I’m not suggesting any Michelin star bullshit, they wouldn’t let us in dressed like this anyway. Just something with table service where the floors aren’t greasy.”
Somehow it’s that tiny noise that brings the crushing understanding of Dean’s confession down on Sam’s head.
“Hey there sweetheart.” He runs his fingers through Cas’ sopping hair, combing it off his face. “How are you feeling?”
“No.” Cas wriggles his feet in further. Dean slides his hand up Cas’ jeans, wraps his fingers around his ankle.
“So,” she says, smiling because now she feels like she’s finally in on the joke, ”every time you said you weren’t boyfriends…”
Startled, Dean’s head whips round. Cas is settling himself on the edge, feet hanging next to Dean’s. His eyes are ringed with tired bruises, his hair a disaster. He’s got the blanket from their bed draped around him, over his t-shirt and a pair of Dean’s sweatpants. A little too long in the leg, slightly loose. His boots are untied and he’s not wearing socks. For some reason that tiny fact grips Dean’s gaze for a long moment. Cas didn’t even take the time to tie his shoes, came to find him instead.
This time Dean knows exactly what to do with it. He slides his arms around Cas’ back, presses his nose into his hair and breathes in the warm, familiar smell of him. “Love you,” he mumbles into Cas’ temple. And against his neck he feels the curve of Cas’ smile.
September rolls around and brings with it a new academic year. Cas slips back into the dull routine of classes and homework and squirreling himself away in the library at lunch to avoid the bored jocks on the prowl for a target, any target.
Castiel feels winded. Dean’s words might as well have been an iron bar to the ribs. He’d known, he couldn’t avoid guessing, not with the undercurrent of quiet suffering he’s felt from Dean over the past months, he’d known something had to be wrong in his life. But hearing it out loud is another beast entirely.
The suspect invites them in, asks them to sit down at the dining table while he fetches coffee. They settle themselves in, deliberately clustering themselves at one of the table so the suspect will have to face the united front of the three of them at once.
He pushes Dean gently, hands slipping over Dean’s back to hold his shoulders. Dean blinks and scrubs his eyes, nodding blearily. He pulls himself upright, turns to look down at his feet. He needs to change, and the first step in that has to be taking his boots off. But his feet are so far away and he can’t find the energy to lean down and wrestle with his laces. He rests his elbows on his knees and stares stupidly at those laces, wondering if he can just flop down and sleep fully dressed. It would be far from the first time.
Sam thinking against his forehead where it rests on Sam’s chest. The quiet ticking of Sam’s memory as he flicks back through his files. An unconscious grenade ticking down.
Cas laughs, deep and a little rough. His fingers twine through Dean’s and he presses a kiss to Dean’s knuckles.
“Hey, so Cas, I’ve always wondered.” Dean’s cranes to look over his shoulder at Castiel. The cold grey afternoon light filtering through the dingy curtains is painting the motel room in drab shades of beige and brown, but his eyes are somehow still so bright and green that Cas has to remind himself to breathe. “I could never figure out why it’s wings, and even now I’ve met you I ain’t got a clue.”
very tidy. She wouldn’t put it past him to have a spotless room, down to a perfectly made bed. But still…
“Hello Dean,” Castiel smiles, savouring the first time he can speak his soulmate’s name aloud. “I’m Castiel. Novak, if you want to do full introductions.”
“Hey Meg,” green eyes says, casual and smiling. “Cas texted he was bringin’ a friend. Said you’d want black coffee so me and Benny got you one. Hope that’s good.”
When they arrive Meg heads for the counter, but before she’s two steps in someone pops up at a table to her left and waves manically.
“Dad kind of,” Dean gestures aimlessly, “lost it a bit, I guess. He couldn’t stay in that town, couldn’t settle down anywhere. So he quit his job and hit the road. Stuck me in the back seat with Sammy in a blanket on my lap and just… drove. Hasn’t stopped since.”
“C’mon in Cas,” Dean says, and steps inside himself. Unexpectedly nervous, Cas takes a steadying breath, rubs his suddenly sweaty palms dry on his coat, and follows.
Cas comes with his eyes screwed shut. His fingers grip convulsively on Dean’s shoulder, nails digging in just hard enough to send tiny shocks of pain down into Dean’s ribs, and that’s all it takes to tip Dean over the edge too. He follows Cas down with his face pushed into Cas’ hair and his own hand gripping Cas’ hip tight enough to bruise, the world whiting out around him.
It’s unseasonably hot for Kansas in September. Cas has ended up tending his little garden shirtless a few times, hating the cling of sweaty fabric to his skin as he works. Dean has been religious about making Cas put on sunscreen, about coming up to the roof after a few hours and making him re-apply it. Most times he’ll help Cas with the bits of his back he can’t reach, and – Cas hasn’t been getting a whole lot of gardening done lately. For some reason.
Dean’s heart feels like it might swell and burst his chest. His throat burns fiercely and his breath snags, tripping on the sudden ache in his lungs.
Cas leans on him for a while, feeling the rhythm of Dean’s breath, the warmth of him through their clothes. Dean watches the sky, hums a little under his breath.
Dean doesn’t reply, just turns his head away. That’s all the confirmation Sam needs. Sam swears softly, the guilt heavy in his voice, and the ache in Dean’s heart for not being able to lie well enough to protect Sam from this is so vicious he wants to claw his own ribs open just to get it out of him.
his own, his distress and panic, but mingled with it are anger and fear and misery that are foreign in that way that’s already deeply familiar.
Settling on the windowsill, Castiel hugs his knees, stares up into the dark. There’s a curious edge to his soulmate’s presence that Castiel’s never felt before and it sucks in his attention. It’s warm, hazy. It makes him feel oddly looser, easier in his skin. Castiel’s never tasted alcohol, but he’s heard and seen enough to think this must be what it’s like to drink. Not to excess, just enough for a glow inside. So, he wonders, does that mean his soulmate’s over twenty-one? He doesn’t think so, somehow. Even with his barest scraping of knowledge of them, he’s inclined to think it much more likely they’re the type to sneak illicit beers for a party on New Year’s Eve.
Dean shakes his head, turns enough to grab Castiel’s hand and pull it back to lay on his mark. The colours bloom again, the brightest thing this motel room has ever witnessed, lighting Castiel back up inside, and Dean shivers again.
The kid’s eyes go round and amazed. His boyfriend finally manages to drag him off after him, but he looks back over his shoulder several times before he properly turns away.
right. All the faces he can see blend together, none of them standing out from the blur. Nobody calls to him the way he knows his soulmate will.
“I have a business dinner with colleagues this evening,” she tells him without looking back. “I won’t be home until eleven.”
Balthazar downs his coffee. “Charlie.” He places a dramatic hand over hers where she’s holding her fork. “Charlie, my love. Last I saw them, Cassie was climbing Dean like a tree in the corridor backstage and, judging by how much tongue he was putting in it, Dean was
Dean needs a new suit. His old standby FBI getup lost a fight with a really angry kitsune out in Missouri. Since it’s pretty much on their route home, Dean pit stops in Kansas City to pick up a replacement. Sam’s needed some new smart shirts for a while and he figures Cas deserves some clothes that aren’t his cast-offs or thrifted, so they might as well hit up a city centre and get all the shopping done in one go.
Castiel thinks. He can feel both their fear, intertwined in the bottom of his stomach, and that gives him the bravery to break out of his frozen stare and open his mouth.
When they finally make it over and slump together on the free side of the booth, Balthazar barely lets them drink a sip of their coffees before launching in. Dean is already talking to Benny, so he aims for Castiel as his first target.
Dean doesn’t have to respond. The shudder that racks him gives Sam all the answer he needs. Sam’s hands clench, tugging him in even closer.
“Love you,” he mumbles. They’re so close the words reverberate off Cas’ skin and Dean feels the echo of them as a soft hum against his lips.
They tumble through that door in a mess of tangled limbs. Dean’s hip rebounds off the desk but the jolt of pain barely registers through the heat flaring under his skin. He mouths at the line of Cas’ jaw, grabs at his shirt, shoves it off his shoulders to get to skin. The buttons snag and Dean tugs, stymied. Then Cas kisses into the hollow behind Dean’s ear, open mouthed and wet and messy, and the frustration slips from Dean’s mind in a hot glide of
Meg itches to catch Bobby alone and ask him about Dean and Cas. He has to be a goldmine of anecdotes and blackmail material, even more so than Sam. For the first couple of hours, though, she has to bite her tongue. Dean monopolises Bobby until Cas touches his cheek and gives him a single look that calms him down enough to let someone else talk, then there’s introductions and small talk, food to be ordered and consumed. Meg rolls with it, but part of her stays poised and ready for her opportunity.
“Nah, that can be cool, to have roots like that.” Dean pushes his hands deeper into his pockets and his expression turns a little wistful. “I’ve never had that.”
He’d talked about god like that back at the beginning. Daddy’s faithful little soldier, he’s talked of his father in that tone that rang with faith as unshakable as the mountains. Dean hasn’t heard anything like that utter devotion from Cas’ mouth in years, not since he rebelled, since he
feel, Dean? I told you, I was alive for millennia before I met you and never changed. I didn’t think I
“He never asked me for anything. Eleven years, not one fuckin’ thing. Even when…” Dean realises his hands are trembling. He wraps his arms around himself, grips tight into his sleeves to still them. All it does is send tiny shocks reverberating up into his shoulders. “Even when he told me, he didn’t expect anything back.”
He doesn’t quite know where this nerve has come from, to skate so close to interrupting her. It’s a heady rush that he quickly clamps down on. He lifts his eyes and meets Naomi’s gaze, schooling his face to a careful transparency that shows nothing but blankness underneath.
Cas lets her down carefully, which she’s not really surprised by, but the way he does it sure does give her pause.
“Dean.” Sam repeats. He doesn’t say anything else, and that’s somehow worse than his questioning, his expectant eyes more cutting than his probing words.
So it’s been nearly three weeks. Three weeks of being so disgustingly affectionate that Sam’s threatened to hose them with cold water more than once. Three weeks since Dean tried to give Cas space, let him sleep in his own room at least at first till they can figure out exactly where this is taking them. But then Dean couldn’t sleep for fear he’d dreamt the rescue, and when he went to stick his head round Cas’ door and check he was really there he’d bumped into Cas in the corridor instead, eyes red and hands shaking with
Dean laughs weakly and puts a hand over his eyes. Cas’ thumb soothes over the ridge of his shoulder.
One of the kids mutters. Dean hears Cas say something in response, but the guy’s already scrambling to his feet and Dean doesn’t catch it.
The curly-haired girl two tables over barely bothers to lower her voice. In the still of the library her derisive words carry as easily as if she’d spoken them aloud. The other girls huddled around her table giggle and shove at her shoulders, casting unsubtle glances sideways at Castiel through their eyelashes.
Cas is shaking in his arms. It’s not fear, Dean knows that. Cas stared down a charging werewolf three days ago, waited for it to get close enough to shoot without flinching. Cas doesn’t
Cas tangles his fingers in Dean’s hair, drags him down to kiss him slow and soft and gentle. When they part he cards his fingers through the hair behind Dean’s ear, scrabbles down by his knee to pull the starry blanket up over Dean’s shoulders.
Naomi doesn’t hold with much music – a bad influence, all that hideous cacophony in the charts – but she does allow classical and opera. She thinks that’s educational.
Dean kicks his boots off, slings his legs up onto the map room table. Sam passes him a beer, and he nods in acknowledgement as he cracks open a leather-bound book that might help with the spell Sam’s determined to figure out.
They’ve reached the edge of the motel carpark and Dean stops, scuffs his toe over the frost-rimed kerb. His shoulders are hunched tight again, head ducked. Castiel stands awkwardly, close enough to take Dean’s hand but not knowing how to cross the divide and do it.
Dean drops his forehead to rest on Cas’ collarbone, kisses the tender skin there. His hips dip a little lower, jostling their hands together and Cas groans softly.
“Okay, Dean.” Cas whispers. It’s not a question, but it’s not a statement either. The way Cas breathes it, quiet and calm into Dean’s lips, here where there’s only the two of them to witness it, it feels like a vow.
. Has been shoving it into a box in the back of his mind for years, taping around it with layer upon layer of alcohol and denial the more it grew and split the box at the seams. Since he ripped that box open and let it loose, it’s been a wild, uncontrollable thing. No analogy he’s ever heard can put words to it. It’s fire in his blood, a storm in his heart, a drug intoxicating his brain, blue as a summer sky, green as the spring, gold as daylight, all of them and so much more than them all at once.
Then Cas takes advantage of Dean’s distraction to dump his handful of raspberries into Dean’s bowl and Dean’s scandalised expression more than makes up for all of Meg’s irritation.
“It’s Castiel officially,” he says after their first intro lecture where they sat side by side and passed confused notes over the lecturer’s meandering monologues. He’s strangely serious, as she’s already learnt within two hours of acquaintance he almost always is. “But my friends call me Cas. You can if you want.”
Dean blinks down at him. His heart suddenly feels four times too big for his ribs. Cas just smiles up at him, so wide and happy and warm, looking like everything Dean’s ever wanted and never known how to ask for. Dean smiles back, helpless not to.
They spend most of the day puttering about the bunker. They don’t really get anything done, but Dean’s happy to do the little domestic things that get neglected when they’re sunk into a hunt, polish up baby, spend a few hours sprawled out on the sofa with a record playing. Cas follows him like his own shadow all day, helping him tidy the kitchen, passing Dean polish and cloths while he works on the car, flopping down on Dean’s stomach and dozing while the record plays out.
Dean chokes a little on the words, then the tears do spill. His vision blurs and he clenches his jaw to keep a sob behind his teeth. He feels Cas touching his cheek, the whisper of a concerned
Before Castiel can gather his errant thoughts back together, Dean drops to sit beside him, close enough to bump their knees.
They have to be here, inside this building, so close they’ve felt each other, so close they’ve both woken up.
So Castiel tears his gaze away from his wrist and pulls a jumper on over his shirt, tugging the sleeves down over his hands to hide the mark. As he’s tidying his wayward hair and fetching his phone from the bedside table, he finds himself compulsively checking that nothing of his mark is visible every few seconds. Forcing himself to stop, Castiel stands in the middle of his room, closes his eyes and takes several deep, measured breaths until the anxious fluttering of his heart slows to something bearable.
Sam smiles a bit, turns away. He hesitates as he goes, turning back to look at Dean as if he’s afraid Dean will stay here all night, pinned to the wall. But eventually he does leave.
To his surprise there’s no response. Dean glances round. Cas is staring at him, eyes round, pupils eating most of the blue.
leans over the sofa arm to hug Cas, who doesn’t even bother to sit up from his boneless sprawl over most of Dean’s body to respond, comes around the sofa to hug Dean from behind. Dean signs a clumsy “hi, welcome home” as she leaves the room, and she grins at him like he lit the sun.
“My fault.” Dean breathes between his teeth as the thread pulls through his skin, sweat beading his brow. “Wasn’t lookin’.”
“I had daydreams too,” he tells Dean in a rush. That seems to be the right thing to say because Dean looks back at him, embarrassment fading into curiosity. His ears are still a little pink, though, and Castiel has to quickly force himself to look Dean in the eye instead of letting his thoughts wander into how charming he finds that.
Not dead, but turns out moving house is exhausting. Who'd have thought. So Cas and Dean just spent their time packed in a moving box finding even more ways to be soft with each other.
The two kids are huddled together against the wall now, hands clutched between them. They can’t be more than seventeen. One of them has a bi flag pin on his lapel and something in Dean’s heart twists.
tucks Cas into bed. The mattress is so soft and welcoming that Cas is asleep before Dean’s even turned out the lamp.
“He’s still not my boyfriend,” Cas says wearily. He flops down onto his back and drops a hand onto the blanketed rise of Dean’s shoulder. “You’d better fix the lock on your way out, Meg, I’m not getting up to deal with your overenthusiastic foray into breaking and entering.”
It happens on a perfectly ordinary August day. Castiel spent most of it in the library, getting ahead on the reading for the new term. He’s going into junior year and he needs to do well. Only two years left of high school, then a good college far from here will be his ticket out from under Naomi’s thumb. He can finally choose what he wants to do with his life. Study something interesting, not meekly follow Naomi’s shoving towards a career in law. Maybe even reach out to the few brothers who weren’t utter bastards his whole childhood, try to rebuild some sort of family.
Dean breathes deeply and closes his eyes, cups the human reality of that scent in his heart and lets himself drift.
, and his feelings for Dean were a confusing, distracting problem to be shoved under a mental rug and held down with piles of heavenly orders. Panicked when Dean’s gone and got himself hurt for the millionth time. Tired when Cas has forgotten to sleep again. Concerned when Dean is spiralling. Demanding when he needs to Dean to do something right now,
He only makes it two steps before a wave of concern washes through his stomach and Castiel stops dead to realise he is, in fact, an utter moron. Of course he feels alone. He’s supposed to have his soulmate by his side, and all he’s got is this bizarre internal emotional dialogue. How is that meant to be a reasonable substitute for a whole living person to share his life – even something so small as a birthday – to share
Cas sighs. “I don’t want you getting hurt either.” He leans forward and rests his forehead on Dean’s. “I don’t particularly enjoy stitching you back together.”
Saying it out loud is only a scant comfort. Hunching forward, he pulls his knees up and curls into himself, rubbing at the present ache in his shoulder as the ghost of past pain slithers its tendrils through him.
Huffing, Castiel shakes the thought of Naomi from his head and puts the half-finished plate on the bedside table. He really should go and clean it up given Naomi’s pointed order, but he’s so
Despite Castiel’s initial denial, they continue to act almost exactly like boyfriends. Okay, true, Meg’s never seen them
Cas looks up from his pile of research, back down at where his bandaged knee is propped on a pillow surrounded by ice packs.
Cas is still not enlightened as to why this warrants extended staring. “Okay?” He agrees, perplexed.
“Dean?” Cas asks, curious. Dean’s emotions are still muffled and his short minutes of experience reading Dean’s feelings off his expressions aren’t enough for him to be able to parse this particular turn of face.
Cas stops, takes a step back to look. He’s trying to start a garden on the bunker roof, but he hasn’t had much chance to shop for bee-friendly plants lately. Mostly it’s a mess of shrubs and perennials up there right now. He’d really like something colourful.
Dean closes his eyes. Their room is a bubble of gentle quiet, the only counterpoint to the silence the low tempo of their breathing. Dean focuses on matching their breath. He counts the beats of each inhale and exhale until they’re in perfect rhythm, automatically follows when Cas’ breathing slows and lengthens as he dips into sleep. The hypnotic chant fills his head, tamping down the hissing whispers snaking up from his memory.
Castiel immediately opens himself up, welcomes the contact in. The offered feeling washes into him strongly as soon as he does, and he’s surprised to find it’s apologetic.
Cas talks, pointing out the ones he’s visited, his favourite constellations, watches Dean out of the side of his eye. Dean isn’t really looking where he’s pointing. He looks up when Cas talks about something specific, but mostly he’s just watching Cas with this soft expression, like he couldn’t imagine looking at anything more beautiful.
Dean takes his time making his way back up Cas’ body. There’s a familiarity to the lines of him now that’s exhilarating. His hands know the shape of him, know where to touch to make him gasp and shiver. So he kisses his way up Cas’ shin, licks lightly into the back of Cas’ knee just because he knows Cas is ticklish, buries his smile in Cas’ thigh as Cas flinches and huffs. By the time he reaches Cas’ hips Cas is trembling finely all over, hands twitching at Dean’s hair, his shoulders.
Dean tips his head back a little to look up at Cas. The light creeping under the door from the hall grants the barest illumination that catches on the contours of Cas’ face, outlines the shape of him in tones of deepest midnight. Cas' breath is soft and even across Dean’s cheek. His arm lies lax over Dean’s side, fingers loosely looped into the hem of Dean’s t-shirt.
Cas nods eagerly and hold his hand out for Dean to help him up. A sudden bubble of mischief bursting in his stomach, Dean ignores the hand, quickly slips an arm around Cas’ back, the other under his knees, and picks him up. Cas yelps and clings onto Dean’s neck.
When Castiel closes his eyes he can almost see other fireworks from another place bursting across the backs of his eyelids and feel the ghost of a touch on his cheek.
“You could, um,” Dean hesitates, rubs his hand over his hair again, “we’re staying in a motel right now. It’s only the other side of this park, over near the Taco Bell, you know it? We could go back there and I can show you. Only if you want to though, promise I won’t make any moves on you. Fuck that sounds creepy, I didn’t mean to make this weird, sorry, I just, I don’t-“
Cas shoves his hands under Dean’s flannel and wrestles it down his arms. Then he’s grabbing Dean by the collar, spinning him around. He backs them up till Dean’s calves trip on the bed and they’re toppling back onto the mattress.
So instead Castiel heads back down to the ground floor and the public-access computers. Picking the one furthest from the issue desk, partly concealed by a display stand of new-in crime thrillers, he slips into the chair and logs on with a guilty glance around him. No one’s looking. No one even glanced up as he walked by at a pace that was meant to be casual but was probably more of a run. Still, the back of his neck prickles uncomfortably.
Castiel would almost believe that the pain of last night is gone and forgotten, that everything’s fine again.
Some days he wishes the bunker were in Florida where he’d never have to worry about how the cold sets off his old war wounds and reminds him sharply and precisely of exactly how old he’s got, but then Cas reads him another headline about
Cas grabs onto him again, steadies Dean’s sagging frame against his own. He gets him down on the floor, back against the tiles and legs splayed out over the linoleum without incident, but as soon as he pulls at Dean’s jacket, twitching it away from his bloodied side, Dean flails and collapses sideways.
When Dean comes back to himself, he’s slumped bonelessly over Cas like a human blanket. If it were anyone else Dean would worry about crushing them, but Cas just blinks slowly, eyes hooded and dark and blissed out, and wraps all his limbs around Dean in a whole-body hug. The heat inside Dean settles now, turning sweet and hazy, blending with the warmth of Cas’ body against his own. Dean snuffles contentedly and slides his hands under Cas’ back to pull them even closer together.
, Jesus, no I didn’t,” he rushes to say, hand making an abortive movement like he wanted to grab Castiel’s hand and squeeze it. The pressure in Castiel’s chest eases slightly.
The next morning Cas is all sleepy eyes and smiles, wrapping himself around Dean and whispering love into Dean’s lips.
Cas lets go of Dean’s jacket and he takes Dean’s hand instead. Both the boys look down at the movement in unison.
There’s a pause. Cas pushes another stitch through. Dean’s body stays perfectly still, letting the stitch glide into place just as Cas wants, but his leg jerks, heel knocking off the floor.
He shouldn’t be afraid of this, he realises. Cas isn’t. Somehow, despite all that Dean’s done to him, all the pain and guilt, all the literal deaths that loving Dean has inflicted on him over the past eleven years, Cas still consciously, repeatedly trusts Dean with his heart. He still thinks Dean’s name is worth saying with all the devotion of a prayer. The least Dean can do is be brave enough to accept what Cas wants it to mean.
Dean fists Cas’ shirt, yanks him in. He loses himself for a second in the scrape of Cas’ stubble on his cheek, the solid strength of his muscles under Dean’s palms. Then Cas’ hands are on his jeans, popping the button, wrenching down the zip and all of Dean’s awareness focuses down into the brush of Cas’ knuckles over his dick.
Castiel’s mouth is dry. His hands are shaking too hard to control. His legs feel like water. Somehow he still manages to make himself turn.
As the minutes tick by their excitement amps up even further. By the time there’s two minutes left Castiel feels almost drunk himself, heady on second-hand delight. Pulse fluttering, he keeps an eye on his watch and counts down the last seconds.
So Dean lifts a shoulder in acknowledgement, not saying no but clearly not saying yes either. He can see Sam’s disappointment in the slight droop of Sam’s back, but he’s too weary to care. All he wants to do is flee to his room, flee to where Cas is and just curl up beside him until the icy pain memory has frozen into his ribcage melts under warmth of Cas’ glow.
Heart in his throat, Castiel reaches out and brushes a trembling fingertip over the amulet’s smooth surface. It’s warm from Dean’s hand, from being tucked against his chest. Still, Castiel can’t quite make himself believe it’s here, solid under his touch.
Dean closes his eyes and nods. Cas immediately slips Dean’s flannel down his shoulders and works him out of it. He moves on to efficiently pulling Dean’s t-shirt off, but as Dean’s head pops free from the material, Cas leans forward and kisses his forehead. He lingers against Dean’s skin and runs his hand down Dean’s naked spine, pressing kiss and hand so hard against Dean’s skin it almost hurts.
“I feel like I’m intruding on the world’s most sickening double date,” Balthazar grumpily says to Meg as he takes the seat next to her. “I don’t know who’s worse, the honeymooning girlfriends or the bickering boyfriends.”
“Dinner?” Dean interrupts his train of thought. “We should get something nicer than fast food for a change, go to a proper restaurant.”
Sam suddenly sucks in a harsh breath, grasps at Dean’s shirt again. His eyes are wide and wet, and words pour out of him in a frantic rush.
Sam’s face is so earnest, sincere in that wet-eyed, set jaw way he’s had since he was a kid. Dean knows he means what he says, knows he should nod and accept it. But how is he supposed to take that offer when it took him eleven years to open his heart even to let love out? It’s not like he can just sit down in the library with Sam and pour out his pain and grief, all his fear and anger and regret out onto the floor like so much spilled whiskey for Sam to mop up with an understanding smile.
He supposes it’s no surprise given the stress of the day, but still he’s startled by just how heavy his muscles feel now he’s in bed. He’ll just lie down for a bit, just until the laundry’s done, then he’ll clear up. That should give him plenty of time before Naomi gets home.
They’ve passed half a dozen motels since he started driving. They could have stopped at any of them.
Dean swallows hard. His feet speed up of their own volition, tugging Cas along faster. Has their bedroom door always been this far from the kitchen?
It’s a long time before Dean warms up, but it’s about when the vicious pins and needles subside and he starts being able to feel his fingers again that he also realises that Cas is mostly naked and
If it were any other day Castiel would indulge in staring for at least a little longer. As it is, it’s Sunday and he has maybe three minutes before Naomi starts harrying him to get downstairs before they’re late for church. Church on Sundays is the inviolable law. The only time she let Castiel miss it he was too weak from the flu to stand, and he still strongly suspects that if he’d been able to stagger she would have dragged him there. Castiel is entirely certain that Naomi only attends to keep up her carefully constructed social image and position, not out of any particular piety. If anything is holy to Naomi, it’s the family honour.
Leather and brown hair and freckles, Castiel thinks, dazed. So his daydreams weren’t daydreams after all.
She can’t have heard that right. Maybe she’s having auditory hallucinations brought on by too many shots, not enough sleep, and this morning’s bucketful of caffeine. She knew that second extra large black coffee was a mistake.
Dean pulls a leather cord out from under his layers, tugs it over his head, holds the pendant out on the flat of his hand. Castiel looks down and there it is. There’s his mark made real. The amulet with its curving horns, the fine lines of the tiny face, the coils of the cord laid over Dean’s skin in a mirror of the lines on Castiel’s.
Cas slips off him and pulls him to the side, rolling them so that they’re face to face. Cas presses them close, hooking his leg over Dean’s knee and wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck and shoulders. He hums softly into Dean’s hair, runs his hand gently up and down Dean’s spine. Dean pushes his face into Cas’ shoulder, squeezes his eyes tight and tries to remember how to breathe.
“Fine, Jesus, okay.” He toes his shoes off, shuffles out of his jeans and shirt, slides under the duvet in his t-shirt and boxers. As soon as his body touches the mattress, Cas literally feels him sag with relief at lying down, curling into the giving softness. Cas would grab his hand and hug him in close if he had the energy, but Dean reads his mind without him having to move. He snuggles up to Cas’ back and tucks an arm around him, nose pressing into the back of his neck.
It’s his name that does it. Again. One syllable shouldn’t be able to carry all the softness and worry and desire that Cas can put into it. It crumples Dean’s heart like tissue paper.
“Dean.” He says quietly. “The whole reason we’re having this conversation is that you didn’t let yourself openly want another man for nearly thirty years.”
“I am too you know,” Dean makes himself say, the effort like he’s having to crowbar the words out of his stubborn chest. “Certain. Of this. Us.” He rubs a hand over his face, feels the drying tear tracks against his fingers. “It’s just… a lot. Sometimes.”
For a crystalline moment that’s all either of them do. Castiel isn’t sure the other boy is breathing at all. He’s not sure
He’s not even sure what he’s saying any more. He throat is burning and involuntary tears are searing his eyes, so hot he wonders for a wild second if they’ll scar when they spill. Cas just shakes his head and leans down to press his forehead hard against Dean’s own.
“I knew.” Charlie shrugs at her, unapologetic. “Clocked Dean for bi the second I met him.” Dean throws a balled-up napkin at her that she dodges easily, laughing. “For serious though Dean, you were making moon eyes at a picture of Cas on your phone, you couldn’t have been more obvious if you’d tried.” She’s teasing, but it’s warm and Dean just smiles sheepishly in answer.
Since that old certainty shattered on the ground like so much crystal, and shattered Cas’ heart along with it.
To Castiel’s disquiet, Dean doesn’t take the proffered hand. He eyes it instead, fingers twitching at his side, an emotion Castiel can’t describe churning through the bond between them. Castiel pulls his hand back, shoves it into his coat pocket, suddenly nervous again. Dean fidgets, feet crunching on the packed snow and gravel and Castiel swallows hard.
“I always wear it,” Dean explains, running his finger along the ridge of the amulet’s horn. “Don’t feel like myself without it.”
Cas doesn’t look up from his work, but his fingers tighten on Dean’s shoulder and Dean visibly relaxes, muscles easing and shoulders drooping until he’s slumped loose in his chair.
Fuck Sam for making Dean bring all this back up. Fuck him for knifing his ribs open and spilling the pain he pushed down into the bottom of his heart at fifteen and tried to pretend didn’t exist for the next twenty-six years.
catches Castiel’s eye in the article and he slows his scroll. He doesn’t remember mark colours coming up in any of his classes, other than the obvious fact that colour comes with activation. He’d never considered that it might mean something deeper.
Dean huffs a breath. “I’m from Kansas originally. Lawrence, actually,” he says, and Castiel nods to himself, pleased he caught the accent correctly. “But, uh, we’ve. Um. Been a lot of places.”
Dean lets the words sink into his skin like a balm, mingling with the lingering high still running in his blood. Against his nose Cas’ skin is warm, smelling now of sweat and sex and the barest hint of that citrussy shower gel,
Castiel doesn’t feel much like eating. Even knowing he’s alone, free from Naomi’s prying eyes, his stomach twinges enough with the aftershocks of stress to destroy any appetite he might have had. Still, once his laundry is sorted and the washing machine is running, he heats up the leftover fish Naomi pointed out, puts some green beans on the side. Letting her come home to find he hasn’t eaten at all would just be asking for trouble.
But now. But now Dean will do something utterly inconsequential like crack a dumb joke, or grab Cas’ hand to pull him up off the sofa after a long TV marathon, or grin at Cas across the war room table in the middle of planning a hunt, and Cas’ face will soften into a smile so wide and warm that Dean’s heart trips over its own beats, and Cas will breathe out just
Today the sky’s endlessly blue again, the sun high and the air so warm and still it feels thick, the light hanging in it like honey.
“But you didn’t. I’m right here,” Dean whispers into Cas’ lips. “Tell me you don’t want this and I’ll stop. But I want
“You move house a lot?” Castiel asks, frowning. He doesn’t quite understand the meaning behind Dean’s turn of phrase. It sounds simple, but the way Dean hesitated as he chose his words gives Castiel a sensation of sudden vertigo, as though he were peering over a precipice deeper than he can yet comprehend.
How Cas will card his fingers through Dean’s hair when Dean’s got his mouth on him, but he never grabs hold, never pulls, never pushes himself in.
“I don’t…” Sam says hesitantly, his fingers not hooked on Dean’s arm twitching uselessly. “I don’t… you must have done that for years Dean. For
bed - with his pyjamas rumpled and hair askew and his nose stuck in some dusty tome, just waiting for Dean to come in and press his face into Cas’ neck, run his hands up Cas’ thigh until he drops the book and grabs hold of Dean instead, or just flump down beside him, pillow his head on Cas’ stomach and doze while Cas reads, free hand smoothing gently over Dean’s hair. It shouldn’t rip his skin, crack his ribs and flay his heart open. But still, every last time, the memory of those moments in the basement crowbars open the well of guilt and loss and longing and raw grief that’s sunk in his chest and drowns him in the flood.
It’s a normal evening. No one nearly died. No one’s drunk or under a spell and freezing to death. Dean cooks them bacon topped macaroni cheese, throws together a salad on the side to stop Sam bitching. They eat with Sam in the library, argue over the last case, the three of them loose and happy, grinning at each other over their food. Cas asks hopefully for ice cream for dessert, the fancy expensive vanilla one Dean turned a blind eye to him sneaking into their last grocery shop. Dean drizzles it with warm honey and sprinkles on chocolate chips, just for the glowing smile he knows he’ll get when he gives Cas his bowl. While Sam pours them whiskey, Dean watches Cas melt around his first mouthful and his heart beats faster with anticipation.
“Sam wants to meet us at the city library,” Dean says as he pulls him along. “He thinks he’s found something relevant in the newspaper archives. If we hurry we can grab some coffee and takeout at the drive thru on the way. We’ll need it, I can feel one of Sam’s five-hour research binges coming a mile off.”
“Mmm.” Cas hums, reaches back to smooth his hand over Dean’s head. “I loved looking at it, the colours, the brightness of you. Most humans, when you look for it their soul is a warm light in their chest, behind their eyes. But you, when I looked at you, you were always burning like a star. The colours of your emotions shone so bright under your skin, I couldn’t help but be dazzled.”
Cas doesn’t rise to it. He just goes back to talking about the labs as if she’d said nothing at all.
It’s only a while later when he’s pushing in and Cas’ face twists a little, fingers clenching into the meat of Dean’s bicep, that Dean’s internal switch flips over to panic mode.
Nothing really happens though. He makes dinner – pizza – smacks Sam’s knuckles with his spatula when Sam tries to steal bits of pepperoni, almost lets the food burn when Cas shoves him into the counter and kisses him breathless.
Dean follows him down, settling between Cas’ legs and bracketing Cas’ head with his forearms. He slides his hands up into the thick tumble of Cas’ hair, runs his lips along the line of Cas’ jaw. His skin smells a little of his citrus shower gel, and that tugs at Dean’s heart, the sheer humanity of it so new on Cas, but already so familiar.
After a while where he was so silent and still Cas wasn’t sure if he wasn’t falling asleep, Dean shakes himself out of his reverie.
He briefly debates mentioning it, but quickly pushes the thought aside. If he did Dean might stop and he finds to his surprise that he rather likes it. He’s never had a nickname before, but he likes how
Cas can barely feel his fingers. His face feels almost raw. How can wind be so cold that it cuts like a blade? And
So he casts his mind back to just before the wave hit. He’d been running his fingers along the spines of the books, skim reading the titles. He’d paused over one about the presentation of soul bonds in classical literature and art, and he’d felt… he’d felt so abruptly, deeply lonely. His thoughts had skittered away to freckles and a charming smile, and he’d wanted so fiercely his chest had ached with it.
He should get home. The snow’s stopped but the cold is still bitter outside, and he has three assignments due this week that he really needs to finish up. But home isn’t the direction that it’s pulling him, and the thought of going against it is enough to make him nauseated.
The recognition wraps a frail tether around his wrist, grounds him enough to realise he’s not dead, he’s not in the empty.
“I’m gonna…“ Sam touches his fingertips lightly to Dean’s shoulder. “I’m gonna go to bed now. I think you should go talk to- are you going too?”
“That winter Dad disappeared for a month.” It comes out monotone, emotionless. “Left us in some fucking hellhole motel while he went off hunting a wendigo pack on Wind River reservation.”
He can tell himself that with all the bravado he wants. There’s a small, shameful part of him whose pulse beats rabbit-fast with the conviction that Naomi will still somehow find him out.
likes it’s a creed, the reverence whispering from the syllable with all the redolent quality of worship.
Dean gets them safely into their room and deposits Cas onto the bed. He moves quickly then, pulling ridiculous fluffy bedsocks on Cas’ feet and taking his temperature with a thermometer that must be as old as the bunker. He seems satisfied with the result since his eyes loosen at the corners, and he doesn’t touch Cas’ forehead with the worried pressure that he did in the bathroom.
He jerks up onto his elbows, breathing hard. He doesn’t remember having a nightmare. His bed’s not tumbled, even the book he’d been reading last night is still safely on top of the duvet. But his heart’s racing and his skin’s damp with cold sweat and a sick clash of fear and anger is warring under his ribs.
Both their marks flare into glorious, glowing colour. Light blooms under both their skin, swoops through their marks like the aurora across the night sky. Green flows into blue, melding into turquoise, teal, aquamarine, all of it threaded through with a coil of gold that twines them both together.
Now that Castiel’s awake enough to really register it, he realises that at least some of the bitter confusion of emotions weighing down his stomach feels off too. Some of it
Castiel moves without conscious thought. He lifts his right hand and presses his fingers into the very centre of Dean’s mark, right over his spine.
No, it’s the pervasive rumour that true romantic soulmates can feel each other’s emotions, their soulmarks linking them so deeply they can sense each other from opposite sides of the world. It’s a standard trope in every B grade romcom ever made. No one’s ever actually met anyone it’s happened to. It’s all
Dean curls convulsively forward. They had. He remembers that. Most of their faces are a blur in his recollection, but the words are still needle-sharp under his skin.
Naomi stares at him for a good ten seconds before answering. Her frown etches itself deeper between her brows.
Dean kisses close to the corner of Cas’ mouth and Cas turns into it, catches Dean’s lips with his, opens up to him, languorous and a little needy. Cas’s fingers stray under the hem of Dean’s t-shirt, dance lightly up the line of his ribs.
he’s not really interested in, other than for the fact Dean likes it. Sam doesn’t so much as huff in discontent, just tops up the beers and takes the less comfortable seat with Eileen so Cas and Dean can hog the entire comfortable sofa.
Cas chuckles quietly. His breath tickles and Dean has to shove him off to focus before his dick hijacks his higher brain functions and he ends up trying to get back to what they were doing with his jeans still tying his ankles together.
Cas sighs happily, runs one palm lazily up from the small of Dean’s back to cradle the back of his neck.
“Was happy just to say it out loud. Hell, he thought I didn’t…” Dean scrubs a hand over his face, “thought I would never feel that way.”
Sam’s grip finally looses from Dean’s arm. There’s another pause as Sam runs both his hands through his hair and Dean tries to piece himself back together enough to let go of Sam and push himself upright without crumbling apart again.
Dean chokes on a sob. He grabs Cas by the head, pulls him round and kisses him, hard and desperate. He’s not like Cas, he hasn’t got the words for any of this, but he hopes fiercely that Cas understands what he wishes he knew how to tell him.
, hazy and warm like a tiny glowing light set in the centre of his chest. Taking a deep breath, Castiel starts walking again. He cups the ember of affection in his heart, wrapping himself around it and letting it slowly begin to thaw the cold from his bones.
Sam drops his encircling arm, but he keeps his hold on Dean’s forearm. His fingers have latched so tight Dean wonders with grim humour if they’ll bruise. And wouldn’t that be the worst kind of irony, for Sam to leave bruises in the wake of his attempt to soothe Dean’s scars.
The lie comes surprisingly easily. A brief flash of her whipcrack anger licks up his spine out of the pits of his memory, but with Dean close at his back it has no real sting.
Castiel blinks. He wasn’t expecting that. All the way home he was bracing himself for an evening under Naomi’s eye, another awkward dinner opposite her icy gaze, his usual discomfort ratcheted up by the secret lurking under his sweater sleeve. But if Naomi’s out…
On the road, Dean puts Cas’ mixtape on, rolls the windows down so the warm wind buffets their hair. He holds Cas’ hand on the seat and looks over at him every few minutes, corner of his mouth pulling up in a smile. The sunlight glows around him, highlighting his freckles and scattering motes of gold in his green eyes. Cas could look at him forever.
“Oh yeah, I’ve got a ‘67 chevy,” Dean’s face lights up. “Well, my dad does but he lets me drive and maintain her. You dreamt about that?”
Dean’s hand is still obediently holding the towel to his side, but his head is canted sideways and his eyes are closed.
, right now. I know what you are to me, and that could never be damaged by anything you did a long time ago.” Cas pauses, smoothing his thumbs over Dean’s cheekbones, and smiles a tiny bit. “Especially not something you did out of love.”
“It’s never been like this with anyone before,” he grumbles, half complaining and half confessing. “Having sex with you is like you’re pulling my heart out of me and putting it back different.”
Castiel blinks for a long second before the depths of his memory supply the right connection. His blank expression must be a sight because Dean’s face cracks into another of his wide grins, and even after understanding dawns and Castiel nods, Dean’s eyes stay bright and sparkling with amusement.
He presses himself up against the lean lines of Cas’ body, peppers kisses over his forehead, round the curve of his eye. Cas sighs beneath him, hands sliding over Dean’s shoulders, fingers curling gently into his shirt.
“Oh, do you want some bee-friendly plants? I have lavender and some mahonia right here. Or maybe some bluebells and borage?” She winks at him and Cas blinks, disconcerted. “Those would go so well with your eyes.”
Dean pushes himself up, fumbles down between them to take Cas in hand, strokes once, twice. Cas’ gasps out a soft
“Yeah, maybe,” he admits, and the smile that Cas gives him sends fireworks shooting up from his toes to the top of his head.
– but part of his brain is too strung out on fear for it to be properly good. He doesn’t mention it, though the way Cas wrinkles his eyes at him later when they’re cuddled up in bed and Dean can’t stop asking if Cas is okay, he doesn’t hurt, makes him think he’s done a shitty job of hiding it.
Cas is fidgeting in the passenger seat. His fingers tap against his knee, eyes flicker from the road ahead, to his fingers, to the radio blasting Metallica, to Dean, to the side window, to the road again.
Dean shrugs. He doesn’t look over, eyes wandering over the snow-covered grass ahead of them, never quite settling in one place.
“Are you seriously telling me you’ve always known and you’ve never even mentioned it?” Sam sounds a little hurt and Dean flinches.
It’s an unseasonably warm day in March when they all head to an off-campus froyo place between lectures. Charlie and Stevie share, giggling over toppings and delighting each other with their shared likes. Dean and Cas, on the other hand, squabble like an old married couple over Castiel’s ongoing crusade to get Dean to eat more fruit. By the time Meg’s paid and sat at one of the tables to wait, Dean is trying to hide his ice cream inside his jacket to stop Cas putting fresh raspberries on it.
He can feel Sam looking down at him. Dean studiously stares into the cupboard where he’s supposedly trying to find the flour. It’s behind the sugar on the bottom shelf, Dean knows where every last ingredient is in his kitchen, but he’ll be damned if he turns and looks at Sam right now.
” Cas smiles so wide it hurts. “Your birthday is supposed to be one of the most important days of your life. I think this fits.”
Dean detaches one hand from Cas enough to give Meg a vehement finger, before pulling the duvet over his head and latching back on to Cas’ side.
Cas glances over at him, something bereft surfacing in his eyes, and Dean slides his left foot over to press against Cas’ right.
. Even that’s enough to get Dean blushing until his face burns. But then Cas starts saying Dean’s name instead, just
It’s been a couple of weeks since they brought Cas back from the empty. Since Cas answered Dean’s clumsy
to feel unsettled and embarrassed very time someone speaks to him. And they don’t make it easy, those popular kids with their ready disdain and their easy scorn.
Cas leans Dean against the doorframe while he turns on the bathroom light. Even in those two short seconds Dean sways, face turning grey and queasy.
He doesn’t even know their name, but the soft whisper of their soul against his feels like something he’s known since before he was born.
is haunted. Pulling her absurd story out of her is more for fun than because it’s a lead, but it’s making Dean happy so Cas leaves him to it.
For a few long minutes Dean just basks in that heat, kissing across Cas’ cheekbones, smoothing his hand down Cas’ chest, into the dip of his waist, luxuriates in the warmth spreading slow and heady through his limbs. Cas keeps making involuntary, breathy noises, sighing into Dean’s skin, and Dean drinks them in, feeds them to the growing fire in his chest.
“Bigger town, y’know.” He shoots Cas a grin as he pulls his shirt on. “Could pick up some nicer beers, scout out the bookstores. Find a fancy gardening place to get those seeds and things you want.”
this is something beyond the love Dean’s used to from the few times in his life he’s had anything to compare. This isn’t like Lisa, this isn’t like his mother. This isn’t anything like Sam. This is absolute. This is unfaltering. This is devotion on a scale that burns like a blasphemy because Dean is not, has never been, never will be worth anything
, he’s not letting Sam go there. It’s bad enough that Sam had to discover this whole clusterfuck at all without him thinking
The words feel feeble next to the solid certainty of Cas’ declaration. Not enough. Nothing like enough.
Hurriedly he bundles his school things into his satchel, tossing in a couple of books to give credence to his story. He’s downstairs again in less than five minutes, lacing his shoes in the hallway and watching Naomi out of the corner of his eye. She doesn’t look up, focused in on the financial pages of the paper, but there’s a harsh set to her mouth that he doesn’t like, so he slips out as swiftly and silently as he can manage.
Dean shuffles up behind Cas as he’s washing his face at the sink. He wraps his arms around him and leans so heavily that Cas staggers and braces himself on the counter. He looks up, sees the two of them reflected in the mirror.
Cas pulls the thread tight, ties it off neatly. Dean’s hand clenches on Cas’ shirt, then Cas is snipping the thread and sitting up. Dean relaxes marginally. He looks down at his side.
He pushes at Cas, treacherous hands tangling in Cas’ shirt and trying to pull him in at the same time.
“Dean, I-“ he says hesitantly, fingers twitching against Dean’s elbow. “I know you- you’re gonna need some time to be okay. And you’re probably never gonna let me talk to you about this again-“
He’s twisting his ring round his finger with his thumb, and Castiel’s briefly distracted wondering if that’s a nervous habit. It’s actually rather sweet. From his first look at Dean’s appearance, his beaten-up old boots and battered leather jacket and the way he holds himself to look bigger than he is, Castiel wouldn’t have placed him as at all anxious or shy. It had startled him at first, how at odds his bearing was with the way his emotions have always felt inside Castiel’s heart, but this, this nervous softness peeking through the façade, feels infinitely closer to the truth.
“Cas still isn’t my boyfriend!” Dean yells and Meg rolls her eyes for what feels like the hundredth time this trip.
From the way Cas sighs into him, hand scrabbling for purchase on Dean’s hip, clutching his hair, he thinks he does.
Content at last, Cas gives in to sleep’s siren song and lets his eyes finally, finally close. He’s just slipping under when Dean huffs a breath against his shoulder.
“Hello Dean,” Cas says. His eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles and Dean is helpless not to kiss the lines. He lingers against Cas’ face, breathing in the warm scent of his skin, noses gently into the curl of dark hair behind his ear. Cas’ fingers clench slightly in Dean’s shirt in response, sparking a flare of honey-gold heat that settles glowing in the base of Dean’s spine.
Cas finally manages to get Dean wriggled out of his jacket and flannel, then sets about peeling the blood-soaked t-shirt away from his skin. The wound underneath is just under his ribs, long but clean and not too deep, and Cas offers up an internal thanks for small mercies.
Cas glances down at the blanket burrito Dean has made of himself. All that’s visible are a couple of tips of his hair and the hand that’s got a death grip on Cas’ shirt.
Cas rolls his eyes, shoves Dean’s shoulder with his free foot, but his eyes crinkle like he’s trying not to laugh and Dean’s stomach fizzes with something effervescent and warm.
He’s sweaty and greasy to his elbows, but baby is purring smooth again, when his Cas alert twitches. He rubs an oily forearm over his forehead, straightens and turns just in time to catch Cas in the garage doorway, lowering his phone from taking a picture.
with being unmarked. It’s rare, but it happens often enough that meeting someone unmarked isn’t particularly strange. But still, society all too often treats them as if they’re bizarre, freaks of nature. Robots uncapable of human connection. It doesn’t take being unmarked himself for Castiel to loathe the casual contempt the unmarked are held in. His older brother Gabriel was unmarked, he remembers that even though Gabriel’s been gone for years, and Gabriel’s uncanny ability to charm every person he met within minutes had been enough to prove any stereotype a lie.
“Dean, get up here,” Cas demands. His voice is already rough with want, and the raw sound of it feeds straight into the fire growing in Dean’s groin.
Dean pauses with his mouth millimetres from Cas’ lips. “Do you ever have backgrounds that aren’t me?”
“About a week,” he replies. “It really hit you on Wednesday though, that’s when you stopped talking to me. It’s Saturday night now.”
Okay. Not hallucinating then. Somehow Meg dredges up some coherence from the bottom of the soup bowl this revelation has made of her brain.
When Dean’s not-quite-dad arrives, all trucker hat and flannel and epic beard, smelling of engine oil and stereotypes, he surprises Meg by yanking Dean into what looks like a bone-crushing hug and ruffling Dean’s hair with open affection. He does the same to Cas, asks Dean a gruff “these your idjit friends then, boy?”, and immediately orders them all into his truck so they can go out for dinner.
Cas slings Dean’s arm on his good side around his own shoulders and walks him out of the bathroom. Dean leans into him heavily, head resting against Cas’ and eyes closing before they even make it to sitting on the bed. Dean toes his own boots and socks off while Cas slowly manoeuvres him out of his ruined t-shirt. Shuffling him out of his jeans and into some clean sweats takes a few minutes more, and by the time Cas is helping him lie down Dean is mostly asleep, all clingy arms and half-closed, unfocused eyes.
Dean turns and finally sets off across the carpark, aiming for the door at the far end of the block. Castiel follows him, noting as they draw close that the curtains are drawn over the windows of the room Dean’s aiming for, and it looks like a blanket’s been pinned up over them too. Probably to try and insulate a room that’s too cold, Castiel thinks, and swallows down his heartache at the thought.
Castiel spares one quick flick of his eyes around the congregation. He knows with absolute certainty that none of the people he’s shared this church with for years can possibly be the person he feels against his soul – he’s known them all too long and too well to have any illusions about that – but perhaps there’s someone new. Someone he hadn’t noticed before.
Now they’re both naked, for a few seconds Dean lets himself admire Cas’ body. His flat stomach, muscled limbs, the scattered scars he’s acquired marking his chosen humanity. Dean’s seen Cas naked plenty of times now, but it never fails to awe him that he’s
“I’m okay.” Dean’s voice shakes. He rests his palm on the side of Cas neck, breathes in. Out. Tries again. “I’ll be okay.”
hurt. This will be Dean setting a match to Sam’s image of their childhood and throwing them both onto the pyre.
to think about it if the rest of the world weren’t focused on soul bonds to the point of obsession. They’re everywhere: in movies, in songs, in newspaper and magazine advertisements. Almost every ad Castiel has seen online has a shoehorned in soulmate couple hawking the product with plastered on smiles and colourful marks somewhere highly visible.
that he’d always longed for and could barely believe. He dreams of the mark ruling him so completely he doesn’t hold back, sees himself plunge the angel blade into Cas’ eye from inside his own body, powerless to stop it.
His soulmate’s concern rises again, more insistent this time. Castiel struggles to fumble together some kind of placatory response. He’s really too tired for any complicated back and forth of feelings right now. He tries for a simple
Cas stares up at them, taking in the delicate curl of the leaves, the blue bloom of the flowers. When he reaches up and touches one with a fingertip, the petals curl softly around his fingers.
It’s the first day they don’t slip away from each other at all. From that first touch to the moment he falls asleep, Castiel’s filled with rushes of tenderness, bubbling joy, a lazy comfortable warmth that makes Castiel feel as if he’s turned his face to the sun. It heats Castiel so completely that by lunchtime the chill of the morning might as well have been a bad dream. When his mind wanders in class, daydreaming as he watches the trees outside the window swaying in the breeze, the feeling turns teasing, amused at his distraction. Later, when he’s making himself pbj sandwiches in defiance of Naomi’s reminder to use up the leftover stew he doesn’t like for dinner and imagining himself in his own kitchen, his soulmate cooking next to him, close enough to touch, it’s bright and fond, so full of energy Cas finds himself bouncing on his heels and moving to a music he can’t hear. When he goes to bed that night, he falls asleep with sleepy warmth filling him up to the fingertips and a smile curling the corner of his mouth.
Meg eyes him, but she can’t detect anything but honesty in his open expression. She almost wants to push it further even with Dean right there, but then Cas appears, lowering himself onto the bench with a lot more grace than Dean bothered with, so she sighs and lets it drop.
Then Castiel realises the other man’s hands are trembling too. He’s staring down at his feet, breathing shaking enough that Castiel can hear it.
Then Castiel rolls his eyes. “You heard me. We might not be that into public displays of affection, but it’s still quite common for couples to kiss in public. And since we’re married…”
Then Cas looks up at Dean, eyes scrunched up in annoyance. “Dean,” he says in his most deadpan voice. “Your laces are problematic.”
So Castiel follows his heart. If that’s not the most sickeningly cliché nonsense he’s ever let himself think, Castiel doesn’t know what is. But there’s really no other way to put it. His soul bond is pulling so hard his heart feels like it could burst from his chest if he doesn’t go where it leads. So he walks.
“Why this?” Castiel whispers, turning his hand to compare the shifting green of his mark to the real amulet’s dull bronze sheen.
Cas can’t imagine what it means for home to be this. For it to be a parking lot strewn with rubbish, a single room at the end of a poorly maintained block shared with a brother with no space to call your own. He should offer some sympathy, empathy even, it’s not like he doesn’t know what it is to live in isolation and it might soothe some of the heavy resignation from Dean’s brow. But as Dean looks back round at him a question pops into his head and the moment he thinks it he can’t keep it in.
Pressing Dean down on to the bed, Cas lowers himself to sit beside him. He angles himself into Dean, close enough their knees bump, takes Dean’s hands and holds them wrapped in his own on his lap.
to do those things, because they were for you. It was the most terrifying thing I’d ever experienced.” He pauses, tilts his head in that achingly familiar way, shifts his other hand to rest over Dean’s heart. “And wonderful,” he adds softly. “Once I realised what it was I felt, it was wonderful too.”
Cas puts all the warning he can into the syllable. Musters all the strength he can find and pushes it into one clear, dangerous sentence. “Get in here and sleep right now or I swear I will smite you.”
turned out to be, loves him with all the force he used to bring to bear on a literal deity, and when he says Dean’s name like that, the sheer weight of that love could unravel Dean one atom at a time.
He has no idea where he got ideas so specific. He tries not to think about it too much. When he does, he prefers to hope it’s the universe telling him something, that it’s his dormant bond with that out there someone stirring gently in answer to his wondering. In his darker moments guilt sours the back of his tongue with the fear that he’s created this phantom figure out of thin air, and his real soulmate will be nothing like what he’s made up to comfort himself. How is he ever meant to look them in the eye if that’s true?
“Dean.” Cas tilts his head to the side to look Dean up and down. The movement is so achingly familiar Dean’s eyes burn with sudden tears. “Dean, what happened?”
Sam doesn’t respond for a second. Then his brow creases in his own frown as he blinks at the ceiling.
Meg bites the bullet and forces out the second question. Looking back on the last two years, she feels like she knows the answer to this one too, little as she wants to admit it to herself.
“Do you want to see mine?” Castiel starts rolling back his coat sleeve even before he’s finished speaking. Dean instantly nods vigorously, face lighting up all over again.
“Maybe take these off with the boots next time?” He echoes Cas’ teasing from earlier, picking up Cas’ foot and waggling it. “Just socks and shirt, not your best look.”
Cas’ brow creases in confusion. He looks down at his t-shirt. It is, indeed, Dean’s. Against his back, Dean gulps down his first mouthful of coffee and sighs happily.
