That last word, that dirty little word, nearly whispered, a secret between them. Those words in John's voice are all Sherlock needs, really, with the sight of John watching him so hungrily. He tenses, groans deep with satisfaction, and then spurts white over both their hands, splattering droplets on John's bare stomach.
John's body clenches around him in waves of sensation, milking his cock. He's faintly aware of the splatter of warm semen on his skin, smearing between them. It's all too much and it's like nuclear fission inside of him, the splitting of the atom, exothermic reaction and all behind his eyelids is flames and light and his body surrenders and he's coming with a harsh shout, spilling his seed deep inside the tight, perfect clasp of John’s little body.
He felt John shudder in response, a shudder that overtook his whole body.
Warm sun across his face. John saw bright red behind his closed eyes, blood red, even as he squeezed them tightly shut. Sunlight through his eyelids, lighting up the capillaries.
“Oh, you could have done that yourself!” Carl spat. “I’m being framed!”
It was not that Hogwarts wasn’t grand - for it was - and even he, at eleven years old, could sense the powerful magic tied into it, rooted into its foundation, drenching its walls. It was that he had forgotten about
!” Sherlock told the pillow. “There are crumbs and stains all over the pages! People will think
“Oh,” said John. “That’s true.” And then he smiled at Sherlock, which was fairly alarming because most people did not smile at Sherlock at all - not unless they were in fear for their lives and they thought some faked pleasantries might appeal to the small percentage of him they could consider human. Even then, it tended to be a disgusting, fearful little grimace. And yet here John was, healing from a concussion that he’d acquired on Sherlock’s behalf, face half-lit by the
Sherlock had been 16 at the time.
Dr. Berman paled and scribbled down some more notes that he thought Sherlock couldn’t read.
” wailed Bill.
Around the area of nothingness in space there is a mathematically defined surface known as the event horizon: the point of no return.
“I see,” said Professor Hudson. “And why would Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson have reason to ‘jump’ you, Mr. Powers?”
“And then what?” Harry prompted.
Two hours later, John was still at it. Sherlock had gone away and come back again twice. John barely even knew how to tinker with his layout. What could be so enthralling about a Tumblr?
dating?” John needs to know.
“Watch your step,” Sherlock said, as John narrowly avoided putting his foot directly onto a plate of something wet, brown, and putrefying.
"Sherlock," John says, eyes on their hands together. Sherlock’s hand covers his, practically engulfs it. Sherlock watching as well, the fascination of his fingers over John's, the size difference between them, John's small hand on his dick. John's eyes, wide and dark, flick up to his face. He is licking his lips again. "Sherlock, I want to...I want to see. What it looks like, when. When you come."
He pushed it in slowly, sliding along John’s tongue, drinking in the sight of John’s mouth wrapped around his cock. He rubbed it back and forth on the flat of John’s tongue, hissing at the soft wet slide on the underside of his cock, the way John’s tongue fluttered, just slightly, as he rubbed against it.
“You too," John insists, pushing himself up a little, fingers at the edge of Sherlock's shirt and tugging up. He lays his palm flat on the barest strip of skin revealed, pale flesh between hip and navel. His hand is so warm. "I want to see you."
“Sherlock’s not creepy!” John was quick to defend. “We met on the train and he was…nice.”
If he had the Galleons he’d pay a magical painter to paint a portrait of that look, for those blah days when he needed cheering up.
Sherlock’s got a new car. His other car was a bit older; hot rodded because back then cars weren’t made with so much power. (Towards the late 1950s-1960s they started making more powerful cars; the 1960s was the era of the muscle car. ) The 1958 Ford Thunderbird was the first T-bird model to have a backseat...you can bet Sherlock saw that and was like, “Oh hell yeah.”
“You know,” John says, picking a piece of beef out of his chow fun, “sometimes I don’t know why he did the things he did. Most of the time, actually.”
When Sherlock shifts his hands to John's hips to yank him down into the thrusts, John only rolls hips with a needy whimper. Like he's made for this. Just that thought makes Sherlock thrust harder, himself panting open-mouthed, beyond words for the moment. All for the best. Who knows what obscenities or atrocities or endearments could tumble out.
“Then we must make a contract,” said Sherlock.
Satisfied that John would stay where he’d put him, Sherlock started rooting around between the sofa cushions for something. John entertained himself with pinching and stroking at Sherlock’s abs and nipples while he watched, enjoying the hisses and gasps it won him. “Is now really the time when you desperately need to find the remote?” he asked.
warned Mike, dangerously.
Someone who was, somehow, sublimely unafraid of what might be going on, out in that dark night. Who possibly knew the answers to the mysteries that John had lived with his entire life.
“Oh, hello there, Watson,” Carl said, turning around to him, wand out and eyes bright. “Care to join in the festivities? Sherlock and I here were just playing a little game.”
These things were sadly all beyond him, and so Sherlock had to content himself with merely charting out John’s sleeping pattern as he waited for the moment when John would return to him, in the world of the conscious and thinking.
He resisted the urge to turn around and look. What would he see if he looked? There was nothing there. He was giving himself the heebie-jeebies, that was all. The house was too quiet, since Harry was at Clara’s for the night and his mother working a double shift. But it wasn’t like he’d never been home alone before.
“I have always been, as you remember, a precocious child.”
“Did I win?” John asked, panting, as he laid out on the cold flagstone floor. “I think I won.” Everything hurt and one eye was already swelling closed. He could feel something warm trickling down his cheek. “Did you hear that? He
The potion made John’s eyes feel very tired, and he leaned back against the pillows to close them for a bit. Sherlock was describing how one could accurately distinguish between Tangerine, Toffee, and Earwax beans, and John thought that this was a very important lesson to learn and keep with him for the rest of his life. It had to do something with the variation in speckle patterns, he told himself - the last coherent thought he had before he was slowly embraced by the healing arms of sleep.
The kettle began to whistle, and then it began to scream.
He looked
“Now, I’ve got to be off,” said Harry, snatching another chocoball off his plate, despite John’s loud protests. “You remember what I told you, all right, Pygmy Puff?”
“Sherlock!” John spluttered. He straightened up. “You can get yourself up.” With a noise of disgust, he turned and walked away, abandoning Sherlock, left all by himself on the floor.
Sherlock smirked in acknowledgement of John’s interest, dropping the belt, opening the button on John’s trousers and then tugging down the zipper.  The hiss of it sounded loud to John, despite the radio and the loudness of his own heart. John pushed his trousers down, stepping out of them until he was just in his briefs. If he hadn’t done it himself, Sherlock would have, he was sure. The way Sherlock was looking at him made him want to, ridiculously, cover himself up. Hands over his nipples and crotch or something. As if there could possibly be something here that Sherlock hadn’t seen before.
“I found a use for corn,” says Sherlock, and before John can really say that the corn isn’t really around just yet, Sherlock is kissing him, the way that he does, all hot and insistent, and before John can really kiss back, the way that he likes to, Sherlock is pushing him backwards and John loses his balance and they both end up tumbling down into the dirt.
“Thanks,” he said, beaming at the praise, beaming with relief. Her words eased a pressure from his chest, a fear he didn’t know how to name. “You look lovely,” he said, and kissed the back of her hand.
“That’s all right then,” Professor Hudson said approvingly. She apparently hadn’t heard. “A fresh start for all. You ought to shake hands on it.”
He slid his hand down the shaft of John’s prick and squeezed tightly, constricting him the way a cock ring would, preventing him from coming.
muttered happily under his breath. And now it seemed the ask system was another thing to add to the list. The moment John had returned from Tesco’s and unpacked groceries, he’d planted himself in his armchair and checked his blog.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I thought turnips were white,” her father said.
for posterity… “But it can’t be any wonder to you why I’d want a photo of us together.” One long finger slipped under John’s chin to tilt his face up. “Surely I’ve made it clear to you by now that no matter what you think of them, I see much more in any photo of you than you do?”
Mycroft is an Ivy Leaguer in every sense of the term, all rules and regulation and the perfectly-straight tie done up like a noose around his neck. Mycroft has always been taller than Sherlock, even after his growth spurt, and he has a way of looking down like you’re still that six year old child come crawling in from outdoors tracking mud on polished white tile and nothing Sherlock does will ever be good enough.
Sherlock loves the feel of John,  small and slim beneath him, the way his little body wriggles when his thumb rubs over the head of his dick. John bites his lip, which does nothing to hold back the traitorous little whimper that leaks out.
Up and down the street, the bells were ringing.
“But that’s what he
“But also oddly charming,” says John. “Kind of.”
“Well,” said John, “That’s just Billy.”
Sherlock hedges John against a wall and kisses him underneath a picture of an even younger John playing softball, presses him against a field of vinyl dandelions repeated over and over on buttery yellow. Sears catalogue 1949. When their hips press together John moans into his mouth and the heat in Sherlock’s body is so intense he is certain he could melt linoleum, set all the vinyl flowers aflame.
And then, as she got closer to the water, she saw him.
feeling that seemed to buzz underneath John’s skin, the voice in his head that told him to drop everything and
Of course, John considered, it was always possible that the information could be used for the forces of evil. You just didn’t know anymore, with anybody, and with what could be used to serve the shadowy forces of evil.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, “we can’t
He wanted to go to the window, felt the magnetic pull of it, of Sherlock and his liquid mercury eyes, the tug in his stomach that told him it would be a good thing, and his muscles strained in resistance.
His smile so languid and sure.  Something warm and foreign unfurled in the pit of John’s stomach; unexpectedly pleasurable. The young man splayed his hand against the insect screen, like a pale spider climbing up the mesh. “Won’t you let me in? Awful cold out here.”
A rush of terror, stifled scream in his throat, and he was twitching, another pulse of thin fluid wrung out of him. Then Sherlock’s voice was in his ear, shushing him, “Shh, shh,
Jeanette was different from all the other girls that John had known. The first time he met her she was smoking behind the school while the rest of her class was in gym. “Hey, bean,” she said, smiled like she wanted to sell him something, said, “Don’t be shy,” and beckoned him over. “Wanna try?” She’d waved a Lucky Strike at him, smudged pink with her lipstick.
) thudding against his flesh - Animalistic. Like he was being bred.
Sherlock was imagining, and why-
“You’re not going to get expelled,” Mike reassured him, “But on the off chance that you do, can I have your bed? I rather like that spot by the window, it’s really very nice.”
Sherlock’s voice - low, conspiratorial - enveloped John like the dark curtain of night. The two of them complicit in their secrets. John had never dared dream of wanting more.
He brushed the back of his fingers over John’s heated cheek, another fleeting touch that didn’t last nearly long enough.
Three little words, Irene had said. The easiest lie. Sherlock can see himself saying them, can taste the words in his mouth. He has certainly said them before to get what he wanted. But he opens his mouth to say them now, and he can't.
“for this is my blood, which shall be poured out for you-”
” Harry’s voice called, in the distance but coming nearer.
“How are you feeling, Johnny?” Momma asked him - her soft, gentle hand wiping his brow.
Instead he is being led to the toilets - the other kind of danger, then.
“What did you want to show me?” John asks when he catches up to him. “Well, other than the fact that you’re the best looking scarecrow for miles around.”
“I want to see you,” said Sherlock. He pulled back, pulled out, and with that withdrawal he wrenched a feeble soft noise from John’s lips just as the head of his dick caught on the rim of his hole, before that was tugged out as well. John felt empty, open without it. Not so tight anymore. With equal parts horror and pride, he thought, I might never be the same.
"It does if they are less beans," Mike informed him sagely.
he get stitches?” Sherlock asked Madam Pomfrey eagerly.
There was an uncertain moment where all boys involved internally debated whether it was possible to deny that an all-out wizard’s battle royale had been impending. Perhaps they could suggest that they had only had their wands out as a friendly start to the new-fangled popular schoolyard game
“I don’t know,” Bill said ominously, “but probably.”
John pushes Sherlock's hands away whenever they wander too far down south, and more's the pity. "Just kissing," he'll say again, with his mouth red and softly swollen from hard kisses, blue eyes nearly black with arousal, skin flushed and a boner tenting his pants that could clearly be seen from the next county over. "
five more times that autumn, until it was pulled from the theater and replaced with
Sherlock leaned over John’s back so that John could feel the heat of him, the firmness of him. John could feel the softness of Sherlock’s grease-streaked shirt, the roughness of the denim of Sherlock’s jeans against the back of his thighs, the metallic coolness of the car against his skin, coolness underneath his chest and stomach and thighs.
“Oooh,” said John. He was impressed, Sherlock could tell, from the soft way he breathed the sound and leaned in, just a little. “I’ve never read
By now, however, the students had already split up into their groups, working in pairs and threes; divvying up the tasks amongst them, taking notes and gathering ingredients.
Hogwarts had a serious problem: it was swarming with idiots. It was
The bowl of the spoon dripped with a thick coating of honey; John’s tongue twirled through it -  pink, wet, and mobile.  He sucked and lapped carelessly, unaware of the performance he was putting on, or that he could probably get away with charging a viewing fee.
Hazel could not tell him. She sobbed and sobbed, trembling with that which she did not understand.
Tonight was a favor to Harry, John says later, when they are back in the car and parked. This is fine.
Sherlock chuckled at John’s attempts to move his hips, to increase the friction and speed. “You’re at my mercy like this.” To illustrate, he shifted his hips, side to side and in little circles. John whined, able only to lie there and take it. Heat flooded him at the thought, his prick twitching where it lay, so hard that it rested on his stomach. His face reddened at how much it turned him on.
the worst,” Mike groaned.
“James Dean is cool,” John says, and Sherlock almost shoves him out of the bed.
Sherlock wouldn’t mind.
“It’s a shame when people are Sorted wrong, isn’t it?” said Violet Smith, who John had thought was rather pretty until she said that. She tossed her long blonde hair. “Maybe we can petition to have traitors transferred.”
The last chain was retrieved from under the bed. Sherlock clipped it to the cuffs at John's ankles, chaining them together with a small distance in between. John's wrists were released and they both became distracted for a moment as the first thing John did with his temporary freedom was to grab at Sherlock to kiss him, hands running through Sherlock's hair. Sherlock imagined he could still taste his cock on John's tongue, and groaned into the kiss.
“Yes, yes, of course I have.”
In bad dreams
“Ah, the House traitor,” Carl sneered. “Big talk from tiny little filth.”
They laughed together, and then kissed, John’s hands on his shoulders clutching just a little too hard, still needing to feel the solidity of one another.
“I could try and get you some bubble wrap,” said John. “It’s exactly like popping these things...except without the pus and the wriggling and the petrol farts. They don’t explode, though.”
“But, Harry—!”
Sherlock didn’t have to worry about the future.
“You’re not much good at Potions either,” said Sherlock, who was clearly on a streak at pointing out all of John’s deficiencies.
“Have you heard these songs? Have you listened to what your children are listening to? These songs that tell of the allure of the dark. They say, ‘Tonight is Right for Love.’ They say, ‘I Need Your Love Tonight.’ They make the darkness romantic. They encourage rebellion. They tell our children to break the rules.”
John kicked at the water, making a little splash and letting out a big sigh. He put his chin in his hands and he wished, hard, so very hard, for Sherlock to come back.
“Okay, that’s all. I wanted you to know. I have to go now, goodbye!” Sherlock said. He flashed Mycroft one of his quicksilver smiles, turned on his heel, and ran out of the room again - a small tornado of a boy, leaving a bemused brother in his wake.
“Oh, it’s so nice to have friends,” remarked Professor Hudson, quite pleasantly, as she turned to the remaining three boys. The next thing she said, however, while still in that pleasant tone, sent a horrid little chill wriggling down John’s spine like an icy caterpillar.
In his first three weeks of school?
There could come a time, one day, when they will no longer kiss like this. There may come a time Sherlock might not want to kiss him like this.
“No, no,” John would reply. “The one with the dog was Pamela.” (Or was it Suzy?) “And I did break up with her. I’m seeing Jeanette now.”
A busy thrumming inside of him. John bit his lip.  He felt himself all wound up, like a top about to spin out. Nobody could stay in this state forever; it was madness. And he could not help looking down at Sherlock’s mouth, remember how it had felt to have those soft lips pressed against his own, that heart-curling warmth and pleasure, how it might feel, if they could do it again. And again. He wanted to find out.
He stepped to the side, allowing John to pass.
“Okay, ‘dating’ or
“Not that rich,” Victor shrugs. “Mostly spoiled.”
It had been three years, six months, three weeks, and five days since he’d last felt sick.
He gave John a shove to push him to the side, and then made to kick at Sherlock again. In this he made his fatal mistake: he turned his back on John Watson.
Sherlock rocked his cock in and out, the movements smooth at first, made easy by lubricant. Of course the slow rhythm couldn’t satisfy him for long, as he was as ever impatient, surrounded by the wet, welcoming warmth of John’s insides, and soon he began to pick up the pace, bodies smacking together.
, exactly?”
He can feel the stretch of John's body around two slick fingers; watches, with fascination, the sight of the virginal little hole taking something in for the first time. John whines with discomfort, but no real distress.
“It was Harry,” John says - Harriet, of course, and John is the only one in their family who calls her the way she prefers. “That morning she had been out to collect the eggs, which she hated, and I made her do it because it was her turn, and if I hadn’t seen it in time then...I don’t know what, then. They get crazy when they’re that starved.”
Sherlock made a little sound of disgust. “We’re not naming the slug
“Of course, let’s not get too crazy with this,” she added quickly. “For your own safety, little brother. You might still want to tell people we’re second cousins twice removed.”
“Well,” Bill said primly, with forced casualness, “you know what
“Jeanette. You know. Tall, dark hair, grey eyes, slim.” John would not say beautiful, although she was.
Despite John’s attempt at nonchalance, there was no mistaking that sharp intake of breath. Sherlock had to fight back a grin; John looked adorable when he got shifty. His eyes were too large to make furtiveness look anything but comical. “What are you proposing?”
John nodded along, very seriously. He tried not to notice the cross hung above the door, with Jesus’s wooden face, small and sorrowful.
“No! It was nothing like that!” John shrugged her off, cheeks warm with embarrassment. “I got caught up reading on the library, and when I was coming home, my….”
. Although to be fair, Sherlock generally thought all ideas to be good, especially when they were his own. Mycroft often took the opposite stance, because he was contrary like that, and utterly unreasonable to boot. He was a terrible old bore whose whole purpose in existence was to stifle genius, and Sherlock had told him so. When that hadn’t worked, Sherlock had whinged and he’d whined, he’d pouted and thrown a strop, and finally, as a trump card, he’d resorted to telling Mycroft what Victor Trevor had done to his inkwell, with just a hint of tears glittering in his wide, pale eyes.
Her hands come together, wringing out worry between them, twisting tighter and tighter.
When John looked at the map with Sherlock he could see possibility unfurled before them. He could close his eyes and point his finger at any destination, and they would be able to go.
“Even if we could convince anyone to tutor you for any extended period of time, you’re not going to be taught all the essentials of magic and wizardry from tutors, Sherlock. You need the structure of a wizarding institution.”
Time slowed, stilled, crystallised. They felt each other breathe. They were, the both of them, in perfect singularity.
Greg Lestrade was notorious for his Gryffindor Spirit and ardent House Pride. Rumour had it that two years ago, when Slytherin had beat Gryffindor in the last Quidditch match of the season, it had taken three Prefects and a Professor to keep Lestrade from throwing himself into the lake. He was also the most brutal and tyrannical Quidditch Captain Gryffindor had seen in seventy-eight years, they said - it wasn’t a true Greg Lestrade practise unless one team member was sent to the Infirmary for exhaustion.
John watched Sherlock sit at the counter and order a strawberry milkshake even though he really preferred chocolate malts. Sherlock looked up; their eyes met. It was magnetic, that pull. North pole to south pole. He felt it tugging at his core. His insides were hot magma.
“Don’t you dare go near the water,” Harry warned him, “you just sit here and...build sandcastles or something, whatever it is you do.” She was meant to look after him, Mummy said, but John didn’t know how much looking after a person could do when her eyes were very busy looking at this pretty girl with warm brown skin and dark hair, and her pretty little pink polka-dot bikini.
“John, please,” Sherlock said, “Don’t waste your breath. If you wish for this crowd to understand you, you must speak excruciatingly slowly and use very, very small words. You’re also using logic, which seems beyond them. ”
Father Pike stood at the pulpit, arms wide as if to embrace his parishioners. His voice resonated through the church, filling the cavernous space.
"Didn't they say his mother was a house elf?" Mike said, in what John was certain was a terribly misguided attempt to be helpful. "I'm sure it was that."
His heart was still pounding after the lights went back on, his breathing just a little bit faster. The daylight was especially bright when he stepped outside. Oh
Dripping down from the crown of thorns, and the priest was still talking-
If the collapsing star manages to hold onto a critical amount of  mass, the material of the star is squeezed down into the singularity of one of these regions of impossible pull.
John snaps a picture with his new Polaroid camera. It had cost him $69.95 - a year’s worth of scrimping and saving $1.19 a week, of completely forgoing comic books and milkshakes and trips to the penny arcade. It is his pride and joy. Sherlock, who has suddenly found himself the main muse of a budding young photographer, absolutely hates it.
“You know,” Sherlock said, “for someone who was so determinedly straight for so long, you certainly love to have my cock inside of you, filling you up.”
“Yes, yes,” said Hazel, who needed to get away. Away from the ocean with its small, grasping hands.
Sherlock pushed away from John’s body to hover over him, up on his arms for better leverage. His hair was a chaotic cloud and his face was flushed pink with the force of his arousal, with a crease of concentration between his brows and that lush lower lip caught intently between his teeth. He was the most glorious, wild thing John had ever seen. The idea that it was all because of
“All right,” says Harry. “Or who, then?”
“Yeah, can I?” asked John, curious to see what Magical stitches would be like. Maybe they would sew themselves, or dissolve into his skin, or maybe they were made of dragon guts or something.
“Fine,” he finally said. “You may keep your slug in the bedroom as long as it remains as far away from your bed as logistically possible,
My baby boy, oh no no no no no no nono…”
Sherlock had chuckled. “No, no. You misunderstand the finer points of the lingo. Bad means
It was natural, of course, for a pleasant little cottage house near the shores of West Wittering beach, populated by a family of four (six if one included the dog and cat), to come upon its fair share of sand. Particularly during the summer months, and particularly when that family of six included a quite rambunctious young girl and a very active small boy along with the dog and the cat.
Sometimes John dreams of a night where he could run forever. The London sky is bright with stars, and the unknown planets dance in enigmatic revolutions. He grips someone’s hand in his, their fingers tightly entwined.
count, right?”
Good girls, of course, did not cut class and they did not smoke anywhere - not behind the school or underneath the bleachers or behind the arts building. Jeanette was wholly uninterested in what good girls were meant to do. She got thrown out of Home Ec one morning after she got into a fight with Mrs. Bellamy, shouting that she would rather
“Must be nice to be rich,” John says. The milky liquid ripples. Slight rattle of the spoon on the plate. John holds his left hand still with his right and sets the cup of tea down.
The detention activity that afternoon consisted of collecting Bubotuber pus into bottles; a task that sounded far easier and more pleasant than it actually was. The main stem of the plant writhed of its own volition, as if in sheer discomfort from the ripe yellow pustules that dotted its slimy black body. They both had to wear their Dragon-hide gloves to protect their skin from the caustic effects of the pus. When the pustules burst, the acrid smell of something resembling petrol filled the air - “As if the Bubotuber farted,” John noted. Sherlock told him this was impossible, of course, as a Bubotuber was not a type of plant that possessed an intestinal tract or an anus.
She touched it with trembling fingers, and breathed out deeply. “Oh thank goodness, it’s dried. Does it hurt?”
In London, Sherlock says, on Cannon Street, there’s a stone set in the foundations of the city and people say that if ever that stone moves, London will crumble to dust.
) so that Hazel would get fake-annoyed and make the children laugh.
“Fall means that winter’s not far behind,” reasoned Sally. “It all means the same thing, being cooped up and miserable. For the next six months! Not allowed to go anywhere. Not allowed to have any
His hands slipped back to wrap around John’s buttocks and tug him tighter against Sherlock. John couldn’t help squirming, caught between the words and the squeeze to his arse. “I can make you come so hard, you’ll forget how to form words. I know all this just by observing you. All I need to know is your body, John, and I know it. I’ve been watching it for a long time, and I’d say that yes, by now, I am a sex expert when it comes to you.”
It was driving Hazel a little batty, to be quite honest, but she supposed that these things were par the course if one lived with two children, and a cat and a dog, in a quaint little house by the sea.
“I used to believe in ghosts, when I was little,” John offers, when the credits roll. “Deathly afraid of them.”
Hazel shook; she could not stop shaking. She put her face in her hands. There was an ocean in her tears, the ocean on her tongue, heavy and bitter with salt.
rather rude when I can clearly see how much you need my cock in your mouth.”
Everything, as they say, gets easier with practise.
“Of course I do, Sarah, of
“Because he’s a psychopath,” Sally explained, as if she were speaking to a particularly intelligent piece of dusty fluff. “Psychopaths get bored.”
“Who knows why he did anything, really,” Victor says.
"Open your eyes and look at me," Sherlock says, suddenly overcome with irrational need. He needs John to see him, to know who was fucking him, taking him, claiming him. As if it could be mistaken. As if it could be anybody else. But he cannot allow for even that miniscule improbability, the tiny margin .0001% of doubt.
“Oh, just call me Greg,” said Greg, smiling at him. John didn’t know whether he should trust his smile, but then again, Greg was a Gryffindor, not a Slytherin, and usually Gryffindors didn’t smile like that if they were about to rip one’s head off.
“Then it’ll be easy to sell. I don’t care. I want to move away, we need to get away from the sea.”
“Nothing below the waist,” Sherlock promises. He is ready to promise anything, really.
gastropodic and slimy. Sherlock was not sure if two eyestalks and some sort of indiscernible mouth-opening met the requisite qualifications of “cute little face” and he knew for sure that slugs did not possess the emotional capacity to be adoring.
, like it was graven into his face and body too deeply to ever be erased. The crinkles of his forehead deepened and his eyes, their luminosity cloaked, sank deep into the shadows under his brow. It was as though life had punched him in the face till it had left permanent marks.
To this day no one knows what happened to the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke...it was as if the entire settlement had simply vanished into thin air.
It turned its head and looked directly at her. Those horrible lambent eyes burned like coals in the darkness; they were burning, staring at her.
precious baby beekitten
"Don't tell me it's a case," John groaned.  Under his breath, he referred to DI Lestrade with a few choice phrases, which may or may not have included 'sodding cockblock' among them.
They didn't meet at the funeral, although they had both been there. Then again, John does not remember much about the funeral. It was a possibility that he had met Victor then, that Victor had been amongst the throngs of strangers who had taken John's hand in theirs and given their condolences, squeezing his hand just so. “I’m sorry for your loss,” they’d said, pitched in different voices, doled out in different levels of sincerity; variations on a theme. They came in clusters, in twos and threes; they came alone, looking around as if unsure where to go. They had been past clients and gawkers and press. There had been so many unknown faces that John did not even recognise the ones that he did know.
robes surely had to be.
John made a strangled sound in response, deep in his throat.  He shook his head;  with his mouth plugged up, he couldn’t say a word. With his cheeks flushed deep pink, he couldn’t lie. His dick twitched, drooling a trickle of precum, making it shiny and wet.
John let Sherlock slide an arm around his waist and pull him close. “I’m sure you can,” John said, and they shared a wry smile. Sherlock could think of many things, and none of them were usually any good. “But it’s...really. It’s not you.”
He told him about the size of whales, like giants, and how they sang to one another, the songs travelling great distances in the ocean. He told him about jellyfish, drifting slowly, gracefully through the water - some of them small, little translucent moons they could fit in the palms of their hands (but watch out for the sting, John); some of them metres and metres long, their tentacles streaming like colourful ribbons behind them. He told him how he saw a new kind of jelly every day, and how he catalogued them, and he figured, at this rate, he would have to be fifty before he saw them all.
” breathed out.
The paper was already folded open to the latest update on the new NHS policy. John tilted his head a bit to read the second line, blowing absently on his still-steaming tea.
’ - happily, eagerly, ‘
“You must have a very good reason now, to subject yourself to the horror of such awful decor,” John said, cuddling on top of him. It was not a bad position for him to be in, all things considered. It was particularly nice to consider the way their bodies rubbed together whenever John shifted around.
“You haven’t had tea for a while,” not-Sherlock said. It was true: never finishing the pot of tea, always pouring out the second cup. Tea made John think too much. Too many cases mulled over tea, blog entries tapped out to a hot cuppa; and then there were quiet moments besides: the two of them at home at any given evening, Sherlock’s tea going cold while he worked on an experiment but insisting that John make it for him regardless, every time. And then, in the empty time after: too many cups of tea brewed just for the sake of something resembling normal, and then the fear that one cup, John all by himself, would become normal again. There were the evenings where he sat looking into the steam, into the cup, like it could tell him what his future held, like he could watch the past play out, until it went cold in his hand. He would end up pouring it down the sink. He had felt himself all poured out. It was such a waste.
No pictures of family in John’s room, only movie posters.
He kissed her on her soft pink mouth - not too long, nice and sweet - and bade her goodnight. He watched her unlock the door, and waited to be sure that she was safely inside. It was the gentlemanly thing to do, after all.
Professor Hudson pointedly cleared her throat.
She looked at the door and then back at him, dropped her eyes and asked, wouldn’t he maybe like to come in for a while?
“It’s not funny,” John said, putting himself between Carl and Sherlock. “Stop it. And give Sherlock his books and homework back!”
“No!” Bill cried, aghast. “If John gets expelled no one is allowed to take his bed! We shall keep it exactly as it is, forever, to honour the memory of our sweet John Watson, taken from us far too soon.”
Sherlock scoffed and looked down at his heavy textbook again.
. She's fairly new to fandom and incredibly talented! Go on and give her a follow!
Carl winced. “B-but Professor! You can’t! That’s our chances at the Cup, right there!”
She grabbed a clotted-cream and strawberry-filled chocoball off John’s plate, popping it into her mouth. “Harry!” John protested. Those were his favourites, and he’d been saying them for last.
“Exactly,” smiled John. “That’s the word!”
In Missouri there had been Graham Cave, a wide sandstone arch 100 meters into the hillside; the haunted Lemp Mansion (deemed not all that haunted by Sherlock); and the Patee House, one of the stops of the Pony Express. In the gift shop, John had picked up a figurine of a small man in a cowboy outfit riding a small horse.
“There’s room enough for at least six people here,” John said, clutching his books a little tighter against his chest. “Who’s it taken by, another Quidditch team? Because the Gryffindor one’s already sitting down.”
Quiet, all around them - the night, the house, silent with sleep. No sound of crickets, the insects having passed on with the death of summer, only the whisper of the wind in the trees.  Even the lights in the neighborhood had gone dark, and the stars flickered out of existence.
In a cool world
“Well, yeah, dummy, but it could have easily been me who was out sneaking about late at night. When did you get the bad boy reputation? Has all my hard work been for nothin’?”
, but Stamford, you really ought to know better,” he chided. Mike stared back at him blankly. “
John nods, relieved. He hadn’t wanted to come back here, but now that he’s back, the thought of leaving seems just as abominable.
Eager to test his hypothesis, he twisted at the little nub. John responded with a hiss of indrawn breath and another squirm.
” with the most scorn that John has ever heard anyone muster up for a vegetable.
“Good,” said Mike. “Because I’m sure your drowning would only cause us to lose
John follows Sherlock down the staircases, one flight after another, deeper and deeper into the earth. A cool draft is blowing as if the wind is following behind them; a whistle in a well. The temperature in here is about ten degrees cooler than outside. John had always thought it would be hot underground; a childhood misconception gleaned from his Aunt Aggie, who frequently terrified both John and Harry with tales of the eternal fires of Hell burning beneath their feet.
He supposed he deserved it.
John didn’t even bother to ask Sherlock how he knew his future career plans when he had little to no idea himself. That wasn’t all that important. The more pressing question was whether it was worth asking Sherlock to be his partner again. The likelihood of Sherlock saying no again was as high as the highest point of a Bouncing Bulb’s trajectory (which was, to John’s experience, quite high). He didn’t want to the bumbling partner who sabotaged Sherlock’s perfect grade.
The smell in the room is of heat and sex, heavy and alkaline.
“Well. I suppose that’s all right,” said Sherlock. He then reached over to turn down the fire on the cauldron, as he suddenly felt overly warm.
He woke sweating, shivering, feverish; sheets tangled up around his legs, blankets kicked off the bed. He woke rigid in his pants, and as exhausted as if he hadn’t slept at all.
“Now that’s an interesting term of endearment,” Sherlock smirked. John could have hit him, awkward position be damned, but then Sherlock shifted them again. He tucked John’s legs more securely up to the side so that they caught at his shoulder and the top of the sofa, and, finally, bloody
“Welcome,” Jeanette said, making a grand, sarcastic gesture. Her presence was too big for her picturesque little home;  she clashed with the butter-yellow wallpaper, the baby-blue vase of daisies on the coffee table. Next to the daisies sat the August issue of
Only the long pulls in and out of him, the relentless thrusting. Suddenly he saw -
They drove around London, taking the long way back to Baker Street to rack up the meter. Sherlock did not call attention to it.
“Totally ew,” Bill agreed solemnly.
“Ughhhh,” said John, and nearly put his face into a pudding.
The lights flickered in the library, indicating that it was due to close soon. John looked up from where he sat, cross-legged on the carpet between the aisles of books, deep into the stacks. There was no sign of the librarian. He had a few more minutes, he reasoned, he could at least finish the story.
John has painted his room the blue of summer skies, and covered the walls with posters. There is one of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. The rest of them make his room look like a budding mini-cineplex.
“Momma-!”
He pushed up the screen.
The sound of the front door slamming shut awakened Hazel in bed one night. They always locked the front door at night, and so she froze, the muscles in her arms and her chest hard and tense, listening in the darkness.
Warning! Shounen ai schoolboy AU,  and all that entails
For dinner they had zucchini bread and zucchini pie with the stew. The children surprisingly enjoyed the pie, even though John declared it “very too much green.”
“Yeah,” John whispered, caught out. “I kind of miss my mum. And my bed. And home.”
“Well, I imagine he was different back then,” John admits.
“Hello?” John called, uncertain, into the darkness. His own voice echoed back at him from the depths of the cave.
The engine thrummed beneath his thighs.
"Oh," John said, suddenly unsure. Something about the way Sherlock was talking made John realise that he didn't want John to come just for a little while, just for dinner or a sleepover.
"Extraordinary," Sherlock praises, pressing kisses against John's face, kisses against his neck. Soothes him with press of mouth against heated skin as he forces him open, stretches him with his cock.
even if he wanted it, and his own helplessness makes his body shudder, a reaction as involuntary as the galloping beat of his heart.
And Sherlock would make him beg -
?” he heard one of John’s friends whisper far too loudly to be discreet.
Sherlock felt the music well up in, pour out of him, flood the room with effortless, fluid grace. He was playing better than he ever had before. His body thrilled with the attention, and the open admiration in John’s face sent a sharp spike of pleasure directly to the dopamine receptors in Sherlock’s brain.
“Now,” Sherlock said, pale eyes laughing and bright, “let me look at you.”
“Thanks,” John said, as his other foot came down with a crunch.
Mouth pressed into a thin line, John set his tea carefully down on the floor next to his chair. In the next moment, the tea went flying as John did too, launching himself at Sherlock.
.” He’d been waiting for over a week to get his hands on that book, as it was in the Restricted Section of the Library, and it had required quite a bit of work on his part to acquire it. Mycroft considered it inappropriate reading. “You’ll get far too many ideas,” he’d said, without even specifying whether the ideas were
“Yes,” says Sherlock, and he says,  “
wild, with Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth, desire like a fist twisting, tightening in his gut, the two of them kissing out in the open. He brought his hands up and pushed at Sherlock’s chest as if he were trying to get away, but not hard enough to actually dislodge him. Sherlock growled and gripped John’s back to hold him closer, keep him from going anywhere. He was kissing hard enough to bruise and John felt himself harden instantly in his trousers.
"I walked in and spoke to you," says Sherlock.
“I would never put it on the internet,” Sherlock lied easily. Well, he certainly wouldn’t flash it around; those were
“What does it mean?” he asked, in the way that children do when they expect an adult to have all the answers.
Although the hunger was a factor, too, as he stood there, unable to find a seat.
“You’ve seen
And John closes his eyes and listens: to the rhythm of Sherlock’s breath, how it hitches and catches. He listens to the loudness of his own heart, and remembers, all over again, how to breathe.
“Gruesome tales, and ghosts-”
He was fairly sure that this was how girls worked.
Suddenly, darkness. The room plunged into night.
“Sherlock!” came a familiar little voice, breathless, and Sherlock’s head snapped up to see John Watson, with his hair mussed and his robes streaked with grey stripes of dust. His shoes were untied.
It was disgraceful, really. John was probably two drinks away from dancing on the bar.
things with it, like talking about sentimental matters. He made a sound that could have been loosely interpreted as “Do we really have to do this?”  He would have much rather slept, which was saying something. Or had sex again, of course, which should always be included on any list of options when options were available (and even when they weren’t).
“You’re mine,” he said to John, hot and panting into his ear, one hand reaching down between them to find John’s cock, hard and hot and leaking, aching for his touch. He grinded the head of his hard flesh right into the bump of John’s prostate to feel him tremble and to see him cry out.
wanted. He relented.
Forensics would later find the bullet in the wall, and from the angle of penetration into the suspect’s skull, from the path it had tunnelled through the no-longer functioning brain tissue, investigators would be able to deduce the trajectory of the shot fired. Later on, when the reports were filed, the time of the shot fired would coincide with the arrival of the SCO19 Response Team. One SFO in particular, Ms. Verona Jackson (collar #547) would confirm that she had indeed fired her weapon on scene out of necessity in a hostage situation, and would document appropriately. Afterwards, she would be sent to after-action stress debriefings per the standard operating procedures. The mental health of any officer is just as crucial as his or her physical health.
John sneaked another peek at his watch.
“John,” said Bill, “I know we had a disagreement earlier and I would like to give you something.”
“Shh, I’ve got you,” Sherlock says, and he wraps his hand around John’s throat.
“Dark Wizard sympathiser!” Carl accused.
The new church was rebuilt in stone and loomed imposingly over its congregation with its sharp spire that seemed to reach for Heaven. Outside, the white signboard reminded everyone “
“Get away from me!” John cried, as Sherlock snapped a closeup of his forehead and hairline.
“Well,
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Firstly, what’s the point of us giving it a respectable name if you’re only going to butcher it, and secondly, that is
“Yes,” said John, “but Rocky’s special. He’s
The moon was chasing them, through the blurring branches of the trees. Moving like quicksilver. John’s breath caught in his throat with how fast they were driving. They were passing all manner of country, that dark landscape of September into October country, the trees with their grasping branches and the insect-skittering of leaves.
“Oh,” said John, when Sherlock determined that he could safely remove his hand. “I’m still here?” John asked.  Which was, of course, a stupid question, but was a better question than “why am I here?” which would indicate some sort of traumatic memory loss.
Being alone was just fine. He worked better alone, anyway.
, really, he had wanted her to think of him well.
“You’re
“Are you scared?” Sherlock asked him.
Sherlock caught him looking once. He’d caught John watching himself being watched,  and Sherlock, he’d smirked, just a twist of his lips that somehow made something reflexively twist inside John’s body, as if the two could be somehow connected. Sherlock’s lips, John’s body. Oh God. What a connection to make. He’d tingled all the way up to and through last period, and when he got home later, he couldn’t make sense of any of his notes from that day.
Sherlock’s thumb stroked gently over the inside of his wrist, tracing over the vein - taking his undoubtedly-quickening pulse. John held his breath.
He wanted to own it, to be bold, but he let Sherlock push him back until his bare bottom hit the cool metal of the hood of the car. "It's the way you look when you blush," Sherlock said, and John didn't understand, didn't care to understand. Sometimes Sherlock spoke in non sequiturs.
ago! Honestly, one would think people would be a little more forgiving of a six-year-old. )
“You don’t know what you could have, if only you had the courage to ask for it.”
“I don’t wanna hear it! Eat your breakfast, John, and Harry, don’t talk with your mouth full, and both of you hurry it up. It’s quarter past seven already and if you don’t get going soon you’re going to be late for homeroom.”
A million thanks to
“Fine, thank you. Yourself?” John responded, ever polite; his good manners second nature. Momma had raised him well, after all. Sherlock smirked, clearly amused, and John could only groan inwardly at his own square-ness.
Sherlock wants to rub out all those old scars and marks. He wants to cover them with his own. He would rub them out with hands and fingers, with mouth and tongue. With teeth. He would rub and rub at the skin until John forgot them, until all John would remember was Sherlock's touch on him.
“Oh, yes,
It didn’t make any sense. He’d been certain he’d placed it into his pocket earlier that day. He’d worried it over and over in his fingers as if he were trying to polish brass into gold.
“No, Sherlock! A proper name.”
Sherlock was in his room, no more barriers between them. Like something uncaged.
It was probably messy in there, because the hat seemed to  be taking a very long time. Maybe it was trying to decide whether to put Sherlock in Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, because surely it knew that it would be a crime to deprive them of a future full of adventures, of winning Quidditch matches together and winning the House Cup. It would be a travesty. It should be illegal, really.
The children talked about their time in the garden; John said that he had seen at least five ladybugs, but Harry had him outnumbered with seven butterflies. They were all amused by a story about the Peterson’s young billy goat jumping his enclosure and wandering his way into town.
“And after you’re all better,” Madam Pomfrey said, “then perhaps you’ll be in a suitable enough state to meet with your Head of House to discuss your punishment.”
John wanted to be reassured that no one would see. The Holmes residence was secluded by the neat rows of trees that surrounded the property, the garage off to the side, located at the end of a long driveway that sloped uphill. Still, he allowed himself to imagine that anyone could be driving up the quiet little street, even at this late bewitching hour. Any nosy neighbor could be peering out of their windows, unable to sleep. Sherlock lived in such a nice neighborhood, full of big white houses with even bigger yards. His neighbors would either call the police or drop dead immediately from a heart attack. John wasn’t sure which was better.
It was Friday afternoon and there was a crowd gathered near the Library, which was John’s first clue that something was drastically out of sorts.
,” Harry hissed, and grabbed John’s wrist to drag him along. “Come here - oh my god, is that blood?” Her face paled as she lifted his arm up, noting the streaks of red down to his elbow. “Bloody hell,” she swore, and John gasped at her bad language. “There’s so much! Did you cut yourself? How did you do that?”
“There was something there. It was...it was some sort of creature.”
The sun shone through the window, casting rainbow flecks of color upon the parishioners. Bits of green and blue upon the carpet, drops of red upon the parishioners.
"One day I'm going to teach you how to suck my cock," Sherlock says, two fingers rubbing in and out. "It might be uncomfortable at first. Most people have a gag reflex. But I'll teach you, and we'll practice until you can take it all the way down your throat. We'll go slow. Would you like that? My cock stretching your mouth? I'd like to see your lips wrapped around me."
Carl had not arrived alone: he was flanked by an older Ravenclaw boy on one side, and a Hufflepuff boy on the other. John remembered that the Hufflepuff was a bedwetter called Anderson. He felt bad that he remembered the first fact before the second, but then Anderson spoke.
“I...um…” John began, but his tongue stopped working when the young man looked him up and down, slowly, in a way that nobody had ever looked at John before. It made him feel funny, like he was being appraised, and hot under the collar for no reason whatsoever.  John took a step back.
your position of punching Carl Powers in the face, but on the other hand, I am very
“I had my first kiss to this movie,” Victor says. “In the theatre, of course. I was so dumbfounded I could barely pay attention to the rest of the film.” He looks at John with mock-seriousness, arching one brow. “That pottery scene is no joke.”
“I shall transfer, then! This is a terrible school, Mycroft. They don’t even offer a course in Piracy. Durmstrang offers a course in Piracy, don’t they? That’s where the Viking wizards came from.”
“Is that what you wanted to discuss? Cats?” Sherlock would tease. “Now why would you want to talk about cats when there are so many more subjects of interest in this world?”
In the end he could not will his feet to move. They seemed heavy, stuck to the pavement, with the trees whispering around him and those headlights shining bright like yellow moons growing ever closer and surely it would just drive on by, surely it had not come for him -
John’s face as red as the T-bird but the shame not enough to stop him. Cheek pressed against the cool metal of the car; head down, ass in the air , presenting himself.
How hotly and easily he comes against Sherlock, his heart filling with reverence for something unnameable. He thinks about how he wants to drop to his knees and so he does, languid and worshipful. He catches Sherlock off guard, then makes him gasp and scrabble against the bathroom stall, Sherlock’s head falling back, John’s name upon his lips; hail John Watson, full of grace.
“Let me do it,” John said.
So John took a deep breath and said, “I think you’re brilliant at Potions.”
“Those awful gits put them somewhere high so I couldn’t reach and I didn’t see them for a while. Bad news for them,” John said, straightening himself a little, “I am a Master of the Summoning Charm.”
"Do detectives usually fight villains?" Sherlock wanted to know.
"Watson, I know," Victor says, and manages a small smile. "Big fan of your blog."
to be planning something.
John feels like there’s a hand on his windpipe, choking all the air out of him. He feels like the air around him has been placed with clear viscous liquid. The feeling in his chest is the fluid filling up his lungs. He’s drowning.
“And now?” Victor asks.
“Shh, John,” Sherlock chided, kissing the sore spot. “Someone might see. And then what would you do?”
“Shhh,” said John, finger to his lips. “Quiet time is now.”
"We can't giggle, this is a sex scene," John says, laughing, body shaking, clenching and gasping with surprise when he clenches. "Stop it.”
“John,” Sherlock moaned miserably from where he had fallen - back down on the bed - and John felt like punching him, suddenly, like he would very much like to punch Sherlock in his oddly beautiful face - that was also quite unfair, because why did he get to be so beautiful, and rich, and cool, and brilliant, while John was just
And so he tugged his destruction closer.
John shook his head adamantly no, shaking, bouncing on Sherlock’s lap, whining and whimpering through his gag. Sherlock rubbed a thumb over the smooth black surface, pushing it gently against John’s tongue, as if encouraging him to suck.
The light will glint around them.  And right then, right now, they will both suck in a breath and hold it.
,” Sherlock spat out. “I
“John?” Hazel said, not liking the way her voice instinctively rose. The fear, once forgotten, slid sly fingers around her throat and squeezed.
“Well, maybe you should,” Sally said, quite seriously. “Not just the rumours about
He looked at his watch:
“John?” she tentatively asked the quiet room. She didn’t want to wake anybody. No need to get all worked up for no reason. She pushed the door all the way open. The room was empty, moonlight shining onto a little bed with the duvet thrown off. The sheets were wrinkled, the pillow indented with the recent shape and weight of a small blond head.
"No bodies," Molly whispered.
At first he’d been elated. He may have whooped. He might have hollered. He would, under extreme pressure, perhaps admit that there may have possibly been something akin to dancing involved.
It is all madness.
Section after section of the library darkened - starting with
John sighed and ran his hand through his short blond hair. He checked his watch.
, as promised, and then made Sherlock hold out his hand so she could sprinkle out the allotted amount of dried dittany onto it.
John flushes so bright he can feel the heat in his throat. “Um...actually, this is Victor. He’s an old friend of Sherlock’s.”
really creepy,” said Mike.
A common legend is that they used to burn homosexuals at the stake, although there is no substantiated evidence for this claim. No one actually knows the origin of the derogatory term “faggot”; although people use it easily enough, in derision, in mockery, in fear.
“Ah,” says John, a rugby man himself, “Now all that’s left is the corset and you’re well on your way.”
“Fine,” Bill said. “I choose to trust you for now, John, because you are my friend. Please do not betray that trust by claiming my life as blood sacrifice for your evil Lord and Master.”
“Well, yes, of course,” John says. “But thank you.”
Victor is sitting at the kitchen table, playing some music on his laptop while he looks over legal documents.
John had never seen someone so
“Well, he’s already got a Billy, hasn’t he?” John  said, matter-of-fact.
"I don't know. I quite like it," Sherlock said. He considered the picture in his hand. "Maybe I'll get a frame for it."
John relaxed totally under his lips, submitting to the promise of sex and soft touches. The shudder of his body was pure temptation. Sherlock cupped John’s cheek, stubble scratching his palm, and petted the bags under his eye with a calloused thumb. He took his time in covering John’s neck in his lips, alternating firm presses of sweet kisses with the sharp slide of his teeth over his carotid artery. He wanted to leave his marks all over him, the impressions of his teeth, the blossoming red that would deepen to a pretty purple later on from the strength of his sucking. He would imprint his kisses into John’s skin. He would implant the knowledge of the heat of his breath and wet slide of his lips over a tendon. He wanted John’s skin to absorb the memory of his touch.
Sherlock shrugged. "Now no one can, with any real credibility, accuse me of helping you."
on top of the grounding...
And so they were. They were only a block or two away from his house now, and John had never been so relieved.
“You have to ask her. Everybody knows you’re an item now. It’s your social obligation. I can’t believe you haven’t asked her yet.”
Somewhere in the middle the two categories merged, resulting in some macabre chimeras of items: experiments that looked like food, food that looked like experiments.  As John approached, he noticed more items: one bowl full of pills labelled “
Sherlock’s mouth open and sucking at John’s neck, John pushing mindlessly back against him. John can feel each and every long finger pressing against his bare skin, gripping his flesh, then feels  Sherlock’s finger sliding in between, delicate and nudging over that secret hot place that makes John keen, an animal sound for animal needs.
And then John took another breath and drew upon some of that renowned Gryffindor courage. “Sherlock, do you want to be my Potions partner?”
Their first kiss went like this: they had come home from a case, more sleep-deprived than usual. John had gotten 5 cumulative hours of sleep over a period of three days--5 hours and 15 minutes, to be precise, if one counted the time he’d spent asleep on his feet in Lestrade’s office. Sherlock had gotten precisely one hour, parcelled out in 15 minute increments over that period of time. He’d had to be dragged to bed like a man drugged. John had pulled the blankets up around him, and in a momentary lapse of all brain function, dropped a soft kiss upon his cheek. Sherlock, not entirely asleep, turned and smudged their mouths together.
Sherlock, after all, was the main reason that John had immediately thought
This was what they called banter, Sherlock observed. Because they were friends and that was what friends did with each other.
It's the first time Sherlock has fumbled with his jeans in years. His erection has been trapped for so long that it feels like years. It’s been aching all this time and he’s forced it into a state of almost numbness by ignoring it. If he didn’t ignore it he’d have come already. If he didn’t ignore it he’d be inside John already, never mind the cries and protests.
Sherlock closes the lighter.
Sherlock said she was as fine a girl as any.
“Why is no one doing anything?” John demanded, pushing his way through the crowd. “Oi! Carl! Stop it!”
The wall now looked strange in its emptiness. The nail remained as a black dot, like a fly floating in milk; a sea of white.
John is going to protect him, but who is going to protect John
It turned out that John did not know much about murder, after all, but he knew about
Sometimes they go out, but most nights they stay in. They’re comfortable at Baker Street.
“Watson, right?”
, giggling like a schoolboy around a mouthful of beef and broccoli, and Sherlock had snorted tea up into his sinuses, there’d already been nothing they needed to say.
Sherlock’s tail sparkled in the sun like new coins and glitter, like treasure. When he lifted it up, the fin on the end shone sheer, and it flowed like silk when he swished it about in the water.
Bill was especially unimpressed, but then again, John supposed he would be, since he came from an old Wizarding family and all. He hadn’t even understood why it was so funny that his name was Bill Murray.
“Dear
Out in the country, John says, there are fields upon fields of grass, that go on forever, and when the wind blows it ripples through in waves so that it looks like the ocean.
“It’s for Sherlock,” Victor says, grabbing the third drink. They sit with an empty barstool between them.
“They’re basically saying that you’re his house elf slave, and you’re so
John, surprised, remembering an old argument about the Earth and whether it revolved around the sun or vice versa - “I thought you didn’t care about -”
“You know how dangerous it is out here, and yet you still won’t let me in.” Sherlock was smiling at him, reaching out, as if to touch…
“I suppose not,” John had agreed.
Thank you everyone for all your support and being so fun and amazing!!
“Two fingers now,” Sherlock says, other hand stroking the crease of John’s inner thigh to watch him shudder and twitch. “They’ll feel like a lot, but you can take it.”
She went back to her novel. She was trying to be interested in the sordid escapades of Veronica Valance and Captain Blackheart aboard the Burning Passion.
Finally John pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder, and it was like pushing at solid marble. Panic flashed through him - until Sherlock pulled back, and John could breathe again.
wearing one because Bill didn’t want to look stupid wearing one alone,” Mike explained. “As you can see, he still looks stupid, but now we look stupid together.”
“But Mummy…” John protested, even as he allowed himself to be pulled away.
Before he could even gather his thoughts properly, Sherlock laughed.  “Relax, I’m only teasing,” he said.
John frowns, trying to gauge just how insulted he should feel.
In the motel rooms there are always two beds.
He gets up, instinctively, grabbing the blanket at the end of the bed - tucked in far too tight - and gives it a good yank so that he can pull it around him. Sherlock’s pillow is askew, dimpled in where Sherlock’s head had been. The clock on the nightstand reads 4:38.
The police cruiser rolled slowly down St. Peter St., its black and white hood glinting in the late September sun. The children playing in the street scattered upon its approach, like pebbles in the wind. In front of No. 51 a group of girls paused their game of marbles, looking up from where they sat with their skirts spread out in the dirt.
one himself was something else entirely. Still, the thought of it put a warmth in his chest and soothed the tight ache from his jaw. Thinking about Sherlock had that effect on him sometimes. Of course, thinking about Sherlock also put murderous intent in him sometimes, so it was a bit touch-and-go, really.
“Right,” says Victor. “Well, I think it’s time to call it a night, don’t you?”
Sherlock went to a cafe afterwards and had himself a cup of strong Spanish coffee, black with too much sugar. It wasn’t the way that John would have made it.
The wind was crying outside. Its voice was a high-pitched shriek. The thudding got louder, faster. The wind was wailing. The tapping grew more insistent.
He doesn't trust himself to speak. If he talks he might say something ridiculous, he might say let me, let me fuck you, he might beg. If he stops kissing John long enough to let him talk, John might say no.
"Hey stud," Irene says; she catches Sherlock by the football field after school. She comes up to him, popping her gum and swaying her hips with sinuous grace. Her nails and lips are bright red, her jacket bright pink; she wears Chanel no. 5. "You haven't come around in a while. Where've you been? Do you have a new squeeze you haven't told me about?"
Jeanette called him, not bothering to hide the scorn in her voice. Their house was white with violet-blue shutters and a lime green door. They grew daffodils and lilies in the garden. Pink flamingoes perched, one-footed, on the lawn. Jeanette’s life was caged in by a white picket fence.
“Aw, that’s it? You were late
“Just tight enough,” John replied, sucking in a quick breath.
“Sh-Sherlock,” John stutters when he is completely exposed. The hitch of breath is delicious. He shivers although the room is warm. His eyes are nearly black when he looks up at Sherlock. It’s this kind of look that exposes a person, and so Sherlock covers John’s eyes with one hand when he bends down to kiss behind his ear.
No pain,   no   fear.
The roads seemed longer than he remembered, and hillier somehow, but he pumped his legs, refusing to slow down. He could not slow down.  His heart raced, and sweat beaded upon his brow and at the back of his neck, and breath entered his lungs in quick huffs of cooling autumn air.
“Your wife is going to leave you,” he told Dr. Berman, his voice calm and impassive, reading his psychiatrist with cool pale eyes unblinking.
“Just text me,” John says, inputting his number into Victor’s phone. Victor has an iPhone, and John is inordinately thankful because he knows how to work those. It wouldn’t do to look completely technologically inept in front of his new friend.
"Sherlock," John gasped, "I want... I want you to fuck me."
There was an awful racket coming from the room, vibrating through the glass window.  Sherlock had not one, but two, record players going at full volume, one of them propped up precariously on a tower of books. He couldn’t have been asleep; he never liked to sleep that much anyway, and who could sleep with all that noise? He had a lit cigarette in one hand. Clearly, if the self-asphyxiation didn’t work, he was planning to burn the house down with everybody in it.
When Sherlock entered the bedroom -
“Okay, okay,” Bill amended, “Forever or for the next seven years, whichever comes first.”
, Sherlock corrected himself - and he smiled a lot, at everybody and everything and at nothing and people like that made friends very easily, because people were idiots.  People like that generally did not like to be friends with Sherlock, because they were scared that he would Curse them or something.
He and Mike had been playing catch, and the ball had gone over John’s head (a lousy throw) into the woods; all the trees and wild green things that bordered the property. It was always dark amongst the trees, no matter the time of day. John ventured in like a jungle explorer, wary of dangers (such as poison ivy).
“They will be sad, for a little while,” Sherlock admitted. “But then they’ll have another little boy, just like you. And then they’ll forget, the way humans always do.
“Um, thanks?” said John. He wrinkled his nose with consternation, and clutched the bundle of hospital blankets tighter to his chest.
The lovely
He could say anything he wanted to John. John could only shudder and listen. There was no denial there, either, and what a triumph it had been, the first time, to claim John Watson in a way that no one else had ever had him. Now Sherlock triumphed again and again.
Sherlock felt this was all a bit unfair. So many unknown people and a website were hoarding John’s attention while his flatmate and
“Pity,” said Sherlock. “Most things could be improved by explosions.”
“Meanwhile, Mr. Watson is a big boy,” Madam Pomfrey continued, “And if he’s big and
John ends up back at Baker Street. Homing instinct: the ability to find one’s way back to a particular fixed point even after travelling long distances over unfamiliar territory. If he died tomorrow he wonders where his ghost would go - only he doesn’t believe in any of that nonsense.
“He shouldn’t have been out.”
“Mm hmm,” John nodded, because he knew that this was how magic things worked. “But how will I see you again?”
“Oh!” John said, dropped his pail and went down to his knees in the water, so that he could put both small hands on Sherlock’s tail. “It’s so smooth,” he said, because it was, it was so nice to touch, all slippery and smooth. Like nothing John had ever touched before. The slide of it underneath his little fingers was fascinating.
And so John did. He let Sherlock examine his fingers, and he told him how the fingertips turned all wrinkly and old when he sat in the bath too long. He giggled when Sherlock touched his legs, and let him peel a plaster off one knee to sniff at the scrape beneath it. He had to stop Sherlock from licking it, however, because he wasn’t sure if licking was good for healing cuts and scrapes. Instead he let Sherlock lick the bruise on his shin, since that was just skin, and the tickling, wet sensation of Sherlock’s quick tongue made him laugh.
