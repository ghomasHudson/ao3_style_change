John seemed to slip, bracing himself on Sherlock’s leg. Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat.
‘Do not worry,’ came a deep, posh voice from behind the counter. ‘You have entered a bookshop. Not a coffee shop. Though we do sell coffee.’
‘Which is your favourite?’ Sherlock asked slowly. John hadn’t mentioned that Molly was verbally challenged; she had sounded fine before Sherlock came into the room. Maybe she was just incredibly shy. ‘Mine is Chemistry.’
‘Cookies.’
‘Dance for me.’ John had said, eyes cloudy.
) hopped out the other side. Sherlock realised that he had been subconsciously leaning towards John and there were less than four inches between their noses; he jerked back and tried very hard not to think about what John had just said.
John was quiet for so long that Sherlock, hands held stiffly in position, began to feel a little bit uncomfortable. ‘John. Ok?’ He was beginning to wonder if this was a bad idea, if he’d been imagining it, if there really wasn’t anything there and
And then they were kissing again, Sherlock's hands clasped around John's face and John's around Sherlock's because Sherlock knew that if he let go John would fade away from him again and he couldn't do that, he couldn't, he couldn't, kissing frantically, as if they would die if they stopped, as if this was the end of the world and these were the last moments that the two of them would spend together-
No one said anything to John the next morning about his photograph: the squadron ate breakfast in the barracks, and nobody was looking at John weirdly, though Becca was glaring, as usual. John was quiet but tried not to act that different from normal; the last thing he needed was Sholto to realise that something was wrong with him and scream at everyone for bullying him.
Mycroft coughed, glaring at Harry. ‘I have no idea how you got in here, Harriet, but there’s no way you’re going on the balcony.’
He eventually finds himself sitting in his sons rooms, holding Will’s stuffed otter and Scott’s stuffed hedgehog, crying.
century, he immediately knows that James is gone.
John frowned unintentionally: he did it every single time anybody mentioned that
He starts with Isla. He thanks her for taking care of Lizzie and for giving him his grandchildren: he imparts some advice on her that he thinks will help her, in the future. He does the same for Charlotte, though he gives her a kiss on the cheek afterwards: she was always his favourite.
‘Oh shit.’ John swore. Sherlock grinned and looked John full in the eyes as he said, ‘should I introduce myself properly?’
‘No!’ John laughed, and he reached forward for his glass, picking it up and taking a long draft. Sherlock watched, transfixed, as he unfolded his legs and leaned forwards-
Mycroft smiled tightly, opening the door and stepping backwards. ‘Three-thirty. Don’t be late.’
And even as he says the words he always wanted to say, he knows it’s too late. Sherlock’s chest remains still, his body broken, his ears unhearing and his eyes – his beautiful eyes, that once held all the secrets of the universe alongside the sad little boy he was always trying to run from – open and unseeing.
Sherlock flicked his hair back and looked down at himself. He’d really shot up over the last year, reaching a respectable height of six foot (one inch shorter than Mycroft, to his chagrin). He’d also filled out slightly, so he looked less like a skeleton, and the Italian sun had (slightly) darkened his skin. ‘I know. I’m
‘Uncle Jim?’ Tavvy said in disgust. ‘
After they left, he crept back into the den and un-paused the TV. He watched the men kiss the men, the girls hold hands with the girls, the people on the stilts and the floats and the costumes and the smiles he could almost feel, even through the screen.
The curtain twitched again, and a strikingly beautiful girl about the same age as Sherlock stepped onto the balcony. She stood next to Mycroft, who frowned at her, and Sherlock turned around, away from the crowd, and-
It was as he walked home, a million thoughts rushing through his head, that he absentmindedly put his hands in his pockets and felt a fifty pence piece, two twenties, a five and two twos and smiled.
‘We’re talking about your futile attempts to seduce John Watson,’ Mycroft said smoothly. ‘I thought I would offer some brilliant advice.’
He’s emotional, he knows that. It’s not every day you see your little boy get married, he keeps reminding himself, and even now he is sixty-seven and Nathaniel is twenty-three his son is the same baby that called him
He was in Cambridge for his second year as part of the University’s ‘scientific exchange’, a brand-new programme aimed at giving science students at Unis of a ‘lower standing’ to Cambridge a chance to participate in the ‘Cambridge experience’. John had been picked (he hadn’t even applied, they’d literally just told him to go) and basically told ‘go or leave’.
know. For once, Harry, their parents and John were all on the exact same page.
’ She’d then blushed, because the words were totally
‘Uh huh.’ Irene turned towards the other three. ‘Right. Who here likes a bit of same sex relations?’
‘You know Greg,’ Mycroft said, looking embarrassed. John frowned, trying to place the name, before gasping. ‘
It was a brief kiss, lasting no more than five seconds, and when Sherlock pulled away (because it is Sherlock who pulls away) he instantly looked terrified. ‘Oh, god,’ John could hear him saying. ‘I didn’t- oh
‘Irrelevant.’ Sherlock dismissed, waving his hand anxiously. A woman was walking up the gravel towards them, and although Sherlock couldn’t see her properly from this distance it looked terrifyingly like Morag. ‘Physical appearance?’
‘You don’t have to be gay to participate,’ Sherlock pointed out. ‘I’m gay enough for both of us.’
‘Apparently so.’ Sherlock said. ‘Personally, I don’t like it, but John instructed me to robe as so and I obeyed.’
She looked suddenly serious, eyes shifting and (Sherlock took her hand) her palms were sweating. Instantly Sherlock was alert; something strange and possibly dangerous was going on.
bored. I hate crime scenes, I hate the Yard, and I hate Anderson.’ She narrowed her eyes and looked around. ‘He’s here. I can feel his presence.’
(See the end of the chapter for
I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT CHAPTER (cough Johnlock cough) but for now please leave comments and kudos on this one :)
‘Cricket?’ John supplied, breathless. ‘Indeed.’ Sherlock continued. ‘They seem to be doing well-‘
'None,' Jenny sniffed. 'He'd been at the address on Wednesday and on the Friday...' she dissolved into a fresh round of tears and John closed his eyes, remembering. It had been just three days before (
‘Because they love me and I’m an excellent babysitter.’ Sherlock smirked. ‘And I…I would be most displeased if I couldn't see them.’
the heir to the throne.’
his jeans were tight-fitting.
Bonjour! Bienvenue aux adolescents Club! Comment t’appelle vous?’ - Hello! Welcome to the Teenagers club! What are you called?’
Sherlock bowed his head and closed his eyes, as the voice belonging to the person that he loved most in the world and the voice that he wanted to hear least in the world washed over him.
John rolled his eyes in a delightfully John-like manner, and he bent his head and kissed him again.
There was a sudden huffing sound and a hand came over the roof. Janine jerked backwards in fear but Sherlock’s head soon popped up, grinning from ear to ear, four wine bottles in his left hand. ‘Regarde, bitches,’ he crowed. ‘Four bottles of my father’s finest wine. You’re welcome.’
It hit him the first time Irene said that she liked Janine. John had nodded, replying, ‘Just like I like Sherlock,’ and Irene had huffed. ‘No, John, it’s not. Every time I look at her my stomach feels tight, every time she speaks I want to listen forever, every time we touch my skin feels like it’s on
John looked dubious, but accepted Sherlock’s words with a nod. ‘Right. We’re almost here.’
And then he was gone, out of the room, leaving a doctor shouting at their pregnant surrogate to
He starts spending more and more time with him, ignoring the phone calls from his wife and his children and work. He goes to crime scenes instead of the surgery, he has dinner with Sherlock instead of bathing his children, he blows off date night to watch crappy reality TV at 221B.
‘Sherlock,’ Molly said quietly, ‘why did you turn up the heat?’
Nathaniel to be his own person: as much as he misses Sherlock he doesn't want him cloned in his son.
John’s mouth was opening and closing like a fish. ‘I don’t-‘

He pulled away, and Sherlock breathed out, shaky and breathless but
Charlie moved slowly over to Sherlock, batting her eyelashes at him. ‘Daddy,’ she said quietly, ‘can I get my ears pierced?’
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. ‘Sounds like my brother. Was it my brother?’ Then, a pause. ‘Do you know my brother? How long have you been here?’
John’s eyes drifted from Prince Edward to the little boy and frowned. ‘That kid always looks so happy. Why?’
Sherlock’s head jerks up, and he sees his broken-John leaning against the door frame. ‘Mary? How so?’
Isaac shrugged and set off for the two huts on the East side of the village. Hunter and Smith were already headed to the North; John sighed and turned to Becca. ‘Should we go, then?’
‘And Sherlock likes him? Sherlock doesn't like anyone.’
‘Au revoir’ - Goodbye
John smiled and said, ‘I love you.’
The Archbishop placed the crown on his head and Sherlock didn't even feel the weight of fifteen generations of Holmes rulers on his head: all he could feel was the weight of his heart, beating once more in his chest, as he stole a look at John.
Seb curled his lip. ‘That’s so disgusting, John, what if you’ve caught gay from them? Are you
‘Put it on 160C,’ Molly said. Sherlock wrinkled his nose; if he put it on a higher heat, surely it would cook faster? Stupid Molly, unaware of the laws of kinetic heat energy. He turned the dial up to 275C and smiled; Molly would thank him later; and put in Molly’s tray of letters before snatching his tray off Molly and putting it in as well.
John smiled and punched Sherlock playfully on the shoulder. ‘Alright. If you say so. We already told your parents, so it’s fine. Yeah. Fine.’
Sherlock is just what John needs. Sherlock can give John those thrills, Sherlock can give John that rush. He’s known the man less than twenty-four hours before he’s sprinting through London after a serial killer and as they run, John knows he’s found his calling.
Jacob fought to get down, sprinting at his father and jumping into his arms. ‘I’m best!’ He crowed, and Sherlock smiled and whispered, 'yes you are, my little genius.'
John looked at him briefly but looked down; Sherlock clearly didn’t want to discuss it, and although he had referenced the circumstances of his mother's death he clearly didn't want to say anything more about it (though John was more sure than ever that the situation of Queen Violet's death had been covered up by the palace). ‘I love you, Sherlock. Even if you were cursed you wouldn’t be able to convince me to leave you.’
Sherlock had been horrified; the thought of two miniature Mycroft’s running around scared him to the point of indigestion. However the empire had been thrilled; royal babies fever had scooped the kingdom. It received far more coverage than Archie’s birth, or William’s remarriage, or even the whole secrets thing with James. It was, the Times calculated, second only to the death of Queen Violet, Sherlock’s mother, in terms of scale.
‘Yes, then.’ John glared at his empty class before flashing Sherlock a smile that made his heart jump a bit, God knew why. ‘Am I a man?’
is Moriarty, and Sherlock genuinely cannot believe this has happened, that John, his John, is his arch-enemy, has been playing him for all this time,
Violet, who had appeared in the doorway, looked interested. ‘So it’s safe to open?’
Sherlock shook his head. ‘So what? I don’t
‘Go on, then.’ Morag said. ‘Mrs Hudson and I are going to go downstairs to see how cook is doing with lunch. Aren’t we, Mrs Hudson?’
John collapsed.
He doesn’t bother getting dressed, because the servants are used to Master Sherlock, with his odd moods and his periods of silence and his constant midnight trips to Lord knows where: wearing night-clothes is barely noticeable, anymore. He simply pushes himself out of bed and stands, facing the window with his back to the door, and waits. In the ever-expensive glass of his bedroom window, the shimmery reflection of a twenty-three-year-old with eyes that had seen eight decades stares back at him.
‘Well, it’s technically a palace, but that doesn’t matter.’ Sherlock waved his hand dismissively.
‘I’d say so.’
John shrugged and looked suspicious. ‘Sometimes.’
Sherlock picked up the phone. ‘Hello, John, I’m here,’ he said as calmly as he could. ‘Can you repeat your previous statement, please?’
and then in Baskerville. Thrill after thrill after thrill, with Sherlock oblivious and John content for the first time in his life. Everything is perfect-
Sherlock nodded assent and they dashed across the hallway, down the stairs and into Archie’s bedroom. The little boy wasn’t there, so Sherlock literally vaulted out of the open window and skidded down the roof.
he whispers.
Lestrade physically brightened. ‘Really?’
that they would be friends again next year.
John smiled for the first time, though tears were now streaming down his face, and he whispered, ‘Why do you speak French around me when you know I don't speak it?’
John and Sherlock jumped out of the car as it reached the ornate front doors of the palace, far away from the screaming people. As Sherlock opened the door, he hoped against all hopes his grandmother had been delayed; he knew that Morag would publicly humiliate him if he was late-
‘Hans Reichenbach created the Berlin Circle!’ Mycroft cried. ‘Everyone knows that!’
Sherlock wasn’t quite sure who leaned in first, but somehow they ended up locked in an embrace, John pressed against the living room wall, spoon digging into Sherlock’s back, lips connecting the two of them in bright, heated light as Sherlock’s world imploded around him, walls crashing, cities burning, and John Watson taking over his entire brain for the rest of his life-
John took Sherlock’s head in his hands, thumbs caressing his sharp cheekbones and he pulled Sherlock’s face towards him and he said, ‘no, Sherlock, no, no, I promise you, this wasn’t you.’
‘Shut up.’ Irene playfully punched John in the shoulder, but her heart wasn't in it and she sighed. ‘She says that she won’t do anything but I’m not sure. Like, she’s not gay, she’s only sixteen and she’s a bit of a slag.’
It made John strangely angry.
Sherlock talked about a little boy who had cried himself to sleep every night for eight months, huddled in the blankets as Miss Brook snored next door. A little boy who was told he was worthless, useless, stupid and a curse on the world, a boy who was told that anyone he loved would die and it would always, always be his fault.
‘Why do you have a picture of you and the King?’ Becca asked. John felt a stab of horror and then a sort of relief; it had been her who took the picture, at least he knew that now. ‘Can we talk about this later? I have a life to save.’
Sherlock felt it too.
‘The Holmes’s are the richest royal family in the world,’ Sherlock said quietly. ‘We have the most land, the most subjects, the most money, the most resources. My great-great-grandfather, King Thomas V, built Buckingham and it is widely recognised as the best and most expensive residence in the world.’
And all, John thought as he traced Sherlock’s cheek with his hand, because of ninety nine pence.
James was unbuttoning his trousers already, still kissing him as hard as he could, one hand tugging on Sherlock’s hair (why did it feel so much better when James did that?) and Sherlock was moaning already, Jim smirking against his lips. Sherlock’s sub consciousness was screaming at him to stop, that this was madness, that he was cheating on the best thing that had ever happened to him with the worst thing that had ever happened to him and god dammit Sherlock why won’t you stop?
’ Irene clasps her son’s arm, turning him towards the camera. ‘But he’s right.’
‘I was five years and five days old.' John almost breathed a sigh of relief - he didn't love Jim - but Sherlock looked so sad and conflicted he couldn't. 'I was at Dreyden palace with my mother, my brother and my father. Morag was there as well, though she had been holed up with my dad in his study all weekend, some national emergency. I can’t remember what.’ Sherlock had a faraway look in his eyes and it was like he wasn’t talking to John anymore-
Nathaniel’s first-born children come into the world on a dark, cold winter night right at the end of the year. John’s there, of course: he was the first person Nathaniel called when they realised it was time. He, in turn, called Lizzie, who brought Rebecca: at ten, she is deemed old enough to be present, though Isla stays at home with Harriet, Lila-Rose and the newest granddaughter, Violet. All three of them are sitting in the waiting room and John’s foot is tapping compulsively as he prays
Irene was still talking, oblivious to the utter crisis John was having. ‘I mean, Janine and I are both over sixteen, but you and Sherlock…’
Sherlock stared at them both, eyes hard and unforgiving.
About an hour and another bottle after they started playing, John dared Irene and Janine to go for a ten minute ‘walk’ in the forest. Half an hour after they’d gone, it was obvious they weren't coming back, and Mike sighed as he hauled himself up. ‘I should be going,’ he explained as he gently edged off the roof. ‘I have a volleyball game to referee early in the morning.’
‘Technically,’ Sherlock drawled, ‘I have nine half-siblings. Including Mycroft and Archie.’ He frowned slightly. Sherlock thought of Mycroft at least as his full-sibling.
But John wasn’t really listening anymore, attention drifting to Sherlock, who was still standing motionless, staring at his phone. It occurred to John that it wasn’t like Sherlock to lose concentration at a crime scene, especially a locked-room mystery like the woman on the floor, and so he approached him from behind, placing a hand gently on his arm and saying, ‘Love? What’s going on?’
The man nodded, clutching his cheek. ‘I suppose I deserved that. You know, that shade of blue suits you.’
‘Excellent!’ Mycroft sounded genuinely thrilled. ‘I cannot wait. It’s so boring, just sitting in the palace day after day. Do you know, last week, while I was stuck indoors because of that terrorist threat, I actually played
‘No,’ John said aloud, and Sherlock just looked at him, face unreadable, and continued. ‘Mycroft had showed me pictures of guns, told me to avoid them, so I stayed in the wardrobe and I just watched as she put the gun in her mouth and shot herself.’
Sherlock squinted at the post-it note as he drank some more whiskey (it felt like fire, but
Sherlock Holmes, the boy with no friends, the boy who actively hid away from anyone who might want to be an acquaintance of his, the boy who John had been absolutely
Rosie crept in, pausing a couple of feet away, looking suddenly shy. ‘Papa-‘
‘Fuck me in the arse with a vibrating dildo.’
He kept saying it was because of his school, his work and his friends, but there was something more there that he couldn’t quite work out. The thing was, he was actually quite looking forward to Italy: he hadn’t yet learnt Italian but he liked the language, he was a big fan of pasta and ice cream, the culture was interesting and the history was amazing. The criminals were smarter, the police force was smaller…it was everything Sherlock could want.
‘Sherlock,’ John hissed, ‘I wanted you to say no.’
John’s brain wasn’t working properly. He was so shocked he didn’t really understand, though even as he stared at the bowed head he was praying please let him be lying, please don’t let him be-
‘Sorry,’ Sherlock pouted. ‘Didn’t mean to.’
of June 1999; I am now nineteen years old. I was banned from having any contact with my, ah, English relatives,’ he winked at Sherlock, who closed his eyes; he had always hated the thought that he and James were technically related (third cousins twice removed, but whatever), whilst James had always found the incest a sort of a turn-on. James continued, now looking at John, who had been looking bored and now looked slightly more interested, ‘I was banned from having contact with my English relatives about two and a half years ago for there reasons.'
It is not a large bookshop: it’s small, but filled with books of every kind, on the shelves, on the floor, even on the tables. There’s coffee and cake, and you can see down the whole street from the window that overlooks it.
as always, brother,’ Mycroft hissed as he stood up, pulling Lestrade after him. ‘I’ll
It wasn’t Sherlock’s first kiss. It wasn’t his second, or third kiss.
He was so good at it that John often wondered whether Sherlock had ever done anything like this with someone else, before John. They had had the talk about two weeks after they started going out, just before John was about to give Sherlock a blowjob. It was the first time John had ever done anything like it and he was horribly nervous, partly because of how amazing Sherlock was at it and partly because of the sheer size of his dick. Although it wasn't anywhere near as wide as John’s it was a good couple inches longer and it scared him to even look at it.
And that was how they stayed, arms wrapped around each other, touching and seeing and
‘YOU’RE WRONG!’ Sherlock screamed, pulling his hands away and covering his face. ‘She died because of me, John, I just let her die.’
John turned and ran.
Sherlock sighed and looked at the ground. ‘I’m thinking I just might not ask him, Myc. I see no way in which he would agree to come with me and I prefer not to be massively humiliated in front of people.’
Irene looks at him, her eyes wide and intelligent. That was what appealed her to him in the first place: her abnormal intelligence, one that rivalled his own, even. He’d considered himself purely attracted to men, and hadn’t touched a soul since James Moriarty murdered Victor Trevor in the late 18
Parker nodded and Sherlock checked his watch, smiling at John. ‘Five minutes,’ he breathed into his ear. ‘Ready?’
Irene was saying sorry, interrupting the film and everyone was looking but Sherlock didn’t care about the image, didn’t care that it would be bad rep, because one of the only people he thought he could trust had turned out to be crooked, deceiving and a liar. She hadn’t liked him for him, she had been on a job, ordered by Sherlock’s worst enemy.
‘I like her,’ Irene had said on numerous occasions, and then blushed and shaken her head vehemently. ‘I mean-‘
All he wanted was a book.
much better) but combined with everything else…John can barely hold it in at times.
‘But,’ Sherlock continued, ‘For some reason, I keep finding ways to make you stay around here, so I have come to explain. And apologise. Probably explain first.’
‘It’s irrelevant.’ Mycroft huffed. ‘Let’s get it over with, then.’
) was behind Morag, mouthing something that Sherlock couldn’t understand because Morag was smiling evilly in front of her and it was giving Sherlock the shivers. ‘Off you go, Sherlock. Don’t keep your…lad waiting.’
Mycroft rolled his eyes and stood up. ‘Fine. If you won’t take my advice, Sherlock, then I think you should listen to what almost all of your friends have told you and just
Violet and Tavvy chorused. Dante just blinked and held up his arms for his Daddy, and Sherlock swung him into his arms and kissed his curly head. ‘Da sad?’ He whispered, pulling at Sherlock’s own curls, so similar to his own. Sherlock shook his head and smiled at John, and in that smile he said
John slumped in his chair, staring at Sherlock. ‘I just- I just couldn't believe that you liked me,’ he murmured. ‘Still can’t, really. I’m John. Ordinary John. Simple John. Run-of-the-mill John.’
John’s father raised his eyebrows at the lack of a reply. ‘Right, then. Well, it wasn't hard to book a ticket and get out here. It occurred to me that it’s been
‘Of course,’ Sherlock said, trying to sound sure. ‘Of course I will-‘
Harry sighed loudly. ‘What’s the point? They’re stupid, they’re terrible leaders and it’s positively Neanderthal. They’re not better than us just because their last name is…what is it, John?’
Sherlock resisted the urge to turn around and give his father the finger; it would accomplish nothing. He and his father got on, most of the time, but he honestly and truly hated the blatant homophobia his father seemed to possess. He had never come out, he hadn’t needed to; James had taken care of that for him, but sometimes he felt like standing on the palace roof and telling the world that yes, he was a homosexual (he would never do that, though. It was the palace's most tightly guarded secret and he really would be banished if it got out). Yes, he always would be. No, it wasn’t a phase. Why did everyone ask if it was a phase? Should he start asking straight people if it was a phase?
, saying it was ‘unnecessarily colloquial, Jawn,’ and Roise had started picking it up too, in the way she picked up so many of his bad habits. ‘I will be.’
John knows, but he doesn't say. He just says he’ll check, stands up, retrieves his gun from his bedroom and walks out of his flat.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. ‘You’ve never been in love, have you?’
Sherlock, why didn’t you tell me about her before?’
John laughed nervously. ‘Nothing, dad. Have a bit of dinner, go to the park, see Molly maybe-‘
‘People generally hate myself.’ Sherlock muttered. John shot him an exasperated look. ‘They don’t hate you, they hate your façade.’
break down this door.’
Arthur took the letter home and kept it under his pillow for months, and every night he would dream about a soldier and a detective, just like the letter said, and when he grew up he wrote about them, using only what he had found in the letters and on their graves.
John didn't realise that Sherlock was trying to take off his shirt until one of the buttons rips. At this point John was so completely past caring that he just ripped the whole thing down the middle, tearing his entire shirt like it’s made of paper (
Molly tipped her head to the side and smiled. ‘Sherlock Holmes,’ she said softly, ‘I am never baking with you again. Just ask him to go with prom with you, for god’s sake. It’s so much easier and…safer.’
‘So Harry texted me this joke,’ John was saying. ‘And usually they’re stupid, right? But this one-‘ he snorted, and Rosie huffed as the spoon jerked away from her mouth. ‘This one was: what did the beaver say when he slipped on water?’
Sherlock shook his head adamantly. ‘God, no. No. Irene’s a friend.’
‘Sherlock!’ Archie (
‘If I were him, I’d ask to be King Archibald.’ Harry sniggered. ‘King Archibald the first.’
Silence descended on the flat.
Sherlock stopped in front of a door and turned, making sure John was still with him. When he saw that he was, he smiled and opened it up.
John’s eyebrows shoot up, and Sherlock reaches across him to flick to another page in the album: the photograph of him, Irene and Felix, dated March 1891. ‘This is Felix.’
and John is not, and John deserves to know that Sherlock physically cannot grow old with him.
They walked in near silence; Hunter and Smith were whispering to each other at the back of the group, hands constantly brushing against each other, whilst Isaac was tramping ahead, and Becca was walking next to John. He didn’t want to say anything to anyone, least of all her; he was still worried sick about the photo, and whether anyone had seen it.
Mycroft was still talking about his mysterious lover and Sherlock put that horrible day out of his mind, wanting to know more. ‘They’re at the palace a lot, for protection mostly, though they’re also a detective with Scotland Yard. Father knew their mother and requests them personally.’
It didn't help that he saw the younger boy everywhere, walking with Jim Moriarty, eating with Jim Moriarty, talking with Jim Moriarty. John tried not to look, he really didn’t, but he couldn't
‘I know,’ Sherlock acknowledged. ‘You exhibited all the regular signs of lying when you said it-‘
Behind them, someone yelled, ‘Sherlock ! Est-ce que vous ne jouez pas?’ Sherlock turned around and shouted back, ‘Plus tard. Je suis un peu fatigué.’
Finally,
him, in every way, all ways, John Watson, Sherlock Holmes-
John burst out laughing. ‘I bet King William paid her to marry him. She’s, what, twenty-seven, and beautiful.’
Stupid Mycroft.
‘Sherlock!’
John managed to get to his feet. ‘He didn’t hit you?’ He said frantically, checking Sherlock all over, though the younger man was still on his feet, if paler than a ghost and shaking.
Irene rolled her eyes, taking John’s hand (a group of
On their last night together before John went home for his first year at Uni and Sherlock went to Oxford for his third year (he’d started at the age of sixteen, two years early) they lay on Sherlock’s bed, staring at the stars through his skylight. They’d both been dreading the end, and now Sherlock’s hand crept into John’s as he said, ‘What now?’
And John opened the door, stepping in and leaving Sherlock on the doorstep, wondering how John could be so clueless yet so aware at the same time.
Now, as John looked at his heartbroken family, he knew that he would never, ever be able to live his real life. Now, as John's broken heart slammed in his chest, he realised for the millionth time in the last three days that he couldn't do it. He couldn't get over Sherlock, couldn't stay with Mary, and now he couldn't do anything about it.
Sholto closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened them, he was clearly fuming, and John rolled his eyes at Hunter and mouthed
He had been so consumed with guilt and rage that he hadn’t even noticed John standing there, with an expression on his face like his heart was breaking.
‘I thought they’d be done faster,’ he protested weakly. ‘I didn't realise they would do that.’
He’d imagined him coming back with a perfectly reasonable explanation (
Sherlock took a small step forwards, hand outreached. ‘John-‘
‘You’ll see what we’ve been dealing with for the past nineteen years then, won’t you?’ Mycroft had retorted, looking incredibly smug. He had been delighted that Sherlock had been hired a sort of
Sherlock locked eyes with his brother and smiled as gently as he could. ‘Gregory’s a stupid name,’ he said finally, and Mycroft smiled slightly, though Sherlock could tell that he was grateful that Sherlock hadn't said what he had thought he was going to say and more grateful that Sherlock was pretending he didn't know who Gregory Lestrade was (Sherlock actually counted the detective as one of his few friends). ‘He didn't choose it. And, honestly, I don’t care. He’s so much more than a name, Sherlock.’
'King John.'
Sherlock smiled and let him go, waving at the crowd who waved back, still chanting ‘Johnlock’ over and over, and said out of the side of his mouth, ‘you were right.’
‘Most of the French children speak a bit,’ Mycroft answered. ‘And we do have some English members. They’ll introduce themselves to you, probably. You’ll pick up some French quickly, but until then if someone speaks to you just say
When he was brought in through the main set of doors at the front of the palace, which Sherlock had taken him through maybe twice, he was taken immediately to what Sherlock had once called the ‘main conference hall’. On their original tour, all those months ago, it had been a large (extraordinarily large. The size of a hall, even), empty room with chairs stacked to the sides and John had seen no reason to go in there again. Sherlock had said when he first showed it to him that no one ever goes in there, John, unless there’s been a huge disaster. The last time it was used…it was in the days after the Eye massacre. At this point Sherlock had adopted that hard facade across his face that often came when the massacre was mentioned and had moved swiftly on: John had forgotten the room existed.
‘I like President West,’ Charlie said. ‘He’s a good rapper.’
Just like that, Sherlock knew what he had to do. He gave himself a mental pat on the back before saying, ‘December the twenty-second.’
He was nothing special, and John wanted to be special.
don’t beat, but there is something so fragile, so beautiful, about the steady thrum of a mortal heart, and Victor’s mortal heart is all he has. It’s all he needs.
‘I love you, John Watson.’
They sat in silence again but John didn’t feel shaky anymore; instead, he felt angry.
‘Evening.’
‘That,’ John said, ‘Is amazing.’
I knew I shouldn't drink with you around-‘
Dancing didn’t seem like a strenuous sport; it was. Sherlock needed two hands to count the number of broken and sprained ankles he had had, and he had broken all of the bones in his left leg when he tried to do the splits across the bars and fell off when he was twelve (the press had said he'd gotten into a fight with Mycroft over Sherlock being the heir: Mycroft had actually spent the night next to Sherlock's hospital bed, reading his little brother the entire Chronicles of Narnia and then playing snap when Sherlock woke up in tears at four in the morning), but he wouldn't stop, even when they tried to make him, saying it was a danger to his health. Sherlock loved to dance and he would not give it up for anything.
‘That,’ Sherlock continued, ignoring her completely, ‘he will accept my offer to attend the large social gathering involving dancing, secret drinking and everyone pretending to like each other held annually for the year 13’s at Sherwood Grammar School with me is extremely low- there is no way he would ask me. He’s John, Molly! Everyone loves him-‘
‘Course,’ he says, when John doesn’t stand up. ‘Yeah. Course.’
‘That’s what it is, isn’t it?’ Hamish said, examining his fingernails. ‘Or, technically, inducing, though the former term is much more common.’
John Watson glared contemptuously at Jim, then turned around and walked towards the door, and quietly left the room without so much as a backwards glance at Sherlock.
The bed made a loud creaking sound and collapsed.
Their son is born looking so like Sherlock that John cannot even pretend that he is biologically John’s: that’s how he wanted it, how they both wanted it, though they both gave sperm samples to the hospital.  Lizzie was John’s, it was only fair, Sherlock had argued, that they evened up the playing field, and John can almost imagine Sherlock gazing at his son with an expression of the utmost joy and love and amazement. Sometimes, John can almost imagine Sherlock standing over his son and saying
John, hovering by the door, couldn’t believe it. She commit suicide? The Queen? It was
He doesn’t want to tell James he loves him. He wants to tell James that he scares him, that he wishes they’d never met, that he lives in constant fear, that he lives the life of the oppressed. He doesn’t think James knows what love is: he certainly doesn’t think
‘Not today.’ Sherlock said firmly, and Mycroft hesitated (oh, Sherlock
John blinked. ‘Is your name Sherlock?’
In a large bedroom, in a large palace, in a large kingdom, two boys smiled each other as a friendship as beautiful and fragile as the boy with the black hair was formed.
Sherlock looked like he wanted to say something, but didn’t.
‘Hold it up to the moon,’ Sherlock said quietly, and so John did.
Jim continued, ignoring John’s shock. ‘The second reason was because I leaked a series of opinions the King and the other royal family had towards certain
‘OF COURSE THEY’RE BETTER! I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT ANYWAY! PLEASE STOP!’
those jokes. Please, continue with them.’ But the tone of his voice was too nervous to be jokey, and Rosie didn’t say anything else as they walked along the corridor, pausing in the waiting room so Rosie could drop off her stuff, and then continuing another five metres to room 2, floor 4.
Sherlock paused and scrutinised the other boy, before smiling slyly. ‘Could be dangerous,’ he whispered. ‘Have to sneak you in, past all the King’s horses and all the King’s men…’
Now, John was aware that things had changed between he and Sherlock. He knew that he had acted abysmally, that he had really hurt Sherlock and hadn't even tried to apologise or even talk about it. He knew that Sherlock was angry, but he didn't in a million years think Sherlock would say without even looking up, ‘I want you gone. Go.
Sherlock, who had been preparing to dismiss the waiter, perked up at the insult of his brother. ‘The groom?’
‘I didn’t turn you over,’ Sherlock said seriously. ‘You at least owe me that. You seem vaguely intriguing.’
‘Nice observation.’ Irene called over her shoulder. ‘But you can worry about that later. Right now, we have a premier to attend.’
He would never stop loving Sherlock Holmes and there was nothing he could do about it.
The nine other soldiers lined up along John's barracks shouted as one, ‘Sir, yes, Sir?’
‘Oh, that one was naughty,’ Irene interrupted. ‘I never thought she’d have it in her.’
Mycroft looks smug. ‘What did I say? Irene wishes to marry you, brother-‘
‘At four p.m exactly, you and John are to go out onto the balcony. Sherlock, you’ve memorised your speech?’
Sherlock closed his eyes tight. When he opened them John was looking at him again, eyes almost shut, angrier than Sherlock had ever seen him before.
‘What happened?’ He said, voice so hard that it made Sherlock flinch, physically flinch, and Jim smiled, and said, ‘oh, John. Settle down. This is a long, long story.’
‘Sherlock was needed and I didn't fancy joining the others,’ John admitted. ‘You?’
‘Anyone who has ever spoken to me will know that I deduce people. Usually at first encounter, I will tell them their life story, their family, their job, secrets-‘ he paused. ‘Sorry about that. When I met John, it was no exception. I deduced him, after he asked me if I wanted more wine, but instead of gasping or punching me or just walking away, as most of you did, he ignored me.’ On seeing the quizzical looks, he chucked slightly. ‘I know. Most of you would assume I would just move on, seek out the next victim.’ He smiled at John, who had tears in his eyes as he remembered their first encounter. ‘But I didn’t. Maybe that’s what I was looking for all along- someone who would see past my, um, dickness-‘ they laughed and looked at John, ‘and find the real me.’
John wriggles against the mattress, shivering, his skin still prickling up, and starts to giggle a little, giddy with it all. It’s a bit like the rush after a good laugh, heady and light. However, when their knees come within range and a spark jumps between them, they both yelp and jerk away in surprise.
Again.
“And what if I don’t like?”
“Photos?” Sherlock asks.
This was a question Sherlock had asked him often. One time verbally, but mostly it was unspoken.
“It is,” Claire says slowly, her eyes darting to John, clearly uncomfortable that Sherlock has said out loud what she had been implying: that John has overstayed his welcome.
“Yes, you’ve been trying to warn me for ten years. But I’m still here aren’t I? When are you going to give it up as a bad job?”
for a moment
The shush of clothes being discarded. Sherlock’s shallow breathing, John’s frantic heart.
“And one is moving into the manse with you?” Bobbi asks, not taking the hint and moving with him.
John moaned softly and all the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. “God, I want you.”
It really, really was.
“Imagine how good it will feel to push inside me. How wet and tight I would be for you. Imagine how your thick cock will pry me open, how you’ll be able to watch yourself. Sliding in and out. Imagine how hard your heart will be beating then, John.”
Jesus.
Desire, a sharp, insistent pounding under his skin.
“What is it?” he asks softly, like he genuinely doesn’t know.
I may have huffed.
“What? You can let me preen a bit can’t you?”
“All right, spill.”
,” Charlotte corrected him, giggling. She stood up and began waggling her tush as she walked towards the asters. “It’s called the waggle dance and it’s how the bees tell the other bees where to find flowers.” Charlotte spread her arms and flew off, making a buzzing noise as she looped around the lawn.
This time John paints a lines of droplets across both of Sherlock’s cheeks and opens his mouth, smearing his lips across them before sucking gently at the sticky sweet mess he has made.
Charlotte nodded, her brown eyes studiously trained on the bee. She blinked, almost going a bit cross eyed in her eagerness.
When she got to Sherlock, she pulled him in tight and whispered loudly, “He’s alright with me, love. If you’re the man he’s thinking he’d like to snog, then I say go for it.”
“I don’t care about the gala. This is more important.”
Without turning out the light John got under the covers and lay on his side facing me. He would not look at me, instead, he reached out and stroked his fingers down the curve of the puppy’s spine. Unfurling, it rolled over onto it’s back, presenting it’s belly for rubbing. John smiled and my heart swelled from the simple sweetness of it.
“Yes, anything,” Sherlock manages to whisper before John’s hands are underneath his elbows and helping him to stand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re quite right, Charlotte, the name is confusing. It makes one think of tiny loaves doesn’t it? Bees wearing oven mitts?” He laughed again and this time Charlotte joined him, giggling.
Sherlock’s smile. The way the corner of his mouth tugs. Up. And up. Tugs at John’s heart as it goes.
“I think you probably all know the story by now.” Sherlock glanced around the room and was met with varying degrees of pitying nods and compassionate eyes. “I’d like to discuss what to do about the fact that Oliver didn’t alert us, which, I understand the man is going through some difficult family hardships, however it doesn’t sit right with me that this loss was entirely preventable.”
Not yet.
“I have this toy…”
“You take my cock like such a good boy,” he says, his words slurring slightly. “I love seeing your pink lips stretched out around me. I love watching your throat fill with me. I love how you’re listening to my wish and not touching yourself. Your poor little cock is so hard and pink. I know it’s difficult. You’re doing so, so well.
Irene merely raises an eyebrow.
“I’d like you to reflect on why that might be a little more difficult to do this year,” Tom, Sherlock's therapist from rehab, had asked him at Sherlock’s monthly check-in.
John gestures. “You just threw your ring on the table!”
John leans in and fits his mouth to Sherlock’s. Tears the groan from his throat. Sucks his tongue. His lips. John’s hands fumble at the listing opening of Sherlock’s dressing gown and rips it apart. Shoves it down and off, wanting skin, wanting warmth, wanting every hard-soft inch of Sherlock to be touching every hard-soft inch of him.
John tucks his head under Sherlock’s chin and lets his body relax.
Behind you, your sitting room breathes against you both, hot and humid. Close and stuffy; you had shut the windows before you left for your walk. You want to throw them open, let the night air rush in, rush over you both. You want the cool river stone taste of the breeze on your tongue as you unbelt him, unwrap him, lay him bare. You want the cool stream flowing over you as you tumble him into bed, want to feel it raise goosebumps on his skin, want to bend and taste the salt of him as the sweat dries and crackles.
The lingering taste of Sherlock in his mouth, spearmint, and beneath that, what he had been trying to mask: tar and smoke.
“Just a bit of kindling,” I said, trying to keep my voice bored and flat so that he would desist and return to his book.
“And I…liked it. Maybe a bit too much.”
“There’s nothing to forgive, you know,” John says, wishing he could put his hands in Sherlock’s silky curls and run his thumbs over the smooth panes of his cheeks. “You don’t have to atone for what Moriarty did to me. I don’t want you thinking that you must. I don’t blame you.”
“No.” John will beg. He will do anything it takes. But he can’t. He can’t get enough air. He can’t breathe. Panic is a vice around his chest, squeezing. John sags, lets Sherlock catch some of his weight. “You can’t say that. You can’t. Just give me. A minute. Jesus Christ.”
“Shouldn’t what? Take what you need? I want you to.”
He was wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pinching his nipple.
“So what’s the problem? When you got here, you looked devastated. What’s happened?”
His lips are soft when John stretches up to capture them. Sherlock opens, lets John’s tongue push inside, making helpless sounds of pleasure deep in his throat. The lotion bottle drops to the bed on top of John’s shoulder, Sherlock losing himself in the kiss, as he lengthens to fully hard in John’s hand.
And blinks.
The furred dip of his stomach.
“Ok. I see that we have you scheduled for next week. Is there anything I can do to support you until then?”
“Tonight?” John asks, his hands still wrapped around the back of Sherlock’s firm thighs.
“Sherlock, we need to talk about this,” John says, quiet, but firm, as they gain altitude and the plane levels off.
Sherlock looks up and catches John trying to hold back his laughter.
Ella nods.
“This.” His big hands on John’s back, deft fingers slipping down his spine. His mouth, wet and soft and hungry, moving over John’s. “This, this. This
“I’m afraid I’ve become the guinea pig for Charlotte’s salon. This shade is called Mermaid's Blush.”
They both smile.
“Lift your hips,” John says, and Sherlock does.
John tightens around him.
I took a moment then to watch him, kneading at his perineum with one knuckle while I wrapped the other around his prick and worked him in time with my mouth.
Not even John could stop it and wasn’t that one of life’s more cruel tragedies?
“Picnic is it?” John chuckles as he picks up his fork and leans forward.
“John, you literally just lost everything.”
“I love you too,” kissed into the river of John’s spine.
“I want you to teach me how to do it.”
A gust of air is slowly released as Sherlock gets his hand on himself. He’s being so quiet, John is impressed. Sherlock’s lips part and his tongue darts out, drawing across them, leaving them glossy and plump and pink.
“All right.”
Sinking down. Bearing down.
The second before I spoke I knew I had better not.
“I’d rather communicate about it, than pretend it’s not there,” Sherlock said. “Thank you for being willing to be vulnerable and tell me how you’re feeling.”
The slick sound of John’s cock gliding between Sherlock’s cheeks momentarily fills the tiny berth as the speakers come to life, right before it is interrupted by the sharp crack of John’s hand landing on Sherlock’s arse.
John lifts his head and stares into the dropped out bottom of Sherlock’s eyes.
So John takes him back between his lips and sucks on him like a lolly.
Sherlock straightens, shoots the cuff down over his wrist. His eyes are cool, unreadable. John’s cheeks flush. “That’d be great, really, but I’ve got to—“
Your black hair with its sweat sticky roots slipping between my fingers. Your shoulders hunched up by your ears. The curve of your spine punctuated by the knobs of your vertebrae, the damp hollow of the small of your back. I licked my own lips for the taste of it.
“Oh, Sherlock.” I rarely used your first name and I could see the effect it had on you. “Come here.”
, John thinks, with that familiar burn of pride and awe hot in his chest. John ducks his head and smiles into his chest as Lestrade leads them to the connecting door set into the bedroom wall.
“I can see that,” John says, his eyes dropping down to where Sherlock’s cock is starting to plump up and press against his flies.
What was the point of trying?
You turned me, exerting pressure until I stepped back and was brought up short against the grill of the Morris.
Sherlock wets John’s lips, drawing them back and forth across the loose purse of John’s kiss, before pushing back inside.
To stay.
His head jerked back a little and his eyes widened, but just there, just a flicker there and gone; I saw something catch and begin to smolder, something hot and dark, and heat melted down my thighs at the sight of it.
John turns one of his palms over on top of his knee.
The wine’s cheap. Bought at Tesco more as a mode towards inebriation than anything else. Like an unripe peach it’s brash and astringent on his tongue.
“Are you suggesting I let you live for a game of cat and mouse?”
Your eyes stutter up to meet his and he knows exactly what you were imagining.
John rolls his forehead against Sherlock’s, their breathes coming warm and quick between them. “Sher-lock. Fuck.”
“Yes, and so are you. Two choices, get into bed with me or catch pneumonia.”
“Isn’t that your journal?”
I penguin track you all.
Moving in and out slowly, John bears down and his finger slips deeper. The ache in his thighs intensifies and he writhes against his bed, a high whine trapped at the back of his throat.
“So what will you do?”
“There you are,” he says, straightening up from where he was bent over the keyboard. Mrs. Patterson squints at the computer screen, looking doubtful. Her mobile, lying beside her right hand, dings loudly and lites up.
Sherlock shakes his head, curls obscuring his face, head sunk between his arms.
It’s the wind scraping barren plains. A landscape bleak and razed.
They sit next to each other. John on the inside so that their elbows don’t jostle as they eat. Sherlock’s left hand rests on John’s knee, the heat of his palm seeping through John’s jeans to bloom across his skin. Across from them, their shopping bags fill the other bench of the booth. Their beers drip condensation onto the tabletop in shiny mirrored pools. A woman sits at the back of the restaurant doing sums on an old calculator, the type that writes up bills. The whir of typewriter wheel and the clack of the keys punctuates the sounds of the restaurant.
Ellen nodded. She understood.
Sherlock turns to face him, twisting his long body and resting his forearm on the tabletop. John nods slowly; the words strike him as true. When he had met Sherlock, when he had felt like he was helping people once more, that he was useful, it had turned his life around. He no longer cleaned and maintained a gun with almost religious reverence. He no longer traveled the length and breadth of all of London’s boroughs to keep from putting that well oiled barrel in his mouth and swallowing a bullet.
Earlier this year I was working on a fic under a different pseudonym. It was named Blackthorn, which, due to a mental health crisis, I have since deleted. But in that story I had this little Sussex cottage all worked out and I was a little in love with it, so I've included it here. If, on the very small chance, that you had read that fic, this will seem very familiar. Especially the apple part. Just a heads up.
“Yeah.”
Sherlock stares at him, poleaxed.
Sherlock nodded. “Sure, come in.”
“Do you trust that I wouldn’t let you do something you were clearly uncomfortable with?”
“Can I trust you not to run around behind my back, talking to everyone about me?”
Sherlock looks genuinely puzzled for a moment and John punches him on the arm. “You’d be the muscle, obviously,” Sherlock says, smiling, pleased with his little joke. “And we'd solve torrid little mysteries and you’d tell me how brilliant I am and we’d have really fantastic sex all over the city.”
“It’s fine.”
Sherlock raised his hand, fresh plasters affixed. “Much better, thank you again for your help.”
Sherlock immediately wilts, bending forward at the waist, his hands braced on the windowpanes.
John opens his mouth and sucks and Sherlock moans John’s name.
Once John is completely bare he kneels on the ground in front of Sherlock’s feet and casts his gaze up at him through his lashes.
“Eager, aren’t we?” John chuckles, nosing up into the seam and just letting his breath stream out over where Sherlock wants him. Sherlock whines a bit at the tease. “I won’t make you wait any longer, darling; come here; let Daddy give you his mouth.”
For an instant he is transported back to the night he had buggered himself on the dildo.
John meets his eyes in the rearview.
“Being here, in this house where we used to spend summers away from my father, made me doubt that I could do it. Mycroft is very rarely wrong about anything, after all.” John closes his eyes against it: the sight of Sherlock, about to break John’s heart. He feels Sherlock step close, pressed up against the fence that separates them. His voice is low and earnest when he says, “And that’s why I’ll certainly make a mess of it because I’ve no idea what I’m doing,” and here, Sherlock’s voice breaks just the tiniest bit, “but, God, John, I want to try.”
“Jesus.” John feels cold. No wonder Sherlock had been chain smoking yesterday. The prospect of getting close to John must be terrifying. It must go against every instinct he has. It must—
John can hear the exact moment when Sherlock stops breathing, holding the air inside his lungs as he waits for John to go on.
“Well, I’m certainly going to give it my best shot. Lie down, please.”
John snaps. “Then why the bloody hell are you here? At
“What do you mean?”
“It’s the annual Christmas party at Au Lit. I was going to take you and make you wear it while we danced. The techno music would have been quite transcendental.”
“Thank you.”
After a few minutes of this Sherlock delves his fingertips into the strands, pressing the pads into John’s skull.
“It was busy today. You’re dead on your feet, so, short staffed. You skipped lunch to help out. A small child vomited on you, hence why you changed into scrubs. I like them by the way.” Sherlock is making his way down John’s shoulder now, his hands roaming over John’s arse, groping him through the thin, wet cotton.
I resisted. Just barely. “It smelled too good. Your mouth was watering. You just had to have a taste of it that instant.”
“Jesus Christ,” you gasped, when you could, collapsed against me and breathing into my neck. I stroked your back and rocked forward against your leg which was trapped between my own. I made a small sound, involuntary and needy, and you put your hand to the small of my back and urged me to do it again. It didn’t take long. I was so close. From the ripe scent of your body and the supple push of your lips and your tongue, and the way your breasts with your tight, hard nipples brushed against mine…
The realization leaves John reeling a bit, because compared to the length and breadth of the sexual knowledge that Sherlock Holmes would have accrued over two decades of rigorous and methodical wanking, what the bloody hell does John have to offer in it’s place?
“Hello, then, what’s this?” Sherlock jerked back; he hadn’t heard John approach, so intent were they on the bee. Jarred by his sudden movement the bee flew off, making her way back towards the hive.
Complete with a first rate scowl directed in Nancy’s direction.
“I love you,” he whispered into my skin, over and over.
I leaned down and swallowed him whole.
This is the part that admittedly makes him the most nervous. He’s unsure what his gag reflex will be. He’s concerned with how to breathe properly.
“You’ll see.”
Kissing.
“Yes, but they had no Chopin or Bach, and I wanted to teach you how to waltz and this one seemed to match the overall tone of the day. So.” Sherlock takes a breath. “Will you?”
They watch each other for a long moment; tension, a wire pulled taut between them.
“Yes.” Nosing down to John’s ear. “I want to see it.”
“Yes.”
True.
“Are you sure we can’t just celebrate here?” I tried one last time. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to indulge his incurable romanticism by letting him wine and dine and music me into a state just bordering transcendental, but I knew that by the end of it we would both be yawning and the evening would end with us curled up around each other, snoring into each other’s ears, all our other needs sated, save the carnal. In all honesty it sounded quite perfectly lovely, and he had worked hard to put it all together, but I could still feel his hands on me from earlier. An evening spent kissing him would have been on par with listening to any symphony known to man. I simply cannot get enough of him.
Sherlock presses a button on the remote and then lays in it down. Just as the first ringing note of his violin sings out from the speakers he reaches down and turns the dildo on.
“So I started experimenting and one thing led to another…”
Sherlock heart was doing that strange somersaulting again. It made his throat tight, his chest hot. It made him feel oddly nauseous. He licked his lips and nodded. “Ok.”
I sunk down, taking him deeper. Two knuckles and more, until I was rocking against his palm.
And I, well, I try my best to make him happy.
John, dizzy with desire, breaks out in a cold sweat. It gathers at the base of his spine and at his nape, prickles in his fringe.
Kissing.
“Good, good. Um. Right.”
John hums, a low rumble in his chest, and moves around behind Sherlock to spread him open.
Sherlock’s mouth is a snarl of pain and fury. His words, a scalpel, eviscerating. “You’ve been uncomfortable the entire time. I’ve been brushing it off, explaining it away. Well, I don’t need your pity fucks and I don’t need your pity proposal. And I don’t need your pity to keep me alive. I can do that fine on my own.”
“When you touch me, there will be a spark emitted. It will feel like static electricity.”
He and Sherlock duck across the car to sit along the seats facing down the mountain. Just as they settle the door clicks shut and the gondola begins to move and only then does John realize they’re not alone.
John…
You toss them onto the chair behind you and climb up onto your bed and he spreads his legs to let you crawl between them. Him below you, honey on the charcoal of your sheets, he reaches up to cup your elbows. Hair tousled, a rosy flush on his chest and throat, you set your hands to the hard jut of his hips and dip your thumbs into the vee, stroking the skin just above the waistband of his pants.
Just like John wanted.
I'm going to try really hard to finish this fic by Christmas. It feels like an impossible goal right now but I'm going to give it my best shot. Any cheerleading or ball busting is appreciated. <3 <3 <3
There is only forward.
In a fit of pique and pettiness I swallowed the pill.
Sherlock blinks.
You survived.
“Pardon me?” John said, blinking stupidly at Sherlock. “Did she tell you that?”
Sherlock scrunches up his nose and gives John his best, You’re An Idiot™, look and something inside John unclenches.
“Oh, fuck you,” John gasps, twisting. “Fuck you,” growling and laughing and slinging his leg over Sherlock’s and levering up, pushing Sherlock over and trapping him beneath him. John squeezes his knees into Sherlock’s waist and pins his wrists over his head. He’s about to tear him a new one, but one look and John stops.
“Christ, you’re lovely, you know that?” You shake your head and scoff, because
John swallows thickly. Bends down and takes a sip. The whiskey burns on the way down, but John can feel faint flickers of warmth take hold in his stomach. It steadies him. Enough for him to meet Sherlock’s indifferent gaze once more.
But in this moment he can let it be.
John could…
John just has the presence of mind to pull the sheet up his body to tuck it around his shoulders before Sherlock bursts through the door, his face white, his eyes wide. He looks…scared.
“Here, let me,” John said, stepping up close beside Sherlock and wrapping his hand around the handle, below Sherlock’s. The brief touch snapped with static electricity and sent a sizzling shock traveling up Sherlock’s arm, penetrating his fog once more. Sherlock looked down at him, but John was already shuffling along the counter’s edge to set the kettle in its base and switch it on.
“What’s going on with you?” Sherlock asks, looking personally offended, as John sidles further down the counter, until he’s safely around the corner, putting some space between him and Sherlock so that he can breathe, breathe.
You try.
The urge to reach over and lay his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder is overwhelming, but John stops himself. Sherlock wouldn’t appreciate it, he doesn't think. Even if the reason why they were heading down to Sussex was to go over the cottage that Sherlock’s mother had left to him in her will. Even if, six months ago, Sherlock had come home from the reading of the will and asked John if it would be all right—Sherlock still dressed in bespoke black wool, his curls finger-mussed and wild, his eyes distraught—would John like to retire to Sussex with him whenever that time should present itself? And when John had said yes—unthinking, reflexive, reckless,
When Sherlock is finally naked and John is finished folding his pants neatly beside his rolled up socks in the middle drawer, Sherlock turns to face him.
Sherlock twitches, but doesn’t move away. “Not funny,” he mutters, running his hands along the bottom of the tub.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you,” John says, pushing her weekly selections back across the smooth wood counter towards her.
A small voice taunted.
Sherlock shifts his weight onto his left forearm and reaches with his right.
What they didn’t know though is that they would’ve been engaged if it wasn’t for this. Sherlock knew it for a few weeks, John was planning on proposing yesterday if he wasn’t stuck in the hospital because it was the day they met and John decided that was the best time to do it.
The two had started living together after a few months. It surprised him how easy John was, he didn’t need much or asked much, he was just happy to be with Sherlock and didn’t seem as surprised or disgusted with the fact he took interest in murders and told John’s whole life story on their first date from looking, instead john praised him for his observation skill which was especially unexpected for Sherlock but he welcomed it with open arms, John really was something different.
“I wasn’t there when you woke up, I couldn’t be there. I remember hearing my little brother, that boy who used to be annoying me every second in a good way got into a car crash. It felt like the world had stopped completely, like there was nothing else in the world going on, as though time had frozen. Then came then news you didn’t even remember your own name, I was certainly afraid.’’ Mycroft admitted and Sherlock realized how hard that must’ve been on him.
“Sherlock.’’
“Alright, as long as it doesn’t get too embarrassing.’’ John said with a chuckle, Sherlock grinned.
“Just a beer.’’ It was still relitavely early for the hours he stayed up so he didn’t want to overdo it, on the luck he’d remember that. The last time Sherlock drank didn’t exactly turn out well and he wasn’t too eager to try and experience that again, he really didn’t want to do that again.
Sherlock couldn’t believe that this happened to him, it partially did. He knew John wouldn’t blame him and no one else would either but he couldn’t help but to blame himself, if he just told John he could’ve done it alone this one time and maybe even forced him to stay home they’d be engaged by now. John followed him and during a certain intense fight with the person Sherlock was chasing John got shot. It wasn’t a fatal wound, that was obvious as it was in his shoulder but it took the ambulance a bloody long time to arrive and by then he had lost quite a bit of blood even though Sherlock was able to do anything to lessen it.
Sherlock smiled at John, he now did notice the silent sound coming from him, it was almost cute. At least it was definitely as cute as snoring could get. Trusting the better, Sherlock got back into bed and decided to do his best to fall asleep again.
“This is quite a lot. How’d you get it just from photos.’’ Greg asked curiously and Sherlock shrugged, despite his memory problem he still felt like most people were absolute idiots. He might not be able to remember things very long or sometimes not even at all but he had found a solution to that and still people just acted so stupid, he wasn’t sure if they did it on purpose or accidentally.
A few minutes later his parents walked back inside to comfort him. No one brought up his issue though, the fact that he wasn’t able to remember his name. He knew they didn’t pass it off as nothing, he knew because otherwise he would’ve never called his parents. He knew it wasn’t just because he was panicking, the doctor knew something was wrong but he also knew no one was going to tell him and it frustrated him endlessly.
His heartbeat had become steady and at a normal pace is what the Doctors told him, he had a high chance of recovering so he should not worry too much yet everyday he found himself only being able to recognize the way to the hospital and walking the same route over and over again and sitting there the whole day. He knew there were a few people in the hospital getting worried, they even considered calling it an obsession.
“Of course it is. I want to know what you’re doing, technically I’m breaking every law about confidentiality so I need to know you’re not doing stupid things or useless things or even releasing things to the media.’’ Greg said and chuckled at the sight. It was nothing less than he had expected of Sherlock although he imagined it would be slightly neater for a university student who was constantly prancing around in suits.
“I couldn’t have said it better.’’
The two had their arguments, one even became so bad Sherlock left their house for a whole week but it also reminded them that you shouldn’t always agree on everything and that it was healthy to have arguments about something in a relationship, it happened to every relationship once in a while no matter how perfect the people felt for each other, difference occurred.
“That can happen. Do you want something to drink, water maybe?’’ She asked him just as kindly as she did before, he stifled a nod. He felt pathetic, he knew he wasn’t extremely young as his body felt lanky yet he didn’t even remember his name.
Worse than we thought. Sherlock knew what it meant, he heard a few words drop about ‘memory’ ‘amnesia and ‘temporarily’ but those four words echoed through his mind. He wondered what they expected, did they expect he would wake up fine in a hospital with a vague memory of what happened, did they expect he would at least remember his name? He wondered what they were saying to his parents but he didn’t dare ask, it was rude.
He had decided to quit for a while, he thought it would be better to review this whole case completely sober but he had to admit he missed it, it just did something to him that changed him completely yet also left him exactly like he was that made it extremely nice to just get high, he kept al his wits to him and he could even argue he got brighter whenever he was high, he was more open and spotted different things than he usually would’ve.
Sherlock smiled at the list he had made that day, it was simple as it was already late and he had remembered who John was luckily. He texted him and John immediately responded, it became a bit too flirtatious for Sherlock’s liking but he played along. After just a short week they were going on their first date which was now.
The feeling he got when he first heard about the crash had been one that stuck with him and you could say even plagued him. It felt like his heart almost stopped, it was like that in all honesty. His breath stopped for a second and he put the phone down, he was staring at the wall and felt his thoughts come to a sudden halt. He got up and turned the call off before racing to the hospital, he needed to get there as quickly as possible.
“Haven’t seen you here before.’’ Sherlock glanced up at the man who was speaking to him, he had blonde hair and blue eyes. He seemed around the same age as Sherlock, Sherlock immediately noticed the surprising amount of muscle yet the way he carried himself didn’t seem to imply he was the man to do that to brag so he either really kept in shape or it was for something he had planned. He seemed like a kind person, humble without a doubt when it came to the state of his clothing. “Suppose.’’
He stared down at his book, he didn’t even remember what the book was about as he both forgot it and didn’t really pay attention to it. He closed it and was left to think for a while; he had nothing else to do. He had given up studying on Geography, the chapter was extremely unimportant and he couldn’t remember it, he started and five minutes later when he stopped he had completely forgotten it already and he was only growing more frustrated the more he tried.
Two weeks later he was discharged, the doctor merely said he might have some trouble remembering but he knew it was worse otherwise he wouldn’t look as concerned as he did. Yet ten minutes later when they were driving in the car he was afraid to ask the question that had popped in his mind.
He hadn’t been hindered a lot in the past year despite that this made everything harder. He mostly had issues with petty things, remembering names, dates, titles of things, little details and a lot more but it hadn’t affected him too much, everything he could avoid by making a few lists or writing down notes.
“Mycroft, shouldn’t you be doing something sophisticated?’’ Sherlock commented with an uninterested tone, Mycroft chuckled and decided to sit down next to him. Mycroft took the book from him and read the title before opening it, curiously staring at the words that were written inside. “Don’t worry too much.’’ Mycroft commented.
Sherlock chuckled lightly, he and John had gotten married around a year after the accident happened. John’s shoulder was fine, it was worse than before but seeing a physical therapist everything had slowly become better up to the point where the different wasn’t really noticeable anymore, John just sometimes winced when he leant on his right shoulder too much but that was all. It didn’t hit any core bones so none of his bones got fractured, nothing changed.
Because of this he decided to start a wall about John, the idea at first made John shy and immediately say he shouldn’t but Sherlock admitted it was more for himself, he never knew if one day he might wake up and forget who the man next to him was, he once forgot his own brother and he didn’t want to take any risks. So he decided to start the wall, he’d pin papers into it with little things written about John so if he one day would wake up without any memory of the amazing human beside him he could look at it and calm himself down.
Despite all the memory issues he somehow always was able to remind himself to make sure to avoid Mycroft in whatever way he could which mostly meant going to places far away from security cameras and his apartment, Mycroft had been getting more and more control over secret services and stuff alike but he still didn’t have all the control so Sherlock took pleasure in how easy it still was to get away from his watchful eye, he knew he meant well but that didn’t mean he liked it.
What happened next he was unsure of, he had a vague memory and the things his parents told him. A doctor came within a few seconds and his parents were immediately called. The Doctor tried to communicate with him but he was unable to, the nurse did get through to him though. She told him to make a list if he could, different things he could remember and try to say them in order, focus on saying them. And so he went.
“You need to observe. It’s obvious if you look at her ring, the dampness you reported on his clothes. It’s all obvious if you’re able to look. Also, the way you described him from the interview he seemed to be a little bit too eager and almost happy to be involved into a murder mystery which isn’t their usual reaction.’’ Sherlock commented and Greg shrugged but had to admit he was right, it did seem logical.
He knew his memory problems were severe when this happened, he couldn’t remember the simplest things sometimes and it frustrated him beyond belief yet no matter how hard he thought about things he couldn’t remember, sometimes he did a few minutes later but often it took a very long time to remember again. He felt a panic strike him, what if he suddenly forgot his name when someone asked? What if he forgot where home was when he needed to go there along?
“Of course.’’
“Can you help me with Geography?’’ Sherlock’s voice was quiet like he was ashamed, Mycroft just smiled in response.
He sat down and groaned in annoyance, he had been forgetting a lot ever since the last time and it was starting to get annoying, he was starting to get convinced his memory was becoming even worse than it already was and it was already about to collapse onto the ground, there wasn’t much that could make it worse yet somehow it was.
Ever a few years ago the notes didn’t become things to remember John by, it became notes he wrote to himself as snarky comments for when he woke up as he always did before John and liked to look over his wall. His memory had gotten slightly worse, it took him a bit more attention to remember details and it was becoming close to impossible to remember them whenever he was experiencing a lot of negative emotions but it rarely happened and he imagined it was slightly inevitable that his memory wouldn’t get worse with age. That’s what age does to you.
“Was this how you felt when the car crash happened? There was an endless numbness at first which changes into an endless anxiety which I’m guessing only stoops when he wakes up.’’ Sherlock said, he didn’t look at Mycroft but he imagined the expression that came onto his face.
“Fine. Here, I think this is supposed to be it.’’ Sherlock pointed to a few things he had pinned into the wall and Greg started to look at it and observe it whilst Sherlock went over to the notepad resting in his chair as he needed to check everything and try his best to remember. This man is Greg Lestrade, he’s from Scotland yard and you’re helping him on a case. See the wall, that should be enough to make you recall.
Sherlock still clearly remembered when it happened; he went to a birthday part of one of the people he knew. He knew he liked the boy but he couldn’t quite remember his name, not that it was relevant now. The parents of the boy were kind and decided to bring him home as both of his parents and his brother were busy. There was a drunk driver on the road, one on his phone and one who wasn’t watching the road. It was a true miracle no one died, most came away with harsh injuries but they were physical and everyone could recover but Sherlock.
Greg had given him more and more cases and seemed to start to care less about the whole confidentiality laws and more about solving the case with was, in Sherlock’s opinion, a good thing to do. This time it was quite simple but he kept from telling Greg just to make sure all his deductions were right, the worse his memory got the less he trusted himself and he knew a lot of this was done when he was high all after the other so he just wanted to make sure everything was correct and that he hadn’t noted bullshit down.
he thought, and then tsked at himself and pushed the thought aside.
“Keep trying,” John said, stepping down and away to stand by the center seat again… staring at the screen, now dark with space in which the only bright thing was a tiny silvery dot of a disc some tens of millions of miles away.
The eyes widened. All the shadows wrapped around them in the meld stirred with amazement and alarm and oh, such unspeakable
Anderson moved the sliders and everything dissolved in a shimmer of light.

“Quite.”
“You’ll proceed from level to level, checking out every meter of tunnel,  every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum.” He looked from face to face, intent. “And remember this. Fifty people have already died. I want no more deaths.”
complicated,” Sh’lok said. “But simple. S’kroft is Head-to-be of the greater family of which mine is part, and thereby Clan-brother to all of us in my line. Also, quite by chance, he’s closer to me than almost any Vulcan beyond my immediate family, for his mother took a liking to mine when Sarek took her to wife…”
Contempt, carefully muted, flared in her eyes, tangled up with anger—again very managed.
“You and Hudders get Sh’lok ready,” John said. “Because the hunt is
John paused in his pacing and glared at the two of them. “I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen,” he said. “I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer.”
He slid his fingers through them in unabashed admiration, gently rubbing Sh’lok’s scalp. Sh’lok pushed back against the massage, humming softly, almost a purr.

“Captain,” Sh’lok said, with the air of someone delivering news of the utterly obvious to the woefully unobservant. “The Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste.”
John abandoned himself to the pleasure of Sh’lok’s tongue in him, Sh’lok’s fingers in him, probing, sounding his depths, laying his body open as his mind already was. Blending with it was the constant awareness of Sh’lok’s anticipation, his delight, and his hardness, the drumming throb within it slowly and inexorably increasing in pace. Soon John’s whole consciousness seemed to be consumed by that rhythm, his desperately hard cock’s own throbbing, and by the movement of his own body as it thrust against Sh’lok of its own volition.
John thought, and had to laugh.
climate?” Lestrade just snorted at him. “If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will!”
“Still,” John said, and buried his face in the curls for one last second. Then he sat up. “Come on, Sh’lok. I’ll get down there and give them one last chance to size us up. Maybe we’ll have to resign ourselves to giving Starfleet the bad news and leaving them to their own devices. But who knows…”

put it together. That being the point at which she decided a more active role was required, however much anguish it caused her.”
Bradstreet was worrying at the belt that had been the source of the anguish. “Molecular locking of some kind,” he said. “We’re not going to be able to get these off without tools that are a lot more advanced..”
“And if he does, so what?” Lestrade said. “It was a fight to the death. And you were dead.” He shrugged. “No pulse, no respiration, damn near no brain activity. And if later on, that got better?” He raised his eyebrows. “Fine, that’s my division, granted. But Vulcan’s legal code’s
Indeed he could feel the disgusting pressure of the organisms all along the barriers of his mind, as he had told John and the Doctor: pressing in, incessant, unrelenting. They constituted a hive mind of sorts, so old as to be almost immortal, and no species they had met in many millennia had been able to resist them for long. They knew that by numbers and persistence alone they could eventually wear him down.
Vulcans, after all, were not seen by the Earth-humans who ran the Empire as being in any way equal to humans. Too many Vulcans had initially refused the Empire in the name of the species’ indigenous pacifist culture, which was quickly stamped out by a pragmatic Vulcan planetary government more interested in species survival. And indeed the Vulcans had only survived as part of the Empire by reverting so quickly to the older, more savage and warlike culture that underlay their pacifism. The Empire had realised that further aggressive moves against the Vulcans would cost the Empire far more than it would recoup afterwards… so they had stepped back from the. brink. But there was still much old bad feeling against the Vulcans that had never quite gone away, a mixture of
“I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get their diagnostic panels back from the lab,” Lestrade said. “But they’re both in extreme pain. I’ve sedated them both heavily… but your sister-in-law seems to have a high tolerance, and the tranquilliser hasn't affected her much.”
Delighted.
“Old style photoelectric cells?” Mrs. Hudson said, and sniffed. “Seems a bit downmarket after that ion drive…”
He made his way over to Sh’lok’s station, where his First Officer was straightening up from the viewer after the latest of several brief conferences with Mrs. Hudson. Sh’lok glanced up at him. “Planet development here was reported normal on the last visit of a Federation visit to this region five years ago, Captain,” Sh’lok said.

All John could think of to do was to fold his arms as casually as possible on the top of the Transporter console and say, “Shoot. You’re wasting time.”
Connected to a higher part of the installation there by a metallic cable or cord, and resting on a softly glowing spherical support faired into the console, was what looked like a transparent helmet studded with smooth and shining metal spikes in an irregular array across its top. “If I may explain, Captain,” Sh’lok said. “She refers to the massive database containing the assembled knowledge of the Builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive storehouse of data, many millennia old.”
The Transporter room doors opened and Mr. Sh’lok came in. “Lieutenant Donovan has had no further response to our signals, Captain,” he said.
He’d been up looking over some slightly dodgy readings at the Environment station and was making his way back around the upper circle of the Bridge when Donovan turned toward him as John was passing her station.” Captain,” she said as she was putting in her earpiece, “something's coming in on the Starfleet channel. Priority and urgent, sir.”
But what John
Sh’lok’s look softened. “Because you care about them,” he said. “And don’t mind them seeing that such caring can take other forms than merely repeatedly saving their lives.”
Finally she had no choice but to notice him. Donovan pulled out her earpiece—which had already told her everything she needed to hear—and levelled a cool flat no-expression expression at him that was meant to say,
“Men?” said the humanoid, as if it was a new word to him.
“Perhaps later,” Sh’lok said. John nodded. He’d been spending time lately introducing Sh’lok to the vegetarian side of Indian food (and having a lot of innocent and not-so-innocent fun introducing him to the hotter chilies). But the next lesson could keep.
Coming April 27...

At first John was confused. Then— “Wait,” he said. “I remember.”
He nodded, and he and Sh’lok and Lestrade looked toward the screen. “Open the channel, Lieutenant,” John said. “Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS

Glimpses of life in a Federation mostly at peace, with trouble sometimes flaring out at the edges of things, of course, and difficulties with the Romulans and Klingons, yes—but hardly an Empire busy with grinding other competing cultures into abject surrender or oblivion. The “near Federation” as a young John Watson had seen it during his Academy training— Starfleet San Francisco, Starfleet Utopia Planitia and Saturn Reservation; the near-Earth Starbases at Pluto Outer and Oort Inner, at Alphacent, Wolf 359 and 61 Cygni / Flying Star. His crew assignments on Starfleet vessels as John climbed through the ranks, ensign to lieutenant to lieutenant commander on

A good while later, John was in bed and lingering near the brink of sleep while considerations and reconsiderations of the day’s events continued to chase themselves around in circles. The din was finally beginning to quiet down when an errant thought wandered across John’s mind.
The words “Kobayashi Maru” drifted by in the back of John’s mind.
“Four minutes and eighteen seconds…” Sh’lok said as they went out the door together.
John turned and stood still as his eyes got used to the dimness in the shuttle bay. To either side of him, pale half-seen boxy shadows, the two shuttlecraft
, either, and in any case Bones didn’t seem fussed about it. From his side of the screen, where he very much preferred to stay, John couldn’t see Lestrade’s hands… but Bones’s face was calm and composed and alert, and he was moving quickly back there, with the air of a man wasting no motions and completely absorbed in his work.
John dismissed the Security detail, thanked Mrs. Hudson, and headed out. Lestrade went with him in an advanced state of annoyance. “John, that man is
A second later Sh’lok was practically on top of him, the
“Chief Vanderberg’s office. I can put you down in there a meter or so away from him if you like.”
John hitched himself up enough off the bed to get his trousers slid down, then kicked them to the floor and turned to half-face Sh’lok. For a second or three John sat there with one leg now partially up on the bed and bent at the knee, his crotch angled toward the man who still sat gazing down at it, his thumbs hooked into the waistband of his own trousers, seemingly forgotten.
“Aye aye, sir.”
And then John heard him go on to murmur the rest of the very old words, the words of the normal completion of the ceremonial.

Slowly he went over to her, knelt down. It had happened to John before, occasionally, in the line of duty, that some terrible thing had occurred and everything around him had seemed to move with preternatural slowness. Now it seemed as if the air around them all had gone thick, and in order to move at all John had to push his reaching hand out through it, feeling as if it was resisting him. He took hold of the woman’s arm and gently turned her over. And it was wrong,

John thought.
He snapped the communicator shut and put it away, turning back to Vanderberg. The man didn’t look even slightly reassured. “What happens when it breaks down?”

John blinked. “Well, first of all, because you’re a good man, and you deserve to survive.”
“Yes,” John said. “From the very first, I appreciated your ability—”
“Aye, sir.”
Sh’lok’s reaction to this was one that worried John more than the previous perplexity; Sh’lok was starting to look
John shouted.
John refused to look at him. “Request denied.”

“S’kroft,” Sh’lok said, more intensely, more desperately, as if every word he was pushing out was costing him some unspeakable price. “I

Anderson, normally fairly restrained about being asked to make any judgment call whatsoever, was standing there wide-eyed. “Witnessed,” he said.
It took John a moment to find his voice again. “All right,” he said. “Well. Then maybe we could take a quick look at one minor issue before we start exploring this together. And that would have to do with, um. Orientation…”

present performance was leading some people at Starfleet to consider her a panacea for the universe’s short-term ills. Sometimes it left him feeling chuffed, but right now such an interruption would just be a nuisance. “We need to get started.”
John moved nearer to Anderson, quick but cautious, getting close, tempting him to lunge a couple of times— then moved to his left until the diagnostic table was between them.
John shook his head, dropped it into his hands for a moment. “Oh, God,” he said again; then looked up. “…But Sh’lok,
“Mr. Sh’lok,” John said. Sh’lok came up to stand beside him; John turned his head and gave him a look. “’Capture it?’ I don't recall giving any such order.”
“Do not move,” Kara said. “If your weapon kills, it will kill

of the struck gong pulled John out of his thoughts. “I wonder when his T’Eyreen arrives,” Lestrade said.
Sh’lok reached out and touched John’s face again. “My John,” he said softly, so softly, like a man who fears someone will hear him and stop him from saying a thing not to be hoped for, a wish until now never spoken except between dream and waking… yet now somehow impossibly possible in the broad light of day.
And with all his might he threw it out into the faintly jewel-sparkling darkness.
WATSON
Unfortunately, and as he’d greatly feared, this meant first the Doctor and then John. Nonetheless Sh’lok attempted to keep the worst and most personal information to himself, only revealing the details of his condition when his Captain forced the issue by direct command. In this matter at least he had no choice. Though there were numerous possible responses to situations that transcended even the discipline of the service, disobeying John Watson when he spoke from the authority of his position was not one of them.
At least for the moment he was succeeding, as Sh’lok seemed to have turned his attention to John’s chest hair. For John’s part, it was rare enough for him to have time or opportunity to lie awake in this bed without thoughts of duty intruding. They were doing that now. “We have some things to think about,” he said.
He turned to Donovan. “The energy pulses… They’re regular. They’re
“No no,” John said through the hole, “just you wait there. There’s going to be shouting. Mr. Sh’lok, but it’s not going to be because of distance.”
“This is the land of my family,” Sh’lok said. “It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This…” He looked around him with what to John was clearly identifiable as unease. “…is our place of
“I should always wish to be where I was required,” Sh’lok said, very low, and made no move to break that gaze. “It seems logical.”
When a Vulcan said something so nakedly declaratory, there was no option to take it as anything but a fact. Together they started to make their way down the tunnel in which they stood.
WATSON
The two liveried Vulcans carrying the long purple-wrapped bundles stepped forward. One knelt before the dais and set down his bundle, unwrapping it: another knelt before John and did the same.
Donovan blinked. “Yes.”
Both amused and bemused, Watson finishes helping the Vulcan up. He wobbles

Sh’lok stopped as if struck still.
Lestrade didn’t bother answering that—just reached out and pressed the hyposprayer into John’s bicep.
The meld came apart around them. And as it did, a whisper, an echo:
Mrs. Hudson nodded. “True, but there’d never be all that much official traffic through here with so little settlement activity in the sector,” she said. “That’s common enough for small colonies out at the edge of things, so far away from more heavily populated areas.” She looked thoughtfully at the screen. “When they first set Deneva up as a colony it was more a commercial project than a Federation one, though I’m sure there was a lot of grant money involved. I heard that initially there were thoughts about trying to push Deneva as a tourist destination, since there’s no arguing the planet’s quite a lovely place. But after that the emphasis turned toward establishing it as a freight transshipping hub for this whole sector.”
“I sort of hate this to be over. For this little while… no responsibilities. Nothing but here, and now, and us…”
“But one other thing you haven't mentioned,” John said, going almost tongue-tied with fear that this might
“So,” John said. “Shortly I’m going to have to get out of here and get back to my people so we can all get ourselves the hell home.”
Sh’lok had left a queen’s pawn in an undefended uplevel position for some moves as if trying to suggest that he’d forgotten about it (which was ridiculous) or that he was intending to use it to spring some kind of trap (which as far as John could tell looked unlikely, but this was, after all, Sh’lok).
“Biology,” Sh’lok said a little more loudly.
She’d already turned her gaze back to the device, and so missed the unnerved expression that John was forced to conceal after it almost slipped out. “But it’s so damned impersonal,” she said. “There’s just no
separation while he dealt with utterly mundane things, “…the bed, yeah? There’s a spot where if you need quick access, you can just kick it. Right here—”
Luma, alarmed by this (or maybe alarmed by how close she thought John was getting to her leader’s armband) leapt out of her seat and hurried around the table. “Do not take them, Kara! Do not take them to the Controller!”
John decided that for purposes of good order in his command, it would possibly be best for him never to have heard this conversation... at least if questioned about it on the record. He stood up and stretched. “Mr. Sh’lok,” he said, “I’m for the Mess, and a cuppa. And as for you, I don’t think you’ve had much to eat today. I know
But the humanoid was in no mood for further discussion. He pushed John away and fled away among the boulders without a backward look.
The look on the Vulcan’s face went positively scandalized. “Surely you know the basics about them, Captain,” Sh’lok said. “You do
breathe again, and to find enough strength in his limbs to pull close the long lean body that clutched at his, shuddering, throbbing with a last few pulses from deep inside him. Sh’lok’s mind was awash in a soul-deep sense of utter completion the likes of which John had never imagined… and as it flowed over him too, irresistible, John willingly let go and let it pull him under.
Instantly a metal shutter slammed down along that thin line John had spotted, sealing the “cavern” entrance, and the whole room dropped at great speed. Lestrade staggered. When he’s recovered a little, he muttered, “Call Hudders and tell her to send my stomach down…”
John swallowed.
John leaned on the computer console and fiddled with the controls on top of it, idly punching the button that made it display its “ready to operate” light. He had never before wished so hard that he could think “outside the envelope” on command.
“I know this is killing the whole lot of you,” John said, “so let me put you out of your misery. I can’t say much but this much I can tell you. Mr. Sh’lok’s wedding did not come off quite as expected.”

“Higher than we might think, I’m told,” John said, his mind flashing instantly to a night some months back, late at night across the chess boards from Sh’lok, when the discussion had wandered into recent advances in alternate-universe “sheaf theory.” Shortly he’d found himself floundering at the deep end of a conversation (or an affectionate lecture, as “conversation” implies an exchange during which both parties are equipped to hold their own) containing phrases like “Heisenbergian hyperstring resonations” and “dynamic adjacency” and “blind brane convergence,” and
But then, as they waited for a lift up to the primary hull, Sh’lok put everything right. “Normally, Captain,” he said, “this is the kind of tedious business we would discuss whilst engaging in other activities. Doubtless a human would see it as a form of tension relief.”
, though. Everything carefully sorted, ranked, evaluated…

He went back to his study of the chessboard, and the two of them spent the next few moments in companionable silence.
Lestrade’s reaction was the kind of amusement that might have followed the Science Officer starting to recite some fairy tale. “You're creating fantasies, Mr. Sh’lok.”
John paused in the middle of the hall to let him join him. “I am pleased that you frustrated Mr. Bradstreet's plan. I should regret your death.”

Lestrade let out a weary breath, and shrugged a little. “Who knows, John? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him. But whether he can control it hour to hour—”
He looked across the board at John, plainly making up his mind. “And that same imminence now triggers another issue," Sh'lok said, “an urgent one, for which time to successfully resolve it is quickly running out.”
“Well, sir,” Hudson said, sounding dubious, “I can throw together some odds and ends, but it won't hold for long. Forty-eight hours maybe, with a bit of luck.”

John knew that when they made their way back up to the primary hull the corridors would be fairly quiet, though by no means empty. While ship’s evening was well along, and the corridor lighting had already dimmed down in accordance with the ship’s circadian programming, second shift was still a couple of hours from signing off to third. There would be a fair number of people about, including those who were off shift and relaxing for the evening.
WATSON
John thought miserably.
Sh’lok turned without further comment and went back to the Transporter console, where Dimmock was still resetting controls. There the Vulcan flicked the comms switch. “Mr. Anderson,” he said, “you will programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities.”
John regarded this half with interest, half with regret. “Well, you can be hurt, can't you,” he murmured.
The look with which she favored him now was trying hard to be detached and unmoved, but it was not succeeding. There was a gleam of contempt in her eyes that belied it. “Your name has been much whispered among our people, Sh’lok,” T’Eyreen said. “At first as the strange disrespectful one who spurned his House’s ancient traditions and went forth to seek his fortune among humans. Your story became a cautionary tale, and I realised I had no desire to be consort to one whose tale was told behind closed doors for amusement. Yet of late you are whispered about again, this time as one who despite all expectations has somehow managed to rise high in the Federation’s estimation, even to being called the best First Officer in Starfleet. As such, now you are becoming a legend among our people. And I came to know I also had no desire to be the consort of a legend, lost in the shadow you cast.”
Together they crouched near the tunnel’s end, gazing down its length. “Gone,” John murmured.
SH’LOK
“Back where?”
The doors opened on the Bridge, which contained only its scaled-back evening crew at the moment. Sh’lok nodded and headed to his post, and behind him John sauntered in with the air of a man who was doing a last few chores before bedtime and went over to the short dark duty comms officer, Mr. Garrideb, and outlined the message he wanted sent to Starfleet, and what he needed from the Janus VI end. “Pass those authorizations along to Mr. Sh’lok when they come in, will you? And let me know if you have any problems.”
“Yes it has,” Vanderberg said. “I don't know what this butchering monster is, but I know what it's doing. Our maintenance engineers were sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery. We found them seared to a crisp.”
John made his way back to his quarters, fairly hungry for a few minutes by himself just to think and try to pull himself together for whatever was going to come next. There was a crewman in front of his door, standing guard—
John thought. There was no telling: Vulcan design aesthetics weren’t exactly something he’d ever studied in depth.
The lift doors shut between them. John rubbed at his face with one hand.
John’s eyebrows went up. “Explain.”
John pulled that long body into his arms and pushed his face into its hair.
as she swung into standard orbit. From the morning rounds to the chessboards, none of the day’s events so far had presented any real surprises.
“Captain,” Sh’lok said, urgent, “lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I c-cannot—no Vulcan could explain further!”
do it out loud all the time.”
John thought. Yet he couldn’t bring himself to object too much. Sh’lok had brought back what they needed, a live specimen to study and (ideally) to use to determine whether any countermeasure against the things would work.
Sh’lok said, leaning over and ruffling up the sehlat’s ears. “So! Attend me now. We’ve much work to do, and little time to do it.” He looked around them. “Many things here must for the time being be made safe, held secure. There is an enemy at the gates…”
And he had to smile a somewhat fierce half-smile, because if things went properly, this battle they would both win.
“Like this?”
Like fire, it was a useful  servant but a poor master. And though John found it hard, this kind of thing, he concentrated on breathing through it, letting go, convincing his own barriers to fall.
Sh’lok produced a faintly offended look that told John that was
He hit his comms button. “Yes, Doctor?”
Lestrade’s attention was on the bowl. “What’s this?”
the hell Sh’lok planned to reorganise it all when they’d finally found what they were after and were out of here. He had a feeling the regular scheduling of their chess games was going to suffer.
Then, as Lestrade straightened and (for once completely unwilling to argue the point) staggered away, he saw John Watson’s gaze lock back on Sh’lok’s with an fierce angry intensity that was not only unexpected, but positively alarming.
At which point the door to Sh’lok’s quarters flew open, Dr. Hooper (with a faint shriek) fairly flew out of it, and the bowl of plomeek soup, lid and all, flew out the door right after her and crashed into the opposite wall hard enough to leave a dent.
Lestrade turned, plainly as fascinated by the Horta—now that he was over the initial shock of seeing it—as John was. Slowly he made his way over to the creature and knelt down at its wounded end. Lestrade gave the Vulcan a long assessing look before turning away to focus on the wound, activating his tricorder and the hand sensor synced to it.
“Aye, sir.”
“I think not,” Sh’lok said, as calmly as he could under the circumstances. “Your authority on
He shut up, then, as Sh’lok pulled himself carefully free of the surgical screen, sat up, and stretched. Then he turned to Lestrade. “Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you.”
, he’d started quizzing the tall dark newly-assigned quartermaster about just why this should be. Surely the Captain’s quarters should be closer to the lift than his First Officer’s? Her answer had quickly turned into a complex tangle of crowd vectors and motion studies, command priorities and algorithms, event probabilities and who knew what else. And then something interrupted the explanation… the Gorns? the Organians?… and he’d never got around to following up. Now, though, as they came to Sh’lok’s door John was privately praising Lieutenant Crossby’s punctiliousness to the skies, because it meant that much less time for Sh’lok to fetch the chess set so John could get him into his quarters and… and…
Sh’lok gazed down into John’s eyes, his expression growing more amused but still seeming a little at sea.
Anderson and the other two henchmen stared in astonishment at where the vanished man had been. John sucked in a breath of surprise, glancing upward as if it was possible to meet the eyes of the woman he was sure was in his quarters right now, watching this scene unfold on the little screen hidden behind the sliding panel, adjusting a control.
crutch
John bent down by the woman and got the armband off her wrist as Lestrade knelt by her. “Is she all right?” John said.
John thought. “Back into your body! We brought it along with us.”
“Ready. Right arm first, please.”
And he gave Sh'lok a thoughtful side-eye.
John stood there a while and let the silence and the infinite vista open him out; let himself settle, go quiet and still. …It wasn’t truly, perhaps, a resting state. That frisson of danger, of the risk of standing so exposed to the universe even protected as he was, still trembled along John’s nerves. But he stood there and allowed himself to feel it, for he was about to embark on a new course.
Sh’lok looked grim. “I also have a Captain returning who will immediately report to the Empire on where he’s been and what he’s seen. In turn the Empire will quickly start research on what happened here. Once they analyse the events completely enough to understand the theory behind them, they will look for ways to exploit the effect; weaponise it.” He looked at John with a flicker of distress. “And their first use of it will almost certainly be to return to your… ‘more benign’ world, your Federation… with the intention to dominate it if possible. And destroy it, if not.”
“To say the least,” John said, standing again. “Bones?”
The ersatz Watson pushed himself as near as he dared to the confinement field. “You traitorous pig. I'll hang you up by your Vulcan ears. I'll have you all executed!”
“But why now, Mr. Sh’lok? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years.”
And a clock started ticking in John’s head.
SH’LOK
But to do that you’ve got to keep this data safe from the Empire. And to do
“Port batteries locked—”
Sh’lok glanced away from John, then, and at one of the nearby piles of silicon nodules, indicating it with his phaser hand.
Sh'lok stood there looking grave. “I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain,” he said. “We already know this aggregate-creature or species has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more.”
Sh’lok’s spare hand slid around to find John’s face again, along with the pressure points where the meld could be controlled and deepened or brought into sharper focus.
Did you bet a lot?
He caught Hudders’ eye and pointed from the small dim light receptacle to an identical one across the cavern.
“Strong enough to eat most things you could think of.”
“Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm,” John said. The usual few moments of whirring and blinking ensued. “Correlate following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact or intersection with a parallel universe?”
really
Sh’lok sat up and swung himself around so that he was half-sitting on the bed and looking toward her, while searching for the way to handle this situation that would cause her the least pain. “I had a most startling dream,” he said at last. “You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you.”
Bradstreet looked at him with interest. “If it’ll trap the humanoids for the Others, Captain, won't it trap us, too?”
Sh’lok had to know
Lestrade stood reading the lab report on the padd, and as John turned toward him he saw the blood drain from Bones’s face as he read.
The others were nodding. “It happened twice,” John said. “First we were in our own Transporter chamber. Then we faded… and then when we finally materialised, we were here.” He looked around him. “Wherever this is.”
So Sh’lok, a little bemused by the good-humored way in which this ultimatum was delivered, got up on the damn bed and let Lestrade get on with his work.
“One thing at a time, Sh’lok,” John said. “Your key. Let’s get busy.”
That was when John heard a sudden hubbub of voices down the tunnel.
John shook his head. “Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me? Reverse your course. Acknowledge!”
he thought, feeling a bit nettled.
John could have burst out laughing with absurd relief. If he needed evidence that Sh’lok’s
S’kroft,” Sh’lok said. “My eyes—are flame. My
He turned back to the table and reached for one… and the Morg standing there put a massive hand up and placed it on John’s chest in a way that suggested he didn’t want to have to hurt him…
John stopped next to Sh’lok where he stood before the dais. “This is Watson,” Sh’lok said.
His Captain, ever the daring gambler, had staked on this game nothing less than his reputation and his entire career. Should his gamble on the response of Starfleet’s upper echelons go against him, John would soon enough find himself living a life in which his best destiny—the occupation of the central position at the heart of a starship—would be lost to him forever. All Sh’lok could do in the moments to come (he thought on that last day, as they got into the turbolift that would take them to the Transporter Room) would be to get through the imminent ordeal in such a way that he could afterward turn his full attention to repaying the life-debt incurred.
“At the risk of appearing insubordinate,” Sh’lok said, “I feel I must claim that position for my own.”
warps out for M-113 and points beyond
John turned away to make sure she didn’t notice him noticing her. There was already enough pain to go around. “Get him back to the Sickbay,” John said to Lestrade. “Use security restraints.”
Against Sherlock’s better instinct he decided to go out, he was unsure what he wanted to do but he just wanted to get outside and do something, it didn’t even really matter what it was anymore. Because of this his first thought went to coffee and his idea was to go and get a coffee which messed up a bit as his eyes landed on a pub and he decided to just walk in there, he didn’t know why but it could be that he was getting frustrated and just wanted to do the first thing he saw.
The worst part was the pity, the hushed whispers and the little comments made. He learnt to deal with them, it wasn’t hard to act like he usually did but it was definitely annoying. He couldn’t always deal with it and pass it off though, the moments when he was nervous and forgot a name he had known for years, the sniggers and just everything sometimes was just too much.
He slipped out of bed and took the most recent note which he recognized by the date he had written on it, it was something he started to do a few months in for sentimental reasons but for nothing but that.
The nurse came back with a glass of water and a few crackers, something to keep him from fainting the doctor explained. He took them and even though they were dry he enjoyed the taste of something in his mouth.
The moment his parents stepped into his room the Doctor had told them he might suffer from anterograde amnesia, short term memory loss was a simpler form but not completely true. They warned that he might have a hard time the next weeks with remembering recent things, he might not even remember things but they also said chances of recovery were high as they weren’t sure how much damage there truly was done so they had to expect short memory loss but that wouldn’t necessarily remain with him all his life.
Sherlock yawned as he opened his eyes. This was the second time that it happened; he woke up rather early and found someone lying beside him. The last time it was worse than now, last time his arms were wrapped around him and clutched him. He had learnt not to panic in these moments, he just reminded himself to look at the wall. The first time his eyes were already fixated onto it and it immediately all came back to him so his panic quickly stopped.
Sherlock was sitting outside with a book in his lap. It took them three weeks after the crash to find out that things weren’t likely to get neither better nor necessarily worse, the doctors tried to find out how it happened or what really was going on but they decided to stick with their initial amnesia type as they noticed Sherlock had the most trouble with remembering new things, they also found out it was likely when he was panicking or experiencing extreme emotions he had a hard time recalling most things.
“Home.’’
John gave the drink fairly quickly and even winked, he seemed to want to make a conversation but was called to the other side of the bar as there were a lot of people hanging around. Sherlock decided to pay it no mind, chances he would visit this bar again were very small and because he just went on to drink his drink.
Sherlock had also explained what John should do if he had a panic attack but John cut him off, telling him he was a doctor and had experience with dealing with them as his sister had them as well.
“But you don’t need to be, John won’t change. They said the damage on his shoulder wouldn’t be too harsh, he needs to see someone but it won’t change him or make a big difference.’’ Sherlock could only hope for that.
The nurse and doctor were amused by his choice but encouraged him, repeating it with him. It took long enough but eventually he calmed down, his breath was normal again, his heart going at a normal pace and his vision as sharp as ever. He still felt afraid, he recognized the stinging feeling in his stomach as one he was all too familiar with.
“Yes you could, you could’ve used your more extensive vocabulary to brag.’’ Mycroft chuckled.
Mycroft had always tried his best to support his brother but had to admit sometimes he was unsure what to do, he wasn’t the most empathetic one and the one trait Sherlock had learnt the best was to hide what he was feeling thanks to Mycroft. Still, he tried to help him with whatever he could but then again Sherlock proved to just get more stubborn and stubborn, refusing help even though he knew he needed it and definitely shouldn’t feel bad for having to ask.
He never forgot John after the hospital.
“Well, most I can say is thanks. So when do you think you’ll be able to finish this all or are there any things you need specifically to be able to finish this?’’ Greg asked and Sherlock nodded, he’d like to interrogate the suspect and the man who gave basically all of the tips, he’d also like to see the scene as the murder hadn’t been done that long ago so there would still be some evidence left.
“Just some things about you, to remind myself. It happened before that I had a bad night and Mycroft spent it in my room yet the moment I woke up I was panicking because this stranger was in my room. If this ever happens I’ll have something to remind me.’’ Sherlock explained, it was very weird when it happened with Mycroft and Mycroft had an idea how to handle a stressing Sherlock but he didn’t know it that well.
Sherlock finally cracked the code to his memories, he still didn’t know how bad it really was as he was unsure how to measure but found out a few things. If he was distracted by anything he liked more there was a very high chance he would forget less important, to him, things or small details like people their names, their age or things alike. This also happened when he was experiencing very strong emotions, when he was in pure rage or having a panic attack. He called those bad days, recently there had been less but that could’ve also been because he had been intoxicated most of the time.
He knew he wasn’t being rational, the chances of John not surviving were almost in the negative yet he still worried every single second. He had never met anyone who had been so patient with him, who cared so much beside his family. He never expected to be with someone like John, someone who was a bit cynical but not too much, kind, a bit sarcastic and he could be a bit of an asshole to people he didn’t like but Sherlock never really saw that side of him, John was the best he could ask for, even better than he hoped for.
“What are you even going to put on here?’’ John asked as he sipped a mug of coffee, Sherlock shrugged. He had a general idea but didn’t think too specific.
Sherlock furrowed his brow and cast a glance at John who was serving a group of people in the corner of the bar. He slipped the paper into his pocket and quickly finished his drink, he left the money on the counter and he left as he was feeling rather conflicted and he didn’t want to fall into any temptation.
He started to record more things as he did feel his memory wasn’t getting much better and he still wanted to look as optimal as he always did, he didn’t want to look any less to Greg although he was convinced Greg had started to form his suspicions about his memory issues after getting his name wrong so many times although he could also take it as a continuous running joke which he really hoped he did.
Sherlock’s phone rung as a signal that John was downstairs and he left after checking he had everything he needed, John was waiting in a parking spot with his car, it was second hand and slightly beaten down but it worked which were John’s literal words. He smiled at John and said a quick hi before getting inside, he had tried his best to make sure he would remember everything he had already asked but sadly he had no guarantee if it was a good or bad day, he couldn’t control his panic attacks. He was hoping for the best.
“Sherlock.’’ Sherlock had glanced up and saw Mycroft looming over him, he immediately noticed Mycroft didn’t look happy, he never really did, but didn’t look sad either, somewhere in between like he was thinking, as usual. He suddenly remembered a memory, something that happened at school once. Someone had pissed him off a lot, worse than a lot, and he made a few deductions which eventually left the boy crying. Just a little later he got called into the principal’s office and had to apologize yet he had no clue of what happened, the principal was outraged to say the least.
Sherlock groaned annoyed once he read his name, he was close but the fact he read the name just a few seconds before made him feel stupid. He knew he was extremely busy with the case and all his thoughts were focused onto that but still, it wasn’t a valid excuse, to him, to forget a name he had read just a few seconds ago.
With a trembling voice he asked: “W-Where are we going?’’ His father looked over his shoulder and was surprised but said nothing for a few seconds, staring back at his mother and then he responded to Sherlock.
With a frustrated groan he decided to just get back to work.
“Gavin.’’ Sherlock said unsure. Greg looked at him as though he was joking but decided not to mention it, it didn’t seem important and then again the two met only two days ago and he also sometimes forgot people their names so he didn’t really decided to think about it too much. With a quick bye and a warning Greg left the apartment.
“Just trying to be nice okay,’’ He chuckled a little. “I’m John.’’
I’m afraid It’ll happen again, if it does then here’s a little thing.
“Sir, you need to leave.’’ He ignored the nurse, she had told him that exactly an hour ago as well yet no one had come yet to physically remove him.
He didn’t say it out loud, he didn’t want them to know he was panicking or at least felt like he was about to, he didn’t want them to know the fear residing inside him. He never wanted them to know, he didn’t want to look weak even if these were his parents. He wanted to feel like he was controlling what was going and so he repeated it over and over again in his head.
Things were getting worse though, despite that obvious things were arranged with his teachers he both didn’t like being treated differently but now it was worse when in subjects he didn’t take interest in completely new topics were being covered, topics he had never read about before or even thought about. He was more nervous from time to time now, he tried to keep it under control as best as he could but sometimes he just couldn’t, luckily the most stressful moments were when he was alone, when there was no one to watch him and he was left to himself to feel pathetic. He knew he couldn’t handle it, it wasn’t his fault and he knew that, he couldn’t really have avoided the crash or anything alike yet it didn’t help him feel any less bad.
