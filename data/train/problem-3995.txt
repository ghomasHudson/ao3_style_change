“I’m afraid, I’m afraid of what was happening to me near the Edge, I saw your grave, those things that cowered over me, I was so fucking afraid and somehow my body knew that, it couldn’t fathom that change. It could feel something that I couldn’t, something hidden, something that connects me to all of this and those monsters, I know it.”
"These recent events have been... interesting. B-but you see, I think I would prefer not remembering any of the things that had happened between us, in our previous endeavors. Please try to understand, living on earth is complicated as it seems, I'm not quite normal yet. And- well- I want to be normal. I don't want my past mistakes to haunt me anymore, I don't want to cry myself to sleep every night thinking that I don't belong anymore..."
“No Sam. I mean what I say. I don’t miss him. Frankly speaking? I’m really pissed at him- I feel nothing but anger towards the guy. Not only did he actually pull off his stupid fucking plan the second time but he made me think that….”
“I love you” he hears him say as he buries himself in his lips once more, a fleeting kiss just erasing itself the moment it reached him. He feels the end within his grasp, he needs more time…he just needs
“Well what I’m saying is fact because after the Collapse the whole weather system got shitty, the sun disappeared and the clouds never changed, they always remained the same” Dean rambled and Castiel still occupied himself with his belongings and ‘just in case’ items.
A few minutes had passed while they kept cutting in silence and before Castiel could react the sound of gunfire invaded his ears, the giant animal screamed from fear and jolted carelessly by the sound, Dean blocked himself as he backed away but even so the animal kept jumping and started shoving the air with it's antlers blindly. Castiel withdrew and saw the animal create a ruckus and set itself free from the tangled up net, he sees Dean's slightly dazed state and the lack of emotion from him-why wasn’t  he reacting correctly?
I hear the sound of his boots beside me, him calling out to me and Sam as his arms point forward, his green eyes blazing in the faded darkness. The sun never really left the specks of his eyes did it? Even with all of his tainted and broken glory he was still him, still Dean Winchester. The only form of permanence I wanted but we all know it wasn’t meant to be-
“I’m fine Sam, I’m able, okay? So stop asking questions already and lets move!” He pokes you harshly on your chest as he groans with every step he takes forward- you step in front of him and start pointing the flashlight around the room, a dusty grimace falling upon your lips. The undamaged part of the room had surgical equipment all laid about- ancient ones at that. An EEG monitor and an ECT machine placed aside a bed that hadn’t been used for quite some time- at first you’d think this was just a usual room used for therapy, but what lay behind the normalcy is what caught the brothers eyes. Painted pentagram symbols were all spread and altered upon the massive wall, some devils traps and some symbols that seemed vaguely familiar to you- something that you’ve definitely researched about. “These look enochian and this…this might be latin” Dean ponders over them as he touches the wall reluctantly, trying to find some more symbols he could recognize “Dean, look at this…right here” you follow your brother to the wall and see a more relatively darker and larger thing written- something carved more than once.
“He came to me, asked me to accompany you- but I didn’t go. And he got killed, in one way or another it was by my hands- yet again”
They share an unsettling look shrouded with hope, they timidly kneel over the map where the pendulum has directed them.
Something happened back there- escaping it seemed impossible, they were outnumbered and he heard something even in his dazed state. Something...familiar.
Sam held onto the heavy bag that swung from his massive shoulders, the sweat on his brow breaking his concentration as he watches the desolate building staring back at him.
The ground shook with his vehemence as a black glow emitted on the spot where he lay, Castiel’s head hung low and the lower he kept it the glow started to spread out further and further- he felt too nauseated by himself, by his hands, his face, his damned body- everything.
Dean doesn’t hesitate to walk ahead of Sam even with the decrepit state the hall was continuously in, he knew he wanted to get as close to Castiel as he could but the strange power that lurked in the air made him waver a lot more than usual, he turns to Sam and signals him to walk with him, the heaviness in his eyes returning.
Even with your calm demeanor you quiver at the sight. Sam’s wide eyes were plastered but his tone remained firm “Come on” he breathed and pulls on your sleeve.
The city looked like any typical metropolis would, but the only difference was that the buildings could collapse at any given moment; and what’s even worse? You were unaware of the life that still may exist in them. The air was dense and somewhat too serene for their lungs and the shadows created by the broken skyscrapers were not pleasing to watch, Dean felt an unsettling vibration in his chest and he could feel himself perspire “So, uh… can you tell me exactly what kind of things I should be looking out for?” Dean asked discreetly without any sense of fear in his voice.
“Almost all night” Crowley steals the ladle from Dean’s hand and pours himself some stew- Dean glares at him with zealous rage until he handed the ladle back
Crowley paused, a strange expression swimming in his eyes. He rubbed his soles on the floor and bites his lip. He scratches his beard from the irritation that swelled within. “What business is it of yours to know where I bloody got it from you.. You…?”
“I did but the family died long before any of this happened. It was just me and Sammy for as long as I can remember” Dean paused and noticed that Castiel was listening intently; his wide blue eyes were radiating and glistening by the light that escaped the lantern’s glass “Strangely enough Sam and I were hunters before this and coincidently we hunted all of these things before, werewolves, ghouls, vampires, the whole shindig” Dean blinked and held in a small smile as he looked at Castiel again.
The man, Toby was his name; Sam recollected, was eyeing it very closely and cautiously. He scoffs, the disbelief in his eyes apparent and excruciatingly annoying. He was getting on his nerves but he swallows his price as he places his bag and stands behind Dean, mentally preparing himself for Toby’s loud voice to reappear.
I-I don't kno-" he murmured; I took a step closer towards him, His head was lowered and he refused to lift it up. I bent down in order to meet his startling gaze, I looked at him with hopeful eyes and begged.
He pulls his thumb out from Castiel's grasp and pushes onto his thumb instead. "One, two, three!" He smirks as he applies some pressure.
Dean takes another bite and listens intently; awaiting an answer he’d most probably be disappointed with
Dean extends his bandaged hand towards the worn out stereo and rotates the dial back and forth. The instant emergence of static flooded Castiel's ears and he came running back to reality in a flash. Startled, he straightens himself and places his head on the torn headrest.
“Dean?” Cas speaks through his tender kisses and lets Dean wander over his neck solemnly-he senses the eerie thoughts that force him back into his shell, the same Dean that always chose to hide rather than let himself be seen, especially this way “Dean?” Castiel is a lot more firm as he calls out to him. He places his hand on Dean’s nape and starts caressing it with his thumb. Dean’s body is tense above him and he wanted nothing more than to ease the tension hovering around them “What are you thinking about?”
The streams hum their gentle tune as the wind disperses particles of dust and ash- the stones lay buried and neat within it- a few swarms of grey fish swim peacefully within those rocks and algae and the water only welcomes their movement- even in this grey there was gentility- or maybe something even more malevolent lied beneath?
Dean looks up at Bobby and nods with a musing pout on his face- Bobby looks at Sam and just chuckles exasperatedly- it somehow felt like old times again, even if were for a moment.
“Wow-thanks for choosing a cat over me” Dean jokes but there is a sting in his tone-he didn’t want to sound petty but he couldn’t help but be a little jealous. He clutches onto the doorknob and watches something dash in front of him, the next moment he turned around  he sees a white gremlin taking over his bed and taking Cas’ full devoted attention. He’s erratic and needy with his cuddles and Cas is giving him all of it willingly with a tint in his cheeks.
He grits his teeth and pushes his fists to the ground as he falls, this resentment he felt was so overbearing, so difficult to ignore- he couldn’t help but feel only that.
Why couldn't he remember as well? What was he like before the Collapse? Did he like music? Did he have a good job? A family? Friends perhaps? None of it made any sense.
“Cas?” he whispers as he places his hand on your right shoulder. You blink even more, stunned by the colors you saw in the palm of your hand and how it twisted around your fingers.
“Oh! Well if it isn’t the young Winchester! Put her there!” Toby guffawed as he took Sam’s hand and tugged on it.
“How long?” Castiel stands up and tries meeting his gaze but Dean’s head keeps shaking from the thoughts stirring in his head-thoughts that Castiel was afraid to address at the moment.
“You’ve clearly lost it if you think I’m doing a better job at this than you” Castiel laughs and feels buried in his green eyes, as flirtatious and calm as he had remembered them even if it hid something much deeper inside. But he wouldn’t be Dean if he wasn’t complicated now would he?
Minutes passed and we couldn't leave each other; our hearts were merging and melting into one another. Dean Winchester was mine.
“I sense a presence near the western side of this establishment- they seem to be roaming about” Castiel squints as he turns his head to and fro- like a hound dog caught on a scent “Maybe this will be in our favor”
“You know what? Yes. I’ll take you up on that offer” I slip away from the fence and sit in the carrier full of hay bales and wooden cargo-I was too distracted to even notice the old man’s retaliation at my behavior “Uh, you were supposed to sit in the front with me but…whatever suits you I suppose”
He was wearing his brown leather jacket, he hadn't worn that for so many years. It was a memoir of his father, and it made me feel even weaker inside knowing that some things never change, he still held onto it after so much, it made me feel guilty because I had hurt him not so long ago.
“You said you found this truck from a vamp den right? This truck was stolen from us before they got their hands on it- so all I have to do is use a tracking spell and we’ll be able to manage it from there somehow”
My hands fumble in my pockets and I manage to procure a wallet, an FBI badge, the small poetry book from long ago and my cellphone-I choose to discard some of the items and throw them to the side. I feel sick as I throw them away and deliberate whether I should turn back…
“Hey-hey- I’m here, we’re both here-okay? And I know you’re scared and I…I wish I could say something that could make it better but Cas? Cas? I…I’m scared too” He pulls away but still lays on top of him as he works through his thoughts “We can never know, okay? We can never know what waits for us ahead-okay? But
“Something is definitely off, if only I could see better!” he exasperated, the irritation in his voice was infectious and you felt more agitated the longer he murmured. He pulls out a red flare fro his bag and in one swift move he tears the top open and it sizzles to life.
“Wow, no one has actually taken me this seriously to this point. I’m actually quite flattered that you stayed this long” Crowley mused as he flashes his teeth at him; Sam rolled his eyes and decided to be patient with the guy.
His blue eyes showed how sleep deprived he was, not only that but his whole appearance did; his grey shirt was ruffled and messy, the jeans he wore were too loose on his fragile body, and His trench coat needed to be washed badly. But even with his tardiness, he still managed to look so good.
"It's just a gut feeling I suppose...but Dean always told me to trust my instinct and what I'm feeling right now is fear. So please... I just can't give up on him. Not again". Crowley watches his heaving form on the floor of his once peaceful abode, he feels the clock mocking him from behind, why is he hesitating so much?
“-I kind of want to know, what is going on in that hollow head of yours? You seem a little on edge, more so than usual” Crowley sits down beside him, his breath smelling of cigars
"Cas did you find something?" Dean raises an eyebrow after he watches the build up on Cas' face. Castiel nods approvingly and dug his nails with fervor, he scratches his hand as he pulls it out but it didn't bother him.
of an act it was, to just erase everything and bring you and Sam back-completely tampered with and nowhere to go but…somewhere far from me”
“We need to move! We’ll be of no use to them if we’re dead!” You crawl at first but steady yourself enough to pull Castiel back, his body so stiff even with all the shaking “We need to move, NOW!” you pull on him harder and the both of you start running towards the double doors at the end of the crumbling hall. Castiel is still hesitant with his movements but he manages to keep up with you, his dusty trench coat flaying in the wind. You push the door in unison and continue running forward until the floor beneath you felt stable again, but where that place lays was the question. You enter a wide room with a white staircase in the middle of the room and multiple doors to go through, but all of them were covered with a strange black texture- like little roots twisting around. The both of you stand back to back trying to find a way to get out- but even the windows were clouded by the same substance.
Sam hears a meow in the message and he pouts out of confusion “Was that a…cat? What the hell are you doing Dean?” Sam laughs a bit and gets a little impatient by the thought. Sam feels flushed but he forces himself to open his laptop again and starts looking through the internet-no matter how many refreshes it took. Luckily he only had to do it once to find something that irked his interest. There was somewhat of an article posted just a few minutes ago, it was more a blog post that focused on local conspiracies and incidents. Not the best source but he’s got nothing to lose. Something about an incident near a bus station-he clicked on it and let his eyes cross over the words quickly.
“Fine, whatever. Don’t want to complain like an old man again” Dean gives up and continues taking his boots and socks off. He pulls the ends of his jeans upwards and keeps rolling them until half of his leg is exposed. Sam laughs inside the car and starts’ fiddling with the ancient dial, static begins to erupt in his space until he finds a frequency that was playing something with a gentle guitar strumming.
“It may not but at least I won’t be in the dark about it! Dean everything we’ve been through in the past…I know how
" I was a fool. I failed to believe in your ridiculous story, I failed to understand you. I- I never thought I'd be able to understand who I was. I never knew who I was until you showed up, right into my class. I craved for knowledge, I wanted the truth, I wanted to know." He babbled on, I listened to his words intently. He sat down in front of me in slow motion, as if I was going to be startled by his movements. "I still don't believe half of the things you've said, but somehow I know they're true. There is this constant pull on my heart when it comes to you Dean, what I'm feeling right now, I cant fully grasp it yet.. I don't even feel bad forgetting everything else, forgetting my whole existence and purpose. But the fact that I forgot you" he claimed, the sadness clearly written on his face "My grace? My mission? My memories with you? Why are they all gone? Why did I forget everything? Why did I forget you? Why was I given a chance to live? Why am I human? And if we were separated then, then why are we meeting now? After all this time?, just..why?". Cas was unable to say anything more, he wanted so many answers, but I wasn't able to help him.
He remembered how much Dean loved his grenade launcher, it was a pity that he was never able to use it before any of this happened. Sam felt his stomach turn at the memory, how much his brother’s playfulness kept him going for so long and how so much had changed inside him because of it. He bit the tip of his tongue and spoke briskly.
“DEEEEAAAANNNN!” He screams louder, his lungs shriveling up from the sensation as he did, the ground felt flatter underneath him and he starts to run again, his pants fogging up the air around his head. He tries again with his cupped mouth “DEEEAANN?”
Dean pouts as he keeps his brother on speaker and places his phone on the dash board, trying to dry out the wetness in his locks and his clothes “How many times do I gotta tell ya? I went out for a drive”
"We need to move. NOW" Dean pulls him up and didn't even bother asking if he was okay "You go start up the truck somehow, I'll push it, hopefully the piece of shit might be a miracle for us" he furrows his brows and pushes Castiel hastily, Cas runs sluggishly at first but he picks up the pace a few steps later. Dean steps forward to join him but something makes him stop.
“Err, um. I don’t know what came over me. I apologize” Castiel mumbles as he calls the cat and picks him up gently, their fluffy stomach soft in his hand. “Dude! Don’t be like that…I thought that was really…” Dean scratches the back of his head as his eyes flutter -was Dean…shy? Castiel laughs at his gestures and walks towards him slowly and kisses him gently, Dean pulls him in instantly and holds him from his neck and his back-it wasn’t until the cat mewled out of discomfort between them that they managed to stop.
“Dean?” Castiel knocks on his door and takes a peek inside, his head is still slightly wet as he scratches it awkwardly as his eyes wander inside an empty bedroom. He hears Dean’s humming in the shower and the never ending steam flowing out from the door. Castiel smiles at the sound and laughs quietly, he seemed happy-he hadn’t seen him be that way in a long time.
He clasps his hands together and buries his nose between his elbows. His breathing warmed his face the more he buried his face in- his knees felt warmer by the puffs. He wanted to suffocate himself the deeper his breaths got but somehow he fought against that thought too.
Anger swells inside your throat as you exchange glances from the shadow and Sam and Dean's immobile bodies.
He mouths his name but hears no voice come out, only the ringing in his ears remained even in Sam’s arms-he wants to
He holds him delicately, his eyes a few shades darker the more he pours himself out to the man barely holding himself together, it all felt so nostalgic, just grabbing the pieces that continued to fall from his eyes.
“They’re not us. I get what you mean” Dean sighs at his comment and brings the car to a slow stop “But it’s nice to know that there are people out there who can handle things for us when we’re not around”
“The Winchester boys! You still aren’t dead I see! Ha-ha!” He bounced as he shook Sam and Dean’s hands. Sam always cringed internally whenever this man spoke and held back the urge to repeat his question. Dean smiled his fake yet believable smile and chuckled at the bouncy man’s greeting “Glad that we’re still in business eh?” Dean joked and the man erupted with laughter, once he was done with his usual fill he started to eye the bags that they had brought. Dean places his on the worn out table and shows the collectibles, the zipper only allowing him to peek through.
“Yes?” you blink in an unsettling way as you look at the both  of them sitting in the truck’s carrier “Oh, sorry Sam- here” you pull on the strap and hand over the dusty green bag to him with a comfortable look in your eyes. Sam smiles back but looks at Dean for affirmation, or something else really- the Winchester telepathy was a fascinating thing to encounter but this time it felt like he was telling him to do something, something Dean was hesitant about.
"Cas, we need to fucking leave... Whoever this grave belongs to has to wait a little longer okay? So let's go before anything-" Dean slaps his elbow gently and and gazes into his rooted murky eyes and felt his jaded body wane. His touch pulls him out but he still looks scared-those heavenly ridden eyes bearing a feeling so strange
“We have to start some place, this can’t be it right? Maybe the old slice and dice will do the trick?”
“Dean?” You call out with a cough and a bleeding nose- but nothing too serious “Dean!” you wail again in a gruff tone- hoping your feet don’t give up on you until you hear something.
“That’s one side of the story Sammy, I mean we’ve done enough cases to know that these places never really do just one thing…”
So tangled up in one another, as if puzzle pieces and bones merging without realizing it. To be drawn to one another even if every instinct tells them otherwise, so viciously these faithless beings consume each other even if they bleed each other dry. To feel erased, to live in a repressed memory- they know nothing else but that. Always finding each other in the corpses they leave behind.
To Cas’ dismay Dean pulls away and gets off the bed slowly, Castiel knew he was teasing him with the way his hands grazed his thighs and his sensual eyes-it was driving him insane how well he could read his gestures now-a decade or so back he never would’ve understood these motions and it made him wonder-how long had Dean been trying to tell him?
“…What?” Dean raises his eyebrows as he watches Castiel’s playful eyes, the sorrow fading from them completely.
“Cas? What the actual fuck is going on? I’m yelling at you and you refuse to respond” Dean’s grip lessens around him even though he wanted his anger to linger for a little while longer, maybe he was tired too?
Crowley snickers quietly on the side, this encounter had amused someone else too at least “The bloody balls on this guy! Hahaha! I take everything back, I like this new version of him”
“Where is here? Is this place not Earth?” Sam’s shielded worry glistens in his gentle eyes and Dean wants nothing more but to end this quickly-he had a hunch that they won’t be left alone with this thing for long
“I just don’t want it to be taken away. That’s all I want…I don’t want you to-” Castiel closes his eyes shut and rubs the back of his head on the cold ground-Dean pulls him into an embrace and buries his nose into his shoulder. He felt heavy on him but Castiel still pulled him in, hoping he’d get a good look at what felt wrong on the inside-the fallible vessel that became inhabitable the more he breathed.
“Come on Carl enough with all of that shit…There are litetal monsters out there so there's no shame in finding some way to protect yourself”
Its moldy neck rotates in the opposite direction, the red glow dimming from its sockets and its porcelain face cracking upon the broken floor- it begins to atomize and the black grains pour over the remnants, like fine sand slipping through ones fingers.
You thought it would seem a lot less intimidating when you got closer- but it made you feel a lot more frozen in your own skin. You look at the massive building that stretched upwards towards the cloudless sky- none of you could see the top of it from where you stood and it was freaking you the hell out. An old red clay like texture surrounded the walls of the place with white windowsills stretching out for miles and miles- this gargantuan of a hospital still stood firm in its place- regardless of it being abandoned for 6 years.
“How long was I-? When did the sun set?” You look at the back of Sam’s head and see the paleness spread from his nape; his breathing stopped as he looked at the pitch black windows, his breath as cold as ice.
He feels him sob against his shoulder and Dean pulls him away gently to look at him, their heads lay on his pillow but they were comfortable even in the lack of it. Dean rubs away Cas’ tear and continues the motion even when it was gone, he felt that it soothed him somehow “Talk to me. Don’t keep me in the dark”
Dean bursts out laughing, leaving the other man awestruck and terrified at the sight, he even considered jumping out of the truck. Dean regains his composure and licks his lips with a shake of his head until he speaks again cheerfully.
Sam drags the bag away and calls on Crowley as he treads away from them; but Dean stays behind for some reason, his hand in his pocket and his stance tall above him. “Are you not coming? Don’t you want to eat?”
I lowered my head and just stared at the marble sink, I supported myself by placing both of my hands on the cold material, my eyes refused to blink.
“Don’t you ever get tired of screwing with everyone’s heads? I sit with you for a few minutes and I already feel my head spinning”
My SPN babies, I'm so sorry for the painful ending that we all DID NOT DESERVE, THAT THE CHARACTERS DID NOT DESERVE. Its been a horrible 2 weeks, now months of pain awaits. I'M SO SORRY FOR THIS FANFIC TOO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FINISHED IT YET. I PLAN TO DO IT I SWEAR, Because after the trauma i think we all need a group hug from each other during this trying time, whatever the writers did I'll try to rewrite it, maybe even express myself a little bit through my children- maybe even give them the ending they deserve.
Dean clicks his mouth “Eh, you’re fine. You can last through this one pretty easily, and remember; we are going to go out for some grub soon after so I don’t want any bailing, Sam disappointed me already” You smile weakly but whole heartedly, the strange aftertaste in your mouth subsided and you hasten towards the staircase.
“Okay Cas, lead the way” you smack your lips as you turn towards him- his eyes instantly looking away the moment you did- Sam and Crowley huddle close to both of you and kept puffing cold smokes as they spoke “Is this really it? How many could be in there Cas?” Sam speaks slowly as he slides the blades and pistols into his belt and jacket.
“I- I wanted this for so long without even realizing it- I wanted to give my life for you, I wanted you to forget because it was the best thing I could give to you, the same way you gave me my humanity. There was no other way I could’ve saved you or myself, I was already dead until my grace- and its essence…”
I turn and stare at the birds circling in the lavender and peach sky, their sounds hurried and dramatic in the dusk. I see clouds again and a blurry sun rising in the west behind the colored mountain peaks, but the darkness still lingers. Darkness I can’t seem to get enough of frankly. I see the torn up building from before, the space you entered 6 years ago. It’s almost pristine even in its dilapidated and displaced state, a piece of art being swallowed by the moss growing in its fissures. There are no more veins circling the interior but small light blue flowers bloom from the cracks and broken shards of glass from the windows. They’re lifeless upon the ground and somehow break away from the specks of light and dust hovering over my head, its meaningless really-all of this.
. He watches the dim glittering sky as the clouds dance in his eyes- he hears nothing in the wind other than the slow flowing water hitting the rocky river floor- it tends to stretch out from here- he wondered if this would lead towards a beach but for some reason he protested the idea and refused to go on further, no matter how much he really wanted to.
Dean closes his eyes from the agitation burning at his throat and gives out a large sigh, but surprisingly he answered much quickly than he had assumed.
of this. The apocalypse, The Collapse and everything in between-our lives would’ve been easier to waste away than watch it become…”
They were peering over a small town, most of the buildings were blown over- bricks dismantled and pouring over on the dirt- a reckless mess with people scattered about all grey from the dust and gunpowder Sam assumed. Dirty tents were laid about where many were storing their belongings; some even had trucks stuffed underneath them. Where were they getting all of these things?
“I’m kind of freaking out, if you don’t mind” Castiel whispered as he looked left and right constantly as his paranoia took over. Dean’s wide eyes softened at the sight- something that's almost too familiar to him. He strangely felt...stronger now, knowing that he wasn’t alone in this. Their shared fear of the unknown was slowly fading away and Dean amused himself with Castiel’s fear struck eyes.
Castiel looks away for a few seconds when he asked that- you take a mental note of his gesture and make eye contact with Sam through the rearview mirror- as expected he was looking back wearing the same expression of worry in his eyes.
He opens the door to a secluded hall- the white windowsills and walls stretching out towards the very end of it all. There were tags over the myriad of doors that lurked here- many of them room numbers and several of them ranging from ‘records’ to ‘storage’. Either way the hall seemed as though it stretched on for a millennia “Heh- so much for getting lost” you mumble under your breath with your neck stretched out and looking into the hall with dread. Sam pushes through the both of you and wanders the hall unfazed with his hand on his pistol-readying himself for the task at hand. “I sense them forward- through the doors at the end” Castiel shoves you gently and steps beside Sam- he nods at him and Sam does too as they slowly move forward while you and Crowley linger back but still remain pretty close to them.
“Weren’t you a cross roads demon? Why would you even be there?” Dean comments back with a genuine question.
“Cas, we have to keep moving- we can’t stay out here in the open and let ourselves be known- the spirit already-” Sam grabs Castiel by his shoulders roughly, his tone fast and raggedy as he spoke to him. As if like clockwork, the moment Sam spoke his last word and loosened his grip on Cas the building started to shake the same way it did before- the cracks started to emerge from every corner of the wall and none of you could find the strength to stand- something was crawling through the cracks- something dark and alive.
"Mmfff" Castiel groans with twitchy lips, he was somewhat awake but not fully capable of standing up on his two feet. Dean took it as his cue to get up and rummages through their items, salt rounds, shotguns, silver bullet pistols, revolvers, blades engraved with runic symbols, blades covered by various kinds of poison...
“So is it true what you saw Hailey?” A young tanned boy spoke to one of the newly converts in the group, she was grabbing the ends of her shirt and she was shivering in place.
“Alright, I’ll put them in the wash for you so pick out whatever from my closet, okay?”  Dean carries Castiel’s bag from the table in the war room and directs himself to the laundry room.
“DEAN!” He shrieked as he fell out of his sleeping bag and walked around without his shoes, his feet absorbed all the grime and mud the longer he walked by the river, but he didn't let it gaze him. He turns and lets his eyes wander over the small camp, there are the usual recognizable items scattered about and several he didn't- was that a machete?
“No more goodbyes, I’m sick of it…just…just stay? That’s all I want now, all I ever need from now on. So just…” Dean clutches onto him, a clingy hopelessness seeping from his hands as it touches Castiel’s frigid back. He struggles holding his body as he shakes his head, the green pools only filled with grief and anguish as his hands kept slipping-as Castiel felt lighter in his heavy heart.
"Alright Cas we need to start walking from here okay? I can't carry you like a lost puppy here, do you understand? Come on" Although his arm was around Dean's shoulder he starts walking without his support. He feels a little crushed by the cold gesture but he didn't have time to deal with it. They shuffle aimlessly towards the unknown. The trees dissipate from this point, the more barren the earth felt the more everything around them began to disappear.
"Cas" I breathed. I needed him here, I needed Cas. He looked at me with teary eyes, not even flinching by my hoarse voice.
A pang of guilt starts to bubble inside of them simultaneously-for a moment the light in the clouds felt a little dimmer in their eyes “I’ve fucked up everything I’ve cared for, everything I’ve loved! Nothing stays long with someone like me…nothing ever lasts but I still…try, Cas. I’ll keep trying until I finally find some way to break the cycle…I mean…” he falters as he runs his hand through his hair, biting his lip as he tries to breathe “I have not been a good man…I’ve tried
The floor is covered in soot, completely spread out and depraved of any other color than that; the walls had strange cracks and black spots upon them in abrupt patterns, almost like blotches of paint spread about. All of the windows lay shattered on the floor, the dim moonlight creating a shadowy archway in the room. You watch the trembling man sit in the middle of it all- his breathing jagged and slow with the blackness seeping from his entire being. You run towards him without thinking twice- what was wrong with you?
“I never meant it…any of the horrible things I said to you before that day and after…I never meant any of it Cas… I was just being…
"Aaw come on now don't do that" says Dean as he comforts me; I could feel that he was shaking a bit, but he was doing a good job at hiding it.
He doesn’t wait for her response as he dashes through with every thought erased from his mind-the overemotional fool that he was. He fumbles with his speed a bit because of the grass and dirt’s texture, it thickened the more he ran towards the cat’s direction “DEAN!” he yells as his head twists and turns, breaking away any of the stiffness that existed before “DEEEEAN!” he yells again as he walked in deeper into a clearing, he was nowhere to be seen and the panic was slowly consuming him.
“You son of a- I told you how important it was for me to find that monster! You knew how much my life was at risk and you still lied about it!” the boy bit his quivering lips as he hid his eyes in his shaky hands, Sam could hear his tiny sobs as he fell to the ground and Crowley stood in front of him completely unfazed, annoyed by his reaction.
The girl began to nod in a haphazard fashion “Yes! Yes! I saw it…. I heard the whistling in my ear! I know! - pl- please…” she rambled continuously, Luther dropped her to the ground and wrapped his hands on the back of his head; Luther grunted aggressively and kicked a relatively large rock from the ground as his eyes bulged out from his skull. The group began murmuring, the horror and concern clearly written on their faces, Dean was distracted by the sudden rise in tension within the group but he continued to search for paths along the other side. Dean ended up discovering a pick up truck on the other side, just a few trees down. He focused on the tent nearby and located Castiel’s backpack lying on one of the plastic tables inside. Dean knew he found a way out but he still needed to find the keys to the truck, he was suddenly worn out by thinking so much at once and the smell of vamp blood didn't make it any easier for him.
You flail your arms about, as much as your burnt body and trench coat allowed you to; you couldn’t fathom anything, couldn’t process anything. Sam wasn’t breathing. Dean wasn’t breathing. So bloody and tuckered-so laid about like a red silk ribbon in a tree branch, so broken, the brothers lay- the brothers lay- the brothers lay – All is now grey- All is now grey- All is now grey-
“Guys open the door! It’s us!” It was Sam’s voice this time that pounded on the door, you flinched at the booming sounds echoing around you but you don’t move a muscle, Castiel was still enough to keep anyone on edge, his breathing rhythmic and slow, just the cold puffs indicating that he’s even remotely alive. “Come on fellas! You’re gonna open this up or not!?” Dean bellows again, this time it felt like two hands were banging on the door, a strange cracking emerging from the wood as they did. We take a step back, the both of us clutching on our blades as we readied ourselves for impact- what good will these pitiful weapons do now?! You turn to Castiel with your plastered grimace and pulsating stare but stifle your comment instantly; you see his eyes glow in the darkness with a strange dark blue static simmering on and off, this isn’t what angel grace looked like-it felt like something much,
“So you do know about them. If I was the monster you spoke of then you wouldn’t be standing here talking to me now would you?”
“Yeah-but I still thought you were hot as hell so it didn’t even bother me that much. That and your usual disobedience-you really knew what got to me”
The shadow pattern on the ground was different from before. Was that always there? Even with the noise and the quaking floor beneath him he couldn't help but look at the figure, it wasn't like the others. This was excessively different, and so...
“Dean wasn’t that place used to treat patients with tuberculosis? Then it wouldn’t really count as a mental asylum, right?”
“Castiel!” He bellows into the void, he watches his eyes be enveloped by it too- his outstretched hand couldn’t reach him, no matter how much he tried
Strangely, Sam knew his answer and he felt his remorse all over again, but he was too scared to admit it.
“How long has it been since then?” Dean asked, concerned over the possibility if they were safe or not. Castiel could sense the uncertain fear in Dean’s voice but he replied warmly “It has been four hours since then, and we made it here before it got dark. The gun shots faded out after our moose incident, it didn’t happen again after that” Castiel took a taste from the pot and he slurped wittily with the silliest grin on his face. He hummed happily and turned the gas off “Dean, don’t hover in this tiny space and please go lie down.” Dean’s lips outlined a strange expression, like a child forced to go to bed early; Castiel smirked at the thought of Dean exhibiting child like behavior and a sudden lightness began to spread in his mind. Castiel rummaged through his backpack and took out one of the ‘just in case’ items he had prepared.
“Shut up and take the dang thing” he smiles and shoves it into Castiel’s shaky hands “You’ve done so much around here…this is the least I can do. I’m due for an upgrade anyways. It just needs batteries and good frequency so nothing too complex”
He looks up, a face of enmity and sorrow that hesitantly manages to open its eyes and look forward- a gaping consternation that continues to grow the longer he stares.
But when Dean finished and started to speak again his tone took a more forceful approach “I know you might want something in return, but I don’t have shit to give you, all I’m saying is that I’m willing to do anything as long as you agree to help me- if his deal is still on the table I still might consider it”
Dean positioned himself on the ground and gave Castiel a nod of his head along with a small “come on”. Castiel power walked towards him and steadily placed his foot in his hands, the next moment he realized he was reaching out towards the van’s roof and his moment of flight had soon faded away. He crawled onto the top of the car and breathed a sigh of relief, even though the amount of energy he used was close to a minimum.
Dean pulls himself closer as he pulls Cas in from his waist, their faces only inches away on the pillow that made their heads sunk in. Plant kept singing in their ears but Dean made sure he mouthed the next thing clearly.
Castiel teleported behind the stranger- who was readying a Molotov before they jolted from his sudden appearance, dropping the non-lit glass bottle to the ground- the shards spreading further and further away from them. Screaming, the child slashes a hidden knife at his legs but misses, Castiel found this as an opening to slap the knife out of their hand and grabs onto their wrists- no amount of their struggling and leg kicking was able to free them, he never realized how much strength he possessed- but it wasn’t really fair seeing how it was a child that he managed to tackle.
Sam hums an agreeable response and watches Dean turn the ignition off “ Let the relaxing begin” he grunts as he opens the door and steps out, Sam steps out a little slowly in comparison  to take in the view, his lungs feel cleansed by the air he breathes in.
I hope it's getting interesting from this part! The next chapter will also be a Sam centric one (Yayyyy) so I hope it isn't too boring for any of you! And I'll be ending the first part of this series soon and I hope hope hoooope all of you like it, and love it (Dear God please let them love it!)
“Dean? DEAN?” He starts to shout-he didn’t know why he felt the need to do that but…what was one supposed to do in a situation like this? “DEAN! COME BACK!” He pulls on the fence roughly as his eyes wander to and fro, trying to find an entrance from here. He felt feverish, angry and sore all over-what the hell was happening?
“Seriously, how have you managed to get this far?” She chuckles as she throws her cigarette away and stomps it on the ground “Tell ya what, there’s this community center not far from here-me and the gang have been staying there for a while now and I bet there’s room for one more-well, technically two” she winks at the little head poking out from his trench coat “Seems to me you haven’t really been stopping to rest, looking weak and all-no offense”
Dean looks at him with a stare that sent chills down his spine, the green pools paralyze him completely “It’s just a hunch, and I’m not giving up unless I follow that hunch”
Dean looked at him peculiarly, Castiel could see that he knew something wasn’t right with the way Castiel spoke and strangely enough Castiel knew what he was thinking up in his head “I wanna know what you know. Because according to Balthazar you might be the only one who went there and came back alive” Dean spoke as he moved in a little closer.
They stare at each other a little while longer- a massive rift between them just slowly consuming the air around them.
“Unh…” Castiel moaned quietly as he tried turn his body in another direction, Dean instantly responded to his movement and he brought his face closer to his “Hey, Hey Cas? It’s me. We’re gonna get out of this place okay?” Dean hushed, relieved by the fact that he wasn’t alone. Castiel still didn’t respond and he just continued breathing with his eyes closed “You have to take me to Sammy okay? I won’t let you die on me” Dean gently caressed his face and felt his pulse on his non scarred neck. It felt slower than normal and Dean hoped that he would make it through a few more hours. While the guard moved towards the other direction for his usual round Dean tried to support Castiel by placing his hand on his back. While he was doing that he got distracted by a solid object underneath his jacket, after looking around making sure no one was watching him Dean traced his hand on Castiel’s back until he found the object inside. It was the blade he used when they were in the city.
“Crowley for once I want this to stick. I don’t think I have the energy to get involved in their lives any further-can’t you just…” Castiel grits his teeth as he struggles speaking through months of concealment.
“Rewritten how?” Castiel speaks in his monotone voice, it took Dean a while to get used to his robotic voice again, he smiles internally from the memory-but maybe its best he doesn’t think of it now.
“Are you kidding me? What the hell is this-Dr. Phil?” he crosses his arms defensively but his eyes reflected a different emotion altogether “Why are you acting like nothing bothers you? Why…why do you seem so…unaffected?” Dean stutters as he steps back, maybe even considers leaving him here but something makes him stay, something unknown.
Dean stabs the man through his throat and allows the blade to protrude out the other side. The vampire is gagging and vomiting out heaps of his own blood as his pupils dilate improperly, Dean knows he’s not done for yet so he grabs the other end of the blade and drags it over the rest of his throat. He could see the separated trachea touch his fingers as the blood came gushing out of him. The guard continued to cough as he filled Dean’s arms with a shade of crimson, he remained in his tranquil state as he waited for the man to stop twitching and finally be taken out of his misery. The moment he stopped moving Dean cleaned his blade by rubbing it on the guard’s clothes and he slowly made it out of the cage; he stumbles on a few rocks and sticks until he placed himself behind a large oak tree, the burning sensation and loss of blood made him dizzy but he knew he needed to find a way out of the woods. And fast.
Castiel squints and feels the strain in their relationship the longer Dean's eyes burned into his skin. His hands reach his forehead and he starts pressing onto his dry skin. He tried to understand but he what he just couldn't remember
He came to terms with the fact that all of the heroes he once dreamed of being were all buried along with him, not even their bones existed in the rotting earth below.
“Huh, who would’ve thought that monsters could be poetic?” Dean sneers as he gets up and rubs the dirt from his jeans and worn out green flannel shirt “So we’re looking for an asylum with a big train? Is there even such a thing that-“
"Thi- this isn't re- al" he answered after pulling himself together " I knew there was something about you b- but this is insane, I can't know you. I don't know you. My dreams are just dreams, you're just a normal person who teaches me, AND NOTHING ELSE, this is all a lie!" He screamed as he struggled through his current state.
“Yeah” Sam rubs his lips together, his neck arching in an awkward angle- just the way he’s always done. He slides his pistol at the back of his jeans and turns towards Crowley, who’s already walking the other direction.
Sam and Dean stare at him in shock, it almost amused Castiel making them see him this way- in this demeanor and at his choice of words- because frankly he needed to set things straight with them and if this was the only way they understood- then so be it.
“Yeah-yeah, you know…those… Sam told me that those things are what makes life worth fighting for, you know? Even if everything seems to suck we always have those moments to hang on to-to give us strength to fight even more”
.  He looks away from you as you draw yourself closer; the others also shift their gaze between the two of you and try to catch a glimpse themselves- but at that point Castiel had already left the truck.
‘Aren’t you coming to bed?” Cas asks in an unintentionally sultry tone and it sends a jolt all over Dean’s body, in some places more than most. He turns away from him as he places his hands on his desk, the red in his cheeks spreading through to his fingertips-why was he acting like a fucking teenager? The fact that he was getting flustered was pissing him off but he still welcomed the feeling. He welcomed all of it
“I choose to do so because we don’t have time. We need to work together for now and then I can be out of your way”
Silence ensues between them, only their jagged breathing invades this room, this room of dull grey- of cottage décor and wooden furniture that melds into them perfectly- like statues in the middle of the crossroads waiting for the rain to cleanse them again.
“I know you’re lying” Castiel comments with a questioning tone, he knows oh too well about Dean’s lying habit especially when he’s not feeling like his usual self and Dean knows his ‘really?’ eyes a little too well to keep his façade going.
“All I’m saying is…just catch up with us from time to time? Maybe join us for some piss drinks as well? It wouldn’t hurt to socialize a bit honestly- we’re kind of all you got- right?”
“Me too” Dean breathes and bites his lip from Cas’ breathing, how did he keep himself away for all these years? How did he have the resilience to not jump him every moment he got before this? Dumbass Dean Winchester-that’s what.
“Listen… I… I don’t know what to really, say? I don’t really know what I’m doing here. We’re just following leads at this point. We got Crowley, so there’s something- he’s the only one who might know what happened when…”
What was that voice in his head? He's dealt with things like this before but why was this happening here? And now of all times?
“I couldn’t keep my composure so….I kinda hid my face in your shoulder” Dean procures a large wooden box and pauses as he twists and turns the padlock suspiciously “I…I was embarrassed as hell. I mean…I’m not really…out there like that, you know? Not like you at least”
up. I made everything worse by tangling with those…things-the same things that took you away from me and…I took all of them as a result to just…be strong enough to give back everything I took from you! Can’t you see Dean? Can’t you see what saving me does? It only brings…
He spits haphazardly and starts to blink, he realizes something, something different-something long lost upon his dusty tongue and within the frazzled pieces of his mind. He finally wakes and shuffles on the ground, unfortunately the nausea and pain in his body still lingered but it didn’t stop him from getting up. He feels his blood rush through his veins as he struggles to stand on his feet; until he looks up and feels his bones freeze.
Dean rolls his eyes as he catches glimpses of Castiel and Sam until he gave his full attention to the angel. He walks over to him, just inches away from his chest “You think you can see to it? I mean all things point to The Waverly Hills Sanitorium- it has your train and your river, and I bet it’s big enough for a whole army of those things”
Dean’s voice echoed through the trees and Sam was pushed out of his thoughts again, he shook his head and shoved the trinket into his pocket, slightly disgusted by its muddy exterior. He dusted off the dirt from his pants and starts running towards the source of Dean’s voice, all the while trying to calm his beating heart.
“Aah, never mind. If I don’t find your ass towards that hall in 10 minutes” He enunciates by directing his light towards a moldy and algae infected hallway “You know what’ll be coming then.”
“But…what?” Crowley raises an eyebrow as his thumb hovers over his phone screen “Don’t tell me you don’t want to go home to those idiots”
“If your ass is that hungry then eat the god damn thing you’re holding, and give me my stash too” A demanding husky voice emanates near you.
“It was a river. And yes I remember the train, I still haven’t recovered from the way you used to torture me with it” Sam clenches his jaw as the fear in his eyes bruise his stoic demeanor “But it still doesn’t – the whale in the sky?”
Sam watches him jump and grab onto the unknown source, in a way he knew what it could be but for some reason he didn’t want to say it out loud. Sam is motionless on the floor before he tries to drag himself further, he was annoyed by his tenacity but this drive is all he had left, all he could do to save these pieces of sanity.
Dean snuggles on his shoulder and positions himself comfortably, he doesn’t think he’s doing this consciously, but even looking at him this way he wanted to implode. He finally manages to find the right angle and settles down, his arms aren’t crossed but lay freely over his thighs. He has his natural cinnamon musk that’s overwhelming Castiel, how did he manage to still smell like that even now? Was he just imagining things again? He felt himself tremble as his hair tickles his cheek, Castiel melts into his presence and allows himself to place his head on top of his, making sure he didn’t wake him. He knows how defensive he gets if he’s ever caught doing something like this.
“Cas…” Dean closes his eyes and presses onto his warm shoulder-milliseconds later he’s twisting its insides all over again, maybe with a lot more force.
A vague yet heartfelt message later he adjusted his items and bags again and leaves the note on his pitiful mattress. He walked aimlessly in his room, still contemplating whether he made the right call until he decided to utilize the strange adrenaline rush by storming out, not allowing any of his thoughts to crush him further.
“I was setting the premise if you don’t mind” He watches him from the corner of his eyes- clearly offended by his interruption “So anyways after countless minutes of me walking behind him and talking my way into his brain; he finally gave in and asked for my help- directions technically. And…”
Castiel felt a surge of guilt pour through him after they said that, he decided to kneel on one knee to continue the conversation further, making sure nothing else would interrupt them.
“He’s…” Sam makes a questionable expression at Crowley’s reference but chooses to ignore it “He’s come back, yeah. Gonna go get some food for him. He’s…trying, I can see that but I know him better than that. He’s still….”
“Hmm, yeah, I suppose we do” Dean mumbles, his looks surveying the ground unconsciously- Sam notices the hesitation and uneasiness in his eyes and places his hand on Dean’s shoulder  “I’m fine Sammy; its just… how can I talk to him after everything he’s done? After he’s endangered all of us?” Dean looks in the other direction, staring at a small painting that had nothing interesting in it.
He shed his jacket and revealed his bruised arms, he gazes upon the purple swelling and cuts from their hunt from a few days ago-even now they couldn't catch a break from things trying to kill them. It hurt as he folded and placed it under his throbbing head. He shuffled to and fro in order to gain a somewhat comfortable position to lie in but even so Dean sighs at his discomfort, it felt like he created a hole by his constant shuffling and his bones began to ache the more he breathed. His eyes remained immobile for most of it; he couldn't blink nor could the stinging bother him, his frozen form was lifeless on the ground as he tried to get some sleep.
Dean stood upright and still looked at Castiel, still expecting a response. His breathing was so steady and his chest moves up and down so gracefully, the strange pentagram tattoo near his collar bone a befitting addition to his glistening skin. Castiel felt so invigorated by the sight. His abs were dim but quite prominent under the light they stood in. He shakes his legs about to get the excess water off of his skin and Castiel finds himself staring blatantly.
After looking for a while you choose to go to the right-as if walking into the sun. My legs feel better going that way too, isn’t that strange? All of this is strange, just the ability to feel everything all over again even when you wanted it not to-it was comforting to say the least, to remember.
He opens his eyes and winces by the grey that enters them, his hair tangled and frizzy from the dirt that made its home in his scalp- when did he fall? He can’t remember anything for some reason. He turns to his side at an agonizing pace and feels a painful stretch in his chest, he clutches onto the dirt to soothe himself but it only dug under his nails and made him more nauseas. He feels dried out in the even more arid air with the cold enveloping his body and sending frigid jolts in his arms.
Well? What should we do? The voice in Crowley's head enunciates with the same ounce of cynicism, his heart was burning up and his jaw felt strangely loose in his mouth; why is all of this happening? Why today? Why me?
"That's cuz I knew you would remember." He smirks, damn it he was such a liar. From my expressions he knew what i was thinking, and on that he laughed.
Dean slowly walks towards him, making sure he took him all in as he did. Castiel’s trench coat is neat and hangs perfectly on his body as it flails in the whispering wind- his shirt the palest white and his tie the darkest blue- unlike his eyes; they radiated the same crystalline shade. Castiel looks away from Dean’s hungry eyes but he doesn’t move away from him, he finds this a little frustrating because all he wanted to do was read his mind, read his thoughts and the very carnage he chose to hide from him. Dean cocks his head to the side, his lips slightly parted as he directs his head in front of Castiel’s, waiting for him to look back- the same way he used to.
Castiel buries his face under Dean’s chin as he groans awkwardly- Dean hums and kisses the top of his head and lets his kisses trail downwards until he pulls his eyes into his again, the blue a little less sullen from the tears from before.
"Dean, please forgive me" said Cas, in a brisk tone. He stood up from the sofa and started walking towards me, his legs came into my vision and I looked up, strangely this situation felt too familiar, the way he towered over me and the way i was on my knees,I couldn't quite place it. He brought his right hand to my face and wiped the tears away, I kept looking at him with awe, he was smiling slightly but I knew that his thoughts were elsewhere. His hands felt so cold against my rough skin, I took hold of his hand while he kept it on my flushed cheek, I needed to know what his hand felt like, I needed to know him.
He knew it was morning; it had been for a few hours or so. The bunker was shut off from it all but the silence within these walls held a fascinating sound, as if one could understand it from the faint sighs that hovered in the air. He muses a little more as his eyes wander over the only corner of the room he could see; he looks at Dean’s slightly messy desk with his weapons laid about and a dusty lamp atop it, the chair a haphazard mess a few feet away from it. Had it always been like that?
Cas couldn’t help but stare at him- he never meant to but I guess he did what came natural to him too.
Dean’s head banged against Castiel’s chest and he shouted “Ow!” in a comical way, Dean started rubbing his head with his free hand while the other helped him get up. He chuckled through his pain and hovered over Castiel; who rubbed his chest similarly and smiled like the hero he was. But as they laughed nervously they realized how close they were to one another, Dean continued to stare at Castiel from his position above him and he remained stiff without even flinching; Dean was breathing slowly with his mouth closed and his eyelashes bounced as he kept blinking unnecessarily, Castiel couldn’t understand what was happening but in all honesty he was actually intrigued by the strange connection the two of them shared in this moment, he was actually curious of what might happen next.
“You don’t have to prove yourself, I mean you risked your life to just save one guy, who you barely know anything about” Dean smacked his lips as he looked up and gave Castiel a warm smile.
His hand is laced into Castiel’s with a firm grip, their fingers are so etched into one another and they never realize it. He pulls him up with one hand and manages to reach him back on eye level. Dean feels the humming in his chest rise again as he does so, and he wasn’t sure that was a good thing.
Dean admits defeat- assuming that he wouldn’t stay so he turned away. That gesture hurt Castiel- he didn’t want it to but it did. Why couldn’t he just let things go for once?
Sam slides his thumb over the screen and answers with a furrowed brow “…Jody?” his eyes flicker and meet mine, I end up ignoring my own calls in the process. His eyes mellow down at the sound; you could hear Jody’s yelling from the other side “We’re…well, it’s kind of a long story. A really long one…so can you actually update us on how long you’ve been trying to contact us?”
“This isn’t necessary- I’m alright” Castiel speaks into your jacket as he manages to still hug you back slightly “The hell you are! What the fuck was that? Locking us in there and doing whatever the hell you just did right now!” you scream at him as you end the embrace and grab onto his collar, pulling him in just inches away from your face- you wanted to make sure he was listening to you right now.
“No one stopped the apocalypse, how can little old me stop how the world works now?” his eyes bulge at him even with his calm tone, it’s as if he’s being shoved in a corner and being told that whatever he does or feels- it would never amount to anything because the world wasn’t ready for it anymore; Castiel wanted nothing more than for him to leave him- but his powerlessness got the better of him.
"It just reminded me of something, your driving and all. So my mind went to Rebel without a cause for some reason..."
“You actually managed to find something? Bobby you son of a bitch you” Dean smiles as his tired eyes gloss over the pages and continues flipping them, Sam picks up the smaller note books and starts fiddling through them as well.
“Umm, hey?” Dean scratches the back of his head as his eyes wander around the room, hoping he could catch his eyes as he does so.
The throbbing disappears again and he finds the will to answer "I have very little recollection of what happened, I'm not even sure why I can't remember but you must know I did not mean for things to go that way. I'm sorry for my behavior"
“You thought of a name for the little thing? Since you’re clearly bound for life now” she calls out in the wind and the honking cars speeding besides them.
“Sammy has a way with getting lost and after the description you’ve given me I’m definitely certain that he’s headed that way” Dean concluded as he looked up at Castiel again.
He still struggles in his grasp even though he knows he can’t do anything anymore, this was something he could only feel, something he could only watch no matter how much it killed him, no matter how much his faded words echoed inside his mind now. He was too late
The other two creatures were swirling around Sam and Dean, Dean’s shaking started to subside and the blood flow slowed down- you started to stab at the monster’s hands but the blade didn’t even scrape it, your strength was depleting, just like his breaths.
Dean gets up from the stern tone Castiel had but senses that it wasn’t directed towards him. He coughs away his awkward mistake as he turns to see that he was indeed angry at Dean-a much fuzzier one. He was melting inside his box and refused to get out of it-the comfort in his eyes were a give-away. Castiel feels embarrassed by his antics and calls out to him again and this time he actually acknowledges his tone and steps out from his cozy enclosure.
"Well let me tell you Cas, Sammy and I were trying to close the gates of hell, crazy? I know. And in order to do that we were given certain tasks to complete, a whole checklist you might say. And in the process of the final task, the sky started to break..." I wandered off, just realizing how much I remembered. The sky had invaded us that day, the black and indigo contrasts filling us like we needed to be torn apart somehow. The ground shook as I slid down the impala feeling restless.
Castiel feels his hand turn him around abruptly and he peers into him with an unknown longing. Dean grabs his hand and places it upon his chest, even with his prevalent shock Castiel eases into his touch and unclenches; his palm easily rests as if it belonged there. Dean places his own hand over his, making sure they both felt every word pour out “You feel this?”
"Cas, I don't think we should be here, something is wrong with this place... All the other grave stones? They have nothing on them, no name, no date, no 'a loving douchebag'; NOTHING!" he spat, trying to convince his delusional companion through his watery eyes, he wasn't crying; but he just felt some sort of irritation inside and out. He wasn't dead, he doesn't remember anything like that
“You’re pushing me away now, Cas! Even when I’m trying to-” Dean places his hand on Castiel’s cheek, he lifts his face up and looks into those deep pools of blue that are drown him so “Please, I never meant to push anyone away...it’s just…I never wanted you to-or anyone for that matter-see me in a way that could be used against me, that could make you lose faith in me because damn it, people have lost faith in me before- even you”
I needed to leave so I just nodded and ran out of the classroom without looking back. My sneakers made irritating squeaky sounds as it made contact with the polished floor. I don't know why but I had a feeling that I was forgetting something, something important. Just a few hours ago I was craving for something new in this pathetic world, so was this my answer?. It was too stupid a thought  to even consider it a coincidence, he was just a teacher, what's so great about that?.
“Unless… It isn’t his grace. It’s something else entirely” Dean mumbles to himself, his bowl hanging loose from his fingers
There are ruffled white bedsheets with a  heavy, embroidered brown cloak on top with Sam underneath it. He lies on the bed completely immobilized, the cloak and sheets absorbing into his large stature. His hair is clean but disheveled over his slightly bruised face, nothing excessively deep.
Sam pauses and looks him up and down. He gives off a smile-small and intimate- and waves towards him weakly as he unlocks the truck- which Crowley scurried into immediately.
“You never know. Humans are known to be social animals and they can’t survive in isolation-they always want to be understood” Castiel breathes calmly and sits down on the ground only a few feet away from Dean. He crosses his legs and pats the grassy spot in front of him and gestures him to sit “And you’re a very social man-so why don’t we just sit and talk through it all?”
"You're here with me, you've come back to me . And nothing else matters, do you understand?. So if you try to leave me again I swear to God I'll hunt your ass down and kill you"
“Oh I do have a plan and it involves using angel bait, we know he’s more than capable of handling them- hell he managed to make
You laugh at the idea you concocted all those months ago-months that no longer exist now. Is this what existence is? Something as undesirable as this? Where can you even start from here, Castiel?
“Hmm” Castiel hums happily, his smile wide on his pale face “It’s been years since we met up in one of your dreams”
“To think he’s a walking time bomb, how has he not told us anything?” Crowley questions Sam with his furrowed brow and his itchy scruffy beard.
“You know, we used to confide in each other about stuff like this, not so long ago. But now it’s all secrets this and mission that- you and Sam have been yanking my chain for quite some time now. And I’ve had it- Sam may have learned his lesson but I’m still waiting on you to…” he stops and scratches his chin and nose, Castiel could sense how much he was holding himself back and he couldn’t help but look at him with his pleading eyes, he doesn’t know what he’s asking of him, but Castiel wanted it. Anything that could make him stop feeling this way “Time after time, we’ve been through hell and back- this is just the same, so level with me man- whatever you’re doing, will it take you? Do those things have some control over you or- what is going on, Cas? Because I’m sure as hell confused about all of this- about us and about…”
He’s fiddling with something inside his duffel bag, his eyes a bit heavy from the uncomfortable night from before. He stands underneath a covered bridge with rain pouring at every end in a town completely cut off from the world-an ideal place for him to be really. Wet grass, old withered benches and metal cans surround this part of town, all cleansed from the rain and erased with every drop drumming away the uncertainty that lingered. He finally finds a pair of gloves and starts to slide them on and looks towards the opening, considering whether it would be wise for him to walk in this downpour.
“I guess for the same reason the others wanted to go, to find answers” Dean blinked slowly as he wore a poignant smile on his face, Castiel could count the slight wrinkles that appeared at the corner of his eyes-how much hurt existed inside of you, Dean?
Sam's eyes were red with all of the rage and confusion building up inside, Crowley held out his hands and spat out his own thoughts "I don't know! It's just some bloody thing that I came up with! What the hell is wrong with you?!" His thick accent echoes in the living room as Sam tries to swallow the excessive bile piling up in his throat, what was happening right now?
“Well, I thought I did, but I’m not so sure anymore. Why are you asking me that?” he raises his eyebrows and looks back at you from time to time.
…” Castiel rubs his nose into Dean’s cheek and lets his forehead rub into the side of his face, it was so uncomfortable and unseemly of a position but it felt natural on the both of them.
"Don't I even get an introduction from you?" Castiel jokes with his wide blue eyes. The man slowly looked away as an embarrassed grin appears on his lips "I'm Dean Winchester, and I've been looking for my brother for over 4 months, after finally confirming his whereabouts I came to know of the place known called the 'Edge' and you might be the only person who can act as my guide" he managed to finish his sentence with his slightly dry throat. Castiel arched his back at the edge of his chair's and stared at the torn army green sheets that acted as a ceiling "So you believed everything Balthazar told you without even considering the lies he has piled up?" Dean slowly bent forward and placed his elbows on his knees, his warm breath drew in closer as he continued to speak.
You feel something erupt from within you, your stomach aches for some unknown reason and you bury your fingers into the dull yellow pages. You close the book and your eyes slowly.
P.S i wrote some poetry about the boys, I'm contemplating whether I should incorporate it in this somehow- so lets just seeeeeeeee
messy. Dean and I managed to get out alright though. Dean? Yeah he’s with me; just really rattled. We just need some time to recover from it that’s all. You want to talk to him? Okay so-
No one responded to his sarcasm, Sam kind of felt bad that he was sitting outside but he insisted on doing just that, claiming that he couldn’t bother with their drama any longer.
“Who the hell knows at this point? What I do know is that we need to catch up to him before it’s too late”
You rub your face in a harsh motion but you still drive at the same speed; you seemed to be out of sorts for some reason- it didn’t seem to be serious but it did overwhelm you the more you thought about it. But before you could process any further Castiel’s voice emanates in the air and pulls you out of it- almost knowingly.
!" He shivers as his breaths became louder than his voice. Dean was crawling on the soft sand and it got harder to stay awake, the world looked so damn disgusting in his eyes, nothing but ugly stones and confused diagrams circling his mind.
“Heh, I knew it was too good to be true” He turns while clasping his hands together, his fingers lacing each other as he does “We have to stop meeting like this” He chuckles with a flirtatious wink and grin.
Castiel looks behind Dean and sees Sam rushing towards them- his mouth agape and swollen for some reason. Dean’s eyes widen as he turns around to see the campsite, had he not realized that they had reached it already?
“I’m sorry you had to go through that, I bet you had to take care of all of our asses after that, you still got it in you old man”
“Okay, since we don’t need to introduce ourselves to you, dick. You’re gonna walk with us quietly, so you don’t need to create a scene in your so called sanctuary” Dean speaks casually, his demeanor a lot more rigid even with the playfulness in his voice, he fiddles with the chest of drawers and several other cupboards and chests in the tent before he looks him in the eyes again, but this time with a knife pointed at his throat.
“Okay so since I wasn’t awake did I miss anything in particular? Has this wise ass told you everything?”
“Someone like you? You really love talking don’t you?” Castiel rolls his eyes as he dabs his face with a brown towel- Balthazar watches him cautiously; he couldn’t tell whether he wanted something or he was actually concerned about him “You definitely want something don’t you?” Castiel tested him - the perplexity completely apparent on Balthazar’s face the moment he said it.
He was tired but the lack of voices gave him comfort. Dean places himself at the edge of the bed, his hands graze Sam's leg weakly, he stifles a gut wrenching cry and blinks away the pain collecting in his throat.
He follows his eyes and glares at the point of interest. It's much greyer than he could have hoped, especially with the brittle sand and the tombstones that claw their way out of it, it's quite morbid really. Their stomachs turn at it all and this wasn't even Dean's first graveyard. Castiel jabs his fingernails into his palm at the recognizable sight and stifles an exhale-even with his reluctance he looks at Dean for courage but he is frozen in the same way.
A white beam of light emerges a few feet above the ground- the light spreads out a vast spectrum and the ashes that touch it decimate instantly, it’s hard to describe the blinding effect the light possessed- but it somehow accentuated your emotions the more you stared at it- almost like staring into the sun. Castiel emerges from the luminous source unharmed- his clothes still hung loose on his body- he never realized how much weight he’d lost over the span of these few weeks; he heaves a heavy sigh and starts to stare at his palms- he turns them incessantly and watches his veins throb with vigor- he’s never felt this amount of power surge through him before- even in the first few years in his vessel.
“Yeah…this was a bad idea” He shuffles in the dark and takes his auburn jacket from the dresser “You can…you can leave if you want but I’ve paid for the room so…” he comments groggily as he fumbles with his jacket. After he finally manages to get it on he rushes through the door, not even stopping to hear the girl retaliate about the rain.
His shoulders shake from the pain rising in his chest and the lump in his throat “I thought…I thought I could make the hate and pain inside you a little less…I thought I could give Sam a life where he doesn’t have to lose his brother over and over again. But even now I screwed
Something was inside- glass crashes and the room starts to shake by the quakes from the other side. You fight the urge to call out for Castiel- something was going down on the other side of this door and it was torturing the life out of you to feel so helpless. You clench your fists upon the door as you place your forehead in defeat- Sam pulls on his hair as his eyes remain watery throughout while Crowley tries to keep his composure and maintains his balance on an old bed. There were strange shuffles, sometimes it sounded like claws but at times it shifted into normal footsteps- you couldn’t understand what it was- but the sudden chill in the air and your breathing was something both of you knew oh too well.
“Come on! You don’t really mean that, you had fun doing those jobs with us too- we did what we had to”
“Dean what the hell are you doing? YOU CAN'T JUST WALTZ INTO HIM HE’S A GOD DAMN NUKE” Bobby screams as his hat flies over his head and pokes into his left eye.
He represses even more and continues to walk expeditiously through the moss flowering hallway, he didn’t realize how fast he kept walking until he managed to stop abruptly in front of two massive doors.
Castiel blushes at the question, his eyes intense and wide as he holds onto the cat more tightly- his lips quiver from embarrassment and he kind of wishes he could get out the hole he dug for himself.
“Yeah, well you were mistaken. You can go now” Dean pouts as he rubs his hands uneasily and walks away.
Dean pursed his lips and rose with a groan, he runs his hand through his tangled hair as he turned towards his brother, clearly he was tired and frustrated from the anger growing in his throat "How many fucking times should I tell you Sam? Do you like being scolded and monitored like a damn baby?"
“How do we reverse it?” Dean directs his scream towards its melting body, he stares into its lifeless eyes and tries to figure it out somehow- but he can’t, it just stares at you menacingly without feeling any form of remorse-completely inhuman. It keeps exchanging glances from Dean, then Sam and then Castiel, its red eyes widening every time he sees him- what was going on?
…” Dean feels Castiel take him in his arms and pulls him into his lips, words couldn’t describe how grateful he felt when he reciprocated the emotion back-he didn’t have it in him to talk any further. And somehow Cas knew what to do, had they always been like this? Just ready to catch one another when the time came?
He hears the truck horn break through the fickle wind and dashes towards the sound, paying no heed to his actions from earlier. Dean stumbles upon the truck and ignores Castiel's bloody face of panic-he needed to focus. He starts to push the truck from the front, the ignition continues to phase out and it was not helping them feel any better. Dean screams into the metallic hood of the vehicle and pushes even further, his legs felt as if they were about to give out from the strain as he held back his loud grunts.
"And now it won't stop. Every frickin' night its the same dream. I see my brother... I see Dean lying lifeless on the ground, just lying and I don't know why but I can't get to him. I see weird claw marks on his neck and... I just can't? I can't..." Sam whispers into his hands as he tries to maintain himself once more. He looks up teary eyed but with an angry pout towards Crowley, who has crossed his leg over the other as he's bobbing his head in his hands "Now I know that I have to do something, this isn't any coincidence Crowley and what's worse is that... That thing out there? It's out to get my brother and I for one intend on trying to find it"
“Actually, yes- and a few abandoned houses here and there. But its mostly from gambling- not my finest moment but what can you do?”  he sneers over his explanation and slowly pulls away the tabby cat ornament Balthazar had in his hand- a small gesture like that made him walk away and move on with his conversation “Nothing more we can do, this is just how things are now so might as well gamble away!” his hands motion towards the sky as the emphasis in his tone dies down slowly “Which reminds me, the guys and I haven’t seen you around for a while- they clearly don’t care about you personally because they hate how you rob them of their victory- but me? Seeing how I’m the only one in this…. You get the picture”
Balthazar didn’t feel phased, just mildly annoyed really. He watches him groan silently as he places himself on his torn orange seat sluggishly- he still holds his head in his hands and refuses to look up at him.
Dean- as impatient as he seemed- waited for Castiel and let him have his moment. Biting his lower lip slightly Castiel swirled back to his old position and started moving quickly, regardless of how heavy his steps felt. He mentally embraced the heavy air that surrounded his stiff legs as he strolled non-seriously through the dead forest, Castiel felt less burdened the moment he started walking ahead of Dean, the silence between them grew so much that within minutes he had forgotten that he was actually behind him at all. He was relieved that he mustered up the courage to finally go back, back to the place that was the key to answering his questions. Even after all these years he doesn’t really know why he escaped that place so many years ago and why his brain had become so dense that he couldn’t find what was preserved inside it? Was he really just acting that naïve because he just needed a reason to stay away from that place in general?
“Do you not get tired of your own existence, Crowley?” he glares angrily, Sam’s eyes bulge out in shock and he wasn’t sure whether he should applaud him for the response or be offended for Crowley.
A before that I might not even remember; yes, I am the great Castiel after all. I had no control over anything in my life whatsoever, and that is disgraceful in its own way. I wasn't the same person anymore, I don't want to be the same person any more, what good was he? He failed to do anything he was told to,he failed to be loyal and just. He failed overall, then why must I always act like him? Why not someone else?
A voice calls out to him from his left; it took them a few calls to actually get his attention, to which a confused Castiel finally responds “I’m sorry?”
on each other-we would get lost along the way but we always made it back to each other in one piece, sometimes even with nothing” he rubs his eyes and red face as he continues “…so what made you think
I sat there motionless on a wooden chair,and beside it was a small round table with certain newspaper clippings on it. Killings? murders?  I knew where I was.
“What is going on with you? I already have one thing pestering my mind and I don’t need another mess to start, Cas! Whatever the hell it is I expect you to shape up, or better yet? Just leave. You’ve done your part so let me do mine” He turns back but only to see his shadow fade away from the wall
Dean always located some abandoned warehouses in the area, some would be practically empty and many would be too suspicious to enter, he believed that playing it safe would be the best option ever since the Collapse, even though as Sam remembered correctly-Dean was always the one willing to take risks in order to survive.
“I can’t believe this…” Castiel lets him go and rubs his clammy hands on his face- he’s boiling from the inside out and he can’t even say anything that’ll change that “I can’t go back there- I just can’t, Balthazar. I can never set foot there again”
“No, my actions…my behavior has been questionable- what I became…I didn’t know who I was anymore. I was so…”
“Spirit” Sam mouths slowly as he looks at you and breathes heavy puffs of smoke- the temperature kept dropping the more you waited- this was no ordinary spirit- just the thought alone terrified the both of you.
. He reviewed the footage and managed to find someone who matched his MO. The sight made him jump but he kept himself composed, Cas was smart enough not to keep his head up in every angle the cameras were placed but even then he knew who it was, he’d recognize his mannerisms anywhere.
I wore my brown leather jacket over a black turtleneck, something I would never wear but at least it kept me warm dammit. Instantly the sound of the bell startled me and I saw everyone run like they would never come back again. Where the hell was he?.
The multiplicity of sounds within it's voice falls smoothly on their ears, something neither of them could comprehend.
“Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t. I’m not really sure, his head was bent most of the time and I didn’t really get a good look at him if it’s the same guy” the teenager claimed “He asked about a bus station though and he went there. Is there a reason why you’re looking for the guy?”
"Well it seems to me that you care an awful lot about Castiel for him to get you so riled up this way"
I nodded my head and he laughed. His laughter invaded my ears and it never went away. The sun was setting behind us, a dim color of orange and yellow started to merge with the clear blue sky, there was nothing that could separate us. And there was nothing that could make me leave him again.
The sudden sound had jolted Dean out of his molding state, his abrupt turn brings a twist in his neck and his hands flail miserably as he tries to keep his balance, either way his drenched contortioned face was answerable enough.
“I’ve been better… this song made me feel much, much better-most definitely- so uhhh… thanks, for that”
“If I don’t know about this creature then how could he?” You argue with a slight bitterness in your tone.
“Ugh, again with the ‘I can do this alone’ speech we get it, okay?” Crowley mocks him near his ear- the wounded look in Castiel’s eyes was quite precious to be frank “These dumb asses are literally following you to your death and you still think you’re in this alone? Do you even know what loyalty is?”
The captain’s tent was located in the most secluded side of camp, right behind the torn down buildings and the overflowing sandbags that surrounded it. To say he was paranoid would’ve been an understatement-or so Crowley had assumed- ever since they found his unconscious ass bloody and bruised the time he was attacked by, what were they again? Ghouls? Djinn? Who cares, right? Since then he’s been trying to figure out a way to escape, the more he refused to get involved in anything the more he was dragged back in.
Sam felt a twinge in his chest when he heard those words, his eyes were fixated on his brother’s back as he breathed, it felt as if he lost all of his senses for a few minutes. He takes the cans out and supplies slowly. He approaches the pit and starts a fire, two minutes later he felt it's heat at in the palm of his hands.
“I wasn’t thinking that-but should I start thinking that way?” Castiel teases as he places his sleepy cat towards his side; his orange tail wraps around himself as he rolls into a ball and falls asleep instantly. Dean shakes his head with his eyes wide, a strange pleading mixed with his guilt as he started to apologize from his eyes even if it was muddled with every other emotion of panic, the action made Castiel laugh-his eyes melting at his flustered friend.
You try to hold back but you let out a laugh and feel the warmth inside of you burst as the whirring car drives through the unknown lands. Dean looks at you through the rearview mirror and grins with ardor, the green marbles meeting your own as your laugh turns into a small chuckle. You look away and graze the end of your nose with your index finger and watch the day fade.
The cat watches him with caution but ignores him. Castiel chuckles at its stubbornness and decides to get in closer. He extends his finger and draws it near the little thing, their wide eyes staring at him and at the strange interaction but still remains in the same spot. He drew in closer until he started tickling behind their ear and under its chin. The kitten was frozen and confused at first but slowly eased into the touch; liking it a bit too much as it began to mewl and nuzzle his palm.
The diner’s red roof panel glowed in the full grey sun, it wasn’t even red anymore but somehow it’s rusty color made him think of it that way, beige brick walls and glass sliding doors all dust and cobweb infested, it was disappointing to see it end up this way. He marches on and reaches the glass doors and slips his hands in between them and starts to push them sideways. The rust and the screeches didn’t make it easier for him but he still held on and persevered – the gap getting wider and wider the more he did. After the desired opening he stopped and dusted his hands off on his jeans and blinked with zeal, the darkness inviting him in.
Dean checks under his seat with his free hand "I stole a car, so I was wondering- no- hoping that there would be something here that could be useful, like a gun or something"
"Come on, I know you too well. You wouldn't be this worried over a stupid test. I know that you're thinking about how we will survive together."
“DEAN?!” Castiel screams back, his voice emanating a vulnerable sound- the way it does when he fails to hold himself together. Dean’s eyes widen when his gaze shifts from him to the demonic entity struggling on the ceiling “Is Sam?!...”
Dean walked out of the bathroom, his scent invading the room. He wore His olive green  jacket upon a pain black shirt, his jeans making sounds as he walked to the bed.
He notices robust and well sculpted his back is as he arched downwards, his skin agonizingly smooth even with the faded scars and bruises from injuries unknown.
“Dean, can’t you just-” Castiel squirms in his seat as he tries to open the door on his side, but the lock wasn’t working! “What the hell? Why isn’t it working?! Sam, open this door!” he pulls on the handle excessively, but the door is still stuck
“The latin word for ‘large sea creature’- okay we get it, can we go now?” Crowley mumbles as he elbows you harshly- you flinch by his gesture and give him a nasty glare.
From the corner of your eye you could see his sleuth like hands sway and pull out his silver pistol, it had runes and ancient symbols carved into its grip and ejection point, some enochian and some quite difficult to make out, but you knew what bullets the gun possessed and you took it as a sign to prepare yourself.
“Don’t you get it Dean? None of those things worked. Cas said so himself, even after the bullets and the blade he only stunned it for a while. The only thing that did something to them was…”
Castiel placed all of his items in his bag and he began to lie down on the floor before Dean waved in his direction.
“Do you ever stop? My god these jokes are doing a number on you Dean” He breathes playfully, his teeth shining in the sunlight
“Sammy, it’s gotta be that. The Shangri-la of all things supernatural, a hotspot and haven for dead things and creepy crawlies. Am I getting to you yet?”
The bone resembled the head of a small animal, either a rodent or a possum- he didn’t even see it when he came in- what was going on? Why was this thing staring at him dead in the eye?
Castiel has a dim expression wearing out on his aged face, the ‘maybe’ and ‘what ifs’ still swimming around in his head, he led a peacefully complex life to this point and he wanted it to drain him dry already, so why was he so hesitant to let his meagre life continue this way the moment this man began to speak? Castiel closed his eyes just to escape this world for a second, just to think of some way to find an answer for the man pleading to save his brother’s life. Why do these rushed emotions feel so familiar to him?
“Cas why are you doing this!? We can help!” Sam winces as he struggles to let himself go from his grasp, as do you.
“Woah! What is this beauty? Where the hell did you find this place from? I don’t remember this being here at all” Dean beams towards his brother who only stares back at him lethargically “Wait, were you driving all night again?” he places his hand on his face but Sam swats it away.
“Are you high or something? I was calling out to you for a while now. My friends were starting to think I was imagining you” she laughs underneath her grey beanie with a wave of her hand.
“I mean I did! The others thought it was a good idea too!” He was waving his hands around defensively as Castiel pulled on his shirt collar aggressively “But nothing is confirmed! He said he’d only consider it if I took him to the Edge and at that time I could only think of you and how you know where it is and-”
constantly resonated in his head as he stumbled in an achingly slow fashion. He peers into the grey room, the faded, warded walls stabbing his eyes and asking about something he didn't know. The cold desolate atmosphere embraces him and Dean could feel his heart stop the moment he saw his empty bed.
Castiel swallows hard as he runs his hand over Dean’s face; his fingers scrape his scalp and then linger down towards his cheek bone, the heavy bags under his eyes and the curves of his lips, all of it was sharp in his eyes-all defined and perfect to the touch. Dean’s eyes plead as he nuzzles Castiel’s hand weakly- he was patient with him even if they were losing themselves in their accustomed practices. But Castiel still holds himself back.
“Oh so you expect me to go to him? Seriously?” Dean exclaims with his hands in the air, Sam looks at him wide eyed- his puppy stare ensues.
“Woah-woah- Dean, we decided we aren’t going to let him out of our sight! And you’re telling him to go check? Alone?” Sam places his hand on Castiel who stands blank between them.
What feels like minutes just ends within seconds, Dean forcefully pulls himself back and gives off a huge sigh, both his hands are on your shoulders and he looks at you, slightly exasperated and red from every angle
it that way. I mean! Have you seen Sam and me? The guy betrayed me because he was amped up on demon blood! Hell he’s left multiple times after that…”
“I’m sorry, but I should be the one asking you the questions since that bloody thing belongs to your brother!”
“I remembered something” Castiel spoke in a sluggish tone; Dean raised his eyebrow and listened intently.
“I mean it” his stoic tone is back, his stare is deafening and numb in Dean’s eyes- something he’s felt from the old Castiel multiple times, but it’s the soldier of God version that he fears is speaking to him right now.
Dean tilts his head to the side- he couldn’t tell if he was agitated or whether he had just given up on him completely, Castiel didn’t want to think about it, not now.
“You know you’re not fooling anyone. You were involved way before any of them even wanted you to be. Dean knows it, Sam knows it-hell everyone in their social circle knows it so what’s stopping you from setting things right?”
“That’s…. reassuring… I guess?” Castiel answered sarcastically as his eyes squinted constantly. Dean looked at him and gave out a genuine- yet shortly lived- laugh. Castiel felt something tickle at the back of his throat and he held in a smile. Why did he feel so different all of a sudden?
” Castiel holds his face gently and starts to run his fingers all over it unconsciously, his eyes falter and somehow refuse to meet Dean’s eyes-he was so lost within every atom that constructed his entire being-every atom that made him Dean. How could anyone hate him?
Dean yelps as I grab his collar and lift him up, I drag his body to the nearest wall and ram him into it, making sure it hurt him real nice.
"Why aren't you saying anything Sam?" Dean spoke as he stared at his brother firmly, Sam shuffled in his spot and suddenly gasped out a smile, his nervous ragged chuckles couldn't overcome the tears that began to well up in his tired eyes. Dean watches him, completely taken aback by the attitude he displayed over his scolding.
The faint glow from the window spread over Dean's worn out eyes, indicating that the sun was somewhere out there in the empty sky. Was there even a sun to look at anymore? He slowly opens his eyes and groans, he lets out a warm yawn as he cracks his neck and every bone in his hands. He still stared out of the smudgy glass and scratches the tremors in his skin.
The sun shines a miserable light upon his sweaty brow, his hair dusty and frazzled from the strange static lurking in the air. His duffel bag is cozy upon his waist as its wrapped tightly around his chest with his little feline snoozing within it, ruffling all of the neatness away. Castiel rubs his hand over his forehead as he continues moving forward on the empty highway, a gas n sip flaring in the afternoon sun. He takes a sigh of relief as he confirms that he wasn’t imagining it-the thought made him pick up the pace instantly.
“Your kind being? Are you some sort of vengeful spirit? A creature from another world?” Now it was you who spoke, the shadow’s skull twisted and turned towards you, attuned to your body and it’s inner machinations as it imitated your vessel's breathing.
He finally braces himself as he dips his legs into the water, the cold stabbing into his skin in the most amazing way “Gaah! Sam! You gotta get a load of this, the waters’ freezing!”
"How is it possible that he was here 3 months ago? He's been gone for much longer than that... What the hell was he up to?"
"No need to rush me, I'm not going to bite... Yet" he spoke with a slight irritation in his voice "What the hell brought you out here in the first place? And with the boys no less"
Dean blinks swiftly at his innocent tone and the hurt eyes that bore into him-how could he be this soft in front of him? And how did he know that these tactics worked on Dean a little too well?
“Oh. So what did people call you then? I could say those if you want” Dean smacked his lips as he kept looking at Castiel with his loose collar and bulging chest.
The windowsill hums lazily as the dim wind, tiny fragments of ice swim in an empty glass of whiskey within the fingers of a man who enjoys the comfortable silence. Crowley watches his wrinkly thumb caress the edge of his crystal glass, almost as if he could manipulate time itself.
“I don’t know if I should even use my powers for these things. It would be a waste…especially how uncertain I am about how long it’ll last” Castiel speaks softly, his eyelashes bouncing slowly, the harrowing thoughts slowly making their way back. He shakes his head erratically and starts searching for something inside his trench coat, he pulls the desired item out-the same cover glowing in the sun’s yellow glory. He had grazed through this book several times now, it was still difficult to understand everything that was written but he always felt a calm spread over him as he read it over and over. Bringing some form of cohesiveness in these bland days. He brushes through the pages and ends up on one he’s read much more than the others.
“It’s hard to say goodbye to the both of you twice in a row now. I want to come- damn it I want to but your brother is so damn stubborn that…”
Castiel walks around in his dusty enclosure with a tired grin- he seems aged in these past few moments the more he concentrated on Balthazar’s musings, but something lurks underneath his eyes, the vague obelisks wandering to and fro.
He turned around to see a puppy dog eyed Dean Winchester still pleading even after his gruesome threat but this time he was begging from his eyes alone, where did all the dominance go tough guy?. Castiel managed to smile in return but his eyes showed the exact opposite reaction.
He swallows hard at the thought but he couldn’t see any other name befitting of him and his round green eyes with hints of gold.
“Lead the way” you manage to croak as you escape from his stare- how much time had passed since?- it doesn’t matter.
Castiel swallows hard as his eyes shift between Dean and the tape, it felt so easy to break within his  hands and it terrified him even more to even think about it “You…you couldn’t possibly mean that. You kept it? All this time and you…still kept it?”
The motel’s neon sign was blazing and sending off a strange colored steam in the rain, he watches it from behind a dusty curtained window and rubs his hands over his thighs-his jeans stinging the scratches upon them.
Sam carried on with no remorse in his voice; he paused for a while before he took a deep breath and started speaking again.
” You read slowly with your squinted eyes, making sure you read it all correctly even with the scarce light source and distorted handwriting.
“I’m working on that part- but I mean the other parts fit though, you gotta give me credit for that at least”
“Yeah? So what-I never get to have my alone time anymore? Everyone just takes it as an invitation to piss me off?”
“Yeah…so Crowley, I need your help in finding someone” He turns the lights off and places his hand on the doorknob “It’s…its Cas”
“Really? I always thought it did” Dean hums near Cas’ lips but he makes sure they never meet “Is this it?”
"I'm glad that the two of you managed to come out of it. Sam should be waking up soon too but...something tells me that isn't the case. Your friend here also gave it a shot when we pulled him out of the rubble but he didn't show any signs of response"
"I discovered some items the old man had, a great collector honestly; and I traded all of them to get by and only kept the things I needed most. This is the only life I lead now-what more can I say? Whatever happened to me at the Edge...”
Dean rubs his forehead under Cas’ chin and mewls gently-the sound soothes him as he lay his head on Dean’s pillow and lies in a fetal position-he fights the urge to sleep-why was he so sleepy?
The rain drops were heavy on his head as he shuffles towards baby awkwardly, his hair soggy upon his forehead and his breaths paving a smoky path in the air-he felt nauseas by the beer and rain smell from his clothes but he couldn’t….what was he thinking about again?
“No!” Castiel jolts defensively as he clutches onto the ends of his sleeves, the shake within him never subsiding “No one knows. Only…only you”
Sam holds me and buries his face in my right shoulder, his fingers tremble from my constant garble and tears.
Your eyes bear a puzzling look, you never delved into books such as these, only enochian scriptures or spells and incantations, so what was this about? You shake your head but the puzzled expression still lingered. You slowly put the book back but a twinge in your chest made you think otherwise.
“About what?” Castiel wanders over his question with a strange innocence lurking in his tone “You know
“Sam?” Dean’s thick voice roars in the bunker, his steps seemed stable enough, he still wondered if he was drunk but chose to deliberate on that later “In here!” Sam shouts from the doorway and goes back to the endless metal shelves waiting to be organized, the radio humming away in the room as he does. He now waits.
The creature screams in what seems like pain- its shrill wails rupturing your organs the more it tried to escape from his grasp- a strange begging inside those hollow sockets that strip you of any thoughts. The glow from his eyes doesn’t seem to subside even with all of the carnage erupting around their feet, you try to stand but you only end up holding yourself together from the pain-you couldn’t see how you were going to escape from this.
He’s hesitant for a while but finally manages to speak as he bites his lower lip “Yeah- I…I guess I did. I just never thought I’d get to live even this long, that’s all. It’s never really been about what we wanted after all” he rubs his face gently and motions Sam to walk with him “I know it hasn’t always been that way but…it doesn’t mean we just…stop either, is it?” Sam speaks in a somber tone as he tries to make eye contact with him- his glassy pupils evading his as he continued “I mean, we’ve been dealing with these things for so long, saving people and occasionally each other, hell-
“You wouldn’t have listened. You didn’t even address it when I had those panic infused black outs. I can’t blame you, you were already so hell bent on saving your brother, so how could I have expected you to listen and understand?”
“Well, yeah. I had a drink or two. Maybe more, but why does that matter? I’m on vacation! Maybe I wanna make mistakes”
“Lose the blade, you dumbass. It’s scaring the damn thing” Dean hissed as he tried to keep his cool. Castiel glanced at his right hand that was still gripped tightly on the blade and he ridiculously shoved it back into his belt quickly. Dean had his hand raised as he approached cautiously, the moose was reluctant and it was making a lot of noise by shuffling around in it's clustered spot. Dean shushed and soothed the moose as he kept on getting closer; Castiel stood at a distance and gazed at him, amazed by his technique. Within a few steps Dean placed his hand on the animal’s nostril and scratched slightly, the animal huffed and grunted by the contact but it became much more comfortable by the atmosphere Dean had created. He slowly produced his knife and started cutting the pieces of the net off of its antlers “Castiel, you cut the net off from the green garbage box, and do it quickly so that it doesn’t have time to react” Castiel nodded and reached the rear end of the moose, he was nauseas by the smell of the massive animal and he held in his breath and started to cut hesitantly.
"The name's Bobby Singer, I'm Sam and Dean's uncle of some sort, so no need to be afraid, if you don't want to trust me then by all means do whatever the hell you want, not my business to care really" his baseball cap bounces with him. Castiel nods slightly, still a bit dazed by his fiasco from a few minutes ago.
The aura around this place was grey like everything else but he couldn't deny the serenity from it. He muses and stares wide eyed while he kept his footing firm. He breathes freely, the dampness in the air a welcoming moisture in his throat-he hasn’t felt this level of peace in years and every breath he took eased his tired bones.
Castiel places his warm hand on Dean's, his glowing green eyes turn towards him and he could see him build his walls once more, just like they always did
“I told you already, I don’t know. Your lives will not be risked I can tell you that much, alright?”
“To think this place was magical back in the day- torture, unsolicited human experimentation, not to mention a bloody train just for the bodies alone- who wouldn’t want to come here?” Crowley mewls into your ear as he takes his blade out and swings it with anticipation- his cheeriness was starting to annoy you the longer you allowed him to breathe down your neck.
“That’s not even what I asked, Damn it Cas you really have the nerve to talk to me like that, especially after everything”
“Cas?” He hears Dean’s softness in the clouds, or whatever this place was-you wished you could hide your ecstasy but seeing him here brought out almost the opposite reaction “Dean? You’re not supposed to be here”. You hear him from afar but when he responds his voice booms just inches away from you-you turn towards the sound and see him walk towards you with his eyes wandering over his own hands and legs as if he recovered them from somewhere “Heh, I was actually hoping I wasn’t going to wake up after that”
Dean arose from one of the student's seat and approached me slowly, his pace was slow and his shirt had dried a bit so I was thankful for that. I looked at him and asked for an answer.
This is officially the last chapter in the story. The next chapter will be an Epilogue and it will be coming out soon! It's gonna be a fluff piece and I hope you guys enjoy it, thank you for being on this journey with me even if it took me forever and a shitty finale to write it.
“When do you intend on waking them up? We need to get a move on you know” Crowley walks towards him, his neck buried under his jacket’s thick collar.
“Sam?!” Dean practically shouts as he sees his little brother enter the room, he had the most illuminating aura and it made him forget about all of the headaches and pains in his body. Sam stood tall- towering above them- he still looks slightly weak but much better than the last time he saw him- his tired eyes seeped with happiness even if his smile fell weakly on his face. His cheeks hung loosely because of the weight loss but even so he looked well- Sam is wearing red and black plaid with black jeans, a grey flannel shirt hangs loosely over his body- Dean could tell that it wasn’t his size- especially how it was so loose and short on him- just the thought of Sam rummaging through Bobby’s wardrobe made him laugh. “It’s good to see you Dean”
Castiel’s eyes gaze upon him, a small smile breaking out from the colors that keep bleeding out, Dean only sees him, his spectrum of colors and the blue that stands out the most, he pleads from his eyes-he doesn’t know what he’s asking of him but he doesn’t stop. Castiel’s eyes radiate warmth as he smiles with an ache; he watches Dean and nods slowly in response.
Sam straightens himself up without separating his back from the door but he feels jumped by an unknown friend sitting on all fours, their eyes staring into his soul just a few feet away. Sam watches the cat stare directly at him and his confused eyes, this interaction was…interesting.
He stumbles towards Cas even with the incessant falls but he wasn't prepared for what he would see next.
“I know that idjit, and I know you too. It’s just… what’s an old man gotta do to make himself useful around here?”
He remained silent and managed to finish packing his bag, his hands were shaking and an uneasy, dizzy spell was erupting in his synapses
There was no mark on it. I couldn't understand why that was so, I remember jabbing it into my burned out skin, I could feel the blood leaving the source. But yet, there was nothing?. I was losing my head, I needed to go home and contemplate on these things; Maybe take a few pills and fall asleep too. I looked at my cheap Casio watch and saw that I had missed half an hour of my class, was it really that long?. I sighed, one of my most miserable sighs and I left the filthy walls and mirrors. I could still hear the rain drops, it reminded me of a distant memory I had long forgotten.
“Cas, we really need to talk” Dean stood in place, making sure Castiel doesn’t force his way out of their intervention. All of a sudden he adjusts himself- he’s wearing a reversed color scheme of Dean’s pajamas, as if a small child woke up from a nightmare, so bereaved of affection and love. Cas’ eyes dim down from their usual blue, he sat down on the bed again, but this time facing Dean and turning his back towards Sam- who was still standing in the corner and observing the scenario taking place in front of him. Dean keeps his distance from him- he didn’t want to but he didn’t have it in him to accept everything that had happened.
A large boot appears at the doorway and a hand slides its way in from the door frame- his clean brown locks covering his face and an endearing head over his slouched shoulders emanating a somber humming in the room- he knew Sam stood by the door this whole time but he didn’t have it in him to address him right now, his eyes were too fixated on his own feet and the weighing shame that was starting to bury him alive.
“I mean…we’ve been waiting to do something like this for years now so for once I just want you to not think about anything. We have food and beer and…” Sam touches the dashboard softly as he beams “…even if we don’t have everything and everyone, at least we have parts of it, you know? That’s why I don’t want any senile talk happening today”
It’s Sam, him and his eyes glittering in the sunlight, his freckles deep on his skin as he smiles. He looks healthy, almost pristine in his dark green plaid and faded blue jeans which you’ve seen him wear over a thousand times, but somehow are still in awe at how handsome he looked.
“Okay, maybe not again but let’s just hope there are like…canned potatoes or something. Are there canned potatoes?” Dean asked with a strange witty confidence in his voice. Sam chuckled over his insight on and hunmed affirmatively, he didn't want to crush Dean’s hopes by telling him he was wrong. Dean watches him questioningly until he was satisfied by his answer and turns his head back. Sam tightened his grip on his bag and walked a little faster behind Dean, towering over him completely.
There was a spark in Dean's eyes and his lips quivered at the journal he pulls away "This... This is Sammy's journal..."
Dean pants as they hold each other, his mouth agape and failing to process anything coming out of Cas’ mouth.
His eyes looked heavy, the blue in them dim and robust, his neck wound wasn't bandaged anymore but the scars were still there, just slightly though. He places his hands over his face and feels how dangly and stretchy his skin had become, not to mention how tanned he looked from his travels. He looks unbearably ugly.
Their bodies grow weary in the truck that shakes excessively, the groaning engine a nightmare to ignore. Castiel tilts his head over the rolled down window and cradles it despite the constant drumming from the vehicle. It felt heavy even now.
Okay so I've come to realize how badly written my Fanfic is lmaooooo. So many errors and such a bad writing style! I'll definitely keep making corrections here and there throughout, so I hope all of you still like it- those who've stuck around basically.
Sam turns his head slightly and he notices people and tradesmen looking towards them; Sam assumed that they might know of them and he felt paranoid by their strange stares.
“Y- yeah! I’m alright.” Sam responds shakily, the concrete barrier wasn't budging even as they dug through it
“I’m not here for long; I only came because you needed me-” he lingers with his tongue, Dean’s back is facing him and he turns him around to complete his sentence “-or something of the sort?”
They stand in silence for a while, their eyes wander over him from time to time but Cas doesn’t meet their gaze, he keeps his eyes glued to the puddles and mud sticking to his shoes-sometimes even beyond the streetlights and the coffee shops around the corner. Everything felt so still at the moment-as if the world before this was washed away with the rain.
“My powers… are strange, Sam. I’m much stronger, a lot stronger than I’ve been in years. But it’s finite, it drains me the longer I keep using it. I don’t know how I procured it and how much longer it’ll be until it’s gone again, all I know is that they hold the answers to this world and it may be your only chance to fix things”
But one thing that does make me wonder is that, what is my purpose here? Where did I come from? Where do I belong? Do I even exist anymore? Why couldn't I remember what had happened to me after the fall.
Rubbing your eyes helped a little and you start to see clearly again. The grass you see now was a lot larger and thicker in comparison. There lay a massive open field surrounded by birch trees, the moonlight shines upon the slightly watery greens and what you see in the middle is what takes your breath away completely. Was this a dream again?
He extends his hand over his shoulder but Castiel flew from his grasp. He pushes on the door and falls to the ground with a loud thud. Dean screams out for him helplessly, almost too afraid to know what was going through his head but even with his strained voice his shaky body refused to stop and instead of coming back inside he starts to run, fast.
“It’s… we must be close- there isn’t much time left” he mumbles as he covers his face and grazes it slowly- he blinks several times and the same color resides once more; you leave the truck and turn him around to check but he doesn’t amuse you this time- he walks forward and bends his neck to look upwards. Sam and Crowley follow suit and look up as well- their mouths agape with a shiver going down their spine.
“I can’t leave, not yet…” Castiel whispers as his wounded gaze finally meets Dean’s, the panic seeping from his lips “There’s still…”
"Let's just say, don't keep your hopes up" I confessed, blowing smoke out of my mouth. Dean kept gazing at me with his eyes, he seemed tired and disturbed and that made me worried. Dean opened his arms and I ran into them without hesitation, his warmth invaded me and tingled me all over. Slowly his grip on me became tighter, trapping me completely and making me powerless. His fingertips started tracing circles on my scalp and soon his whole hand was sliding through my hair. Dean kept his dry lips on my head and he stayed like that for several minutes.
He takes a few steps back, as slowly as possible. He wanted to take a chance, even the most miniscule- he wanted to take it.
“There’s nothing I wanna talk about, let’s just focus on everything else right now. Save Crowley, trap or kill the shit that are after us and reverse everything. Simple. Done-zo”
Dean feels the lyrics run over his skin, it didn’t seem bad but it was definitely something he never listens to…but the rhythm of it seemed peaceful and fitting.
They ate in silence, which wasn’t very long because they annihilated their food within seconds, Castiel opened one of the small pockets in his back pack once he was done and in he procured a strip of medicine. His second hand searched through one of the larger pockets and he took out his metallic flask.
Sam pushes on Crowley’s back, a little rougher than he needed to be. Crowley smiles his usual smile, trying his best to keep his snickers intact.
"Cas, what the hell? Why the fuck would it be better? Do you enjoy not knowing who you were? Do you enjoy having your head up your ass?, running away from your past? None of those things seem fine." I retaliated, my constant shouting had scared him, he was doing a good job keeping an expressionless face, but I knew better.
“I’ll be taking that, that’s not for sale” Sam reaches out swipes the box away from his hands. Toby felt insulted, almost shattered; he supports himself by the edge of the table and dug his nails deep “I’ll be willing to trade anything for that. Name your price and you can have it”.
Castiel sighed over his constant drabble and finally left it alone, it was a little tight on him but it was well wrapped, it wasn’t too tight so he found breathing bearable able and…
You see the sun break out from the unbroken ground- the radiating glow reaches you slowly and everything feels new again-you feel…cleansed, again. The sunlight tickles my quivering lips and brings a smile to my face, the wrinkles on my brow and around my eyes digging so deep into my skin it almost hurt-all of this hurt so much-why?
“Several- they all seem clustered together so it’s hard to say” Castiel whispers near your ear and Sam’s- his breath sending a warmth down your neck and cheeks “But I’ll say maybe 10”
Dean stops midway, his index finger is pointed outwards and he starts shaking it profusely while the other is hidden in his pocket “Holy crap. It can’t be-“
Dean tried searching for an object that could’ve been hard enough to incapacitate him but everything circled around his battered head. He decides to try something even more reckless to make the spinning stop.
“Dean-how is he? How’s Sam?” Castiel lets his cat go but he slips between his legs and settles down on the ground.
"Okay, I'm done now... So let me go instantly so that I still have my dignity" Castiel mumbles as he pulls away. Dean clears his throat and fixes his shirt collar, opening a button from the bottom. His demeanor more stoic and manly the longer his blinking ensued.
Crowley felt the aching bulge in his throat burst out and invade his jaw, the strange aftertaste made him feel like swallowing his tongue.
“Dean, what the hell? You didn’t need to take the guy’s jacket” Sam whispers, the embarrassment seeping out from his tone.
‘I accept. Whatever it is I accept it” Cas mellows down and nods his head robotically. Sam is taken aback by his sudden answer- the nasty exterior and tone chipping away almost instantly.
Several minutes pass until Dean releases the truck and they move once more, he hears him mumble a "Can't be too careful" and he feels the weight of his words. Castiel looks outside and lets his eyes wander over the scene. This will just be another image in his mind-just like any other face he'll forget. He doesn't want to remember anymore. Not this, not any of this.
“That’s the thing Dean.” Sam interrupts quietly, he sees his brother’s conflicted stare- the dread written on his face as he tried answering further- but Dean already knew.
They stare into each other for a while longer until the light starts to swallow them all, Castiel’s wings are the last thing that he sees as he reaches out even now, thinking that he’ll come back somehow.
“Is there honestly a point to this, Balthazar?” Castiel covers his face from the frustration- his endless talking was annoying him to the core.
His ego was at stake here! How could he allow that? He could handle things himself but now...he felt soft. On the verge of just giving up entirely.
Dean nods slowly with a delayed gulp. His head shook whenever he spoke about something so deeply, just like he does now “I…I wanted to give this to you back then. I had it all planned out…we were going to go out after dealing with the case-Sam bailed on us so it made even more sense to give it to you then. We would eat and drive home in baby but before we drove off I would’ve…I would’ve given you this. I would make sure it was in the dark because…my face would’ve been red all over and I didn’t think I could handle your reaction when you took it-you know? Maybe I’d even offer to play it on the deck and then you would’ve…you would love it too and… I… I wanted to give this to you six years ago. Six years before anything happened, before I lost you and Sam and…before I lost everything” Dean bites his lower lip as he turns away from him, he didn’t want to look the other way but it was just a reflex at this point. Castiel watches the back of his messy head and fought the temptation to run his hands through them, he could sense him fight something from within and every breath slowly became a mellow sigh-he found himself in synch with Dean’s breaths as a tear stains his cheek-this wasn’t working out the way he had hoped. It was happening all over again-this feeling-this numbness, this ghostly air that separates them again.
from what it said! It’s something that can’t…We need to leave now or else we won’t live long enough to find another way!”
Dean smacks his lips, annoyance seeping off from his face- he started adjusting his white t shirt and black pajama bottoms as he slides out of bed slowly. His bare feet reach the floor and feels the cold wooden boards tickle his skin, the lack of heating in this cabin was something he noticed now of all times.
“Don’t worry Sam, he was just leaving” Dean speaks through a gutted smile as he steps in and separates the two of them. Castiel places his own hands on Dean’s arm and refuses to move away from Sam-who is tangled awkwardly between their spat.
but…it’s just going to take me some time. Maybe months, maybe years but I need to find that safe space inside of my head again on my own”
“Still right here, just by the way” Crowley speaks from across the fire pit. His mouth still a smug grin even as he’s eating
more. Your mouth is agape as he starts to unfurl his wings; they stretch out above him- their girth massive and hovering like a dark cloud above them.
The uneven ground and grassy texture made it hard for you to find firm footing but you manage to run at a fast pace with only the moonlight guiding you through it all-what the hell was happening right now?  You almost fall from an invisible edge and keep your eyes peeled as you step down towards flatter ground. With closed eyes you breathe in slowly-your gun at the ready if needed. How far had you run? You couldn’t even tell from the spots that appeared before you.
Damn it, I couldn't. I needed to see him, I needed to know if I was right. I needed to know if it was him.
He pulls the black t shirt over his head and slips into the cozy grey sweats he left, the shirt had the name of the band Dean loved so much-he felt full at the gesture-the fact that he gave him this shirt in particular makes him quiver. He rubs the logo slowly, his heartbeat thumping away through his chest. Castiel folds his own clothes and trench coat and piles them up as he walks towards the laundry room. He places the finished clothes in the dryer while he puts the dirty ones in the wash and turns the handle with fear, he was still afraid of dials after the mishap back at the community center-he was given kitchen duty for two weeks after that and he’s felt guilty about it ever since. He never knew how humans remembered all of these functions and buttons!
