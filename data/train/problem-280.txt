“Well. See, these two, whaddya call em...roughnecks, I guess, the bearded fella and the deaf one, they must be looking for Malvo. They found me, then you, and tossed us both in the trunk of their car. They were going to kill us. You were out for most of it. They took us to the lake, cut a hole in the ice. Asking all kinds of questions about who killed Sam Hess, who did we work for. I had this taser I took from my brother’s house, and I used it on the bearded fella, bought me a little time to pick you up and we ran like heck.” Lester paused, clearly proud of himself, and looked at John expectantly.
Mrs Hudson rattled out of the kitchen while John was still staring at the text with a crooked grin. She laid a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. "Sherlock going with you?"
“Then I’ll get sick with you, and we’ll take care of each other.” John’s eyes flash, and he pushes up on his hands and knees, cocks his head to the side and glares at Sherlock. “You really don’t get it, do you? That’s what people do, Sherlock. They
Sherlock rings his index finger and thumb around the base of John’s cock, and they just barely touch around the girth of him. Sherlock’s so turned on, he wants to rut against the zipper of his jeans, John’s shin, anything. Usually sucking cock makes his own erection flag, but sucking John makes his entire body tremble with desire - just the smell of him is intoxicating. He meets his fingers with his mouth, glans pushing against his throat as the tip of his nose brushes soft damp hair. He could do this forever.
“And there he is. That’s lovely. That’s perfect.” John nuzzles against Sherlock’s temple, and shifts so they’re mostly laying down, savouring the warm weight of a sleepy Sherlock half on top of him. “See? Needed
, of all things, but to have the tutor act like a complete dickhead straight off… John had called Mike Stamford and demanded to know what the hell kind of tutor he had sent him to that starts out by insulting the person they’re supposed to be tutoring.
They move out of Baker Street on a Saturday afternoon in September. It's unseasonably warm, and John's red-faced and sweating by the time they've filled half the rented van.
John slid it under the table and thumbed it open. The bills were hundreds. Well. More money than he'd ever seen, even before, when he and Sherlock were working cases. He went for his poker face, tried not to look stunned. It went into his jacket pocket as the waitress reappeared with a coffee mug and a handful of prepackaged creamers.
“Even his texts annoy me.” John mutters, though in truth he’s relieved and grateful to have Mycroft at their sides. They’ve always relied on him more than either of them is willing to admit, and now is no different.
going to just kill you both, but somehow, plan number two now seems more appropriate. See ya round, Sherlock.” He starts to walk up the steps, in between them, and waves his hand dismissively. “You know what to do.”
At some point, Sherlock drifts awake to the smell of coffee and lemon muffins. His stomach rumbles, hungry in a way he’s not been in what seems like forever.
“I’ve never been more so, John.” Sherlock rubs their noses together and slides down, nestles against John’s chest and wraps his arms around him.
He smoothes a flat palm against Sherlock’s curved spine, and twists the thumb of his other hand just so. Sherlock's entire body bucks wildly as a sonorous groan reverberates through his chest. John rubs his hand slow up Sherlock's back. “There we go, that’s it, darling. Oh, god, so beautiful. I love to watch you.”
“You. Didn’t expect you today, you’re round rather late, aren’t you?” Jim rubs his hair, yawns. He's always bored, with everything.
.” Sherlock’s mouth against his neck, pulling on a tendon sucking hot salty skin between his teeth, he can feel the vibrations of John’s vocal chords through his lips. Nips at John’s skin, sucks hard enough to leave a bruise, and John’s wriggling on his lap, his thighs tensing. He tries to lean back, pull John on top of him. It's feels like he's suspended underwater, and John's the only way he can breathe.
Fingers clenched in damp sweaty curls, John slammed his hips forward as hard as he could. “Oh, fuck, fuck...shit, that’s so good.”
“How did you -- why --” Can’t form a thought, still half crouched on the ground, knee digging into a broken chunk of asphalt. John's looking down with steely glare still in his eyes.
, Sherlock.” John’s words come out in a gasping sort of sob, the kind that escapes all the louder and more desperate the more it’s held in. “Do you really think, after all this, after everything you’ve done - do you really bloody think that there’s anything you could do that I wouldn’t forgive you for?”
My foul mood instantly evaporated at the sight of him. His face was relaxed and content, a small smile playing at the corners of his lips, above which the bristles of his well kempt mustache twitched with the nearly imperceptible movements of his mouth. His long golden eyelashes fluttered delicately against his ruddy cheeks, eyelids dancing as he dreamt. The thick blonde hair that I so loved to sink my fingers into was tousled and mussed, falling boyishly across his forehead. His well shaped arms were folded across his chest, the sleeves of his crisp white shirt rolled up to his elbows, and his braces hung loose round his hips. There were smudges of ash on his thighs from his habit of rubbing his hands on his trousers after he’d built a fire in the evenings.
"How was the appointment?" Sherlock's voice trembles just enough that John notices. No one else would, but he does.
Sherlock doesn’t so much turn as unfurl, his muscles slackened by extended arousal, his legs falling open as he sprawls back against the sheets. John props himself up on his left elbow and runs his right hand down Sherlock’s torso, leaving trails of lube shiny across his belly. Sherlock moans and shifts, stretches his arms above his head, completely given over to John’s veneration of his body.
The table is set with a candle in a chianti bottle, and John knows Sherlock did it on purpose, recalling that night at Angelo's a millennia ago. The start of them. The sentiment of that is a tremendous comfort. It's another reminder, of their immediate connection, of that bond that's been strained and twisted and frayed over the years, but never broken..
“Something new?” Sherlock’s eyes are immediately alight, his posture stiffening, ready to go flying down the stairs to Scotland Yard, to a new crime scene.
“He needs one.” She bent down to replace the catheter bag, straightened up and planted her hands on her hips. “He’s going to be here for a little while. Real banged up."
The profundity of that statement, though John knew it, is staggering. He can't talk. So he does what Sherlock told him to do, as he usually does, and kisses him.
John presses his hips against Sherlock's thigh. "I think we gave - " John licks Sherlock's Adam's apple, stubble rough against his tongue, soft wool scarf against his lip. "The cashier at Boots - " He unbuttons the top button of the Belstaff, nuzzles against Sherlock's collarbone inside his shirt. "Quite the afternoon. Two middle aged men pawing at each other while buying a huge box of condoms and a bottle of lube."
“And you’re just as amazing as you were the first day we met. Shit. This is bloody awful, dying. I can’t even
He lapped at him soothingly as John’s body relaxed back down into the bed, pulling off with the proud smirk he could never quite conceal. John was making little whimpering sounds and shivering every few seconds. Sherlock put reverent lips to the swell of John’s hipbone, nosed and kissed his way up his heaving stomach, nuzzling at the soft blonde peach fuzz that ended just over his sternum.
“Alright, I’m just going to shower, and then we’ll be off. Be a love and put on coffee while I’m in the loo.”
John’s entire body jerks, his shoulders tightening, and he makes a small, desperate sound and then gasps out, “More. Please. I need, I need more.”
“Nope. Eat your toast. Seduction won’t get you out of it.” John pulls back and stands up, walks over to the window and looks down into the alley. “I hope Greg never calls.”
Time slows to a trickle as the air in the room grows thicker, the scent of their shared arousal drifting humid and heavy over them as their kisses become more heated, more needy. John sweeps his tongue along the side of Sherlock’s once more and drifts away from his mouth, nosing under his jaw and licking the thin skin, experimentally pulling it between his lips.
. John shoves his fingers harder into Sherlock, moaning brokenly, and rolls him over flat on his back. He gets on all fours, caging Sherlock underneath him, cock standing out hard and blood hot, the wet tip nudging against Sherlock’s thigh. He sucks a bruise on Sherlock’s collarbone, to match the ones on his hip, on his throat, and thrusts into Sherlock’s grasp. His cock swells between Sherlock's fingers, a thin strand of precome dripping.
John stops talking and dips down, presses a soft closed mouth kiss to Sherlock’s lips. He begins to pull away far too soon. Sherlock twines his arm around the back of John’s head, and holds him there. John hums and acquiesces, sinks down against Sherlock’s chest and swipes his tongue along the rim of Sherlock’s lower lip. They stay that way, slowly kissing, breathing each other in, the hot fires of arousal cindered down into this warm give and take. John’s thumb never stops slowly stroking Sherlock’s cheek.
to know he’s here. Why didn’t he say so?” Now that they're discussing this aloud, the nervous restlessness John's felt all day settles into a calm dread, the kind he can live with for an undetermined amount of time.
Twenty minutes ago they were laughing with Harry and smoking and drinking cold coffee out of chipped secondhand mugs.
"I certainly don't feel like moving. Come here, love." John rolls to his back, pulling Sherlock alongside him, reminded of how naturally their bodies fit together. The way the swell of John's bicep tucks into the curve of Sherlock's neck, the hollow of Sherlock's stomach aligning against the crest of John's hipbone.
“Oh, Jesus, Sherlock, look at you, look at you, Christ,” John babbles heedlessly, not even knowing what he’s saying, mesmerised by Sherlock’s blushing straining face, his long black lashes fluttering against his cheeks, those full lips swollen and parted as his cock pulses twice more and he shivers forward, collapsing against John with a whimper.
Soldier Boy tilts his head enchantingly to the side as the tip of a dark pink tongue darts out to lick his lips. Sherlock barely holds back a sigh, immediately thinking of that tongue swirling over his nipples, licking hard at the head of his cock. The space between them is already crackling with heat, a hushed intimacy enveloping them as they stare steadily into each other’s eyes. The thudding din of the club fades, the roar of five hundred voices quiets into near silence, as everything falls away except the two of them locked together by nothing more than a gaze.
"John!" Sherlock startles out of his mind palace state as he always does, John's name at the forefront of his thoughts. Always John’s name, even when he was gone, even when he was with
“Oh John, John, John…” Sherlock sobbed out, and came, pulsing wet and gorgeous into John, let go of his hair and wrapped his arms around him, hips rocking shallowly until he finally slowed. John laid his arms over Sherlock’s on his belly, let him whimper and huff against his back, until his head was so heavy with endorphins that he couldn’t stay upright anymore.
John works at him with gentleness, stretching him first around one finger, and then easing the second into him centimeter by centimeter. The tight heat surrounding his fingers triggers a delicious wave of fresh desire singing down through his nerve endings, and suddenly he’s painfully aware of his thus far completely neglected cock. He eels up tighter alongside Sherlock and rocks against his hip as he pushes his fingers deeper inside.
They lay there entwined, panting against each other, until John’s head clears enough to register how absolutely disgusting they both are.
They curl together, breathing heavily, and kiss and kiss and kiss. Kiss until their mouths are sore from each other’s stubble.
“Mike already told me you were with John. So, how’d it goooo?” She lays her head against Sherlock’s shoulder and prods him in the thigh with her fingers. “Come on, spill it.”
They drove in silence for a few kilometers, rain drumming a rhythm over the music, John leaning his head against the window and singing along quietly. Sherlock slipped a hand over the top of John’s thigh, fingers tapping out the melody line on the soft denim. They stayed that way, a cosy quiet descending over both of them, until Sherlock spotted a sprawling pinkish white building by the side of the road, cars parked scatteringly in its lot.
Sherlock unfolds the cardboard flaps, peers into the box and tilts his head to the side. Smiles slow and looks up at John, his eyes liquid and black, thrumming with heat.
He shuts his eyes, burning with exhaustion, and tries to make some sense of the thoughts in his mind. John is the one constant, for five years, the only person who matters, who’s ever mattered. Focus on John, and everything else will fall into place.
“I’m going to have to go in. I can’t withdraw all this from the machine.” John looks Sherlock up and down. “Maybe you should…”
"Yeah, got that bit." Lestrade's eyes narrow. "Now you want to give me something I can actually take to my superiors?"
Crooking himself up on his elbow next to Sherlock's head, John kisses over his jaw, presses his mouth against his pulse. The thump thump of his blood pumping through him is beautiful. John sucks a little, enough to make Sherlock jump and curl a leg up beside John's. Sherlock's hands are running over the backs of his thighs, insistent.
“Alright, then. We’ve got you fed and watered, let’s to bed. You need a good long sleep instead of your typical collapsing at the break of dawn, and I’ll not hear any arguing.”
John’s grin is so wide his cheeks hurt as their shoes crunch along the gravel. They pick their way back out of the tunnel and this time it doesn’t sound sinister like it did on the way in. It sounds like shells on the beach. It sounds like summertime and breezes blowing the curtains in the sitting room at Baker Street and Sherlock draped over his leather chair like a wilted lettuce leaf complaining about the heat. It sounds like a future John never thought he would have.
John laughed loudly and rolled to the side, yanked the blankets unceremoniously from under Sherlock's arse. "Sorry, love. I'm not the most graceful, am I? "
The door to the flat is already open. Mrs Hudson leads them into a cosy sitting room with a fireplace and the two enormous windows he saw from the street, through which grey autumn light is falling over the worn carpet. None of the wall colours match, every floorboard groans as they walk, and the curtains at the windows are stained with soot. It's sparse, not much furniture aside from a sofa and a desk, two worn armchairs facing each other by the fireplace. Everything is shabby. Sherlock is completely in love with it.
John's gaze on him was pure heat. He could feel it, traveling over his chest, up his neck, lingering on his mouth. Sherlock met John's eyes, the air between them electric and thick. He swallowed and averted his gaze, before they gave in and ended up panting and frenetic on the couch, bags still in the car and no food in the kitchen.
He pulled his phone out of his pocket and ignored the slightly disturbing fact that Mycroft hadn’t gotten back to him in the night, and swiped it open.
As he scrubs the scent of tequila from his pores, the faint lingering odor of vomit from his hair, he tries to breathe deeply and let himself be open to this. To raw emotion, to his bare quivering fragile heart set on the table for Sherlock to see. To own. To dissect and parse out it's inner workings. This is true vulnerability, real trust. He's never let anyone see the parts of himself that he doesn't even want to see. He scrubs his hands hard over his face and tries to control the wild thrumming of his heart.
Heat floods through him as John leans over his back and scrapes his teeth over Sherlock's shoulder blade, kisses the nape of his neck, and then sits back up and resumes his drumming.
"Very modern, this, isn't it?" John planted his hands on his hips and surveyed the room. Smooth white walls contrasted with a black cabineted kitchen, concrete slab counters and a glass tiled floor. The fireplace was massive, taking up almost half of the wall opposite the kitchen, grey stones artfully stacked all the way to the ceiling. Leather couches and smoked glass tables crowded around the hearth, just slightly too large for the space. The floors were the only ancient thing visible - wide wooden planks worn uneven by hundreds of years of bare feet and heavy boots - and even that was refinished, sanded and stained, gleaming with layers of polyurethane.
John can barely swallow. Dread is curling icy fingers around his throat. "When you say - this - you mean?"
Sherlock's smile is sad. He closes his eyes and breathes, "Not today. Today I just want this, you. Please. Not today, John. Just let it be enough that I made it through and so did you."
John breaks the kiss, slides down and tucks his head under Sherlock’s chin while he tugs at the two remaining buttons on Sherlock’s pants. Sherlock breathes in through his nose, huffs a breath out through his mouth, and tries not to act as though he’s never done this before.
He averts his gaze before John can catch him staring, and slides his own nightshirt over his head without taking off his pants. His face is on fire. Memories of every half-guilty daydream he’d ever had are rushing into his mind - John’s hands on him, John hard against his belly, John whispering filthy sweet things in his ear. He presses the backs of his hands cool against his cheeks and scrambles under the covers.
“Happy bastards.” John grumbles, well aware of his own jealousy, then catches the closing door with his palm and kicks it open. Might as well get a coffee if he’s going to be stood up. No reason to freeze his bollocks off in the street any longer.
"I'm just going to Scotland Yard, John. I'll be home tonight." Sherlock stuffs his keys in the pocket of his trousers, moves automatically toward John - to hug and kiss him goodbye, smile and murmur l
"God, I haven't been there in thirty years. Not since I was a kid." John stared into the fireplace, warming his hands around his mug. "I guess I'd better start packing. "
“Definitely. I’d end up back in hospital. We wouldn’t want those poor doctors to have to endure another round of righteous anger from Sherlock Holmes. I think you nearly broke them last time.” John closes his mouth around Sherlock’s earlobe and tugs, flicks at it with the tip of his tongue.
"Yes, alright." Sherlock traces patterns on John's hipbone with his index finger. "I always knew, you know. About you. How you felt. Well. I thought I knew. Until Mary."
Sherlock lays his head down again, curls his fingers over the curve of John’s hip. He wastes no time getting to the point. “So, you’re embarrassed about last night. About being the submissive partner.”
“But now I’m here.” Sherlock tried to keep his voice as even as possible, though John’s words sliced into him and burrowed, an ache he knew wouldn’t leave him, no matter how many years they had together. His fault. This was all his fault. John knew it, too, and Sherlock was just waiting for the day when all the seething fury exploded at him.
Sherlock is utterly and irrevocably captivated by this beautiful face, and the dark complexity of the man behind it. Their eyes lock together and it’s immediately high school all over again, trying to impress a cute boy and remember how to
"Oh, thank you, dear. You can set it on the desk there." She follows him across the room to the desk between the windows, which Sherlock realises is really more of a breakfast table. "Just that beef stew and tea. Finally feeling like autumn out, thought you could use some warming up."
He brushes Sherlock’s fringe back from his forehead. “Let me rephrase that. You’re going to get up, and use the loo, and brush your teeth, and take a shower, and have toast and eggs and coffee for breakfast, and you’ll eat what I give you. It’s not a choice.”
John takes the camera into the kitchen and digs a tin opener out of a drawer. "You may be the British government to most people, but to me, you're my annoying brother in law."
"Oh god, Sherlock," John says again, overwhelmed by the suddenness of this conversation. It feels like something they should have prepared for. Something that should have been arranged, had a set date. Known what they were going to talk about and had notes or something. Not something they fell into with no warning on a grey London morning with nothing special at all to distinguish it in their history. It feels like it deserves a blue plaque --
- John sighs and closes his eyes, resigned and fond. After that, they have milk. Sherlock learns to make soap, and cheese.
John lands the first smack over Sherlock's left nipple, the second at the soft skin above his hip. Sherlock grabs at the headboard with his fingers and John is rapt, watching as the tears resume, rolling hot down Sherlock's temples and into his hair. He slaps him again and again until Sherlock's front is as reddened as his back. Until Sherlock's sobbing softly with his eyes shut and his mouth trembling. Until John's own stinging hand and aching arm evidence how long he's been at this.
"Sherlock. Wake up, pet, you need to eat." John drags him up until he's leaning against John's chest. "Come on, Sherlock."
“Hmmm? What?” John blinks at Sherlock and yawns, his cheeks very pink. “Oh. Food. Thanks, Sherlock.”
"God, yes." Sherlock set the glass on the table before he dropped it, his hands were shaking so badly. He stepped forward and ran his hands down John's bare chest, his face scalding hot, breathing through his mouth. He was nothing but desire, shivering pulses of arousal coursing through him, weak with it. He wanted John on top of him, inside him, hands tight around his wrists, that soft wool brushing over his stomach with every thrust of John's cock.
John sighs resignedly, turning his face so he can press his cheek against the crown of Sherlock's head. "Alright, love. I shan't press the issue at the moment. We'll have our tea and retire early tonight, let you rest."
"I don't want you to have to take care of me." John whispered finally, and tucked his face practically in Sherlock's armpit, muffling the end of his sentence.
"I'm really not." John runs one hand into Sherlock's hair, and with the other strokes his fingers down Sherlock's chest, runs them over his flagging erection and down the inside of his thigh. "Now weren't we in the middle of something?"
I hated myself for it even while I was doing it. I should never have left with Mary, I should have sent her away, I should have talked to you, I should have let you talk. I should have gone home with you, to where we became
"Alright. Another day. But - I just - let me - " John shifts again, circles around Sherlock's back, and spreads his legs on either side of Sherlock's hips. Presses his mouth to the cruelest looking scar he sees, ropey and thick, twisting over Sherlock's left shoulder blade. Sherlock shivers and drops his head back, puts his hand on John's knee. John kisses down the whole length of the scar, soothes every uneven nub of ruined flesh with his tongue.
“Very true.” John lifts one limp chip up and lets the gravy drip off before folding it in half and shoving it unceremoniously in his mouth.
He can't get this done fast enough. Sherlock presses a third finger inside him and it burns and he can feel the stretch and -
You were right. And we can’t kiss this away either. I have things I should tell you, things I find really difficult to talk about - “
But John laughs, a tinkling joyful sound that lodges itself somewhere in the vicinity of Sherlock’s heart.
It becomes frantic. John's pulling on his cock so hard it's on the knife's edge of hurting. He must realise it, passes his hand over the head of Sherlock's cock and smoothes precome over his palm and down Sherlock's length. John thickens in Sherlock's hand, and the evidence of John's pleasure sparks heat along Sherlock's nerve endings, the coiled tension in Sherlock's belly spinning wide open. His spine tightens like a bow string, bending him backward, arching into John's hand.
"Good. Now go in our room and take off your clothes and fold them up, and get the parcel on top of the dresser and bring it back here. You have two minutes." As Sherlock jumps up and rushes off to the bedroom to obey, John gets up and locks both doors to the flat. It won't do to have Mrs Hudson walking in during this. They really should put a bed in his old room, away from Mrs Hudson's hearing.
Sherlock tucks himself flush against John's back, so much taller that John fits entirely within the contours of Sherlock's frame. John tilts his head back for a kiss, deep and wet, Sherlock licking across his cheek as his pulls back. "Ready?"
"I most certainly don't. I'm guessing." Sherlock flattened a hand on each of John's thighs and pulled, urging him to spread his knees on either side of Sherlock's hips. The solid weight of John settled across his thighs and stomach, so much heavier than he looked. The hard length of him nudged against Sherlock's navel and they both sucked in a breath, mouths so close they breathed in each other's air.
“You.” My voice was hardly more than a whisper of breath, my throat closing on a thrill of dark desire that pulsed through me as I grazed my fingers down through the wispy hairs at the back of his neck. It always happened this way, my planned seductions always went awry when he touched me, when I touched him.
,” John stands up, leans over the bedside and takes Sherlock’s hand in both of his. He looks a fright, his hair sticking up in unwashed spikes, his skin greasy and pale. He’s clearly been wearing the same clothes for days, they’re stained and creased, his jeans yellowed with dirt. But he’s smiling, and his tired, bloodshot eyes are brimming with relief and happiness. He reaches out and presses the red call button next to Sherlock’s head. “Need the doctor to come and evaluate you. But I’m not going anywhere. Promise.”
"Sherlock, I can't...that's so. Silly. I can't. I can't imagine myself doing that." John scratched at The Beard with the fingers of his left hand, his dominant hand. Sherlock had observed he scratched it with his non-dominant right hand approximately 77% of the time. He scratched with his left when he was uncomfortable or nervous, as he was now.
against John’s neck and then John’s hands were stealthily untucking Sherlock’s shirt, and they were laughing wildly, leaving the front door hanging completely open and they tripped their way up the steps holding hands, and barely made it to the bedroom.
“You are a marvel.” John thought he’d never loved Sherlock so much as he did in that moment. “I want to give you whatever you want and need, too, you know.”
The conversation with Sergeant Lestrade plays over in his mind on the lift to the floor where John is. Lestrade wasn’t overly brilliant, but very thorough, and definitely didn’t buy Sherlock’s story about being from the Cotswolds. He had too much of the wary city boy about him, the track marks on his arms obvious in his short sleeved tee shirt. Sherlock got the feeling Lestrade hadn’t bought much of what Sherlock had told him, his eyes continuously flicking to the track marks, his sunken eyes.
He pushes Sherlock against the wall as he moves past, taking his gun in both hands as he spins deftly around the corner into the adjoining alley. Immediately it’s blackness, no streetlamps in this dank little corridor. He’s got no time to let his eyes adjust before searing pain explodes across the backs of his eyelids and he vaguely registers the clatter of his gun falling from his hand onto the pavement. He tries to stutter out Sherlock’s name as he sinks down the wall, but his mouth won’t cooperate.
Sherlock shuts his eyes, rubs his hand in a slow circle against the crown of John’s head, musses his hair. His face is
John laughs, throwing his head back and looking inexplicably delighted that Sherlock is so clueless. He throws Sherlock a sideways glance and shakes his head. “I’ve never met anyone here who
Sherlock couldn’t find the words to reply; just turned his head and smeared his mouth against John’s, tongues sliding against each other, tasting himself on John’s lips. John rolled his hips just a little, and it was just enough friction to curve Sherlock's spine up off the bed like he'd been electrocuted, shoulders shaking as his hands slapped down onto John’s back with a crack, and John’s back arched concave, pushing their groins together even closer. Sherlock didn’t even feel John reaching down between their entwined bodies, but then he was there, pushing a slicked finger into him and groaning
They’re absurdly late to Scotland Yard. They don't care. Their eyes meet over their entwined hands on the cab bench, and they silently watch one another sip their coffees. It feels like the first day they've been reunited, the first real day since Sherlock came home, and nothing else matters but this.
“Apologies for interrupting the proceedings. But it’s rather hot under there.” He grins and kneels up, peeling his nightshirt from his body and tossing it carelessly on the floor.
John hums around his fingers and bends his leg, rubs his shin against the Sherlock, the underside of his balls, pressing the hard bone into his perineum. Electricity surges through Sherlock, arse muscles clenching, his shoulders rolling forward. Exhales a long breath, pulls his saliva soaked fingers out of John's mouth. "Christ, John. You're...I've never...it's never been like this."
All of existence, time, space, everything, has coalesced down to this. John's head is deliciously heavy, his mind uncluttered. There is nothing outside of his cock buried deep inside this beautiful creature laid out before him, the sound of their breath, their high pitched gasps, the smell of their sweat mingling with fresh leather and the tang of metal fittings. Nothing outside of his fingers trying to keep a grip on Sherlock's sweat slicked skin while he thrusts into him.
John kneels at the edge, between Sherlock’s spread legs, and pulls his shirt off over his head, throws it carelessly on the floor, and bends down over Sherlock, licking his mouth open and fumbling at the hem of his tee shirt. “Want you inside me. So bad.”
“Yeah…..it is. Hey, cutie.” He slithered over to the car and leaned in the passenger window. God, but he did look so much like Sherlock. The same cheekbones, not quite as visible as Sherlock’s, but the same. His eyes were the translucent blue that Sherlock’s were only in the morning, the colour John saw across the table when they were reading newspapers and eating soft boiled eggs. The colour John had always been sure he’d see staring at him across a pillow one blissful morning, and he would have whispered, “Well, good morning, sweetheart.”
John standing silhouetted against the front window, waiting for the police to come and take them away.
Sherlock lifted his hips once, experimentally, and John bucked wildly, a throaty growl tearing out of him. He released Sherlock's hands and fell forward over him, mouthing and nipping wetly at his throat, licking at his collarbone and his jaw. Sherlock pressed his feet into the mattress and thrust up firmly. John writhed against him and bit into his shoulder, gasping out desperate little whines.
“Alchemy! You’re breaking skin,” he mutters, reaching into the collar of his jacket to poke at the fat white rat curled up underneath.
They leave the table cluttered with drinks and balled up napkins, and quickly slip outside. There’s a cab waiting, the driver clearly one of Mycroft’s people. They duck in the back and cautiously make their way home, thighs pressed together, Sherlock’s right foot tucked behind John’s left ankle. Sherlock doesn’t say a word on the ride, his head tipped forward against the window, hands tented under his nose.
“To you getting me here in one piece.” John clinks his glass against Sherlock’s and they both sip, watching each other over the rims of their glasses. “We make a good team, you and I.”
They walk down to the edge of the lake and John stoops to pick up a flat rock, skip it across the surface. Sherlock watches the ripples spreading out, disappearing into stillness. They stand in silence for long minutes, though it doesn’t feel in the least awkward.
"What on earth is that?" His voice sounded funny upside down, like he had cotton stuffed in his ears.
“Noon. Guess I needed more sleep.” He pulls the dressing gown around him and grins. "I missed you. Your dirty dressing gown seemed like the best substitute."
He’d taken him to a hotel and fucked him so hard he had bruises for days. After that, they had a standing arrangement for a couple months, but then the guy disappeared. That’s what drug addicted prostitutes do, generally. John had found others, none as close to resembling Sherlock as the first one, but close enough. One particularly lovely one had hair that was too long to be believable. John had paid him fifty extra quid just to let him cut his hair.
I've been crying, you complete fuckwit," John says, yanking him back down to hold him again, his fingers slipping up into Sherlock's hair and pulling. "I woke up, and you were gone, and you leave me this fucking cryptic note, and I have no way to call you or find you. I've been going absolutely spare for the last three hours. What the fuck were you thinking?"
Sherlock does actually turn off his phone, which is unprecedented. He slips it in his back pocket and watches Soldier Boy maneuver his way to the bar, hips swaying suggestively, and deftly duck under the open end. He starts refilling his tray with empty glasses, quick and efficient, his tongue tucked between his teeth. His blonde head bobs from side to side in time with the poppy beat of the current song, but his face is serious. This is a job for him, this isn’t entertainment.
Of course, it was broken. Stopped the moment it hit the ground. The glass cracked but intact, the time clearly visible. 8:13am. So John could see for the rest of his life the exact moment that he failed to save the only person he ever really loved. Tangible guilt.
"I - we haven't really - the moment was never right - and - " Sherlock's voice is shaking, and John hates how he sounds ashamed.
John had laughed aloud and burrowed under the duvet, relieved that they seemed to just be carrying on as before. He laid in bed texting Sherlock until his body screamed at him that he needed a piss and a long hot shower.
“She didn’t really have a choice.” Lestrade’s hard voice sounds from the hallway, and Mrs Hudson steps back to let him through the door of 221B. He looks around the flat, nods at John brusquely, and then looks unforgivingly at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes shift up to meet John’s. He looks at him through his thick black lashes, his expression so soft he looks nearly blurred, like a watercolour painting. He’s all golden pink in the dim light of the sitting room. All softness, gentle and sweet. Comforting. No one but John gets to see him this way.
“Nor I.” Sherlock flips back around and snatches his phone up. “Alright, they got on. I’ll let Mycroft -”
Sherlock lets his legs fall open and John rolls to the side, pulling Sherlock to him in one smooth motion. Sherlock sighs and wriggles and sighs again and tucks his sweaty hair under John's chin and twines his left arm over John's stomach and John's left arm goes behind Sherlock's shoulders so he can put his hand in those curls and twist them idly round his fingers.
to. You died once without knowing, and I can’t - not again. Forgive me.” John’s words tumble directly into Sherlock’s mouth, their lips resting against each other in not-yet-a-kiss.
Sherlock let out a long exhalation, shivered. He looked up from his arm and met John’s eyes. John’s cock stirred at the fire in them. Sherlock was absolutely burning for this, whether he was hard yet or not. “Yes, John. Cut me, make me bleed. I want you to.”
The parcel arrived on a Wednesday night. John was out for a rare pint with Stamford, and Sherlock was bored stiff without him. He'd already gone through the fridge and thrown out the body parts that had gone off, rearranged their dresser both by colour and season (thus Sherlock's magenta lambswool socks were now nestled tidily next to John's plum coloured jumper with the leather elbow patches, and John's bright lemon chambray button down was shouldered beside Sherlock's favourite pale yellow pyjama shirt), and gotten into several lively arguments with commenters on John's blog. Those would probably earn him John's sternest furrowed brow and an exasperated
The hives go by the cliff edge. Sherlock plants clover and buckwheat, goldenrod and wild strawberries.
Sherlock can’t stop watching John’s pulse thumping in his neck, how red his ears have gotten. He’s never seen John fully aroused before today. He’s seen the
it, and he breaks eye contact, casting his gaze down to the flagstone path. He watches John push a pebble around in circles with the toe of his shoe.
“Um, I was told to call you. Tell you that you should meet him - us - in Bemidji tomorrow afternoon. There’s a bit of a storm brewing here, he said. Change of plans from what’s in your package.” Stuttering little voice. Pathetic. Annoying. The kind of man that had his head held in toilets in grade school, that would still get his nose broken just for being a pussy. It radiated off of him, even over the phone.
“Because…” John was starting to shake, his voice trembling terribly. “Because they...I found ones that looked like you.”
much to not be deliberate, and crawls onto it slowly, nudging Sherlock over onto his back and straddling his legs. He’s not hard anymore, not really, stopping to build the fire has slowed down the heat that was building between them. Sherlock doesn’t care. John’s weight on his thighs is the most perfect thing he’s ever felt.
“I’ve never seen you do this before.” John’s always pulling out something new, showing Sherlock a new side of him, something Sherlock never expects. Last week, during a particularly frustrating chase, it was karate. Suddenly John was posing and kicking in a way that was nearly comical if it hadn’t been so puzzling, and then so effective, as John cut down the person they’d been chasing with one swift kick, whipped his arms behind his back, and pinned him to the pavement until Greg arrived with handcuffs.
“Yeah, Lester, they will. You need to throw the fucking thing in a river, burn it with hydrochloric acid first, get rid of your fingerprints on it, make it unidentifiable. Frame someone else, put it in
Sherlock had run half a dozen times in the early morning to the loo down the hallway from John's room to vomit viciously, his throat scraped raw, eyes feeling like they were bursting from their sockets. John awake every time he came back, watching him with gentle eyes, mouthing a silent
“It does indeed, doctor.” Sherlock craned his neck, trying to peer into one of the rooms off the entry hall.
"Many subs are referred to as slaves. Agreed upon by both parties, and entered into willingly, but."
"You're going to be insufferable with this, aren't you?" Sherlock groans, allowing himself to be flipped roughly on his back, as John crawls up to press their mouths together.
Rather than just sit there and wait, Sherlock makes his way down to the field and hangs at the edge, waiting for the balls to be put back in their crate. Two other players carry the crate off and John finally turns to Sherlock, slinging his broom over his shoulder as he approaches.
Sherlock knew some things. He about rugby, and the girls John had taken to dances. He knew about the first time John had kissed a boy. Phillip Rydinger, in sixth form. Sherlock knew some things, certainly, but not nearly enough.
Somehow both pants and nightshirt get removed and Sherlock finds himself naked and surprisingly unembarrassed about it. He always thought he’d be self conscious, that being naked with another person would be terrifying. But it’s not at all. It feels...oddly normal. Because it’s
Finally John rolled onto his back and pulled Sherlock over to rest against his side. His fingertips traced patterns drowsily over Sherlock’s back, turned his head every few minutes to kiss Sherlock’s sweaty hair. Sherlock loved this part, the after, their limbs sticky and tangled, heavy with blood flowing back into them, their heads blissfully clear for a little while. Eventually John stumbled into the bathroom and came back with a washed face and a wet towel, wiped Sherlock off, and pulled his pants back on. He climbed back into bed and spooned up behind Sherlock, gathering him to his chest, and rubbed his face into his shoulders.
“I want to go home.” The intent is clear, as he trails his fingers down Sherlock’s long neck, leans forward to rub his lips along the length of his collarbone.
Sherlock sank against John’s thigh, rubbed a hand over the bulge in his jeans, began kissing over his hip. He was making little cat-like noises and insinuating his fingers between John’s legs. A shudder of arousal rippled down John’s entire body, making his head light.
John’s eyes are still sleep-soft, half closed. He’s got one long eyelash stuck in the corner of his eye, making him blink. He touches the pad of his thumb to Sherlock’s lower lip. “Did Lestrade…?”
"Paying attention now, aren't you?" John rolls on his back and pinches at Sherlock's side. He taps his knuckles down over the outside of Sherlock's thigh and rolls his neck. "I used to be able to play the percussion part of this song. I was a pretty good drummer in my day. I should get a drum set, annoy the shit out of you when you're in your Mind Palace."
? It’s an absurd thought, and Sherlock feels somehow like he shouldn’t be as pleased about it as he is. He
been able to resist John when they were both drunk, and that was only because he'd been naively oblivious to John's overtures.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock props himself up on his elbow and looks down at John, his own eyes glistening at the corners. He kisses John’s cheek, his nose, his mouth. “Of course it was worth it. Though I daresay we could have made it easier on ourselves if we weren’t both such idiots.”
John snorted a laugh. He could break this shitbag in two. No reason to pick a fight on a plane when they were landing in minutes. He'd tear him a new one once they were safely in the airport.
“In a manner of speaking.” He locked eyes with the man, and saw empathy there. From another person who’d had a shitty life.
He had picked up the slipper, still stuffed with cigarettes. He’d rolled it in his hands for a while, smelled them unlit. His body had a visceral reaction to the smell of them, as if he’d just tucked his nose under Sherlock’s jaw. He felt calmer, less constricted with misery, just smelling them.
His entire body was taut with it. This wasn’t the laughing John, sitting back in his chair with his feet glancing off of Sherlock’s ankles as they watched the fire together. This wasn't the John yelling at him with half a smile on his face about thumbs in the fridge, or takeaway containers all over the flat. This wasn’t even the John standing solid and strong with a gun at the end of his arm. The John who was still and reserved in his anger. This wasn’t the soldier.
"I don't, no. Well spotted, love. I'm off to locate the log pile." John slid the paneled door open and slipped out back. "Well, give a shout if you need help."
Sherlock twists, stomach tight and arms shaking, to hold John closer. He throws a leg over John’s hip so their bellies are flush together with John’s arm between Sherlock’s legs, the heel of his hand pressing deliciously against Sherlock’s testicles. Everything below his waist is hot, amorphous. Spreading. He feels like they’re melding into each other, John’s body indistinguishable from his own. He tightens his arms, John’s laughing mouth against his throat.
“I’m not going anywhere, John. Never again. We’re going to make this right. Together.” Sherlock continued rubbing his arm, tucked his face into the top of John’s head. “Get some rest, you’re a disaster.”
Sherlock laughs against his back and rubs his lips sweetly over John’s nape for not even close to long enough. “Yes, I quite agree.”
“Don’t.” John says fiercely, breathing out hard through his nose. “Just let me have this. Let me have
"Excuse the hubris, but I sorta figured." John trails his fingertips up and down the outside of Sherlock's upper arm, unable to stop touching him after the week's draught they've just endured.
"Really?" John half laughed, and then stopped at the look on Sherlock's face. "Oh. Oh, you really do."
John Watson to get angry, to have a tantrum. You just control. Everything and everyone. Yourself, me, Greg, your fucking sister you never even allow to come to London and visit because she potentially might temporarily embarrass you. Has it ever occurred to you that you're not everyone's damn
John slips his hand into Sherlock’s, fingers entwined, and it’s a comfortable silence on the way across Tower Bridge, swinging their arms and ignoring the steady drizzle wetting their hair. They make their way down to the abandoned tube station, and Sherlock throws back the canvases.
Sherlock handed John his pack of cigarettes and lighter. Watched him as he lit it and took a deep drag, breathed it out into the frigid air. The air was so dense it was like a wall, and the smoke hit it, doubling back and forming a cloud around John’s head. He waved it away, looking sickened, and threw the rest of the cigarette out the window.
Sherlock’s eyes fall shut and he swallows hard, his esophagus moving under John’s fingers. “You are. Just in a different way.”
?” He angles his hips down and back, pulling halfway out, and then thrusting in shallowly so that the head of his cock nudges against Sherlock’s prostate.
The sun's high, hazy behind what has become a typically cloudy grey London sky before John and Sherlock make any attempt to rouse themselves from the river walk. Tourists gathering, milling around and calling Tower Bridge
Sherlock laughs and reaches up to run his fingers through John's hair, cup the back of his head in his hand. "You really want to hear about bees, John?"
John’s chilly, goosebumps rising along his forearms as Sherlock winds a hand over the arm laying over his belly. John’s other arm around his back, hands clasped above his right hip. His entire torso turned toward Sherlock, chest pressed against his side.
Sherlock's skin is blood hot under John's hands, his eyes fixed intently on John's face as he holds himself perfectly still. John slips his dog tags over Sherlock's head and sets them on the side table. He does up the buckle of the collar, spins it round Sherlock's neck gently so the ring is at his throat. He's a vision. A porcelain doll. The dark green against his pale skin, his black curls brushing the top, make him look like a debauched Victorian painting.
The three of them share a quiet tea. Mrs Hudson clatters on about neighbours and her sister, as usual. John steals searching glances at Sherlock when he thinks he isn’t looking. Sherlock, for his part, uses the silence to try and parse out what’s going on. Allows his mind to stretch a bit. The most rational explanation is that this is a hallucination, or perhaps a vivid dream. Maybe he’s got a fever. In his mind palace, he’s had sequences that
“Nor I, John.” Sherlock’s voice wavers, breaks with a quiet intensity that makes John tilt his head back enough to look into those changeable green eyes.
Sherlock lapped at the slit until John was moaning brokenly and rhythmically squeezing Sherlock’s hand around his bollocks. He opened his eyes at the crimson flush of John’s arousal over his belly, at his open mouth and his half shut eyes, his red tongue darting across his lips as he panted. The sight of John like this always made Sherlock both proud and hungry for more, hungry to make John out of his mind with pleasure, to sink down into John and forget that anything existed beyond the feeling of John’s sweaty skin against him and the sound of John’s throaty groans in his ear.
Ginger looked him up and down briefly, considering. “Yeah, alright. But you’ll stay well out of the way - you’re not in London and I don’t give a sheep’s tit what you do at Scotland Yard, yeah?”
They'd been teasing each other ever since they'd settled in, a delicious slow burn building between them. When they'd first gotten together, this kind of lingering arousal was impossible to maintain, the frantic hunger they'd repressed for so long had been too powerful to resist. Every kiss had turned into grinding hips and groping hands immediately, getting each other off as quickly as possible in all manner of inappropriate places. It had been months before they could take their time, before they had the patience to spend hours in bed exploring each other.
Sherlock thinks of the pipe in the sitting room, of how many times they’ve almost lost each other, and how easy and right this feels now. John’s fingers curl into his hair and they kiss softly for a few minutes.
Sherlock swallows and stammers, defaulting to that rapid blinking that John always thinks of as his brain clicking through files, trying to find the most applicable one for the current situation. “Yes. I mean. I assumed as much. I know that you
it. You love controlling me. You love doing it in public, showing me off, how well I listen, how good I am for you, and only you. How you’ve
John considers Sherlock for a long moment, how much he's aged, how different he is. He's become both stronger and softer, a warmth and openness in his eyes that John had only caught glimpses of before. He smiles more easily, doesn't try to couch his emotions in sarcasm all the time.
“You would like that? If I pulled your hair?” Sherlock pants out the words, and as John nods as much as he can with his mouth otherwise occupied, Sherlock does pull, twisting his fingers and yanking until John’s eyes are watering. “Good?”
“We don’t have anything out here, sweetness.” John lifted my hand to his mouth, unhurriedly brushing his kiss-swollen lips over my knuckles and looking up at me from underneath those surprisingly delicate long honey-coloured eyelashes.
"That you're the most important man in the country and you could have me killed with a snap of your fingers? You don't scare me, Mycroft."
John rose off the couch, clenching a little around the warm silicone plug. Sherlock was still kneeling on the floor. He wrapped his arms around John’s thighs as he stood up, nosed into his hip, sniffing at him, then slid a hand up and over the crease of his arse. His fingers delved in, even under the thick denim of John’s jeans, he could feel the flared base of the plug. He ran his fingers over the bump of it and he shivered against John’s leg. “Oh, god, John. How long have you had that inside you?”
Outside, just beyond the perimeter of the cctv cameras that ring the Diogenes Club, Lorne Malvo lowers his binoculars from his eyes and puts his sunglasses back on. He walks away, hands clasped behind his back and eyes upturned to the skyline, looking like any other American tourist.
How sorry I am about that night, when you came back. How much I cocked it up, all the mistakes I made.
Sherlock stands, stretches, sweeps coins and bills off the pavement and into his pocket. John’s eyes on him. Sherlock gives him an eyeful, a sliver of pale hard tummy, watches what he does. Nothing. His eyes don't even flicker down, just watches Sherlock's face. Disappointing.
“I love you. Beyond reason, beyond measure.” John’s teeth scrape lightly over Sherlock’s pulse in his wrist. “I love you so much I can hardly bear it.”
John drains his glass, promising himself he’ll say nothing to Sherlock about this revelation. Sherlock would take it all wrong and mostly personally, would think John was unhappy with him, unhappy with their life. No, I'm not unhappy, he thinks. Far from it. I'm just tired, and ready for a different adventure. Something that involves fewer thumps on the head and is lacking entirely in bloated corpses. He rinses the glass and put it quietly back in the cupboard before returning to bed.
it. I can feel how badly you want everything I'm going to do to you. God, you're amazing. What a little tart. So desperate for it."
“What the hell for? Thinking is sort of your definitive characteristic.” John climbs over Sherlock’s legs and settles back down under the blankets. He smiles slow and darts his tongue out to wet his lower lip. “We have some time, you know.”
"Do you - not like it?" This certainly wasn't what Sherlock had in mind when he booked the place, but it suited his aesthetic. John, though. Renovated spaces like this usually sent his nose wrinkling and unleashed a steady stream of mutterings of
Sherlock laughs, the intensity breaking, nuzzles heavily into the sweet hollow beneath that perfectly square jaw. “Scared of a thunderstorm, John? I’ll keep you safe, poor baby.”
Sherlock finds it’s remarkably easy to forget he’s never done this before, as he allows his legs to fall open again, while John reaches over him to dip two fingers in the tin. He bears down this time, wills his body to open to John’s touch. He can feel himself contract and loosen as John presses up inside him again, two fingers first and then again
“I know, darling.” John tried to shut down his own arousal for a moment and focus on Sherlock. He counted down from ten to one, willing himself to stop thinking about the sweet throbbing in his arse, the tingling in his belly.  “It is for me, too. I’m not acquiescing just to please you. I admit I do that plenty, but this isn’t one those times. Are you concerned about hurting me?”
Sherlock kisses down his spine, becoming utterly lost in the sensation of each one of John’s muscles vibrating and tensing under his mouth. He gets stuck halfway, licking and sucking at the perfect dip where John’s rib cage gives way to his waist, forgetting what he’s doing, until John’s writhing under him and moaning
this? I thought I’d -” He swallows as his hands close around the metal, warm from Sherlock’s body heat. “I thought I’d tossed it. No, I
John with his bright eyes and his shining smile that he smiles with his whole face with his body, like his heart is beaming right through his skin and his pores and the ends his golden hair. John who loved him the moment they met and who has given him soft kisses and words no one else ever has and everything Sherlock never knew he was missing until three days ago. John who makes everything awful seem less so.
Though his heart gives a leap at John leaving open the possibility of “round two,” Sherlock ignores that for the moment, in favour of more practical questions. “I was actually thinking we need to get cleaned up. Because I don’t know about you, but…”
"I really didn't get that before, you know. I really didn't. Thank you. Thank you for helping me understand why you need this." This is so easy, now that they're doing it, talking, really talking. So easy to be honest. Why did he think this was so difficult?
"Boring old man." Sherlock groused, without any real rancour, and flounced off the bed as John yanked the covers back over himself. "I'm getting up."
“I know, John. I feel the same. But you’re very injured, and as you so succinctly pointed out, we have a lot to discuss.” Sherlock swept his lips over John’s brow and smiled in what he hoped was a comforting way. “Besides, I really do need to use that loo.”
Sherlock grins back, full to bursting with complicated undefinable emotions, and follows John back out into the crowded club. He finds an empty spot at the back wall, where he can watch John as he goes behind the bar and retrieves the shot tray, returns to the dance floor. John’s eyes find his many times through the rest of the night, connected to each other as surely as if they’re physically touching. Sherlock’s the last person there, the stragglers filing out through the front door as the lights come up and the servers begin clearing tables and sweeping discarded napkins and broken glass into piles.
Sherlock’s still standing awkwardly in the kitchen, cigarettes clutched in one hand, the coffee mug warm in the other. He’s not used to this, experiencing other people’s intimacy. He doesn’t know where to look. He doesn't know what to
If John just closed his eyes, breathed in. Got lost in time for a moment, let himself pretend that they were just coming home from a holiday in the countryside, that they'd been away from Baker Street for a long weekend. Wet concrete, the faint odor of rubbish from the bins in the alley, bacon cooking and coffee brewing. Familiar. Achingly familiar. He had never planned to stand on Baker Street again, surrounded by memories so visceral that they had weight and density. Surrounded again by the life he and Sherlock had made. Made and then abandoned, the remnants of it like a cancer eating away at him every day for two years.
John’s sturdy legs curl around Sherlock’s hips, his ankles crossed against the small of Sherlock’s back. The heels of his heavy boots dig in, pushing Sherlock closer, his muscular thighs clenching and drawing their bodies as tightly together as possible. The room fills with their mingled sighs and grunts, gentle moans and hoarse breaths rising into the unfinished ceiling, echoing into the empty corners. They move together for what feels like hours, time suspended, Sherlock lost in the grind of John’s arse against him, the squeeze and release of his thighs as he arches up off the counter to meet Sherlock’s every thrust.
horrible chair. Just the musty smell of it was a salve on his raw nerves. He closed his eyes and leaned back, listening to it creak and complain.
Sherlock has cleaned off the table, all his chemistry equipment set carefully on the floor just inside the sitting room. Sherlock pours them each a half glass of wine, dark red and thick, sweet, not a dry merlot at all. It smells of cherries and chocolate and just the scent of it makes John heady. The lasagna isn’t hot anymore, but it’s delicious nonetheless - spicy and rich, thick slices of aubergine and zucchini slathered in ricotta and chunky homemade tomato sauce. It’s heavenly.
John stirred, grumbling softly, but didn't wake. Sherlock dared to put his tongue to the warm fabric. Salty and musty sweet, alcohol from the night before escaping through John's pores. Sherlock licked his lips, his heartbeat picking up. Tucking chilly fingers carefully into the waistband of John’s boxers, he slowly worked them down over his hips. John’s legs shifted and then stilled, tensing. The lip of the blanket lifted up and there was John’s sleepy face staring down at him in surprise.
tell me to calm down.” Sherlock points a long shaking finger at him. “I have failed to solve a case for the first time, and it’s because you made me leave. This is
John snorts a laugh, searching for the guilt he certainly should be feeling about cheating on his girlfriend. He finds that guilt to be in startlingly short supply. “I’m not, actually. You interrupted that bit. Remember?”
They stay there, kissing gently, reverently, until the snow gets heavier and the wind picks up. Then, turning up their collars against the cold, and twining their fingers together once again, they set off. To the coffee shop. To wherever the night - and the rest of their lives - leads them.
“Mrs Hudson should be up with our tea any moment, and then straight to bed with you. We can discuss the case with Lestrade tomorrow, it’ll keep.”
“You want to come while I’m inside you?” John leaned over Sherlock, his eyes hooded and black, mouth wet and shining in the wavering firelight.
He also knew, from his own experiences, that long repressed emotions were unpredictable once they rose to the surface. They could make a person do things he wouldn’t normally do - such as help plan a wedding that was actually breaking his heart in pieces, or make unforgivable mistakes in deductions that led to tragic outcomes - Sherlock shook his head to break that train of thought, and realised he was still standing stock still whilst John had made his way halfway down the hill.
“Mmmm,” Mike looks up at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye and grins. He’s got a mischievous glint as he says, “Gryffindor and Ravenclaw are having a scrimmage this morning, practicing before the official season starts and all. Thought I might go down and watch. You could come with me. If you wanted to.”
Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s hips and buries his face in his lap. Doesn't reply with his typical
John moves the ring of his fingers in counterpoint to his mouth, and Sherlock jerks forward with a gasp. John slides his hand around to squeeze at Sherlock’s arse, run his hand down his thigh, and feel his muscles gone all tense and trembling. He pulls off, and Sherlock whines in protest. “I’m not going to stop. Just, it’s okay if you. If you want to come, like this, it’s fine, it’s good.”
It wasn't until they were halfway to Ella's office that John asked Sherlock about the meeting with Mycroft. John didn't look away from the window as he spoke. He too mesmerised by London. He wanted to drink in every postbox and stoplight, every Pret a Manger and Brookstone's, every single overflowing bin, every mundane damn thing that he'd never even bothered noticing before. The whole goddamned city was gorgeous to him. He hadn't realised how desperately homesick he was until he was back.
“Mmm. Not for a long while.” He stretched and sighed, and then finally separated himself from me. He stood, and I heard the distinctive slap of his hands on his stomach as he yawned. “We should -”
Dinner is quiet. Shy glances across the table, tentative smiles. A week of virtual silence has made them both unsure of how to behave, and the apprehension about the conversation that's soon to follow is looming over them. John keeps almost taking Sherlock's hand, then retracting, unsure of whether he can yet or not.
John's arm slides around his hips, his head on Sherlock's shoulder. The rain slips silently down the window. It's too perfect.
John pulls them both into a long warm shower. Sherlock is as loose limbed as a sleeping child. John lets Sherlock use him for support, draping his long body over John's small frame while John washes him gently with a soapy cloth and then wraps him in a clean towel.
They emerge into the cool night, wind whipping off the river, the lights along the river blooming coils of fire in Sherlock’s vision. The bridge looms above them, pinnacles piercing into the bright white moon above. John throws the canvases back in place, lays the wooden planks across them.
into his arm. His lips no longer blue, but not their normal red either. His eyes are closed. There’s so much blood. It’s everywhere. The paramedics opened his shirt to put the bandage on, a huge smear of blood across his lower belly
"Deeper baby, I want you so deep inside me," John wraps his hand, just barely large enough to fit, around both of them, and gives a long firm pull that sends waves of heat spiraling through his nerves. Sherlock jerks and gasps, sinks his teeth into John’s jaw, presses his fingers deeper until the knuckles of his hand are hard against John's arse. John works their cocks faster, knowing exactly how Sherlock likes it, stroking from base to tip and twisting just that much at the head.
“Alright, love?” John nudges at the side of Sherlock’s face with his own, slips his hand from under Sherlock’s nightshirt and instead pets soothingly down the length of his arm.
.” John’s voice catches meaningfully on the last word, his eyes blazing with all the worries they aren’t voicing, all the fears they refuse to give name to.
thing to say, but it doesn’t seem to matter to John, whose eyes soften and crinkle at the corners, and Sherlock loves him even more than he did just a second before.
