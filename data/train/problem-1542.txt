Sherlock circles both arms around John's waist. "Tell me again that nothing bad can happen to us here."
“I’m here,” he shushes him gently. “I’m here, sweetheart. And you’re here, and we’re both safe. Please don’t cry.”
Molly’s mouth hangs open as she slowly pulls her scalpel from the corpse and sets it onto the tray. “Hold on. Let’s back up. John told you he’s in love with you?”
The vulnerability of Sherlock's words—of this entire moment—sets John’s heart off dancing. He begins to realise the intimacy they’ve become encased in. Sherlock gazes at him expectantly as John holds his head in his hands, their faces inches apart.
Irene. John can hardly believe their good fortune; how easy it was to find their whereabouts. For a moment, he wonders if the girl in the casino actually slapped him to death, and he’s in another life. Or if he’s asleep, and dreaming again, only Sherlock hasn’t made his appearance yet.
Sarah nods. “I’ve got a car. I can take you. It shouldn’t be much more than a half hour in traffic.”
He sighs. As nice as she seems, she’s not the one he wants to be talking to right now. As she sits down in the seat next to him, he looks over her shoulder wistfully at William, who appears to be doing what he does best: ignoring his very existence.
Sherlock uncrosses his arms, flopping them down to his sides. "Then I'll ask you one more time. John, what on earth has gotten into you?"
What does it even mean—to make love? Sex and love, love and sex: one or the other, or both. Or for some people—Sherlock among them—neither.
Eventually, John becomes fully awake. He’s dizzy and slightly nauseous and he's got no idea how much time has passed. But although the world is a bit swirly, he sees Sherlock sitting next to him.
Right now is all that matters. Right now, they’re safe in the backseat of a borrowed limousine, and Sherlock is in John’s lap, clutching onto his shoulders and kissing him desperately. He licks into his mouth, bears down onto him, only coming up for ragged breaths and needy whimpers.
"Have you got any phobias?" Sherlock asks on Wednesday, while sharing his bed with John. "I mean, obviously, you're
John decides to humour her, but he makes her something resembling coffee from an oddly-shaped pouch and a clunky machine in the corner of their room. She kicks off her shoes, curls up onto the side of the bed and thanks him.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says, even though he and Molly can no longer be friends. "Apparently only a genius can understand the—“
John bends forwards a bit, meeting his eyes. His pupils are wide and dark, and his pulse is pounding wildly. "It's sexy as hell, Sherlock. And very, very distracting."
Next up: (probably not) Ghosts. A game of Never Have I Ever. John learns something about Sherlock’s past; boo! Surprise jealousy 👻
"Oh! Oh, no." Molly gasps, nearly flailing her scalpel into the air. "It wasn't sex between you two! More than that...it was a
She chuckles softly, pulls away from him, and peers into his eyes, unblinking. “You’re very quick to speak for him, love. But I’ve known him far longer than you have.”
His thoughts are interrupted when Gabriela—in six-inch stiletto boots and a cropped tie-front blouse—approaches them.
“God, god, god, John,” William chants over and over as he begins to erupt into his own hand. A pulsing wave seems to shoot through his entire body. It begins near the leaping pulse point at his neck, flows through his chest, his trembling abdomen, all the way down to his curled toes.
“I can’t reveal the exact location,” Lestrade responds. “But we’re heading closer to the base. You’ll be under top-tier surveillance while we determine the next step.”
He deletes it. He opens his photo album and goes through picture after picture of Sarah. Delete. Pictures of the two of them together. Delete, delete, delete.
Whatever. He’s tremendously exhausted. So as he dozes off, he tells himself that tonight he can ignore the bizarre events of the evening, and it will all still be there for him tomorrow.
At nine o’clock sharp, John watches Irene walk in through the entrance of the hotel. He barely recognises her. If it weren’t for her scarlet lips and raven-coloured hair, she may have gone right past him, unnoticed. She wears designer shades on her face, and her hair is swept off her neck into a high bun. Rather than her typical corset, she’s in a simple red dress and sheer black stockings.
The two men hold on to each other as they stand, their hearts pounding like two timpani. Sherlock tries to balance himself, but it proves premature—the world is dizzying, and the ground wobbles, and the blood screams in his ears.
He pulls John's hand away, his voice fraught with disapproval. “Seagram’s? Really, John? If you want to kill us both, a liter of petrol would taste better.”
Irene sinks back into the sofa, pulling Gabriela down with her. She sighs with resignation, curling their bodies together. “I suppose I’m outnumbered. Go on, then.”
“Whatever feels natural, I suppose.” John is certainly not exhibiting any signs of intoxication or insanity. “But it’s alright, Sherlock. A response isn’t mandatory.”
“I don’t understand,” John says aloud to nobody in particular—a clear sign he’s going mad. “Who is Sherlock?”
"Well, not the entire time.” Sherlock rubs the sleepiness from his eyes. “I stepped away briefly to use the facilities and to acquire food. But otherwise, yes. You saved my life; I wasn’t going to leave you here.”
Sherlock’s arm sprawls beneath John’s head like a pillow. John traces the hair below Sherlock’s navel with his forefinger; Sherlock traces the hair on John’s head with his.
John circles his arms around Sherlock and rests his chin on top of his head. “I like you the most, too.”
Sherlock kisses him firmly. He needs John to shut up this very instant. Because his voice and his words—they're doing too much to him. They’re far too overwhelming alongside whatever this feeling is.
Sherlock doesn’t understand any of it, really. He doesn’t understand why there are no discussions about it, and he especially doesn’t understand why they kiss all day and go to their separate beds at night.
So he immerses himself in his studies. Buries himself in the familiar: lateral ventricles. Cochlear ducts. Pericardial cavities. The taste of William’s tongue sliding into his mouth.
John supposes it must be true, in some capacity—Molly does, in fact, know William far better than he does. All John knows about him is the smoothness of his bare skin. And the way the scent of his aftershave mixes with the scent of their sweaty bodies. And the desperate little noises he makes when he comes up for air between kisses.
John tries to imagine what it must be like to watch someone you care for descend into madness, and to lose them again once they’ve become a monster. But Sherlock turns and smiles at him with a love brighter than the sunrise, and he’s reminded that they both have everything they need.
Even hours later, the images are chilling. He can't help but wonder if they're connected to the closing of The Strand—and to William's disappearance.
Intermission begins. The audience cheers. The police arrive. Things get loud and blurry until Sherlock finds himself outside the building, crouching on the pavement next to a semi-conscious John. John is alert enough to reassure him he's going to be alright—there doesn't appear to be any spinal injury. And though alright he may be, there's an infinitesimal possibility that after he falls fully unconscious, Sherlock cradles his head in his lap until the medics arrive.
The all-too familiar feeling of tears stings John’s eyes. “Sherlock. My love." He attempts to steady his voice, but he’s barely able to hide the emotion in his words. “You are the loveliest thing I have ever laid eyes on. To behold you is to behold even more beauty than the moon, or any ocean, or any mountain on Earth."
John throws his head back and laughs with his entire body in the way that Sherlock really, really likes. “Not sure about that. I suppose I’ll consider it.”
"It's been two weeks, Lestrade," John says. "Did I not just say that? Has everyone lost their hearing completely?"
William acknowledges him with his characteristic aloofness, an unlit cigarette dangling from his dumb gorgeous mouth. “Sorry, sir. The bar is closed. I’m going on a cigarette break.”
"You really ought to get off the floor," he says in a soothing voice. "You've been sulking for days now. As your doctor, I worry."
"I'm sorry. I should take this. I’ll only be two minutes." He tucks his hand beneath John's chin, planting a firm kiss on his mouth. "Just...don't go anywhere? Please."
Sherlock fidgets, laughing nervously as his gaze moves. “I may have said something to the medical staff after you were injured. And to that end, there may be certain...implications involving the two of us.”
“There was something I—” Sherlock clears his throat. “Something I always hoped we could practice, back when we were...practicing things. I'm disappointed that the opportunity never presented itself."
As he smiles and nods along, his aimless gaze inevitably hones in on Sherlock’s beautiful lips. Oh, those lips. They will be the death of him. Those criminal, savage, murderous lips. They ought to be locked up, really. By John's lips, perhaps.
Sherlock kisses with unrestrained enthusiasm—as if he's never been kissed before, as though the joy is something he thought he might never know. And John wonders if he has ever truly been kissed himself—because nothing has ever come close to the taste of Sherlock’s lips. Richer than merlot. Sweeter than moscato.
Good morning, John. Or afternoon. Or whatever chunk of time finds you reunited with your phone. I revealed to you earlier that the reasons I love you are infinite. And as I lie awake next to you, some of them came to me. I want to share them with you, but if I tell you now, you probably won’t hear them. Because you’re sleeping.
“Sherlock.” Molly reaches across the table and sets her hand over his in a gesture of solidarity. "Let me ask you frankly. Do you love him back?"
Mrs. Hudson's expression is full of sentiment and affection, and Molly has shown her unyielding friendship time and time again. It’s during moments like these, he also knows, that
John closes his eyes as he squeezes Sherlock closer. The two of them use every last drop of energy to press their bodies together, filling their brains with memories to hold on to.
The streets of Back Bay are adorned with snow and brightly-coloured holiday lights. Sports fans wander in baseball caps; couples walk hand-in-hand over the riverwalk; students sip on hot drinks in the cafe. Twenty-somethings line up around the block, breathing thick clouds of frost as they wait to enter this week’s trendy club.
Their friendship continues just as easily as ever—full of mutual admiration, laughter, and late nights at the laboratory. They never speak of the kiss again.
So I made them into a list. Obviously, this is a very, very small fraction of infinite. Infinity can’t be measured, actually. I’ll presume this is a good place to start.
He runs his fingers through his hair impatiently. He just wants to sleep. But he knows that if William is in danger, every minute counts—and that every minute is one minute closer to seeing him again.
But among the hundreds of titles, there is one book, pulled slightly out from the shelf, that draws his attention:
"You don't need to! The judgmental manner in which you arch your eyebrow and unhinge your jaw speaks volumes!"
"She does?" Sherlock seems genuinely shocked. "Then why do I seem to provoke such intense anxiety when I'm around her?"
John knows he and Sherlock aren't a couple, of course. But sometimes, over the candle's flame, he imagines that they are. When Sherlock looks at him that way—what choice has he got?
Sherlock feels as if the air has been knocked out of his chest. He blinks at John, quietly stunned. He wants to say something in return, but never in his life could he have prepared himself for this.
“No.” William shakes his head. “What I mean to say is...that it was solely an act of self-preservation. The moment you sat at my bar, you crawled beneath my skin. I have never craved anything more deeply; I yearned to know what it would be like to kiss you, to touch you. And I—“ he pauses to swallow again. “I couldn’t allow it to happen.”
The door comes sooner than they expect. Sherlock's back collides with it, but he doesn't allow it any interruption—continuing to sweep his tongue in irregular circles over John's. John pins him in place, holding to the door frame with one hand as he fumbles with the keys in the doorknob.
It isn’t as though either of them can easily run off; they’re stuck here, stuck to endure the result of any embarrassing situation that may arise.
A small deck behind the house leads the two of them directly into a bedroom. John assumes it's Sherlock's. They're greeted by a cold blast of air upon entering, for which John is grateful. The room is dark; sunlight has been filtered out by curtains. In the corner, John notices something propped against the back of an armchair. “A violin,” he remarks. “I forgot that you play.” He turns, expecting to see Sherlock at his side.
When the small talk ends, however, and things heat up between the two women— he’s less thankful. He tries not to let their murmuring words of desire and vivid descriptions of sexual scenarios affect him. He sort of wants to slump down in his chair—he’s in public, and it’s not the time or the place to become aroused by the sounds of two women having sex.
“Mrs. Hudson suggested it awhile ago. We’ve been working to make it suitable for your return. We weren’t planning on it being this soon, but it will have to do, I suppose. I’ll transfer most of the items that could cause potentially harmful chemical reactions as soon as I—”
John laughs. "You'd be lucky to have me around as a ghost. But either way, it doesn’t matter. Right now, we're both here—in corporeal form. We’re in our bed, and we're safe. And that's what matters. You and me, Sherlock—as long as we're here together, nothing bad can happen to us."
“Only for a few days.” Sarah taps her fingers on the steering wheel. “I think I was just...blindsided by my feelings for him. But things quickly started to get worse. He would get angry with me for little things. On the night before Christmas Eve, he drank too much. Told me that without him, I’d be miserable, and my mom would never get better. I immediately went home after that, and broke it off with him the next morning. He seemed...oddly fine with it.”
“Thank you.” Sherlock’s cheeks turn a dusky shade of pink. "Hold on to me now—as tightly as possible."
“That’s the thing. We can’t share his location,” Molly says. “Mostly because we don’t know it ourselves.”
"Oh," John breathes, lifting his hands to the sides of William's face. "Hello. I thought I'd lost you."
"Erm.” Sherlock clears his throat, still attempting to even out his breaths. “You and I were inside a cathedral…which was also a theatre. And there was a performance. I didn’t know my lines, and the stage was moving...but before that, you were playing the pipe organ. John—what's a Journey song?"
"Probably!" Sherlock has passed through all five stages of grief in the past ten seconds, and he's simply decided to accept that John is amused by his trauma. Whatever. John's laugh is infectious. It isn't long before Sherlock can't help but join in.
, and especially when his lips are heart-shaped and pink like cotton candy and full and beautiful like
And then, they’re kissing again. They’re kissing, wrapped up in each other on the floor of Mrs. Hudson’s flat. And with a dark silhouette from the corner looking on, it almost feels like they’re defying Death—which is something the two of them are both very good at.
As they all sit together happily—John close enough to Sherlock to feel his warmth—John thinks to himself that this is what family ought to be like.
He wonders if Sherlock loved him, too, that night; pressing him against the wall and claiming him as his own, crushing their lips together until they were bruised.
Molly straightens herself up, jumps into the air to give William a quick kiss on the cheek, and wraps her arms around his shoulders as well.
Sherlock peers over at him with curiosity as he loops his scarf around his neck. “What’s the matter?” he asks, taking a few steps towards him.
He looks back downwards, and the face of the monster has returned. “My god,” he says with disgust. “Why, Sherlock? Why have you chosen this man over your very own life?”
“Dunno.” She closes it. “I keep reading the same page over and over, but I’m not retaining anything.”
They lock eyes, and Sherlock can feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. He hopes it's too dark in the room for John to notice.
“Lestrade’s expression looks very serious…” John whispers. “Quite grave, actually. As if he’s just heard a bit of sobering news…” He leans in for a clearer view. “I can’t see what his face is doing… Oh!” he gasps again and places his hand on Sherlock’s. “Oh no. Death has taken Lestrade by the arm! They’re walking off... he’s pulling him away… they’re headed towards the dark corridor...Greg! Where are you going?”
At that exact moment, a morning bird starts to sing, and a ray of sunlight pours in from behind the clouds.
Sherlock takes him by the hand to lead him upstairs to his tiny quarters. Sleepy and satisfied, they curl up together, and they fall into a deep slumber that seems to last a lifetime.
He carefully leans in until his lips are directly over her ear, dropping his voice low. “Is he dead, Irene?”
John supposes it’s nice to be missed—and this conversation they’re having causes him to realize he misses her as well. They’ve been classmates at Harvard for the past three years, and they were friends long before they began dating.
Brook was arrested and put on leave of absence. Using the evidence I provided, he was charged with five counts of first degree murder.
At six in the morning, Sherlock falls asleep next to Brook. Eight hours later, he learns that Brook is a murderer.
Sherlock opens his eyes and gives him a sleepy, contented smile. “Hi,” he says. “That was quite nice.”
Before anyone answers, the planchette begins to move. Donovan has taken her hands away, however—and it seems to be moving, again, of its own accord.
"And you...playing with my hair. Since one of your hands was always in a cast, we were never able to practice those two things…simultaneously."
“Mm, of course she does.” William bites his bottom lip playfully. “And judging by what I’ve observed in that booth, she’s taking the advanced course.” With that, he inhales a gust of air and tosses a towel over his shoulder. “Anyway. Goodbye.”
Sherlock sprawls out face-up on the floor. He doesn't know how long he's been there; the days spill into each other and the winter sun lasts only a few hours.
John shuts his eyes and takes a moment to breathe in. “The Woman will tell you where to go,” he whispers to himself, echoing the words of the note he found in Sherlock’s flat.
“Tonight will be different.” John lowers Sherlock so his legs are around his waist. “As will every night hereafter.” He firmly kisses Sherlock on the mouth. “I hope you’re okay with that.”
John knocks once more. He listens. But there are no sounds coming from inside; no voices, no footsteps approaching, nor shifting of objects.
John stares down at his hand for a second before taking it, turning it upwards and kissing his palm, just as Sherlock did before. He continues to follow Sherlock's path—kissing his wrist, his arm, and his inner elbow. He pauses. Sherlock expects him to do as he did himself; re-tracing the trail of kisses back to their origin. But instead, he continues upwards, kissing his inner arm, his bicep, his tricep, his collarbone, and finally, his shoulder.
A sudden wave of drowsiness overtakes him. He glances over at the clock; it’s already half past one in the morning.
The morning comes far too soon, but that’s not the only thing which makes John’s waking moments nerve-wracking.
"No." John winds his fingertips through Sherlock's curls and tugs his head back downwards until their lips are aligned. "I like it, too."
The two of them have been awake for all of three minutes - and yet, Sherlock is flushed and breathless by the hurried nature of their lovemaking. The speed at which things are accelerating is quite gratifying at the moment, of course; yet unusual. Their morning kissing sessions are mostly unhurried, and often more sensual than sexual. But right now, John glides his fingers over the curves of Sherlock's lower back, his lips pressing against his neck with enough pressure to bruise--and Sherlock is hungry for more.
John opens his eyes to see that Sherlock's are still closed. His hips move in tiny tilting motions, and he’s making sounds that alternate between heavy sighs and murmurs of of John’s name.
She marches over to Elizabeth and takes her by the arm. As she drags her away, Elizabeth appears confused—but doesn’t protest. She turns back to Stamford and blows him a kiss. "I'll call you!" she mouths, and the two of them are gone.
He looks downwards, where the building lights flicker like fireflies in a city that is just at the tips of his toes, yet thousands of feet away.
Everyone’s eyes move to a delighted Mrs. Hudson. Her expression wavers between disbelief and the suspension thereof. “Is that
Sherlock has now been stuck on the Clarendon murder case for three days straight. He can’t focus. He can’t think. And it is one million percent John’s fault.
John thinks about kissing the next day at the clinic, and he thinks about kissing the day after that.
He guides Sherlock's body forwards until his opening brushes against the tip of his cock, and he arches his hips into him.
And perform they do. A cadenza near the open door for all who might glance in their direction. A lengthy encore for any medical staff who comes in, and a
John bursts into laughter, and just as suddenly as the storm began, it comes to an end. They pull away from each other, their eyes as wide as their smiles.
"Oh. You're right." Sherlock bows his head forwards to rest his cold cheek against John's. "This is much better. Thank you."
come, John." His voice is broken. “Moriarty will come, and he will take you.” Finally, he lifts his eyes to John. “I know what it feels like to lose you. And I couldn’t bear to rob the rest of the world of your light."
that night, anyway?” John asks her, referring to the night of Stamford's birthday. Now that he understands Mary's relationship to Sherlock, it makes even less sense. “Were you actually angry?”
”Dive”, for me, served as a bridge between these two worlds. Writing it has been a great solace (and sometimes a great frustration) during the Quarantine Times, so publishing the final chapter was a pretty profound experience.
“About thirty seconds before I told you. Though, come to think of it, I’m positive I’ve loved you for much longer.”
Or perhaps he’ll just find a sexy man, throw caution to the wind, and he’ll drink and kiss and fuck until William fades from his memory.
Gabriela is lying in the bed next to him, leaning against the headboard, staring at an open book in her lap.
“Mm-hmm,” John responds, cool as a cucumber. “Now was that...right before he faked his own death and fled to another continent, just so he wouldn’t have to see you again?” He lets out a low whistle. “Hate to tell you, mate, but it sounds like he’s not that into you.”
William unbuttons his own trousers and steps out of them, his cock hard and glistening at the tip with liquid. The sight of him sends a tremendous shiver through John’s body.
Sherlock is surprised at how easy it is to interact with him, especially considering his lack of experience in the area of human companionship. He has never had much interest in social interactions, even as a child—preferring to stay alone indoors with a book or a microscope.
"Did you ever think about how things between you two are going to be so, so different now? Because you
“That’s where you’re incorrect.” Sherlock flicks away the second dandelion and adjusts his body so he’s facing John. “You believe that time is linear; that only the past can be remembered. But in fact, time and space move forwards and backwards and up and down and all sorts of ways. A memory can occur tomorrow, or yesterday, or six thousand years from now, or it can even be happening right this instant. It may be here, or in another universe, or in fifteen universes at once.”
"Bye, Greg," John says curtly, following Sherlock to the exit. But as he holds the door to open, Lestrade calls out one more time.
John continues, working all of the same magic with his mouth and his tongue and his light sucking motions, expanding his technique by wrapping his arm around Sherlock and sliding his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock's breath hitches, and he audibly swallows—but he tilts his head, offering the rest of his neck in invitation.
“No,” John whispers to himself, a wave of nausea passing through him. He doesn’t like this dream anymore. He wants to leave it. So he squeezes his eyes shut and tells himself to wake up.
His eyes are closed as if he’s meditating. He seems so peaceful; not at all the busy, boisterous man from the bar.
"Hm." John nods towards his mostly broken body. "I'm a bit limited at the moment physically. But I could always use my words."
Sarah tries to argue, but she isn’t very convincing. So instead, she offers John her guest room for the night. And although he wants to be alone now, he doesn’t know if he has the energy to deal with public transportation.
Shortly after, Molly drops by. She’s equally giddy about the fake marriage. She jokes about throwing them a reception. Mrs. Hudson loves the idea. John secretly does as well. Sherlock reminds them that he hates parties. Molly and Mrs. Hudson discuss the details anyway.
As they make their way through morning traffic, the drive is mostly silent. Las Vegas fades into the background, and they approach an open highway with beautiful, clear skies which extend far past what the eye can see.
Whatever he and John are doing—it’s clearly affecting him in a big way. How foolish is he to think he can simply pretend it’s not real? And how mad is he to think he’s got the right to hide it all away, as if it were some deeply shameful secret?
For a short time, Mary stares down at her hands on her knees, saying nothing. John wonders if she’s already regretting her decision. But she finally turns to him, her eyes apprehensive.
But Sherlock isn't actually thinking of that. Obviously. All Sherlock does is go to sleep immediately. He doesn't study John's nose hairs, or count his breaths, or wonder whether the mole on his left inner arm was there the night before.
Once they leave, Gabriela heads off to the loo for her nighttime routine. John changes into his pajamas and sinks into bed, feeling as if his body carries the weight of a bulldozer. He reads Sherlock’s letter again, and rereads it, and rereads it again. By the end of the night, he’ll surely have memorized every last word, but he can’t stop—these words are the only piece of Sherlock he’s got.
He turns his head slowly, slowly, dragging his cheek over Brook's. He hesitates before their lips meet, allowing Brook the chance to break away or protest. He doesn't; he slides his fingers to the small of Sherlock's back and squeezes his hips, closing the distance between their bodies—and Sherlock is suddenly very much reminded that Brook is wearing very little.
“I’ve been hunted for the past three years, and I’ve got a brother high up in the government. I have access to state of the art protection. Nobody ever suspects an apparently plain undergarment.”
This chapter is dedicated to the memory of Una Stubbs, who always portrayed Baker Street's landlady (and not housekeeper) flawlessly. Rest in Peace <3
He returns to his book, desperately attempting to retain any of the knowledge he’s taking in. But everything useful is immediately replaced with memories of the scent of William’s shampoo. The way his fingers felt against his skin when they brushed over his cheek. The sounds he made when he breathed John’s name against his neck as he arched his body into his.
John's got at least ten of these shirts. And every variant looks very good on his fun-sized body.  Sherlock has studied each variant; he knows them well. He's even named a few.
“No! Don’t go!” John pleads. He then peers at the tall, silent shadow figure looming in the doorway. He stops using his voice, dramatically mouthing one word:
And finally, halfway through a second bottle of wine, the flames of the fireplace flicker in John's eyes, and the question slips from his tongue.
“Well, your actions do affect others. I mean, Marci’s personal life is not yours to comment on. Come to think of it, neither is mine. And you ruined her night, and you ruined my best friend’s birthday. So you may be the most bloody gorgeous man in the room, but it doesn’t matter. Because you’re a very mean person—and in my book, that makes you ugly."
"No, listen. The Woman. He flips the card over to show her. "The words are capitalised. Like it's a name."
Mycroft turns away from the window to face him. “Gregory," he says softly. "It’s alright. You don’t need to—“
It bleeds into his ears, sending ripples of nostalgia down his spine. Each chord grows more dissonant until the piece finally approaches a cadence. As this happens, Sherlock's curiosity grows, and he opens his eyes to see who plays.
He hasn’t even had William in his bed. Sure, he’s had him everywhere else: the floor. The table. The bathroom counter. The wall, the alleyway, the kitchen. And now, he’ll have him nowhere at all but his dreams.
The game ends with a draw, and with William leaning naked over the pool table, massaging his cock with the palm of his hand; and John, kneeling beneath him, massaging his arsehole with his tongue.
After he bids everyone farewell, someone among them decides they’ve got to end the night by playing a game called Never Have I Ever. Sherlock is unfamiliar with the game, so he lets John explain the rules.
John pulls him closer. "They came here to see a show, so that’s what we’ll give them.” Their noses bump lightly. "And if we kiss, maybe the stars will keep glowing."
Sherlock turns his head to face John, furrowing his brow. “It’s not high on my list of priorities.” He’s clearly done talking about it.
He wonders if he ought to ignore her. He probably would—if he weren’t so desperately longing for a distraction.
He shifts his gaze back to Sherlock, who he finds gazing back. Across the rows of seats, they grin fondly at one another. “Yeah. I love him more than anything.”
John scoffs. “Is that just for the drink, or are you running a tab on seductive ear-whispering and arsehole comments?”
John hushes him and takes his hand. “Not something to joke about, love.” He holds his hand to his mouth and kisses it softly. “I would be very lonely if that happened.”
John closes his eyes again, imagining Sherlock beneath him this time, blindfolded as John fucks him so hard that he screams and begs for mercy.
It takes a full three seconds before it registers with John that he’s referring to the drink. But William has already turned his attention to an attractive raven-haired woman who dons a leather corset and scarlet-stained lips. John feels—something. Something fierce. Annoyance? Desire? He’s not going to figure it out—not tonight.
“There needn’t be any further discussion, nor negotiation,” Sherlock insists. “This war is mine, and I refuse to let John fight it.
Eventually, John's hands drift past Sherlock's shoulders, trickle over his collarbone, and roam to the buttons of his collar.
“Who cares about that?” Sherlock leaps up from the floor and makes his way to Mrs. Hudson’s fireplace. “Let’s see what’s beneath the floorboards!”
“Perhaps you could help me understand what it is you actually want.” John meets his gaze. "Because the messages you're sending are a bit...muddled."
John comes to a halt a few steps away from the bed. He certainly wasn’t expecting Sherlock to follow him, though it hinders his intention to vanish beneath the covers and dissociate from everything—and he hasn’t yet formed a backup plan.
Sherlock knows he came to the kitchen for a reason, but he can’t recall what it was. He’s certain John will be the death of him in one way or another.
As natural as it felt for Sherlock to slide his hand into his—this action feels ten times more so. John, wrapping Sherlock into a protective embrace; Sherlock yielding, sliding his hands beneath John's coat to circle his arms around his waist.
They make it to the top of the stairway and through the front door of their flat before John’s strength begins to wane. Sherlock must sense it happening; he lowers one arm to his waist to steady him, walking at his side as they make their way to Sherlock’s room.
John tells him that he adores him, that he cherishes every moment of his skin pressed against his. And when he’s ready, Sherlock wraps John around him, and he opens him up.
know." Sherlock dusts himself off, refusing to meet Moriarty's eyes. "That's what makes this all even more odd."
“I wouldn’t bet on that.” A cracking noise; something thrashing against bone. Moriarty releases his grip, and Sherlock spins, finding himself face to face with John. John’s holding Moriarty around the neck beneath one arm, pointing a gun to his temple with the other. It appears to be Mary’s gun—the one he’s just used to strike Moriarty on the head with.
John doesn’t need to be asked twice; his eyelids are heavy, and his body feels like it’s going to collapse at any moment. “Goodbye,” he says politely, though he is filled with utter relief as they walk out the door.
Sherlock chokes on air, his cheeks growing red at John's assertion. He clears his throat. "I don't know."
As John ponders this, he notices that Sherlock has fallen silent for the first time in hours. His light blue eyes shift to their joined fingers.
“You won’t be able to help him.” Mary speaks as though she’s conveying the simplest, most basic truth. “When it’s my intention to kill, I never miss.”
"John.” He sighs and slides his hand over John’s arm, placing it softly on his shoulder. “As you’re aware, I’m the most observant man in London. I’m quite possibly the most observant man in world. Do you honestly think I don’t notice the way you look at me?”
John has never felt anything like this. As he drives himself into Sherlock, everything else fading away, his entire body is lit with more pleasure than he ever thought possible. Sherlock has never been more beautiful than right now; head thrown back wantonly onto the pillow. Shadows dance over his exposed neck and throat; his curls are tangled and matted to his forehead with sweat, and his naked body surges beneath him like ocean waves.
“They've gone back,” she answers. “We decided at least one of us should stay behind for your safety, just in case. I volunteered."
John pulls Sherlock’s body upwards, wrapping his arms and legs around his hips and torso. He squeezes Sherlock against him so tightly that Sherlock can barely breathe, but breathing is the last thing on his mind. Sherlock bites his lip to stifle a sob, clinging to him with everything he has.
But John has some damned drinks to order—so he waits patiently as William serves the next person in line. He waits patiently as he moves on to the next person, and the next, and the next.
And at some point soon after, Gabriela's got her legs wrapped around Sarah’s waist, pinning her to the sofa, and their tongues and hips slide together as John watches, his hand resting over the zip of his trousers.
"Goodnight, Sherlock." John reaches to the foot of the bed, recovering the elements he threw off in his earlier bout of rage. "I'm going to have nightmares about my fingers being crushed. Thanks for that."
“Right!” John blurts. “Oh, yes. Yes. Apologies. I—I hit my head, you know. But it’s true. We are....soooooo married.” He laughs like a madman, confidently taking Sherlock’s hand into his. “Yes. Husband.
Over the back door of The Strand are three enormous letters. They're sprayed on in dark red paint, dripping down the wood like blood. The first letter—an
Sherlock inhales. This is simple. A deduction. He’s done thousands of them, so why is this one more difficult than any other?
John groans. He wants to close his eyes and cover his ears and go to sleep for the next seven million years. Instead, he chugs his coffee, plans a
On and off, I feel his eyes, paralysing me as though he’s some snake-headed she-devil. Do you suppose he’s plotting my death? -SH
John takes a seat on the bed next to her, nodding firmly. “Right. You stay here and wait for her to arrive. She’s scheduled for 9. Don’t forget to turn on your earpiece. I’ll be in the casino listening in.”
Sherlock tries to respect Brook's wishes. It proves difficult, at times, to keep his findings to himself--but he soon becomes to think of it as a furtive mission of proof that he can, indeed solve it on his own. The two of them go on as normal, but Sherlock spends his own spare time--when he’s not studying or helping Brook--looking into the Oxford murders. He frequently contacts Sergeant Lestrade, a New Scotland Yard detective in London who begrudgingly consults Brook and himself when the London police are in over their heads. He cautiously allows his confidence and fascination to grow, especially when a third murder occurs a few weeks later, and then a fourth.
“Good.” He lifts her hand to his mouth to kiss the back of her palm, and she hums with happiness. “I’ll visit the loo and then order an Uber for us.”
“No.” Sarah grins. “Gabriela pulled out her pepper spray. While he was reeling from that, she kicked him in the nuts with her six inch heels. I punched him in the face hard enough to knock him unconscious. Some other residents heard the commotion and called for the police to come, but Gab and I were able to subdue him in the meantime.”
Sherlock’s chest swells with so much gratitude for his friend that he can’t contain it. Perhaps it's because of Brook’s words, or the suspense of their case, or the nostalgia of another year coming to a close—but whatever it is, this moment has a profound effect on him.
He touches himself, and he kisses John, and the two men make love until they've exhausted all of their energy. They take a few moments to slide their tongues together, and they continue to make love again. Sherlock's leg muscles grow tired; his abdominal muscles cramp, but he doesn’t care. It’s easy to ignore these things when the air is full of gasps and bitten off words and whatever this feeling is.
"Ugh," Anderson responds mildly. He gazes up at them from his mobile phone, seemingly unperturbed by the sight of John straddling a half-unbuttoned Sherlock. "Sally's angry with me."
John briefly considers jumping from his seat to go after them, but decides it’s not worth the effort. He doesn’t see the point in chasing a person who’s already caught someone else. What other things has she lied about? Who is this bloke, and how long has this been going on? And what now? Should he ask for an explanation, or should he just break up with her?
Surprisingly, it’s Sherlock’s body that goes still first. He chokes out John’s name again, clenched and throbbing around John’s hardness, grunting with pleasure as he wrings out his release.
Suddenly, the creature let out a blood curdling scream. Sherlock and John both covered their ears, wincing in pain. Just as suddenly the scream stopped and the woman returned to glaring at them, though John thought he saw the corner of her mouth twitch upward.
"Dr. Watson," he moved to the bed before speaking, turning so John could see him, "I'm your doctor. My name is Dr. Azarian. Did Sherlock tell you I was coming?"
Frustrated, he moved around to the other side of the castle, only to find the same problem. Then, trying to get to the back, he hit a wall that prevented him from moving around the castle entirely.
In the end, they had sat together in John's room the night before his surgery in a tense, uncomfortable silence. Sherlock hadn't been able to think of anything to say that would persuade John. John had been silent since he'd gotten the news--resolute and determined and stubborn and infuriating and so damn
The paramedics rush John away the moment they arrive and a nurse ushers Sherlock into an uncomfortable waiting room again. Lestrade is close at his heels.
And then Sherlock's wretched look surfaced in John's mind and the medical voice in the back of his head repeated
“It’s always been difficult for me…” he started. “That is… I’ve never been close to anybody, especially not like that. And after that, I vowed not to allow
He turned from the window and began making his way through the room, glancing down at the piles of papers and books. There were several files that looked to contain information about various crimes. John picked one up and found pictures of a rather gruesome murder. He put it back down where he found it.
"I've got the consent forms here for you to sign," she said, pushing her way into the room and laying the clipboard and pen on the table in front of him.
The days following John's awakening had been filled with tension. Sherlock, fearful of saying or doing something to upset John, had tried his best to remain quiet. This tactic, however, had proven ineffective. John seemed to grow more irritated with him by the day, regardless of his efforts at tact.
“I’ve been taking it slow,” he said grumpily. “If I keep taking it slow, I’m never going to get out of here.”
Before he could finish the thought, the stranger had leaped off the roof, pulling John's hand along with him. Without thinking, John followed his hand and leapt. His heart rocketed into his throat as he realized what he had just done and he closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable fall. But it never came.
Sherlock was shaking with anger. He looked over at John, who had somehow composed himself and was staring back at him. Sherlock couldn’t believe how strong this man was. Couldn’t believe his resilience.
There were several emotions competing for attention in John's muddled brain. But at that moment, his distress over Sherlock's reaction to the decision he had been forced to make was winning by far.
The crime scene was almost exactly like the previous one -- a large house, indications of isolation, absolutely no blood found around (or in) the body. Sherlock took only a cursory look before he declared it was exactly as he expected. He then turned his attention to the body, instructing Dimmock to send it to Molly. Dimmock put up only a cursory resistance before agreeing.
Sherlock smiled and pulled a file out of his coat, handing it to John, who opened it to find the information about each of the vampire murders.
"Second, there is a real chance that the intervention could cause further damage to your spinal cord, rather than restoring function. Any surgical intervention on the spinal region comes with high risk for complications and this would be particularly risky, given the nature of the injury."
"I'm not," the fire's voice was slightly muffled under the pan. "I would just like to see you actually eat for once, Sherlock."
But John is struggling. He is experiencing pain upon pain upon pain. The glass cuts into his feet as he walks. His bad leg still causes him pain whenever he tries to walk on it. And there are several wounds John had to stitch up on his feet that are now likely being reopened. Still, John moves forward stoically, barely making a noise. Sherlock’s heart aches.
Then, alarmingly, John stopped moving completely. His body lay still, his eyes rolled back in his head, and he went limp.
, Sherlock thought. He wanted to move closer. To urge the hand further down. To climb on top of John.
“We just hiked three hours into the woods for an indeterminate length of stay and you don’t know why?”
. They both recognized the voice instantly. Difficult to forget a voice that threatened to blow you up.
John glanced back over Sherlock's shoulder, toward the door and whoever had grabbed him, but he could see nobody behind Sherlock. He looked back at Sherlock.
“It’s over,” Sherlock continued. “I know who you are. We’ve found your hideout. Just make it easier on everyone and come out.”
Sherlock hesitated. He obviously couldn’t tell her what had actually triggered the episode, but he needed her help.
John pushed himself slowly up, leaning heavily on his cane. He moved to the window, wanting to determine as close to possible what time it was and how far the castle had moved in the night. When he parted the curtains and looked out, however, he almost fell backward in surprise.
"There were complications during your surgery," Sherlock said softly, and John thought his voice sounded constricted.
John didn’t appear to respond for a long few seconds. Then, slowly, he moved. Struggling the entire way, John pulled himself up from the floor and back to the table. Hesitating just a second, he reached out to the second container. Sherlock watched as the clock ticked down to seconds.
"Fine," Dr. Ramar said, his voice and demeanor calm as he leaned back in his chair, "then you will likely save Dr. Watson's leg, though I cannot guarantee it will be functional. And you will also likely sign his death certificate."
But this wasn't localized nerve damage. This wasn't loss of feeling in one part of his leg. John hadn't reacted to him moving the leg at all. There was no way moving his leg wouldn't cause him pain if he could feel any part of it.
“I love you John Watson,” he said firmly. “I love you more than I have ever loved anybody in my entire life, not that that is a difficult bar to beat. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to have you to myself. Is that what you want to hear?”
Sherlock watched as John stopped, looked at the timer, looked at the remaining distance to the door, and looked at himself. There is still so much wire between him and the door.
“We’re waiting, Sherlock,” the voice was less amused now. “You have ten seconds before I shoot Dr. Watson in the head. 10, 9, 8…”
“No, you won’t,” Sherlock said, closing his eyes. “Regardless of what you might think, you are not made of stone.”
“We’re staying here?” John asked as he stepped out of the passenger seat. “Did you get someone off a murder charge again?”
"I'll just need to find a sturdy stick along the way," he murmured to himself, trying to break the oppressive silence.
“John,” he said softly, trying to keep the anger out of his voice and failing, “I promise… I swear, I will get him. He will never hurt you or anybody else again.”
Sherlock paced along the corridor outside John's room, fists clenched with the effort of not bursting into the room and interrupting John's consultation with the audiologist.
He turned so that he was standing next to John’s outstretched, broken leg. He would step up on the leg somewhere away from the break, obviously, then immediately step off. It would hurt like hell, but maybe the damage would be minimal.
"Yes," she said, still speaking softly. "I had a lover -- a partner. Our love was forbidden and we were to be killed, but then I was turned. I saved her life, but we had to live in secrecy. We were isolated from both communities -- human and vampire."
The winter sun beat down through the limbs of the trees, barely reaching the ground through the thick foliage. In the distance, birds sang and various and sundry animals made their way through the underbrush. Leaves crunched and sticks cracked underfoot. Branches and roots seemed to appear out of nowhere, apparently intent on tripping, scratching, and simply annoying him.
"The nurse is getting you more pain medication," Sherlock was standing at his right shoulder, facing him. He was still speaking in such a low voice that John had to watch his mouth to understand him. "Do you remember where you are John?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. How dull. John already knew how he felt. He’d shown him a million times and even told him that night. It would be the easiest thing in the world to tell John verbally how he felt.
“Well, as you know, we’ve had a somewhat difficult time tracking down the colonel,” Mycroft said unnecessarily.
John finishes entering the combination and turns the handle. A second passes. They do not hear the lock move. Sherlock holds his breath.
Mycroft and Lestrade were apparently working together on getting Sebastian, but he was a slippery arsehole. They had plenty of information on him up until a couple of years ago. Then he seemed to have just disappeared. Even Mycroft couldn’t locate him. Not a good sign.
John watched the exchange, but did not interfere, afraid of scaring the woman off like an alley cat. Once it was over, Sherlock simply turned and headed inside. John glanced at the woman before following, but she had already begun to wander away.
He thought back to the X-rays Dr. Azarian had shown him--the bursts of white and shocking angles and lack of straight lines. He thought back to the mess of blood and broken flesh and bone he had glimpsed when John was pulled from the hole. He thought back to the "specialists" telling him they could not guarantee the leg would be "functional."
“Ah,” Mycroft said. “I’ve been reading about our Mr. Moran. Apparently, he has quite the history of… misbehavior. Can I assume John encountered some of this… behavior while they were serving together?”
John was in and out of consciousness for the next few days, still on the respirator. Sherlock begged, pleaded, threatened, cajoled, did everything he could to get John off that damn respirator. He was clearly in pain and wanted to say something, but he couldn’t with that thing down his throat. But the doctors were being conservative. With John’s lung still healing and his fever still high, they didn’t want to risk it.
John's head felt as though it were buzzing. He had prepared himself. He knew this was what he was going to hear, down almost to the exact wording. Yet he had not been prepared at all. He realized suddenly that he hadn't been breathing and took a painful breath, willing himself to continue listening, though he wasn't certain he could take any more bad news.
Though John is flattered by Gabriela’s unwavering faith in him, he hesitates before giving her an answer. “In the letter, Sherlock begged me not to go after him.”
“I tried to forget about you, but over the next few days, I thought of little else.” He presses the palm of his hand into his thigh anxiously. “I tried to keep you at arm’s length—but I couldn’t say no to you. I didn’t
”Sorry to, erm...interrupt,” he says. “But the weather has cleared up slightly. Molly, I’ve called you an Uber. It should be here in about two minutes.”
Sherlock recognises the sound of the gait immediately: Alegria Paloma orthopaedic loafers, embellished by a mild limp, brought on by osteoarthritis of the hip.
John releases a breath of laughter and sighs with resignation. “Fine. But as soon as I’m free from these stupid things—” he nods towards the pair of crutches propped against the fireplace—“I’m coming with you, and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”
John's wonders if Sherlock realises how incredibly loved he is. “What time will we go?” he asks. He’s prepared to go now, in his pajamas, if he must.
Sherlock hums happily, eyes falling back to John’s lips. “Thank you for the beautiful gift, by the way. It was worth the wait.”
“I should have been more open with you,” she says. “But I was a bit ashamed of it all, and...I eventually became swept up in this fantasy life. A Cinderella story, or something like that. I fell for him pretty hard.”
Sherlock exhales a shaky laugh and kisses John's shoulder. "And then we were on Mount Kilimanjaro, and you said you had to go, and...you disappeared. That’s when I lost you."
"Stop it," John replies with a grin. "At least I haven't taken to spending my days on the ground like some wild animal."
Sherlock looks over at John, who looks back at him. They smile fondly at one another, as they often do; as though they’re holding a secret that no one else is privy to.
Suddenly, Sherlock pulls away from their kiss. His nose remains pressed against John's; his hands remain at his waist. "I can't take this anymore!" he exclaims.
After Sherlock excuses himself to get dressed, John slowly and ruefully pulls his own clothes on. They immediately return to each other’s arms, clinging to each other’s bodies like a child would to a blanket. The final minutes slip away from them, and the sadness begins falling upon them in waves.
Sherlock looks up at him. Stares at his kiss-swollen mouth. He misses it already. "And I am? Worth kissing, I mean."
Molly is a small, pretty woman with strawberry blond hair. She wears hostess attire, and her hair is all done up with red and white bows, and she’s decorating a large Christmas tree on one side of the bar lounge.
“Sure.” John scoots forwards towards the Ouija board, fingers still laced between Sherlock’s. “There’s got to be something connected to it. Hidden wires, perhaps? A magnet? An optical illusion?”
“Lestrade.” John speaks up as the name provokes a sudden familiarity—from the news article he read, and from Sherlock’s letter. “Sergeant Lestrade. You’re the New Scotland Yard officer who reported Sherlock dead.”
”Anyhow,” Sherlock abruptly continues. “I suppose this is also a silly question, but—are you feeling alright?”
“You shouldn’t have followed us here,” she snaps in response. “You’ve put yourself in danger by doing so.”
Sherlock thinks of dragging his tongue over John's slick chest. He thinks of removing the towel from John's waist and worshipping the treasure that lies beneath. And as the kiss lingers, it quickly steers into new territory—Sherlock can't fight it.
Donovan regards her warily at first, but quickly gives in. “Alright.” She slowly approaches the board and sets her fingertips over the planchette.
John pulls away from the comfort of Sherlock’s shoulder to take a look at his face. He can’t help but smile; a confident Sherlock is sexy as hell, but a flustered Sherlock is impossibly endearing. "You thought, perhaps...?"
As soon as she's gone, John and Sherlock continue honing their kissing techniques. Sherlock tells John that he's a very quick study, but that he thinks he may need much more kissing practice himself.
The unanticipated move causes an immediate wave of excitement to wash over Sherlock’s body. He squirms beneath John as the tips of John’s lips brush against his jaw. “Yes, John?”
Sherlock’s not entirely sure how much kissing between himself and John might be considered a lot, as his only frame of reference is prior to a week ago, when the number was never. And though one might think performing a single activity for hours on end would become tiresome, this is not the case at all—John is a professional, and he knows how to keep it exciting.
The flight to Vegas the next day is six hours and is mostly uneventful. John and Gabriela are seated next to an overly-talkative woman in her sixties who chats with Gabriela for what seems like hours.
He arrives home at a quarter to ten. The lights are off in the sitting room of 221B, but once he enters, he notices a faint light glowing beneath his bedroom door. His heart begins to flutter, and he opens it to find exactly what he was hoping for.
John laughs, reaching out to tuck a piece of hair behind Sherlock’s ear. “When did you figure it out?”
The man stands in silence next to the lifeless body of Mary, towering above her like a spectre. He doesn’t notice her; his attention is drawn elsewhere.
Sherlock wants to offer comfort, but by now, he’s giggling so uncontrollably that he can barely catch his breath. So he sits upright, scoots in besides John, and pulls him in for a hug. “Even though you’re clearly experiencing an episode of drug-induced paranoia,” he says once he can breathe again, “...you’re looking out for your friends.”
Sherlock glances over. Lestrade is standing before the hooded figure, engaged in a deep conversation.
Sherlock swallows thickly. “And was it clear, as well, the manner in which I had my lips attached to your lips?”
"Okay, fine!" In a dramatic gesture, John flails the blankets off his upper body and onto the foot of the bed. “You’re right! I've got no idea what to talk to you about! And it's driving me mad!"
“And yet you haven’t seen him since,” the man continues. “He’s mysteriously disappeared, has he not? How are you so sure he’s still alive?”
"John? John! I'm so sorry," Sherlock whispers hoarsely, though he doesn't think John can hear him. "I'm sorry, John. I never meant for you to get hurt."
Elizabeth. As Mycroft says her name, John's chest aches. He thinks about how difficult this must be for her. It’s doubtful that she knew her best friend was a government agent who lied about her identity, and even more unlikely that she knew she was an assassin. Have they even informed her that Marci was actually Mary, and that she's been shot dead?
“They’ve been coming here together for quite some time, you know. Same spot—a standing reservation on Thursdays at 7:30. Though I often see them here on weekends as well.”
Sherlock isn't deterred; he only pats the back of John’s empty wheelchair next to him. "Hop to it, Watson."
John does feel inclined, so he presses his lips to the crown of Sherlock’s head—more deliberately this time.
unbearable—dare he say approaching normal—Anderson and Donovan have been this evening. It’s a realisation he finds deeply unsettling.
John's eyes fly open, and he pulls away with a gasp. He and Sherlock are back in the bright, sunny field.
they talk to everyone. So, tell me then—" he tilts his head inquisitively, and Sherlock can't help but get a bit giddy when he looks at him like that. "—how are you going to convince everyone here that you’re a fantastic husband?”
When he lifts his gaze to Sherlock, Sherlock is looking back at him. His expression is somewhat forlorn—but very much needy and desperate.
John shivers with anticipation; he drops his own towel to the floor, and he walks across the room to meet him. He stops, and Sherlock wraps his arms around his lower back to pull him into his lap. After they become aligned, Sherlock moves his hands to John’s buttocks, coaxing his hips forwards. John inhales a sharp, flustered breath as they grind their cocks together. They rock their hips, trembling and sighing from the pleasure until it can no longer be contained. And when they can't take it any longer, Sherlock cakes his finger in a generous coat of saliva, and he slides it into John to open him up. He soon slides in a second finger, and a third, giving John a rough, passionate finger fuck until he is ready to take him all in.
“Mmm." John enthusiastically reaches into the drawer and takes out the tube. But before he begins anything new and exciting and possibly quite kinky, he simply places a kiss on Sherlock’s lips. “Will you turn over onto your stomach for me, Sherlock?”
The second John is spent, he collapses onto Sherlock. His knees burn from sliding over the bed continuously; his arms are weak from holding himself upwards.
The driver smiles at him. "You're very brave," he remarks kindly. "It's no wonder he likes you so much."
Sherlock's eyes fall to the carpet. To John's spread knees. To John's hands. To his form-fitting trousers. Back to the floor. A doctor's touch. It's his own fault, he supposes. Or at least the fault of his treacherous, semi-drunken tongue.
John slides his fingers in further, wriggling them, scissoring them, and working some type of magic that, apparently, only the hands of a doctor hold.
John glances again at the clock on the wall. It’s a quarter past two in the morning, but his mind doesn’t rest; it seems to be clinging to the events of the day.
For a fleeting moment, he feels Brook’s willingness to reciprocate: a sharp exhalation, a forward tilt of his head, the tightening of his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Then you’re an idiot,” William says through tight lips. “Everyone in their right minds went indoors hours ago to have a drink in their own bloody homes—and yet, here you are, treading through the snow like some stubborn mule!”
She seems to ignore his statement, perhaps distracted by how cold he seems to be. “Jesus, John, it’s freezing.” She grabs him again by the arm. “Come in. I think there’s still some hot coffee at the bar.”
"That is to say—” John jumps in, attempting to recuperate. “We’ve been married five months. Together for three years."
Just as Sherlock predicted, Lestrade returns a few minutes later. He’s sans Death, but clearly alive. And so the party goes on.
“Also none of your god-damned business.” John glares at the man, hoping he spills the entire glass of water on his ridiculously pristine shirt.
Sherlock scowls. "I don't need luck," he states, continuing his task. “However, there is one final thing before you go—“
Their tongues slide sweetly together, skimming over the insides of one another’s mouths, lingering as their hearts and breaths become aligned. They cling to each other, their kisses slow and tender and delicate and unhurried. Tangled up beneath the blankets, they remove their clothing piece by piece.
Sherlock’s back is to him. He leans over a table, his knuckles white from fear. He tilts his head down, his curls falling over his face. He says nothing.
“What the hell, Sherlock?” John squawks, his voice soaring upwards precisely one octave. As he wipes the tea from his chin and various parts of clothing, his face grows pale, his eyes as wide as the harvest moon.
Mrs. Petrova laughs at John, and she notes that he's a little bit littler than Sherlock, and she decides to hurl him out the window instead.
” answers in his Mind Palace; he assumes (correctly) that this knowledge will prove valuable in the future.
John obliges, weaving their fingers together. His pain medicine seems to be kicking in, and he's becoming very drowsy, so he wishes Sherlock goodnight.
“The raw chemistry, the passion we have—it’s unprecedented. I have never experienced anything like it. I believe we both dove into this headfirst, deliberately not thinking of the consequences. Perhaps we were convinced there wouldn't be any. But that’s no longer the case.” His lips form into a thin line, and his head falls. “I broke my own rule. And for that, I deeply apologise.”
But once Sherlock catches his eye, the grin is wiped from his face. He tucks his chin down and clears his throat. "We look even more convincing now," he says. “Nobody will question whether we’re married.”
“Deductions,” John repeats. “Yes, my dear Holmes,” he says, echoing Sherlock’s earlier sentiment. “I suppose your deductions are correct.”
"Ah. Of course.” Sherlock remains fidgety and distracted, drawing invisible lines between freckles on John's upper arm. "What if you and I travelled there together?"
John breaches him with the tip of his cock. He utters more filthy words beneath his breath as he takes hold of Sherlock’s hips and guides him down, inch by tortuous inch.
The sun sets. The room grows dark, and the two of them make love. And the love they make is volcanic: an eruption hotter than magma, an insurgent blaze that could take down a village.
The amalgamation of the feeling, and the telling, and the making, is something John has never experienced before tonight.
Sherlock jabs him in the chest with his elbow. He yelps in pain. “—not sure of the wedding date,” he concludes. His gaze wanders back to the succulent collection. “Though we could use a talented florist.” He grins politely at her. “Do you do such arrangements?”
"Lestrade." Sherlock spins on his heel towards the man. "Pop quiz. How long have John and I been a couple?"
“Erm, yeah,” John says, slumping down onto the sofa dramatically. “Like...when did you become such a brat?”
William holds up a hand to silence him, proceeding to take a customer’s order—and walks off again to make their drink.
“Perhaps you should ask Molly,” John suggests one afternoon in the lab at Bart’s while Sherlock examines the digestive system of a corpse.
Mycroft presses his lips together with vexation. “You are very shortsighted for someone who knows Sherlock so well.”
He wanders around until he finds the bookshelf he's looking for; he skims through the books, but finds nothing of immediate interest.
The type of succulent in this chapter, Aeonium Blood, actually does exist. As mentioned, it’s a rare cross breed, and there’s only one place that grows it! You can find it on google :)
Sherlock smiles subtly. "I suppose we ought to head out.” He unwraps his fingers from John’s, parting their knees and toes.
They reach the awning. John tries to catch his breath. It's much smaller than he expected; at arm's length, it barely covers them both.
As he stood to go, I stood with him, extending my hand to his. “The New Testament,” he said. “Matthew 5:38.”
As Sherlock stares into the whites of his wild, bloodshot eyes, he thinks of John’s bright, blue, kind ones—and he refuses to believe they could ever be the same.
"...Thank you." Sherlock lifts his arms to pull John into a full, deliberate embrace, and he kisses his neck gently in return. "So are you." He then brushes his mouth against John's jaw, and then against his earlobe.
Gabriela wastes no time, wrapping her lips around one nipple while rubbing the other with her fingers. She slides her tongue wetly over Sarah’s chest, back and forth between her two nipples, and John’s strokes become steadier.
John pushes into him faster and deeper, and the speed and roughness William’s strokes begin to match his thrusts.
William uses his thumb to trace soft circles around the tip’s opening, and John can't fight it—he's already hard.
Sherlock peers back at him, affronted. “Are you suggesting that I’ve resorted to simple olfactory methods to carry out my deductions?” he scoffs.
"You're being ironic," Sherlock observes. "Because we are already boyfriends. But I'll take bait. Yes, I will be your boyfriend."
John lifts his head to look him in the eye. "When you and I are here together, Sherlock—in our room, in our bed—nothing bad can happen to us."
husband things. He's thinking of John's radiant skin, and what it might feel like grazing beneath all ten of his fingertips. He's thinking of running his lips and his open hands over John's damp chest, and his shoulders, and his abdomen. He's thinking of what it would be like for himself and John to partake in ultimate physical gratification.
aroused. Sure, John isn’t handsome in the traditional sense, and Sherlock knows that. But god, right now—as he pulls himself out of those  ill-fitting corduroy Grandfather trousers—he couldn’t be any more perfect.
“I know you don’t want to talk about how you’re feeling,” he says. “But there’s one thing I’ve got to say: it’s you, John, and it’s always been you. And I think perhaps I was searching for you my entire life; but I must have felt I needed to temporarily fill the space I was keeping for John Watson.”
John asks approximately four thousand more silly questions, and Sherlock still has to tell him the answer.
Sherlock, who isn’t as good at hiding his feelings as he believes he is, displays a series of several emotions within a span of three seconds. Confusion, comprehension, disbelief, disappointment, neutrality. And finally, he forces a smile.
“And therefore,” Sherlock remarks casually, not bothering to lift his eyes from the screen of his laptop. “...The obvious solution is that you and I have sexual intercourse.”
John becomes overwhelmed by the urge to kiss him, to hold and comfort him, to let him cry into his chest until his tears run dry. Instead, he takes him gently by the shoulders. “Say that again?”
John bows his head as his hands fall to Sherlock's shoulders. “Your observations. All of those things you said about me. They were right, you know."
But the time will soon come when they will be allowed to enter the world anew; and it will be as beautiful as if they were seeing it for the first time.
I've been putting the finishing touches on this chapter for a week now. If I don't publish it tonight, I'll probably turn into a pumpkin. So here it is. Sorry in advance for any typos! I'll fix them tomorrow, once I'm no longer in danger of becoming a giant gourd.
As they climb the front steps, John’s heart pumps so fast he thinks he may pass out. His thoughts have mostly gone blank other than the spinning out of Sherlock’s name on repeat. They reach the door, and Mary nods her head. John knocks. They wait. There’s no answer.
Sherlock’s chest heaves lightly. His eyes wander back to John, and he clenches his fists. That’s when he moves; swiftly making his way across the grass.
At last, Sherlock gives in. Yielding to the losing battle, he raises his head to meet John’s gaze. It can’t be helped, really—his eyes (cerulean eyes, with tiny flecks of gold) are like magnets to his own.
“Sherlock is a grown man. With a free will. Capable of making his own decisions. Don’t you think it’s time you stop meddling?”
Once he returns to Sarah’s, he collapses into the guest bed and sleeps before his head hits the pillow.
Sherlock's eyes fall to the same spot, and it seems as much of a surprise to him as it does John. He pulls his hand away quickly and mumbles an apology.
John stretches his arms over his head. “Alright, then. Good luck with...the murder...typing...thing.” He stands.
It’s unclear to Sherlock, however, why he is reacting in such a manner. It is, after all, the perfect solution to their problems.
Decades later, when Sherlock and John are both in their eighties, they have kissed one another thousands of times.
“Oh! Let me see!” Sarah leans forwards to look. “I know her! She’s that bartender at the Strand—” she slumps back into her seat as the realisation hits. “—oh.”
I knew what I had to do. I knew that it was the only option to protect my loved ones from him. So I notified the court that I would no longer be testifying against him, and I constructed the plans for my death.
"By an eighth of a centimeter," Sherlock continues. "And that you fractured the second knuckle of your middle finger approximately fifteen years ago, but you didn't wear your splint as the doctor ordered, which is why it's crooked."
one know? He’s never been in love with anyone before, nor has he planned for the unlikely possibility.
“Sherlock.” John tugs at his sleeve—a simple action, but it’s both delicate and commanding; so intimate that it sends sparks flying through him.
Gabriela tosses John’s trousers at him, and he quickly begins to get dressed. “Wait, Sarah—“ he pauses. “Haven’t you been drinking?”
John stares back blankly, his mouth hanging open. “I… Sherlock. I haven’t got a clue what you're referring to. We haven’t talked about this, not once. I think I’d remember—“
It often begins as it does tonight. John, alone his flat after a long day of studying, hand wandering beneath his trousers as his mind wanders to William—the sensation of William’s fingers skimming over his neck. His sweaty stomach and slender hips. His soft moans and heavy breaths; his hardness and the warm, sticky release of their desire for one another.
Low murmurs rush through the officers standing by, and a few of them lift their guns towards Sherlock. He releases Mycroft's collar, and the elder brother signals for them to stand down. He exhales a long-suffering sigh and glances over to Lestrade.
The two women’s hips grind together in a dirty dance. Gabriela massages and squeezes Sarah’s naked arse, nearly obsessively. She pulls Sarah's dress up over her head, and her pink, hard nipples pop out, revealing that she's not wearing a bra, either.
”No. I desperately wanted you to move past this sexual dry spell of yours so that I could get back to work, but I could have achieved this in various other ways. I offered to be the one to help, however, because...because of, well, you know.”
For the next few days, Sherlock keeps with his routine of going home in the afternoon and returning to the hospital in the evening. Absurdly, he misses the hospital while he's away. He finds that he can hardly wait to get back there, and his heart bursts with excitement as he enters the building. It's very odd. Who on earth misses a hospital? Is there really any sort of appeal? He doesn't miss the smells, or the noises, or the irritating nurses—that much is certain.
He certainly doesn't seem like a police officer, John thinks. The police are public servants, and this man seems far more likely to have servants of his own. His uniform is pristine, pressed and perfectly tailored, from his shoes to the polished gun that hangs in its holster.
"Glad to be of service," John says, voice a bit husky. "Actually, would you like to lie down on the sofa? It may be more comfortable."
"Christ, Sherlock." John's voice is low as they walk side by side. "When you're deducing like that, I can barely contain myself. I just want to—“
The girls smile at him somewhat sadly, but say nothing as they walk down the dark staircase and back into the cold.
But I need you to swear that you will not try to find me. Because Moriarty is going to find me as well. And he will go for my heart, and then, he will go for my life. And he cannot,
And finally, Sherlock lays his head down next to John’s, and John wraps his arm around him, and he strokes and kisses his hair until they fall asleep.
John thinks for a moment. "I suppose I'm a bit claustrophobic. And I don't love crowded rooms. I get nervous when I'm unsure of an escape plan. How about you?"
"That's a shame. I suppose I'm lucky in that regard," Sherlock muses. "My family is relatively unproblematic. Even Mycroft, as intolerable as he is, is a good brother at times."
John singlehandedly pops open the lid and pours the lube messily over his fingers, sliding them down Sherlock's skin to the small of his back.
Molly shrugs. “Stretching the truth is part of the job, I guess. We’ve all lied about our identity in one way or another.”
. Pushing him playfully against the kitchen counter, murmuring into his ear. Combing his fingers through his hair, holding on to him and not letting go.
John clenches his jaw, sighs, and continues waiting patiently and helplessly until every other customer has been served. Finally. But rather than returning, William crouches behind the bar to retrieve a black wool coat and a pack of cigarettes.
"No. I would not." As of five seconds ago, Sherlock is giving John the silent treatment. This, from what he has gathered, is a great pillar of marriage.
“Love is quite the opposite,” Sherlock replies. “Love is clarity. It is quiet and blissful; it is permanence, and it is transcendence.”
"Oh," John exhales as he gives in to Sherlock's amorous advances, his shoulders colliding with the wall behind him.
And by the grace of everything holy and unholy, their conversation moves in another direction. They return to their drinks and laughs and fond glances, enjoying one another's company, as usual. But this time, it’s with knees and toes touching.
This is why, despite our closeness—and my skills of observation—he was able to murder five different women without me knowing.
"Thank you so much for inviting me to dinner, Molly!" Mrs. Hudson says as she takes a seat next to Sherlock. "I wasn't sure whether I ought to crash your party, but then Molly mentioned there was a new development between you and John? I simply couldn't miss out!"
Dear Commissioner. Have you figured it out yet? I’ve had plenty of fun with this, but murders are getting to be boring. Maybe I’ll chop off some poor sod’s toes and send them to the police, just for shits and giggles. Or maybe I’ll just steal the Crown Jewels. Either way, I’ll keep my knives sharp. Good luck! Yours truly, Moriarty.
"Don't pester me with logic, John!" Sherlock protests. "Ugh. I liked you better when you were unconscious."
John leans back onto his pillow, flashing Sherlock a glowing smile. Somehow, his smile is even more lovely when Sherlock can also see his abdominals.
He smashes a bunch of random numbers on the keypad, hoping his message will get deleted, and he slams his phone down. It doesn’t work, but that's fine. He doesn’t even remember leaving it until weeks later.
John’s skin tingles from head to toe. “Don’t stop.” He places both hands on the door in front of them, splaying his fingers over the cold, foggy glass. “Please. Don’t stop.”
Sherlock crinkles his forehead, half angry, but he doesn’t object. John walks to the kitchen to collect a bag of ice.
Sherlock then takes off his own shirt before working to remove the rest of their clothing and sealing their naked chests back together. He covers John in a deluge of kisses, and John releases stuttering sighs as his lips are consumed by Sherlock's.
That’s when John recalls last night—the sorrow in his eyes as he looked at him; the melancholy in his words as he spoke. "I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t mean to imply anything.”
Once Sherlock and John return to their flat, they remove their costumes and carry out their bedtime routine; it all happens much more silently than Sherlock would like.
Sherlock’s words are dizzying, but as he stammers and shifts in his seat, John can't help but admire another side of Sherlock he rarely sees—timid. It's rather adorable.
Instead, Sherlock grabs gently onto John's wrist and uses it to guide the spoon to his mouth. Holding it firmly in place, he bends forwards closer still, drawing his tongue to the tip of the utensil with a hum of satisfaction. He then brings his eyes to John’s, and with his pink tongue and his heart shaped lips he licks the spoon clean.
Gathering his wits and pulling his shirt back together, he spins on his knees to face the other man. "John," he repeats, his hand over his own mouth. He drops his voice to a furtive whisper. "We're kissing!"
When John realises what Sherlock is holding before him, his eyes become wide, and his mouth even wider.
John pulls away with a sharp inhale, bids him farewell, and returns to the bar to finish his Old Fashioned.
Sherlock glowers at the mere mention of this man, and John suddenly notes how similar the two of them look.
John climbs over him, placing his hands and legs on either side of Sherlock’s body. “Can I undress you, too? Or are you required to kick me somewhere first?"
Molly glances over at Donovan. “Sally. You mentioned you’ve done something like this before with your grandmother. Is what just happened...normal?”
John purses his lips and looks back up at Sherlock, apprehensive. He takes a deep breath. "You know how, sometimes, people say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die. Well, mine didn't, really. Not in the way you'd expect.”
But no matter what happens during their days, the two men find their way back together. Huddled beneath covers, tongues exploring every inch of skin. There is body heat and warm breaths and murmurs of happy things. Elbows and hip bones and collarbones sliding together; lips pressed into inner thighs and peaked nipples. Fingers wandering past hemlines, hands and mouths bringing shivering wet ecstasy night after night after night.
“Anyone who is perturbed about my friendship with John is not someone I want as a client. And I reiterate once again that my choice of clients is just that: mine. I consider some of your suggestions for what you call the ‘political good’ because of your position in the New Alliance, but it’s my right to refuse anyone I wish. Is that clear?”
“Unfortunately not the big theatre, darling. It will be a studio space, private property, you see, but it’s quite lovely. It seats about one hundred. I’m told that the highest officials in the land will be invited.”
Lo and behold, he laughs. Just a little. Then he sighs. “I did it because someone was threatening John. A very dangerous man. They were going to kill him, if I didn’t jump. I had to stop it. I’d have done anything to stop it. And I had to stay away, once it was done, to make sure I’d eradicated that man’s influence. But I had no idea how long it would take me, and how it would affect John. When I did come back, and I saw what I had done, I swore to make it up to him.”
John takes me out for dinner again. This is date number three – well, two and a half, I suppose. Third date is usually the ‘fuck or fuck off’ date. Though in my past, that was the standard for a first date for me. If a date didn’t end in an orgasm, I considered it a great failure.
“I don’t think I need the Serbian secret service to kill me,” John panted. “Think you’re going to manage it just fine on your own.”
“Will you excuse us, Gemma?” John said. “Ask Joni to fetch me if Rosie fusses.” He took a firm grasp of Sherlock’s sleeve, nearly yanking him away.
Texting notes: John’s are italicized, Sherlock’s are bolded, Fleabag’s are plain text and right aligned.
John could feel Sherlock’s stiff erection next to his, and he spat into his hand to give them a bit of lubrication. Sherlock’s skin was wet and slick, a slippery surface for him to touch and see the reactions echo back to him. He kissed the tears of laughter from Sherlock’s face as Sherlock tilted his head up to look in the mirror above them. John wondered what they looked like, if the sight was erotic or ridiculous, and found he didn’t care. He was with Sherlock, and Sherlock was his.
John slid the dresser drawer shut and sat down on the bed with a sigh. He didn’t have many possessions since he’d returned from Afghanistan, so it hadn’t taken long to move into 221B Baker Street. One box and one suitcase, with his gun and bullets carefully hidden in the bottom. He hadn’t allowed the cabbie to carry it for him. He had some books and papers stored at Harry’s, but he didn’t feel an urgent need to get them yet. If he was honest with himself, the cost of getting them – talking to Harry – was a bit high right now.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said quietly. John had still not looked at him, and another question was hanging in the air. After a long, long moment, John licked his lips.
There were many puzzled faces around the room at that proclamation, but John somehow, intrinsically understood.
John was too dazed to protest, and found himself propelled into the washroom. He stared at himself in the mirror, and despite his own blurry state of mind, he had to agree with Bahdri – he did look a mess. He turned on the water.
Sherlock’s fingers were already folding the paper back into its original shape of the tiny elephant. His hands were shaking. “So you came and – thank you.”
, and they could light up the sky, they’re glowing so much. Sherlock’s got his shoulders thrown back, proud, and he’s nearly vibrating. John lets go of Sherlock’s hand only long enough to put his hand on the small of his back as Sherlock steps up into the café.
“Ah yes,” the doctor said. “That isn’t looking very good either. Same sort of situation. There was an… incision.”
As the silence settled around them, John and Sherlock looked at one another. Sherlock looked both startled and worried, which made John's heart sink.
When Lestrade arrived at the greenhouse, he found the gardener, Jacol Seera, tied to a tree and with rope that Sherlock had fetched while John held the man at gunpoint. The gun, however, was now securely hidden, being illegal for citizens to own.
Sherlock’s heart fell. He could indeed put weight on the food, but Sherlock could already tell it was causing him even more pain. How much pain could one man be expected to take.
He tried to drift back off into blissful numbness, but the pounding in his head refused to allow him any such reprise. He shut his eyes more tightly and tried to focus on breathing, which had become a exceptionally unpleasant task that required rather more attention than it used. Then, all of the sudden, he was aware of a new pressure on his right arm and a soft voice near his right ear.
Sherlock thought about John's past love interests--all women. He thought back to every time John had loudly insisted he wasn't gay--usually when somebody had assumed he was romantically entangled with Sherlock. He thought back to John's anger with him over the past few days--to his outbursts and distance. And he knew just as clearly as he now knew his own feelings toward John that John did not reciprocate them.
"Fine then," John said, his tone nonchalant. "I suppose I could just leave then. Or perhaps I should tell Wizard Holmes about our deal?"
“An emergency?” Lestrade sounded as though he had just jumped up from his desk. “What’s wrong? Is John okay?”
"John? Sherlock?" they turned to toward a quiet voice in the darkness where the street lamps didn't illuminate the house.
Bursting into the room, they found Sherlock on the ground being attacked by both Alec and his father. Alec had his hands on Sherlock’s throat while Mr. Cunningham was twisting his wrist. The inspector pulled his gun, but with all the chaos, could not very well shoot without the possibility of hitting Sherlock too.
John raised an eyebrow and nodded curtly. The last thing he wanted was to encounter that thing again.
The creature was still for a breath. Then, without warning, it leapt toward Sherlock, its teeth bared and its arms, which ended in deadly looking claws, extended.
Sherlock leapt out of the way just in time to avoid the attack and the creature slammed into the wall with enough force to make the nearby window rattle.
They stared at one another for a long moment. Then they laughed. They laughed like they had the night they chased the taxi. They laughed like they weren’t in a tunnel fighting for their lives. They laughed like old friends.
"Yes," Sherlock said. "They were all isolated, just like our last victim. I expect they were chosen for that reason. Fewer people to notice their absence or to demand justice for their deaths. Our killer miscalculated on the last victim. Didn't expect the nephew to be interested in anything other than inheritance."
Once inside door, John leaned against the wall, taking in the smell of the place and savoring the moment. In this place, leaning in the exact spot he had leaned with Sherlock so long ago, in the middle of their first case, he felt enveloped and safe and happy.
When they reach room five, Sherlock has to pause to catch his breath again. The bed is covered in John’s blood, still fresh and gleaming. The chains dangle from the legs of the bed. Sherlock runs a hand through his hair, trying to block the images of what happened here from invading his mind again. He needed a clear head. He had a job to do. Being sentimental wasn’t going to help John and his life was clearly in danger every moment these psychopaths were loose.
"It would be my luck to have come to the house, not only of a wizard, but a possessed fire," he murmured to the fire.
“Oh,” Moriarty said dismissively, “and do be careful of the wire, Johnny. It is very sharp. That stuff can cut right through you like paper.”
“I can’t believe I didn’t realize it sooner,” he said. “But I think he was disguising his voice. It all makes sense though. How he knew about…”
That caught his attention. Why though? It was surprising and worrying, but he couldn’t figure out why. Who was calling him? Who would it surprise him to hear the word please from?
The A&E had been all confusion and frustration and anger for Sherlock. He had shouted abuse at nurses and doctors and anybody in his path until they had threatened to expel him from the premises, only relenting when Lestrade interceded on his behalf.
"It appears there may be," Sherlock said. "Be ready in ten minutes. I'm going to gather out supplies."
He had seen terrible things in his life that would have haunted others, but had never bothered him. Things that would make other people ill had left him unmoved. But the sight that greeted him when the rescue workers removed the rubble from John's lower body had left him feeling cold and weak. The memory of it still did.
He worked his way quickly up the ranks and found great success. He was beginning to truly believe he might just escape his fate when everything came crashing down. Injured and unable to continue his duties, John was sent back to Ingary to find his father had become ill (the healer said it was a liver disease). John spent the next few months tending to his father, until he finally passed away, leaving John alone with the clinic to accept, once and for all, his fate.
Now that he was sitting atop him, Sherlock could feel John getting hard beneath him. He felt his own member hardening as he continued to massage John’s neck with his tongue and feel John’s stomach with his hand. John squirmed deliciously under him. They maintained this arrangement for what seemed like a blissful eternity.
"That isn't why I value you, John," Sherlock said finally, his voice soft and full of wonder, as though he had just come to a conclusion on a case. "John, I value you for a thousand different reasons, not just because you happened to do a decent job of running around London after criminals. Your value to me does not reside in your usefulness to me. I value you because of who you are, not because of what your transport can do."
"That's graving," Sherlock said. "Used on ships. But not just any ships. Old ships with wooden sheathing rather than the more common copper sheathing."
He retrieved the discarded scarf and began applying pressure to John’s shoulder. John moaned slightly, but it was difficult to hear.
“Things…” he finished softly. “Why he targeted us. Why he seemed so intent on killing me. I was dreaming and it just all clicked. The name even makes sense now. It was a the code name of a mission we went on. I saw him in my dream and I knew.”
When John got back down to the street, he found Sherlock waiting in the carriage. He got in and asked where they were going now.
He stared at the shocking image silently for what felt like an eternity. It must, in fact, have been several long moments, because Dr. Azarian shifted, drawing John's attention back to him.
Sherlock is too perplexed to move for a moment. He feels something on his cheek and reaches up to find tears again rolling down his face.
"You promised I could remain undercover," she growled. "The longer I stay out here, the more likely it is I'll be spotted."
Sherlock lost his voice again. What was he supposed to do? He couldn’t take the chance that Sebastian would kill John right in front of him. But he couldn’t… There was no way he could watch that sadist…
He saw a figure in front of him, backing away as another entered the room and began approaching him slowly. The second figure's hands, clearly visible, were held aloft in a nonthreatening gesture.
"I understand deary," the fire said, a touch of sadness to her voice. "I might be able to help you with that."
And he began the slow ascent up the stairs, one step at a time, Sherlock at his side, talking as they went about Lestrade's last case (boring) and John's last blog entry (missed the point entirely) and his last experiment (fascinating--and probably horribly messy from the sound of it).
Sherlock ran a hand through his disheveled hair, cursing the lack of shower accommodations in the middle of the forest. He hated camping. It was dirty (something he didn’t much mind, if it served a purpose), unpredictable, and uncomfortable. As much as he hated to admit it, he highly valued a comfortable bed and, of course, a shower.
"Our killer murders her victims almost exactly every three days," Sherlock said. "If I am correct -- and I always am -- we will find the murderer at the ship tonight with her next victim."
Sherlock didn’t raise his head. He knew John was just trying to make him feel better. Of course he was. Here he was, barely conscious with multiple serious injuries and he was trying to make Sherlock feel better. But there wasn’t much of a choice. He sighed and sat back, pushing himself far enough away from John to give him room to maneuver.
"Oh, it's okay," Irene rubbed a hand down Harry's arm and John felt himself begin to shake with anger. "I'm sure this will only take a moment."
The figure approached and John gripped his cane tighter, ready to fight if he needed. But when the figure came into full view, he relaxed his grip and tried to smile -- rather unsuccessfully.
The process took an excruciatingly long time, but John was determined. He worked steadily and without rest. It hurt Sherlock to watch. He wanted to help more than he had ever wanted anything (well, except wanting to torture and kill this Scarecrow lunatic). But John didn’t need his help. After what seemed like an eternity, John was standing on his good leg, his back pressed firmly against the wall, his good arm anchoring himself to it.
“I’m going to kill you,” Sherlock yelled at the screen. “Both of you! Slowly. I’ll make sure you suffer.”
“John suffered a broken ilium,” the doctor continued. “There was severe nerve damage and substantial blood loss. It is too early to tell, but John is at risk of infection in the area. We’ll be monitoring that closely.”
As they moved across it in the direction of the window, Sherlock fell back until he and John were the last of the group. Near the foot of the bed was a small square table, on which stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it, Sherlock, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces, and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room.
The shot came suddenly, ringing out loudly in the small room and causing Sherlock to jump. He desperately examined John’s body, which was convulsing in pain. Alive then. He was alive. Thank God!
Sherlock concentrated. There was a distant sound he could just barely make out—a street. It had been late when he and John had been drugged. Effects of being drugged were likely to last anywhere from a few minutes to four hours. So, it was likely early morning, but Sherlock could still hear cars.
Richard led them through shelves and shelves of books--more books than John had ever seen in his life--finally stopping at one and running his hands along the spines. After a moment, he pulled one down and motioned for them to follow.He led them to a small table and sat at one of the chairs, opening the book in front of him.
"I wouldn't know," Mrs. Hudson said. "I've never seen him with anybody, but he certainly has the power to be charming when he wants to be. I don't think he would every be serious about anybody though. He's quite heartless, you know."
The stick came loose with a jerk, sending John sprawling backward onto the ground. Groaning, John pushed himself up and looked at the bush, expecting to find the stick. What he found, instead, was a rather ragged looking scarecrow, the end of which had been sticking out of the bush.
Sherlock couldn’t argue with that. John had been stuck in a hospital bed for nearly three weeks and he was so restless even he was snapping at nurses now. He needed to come home. He needed to be back at 221B.
“It was Major Sholto,” John says, astonishment clear in his voice. “I never hear from him. He’s more of a recluse than you. Hardly ever talks to anyone.”
"John hasn't realized," Sherlock explained. "I... I should be the one who tells him. Give me a bit of time after he wakes to prepare him."
Sherlock's eyes snapped back to him and, to his shame, he could tell that Sherlock could see his exhaustion and pain. He nodded once.
“So, Dr. Watson,” the voice asked lightly, “What will it be? Truth or dare? Remember now. You only have three truths.”
He watched the light show for a few moments, but could see neither the woman nor Sherlock making any actual progress, so he moved his way behind the woman. Then, when a flash went off, John took his cane and hit her square in the head.
Sherlock smiled. "Simple. Your haircut and the way you hold yourself says military. You were on your way to the herb shop, so healer. Obvious. Your face is tan, but no tan above the wrist. You've been abroad, but not sunbathing. You've sustained an injury to your shoulder -- you hold it stiffly and favor your other arm. So, war, desert, injury -- Zanzib."
The lights on the stage came up and there was some motion. Sherlock ignored this, concentrating on John.
Sherlock let out the breath he had been holding. He had anticipated this, but hearing it from John’s doctor…
Sherlock calculated. Two more truths. But after the last one… Well, Sherlock was almost more afraid of the truths than the dares. And he still wanted John to have those. This was the seventh round, so if he chose dare, John could take the last two rounds as truth. That would leave only one more dare.
Sherlock stopped the carriage in the middle of the city and got out, telling John to wait for him. John watched as Sherlock moved to a clearly homeless individual and leaned against the wall next to her. They spoke for a moment, then Sherlock handed her some money and moved back to the carriage.
As soon as he had been satisfied that John was in no immediate danger and Dr. Azarian was examining him, Sherlock had found the nurse.
Sherlock’s head pounded. It was quiet wherever he was, but every tiny sound was seemingly magnified tenfold. He could hear his own breathing, somebody else’s breathing, distant footsteps, a mechanical noise. Thinking hurt. It was like wading through water. He tried to remember what had brought him to this state, but it was so hard…
“There’s nothing more the hospital can do for me at this point,” John argued. “I’ll do better at home. I’ll be careful to monitor my symptoms and come back if anything goes awry.”
"More powerful and complex spells, however," Sherlock continued, picking up the papers and shuffling until he found a particular one, "contain several elements, including mixtures of ingredients, gestures, sigils, and chants."
I'm sorry I can't stay. I wanted to give you my watch. Something to remember me by. I do miss you so. I'll come back again as soon as I can to visit you.
John heard his name as though through water, but even so he could tell the urgency in the tone. Who was it calling him? Why couldn’t he just stay floating here?
“John,” he said as John began once again attempting to position the crutch on the step. “That’s not going to work. We have to do something else.”
Sherlock and Colonel Hayter jumped out of the car, but John was having some trouble. Sherlock moved over to help him get out. His leg was clearly causing him pain, but he said nothing. He just accepted Sherlock’s help, avoiding his gaze.
