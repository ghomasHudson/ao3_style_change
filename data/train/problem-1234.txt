Either way, it wouldn’t be long before Watson became too suspicious to take any instruction from him at all. Holmes had taken to skipping all meals with him, staying out later than Watson was wont to stay awake, meeting with him only briefly in the mornings to discuss the proceedings of the day and accept his notes from the day before. It was not sustainable, but then, neither was he.
well the instant he laid eyes on Holmes, but to inquire further had thankfully never been in his nature.
But this particular absence was not the letup it should have been. Nothing about Holmes’s departure sat right with him, from the fact that he should have stayed home to try and recover, to the strangeness of their last moments together.
Holmes opened his mouth to reply and coughed up three juvenile rosebuds into his handkerchief instead.
The individual pieces came together in a way that pitted Watson’s medical expertise against his equally practiced knowledge of Holmes. It hardly seemed possible; Holmes had never spoken of anyone, ever. Had he? Or had he mentioned someone in passing, and Watson simply failed to take note? Perhaps it wasn’t Holmes he would find here at all, and this wreckage belonged to someone else entirely.
The morning of the fourth day, Watson found himself staring at Holmes’s desk, absently chewing the tip of his thumb.
A fierce, heaving fit sent Holmes forward again to his knees, and he pulled out three roses on their thorny stems, one after the other, unable to stifle the pained sob which followed. He spit blood as Watson caressed his back, and with his other hand on his chest, eased him again to sitting. Holmes clung to his fingers, and Watson couldn’t determine if the tears were from the force of his coughing spell or from his own grief.
“What happened to him?” he said, trying and failing to cover his frustration. “How can you stay here when you know he needs help? Why did you wait so long to tell me?”
“I have given you nothing,” Holmes said. “There is nothing to give.” His tone became once more collected and measured, his manner returning to something resolutely withdrawn. “You deserve a happy life with someone who can freely offer all those gentle, picturesque things. That is not my love.”
And yet, Holmes’s handwriting stared back at him. He took a shallow breath, reached to pick it up, turned it over and extracted the folded paper inside.
He coughed once more into his napkin, a new petal joining the last, both hidden away again in a matter of seconds. He didn’t look across the table; he knew already what he would see.
“The unreturned affection,” Holmes repeated again, the meaning of the words sinking in even as he fought to repudiate them. Implausible as it seemed, the appositeness was, well. Evident, inarguable. Damning.
“And that was when I noticed the water damage along the baseboard near the fireplace,” Watson said over dinner in their Baker Street sitting room that night. “The housekeeper insisted there had been a vase spilled, but the damage suggested something more than a one-time accident. I think you’ll agree when you see it-- you are coming tomorrow, aren’t you?”
“You’re very generous,” said Holmes, tying his scarf around his throat and putting his hat back on. “And you’ve been a great help already. I will be most appreciative of your discretion.”
“I would not wish for you to live with anything so regrettable, my dear boy,” he said, keeping his eyes fixed on the opposite wall, “but you put me in an impossible position. You should not have come.”
It was one facet of this ordeal which Holmes had, up to now, pointedly ignored. This would be hard on Watson, but he was at least already practiced at moving on. His bereavement after Holmes’s final confrontation with the late Professor Moriarty had extended beyond the anticipated time frame, but it was unlikely a reprise would have the same effect. At least this time there would be incontrovertible proof of his demise; that was, supposedly, an aid to the grieving process. He would recover and be better for it, without the continuous trials of--
He reached out, taking a fistful of Holmes’s shirt, anchoring him to his spot as though without a hand on him he might disappear.
Holmes moved to rest his palm on Watson's cheek, and Watson leaned into it, letting his eyes fall shut.
No, if he wanted information, if there was information to be had at all, there was only one other person on this Earth who might have it. Watson closed his eyes and inhaled, drawing in the strength to push himself to his feet again. He tucked the letter carefully into his breast pocket and carried himself to the door, down the stairs, out onto Baker Street, his thoughts trailing somewhere just behind him as if they were not his own.
, had but one known origin -- it all at once made absolute sense why he’d been reluctant to discuss it, why, in his dogmatic devotion to logic, he had decided not to trouble anyone with it, when it had no remedy.
Three days at Baker Street without Holmes might have been pleasant under different circumstances. Of course he loved having Holmes there -- but, then, that was just it. He would have thought by that point he’d be used to the constant gnawing in the pit of his stomach day in and day out, that it would be second nature to hold his tongue, to stay his hand, but it felt more like keeping in a breath for far too long. Having the occasional day or two to exhale seemed to prevent him from… well, he wasn’t quite sure what. Tearing his hair out, falling into hysterics, saying something impossibly, irrevocably foolish.
The Galway Manor case was by no means the first one Watson had solved almost entirely on his own, though usually when Holmes challenged him to employ his methods so independently, there was still some amount of regular follow-up. Holmes had been uncommonly absent throughout the entire ordeal. Holmes had been uncommonly absent in general, really, even when he was there, standing in front of him, listening to summaries he should have asked for but strangely did not. He was occupied, Watson told himself. There was some other matter capturing his attention, and when he was ready to tell about it, he would. That had always been his way; there was never any use trying to pry information out of him when he was unwilling.
of it was still intriguing. That a condition might be stress induced was reasonable; that this exact source of stress, and no other, was required to produce these effects was less so. How could the brain, the body, differentiate so precisely between despair caused by unanswered devotion and, say, grief over the death of a lover? In either case, there is the matter of a broken heart, of irreparable separation from one’s desire. And how, too, was such a coalescence of flesh and flora possible to begin with? The biology of it was mystifying. But, then, that had always been Watson’s area. Maybe whatever remained of him once this had run its course would be useful to the examination of it.
Either way, all evidence suggested he’d readily accepted this fate, if not chosen it willingly. The idea of it burned in Watson’s chest; of all the selfish, careless--
“Yes, certainly, please,” Dr. Barbary said, his demeanor turning notably more serious as he took Holmes’s elbow and led him to his office.
“Good morning,” he said to the butler who answered, turning briefly away to cough into his arm. “I’m here to see Dr. Barbary, if he’s in.”
He knew before he ever accepted, of course, that the burglar was their client’s daughter. She had gone, presumably, to study abroad, but it was obvious she’d never left London at all. The young man who had introduced himself as her sponsor was clearly her lover, when he abandoned her she was too ashamed to return home and fell into the opium dens, periodically resorting to burgling her mother’s jewelry box in order to support herself. Watson would doubtlessly arrive at the same conclusion in a matter of a day or two, but that was enough time for what Holmes needed to do.
“You can what? Fetch my would-be lover, convince them to have a change of heart here in the middle of this--” His protest was stopped short by a fresh surge of petals, spit crudely onto the floor beside him.
Watson frowned. It was, as far as he knew the man, rather unlike Mycroft to be glad to receive anyone.
“It shakes you like it might be something else,” Watson snapped back. “For heaven’s sake, what good is living with a doctor if you never let him help you?”
Mycroft watched him for a few seconds longer before rising from his seat and walking to his desk. “Where will you go?”
I’ve spent by your side, and you think I need to pretend to understand you? When you left the last time, I felt my soul torn in half. I felt dismembered, limping through my days like an amputee, thinking I’d never be whole again. That is what you are to me, Sherlock. I have
Watson should have stopped him, asked questions, tried, at least, to get something out of him. Anything. Where was he going? What would he do when he arrived? What did he need to accomplish before he could come home? If Holmes hadn’t meant to worry him, why did it feel like he’d gone well out of his way to do just that?
“Of course, you may rely on it,” said Barbary. “Good luck, Mr. Holmes. I hope she sees what she’s missing.”
control -- namely, not leaving the good doctor with an efflorescent corpse to haul out of Baker Street.
Mycroft’s eyes widened momentarily at the sight of them, but his expression remained otherwise blessedly neutral as he shut the door behind them and immediately poured two glasses of brandy.
“Indeed,” agreed the doctor with a sympathetic laugh of his own. “In that case, I can tell you this much: I don’t know if there is a single agreed upon name for the condition; in symposiums I’ve attended, I have heard it called the flowering cough. It’s classified as both a respiratory malady and a psychological one.”
The implication was clear, but it seemed impossible nonetheless. Not because he thought Holmes couldn’t love -- nothing as unkind as that -- nor even because he thought Holmes couldn’t love him, specifically, although the revelation sent Watson’s heart climbing into his throat. No, it seemed impossible for the sole reason that this disease required the exact psychological conditions of absolute despair.
“I cannot sit back and watch you-- watch… this,” he said. “Please. Don’t force me to live with that.”
But the scene coalesced in a single moment of perfect, sickening clarity as he set his eyes at last on his friend.
Holmes removed his gloves, accepting the handshake with a warm grin. “Very good to see you, Dr. Barbary,” he said, “but I’m afraid I’m on rather a tight schedule this morning.”
doctor, that regardless of anything else Watson felt, he regularly demonstrated a vested interest in Holmes’s wellbeing, even when Holmes himself could not. It was and had always been a privilege to know Watson’s care and attention. On days like this one, however, that satisfaction was routinely chased with admonition. Watson offered his friendship in good faith and trust; to wish for more was ungrateful at best and vulgar at worst, and yet day after day, year after year, Holmes found himself doing just that. Most of the time it was nothing more than wallpaper in the background of his mind, all-encompassing but not imposing; other times it was the only worthwhile concept in the entirety of the universe.
“John,” he said, falling back against the wall with a bitter huff of a laugh. He drew his knees to his chest and closed his eyes, twisting the stem of a surprisingly intact rose between his fingers.
“Quite so, yes. You can imagine there has not been much opportunity to study it, but all accounts share that commonality.”
And then there was the matter of that cough. Watson was used to obstinacy from him just as much as his other patients, but although Holmes had insisted he was suffering from a mere seasonal cold, they both knew that wasn’t quite true. It was his way to regularly refuse examination; any suggestion of treatment more involved than a cup of tea was roundly rejected. His routine was to use himself, run himself into the ground, allow Watson to ferry him off to the country for some interval of convalescence, then return to work and do it again. It was, in truth, the hardest part of loving him.
“My dear Watson,” Holmes replied, taking some measure to soften his tone, “you help me plenty enough as it is. I promise if there is anything you can do, you will be the first to hear about it.”
anyone else to know me as you do. I want you to come home, and I want you to stay, and if you cannot stay then I want to leave with you. But you must believe me.”
But this wasn’t that. For one, there was no Moriarty, there was no crime syndicate, there wasn’t even some new subject of study into which Holmes had thrown himself to the neglect of everything else, as he was prone to do. It was just a silence, impenetrable and relentless.
Standing in the foyer in wait for Mycroft Holmes, Watson tried to bring himself to a center. He clutched the envelope and set his focus on steadying his hand, on deciding what to say and how to say it without completely losing his grip. Should he have been angry, assuming that Mycroft knew of this and said nothing? Did Mycroft owe him that at all?
He thought of a cigarette case, delicately etched with floral motifs, polished silver reflecting the sunlight, elegant and personal, reduced to a simple paperweight.
Holmes said nothing, but hid a fleeting smile in his coffee cup. On better days, these were the moments he allowed himself the private satisfaction of thinking of Watson as
Holmes studied Dr. Barbary’s face, knowing well already that he would find none of the mockery or deception he hoped for. Sympathy, some; curiosity, moreso. And honesty, open faced and sincere. If the information was false, if Barbary was mad, it only meant there was more research to be done. Holmes had a sick feeling it was not.
Lestrade looked up at Sherlock and was taken back by what he saw. Sherlock had a large bruise on his face. The angry mark stood out against his skin. It was clearly a fresh mark and looked like the result of a slap to the face. Lestrade could just make out the lines of fingers. Someone had slapped him hard.
The next few days were very relaxing for Sherlock. John still guilty for shoving him. He didn’t complain when Sherlock left dirty dishes in the sink and forgot to order take away. Sherlock felt bad for taking advantage of the situation but he wasn’t to blame for starting the fight. John
To his surprise, Sherlock didn’t pull away from his touch. He half expected his mate to pull away from his touch. Sherlock allowed his lover to wrap his fingers around his arm. He wanted John to touch him in a soft loving way.
“Of course,” Sherlock said standing up. “I’ve got to do a little running around. I’m going to solve this.”
John quickly jumped back to his feet and ran into the kitchen. Sherlock shook his head as sat up. He didn’t think he was really hurt. He had just banged his elbow up a bit. He got to his feet and sat down in his chair.
Sherlock knew he was in trouble. He had received a call from Rosie's nursery alerting him that she was ill and needed to be picked up. The detective did everything he could to go there but was unable to get a cab. In the end, he had taken the tube part of the way and then taken a bus the rest of the way. By the time he got there, John had already picked Rosie up.
Sherlock held the ice pack to his face as he watched John walk out of the sitting room and into the kitchen.
“Things like this don’t just happen,” John said not believing the words that were coming out of Sherlock’s mouth. “Sherlock this is wrong. I should never hurt you this way.”
His boyfriend expected him to pick Rosie up when it was needed. After all, his work schedule was more flexible than John’s schedule.
After Sherlock gave him the address he put his mobile away and closed his eyes. She was dead. She was only nineteen and it appeared she’d been beaten to death. Normally, Sherlock wouldn’t be affected by it. He would simply clean up the mess and move on to the next case.
Why couldn’t he just be a good boyfriend? Why couldn’t he just do what he was told? Why was he such as waste?
It was the second ice pack he had to use on his boyfriend to treat damage he had caused. John quickly put the ice pack in the sink. He couldn’t stand to hold it anymore. It was a reminder of what he had done, of the monster he had become.
John allowed Sherlock to let go of him and rise to his feet. The detective handed him the ice pack before heading off to get ready for a night out. Despite how cold the ice pack was it felt like it was burning John’s hands.
Mrs. Hudson chuckled at the change of subject. She knew she wouldn’t be able to hide anything from him.
“Are you hurt?” the detective inspector said. “You’re limping pretty bad there. Has John looked at that?”
He couldn’t make it too obvious or John would see right through it. He decided to stop doing the dishes since that was John’s pet peeve. He did things he really needed to do, like caring for Rosie but he tried to leave a trail of unfinished chores behind him.
The doctor felt horrible about what he had done. It was made worse the next day. The electric company called and explained the text had been a mistake. He had attacked his boyfriend over a mistake. He had
Two weeks later Sherlock was fully healed and running around like his injury had never happened. It made John so happy to him fully healed again. Things could finally get back to normal. He would never hurt Sherlock again.
After hours of phone calls Sherlock was sure he knew where Seether Divis was. His homeless network had finally found her or at least someone they believed to be her.
He leaned over the edge of the trash can and looked inside. His hands trembled slightly as he bent over the edge. He knew was he was about ready to see and he wasn't sure he was ready.
Sherlock put his hand on the sideboard as he rose to his feet. He tried to put some weight on his injured foot and hissed with pain. He knew it would heal in a few days but he was going to have a hard time getting around until then.
To his surprise, John didn’t rush to his side as he normally did. He just stood there glaring at him with true anger in his eyes. As he stood there looking at Sherlock his eyes began to soften. After a moment he quickly dropped to Sherlock’s side.
“You wouldn’t listen to me,” Sherlock said closing his book. “You don’t listen to me anymore at all.”
Sherlock had dove into his missing person case. He could tell his partner was hoping to find Seether alive. When Sherlock returned home with a depressed look on his face John knew what had happened. They had found Seether but she was dead.
It was a bit wrong for John to expect so much of him. Sherlock wasn’t the type to sit at home quietly and raise a family. He loved him and Rosie but he still needed to have his own life. It would take Sherlock time to get used to family life. John hadn’t given him that time.
He found Sherlock was sitting up in their bed reading a book. Sherlock glanced up for a second but quickly looked back down at his book. John glanced away as well. There was no way he wanted to look his lover in the eye. The doctor had caused him pain in a way he should never have.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know that doesn’t make it better but I am. I don’t know why I’m lunged out at you but I am going to stop.”
John was always a loving and caring people but was different when John felt guilty. During that week their lovemaking was much more intimate. John normally liked him on his hands and knees. After Sherlock was injured he changed it up. The good doctor didn’t want him “stressing” his arm. He put him on his side and pushed into him from behind. It had felt so nice to be pressed up against each other with one of John’s arms wrapped around his waist. The doctor kissed the top of his head as he rocked inside of him.
“I’ll call,” John said. “Let me help you. I’ll call the theater and see if they still have tickets. If they don’t we’ll think of something else. It isn’t a big deal.”
Sherlock sighed and shook his head. He had a feeling it wasn’t going to end well for the girl in question.
“There you are,” Lestrade said as he entered the house. “Where have you been? I called like an hour ago.”
John quickly fetched the laptop for Sherlock and handed it to them. He had only been dating Sherlock for a few months and he had already physically hurt him twice. He had never been abusive with any of his other partners. Why was he lunging out at Sherlock?
Suddenly John gave him a shove. John was strong and heavy and though it didn’t look like much the detective hadn’t been expecting the burst of force which knocked him to the ground. He gave a cry of surprise as he tumbled to the floor. Sherlock yelped at his elbow came into contact with the hard floor.
A case. Three days later Sherlock was called off on a case. A missing woman and a dead hedgehog. Sherlock was excited about the case. It was the first interesting one in weeks. Yet, his foot was still killing him. He really didn't like the idea of being on it. Whenever he stepped on it a wave of pain would shoot through this foot.
“That roommate was on a vacation to visit her sick mother,” Sherlock explained. “That gave the boyfriend a chance to get in. He was invited in. No sign of a break-in. The hedgehog was poisoned. I don’t believe he poisoned the girl. The forensics team found traces of blood in the flat. It seems the boyfriend went through a lot of trouble to clean the flat.”
He allowed himself to lean against his lover. He knew the new few weeks would be easy but he was scared of what would come after that.
John quickly rushed into the room carrying an ice pack. He put it so Sherlock’s face and held it there. He frowned at the bruise that was already forming. He felt guilty for not just hitting his lover but putting him in an uncomfortable position.
Sherlock didn’t wait for Greg to reply to his statement. He quickly rushed out of the restaurant before Greg could push the issue anymore.
John was changing the bandages twice a day and kept checking it for infection. It was healing fine but slowly. The doctor expected that it would take another week before it was fully healed.
Sherlock had no way to hide the bruise on his face. He thought of hiding it with makeup but thought better of it. What if he didn’t do a good job? If Lestrade thought he was trying to hide a bruise he might get suspicious.
John was walked around the flat angrily cleaning it up. Sherlock frowned as his lover picked up Rosie’s toys and dropped them into a basket.
Sherlock took a deep breath and leaned against the wall. He pulled out his mobile phone and dialed Lestrade’s number. The detective inspector picked up after a few rings.
Sherlock wasn’t expecting what came next. His lover crossed the small room and stuck him hard across the face. The sound of John’s hand slapping across his face was the only thing he can hear. The detective let out a cry as he fell to the floor.
Sherlock was a bit taken back by John’s intense mood. The doctor was beyond angry with him. He knew he had every right to be angry with him. After all, it as his job to help out with Rosie. Yet, he wasn’t being reasonable. Sherlock couldn’t help the fact he couldn’t get a cab. He really didn’t like being called a liar.
John never wanted to see that look on Sherlock’s eyes again. He wouldn’t allow it. He would help Sherlock heal and then things would be better. He had to stop letting his bad days get to him. Sherlock wasn’t trying to get a rise out of him. He was just as busy as he was. He
Sherlock picked up his laptop and looked at his reflection in the dark screen. His face was going to bruise. He needed to think of a way to explain that. He was going to see Lestrade in the morning. He would want to know what happened.
“Come on,” John said with a snort. “‘I’ve seen you catch a cab during a snowstorm. Don’t give me that!”
Sherlock dropped his book and pulled his boyfriend in for a hug. This was what he enjoyed. The long hugs and soft kisses.
Sherlock was determined to find Seether. He’d been looking for her for weeks. His homeless network had been on it day and night. He was sure she was being held somewhere. At least that was what he hoped. It would mean she was still alive.
It was nearly three weeks before John lost it. Sherlock was almost ready to give up when John approached him. The detective had just put the little one down for a nap and was in the kitchen getting ready to do dishes. They were going to need some for dinner and it would be there soon.
John decided he needed to talk to his boyfriend. He needed to know how Sherlock was feeling. He was so scared he’d done internal damage. He knew Sherlock didn’t want to speak with him but he was going to have to force the conversation.
He wouldn’t do it again. Sherlock didn’t deserve to be put through what he was putting him through. He wouldn’t allow it to happen again.
“I’m so sorry,” John said. “I was just stressed. The clinic is so busy and I had to leave. My boss was a bit annoyed with me.”
Sherlock quickly forced the thought from his head. He did not want to go there. His past was locked away and he didn’t need to deal with it.
His pale eyes went wide in confusion and pain of what just transpired. On instinct, he pulled away from John’s hand going to help him up. Shame filled John as his lover pulled away. It wasn’t like him to shy away from his touch.
“I’m... fine.” But John hears the effort it takes him to breathe evenly. He can sense that Sherlock is nowhere near to being fine.
“Wait a second... is the Queen still alive? And who’s the president of the United States? Oh god, I can’t believe I’ve missed the last ten years of my life!”
Outside, the cloudless black sky allows John to see the stars from afar. He stares out of the window, purposefully ignoring the person sitting next to him.
“Oh yes, you did,” John said. He was smiling at their daughter. At Sherlock’s curious expression he added: “She helped me set this up.”
“I haven’t? I’m meeting an old friend from Bart’s. I ran into him the other day and he asked me about getting a drink after work sometime. I thought I’d said.”
“I will find your wife,” I hear Sherlock say. He makes it sound like a fact. I look over at him shortly, hoping desperately that he’s got a plan and it’s not just his above-average self-confidence talking.
“The fingerprints are definitely on the buttons 3, 4 and 7.” Suddenly the slight smile on his face disappears and he looks up as if just remembering something very important yet disappointing, which he probably does.
“John, you know that I deleted most information about the solar system. Does it really surprise you that I do not happen to know some infamous person who does sports for a living?” He responds.
When the worried woman in front of him opens her mouth to protest, John lifts a hand to interrupt. “I’m sure because he’s never been to Africa or South America, and neither has anyone in his immediate environment. He hasn’t left England in the last decade; he doesn’t show any indication of jaundice. And, most importantly, his blood work came back this morning – all clear. Justin has got a regular flu. I recommend a symptomatic medication and he should be fine by next week.”
He couldn’t look into those eyes. He couldn’t see the pain he had caused. John had simply asked him for one thing. One thing! All he had to do was make one phone call and he couldn’t do that.
“We got tickets!” John said walking back into the sitting room a few minutes later. “They had a group cancel so they have plenty of tickets.”
“I’m sorry I don’t have any clothes for her here,” he whispers. We’re both standing next to the crib, watching Rosie, who is already half asleep.
“I’m sorry, should I come closer? I believe with old age comes bad vision,” Sherlock said and moved away from the doorframe and closer to John.
Suddenly he realises that John expects him to answer, so he quickly looks in the opposite direction while replying: “I don’t think you do.”
Sherlock opens his eyes, probably just noticing that John had even left. He doesn’t say anything though, his eyes piercing into John.
It was the last thing Mary ever said to me. Well, not technically, because that was my imagination of her. But I feel like it’s what Mary would’ve said if she knew.
The expression on their daughter’s face made John certain that the next four weeks would already have been worth it. With wide eyes, Rosie leaned over the table to take a closer look at their joined hands.
“… and…” I sigh. This is tougher than I thought. I look up at Sherlock and stare into his deep green eyes. For some reason he looks more vulnerable than ever. Does he really not know?
“Merry Christmas. To both of you,” Sherlock adds with a look over John’s shoulder. There’s a smile on Mary’s face that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
Rushing out the door, John checks his watch again. He’s already late for Paddington station, where he’s supposed to meet Sherlock. Mary isn’t home from work, yet, so John decides to text her from the train.
“Yeah, well. That was how I first met him. He’s really not at all how he’s described in the papers. He’s –“ John’s thoughts wander to Sherlock for a moment and he feels his face turning into a grin – “Brilliant.”
When he rocks her back and forth to try and stop her from sobbing, I can’t help but think back to what Mrs. Hudson told me at the therapist’s house.
I follow him down the stairs and out into the night. It has gotten incredibly cold and dark and I’m very thankful for my coat. We walk in silence. Since I do not know where we’re going, I let Sherlock take the lead when the road gets too narrow for the two of us. He has turned his coat collar up against the wind, which makes him look more mysterious than he is probably aware of. After a couple of minutes, I realise where Sherlock is leading me. St James Northumberland Street. This is the street of Angelo’s restaurant, if I recall correctly. We never came here again after that first night. Gosh, that seems like a lifetime ago, when in reality it’s only been… a year? The thought hits me like a train. It was on the 30th of January, one year ago tomorrow, which makes today the one-year anniversary of mine and Sherlock’s first meeting. I can’t believe that I forgot. I look over at Sherlock and my mind starts swirling. Does he know? Is this why he wanted to go out tonight? I try to search for a sign in his expression, but all I can see are his dark eyes staring forward to the restaurant we are approaching.
“Gavin Lestrade. He’s a man and good at it.” It slowly dawns on me that Sherlock, although the most intelligent man I’ve ever met, might be more ignorant than I thought.
Sherlock tightens the grip on the monocular telescope in his coat pocket. For some reason the cold metal has a comforting effect. He desperately needs a case, so he takes out the phone he bought yesterday on a whim and calls Mycroft before he has the chance to make up his mind.
Mary died last autumn. It’s not even been half a year, and yet I haven’t seen her in three weeks. I saw Sherlock almost the whole two years he was gone, and I wonder why that’s different now. Maybe it’s because I matured or because I’m too occupied with Rosie and everything else. When Sherlock was dead, I had no one for a long time. Or until I started dating Mary, to be precise. Now I have my beautiful daughter and Sherlock and Mrs Hudson and Molly and Greg. It’s weird that these people’s presence in my life seems to be connected to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock shifts at the mention of John. Miller seems to know a great deal more than the public, seeing as John and Sherlock kept the nature of their relation private.
John rolls his eyes at his phone, before slipping it back into his pocket. He looks up at Mary, who has just prepared his favourite pasta for lunch, and bites his lips. Usually, he’s able to ignore these sorts of texts from Sherlock quite well, but after the woman’s death two weeks ago John wants to be there for him as much as possible.
“John, really, there’s no need to thank me. You’re my husband; I promised to always be there for you and love you in good and bad times; and I intend to keep that promise.”
I realise with slight panic that I have been doing it again. I clear my throat and apologise, assuring the woman and her son that I was just daydreaming. Before I let the next patient enter, I run my wrists under the cold water of the examination room sink. I’m feeling nauseous again. It happens almost everytime I allow my thoughts to drift off. He sits on the floor in the corner and examines me. It’s the only thing he ever does - look at me. He doesn’t speak. I take a deep breath and think about what Ella told me to do.
“Are you sure? I imagine I’d be great ghost company. I could give you lectures about the three hundred-and-forty-three different types of tobacco ash whenever you’re bored at work.”
On Christmas morning, Sherlock wakes up in John’s arms. He’s completely sprawled out on top of him, his face tucked underneath John’s chin, his lips close to John’s neck. When he hears John waking up, he lifts his head and looks down at the sleepy face beneath him. John slowly opens his eyes and starts to grin as soon as he sees Sherlock.
He practically jumps forward, only managing to murmur a quiet “Sherl– “ before enveloping him in a tight hug. Once he touches Sherlock and realises that the man in his arms is not an illusion, he gets even closer, taking in the distinct scent he’s been trying so hard to prevail. Sherlock’s muscles seem to respond automatically, as he leans forward and closes his arms around John. Sherlock’s body feels alarmingly slim. John feels the burning anticipation of tears but he doesn’t care. All that matters is that Sherlock has come home.
“Well, he was my ex-husband, actually. And he didn’t leave me, he died. At least, that’s what I thought. He was working in the army, as I told you, and one day I was told that he was killed by a bomb.”
“Well, you’re definitely not a police inspector, that much I can tell. I’d say private detective, but the police don’t go to private detectives.”
“Of course, John, although I wouldn’t mind a second interruption,” he states. I find myself going red at the suggestion.
Forty-five minutes later he returns to the living room, freshly showered and fully dressed. Sherlock, who’s still in the exact same spot on the sofa, glances at him.
He got up with one swift motion and headed towards the kitchen. The blue dressing gown fluttered around him like a cape.
John’s stomach sinks to the floor once he dares to look at Mary. Her expression is one of horror, shock, hurt, sadness and disappointment all at once, but she tries to conceal it immediately.
John furrows his brows at the contradictory statement and turns his attention from one man to the other whilst they continue their uncomfortable conversation about Mr. Anderson’s infidelity with one of the female sergeants. John feels like an intruder, but the two men don’t seem to care about his presence, shooting insults back and forth without a second thought.
“Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there’s only one thing to do: find out where it lives.”
“You… you made me feel like a complete dick-head! I thought I was being the worst husband ever; all the while you were shagging someone else?!”
“We kiss each other,” Sherlock said, “just not in front of you.” He touched Rosie’s tiny nose with one of his fingers and left an orange dot there.
In the kitchen he found Sherlock, nose-deep into his microscope. He didn’t look up when John entered.
John feels it safe to look, and finds Sherlock fully dressed, to his relief. He walks over to the chair and unwinds the blue scarf from its back, before handing it to Sherlock and going into the kitchen. He finds Sherlock’s tea and even a canny soup that’s non-perishable, and prepares both before returning to the bedroom.
I walk down the street to see the building, and the memories hit me painfully. I have to stop walking, my sight being blurred out by visions of the past.
After a couple of minutes, John starts talking anyway. He tells Sherlock everything; the death of his mother causing his father to drown his grief in alcohol and to vent his anger on his son’s body; his subsequent unemployment and their eviction; his father’s incomprehension of his daughter’s sexuality; and his death due to liver failure before John joined the army. Sherlock sits still listening, not adding anything to the conversation. His frustration and anger rise with John’s narration. How could such bad things happen to such a good human being? How could anyone in their right mind treat a child like this? How could John, despite everything he went through in his infancy, turn out to be the most caring and understanding man Sherlock has ever known?
He gets up, locks their door and switches the lights off. When he crawls back into bed he could swear that John is lying even closer to him. 11,3 cm closer approximately. He can feel John’s breath on his face again and feels his own heart beating in an irregular speed. His body is betraying him again.
Sherlock blinked at him. Could this be real? Could everything he had ever wanted be true after all these years?
I haven’t seen her in ages. She looks fine, actually. I didn’t really know what I was expecting, but definitely not this. She’s wearing a trenchcoat that matches her hair colour and her smile comes up all the way to her brown eyes.
“Soon,” he replies, making a swift motion with his hand. He gets up to approach me and stays still right in front of me. He’s probably deducing me right now. All I can do is stare into his right eye. He removed his stubble, I realise with a hint of disappointment. I kind of liked him with facial hair, although I would never tell him that. Especially not since he demonstrated his hatred towards my own so penetratingly in the past. He finally found what he was looking for in my gaze and retrieves to his room. I should probably not call it his room, since this whole apartment is his now, but I can’t help myself from referring to the upstairs bedroom as my own. Jesus, it’s been four and a half years since I’ve lived here.
“Look at those cheekbones. I could cut myself slapping that face. Would you like me to try?” Miss Adler narrows her eyes down at him before taking the white collar to her mouth and biting down onto its edges. Her red lipstick leaves a print on the fabric. Sherlock stares at her in confusion until he sees John in the corner of his eyes.
“Shut up and go to sleep, Sherlock.” John feels a kiss being pressed to his head, and falls asleep with a smile on his face.
And that’s when he also realises with a shattering clarity that he has to tell John the truth. And that it can’t wait any longer.
After a small eternity, Sherlock stops playing and opens his eyes. John quickly looks away and clears his throat, trying to conceal the fact that he spent the last couple of minutes staring at Sherlock.
“We shouldn’t bother, John, the hound has probably already killed her,” he pants, trying to keep up with me.
“No, Papa, please. He told me we could go. Maybe we’ll see another shooting star,” she said in a pleading tone and looked at him with her big, green eyes.
“Yes, John. If we’re going to do this, we’ll do it properly,” Sherlock said and pulled out the larger of the two rings. He grabbed John’s hand and swiftly placed it onto his ring finger, before taking the other ring and placing it onto his own.
“Oh my god,” Greg repeats John’s thoughts. “Sumatra Road. What time is it? Okay, we still got some time, but we need to hurry. I’ll call back-up from the car.”
It would be much easier to hate Mary, Sherlock thinks. He could blame her for his misery and everything would be fine. But how can he hate someone who puts John’s happiness above her own? How can he hate someone who loves John that much?
Sherlock shakes his head while rummaging around in the bag. “Didn’t they have a blue plastic container at the store?” he asks.
“Please, John, forgive me… for all the hurt that I caused you.” Sherlock folds his hands together, practically begging now. If John is really going to die, he needs to know that Sherlock has regretted leaving him the moment he shut the Inn door in Dartmoor.
He was my flatmate, my best friend, he gave me a reason to live in a time when I desperately needed one. Being with him healed me, but it was more than that.
John carefully opens the package and reveals the black jewelry box that he doesn’t remember picking up at a store over two years ago. He opens it and his expression changes upon seeing the golden band inside.
I frown at her. What’s that supposed to mean? Does she think I want to meet women at a graveyard? The thought seems absurd, but then again, Molly works at the morgue, so she might have different views on the topic. Suddenly it hits me that she was probably on her way to the cemetery just now.
The robot voice in the subway announces his stop, so John gets up from his seat, feeling the woman’s eyes on him. He takes the stairs of the station and quickly walks over to the flat, his head pounding with every step. Lately, the migraine has gotten considerably worse, but John isn’t sure whether he can blame that on Sherlock’s absence.
At that Sherlock finally looks up from the phone to study my face. After a couple of seconds, a brief smile crosses his face, and I brace myself for what comes now. “Oh John, do you really think it never occurred to me to hack a phone with technology? That’s why I rely on baby powder and iodine! It’s not like I already checked the app Copy9 which allows you to hack into someone’s phone and realised that it only works if said phone is already unlocked and neither did I check the Android device manager that can change the pin of a phone but only applies to phones with a pre-installed Google account. I also didn’t try to click the emergency contact button and type in an extremely long password until the phone system crashes and allows me to go to the home screen, which apparently only works with a certain type of android phones suffering from a system error. And I also didn’t – “
“Well get used to it,” is all John can say. He smiles up at Sherlock, but any further words are interrupted by the shout of the serial killer.
He doesn’t like to admit this outburst of human emotions, nor the mere presence of them in his rational mind; but if he’s going to tell one person, it would always be John.
“Thanks, Nancy. I guess we’ll call it an early weekend and finish the rest on Monday morning. You’re free to go.”
Sherlock sits on the bed and waits for John. Somehow, he's even more nervous than last night. He feels like a school boy about to break some rule, one he didn’t even knew existed. It’s annoying.
“I didn’t,” Sherlock murmurs against his neck, his breath hot against John’s sensitive skin. “I never practice.”
After dinner, it’s already past Rosie’s bedtime. I take her to bed while Sherlock (miraculously) agrees to do the dishes. Once in our room, I realise while placing Rosie inside the crib next to my bed that I need to address another topic with my best friend. I give Rosie a kiss on the head and sing her a goodnight song. At the moment she’s more into songs than stories. She closes her tired eyes even before I finish the last stanza.
September rushes past, and all of a sudden it’s October and John still doesn’t remember anything. They’ve spent a particularly long day with Stamford, because he’s one of the only people in London whose company John seems to enjoy. They talked about their old days at Bart’s, and Sherlock, having nothing to add to the conversation, felt quite left out.
The words cut deeper than the wound in Sherlock’s leg. Miller has a point. Up until a couple of months ago, Sherlock always felt superior to everyone and everything. He didn’t need a companion for his work nor for his life. Since he met John, much of his old views have changed. In this case, however, he’s glad he didn’t bring John.
John licks his lips when Sherlock’s stare wanders towards them. His heart is beating frantically in his chest. He slowly tilts his head forward and closes his eyes.
“Er, I don’t know... it was strange, to say the least. I felt a tingling in my fingers once he reached for my hand, but that’s pretty much it. To be honest, I don’t really know why everyone’s making such a fuzz over it.” He shrugs his shoulders. Lying to Mary wasn’t his intention, but it’s probably better to spare her from the truth.
“Yes, anyway... I wanted to ask whether you still need that slide of my presentation from last week? You said you needed if for your work, so I put it on a flash drive.” He places a metal-grey flash drive onto the lab table, smiling quickly before turning away.
“No, I think you’re damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power. In your case, it’s yourself.”
“It means when the police are out of their depth – which is always – they consult me,” Sherlock concludes.
John laughs out loud. It’s this mixture between a giggle and a proper laugh that is unique to John Watson. Sherlock thinks it’s the most beautiful sound he’s ever heard.
“That’s not what you needed. You needed your triumph. It happens all the time when we fight. You just leave me alone with my thoughts, and you know how dangerous that can be, but you do it anyway.”
“No, I’m sorry, Sherlock. I’m just tired of disappointing you.” John’s voice is full of resignation. He clears his throat before continuing.
Sherlock continues narrating the events of their life. Somehow he imagined it would be a mere enumeration of facts to him, but it’s not. Once he explains that Mary and her unborn child both died during the delivery, John stiffens and Sherlock sees his left hand clench into a fist. Sherlock wants to do something, anything, to help John. He wants to erase the pain from John’s face, the pain of having lost a family he doesn’t even remember. He wants to take John’s face in his hands and promise him that everything will be alright. Expect he can’t promise that. Sherlock cannot begin to understand how hard it must be to be going through all of this again, even through a narration. He’s not sure whether it’s not too much for John to take, but he wants to get it over with.
Sherlock finally takes his eyes off of me, stares at the mug for a second and licks his lips. “Surprisingly okay.”
“Not on the maps, but once you eliminate the impossible, the only thing remaining must be the truth.” He stares at John again, when all of a sudden his face lights up. “Sumatra Road. It’s a station that never got built on the surface. They did the platforms, even the staircases, but it got tied up in legal disputes.”
“’xcuse me, are you my doctor?” he asks while trying to lift his left hand. He manages to reach for Sherlock’s hand on his forehead and slowly takes it. Their wedding bands make a little
He pushes me down onto the sheets and crawls on top of me. His kisses wander from my mouth to my neck to my chest and keep going further down. Once he reaches my trousers, he stops. I tilt my head up and see the questioning expression on his face. I nod quickly and help him unbuckle my belt. Once my trousers are out of the way, Sherlock starts placing kisses down my cock.
“You remember that four days ago I met this man called Sherlock Holmes, right? The one from Bart’s who took me along to a crime scene?”
Sherlock doesn’t respond for a very long time. He keeps his eyes on John, who has apparently closed his own, and thinks. He listens to John’s steady breathing. When he finally whispers “Goodnight, John.” John is already asleep.
“Sherlock, dear, are you there?” Oh god, that’s Mrs. Hudson. She must be bringing Rosie up. Rosie. Jesus Christ.
Inside, it’s colder than he expected, and it takes him a moment to adjust his vision. He can barely see Sherlock anymore, so he swims downward blindly. Once he reaches two white hands, he realises how pale Sherlock already is. He takes him by the arm and pushes them both upwards with all the force he can manage, desperately holding onto Sherlock. The water pushed aside from Sherlock’s body is turning an alarming shade of red. The way back up feels like an eternity, but finally he can see a shimmer of light from above. He pushes Sherlock through the little whole, hoping that he regains his consciousness sooner than later. From within the water, without any ground to support him, John can’t push Sherlock out of the way for him to exit, so all he can do is wait for Sherlock to do it on his own. Maybe he should have thought about this before jumping, but the prospect of dying wouldn’t have changed his actions either way.
“I’m going to use it to hopefully make the fingerprints visible. It’s an old science trick, works almost every time,” he says while simultaneously placing the phone into the white plastic container and scattering the whole bottle of iodine on top. He then closes the container, places one hand underneath and the other hand on top of it and rubs slightly. “Now we need to wait for a couple of minutes. My hands should warm up the iodine.”
Okay, I’m starting to get why Sherlock would think that. In the past, I reminded everyone I met about my heterosexuality. But I thought he understood that that was more of a defence mechanism. Sherlock is the most intelligent man in the world, after all. Apart from that, I’m not the same man I was six bloody years ago. Maybe I should talk to him about that. If that’s the reason he’s afraid of Rosie calling him Papa, I should repeat that it’s not a problem for me. That’s the least I can do.
Sherlock feels his heart skip a beat as the words sink in. He understands why a married non-person would be afraid to meet his person, but the logical conclusion doesn’t provide the comfort it should.
John laughed. “Still,” he started, but forgot whatever he had meant to say next. Sherlock’s eyes were locked on his, the blue-green colour piercing right into John’s soul.
“He informed me about the underground network. I do hope you’ve got a useful lead,” Sherlock replies, his tone as tense as the atmosphere in the room.
I open my eyes slowly. The light streaming in through the window is painfully glaring. I feel the weight of an arm on my waist and try to shift as calmly as possible in order to keep the person attached to said arm from waking up. As I try to get up silently, I hear Mary sighing and turning around. Her back is facing me now, but I know she just woke up as well.
John smiled and pointed at his ring finger. “I wanted to take it off yesterday, but then I read the engraving and I finally knew that you felt the same.”
John shifts his weight from one foot to the other, clearly uncomfortable. “I... I still don’t remember anything, Sherlock. But I – I was at the pub the other day with Greg. We’re actually getting along quite well. He’s told me more things about my old life. Anyway, he asked me about my plans for Christmas, since that’s a holiday you usually spend with your loved ones. And when I thought about the answer I realised I want to spend it with you.”
This cannot be true; the gardener cannot have killed Mr. Scott. It shouldn’t be possible, at least not according to his deductions. Lestrade is mad at him, but that doesn’t bother Sherlock. Sergeant Donovan made fun of him for having lost his ‘creepy superpower’, but that doesn’t bother him either. What does bother him is the fear residing inside him that she might be right. It wasn’t the first time this week that he led the whole of Scotland Yard on a wrong track.
Sherlock wants to reply but pauses instead. He didn’t tell John that he murdered their last board with a knife, and Lestrade couldn’t have known that.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock responds honestly. He’s starting to feel that he has no rush to solve the case. Does it really matter if they stay in this hotel a night longer, or two?
“I’m sorry, John, I wasn’t expecting to see you here,” Sherlock whispers. John can see that his hand is trembling.
He leads her into the flat, telling her to make herself comfortable while preparing tea. From the corner of his eyes he can see her examining the living room. Sherlock wonders what she might be thinking. He already deduced that John told her about him, yet he can’t figure out how she’s feeling. Is she jealous of him? Does she think John deserves better, someone who might not be as messy as Sherlock? Does it bother her that he’s a man?
Sherlock is only half listening. Maybe he should take the damn pill just to get the cabbie to shut up. And it would prove his point, wouldn’t it?
But now, so many years later, he finds himself unable to suppress his feelings. Now that he knows what it’s like to be held by John, to be kissed by John, to be loved by John, he can’t possibly return to his old self. And that’s the worst thing. Because deep down Sherlock knows he will never be able to exist without John again. In John, he found a person worth dying for, and, more importantly, a person worth living for. He needs him like air and water and the thought of never having him again makes his mind go blank. He’s trapped in a loophole of his own thoughts, he’s on the bottom of a well but he’s still falling, and he’s never climbing out.
Suddenly, my thoughts get interrupted by a ringing sound. It’s not the TV. My phone. I reach over to grab it and sigh as I see the name of the incoming caller. “Hello?”
“Er, Sherlock,” he says whilst opening the door, “there’s something I haven’t told you, yet. I kind of… live here now.”
Sherlock nods understandingly and waits for John to call Mary. After their nightly conversation in February, they didn’t talk about the incident further. John didn’t mention Sherlock, and Mary didn’t ask any more questions, either. The last six weeks might have been hard for John, but he swore to himself that he wouldn’t burden Mary with it. He promised her that he wasn’t going to spend more time with Sherlock; that he didn’t want to. Now, not even two months later, he’s already breaking that promise.
“John, as you apparently don’t remember anything from the last few years, I want to give you some details about your life, until you remember everything on your own.” He takes a deep breath.
“No,” John interrupts him. “I’d rather you not lie to me anymore, Sherlock. We both know it’s true. You know I’d love to get my memories back, but I can’t do anything about it. This whole situation is a fucking mess!”
With the song ending and the music changing, John slowly started to move his body in the same rhythm as Rosie. Sherlock joined in and it wasn’t anywhere near as strange as John would have imagined. After a while, he felt light-headed and started to giggle. The endorphins were rushing through his body and he briefly wondered why they didn’t do this more often. Sherlock was smiling, too, and Rosie’s face was beaming with happiness.
He leans forward and pulls his wife into a close embrace. The knot in John’s chest finally seems to unravel a bit. Everything will be alright; they will be able to get past this. “You’re amazing,” he whispers in her ear.
Something in Sherlock’s voice made John turn around. Sherlock was closer than he had expected. His eyes were scanning John’s face, searching for something John couldn’t quite grasp.
John nods but raises an eyebrow when Sherlock turns back around to 221B. He follows his friend upstairs again until they are in the hallway. Sherlock opens a wooden door in the ceiling that somehow John never noticed before and lets John pass through. The stairs are shaky and tiny and John is thankful for Sherlock right behind him, but he manages eventually and finds himself in the cold once more.
After half an hour of comforting and once Rosie had fallen asleep in Sherlock’s arms, he got up from the sofa and finally looked at John. “I’m putting her back to bed.”
At the restaurant, everything is covered in pink balloons and red roses. There are so many candles on the table that the waitress can barely place the glasses of wine onto it. The girl he met on an online dating website seems nice. They talk for a while and John tells her everything about his work with Sherlock. She seems impressed.
After breakfast, Sherlock explains his plan to John. John seems eager to get his memories back and suggests they go to Bart’s right away. When they’re standing in the lab where they first met, the significance only reveals itself to one of them. John looks around and inspects the room, but sadly shakes his head when Sherlock raises an eyebrow at him questioningly. They even visit the morgue, where Molly introduces herself to John with a joke that’s a bit out of place, but John laughs anyway. She offers Sherlock to come over whenever he needs help with something that John used to do (cleaning the flat, for example), and Sherlock is thankful for having her as a friend. When the morgue doesn’t ring any bells to John, Sherlock takes him to the park where John had proposed to him on the tenth of April in 2018.
All of a sudden, a million pieces I never understood come together in my mind. I can see the images clearly. Sherlock claiming being married to his work. Irene saying ‘Look at us both’. Sherlock playing sad music on Christmas. Mine and Sherlock’s dinner at Angelo’s on our one-year anniversary. Sherlock being jealous of my girlfriends. Sherlock calling me his conductor of light. Sherlock saving my life over and over again. Sherlock’s words before he jumped. Sherlock begging me for forgiveness. Sherlock’s expression when he realised he was my best friend. The stag night. Sherlock calling me the bravest, wisest and kindest human being. Sherlock leaving my wedding early. Sherlock shooting Magnussen to save my wife. Sherlock’s look when he said ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’. Sherlock forgiving Mary for shooting him. Sherlock helping me set up Rosie’s nursery. Sherlock allowing me to hit him because he thought he deserved it. Sherlock treating Rosie like his own daughter. Sherlock pointing a gun at his own brother and not me.
) without hitting his elbows on the walls. When he gets back to the bedroom, he feels slightly nervous. He hasn’t shared a bed with anyone since he was on a family trip to the beach, where he had to spend too much time with his annoying little cousin, whom he had chosen over Mycroft to share a room with. It ended horribly. However, he has certainly never shared a bed with John Watson.
“You know, there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. I know I already broke this promise before, but I really mean it this time. I still wanna go on cases with you when the baby is here. We’ll still be doing all this stuff.”
Now they’re standing at the crime scene, in the garden behind the house of the victim Jack Downing. The body has already been taken to the morgue, where the examination determined the cause of death: drowning.
Sherlock hears a rushing in his ears, and his fingers feel numb where John stopped touching them. If he doesn’t remember this, one of the most perfect moments of their lives, how will he ever remember anything else?
Mike offers to buy us coffee-to-go and we sit down on a bench together. I think he suggested that because he saw my cane and didn’t want me to stand for too long. I don’t really like to be reduced to my limp, to be constantly reminded of my wounds from the war, but I’m sure he meant it as a nice gesture. An uncomfortable silence settles upon us. When you haven’t seen someone in so long, what do you talk about?
“Oh, yes, sure.” I search through the bag Molly brought for a second. “Dammit, Molly forgot the pap. I think I need to run down to Tesco’s.”
“Well, I hope he makes up his mind soon. I don’t need a dead Moriarty playing games when the baby is born.”
“He’s upstairs.” She squeezes his hand and lets him pass through the door. John is thankful for the landlady’s understanding. He tries to conjure a smile and wishes her a good start into the New Year.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to reply. For the first time in his life, he finds himself unable to deduce even the smallest detail about the person in front of him. The woman walks into the room, her high heels clicking on the floor, and stops in front of Sherlock. With a quick motion of her hand she pulls Sherlock’s white collar from his shirt.
“I’m afraid not. Only the white ones.” I cross my arms and wait. This is not something I want to miss. I watch Sherlock as he carefully scatters some baby powder onto a sheet and dips the make-up brush into it. I am half expecting him to apply the powder to his face when he lifts the phone up with gloves on his long fingers and lightly dabs the powder onto it. He holds the phone close and repeats the process, examining where the powder settles.
When she’s back asleep, I place her back in the crib and leave the nursery as quietly as possible. From experience I estimate for her to remain asleep for about an hour. I go downstairs, too distracted to get back to bed, and make myself some coffee. Today is Friday, so I only have to work until 1 o’clock at the clinic. I started going back simply because I need the money. I’ve managed to get a babysitter for Rosie who watches her when I’m not here. I don’t want her to go to kindergarten so soon, and I feel like the time with a woman is good for her. It’s not like anyone could replace Mary, but it’s better than nothing.
“Are you really that bad at deductions? Don’t you know that you’re the person I care about most in the world? I know I’ve never explicitly said it, but I thought my actions spoke loud enough.”
“Just, you know. Let me warm you.” John phrases it as if it's the most normal thing, as if they do this every day.
Greg doesn’t seem to notice my confusion in his rage. “Tomorrow is Sunday!” When neither Sherlock nor I respond, he adds through gritted teeth “Well, I hope it’s worth it then. I’ll call you tomorrow.” With that, he turns around and leaves. I shout a goodbye after him, which he probably doesn’t hear.
Upon re-entering the flat, I hear Sherlock in the kitchen. He’s checking the phone under a microscope and looks up expectantly. I hand him the grocery bag and gesture to the microscope.
Sherlock can see the anger crawling onto his husband’s face. “Oh so that’s the issue here? You were afraid I wasn’t
“I don’t want to spend my last minutes like this.” There are tears in John’s eyes, and he takes a step forward.
It’s 3 o’clock when Molly arrives and I’ve just finished doing the dishes. Rosie is currently in her bouncy chair and enjoys bouncing around. She needs to be put to sleep in a couple of minutes before she doesn’t sleep, at all. I open the door for Molly who seems genuinely happy to babysit Rosie again.
“I would never force my husband into anything! I love him!” Sherlock’s anger intensifies. This is ridiculous. He doesn’t need some stupid doctor to tell him how to treat John. What does he know about their relationship or their marriage, anyway?
“This is the friend I just mentioned, Dr. John Watson. John, this is Sherlock Holmes, a colleague of mine.”
“I was just packing up everything, John. Would you like a cup of tea? I’m afraid I’m a bit late already but I could...”
For John, none of that mattered. He was glad to be away from London for a while, enjoying the thrill of danger and the knowledge of doing life-saving work in Afghanistan. He had a string of meaningless lovers during high school as well as during his time at Bart’s, but he never longed to find his soulmate in the ocean of lost souls in the world. For some reason John always despised the idea that some higher power should dictate whom he’s supposed to love. That is, until he got shot and forced to return home.
“What… how… where have you been?!” John asks, taking a step back to study Sherlock’s appearance properly.
Sherlock knows that he would love it here. If he hadn’t made that fatal mistake all those months ago, maybe they could’ve come here together sometime. They could’ve gone for a hike in the mountains or for a trip to Salzburg, Mozart’s place of birth. But it probably would have happened anyway, because Sherlock doesn’t know for how long he would’ve been able to keep up the façade. At this – what others might call – romantic hotel, far away from home, he isn’t sure what further damage he might have done.
Eventually, they are interrupted by Lestrade, who’s suddenly standing next to them and coughing loudly.
“I didn’t see anything,” Sherlock says, emphasizing each syllable. His voice is colder than the crispy night air.
John pinches the back of his nose and closes his eyes. It was a bloody long day; during which he was entrapped in a laboratory; found out that he had been drugged; returned to the Hollow; kept their client from killing himself; shot a dog; ran after a surprisingly fast senior murderer and watched him die during an explosion.
I cannot hide the surprise on my face. What plans? Or is this just some kind of excuse from Sherlock? I raise an eyebrow and search for Sherlock’s eyes so as to engage in nonverbal communication, but he’s staring into the opposite direction. Is he doing that on purpose?
“Yeah, I’m not the John Watson,” I reply, probably a bit too snippy. I clench my hand into a fist. I may not know much about my future, but I do know about my past. The war has changed me. I’m not the ‘bright young’ man I used to be. That’s what I know for sure.
John sits down slowly, taking a deep breath. “Mary and I had a fight and now she’s spending New Year’s Eve with her friend Laura, so I thought I could spend it with you?”
After Mr. Saltire had told them about his son, Thomas, who had disappeared with his German teacher Mr. Heidegger and his bicycle after school, Sherlock talked to an incompetent police officer
When Sherlock doesn’t reply, John continues. “I said before that I’ve never met someone like you. And it’s true. You’re rude to strangers, you never do the dishes, you keep human fingers in the fridge, you’re probably mad, and you’re absolutely brilliant. You’re honest and kind, incredibly intelligent and frustratingly attractive. You’re like a drug. I don’t know whether my memories will ever return. I don’t know whether I’ll ever know how I proposed to you, or how we danced at our wedding. But I do know that I want to be with you.”
Sherlock nods in response, as he doesn’t trust himself to form coherent sentences. He has automatically lay down on the right side of the bed, because he knows John prefers sleeping on the left. Once John turns off the light the room darkens completely. It makes Sherlock feel relieved and frustrated at the same time.
There’s a flood of emotions threatening to drown John – relief, sadness, regret, love, confusion, worry – but he pushes them all aside. The only logical next step is to contact Sherlock and tell him what idiots they’ve both been, clear up the misunderstanding and ask Sherlock to come home. He fishes for his phone and calls Sherlock but finds it on the living room desk. He must’ve left it there on purpose. John picks up the phone, but it’s turned off and password-protected. John proceeds to call Molly, then Greg, but they both don’t seem to know anything. Reluctantly, he calls Mycroft.
silence, but one where words simply aren’t necessary. John has gone silent, too. They only look at each other, both in their own thoughts. It’s something they have done before, but never for an extended period of time, Sherlock realises. He carefully studies John’s features. His blue eyes, the tiny wrinkles around them and his greyish hair. He then risks to look at his lips, no longer able to refuse. John licks his lips, and it seems almost like an invitation.
John closes the door without replying and immediately shivers. It has started to rain outside, and the cold winter air leaves the free skin of his neck in goose-bumps. He quickly turns the coat collar up against the wind and heads for the railway station. In summer he often cycles to work, but the British winter weather has made that unbearable a couple of months ago. The closeness to work was one of the reasons why he and Mary decided to buy the house in 2006, not even half a year after their first encounter. When she was introduced as the new nurse at his clinic, something between them had just clicked. They started dating in October of 2006 and got married after a rushed engagement in the summer of the following year. The only down-side to their otherwise perfect suburban London life is the fact that they’re not each other’s persons – their souls are not bonded by fate.
“I don’t know. Just, the woman and everything. What she said at New Year’s Eve.” I make a vague gesture with my hand to point at something that isn’t there.
Sherlock remains silent. He drinks from his cup and watches it curiously. It reminds me about when I asked him to be my best man, one year ago today.
Sherlock quickly ruffles his hands through his hair in order to get his thoughts straight. He glances back at the two men trying to catch up and can’t stop a grin from appearing on his face. How ridiculous. He continues down the steps and around the corner until he finally sees – an empty train station. A frustrated sigh escapes his lips when he hears John and Lestrade finally behind him.
“It’s more than okay,” John says and starts caressing Sherlock’s hand with his thumb. It feels fascinating. Sherlock doesn’t know whether he’ll ever get used to this. He feels like his chest will combust if he stares at John’s deep eyes any longer, but he can’t look away.
“Apparently, so did your son. He told you everything, because the murder was too much for his poor soul. But you, you didn’t want to ruin your precious reputation or cause a scandal so you withheld the information from the police. You wanted Thomas to stay at the inn until you found a convenient solution.”
Sherlock turns back around after having found no footprints in the flower bed. He takes a closer look at the pond, but there’s nothing unusual there. When he turns his attention to the path the three of them are standing on, he kneels down after something has caught his attention. After a closer examination, he stands back up and grins at Lestrade.
Sherlock has to blink to make sure the person in front of him isn’t a fata morgana. It’s John in a grey jumper and dark jeans, his deep blue eyes filled with insecurity and something else. For a moment, the two of them stare at each other, until Mrs. Hudson interrupts them by clearing her throat.
Sherlock opens his eyes, his pupils blown wide and his expression still filled with lust and desire, and bends down to kiss John again. He lays down next to John on the small sofa, both ignoring the mess they just created. John turns slightly towards Sherlock, unable to keep his eyes off his soulmate.
No matter the British weather, somehow there was always an occasion to go to the park, or someplace similar. After a couple of days John noticed that Sherlock had stopped insisting on taking cabs for everything farther away than the usual three-kilometre radius. He figured Sherlock must have seen the happiness on Rosie’s face, as well, and was therefore eager to make her happy for as long as the month lasted.
“Okay. Good.” Sherlock gets up and takes Rosie into his arms. When he rocks her back and forth to try and stop her from sobbing, I can’t help but think back to what Mrs. Hudson told me at the therapist’s house.
“So you’ve got a boyfriend then?” John asks while doing a very distracting gesture involving his lips.
“John, spend Christmas with your wife. I told you I’m fine!” The words come out harsher than Sherlock meant to. He takes off his scarf and throws it onto the black armchair.
“But can’t you just hand it to Mycroft and let him deal with it?” I know right away that that was probably the wrong suggestion. I just want the phone out of the flat, I add mentally.
“Look.” He comes back over to the table and presses play, pointing at the laptop. “Seven carriages leave Westminster, but only six carriages arrive at St. James’s Park. The entire tube compartment disappeared. The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage.”
It’s Nancy, one of the nurses. Leaning against the door frame slightly, she suppresses a yawn. She works part-time like her husband, allowing them to take care of their two kids in turn. John knows she’d rather be home sooner than later; and frankly he feels the same.
After they had left the flat, John sat down on the couch, intending to watch some crap telly to distract himself. He picked up the remote but, instead of pressing the button, stared at the silver ring on his finger. He moved back up from the couch and headed upstairs. The sight of it was too painful, constantly reminding him of what he knew he could never have. He just hoped Rosie wouldn’t notice. There were only a couple of days left of this wish-marriage, anyway.
Sherlock gently picks Rosie up from the ground and rocks her in his arms. She calms down and eventually stops crying, but keeps weeping a little.
“I can’t do this anymore, John. Now that I know what I can have with you, I can’t possibly go back to just being friends again. To see you with other women again – it nearly killed me before and I don’t think I would survive it this time.”
Sherlock pulls John towards the stable. The gate is open, so he just slips through and John follows him. The stable smells terrible. There is hay everywhere, and a couple of horses are in their boxes, the male ones apparently. Sherlock approaches one of them, but the black horse starts to snicker immediately.
“We need to leave! Call a cab,” I demand. He gets up at once, tipping over a candle while doing so, and we jog outside.
The universe is a funny thing, he thinks while watching Sherlock slowly drift off. You meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you. And then you meet one person who touches your soul and changes everything.
They get ready and leave the hotel room. Breakfast is served at the terrace of the inn. Sherlock watches John eat a bagel. He isn’t hungry himself, as usual on cases. When John complains about not being able to eat when being stared at, Sherlock eyes his surroundings instead.  The inn apparently belongs to a farm, as there is a stable and a barn on the property next to the main building. There are horses grassing on the meadow and the view is what some people with more romantic tendencies than Sherlock might call picturesque.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, but John couldn’t tell whether it was because he actually tried to read his face or because he regretted his earlier choice of words.
in reference to him; and when it finally happened he would’ve never believed that John would ever say it with such discomfort.
The only good thing in this misery was that Rosie seemed to be unaware of the tension between Sherlock and himself. John couldn’t tell whether she noticed that they weren’t holding hands anymore, but if she did, she wasn’t sharing her thoughts on it.
“Balance of probability? I use a variety of data and statistics to estimate the probability of a certain incident or action.”
For a reason Sherlock doesn’t quite understand, he finds himself facing a serial killer with a toy gun and two bottles at Roland-Kerr College two days after finding out he’s been wrong about one thing all his life. Two days since he last saw John in the hallway of Mrs. Hudson’s flat. He’s been trying to tell himself that it’s for the best that John doesn’t want to see or talk to him anymore. At least this way Sherlock can continue The Work without anyone interfering or stopping him from doing potentially dangerous things.
“John, I… I can’t do it. I don’t know how,” Sherlock admits, still on the floor. “Forgive me, John.”
Something in Sherlock’s expression shifts. John decides to not dwell on this part any further and looks down.
Sherlock nods, then looks up at John expectantly. John takes a hand to Sherlock’s forehead and feels the slightly elevated temperature. He goes into the bathroom and returns with a wet towel he places on Sherlock’s head.
John stares into Sherlock’s eyes – those distractingly gorgeous eyes – and forgets what he was supposed to do next. He’s still holding his friend’s hand, which feels warm against his own. Sherlock doesn’t even blink.
“Oh come on! You really called me because of a simple cold?!” John can’t stop himself from chuckling. For some reason he wouldn’t have expected Sherlock to be sickly, or whiny.
But John slowly shakes his head, taking the ring out of the box and sliding it onto his ring finger without hesitance. The tension finally leaves Sherlock’s body.
“Well, it’s gotten quite late. Sorry we can’t stay longer, but I’m afraid Rosie needs her sleep, and I’m quite tired, too.”
“Er, so... by ‘we’, you mean me and...?” John asks. What a weird question. Obviously Sherlock means John and himself. He knows they’re married, so why doesn’t he assume they’re living together? It only clicks after a couple of seconds, but Sherlock feels like his heart is being ripped out of his chest.
He accompanies John downstairs to find Mrs. Hudson just returning from her sister’s – or was it her friend’s? – house. She greets them cheerfully and invites them both for a cup of tea. John declines politely, telling her that Mary is probably expecting him.
After the inspection, Sherlock walks over to the victim’s wife, transforming into a completely different person – a tearful, understanding man who morns his friend’s early decease. Once he has gotten the answer he was looking for, he changes back to himself just as quickly. John has no idea what that answer may be.
John, still too confused to add anything of importance, follows him inside. Inside the hallway, they are offered matching coveralls, which Mr. Holmes declines with a dismissive wave of his hand. John shrugs and takes one of the coveralls from an eye-rolling inspector. Once he and Mr. Holmes are alone on the staircase, he sees his chance at getting a quick overview of the ridiculous situation he finds himself in.
He immediately regrets the words once they’re out. That’s not what he intended to say. John’s expression has turned from anger to desperation and sadness.
“He’s over there,” John said, pointing at Sherlock’s large figure in the approaching dawn. He was standing next to Molly with his arms crossed, looking as bored as he often did during social gatherings. Molly was obviously trying to engage him into a conversation but Sherlock didn’t seem all too interested.
“Sherlock Holmes does not get tipsy,” Sherlock replies matter-of-factly. He takes the empty glass from John and brings it back into the kitchen.
Sherlock feels as timid as in the days when they first got together and he asked John every time if he could kiss him. “Can I hug you? It’s just that I missed you so much these last three days, and I...” He lets the sentence trail off. He realises how desperate and needy he sounds, but this is John, his John, and he would give anything to hold him right now.
“I, I gotta go. I gotta go to Mary,” John manages to get out, opening his eyes to see the expression of shock and confusion on Sherlock’s face before he manages to conceal it.
John smiles, even though he feels like his heart is about to jump out of his chest. “I love you, too.”
“But I want to.” I take a step closer to Sherlock, forcing him to lean back onto the kitchen counter. He's got the tea towel hung over his left shoulder and the sleeves of his dressing gown rolled up.
“Yeah, it was. See you soon, best man,” I add with a grin. I immediately regret saying that so I turn around and leave to escape Sherlock’s amused look.
John stared at their matching rings. His was a surprisingly good fit. He couldn’t help but think back to when he first wore the wedding band he had picked out with Mary. This one felt different, somehow.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself. John loves Mary, obviously, so nothing’s going to change. Besides, he’s entering dangerous territory – of disadvantages and chemical defects, as he claimed himself a couple of months ago.
They continue their conversation about Sherlock’s profession, but shift to John’s after a while. He tells him about his army days and his work at the clinic. He also briefly mentions his wife, Mary, whom he met at the clinic a couple of years ago. Sherlock finds it harder and harder to focus on 22 Northumberland Street, since the man next to him appears to be so much more interesting. Once John’s pasta has arrived, he asks Sherlock about his (non-existent) romantic life.
When I started going back to work after moving in, Sherlock insisted on taking care of Rosie. He said it was unnecessary for me to hire someone to watch her if he could do it just as well. He was right of course, but I didn’t want to steal all his free-time and occupy him with a toddler. Sherlock, however, surprised me by telling me that he wanted to take care of her and that he liked spending time with little Watson. He still calls her Watson, sometimes, although I don’t think she likes it. Rosie refuses to call Sherlock by his name, she only ever utters an incomprehensible combination of vowels at him. I think it’s because Sherlock is still too difficult to pronounce, Sherlock thinks it’s because she secretly doesn’t like him. If he knew how wrong he is. Rosie adores him, probably even more than I do. It’s ridiculous.
“I felt that you were in danger. I can’t really explain how, but I just knew where you were and that someone was threatening you.”
John, however, feels the need to correct the manager. Sherlock introduces the two of them, but Angelo continues to ignore John’s denial by bringing them a tea-light to the table. After John has finally decided on the most boring dish on the menu, he starts questioning Sherlock further.
I watch Rosie in Sherlock’s arms and have to smile. For a moment, I allow myself to lean closer towards Sherlock and stroke Rosie’s head. Her blonde curls have grown quite a bit lately, which somehow makes her hair look like a mixture of Mary’s and Sherlock’s. Suddenly, I feel a squeeze on my hand and look up. Sherlock is staring at me with a curious expression. When his blue eyes find mine, I can see the brown dot in his left eye and it feels like my heart skips a beat. He’s so close that our noses could almost be touching. I risk a look down at his heart-shaped lips and immediately stare back into his eyes. I can even feel his breath on my face and it sends a shiver down my spine.
“Watson, I’m afraid I’ll have to send you to see the inspector alone today,” said Holmes, clearing his throat. “You have everything you need; you can fill me in this evening.”
He held Holmes’s gaze defiantly for several long seconds before tearing away. When he spoke again, it was nearly a whisper. “You frighten me,” he said. “I only want to help you.”
He stopped, seeming to watch Holmes for some dispute. When none arose, he continued, hesitant. “It’s… quite serious, actually. There’s no known treatment or way of curtailing the growth. Once the disease gestates, the only known reversal is to resolve the source of the stress.”
“Because you can’t be!” Holmes retorted, his rasping voice straining for volume. He coughed, spitting up a handful of petals. “You cannot love me, my dear Watson,” he continued after a ragged breath, “for the simple reason that there is nothing to love.”
“You should have told me,” Watson tried again, having received no response. “I could have helped you, I could have tried.”
“Anywhere. The first place you can find outside of London where I’ll be left alone.” Holmes watched as his brother pulled a large envelope from a drawer. “If you would be so kind as to send someone along in seven days’ time to fetch me, I would be obliged.”
This letter could not have been for him, because Sherlock Holmes would not have left him another letter.
There on the floor by the far wall, Holmes braced himself on hands and knees, fighting for every shallow breath. And yet, in spite of his condition, Holmes appeared as polished as Watson had ever seen him: fine suit, shoes brushed, hair only just on the other side of neat.
he thought, a single word rising up through the watery white noise. He turned his eyes upon the desk, but there were no footprints, no details, no out of place peculiarities to offer a ghost of a clue as to why this was happening.
“Indeed,” said Mycroft flatly. “I’ll leave you to sort through them. I can have a room for you in Kent by tomorrow evening.”
Generally speaking, there was not much that could draw Holmes away from a case once he was set upon a line of investigation. If the problem was compelling enough, his mind focused singularly upon it, to the exclusion of any and every other thing. This new mystery, however, had decidedly superseded the one he’d left to Watson. The murdered man of his case was already dead, after all -- a crime of passion, with little risk of further victims. If he could find what he needed here in a few short hours, he thought as he knocked on the oversized door of the Barbary estate, there was plenty of time to resolve both.
Holmes drew a quick breath as if to speak, but his lips sealed again and his brow creased. He shifted to better face Watson, tugging their hands closer to himself and giving a sincere squeeze.
When Holmes looked up again, Barbary was on his feet, pouring a glass of water and bringing it to him. His eyes were far away even as he passed the glass off, clearly lost in thought. Sitting at his desk, he tented his fingers at the tip of his nose in contemplation. “I have heard of this,” he said at last, “though I confess, I have never seen it myself. Mr. Holmes--”
“Holmes--” Watson began, and was cut off by another relentless, rasping spell as Holmes retched up another rose to join the rest.
him, rather than ask for help? Surely his pride was not so insurmountable that he wouldn’t at least have requested a different doctor, since for some inscrutable reason he refused help from his friend.
“What have you done?” Watson managed at last, his gut wrenching at the futility of the question. The flowering cough, or
know other things. This, too, held a most unidentifiable pattern, spanning from the understandably obscure to the most common knowledge, which others might call common sense.
If there were any words Watson had prepared, any speeches he thought he might righteously deliver, they abandoned him completely upon stepping up to the front door. From the other side, he could hear a racking, violent cough, choking and gasping shallowly. The sound of it turned Watson’s blood cold, and he pushed through the unlatched door without another thought.
As he stood outside of his apartment on Baker Street, holding a single green leaf between his fingers, he found himself drawing a bit from both categories. Here was what he knew: the leaf was dull green with a leathery, satin texture, a serrated margin, approximately five centimeters in length and belonging to the subspecies
It was, however, troublingly reminiscent of the fixation which had drawn him away before his disappearance in Switzerland -- the time leading up to that, between Holmes’s discovery of Professor Moriarty’s network and the invitation he extended Watson to leave the country with him, had been some of the quietest Watson had known since they met. Dissimilar as they were, he and Holmes had still always been of the same mind on so many fronts; when Moriarty entered the picture, it was as if a wire had been severed. Holmes had taken to leaving without notice or explanation, and returning wearier than ever only to vanish again in the morning.
Watson drew in a breath and collected his bag, stepping out of the cart with a brief nod to send the driver off. The sun drifted low behind him, the breeze masking the sound of distant waves. The scene was charming, and it threw his own disquietude into ugly, sharp relief. This was what Holmes meant, he supposed, when he suggested the country was predisposed to harboring terrible secrets. Fitting, then, that it was where he’d brought his own.
It was Holmes, now, who pressed a lingering kiss to the knuckles of Watson’s right hand, then his left. He offered a weak smile and opened his mouth to speak, but his voice caught and his expression turned contemplative. He closed his eyes and inhaled, deeply.
“You think I don’t… love you?” Watson said at last, but the words were stilted and rigid. If that was the root of this, he had to do better.
And yet, if he’d ever been truly, genuinely happy in his life, it had to have been these past years. At Reichenbach, he’d been content to end his life with a high note for his career; here, it seemed he could do much worse than ending on a high note where his heart was concerned. It had never mattered that Watson didn’t love him. He stayed, that was enough. All that was left now was the paperwork, the letter, the goodbye.
“No,” Watson said resolutely. “No. I cannot lie to you Holmes, I’ve never been able to, even if I wanted to. Look at me now and you’ll see I’m telling the truth. I love you. It’s a simple fact. It’s as uncomplicated as… as tobacco ash, or bicycle tires, and if you find those things more complicated than I credit them for, I invite you to study it just as completely. You may study it for a lifetime, if it pleases you, if it draws you out of this godforsaken place. Let me bring you home and you may test me to your heart’s content, but your findings will never refute what I’ve told you here.”
It was Holmes who closed the distance, cradling Watson’s cheek as he kissed him, gentle and sweet, then kissed him again, and again, and once more still, until Watson swore he could taste his smile.
Holmes sipped his drink, though it burned his already raw throat. There were thorns -- only sometimes, but sometimes was enough. That part was sure to only get worse.
Somewhere downstairs, Mrs. Hudson ran the tap and stacked dishes. Outside, a man shouted for a cab. And in Watson’s head, silence. Oppressive, paralyzing silence.
Something had happened which Watson could not follow, but he’d never been able to hold to stoicism when Holmes smiled.
Holmes stepped into Mycroft’s sitting room, removing his hat and setting it on an end table. Mycroft had, of course, gleaned that all was
It required that Holmes believe there was no possibility of any returned affection whatever. It required that he believe that was something Watson could never do.
Dr. Barbary nodded, chewing his lip a moment before speaking again. “You are a very practical man, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “I know that my studies have... raised a few eyebrows since I abandoned medicine, but I hope you will believe me that I would not suggest something to you if I weren’t quite certain of its validity.”
Sherlock doesn’t respond. He wonders why he doesn’t want John to figure it out. He also wonders since when John became so inquisitive.
Sherlock briefly explains about finding the suitcase and his subsequent text message to Jennifer’s missing phone.
“Congratulations!” Her smile widens. “We have a huge selection of cribs here, I know it can be quite overwhelming.”
“Ignore all of that. It’s just the, er, the shock talking.” He slowly gets up and starts walking over towards the tape. His feet move automatically, as if he were magically drawn to the man on the other side.
“It sounds crazy, I know.” She settles her mug on the small table next to her and rests her palms on her lap. “The problem is... John hasn’t really been himself, lately. He has issues concentrating at work and he’s constantly in a bad mood. He’d never mention anything to me, but I know him. He’s miserable. And I think it’s because of his current situation with you.”
“Lilly asked me at kindergarten today. She said that her Mummy and Daddy are just like you and Papa.”
After finishing their drinks, they make their ways to the upstairs floor, aiming for their adjacent hotel rooms. When turning the locker to his door, Sherlock can hear John clearing his throat.
Miller pulls out a remote and presses a button, causing several lights to turn on. Sherlock closes his eyes against the white lights, but quickly reopens them to scan his attacker. He watches Sherlock from above, a frantic grin on his face. How preposterous. Instead of saying anything, he takes Sherlock’s hands and cuffs them together, then does the same with his feet. Sherlock loses balance and jolts forward, causing him to be on all fours in front of the maniac grin.
John has no idea who Sherlock is talking about, but he follows him and Mrs. Hudson downstairs nonetheless. The man waiting for them looks suspiciously like he’s working for the Palace, again.
“This is an old friend of mine, John Watson,” Mike explains. The guy isn’t even looking anymore. He’s typing away on my phone with quick fingers.
John settles in his chair, trying to come up with different pronunciations for the word ‘demon’ in his mind. As usual, a comfortable silence starts to unfold between them. Sherlock closes his eyes, apparently already in his mind palace. John can see his eyes moving behind closed lids, probably reading articles or sorting through files or whatever it is his brilliant mind does in there. His heart-shaped lips are slightly parted, and his fingers are pressed underneath his chin. John could watch him all day.
“So what did you find out?” I ask later. We decided to walk all the way back to the flat, enjoying the cold winter air.
Once she has left, Sherlock slams the living room door shut. Yes, it would definitely be easier to hate her.
“Oh, I’m so sorry but I actually just finished eating with Sherlock.” I clear my throat. “I’ll be home in a minute okay?”
All logic and reasonable thoughts of calling the police first leave John’s mind. He can see Sherlock’s tall body floating inside, his eyes closed. John practically jumps up the stairs and unscrews the lid. The water is already reaching the top of the tank, so all John has to do is jump in head first.
Everything goes according to plan – Sherlock is confident he’ll have the photos within half an hour – when a middle-aged, good-looking woman with dark hair and red lips enters, stark naked.
Sherlock shifted his weight so that he was closer to John and John could feel the heat radiating from his body even through several layers of blanket. With a toddler pressed between them, their shoulders were almost touching.
John throws another jumper into his suitcase whilst humming the Coca-Cola Christmas jingle. He’s not sure why he’s in such a good mood – it might be because of the fabulous spring weather; it might be because he’s spending the weekend at Baskerville looking for a gigantic hound. He adds a scarf to the mess in his case and jogs down the stairs.
Sherlock thinks, really thinks, and blurts out the only reasonable idea he has. He’d be damned if he let John Watson die in this tube carriage with him.
Sherlock has been so deep in his thoughts that he hasn’t even heard John emerge from the bathroom. John is standing in the doorway, wearing nothing but his grey bathrobe, his arms crossed in front of him.
“What was that noise downstairs?” He asks. I turn into the kitchen to see my friend standing at the table wearing safety glasses. I am still taken aback by seeing him here, living and breathing. If he knew how many times I saw him in the last years, always silent, he would definitely laugh at me. Hearing him actually speak still feels like a miracle sometimes. It’s almost been three months since his return from the dead, but I still feel my heart jump a bit whenever I see him. At first I was angry at him for lying to me and not trusting me enough to let me in on his plan. When I found out later that he faked his suicide to protect Mrs Hudson, Greg and me, I forgave him, even though he had given me the toughest two years of my life. In the end, my happiness definitely outweighed my anger.
It was all his fault, really. With his inspirational talk about believing in her wishes, how could he miss that his daughter would wish for
When he turns to Sherlock, he can see that he’s not looking at the sky; he’s staring at him. Their eyes meet and for a moment John forgets the fireworks completely. Sherlock is the first to look away.
“Clearly,” Sherlock replies and resumes his attempt at deducing her. Without the clothes and with the additional make-up, it’s harder than he ever thought it could be.
The police arrests Mr. Saltire for further questioning along with the inn-keeper for suspected murder. Thomas is found shortly afterwards in the cleaning chamber of the inn, exactly where Sherlock has seen him with his father and his half-brother James Wilder the previous night. As Dr. Huxtable explains while driving them to the station, James was found in his father’s mansion brewing over the possibilities to explain Thomas’ sudden re-appearance.
“God, Sherlock, it was awful,” John sighed, sinking down into his own chair. “Wait – how do you… never mind.”
Sherlock immediately pulled her into his arms and started comforting her. John moved closer to them and gently stroked Rosie’s hair. He glanced up at Sherlock, who was looking the other way. It seemed as though he was avoiding John’s eyes.
“It does not, John. If anything, you staying shows that you are the complete opposite of horrible. I’m so incredibly sorry that you had to go through this.”
“I was abroad, as I told you. I did some undercover work in Austria,” he replies, his voice firmer now.
Rosie’s cry wakes me. It’s 5:25 in the morning. This is the longest she has slept in quite a while, I realise, feeling more well-rested than ever in the last year. I quickly go to the nursery, duck my head under Sherlock’s mobile and pick her up from the crib. She’s a tiny baby for her 10 months of age. I rock her in my arms until she finally stops crying.
My heart skips a beat. I turn around to look at him. “Yes, of course I do. Thank you for dinner, Sherlock, I really enjoyed it.” Sherlock doesn’t reply for some time. I should probably turn around and go upstairs, but something is holding me back.
John, taken by surprise, raises an eyebrow. “Not necessarily,” he says, his voice low as well. Sherlock takes a step forward and kisses John again.
She seems fine with his answer, checks the rest of John’s figures and leaves. Sherlock can’t help but think that John would be proud of his politeness, could he hear him. If only he could hear him.
John stays still in the middle of the room, unsure how to proceed. Maybe Sherlock went to Bart’s for another experiment, Greg needed his assistance at a crime scene, Mrs. Hudson went out to buy the groceries with him, or Mycroft decided to finally engage in a brotherly activity – there are a million possible explanations for his absence. For some reason, though, John knows that neither of them are correct.
John, undoing Sherlock’s belt and unzipping his trousers, grins. “It’s not like I’ve never done it before,” he replies, hoping that Sherlock gets the mirroring of his own words from so long ago.
Suddenly I realise that I’m still holding his hand, and release it immediately. Sherlock briefly stares at me before rushing towards the street, leaving me in the dark.
Sherlock takes a deep breath to shoot out his deduction: “Do you see that in the gravel, right here? These are traces of green paint, in two specific patches, about a metre apart. So, a ladder, obviously. There are no windows in the wall so it’s an unusual place to put a ladder. And if you were to put a ladder here, you’d put it in the flower bed, not on the path. Conclusion: The ladder was brought to the house and placed here on purpose. Since Jack’s wife is superstitious, balance of probability tells us that she shares common interests with her husband and that, therefore, he was superstitious, as well. Keith probably knew about his brother’s superstition and arranged for a friend to put a green ladder here once Jack was out of the house for his friend’s stag night. So, Jack drinks a bit too much, returns home in the dark, doesn’t want to walk under the ladder so walks around it, straight into the pond where he drowns. If Keith Downing has a green ladder, he’s the murderer.”
Sherlock entered the kitchen, fully dressed, and came rushing towards John. He held up his hand, revealing a tiny black box inside. John had no time to wonder what the hell it contained when Sherlock stepped forward and opened it. Inside, two silver rings were held in place with the help of a white lace.
“Yes, Mr. Holmes. And I don’t think you’ll decline.” He hands Sherlock an envelope that contains two Business Class boarding passes for Sherlock and John for the flight number 007 to Baltimore.
I look over at Mike immediately. “Yeah, he’s always like that,” he says before I have the chance to ask.
“You... you think she’s still alive?” Mr. Simon seems hopeful and terrified at the same time. When Sherlock nods, I can’t help but feel envy for this man.
“Just shut up, Sherlock,” I say and kiss him again. This time it’s rougher and more passionate. Sherlock opens his mouth and deepens the kiss. I realise that we’re still standing in the living room, so I start to move us over to Sherlock’s bedroom. We keep kissing as we stumble towards it, and somehow there’s still too much space between us. When we finally reach the bedroom, I close the door with my foot and practically slam Sherlock up against the door. He makes a gloriously surprised sound that is music to my ears. I can feel my erection pressing into his. It feels different at first, but glorious. Sherlock’s hands are all over me; he touches my hair and pulls on my shirt. Suddenly I remember that this is probably new territory for him, too.
“Any idea who they are, this underground network? Al-Quaeda; the IRA have been getting restless again. Maybe they’re gonna make an appearance…”
“You look much better, Mr. Saltire. Is there something you’d like to tell us?” Sherlock asks, trying his best to hide his own happiness.
“I was about to take a shower,” John explains, wrapping the towel tighter around his waist. His broad shoulders and bare chest make Sherlock forget what he was about to say. It has been too long since he’s last seen, let alone touch, them.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say next, so he stays silent instead. John is the only person he can share a comfortable silence with. Not the kind of
I open my eyes and find myself half spread out on top of Sherlock. He seems to just be waking up as well. He opens his eyes and for a second I lose myself in them. There’s another knock on the door, so I hurriedly jump out of bed to gather up my clothes. Sherlock does the same, and we get dressed in split seconds. I ruffle my hands through my hair to remove the ‘I just had sex’ messiness and open the door swiftly.
“Not yet, Sherlock,” I whisper and replace the wet hand with my other one. I guide one of my fingers further down, until I reach Sherlock’s ass. He shivers at the touch and groans. I enter him slowly, stretching him and opening him up as careful as possible. Once Sherlock feels comfortable, I add a second finger.
“Tell that to the police,” Sherlock replies coldly and dials the number of the incompetent officer from the first day. He looks over to John who is still watching him.
“You’ve no idea,” Mike agrees. The guy looks up at us for a second before returning to his work. His eyes are green (or perhaps blue?).
“Happy drowning! I will be watching from the port whole outside,” Miller says, pointing to the long stripe of glass right underneath them.
Fatherhood had changed him, although he’d never willingly admit it. It had made him settle down in a way John had never thought possible, and it had made him love another human being with all his heart. Sherlock cared for Rosie so deeply that it sometimes still baffled John.
John doesn’t know what to do, so he just stands next to the bed awkwardly, watching Sherlock eat his soup. Maybe he should just leave.
John slowly tilted his head forward, anticipation flooding his body. He had kissed Sherlock once before, and had laid awake many night since then wondering if he’d ever feel those lips again. Sherlock still stared at him with dark eyes, his breath so close John could feel it on his lips.
The warmth in his chest expands even more. Sherlock decides that they talked enough for the night, grabs John’s head with his hand and presses their lips together again. After all, he can now use a language with John that’s so much more efficient than English.
I hear a grunt from the living room. Sherlock is lying on the couch, in his thinking-position. He’s wearing a dressing gown over a shirt, one of the many things I’ve always found curious. Why wear a comfy dressing gown but keep the shirt underneath? He has his eyes closed and doesn’t open them when I enter.
He went to his room and picked up the suit he hadn’t noticed before. The dark fabric felt wonderful in his hands and John wondered why the suit didn’t seem familiar to him.
After Rosie’s breakfast we decide to leave for the park. It’s quite cold outside, but sunny, which is a nice replacement after all the rain in the last couple of days. Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister, so she can’t come along. We walk to the park with Rosie in the stroller, and once we arrive Sherlock takes her directly to the swing. I watch them from the bench and smile every time Rosie giggles and pedals with her tiny feet. Sherlock pushes her and helps her down once she’s had enough. They play in the sand for a while and I join them. Even though it’s freezing outside, the sand is still ductile. Rosie and I build a sandcastle for Sherlock and bake sand cakes. When I can’t possibly bend my knees any longer, I return to the bench and watch Sherlock play with my daughter.
Sherlock waves his hands dismissively. “Well, I was grocery shopping and they were a special offer.”
“Well, yes, actually. Do you have something in?” Remembering the thumbs in the fridge, John quickly adds: “Or should we get take-out?”
“Mr. Watson, please, calm down. Your husband doesn’t want to see you right now.” The words hurt more than John’s
“Yes, okay.” John seems insecure. He doesn’t know where to go, so Sherlock reaches for his hand, as usual, and is surprised to feel John’s hand stiffen.
John knows exactly what she’s talking about. He takes her hand and stares at the bed sheets for a moment, not sure if telling his wife about his bond to another person is a good idea.
