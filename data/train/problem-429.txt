"There is no room here. And we're busy and I can't have you . . ." He stopped and watched her smile falter a bit. "I can't deal with it right now. Things are still new here."
“John wasn’t being selfish – Sherlock didn’t really want much of the meat. In fact, he had just the right amount,” Sherlock clarified. “And the tiger didn’t eat them because Sherlock had helped the tiger the week before. Sherlock is a good boy to know.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I won’t be long,” he said. “I’m just going to Bart’s . . . for Molly. Yes, Molly called.” He swung his scarf around his neck and moved to leave.
When he came back downstairs an hour later, John almost felt like a whole new person. He tried not to focus on the feeling -- it made him feel a bit guilty if he was honest, but he couldn't go out into the world the way he looked before. He grabbed his coat and snuck out of the flat. He loved her, but he didn't need Mrs Hudson fussing over him. He hailed a cab and as soon as he arrived, he started interviewing. He jotted down notes and looked for clues like Sherlock used to, but he couldn't see things the way he had. If he solved this, it’d be based on the facts. After he went to talk to a couple employees, took a break for lunch, and picked up with an assistant and finally Williams himself.
"John will be back soon," he said. "I need to work. You need to stop talking to me. You can talk to John when he returns."
“About my having to be there alone,” Sherlock said. He paused for a minute. “I never fit in, John. I never liked it.”
“Then how do you breathe?” Sherlock said before hanging up. “See I know some good jokes as well,” he said to John.
Mycroft moved over and sat down at the table. “Obviously,” he said. “What are your intentions?” he asked casually, as if he wasn’t actually interested.
"I guess we're going to find out together," John said. "But I'm sure you'd have noticed something by now if there was anything like that."
“No, you haven’t,” she said. “You’re just nervous.” She brought in some glasses to set on the table. “John, you play sports -- you must get nervous before matches. Tell him it’ll be all right.”
“No one was there,” Sherlock said. “I looked around the whole office -- even went into a room that had been ripped apart, where I fell. I was sure I’d seen someone, but . . . no one was there.”
“Is that a seagull on that guy’s head?” he asked. “Wait, no I guess it’s his hair. What a ridiculous haircut.”
Sherlock leaned closer and looked at John, meeting his eyes for a moment. "No matter what, John, I love you," he said and then kissed his mouth. The soft kiss quickly turned more urgent as he gripped John's shoulder to turn his body toward him.
When they finished up at the restaurant they talked out on the sidewalk for a bit, both of them about to go separate ways. John wondered about Clara, but Harry didn't bring her up so John didn't either. They headed back to the flat and, after some hugs and goodbyes, true to her word, Harry grabbed her bags to head out to the halfway house.
"Not at all, dear. The roast is in the oven, I am just keeping busy. Have you opened any fun presents?"
"But it's not normal, is it?" Sherlock asked. "I mean . . . it's different, right? You haven't changed your mind, have you?"
"Nowhere, I guess," Sherlock said. "I just want to put my clothes on." He slipped his arms into his shirt. "Are you going somewhere?"
"What? No," John said. "I go to shows and see how people are reacting to the bands he's hired to promote."
Sherlock watched them get up to go. “If I’m working when you get home, don’t disturb me,” he said needlessly. Everyone knew he had no work to do, but that detail didn’t matter to his point.
"What are you talking about?" Sherlock said, starting to get annoyed. He patted his pocket. “Just a cigarette then . . . I just need to get out of the flat.”
John was sipping his drink as the opening band came on. The lights dimmed, and he settled into his new spot before he felt someone standing too close to him. He glanced over and saw the man again, smiling at him.
Sherlock scowled. "Fine," he said, moving past John, thinking about what a sacrifice he was making and how he could use that against John in the future. He went upstairs and went straight to his room. He dropped his things off and flopped onto his bed, before realising he wanted a cup of tea. Obviously, it wasn't going to work, hiding in his room until she left. So he got up and moved to the kitchen to put on the kettle.
"I -- it's okay, never mind," John said. "I just thought you'd want to try something different, just in case."
"Are you sure you're okay?" John asked softly. Sherlock seemed to be trying to get out of his grasp.
John looked over at the woman who was speaking to him. "Right," he said. He walked under the tape and to the street to hail a cab back to the flat. When he got to Baker Street, he found the flat empty. He didn't understand. Sherlock had invited him along and then had just left him. Had he asked just to be nice? John sighed and headed up to his room.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, eager to talk through his initial findings. It always helped talking to John -- he often asked good questions, but even when he sat silently, the process of explaining things to him sometimes helped Sherlock to see a new perspective. He detailed to John what was unusual about the blood he’d looked at -- he told him about a couple theories, but admitted at this point he still didn’t really know exactly what they were dealing with.
"Just okay?" John took a drink. "I guess I can't blame you for thinking that, I haven't quite lived up to anything spectacular this quarantine."
He thought about the wedding. He’d enjoyed talking to John, he’d made the whole night so much more enjoyable. He’d enjoyed dancing with him. And the rest of it as well. He probably shouldn’t be thinking about that now. He tried to concentrate on the talking part. He’d assumed that maybe there would be talking if John moved in. In fact, he was surprised to realise he’d actually been looking forward to that. He got up again and made some tea. He glanced up to John’s room. The door was still shut but he could hear him moving around. He poured two mugs and carried them upstairs, using his knee to knock on the door.
“Like sometimes you slept in here with me, like it was our bed,” Sherlock said quietly. “Or on the sofa while we were watching the television, we . . . you know. . . cuddled.”
Sherlock hadn’t had internet access for a while. He missed John even more -- it was stupid, of course, because John didn’t know it was Sherlock behind those messages, but Sherlock did and the conversations were comforting even though their subject matter was imaginary. On the train, he took out paper and began writing John a letter. He didn’t mention anything about being gone or what he was doing while gone. Instead he wrote about his favourite memories and how John was always in them.
“You’ll be here at least one more night,” Mycroft continued. “I’ve got to leave now. Since John is here, I’m sure he can keep you entertained. Shall I go to the flat to get some things for you for your trip?”
Obviously Sherlock had thought about this already, but had decided that perhaps it might be better for some of his living habits to be discovered when they occurred. “I don’t keep regular sleeping hours,” he said. “And while it won’t be my intention, I cannot guarantee that you won’t be disturbed at some point.”
“That’s true, but even before all this, it wasn’t great,” Sherlock said. “Of course, now we don’t live there anymore, so we don’t have to worry. Do you think we both understand everything in the flat?”
Sherlock smiled when it changed colour and bubbled up to the top. “Excellent,” he said, grabbing some kitchen roll and cleaning up the spill. Then he jotted down a few notes, writing in John’s name as part of the result. “Thanks for your help,” he said.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could hear John breathing, feel his body against his, smell his scent. It felt comfortable -- like home. This was the best he’d felt in days. “Thank you,” he said as well as he felt himself relaxing into sleep.
Sherlock was a little confused by what was happening. He felt John’s finger on his skin and it felt quite nice. He still felt cold, so he wrapped his arms around John’s body, pulling him closer. “You’re soft,” he mumbled.
Mrs Hudson swatted at Sherlock’s arm with a laugh. “I’m going to . . . go somewhere else for a moment,” she said and moved away from the table.
“Good,” Sherlock said. “You should eat a good meal so you have energy for later.” He glanced over. “For the adventure, I mean.”
“Wrong. I like you and you are never boring,” Sherlock said. “See? Our friendship works perfectly -- I’ve no need to risk boredom with dating.”
The man acknowledged John and then pulled away from the kerb. “Sherlock told me to tell you to stop worrying,” he said.
Sherlock thought for a moment, remembering. “Well, we’ll see -- he’s going to come by soon and we can talk about it,” he said. He grabbed his mug and stood up. “I’m going to go shower,” he said. “Thanks . . . for the talk.”
Sherlock pulled his head back and leaned his forehead against John's. "I don't want to stop, okay?" he asked. "Not yet."
"I hope so too," he said. "Sherlock, how did you know about that place? I mean, enough to vouch for it?"
And what kind of drastic thing would he do anyway? The thought that he would plan something at all took him by surprise. He shifted again and punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape. He wasn't going to do anything. He was going to sleep and keep his mouth shut and everything would go back to normal when Sherlock got back.
John groaned as Sherlock's body squeezed around him. He moaned and pushed deep, calling Sherlock’s name as he came.
Sherlock nodded, pulling on John’s shirt and then stopping and letting John do it. He watched him for a minute and then started to take off his own trousers. John pushed his trousers off as well, his eyes moving over Sherlock's body.
John smiled. "I am," he said. "I've rarely seen you so uninterested in a case -- not that I'm complaining."
Sherlock poured two mugs and carried them into the sitting room. He sat on the sofa to wait. The flat felt a bit different already.
“Stop here,” Sherlock said to the driver. He threw him some money, and then ran the rest of the way, scanning the area. Lestrade saw him and came up to stop him. “They’re going in,” he said. “Stay out here -- let them do their job.”
Sherlock put the boxes down on the bed. “I’ll make tea,” he said. “Come down if you’d like some.” He headed to the kitchen and started the kettle.
“Good,” she said. She got the milk out of the fridge. “You’ve not got much food in there -- you are eating, right? You told me you’ve been eating.”
The nurse looked back at the computer and clicked a few times. "Oh. Well, can I see ID please? We take the privacy of our patients --"
John got up and followed Sherlock into the kitchen. "I didn't have plans," he said, looking Sherlock up and down. "But now I think I have something fun in mind . . ."
"Good -- no head bumping tonight," Sherlock said. "Unless that's the kind of thing you're into," he added with a wink. He had no idea what that meant really, but it felt a bit like flirting and he liked it.
John was surprised and looked away from him. Sherlock did seem to be able to figure things out. "I had to see a therapist when I came back from the war. I had a very painful limp and . . . stress. She thought a blog would help me assimilate. I was angry and bitter when I came back . . . I was shot, and I can't be a surgeon anymore."
Sherlock was surprised, but for some reason, he didn’t want to appear so. He stepped forward. “Is that what we did in your dream?” he asked. He looked John right in the eye. “What else did we do? Show me.”
“I didn’t watch,” Sherlock corrected. “I read. I don’t know what I’ll like best since I’ve never done any of it.” He looked over. “But it seems like you might have an idea what you prefer, so let’s do that. Do you have condoms?”
Sherlock didn’t think that deserved a response, so he turned his attention back to the flat. He needed to figure out how to make this seem like any other night. “What should I do while you cook?” he asked, though that was not a question he would have asked on any other night.
Sherlock took a sip of tea and then started the film. They watched for a few minutes. “This is so incredibly boring,” he said, glancing over at John.
"My former flatmates," Sherlock said quietly. He leaned a little closer to his screen as if doing so would make the everything else in the room disappear.
“Honestly, John,” Sherlock said, looking over. “Everything now will be honestly.” He looked down for a minute and added, “Were they difficult? The cases, I mean.”
After a shower, he headed out, got a newspaper and read it in a coffee shop before going for a wander. He could handle being around people when he knew there was no chance of interacting with them. When he realised he was about an hour’s walk away from home, he decided to text Lestrade for an update, hoping he’d have another task to keep Sherlock busy until a proper case came along. He did his best to sound eager without sounding stupid, not sure he’d succeeded at either. He got no reply so he headed home.
“Well, maybe you should,” Sherlock said. He took another drink before adding, “That’s what I am saying to you.”
"You . . . oh. You?" John asked, a bit surprised. He couldn't imagine it. He remembered Lestrade's drug bust, but had been utterly convinced it'd just been an excuse to pressure Sherlock into backing off the case.
They headed out, taking a taxi to the gallery. Sherlock was quiet on the ride, thinking about the potential answers to his questions and what they would mean to the next step of the solution. He was going to solve this and show Scotland Yard he could be trusted.
John leaned up to kiss him, moving his own body to match Sherlock's. Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, letting the pleasure fill his entire body. Then he opened his eyes again -- he wanted to see John, know that this pleasure was about him, about them together. Finally.
"I was thinking about you all day," Sherlock said. "Obviously, because I was trying to make everything nice for you. But I always think of you all day -- even with cases, because you're part of the cases. You're part of everything, really," he added as if this were the first time it all made such clear sense.
John closed his eyes. He knew he should go up to his room, but he was actually quite comfortable and didn’t want to disturb Sherlock. He dozed off right there, snoring softly within minutes.
“We?” Sherlock said, looking up and over at John. “Is this a true story? I thought bedtime stories were supposed to be fantastical, not realistic. I’m not sure you’re good at this.” He smiled and kicked his foot against John’s leg.
"Am I?" Sherlock asked as he slid his hands to the sides of John's head, cradling it.  "You've never mentioned it before.
Sherlock looked over. “Have you thought about taking a bath? The shower helped me, but a soak might be good for you.”
"Fair enough,” John said, remembering. “But I'd have asked you to leave if I hadn’t wanted you to stay." He smiled. "You can come back tonight if you want to try again."
John threw his clothes over at Sherlock. He pulled on Sherlock's trousers -- they wouldn't button and they were too long. Sherlock's shirt was tight in the arms. "If this rips I'm not replacing it," he said.
He took it from her and set it on his bag. "What is it? A cheque? Have you two been paying him to tolerate me?" he asked.
"We ran into each other yesterday. We're going to go on a little trip once we sort the details.”  She seemed to want to ask a hundred more questions, but he hurried out of the kitchen and headed to Sherlock’s.
"I . . . not specifically," he said. He was pacing the sitting room again. This was harder than he expected.
Sherlock wasted the night and next day getting himself lost in Molly’s social media. She knew a lot of men named John, but none of them was the right John. He could tell by Molly’s photos she wasn’t back in London yet, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to ask her anyway.
“They needed to prove they could be responsible. For three days they cared for this rat in secret. They were planning on surprising their mum, you know, to show her they could take care of another living creature. Well, sometime during the night the rat escaped and ended up eating its way through the kitchen. Mum woke up and went berserk, everyone was screaming. The rat was set free, and we were grounded for a month. Needless to say we did not get a dog. Or any pet."
Sherlock, too, had dreams. He was in a crowd, facing away from whatever everyone else was looking at. Way at the back was the man who had grabbed his arm at the bar. He was mouthing something, but Sherlock couldn’t understand. He tried to push through people to get to him, to find out what he was trying to tell him, but he couldn’t locate him.
“I’m not the expert, am I?” Sherlock said. “It just doesn’t seem right.” He stepped to the side a little, a subtle invitation for John to come in.
Sherlock stood up and thought for a moment. Then he sat back down and picked up his phone. "Mrs Hudson?" he said after dialing her number. "Can you come up for a moment?" He gave John a smarmy smile and then stood up and moved into the kitchen.
"Meddled? Hardly! I just borrowed your coat. I didn't search it out anything." He hovered his hands over the pockets. "Should I?"
Sherlock nodded. “I’m sleeping in his bed, just to annoy him,” he said, heading back to the kitchen. “Which I suppose means I’ve not yet grown up.” He opened the back door and motioned for John to sit down at the table with him. He lit up a cigarette. “It is quite calm here -- I thought I’d hate it more, but I think I can tolerate it now that you’re with me.” He felt his cheeks flush from such obvious sentiment.
John pulled his laptop up while he waited for Sherlock to come back. There was no email from the surgery, but he suddenly remembered he’d bought that other ticket at the shop. He reached down for his trousers and got the slip out of his pocket, checking the numbers online. He grinned when he saw he’d won a hundred pounds. "Oh Sherlock!" he called.
For all the talk John was doing to Sherlock that night they’d buried the box, he felt like a hypocrite when he walked into school alone. It was like his first day ever all over again. He saw friends comparing classes and lunch breaks, and he had no one to do that with. It didn't matter when he had chemistry or maths or lunch because Sherlock wasn't going to be in any of them. He wondered how Sherlock was doing at his new school and hoped he was handling it okay. He was going to have to write as soon as he could -- maybe they could still talk about those things, and it would make everything feel a little bit more normal. He couldn’t wait until sixth form when they bring their phones to class.
He opened the flat door to see John lying on the sofa. “You are a sight for a sore eyes,” he said with a genuine smile.
“Well, I want a word with the vicar -- it’s hardly a sanctuary if I can’t do what makes me most comfortable,” Sherlock said. He was pouting. He hadn’t wanted to come, but Mrs Hudson said he’d had to.
His dad patted his back as he sat down. “Everything seem the same around here?” he asked before pouring himself a cup.
"I'm only stating facts. That's what you always do," John said. He came back into the sitting room and peeked at the computer. "Anything good?”
“So he followed John for the day. He watched John help a kid who was getting beat up by a bully. He watched him stop an attempted robbery, and he watched him save an old lady who’d had a heart attack. Watching John be so great all the time got a little tiring actually, but mostly what Sherlock felt was safe. He knew he was safe with John, no matter what.”
"I only came up with one game, I hope that will be okay," he said. "What you have planned sounds very intense."
“Anyway, after they ate, Sherlock did the washing up and then they both did some reading and then it was time to go to bed. When they went to sleep, John dreamt about all the things they would do together the next day and for always.”
John nodded, trying to imagine Sherlock's parents and what this holiday might be like. "I think he will be okay. I don't know about Mycroft though."
“Why do you care?” John asked. “I mean, why are you working on the case? How’d you even find out about him?
“No, I just think the average person would find it . . . boring. And might not understand what your work is.”
John came up the stairs practising what he was going to say to Sherlock when he saw him. No matter how he played it out in his head, Sherlock was going to freak out, he was sure of it. Finally he decided he would just wing it and say whatever came out in the moment. He let himself in and hung his jacket. "Sherlock!" he called out, taking his shoes off at the door.
"That's . . . where I imagined touching you and . . . wondered how you might taste," John moaned softly.
“As long as no one got hurt,” she said. She tousled Sherlock’s hair. “Since you’re already here, do you boys want to set the table for us?”
“I don’t know about that,” Sherlock said. “But I am impatient. I’m tired of watching all those people.” He finished his drink. “Can we go?”
“If you knew me well, you’d know I find most things awkward,” Sherlock said. “You said the location suited you.”
“It’s not my fault what happens when I’m asleep,” Sherlock said. He quickly moved his foot close to John’s face and then moved it back. “Remember the first time you slept over and you had to call your mum in the middle of the night?” he laughed.
They lay quietly for a few minutes, and then Sherlock said, "It's just that I'm nervous. We said we'd be honest, so I am. But we should just watch the film."
Once they were out of sight, Sherlock lit a cigarette and handed it to his father. He lit another for himself.
Sherlock looked at John’s face in the dark. He moved his head and softly kissed John’s lips. “Like that?” he asked.
But that’s not what he did. When he finished, he fell asleep for an hour and then for some reason, he found himself on Molly’s Facebook face, scrolling through her list of friends.
“Do you want to pour in the last thing?” Sherlock asked. “If I’m right, it’ll turn blue and bubble but it won’t explode in your face -- I promise.” He held out the beaker to John.
Once they’d hung up, Sherlock stood looking out the window for a few moments. He had started something with this chap and he wasn’t sure why or how it would end. Then he lay down on the sofa to think for a while and when he opened his eyes again, the flat was dark. He got up and checked his email -- he had something from another client. He wrote back immediately requesting an appointment and then realised it was almost midnight, so it was likely he’d have to wait until tomorrow. Today was quite a good day really, he thought. He took a cup of tea into his bedroom and read until he fell asleep.
John raised his hand in a wave. Greg have him some more information about the case, the woman, and her habits. He studied a photo of her and headed out to get started. This was going to be interesting.
"Don't you dare, John Watson," Sherlock scolded. "What a man keeps in his coat pockets is his own business."
“I help all the time,” Sherlock said, deciding to make a claim without any evidence whatsoever. “Actually, I thought you’d offer to help with cases if needed -- how is that going to work if you just disappear without letting me know where you are?”
Sherlock smiled against John’s ear. He had a decision to make, he knew that. He closed his eyes for a moment to clear his head -- this decision needed him to be clear -- and thought. About pleasure but also about consequences. He opened his eyes. “Would you like to find out?” he asked softly.
“No time,” his mum said. “Dinner’s at five -- I know it’s early, but you know your grandpa . . . you can play in the shed tomorrow.”
Sherlock looked over at John. That was surprising. He’d been expecting John to want them to do something for Christmas together. Sherlock thought he was getting used to John’s sentimentality, but it appears he was wrong about this one. “Mycroft,” Sherlock said instead. “Mycroft is always the big deal.”
“Because you literally cannot bear not being in charge of me,” Sherlock said. “It’s been just over 24 hours and you couldn’t stand it anymore.”
"Really? You've never stolen anything from a workplace?" Sherlock said, with a smile as he squeezed John's hand.
“I’m not sure I believe that,” Sherlock said. “I have a feeling you remember the important things.” He took another bite and sat back in his chair a little. “We should probably find out more about each other. Do you have family?”
Harry had gone upstairs to get her coat. "Can you tell Angelo ahead of time not to bring wine to the table?" John asked Sherlock quietly. "Since you two talk."
John rolled his eyes when he saw the message. He found the emoji with the middle finger and sent three of them to Sherlock. When he continued making his lunch, he started slamming things for real.
"Is that what you wanted to talk about?" she asked. "A flat? I think I know of a flat share right in the perfect place."
John crawled into bed and stared up at the ceiling. He wondered if Sherlock would know John had been in there, in his bed. He closed his eyes. He'd had so many dreams, nightmares, hopes . . .now Sherlock was really here and now neither of them knew how to act or what to say.
Sherlock nibbled at his food. A server came round to ask if anyone would like another drink, and when she left, he leaned in and said to John, “She was quite beautiful -- perhaps she’s the one you were meant to find?”
"Yeah, I think I may have liked you the kissing way too, but I just never knew. I mean, we were young but now . . ."
Sherlock rolled over and said, “Yes, I do want to do it again. But I don’t want you to go out and do it with other people. Now that I know what it’s like . . . I don’t want you to. Maybe you’d like it better with a girl or with someone else, but I don’t want you to do it with anyone else.”
Sherlock found his room and unlocked the door. His things were on the bed. He moved them to the floor and dropped his bag. He immediately went into the bathroom and took a hot shower. He walked naked to the bed, climbed in and fell asleep.
They finished eating and John did the washing up. He put the kettle on and then went to get his laptop, opening his email and skimming through the Inbox. After a minute he gasped. "Sherlock! I’ve got an interview tomorrow!"
“Good,” Sherlock said, looking up at John. “You’re ready. Let me go change while you decide where you want to go.” He stood up from his desk to head into his room.
John got out of the shower and saw his phone screen was lit up. He checked his messages and saw an address and a band name. He didn't know the band, but he'd been to the bar before. He was glad about that -- knowing the layout of the place ahead of time helped him keep a low profile. He threw some gel in his hair and ran his hands through it before getting dressed. Dark jeans, a t-shirt, and his jacket. He made sure his wallet and phone were in his pocket before grabbing his keys. He let his friend know he was on his way and went out to hail a cab.
“I don’t think things will go back to how they were,” Sherlock said. “I suppose I don’t want them to, as much as I’ve complained about all this.”
John took his shirt off and threw it to the side, pushing his pants down as well. As soon as they were nude, Sherlock slid his body next to John’s, tangling their legs. He kissed his mouth hard as he let his hands explore John’s skin.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stared out the window. “Wait a minute,” he said suddenly. “Why did he call you and not me?”
"Excuse me, but it's not that I can't," John said indignantly. "I haven't wanted to yet. I just need to find someone I want to be with like that."
After an hour, the biker dropped him off at a small hotel. Neither man spoke. Sherlock went inside. The man at the desk said, “Mr Smith, we’ve been expecting you.” He handed Sherlock a key and nodded down a hallway.
John stood. "More next time. Together, okay?" He brought Sherlock's hand to his own cock again, bucking into it.
John climbed into the shower and stood under the water for a long time. Sherlock didn't even want to talk about the night before. John must have been right that it was all the heat of the moment.
Sherlock grabbed the box and retrieved the lock for the shed. “You can lean your shovel outside and then take it when you go,” he added as he moved to the door.
"Hmm." John took a sip as he thought of the next one. "I've never . . . been turned on by one of my flatmates."
"I don’t mean cases . . . just because Sherlock is out of town doesn't mean you can . . . explore your freedom," she said, giving him a stern look.
“You should go to bed -- you worked two jobs today, right?” Sherlock asked. He turned off the television. “You’re obviously tired.”
“That’s one way of looking at it,” Sherlock said. He looked over. “You do look very smart even though your hair’s a little shaggy.”
Sherlock pinched John's side before leaning over to slide John's cock into his mouth. He held the base and moved up and down the length, using his tongue to swirl around the shaft. John moaned and squirmed as he struggled not to buck up into his mouth. “Fuck, Sherlock,” he mumbled.
“I doubt it, John,” Sherlock said stupidly. “You are the better looking one,” he added, glancing up at John’s face.
“I love skiing,” she said. She led them to a little bench and they sat down. They were still holding hands.
John's cheeks warmed as he smiled. "You too. Well, you have every time I've seen you, but I should tell you as well."
Sherlock smiled back and then looked out the window. The taxi pulled up in front of John’s, and Sherlock quickly slipped the driver some notes before following John to his door.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m sure you do, but not yet,” he said, now stroking John while lightly massaging his balls. He glanced up and said, “You can touch what I need from the drawer, though.” He nodded toward the nightstand. John reached over and grabbed the lube for him.
"I suppose we could spend more time together, maybe move in together and see how that goes," Sherlock suggested cheekily. "Maybe even if we worked together . . . maybe then we could see how we feel . . ."
“I’m sorry, John,” Mrs Hudson said. “I seem like a nag -- I’m not your mother. I’m your friend.” She brought the tea in. “You’ve been doing okay?” she asked as she sat down.
“I thought you said you didn’t have any friends, John said to him. I didn’t, Sherlock said, but now that we’ve met, I have one. And this guy will have food to feed my friend."
“Well, I thought you were also charming until I noticed how quickly you turned on me last night,” Sherlock said. “It was cruel.”
"I'll be up in my room, watching movies on my computer and reading," he said. He finished eating and got up to clean his plate and get something to drink.
“As am I,” Sherlock said, squeezing John’s arm around him. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, his whole body and brain comfortable and relaxed. Satisfied.
It wasn’t long until Sherlock was agitated again. It was strange -- before John moved in a few months ago, Sherlock had always preferred being alone. But now it seemed that Sherlock actually liked being with John -- yes, sometimes he was frustrating, but overall things just seemed better when John was around him. He picked up his phone.
The odd question -- and rather the odd moment for it -- didn't quite register with John. His brain was clouded with pleasure. Everything about Sherlock felt incredible. He nodded, huffing a 'yes' into Sherlock's jaw before kissing his way to his mouth.
They shifted until they both had hands on each other, stroking, kissing, and breathing together. It was hot, sensual, and John could hardly think straight. Sherlock swiped his thumb over the tip of John's cock and he gasped -
Sherlock glanced around the room. “I’m not convinced here is the right place . . . what kind of person are you looking for?” he asked.
John woke up the next morning and took a moment to process the silence. Last year Sherlock was playing music at this time. He sighed and got out of bed. He knew Mrs Hudson would be up soon, and he didn't want her to find him lying around still. He took a quick shower and went down to start the kettle.
He closed his eyes and thought about kissing John last night. It was good. Then it dawned on him that they hadn’t kissed this morning. Why not? Had John changed his mind -- was it just because of the excitement of the danger? Oh God, Sherlock thought, sitting up. Was that what John had meant when he wanted to talk about “the other thing”? He got up and rushed to the bathroom, stepping inside.
"That would be cruel," Sherlock said, putting away the bread, cheese and mayonnaise. He started washing the plate and cutting board. "You've not been cruel to me in the last few days . . . are you going to start now?"
John was struggling harder now, wondering how much commotion he could cause in the chair to buy himself more time.  He tried to tip forward but the chair was heavy, his legs weren't low enough to hold him weight even if he did propel himself forward.
Sherlock felt slightly annoyed -- he’d done something nice to no avail. He got up, made a cup of tea and went to the window to smoke a cigarette. This wasn’t going to work if he had unnecessary reactions to everything John did or didn’t do. Was he just looking for something to be annoyed by? That was a bit stupid.
Sherlock took a sip of tea, though he was already feeling quite warm inside. "That is good to know," he said. He sat back, a little more relaxed. That part of the talk had gone well. "Should we talk about the other thing?" he asked tentatively.
John rolled his eyes and went down to have a quick breakfast. He hoped they wouldn't kill each other while he was gone.
“You were also right that the owner doesn’t exist. He wasn’t created by anyone at the gallery, though.”
"Well, you wanted to warm up, didn't you? A drink will help," John got up and opened the cabinet. "Wine or brandy?"
Sherlock looked at him closely and then shifted slightly, moving his hand and taking a drink of tea. "I don't think you should stay up too late," he said. "What do you want to do?"
“I like it,” Sherlock said, his voice low as he watched his hand moving. He reached his other one up to stroke John’s cock as well. A noise, almost like a deep growl, escaped from his throat.
“I refuse to accept that,” he said. He looked at his watch. “All right, we each have 24 hours to come up with something to do tomorrow that is interesting like we used to be. Whatever we each come up with, we both have to do it. Deal?”
“I did,” Sherlock said. “I’ll have it sorted by tomorrow. It’s a ridiculous drug -- there’s no way any high is worth what it will do.” He looked over. “Have you found out who the dealer is?”
Mrs Hudson had reminded him to say something nice to her about the wedding, but this time Sherlock didn’t need prompting: she looked happier than he’d ever seen her so he told her that.
“I thought of it last night before I went to sleep and got up early this morning to make sure we had the equipment,” Sherlock said. “I take challenges very seriously, as you know.”
“As soon as we know you can move around safely, you’ll go -- on your own. To rest,” Mycroft stated. He looked at John for back up.
Sherlock didn’t want to argue about it. He’d known what John’s reaction would be, but it still felt important to say. He waited a few minutes. “I don’t really want to go to this new school, John,” he said softly.
“See?” he said to Mrs Hudson as they made their way to a taxi. “I behaved. Does this mean we can go home now?”
John finished up and went to his room to get dressed for his date. He put his wallet in his back pocket and grabbed his jacket before coming down again.
Sherlock watched the interaction between the two siblings. It felt like he should say something and, while normally that feeling was irrelevant to him, John's serious tone made a difference. "I agree with John," he said. He quickly met John's eyes and then took a drink of water.
“We are most definitely not fighting!” John called, laughing a little.  He draped a leg over Sherlock and whispered, “Get rid of him.”
“Fuck,” Sherlock moaned at the sight of it. He squeezed his eyes tight and got lost in the sound and movement on the bed.
John didn't know how long he tossed and turned. The room was dark and the flat was quiet. He got up and crept down the stairs, looking at the mess he made. Slowly he started cleaning it up, carefully arranging everything as quietly as he could before going back to bed.
Sherlock shifted a little in the bed, turning toward John. “Stop talking -- I was practically asleep and you woke me up,” he teased.
"Yeah," John said. He went to the kitchen and got that first before getting a couple small wash cloths and coming back to the room.
John grinned as they kissed. He flipped them and straddled Sherlock, tugging his pajamas down. "Are you in a hurry?"
In his bedroom, John shifted under the covers, his dream fading. He was already losing details, but he could hear . . . something. He thought it was part of his dream, so he ignored it and tried to doze off again. But the shouting continued and finally his sleepy brain caught up enough to realise it was coming from downstairs, that it was Sherlock shouting.
With graduation approaching, he was eating lunch with his friends. Everyone was talking about summer plans and trips. John wasn't going anywhere fancy. He was going to look for a job and get himself ready for training.
Sherlock sat in the taxi, willing it to move through the streets more quickly. He felt afraid. He closed his eyes and thought of John. He hoped the police were on their way. “Hurry,” he said to them and to the driver.
"Just one, right?" he asked. If Sherlock had been behind every case he'd worked, John didn't know what he would do.
Finally, he said, “I didn’t think . . . I’m sorry . . .” He set the laptop to the side. “Do you want me to go to my room?” he asked quietly.
"No! Because it's . . . it just is! You have to see why it would be. We're friends - the dream makes it look like I just think about jumping you all the time and I don't!"
That piqued Sherlock’s curiosity, and he’d agreed. In truth, John was still away, and Sherlock had been bored.
John got out of the bed and gathered the stuff he brought, getting the box Sherlock showed him while he grabbed his own stuff. "Are we sneaking or did you ask?"
Sherlock shook his head and stood up to move to the kitchen. “You should probably know I was lying –- I’m not going to clean up. Well, I will, but I want to finish this tonight since I don’t have class tomorrow. But I will clean it up eventually so you don’t need to nag,” he added with a cheeky smile.
“Good,” Sherlock said, squeezing him a little. “Until then we can be around each other all the time, right? Except for if we get jobs or whatever, I know. I just mean, we’ll be able to be together like this, okay?”
Sherlock’s mouth moved all over John as he started to pump his finger. He liked John’s reactions -- his own cock ached for release. He slipped in another finger to open John up.
"He was looking out for you. 'Don't hurt John. Don't disappoint him.' Is that what you've been telling him? That I'm a loser?"
“I’ll try,” Sherlock said, not entirely sure what that meant or if he could actually manage it. “Are you cross with me?”
“Well, John . . .,” Sherlock said, his voice trailing. “It’s hard to say . . . because I don’t know what your reaction will be.”
Sherlock turned to focus on the salad. “Yes, well, I think sweetness might be a symptom of the fall so assume it’s temporary,” he said. “There’s wine as well -- will you pour it?”
Tonight Sherlock felt worried and jealous and a little bit sad. John was making him have these feelings, and he needed to figure out what to do.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Mycroft said. “I said no work -- or have you forgotten already?”
Sherlock stood staring out the window, holding his mug up to his face to protect it from the frigid feeling that seeped through the glass.
Sherlock thought for a moment. Then he came up with a plan. "How about you then? You don't seem very boring," he said. "What do you want to tell me about yourself?" He brought his tea in and sat down in his chair.
They stayed close together until Sherlock calmed down. After a few minutes, he said, “I suppose a lot has changed.”
She didn’t turn away from the kettle but said, “Fine, I’ll put something together if you insist. Actually, I got something special for you from the French market -- let me see if I can find it.” She moved over to the fridge and pulled out a cheeseboard with some holly as garnish in each corner. “Oh, here it is,” she said, reaching for some crackers.
"Okay," John nodded, letting his hands fall and watching Sherlock's instead. Then he looked up at Sherlock's focused face, studying every detail.
"Hmm? Yes please," John said, putting the computer on the coffee table to stretch. He had just leaned back when he heard pounding on the door downstairs. His stomach dropped and he rushed downstairs quickly, opening the door and watching Harry stomp past him.
John just stopped her from touching a beaker. "Don't touch anything. It could be poisoned, and that's not an empty threat around here. My room is upstairs."
John smiled at him. "I know it’s you," he said. "You're the only one that makes me feel this good," he said, trying to shift for more.
Sherlock moaned a response as he moved to John’s chest, covering it with kisses and sucking on his nipple. He slipped a second finger and continued to pulse them. John moved his hips with Sherlock's fingers, moaning his name softly.
"Calm down," John said. He closed his laptop. "Why don't we play some games? That's what Harry and I used to do."
John headed up to his room. He changed into a clean pair of pants and took his jumper off so he was in his t-shirt before coming back down.
“I said what I meant,” Sherlock said. He let his shirt fall from his shoulders. He took a step toward John. He wrapped his arms around John’s damp body, pulling him close, pressing their chests together. He let his hands slide down John’s back to rest on his arse. He kissed John deeply. “This is what I want,” he said. “Do you?”
He led them downstairs and outside. He set the box down to open the shed. He brought the box in and sat down. “Let’s make some tea before we get to work,” he said, as he filled the tin kettle with water and set it on the hot plate.
Amanda looked at the man, and he nodded. "On speaker. If you say anything about us, I'll kill you before you’ve finished the sentence." She answered and nodded to John.
“I want you too,” Sherlock mumbled, looking down at him. “This way but other ways, too . . . I want you to come to my flat . . .” He dropped his head to John’s neck as he began to rock his hips slowly.
"Fucking hell, John," Sherlock said, trying to catch his breath. "I'm burning up now." He moved a little a way from John, reaching for the shirt to wipe his hand. He offered it to John. "It's yours -- sorry."
"Night then," Sherlock said. "If anything goes wrong . . . let me know," he added even though he wasn't quite sure what he meant by that.
Sherlock looked over at John and could see his curiosity was piqued. He liked John's face when he was curious. "I suppose I do," Sherlock said. "What do you make of that?"
Eventually he woke up. He could see that it was dark out, but wasn’t sure what time it was. Or what day it was, to be honest, as his post-case sleeps sometimes lasted ridiculously long.
Sherlock, on the other hand, was not home or comfortable or lounging. He was standing stupidly behind a group of soldiers at a recruitment fair. Though dressed in uniform, he hadn’t spoken to anyone since he’d arrived two hours ago. That wasn’t what he was here to do.
John hardly slept that night. When he got home he got on the computer to find some ideas for a quick trip. He printed a lot of different things out before he finally fell asleep. In the morning he came down to his mum making breakfast.
John nodded. "Okay,” he said. At first, he felt like pouting, but that seemed stupid. He did have friends, so he called one to come over.
Sherlock reached over and took a sip of Mrs Hudson’s wine. He didn’t really have anything else to say so decided not to risk saying something else wrong.
They lay there for a few minutes as they both caught their breaths. Then Sherlock awkwardly wiggled his arm out from between them and wiped his hand on the sheet and then wiped his sweaty face with his other hand.
John was starting to doze on the sofa when Mrs. Hudson came up. Something was off about her, but John couldn't place it. She wouldn't meet his gaze properly. "John? A client stopped by to drop off a payment."
“We’ll need to see the others as well,” Sherlock said as he pulled open the drawer and began looking at the body.
He gave her a look. “I am a human, you know?” he said. “I just had your friend over for a visit. What’s not fun about that?”
Sherlock didn’t know quite how to feel about that response -- it was in his defense, yes, but it was closing down the only communication they’d had for months. He tried to think clearly for a moment before typing.
When no comment came from his brother, Mycroft stood up. “Get dressed,” he said, motioning to a clean set of clothes he’d set on the bed. “I need to make some arrangements.” He pulled his phone from his pocket and moved to the door. “Do not leave, do not do anything stupid,” he said. “Just -- get dressed and I’ll be back momentarily.”
When he woke up, the room was dark. He got up and grabbed his laptop, bringing it to the bed. He read a message from Mycroft to find out where he was and what was next. He could do this, and it maybe it would mean he could go home. Or to what had been home.
She gave him a smile and said, "I know not even you believe that anymore, Sherlock. Let's finish our tea and then we can put up the tree."
John looked at Sherlock for a long moment before nodding. "Okay. So . . . I'll see you when you get back," he said.
“I cannot do this, John,” Sherlock said, moving toward the flat’s door. “I cannot stay here right now.”
Once the show ended, Sherlock let go of John’s hand and grabbed the remote. “Do you want to watch something else?” he asked, making a little yawn. “I think I might be done with it for the night.”
“I don’t care about rumours,” Sherlock said. “You’re the only one who cares about all that.” He looked over at the television. “We’re like them, Tom and Jerry. Are there rumours about them?”
Sherlock looked over at John’s face. He wasn’t lying -- Sherlock always knew when John was lying, and he knew John was telling the truth. “Okay, then, if you insist,” he said. “But if we’re going to keep doing this, do we have to . . . have dates and things like that? Can’t it just be how we were except this, too?”
Sherlock reached for the drawer and looked in. There was some tissues, lube, and condoms, which he’d have found quite intriguing had he discovered them last week, but today he just felt grateful. He spilled some lube into his hand, stroked John’s cock a few times, and then went back to his exploration. He leaned down and began covering John’s chest with kisses.
"I hope you don't mind me saying, but I'm not enjoying this," Sherlock said. "I like just being usual, and this is unusual."
He turned on the telly and lay on the sofa, spreading out over the whole thing with a happy sigh. He looked around the flat for a moment. Fighting a small smile and steepled his fingers over his chest like Sherlock always did. He started to smile in earnest when he heard the door push open. He jumped up and leaned against the back of the sofa as if he'd been sitting normally the whole time. Mrs. Hudson was standing there, looking at him suspiciously.
John shook his head. "I'll call my mum in a little while, but we've not exchanged gifts for a long time."
Sherlock replaced his hand with John’s. “Keep busy with this for a moment,” he said. “I’ve got something I need to do.” The lube was at the end of the bed so he awkwardly reached for it and then slicked his cock, stroking a few times until he felt like he might explode. He propped up John’s leg to give himself for room, lined up and then slowly pushed inside of him. “Fuck, you feel good,” he moaned.
“Just wanted to make sure you knew where they were going,” Sherlock’s mum told John’s, handing her a piece of paper. “My parents aren’t too far away if they run into any trouble,” she added.
“Fine,” Sherlock said, getting up. “I’ll do it myself. I’ll work on it all day and you’d better be as good an audience as I was last night.” He moved over to his desk.
He went away in his head, remembering. He remembered meeting John, the first day came to the flat, their dinners at Angelo’s, their cases. He came back from his head when there was a knock on the door. Sherlock waited for the password and then unlocked the door. A man in black leathers nodded for Sherlock to follow him. The man climbed onto a motorcycle. Sherlock strapped his bag over his shoulders and climbed onto the back of the bike.
Sherlock spent most of the night silent and still, listening. A few times he thought about getting up to read, but realised, although he was still awake, he felt all right. Eventually he found his eyes were closed and when he opened them again, it was bright in the room. He turned his head and looked at John, who was still sleeping. It was still his best friend, John Watson -- the face was a bit older, but now Sherlock knew for sure that regardless of what had happened in their lives apart, their friendship was still strong.
Sherlock typed up an email reminding him they were still available to work and clarifying that they were confined to the flat. There was no reason Lestrade should know that Sherlock hadn’t known what was happening all along. After he sent the email, he also sent a text telling Lestrade that he had just sent an email.
John touched Sherlock's cheeks, spreading them a bit before opening the lube. He poured a good amount, slowly pushing in one finger.
She sat down next to him. "I'm sorry for being grouchy -- your father is frustrating me, you know how he gets before trips." She pulled his cup from his hands and took a sip. "That's why we wanted you boys here -- we planned this trip and wanted to make sure we got to celebrate with you."
"There's no case and there's no work. It’s the perfect time. The global pandemic is out there," John said, waving his hand towards the window.
A minute later Sherlock came through the door with two glasses of water. “I’m here -- don’t nag,” he teased as he set one drink down on the table by John and then tried to balance his own as he climbed over John and his computer.
“We thought your friend might be joining us for the holiday,” his father said before coughing a little.
John pulled off his cock and kissed over Sherlock's hip. He curled his fingers a bit, spreading them to open Sherlock. "You're so sexy," he murmured.
By afternoon, he’d spent a few hours going to different shops to retrieve the ingredients he needed without rousing anyone’s suspicion. And to be doubly careful, he’d sent Lestrade a message to let him know he was going to attempt to recreate the drug. Lestrade allowed it only if Molly were present and willing to lock up whatever Sherlock created. It all seemed a bit dramatic, but Sherlock was so close now, he would not let dramatics interrupt his focus.
Sherlock pulled the blanket over them. "Maybe you could always sleep in here?" he asked tentatively.
So John hadn’t changed his mind, Sherlock thought, not entirely sure how he’d have felt if John had. He wasn’t particularly keen to help John move, but felt like it was expected that he would. If he did, though, would John start expecting him to help with everything? That felt worrying. He tried to find a middle ground.
John couldn't stop kissing him, arching his body to stay pressed to Sherlock's. His hands were tugging Sherlock's clothes. Sherlock pushed himself up and pulled his t-shirt over his head. Then he began tugging on John's, encouraging him to do the same.
John watched her disappear into his room. His breathing was shallow and fast. He didn't look at Sherlock as he went to the bathroom to find the medicine.
He looked at the results -- there's weren't very many. Most of them referred to some website about science deduction. John clicked on it and started to scroll through it. The site was very scientific. Even as a doctor John was bored to death reading it. There was a list of tobaccos ash -- over two hundred! He shook his head and clicked out of the site. That couldn't be the man he met. This man was . . . boring. He kept looking, but there wasn’t much else.
Sherlock picked up the envelope and considered whether or not he should open it before giving it to John. "We are friends," he said softly for no reason.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’ve not taken any . . . when I realised I couldn’t remember, I didn’t want to risk losing any more.”
John could tell this date wasn't going as well as the first, and he knew it was his fault. He couldn't get into the mood -- he was frustrated and angry with Sherlock. Why did he have to be so difficult? He felt his phone vibrate and for a minute tried to ignore it. But he couldn't stop thinking about that either, so he pulled it out to look.
John packed up the last of his things and took the few boxes down outside. He did a final sweep of the flat and then went back out to hail a cab. Once they loaded everything and he got inside, he took out his phone.
"Don't dodge the question -- you didn't let me," Sherlock said. "Fine. What did you think about when you were masturbating this morning?"
John sighed, then grinned and revealed three of a kind . . . and a pair. "Take it off, baby," he chuckled.
“A few years ago,” Sherlock said, shutting his door quietly. “When did you start drinking?” he asked as he sat down on the bed.
“I should’ve known you’d have some,” Sherlock said. “I could pretend that’s why I didn’t bring any -- because I’d known the doctor-to-be would have some, but that’s not why. I didn’t think I’d get burnt. Is it going to hurt?”
"No! You know what I meant," John said. He sat in his chair and huddled in the coat. "I'm going to wear it all day."
John offered to get them a taxi, which pulled away from the kerb to head to his date’s place. He got out to walk her to her door. They shared a quick kiss, and he could tell she was pausing to give him a chance to follow her out. He politely ended the evening, thinking about the case Sherlock was working on. He realised he didn’t really know where Sherlock was with it, and that was very odd. He felt left out all of a sudden, which he hadn't felt in a long time.  Instead, he asked her out for tomorrow and walked back to the cab, which drove off again towards his own flat.
“I’m just wondering why you stopped,” Sherlock said. “You used to compliment me quite often, but I feel like it’s been weeks.”
John hummed as he pulled off. "Can you reach the lube in my drawer?" he asked, taking Sherlock into his mouth again.
"I’ve got a new job and wanted to move closer  . . . Molly told me there was a room available here," he said. "I think she tricked me -- I didn't know you lived here," he clarified.
Sherlock shook his head. "That story does nothing to win me over," he said. He thought for a moment. "Are you going to want to get a Christmas tree for the flat?" he asked.
Sherlock looked down at their bodies moving against each other. "I've never touched you here," he said stupidly, looking up at John and smiling.
, John thought to himself. Of all the people to grab, he got one that tried to bribe him. He was pretty hot, though. John wouldn't have minded if he had agreed to a drink. But maybe this was for the best. He did have a job to do after all.
John realised he wanted a drink, which would allow him to listen to chatter as he made his way to the bar. He turned and bumped into someone standing too close.
Lestrade was losing his patience. “Are you bored, Sherlock? Is that it? You solved your case too quickly and John’s too slow? Don’t be childish -- it’s the same case, you just worked on separate parts. You two are partners, don’t forget.”
"Because you said you loved me," he said, moving over to sit beside him. "And because I love you, too." He reached over and stroked Sherlock’s hair.
He turned his attention back to the television. Hopefully, the awkwardness was over now, for a while at least. It was kind of nice having John to talk to and he had enjoyed what happened upstairs.
Sherlock took another sip of tea. "I have no idea," he said. "Were you going to say something about the fact I've got nothing done?"
Sherlock looked up at Harry and then over at John. "Yes," he mumbled and turned back to the kettle, pouring two cups. He handed one to John. "Am I supposed to make one for her?" he asked him.
Sherlock shifted, reaching for his trousers and pulling out his wallet. He retrieved the condom and threw it on the bed. “It’s new -- I just put it in there,” he said. “Just in case.”
“It’s good,” Sherlock mumbled. His body was sliding against the bed with each of John’s movements. He bent his knees to push his legs against the mattress so he could follow John’s rhythm. Then suddenly, he stutter, “I’m going to come.” When his orgasm hit, his body arched and his legs squeezed around John’s.
“Well, I don’t think it’s scary, but I’m the one who made it up. You’re more of a delicate nature, so if you get too frightened, just let me know,” he said, settling back. “Are you ready?”
John wrapped the towel around his waist and stepped out. "No. But I know we went through a lot and you might have meant . . . what are you doing?" he asked, noticing Sherlock's hands.
"I do like working together! But I already had these plans, Sherlock. I'm trying to make plans with you, too."
John watched Sherlock go, wondering if he was upset about something. But Sherlock was always running off like that so John put it out of his head. He tidied up his things and went upstairs to his room.
Sherlock’s research kept him very busy which was good because -- while he didn’t regret reaching out to John -- he was aware that the temptation to do it again and again was great. He’d thought about John every day he’d been gone, missing him and looking forward to seeing him again. But through all those times, he’d convinced himself that John knew what was happening and why. He’d probably been irritated with Sherlock, but ultimately he’d have understood. Now Sherlock knew things weren’t that simple.
“Fair enough,” Sherlock said. “Quick question just for clarity -- you’re saying you won’t be going on stupid dates anymore with boring strangers? You’re sure about that?”
“Here you go,” Sherlock interrupted as he returned. He carried a tray with three glasses of lemonade. He sat down at the table. “What were you talking about?” he asked.
"Text me when you're on your way," Sherlock called, hoping John heard him. He moved over to the window and watched John walk down the street. Then he turned around and looked at the flat. He had a lot to do, but first he wanted one more cup of tea.
She scowled. “Fine, I’m just trying to be nice. Perhaps you could try it?” she said, getting up. “There will be a cup of tea ready for you in five minutes. Come get it.” She left.
John was pleased when he saw the message. He’d been working on other cases, but had still wondered what had happened to the client.
“Of course, if  you could manage to be just a bit more lovely, we might just get her to tell us how they do it,” he joked as he watched John typing away furiously.
On Tuesday morning, John started early, getting his list of jobs together before leaving since he fell asleep before doing it the night before.
John listened while Greg explained what was happening and why he needed John. "I hate to ask you to do it -- I know it could be dangerous, but you can handle yourself."
Mycroft thought for a moment. “All right,” he finally said to his brother. “But I feel I should be here as well. To make sure he fully understands the situation.” He reached for his phone and sent a quick text.
Sherlock watched John come up the path to the house. He left his bedroom and headed downstairs right as John rang the bell. His mum rushed out, but he said, “I’ll get it -- it’s John.”
“I didn’t wake you because well . . . there was no reason to, obviously,” Sherlock said. “Have you been sleeping all right?”
John's heart ached, and he felt his eyes well. He looked away quickly. "This is your home. Of course you can stay," he said before he hurried out. He saw Mrs Hudson’s door open, but he rushed past and left the flat.
“I don’t think you should go,” Sherlock said. “We’re just talking . . . no need to go.” He gave John a minute to settle back. “That said . . . there is an extra bedroom in the flat. Not being used for anything . . .”
Most of John’s dates seemed bad to Sherlock, but he knew well enough to keep that to himself. “Why’s that then?” he asked.
John looked over at Mycroft, still standing having refused John’s offer of a chair. "I can give him a message, if you want."
Sherlock smiled. “Those caverns were good,” he said, remembering. “And today’s been good as well.” He splashed some water at John. “Do you think we should head back though? It’s been a while since you’ve eaten and I know how you get when you don’t get food,” he added, splashing again.
“Yes, well, it took me a little time to understand precisely what was happening,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. “Obviously you were interesting to me -- which is why I invited you to move in here, but in a relatively short time, these feelings have intensified, and I wasn’t quite sure what to do about the revelation.”
John laughed. "Fine, you get that point. But I'm getting one for this man's tiny shorts. They're right up his arse!"
“Well, I’m definitely deprived,” Sherlock said. “I thought you were working today -- what time is it?”
She looked around the room. “Is it too cold in here for you?” she asked. “I can get you another blanket.”
John's free hand slipped into his hair and tugged softly as he kissed back, his hand moving faster. "M'close . . ."
John stroked his cock a bit faster, moving his hips to get more of the vibrator. "God Sherlock..." he moaned, his head falling back on the chair.
"I am," Sherlock said, leaning forward, his voice serious again. "We do all those things already, and I . . . like them."
“I don’t know. I’m bored,” Sherlock said, though that wasn’t quite the right word. “Can’t you come up with something interesting? You’re a very interesting person. I’ve told you that before. Are you going to make me out as a liar?”
"There is no moment, John. This is our world now, don't forget," Sherlock said. "Just me and you and the flat and all this business, if you want," he added, moving his hand over their naked bodies.
"I tried to be there! He doesn't let anyone in. He didn't, anyway. Interesting that doesn't seem to apply to you . . ." She stared over at him. Then they both heard footsteps on the stairs.
He glanced over at her. “Yes, I imagine so,” he said. He closed up the cooler and thanked her once again before leaving.
Sherlock reached over and held John’s hand. “It’s good, isn’t it?” he said softly. “I prefer a world with just you and me in it.”
“Well done you,” she said, taking the flower and leaning in to give him a kiss on the cheek. “Your business is coming along nicely.”
"Slow at first . .. it all happened in your chair," John said. His hands were pushing Sherlock's clothes off, nails scraping over his shoulders and back as they kissed.
Sherlock thought for a moment -- in a way that described him exactly: there were very few people he cared about but John was one, and for John, he too was trying.
“Not men -- a man. The police asked me to locate a known drug dealer and thought he might be at that bar,” Sherlock said. “Your so-called friend isn’t a known drug dealer, is he?”
“It doesn’t bother me,” Sherlock said. “I have other things in my life besides trying to get . . . that.”
John hadn't thought of that yet and suddenly remembered the days he'd already experienced Sherlock without a case. "Well... let's hope that Greg finds us essential for cases," he said.
Sherlock knew they'd be gone for a few hours so although he had promised to tidy up, he first made himself another cup of tea and sat down on the sofa. It felt good for the flat to be so quiet. Harry's presence had not been good at all -- it had really thrown him off. At the moment, he just wanted to appreciate the silence and relief that now things would go back to normal.
"Hmm. I see. Seems like John is still learning that," John said. He sat up to take one more sip of whiskey and then lay down flat, warm and comfortable.
He glanced at Sherlock, at his lap since that's what he intended before. "I'm not really sleepy yet. Where am I sleeping?" he asked.
John leaned even closer, his eyes fixed on Sherlock's. He licked his lips lightly and felt the corner of his mouth twitch into a smile when Sherlock glanced at them. "What else?"
She smiled and rolled her eyes. “You can go any time -- you’re not being held against your will,” she said. She glanced around, looking for her new husband. “I think it should be wrapping up soon -- we’re leaving for our honeymoon tonight,” she added.
John nodded and sipped his tea, looking around Sherlock's room. It wasn't as decorated as his own, but that didn't surprise him.
"No, it’s fine," he said quickly. "It’s just . . . I've just got out of a relationship," he said. The lie came out before he could even think about what he was saying. "I thought it would be good to get out, but maybe I wasn't ready."
“And do you agree -- would moving in here with me be the best for you?” Sherlock asked. “Think carefully.”
"I'll sleep here with you." He grinned suddenly as he used his own undershirt to clean up. "Wait until Mycroft finds out what we did in his bed."
Sherlock pushed up off the bed and tried to reach the drawer. Inside was a small bag. He took a peek in and grabbed the lube, dropping it down the bed. “Those pills aren’t for an infectious disease, are they?” he asked with a smile.
“You’re the one who wants me ‘cured’ and back to normal,” Sherlock said, bringing two bowls over to the table.
Sherlock took a sip of wine. “You can tell I’m uncomfortable with all this -- do you really need me to explicit?” he asked.
“All right,” Sherlock said. “Yes, that sounds good.” He got up and put his mug in the sink and then moved into the sitting room, clicking on the television, but then decided he’d like a glass of wine instead. He returned to the kitchen as John was finishing eating. “Maybe the wine will help me sleep,” he offered as an excuse as he pulled a bottle from the cupboard.
John shook his head. "I won't kick her out. I'm sure she'll leave when she's finished doing what she needs to. I'm glad she finally in the programme and actually following it this time."
Sherlock pushed on him and then actually pushed him all the way up. “I just need to get comfortable,” he said. He dropped his book to the floor and slouched down, placing his feet on the coffee table before lifting them and sliding a pillow underneath. “There,” he said. “You can return if you want.”
Sherlock decided to ignore John’s little outburst. He went over to open the window and lit a cigarette. He looked down at the street. It was empty.
Sherlock slid his hand between their bodies and started to stroke himself. At first he tried to match John’s rhythm, but soon both of their bodies were just jerking against the bed. “I might --” he started to say as the electricity filled his body.
“I didn’t expect --” Sherlock started to say. He followed John, glancing around at the sparse decoration. “But I won’t without.” He reached out and held onto John’s waistband.
"Of course not," John said. "We're friends . . . from the start, you said you were married to your work. You know what the truth is."
“Okay,” Sherlock said. He finished his tea and peeked out of the shed, noticing his parents’ window was dark. “Are you ready?”
When he finished packing everything, he went down to let Mrs. Hudson know what was happening. Later on, he slipped the bag over his shoulder and left the flat.
“We can still speak -- you can call,” Sherlock said quickly, hearing more desperation in his voice than he’d expected. “Later, I mean. So I can let you know what the doctor says. And while I’m away, I mean.”
Sherlock felt the urge to smile, but decided to keep it to himself. What he’d been hoping, what Mrs Hudson had guessed, was true: John was interested. The clues were there. As he turned to the bartender to get the drinks, he considered whether or not he himself was interested. The answer to that was obvious. But interested in what? He wasn’t quite sure of that part yet. But he was enjoying this flirting and right now that was all that mattered. He handed one glass to John. “Drink now,” he said, taking a sip of his own. “And then we dance.”
John looked over at him. "That was different. We don't have to say anything now because we're coming back to this."
“What?” Sherlock said, instinctively reaching for his pocket. He was surprised to find he’d left it upstairs. “It could be a client,” he muttered as he went up to get it.
“It’s not like that,” Mrs Hudson said and then realised it was probably unnecessary. “Do you two know each other then?”
“Well, I haven’t finalized everything. I’ve just decided since all societal expectations have been disrupted due to the virus, I might as well as make up my own guidelines as we move forward,  ” Sherlock said. “For example, bathing . . . is it really necessary every single day?”
John rolled up some paper and lit it, pushing it in the middle of the wood tepee they had made. The leaves lit, and slowly it spread to the wood.
Sherlock moved closer. He didn’t trust the cops but more importantly he didn’t trust this woman and her drug dealing boyfriend. He didn’t trust anyone except John.
"Oh, yeah," he nodded. "Yeah, everything is good. The water took a while, like you said. But it was fine. I left my stuff by the sink, hopefully it's not in the way." He smiled at Sherlock. "I've just been organising my things. I feel comfortable here," he added.
“That’s all I wanted to know – just tell me if you’re starting to feel bad,” Sherlock said. He stood up and took their plates to the kitchen. He washed them and came back. “I suppose you’ll want to sleep in late tomorrow.”
“Don’t stop,” Sherlock said as he closed his eyes again. “You always make me feel better -- I knew I shouldn’t have gone to the hospital. I should’ve just come home with you.”
He thought about sending John a quick text to tell him -- as if this was some great revelation -- but he knew John was probably asleep by now. Because John had the surgery tomorrow and then the next day he’d be off working the drugs case. On his own. Sherlock didn’t like the thought of that one bit, but he also felt pretty sure this was something he shouldn’t tell John.
“Hypothetically living together, you mean,” Sherlock said. “I’m not quite sure of the steps, but if we were to live together, I think that would probably need to be that. I mean, I don’t doubt I was incredibly charming at Molly’s wedding, but you might not find me as charming on a regular basis. Perhaps tolerating each other should be the level of expectation we should both agree to.”
Sherlock turned as well. Molly did look quite lovely, and he really did hope that this marriage would make her happy. Everyone began clapping -- when he saw Mrs Hudson clapping as well, he joined in. Once things went back to normal, he turned to John and said, “What happens next?”
Sherlock smiled and made a little growl as he licked up John's neck. "That's sexy . . . imagining you imagining it." He nipped at John's skin and then placed his hand on John's chest, pressing lightly before slowly reaching down to palm John's cock over his pajamas.
Instead of getting tea, Sherlock picked up his bag and headed outside for another cigarette. He still wasn't sure what was happening. John's voice sounded different to him, even though his words didn't seem worrying.
Sherlock poured another cup and gave one to Harry. He sat down and took a small sip. "How are you feeling?" he asked softly, not really looking at her but into the space between them.
Sherlock smiled. “No, we’re not fighting.” He turned to John and held the phone in the air. “Can you assure him we’re not fighting?”
Unless Sherlock didn't want them to be. But that was a wild assumption to make. He paid the driver and headed up to the flat.
John raised his brows. "Well, as tempting as that sounds I have to go to work still and I can't be at home all the time," he said.
When Sherlock let them into the flat, he said, "If you want to have a nap, I've changed your sheets . . . I hope you don't mind I was in your room. I didn't do anything else."
She stepped up and the older man behind the counter greeted her with recognition. He slid her a pack of twenty cigarettes and then asked, “Lottery? Feeling lucky today?”
"Well, I played a lot of rugby. It was my main extra curricular," he said. "I didn't like much else. I didn't make many friends who weren't on the team," he admitted.
"You're welcome," Sherlock mumbled. He turned his body to face John's, reaching out to hold his hand properly. "Do you see what I'm trying to say . . . how you mean so much to me? How I care about your feelings? Those things are true, John, and they really never have been before. That's why . . . we're different. You've changed my life."
“Just come for breakfast first so we can sort out the details,” Sherlock said. It was strange being back in the house but not really being under his parents’ control anymore. He knew he didn’t really have to ask permission, but John’s surprise visit had thrown him and he’d need to think about things clearly. “That work?”
John nodded as he watched the telly. He had an urge to reach over and pat Sherlock's hand or leg, just to reassure him, but John didn't know for what. He squeezed his hand shut and kept it to himself as they watched.
John glanced up at Sherlock and raised his brows. Still holding his gaze, John started clacking the keys loudly. Sherlock was frustrated from the lack of a case, but John was not going to be the sounding board for that frustration. At the very least he would retaliate -- that would make things interesting for a bit.
"Good," Sherlock said, grabbing his shirt. "It seemed quite cruel of you to want me nude, what with today being the coldest on record or whatever you were saying earlier." He slipped his shirt back on. "What's the next game?"
“Are you sure?” Sherlock said. “Because I can’t lose you, John. I don’t want to be without you.” He reached around himself to find John’s hand.
Sherlock dropped down onto John and then shifted, getting rid of the condom, and dropping down next to him. “That was good,” he said softly, rubbing his hand over his face and through his hair.
John watched Sherlock as Mycroft left the flat. "Well, you got him to leave at least," he said, smiling.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he finished the washing. He put the dishes John had dried away. “Let’s go upstairs?” he asked. “Do you want to take up something to drink?”
“I know,” she said. “But you’ll have to wait a little longer.” She grabbed his mug from the floor and moved into the kitchen, rinsing it after turning on the kettle. “You need some sleep -- your room’s clean, the sheets are on the bed.”
“I’m glad I was right,” Sherlock said. “That means I can assume that everything else I’ve deduced about you is true as well,” he added with another cheeky smile. He was surprised how comfortable he felt. Had he finished his drink too quickly?
“That, or the sleeping pills I put in the soup last night,” Sherlock said, getting up and moving over to the table. He sat down next to John, giving him a cheeky grin.
After leaving Lestrade, John headed to the bookshop. He took his usual seat, unsure if she was here or not.
“All right,” she said. She leaned in and gave him a quick kiss before standing up. “I’m very glad you’re back, Sherlock.”
“I’m not looking for a flatmate -- I’m sorry you were misled,” Sherlock said, taking a sip of tea. “Wouldn’t that have been a bit awkward anyway? What with . . . the way we met?”
Sherlock stopped. “So I’m the bad flat mate? Is that what you tell people?” he asked. He gave John his pouting face and then stopped, remembering that John had once said it would never work on him.
John grunted softly and he pushed himself back on the bed and put Greg on speaker. "Here, we’re on speaker," he said, holding the phone between them.
Sherlock pulled a face. “Perhaps I am naive, but surely the fact that we are on a date illustrates that you are single,” he said. “Or maybe you see things differently.”
Sherlock found two glasses and poured a little into each. He set them on the table and then sat down. The chair hurt his back and legs. “Can we eat in the other room?” he asked, quickly standing up.
"You look short," Sherlock said. "You'll be the one paying if I need to get the bottom of that mended."
“You’re hurt -- you’ve hurt yourself,” Mycroft said. “And I know you can’t be trusted to let yourself heal. However, you can’t stay here indefinitely. So I’m afraid I’m going to have to send you away for a bit.”
“You looked more handsome than usual . . . I think because I missed you. . .” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes as he remembered. “Then you helped me . . . you always help me and that’s why I need you around me all the time.”
John moved and took Sherlock's pajamas off completely, licking his lips. He started stroking Sherlock slowly. "My mouth,” he murmured, close enough for just his warm breath to hit Sherlock’s cock.
John's breath hitched with Sherlock's hand directly on his cock. "Yes," he nodded, lifting his head to look. "I can't reach you very well," he said, curling downwards a bit. He already felt Sherlock against his leg, and it was fueling the heat spreading through his body.
"Yes fine, it's a deal," he said. "I'll start thinking. But you can't complain about the ideas. Or be rude about it!"
Finally, John gave up waiting for Sherlock. He focused on his studies, his sports, and his new friends. It was hard not to think about Sherlock at first -- whenever something good happened that was the first person he wanted to tell. But he wasn’t writing letters anymore. After his first date and his first girlfriend, he talked to the boys on his rugby team, the same way they talked to him and to each other. Slowly they became John’s go-to for advice.
John glanced over and blinked. "You," he said, only looking away when the bartender brought his drink. "I'm not, no. Are you?”
“What?” Sherlock asked, as he was pouring the tea. He hoped John didn’t mention the smell of cigarettes -- he knew John didn’t like them, but Sherlock was a grown man after all.
“You feel . . . good,” Sherlock said, his mind focusing on the pleasure rather than his vocabulary. His hand sped up to match John’s speed. “It’s . . .” he started but couldn’t continue as the words were replaced with small grunts.
Sherlock called out John's name with pleasure. He reached down to squeeze John's shoulder. "Good," he mumbled, scarcely able to complete a word, let alone a full sentence.
John took them off the dance floor and towards the door. He wondered if people were watching them, if they suspected what they were doing. "It’s on the fourth floor," he said.
They were supposed to unbury the box together, they were supposed to still be friends like they had been. John had promised nothing would change, had assured Sherlock they wouldn't drift apart. Sherlock hadn’t agreed with his optimism. It turned out Sherlock had been right. It made John feel sad on his first day of freedom, but it all seemed so long ago. He wondered if the box was still there.
"It hasn't been terrible," he said. He almost admitted it was more his racing thoughts than the sofa itself that had troubled his sleep, but he stopped himself. "But it'll be nice to spread out on the bed again."
John picked the numbers at random, waiting for someone to answer. Nothing. "Why are people so boring? And why aren’t they answering? What else are they doing?"
John pulled the covers back and climbed in. "I think we've been apart long enough," he said quietly.
"Yes, I'm okay," Sherlock said. He slid down again to go back to their original position. "Let's watch the film."
"No," he said. "About the flat, I mean. I was just . . . browsing." He found he was nervous to reveal anything about the case. That was what Sherlock did. Besides, everyone would think he was pathetic for trying to solve something. But he wasn’t really going to try, not properly. It was just one thing, one case for an acquaintance.
Sherlock exhaled and then stood up. "It's time for you to go upstairs," he said, moving toward them. "I think you've talked enough tonight. You need sleep."
John turned his head to find Sherlock's mouth, kissing him hard. Sherlock lifted his free hand to get lost in John's hair, pulling him closer to deepen the kiss. His other hand went to the bottom of John’s t-shirt. John helped get his shirt off, rolling his hips against Sherlock. "I've been thinking about this since we kissed the first time," he said.
John lifted as he moved up to three fingers. He watched Sherlock, flushed and squirming on the bed. When they moved easier, he took his hand away and put on the condom. He added a bit more lube, leaned over him, and kissed him hard as he pushed in slowly.
Sherlock took a few more bites and then set his aside. “I know a few places we could go in Greece,” he said, almost wistfully. “It’d be a nice holiday.”
John shrugged. "That doesn’t matter,” he said. “Maybe we could go somewhere for a couple days. Just do something normal.”
John shifted, his hand moving down to keep stroking Sherlock lightly. "I think I want to . . . do you?"
John cleaned the wine glasses and put what they didn't finish in the fridge. He made his way back into the sitting room and sat on the other side of the sofa.
“Well, in addition to being a nag, you’re my blogger, my flatmate, my doctor, my cook, my conscience, and my friend.”
Sherlock looked over, surprised. “Yes, that’s right,” he said. “I didn’t think you were paying attention, but I see you were.”
Sherlock smiled back. “I’m extremely sleepy,” he said. “But we need to clean up.” He leaned over and grabbed his shirt from the floor. “You can sleep in my bed or in this one with me if you’d like.”
Sherlock moaned at John's movement. The stretch was intense, and John's weight felt heavier than he’d expected. "Keep moving," he mumbled. "Slowly." He buried his face in John's neck and concentrated on his breathing. John did, finding Sherlock's mouth again to kiss him as they moved together.
“Do you remember last month when you insisted on telling me every detail of a dream you had about living in a zoo? I don’t remember you being worried that I’d think you really wished you were a panda,” Sherlock said. “Of course, that said, your protest has actually made me question if you are actually thinking of ‘jumping’ me all the time. Which is fine, I guess – just make sure to be focused when we’re working on cases, please.”
“No, I don’t think so,” Sherlock said, thinking. Did John say he was going somewhere? “I think he’ll be at the flat.”
“I think so,” Sherlock said. He realised his body was now moving, pushing back slowly with John’s rhythm, mirroring his hand moving on his cock. “Yes,” he said softly. “It feels good.”
John rolled his eyes. "Okay. Well, I'm going to go to bed, then,” he said as he put his cup in the sink. “I have some reading to do before I sleep.”
When Sherlock woke up, he was confused for a moment. It had got dark and he didn’t recognise the room. But then he remembered. He got up, went to the toilet, closed all the curtains and made a cup of tea, going outside for a cigarette while he waited for the kettle to boil. Once his tea was made, he carried it to the sofa and got out his phone.
They walked to the shop together and chatted -- John trying to get her to recommend books. She seemed to be smiling for most of the conversation. John didn't ask about a boyfriend, but he noticed she didn't mention one either. They parted ways when she went in a back door, but John felt good about their talk.
When Sherlock opened his eyes again, everything was dark and the flat was silent. He looked at the clock and it was after midnight. What was the point of getting up now? There was nothing to do and in truth he just didn’t want to deal with John and the stupid arguments they’d had all day. He couldn’t even remember how the whole thing had started. And while he was pretty sure he’d been right about whatever the problem was, he also knew that the shouting he’d done probably hadn’t been necessary.
“I haven’t had a sleepover since that last night. I guess we’re going to make up for it with this trip,” Sherlock said with a smile. “Do you still fart all night?”
John put his hand out but after a second of Sherlock just watching him, he grabbed his hand and shook it. Mrs. Hudson stood up and hugged him.
John smiled as he listened. He really had no idea what Sherlock was talking about, but he enjoyed how thrilled Sherlock got.
“Oh my god, John,” Sherlock said. “I think she’s right – I don’t think we are interesting anymore. We’re just . . . stupid now.” He picked up John’s whiskey glass and took a sip, leaning back against John’s shoulder.
The images flashed in John's mind - Sherlock's hands on his hips, his tongue pushing into John's mouth, his body arching into John. He shook his head. "It would never accidentally happen, so you don't have to worry about that."
Sherlock had fallen asleep reading. When he woke the book was on his chest, but he couldn’t recall a single thing he’d read. Then he heard John moving around in the flat. He decided he’d just stay hidden in his room until John went silent. Then he heard thumping, and his already angry curiosity got the best of him.
John smiled back and stuffed his hands into his pockets, walking with Sherlock inside and straight to Greg's office.
Lestrade recognised that voice. “What’s going on?” he asked, waving his hand to get the attention of one of his men.
Sherlock slipped into John's jeans which were a bit loose and too short, but the shirt and jumper were fine. "Ah, yes, much better," he said. "I may look foolish but I'm already warmed up." He had some tea and felt quite pleased with himself. "I'd like a truth, please."
John watched him moving lower, his belly twitching at the soft kisses. And then Sherlock's mouth was on him and he groaned softly. "Sherlock . . . oh God . . ."
“Show me,” Sherlock said, pulling on the zip. He helped John get his jeans and pants off. Sherlock’s hand immediately went to John’s cock, holding it softly as he nuzzled one of John’s thighs.
"Thank you," Sherlock said. "I greatly appreciate it." He tipped the rest of his wine into his mouth. "Fine, remind me -- if I choose truth, you ask a question I have to be honest about and if I choose dare, you get me to do something stupid, correct?"
Sherlock stood up and put his plate in the sink. He got the pint of ice cream out of the freezer and sat it in front of John. He grabbed a biscuit and nibbled at it.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said. “If I’m your boyfriend, I have to.” He snuggled in. “I don’t want to ever miss you like I did before. I know that part of that was my own fault. I won’t let you go so easily this time. I missed so much because I was stupid.”
“I want to tell you something,” he said. “I just wanted you to know that it’s okay to get a new best friend.”
The water was quite cold at first since their skin was hot after their walk. Sherlock walked in slowly, the water almost burning his skin. Eventually he bent down and went under the water.
Sherlock took a long breath. That was exactly what he wanted -- to be able to look at John, to know it was him, to know it was something they were sharing. He sat up and scrambled around for the lube bottle and condom box before handing them to John.
John moved away long enough to lock their door--he didn't need Mrs. Hudson coming up unannounced like she had been. He came back to the sofa and pushed off his own jeans, followed by his shirt, before he lay beside Sherlock. He felt his cheeks flush now that they had a moment to pause and really think about what they were doing. His eyes moved over Sherlock's face but he didn't want to think about it too much. He just wanted more. He leaned and kissed Sherlock's mouth.
The film immediately bored Sherlock, but he realised this was the most comfortable he’d felt in the last day or two. He got up after a while and put his wine glass in the sink, making some tea instead. “I’ll do the washing up in the morning,” he said when he returned.
Sherlock watched John's face and saw that he was deliberately . . . being naughty. For a second, Sherlock almost smiled -- he liked when John was cheeky, though generally he preferred when he did it to someone else. Still, it did kind of annoy Sherlock that John had taken his coat, so he was fine continuing the game. "Take it off, John," he said. "You meddled with my things, something we promised not to do."
Harry grinned. "I'm not telling, Sherlock. You'll tell him the truth about me, and I don't need that trouble."
Sherlock looked closely to read John's face. "All right," he said. "I'll be here." He glanced around. "I can tidy up a little so you can relax when you get back."
“Maybe dating is just boring,” Sherlock suggested. “Maybe you keep blaming it on the girl you’ve chosen, but did you ever stop to think that maybe dating itself is just boring?”
John smiled. "I don't think you win over redheads by grabbing a tall brunette and pretending he's your boyfriend," he said.
Sherlock watched him walk off. He looked up and noticed that somehow another band had started playing -- he hadn’t even noticed a change in the music. He looked round but the man who’d grabbed him was gone. So was the tall, ginger man. He looked up to the front -- so was the girlfriend. Sherlock turned and left.
"He's all right," Sherlock replied as he stretched a bit. "Look, I might actually go into my room -- there's a couple things I wanted to read before tomorrow anyway, so I can do that in there so you can get some sleep."
“No,” Sherlock said, pulling John close to him. “We’re going to dance.” He slid one arm behind John’s back. He started to move, swaying their bodies.
"Okay, I'm going to ignore by the fact that you were watching me sleep before and focus on the part I agree with -- what we did before was interesting. And fun."
“I guess,” Sherlock said. He wasn’t really hungry, but eating was something to do, something to focus on. He moved over to the sofa. “Should I find us something to watch while we eat?”
Sherlock smiled to himself and then closed his eyes, thinking for a few minutes. “Did you understand what I was trying to tell you?” he whispered.
"Why? Your personal choice is yours. We're allowed to want different things. I just want to find someone I enjoy spending time with," John explained.
“I know it’s not exactly the same and all, but I’m glad I still like you,” Sherlock said. “So . . . what do you fancy doing now?”
Sherlock looked over at John, who looked quite sweet. He brought two cups of tea in and squeezed himself into his end of the sofa and whistled softly.
But there was something else about her presence here -- it made him worry a bit. Maybe because it was a reminder . . . He turned off the lamp and rolled over, trying not to think so he could sleep.
"Actually that's nice," Sherlock said, leaning back and closing his eyes. "I reserve the right to request this again in the future."
John worked into his lunch and took his break a bit later than usual. When he realized what area he was in he made an impulse decision and drove to Baker Street, knocking loudly.
"Don't do your weird deduction thing on me, Sherlock. I didn't run away. They discharged me. I'm better," she insisted.
Sherlock moved over to John. "What am I supposed to do while she's here?" he asked quietly. "How am I supposed to be?"
"I do," John murmured, kissing him again before moving further into the flat toward his bedroom. He moved slowly, making sure Sherlock wanted to go.
John stroked him, looking down to watch the movement. He licked his lips and looked up. "Can I taste you?"
“What’s that supposed to be mean?” Sherlock said, setting his mug down and turning on the sofa to look at John.
They started walking through the woods, the sun occasionally hitting them through the trees. It was going to be a hot day. When they got to the lake, the water looked clean, with a nice blue-green colour. They took off their shoes, and Sherlock pushed the key into one of his. He peeled off his shirt and set it and John’s on top of his shoes.
"Come on then," Sherlock said, pulling on John's arm. When they got into the bedroom, he pushed John onto the bed and then slid next to him. "Just let me by you," he said snuggling up.
Sherlock propped himself up and, watching John watch him, slowly popped open the buttons of his trousers, pushing them down a bit, before pulling out his cock. He closed his eyes as he stroked it a few times and then went back to work on John, pushing a finger inside him.
Sherlock sat back in his chair and thought for a moment. The room seemed incredibly silent for a moment. "Is it true?" he asked slowly.
John turned on the light and waved his hand to show off the whole room, smiling at Sherlock, waiting to read his feelings about where this might go.
John shook his head but laughed as well. "Look, lay down here," he said, patting his thigh. "I want to try something."
John lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes, his stomach turning in knots. Obviously, he'd had feelings for Sherlock, but those were passing thoughts he never thought he would get to entertain. Maybe it was the drama around Harry. Maybe when she left things would go back to normal. Did Sherlock really feel the same about him? He couldn't imagine it, as much as he wanted it.
"I have them," John said, pressing closer. He wanted to rub against Sherlock's thigh -- he needed something -- but Sherlock's hands were taking his clothes off so he grabbed at the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt.
"Kissing," John nodded. "Good idea." He closed the space between them and kissed Sherlock's mouth lightly.
Sherlock stayed up much later than he’d intended to, which helped distract him from thinking and ensured that by the time he’d finished, he was ready to crash. He tried to tidy up his mess, but left most of it, setting his alarm so he’d be sure to have time to finish before John got back from class. He climbed into bed with his laptop for a few hours before he eventually fell asleep.
When he got out, he wrapped a towel around him. In his bedroom, he stared at his wardrobe and decided to get a little more dressed up today. It was stupid, he knew, but again, why not? He pulled out his purple shirt which John had once complimented him on. It felt a little tighter than usual, and he wondered why. He fiddled with his hair in the mirror and then emerged. “Your turn,” he said to John. “And remember, just because we’re not going out, doesn’t mean you should skip deodorant.”
He decided to have a cup of tea before getting back to work because, in all honesty, he didn’t really know what to do next. He had no real contacts abroad to check on the man. His brother did, though, and the fact that Mycroft hadn’t offered them meant that his brother truly believed there was nothing there, and Sherlock knew that in circumstances like this he could trust his brother’s position. Perhaps he should just give up.
"I'm going to explode," Sherlock exhaled into John's ear. His body moved on its own now, rocking the bed as he could feel the coil tighten in his core.  "God . . ." he moaned as his orgasm hit.
"All right," Sherlock said, standing up. "I'll go to my room now, but if you need anything or if anything happens . . . come get me."
Sherlock nodded a little. “But the other kids . . . I won’t have you there to help when I act the wrong way,” he said.
Sherlock was in his bedroom when he heard John come in. He wasn’t sure what he’d gone in there for or when, but he sat up from the bed and rubbed his face before coming out to the kitchen. “You’re back,” he said for no reason whatsoever.
“I knew you would be,” Sherlock said with a smile. “You were way better than Thomas -- I would’ve loved to have seen his face when you were chosen. Did your team win a lot or whatever?”
“Behind the lilac underneath my window,” Sherlock said. “It should stay protected, but there’s no way anyone would ever move that bush so it won’t get accidentally dug up.”
"Oh. Yeah, I just thought in the flat . . . sorry," John said, looking out of his window. He felt embarrassed.
Sherlock smiled. "If you insist," he said, sitting up. He started explaining what he'd been investigating. "If I can prove it, you can see how useful it'd be."
“To be a ghost he’d have to have died. It may surprise you to find out that I -- a detective -- had already considered that option. No obituary, no record of death,” Sherlock said. He took a sip of tea. “Maybe all this is stupid, John . . . maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m just desperate . . .”
John nodded. "That's true. I really don't think either of us have it -- we probably would have started showing symptoms. But now everything is out, I can monitor your temperature as well if you want, and I think everything will be just fine," he said.
When John arrived, he knocked loudly. A few seconds later the door opened and Mrs. Hudson was standing there.
“Shut up,” Sherlock said. “You never thought so before.” He pushed John down against the bed and leaned over his chest, kissing him roughly again. He let his hand roam up John’s arm over his shoulder and round to his upper back, pulling them even tighter together. He could feel John’s hot skin against his own and John’s cock pressing against his leg. These were good feelings – different, unexpected – but definitely good. “Let’s get under the covers,” he said quickly, slipping to John’s side and trying to get the blankets over them.
“Good thing that's the only thing," John said, wrapping his fingers around Sherlock's cock and stroking steadily, slow and deliberate.
"I'm sorry, I appreciate your help but I don't appreciate you trying to hassle me about it. I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm just going to get back to work."
John took the toast and smiled at Sherlock. "Thanks," he said, setting it down in front of him and digging in. “There’s nothing else to do, I might as well try to make up for all the sleep I’ve lost in my life.”
John woke up with his alarm and got into the shower. He dressed himself in a nice suit with his favourite tie before coming back down to the kitchen to get some tea. "Good morning," he called to Sherlock.
She gave him a disbelieving look before leaving, shutting the door behind her. John sighed loudly and rolled his eyes, leaning back again and flipping through channels for something to pass the time with.
"John Watson," Sherlock sang. "Where are you?" He looked around and saw a lump under his covers. He smiled stupidly. "Are you in the wardrobe? In my drawers? On the ceiling?" He moved over to the bed. "I guess he gave up. I might as well go to bed." He slid under the covers, pulling them over his head. "John? Is that you?" he asked.
Finally, Sherlock reached down and grabbed John’s arm. “You’re going to have to stop,” he said. “I can’t take anymore . . .”
Sherlock exhaled loudly and then opened his eyes to look into John’s. “I’m going to come soon, okay?” he said before squeezing his eyes shut again.
“I can pretend,” Sherlock said. “But I agree that the food tastes excellent. I’m not saying your cooking’s been bad, it’s just . . . this tastes very good.”
"Good night, John," Sherlock said. He stayed on the sofa for a while. listening to John climb the stairs. Then he got up and got ready for bed, going into his room and shutting the door. It seemed so quiet and empty. When he turned out the lamp, it seemed ever more so. He didn't like this one bit. He got back up and went to John's door, knocking softly.
“I’m not a child -- stop talking to me like one,” Sherlock said angrily. He lifted his hand to his head and rubbed it lightly. “Since the minute I got here, everyone’s been treating me like a child, and I’m sick of it.”
“You came to see me on your lunch break?” Sherlock said, moving to the kitchen. He set the clipboard on the table and poured two cups of tea. “That was very kind of you.”
Mycroft waved his hand. “This is not my doing, Sherlock -- it’s the hospital’s recommendation,” he said. “I’m sure once Dr Watson sees the situation, he will agree with their findings.”
Sherlock was staring at the clock. John hadn’t said what time this was all happening, and he couldn’t remember any details about the woman’s work schedule. Had John told him those and he’d been too distracted by these strange emotions to remember? He picked up his phone, wishing he could text but not wanting to risk anything. He didn’t even feel like he could call Lestrade again. His stomach felt sick. From now on, they should always work on cases together. In fact, in the future, they should always be together all the time so that Sherlock never had to experience this feeling again.
“When do you want to do it?” Sherlock said. “Perhaps soon, before either of us comes to our senses.”
“Okay, look,” Sherlock said quickly. “I’ve been thinking about it. I might have even done a little research,” he added. “But only because I know you’ve watched porn so you have a bit of a head start on me.” He slid down the bed a little and turned on his side. “We should start with kissing,” he said.
"No, I'm not saying I have it. I don't have any symptoms ,and I'm sure you don't have it either. Obviously if you want to stay with Mrs Hudson until I'm clear . . . I just want you to be informed. I'll be checking my symptoms and being careful."
John pushed him lightly. "Just as bossy as ever," he teased, making his way into the kitchen to start the kettle. Then he took a quick shower and put on shorts and a t-shirt. He flopped onto the sofa and slouched a bit to get comfortable as he sipped his tea and looked around. The swimming had been fun. Things were starting to feel less awkward and much more like they used to be. He was happy, smiling to himself on the sofa.
“But if you do . . . I should call Sarah and ask her?” Sherlock asked. He focused on the television. “You always take care of things around here. I just want to know – just in case.”
Sherlock began to list the things he could think he might need. In truth, his head was still a little fuzzy, and his body did hurt. After a few minutes, he said, “And whatever else you think I might need.” He took a sip of water and then added, “I trust when you enter my room you’ll use discretion. I will not need anything from my desk drawers, so obviously there will be no reason for you to look in there.”
“Right but there’s still a lot going on in here,” Sherlock said, tapping the side of his head. “I’ll try, though.”
Sherlock took the plates to the sink and then went and changed into his own pajamas. He poured a glass of whiskey and headed up to John’s bedroom. “I brought whiskey, just in case one of us needs it,” he said. “Can I sit down on your bed?”
Sherlock lifted his finger to his lips and then his hand dropped to his leg. He didn’t want to talk about it. He concentrated on the end of the film. John swallowed and turned back to the film. There wasn't much left. When it was over, he shut the computer.
"Blizzard's a bit of an exaggeration, John," Sherlock said, moving over to the sofa. "Have you ever been to the Arctic? The Arctic gets blizzards; England does not."
“No,” Sherlock said. “I just got worried.” He put a kiss on John’s mouth and then smiled widely. “I definitely don’t want to stop,” he said. He pushed John to the side and then moved to straddle him, pulling the covers up over his back. He looked down at John and then reached to stroke his cock again. “Is this how you like it? Tell me if you want to do it differently,” he said, looking down at John.
Sherlock stepped over and took the skull from her hands. "I understand John has given you permission to stay here, but you gained his approval, not mine," he said. "This is mine. You don't need to touch anything that is mine. If you're not sure if it's mine, you should ask John. The sofa is John's. Perhaps you're better off moving over there." He put the skull back on the mantel and picked up his tea. He moved to his desk, opened his laptop and tried to pretend she wasn't here even though he knew that was literally impossible to do.
"Good to see some loyalty -- it's the most redeeming quality in siblings," Sherlock said. "Nonetheless -- not interested. If there's something John would like me to know, I'm sure he'll tell me."
"Possibly -- it makes it easier to talk," Sherlock said. "I'm not good at talking about things like this, as I'm sure you've noticed."
Sherlock's lips curled into a smile, and he leaned forward and kissed John again, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth before moving the kiss to John's ear. John moaned, twisting his hand a bit. It'd been a long time for Sherlock and this simple move was a move too far.
His mum touched his shoulder and sighed softly. "I just came to tell you that I'm going out with some friends for dinner, so I gave your sister money to order pizza. Why don’t you invite a friend over?”
John took a hot shower and ordered delivery for dinner, flipping on the news while he ate. He picked up his phone again and opened the messages with Sherlock.
John smiled. "The crowd seems to like it, they are paying attention, enjoying it," he said. He tapped his glass to Sherlock's and took a drink.
"She said it's a step, making amends," he said. He glanced up again. "I know this isn't ideal, I tried to stop her, but if I just let her do her thing, it'll be over faster."
“Don’t be long,” she called, and he moved himself to the side of the building, lighting another cigarette as he leaned against the brick.
Sherlock had spent part of his time along thinking about this and trying to memorise what he wanted to say. He took a deep breath and started. "Obviously I have feelings of love for you. I was not expecting to but it's happened. I know you are uncomfortable when people say things about us, so I understand if you'd like me to keep them to myself. Perhaps I should have said something sooner, but I suppose I hadn't put words to those feelings as you know feelings are complicated for me. However, now I have and . . . those are my feelings."
“I know you do -- you’ve got an excellent memory,” Sherlock said, taking the glass and putting it on the table. “I’m very eager to hear what you’ve found out, but I’m more eager to show you something in the other room.” He stood up and tugged on John’s hand.
“No, I’m afraid I don’t have a fax or email,” Sherlock lied. “Can you put it in the post . . . or perhaps you could stop by when you’re around Baker Street again?”
“All right, I just don’t want to lose my blogger,” Sherlock said. “Or your half of the rent,” he added with a laugh.
Sherlock glanced over, noticing that the man’s pupils were slightly dilated. Interesting. “Not serious. I’m not a very serious man,” Sherlock said. “And your date -- not a drinker?” he added, nodding to the man’s one glass.
"Everything is fine. I'm making something to eat," John said. He still hadn't stopped thinking about that dream, but he tried not to if he was anywhere in Sherlock's line of vision.
“Maybe that should be your goal then -– stop focusing on the sex stuff,” Sherlock said. “If it’s so important to meet someone new, just try to find someone you like rather than try to find someone you want to have sex with. I’m sure you get enough sexual satisfaction on your own for now.”
Sherlock put his phone in his pocket and pulled out a cigarette instead. If John was going to ruin his afternoon like this, he was going to pay him back by coming home stinking of tobacco. Once he’d finished it, he threw the butt on the street before unlocking the flat door and heading up to the flat, pushing open the door and bracing himself.
“Having your eyes there would’ve really helped,” Sherlock admitted, taking a quick bite of salad. “It’s just . . . forget it.” He took a gulp of wine.
John felt Sherlock's body squeezing around him, and he let go. He came, groaning Sherlock's name as his body arched in pleasure.
When their meals arrived they got quiet again, except for Harry complimenting the food. When they were finished Harry leaned back. "Are we sharing the bed like when we were kids?" she asked.
"Just having a cup of tea," Sherlock said. For some reason, he wasn't quite sure he should come home just yet. Was something going on with John?
“All right. Just -- don’t be long,” Sherlock said. He grabbed some clean clothes from his room and then moved into the bathroom to shower.
John nodded. "It feels good," he said. He rolled his hips, sliding his hand down to stroke Sherlock's cock slowly.
“I’d like to know if you’d be expecting it,” Sherlock said. “I might be interested . . . but an interest is not the same as an expectation.”
“Excellent,” Sherlock said. “That’s what I love about you, John Watson – I really did not think that was what you were going to say. All right. I’m coming with you, right? That sounds fine with me.”
"Because you're still handsome," he said. "And more interesting and mysterious than I thought. I want to know more."
Sherlock slipped his arms around John’s lower back, pulling him closer as he melted into the kiss. John brought his hand up into Sherlock's hair, and Sherlock made a soft moan and then began to pull John toward the bedroom. When they got into the room, he turned and leaned back, pulling them both onto the bed. John tangled their legs in his attempt to get closer, licking into his mouth to deepen the kiss.
Sherlock rolled back over and stretched in the bed. He reached for his phone and saw John’s text. He was glad John wasn’t angry anymore. He hit reply and thought for a moment.
John turned and saw Harry sprawled out looking at him. "Yes. You can call if you need anything. Just try to stay out of Sherlock's way, yeah?"
"Yes," Sherlock said quickly, standing up. "Harry was just telling me she's decided to go into rehab."
Sherlock looked skeptical. "I was hoping for something more exciting," he mumbled. "Your turn. I'll take truth."
Sherlock smiled. “That’s all I want right now . . . to make you feel good,” he said. He kept stroking and watching, having to shift his free hand to his own trousers momentarily, just to shift his own hard cock. He changed positions, leaning down a little as he began to explore between John’s legs again, his fingertips brushing his hole. Although he was aching himself, he wanted this to go slow, making up for the days and nights they’d spent apart.
John took his stuff. "Um..." He stepped forward and hugged Sherlock a bit awkwardly. "I'm glad you caught me. See you tomorrow," he said, turning to leave quickly.
“No, not go out dinner,” Sherlock said. “I meant -- why? Do you want to go out? We could go out I guess.”
“What? Arresting old ladies for buying non-essential sherry?” Sherlock said. “We just need something.”
“All right,” Sherlock said. His hands wandered to John’s waist, slipping open the button on his jeans.
“Fine,” Mycroft said. “Dr Watson, I’ll be in touch -- when Sherlock’s able to function clearly without making stupid decisions that lead to injury, I will bring him back to the flat.”
And then somehow, he found himself on the street, alone, heading to the bar he’d visited last night. Maybe he was double-checking for the dealer. Maybe he just wanted some air. In truth, he tried not to think about anything about why he was doing this.
Sherlock lifted his head and moved down to nip at his thighs. “You taste good,” he mumbled. “What do you want now?”
He hadn’t been sure about the gift for John -- in truth, he hadn’t been sure if he should even buy a gift at all, but he was very pleased to see that John had liked it.
Sherlock scooped a bit onto a plate and took it over to his desk. He read over his email and typed up all his notes and sent them to Lestrade.
“We could go out to the shed and I could show you the experiment I’ve been working on,” Sherlock suggested. “Or we could go on a walk.”
“I’m going to pretend that this is how it’s going to be forever. I know it won’t be, but right now, I’m going to imagine it’ll just be us here forever,” Sherlock said, closing his eyes and imagining them. In his mind, he was really just seeing their life in lockdown and, while it hadn’t all gone smoothly, it seemed strangely perfect at the moment. “Are you imagining it, too?” he asked John, without opening his eyes.
Sherlock tried to collect himself, pulling out and getting rid of the condom. He took a long deep breath, looked over at John, and then curled around his body and squeezed him. He reached for John's hand and held it on John's chest. "Is this how you want us to be now?" he asked softly.
John woke up the next morning and looked to where Sherlock had been sitting the night before. He wasn’t sure that was all about. He stretched and got up, making his way downstairs. He wondered if Sherlock had got any sleep the night before after their talk.
John used soft gauze and covered the marks. "Don't sleep on your back, okay?" He wiped his hands and packed everything away. He lay back down.
At the morgue Sherlock was taking down meticulous notes since Molly had banned him from taking the photos he wanted. He’d seen things he hadn’t expected to see and had been overly excited by that. He loved a challenge. He worked for a while in the library and then walked around thinking. He realised he was craving a cigarette so he stopped into the news agents. Somehow it felt like he’d earned a treat.
Sherlock moved to the window to see if they really were leaving. He watched them get into a taxi and drive away. Annoying.
“Clothes,” Sherlock said as he moved to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. “I’m glad you’re home. What do you want to do tonight?”
“Sorry,” Sherlock said. “Lie still.” He moved his hand down and held John’s hand that was holding the remote.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “What about this trip? It was his idea . . . should I go?” he asked. “He didn’t choose a place or anything yet.”
John stared at him. He didn't know what to say. He couldn't process this. He closed the space between them and hugged Sherlock, burying his face in his shoulder.
Sherlock pushed himself up off of John. He used one hand to stroke himself and the other on John as he gazed down. “You’re sexy,” he mumbled and then reached for the condom. He slid it on and then spread more lube over John. He leaned over, resting on one arm, as he lined himself up and slowly began to push inside.
Sherlock smiled to himself. John always was kind. At first Sherlock had found it annoying, but it had grown on him a little.
John paused and turned back to Sherlock. He watched Sherlock shifting on the sofa and felt a pang of . . . something. Sherlock had been acting odd lately, and his outburst before was still nagging at John. He moved back to the sofa and sat with him. "Let's see what's on," he said, flipping through the channels.
Sherlock stood beside John as he spoke. He did not notice Lestrade’s strange looks. He was just listening to John’s voice which was making him feel so much better.
Sherlock dialed another number but no one picked up. He tried three more, but they too went unanswered. “You try,” Sherlock said.
"I figured I'd let her fiancé handle that part," John said. "How do you know her? Or do you know the groom?"
“Do you think this is stupid? Say if you do,” Sherlock said, glancing over again to make sure his mum wasn’t listening. “I know sometimes I come up with ideas you hate.”
Sherlock realised what John was doing. He took a deep breath and tried to go into his mind. Suddenly, he could see something. “The place was empty -- no one was there,” Sherlock said. “You were right, the business was a front. I wandered around, just in case they’d left something behind.”
That made Sherlock relax a little. “I know. I wanted to share it all with you. I never stopped wanting you to be there,” he confessed.
“We do run a consulting detective business,” Sherlock said, snuggling in. “And we figured it out eventually, so that’s another case solved, I suppose.”
“We’ll see, John -- remember you’re the sensible one. Maybe I’ll get a job, too,” Sherlock said. “But not today or tomorrow or the next. The next few days are just ours.”
"About having sex," Sherlock said. "Which is what I would like to do. Tonight, I mean. But I'm still nervous."
"I once had a dream about this," Sherlock said. "A long time ago . . . right after you moved in." He lifted his hand to grip the back of John's head, pulling lightly on his hair.
Sherlock stayed mostly quiet during dinner, though he was listening carefully. It's not that he was looking to catch Harry up, it's just that he knew addicts, he knew addiction, and he knew that John would be so crushed if Harry were to fall again. But he didn't hear anything that worried him - her descriptions were familiar and realistic. He watched the way John listened and reacted to her, remembering the time he'd said he would be friends with his sister if it weren't for her alcoholism. Sherlock could see that now. Which meant she was bound to be in Sherlock's life more as well, because John and Sherlock were intertwined forever. That thought made him smile so he reached over and held John's hand as they finished their coffee.
John had left the hospital with them and watched them get into Mycroft's car. Sherlock had accepted things too easily, so he was sure there had to be some kind of plan stewing in his head. He just had to go back home and wait for a phone call or a message or something -- if Sherlock planned on including him in his escape plan, which he was pretty certain he would.
John took his food back to the table but waited for Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson to come back to the table before he started eating.
“You were always better than them, and then you were kind of the boss of them,” Sherlock said. “I’m sure you were nice because you always are, but other people can be jerks.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said because at the moment he couldn’t really remember. “I guess work, but we’ve just finished a case and have nothing new.”  He looked over at John. “How are we going to work on cases if we can’t leave the flat?”
John shifted and lined up his cock, pushing into him as he leaned up for a kiss. Sherlock took John, gripping his shoulder with one hand as his other did his best to keep stroking himself. He kissed him and then bit his bottom lip tightly. “Good” was all he could mumble in the pleasure.
“We slept in our clothes,” Sherlock said. He retrieved two mugs from the cupboard and set them on the table.
“I should have told you what you mean to me, John,” Sherlock said. “Maybe then you’d have known the truth, that’d I never leave you . . . like that.”
"I'll believe it when I see it," John teased, going up to bed. He got out his book and read, but he was distracted, his mind going over everything they had talked about tonight and trying to see if there had been clues all along that he had missed.
"You've never stolen anything?" Sherlock asked suspiciously. "Remember, if you lie you have to drink twice," he added as if somehow he now controlled the rules of the game.
“All right,” Sherlock said. “Well, how can we figure out how to get you that then, because I confess I am getting a little bit bored with the horny-John-who-can’t-get-laid,” he added with a list.
John plugged in his phone and shifted to get comfortable. He was thinking about the present Sherlock got, the conversation they had been having, and how different the flat felt without him here. Mrs Hudson's words were needling his brain as he tried to fall asleep. But he knew Sherlock too well to think he was pining for John, dropping hints about his feelings being more than friends. John couldn't do anything drastic and risk ruining what they had here.
"Now you're just trying to embarrass me!" John laughed. "Sorry to disappoint you -- I just have old photos in there."
He led them back into the flat. "Should I do something here to prepare? I mean, should I move things around?" he asked.
"I am being perfectly normal! You're just . . . imagining things." It took everything in John to keep a straight face – everyone knew that Sherlock Holmes didn't imagine anything. He observed. "Are you eating anything or not?" He turned around again and finished up, bringing his plate to the table and sitting opposite Sherlock.
He licked his lips and tried again. "Do you come here a lot? Maybe you can recommend something good?"
“All right,” Sherlock said. “New question, though: why is it embarrassing? Because I’m so disgusting?”
"But you knew, and I let her stay and disrupt your work and now . . . well, now you know what she's like . . ." He didn't look at Sherlock as he spoke.
John grabbed the spray bottle he used to water the plants and sprayed Sherlock, so his cigarette went out.
“I said I wanted to be around you all the time,” Sherlock said. “Or perhaps that’s something you hear from everyone, so you did not appreciate what it meant.”
Sherlock heard the change in his voice. “I’m all right,” he said. “It was a mistake -- just a stupid mistake.”
Sherlock was pretty sure he knew what that meant. He moved down John’s body, licking his fingers and letting them explore between John’s legs. “This all right?”
Sherlock was picturing everything John said in his mind. He imagined the museum and the alley and the warehouse and all of them were very far away from any virus. He could feel his body and mind relaxing.
"John," Sherlock called out. He was aware how many times he'd said John's name in the last hour. It's because John was everything to him -- not just because they'd been trapped together for all this time, but because Sherlock knew now that John was everything he needed and wanted. He moved his hand to John's shoulders, stroking the soft skin that covered the muscles he kept hidden most of the time. He watched John until the sight was almost too much, and he had to close his eyes to keep from exploding.
John stared at him for a moment. "And then I'll come back down? How will that help me not fall asleep on the sofa?"
She smacked his arm. “Listen, I know men,” she said. “And he’s interested. And I know you, Sherlock Holmes, and I dare say you’re interested as well.”
“I’m not sure what Molly was thinking or if Mrs Hudson was somehow involved,” Sherlock said. “I’m not sure what to think.” He took a sip of tea and realised that was his completely honest response. “How have you been doing?” he asked. “Since we met, I mean.”
John clenched his jaw and nodded. "I do have to apologise. I let her stay here, and she dragged you into her lies and the things she said . . ." He shook his head. He headed upstairs and found Harry half asleep. He put the bottle of medicine and the water on the bedside table, took off her shoes and covered her up.
He moved over and sat down on the foot of John’s bed. He wasn’t going to invade John’s privacy now, not really. He just felt like sitting here for some reason. There was no harm in it. It just felt nicer being here than all alone out in the sitting room.
Sherlock looked at the band but didn’t watch them. He was tired of watching. He moved a little behind John, standing close and slipping his arm around his body. He took a drink and smiled to himself. After a while, though, Sherlock grew impatient. “How much longer?” he asked, leaning down to whisper in John’s ear.
Sherlock stood up and washed their mugs. Then his phone rang. He grabbed it and quickly moved to his desk.
"Sherlock, wake up properly -- this conversation is annoying me," she said, fussing with something in a drawer.
"Good," Sherlock said. "Should we sleep for a little bit? Then we can get up and you can eat something."
"I thought we were joking, teasing each other about stuff but now he won't answer me and I think he's angry."
"Right," he said slowly. "Involving John is much better than going it on your own, but . . ." his voice trailed off.
“No,” John said. “He’s my friend, and he trusts me. I think I’m easy to talk to so I get reactions and give him honest feedback without anyone knowing what I’m doing," he smiled.
Sherlock took another sip of wine and thought for a moment. Then suddenly he said, “I forgot to ask -- do you live alone?”
Sherlock opened the door a little, peeking his head in. They were both in bed, which was a good sign. “John and I wanted to go out to the shed after this film,” he said. “Is that okay? We didn’t want you to get worried if you heard the door.”
Sherlock gave her a silly smile and lit up a cigarette. “You look lovely as well, Mrs Hudson,” he said. “Thank you for coming to this with me. I wouldn’t have been able to tolerate it on my own.”
“I know,” Sherlock said. “Well, I’ve not found our guy yet, but as soon as I do, it should be relatively simple to finish this up.”
“Have you even got dressed since I last saw you?” she asked. “Or are you going to claim you’ve been ‘working’ too much to clean yourself up?”
When they pulled up, the building seemed smaller than he remembered, but it looked safe. They got out of the car and started loading up their arms. “Seem okay?” he asked John.
"John," Sherlock exhaled. He looked up at him and kissed his mouth hard. "Does it feel good to you? Do you like it?"
"No. The virus has been in the news for a while, but it’s getting worse. A few people have already died,” John explained.
“John, I am not good at ‘relaxing’ at the best of times. You expect me to start during a global pandemic?”
Sherlock slid his hand between their bodies and began stroking himself, slowly, matching John’s movement. Then he said, “Faster.”
Sherlock kissed John again, letting his hand drop to John’s back, settling on his shoulder blade. Then he looked at John’s face and said, “It is different with someone I like.”
Molly smiled. "Have you been behaving? I made the seating chart like this on purpose, I thought you two might have some things in common."
Sherlock pulled his head back in surprise. He sat down and put his head in his hands. “I hated your not being here,” he said quietly. “I need you to be here.” He looked over. “Why did you kiss me?”
Sherlock’s head felt a bit unclear. Why was John giving Lestrade all these specifics but keeping things vague for Sherlock? “No,” he mumbled. “I’m just concerned about this whole strategy.”
“Right,” Sherlock said. He sat quietly for a bit longer. “So you all worked up now? Imagining yourself as one of them?”
Sherlock sat quietly and thought about the fact that he’d barely been up an hour yet everything was different now. “How long until we eat? I’ve not had a cup of tea yet, which doesn’t seem right, but tea and spaghetti together doesn’t sound good at all.”
"I've been the one tortured! Watching you parade around in just a sheet or . . . or those damned shirts ready to burst open."
John turned, the coat swishing around his legs a bit. "No? Are you starting to see my potential?" he teased, lifting the collar again and modelling it.
John got ready for his date, made sure he had cash on him, and moved through the flat to go. He bumped into Sherlock on the stairs. "Oh, hey," he said. "I'm just heading out, did you solve your case?" he asked.
"Sorry," John said, holding Sherlock's waist. "And you are a flatmate I'm attracted to -- I've had many before I wasn't attracted to, but I am to you."
John heard the window and froze, moving close to the house. He glanced up and saw Sherlock leaning out of the window with a cigarette. John bit his lip. He looked good. He was handsome, his dark hair a bit longer now, the curls falling around his face. John didn't know when he started smoking, but, in a strange way, it just made him look better somehow. He forced his eyes away and crouched down, still against the house. He kept digging, his movements very slow now. The slice of the shovel in the dirt sounded a hundred times louder. He kept glancing up, each time for longer and longer. He tried to shift a bit and almost dropped the shovel. "Shit," he hissed, then pressed against the house again. There was no cover. He just closed his eyes and hoped that Sherlock hadn’t heard him.
“All right,” Sherlock said, still not sure quite what he meant. “I read some stuff too, I guess. Should we try it?”
Sherlock stood up and moved over, standing still and staying quiet in hopes they’d go away. Which was stupid because, of course, they’d know he was home. Everyone was home. Everyone except whoever was on the other side of the door.
“God, John,” Sherlock said. He let his hand find John’s cock and began stroking it. He too looked down to watch them touching each other.
Sherlock was sitting at his desk, feeling very pleased. Yesterday he’d had a new client and he’d just completed the case and received payment. It was quite easy obviously, but if he could get a few of those, he’d have a relatively steady income and still have time work with the police when they got in over their heads. And now he’d just responded to a second possible client. Things were starting to go as planned.
John rolled his eyes and lifted the computer again, but then his phone rang. "Greg, thank God. What's going on?" John asked.
Sherlock looked over. John’s face seemed curious -- like he really wanted to know about this. John bent down to examine the headstone. He was curious. Sherlock liked that very much. He bent down as well and explained what he knew about the man’s life and death.
"No, I'm not drunk," Sherlock said. "Let's be quiet now." He rested his hand on John's on his chest. "Except one more thing. Do you think you love me?"
Sherlock pulled up some music on his computer and returned to the sofa next to John. “I used to listen to this when I was a teenager,” he said. “I know classical music is an odd choice for a kid, but I found it comforting. Like it understood everything.”
"Teasing? Sherlock doesn't do teasing. Does he? I've just never seen that, John. Does he do that with you?"
“I know that,” Sherlock said. “I just mean . . . here . . . might be different. I told myself it wouldn’t -- that when I got home everything and everyone would be the same, but that’s probably not the case.”
Sherlock smiled. “Yes,” he said. “She’s always coming up with schemes. I doubt there was ever a problem with the pipes in that house. That’s just the kind of thing she’d do.”
John hummed in surprise, shifting an arm free to tangle his hand in Sherlock's curls as he kissed back with equal intensity. Sherlock kept the kiss going, sliding his hands to John’s lower back and pulling his hips against his. He moved forward, backing John nearer to the bed, before slowly lowering them both down against the mattress. He crawled over John and continued kissing his mouth as his hand moved down to his hip, gripping it, rocking his body against the bed. John groaned in approval, his hands tugging Sherlock's shirt out of his trousers to get it off.
He hadn’t actually, but now he realized what she meant. “Right,” he said, hiding his face with his mug. “I don’t suppose I will meet one.”
“No,” Sherlock said defensively. “It’s fine.” He looked over at her. “Do you think it’s fine?” he asked.
"What else do you think will be different now?" John asked, shifting to get more comfortable but using the move to get a little closer.
Sherlock had moved over to the sofa and flicked through the television channels with the sound down. He made one more cup of tea and watched the end of a film he thought he recognised but then realised he hadn’t. Then he turned off the television and went into his room, getting into bed with a book. This bored him quite quickly and he decided to just give up and go to sleep.
John blinked at him. Was he joking? Or had Sherlock really been so focused on work that he’d missed everything? "Sherlock, we're in the middle of a pandemic!"
The way she said it made John wonder if this was court-ordered but he didn't press her--not in front of Sherlock. He knew how bad it could have been; Sherlock did not need to know that. "Well, it's good that you're doing this and getting better."
“This is good, right?” Sherlock said, letting his hands roam up and down John’s back.  “We should’ve tried this before.”
John tugged the blanket over his legs too. "Our hero turned to his wizard, who used a spell to help our hero's mind expand and see more clearly. Thanks to the wizard our hero knew the answer! He solved the case -- sorry, the mission -- and everyone was saved. To celebrate they went to the zoo and looked at the tigers. The end." He looked up and saw that Sherlock was almost asleep.
John moved up into Sherlock, moaning as he held his hips. "Yes . . . it is," he said, looking down to watch.
John stuffed his phone into his pocket. He was skeptical. The flat wasn't very far at all, but it had to be expensive. Still, Molly knew the woman and she was expecting him, so when he finished for the day, he headed to Baker Street.
He thought about the conversation they’d had in John’s bedroom last night. Obviously, John had not understood what Sherlock was trying to tell him. He thought for a few moments. What precisely had he been trying to tell John? Now he needed to solve this one.
John let his head fall to the side and he panted softly, but the sound of his breathing brought him back to reality. He was drunk, not a lot, but enough. This wasn't a good idea. "I . . . I should go to bed," he said, pulling back a bit.
John stood up and followed him, his mouth tilted up in a half smile. "I don't think you're very focused on the case."
John headed to the surgery where he was having his interview. He walked inside and saw a lobby full of patients, and in a short row of chairs a couple people dressed up like he was. He sat down beside the woman in the middle seat, offering a polite smile before looking through his resume for something to do while he waited.
John looked over sharply and just barely held back his reply. No. He wasn't going to engage with Sherlock when he was acting like that. He went back to organising the desk, ignoring Sherlock.
John's brows raised very slightly in surprise. "Oh. It was good -- really good. I'm over qualified but I hope that won't hurt my chances. I think I'm going to get it," he said.
Sherlock sat back for a second. He moved his laptop in front of him and shut it. Then he smiled. “Wow, John, you do surprise me – for someone who masturbates in the shower 2.7 times a week, I am genuinely shocked this is the first time you’ve had a sex dream. Even I had my first one when I was a teenager,” he said. He looked over with mock concern and added, “Did you have a wet dream? Do you have questions? Don’t feel ashamed – it’s just that your body is changing.” Despite his attempt, he couldn’t help laughing aloud.
John grabbed the paper and came back up to the flat. The front page was the arrest of the drug dealer, so John sank into his chair to read it.
Sherlock glanced over at the girlfriend who was still alone. He turned back and said, “I don’t think so. I’m working -- you took me away from my job. That’s money out of my pocket. You understand -- you said you’re working as well, right?”
John stared at the door for a moment. "I'm here about the invoice, we spoke on the phone Friday evening."
John rolled his eyes as they moved the conversation along. Just a few more days, and it all would be over.
He hesitated. He bit his lip and clicked them open, reading through them. What was he doing? He couldn't just be a detective without Sherlock. He wasn’t the detective, he was the blogger. That’s who they were.
Sherlock moved his head toward John’s ear, letting his cheek brush against John’s. “All right,” he said.
“Just enough to volunteer to go outside in the cold to chop wood,” his father said. He motioned to the wood pile. “Let’s do a bit to take into the shed to dry so we don’t have to do this everyday.”
Sherlock was unlocking the door, but he turned back to look at John. “Really?” he asked. He turned to step into the flat. “We both know that’s not true. You don’t have to tell me why, I suppose, but don’t lie to me about something I can see with my own eyes.”
John grinned at Sherlock. "Nothing! What's up with you?" He hung up as the man started to curse angrily.
When John realised they were close to blowing their cover -- and Sherlock finally stopped trying to inject questions -- he wrapped things up and they left the gallery. When they got onto the pavement, Sherlock pulled out a cigarette and lit it before he said anything. Without looking over at John, he said, “That was useful” before exhaling into the sky.
Sherlock was listening to the sounds of the flat, remembering. He listened as John’s footsteps neared his room, as his knuckles tapped on his door. “John,” he said quietly, not turning on the bed. “Come in.”
“The owner contacted us,” Mycroft said. “He assumed it was going abroad and it turns out he was right. We stopped it at the border and the painting is in our custody.”
Sherlock smiled knowingly. “Why did you grab me that night?” he asked. “Pure chance? Would you have grabbed whoever had been standing next to you?” He looked over. “Be honest -- I appreciate honesty more than flattery.”
"You're just saying that," Sherlock said softly. His hand moved down to John's neck, rubbing it and then his shoulder. "To be nice . . . which you always are."
“Right, the case,” Sherlock said. “I definitely want to hear about that, but first I need to show you something. Hurry up and finish your wine.”
"She didn't want to see me. Said she's 'done' - how can she say that? How can she just cut me totally off?"
John looked over at Sherlock. "I don't know. I suppose that's the awkward part," he said. "Would you want to?"
John looked up and was sure he was hallucinating. He pushed the computer onto the sofa and stood slowly. "How . . . you . . ." He started shaking his head. "I saw you . . . "
“We talked last night,” he said. He took another sip, but still didn’t look over at her. “Do you think that’s a stupid idea?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s body and kissed his mouth. Tonight everything was different, but he also knew that everything was how it should be.
"I didn't know if you remembered. Or wanted to." He looked up at Sherlock again, studied his face. "I was afraid you might have moved it a long time ago."
Sherlock glanced over at his father whose look told him Sherlock’s answer had been the wrong one. “On second thought,” Sherlock said. “Maybe something small might be nice.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. He leaned forward a little as he looked closely into John’s eyes. Then he raised his glass to tap John’s. “Good,” he repeated.
“I didn’t know if I should wake you,” Sherlock said, getting up from his desk. “That said, I’m ready to leave now.”
"Well, you will," Sherlock said childishly. "And I'll mess up your sock drawer which I know will drive you mad since you're obsessed with tidiness." He looked over. "In fact, I may in just become you for the rest of the day. I may go around scowling and then laughing at stupid things on the television and complaining about dishes in the sink and admiring my handsome face in the mirror. I'll do all the things you do everyday and then you can see what it's like to live with Doctor John Watson. Perhaps then you'll be a little kinder and a little less mocking to your poor flatmate."
“Does it? Well, fine, if you’d like to fight about it – what do you think I’m afraid of Mr Smarty Pants?”
“That’s better,” Sherlock said. “Your drink is still there. Shall we listen to music, watch a film, talk to each other, or do something else? The rule in this flat is that I provide options, you make the choice. Well, that’s the rule for today at least.”
The comment stung Sherlock, of course. It was meant to. But Sherlock did not rise to his brother’s words. Because Sherlock knew John better than Mycroft did. And John knew Sherlock. Yes, his return would shock John, but John would forgive him.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Very good at it actually.” He moved to the fridge. “What do you want to drink?”
Sherlock smiled and then began to drift down John's body -- licking from John's neck to collarbone before shifting to suck on one of his nipples. He pressed his hips into John's thigh.
“It’s just -- I just mean you don’t have to worry about me revealing anything. I know how to do this. If specifics come up, and I’m not sure they will, I’ll have a story.”
Sherlock took the letter and reread it, reminding himself. “Well, the whole thing’s pretty much about you,” he said.
Sherlock slipped his coat on and felt his pocket for his cigarettes. “Just a short walk . . . to clear my head, you know . . . I won’t be gone long,” he said. “I can get Chinese if you call it in.”
“Whatever you want,” Sherlock said. “I can help, if you need me to. Or you can do it on your own – you always do such an excellent job,” he added, giving John a stupid smile.
"Well, the lockdown is still in place, so that's too bad," John said without looking up from the paper.
Sherlock watched the show and was soon making complaints about the poor police procedures and the bad acting skills of all involved. After fifteen minutes, he said, “Have you figured out who did it yet?”
Sherlock looked up and gave John a smile. Maybe some people needed luck, but one thing Sherlock was certain of was that John Watson was a good doctor.
John pursed his lips. "You . . .ugh," he sighed exasperated. "I had a dream. A sex dream. That's all. It's stupid and embarrassing, and I hope you're proud of yourself."
Sherlock took a sip of whiskey and then handed it to John as he tried to get comfortable on the bed. “Should you turn the light off?” he asked.
John went on to his next job and put Baker Street out of his mind. He just wanted to get back home and enjoy his free weekend. After his last job, he picked up dinner and went back to his flat, settling at the desk to finish invoices and organise his appointments for the next week. When he got to filing away Mrs Hudson's, he realised he hadn’t written anything up for the second visit. Obviously, there was no charge as he’d done nothing, but the office wanted paperwork for everything. He checked the time and decided it wasn't too late for a phone call.
"No . . . I don't think," Sherlock said. "I just mean . . . since I don't have anything pressing that I need to be up for. Anyway, I guess all I'm saying is I'm going to have a cup of tea now." He turned to fill his mug.
"Well, your little game has had a surprising effect . . ." Sherlock said, lifting his hand to grip John's arm. "What do you think of that?"
John’s touch distracted Sherlock for a second -- it felt nice, relaxing. “I wish you had come with me,” he said. “It wouldn’t have happened.”
“I have no idea,” Sherlock said. “Which reminds me – you feeling okay? You didn’t have any side effects from my dinner, did you?”
John closed his eyes. Sherlock's hand . . . it felt very good in in hair. "You're always right," he murmured.
“I’ll be honest – that’s probably hopeful thinking,” Sherlock acknowledged. “I think I’d prefer to sleep through all this, but you’re right, it’s unlikely.”
“Maybe you could let me decide what’s good and what’s bad for me,” Sherlock mumbled. “You didn’t bring my book,” he added grumpily, pushing the bag away from him.
“John, the goal was to prove we are interesting people – what I’ve got planned is not intense, it’s interesting,” Sherlock said. “Remember being interesting? It wasn’t that long ago.”
“Good,” Sherlock said, focusing again. “I presume I’m the boy. Are you the wizard, the knight or the princess?”
John set up his schedule for the next two days and tried to stay focused and work efficiently but his mind wandered more than once to the upcoming date with Sherlock. Not so much the date but seeing him again without work pressing him for time. He was excited.
Sherlock was surprised to see that John hadn’t been lying. He picked up a few boxes and walked to the door, holding it open for John. “Is this all of it?” he asked.
“John sat down next to the boy and for some reason, the boy let John watch and didn’t even mind when John made a few comments because his comments were useful because everything John did was great, don’t forget. When Sherlock was finished, John asked him where he lived. Sherlock pointed to a cave not that far away from John’s. It was odd that John had never noticed the cave before, but he hadn’t. The boy started walking away. John followed him which for some reason didn’t bother Sherlock at all.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, taking the clipboard. “Wait -- why is it you are in such a hurry? You just got here and now you want to rush off?”
Sherlock squirmed a little and then mumbled, “Let’s take these off,” as he pushed on John’s underwear and then moved to pull off the rest of his own clothes. He settled back on his side and reached again for John, letting his hips move more freely when John went back to stroking him. John found Sherlock's mouth and kissed him again, hard and needy. Everything felt so good.
“The theft was real,” Mycroft said. “I’m afraid it was all a bit of a misunderstanding. There is no Charles Altamont.”
Sherlock was full and tired when he finally headed up to bed Christmas night. He had eaten almost all of the cheese his mother had bought him and then managed to eat quite a bit at dinner as well. It had tasted good and, though, he’d never admit it to anyone, it had brought back nice memories of his childhood. He climbed into his bed after midnight and turned out the light.
Sherlock closed his eyes and let his head tilt back a little. He hadn’t expected this to happen this  way, but he was not sorry it had. He could feel his legs tremble a little. “Stop,” he said suddenly. “Look up at me.”
“Should I be worried that I’m the weakest link in this band of heroes? All the boy does is like adventures. Everyone else is great,” Sherlock pretended to be offended.
“But I want to touch you,” Sherlock said, throwing his trousers on to the floor as well. Once John’s shirt was off, he ran his hands up and down John’s chest.
"I'm not good at making up stories, but I’ll try.” John settled back and thought for a moment, trying to recall a memory he could turn into a story. "One time there were two kids that really, really wanted a pet. A puppy, actually."
John tugged him close and pressed into him, hugging him tightly. "I love you too. I don't want to lose you again."
John held how gaze and nodded. "Well, I'm glad you're better. And I'm glad you offered it to Harry as well." He touched Sherlock's hand softly. "Thank you."
“It does,” Sherlock purred. “And it’s going to feel even better . . . I wonder what will happen next . . .” Sherlock whispered. He kept them rocking for a few moments and then his hand slowed but didn’t let go. “Shall we move to the bed?”
John nodded. "You must be tired," he said. He stood and took his own plate to the sink, taking the time to wash up everything. "I'm going up as well. It's been a long day," he said. He looked over at Sherlock. "I'm really glad you're home, Sherlock."
Sherlock wasn’t sure why he was being so silly. He had a brandy with his father, but that wasn’t enough liquor to affect him like this.
John’s anger eased. "Well, .we'll figure it out," he said. "You could just tell me what it is you want me to do if I come with you again."
John pulled his hand away, slightly embarrassed by the change in subject. "I think I will go up to bed now." He got up and took his mug to the sink. He was having a hard time reading the situation. "Good night, Sherlock," he said from the stairs.
