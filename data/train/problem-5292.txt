Tony nodded. Flying in the suit might help steady him more, but if he freaked out mid-flight, he wouldn’t get back to the Compound in time. On a plane, worst case scenario, he could hide in the bathroom. “Any word on how they got so close without tripping the doorbell?”
Yet somehow his acknowledgment made Tony angry. “Well, you’re welcome to fly someone else in and save your ass, Rogers. Should I maybe give Ross a call? He’s still demanding your immediate surrender-”
From across the cockpit, Tony caught Steve’s gaze and held it; Steve’s battlefield instincts thrilled with foreboding, remembering Tony’s words from weeks ago. ‘If I go in first and don’t die…’ he’d said. The billionaire hadn’t so much as hinted at the idea since, but his words still haunted Steve. Going into battle with that kind of superstition in his head, who knows what Tony would do. Would be willing to do. If they landed now without incident, it would only strengthen the billionaire’s belief that his mere presence could avert disaster, and Steve found himself halfway wishing for something to swoop out of the air and interrupt them, just a little. Anything to knock some caution back into Tony’s head.
Tony closed his eyes, still floored by the unfamiliar sensation of comfort, of warm, dizzying peace. He would give anything to keep this, he realized. Risk anything, pay anything. He tried to calculate the odds that Steve could feel even halfway as strongly, but then the other man sighed, hot breath tickling his hair so that Tony felt a thrill of lust throughout his whole body. It was so distracting he forgot how to math.
“Yeah yeah, laugh it up, fuzzface,” Tony griped, but it was natural then, easy, to get up and start the day together, go find food together, assemble the team together, and later comfort Thor together before spending the first of many more nights wrapped in each others’ arms; it was natural, and easy, and Tony let himself enjoy this strange new intimacy without caring about the questioning glances or the awkward whispers, because this was the future where he would save everyone, this was the only way, and he could make it as beautiful as he wanted.
Tony felt as though he was falling through the ground, the revelation throwing his understanding into new, desperate configurations. So it couldn’t be Nebula. But then… Thor had kept his distance from everyone since losing his people, losing his family. Everyone except Bruce, but… oh god. The Hulk. So it couldn’t be Thor, either. That only left…
, now that he was looking. The man Tony knew, the man he now saw before him, they had always been one and the same. Steve Rogers wasn’t the paragon of pure virtue and easy optimism the world liked to see. No, his essence lay in his fierce hope and reckless heart, but above all, in his constant restless
For the first time, Steve turned, looked him in the eye. It should have been reassuring, but a chill went through Tony at the emptiness in the super-soldier’s eyes. “I don’t want to watch you die again,” the man said, calmly, as if discussing the weather.
“Really, you should be honored,” Ty continued. “So many years of planning, so much thankless effort, but look. I’ve made you a star.”
Truth was truth, even when it was hard. “I never hated you, Steve,” Tony said softly. “I tried. Believe me, I tried. And to be honest, I wish I’d succeeded, because not hating you kinda fucked me up. There’s always been this idiot schoolkid part of me that wants to worship you, that still thinks Captain America could never be wrong. So if Steve Rogers himself didn’t trust me, if you thought I wasn’t good enough to be your friend, then it had to be because I wasn’t worthy.”
“Kiss me,” Steve ordered, blue eyes demanding Tony’s total attention, his need bright and cruel as the noonday sun.
He watched the gates fly by for the final time. As the car raced along the winding roads, Tony rolled down the windows, breathing in the fresh air, the freedom, the way the summer sun turned Steve's hair into a golden halo against the deep blue sky. In sudden impulse, he reached out and switched on the radio, humming along to the first song he heard; ‘
Slowly, bitter realization clicked into place, and Tony forced himself to look up. Steve had placed his body between Tony and the relentless images and was now glaring over his head at the largest screen on the wall-
i'd love to hear any thoughts or critique you may have. i write for fun but i post shit in hopes of feedback, so no need to spare my feelings. i promise i will read and reflect on every comment, but i may choose not to reply if i don't trust myself to engage in good grace (still working on that thick writer skin, sorry!).
Tony could barely conceal his smugness, and he pressed a kiss on the other man’s forehead. “Not to brag, but
. He staggered out of the isolation suite, ignoring the startled concern of the nurses, searching blindly until he found a small, empty room, away from the eyes, far away from the sorry excuse he had for a life.
“Maybe not,” Tony blurted out, and it was like everyone in the ship took their first deep breath in six days.
By some piteous miracle, Nebula had left certain… events… out of her report. Which was good; it was no one’s business but his and Steve’s. And also bad, because he had no idea what to do or think or feel about any of it, and talking would maybe have helped, but telling people what he'd done might make Steve even angrier at him. Yet his friends wanted to help. Maybe some of the truth would be enough.
With a rasping swish, the glass door slid open and Helen Cho stepped into the isolation room, face sombre behind her visor. “Captain Rogers,” she said, bad news ringing through her voice. “Steve.”
Steve felt something stir within him, but couldn’t put a name to it. “I… don’t know,” he said eventually. “I just woke up.”
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” she whispered, her eyes steady on his. “I can sit with Captain Rogers.”
The kid bobbed his head violently in response. “Oh, oh of course, I just… if I may, I just wanted to say thank you, for going public. It really means a lot to the community.”
Steve was floating once more among the stars, lost among their clamor. Their warnings sounded so cold. Empty.
. He could definitely answer for this. “Tony, it just… At first it just seemed too horrible to be true. I thought Zola was lying to mess with me. Then Nat gave me Bucky’s file, and I saw how Hydra had used him… It seemed to fit, but Tony, without proof, I just couldn’t be sure. And maybe I didn’t want to believe it, but I also didn’t want to hurt you by bringing up the past without good reason. You know you hate it whenever I bring up Howard-”
Tony turned back from where he’d been studying the galloping machines. “Wait, what? Of course you’re brave, no one could possibly-”
When they got to the large, gaudy gates, Tony stopped the car in his usual surveillance blind spot. Steve glanced over, his eyes full of unspoken sympathy.
Nat stuck out her tongue at him, then refocused her attention on the twins, asking them to explain what they were doing, then joining them on the floor to inspect their work. Drawing a line through any further conversation.
Tony crossed his arms and leaned against the nearest side table. “Oh yeah?” he said, trying to summon the energy to play along. “How good?”
Steve looked as though he might throw up. Tony could only watch. Yet the other man rallied and stepped towards Tony, holding a cautious hand out to him as though he were a wild animal. “Tony, I don't… you thought it was me?”
She nods, watching him. “The power of the Infinity Stones created the universe within which time itself flows. It is possible that all six used together could affect all possible timelines at once.”
Relieved smiles turned to applause which turned to cheers, the crowd rinsing themselves clear of the last traces of panic. Tony waited it out, every fiber of his body aching to leave but equally aware of his duty to project complete confidence. Hurrying would create doubt, which would inspire fear, and he suspected there would be plenty of that before long.
“Is that why you found…” Steve couldn’t bring himself to say the man’s name, but Tony seemed to know what he was trying to ask.
In answer, Shuri smirked. “Don’t be silly. I’m amazing. You’re done here.” Magnificent, cheeky girl. Uh, Queen.
of that. One month after Bucky’s fall, he’d crashed a plane into the sea, claiming necessity. And now here he was crashing again, mere days after losing Peggy. He’d walked away from his team, his friends, his
“I would like to apologize for my former pursuit,” T’Challa said, taking a careful step towards Bucky. “I indulged in a need for revenge to escape my grief, and it almost cost an innocent life. I am truly sorry.”
, that Steve fell into the most undignified giggles. He should be freaking out, he knew, but somehow, with Tony in his arms, he felt both rock steady and infinitely delirious. For a second Tony just watched him laugh, grinning slightly, then thoroughly put an end to his distraction by claiming Steve’s mouth again. Then, with a magician’s ease, he slipped a deft hand into Steve’s pants and-
Yet destruction was always easier than creation; the level of energy that would need to be unleashed to remake life… that may not be survivable for anyone. None of them mentioned it out loud, but they all knew. Going back may cost everything. But maybe that would be better, given the horrors of these past months. For no one to remember.
The young Queen shot him a grin, then with a casual gesture brought up a scrolling list of statistics.
Contrary to popular opinion, even among his friends, Tony Stark knew all too well that he had a heart.
“I significantly injured Thanos before he left,” Thor spoke up, his voice heavy with regrets. “And the Gauntlet was visibly damaged. If he is alone on Titan, he may yet be vulnerable to direct attack.”
.” Tony knew it was small as gestures went, almost insignificant, but walking away, he felt exhilarated. Plus, he caught Steve trying to hide a proud smile, so clearly they were destined to be petty bastards together. “All yours, Cap,” he said with an answering grin.
He understood. Out of all the Avengers, only Bruce had known the full extent of what she’d gone through as a kid, the Red Room’s ‘graduation ceremony’ a hideous proof of how far they would go to own her future. Steve had sometimes wondered why Nat would have such a profound attachment to Clint’s family while continually shooting down any possibility of ever having her own, but through all the years of being her friend, he hadn’t asked and she hadn’t shared. Nat had gone on keeping her personal life intensely private, had thrown herself into her work leading the team after his and Tony’s retirement, right up until the day a passing medical scan had revealed the truth: her former tormentors had
“So maybe we don’t either,” Shuri said. Everyone looked at her. “We had assumed the Infinity Stones were lost to us, so the quantum realm was the only possible alternative. But if they’re still in play…”
“The big bad guy who’s coming to Earth, uh, Thanos? Mr Stark told me to watch out for him,” Spider-Man explained, his young voice cheerful. He did a double-take at Stark’s unhappy grimace. “Oh wait, should I not have said his name?”
. All possible futures after that point would be undone. Tony had carefully suggested that Nebula or Thor could, in fact, preserve this future if the rest of them wished to survive, but the idea of continuing on in this brutal reality with just a vague hope that things were better
Tony felt a swell of savage emotion within him. Bless this man. “I love you,” he said, breathless with everything else he was leaving unsaid. Steve tilted his head to one side. Considered him. Scorched him. Tony felt heat rise within him again, his body answering the call.
Eventually, pressed against Steve’s chest, Tony sniffed, then looked up at Nat. “What did he say?” Despite his obvious effort, there was still fear in Tony’s voice; it seemed to break the last vestiges of denial in the room. Bruce sat down beside Rhodey, sudden as a puppet with its strings cut.
Steve scrambled to his feet, mechanically gathering his clothes off the floor, then stormed out of the room, still too stunned and hurt and furious to say a word.
“About that,” Tony said, and then the ground was on his face and Rhodey was shouting loud words in his ear but it was too late, he was already crumbling, and he felt himself swoop one full circle and lift away into the dark place again.
Tony nodded. “When I woke up, I thought…. I thought she deserved my anger. Some kind of justice.” He glanced up at Steve. “But then you looked at me like…” He shook his head, lost for words. “When I saw how much I’d hurt you, I thought… this isn’t justice. This is evil. Something I could never take back.”
Strange was already on his feet. His hands gestured, a golden portal opened, and Steve’s body floated up and through. With Wilson’s help, Tony followed, the other man shepherding him through the portal into what looked like a janitor’s closet. Another door brought them into a corridor bustling with familiar sounds and smells.
“I do? Uh, sure, yeah. So Tony, this ship can land wherever you want it, or it can stay in orbit and we can take a shuttle to the Tower if that’s better,” Bruce said.
Steve dropped his cup, heedless of the splash of lukewarm coffee across the table because his eyes -
“I’m not anything special, Tony,” Steve said, frowning. “I’m just a person, there are plenty of other people who could handle the serum responsibly.”
Relief was a tsunami within him, a barrage of hope almost cruel in its intensity, but as Tony drew Steve’s hand to his own mouth and repeated their word against his skin, it was Steve who bowed his head and wept; this fragile lonely Steve, still trying even now to give Tony everything he asked for, still willing to give and give with everything he had left; so brave and strong; his Steve, always.
She studied him, her eyes gentle but relentless. “I said we had been trying to reach you, but no, you didn’t know yet.” Steve felt Tony exhale, sagging deeper against him. “He said he would meet you at home.” Nat grimaced. “He was… eager to be the one to tell you.”
Somehow, Peggy had survived decades of his loss with her dignity intact. She had mourned him, yes. Deeply and sincerely, she’d said. But then she’d left him behind too, had moved on and built a full and happy life for herself, somehow finding the strength to keep her memories close without succumbing to their burden of grief.
“Thank you,” was all he said. Rhodey said nothing but held out a hand and pulled him to his feet. Tony was amazed to discover he felt strong, standing. Even walking went well. Wakanda forever.
He caught Shuri’s shoulder, turned to Rhodey, Bruce, Okoye nearby. “You have to evacuate, now. He’ll take the whole palace with him.” They nodded, the two Wakandans stepping away to issue commands into their wrist devices; Tony could feel Bruce and Rhodey staring but he stepped past them, raised his voice, icy with command. “Thor, Nat, everyone. Time to go.” The Asgardian took one last look at Steve, still trying - failing - to stand, and his shoulders slumped in defeat.
The whirling dome of waiting energy above was now composed of five colors to match the Stones safely glowing on their shared Gauntlet; orange, blue, red, purple, and yellow. Yet unlike the raging storm of before, the colors flowed smoothly in and around each other in shifting ribbons, something similar to the Northern Lights. For a full thirty seconds, he let the sight soothe him, let himself picture how much Rhodey would have loved it, even imagined himself describing it to him when he saw his friend again. If he saw him again, his mind chipped in. Cool, mind. Great talk.
“Well, to put it in terms your mortal mind might comprehend,” the Stone said bitingly, “we took you on a nice high-speed tour through the marvels of cosmic existence, and halfway through, you decided to fling yourself out the window. How in high heaven did you find your way back?”
Tony stayed silent, studying him until Steve looked up. His dark eyes were unreadable, but something about the moment made Steve’s heart beat faster, made his instincts thrill in an electric anticipation. Steve held himself steady, not sure what was happening. Tony tilted his head to one side, seemed about to speak, and Steve leaned in just a little, all the better to hear.
“Sure, sure,” Steve murmured, opting not to watch as the doctor started fiddling with the needle in his hand.
,” Thor is roaring nearby, then the Asgardian is blinking in surprise at Thanos slumped dead around his ax. “What-?” he asks, and turns as Steve laughs harder, unable to contain his relief, his joy.
“Boss?” Friday broke through his panicked thoughts. “I believe the ship is attempting to make contact.” Shuri swung round, looking to Tony with an indecision he shared. Sure, in theory the system was designed around total transparency. In theory, it was supposed to broadcast proximity alerts so that all of Earth could simultaneously be made aware of a potential threat and people had time to take shelter without causing mass panic in the streets.
Still off-balance, it took Tony a moment to comprehend where Steve was going, but as the realization hit, he followed with terrified haste, arriving just as Steve finished smashing through the steel door to reveal a terrified-looking Ty-
This time, Asgard is prepared for the attack, and their enemies are soon vanquished. After, Steve tries to tell this Thor and Jane everything useful he can think of before he returns the Aether. They beg him to stay for the feast, as Asgard’s guest of honor; Steve agrees, but first, he asks for some paper.
Tony thought, his mouth tasting of ash. Even if he broke free of his restraints, he couldn’t make it in time. They were done-
These interactions, however important, had never gotten less awkward. There were too many people staring for sincerity, so Tony opted for blithe cheeriness. “Hey, love is love,” he grinned. “But how about you ask me something I can answer. Do you have any questions about what we’re doing here today? You know, the billion-dollar space defense system we’re about to deploy?”
Tony gave him the soft, crooked smile that was his second favorite Tony expression. “There are many ways to be with someone, Steve, I kinda need you to be specific. What exactly do you want here?”
Before Steve's eyes, Tony’s face had drained of expression, slowly becoming something blank, remote. Unreachable. “So was I,” he said softly.
When Peter burst through the door, it took a sharp nudge from Rhodey before Tony could bear to open his eyes, Bruce shooting to his feet as if on guard.
Steve Rogers would run off and do something heroically stupid at the first opportunity; of course Tony hadn’t been watching, not when it mattered, not when it could have helped. He didn’t say goodbye, Tony thought, but he shook the hurt out of his head. No time. The others had already left, and the spasm of terror was lifting now, enough to walk, enough to run.
“If you ring the bell, you can get me kicked out,” May told him, once the last awful falafel was vanquished.
Steve was smiling right back, his blue eyes sparkling with warmth and love and humor. “I mean, they are kinda cute-”
Outside, the fading light signaled night’s approach. Inside, Steve stayed motionless, his mind lost in relentless wheels of misery. As the sun set over the water he did turn his head, but he was too sunken to appreciate the spectacle.
Waking up in such a weird future just felt so much like a dream; another gift from the ice, a fantasy to comfort a dying mind. Oh, he’d believed that he was awake eventually, but a cold, lonely part of Steve had not fully trusted, had not fully accepted the world as properly real until he met the Soldier the world had built while he’d slept. The ice had given him pain, agony beyond measure, but the details of Bucky’s fate had torn Steve’s detachment to shreds. Not even the ice would be so cruel.
Tony’s face cycled through a dozen fleeting expressions, but he settled on a soft smile; Steve smiled back, giddy with delight.
“God, Tony,” Steve felt like his heart was splitting open, “is it really so hard to believe?” When the other man just shook his head, Steve pressed on. “I spent two years trying to hate you, trying to forget that night ever happened, but somehow despite everything you’re
Steve marched towards Thanos again, his stride steadying as his body distanced itself further from the shock. The Mad Titan watched the two of them approach. The Captain planted his feet before his enemy and crossed his arms, refusing to acknowledge the flare of pain the motion caused.
Whenever in solitude, Tony fought hard not to remember a time where his heart, despite years of abuse by shrapnel and questionable eating habits, was
Stephen Strange was never known to mince his words, but Tony knew the man enough to know he didn’t mean any heat.
"And it wasn't you who did it. James Buchanan Barnes, as I've come to know, is a legitimate asshole, but he's not a killer. Heck, you can't even pick a proper secret hideout, so you'd make a horrible villain."
Steve groans, spanking the firm flesh before burying his face between Tony’s cheeks again. “Mine. Fuck, all
," Sam carefully explains. "For yours or Stark’s DON’T EVEN-“ Sam quickly wags a finger as Steve opens his mouth to interrupt, but shuts it with an audible click. “TRY TO tell me who’s been topping or bottoming or whatever it is you two do in the sack. We are not having
He tries not to sigh, so he inhales the roses in the bouquet pressed to his chest. He didn't come for a fight, not with Steve and certainly not with Steve's best friend with whom he shared a love-hate relationship with. They've always been indifferent to each other, but right now Tony was at a disadvantage. By now Barnes would have gotten the whole low down of Steve and Tony's recent fallout, so Tony braces himself.
“Hey there, kid. No uh, b-band practice today?” Tony forces himself to say without looking, desolately trying to hide his condition. Tony decides to pretend that he was working on the untouched R8, casually popping the hood of his favourite car while trying very hard not to vomit into the shiny, spotless engine.
Steve presses his larger, muscular body against Tony's sweaty back once they were both on their sides, and he tilts Tony's face towards him to kiss him sweetly. Tony sighs into his lips, leaning eagerly with an open mouth and twinning his tongue to Steve's. As their mouths seal in a passionate erotic kiss, Steve lifts Tony's leg to nestle his steel hard erection under his husband's balls, rutting against his perineum and cock.
Steve frowns. “Well he finished the bacon and eggs but he won’t touch the vegetables. I told you letting him play during dinner time was a bad idea – you know how focused he gets especially when he starts building,” Steve says as he leans into a balled fist, unsmiling and tired. “I wonder where he got
As though sensing discomfort, Steve rises from his position, and slides an elbow to prop himself up on his chest to turn and face the brunette. With one eye opened, possibly because half of his face was still numb from the sleeping position he had woken up from, Steve's aqua blue eye met Tony’s gaze.
“Oh, you ingrate. I'll have you know I was a total babe back then,” he says in mock-offense, rising to his feet. "Nerd yes, but totally bang-worthy."
"He wouldn't marry me Pep," Tony says, sighing. "He thinks he's duty-bound to throw the damn frisbee until the day he dies. I guess he'd consider marrying me if I stayed in the team for as long as he did. Ironman YES, Tony Stark NO."
Tony rolls off of Steve and lays flat on his back. They look to the stars, completely fucked out and blink in silence for a while to let things sink in. They burst into a fit of giggles at the same time, realising how oblivious they've been to each other this whole time. The pair eventually look to each other contently, still sprawled on the throw blanket half naked under the open sky.
He was careful and considerate, but not distant to give the impression that he wasn't interested. Instead, Steve was magnetic that night, filling up the spaces between them with thoughtful motions seeking permission in every tiny move. It was hot as hell for Tony.
Tony gulps at the thought of Natasha whipping out a knife hidden on her garter belt and tossing it in his direction for delaying her big day. Noticing colour also draining from Steve's face, Tony looks at the Sorceror Supreme.
Steve shrugs. "I probably have some tricks left up my sleeve. The lumberjack life is not as simple as people paint it to be, it's a hardcore, continous workout. I'm out of practise but I can still pack a punch or two."
“Right, okay, Wong's, Wong's uh good with Petey right? Peter's in good hands.. Oh fuuuuuck, babe do you want to take this to our room?" Tony asks, glancing over his shoulder to get a clearer reading of the situation. What he sees is Steven Stark-Rogers kneeling behind him, two seconds away from eating his ass.
The otherwise calm and collected Captain America once choked on his toast at breakfast when Wanda cautiously whispered to the table that
up to the helipad to take a crack at it. Tony Stark was a known whiskey man. So the fact that he grabbed the exact type of beer that Steve had been drinking all night and extended the invitation to nobody else, well, Steve has spent enough time around the futurist to tell that Tony was making a move.
“She won’t let me take her temp, not even orally.” Tony sighs a little hopelessly where he is stood in the hallway outside of Wanda’s room. He speaks quietly so that the girl will not hear him, but with all the coughing he is sure that she cannot hear much else. Tony passes the thermometer over to his husband with a pleading look. “Can you sweet talk her into it?”
“Su’pise?” Peter asks curiously, but clings onto Steve’s side just to be sure nothing scary is happening.
“Yeah?” Steve smiles at him at first, then furrows his brow. “What’s wrong?” He wonders if Tony noticed something off with Peter that he missed. “Is everything okay?” He also tries to whisper so as not to wake them up.
The bed dipped as Tony noticed that he was awake, and moved to plant a long, soft kiss on top of his tussled golden crown. Steve felt his chest being ripped apart. Tony was so delicate with him, gentle, protective, even when he was larger than this man was, stronger, heavier. He remembers damaging that same man, leaving him bloodied in an abandoned bunker in a blizzard.
He takes a big gulp of the pipping hot beverage, regrets it, but chugs it down his throat anyway. The burn and caffeine eases the panic in his brain momentarily.
“If I knew you tasted this good I wouldn't have bothered with the takeout. You got any more moves, Rogers?”
“Come on, Stark,” Tony hissed, angry himself for always losing to his fragile mind, which ironically happened to be his strongest, favourite trait of himself.
, off my hundreds and hundreds year old furniture without damaging them. Never mind that Steve Rogers also makes it a point to break my stuff as and when he feels like it, which so happens, every time you engage in coitus."
decided to retire from the team, yapping how there won't be anybody left to defend the fucking planet. I'm not an idiot, I'd been talking to some people and doing the ground work. That badass detective, the blind lawyer in the red spandex from Hells Kitchen. And Peter, god I swear I didn't scoop him out of Queens and hauled ass to Germany after a Youtube video marathon - I'd been studying the kid, with the idea of recruiting him when he's older."
As if their brutal fall out was not punishment enough, his mind appears to be hardwired to project image after image, memory after memory of the genius engineer even at the slightest mind drift. It was a reoccurring theme; every smile, every fight, every chance he had
Bucky's eyes were wide; he slowly motions his head to the left, then to the right, then a proper head shake.
“I’ll get them. We’re running behind,” Stephen interrupts, leaving the couple. He stops in his tracks, and takes a last glance at the two men – Tony was now fixing Steve’s tie as the taller man’s hands automatically snakes around his husband’s waist and under the jacket. “It will only take two minutes, I assure you,” the Dr reminds pointedly to Tony, before disappearing upstairs.
Between his own legs, Steve’s cock was rock hard, tenting underneath his loose French linen trousers, eagerly waiting to claim its prize.
Two soon became three, as Steve hungrily demanded for more. His appetite was insatiable as Steve moaned and moaned and
"It's not survivor's guilt, at least not to me. I'm a soldier, we took an oath, Sam. For as long as I am Captain America, I have a
The two former teammates had stepped out to the patio, where the swinging bench hung. It was dark, the air cool with the moonlight above them. Yet there was unspoken tension.
"Tony. Hi. What are you - When did you.... You're here." Steve was nervously tripping over his words but he manages to take a quick glance over his shoulder. His sentences were left unfinished, but from his body language, Tony could read him loud and clear. As if their relationship wasn't already a clusterfuck of unresolved issues, the situation they were finding themselves in was less than ideal.
to know about the epic showdown between Iron Man and Captain America; the world at large sure didn't. In fact, Tony had never intended the teenager to witness what he did exactly three weeks ago that gave it all away.
, because Steve, beneath his tough and hard exterior, appeared to be naturally pliant and submissive in bed.
Steve howls, losing himself in pleasure because he has always, always loved his broad chest. It's one of the features he genuinely appreciated about his new body and he would show off his curves whenever he could. Those tight t-shirts? Entirely planned. He knows
Steve couldn't remember the last time he saw the master assassin smile this widely, relaxed. At ease.
. As Sam fumbles to return it, the toy drops out of the mould that held it in the box and onto his lap, out came with it a note that hid beneath the mould.
An angel, whose heart was broken because Steve's pride was in the way of admitting that he felt the same way.
“Help me out here Sam," Steve pleads. "He’s finally coming home tonight and I don’t know what to do."
"Then you should really be nicer to Strange. Maybe he'll pull a spell or two for us more often than just for our anniversary night. You can fuck me without worrying about waking Peter and the entire town 10 miles away."
” Tony chants erotically, applying the slightest bit of pressure against Steve's head wedged between his ass cheeks with his tongue jabbing Tony's hole over and over. As his knees weaken, Tony's hardened cock twitches and heavily hangs between his thighs, steadily leaking precome onto their silk sheets. The occasional friction he gets when the tip of his dick touches the surface of the bed, on top the fantastic rim job he was receiving, was driving him crazy.
Tony quickly sniffles, refusing to allow himself to dwell  too much in melancholy because the Winter Soldier, Steve's best
“You can’t Dare me if we weren’t even playing Truth or Dare to begin with,” Steve points out, feeling clever.
Tony chuckles, and he falls flat on his back onto the bed. Pepper follows suit, and they stare at the ceiling together like teenagers hopefully dreaming of a far away future.
"My point is, you two need to talk. He needs to explain to you about why he lied, about when exactly did he know about Barnes, you know? It makes a difference. And if you're going to moan and cry about Cap not taking a second to sit and talk feelings, Tony, you're going to have put your billions where your mouth is. Cap's not all that different from you. You both are so emotionally handicapped you complement each other like a house on fire."
Pantry supplies had mostly run out two days ago, but because it was Christmas and stores were extremely busy on boxing day, grocery shopping was put on hold for a bit. It was half an hour before closing time and Steve had been ready to go for a while now. If only a certain someone could get his act together and get a move on.
"I've been reading about anxiety and ways to deal with it and I came across this really cool calming gif the other day. I wanted to send it to you because it's a cat gif and you like cats and all you gotta do is match your breathing with the cat swaying when it feels like too much," Peter cooly rolls his shoulders and swings from side to side, describing. "But then Aunt May barges in and started screaming about my room and threatened to burn the Spider-Man suit if I didn't clean the mess so I totally forgot about this -"
who he lied to and fought Tony for, was also in Wakanda. Tony has known all along that the technologically advanced African nation had custody of the assassin and with Princess Shuri leading the effort to treat and remove HYDRA's brainwash, a cure was imminent. Bucky Barnes, though frozen solid, was well on his way to a full recovery.
Sam hooks his arms behind his neck and leans against the armrest, facing Steve. "So you came back to DC."
, the room wasn't spinning as fast and he no longer felt like puking the sandwich he ate couple of hours ago out on his shoes.
Steve rises to his feet, his linen pants were crumpled and a clear wet spot had formed where his bulging erection was painfully hidden. Steve draws the strings loose and his pants fell and was quickly kicked away. “Let him hear you Daddy. I want him to know who you belong to. Who’s cock you love having in your ass.”
, goes way back before Germany. See Cap and I -" Tony starts slowly, waving his hands in a tumble, suddenly a lump in his throat.
- and he wasn't even slighted by Tony's continuous bad mood and snarky clapbacks. Tony scratches his forehead before he tries to explain himself again, but it then hit him that he wasn't overwhelmed anymore. He was breathing
"The girls in my high school are so gonna be disappointed though. Captain America's is still pretty popular these days especially with the girls. Now that he's gone rogue his posters keep getting stolen and they always end up in the girl's locker -," Peter says, a light chuckle in his voice before he shuts his mouth audibly, noticing Tony's horrified expression. "Not that I'm going to say anything to anyone, I swear!" he immediately clarifies, eyes wide.
Bucky cocks an eyebrow up, bemused. "Obviously," Bucky says, eyeing the flowers then at Steve who has suddenly taken a huge interest on the patterns on the floor. "Who's that for?"
meet him? Is he insane?" Pepper spouts in disbelief. "Where?" She asks, despite genuinely annoyed at the stupidity of the request.
He was embarrassed enough that so many people have given him shit for That Kiss. Now Tony too? Unacceptable.
Tony had made the Bartons his first order of business straight out of the hospital, post-Siberia. When he arrived at the farmhouse, black eyed, bruised and heavily bandaged on the chest, he hesitated at the door step. Maybe he should have taken an armour for this conversation, he thought, as he wasn't sure he would be welcomed. The family patriarch was now an international criminal serving time in a top level security underwater raft in the middle of the ocean, thanks to mess he and the Avengers collectively made.
answers," the spy says, catching the eye of Sam Wilson and jerking her head to him for participation. "Let's talk feelings."
The Avengers who survived the initial dusting and eventually the final battle- Natasha, Clint, Bruce, even Thor who remained on a Earth with nowhere else to return to - they themselves never fully recovered from the trauma either. Even when Laura reappeared with Lila with zero recollection of having disappeared before Clint’s eyes, when TChalla went back to his throne to help rebuild Wakanda and the rest of the healing world.. it was never the same.
“It’s from Uncle Rhodey, Petey” he says, handing his son the goods. Peter turns to his Daddy and excitedly waves the parcel with both hands.
Tony tries hard not to smile. They adopted the world’s cutest kid, for sure. “Well neither do I, Spud, but I eat them anyway because Pops tells me to. Trust me you don’t want to argue with your Papa on these sorts of things. Take it from me - it never ends well,” Tony says, stealing a glance at Steve, who frowns and widens his eyes in silent protest. Tony suppresses a smile as he continues with his Dad voice, “Besides, broccoli is ...
Later that same day, Sam caught Steve balancing a laptop on his knees and venturing onto the internet all by himself looking up for gifts for his boyfriend, one tab even said Customized Coffee Mugs (Romantic). Of course Steve comedically shut the screen of the computer like a teenager caught watching porn the second his super senses picked up Sam watching him.
"If we're late can't you just sling ring us there?" Tony asks, wrapping a scarf over himself without looking.
Pepper Potts was wearing a black STARK INDUSTRIES hoodie and pyjama shorts, crossing her slender legs on his California King bed, waiting for him.
“Noon,” Steve continues, as his eyes hungrily mapping Tony’s body while his hands ghosts over the covers that was hiding Tony's tenting erection. He slowly rubs the tip of the bulge, wresting a groan from Tony. “De-brief is at 10 though..”
Tony loved it when he begged, praising him every time he gasped and whimpered, encouraging him that Steve's moans was music to his ears. Before long, Tony had guided Steve to the sofa and led him to sit, kneeing Steve’s legs to spread open. Finally,
?” Tony halts, and places the chef's knife he was using onto the wooden chopping board and relaxes into the broad chest pressing against his back.
"Something I want happening again? Yes." Tony answers too quickly without allowing himself to think. It did not achieve the effect he was hoping for, as Steve continues to stare at him in earnest and only then did it click to Tony. "Rogers, after we're done playing superheroes and capes in Sokovia, you and I are going to dinner, a proper one with tables, food on plates and with clothes on. We'll have a talk about this," he says, motioning the space between them, "with
“Work with me here buddy. Peter's the ring bearer, poor kid's really excited about it. Please? We can't afford to be late for this.”
A portal was conjured right by their bedside and they were face to face with Bucky Barnes palming his eyes with both his flesh and metal hands, Dr Stephen Strange standing next to him with the most unimpressed expression on his face and Wong chuckling in the background, hands tucked across his chest, unperturbed by the sight.
"We've got 5 hours to go, Rogers. Come on. I think we've suffered enough of your sulking. Pretty sure we've earned points to redeem
"Are you going to be alright?" She insists as she flattens the lapels of his jacket, picking off lint at the edges. Her hands were shaking.
“Ohhhh baby you want that ass baby? You wanna – AH YES – baby right right there. Stevie honey forget what I said earlier, I need you to fuck me right now. I want your cock so so badly baby fuck fuck fuck me right here please.”
part now? We can do that," Tony said, suddenly pulling back, faking confusion. All while his hands continued to massaged Steve's firm ass, gliding one finger between the cheeks and over Steve's entrance.
It was his ultimate kink and Tony was still finger-fucking him, grazing him in all the right spots. In that moment, Steve was resigned to his fate. Tony Stark was going to be the death of him. Steve didn't mind death if it felt this good.
Steve sits straight, still firmly holding the gadget. “There were two of us against him," Steve says, continuing in his head,
After a moment or two, once Sam had stepped inside, Steve was still fiddling the phone between his fingers.
"Clint. Did you even think it through when you agreed to bust Wanda out of the Compound? Did you even stop to think about WHY you were throwing punches at Natasha, your child's
Despite the fall of the mighty Thanos, a lot remained lost. Many carried wounds that bled for a lifetime.
In a last ditch effort, Tony traces his finger along the silver necklace around his neck and fishes out the two aluminium plates that hung from it.
"You either spend days without leaving your lab - the nanites, Jim's braces, the kid's suit - or you disappear to the farm. If we're lucky we'll catch a glimpse of you on TV appearing in Capitol Hill, or at the CIA. Or the United Nations. But you've shut us out, Tony and Jim thinks it's his fault you're like this and -" Pepper bites her lips, looks up to try not to cry - "he needs more than legs right now, Tony. He needs you, you have us. Don't shut us out. Talk to me," Pepper pleads, her eyes filling up again as she holds Tony's face.
Bucky snorts. "God you guys got together like, two hours ago and you're already meddling with each other's problems?"
Sometimes he wishes he wasn’t obsessed with the person on the other side of the call button. That he could find peace by destroying the phone and never having to look at it ever again.
He wishes the earth would just swallow him whole, and maybe take Clint with him for springing this out on him. Laura seems to be the forgiving kind anyway.
Tony drags a breath in through his teeth before he burst into a light chuckle. "No. But thank you. For the support. I feel absolutely supported," Tony says, slapping his chest in mock-gratefulness. Peter twists his mouth in annoyance but doesn't retaliate as Tony starts to break into a laugh.
There was too much at stake for him to fail at a grand scale. But as he cautiously gazes to his left, internally worrying that any movement or thought might break the status quo of the early morning, Tony swallowed.
It was not exactly a mystery that there was nothing professional or platonic about the relationship that broke down between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. The amount of brooding Steve was doing and the facial hair he was allowing to grow to a point he was barely recognisable screamed volumes that the whole fight affected Steve only in a way it would hurt a lover mourning the loss of a sweetheart.
And yet the device he held in his hand, the obsolete piece of technology much like his being, kept close to his person at all times, remained silent. The countless moments he thought the phone had been switched off, under-charged,
Tony leans into Steve's hand, as he holds it against his cheek. "And what about you? You're going to supersoldier your way to safety once Peter and I are out of harm's way?"
"Tony I understand if you don't want to see me at all. I know that we've created a problem bigger than our own but right now I need,
It was probably the beer that makes Tony falter his balance. He falls against Steve, bumping the bottle in the soldier's hand and causing it spilling all over Steve's navy buttoned top. Tony's own bottle lands on the ground and the sharp clink startles them. Tony reacts to the accident by laughing into Steve’s chest, exactly on the wet spot that he's caused.
Before this, Tony had always felt threatened by his presence. From the day Steve told him that Bucky was alive, and that he
They didn’t talk much for the rest of the night, unless 1) Tony providing encouragement out of pleasure the whole time Steve had his cock in his mouth sucking and lavishing the taste of Tony, or 2) Steve moaning Tony’s name over and over again as he rode Tony to both their orgasms, was considered a conversation.
The abrupt onset of overwhelming emotions means that he was at the brink of having yet another massive his panic attack.
Steve's mouth remains open. “Let me understand this right. I have a reputation for being a terrible kisser?”
"I'll get it. But hurry up in there," Steve says, throwing his voice as he gets the door without peeking to see who it was. For all he cares, this was a cause for further delay.
"He threw it all away Clint. The long and short of it all, is Steve Rogers had tunnel vision the moment he knew Barnes was alive. Everything we stood for, the peace we fought to protect didn't deserve a second thought or a fucking table discussion. It started and ended with Bucky
Wrapping his waist with the towel, Tony heads to the toilet before he joins Bucky at the kitchen. The soldier hands him a mug of coffee with his metal hand. Tony couldn't help but marvel at the sight of the shiny steel, his brain already thinking of ways to take it apart, reassemble it, maybe weaponise it, put it back together. He was such a inventor he sees possibilities in everything.
Sinking to his knees and nestling his nose into Steve's pubic hair, the sexy brunette inhaled the scent of his younger lover as he hoisted one of Steve's legs over his shoulders. Without warning, Tony swallowed Steve's cock head down its length and pulled his mouth painfully slow, giving Steve's cock a long hard suck that left the super soldier moaning loudly.
Shuri giggles. "As long as he isn't damaged, I'm sure I'll like him just fine. Does he have SnapChat?"
The day Steve turned up at the Tower three weeks after SHIELD had fallen, with a duffel bag over his broad shoulder, a stupidly handsome smile and with an acceptance (finally!) of Tony's offer to move into the apartment Tony had built for him couple of years prior, Tony was smitten. Newly singled at the time, he wasn't even sure what that whirl in his belly was when he saw Steve that day. He dated women only in the past. He'd notice men too, but not like this.
They were not expecting a huge crowd, by Tony's standards, but invitations were nonetheless sent out to some army veterans, and their closest friends were expected to attend. On his part, Steve had invited the Falcon.
, but he didn't want to get chided) and Steve's concerns about hurting Tony if they ever switch roles, given his super strength and ahem, size. It didn't necessarily translate that he didn't want Tony that way, evident by his body language and the way he licks his lips whenever he spoke about Tony in any non-professional context.
"He's everything you've read in the history books about, basically. The internet's crazy though, don't go there," Tony adds.
“They are,” Steve says. “Bucky didn’t really say much over the phone. He said they were still okay, were scheduled to be in Switzerland actually, but some jackass wrote a stupid article about the Winter Soldier and that garbage gained a lot of buzz. People behind tall chairs have now politely 'encouraged' Bucky sit this service out to avoid further bad press. Bullshit politics if you ask me, Bucky's mad as hell. That, the busted proposal and Nat taking the jet to the UN without him... he just needs some time off I guess. Hence the couch.”
Tony wasn't heavy but his weight was completely pressed against Steve's lower half, one leg was actually resting on top of Steve's shin. When the billionaire seemingly lays there motionless for a good 30 seconds, Steve pokes Tony's cheek to check if he's passed out, but Tony swats his hand away affectionately. Steve bites his lips to stop himself from smiling too much, aware that if his eyes have well adjusted to the darkness, so would Tony's.
“Oh come on,” Tony whines, throwing his voice and turning away dramatically. But he recovers quickly, dropping his face close,
"Steve is kind, honourable, really smart guy. Jesus kid, everybody loves Captain America. You would too."
"Barton as much as I love amusing you, this stupid phone?" Tony flicks out the tiny clamshell from his jeans pocket, to no surprise of Clint, and waves it. "I know the song, I know it goes
“So I’ve heard." He tilts his head to consider before he makes a pained reaction. "... and maybe sort of watched.”
"All things considered, whatever you saw or heard that day, I'm glad it didn't end up on Twitter or Youtube. Facebook. Not that I don't trust you, I do. Plus I know where you live, so that's that. Anyway look - the thing is. A lot went down even before the airport and I’m not specifically talking about Siberia, or the Sokovia Accords. They teach you about the Accords in school right? You're what, 15?"
"Mmhmm," Tony responds before he opens his eyes again to look into Steve's. He bends forward towards Steve and holds himself up with a hand while his other shuffles his pants off. Steve mourns the brief loss of physical intimacy (he was
Despite his continuous accusations, deep down Tony has come to accept that Bucky was stripped off his humanity against his will to do HYDRA's bidding, to commit the decades-long assassinations including the cold blooded murder of his parents. Instead of hatred for Barnes, Tony came back from Siberia carrying with him a deep sense of guilt for going off on the man for actions he had no control over, and then blowing his metal arm apart.
Tony took a step into Steve. He tried really hard to hold himself from reaching out to touch his former lover, but he knew he had given up that right. "I came here, because I don't want you to make a mistake. I'm here but I can't fix it if---"
Maybe because tonight something finally felt right, when everything was going 200km in the wrong direction.
"Don't worry, sweetheart. Nobody's home," he whispers as he licks into Tony's ear, sending a shiver down Tony's spine.
“We wouldn’t have gone this far without you Tony. Thank you. For bringing the team together and making the missions possible.” Steve said, meeting Tony's large brown eyes. “You even gave us all a home.”
"OH YOU HAD TO GO THERE, TONES," Rhodey yells out of nowhere. A hearty, booming laugh follows suit, and Tony could tell it was Thor. He got even more confused as he makes out Nat's voice in the background and a few other people having a conversation - Bruce? Clint? Tony maps out the background and recognises that they were in the Sanctum. Tony finally sits up, paying more attention to the situation.
"Okay, fair enough. But darling, we're having a picnic under the stars, we're overlooking this gorgeous city on the first day of the year and I'm 2 seconds away from -" Tony thumbs over the waistband of Steve's briefs and tugs it over his cock to free the man, "- oh Steve look at you. Jesus you're so wet for me," Tony says, losing his train of thought at the sight of Steve's length, drenched with precome.
be selfish and neglect my responsibilities again and joining SHIELD was one way I could help prevent something like this from happening again. The world needs Captain America more urgently than Steve Rogers needed to learn how to use a cellphone. Besides, coming back brought me closer to Tony in a lot of ways, because when I found out he had survived the entire ordeal, I kind of made sure he got my message."
The irony of that encouragement was also not lost, given the scar that draped from collarbone across his chest and down his ribcage stood as bitter evidence of what the man could
Judging by the intensity of Tony's frotting, the man was clearly getting off of this. He was so close. So was Steve. He starts to kiss his way down Tony's neck to his collarbone. Taking a nipple in his mouth, he sucks long enough that Tony curses a string of words then begs him to keep going. Steve was a multitasker after all. His hand continues to pump them to the best he could while he suckled on Tony like a babe, milking the man off his sanity.
" call, whether intentional or not, Steve strolled out of his room to greet his man in only a white towel and nothing else.
Tony snaps his eyes shut, rubbing his forehead with his thumb and middle finger, hoping the friction would soothe his nerves from giving his precious brain an aneurysm.
"A mutual. Nothing to worry about - he ran off to space for three years after she poured her heart out to him. It could partly be the reason why she's holding her cards close to her chest on you, Barnes."
"Yup," Bucky confirms. "Think you know by now he's not all that innocent. Don't let that blush fool you, the piece of shit."
Since the present Tony Stark no longer lived in the city where AIs handled and governed the household, i.e starting the coffee at their wake or controlling the temperature to their comfort and liking, his current living quarters would require a small effort on Tony’s part to get the day going.
Tony remembers a Patek Phillipe pocket watch, his Starkphone, maybe couple of hundred Euros but he says nothing. He had bigger concerns. He needed to get 220lbs of muscle off of him because he was slowly losing the feel of his legs.
“God no,” Tony snaps, flinching hard at the sudden unwelcomed proximity but he immediately regrets the way it rolled off his tongue. "Sorry I don't, I'm not into touching. Nothing personal though." Peter retracts his offer without taking any offence and takes two steps backwards. He momentarily pauses before he whips out his mobile phone - a Starkphone that Tony had made for him - and starts to type something, his tongue licking the corners of his mouth.
17 hours later, as the three former Avengers sat quietly in a freight train in the dead of night en route to a safe house, battle bruised and down-timing, the nomadic soldier softly hit the back of his head against the trunk he was leaning on in a steady rhythm, resorting to physical methods to drown the audio and visuals in his head.
He presses the back of his hand against mouth to suppress a yawn. When he tries to move, there was a solid weight over him pressing his body down. Tony properly blinks awake and looks down his bare chest to see blond, mussed hair laying atop of him.
Tony says nothing at first, considering in his head that they could be talking about the Black Panther’s sidekick, who knows. But curiosity got the best of him and his heart starts to pump at the possibility that...
The war tore lives apart, and the triumph appeared to have brought back together broken pieces of mankind in jape.
"Gosh the two of you as a couple? Yeeesh that gives me the heeby-jeebies. I always joked about the two of you being Mom and Dad. I guess Nat owes me money."
"Thanks to his eternal yet misplaced hatred towards me, I now have to agonizingly figure out how to safely get his supersoldier spunk,
“Don’t pretend you don’t know why he’s pissy.” Tony says, tugging at the tie and knotting it all over again. Steve presses his lips together into an unapologetic smile as he gazes at his husband’s face, enamoured by how beautiful the man before him was. “Yeah you’re smug now; wait til he sends one of us to another realm for constantly jizzing all over his magical relics.”

have unlocked an achievement that he should not have. When he first realised that feelings beyond infatuation were in the mix, Tony did the calculations and weighed the options - the odds were not horribly against him, being a man confident in his own skin. But considering this
Tony smiles as he gulps the last bit of his coffee. It was decently brewed, too. Maybe it's not such a bad idea, inviting Bucky Barnes to come home with them. At least the man makes good coffee.
As though his brain was actually thinking out loud, the national icon stirs. Tony’s breathe hitches and he held it in, as the solid back muscles twitched and moved, a sign that his bed partner was rousing from sleep.
Tony, in his bucket hat and excursion bag over his shoulder, didn’t mind playing the boring Dad role that day, while Bucky was the cool Uncle Buck. He tailed the pair closely from behind, besotted by the energy beaming from his child.
-  and if after that, if you can't bring yourself to forgive me, I'll never bring us up again. I'll stay on my side."
, I will ki-" He walks into Tony's view and stops talking the second he realises what was going on, "-
When the new year party had wound down at the Tower, Tony grabbed two sixers and a large throw blanket before he invited casually
Yet by all means, Tony wasn't complaining. There were plenty of upsides sleeping with a super soldier with the sexual appetite of a college student and stamina of a race horse, great fulfilling sex was one of the many. The only downside Tony can ever think of, if he was ever pressed for it, was that said super soldier was had almost zero refractory period and was always ready to go again whilst Tony despite his many gifts and talents, had the biology of an average male.
Peter tries hard to hide the beam in his face, noting the father figure reference but the corners of his mouth curls into a small smile. The troubled billionaire draws in a deep breath, drums his fingers on the table before he reaches for the burner phone and places it on the table between them.
"I'll make you a new one. A better one that doesn't need to be lubed up every time you have an itch to scratch." Tony flashes his signature smile, teasing. "Look, I rather we don't go through that conversation again. But the offer stands without an expiration date. I really hope you make the right choice."
Clint’s head jerks backwards. "Did you mean that literally, as in you think Steve's doing this for love?
“If Hill’s intelligence is right on this, Strucker does have the scepter. We can’t have him creating alien weaponry with it or worse, experimenting on any more civilians for HYDRA’s gain. If it’s another bust, well, this is one less Hydra base to worry about,” Steve said, in his Captain America voice.
"I'm sorry that I've made you feel like you were getting only half of me, Tony. Truth is, you were right. I
Lost in thought, Tony did not realize his breathing had stifled. He had been closing his eyes as he stood by the curtains, facing the large meadow that surrounded the farmhouse. He counts backwards from 100 in his head, finally calms at 79, and opens his eyes to find bright blue eyes blinking at him in earnest.
Tony looks up from his left sleeve, fitting the cuffs into place. He watches Stephen Strange stroll into the kitchen in a navy double-breasted bespoke suit and shiny oxford leather shoes but with a frown across his handsome face. Strange picks up a diced watermelon from a container full of fresh fruits that laid in front of Tony.
Even with super memory, Steve only vaguely remembers a glimpse of Sam stepping out and scrambling back into the elevator, looking horrified.
Tony’s smile drops instantly, the news hitting too close to home for them, more so for him. “You’re kidding,” Tony says in disbelief. Steve winces as he makes eye contact and shakes his head sadly, a strand of his blond locks falling over his forehead. “ You’re
Sam squeezes his forehead with his thumb and middle finger, breathing slowly through his nose. How has this become his life? Sam considered to make a mental note to never hang out with Steve anymore, but pushes away the thought knowing he could never commit. He genuinely liked the man, as painful as he has become lately.
to be controlled. There was a real possibility that during all their heated moments throwing their temper across the room, Steve was having his own inner struggle trying to maintain his composure as the figurehead of their group whilst biting back down his personal kink. He didn't want to be Captain America in close proximity to Tony. Steve wanted Tony to lead, to dominate, to take him in bed. He wanted to feel younger, inferior, to be subjugated, to be at Tony's mercy. Most of all, Steve really wanted Tony to fuck him hard until every cogent thought escaped him.
Pepper punches him light on the arm, and Tony fakes a wince. "I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humour Tony. But this isn't funny."
Bucky squints an eye in pain, and sighs out a laugh. “She said no,” he confirms, nodding. "Not for the same reasons Stevie did, though.” Tony’s eyebrows shot up but before he could respond, a young waitress appears between them to hand over their drinks – two milkshakes and an americano. She gushes sheepishly as she bats her eyelids to Bucky, who smiles his painfully handsome smile back at her. She lets out a musical giggle before she leaves them.
"He's waiting for me in my lab downstairs. Good luck with your meeting, Mr. Stark. I know the Captain is very eager to see you."
"Let's get this show on the road then, Mr. Stark," he whispers, as he starts fucking his husband of five years and lover for most of his life. He drags his hips back and pounds into Tony's ass, hot and clinging to his cock.
for you with that ridiculous old flip phone they helped him buy. Nat tells me he wasted 3 full writing pads trying to write you a letter. He wrote some, tore it, doodled your face, tore that. Wrote some more. He drove her crazy."
Tony reasonably felt warm in his chest. He was happy momentarily, sipping the hot chocolate that Lila had prepared for him ("Don't tell Daddy that I gave you extra marshmellows,Uncle Tony!") when the last conversation he had with Steve before Leipzig crowded his mind without an invitation.
He's waited forever to do this, for the right time and place, to seal the gap, the barriers between them. If only Steve would just be honest with himself, Tony would have kissed him ages ago. Now that Tony knows for sure that he wasn't imagining the attraction between the two hot-headed individuals, this finally feels right.
you talking about, Wilson? Out with it," Nat orders, relaxing into the door frame as she hugs her other knee to her chest. Steve shoots Sam a scowl and shakes his head, begging for silence through his eyes.
He grabs an asscheek impatiently to encourage Steve to get on with it, but Steve swats him away with a slight groan.
“”S comfortable, youdon'tknowwhatyou'retalkingbout,” Tony mumbles with his face pressed against Steve's abs. He suddenly turns to look the man in the eye, resting his chin on Steve. “Okay fine.
"I am very sorry to intrude. Agent Hill was on the line, wishing to speak to Captain Rogers. She has been informed that Captain Rogers is currently
The delivery man, clearly not recognizing Captain America right in front of him, says, “Beg your pardon?”
make an honest effort to reign that man in, and not copulate in every corner of the Sanctum? I can hear you
"You listen to me Anthony Edward Stark," Pepper warns. "You are one of the greatest minds of this generation. You are beyond smart, you are very handsome and you happen to be my ex-boyfriend too, so stop selling yourself short with all this self-loathing. You understand?"
The grinding against Tony's ass that started off slow and lazy began to intensify as Tony starts to recognise a familiar length hardening behind him. His neck, initially peppered with soft hot kisses was now receiving long, wet licks from a tongue Tony was very well acquainted to. The licks alternated between light nibbling and suction, evidence of Steve's growing arousal. Through his peripheral vision, Tony watches as Steve deposits a travel-sized bottle of lube on the kitchen counter, while his other hand creeps down Tony's pants.
"Did I strike the lottery?" Tony chuckles, rubbing their clothed erections together. Steve's briefs were soaking
"I want you," the super soldier hums as he sucks on a new spot along Tony's jawline. "I've thought about you, Tony, I've touched myself thinking about you. Hell, Bucky's sick of telling me to keep it down, the neighbours know, pretty sure the whole street knows how much I want you."
The moment the door clicks shut, Steve flips the card to read what it says and he breaks into a wide grin.
Steve was hunched on a seat in full tactical gear, sitting under the full moon, intending to observe the streets. He and Sam were waiting to rendezvous with Natasha in a small safe house in a town just off the main road heading to Beirut.
rude so this is a shocking way of starting the new year - anyway, where was I? Right. I now get to Dare you,” Tony says, slurring between his words.
But out of nowhere, a loud rattling pierces through the night and Steve's steady rhythm falters a little as his head jerks up to the sound. He quickly sources it, his eyes darting to the second drawer of their mahogany nightstand.
"You're not so bad yourself, Barnes. I know we started off on pretty shitty circumstances. The first time I spoke to you was 5 years after the dusting. Before that, all I wanted to do was scream at you," Tony admits.
about. He had been wondering when Steve was going to pull a stunt like this since they arrived yesterday morning.
Sam also remembers watching Steve fidget in his seat when Thor got a little handsy with Tony the night before he left to travel the Nine realms. It was a full house event; even Clint made an appearance that evening so it quickly became some sort of a going-away party for both Hawkeye and Thor. The God of Thunder ended up on the karaoke machine most of the night, getting all the words wrong but handling the mic like a champ no less. Tony was the next mic hogger unsurprisingly, but unlike Thor, Tony could actually sing very,
Not even Pepper and Rhodey knew they were ever involved, so whilst it was apparent that Tony came back from Siberia a worse-off, broken man, none of them had any idea that there was also a tragic love story behind it all.
"She's ..." Tony starts, but shakes his head. He clasps his hands to his mouth, grinning into it as he finally breaks into a teary happy laugh. "Steve, she's here. Our baby's finally here. Fuck we're gonna be parents to a newborn baby. Oh man. Peter's gonna freak out!"
Communication, or the lack of, had always been the pitfall of their relationship. They talked to each other a lot, in fact they spent a healthy amount of time dancing around one other to the frustration of everyone. Most of their conversations unfortunately were of them trading barbs and disagreeing, yelling on top of their lungs until one of them storms away or breaks something (RIP log of wood). On better days, Steve and Tony would steal glances across the room and seemed to read the other person’s mind in a disgustingly cute way.
“Tony, I can go if you want,” Steve says, breaking into Tony’s monologue. Steve begins to rise, forming a cave between his perfectly sculptured body and the bed. Tony could not resist taking a peek.
Because Steve knows for a fact that Tony does not have a belly. The man wasn't crazily toned, but Tony regularly works out with the team to keeps himself in shape. And
The lights. The sounds. The smell of popcorn and hotdogs and caramelised apples filled the air. The carnival was everything Peter had been looking forward to.
"Buck, hang on, your scarf's in the closet," Steve calls out, already retreating to grab the knob. Tony was dying to make a joke about the Winter Soldier needing a scarf to keep warm, but decides that maybe it was too soon.
“Let me put Peter to bed,” Steve says, breaking the mini makeout session. “And then, Mr. Stark, you and I have got some unfinished business to attend to.”
In the beginning, Steve would blush and squirm and tried his darnest best to avoid the topic altogether whenever Sam teased him on it, preferring to forget the scene of Sam walking in on Tony in all his naked glory folding Steve in half, thrusting his hips hard to the rhythm of Steve whimpering and begging for
Peter has a hard frown on his face now, his lips pressed to a thin line. He opens his mouth, and shut its. He tries again. "You just said that Cap and you..." Tony nods his head firmly. "But you weren't...?" The genius shakes his head, a smile forming in his face now as he licks his lower lip.
For example, beneath all his flamboyance and boisterous personality, Steve noticed that Tony had a quirk when it came to personal space. Unless he was the one initiating the contact, he would recoil at the slightest touch. Possibly an extension of his utter dislike to being handed anything, Tony once force-coughed so loudly to avoid an older woman’s embrace at a charity gala that Steve turned red trying to suppress a laugh.
“This is your chance to do it over," Tony says, pointing his finger square in Steve's chest, poking it accusingly. "Your reputation depends on it!" he exclaims loudly.
Tony sinks into the embrace, holding her firmly as he rubs the small of her back. She sobs into the crook of his neck and breathes a sigh of relief. After a moment, she peels away and wipes her tear-stricken face with one hand before bursting into a small giggle. They were still holding on to each other.
written with nothing else. He wasn't above admitting that he may likely be emotionally crippled; he couldn’t even bring himself to pen his thoughts in a personal letter apologizing for his wrongdoings to a man who owned his heart, and whose heart he had broken.
Without warning, Steve's head warps out of the freight train and into the Avengers Tower, 18 months ago.
"I know, Tony. We've been over this. I'm 100% in love with our baby the day we heard her heartbeat. She may not have my blood, and she may even be enhanced given that her surrogate can literally fly, read minds and lift buildings. There is nothing conventional about this but I love you Tony, and I'm with you."
Tony instinctively rubs his chest over his shirt, feeling the dip of the scar. "Now he wants to talk. After Barnes decided to hop into the freezer again."
"So how was Christmas at Rhodey's?" Steve asks, breaking the silence. He sinks into the recliner opposite of Tony. It's Bucky's favourite chair in the entire apartment.
“I wanna talk to you about something. About why I've been cancelling out on you a lot these days, why I've been disappearing without so much as a phone call. And uh, mainly about
“You okay there, Mr. Stark?” Peter asks in the tiniest voice, almost mouse-like. "Anything I can do?" The young man smiles weakly with his teeth, a knee-jerk attempt to cheer up his mentor.
getting hot, and Tony wishes he had worn something less restrictive. His jeans were too heavy for spring time, and out here in the middle of nowehere the air could get thick and humid.
of you." Steve guides Tony's right hand against his erection and Tony actually breaks the kiss to gasp. As though he actually needed the visual confirmation, Tony presses his forehead against Steve's collarbone to peek. Steve was hard as a rock, and
The delivery man had walked out of the van, clutching a package. Tony recognizes the old man from somewhere ---
In a split second, they're eye to eye again. "I'm only asking because I don't want to force you into anything you're not entirely comfortable with. I want us to be on the same page. I'm happy to work on your pace. I want you to be happy," Tony emphasises on the last few words.
Steve easily flings himself over the couch and lands next to Sam, clutching a brown leather box in his hand, worry dripping down his unbearably handsome face. He stares at Sam in silence, blinking his puppy dog eyes, blue and round as marble, short of begging for attention from his good friend.
Peter laughs, rubs his nose a little. "That's so weird. You're old enough to be my dad. Can't. Won't do it."
can help you with that,” Tony adds quickly, tilting his head matter of factly, like a car salesman about to make his winning pitch. The combination of Tony's wild hair, exposed chest with three buttons undone and his pants opened that way – oh, Steve can feel himself giving into temptation.
This wasn’t New York. This wasn’t Malibu. There were no bad guys attacking their family home, or, god forbid, his son. Tony no longer walked around with nanites in his chest reactor nor did he need Friday guarding the perimeters of his property for incoming missiles.
Peter blinks and smiles robotically, hands drawn out and taking a step forward. "Maybe you'll feel better?"
“I want you to know I support you, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, refocusing the topic with a serious look on his face.
They rest their foreheads on each other, eyes closed, breathing into shared air and Tony feels his heart beat faster, but for a good reason this time. Steve was here now, and his presence next to Tony had chased away the painful memories that made its way into Tony’s mind that morning. He instantly feels heaps better, and draws out a long breathe before opening his eyes.
He collapses on the floor, white as a ghost. All he wants to do is run away from his own stifling body, but he couldn't.
think about it, she didn’t exactly say no. She just doesn’t see a point of it all, getting hitched. Given our lifestyle. What we do. She says she’s happy, she loves me, she’ll consider us adopting one day if that’s what we both want but marriage is-“
"Could have saved us all the trauma if you'd just answer the damn phone." Stephen says, patting Bucky on his metal shoulder. The former assassin had fully turned his back against the husbands, still clearly traumatised for having witness his best friends in a state of coupling.
Steve cheeks turns hot against Tony's skin within seconds and he could only muster a small "Yes", as words in his head didn't seem to want to cooperate to form a proper sentence.
"Can I get you something to drink?" Steve offers as he folds Tony's coat over his forearm, tapping his hands against it to calm his building nerves and curiosity.
Steve just melts against him, kissing back reverently like a man thirsting for life. He lifts Tony up onto his lap for better access to the man he's been craving for. The kisses were deep, languid and sweet, exactly how they both imagined it would be. When Tony pulls back for air, he couldn't help but gush at the way Steve chased him for more. He leans his forehead against Steve's.
Once outside, the shaking started. Steve continued downstairs anyway, gathering the rest of his clothes, then opened endless doors until he found a guest room with a working shower. Under the running water he thought he could cry, but instead he found himself staring blankly at the wall, his eyes following the pattern of the tiles, his fingers twitching at his side.
Rocket shrugged. “I’d advise watching from a safe distance, something like the next solar system. But what choice do we have?”
It had to be too much pressure for just one man, yet Tony was coping, he thought. Just about. So long as Steve was there. There were cracks, sometimes. Like when Nebula finished work on the
At some point they had rolled so Tony was now on top; he sat up, his resolve nearly breaking when Steve literally whined and reached as if to draw Tony down to his mouth again. “Easy,” he whispered, grabbing the man’s outstretched hand and pressing kisses over his knuckles. Then he slid a finger under the waistband of Steve’s pants, inhaling sharply when the other man bucked his hips in helpless, clumsy reflex.
, all adding up to a soul more raw and wild than anything the world would allow. But when the world called for service, Steve answered. Whenever the world demanded a symbol, Steve stepped up. Whatever the cost, whatever the burden. And in six years of working together, Tony had never once heard him complain of what he’d lost-
“I was planning my work for tomorrow, which demanded my total concentration,” Tony declared. He checked his watch. “For three point five hours. With my eyes closed.”
,” she mutters, the word falling like a curse, then turns to face him. “Do you really imagine time to be so fragile, Steve Rogers?”
The Ancient One smirks. “This is the true nature of time, Captain Rogers. All things are possible, therefore all things are.”
The other man sat heavily. “Sure. I mean, technically I’m not allowed to leave yet anyway, so…” He shrugged, as if unaware of how
eyes - had automatically turned to Tony, just in time to see the dart of pure terror cross his face.
Wrong. Gone. He gritted his teeth, trying to slow the loop. “I… I don’t…” Steve looked away to where a vase sat on a high shelf, full of fresh flowers. It had always been empty, before. Before the… When he… they… Gone. Wrong.
“Of course,” the dark-haired woman said. But she gave Tony a hug before leaving. A hug he returned. When the two women had left, Tony pushed a chair close to his side of the glass and sat down.
And Steve’s eyes darkened again, his lips quirking upward, and then - oh my god - the other man was squeezing Tony’s dick through his pants, caressing him with fingers that were anything but shy; this time Tony was the one to whine - out loud, like a
Later, much later, Strange invited Tony for tea and told him all about Peter’s role in Steve’s resurrection. On their return to New York, the kid had been so hopeful that they could save Steve, and equally devastated to learn they were too late. Knowing there was no safe way to undo death with the Time Stone, Strange himself had given up. Only Peter’s stubborn optimism had kept the kid thinking it over, and so it had been all Peter’s idea to try using the Reality Stone alongside the Time Stone to restore Steve’s serum in the past. Tony still had no idea how that could possibly work - he really,
Tony smiles fondly when Wanda begins to babble again and kisses her forehead before continuing with the story. Half way through the chapter, Steve comes to join them.
Damn, why had they not thought of that? Steve must be more stressed than he realises if he is being so dumb and not thinking rationally.
“Hi, sweets, did you have a good day?” Tony asks and Peter nods before his attention is pulled towards the TV with the intro to Paw Patrol starting. The boy scrambles to the blanket on the floor while Tony carefully untangles Wanda from his side and rises with Steve.
“Is okay.” Peter reports and flexes his fingers gently. He brings his arm to his chest again and traces his Daddy’s handwriting on his cast. “I like Stephen. He nice and- and kind.” The boy says with a little smile.
“Sure, sweetheart! That’s a great idea.” Tony agrees. “Do you want me to sign it for you? Or draw some pretty hearts?” He is glad that Peter can take the cast and make it a somewhat fun and positive thing even though he is in pain.
“Of course we’ll be your knights in shining armour. We’ll protect both you and your brother from all the scary things out there.” Tony assures and goes to place Wanda back on her seat. “And Papa’s with Peter now and he’ll protect him, all right? Do you want a banana to munch on while I make the pancakes?” He asks, wanting to distract Wanda from worrying about her brother again.
“Night night.” Peter whispers before promptly falling asleep. Tony smiles softly and brushes Peter’s hair back before planting another kiss on his forehead.
Steve sighed deeply, tired of talking to himself and Tony could feel the soldier ready to hang up the phone. Tony's heart rate spiked, already regretting his last thought.
"I knew what that reactor meant to him. I used that information against him, just like how I selfishly hid the truth about his parents' death."
Tony bit his quivering lower lip and continued to scream internally as his hands began to tremor. To keep the phone from sliding off, he pushed the receiver close to his temple with just two fingers and held the phone far away as possible from his face as though the device would burn right through his skin on contact.
Never mind that he was the Team Leader of Earth's Mightiest Heroes - when it came to Tony and sex, Steve
Tony opens an eye and his vision blurs before he could recognise the ceiling, the walls around him. It was bright outside, way too bright so he covers his eyes with an arm and takes a  deep breath. He was so, so happy to fill his lungs with the glorious rush of freshly brewed coffee and the smell of burnt bacon.
"I'll stay on the wheel," FRIDAY adds hesitantly, "if you don't mind," she finishes, sounding almost worried for an artificial intelligence.
"Jim is an active Avenger. I can understand Ross wanting you to sign the Accords all the same. But why are you
o'clock right now on this side of the world. You guys have 20 seconds to tell us why you're all here and interrupting my husband trying to come in my ass on our anniversary."
His previous birthdays was a yearly affair matching the hype of nationally televised award shows. When he withdrew Stark Industries from the business of mass-producing militarised weaponry - its most lucrative division - his company did not suffer but instead continued to make its billions. Heck, Tony Stark couldn't just fight alongside a Norse god, a supersoldier, two master assassins and a green rage monster to save the world from an alien invasion- he
Despite their explosive and clashing personality, Steve and Tony’s relationship saw the biggest improvement. Of course, on Steve’s part, it was because he was halfway falling in love with their resident genius and benefactor. Steve dedicated most of his time outside missions observing Tony and learning the inventor’s body language and mood swings.
Wanda didn't speak to him for a week after that, and Sam congratulated his Captain for successfully pissing off potentially the most powerful Avenger in the team.
“Hi Tony,” he said, hoping his smile did not betray his jumping heart. He always appreciated spending time alone with Tony, which did not come by often. He couldn’t help but look forward to these moments nonetheless as their private conversations always never, if not rarely ended up in blows.
Steve’s face falls a little, and Tony notices that the blond was also feeling a little awkward and nervous about having
He's almost wished he'd never brought up and made a joke about accidentally walking in on Steve having sex with Tony. At first it was funny and refreshing to see a vulnerable side of Steve he never thought existed. Nowadays outside of work, the lovestruck Captain seemed to have nothing else to talk about
Each time the topic of Tony came up, it triggered an avalanche of guilt. Steve would go over the vivid placards and video replays in his head multiple times, agonising over spilled milk, strategising various approaches to a past delicate heated moment to master all the ways he could have handled the situation between them better. He was hopeful that perhaps one day he would be given the chance to make things right again.
His heart was quickly pounding its way into his ears. His lungs were expanding and collapsing unsteadily, so much so that he immediately summoned the suit and upped the concentration of oxygen to help him breathe. He couldn't even see straight with sweat trickling over his eyelashes.
"Now if only you two behaved like proper adults and not fooled around in the goddamn kitchen, we probably would have made it in time," Stephen groans irately, yet his hand begins to unbutton his jacket. "You
Given his age and the physical damage his body had endured over the course of the years, particularly of recent events, Tony considers himself fortunate that he is still able to satisfy his sexually demanding lover. To compensate human enhancements, Tony was not above being creative and flexible to achieve mutual pleasure. Even if Steve seemed to have a slight exhibitionist streak in him, Tony was always game.
The master tactician carefully weighs the consequences if he leaps and throws himself off the Tower right about now.
Stephen tugs at his sleeve to check the time and looks at Steve. "We’re already late. Aren’t you two witnesses or something?” Stephen reminds, glancing at Tony.
“Ooohhhh,” Tony teases, insinuating. Stephen rolls his eyes at the level of maturity on display. “In all seriousness, I don't believe for a second that Steve actually
“Yeah remind me to never take up your offer to take the guest room of your Tower apartment ever again. There are only so many times a man can experience walking in on a brother, even if it’s just you jerking off to phone sex," Sam says lightly as another wave of redness washes over Steve's smiling cheeks. "Man, you’re making me really hate being single right now,” Sam says, tossing the cushion he had been hugging in Steve's direction in mock-annoyance. "But since we're on the Tony topic and you're not gonna stop talking anytime soon, let me ask you this. Since when?"
In truth, Steve wouldn’t enjoy being around Stark either. Yet perhaps this could be an opportunity to prove that he really was the leader everyone thought him to be. Their last few encounters had gone… less than well. But this time, Steve vowed, he would conduct himself professionally, showing he could be fair and calm and equal to the task of working with anyone.
Barnes shook his head. “He was protecting us both. Without him, I wouldn’t have fought back. It would have been murder.”
, was the thing. Clint and Scott had been allowed to come home to their families, and he was close to pardons for the rest. Peter had been safe. And somewhere in the middle of all of that responsibility, Pepper had decided he was worth marrying, and had proposed. For the first time, every part of his life made sense to him, and it all had been going great, up until a wizard popped out of a portal and ruined his day.
Tony backed away, brutally aware of how useless he was, but unable to stop staring, because what if… Wilson took him by the arm, guided him to sit on a bench a short distance from Steve’s cubicle, still close enough to keep his watch. The new woman, Carol, had been standing at a respectful distance with Hope and Scott, but she approached now. She was no longer glowing, and some distant part of Tony wondered if the effect was something she had to turn off or turn on.
He nodded, and pushed open the door. A week ago he would have leaped at a chance to see Rogers solely to punch him in the teeth, and damn the consequences. Nothing like an apocalypse to gain some perspective. There was no time left for interpersonal drama, no room left for spite or vengeance. Now there was nothing left but the job.
Tony stepped back, brown eyes wide. “No, don’t be sorry, I mean…” He exhaled, pulled a face, then pointed to the bed. “Okay, time out. You, sit.”
Awareness flooded in, bringing scraps of haphazard sensation throughout his aching body. Thanos. The Sanctum.
Like hope itself, Rogers charged out from inside the Sanctum, shield raised to strike Thanos. Tony kept struggling. Something was wrong, but he couldn’t quite-
When Steve failed to react, Tony cleared his throat. “So you’re saying he’ll have to stay in isolation indefinitely?”
,” he managed to say, barely recognizing the thready voice as his own; as if he’d been waiting for Tony to ask, the other man swooped in and pressed hard searing kisses against his stomach, his hipbone, the inside of his thigh. Then- oh sweet holy god in heaven- his cock was in Steve’s mouth and Tony was gone again, was infinite, was fire and life in a thousand directions, but this time he wasn’t lost, wasn’t dying, because every road was leading him back home to Steve’s heat. Steve’s
With a stab of relief, he saw it was Happy’s name on the screen, yet he found himself just staring at the phone, finger hovering over the answer button.
“Yes. Steve. Yes,” he said over and over, promised, prayed; the other man heard; Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, buried his face in his neck and sped up, fucking him without mercy, driving Tony right to his limit. It was again too much, again not enough; beyond thought of resistance, Tony craved more, always more. When Steve’s control finally collapsed into raw frantic thrusts, Tony thrilled to match him, urging him on
“Easy, Cap,” Tony was murmuring in his ear, easily supporting his weight with the armor’s assistance. Always strong. “Let’s just take a minute, then we gotta get to work.”
in his ear encouraging him to take bigger risks, giving him a suit so he can fight bigger crime. But what’s your endgame here, Stark? You gonna offer him a spot on the team? Give him a fancy pen so he can sign away his future to someone like Ross? Or did you even bother to
It should have been an occasion for celebration; they had, after all, successfully acquired the ability to go back and save the universe. Once they had all returned to Wakanda, Shuri had announced their pending salvation to her people and ordered the palace staff to break into the last of the fresh rations for this one night. Tony could hear the revelry going on in the city outside, could appreciate the relief that followed hope.
He wanted to protest, but she cut him off. “No, you need to hear this. After you left me in New York, I went home, I watched the news, and I cried. But then I had a moment where I realized, actually, I was okay. Whenever you leave me behind, I’m sad, I’m angry, but I’m okay. And that’s when I took off my ring, Tony, because I realized, I wanted us to fit together. I wanted you, so much. But I don’t actually
“Fucking moron, he’ll ruin everything,” Tony heard Rocket hiss. He understood the raccoon's distress; if the Stones got damaged then all hope of redemption was lost, but Steve was dying in front of him and it was hard to remember that anything else mattered. For a second Tony considered deploying his suit, then his mind folded away from thinking he could fight this, and he felt a cold calm wash over him.
Steve felt Tony tense beside him, but squeezed his hand in reassurance. This was the job. It had always been the job.
off key,” Steve said, and the man dissolved into a giggle fit so strong he dropped his pencil. Wretched… old wretch of a wretch. Tony tried to pretend he was offended but even he couldn’t keep a straight face.
Back before the Army, he’d spent endless dark days watching others go off to war, trying and failing to find ways to be useful, to
Tony’s inexplicable recklessness in inviting Spider-Man to come train with the official Avengers had put the first serious dent in Steve’s resolve to keep things professional. The fact Tony hadn’t bothered to consult the team and had just shown up with the kid in tow was strike two. But the final straw had been Steve’s discovery that Peter’s secret identity was also concealing such a young age. As Clint described it afterward, Captain America had ‘thoroughly lost his shit’. Loudly. In front of the whole team. But Tony had been equally loud and twice as insulting in return.
A relieved grin lit up Peter’s face. “Oh good! Uh, a nurse just let us know, they finished the surgery and Captain Rogers is being moved to recovery, they had to take out his spleen but they said considering everything, he’s looking really good.”
The other man released his breath all in a rush, his body curling in towards Tony but still hesitant to touch. “Are you sure?”
On the other side of the room, he could hear the New York team also getting organized. Doctor Strange and Wong stood by, here and there commenting on the preparations. Rogers, of course, was legally obliged to stay in the Compound until an imminent threat appeared, as per his parole, but permission should be granted for him to patrol New York without much fuss. Sam had chosen to stick with the Captain, as usual, and from what Tony could overhear, Scott and Hope would also be called in from the west coast. They would need additional air support, but he assumed they would ask Rhodey to fill that role when he got back. Tony made a mental note to brief Peter as well. Since Happy was away, he might as well call the kid himself. Completed protocols or not, Peter knew better than to get involved with any actual battles, but he should be told to keep his eyes and ears open.
When his breathing had settled, Tony pulled back slightly; Steve gazed down at him, patient and sure.
The raccoon peered suspiciously at him. “You sure look like you need my help. But why should I believe you?”
. He’d only kissed Tony because… Steve frowned, mind racing. Because… Tony had just told him they were done, and… it felt like Steve was losing him forever. Like how he’d just lost Peggy, for the second, final time. But the first time, he’d kissed her to say goodbye, so… Somehow, he got his wires crossed.
Thanos was shaking his head. “Too many… people. Finite resources. Collapse… inevitable, unless someone… Someone had to…” He broke off, coughing, and Steve tried to get a grip on his own anger.
“More your thing than mine,” Steve said, then sighed. He really was so tired. “Tony, do you think- could you maybe-”
Caught right on the edge of overwhelmed, Tony found he had to break away for breath, had to turn his head to evade Steve’s feverish kisses, but even then he found no pause, no relief. Instead, he felt the universe tilt sideways again in one inexorable slide, as if he had slipped once more beyond some irresistible precipice, but cast out from familiar perspective, Tony couldn’t put a name to what he was feeling, terror or joy; couldn’t decide whether he wanted to cry or laugh; was torn between wanting this moment to last forever and thinking he might die if he didn’t stop everything right now because how could he let himself have this when he couldn’t possibly survive losing it. Almost, it was too much; almost, he pulled away.
The room wasn’t far; he walked in and stopped. The room was unchanged, the room was changed. Not like the last time. Just like last time.
It’s difficult to go back, even now, but Steve Rogers has one last mission to finish and therefore he goes.
The video played on, approaching its awful conclusion, yet Steve had no eyes left for anything save the shock etched in furrowed lines across Tony’s face. He watched, speechless, as Tony’s expression raced through denial, and reached trembling horror. Waited, breathless, for Tony’s next move, already hating himself for intercepting Tony’s half-hearted step towards Bucky; Tony’s name dropped from his lips like an apology, like a prayer.
“…language,” came a soft voice from beside him. Steve opened his eyes, heart already filled with sunshine. His bed had been moved closer to the window, closer to Tony, his dark eyes serious behind the glass.
She’d quit the Avengers the very same day, declaring herself permanently retired with no explanation, and went no-contact for two whole years. Eventually, she’d sent Steve a Christmas card from the south of France. Her girlfriend ran a bakery, she said, and when they visited, she was happy. They’d sent her the invite without expectation, but Nat had returned for the wedding, gentle baker in tow. As a wedding gift, Nat had given them her story; why she’d disappeared, the emotional journey she’d been on to unravel the Red Room’s lies, her resolve to break their control and reclaim her future by refusing to live as anything of what they tried to make her. She had then offered to be their surrogate, should they ever need one; she knew now she didn’t want to be a mother, even if she had the option, but she wanted to do this much if she could. After an enormous amount of consideration, they’d accepted; two years later, the twins were born. Nat had promptly appointed herself best auntie in the world and insisted they fly her over to babysit whenever needed, yet she was careful to preserve a distance, too. Steve respected this, he really did, but within the privacy of his own mind, she would always be family.
Under that thought, he broke. Sam caught him just in time to lower him to the floor, then Tony was kneeling before him, and Steve buried his face in Tony’s neck and clung tight, trying to hide, his whole body shaking. Hide from the eyes. Always eyes. Watching, needing, seeking, feeding. Even good, even friends. “Easy, Steve, easy,” Tony was whispering, soothing. Always the one holding him together. The only one who might let him fall apart. Broken, wrong, nothing, gone…
“Tony,” Steve panted in his ear, “can I ask you something-” but Tony seized Steve’s face between his hands and kissed him quiet, still. Holy and deep.
“Does this happen a lot?” Bruce asked. He was sitting on the far side of Natasha, and was one of the few people in the room who didn’t seem disgruntled.
But the other man was staring through him now, dead-eyed and trembling. “But Tony, what if…” Steve squeezed his eyes shut, his expression so pained that Tony embraced his bowed head. “I don’t want to ask,” the other man muttered against his shoulder. “It’s not fair.” And Tony did not like the sound of that at all.
“Not lately,” Clint muttered, and privately, Steve had to agree. When Natasha raised an eyebrow, the archer leaned in, sneaking a careful glance at the Wakandan delegation across the room. “Word is he was a hot mess out west, kept dodging the job to jet off with that piece of shit at a moment’s notice.”
“May I?” he asked, breathless. Steve’s eyes held his, lust-dark and open; for one dizzying, chaotic moment Tony felt real but unreal, ready but eternally unready, caught in a fever dream from which he never wanted to wake, but Steve’s nod rang through him like a bell, calling him back to action. Tony grinned back and began sliding down Steve’s pants, moving as slowly as he could bear, but this was revealing new parts of Steve, naked skin he’d definitely never seen before and he was unable to resist licking the muscular crease that arced beneath Steve’s hipbone, because oh
“But we know it’s orange,” Stark said, then shrugged. “Thor’s buddy, Heimdall, who used to run the BiFrost. He has glowing orange eyes, can see any living person’s location anywhere in the galaxy, but Thor has no idea how. Apparently it was a mystery even to Odin.”
Tony regained consciousness slowly, found himself lying flat on his back with a horrendous headache.
Sam is too kind to express it, but there is hurt on his face at what Steve has done, and for that alone, Steve feels a slight sting of regret. He hands Sam the new shield but does not tell him how it was made. It’s part of his agreement with the person who made it, that Steve does not reveal his involvement to a world still mourning his loss.
Rhodey shook his head. “See, he got exposed and you didn’t. So you gotta level it out, man. Tell him how you feel.”
“You promised me you’d fight,” Tony said, and then he was crying because he knew they were out of time, knew how cruel this was, but he had to. He had to. “Captain America can’t start breaking promises now, Steve, I… If you don’t fight you’ll die, you’ll leave me alone, and god, Steve, I can’t lose you again, I need you,
Tony’s whole body twitched; then he nodded, his expression blank. “Wilson went back to the Sanctum to get some rest, but he should be back soon. So I can go, if you-”
“You’re asking me?” The billionaire shook his head, still visibly upset. “You’re the one with a Titan-grade arrow stuck through your shoulder.”
“We're going to win here too, Steve,” the other man protested. “You can’t… Don’t you dare give up now.”
“My brother is not one to easily surrender such power,” Thor speaks up. “And he is even less likely to wield it responsibly. I fear that Earth may yet feel his vengeance.”
