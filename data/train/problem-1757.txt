“Do I owe money to someone I’m unaware exists?” Sherlock asked, his voice somewhat slurred. The man gave him a curious look. “You clearly shoot up regularly, but your clothing suggests you’re a dealer more than a user.” The man nodded, obviously impressed. “I’m assuming heroin, judging by your pupils.”
“It damn well better, because your current attitude’s pissing me off.” He directed his attention towards the camera, or behind it, so it seemed. With a motion of his head, he was tossed a white cloth, which he held up in view of both the camera and Sherlock. “Know what this is?”
John shook his head. “Uh, no.” He reached into his pocket for his wallet, taking out whatever money he had to give to the man. “Thank you,” he said as his mind wandered elsewhere and he gave the cabbie the fare. He did not even wait for the man to count it, or if he even had enough, his train of thought focused on finding his best mate and ensuring those who abducted him were well-beyond incapacitation. With his mind trained, he failed to hear the cabbie calling out his change, the sounds surrounding him seeming to vanish as he walked forward.
“We honestly weren’t expecting him to be alive. Lestrade was, though. You want to talk about a driven man,” he gave a light laugh.
“Sherlock, are you almost finished? I brought breakfast.” He listened for movement or a response, garnering neither. His heartrate increased and he knocked again, this time harder and louder. “Sherlock, there’s coffee. Can I get you a cup?” Still no response. Though the young man would dismiss the promise of food, the promise of caffeine was never one to be ignored. “Sherlock Holmes, either you answer me or I’m coming in, clothed or not.” His voice came out deeper than he meant it, but it still failed to gain a reply. He cursed as he grabbed the handle, not ready to find his best friend and now-partner in such a state of undress, but his concern outweighed his embarrassment and he pushed the door open.
He had a surge of anger when some of the comments in the forum were asking about the videos of his mate’s abduction; some were discussing the content, while others were directly asking for them. Even though the comments asking for the videos were not nearly as plentiful as the ones saying how they hoped the videos were fake and that “the real Sherlock” was all right, just knowing that people were willing to watch something of that calibre and celebrate it had John’s rage boiling to the tipping point. When he saw a comment about one of the videos with a link to a .jpeg, he fought with himself whether or not to click it, but wanting to ensure that all traces of Sherlock’s degradation were no longer accessible, he clicked the link.
“Are you with me, now?” When Sherlock nodded and pulled his head away, John wrapped the towel tighter around him and began rubbing his arms to bring the heat back to his extremities. “Can you stand?”
The cursor ghosted over the thumbnail of the most recent video, which had a timestamp of four twenty-one that morning. The thumbnail showed three men, one of which was in a chair with their neck craned back and a white washcloth over their face; one of the other men was holding both sides of the cloth, keeping it tight on the other’s face, while the last man was standing to the side, his head towards the camera.
John nodded, his eyes trailing around the room, which was in disarray, just as he left earlier that morning. It was only more evidence of Sherlock’s disdaining boredom.
“Listen here, you intelligent, self-absorbed bastard,” he started as he held the side of his mate’s face, rubbing his thumb on his cheek. “When you come out of this, and you will, I know you’ll try to fight this on your own, so I’m going to call you a stupid idiot now.
The office remained in its dilapidated state, the metals chairs still rusting, the walls cracking and crumbling, the portrait of the Queen in the late stages of deterioration. Lying on the floor in the middle of the office, Sherlock was on his side, his eyes staring blankly at the wall, watching them continue to peel. The silence around him had long stopped serving as a welcome and had become grating, his mind doing nothing but running over itself. He had not moved from the floor in what felt to be days, even without the perception time,
There was a clicking sound that drew his attention back to the door. His look was curious as he saw the doorknob return. Gathering to his feet, he slowly walked towards the door, eyes not straying from the handle. He could feel the metal on his palm when he gripped it and a strange anxiety grew inside him as the prospect of what he would find. Taking a breath, he pulled the door open, introducing him to a familiar light. Stepping through the threshold, he found himself in the flat of 221B Baker Street. Confusion washed over him as he took in the surroundings – the living room in disarray, the light of streetlamps leaking into the room through the windows, John sitting in his chair while updating their blog.
“As quick as it can be.” Dreln shifted, his hand leaving Sherlock’s forehead to run down his cheek. “I really was hoping to see you make it, you know,” Dreln said as he straddled Sherlock’s hips, bringing his hand to trace Sherlock’s neck. “It’s a shame, really, someone like you going to waste.” He began adding pressure, leaving Sherlock to shut his eyes as he tried to make his final thoughts memorable.
Going against his better judgement, Sherlock found himself parting his lips, giving the man entry. The moment it pressed against his uvula, he gagged, causing the man to extract himself as Sherlock fell into a round of coughing and gagging. Once he inhaled a full breath, his head was grabbed and he was forced to take the man’s length once again. This time, when his uvula was passed, the man held Sherlock’s head still, groaning as the detective’s throat closed around him, choking. He pulled back, before driving his knob into the back of the detective’s throat.
The awkward air was broken by both Lestrade’s and Mycroft’s mobiles going off at the same time. While Mycroft’s was in the form of a call, which he stepped away to take, Lestrade’s was received as a text message. Watching them, John saw Lestrade’s features drop before Mycroft’s, though the detective inspector’s was much more readable.
Black tank-top-man’s eyes darted to the man whose face became fear-stricken. His jaw clenched, an anger seeming to build. “Honestly?!” he shouted, causing the cockney-accented man to flinch before falling into apologies. The man clenched his fists and shut his eyes, as though trying to calm himself. “I told him not to bring you on, but he didn’t want to listen.” He reached behind him into the waistband of his pants, brandishing a para .42.
He hoped his comment would not sit well given the context, but Cruz sat quiet, eyes not trailing from the spot on the wall. They sat in silence for a few minutes and John looked at his reflection in the mirror he knew Donovan and the investigator was behind. He tried to think of something to garner a response, running over multiple comments or questions. Perhaps he should mention Mycroft’s deal that was apparently denied, or why Cruz had not requested a call to the Mexican Embassy as Dreln had done with the American Embassy. At the same time, that question might cause him to do just that, forgoing any information they could gather.
One of the men, who was unrecognizable amongst the garb, stood with the hack saw in hand, walking over. They leaned down and grabbed Sherlock by the hair, lifting him up and pressing the saw against his throat as Sherlock reached to grab the man’s forearm with his only working arm. “Let’s find out,” came the familiar voice of the man who once donned a black tank-top and brown cargo pants.
“Sherlock’s mobile,” he responded, forcing himself to not break eye contact. His attempt failed when the other’s expression was unchanging. “Also his coat and scarf…socks and shoes.” The information had John shut his eyes as he shook his head, while Mycroft seemed to stand straighter, if at all possible.
He had been the only person Sherlock could even think of who he cared more than anyone else, and he had never let on.
John could see Mycroft’s brain working against him. Despite always proclaiming that he lacked the “emotional hindrance” of his younger brother, the prospect of losing that brother would be the one thing to tear down the wall he had spent many years building.
It was after the hospital had finished serving their patients dinner when anyone else decided to visit. Sherlock was in the midst of picking through and complaining about the quality of food when there was a knock on the door. John’s attention was immediately drawn, while Sherlock paid no heed and continued to make his disdain known at his apparent restricted diet. According to him, there was no logical reason for him to be placed on a bland diet of boiled chicken and white rice; even with John explaining that due to the rectal trauma, he could only eat certain food, Sherlock continued to protest.
“John,” Sherlock said, drawing his attention. “Would you give us a moment?” Though it was a request, it was said as a statement.
“Well, given that Sherlock was abducted around this time last night, at least one person has to have the same shift. Besides,” he said as he looked around the building’s exterior. “The traffic cameras may have been hacked, but I’m betting that those weren’t.” Donovan looked to where Lestrade was motioning.
All formality left him and John came out with, “You mean where they violated and ejaculated inside my best friend? Yes, I’m fairly certain I caught that,” he snapped, his head jerking to the detective inspector, jaw clenching.
“I assume the zoo is out of the question,” John asked, though it was more of a statement as Sherlock sat in the chair across from him, setting the crutch to lean against the table.
John nodded, seemingly amused when he saw the cord of the monitor wrapped around the leg of the chair he had been sitting in. “Sherlock.”
When Lestrade nodded, it seemed to be the reassurance Mycroft was searching for and he released his grip.
Finding himself waiting for the laughter signalling the witticism, Sherlock unconsciously tensed when it failed to ring throughout the basement. There was the sound of footsteps right before the mattress shifted.
The words caught John off guard, his expression confused as his brain pieced the information. As though a million and one ideas ran through his head before he seemed to land on one in particular. His change in demeanour had Lestrade knit his brows together, but John only came out with;
His head was dropped and he heard the tapping as the man began another text message, along with the sound of a zipper as the man tucked himself back into his designer jeans.
Mycroft inhaled, bringing his gaze to him. “Sherlock has an infection from the…acts committed upon him,” he said, voice tight. “As it turns out, my brother has an allergy to Rocephin, the antibiotic they were using to treat apparent sepsis. When he was administered the second dose, his body was unable to handle the shock, leading him to cardiac arrest.” Relaying the information, his grip tightened on his umbrella.
He found himself in Mycroft’s office, his older brother sitting behind his desk as his eyes traced along the papers in a folder. Sherlock looked around the room, moving from the two metal chairs in front of the desk to the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the wall.
“Sherlock, are you all right?” John called as he got up and walked to the restroom door. “Sherlock?” he repeated when he failed to get a response.
He was only given a few seconds of reprieve before the cloth was pulled back over his face. All he could get out was a partial protest that quickly was drowned out.
The moment he crossed the threshold into the basement, the pungent scent of blood and decay filled his nostrils, one he had not experienced since his time Overseas. Upon entering, the first thing he noticed was a torn and beaten mattress in the back corner before his eyes traced the room to the familiar figure of his best mate.
A laugh echoed around the room. “Oh, Sherlock, you innocent thing.” The man stood, making his way back to the mattress and loose shackles. “As much as I like you, the others don’t have the same sentiment. Maybe they’ll let me choose where to put your body parts after they cut you up.”
After the hesitation, he finally entered the flat, shutting the door lightly behind him while he peered up the stairs, as though listening for Sherlock’s presence; whether it be the violin, loud banging, yelling or, his least favourite, gunfire. Hearing nothing, his heart dropped and shut his eyes. More times than not, he had hoped to come home to quiet after a stressful day, but now that it was, it was unnerving and he found himself regretting ever wanting it to be quiet.
“Justice would be their heads on pikes,” came the monotone response. Releasing a sigh, John dropped his shoulders. “Fine. What do you need me to do?”
If they separated, it would make his infiltration much simpler; he just had to hope they would, if even to check on their missing ally.
“I need something, then,” came an unfamiliar voice to a prior statement Sherlock had not been paying attention.
“You will be lucky to make it to trial, by that I swear,” Mycroft spoke, his voice low, threatening. The two officers appeared nervous, unsure whether or not to break the government official away. “Every person you interact with, whether it be here or in the Americas, will believe the worst; and anything you put my brother through will pale in comparison, Mr. Dreln Mathias Hargett.”
Sherlock had access to his mobile, which meant he was more than likely getting ready to convince John to take on a new case. He silently cursed Lestrade. The detective inspector could have at least given him a warning that he was returning Sherlock’s phone, if just for John to mentally prep himself for the debate that was to come. He set the letter back down on the table. As he did, he noticed Sherlock’s mobile sitting on the arm of his chair. With a glance towards the hall, and still hearing the shower running, he crossed the room to pick it up.
The Irishman – Cleary – shrugged, shaking his head. “Whatever makes you happy,” he said, voice filled with sarcasm. With that said, he turned on his heel, leaving the room with the camera as the heavy steps of his boots faded out of earshot down the hallway.
He could still hear Sherlock getting ready as he fixed his coffee. However, when he heard the sound of the crutch being grabbed and meeting the floor, John found himself smiling and getting another cup to fix his partner’s. He had set both cups on the table when he saw Sherlock’s shadow near the corner. The light refused to turn on when he flipped the switch and he frowned. He gave it a few more attempts.
He quickly positioned his right wrist back into the shackle without locking it back into place and slipped the pin into the cuff of his shirt. He set his head on the ground.
He was thrown back to the floor as the man went back to the deceased, whose neck was only held on by skin and sinew.
Before John could respond, familiar voices were heard from beyond the door to the hall, drawing Sherlock’s attention.
His reaction garnered the same look as a response. “When Sanders and I arrested Dreln Hargett, there was a man in a suit. Seemed a bit more…official than the lot of us.”
He saw the flash of the camera go off as the urine spilled out of him and he could no longer do it – could no longer hold himself together. His body shook, attempting to not vocalize the emotion he had suppressed for so long.
They pulled up outside of the building. Foss escorted John in, though the military veteran had walked well ahead of him once they entered the door. After speaking with the front desk and being told which room Sherlock was being held in, John left the officer behind the moment the room number was out of her mouth. He jogged down the halls, following the signs for the correct room, which was the first room passed a nurse’s station. Coming in view of the doorway, his brows knitted together at the sight, which kept him from entering.
“We need the traffic cam footage from that night.” He folded the papers and slipped them into his back pocket.
The air quickly grew quiet between them with the sounds of the hospital beyond the door. Nurses could be heard talking to each other while the beeping of medical equipment was heard in the background with the squeaking of doors and shoes on tile. Sensing a query urging against the mind of his younger brother, Mycroft gave Sherlock a curious look.
A few minutes passed by before John decided to enter the room. Drawing Mycroft’s immediate attention, the official stood straight, his hands moving to clasp the handle of his umbrella, which had been leaning against the bed. Though he tried to hide it, his face was a slight hint of pink, proving to John that Sherlock’s sibling was capable of human emotion. The thought caused him to chuckle internally, imagining what Sherlock would have said had he have been awake. It would be something he would have to tell him the moment he had the chance.
The only reaction he received was the masked man pulling the white cloth over his face and pulling back, forcing Sherlock’s head backwards. “Get your last breath in, Mr. Holmes,” the unmasked man said as he undid the lid to the water jug. “You’re going to need it.”
“Because none of this makes any damn sense,” John said, barely able to keep his frustration held. “Abducting the brother of a government official with the sole intention of killing him wouldn’t exactly deter the bastards, so what—”
His mind raced with possibilities on how to find his best mate, but with no leads, he could not think properly on where to start. The feel of Mycroft’s eyes watching him was making him crosser and he found himself wanting to slam his fist against the eldest Holmes’ face. If Mycroft would have at least told
Clutching Mycroft’s wrist, he pulled at it just enough to relieve enough pressure from his larynx to speak. “God, I wish your little brother could see this!” He started laughing as he brought his leg up to kick Mycroft from him, causing the official to stumble backwards. He stood, flattening out his shirt from where it had been pulled up. “He honestly believed you wouldn’t come for him, and, to be perfectly honest, I felt bad for him. I didn’t expect you to show, either, given what he told me.”
“You’re a little late, don’t you think?” his voice came out in aggravation as his hands found their way to his hips. When he did not get a response, his jaw clenched. His eyes moving to the opened laptop before going right back to the intruder.
“Try to loosen up and hide the soldier, John,” Donovan said as she kept her gaze focused. “He needs to believe we brought you in with the others – he needs to talk.” John nodded as Donovan turned to face him just as he was rolling up the sleeves of the sweatshirt. He held his arms out to her, his wrists faced upwards.
The crutch clacked on the floor as Sherlock made his way down the hall towards the kitchen. The orange glow from streetlights pierced through the curtains just enough to cast the furniture in silhouettes. He reached to turn on the light, only to be met by disappointment. Heading towards the kitchen, he could hear a vehicle drive by the flat. His heart raced without his consent, despite logic dictating it was a civilian out late.
Sherlock made a low noise in his throat. He reached for one of the eggs, eyeing it with suspicion before taking a bite. While he scowled, John smirked. Sherlock took a few bites of the food presented as footsteps echoed outside in the halls from passing nurses and patient visitors.
“Well, good morning, Mr. Holmes!” he called out, voice bouncing off the surrounding walls, arrogance filling his demeanour. “To what do I owe this unpleasant surprise?”
Body betraying him, Sherlock dropped forward and his arms were twisted up, followed by the sound of a crack as his right shoulder came out of its socket. His vocals were next to follow suit and he began releasing a mixture of shouts and groans. The pressure that had been mounting in his lower abdomen had turned into a sharp pain with each motion. He tried to tune it out, tried to return the place within his mind, but was void when Dreln started twisting his hand inside him, forcing hand and wrist further.
Behind him, the American was setting up a camera on a tripod, the same camera utilized during the prior waterboarding. The body of the man who had been shot was still in the room, left on the floor where his body had made a thud of finality. A pool of blood was around his head on the floor, the blood having already coagulated around the hole in his forehead.
The duo took the second round slower, drawing out each insufferable gargle and cough. The shackles around the young genius’ ankles and wrists cut into him as he fought, drawing minimal amounts of blood, which quickly disappeared into the cement floor. His body began convulsing when the jug was still a quarter full, which the others took advantage of, having the water come out of the jug barely above a dribble and keeping the cloth saturated.
Reaching into his pocket, his pulled out the slip of paper Lestrade returned, with each sub-level in London listed. With where the van was located, the closest building with a basement was a little over a kilometre.
The man before him was broad, though not heavy, wearing what looked to be a navy-blue t-shirt and cut jeans. Despite the appearance, it was clear that the clothing was expensive, most likely designer from a higher-end store. The boots Sherlock had heard were steel-toed and black, covered in what looked to be bits of dirt and dried liquid. He wore two rings on each hand, bulky and scratched; a mobile was in his left hand, unlocked with the screen brightness shining on his jeans. On his arms, Sherlock could see the faint lines of track marks.
He reached out to grab the chair and pull himself up, taking in his surroundings and listening for the sounds to ensure he was not alone, though there were none. Behind him, the door to the office was closed. Approaching it, he reached out to grab the handle, only to realize there was not one. His chest tightened and he turned around, his stomach immediately lurching.
“It went out last night,” Sherlock’s voice rang out as the crutch clicked on the kitchen tile. John merely nodded, though he gave it on last flick before turning back to the table.
He had almost lost Sherlock – had almost forgone any chance of telling the younger man his true worth and what he meant. Even if Sherlock was unaware, he had saved John in a way beyond anyone else could have. He had given him purpose – had stayed with him despite his own faults of depression and anxiety. The very things he had hidden from the world since his discharge from the Military.
Yet, with the understanding that the group had Sherlock held in a sub-level, it appeared that both he and the detective inspector came upon the same conclusion.
When the man retracted himself, some of his liquid followed, leaving a trail down Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock tried to wipe it on his shirt, but even with his chin lowered, he could not reach to his shoulder. His hair was grabbed and, once more, a flash went off in his face.
Though he refused to acknowledge it, he had become used to the abuse, almost to the point of tuning it out. Had it not have been for the occasional smack or the initial pain of penetration, he could have regressed to his Mind Palace indefinitely.
It was not as though John did not understand why he was being asked the favour, but he doubted he would have been able to keep himself in check if he were to come face-to-face with Dreln Hargett after finding Sherlock bloody, violated and not breathing. John had since seen the third video, where Dreln was near elbow deep within Sherlock’s rear. It was after witnessing that video where he lost his composure, in the only way a soldier could, beside his best friend’s unconscious body, apologizing for not finding him sooner, for walking away the other night due to something so trivial, for things that were typical banter between the two of them.
“I didn’t want him involved,” Mycroft said firmly, irritably, his composure beginning to falter. “This isn’t one person with a few political ties here and there that wouldn’t pose him or us much of a threat. This group works underground, and they do whatever needs to be done to keep it that way. Going up against military or government is what they train to do; taking out partners, family members, anyone they need to get what they want.”
Although she appeared annoyed that she would not be able to watch whatever the video entailed, Donovan still nodded and placed her hand on the young girl’s shoulder. Taking her out of the room, John and Lestrade waited until they saw both of them at Donovan’s desk before turning their attention back to the computer.
“What’s wrong?” He maintained his light-hearted tone, not wanting his mate to slip away in a feeling of mistrust. It took a moment for Sherlock to reply, but when he did, John failed to understand.
Even against his will, he found himself back in Mycroft’s office, curled into the foetal position on the office floor. With his fear breaking around him, the office morphed along with him. The painting of the Queen had deteriorated with the oils running down the portrait, the desk had rotted, the lamp had rusted along with the chairs – nothing seemed right. He lifted his head off the floor when the silence echoed around him.
“I suspect you know when they’ll release me from my shackles,” Sherlock asked as he bit into it, making a face as though he were a child.
are going to get through this, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll be damned if I allow you to go through anymore alone.” Leaning down, he pressed their foreheads together. “I’m here with you, Sherlock. I’ll always be here.”
“Right. Thanks,” he said as he began following the officer. “Keep me updated, won’t you?” The response he received was a nod from Donovan, though her attention had gone back to staring into the holding room.
There was a silent moment before Mycroft finally pulled back, his eyes dark as he straightened his jacket.
Sherlock closed his eyes as Dreln moved his curls from his face. The tenderness was peculiar, causing the young detective to tense.
He was slowly lowered to the cushions, trying not to let the discomfort the movement caused show on his face. As he sat back, John left to retrieve the crutches at the foot of the stairs. When he came back, Sherlock had set his head on the back of the cushions, eyes staring upwards towards the ceiling. John set the crutches to lean against the arm to the couch before moving around and sitting down next to him.
Granted, I don't know how long I'll have power, so I wanted to get this done and uploaded before the inevitable power outages hit.
They held eye contact. John’s eyes were wide, his brow furrowed in a mixture of anger, fear and frustration, his jaw taut. Seeing a hint of the latter two emotions reflected on Mycroft’s features, John released a breath and broke his gaze away, beginning to pace around the flat.
While he assisted Sherlock back to the bed, he could not help but focus on how Sherlock had continued to word things since his coherency. He had yet to acknowledge what had happened – referring to his abduction and abuse as “the incident”, his injuries as “the damage”, the recovery as “the issues.” It did not take the genius and wit of Sherlock Holmes to realize he was dissociating himself as a victim. Sherlock did not spend much time confined to a bed, forcing himself to stand less than twelve hours into what he referred to as a “sentence”, even with the doctors and nursing staff trying multiple times to get him to rest. When he was awake and going through the initial questions, they asked who his primary doctor was. There was no hesitation when he listed John, which had the nurse give John a quizzical look as the military doctor nodded.
“Doctor Watson,” Mycroft said, returning to his formality, clearly attempting to keep hidden the emotion he never allowed public.
Jaw taught, John nodded, making eye contact with Mycroft. “Of course.” The look he gave was of a warning.
In an instant, John was on the opposite side of the bed, grabbing the nurse’s wrist and twisting. The man released a shout as the tendons and fragile bones snapped, the syringe falling to the tiled floor below. The moment the threat was dropped, John shoved the man against the wall, his forearm pressed against his throat, cutting his air.
“Well, given the crime rate in London these days, I completely understand distrust towards strangers.” The man chuckled as Sherlock shifted, causing the chain to clink.
“I’ll get on that when you prove you don’t need one.” Sherlock scoffed and rolled his head to look at John. “Feigning sleep doesn’t really help your point.”
The other clicked his tongue before pulling his attention back to the American. “Have you heard from Mycroft Holmes, yet?”
He had gone to the market, noting the close-to-empty refrigerator, including the partial leg Sherlock still had stored. He would have to ask about it at some point. Having it take up the entire middle section gave little room to work with. When he did finally return, bags in tow, he was partially through the door when he was welcomed to crutches at his feet, his mate sitting halfway up the stairwell with one hand on the wall and casted leg out in front. All John could do was sigh and shake his head.
“I’ve got some news,” Dreln said as he crouched down next to him. “My boss isn’t happy with your progress, which means he’s not happy with me.”
Sherlock’s hands were on his arms and shoulders, trying to push him off, falling into apologies and calling for his brother to stop.
But at least that means I get to work on this while I save up for a laptop to actually take with me while I'm gone for weeks at a time.
Another pause as John moved his hand under the sweatshirt and his jacket to grip the handle of his issued weapon.
He made eye contact with Sherlock, both of their confused and apprehensive gazes melding with each other’s. “My time wasn’t worth anything until I met you, Sherlock Homes. Don’t you dare leave me again.”
With that said, he stood, embracing his best mate’s head and shoulders. He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head, shutting his eyes as he held him. He was not sure what to expect, but he did not care in that moment. He could not lose him; and if Sherlock did choose to pull away from him, he could at least rest in the fact he did the one thing he had been wanting to. However, when Sherlock’s arm reached up in a crude attempt to grab his sleeve in acceptance, John’s grip tightened and he found himself rocking the two of them back-and-forth.
The air between them grew tense and quiet, sans the beeping from the machine hooked to Sherlock and his steady breathing through the nasal cannula.
Suddenly, a loud noise emanated from the direction of the head, cutting through the silence and pulling Sherlock back to reality.
With a nod of the head, John stood. He glanced by to Cruz, whose entire world had been shattered, his brain searching for answers and ways to escape what he expected to happen. Even as John began walking back to the doorway, he knew what he had said would grate on the Cielo Diablos member until he would ultimately give up whatever information required to ensure his own livelihood. While they wanted to make immediate headway, it was apparent that time was a virtue.
Lestrade failed to respond, instead stalling as he gave the eldest brother a sympathetic look, his eyes glazed over. “We found him unresponsive in the sub-level. Medical is working on him.”
Though he thought it was the same article from Sherlock’s initial recovery, he recalled that article did not mention the Cielo Diablos’ cartel and the abduction had been mere speculation. With one more glance to ensure the younger man was asleep, he clicked the link. The headlining image was of his most notorious image of him in the hat he detested and the collar of his trench turned upwards, next to an image of middle-aged uniformed officer. The very first sentence had a possessive heat crawl across his chest.
The tip of the umbrella hit the ground first before the shined shoes with black pinstriped slacks perfectly crested on the tops. Seeing Mycroft exit the vehicle, Lestrade clenched his jaw, on edge of what the government official would attempt, fully well knowing his authority was due to be undermined. He walked down the sidewalk to meet the government official, whose air of superiority was overwhelming.
Without saying a word, Mycroft began walking towards the van, which was still being photographed by a crime scene photographer.
At the answer, the man smiled. “Now wouldn’t it be best if the detective got his worth?” Sherlock fell silent while maintaining eye contact, not wanting to believe the logic that ran through his mind on what was to come. The man smiled. “Take him to the back,” he ordered, referring to the bloody mattress butted against the pipes in the back. “It’s time to have some fun.”
“Sir,” Donovan said to the nurse, who was now standing straight, his arms crossed over his chest as his gazed was focused on the veteran. “What’s you’re name?”
He had not seen Sherlock eat the last week, so for the man to willingly go out to supper made him, in a way, feel fortunate. He doubted anyone else could have swayed Sherlock Holmes into doing what they wanted, but if living with the genius taught John anything, it was how to work around Sherlock’s quirks and to manipulate – to get him how to do what he wanted. While he was certain Sherlock knew what he was doing, he had yet to call him out on it, leading John to believe his opinion mattered.
“Later this morning, if you prove you don’t require additional supervision,” he said in reference to his brother dropping the egg.
The door to the flat opened as John strolled in, carrying breakfast. The early morning sun flooded in through the curtains and traffic could be heard from the street. His eye caught an opened package and letter on the table in the living room as he made his way to the kitchen to set the bag down. He opened the fridge to put it away until Sherlock got up, wondering if his mate had already realised the missing thigh, which John may or may not have discarded after Sherlock had gone to bed the night prior. The argument would be inevitable, but damned if he was going to keep fresh produce around human decomposition.
Under normal circumstances, an allergic reaction to the antibiotic may have caused nausea or seizures, enough for the patient to know something was wrong and get medical aid; but for the patient’s heart to seize at such a young age and with a healthy heart, it was clear their physical state was in severe distress. John exhaled and found himself setting his forehead on his best friend’s thigh, his left hand on Sherlock’s chest and right on his leg.
“Clean-shaven, hair groomed with only a few hairs sticking out, shirt clean and ironed – You were preparing to meet that shop keep from last night, but she turned you down last minute. Now you’ve got a reservation for two at a restaurant you’ve been wanting to try, but no one to go with.” John sighed and, while anyone else’s interpretation would have been irritation, his was more-or-less of understanding with only a hint of annoyance, which he knew Sherlock picked up on. “How’s their tea?” Sherlock asked without prompting, causing John to chuckle.
The door led to nothing more than a room containing a desk, an old filing cabinet and a door to the left – the door which had a light glowing from underneath. Hand back on his weapon, he approached the door and reached for the handle. With one more inhale, he turned it and swung the door open.
Knowing Mycroft, his brother fully intended to keep Sherlock under surveillance until the last of their ranks had fallen throughout the United Kingdom. At the thought, the memory of being chained in the basement flashed across his mind before an old memory of he and Mycroft rose to the surface.
A black van pulled alongside a dark blue people carrier, stopping for several seconds before the headlights turned off and whoever was in the front seat stepped out. They were donning what appeared to be a dark tank top and lighter trousers, though the colours and types were unable to be made out. From the dark blue vehicle, which had been idle for quite a while, emerged a much broader individual, their entire ensemble black. The duo stood exchanging words before the slender man slid open the side door to the van.
He took a seat at the table, which was surprisingly barren, sans for a few newspapers. He took one of the papers, acting to not notice Sherlock’s inquisitive stare at seeing the coffeepot low before his gaze travelled to the cups on the table. Unlike how he would typically ask John if he made his coffee correctly, he hobbled to the other side of the table and pulled the chair out.
The American laughed as the other man gripped the band of Sherlock’s trousers and pulled, ripping the seam and exposing the young genius’s behind.
Lestrade looked at him, as though studying him. His mind was clearly at work, seeming to want to say something and trying to figure out how to go about it. The silence had John raising his brows, wanting the detective inspector to speak what he concluded. At the reaction, Lestrade sighed and ran his hand through his hair.
“Worked out amazingly, clearly,” John chuckled as he entered the flat. He went to kitchen to set down the various bags before returning back to where his flatmate was situated on the stairs. He reached down to hold Sherlock’s arm, assisting him to his feet and catching him when he stumbled on the step. He looped his hand around the younger man’s waist, supporting more of Sherlock’s weight than the other realized as he helped him back to the flat. “Where were you planning on going, anyway?”
It was not until the early hours of the morning when John returned to 221B Baker Street. He had waited at the police station for hours, hoping for a call to come in, fitting the female’s description; but when nothing came in, Lestrade convinced him to return home.
The conversation that was about in the room had bounced around several times, from Sherlock’s current position to what the group was hoping to gain having Mycroft’s “younger brother” in their possession. Other conversation followed to the import of products and the distribution, which Sherlock had made sure to lock into his memory.
The moment the video opened, Lestrade ran his hands through his hair, his expression going into a panic. John’s breath caught in his throat and he began shaking his head, refusing to believe what he saw.
A deep groan escaped his throat, his eyes flittering open to see the orange light hanging directly above him. When he shifted, finding his hands chained behind the chair and his ankles chained to the floor, his realization seemed to come into perspective. He recalled going to a restaurant with John, only for his head and body to feel numb after John had disappeared from view. He saw the image of the young woman who claimed to be a fan before she ran off.
Logically, he knew that the freedom he was given would be his one chance to fight and escape, but he was unable to garner the forte. Rather, he had not bothered to exert the vigour. While he had known the outcome once he was made aware of his abduction, the reality took time to set in and he bade it no heed. In the back of his mind, he had been hopeful that help would be sent, and only with it fading did he realize how foolish the thought had been.
“You wanna put your hand in this bitch, too?” Dreln asked as his forced part of his arm in, garnering a shout from the young detective.
During the night, there was a changing of the guard. An officer from Scotland Yard had come into the room to let them know he would be taking over for the other, who John had only remembered seeing once that day when he went to the cafeteria to get his own meal. John thanked him, expecting him to leave and wander the halls and talk to the staff like the others had done. Instead, he came into the room and started conversation. After fielding the typical small talk questions, the officer apologised, catching him off guard.
The American shrugged. “I don’t think he’s going anywhere.” He crouched down and grabbed the chair leg, pushing it in a bit further, causing Sherlock’s face to crease as he tried to hold back his vocals. “Besides”—he pulled the leg out harshly, not only garnering a muffled yell, but followed by a trail of blood—“I wanna have some fun with him, too, you know.” He looked up to the man, expression stern. “Keep it quiet from them.”
He sat down in his armchair, continuing to scroll through those asking for his help. One in particular had him smirk: an older man sent a message saying he believed his house to be broken into every evening because he kept hearing the floorboards creak, though he lived alone. The following message had been sent a few days later, apologising and saying it was stray cat that would come in through the opened kitchen window during the night. Sherlock’s first strain of thought was why keep the window opened at all if he believed someone was breaking into his house every night.
He was uncertain how long he spent trying to get his best mate’s heart to start, how many times he attempted to breathe life back into him; however, the next thing he knew, he felt a grip around his shoulders and he was being pulled away towards the door. His limbs flailed as he tried to get away, his attention focused on Sherlock, who was now being flanked by two men dressed in blue and white. Even as one of the men began applying the pads of an AED to Sherlock’s chest while the other continued chest compressions, he kept fighting against the person holding him, their words inaudible to his constant calling and begging to the man he cared for above all others.
Sherlock’s head was facing him, his lids fluttering to slits. He lifted his head, his gaze moving to the cup on the table. He fell back onto the pillow. “Smells amazing.”
The expression John held was one of confusion and frustration as he absorbed the information. He leaned forward, setting his forearms on his knees as he looked at Cruz. “Sherlock Holmes was dead when I got down there.” His heart lurched in his chest at the memory flashing before him, but it was Cruz’s reaction that kept him anchored. “Dreln’s trying to make it look like we were the ones responsible, and that he just got wrapped up in it. Him and Francis don’t give a damn what happens to us, they just want to save their own arses.” He fell into the persona, which seemed to work, whereas Cruz’s demeanour switched from being stiff and standoffish to almost desperate as what he thought he knew came crashing down. It had him wondering how far he could push it, whereas the Mexican man fell quiet as he searched for answers in front of him. “Mycroft Holmes did contact him – they made me listen to the recordings,” he hoped Cruz believed him, though only the part of having recorded messages was false. “Mycroft was offering us immunity and paid fare if his brother was returned, but Francis kept denying the offers.”
John breathed out a laugh. He had not even realized Mycroft was there. Then again, of course he had to have been. He was right on their heels on the ride to the hospital. “Mycroft.”
“Either Frankie and them can kill you painfully or”—he grabbed Sherlock’s throat without applying pressure—“you let me do the honour, which, let’s face it, will be much faster and less painful than what they have in store. And believe me, their way includes a lot of bloodshed. I mean…
At the mention, Sherlock found himself as a sixteen-year-old standing in front of a fully-grown Mycroft. With Mycroft’s hand still on his cheek, Sherlock felt his eyes sting.
Perhaps it was best that John’s memory of him would be as it was, instead of what was now presented: toiled and used.
“Not many people seem to come this way,” John commented, getting a grunt in reply. “It would be rather easy to say…hide someone.” The comment drew the man’s attention, as John continued to act interested in the lit tobacco, the ash on the end extending. He finally brought his gaze to meet the man’s, who started to realize the situation.
Beeping filled the hospital room as the machine kept track of Sherlock’s heartrate and oxygen levels. Outside of the room, life bustled on with the chatter of nurses and patients with the occasional alarm alerting to a needed refill on a patient’s intravenous fluids. Media had already caught wind of the young detective’s hospitalization, though the reasons had remained clouded in mystery. Reports that Sherlock had been abducted gained mass coverage throughout the night and into the early morning, something everyone was hoping would die down in the following hours as long as no one fanned the flames.
After making another right and walking the block to stand outside of the restaurant, he turned to see how far back his friend was, only to see he had not yet turned the corner. He waited another moment, but when Sherlock still failed to round the street, he released an aggravated sigh, his steps heavy in annoyance as he retraced his steps. When he turned onto the street, he expected to see Sherlock caught up in reading a flyer or something of the like; instead, he was introduced to his best mate leaning his back against a building, holding his head, appearing to sway.
Here the genius was in hospital, the place he was to get well, and a fluke nearly caused him to lose his life – something he had already lost once.
“Get your ass up, you worthless piece of shit,” he said as he smacked him again, this time hard enough to leave a red handprint. As the man stirred, the other grabbed his shirt, pulling him up from the floor. “I give you want you want served on a silver platter and you still manage to fuck it up.” He pushed him back to floor when a mumbled “sorry” escaped the other’s throat, and stood up, turning to Sherlock, who was crawling towards the broken pieces of the chair. “So sorry about him. He’s new.”
John made a comment about the subject matter, which made them both chuckle, garnering an odd look from another man passing by.
His air of relief quickly diminished when the man walked into the room. He swung at him, aiming for his temple, only for his hand to be grabbed and twisted until there was a faint
Even the man who would follow protocol to a T was more than willing to take advantage of its loopholes given the right circumstances.
“Your shoulder’s been relocated. It will take time for the full strength and sensation to come back for you to have full mobility.”
A familiar voice cut his train of thought and he looked behind him to see the comforting gaze of his best mate.
His thoughts were interrupted as a hand hit hard across his rear, followed by a hissing sound as two thumbs pressed into him.
There was a three-sentence conversation after the nurse had left, which John had simply asked, “So I’m your primary, now?”
“Quite the contrary,” was the immediate response, having John raise his brows in curiosity. “I am bored out of my
Though he knew that Mycroft would never risk security, the back of his mind begged to release the unfamiliar emotion at the presented datum.
Inhaling and releasing a sigh, John finally asked, “What do you think will happen since they found Sherlock Holmes in the basement?”
As the man picked up the hacksaw, his eyes were on Dreln. “Awful lot of things you don’t like doing, it seems. All you do is text on your goddamn phone all day. Who, might I ask, is that bloody important?”
The room smelled stale and still. The bed centred against the far wall was still made, its sheets and quilt hardly moved. There was a desk pressed against the right wall, still neat and tidy with a few university texts stacked on a ring of notebooks. A young Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed, creasing the quilt as he flipped through the thin pages of one of the textbooks. There was the sound of shuffling outside of the bedroom door. The sixteen-year-old genius had gone through a few more pages as the doorknob turned and the wooden door opened.
“You can’t leave me, Sherlock Holmes. I won’t let you,” John said quietly before he pulled his head up to peer at Sherlock’s face. “Do you have any leads?” he asked Mycroft, who sighed.
A block down, he was able to hail a cab, choosing to ignore the look he was given when he gave the cabbie the address.
“They got you, too, I see,” John commented, his voice flat with a hint of frustration as he approached the bolted chairs where the other sat. “It’s a load of rubbish, bringing us in like this, like we had a hand,” he said, sitting down with only one seat empty between them.
“Oh, you’re amazing, Sherlock,” he moaned as he held Sherlock’s head in place, thrusting in and out.
The safety of the nation was more important than one man. With a group as violent and threatening as to what he had experienced, having the like trouncing about the county would only end in the bereavements of thousands.
It was a little after seven in the morning and Sherlock’s breathing was steady, his chest rising and falling as the air from the nasal cannula filtered through. The next dose of meds were not due for another hour and John contemplated scouring for something to eat as his stomach released a low growl. Having been drinking nothing but stale coffee for the last few days was finally catching up to him. As another growl made itself apparent, he decided against leaving the hospital, but checking to see if there was anything being served in the canteen on the ground floor.
“A right breakfast, it seems.” Sherlock nodded as he sank into the pillow. “One you’ll have or you’ll be in hospital for another day,” John said, not a threat, but a fact.
“They will kill him, John,” Mycroft said, a hint of desperation flirting with his tone. “Whether they get what they want or not, they will kill him.” The typical façade Mycroft usually held onto broke at the realization he had already known.
“What’s wrong, Sherlock? You think you’d be used to being a human toilet by now.” The genius refused to open his eyes, not wanting to give the man any more satisfaction as his jaw trembled. “You know, I didn’t want to say anything, but I’m starting to think you were right about your brother not giving a damn about you. I mean”—he shifted to move on the mattress, grabbing Sherlock’s left buttock and exposing him further—“you think he’d respond to at least
The sun was setting as the patrol car pulled up outside of the sports pub with John Watson in the back seat. He had demanded to come along, despite Donovan’s obvious disapproval and Lestrade having rather had him stay behind. Before either of them could voice their further discontent, John had holed up in the back seat, saying they might as well go, since he was not going anywhere.
“Hey, don’t blame me,” the other shot back. “This dumb fuck’s the reason he got out in the first place,” he said, motioning to the man Sherlock had struck in the temple.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to him for the first time since he came through the door, before quickly moving back to his book, which John just realized was on the American serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Before Sherlock could even voice it, John knew what the man was going to say. He was going to comment on—
While John was gone for the day, he had continually searched for something to do – something to solve within the city. An older lady had come to the flat, requesting his help about her husband, who she said would disappear in the middle of the night while he thought she was asleep. The obvious answer of an affair had not sat well with her and she called him several obscenities before storming out, not even bothering to close the door as her heels pounded down the stairs. Afterwards, he had gone back to scouring the papers, occasionally asking John if he had anything, despite the soldier being no where near the flat. When nothing came up, he had gone back to reading, managing several books before John returned that evening.
He turned his head to see the man from earlier taking off one of his gloves and unzipping his blood-smeared protective suit, revealing the same black tank-top and top part of the cargo shorts. He reached beyond his waistband, pulling out his mobile phone, which was ringing a high-pitched screech.
“You know, I really do like you, Sherlock Holmes. Which is more than I can say for most people we’ve had visit.” He released an airy breath. “I may actually feel remorse later on down the road.”
Sixteen-year-old Sherlock clamped his eyes shut and stepped backwards. He recalled his older brother’s hand on his groin, his teeth on his neck, before running from the office and down the hall. He tripped on the muli-coloured tile, collapsing to all fours as his breath hitched in his throat and water met the floor.
Even the man’s co-workers exchanged glances, staring at their colleague while they waited him for to answer. When the silence dragged too long, Donovan reiterated, “Sir.”
“He had those an hour ago.” His body stiffened, going into immediate alert. He looked at the small glass bottle the man had just set back down on the tray, reading the name of the medication. “And there’s definitely been a mistake, because he’s allergic to that,” John said, nodding to the bottle.
Inhaling in an attempt to compose himself, John came out with, “You’ve had the contact information of the group who took Sherlock all along?”
“Christ! Sherlock!” Instantly, he turned off the water, which had run stone cold, and grabbed the towel on the rack.
It had been over twelve hours since Sherlock had been abducted and, while the only video was of him being waterboarded, the chances of that having been the only thing they had put Sherlock through did not favour well. After having read what the cartel was known for, and been told more by Mycroft while they were en route to the scene, John’s mind flipped over itself on scenarios his mate had most likely already been subjected to. It had him wondering if Lestrade had been made aware of the group’s involvement.
“He’s tight,” the voice of the black-tank-topped man came out. “Hope Mycroft’s always wanted to see you railed, Sherlock,” he said, a low laugh escaping his throat. “Dreln, get a close-up on his arse – I want Mycroft to see every inch of his little brother.”
Mycroft’s eyes were swimming while he aimed for a disapproving glare that failed as he had to maintain his balance by keeping a grip on the footboard. “I am not in the mood to deal with you. Get out.”
But it was foregone as he felt the tip of the man’s prick against his rectal cavity, pressing in slowly. After the sound of the man spitting, the man pushed into him, groaning as he did. Despite knowing tensing would only make it hurt, his sphincter contracted against his will, causing him to release a low cry.
Mycroft could no longer hold back the emotions coursing through him and he found himself restraining the man by his neck, fingers digging into the larynx and veins.
“Shut the fuck up,” he snapped as he snatched his glove from the hand that was offering it back to him by the partially dismembered body. “Why don’t you actually make yourself useful and help cut up this asshole?”
The nurse – Frank – fell silent as Donovan took the lead and approached him. The sergeant grabbed the man’s shoulder and pulled him forward, away from the wall. The man allowed her behind him to grab his wrists and meet them to his back, all the while focused on Lestrade and the weapon drawn on him. He locked eyes with him as Donovan cuffed him, expression showing nothing but contempt as his mouth formed a tight line. Once the handcuffs were in place, Lestrade sheathed his weapon. He and his co-worker exchanged glances. Donovan placed him in a modified escort hold before Lestrade grabbed the man’s upper arm, pulling and jerking him towards the door, moving passed the small crowd of nurses and patients they were not even aware had gathered.
“Gods, he’s tight,” the man said as he pulled out and pushed back in, getting the same response. “Feels so good,” his voice came out in a moan.
Three security cameras were on the outside of the building, one facing the door, one facing down the sidewalk and the other pointed towards Ebury Square. Donovan seemed more apt to agree with the proposal that she had about fetching the possibly-corrupt traffic camera footage.
With that, he stood and made his way to the door. Walking out, he could hear Sherlock shuffle to retrieve his falling trousers. It took more will than he would have liked to admit to leave Sherlock, but it was something the genius had to come to terms with. It would be the best way for him to recover mentally, knowing how his mind worked.
Behind the leg of the chair lay a metal pin – one the masked mad was unaware had fallen from his pockets during his time subduing a struggling genius.
“Tell me, what did you do to your little brother, Mycroft?” Dreln asked, cutting through his train of thought. At the question, Mycroft’s eyes grew dark as he felt his heart thump painfully in his chest. “He mumbled about something not being his fault, so I’m assuming it wasn’t great.” A long-repressed memory ran through his head as he saw his little brother pressed against a wall by his own hand. He shook the thought away as Dreln grinned as the reaction. “You know that it was never your name he called out, don’t you? Kept calling out for a “John”.” Even Dreln caught Mycroft’s jaw clenching and gritting teeth, causing him to smirk. “Do come visit me after Sherlock’s funeral. We’ll have so much to discuss.”
“Then let them eat it,” came the response. Sherlock turned his attention to the detective inspector. “Perhaps you would have it, then?” When Lestrade grimaced, Sherlock said, “Precisely,” and dropped the fork, leaning back on the bed. “Back yet again, I see. Well, let me fill you in on everything you’ve missed: the food is horrendous, the staff still refuses to let me out of this room, the so-called “doctors” are morons, my
Making his way to the living room, and even with the limited light source, he could make out the shape of an envelope by the entry door. He found himself opening the door to the flat, if just to put his mind at ease. The manila envelope at his feet begged his attention after the door was latched close.
As they began cutting into the neck with a hacksaw, the blood that came out was cold and thick, having coagulated and settled hours prior; despite the precaution, blood that was still in the carotid artery spit blood on the white suits, which went ignored as the sound of the saw cutting into bone filled the basement.
When he came into the room, Sherlock was still asleep. At first glance, everything seemed normal and in place. The machine was beeping every second that monitored his heartrate, and the oxygen was running through the nasal cannula that the other had stopped using when he first regained consciousness. However, as he drew closer, he could see Sherlock’s brow furrowed and sweat across his forehead. The young genius looked as though he was in pain, his breath catching before coming out fast. The heartrate monitor began speeding up, the lines fast and irregular. Sherlock turned onto his side, body curling in on itself. He started panting, the machines going haywire.
Instead of being met with the heat and cloud of steam, the temperature had dropped drastically from the hall. The next thing he noticed was the crutch on the floor and sleep clothes on the floor and in the sink. He called out for Sherlock as he reached for the shower curtain, pulling it open.
Sherlock had spent his first hours of arrival in surgery, having wooden splinters removed from his anal cavity. A colonoscopy uncovered multiple tears in his anus, which could only be repaired through time, along with antibiotics to avoid possible infections. They reset his shoulder and cast his knee and fractured wrist; the soles of both feet required stitches from where the glass had penetrated, as did his left hand. With Mycroft’s permission, they performed a rape kit and started Sherlock on the first round of medications to prevent possible sexually transmitted diseases. When the results came back, Lestrade would be the first to know to have any DNA evidence put through the system in hopes of finding anyone who aided in the abduction and violation of the young genius.
Noting the lack of sunlight, he brought his attention to John, who was now rereading what he had typed, ensuring there were no misprints.
He looked around, but the office laid barren. Knitting his eyebrows together, he walked behind the desk, where a manila folder was closed. When he opened it, he was introduced to pictures of himself being violated by different people, each one having a close-up. As he flipped through the pictures, he shook his head before closing the folder. He shut his eyes, inhaling. The sound of footsteps from the entryway drew his attention and he pulled his head up, expression curious as the figure of his older brother crossed the threshold.
“Figured I’d lie down, rest a bit.” He saw the outline of the person from his peripheral. The man was short and stout, face sunken in from apparent years of drug use. Unlike the man from earlier, his clothes were not worn from choice, but necessity – most likely someone lower on the totem pole, given the menial tasks that those in higher ranks felt did not require their attention. The way he carried himself hinted that he was not much of a threat if something were to arise.
Dreln stood leaning against a wooden desk, his mobile in hand as the sound of typing filled the room. The door shut behind him as he came to stand fully inside, not even garnering a glance from the other man. Inhaling, Mycroft stood straight, his umbrella in front of him as both hands were set on the handle. After a few moments, the sound of a sent message emanated from Dreln’s phone before he finally pocketed it and looked up.
The sun had begun to rise by the time he was given a room with rounds from nurses every fifteen minutes.
“So you’ll just stand back and do nothing, then?” When Mycroft did not respond, John nodded his head, releasing a fast exhale through his nose as he turned his back to him, pacing towards the door.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and slammed the textbook shut. He set it on the bedside table. However, instead of getting up, he fell backwards on the bed, his hands over his head as he stared at the ceiling. He could hear Mycroft’s sigh of frustration. “Coitus is so meaningless, though. It does nothing other than satisfy the most basic desires of the human body. With a sophisticated enough mind, sex is useless and gives you nothing. Only more evidence that I’m more intelligent than you.”
At the comment, Sherlock cracked his eyes open, sending what glare he could. Seeing John smirking, he turned his head away. “Not with you present. That’s certain.”
What he came upon was Mycroft holding his phone, staring down at the screen, his brow line furrowed in what John could have mistaken for confusion.
The man smiled, his expression dark. “I’ve read your blog – the way you and your boyfriend meander about London solving crimes. Well let me give you a good old-fashioned mystery, Sherlock Holmes.” He brought his face close to the detective’s. “London’s most famous detective goes missing; his lover and government brother try to find him, but they don’t realize the harder they try, the more the detective suffers. All it would take to end it is the detective’s important brother to drop his own investigation. Now I ask you, Mr. Holmes: how would this mystery end in the mind of the famous detective?”
Lestrade’s eyes were enflamed, an incredulous look over him, while John’s entire face was red, his fists clenched. A million emotions flooded through him, not one he dared vocalize, less he became uncontrollable. Rage built inside him as his eyes focused on the grinning face of the American, his mind running over every possible scenario that would lead him to both Sherlock and those in the video. The scenes he played were those even POWs would have found merciful.
Mycroft looked up at him as he turned the laptop’s screen to face him and pressed the spacebar. The sound of Sherlock gagging and choking filled the room. John did not bother looking at the screen and, instead, locked eyes with the taller man; the anger he had managed to quell in the hall grew with each second the video went on. Hitting the spacebar again, Mycroft paused the video, drawing his attention to the screen, which was of his younger brother’s head now forward in mid-cough.
Sherlock shot him a glare before rolling off the bed. He crossed the room to stand in front of Mycroft. Taking the door, he slammed it shut and crossed his arms across his chest. Mycroft visibly tensed. Even in his drunken state, he was standing straighter and eyeing his younger brother.
He could still hear his voice echoing in his mind – Sherlock’s young voice crying and begging for him to stop.
It was apparent Dreln was waiting for his response, which had Sherlock follow with, “Get on with it, then,” his vocals steady despite the hard pounding in his chest and stomach.
“Tell that to his arse,” the voice of the Irishman spoke from behind his surgical mask, to which Dreln laughed with a wave, not even glancing up as his fingers tapped away.
The body of the lower-class man hit the floor, his eyes opened as a bullet wound leaked blood from his skull.
Sherlock was trying to drop the chair sideways to reach it, but the way both he and it were shackled was not allowing for much leeway. With one final rock, he hit the floor, his shoulder making hard contact, radiating a shock of pain down his arm and side. It was quickly ignored and he jerked to move the chair and get his hand close enough to the pin. His fingers traced what he could not see and he started to shift backwards, closer to where he knew the pin had fallen.
The physical change in him was apparent, evidenced by his ever-creasing brow line and dangerously still hands. “And why didn’t you ask for Sherlock’s help?” John’s voice was starting to rise, his anxiety and frustration coming to the surface as he managed to look away from the photos and pull his attention back to Mycroft.
The man had switched angles, pounding inside him at an awkward position, feeling as though it was ramming into the side of his wall. It was not long before the man released a grunt, spilling his seed into Sherlock. He performed a few more thrusts, pumping the white liquid inside him before retracting himself.
The legs of the chair scraped against the floor, digging scratches across the concrete. With each movement, the banging echoed around the room. Given enough time, the noise would undoubtedly be investigated, and given the actions that transpired the last time more than one person occupied the room, the young detective was attempting to make haste.
John believes he has a lead on Sherlock's location, while his best mate comes to terms with his regrets.
“Ah, Sherlock. Glad you could join us. I was just showing your brother some of my favourite moments together.” Sherlock looked at Mycroft, who said nothing, instead watching his younger brother with nothing but disappointment. “We did have fun, didn’t we?”
A timeframe which people in the criminal justice field would have no longer expected to find the target alive, given that most victims were killed within the first twenty-four hours. He shook the thought and left the cab.
Lestrade’s jaw became taut. “You are not taking anything from my crime scene. I don’t care if you work for the government or if you’re related to Sherlock Holmes. My scene, my rules.” Though it went unnoticed, John’s eyes had gone wide at seeing someone speak to Mycroft, other than Sherlock, with such a directive and he managed to act interested in something other than the conversation. “We have the best tech analysts at Scotland Yard, and if anything can be recovered from that phone, we have the people who can do it.”
In an instant, he hit the floor, dragging himself back towards the door, pressing against it, eyes focused on his own dead expression as his heart pounded viciously in his chest. His breath was rapid, his ducts betraying him.
At the very end of the article was written the hospital Sherlock was being housed in with the line “and we wish him a quick recovery.” He hung on that last line, reading it over and over until the words meant nothing.
“Oh, I have an idea,” the American said as he pointed his phone’s camera towards Sherlock with the men dismembering the body behind him, snapping a picture. He turned his focus back to his phone. “Maybe this will get his attention.” A sudden laugh escaped him, one that was overly exaggerated and even garnered the look of those busy cutting up the body. “Hey!” he called to them, still in mid-laugh. “Think Mycroft Holmes would give a shit if we cut up his brother while he’s still kicking?”
Dreln looked at him, expression unchanging. “No one you need to know.” At the look he was given, he shrugged. “You’ve got things to take care of here, while I have to make sure y’all’s asses are covered in case shit goes south. But if you want to have to deal with that instead, by all means, let’s trade off.” He held out his phone, offering it.
The sense that the last thing Sherlock would want is to entertain the idea of going out for breakfast, for obvious reasons, had him waking early to pick up something light and simple from the store around the corner. More times than not, he had to make Sherlock eat, knowing fully well the man would skip meals given the chance. It was a habit John was trying desperately to break, especially given the younger man’s situation. At one point, he had changed the password to his laptop, refusing to give Sherlock the new password lest he ate lunch. It had been a moot point. After everything was cleaned up, before John had given it to him, Sherlock was sitting at the desk, typing away on the laptop.
Sherlock’s arms fell to his side as the shackles were undone, his right arm immobile as the other was numb from the constricted blood flow. His body screamed at him, while his mind faded in and out. Blood, semen and urine dripped from his anal cavity as splintered wood kept itself held by the muscle, sending sharp pains throughout his lower abdomen and back. The piece of wood was grabbed and pulled out somewhat before being pushed back in, garnering a small whimper from the young genius as the broken wood caused shards to stick inside him.
Mycroft took a breath, his shoulders going back as he watched the shadow of the man place his hand on the one coming-to. “Given that my brother is currently within your residence, I assume introductions aren’t required.” Even with the lack of light, his tensing was still visible. “Where is Dreln Hargett? We have a meeting long overdue.” The man pointed over his shoulder to the door he had come from. “Very good.” He walked passed him to stand outside of the door with the light exuding from underneath. “I do suggest you leave your weapons and walk outside, less your evening ends early.”
It only took a few moments before the man’s struggling became less apparent, limbs ultimately falling. John gave it another minute to ensure the man was fully incapacitated before he released his grip and gently lowered the man to the floor.
“Before I leave, do you want to hear my favourite moment with your brother?” They held eye contact, the leer on his face growing. “When we pissed in him and made him cry.”
“I don’t care what it doesn’t say, he’s allergic and Rocephin can kill him.” Seeming to ignore him, the nurse took hold of the IV and brought the needle to the injection port. “What are you doing?!” John grabbed the tube that was near Sherlock’s elbow and bent it, halting the flow of liquid as the man pressed down on the plunger. In an instant, John pulled the IV’s needle form Sherlock’s vein, blood dripping down his mate’s arm onto the white sheets.
