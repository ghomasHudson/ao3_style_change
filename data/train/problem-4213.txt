He smiled, fondly. It was becoming harder and harder to remember he was a prisoner and his first duty was to escape. Dean caught his eye and gestured for Castiel to join him at the wheel. Without even considering it Castiel crossed the deck towards him. Escape plans could wait.
By the time Dean had gotten his first two applicants through the door, he had already switched to autopilot. Buzz person in – ask name and purpose of visit – check paperwork – compare photograph – check additional paperwork – follow up questions if required – stamp form – wave them through – buzz person in – ask name and purpose of visit… and so it went on until the timer beside him let out a bleep letting him know it was random test time. The woman at the window startled when the timer beeped and Dean sighed, “if you’d like to step into the side room here, ma’am, it’s just routine testing.”
Castiel smiled, fondly, at his mate and touched his cheek gently. “My love, who says I need to go anywhere?”
He finds something inoffensive to put on until the pizza arrives and goes to check his phone when he realises that Cas is looking at what little space exists between them strangely.
Dean patted his arm and made to approach his parents, leaving Castiel with his brother who looked smug even by Gabriel’s standards.
Dean gave up, even though Castiel wasn’t entirely sure how long his own resolve could hold out. The threat of Adam coming in upon them should have been deterrent enough though.
It didn’t really surprise Dean that it was Cas who knew how to rig the thing up. He connected Dean and Queenie to the same rig as though he was well practised in such things. Though he’d probably learned from watching his captors over the last few days.
Dean thought for a moment, his expression, unfortunately, giving him away. “I’ve got an idea!” he said, suddenly, grabbing Clarence’s hand before checking if it was okay. “Come with me.”
“Yeah. I’ll see you later, Dean,” Sam called, already rushing out the door. For all Dean wanted them to keep themselves to themselves there was already a small group of students in the street waiting for Sam so they could all walk together. Sam was a popular kid and it made Dean smile, he wouldn’t begrudge him having friends, just as long as they were kept at an arm’s length.
Castiel hadn’t intended to wake him, not really. He leaned in and pressed gentle kisses along the line of Dean’s jaw, revelling in the way the stubble scratched his lips. Dean shifted a few times and he smiled before his eyes fluttered open.
Still beyond words Dean manages to nod, unable to fathom why Cas should look like all his birthdays, Christmasses, and wet dreams have come at once. Cas leans in to kiss him and Dean uses the distraction to reach blindly over to the drawer that had scarred him for life but he knows there’s lube in there. There must be, surely. He feels his way to a bottle and pulls it out, bringing it to his eyes and he recognises the font and the shape; it’s lube. It’ll do.
Cas reached over into Dean’s pocket for the offending phone; Dean couldn’t remember when they had fallen into such casual touches, but he didn’t mind it. In fact, he kind of liked it.
For the longest time, Castiel just stared at him, warring feelings within him. He was hurt and even more hurt by the implication he could ever find someone in his life that would be better suited to him than Dean. Dean. He had absolutely no intention whatsoever of finding himself a society wife who would look good on his arm at the admiral’s table. Ultimately he settled for, “You know there’s no such thing as the British Sea.”
Cas rolled onto his side even though Dean didn’t move his hands. He wasn’t going to let go of Cas for anything. He coughed again but was smiling when he looked up at Dean.
They’d sleep to a soundscape of the wind in the trees, the occasional car passing but mostly the sound of a hundred bugs that only came out at night. Cas would be able to name every one of them.
“It was great meeting you,” Sam said, warmly, pulling him into yet another hug. Castiel had never seen such affection let alone been on the receiving end of it. Eileen signed a farewell and Castiel responded in kind, surprised that he had picked even that much up in such a short space of time. He was glad he had though, it was worth it to see her face light up.
voice from such a pale face. Nor had he expected the way his blood seemed to thrum under his skin from just those two words, as though the voice resonated with his very soul. “I’m so sorry, I should have- I didn’t mean to- I’m fine I have to-” he made to hurry past Dean but stopped instantly. Dean followed his gaze and felt his own stomach churn, two of the royal guards had paused in what they were doing, were looking over at them, drawn by the commotion.
Dean went but he was no less confused for it. Cas was damp beneath him but warm despite it and he pulled Dean flush against his chest, wrapping his arms around him.
Cas arched an eyebrow. He didn’t look happy. He’d sounded relieved that Dean was awake but his face was grim.
Queenie made a strangled sound in the back of her throat and almost bucked out of Sam’s lap entirely. But Cas was there to ease her down.
“No, they locked themselves away in paradise after trying to destroy the world,” Dean said, pointedly. “I mean it, I’m...I’m glad you’re here with us. I shouldn’t have freaked out over the whole angel thing.”
Out of the corner of his eye Castiel could feel Dean looking at him. With an eye roll that seemed to move through his entire body, he inwardly prayed for patience and ground out, “Dean. I’m fine.”
Michael gave an awkward shrug, “Yeah, but...I mean at least I get to stay around them y’know. I don’t have to give up the life I have here,” Castiel saw his eyes flicker towards the castle, probably because it dominated the horizon. “You’ve given me a lot to think about, Clarence,” he said, softly.
But Dean was pointing at two of the larger vehicles. “Look at those things, they’re like houses on wheels. That thing’s bigger than most of the places we lived in.”
Sam patted Dean’s hand with his own, the closest the two would ever get to open affection, “Yeah...” Sam said, and that was all that needed to be spoken about it. For now at least. Dean sank back into his seat, returning to his dinner, but one eye on his brother who he knew was talking to Meg, but he was at least hiding it well. Until he winced. Dean raised an eyebrow so Sam gave a weak grin, “Clarence is laying into her for the same thing.”
The relief that Dean felt was palpable and the grin he gave made him look ten years younger. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back in the face of such radiance. He expected the hug, or at least the half hug that came when Dean threw his arm up to grip Castiel’s shoulder, he was not expecting the kiss that followed it. It was a swift thing but fierce and full of gratitude. He pulled back so quickly, Castiel didn’t get the chance to kiss him back, in fact, his brain had barely registered that he was being kissed before Dean turned away.
Dean dropped a gentle kiss to his crown, taking a moment to breathe in the glorious scent that seemed to cling to Cas; the first flower’s dew, a breath after a rainstorm and something that never failed to remind Dean of the night sky. “I love you too and not just because you can do
“Go moon over each other at the table,” she laughed, shooing them away, “I have to greet your guests.” She rolled her eyes, as though she couldn’t think of anything more tedious than shaking hands with every noble in the kingdom, all vying to shower their praises on the new king. Already Castiel knew he liked his mother in law more than he had ever loved his own mother.
Dean told of a man who had come promising to make the most out of their land, to help them grow better crops, create better tools… but how all of that had soon crumbled away and instead Roman just took what he wanted, stripped the island bare and sold its treasures for a profit. He had been right, there had been areas that could have been used for farming that had gone unnoticed, but now Roman grew the crops he wanted there and used the islanders to harvest them.
The queen nodded and for a moment she looked like she might have been sorry for it, assuming she was capable of such a feeling.
He dismounted in the courtyard, stroking his horse fondly as a stable hand jogged over to take her. Cas was perfectly capable of slipping off his own mount himself, but Dean reached his arms up to lift him down anyway, just so he could revel in having his angel in his arms for a few moments. Cas kissed him, a short, lingering thing as he stretched his wings out behind them, airing them after holding them tucked behind him for so long. There were several gasps from the soldiers scattered around the place, but they were soon lost to an excitable, young voice calling out across the courtyard, “Dean? Dean!”
Castiel took a breath, mentally counting to ten in his head. It was a tired argument, one he was sick of having, but his desire for cohesion above all else among his ranking officers meant he wouldn’t challenge the man directly, even though a stern word is all that would be needed.
Cas’ eyes narrow a little but he doesn’t look away from the bed. “Would you swear to that in a court of law?” Dean laughs and eventually Cas straightens his shoulders and jumps into the bed as though he’s afraid if he waits much longer he’ll never get around to it.
“I’m ready,” Cas begs. He surely isn’t. Dean is three fingers deep into him, marvelling at the way Cas takes him, wondering how he will possibly be able to survive the sight of him taking his cock. His fingers still but Cas doesn’t let him pause. “I want to feel you. Make me feel it.”
They kiss for a while longer before Cas shifts so that he’s out of Dean’s lap and back on the monstrosity of Gabriel’s bed. Dean finds that he hates it a little less this morning.
Cas is right about one thing though; the bed is surprisingly comfortable even if it curves a little, forcing Dean’s body to lean into Cas. Cas leans towards him in kind but there is still enough space between them to protect their modesty.
“Look, we’re not all that interested in your garden, we just wanna get our friend back, okay? If there’s anything you can tell us that might help us find him, we won’t get in your way,” Sam offered, the diplomatic shit that he was.
Dean managed to look up. His mother was beaming at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. Then there was a bundle in his arms and Dean was looking upon a miniature version of Castiel.
Despite the fresh bedsheets, when the time comes, Cas still hesitates at the side of the bed. It distracts Dean from the fact that he cannot find a way to get comfortable on the couch.
“How the hell does Raichu here hang out with the God of Lightning if it’s scared of storms anyway?” Dean hissed having eventually settled on using the edge of the coffee table as a makeshift seat.
When Dean pulls back, Cas’ eyes are still closed as though he’s savouring the feel of Dean’s lips against his. Eventually, he opens his eyes and touches Dean’s cheek reverently. “I’ll always be here to watch over you. Of course I’ll stay.”
When Dean turned and caught black eyes staring back at him he was only a little disheartened. Demons were one of the hardest things Dean had ever had to kill, but it could still be done. Without even realising he’d reached for it, the blade that would do the job was in his hand. The demon didn’t seem particularly afraid, but then, they never did. They didn’t usually grin though and even at a distance, Dean could see the demon’s lips quirk into a malevolent smile.
was quiet, a confused hush upon it. Sam and Eileen were coming up on deck, aware that they’d won, but not how they’d managed it. Benny called for the hands to secure the ship but then came the shout, “They’re sending a boat!”
Adam looked between his brothers in open confusion, but Sam looked so tired, Dean didn’t mind taking one for the team and offering the explanation. At first it was something of a surprise that Adam had even asked the question, but then he remembered that it wasn’t as though all three of them had had the same education. They might all have the same father, but only two of them were princes. Only two of them had been raised to wage war, it was mostly Sam and Dean's doing that Adam had ended up where he had at all.
Dean scoffed before he could stop himself before he shrugged, “Maybe. I mean. If getting tied down to a guy you’ve never met or spoken to before is your idea of fun,” he caught himself, realising that he sounded just a little too bitter and quickly covered it by asking, “You uh...you think the Novak guy is happy? I mean...it’s a pretty big step up from the countryside to...” he waved a hand vaguely in the direction of the palace.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh even as Dean tried to kiss it from his lips. “Truly I wonder why I ever resisted your charms when we met.”
In response, Cas punched him lightly on the arm, “Dean, you learned how to drive through trial and error and from directions in books that were written over a hundred years ago. The fact that you can drive at all is impressive, take the compliment.”
Dean’s eyes opened and he realised with horror that he wasn’t dead. Crowley’s hand was harsh against his scalp, forcing him to look up. Crowley’s eyes were red but it was the way that his lips were twisted into an unnatural smile that made him truly look like a demon.
In the end, Castiel bartered a trip on a little more than a glorified fishing boat, looking considerably out of place among the ragged fishermen in his captain’s uniform, even if the shine had worn off a little. The crew, all ten of them, left him alone, so he gave them a wide berth noticing that their easy camaraderie with each other didn’t extend to passengers. The captain had not offered his cabin, despite the considerable amount Castiel had paid for passage and so Castiel slept on deck, using little more than his coat for warmth. He could have insisted of course, but sleeping on deck suited his mood. It seemed oddly fitting to leave the warmth of Dean’s cabin for the chill of the deck.
It was the way Cas said it. Sagely yet clearly with no concept of what he was actually saying that had Dean choking on little more than the air he was struggling to breathe. “Yeah, look, just pick one.”
Cas understands though. He sees the question and presses their foreheads together in a gesture that can only be described as
Dean shrugged his shoulders, his cape, which he found ridiculous but certain formalities had to be observed the day before the Feast, the day before his wedding, rippled from the gesture, drawing attention to itself and successfully annoying him even more. “Why not? I mean, I’m gonna be shut up somewhere, might as well be in my own room.”
For a moment it looked as though Dean might wave the prospect away, but he didn’t. Instead, he turned to Castiel with almost a smile. The hint of half a smile at least. “Yeah?”
Dean had told Castiel that he would not accept his promise of returning, that if he had done so then it would mean he looked for him every day. And so, Castiel had not promised, but Dean had still looked. It had been weeks since they had left Castiel at Nassau, since he had watched him disappear out of view with some important looking men who would sooner hang Dean than look at him. Still, every day Dean woke up and would look out to sea, leaning against
“I don’t know,” Castiel snapped irritably. “He must have learned the spell somewhere. We found the crook and he banished me.”
“The hell does Sam think he’s even doing?” Dean grumbled, kicking at the floor, hardly caring that he was scuffing his boots and had no prospect of replacing them if they tore.
Sam had managed to get Queenie onto her feet, though she struggled to stay there, one arm flung around Sam’s shoulder as she gripped him to stop herself from falling again. Cas’ hand found Dean’s, entwining their fingers though he shot Dean a look to make sure he wasn’t overstepping. Dean had never wanted to kiss him so badly in his life and there had been plenty of times Dean had wanted to kiss him.
“More than you want happiness for yourself?” Castiel snapped. He didn’t mean to, he couldn’t help it. He’d never allowed himself to think for a moment he’d meet his true mate, it seemed to be the most spiteful and cruel joke the Gods could play on him to bring them together and then deny them like this.
“I also asked you to stay,” Dean said, almost petulantly, but he couldn’t seem to stay annoyed with Castiel’s hand so comforting against his face.
He knew that Cas accepted his words before he said anything. Still, when he breathed, “Okay, Dean,” Dean pulled him in closer and kissed the top of his head. “I’ll stay here, but please don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger. I’ll worry about you too. Demons hardly treat their human prisoners well.”
The world around Castiel was a blur. There was a roaring in his ears and he felt like he was being torn through the very fabric of existence. The heat of Hell was gone, all was grey and lifeless. He couldn’t discern a single detail as the world rushed past him and then…
“There are spells for that,” Adam shrugged, carelessly, seemingly unaware when everyone turned to look at him. “For sealing the gates of Hell. Permanently, I mean. That’s never been the problem.”
“And Lilith’s crook is the same for demons. It summons every demon to it, so if you were to use it in Hell, all the demons would be forced back.”
“Well, I’ll be damned, it’s really you,” he murmured, before pulling Castiel into a backbreaking and thoroughly inappropriate bear hug. It would never do to have such an open display of affection in front of the hands Castiel thought, vaguely, right before he wrapped his arms around his friend and hugged him right back.
It looked like Cas might reply, but Dean interrupted them. He hadn’t meant to, but he couldn’t stop it. He started laughing, not just that but he doubled-over, gut-wrenching hysterics escaping him as he clung onto the edge of the table to steady himself. Cas turns everything they know about him on his head and Sam’s first thought was the nerdy shit. Of course it was.
The trapdoor was exactly where Castiel remembered it, hidden behind the casks, half obscured by discarded kitchen tools and waste which had never found its way to disposal. As Castiel opened it, he heard Dean gave a low whistle of approval, even though he clearly had no idea where it led. Taking a candle from his satchel, Castiel lit it with a thought, more for Dean’s benefit than his own before he led Dean down the stairs. Dean didn’t need to be asked to pull the door closed behind them and Castiel waited for him to join him at the bottom of the steps.
asleep when barely muffled voices woke him. For a moment, he couldn’t figure out how it was that he could hear voices so clearly, but then he realised that Dean had started coming into the cabin, his hand still on the door handle before he’d been called back.
Castiel actually passes Michael’s car twice before he kneels to tie his shoelace, slipping the tracker onto the underside of the car. He paces for a little while longer before he finally seems to come to a decision, retrieves his suitcase and stomps reluctantly back to the room.
. He would not have known he was capable of such a thing and the first night had seen him practically throw himself from the bed in the morning, babbling about how they could possibly have been at the Citadel overnight. But, Dean had been laughing and coaxed him back to bed with soft kisses and soothing words, assuring him everything was alright. Ever since, Castiel had dreamt of kissing Dean somewhere in the sun.
Cas rolled his eyes and laughed, “Of course, together. I don’t want to be apart from you, not for a moment.”
but they were still presenting a target and in moments the air was filled with the thick smoke and thunderous screams of both ship’s broadsides. Nobody could see more than a few inches ahead of them, but they could certainly hear the screams and some of them were most definitely coming from
,” Cas gasps and Dean can’t hold out against such a request. He closes his mouth around the head letting Cas rock deeper until he’s flush against the back of Dean’s throat and Dean is trying to remember how to do this. He swallows around Cas and that is all Cas can stand, pulling him off sharply. Dean looks down on Cas’ heaving chest as he tries to bring himself back under control.
“Right, yeah...of course,” Dean snorted, despite himself. “When The Tribulation came, what was the world like?”
There was that adoring look again as Dean reached out and touched Castiel’s own crown. “Yeah, well you look beautiful.”
Castiel turned his head slightly so that he could still feel Michael’s warmth beneath him, but now he could look over at the Temple. It seemed so much more familiar to him already.
“Cas!” Dean hisses. Maybe there’s another button. One that will detach Dean’s side of the bed and catapult it from the room. Maybe there is a hole he can crawl into where he can curl into a ball and die.
The woman took the corn back and started laying the ears from the box atop the pyre, as the magistrate dropped to his knees and the crowd followed suit. Even Dean.
“Our horses came from the palace,” Castiel answered for Sam, aware that all three of the brothers were looking at him in surprise. “They won’t be used to the terrain, the proximity of the demons or the brimstone would likely scare them.”
But there was nothing to see. Only the strange and unexpected realisation that Sam wasn’t his only family now. He wouldn’t have thought he’d welcome a bratty telepath and an angel,
“Cassie,” Balthazar said, as patiently as he could muster, presuming on their many years of friendship to speak out of turn. “If you pick this fight, at best you’ll lose your ship. Zachariah will post you to the arse end of nowhere and you’ll be ferrying despatches for the rest of the war.”
“I haven’t kissed you properly,” Dean said, a little sadly given what had just taken place, “I just want to take you to a bedroom and lock the door until neither of us can remember our names.”
Jo’s face appeared at the hatch, looking up at him with the widest grin Dean could ever remember seeing on her face. “Sure thing,
Dean rose from the table and reached over to the counter, picking up a cloth to wipe the partially chewed soup from his face. “Sam,” he sighed again, hating the way his brother tensed at the tone. It was an old conversation, but it would not be the last time they rehashed it. “You gotta be more careful.”
Cas dropped back against the pillows, his face paler than Dean thought he had ever seen it which just made the flush in his cheeks seem more pronounced. Sweat clung to his skin and Dean had never wanted to kiss him so much in his life.
Castiel could see Dean about to protest, he could almost hear the argument on his tongue, but to everyone’s surprise, Adam got there first.
Tentatively, Dean brushed Castiel’s hair back, more so that he could run his fingers through his husband’s, his mate’s hair than to tidy it. “You’ll stay with me, right?”
“Boys!” Rowena trilled from somewhere in the hallway, her tone caught between impatient and amused. “In your own time.”
There was a lot of blood and an unnatural gurgling noise that seemed to be coming from deeper than her throat. Dean practically tore his flannel off, shrugging his arms out of it and balling it up against the flow of blood. It was drenched in seconds and Dean heard himself growl in frustration. “Come on!” he snapped as though his annoyance alone would be enough to stem the blood.
There was no way to know who the duelling captain had been, but it must have been Cas. He’d said he’d help, he’d talked about the things he could do to stop Roman’s operation but they had depended on the efforts of others. Maybe he found that he didn’t have as much sway as he’d thought, maybe his plans had fallen through. It seemed too much of a coincidence that another naval captain would just happen to challenge Roman to a duel, after talking with Dean how best to rid the world of Richard Roman Enterprises.
The leather slipped to the floor, landing in a quiet pile as Cas deftly unclipped and untied the fastenings. The shirt beneath it had been white once, but now it was utterly saturated in filth, blood and sweat, practically indistinguishable from Dean’s skin. Cas’ nose wrinkled a little at the sight of it and it took him a few moments to discover its seam so he could peel it off his mate.
, able to appreciate for the first time how fine she looked in the water. He and Dean didn’t speak, there was nothing left to say even though Castiel found he had so many thoughts and feelings lurking just below the surface, if he’d opened his mouth to speak a word, they would have all tumbled out.
“I brought you straight here and your brothers have been ensuring we aren’t disturbed. I told them we’d face your parents when you were feeling stronger.”
“Why do you do it?” he asked and Dean arched an eyebrow in confusion. “Piracy, I mean. You have a beautiful ship, you could be a trader or a privateer even. You don’t seem like the other pirates I’ve encountered.”
“Alright, shut up and get in the car, Sammy,” Dean grumbled, stalking away from his brother, still wondering if he couldn’t just kill all the djinn and be done with it.
afraid to come out to his brother. The whole ‘journey of self-discovery’ that had started with him realising he spent a little too long watching Doctor Sexy for non-medical reasons and ended with him comfortable enough to have a relationship with a man (but not tell his brother) hadn’t exactly been a fun roller coaster of love and acceptance. His old man had drummed into them both how wrong that kind of thing was and Lisa hadn’t exactly helped when she’d kicked Dean out of their white picket fence because he’d come out to her. She was fine with it, no really, totally fine but she couldn’t quite reconcile that him also finding men attractive didn’t change his feelings for her. It must, she’d insisted and Dean had been too new to it to argue. Not that he’d particularly wanted to. He’d left and figured that he’d tell Sam one day...probably when it became necessary. If things had worked out between him and Benny or him and Aaron maybe he would have but it hadn’t so he hadn’t.
“It didn’t quite work that way,” he said eventually and there was a hint of a chuckle in his voice. “Given that our true forms exist beyond the physical plane, no - we’ve never gone around out of our gourds on pheromones begging for a knot.”
Castiel saw none of it. His eyes were fixed on the altar where the high priestess waited for him and beside her, the shape of the man he was about to marry. The trumpeters swelled and the anthem of Castiel’s homeland filled the temple as he and Sam stepped down the aisle towards the altar. There were murmurings of approval as he passed the guests, whispers exchanged behind hands, but all of it went over Castiel’s head. He found himself inevitably drawn to the man at the altar. Not that he could see much at a distance. Only a man, dressed in similar cream robes, but trimmed with the scarlet of House Winchester. There was fair hair and...and there was something impossibly familiar about the way he held himself.
Dean frowned, casting his mind back...he had misplaced some of the scent blockers recently, but he hadn’t noticed the missing books. That was Sam’s domain though, if Sam said they were missing, they were.
“The Eta Aquariids aren’t stars but yes. It’s not the ideal time,” Cas sighs and bites his lip again. Does he have to do it so often? Or is it just because Dean notices it that it seems so often? Either way, it doesn’t help. “We might not be able to see Mars at all but...I’d rather not wait given that it looks like it might be our last chance if things do go into lockdown.”
The space was wide, open and looking up at something that might have been a screen once, but had cracked, fractured and mostly fallen down. Still, Dean wasn’t looking at that, he was looking at the cars. He’d read about such things and he’d even seen a couple with his dad one time. Apparently, they could transport you from one place to another, with distance only limited by how tired you were. The idea had always fascinated Dean, the notion that you could just drive away from somewhere, that you wouldn’t have to cross the Fringes, you could just
In his arms, Dean felt Cas chuckle and he couldn’t help but lean in a little to nuzzle his neck, even though both his brothers were right beside them. Adam barely noticed, still frowning at the answer Dean had given.
“If he was going to hurt us he’s had loads of chances and he could have left us to...to...whatever the hell those things were.”
pulled away. He caught Castiel’s eye as he passed and let out a low whistle. “That was some trick you pulled there.” Reaching out, he clapped Castiel on his back. “I don’t think any of us could have gotten out of there that cleanly.”
Then they were back on their feet, doing what needed to be done as they passed out of range of the guns.
Dean pulled off, but covered Castiel in his hand, pumping him roughly as though he had taken it as a personal insult that he couldn’t finish with him in his mouth.
For all of Dean and Castiel’s ‘profound bond', it was Sam who called Cas out when Dean hadn’t noticed anything amiss at all. They were at breakfast, sitting at the table in the kitchen together chowing down on the pancakes Dean had made and Cas seemed to be doing little more than returning the mugs that had piled up in the war room. Dean grunted something that might have been a ‘Mornin’ Cas,’ if it could have been discerned around the mouthful of syrup and bacon he was currently working through. Sam, on the other hand, watched him for a moment before he called out, almost innocently, “Hey, Cas, you going somewhere?”
Wordlessly, Cas took the angel blade from Dean and drove it harshly into the djinn’s chest. Without even waiting to see the djinn fall, Cas pulled the blade back and moved onto the next one. He didn’t even slow down as he passed him, slicing the blade across its throat with such force it was practically a decapitation. Dean had to remind himself not to stare as Cas moved with deliberate, furious precision reminding them all why only the mightiest of Hell could challenge an angel.
Castiel looked outside again and nodded, “Yes. It has changed a great deal since we were last here, but this is the place.”
The challenge was obvious, but Balthazar never got the chance to voice it, interrupted by a knock at the door and the Captain’s steward, little more than a boy, stepping in and addressing Castiel, nervous in the presence of so many senior officers, said, “Mister Benjamin sends his compliments and requests your presence on deck, sir, coming up on a merchant ship, sir,” he added.
Dean Winchester, standing in the rigging with the sun beating down on him, looking as though he had stepped straight from the pages of a myth or legend. His head was thrown back and he was laughing, but at what Castiel couldn’t tell. But it didn’t matter.
Retribution was swift. It was surely only down to the lateness of the hour that they hadn’t brought the palace guard upon them with the noise they were making, ducking around the fountain, splashing each other in great waves before Clarence decided that they clearly weren’t playing for high enough stakes and he outright tackled Dean. They both fell back into the fountain, but it was enough to give them pause as they both stood up in the waist-deep water, laughing too much to be angry even though, despite their earlier insistence, they were both freezing.
But Cas didn't give Sam the chance to answer. “You know it has!” he snapped, angrier than Dean had ever seen him.
Castiel waved him off. “Yes, I know. You told me in your letters. Extensively. Why did you need to deliver the message in person?”
Dean took it with a nod, remembering to call her back before Andrea disappeared. “Hey, could you ask them to draw me a bath? Gotta look my best and all that,” he said with a bravado he didn’t quite feel, but Andrea just smiled at him and took herself off to find some servants.
He threw the powder into the centre of the trap, his grace flaring as his wings flexed against the movement. There was a blinding light, so bright it bled into Dean’s eyes even after he had covered them with his hands. Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone.
Dean has never in fact been a particularly vocal lover, preferring his body to do the talking for him, but Cas is taking him apart and he can’t do anything but groan Cas’ name. He’s begging but he doesn’t know what for. Cas’ tongue is hot against his length pressing up and curling around him sinfully. He can’t stop the moans and whimpers as he forces his hips to keep still under Cas’ grip, letting Cas control the pace with that glorious mouth of his. Cas looks up, blue eyes lock with green and then Dean is babbling. Honest-to-God babbling and Cas reaches up, giving Dean his fingers which he sucks into his mouth desperately.
A thrill thrummed through Castiel and he found himself momentarily wishing that Dean would remember this in a moment when he reacted to the tickets. Dean removed the pie, the coffee and then his eyes fell on the tickets. He looked up at Cas and then back down, reaching for them almost hesitantly. “What’s this?” he asked, to no one in particular, before he let out a long, low whistle, “Wow, fancy gig. You tryin’ to tell me something?”
“Then I think it a good thing she sails with you, I doubt the pirates will have the luck they had last time against two of you.”
But Cas isn’t so easily put off and he pulls himself around so he can straddle Dean’s lap. Twenty-four hours ago Dean would have died to have been this close but now he just wants to get away.
The afternoon rush died off but tall, dark and trench-coat was still there. Exactly there, Dean noticed, he didn’t seem to have moved even an inch, standing ramrod straight, still looking off into the middle distance. Dean unloaded the dishwasher, stacking cups on the shelf beside the coffee machine, but his eyes kept drifting back to the man. Curiosity finally, finally got the better of him and with a quick signal to Charlie, he stepped out into the street.
“I don’t know where I’ll go,” Castiel blurted out, “It’s not like I can go home but it’s all I know and I don’t even know the area so it’s not as if-”
“That does sound heavenly,” Castiel agreed and he opened his mouth to speak again but he paused, hearing something in the distance.
The port of Nassau was in sight, but it gave Castiel no pleasure. The boat was ready to take him in and most of the crew had gathered to see him off. None of it was helping Castiel say goodbye. There was an excessive level of hugging led by Garth for some reason. Jo hugged him, Charlie hugged him, everyone hugged him, even Benny. Dean didn’t touch him, but then he’d already decided he was going to row Castiel out himself, they would say their goodbyes on land. It delayed the inevitable, but both of them would take it.
“I would question any man’s orders that had us cruising around the Caribbean for no good reason while there is a war to be fought.”
He’d been so stupid. He’d allowed himself to be taken in by Dean and the warmth of the crew. The warmth was genuine but so was the heat of the flames that had consumed the merchant ship before it was finally extinguished beneath the waves. With a huff that sounded more like a groan, Castiel shifted in the cot, as though he could escape the myriad of images assaulting him.
Dean waved him away, “Yeah, yeah, look I’ll text you, okay? Now...get out of here,” he said, trying not to throw his brother too quickly, but wanting him as far away from Cas as humanly possible.
“You’re amazing,” Dean said, again, leaning in for a kiss, even though they had an audience and Sam was clearly impatient to get underway.
“Alright, I’ll check it out, Sam you wanna head back and signal the ship? Roman’s too far into the jungle, you’ll have to send the boats. It’ll take longer and you’ll have to wait ‘til it’s dark, but there’s no way we’ll get everything here on foot.”
Dean paused to reassure his brother, as he had done every single time Sam had voiced his concerns. They weren’t unfounded, but Dean knew what he was doing, and if Dean didn’t then Cas certainly did. He stopped walking and put his hands on Sam’s shoulders, looking into his face.
“Oh...” Dean can’t help but grin. It’s one of his favourite things about it too. “Wait...does that mean you’re not actually interested in the stars?”
“Wait...” Dean allows just a breath of space between them so he can scrub a hand over his face. He’s missed something. “Wait, what?”
The fingers are gone and Dean whimpers. He’s never whimpered before and he chases the air in front of him with his lips as though he can pull them back. But then they’re circling around the most private part of himself. Cas doesn’t push in, he just circles bringing delicious pressure against him. Dean wants more. So much more.
“You could at least pretend to help, Gabriel,” Castiel sighed, after double-checking that the few customers that remained were satisfied.
It was an easy promise to make now that Hell was sealed but Cas’ eyes bored into him and Dean realised that he had to mean it. It took him a moment to think on it but Cas was patient. His touch was grounding and Dean sighed. “Okay, Cas. From now on it’s just the two of us.”
Cas beamed at him and Dean could see the weight leave his shoulders. Cas leaned in and kissed him, his lips soft against Dean’s. Dean leaned into it and at that moment the baby chose that moment to kick.
“I said I would give you the Garden,” Queenie said, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the ground. “Why are you doing this?”
He didn’t maintain it though. When they stopped for the night, Castiel was the one who came to Dean, asking if he wanted to rest, if he had a preference for which watch he wanted and all Dean wanted to do was tell him to get lost, but he was persistent. He was as attentive as he’d ever been, though granted he seemed more hesitant to approach. The easy conversation, the connection over protecting Sam and Meg, the flirting, all of that was gone, as was Castiel’s smile. But still, he tried. Worse, it was working. Dean didn’t want it to be, he wanted to stay mad, and he was, but it was hard to keep his guard up when Castiel was acting the way he’d always acted. He was still the kind, considerate guy he’d always been. He was still the guy Dean had been crushing on when what Dean really wanted was for him to turn into a dick with wings and show them all why angels were the worst creatures in existence.
He could feel Cas’ smile in the dim light. “I love you too,” he whispered back as the two of them settled in beside their children, still gazing each other adoringly as they greeted their first night as a family.
Gabriel was beside him and he could feel him trying to crawl over to Castiel, no doubt to hold him down before they could seal the gates. But Castiel wasn’t going to let him. He flexed his wings and launched himself at the cave, letting the force of the returning souls take him further.
“It’s a myth,” Cas said, “Well...the horn itself is a myth. At least, I think it is. It’s said that Gabriel, the archangel, has a horn which can summon all angels to it. I don’t know if the horn itself ever existed but he devised a sigil which works in the same way.”
Sam dropped their backpacks down next to the fire and they landed with far greater weight than they had left the sector with. But Dean barely noticed it, scrambling to his feet so he could either hug his brother or punch him. He hadn’t quite decided which yet. In the end, he settled for both, pulling him in for a tight hug before he punched his shoulder a little harsher than he’d intended.
It was a fair question, Castiel thought, maybe he shouldn’t have assumed that Dean would instantly be on board with his plan, even though they had little other recourse. “Trust me, the archangel we will summon can be reasoned with.”
“They were true mates though, weren’t they?” Clarence asked, though his fingers were trailing through the water, sending ripples to where Dean leaned against the fountain.
“I think it’s wonderful,” Castiel said when it became clear Dean was waiting for a reply. In return, he was rewarded with a beautific grin that warmed Castiel to his very core as the night chill set upon them.
Not for the first time Adam glared at him as though he couldn’t quite believe Dean was the oldest and therefore the heir. “No, Dean, I didn’t mention the possibly mythical crook belonging to a demon that may not have ever existed as a means to end the very real war. Especially as it’s thought to be locked within Hell itself, assuming it exists at all. Sorry I didn’t instantly think to launch an expedition into Hell to find the crook, which, again, in case you didn’t catch it, might not exist, before recalling all the demons and having the gates of Hell sealed simultaneously across Purgatory and Earth.”
The two of them were so caught up in each other’s gaze, they didn’t notice Sam approach. By the time Castiel actually looked up, it had been clear that Sam had been clearing his throat to get their attention for some time.
The djinn that stood over her clutched at the crown of her head and pulled her up onto her feet, even though her legs shook from the effort beneath her.
It seemed an impertinent question, but Cas clearly didn’t think so. He frowned though, cocking his head to the side to consider Dean. “Could you be more specific? I was present at the creation of the universe and this world has a vast and storied history.”
deck disappeared as it exploded outwards, sending men, debris and everything else into the water. The chain reaction was almost instant, the explosions continued across the deck, the sails were ablaze, and it seemed almost cold the way
have secondary genders. Then you tell us that it hasn’t mattered for centuries but it sure as hell matters now that there’s only six angels left in heaven and they wanna bring up their numbers. So seeing as you’re the last omega out of them because
“They’re low in the water,” Castiel noted, taking in the size of the ship and how it seemed to be struggling to turn.
...I don’t even have a hat,” he added, thoughtfully, regaining his focus at last. He turned to the table he’d laid up in the cabin but looked a little deflated. “It’s...it’s not much.”
Dean could feel the blood drain away from him and his fingers gripped the railing beside the stairs so tightly he doubted the colour would ever return to his knuckles.
Queenie looked up to catch Dean’s eye, smiling at him as though she’d won an argument he was only vaguely aware they’d been having. He should say something but he settled for huffing a smile and turned his attention to the women on the rigs. One by one they slumped against him as he eased them down, disconnecting them from the various tubes the djinn had fed into them.
Castiel he threw an additional coin to the bewildered rowers and waited until he heard the first trill of the tin whistles before he hauled himself up the side, towards his own deck. His boots landed heavily on his own ship at last and for a moment he almost forgot to remove his hat and salute the quarterdeck, but the dazed salute from the gathered hands reminded him.
Roman was greeting his guests as they filed in and Castiel had naturally fallen into line. He took a breath to steady himself, he would have to be insulting but vague. If he was too direct he’d be removed for disrupting the proceedings. If he seemed to be insulting Roman outright he’d be dismissed as a drunkard and a fool. He was not going to lose this chance. Roman leaned in to shake the hand of the person in front of Castiel, any minute now the game would begin. He closed his eyes for just a moment, remembering Dean, the feel of his arms around him, the press of his lips beneath his ear and he felt calmer than he ever had.
Sam shook his head and Castiel squeezed the hand he was holding, wanting to reassure him. At length, Sam took a breath and looking Castiel square in the eyes he said, quietly, “It hurts, Cas. It hurts when I don’t take it.”
“Hear hear,” Zachariah called out, as the room applauded him a little more enthusiastically than they had done.
“So uh,” he cleared his throat not entirely sure as to what he’d been intending to say. “So angels didn’t go around out of their gourd on pheromones begging for a knot…” Dean trailed off because imagining Cas - his skin flushed, his ragged breath coming in short gasps, pleading to be knotted - that was not an image he needed right now. He might revisit it later given how tight his jeans had suddenly become but not right now.
sick...though it wasn't as if he had any frame of reference for such a thing. His equilibrium was damaged...somehow. He found himself unsteady on his feet at times, hungry too and not just as a passing fancy, he actually wanted to eat, but only certain foods and cooked in a particular way. Angelic taste-buds weren’t as complex as those of a human, but even so, Castiel could not remember ever desiring apples. Specifically, baked apples sprinkled with sugar,
Castiel couldn’t help the frisson of panic that ran through him, but Michael placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, soothing him, “Hey, it’s okay. It’s okay. Listen, I know my way around this place fairly well, so if you wanna get out I can get you out.” When Castiel didn’t move, didn’t breathe even, Michael’s hand came over his, holding it tightly. “You don’t have to decide now.”
He had expected Gabriel, at the very least, to laugh at them. He did not expect him to fold his arms and give a ‘hm’ of consideration. “Well, you’re insane,” he said, eventually, which deflated Dean somewhat. “I mean assuming you even get into Hell, and that’s a big
The smile that crept across Dean’s face couldn’t have been stopped and he positively beamed at his brother. “Yeah, Sam. Yeah, I think it might be.”
Castiel lay sprawled against the covers, looking up at Dean with hooded eyes and Dean would have loved to have savoured the moment and appreciate how utterly beautiful his husband looked, but there would be other times. For now he just needed to get their heavy robes off, they needed skin and Dean didn’t particularly care if he ripped his clothes in removing them, it’s not as though he would be needing them again. Beneath him, Castiel tore at his own robes, doing a much better job of casting them aside than Dean was.
But Dean, stupid, moronic, utterly gone on his best friend and had been since about five minutes after they’d met, Dean, in a move that proved him to be every inch the idiot his brother was always accusing him of being, had offered to drive them regardless.
Turning his attention back toward the world outside, Castiel realised that he was impatient for his brothers to arrive. Perhaps they had mistaken the hour, after all when one deals in timespans of millennia the individual minutes tended to get lost. He had not appreciated how lonely his service would be, looking out among the stars. As beautiful as they were, they were nothing compared to the quiet softness of Heaven and the company of his brothers. He had not thought angels could get lonely, but after a few thousand years with only the comets for conversation, and poor conversation at that, Castiel had found himself longing for even Gabriel’s irritating affections.
“Hey Clarence,” Michael said, after a while, “you wanna check out the market? Maybe get something to eat?”
“Hey, hey, calm down,” Dean said, kindly, his hand was still on the guy’s back and he rubbed it in soothing circles, though he wasn’t entirely sure why. Dean wasn’t one for physical assurances or affection, but something about the man drew him in and he rested his other hand on the man’s arm, purely because he could. “It’s ok, you’re ok. My name is-” he caught himself just in time for his mind to go blank, “Michael,” he said, unsure why the unfamiliar name should spark into his head like that but it served its purpose. “What’s yours?”
In response, Castiel pulled a small piece of paper from his pocket and slid it across the table so Balthazar could read it. He did so more than once before he put it down and raised his fingers to the bridge of his nose, as though he were trying to fight off a tension headache. “Perhaps you better tell me what happened.”
“And you’ll get neither,” Balthazar sighed dramatically, his hand over his heart, “We’ve been through too much you and I. I’ll see you hoisting your own flag and I’ll still call you Cassie, but-” he added, a necessary concession, “I promise only when we’re alone.” He winked at Alfie who just about managed to stifle his laugh before Castiel glared at him from under the hat Alfie positioned on his head.
“Look man, I know I’ve not known you long, hardly anything given that you’re...y’know, like a billion years old-”
Dean threw himself down on his bed dramatically, but there was no one there to see him so why not? It was alright for his parents, he thought, thinking back to how his mother had hugged him and cried that morning. They’d met each other several times and knew they would be happy before their wedding. Even if they hadn’t been true mates, they’d at least scent bonded before the marriage negotiations were finalised. Dean hadn’t met his betrothed once yet, negotiations had kept them apart and so they wouldn’t actually meet until they were at the altar. Not that he wanted to meet him anyway. It was nothing personal, but all he had of Prince Castiel was the formal courtship letter that might have been written by anyone to confirm his permission for the arrangement. Not that the prince had received much more from Dean. They knew nothing about each other, they certainly wouldn’t have chosen each other if they’d been given a choice but that was sort of the point. Neither of them had had a choice. Dean tried to imagine Prince Castiel, which wasn’t easy given that he’d never actually seen the man, sitting in the chapel right now. Was he happy to be here? Was he as thrilled with the situation as his mother had apparently been; quite the coup marrying a Novak to a Winchester. Was he reconciling himself to his fate? Was he praying that he’d be a good husband? Dean snorted if he’d chosen to spend his last day as a free man in a church it’s doubtful they had anything in common.
“True, Raphael and I have never quite seen eye to eye. But, all of us have an unspoken agreement to not interfere with the other’s business, particularly when it concerns Michael.”
Dean reached up and placed a hand on his brother’s arm, gesturing to Castiel with the other. “Hey, Sam, meet Castiel, my mate.”
“Thank you,” Roman said, as though he were surprised to receive such a response from his carefully curated guest list. Across the room Crowley caught Castiel’s eye and seemed to snort into his wine, Castiel rolled his eyes in return, surprised to be sharing a moment like this with Crowley of all people.
“Forgive us,” Castiel smiled, “Actually, I’ll need your help to gather the ingredients I’ll need for the spell, if I give you a list do you think you’ll be able to acquire them?”
Dean looked over at him, but whatever would be said between them was interrupted from a hail above them.
Castiel summoned every ounce of strength that he had but even then he couldn’t move the archangel. It was an act of desperation that he had even tried.
“You look like hammered crap, Sam. Besides, you’ve already taken one dose of djinn poison so shut up and help me get this damned thing in my arm.”
“Yeah,” Dean’s voice sounded raspier than when he’d climbed out of his own coffin and had to spit out lungfuls of grave dirt. He felt as awful as he had that day too. The day Cas had forced his soul back into his broken body.
Sitting up, he rubbed his face. This sucked, and he couldn’t see it sucking any less in the immediate future. His eyes fell on a package he hadn’t noticed in his haste to act like a disgruntled child. It was plain, unassuming and left on his bed among cushions and pillows that might have disguised it. It was only now Dean was looking right at it that he could see it and he frowned. This might have been what Benny had been talking about, something to pass the time. He unwrapped it and stared at the contents in disbelief. Clothes. Plainclothes, plain boots and a small pouch of money. Just the sort of thing a prince wouldn’t wear. The sort of thing nobody would expect a prince to wear. Dean turned the fabric over in his hand. If a prince wore this he’d become faceless, nameless. The fragrant salve wrapped in the cloth would mask his scent.
“You’ll be killed,” Sam said, weakly, though Dean could tell it was his final attempt at dissuading them. He had nothing else.
He turns his attention to the bag and sees that Dean has left him breakfast. The thought makes his heart soar.
“Ready?” he asked, but Castiel was saved from having to answer. What answer could there be? No, he wasn’t ready. No, he was making a terrible mistake. Somewhere out in the city his true mate was being married and Castiel wanted nothing more than to find him. He thought about running as the doors opened, as Sam walked him in, as they paused at the start of the aisle, right up until the doors closed behind him and there was no possibility of him leaving. Not without making even more of a scene than he would have initially.
He was beautiful, breathtaking, his hands braced on Dean’s chest as he allowed himself to rise and fall, Dean’s knot catching on each thrust. Reaching between them Dean took Castiel’s cock in hand, trying to pump him in time with the rhythm Castiel had set, but it was becoming harder and harder to stay coordinated as heat pooled deep in his gut. Their thrusts were messy, desperate but then Castiel leaned in and laid his claim on Dean’s neck and Dean’s climax hit him harder than any he’d had. His knot caught, locking them together and as the pain in his neck subsided into bliss, Dean pulled Castiel down, barely taking the time to scent him before he made a mark of his own. Castiel’s breath hitched as he painted the space between them white with his own release, and Dean fell back against the pillows, pulling Castiel down with him, glad that they were joined together because he wanted to be so much closer.
Raising a glass, Castiel took a sip of the wine and gave a wicked smile that was totally at odds with the innocence of his tone, “I was hoping to have a lot more than dinner with a pirate.”
“That’s all I’ll need,” she shouted back, which earned a good-natured cheer from those manning the cannons.
Dean leaned in and kissed him, wondering if he’d ever tire of how soft Cas’ lips were under his. It was a foolish question, he knew he wouldn’t. “You do help, Cas. You help so much and you don’t even know it.”
Clarence looked down at himself and then up at Dean, his shoulders sagging in relief before he gave his own little smile, “I suppose not.”
When he glanced up, he realised that Dean had caught him staring, but before he could explain Dean just nodded. “Yeah. Roman shot him. Hasn’t been able to walk since.” Once again came the sense of dread, settling into Castiel’s gut. Dean shook his head, grimly and followed Bobby in. “That’s what happens when you tell Dick Roman he can’t do something.”
“Maybe...there was a problem on your end, it really was nothing to do with us,” the man said with every semblance of sincerity.
“Beyond that, we’ve just found some old warding sigils the Men of Letters used to use way back when. They might not help all that much, but...”
“Oh I am,” he continued, with the air of someone who knew exactly what he was doing and enjoying every moment of it. From an inside pocket he consulted a pocket watch, “I’ve been captain of
.” Unsurprisingly Sam turned in unison as Dean did. “Thank you,” he said, quietly, “but I’ll be alright.”
Dean nodded, with a resigned kind of satisfaction. “Tell Meg to tell him I appreciate it.” He leaned back in the chair as Sam started on the dishes. It was weird to feel comforted by a guy he’d never met, a guy he knew barely anything about, only a name, ‘Clarence’ and the fact that he spent as much time looking out for Sam’s friend Meg as Dean did for Sam. Not that he knew much about Meg either, he’d impressed upon Sam the importance of sharing as little identifying information as possible and it seemed Clarence had said the same to her.
Dean caught the moan as it fell from him, devouring it with a soft groan of his own. Their touches were desperate, clinging to each other for all they were worth. Castiel had surely never been so hard and when Dean reached between them, loosing the ties that bound him, he couldn’t stop himself from crying out at the touch. Tame though it was.
One of the laptops is blinking. With a sigh, he moves to check it. He might as well just before he calls down for breakfast. Just to make sure it isn’t anything important.
“Blessed be the Norm, brother,” Benny greeted Dean, almost pointedly, as Dean clocked in for his shift. Dean arched an eyebrow, already completely done with the Norm for the day. He was about to make some wry comment about his choice of greeting when his fellow security guard caught his eye and gestured, discreetly, to the back of the office.
It was like a time capsule, a glimpse into the past they could only know of in the vaguest possible sense. There were so many screens, Dean wondered what they had all done. There was one that almost covered a wall, there was a smaller, handheld one and then a handful of even smaller, pocket-sized ones. Cas explained what they did but Dean had no idea what the “internet” was and the idea of being able to send messages across the world with no delay was so foreign that in the end, Cas gave up.
Of course he’d known it was coming. What can Dean Winchester offer someone as perfect as Castiel Novak?
Thankfully, their shopping trip is not as manic as Dean expects it to be. He can see that people are starting to panic and they pass several carts laden with toilet paper and pasta. He’s not sure why toilet paper specifically, but he doesn’t question it, focusing instead on his own cart.
a frigate. We were pulled from blockade duty to sail halfway across the world just because Roman’s ships were sinking and you’re one of the best pirate catchers in the service. Not even your brothers can help you against that kind of power, and to be frank, I don’t think they’d even want to.”
“The Kingsguard,” Sam confirmed for him before he could finish the question. “And it looks like Dad came with them.”
One of the younger men broke apart from the group and stepped towards them, a little hesitant but definitely moving towards them.
The angels weren’t coming to take Castiel away and he’d received several letters from Gabriel assuring him of that fact. He really didn’t need to write as many as he had but he’d smuggled letters for Sam in with them and Sam had taken them with flushed cheeks and a plea that Castiel wouldn’t say anything to Dean.
Dean at the wheel, laughing and carefree. The kindest, most genuine man Castiel had ever met. A man Castiel had considered a friend. More than a friend. Hadn’t he been on the very edge of admitting that he was...at the very least
By the time the sun had set and Bobby called them up to stop lollygaggin’ and help out, Dean’s voice was hoarse from talking. Castiel had hung on every word, feeling the entire range of emotions he was capable of in a single conversation. He had been nostalgic for Dean’s childhood, grateful when Bobby had taken them in, devastated when Roman had arrived and angry, silently furious, to learn of the navy’s culpability.
Getting into the long-abandoned vehicle was a little harder than Dean had originally thought, however. The door was rusted to the point it was almost indistinguishable from the rest of the body, but Dean could just about make out the seam.
“Uh, yeah, that’s exactly right,” Sam stuttered, but Castiel didn’t mind when Dean was looking at him with such open pride.
he'd picked up veggie mince instead of proper mince. He'd said it was all they had but Dean didn't know if that was true or if his brother were simply ramping up his efforts to try and turn Dean vegetarian.
He leaned back in the chair he’d been asked to wait in. The halls of Admiralty House seemed even more impressive than usual, but that was probably because Castiel had spent the last weeks between a pirate ship and a fishing boat. He hadn’t had an appointment, of course, he hadn’t. It wasn’t as though he could have let them know in advance when to expect him back, but the footman had told him to take a seat and the Admiral would be with him soon. The formality was almost irksome. Castiel couldn’t quite figure out how he’d never noticed it before. It was something of a revelation to realise he’d been so steeped in convention he’d never appreciated how stifling it was.
” he called, cupping Cas face. Cas eyes were open but he seemed to be staring past Dean at something far beyond them, far beyond anything in this world. “Cas?” Dean breathed, tapping his face gently, relieved to the point of passing out himself when Cas’ eyes seemed to focus.
. He would send Balthazar out as soon as he arrived to deliver the challenge. Roman wouldn’t retract his insult and he wouldn’t apologise for the blow. Even if Zachariah intervened with Roman he wouldn’t be able to convince him, what would be in it for Roman save for a loss of face? And the Admiral wouldn’t even broach it with Castiel, no man could suffer such a blow and stand for it. In a way it was a shame Raphael hadn’t arrived a day earlier, he and Castiel didn’t exactly get on, but Raphael would never have let such an insult to their family stand.
“Hm, I hope not.” Dean brushed away imaginary wrinkles from Castiel’s coat. He stepped back to make sure Castiel looked presentable, though Castiel knew that there was no disguising the flush in his cheek or the haze of bliss that surrounded him. Dean lifted Castiel’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles, “At least, not before you give me your answer.”
As soon as his feet touched the deck, Castiel found himself frowning. They weren’t moving. The ship had weighed anchor, but a quick glance out of the window showed that they were still at sea. He stood still for a moment, taking stock, but no- they definitely weren’t moving. There was only the natural gentleness of the waves, barely enough to move such a ship. From the movement alone Castiel knew that it was a calm day, instinctively recording such observations even though he had no need to navigate them himself.
A phone buzzes but they ignore it. There’s nothing happening that can’t wait. Not when Castiel retrieves a condom and the lube. Another buzz of another phone, or is it the same one? It hardly seems important as Castiel sinks into Dean’s welcoming body. The sounds Dean makes are glorious. The sounds they make together are a chorus.
“I can’t decide whether to write my report to the admiralty before or after I see the admiral. Seeing as he’s technically my commanding officer while I’m stationed here, I should address the report to him, but I don’t think it would hurt to make a copy of it...” Castiel trailed off, aware that he had lost Dean at some point during the relatively brief vocalisation of his thoughts. “Dean? Are you alright?”
“I mean, I’ll take it if you want, but you’ll have a hard job escaping given that we’re in the middle of the ocean.”
It didn’t feel like home though and with a sigh, he pulled a blank sheet of paper towards him and started ordering his thoughts.
“It’s a little off our course, brother,” Benny said, having appeared from somewhere, looking out through his own glass.
It is enough for Dean to go from almost to right there in a heartbeat and his hips stutter as Cas pulls him in tight, holding him there and whispering what might be endearments into his ear. He can feel himself pumping into Cas. There are strong arms around him, but beyond that there is nothing but the waves of bliss crashing into him. He can’t breathe and he doesn’t want to breathe; he just wants to stay like this always.
Castiel turned and arched an eyebrow at Ishim, the only outward sign that the man was taking liberties he did not possess.
He moved his hand to Cas’ abdomen, hovering above it for a moment, looking to Cas for permission which was immediately given. Enthusiastically given. Dean placed his hand down, feeling the cloth of Cas’ shirt beneath his hand. It didn’t feel any different but everything was different. Slowly, Dean leaned over and placed a reverent kiss beneath his hand, laying his head gently across Cas like a pillow, looking up into the endless blue eyes which seemed to sparkle all the more for the tears there, shed and unshed.
The gates were opened and the king rode in, leading the considerable numbers behind him. He slid from the horse, slipping his helmet off and looking around the courtyard with open disapproval. Dean glanced over his shoulder, only those who were already on duty stood to attention. But then, Dean supposed, they’d hardly rung the bell to have the entire guard turned out.
When Dean is fully seated, he drops his forehead to meet Cas’ as he kisses him. This time the kiss is filthy. He teases his tongue into Cas’ mouth, sucking at the lip that Cas has taunted him with so often and then when Cas is beyond himself, Dean rolls his hips and grinds into him.
“Probably just discussing our next moves,” Castiel sighed, quietly so that only Balthazar could hear him. Balthazar did not look convinced. “Set the mainsail there,” he said, a little louder this time, “We might as well make the most of this wind while we have it. Then send the hands to dinner, they’ll need it for when we catch up with her.”
Taking Dean’s hand in his, Castiel kissed his fingertips and said, looking at him openly and honestly, “you are more than entertaining. You are everything.”
Cas’ hand reached up to cover Dean’s and for a moment they both seemed to revel in the warmth of the other’s touch. “Of course, Dean.”
“Then neither of you answer your Goddamned phones so we floor it through the night to see if everything’s okay and we find the car...” he looked back at Baby which still bore the damage from the night before. In the cold light of day, Dean winced to look at her with her smashed rear windscreen and one door ripped clean off. “So yeah, we came. We were worried about you both.”
Sam looked between Cas and Dean while Adam grabbed a lens to sweep over the field. “That’s all of them,” he said, in wonder, “That’s all the warding.”
Dean caught his eye as Sam gestured to the seats but before he could say anything, Dean grinned, “Roomy, isn’t she?”
Castiel’s back was aching from standing to attention for so long, but he wouldn’t drop his posture, not even to alleviate the pain a little. “As he should, you are the admiral after all.” It was a tedious game, dancing around the issue, unable to challenge each other directly, but at least Castiel could see from the twitch in Zachariah’s eye that he was having a far harder time keeping his cool than Castiel was. The thought only calmed him further. “Though he might be less inclined to share our personal correspondence with you.”
Which was ridiculous seeing as these were his usual clothes and he knew he looked good. Well, he’d never had any complaints. Plenty of compliments though. Given that he usually just made sure his clothes were free of monster gunk and he’d pick someone up with a winning smile and some of his better lines. Usually women but that was ‘coz he didn’t want Sam to see him with a guy.
“No, but he feels like he shouldn’t rest when there’s something to do and,” Adam waved his hand around in a gesture several years older than himself, “there’s always something that needs doing here.”
Dean held out his hand and Castiel took it, allowing himself to be steered towards the horse that Dean had obviously decided they would share. “You’re so amazing, you know that?” he breathed against Castiel’s ear, but Castiel only rolled his eyes.
Dean grinned as he took Castiel’s hand, following Sam out across the courtyard. If they hadn’t known something was going on they would have noticed as soon as they left the stables. A crowd had gathered at one of the ramparts, looking out across the plains behind the fortress. Castiel felt Dean’s hand tighten around his, but Castiel was already looking up to the sky. It was clear, or at least, as clear as it ever got; whatever was happening, it wasn’t the demons. Besides, if they’d managed to get to the rear of the fortress they wouldn’t waste their time coming back for it, they’d press on laying waste to whatever they could find beyond it.
The moment Sam smiled, Dean knew the argument was over. He’d known he’d win the moment Sam had opened his mouth, he always did, but he’d never trivialise Sam’s worries by dismissing them. If the positions were reversed Dean wouldn’t have let Sam go either.
Castiel definitely did not flush at something as minor as a smile and definitely did not reach into one of the refrigerators for the slice of pie he’d stashed there earlier, ensuring that nobody else could see it and therefore order it before this moment.
It was worth swallowing his pride to apologise so readily, Castiel thought, if it meant that Dean would smile at him like that again.
When he stepped back into the room, Cas was gathering some clean clothes that the servants had already unpacked for them when they’d gone out with Sam and Adam.
“How long are we going to continue this fool’s errand, wasting time and rations looking for one lousy pirate? Shall we starve to death in the endeavour?”
He was already turning away when he felt Cas’ hand on his arm pulling him back, gently. “Forgive me,” he said quietly and Dean regretted how close they were standing. Cas sighed, “I don’t mean to be difficult. I’m grateful for your help.”
Castiel would have tapped his hat if it were not tucked under his arm, but instead, he bowed his head a little and stepped away to the buffet table where no doubt the finest of canapes and h’or doeuvres were laid out. It took just one look for the bile to return as Castiel recognised the most of the foods as those that Dean had pointed out as having come from his island. He shouldn’t have expected anything else. Still, he would not partake of it, instead filling a small plate with what things had not been bought off the backs of Dean’s home.
” Dean hissed, “What the- When did- The hell are you talking about, wife?!” He opened the closest of Baby’s doors only to slam it again immediately after, for little more than the satisfaction of the noise. It did little to take the edge off and he scratched at one of his arms, fruitlessly. He felt uncomfortable in his own skin, antsy in a way he couldn’t remember being for a long time and he didn’t like the way Sam was looking at him. Like there was something funny about all this while Cas was out there, God knows where and all they had to go on was a load of dead djinn and Cas’
Cas pressed their foreheads together, his soft smile totally at odds with the way his thighs rested against Dean’s legs. “I’ve missed you,” he sighed, “I haven’t seen you since this morning.”
They stared each other down for a moment, but short of calling him out there wasn’t much Zachariah could actually do. In the end, he drew back, scowling, “Just remember you sail in the morning.”
At least until his master called. Not that he called so much as he scorched the sky with lightning. Lightning that streaked through the otherwise sunny day and brought the rain with it. Lightning that forked into three distinct flashes all of which struck Cas’ abdomen.
Beside him, Cas’ wings bristled and he rubbed at his nose, sniffing against the stifling smell of smoke laden with sulphur. It was a far cry from the gardens Dean had promised him the run of back home and not for the first time since their journey had started did Dean feel a pang of guilt for the life he was bringing his mate to. The week they had spent during Cas’ first heat, with nothing else to do but lie on silk sheets and bring pleasure to each other seemed very far away right now.
Silence stretched out between the three of them, during which they did little more than exchange glances. Cas looked worried, Sam just looked confused, occasionally opening his mouth only to close it again a moment later, unable to quite voice what was going on in his mind.
“Once the storm clears we’ll return him to his owner,” Cas called patiently from the couch, reading Dean like the open book he’d always been to him.
“Humanity may have incurred His wrath, but He certainly never acted upon it. He hasn’t been around for a long, long time. The Tribulation...it wasn’t even called that at the time, we called it The Apocalypse. The End of Days. Angels and Demons went to war and earth was the battleground.” Cas sighed, as though the very memories weighed him down. “I didn’t want to fight. Well- I mean, I
Under normal circumstances, Castiel would have curled up with Dean and stayed with him until he inevitably fell asleep. He didn’t need to sleep and there was plenty to figure out in the twilight hours, but biology had other ideas. Carrying a nephilim
They carried on though Dean noticed out of the corner of his eye Cas adding things to what had become 'their' pile. He tried not to think too hard about what was going in because popping a boner while on a grocery run was hardly his idea of a good time.
was trying to move off, aiming for the relative safety offered by the fog of bad weather. Balthazar and Castiel exchanged mutual frowns.
“Oh,” Castiel paused, considering that he hadn’t actually formed an opinion on his new brother-in-law. “He is very tall,” he said, eventually, but he chuckled when Dean’s face fell a little. “Dean, I’m sure he is a wonderful person, after all, you are the most wonderful person I know and you like him.”
It was still day, the sun had not yet set, but it seemed much later under the black clouds that choked the sky, belching forth from over the hills. The demons had obviously set up a camp of their own just beyond the horizon and where the demons went, hellfire followed.
He looked almost mournful, and in a strange way, Castiel found himself thinking about Roman again. How Dean had ended up in a life he didn’t want because of Roman’s profits. It was surely the least of Roman's crimes, but it made the list.
“I know,” Sam said, allowing Dean to pull him into an embrace, “Castiel did a wonderful job. He really looked after me.” Sam’s hand rested on Cas’ shoulder for a moment, but as happy as Dean was to be reunited with them, he didn’t give them much time before going straight to the heart of the matter.
Several heads turned to look at them, hearing the unmistakable insult towards their host. Roman’s smile became strained, but he didn’t let the facade drop. Instead, he laughed, maybe a little too loudly, but he stepped closer and dropped his voice so they could not be overheard.
, I’m not angry with you.” Dean hesitated. He wasn’t that great at expressing feelings, though declaring his love for Cas had become commonplace, still, he’d hoped that the love that had welled within him when he’d realised everything that Cas had done for Sam was intense enough that Cas knew it.
fight in my place. But you...” he let his thumb trail across Cas’ cheek, “If you’re here and you’re safe, you’ll be helping me way more than if you were out fighting by my side.”
And track you that way...so you’re hoping to hide, stop suppressing it and they won’t be able to track you...” he glanced back at Dean though Dean wasn’t sure why; he had nothing to offer. “There’s gotta be something in all this, right? I mean, if not on angels specifically then something...” he asked, waving a hand in the vague direction of the bunker’s library.
It was Benny who called everyone to attention, perfectly aware that Dean was down and down for the rest of the night.
He looked over at Dean, the Prince, his mate and smiled, warmth swelling within him at the mere sight of him. If this was a progress, Dean would be smiling instead of the tight, drawn look that shadowed his features now. He would have shown off the kingdom, pulling Castiel away from whatever official functions they needed to attend in favour of showing him the fields or the rivers. He’d want to show Castiel everything, especially the dark corners where they could make out until someone noticed they’d gone missing and came looking for them.
” Instinctively, Dean turned at the sound of his name, relief flooding through him when he saw Cas crossing the courtyard towards him. Cas had been in no danger, still, there was something undeniably reassuring about knowing he was safe. After the things Dean had seen, the stench and blood that came with a battle, seeing Cas was like a breath of fresh air. He’d let Sam go and melted into Cas’ arms before he’d even made the conscious decision to do so. Sam let him go and Cas held him, holding him close, refusing to let go. He needed this as much as Dean did.
Dean is too far gone for such things to make a difference now and he starts pressing with a second finger as he leans in and whispers into Cas’ ear. “You too.” It sounds a lot less poetic when he says it. “I think of you. Only you.”
Exchanging a look Dean and Cas were quiet for a moment. So quiet that Rowena added with a sigh, “I don’t know for certain, but then given how little we know about this whole business it was just a thought-”
“Hm, yeah, that’s true. My mother used to tell me stories about the Winchester fire wielders. You know the legends say the magic started with a Novak and Winchester mated pair, I think that’s why they chose a Novak for the Prince, y’know. All that romantic stuff about mating and magic.”
“Other angels,” Castiel said, grimly and stepped away. For the first time, it was him to put the distance between the two of them.
“Sam,” Cas announced by way of introduction even though it could hardly have been anyone else. He accepted the call holding the phone out between them and putting the speaker on angled it towards Dean.
By the time Dean opened the cabin door to him, Castiel looked better than he had done for any official naval function. From the way Dean looked at him, he was obviously in complete agreement.
Cas shouted something from his trap at her in her own language, not one Dean recognised. She replied in kind and got a sharp kick to the head for her trouble.
Bobby had held his hands up then, slowing Dean’s thoughts before they could overrun him. “All I know is that Roman duelled some navy captain and lost. But...from what they were saying, I think Roman got the other guy too.”
Sam snorted, looking around for somewhere to sit before he decided to take a cushion beside the fire. “Oh yeah,
And then, in barely more than a whisper, but no less assured for it, he heard Dean murmur, “Stay with me.”
“This isn’t a debate, Cas,” Dean snapped right back at him, “There’s no way we’re letting you go out there on your own. We can help, you know we can.”
“We don’t feel the cold,” he grinned, just as he thrust both hands into the fountain and splashed a veritable wave of freezing water over Clarence.
"Cas?" Dean nudged him with his leg and Cas looked back at him suddenly, his eyes wide as though he'd missed something. "Hey… You okay?"
He curls Cas’ fingers into his palm and moves them to his lips so he can leave a lingering kiss there and
Dean gave something that sounded like a ‘hm’ of satisfaction, but he finally waved his hand. “Don’t worry about it.”
Sam had suggested therapy and Dean had almost ended him there and then. What the hell was the point in him pushing himself to open up if his stupid brother made stupid suggestions like that?
The two of them lay in their bed, their bodies arched around the two additional bodies between them. Dean’s hand trailed patterns through Cas’ hair even as the two of them let their eyes linger on the perfect beings beside them.
At that Dean could only blush harder. Cas looked so worried, his touch was so tender. He had been the prisoner for the djinn for days and his only concern was that Dean was a little red in the face.
It had been an easy thing for Dean to promise, that he would protect his mate and their child whatever may come. In practice, he wasn’t entirely sure what he could reasonably do. Where could they reasonably go? Their best bet was some small place beyond his father’s kingdom. Most of it had been devastated by Hell, but there were some pockets of civilisation that remained. They’d have to be careful though, Heaven would never stop looking for them, nor would Hell for that matter...actually...neither would his father but he at least had a finite lifespan. It wasn’t the most comforting of thoughts and it was probably a testament to how hopeless the situation was that the only sliver of hope Dean could hold out for was that one day his father would die and maybe Sam wouldn’t hunt them as mercilessly.
Castiel barely saw Dean for the rest of the day, hardly even catching a glance of him across the deck.
There were muffled voices on the other side of it but Dean’s ears had singled out the sound of a key turning in the lock. His grip on the sword tightened, this was it. The moment where he was called to defend all the promises he had made to Cas, only death would separate them though he had not thought that prospect would make itself known quite so soon. The door flung open as Dean raised the sword, but thank God for angelic agility, Cas had grabbed Dean’s arm prevented the strike before he could land it.
Several of the nobles nearby looked up in alarm as their new king let out a pained groan. It was probably something he’d eaten. Even though food had yet to be served.
Dean didn’t recognise the groan that escaped him. A needy, stifled thing he had never heard from himself before as he crossed the room and pinning Castiel against the door frame kissed him with all the heat and passion that had been building between them since they had scented each other in the side chapel. Even so, he could feel Castiel’s smile against his lips. “You like that, alpha?” Castiel breathed, nipping at the shell of Dean’s ear. “You like the thought of me carrying your pups?”
Cas didn’t look in the least bit surprised. “I’d remind you he was your brother before he was my boyfriend.”
He takes his time. He wants to know every inch of Cas’ body, wants to commit every sound, every taste to memory. If this is a dream (and there’s still a part of him that thinks it must be) Dean’s going to make it the best damned dream he’s ever had.
“Hi...uh...yeah, I’m Sam, Prince Sam,” he added, realising that Castiel had no idea who it was that had been sent to accompany him. “I’m Dean’s younger brother.”
It would take more than a few days aboard a foreign ship to undo a lifetime of sleeping in four-hour shifts. Castiel did not require the familiar chime of the ship’s bell to wake up exactly when he needed to, though he inevitably found himself a little disoriented to wake naturally and in the spare cot of a captain’s cabin that was not his own. How Dean could run a ship without the strict timekeeping of the Navy, Castiel would never know and when he’d asked, Dean had just laughed.
“Be safe,” Castiel breathed, unable or unwilling to pretend he wasn’t begging. But Dean only smiled and kissed him again, slower this time, softer.
Balthazar turned back to Castiel, hesitating when he caught sight of something over the captain’s shoulder. Castiel glanced back with him, but only saw Ishim in conversation with some officers near the taffrail.
Despite it all, Dean laughed. Cas caught his eye as the shirt passed over his face. “I never would have thought there’d be a boring way for you to take my clothes off.”
Castiel reached up and covered Dean’s hand with his own, holding it there, firmly. “Dean, I am never leaving your side again.”
“That’s enough,” Castiel snapped before Meg could say whatever it was she had opened her mouth to say. Dean caught his eye, wanting to say something more, but instead Castiel nodded to the space behind them.
His tone was even, but his enigmatic words caught Dean’s attention. Something that felt rather like dread settled in his stomach, heavy and cold.
“I didn’t do very well at it,” Castiel said, dryly. “I tried to get others onside but...nobody would listen. I was...” he sucked in a harsh breath that seemed to rattle around them, “I was forced to kill a number of my brothers. In the end they declared me a renegade, I was hunted by both demons and angels until some humans trapped me and took me away for their own purposes. Even in those days there were facilities to study the creatures destroying the planet, they were primitive but...they were well warded.”
sure, Cas had agreed. Dean figured it was worth driving cross-country just to see Cas smile like that.
“And I’ll still need your help managing the men,” Sam said. “There’s going to be a lot of rebuilding to do and you can bet your ass we’re going to be the ones to lead it. I’ve already started drawing up some plans but I’m going to still need my right-hand man.”
with their guns trained on them, the other ship seemed to be caught behind it, looking as though it would swing around and catch
Obligingly, Castiel keeps his position, feeling Dean tremble beneath him. He can hear Bobby shouting down the phone and even if he can’t make out the words, he knows they’re in trouble. They missed check-in. If Bobby knew
The man smirked, “You think you don’t?” He held his gaze, pointedly, until Castiel conceded the point. “So long as you don’t get in the way you can go where you like.”
Cas opened his eyes but before he said anything Dean could see the sadness behind them. “You would have every right to be, I-”
The guard tapped the other man on the shoulder and stepped away discreetly, no doubt there were a myriad of things he had to do before the ceremony started.
Dean was lying exactly where Castiel had left him. He pushed himself up a little on his elbows when Castiel drew near and beamed at him. “Oh thank God, you brought food.” As soon as the plate was within arm’s reach, Dean took it, while Castiel sat beside him and they ate in silence. Castiel cleared up in silence, he took off his shirt in silence and he settled beside Dean in silence.
Behind them, the door to the garage opened again and Cas stepped in, though his smile faded when he saw Sam’s expression. “Sam? Are you alright?”
There was a knock at the door behind them and Castiel froze, but Dean didn’t seem to mind, even though at that moment his lips were quite firmly wrapped around Castiel’s cock, Castiel’s hand gripping into his hair as he tried to stop himself thrusting forward into the welcoming heat of Dean’s mouth. Dean didn’t pull off, instead he made a low, ‘hm?’ in the back of his throat, a trick which got the attention of whoever was calling him and made Castiel throw his head back against the door, trying to stifle a moan against the vibrations the sound made around him.
“The old barracks,” Castiel muttered, checking that the room was secure, but nobody had been here for some time. “One of Adam’s hiding places. He gave me a tour of his nooks while we waited for you and Sam to come back sometimes. These barracks were used when there was an army large enough to justify its construction. Before Sam took over and brought everyone into the castle."
Dean did not release Castiel’s hand for a moment. Not as they ascended the steps to the throne, not even when they took their seats, facing the assembled nobles. Even then he reached into the gap between them, taking Castiel’s hand firmly and refusing to let it go. Castiel found he couldn’t quite look away from where their hands joined, only doing so to steal a look at his new husband, usually finding him looking right back, staring at him in open adoration.
Dean had no answer. There could be no answer, nothing beyond the desperate moans that told them both Castiel had discovered a kink Dean had until this moment not known he had.
“G’night, Dean,” Sam called, interrupting the train of his thoughts. He sighed, “Blessed be the Norm.”
Cas had been right. They were quick. It was hard not to be when the angel felt so good around him, canting their hips together, stroking them firmly, murmuring holy words in long-forgotten languages that sounded so sinful when his voice dropped as low as it did. Still, Dean held off. He forced himself to hold off until the air around them seemed to crackle, the car rocking from more than just their increasingly ragged movements. Cas threw his head back and Dean wanted to claim his neck with his lips more than he wanted to breathe, but he wouldn’t move, determined to watch. Cas’ eyes snapped open, unseeing, glowing brighter than the sun as he cried out. Dean didn’t so much feel Cas’ release as he saw it, when the shadow of his wings, something Dean had only ever seen in these moments, unfurled around them as something that could only be described as ‘light’, even though it had no form, consumed them and burst outwards, sending a tremor for miles around.
Castiel waited until he was out of sight before he returned to Sam, closing the door carefully behind him, locking it for good measure. Sam hadn’t moved, still frozen in the exact position that Castiel had disturbed him in. He did not know Sam well, certainly not well enough to accurately read his face, but he thought he looked frightened. He was probably wondering what on earth Castiel was going to do now. He clearly didn’t know what to do when Castiel stepped forward and started picking up shards of broken glass from the floor.
“They must have just picked up their cargo,” Dean offered, but Charlie and Castiel exchanged uncertain looks.
Dean left a final, lingering kiss on Cas’ lips. “We should definitely shower before we go out there. You feeling up to it?”
date. Not since their first and even that had just been drinks but with flowers and hand holding. Dean had never thought about it before; it wasn’t as if they were doing things the usual human way. But from the way Cas’ eyes lit up and not just from the blazing lights in the dark, Dean knew he’d been right in thinking it’d be something he’d enjoy.
It had been a long time since Castiel had engaged in hard labour. As an officer, even entering as a midshipman he had never had to do the heavy lifting, though he was fit enough to manage it. The boats came up a river and into the bay beside Bobby’s shack where the goods were dragged onto the beach so Sam, Dean and Castiel could shift them into the basement.
“On my way,” Dean called, his voice unfairly level, as Castiel felt a familiar heat pooling in his gut. Benny’s footsteps had barely faded when Dean swallowed around Castiel again, taking him over the edge. If Benny had remained, there was no way he would have mistook Castiel’s groan for anything other than it was. The solid wood behind him was the only thing keeping Castiel on his feet, as his knees went weak beneath him, he looked down at Dean and just the sight of him would be enough to haunt his dreams from that moment on. Dean looked right up at him, his green eyes bright but hazy as he continued to use his mouth to clean Castiel up, lapping gently with his tongue even though he knew it was too much.
The boat came to rest gently in the water and instinctively, Castiel moved to help loosen the ropes, even though he had long had a coxswain to do this kind of thing for him. Dean rigged up a short sail while Sam prepared the oars for when they’d inevitably have to make for land under their own strength.
“I’ll go and tell your father,” Dean’s mother said to him, kissing him softly on the cheek and giving them a moment alone. Dean’s mind was racing. There was so much to do...or at least...he thought there was so much to do. They had to summon a healer, an angelic one who would know what Cas needed, they would need to alert the Host, they kept tabs on every angelic/human hybrid born either in Heaven or on Earth. Then there were the Principalities, or was it the Cherubim? One of them would have to be notified, they’d have to come down and see if Cas was carrying a nephilim. He wouldn’t be of course, nephilim hadn’t been born for centuries, but didn’t they have to be checked anyway. Tradition or something? Dean had a vague memory of someone arriving when his mother was pregnant with Sam. Had that been a Principality? A Cherubim? He couldn’t remember…
“We’ll be back!” Dean assured him and he might have launched into a whole new avenue of teasing seeing as the only reason Sam would rule himself out of helping was if he already had plans. Plans that probably involved Eileen. But, he had his own date to get to and he would never run out of opportunities to hassle his brother.
The offer was sincere, but Castiel felt his breath leaving him. As a captain, he had long mastered the art of hiding his emotions behind a stoic facade and right now it was what saved him. He wouldn’t show Crowley that he was worried that Dean would take him up on it. But Dean surely hadn’t gone into business with Crowley without knowing exactly what kind of man he was. No doubt the powers that be knew that Crowley was supplying both sides but he would hardly want to deliver a renowned naval captain who could confirm the truth of it all. If Dean allowed Castiel to step aboard Crowley’s ship, he would not step off it.
Cas was stretched out across the couch but it wasn’t Cas that was the problem. It was the dog...wolf...
The reaction had been instant, people talking over each other, Sam had all but grabbed Bobby and shook him, demanding what he knew. It took a shout from Dean to calm them, before he too turned to Bobby expectantly.
“Alright,” he breathed, unable to delay what they had been trying to delay since Castiel had made his decision. “This is where I leave you.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “Place called Baker City, Oregon,” he added when Castiel raised an eyebrow, “Yeah, I had to look it up too,” he smirked. Out of his satchel, he pulled a series of paper folders and slapped them down in front of Castiel, gesturing for him to read them. “This week I’m an expert on djinn.”
Castiel had not met Sam Winchester, the younger of the two Winchester princes. He had been at the palace when Dean had taken him as his mate, but at the time Castiel had had other things to focus on than the guest list. He had a vague recollection of being introduced to Dean's mother, but even then he had been more intent on breaking his chains and freeing himself than making small talk. Then there had been the taming where Castiel's eyes had been quite firmly on the man who wanted to make him his mate and not the gathered crowds. The ensuing heat had brought with it a great deal of exploration of Dean, but there had hardly been a moment for familial introductions. By the time Castiel and Dean had emerged from their rooms, Sam had returned to the front lines.
Neither of the cots in Dean’s cabin were big enough for the both of them to share, but that hadn’t stopped them. Tensioned had simmered between them, both of them knowing exactly what was about to happen, neither of them shying away from it. There was still food on Dean’s plate when Castiel had stepped towards him, laying his fork aside while Dean watched him, a small smile playing on his lips. They had looked at each other for what felt like a far longer time than it actually was, Castiel had given Dean every opportunity to move away. Naturally, he didn’t.
“Did you make this yourself?” Castiel asked, looking at the pie set before him unashamedly impressed. Dean gave a shrug which Castiel took to mean, ‘yes’ and they dug in, only for Castiel to let out a positively indecent moan at the first taste. “Dean, this is incredible!”
“Cas...” he breathed and then let out a laugh that was more shock than anything else. “What’s this?”
“Cas-” Dean started but his voice sounded weirdly high even to his own ears so he cleared his throat and started again. “Cas...d’you wanna get a drink with me?”
They loaded Baby up with everything they’d bought, but Dean took a moment to compose himself before he started the engine.
In an ideal world, Dean might have reassured his husband that there was nothing to worry about but…there really was. Neither of them were under any illusions that a hunt could be Dean's last. They hadn't ever discussed it but then… They'd never had to.
Baby’s engine roared to life, louder than Dean had intended, but he was determined to have this conversation while driving so he wouldn’t have to give Cas his full attention. Not because he didn’t want to give Cas his full attention, he just didn’t think he’d survive the conversation if he did.
“Clarence,” Michael whispered, taking in his scent as though he needed it more than he needed air. A twinge of regret that Michael didn’t even know his real name was quickly subsumed by the all-encompassing need that thrummed through Castiel as he scented Michael in return. The fact that he was waist-deep in close to freezing water was forgotten as they clung to each other, their faces buried in the other’s neck.
The sand beneath Castiel was turning red with his own blood and he was aware that he couldn’t breathe so much as he was forced to gasp down burning lungfuls of air. There was no pain, that was unexpected. But he wasn’t dead yet and Balthazar’s arms were firm around him. He looked at Balthazar and gave the slightest of nods, his head already spinning from such a small motion.
Dean dropped to the ground, the angel blade Cas had dropped at the motel seemingly an age ago in his hand and in a single movement he dragged it through the sigil in the ground, breaking the trap. The djinn behind him had the good sense to stumble back.
“We need to seal the Hellgate on Earth and the one in Purgatory-” he started, slowly, wondering how Dean could have forgotten.
” he shouted, dramatically, revealing what looked like an ear of corn. Dean narrowed his eyes, trying to see what was wrong with it. It seemed alright, the right colour, not misshapen, but there must have been something.
Dean’s heart had gone from pounding out of his chest to hardly beating at all. The breath he’d taken had been knocked out of him and was showing no sign of returning. Sam’s words settled into his soul with a chill.
“And now Adam uses it as...what…?” Dean trailed off and it occurred to Castiel that maybe he didn’t know…
“And you?” Cas asked, showing no reaction to the news that not every angel in heaven was out for his blood.
“I don’t know what happened. There was to be a mighty battle between Lucifer, the Morning Star and Michael, the Prince of the Host, but I don’t know what became of it. The two of them vanished, nobody knows how or why and without their leader the angels just...they just shut themselves away. Heaven has been sealed ever since.”
It would have hurt less if Michael had just outright punched him in the gut. Castiel’s grip on his arm tightened to near painful levels as though he feared Michael would disappear if he didn’t hold him tight enough. “What? But-” he broke off, his voice catching somewhere in his throat. Of all the things he had expected to hear, that was not on the list. “You don’t want me?” Castiel said, his voice breaking even though he tried to hide it.
“Isn’t he amazing?” Dean said, warmly, touched that Cas blushed a little and looked away even though Dean knew he was going to be complimenting him, loudly, to anyone and everyone who would listen for the rest of their lives.
Sam only shrugged, but Adam caught Castiel’s eye and gave him a wry smile. “I think they got our letter.”
just before he decided to resign his commission. He’ll no doubt be hanged on sight if he ever shows his face near the Navy again, treason, dereliction of duty, murder, piracy and probably a hundred other articles, everything except sodomy, actually. Though...I’m sure he’ll remedy that soon enough.” Balthazar chuckled, slipping the watch back into his coat and turning to look back at where he’d come over.
Sam sighed and he scrubbed a hand over his face. “Look...I get it. I want Mom and Jack back too but this isn’t how we do it, Dean.”
. Castiel had never seen anything like it. Considering he was in the company of the murderous, violent pirates that had been terrorising the merchant ships of the Caribbean, Castiel couldn’t remember ever being so comfortable, even aboard ships he himself had commanded.
Sam didn’t look up from his plate. “Well, I saw you slip some protein bars in your pocket. Some other stuff has gone missing too. Scent blockers, the hex bags, some of the books on warding...”
He looked a mess. He was paler than any human should be, his shirt was open and loose revealing that his chest was a mass of bandages, though they were at least clean, and he was struggling to hold himself up, supported mostly by Sam.
cinnamon which had apparently caused the palace cook no end of confusion. And he was sleeping. Not just because he could or because he liked to, he found himself taking naps in the middle of the day, something he could only appreciate when Dean shook him awake, looking down at him with undisguised worry.
This time Cas’ eye roll was dramatic enough to reach the shortlist for several Academy awards, “and when I ‘
“The Tribulation had nothing to do with God. Actually, it had very little to do with humans,” Cas added, casually.
“I love cooking,” Dean said, quietly. Castiel looked up at him expectantly. “Used to drive my dad mad, he’d be calling for me to help set the sails and I’d be in the galley with Ellen learning how to cook for a crew. Y’know when we first started all this,” he waved his hand around the cabin in the vague direction of the ship in general, “I’d try and help Ellen out, but I couldn’t get away much. I’d have been happier not being a captain.”
“I looked amazing though, didn’t I, Sammy?” Dean shrugged with obvious pride in his voice, “I looked damn good.”
cannons. “Jo? Open fire when you’re ready!” They were clearly prepared to make the pirates work for their cargo, even if they didn't stand a chance.
Sam was outside as Rowena had said he would be. As soon as he saw Dean he threw his hands up, “Sorry, man, I didn’t think, I should have-”
Some time later, Dean and the red-haired girl stepped out after him while Dean locked the door to the shop in several places. “Night, Charlie,” he called as the girl headed in the opposite direction. Dean himself turned and almost walked into Castiel before he caught himself.
There were other advantages too. Despite their proximity to hellfire, the fortress seemed to run cold. Even Castiel’s wings could not defend all that much against the chill that seemed to cling to the unforgiving stones, but Dean seemed to be unaffected. The man seemed to generate his own heat, radiating it even when he’d stripped down to nothing and there was nothing Castiel liked more than to curl up around him, letting Dean warm him by touch alone, lulling him to sleep.
“We’ll be quick,” Cas assured him with a growl and damn if Dean didn’t believe him. It was hard not to with the way he expertly slotted their hips together, his hand reaching between them to fumble with their pants. Or at least, it should have been fumbling, but Cas always seemed to be in control, his hand steady as a rock. At the first breath of cool air against his rapidly hardening cock, Dean hissed, surging up to reclaim Cas’ lips which had never belonged anywhere but against his own. Cas loosed himself with a sigh, taking them both in hand and sliding them against each other, swallowing down the glorious sounds that Dean made under him.
you could die before you even make your report, we’re not the only pirates out here. You could end up at the bottom of the British Sea or you could change your mind, meet someone way more suited to you or you could stick around there long enough they have to make you an Admiral. Whatever you decide, I’d never know. I’d be looking for you, always and I can’t-” he sucked in a breath so sharply it must have been painful, “When you leave tomorrow, you’re gone. You might come back, God I hope you come back one day, but don’t tell me you will because I’ll hold you to it and you might not deliver.”
The words had barely left his mouth when Benny started digging into the spirits. Normally, Dean would have curbed such a thing, but they were celebrating. Who was he to stop them?
Dean stepped over to a red car that had its roof missing. Or at least that’s what they had all assumed when they had come across it. They had since learned it had been intended to look like that. A convertible; its roof folded out from its trunk and it was Dean’s personal favourite to drive. She positively shone even in the artificial light of the garage, her name ‘
“When was the last time you ate?” Castiel asked, casting around in his mind, but he couldn’t recall Sam sitting with Dean to dine. “Or slept?”
“Good night, Dean,” Cas whispers and is it Dean’s imagination or does he sound a little wistful? Probably not. He’s probably just tired.
“Hm,” Clarence hummed, non-committally, “I suppose, but then isn’t he getting tied down to a guy he’s never met or spoken to having just left everything he is familiar with? His family? His friends? Maybe he liked the countryside. Maybe he never wanted-” he broke off quickly, his voice a little too choked for a passive observation and Dean looked over at him, frowning, a realisation quickly dawning on him.
For his part, Dean hadn’t moved. He was aware that his mother was moving him, she’d pulled him into a hug and let him go before she patted Cas’ cheek affectionately, but Dean hadn’t moved. His body was frozen where it sat, though he could feel nothing of it. He had no sense of sensation, there was nothing, only profound shock. Until his eyes found Cas, who looked as shocked as he felt and they both forced out a laugh at the same time.
“Yeah but...” he takes a breath. This is veering dangerously close to talking about their feelings. At least when those feelings were bottled up where they belonged there was no chance of Cas walking away because of them. “If we do this then we...I-” He wants to say that they can’t go back. That if they do this Dean will never be able to look at Cas again without remembering this night. He’d never be able to listen to him speak without knowing the noises that he made or watch him trying to tame his hair knowing how it felt to tug it and how hard he liked it to be tugged. “It’ll change things,” is what Dean settles on.
Six djinn plus the one that was beating Queenie. Dean could have punched the air with relief. They’d faced worse odds. Sam tapped his shoulder and mouthed, ‘distraction’ as he gestured towards the trap that held Cas. Dean understood immediately even if he wasn’t particularly thrilled at Sam using himself as bait.
Dean’s body shook with silent laughter and the fingers curled into Castiel’s hair tightened a little. “No. I like
He puts himself on his side, trying to fold his legs into the small space. That’s somehow even more uncomfortable. He rolls over, curling himself into the back of the couch but that isn’t even worth the attempt. Dean turns back with a small huff. He’ll find a way. He’ll-
So this is the third iteration of this chapter because I threw a bit of a wobble over the original two :O
He reaches for the bottle of lube on the nightstand. He’d made fun of Dean for bringing it. He’d said it showed how little care he had for the job.
Dean mouthed over Castiel’s scent gland, searching for the spot that he would mark later. He couldn’t have said whether it was he who lifted Castiel up or whether Castiel used his position against the door to his advantage, but either way, Castiel’s legs were wrapped around Dean’s waist and thank the Gods Dean could call on his alpha strength to carry him because the feel of his mate so close was enough to make him weak at the knees.
“You wanna start by doing that for all the warding?” Sam asked and Dean noticed the way in which he didn’t bother to hide his desperation. Their father should have sent help sooner, he thought grimly. Still, he was here now, he could help now.
, though mercifully they’d missed the uproll and the damage was below the waterline. There might be some flooding, but they could deal with that later, assuming there was a later.
Dean felt like he had been knocked down. Somehow he was still standing, though he felt as though he’d taken a cannonball in the gut and had been thrown across the deck.
“Then at least I would have been with you,” Cas said, softening for the first time. His anger seemed to reside and he finally reached for Dean’s hand. “I would rather fight every day for our lives in Hell by your side than live a moment in Heaven without you.”
“We have a whole trail of them and for the most part, they keep the lesser and mid-range demons off our backs. But, that just means that every few weeks they send one of their toughest guys out to mess them up. Then we have to come out to restore them and while we do they pick us off.”
Cas had never mentioned Dean retiring. Dean knew he never would. When the end finally came for Dean Winchester it was going to be on the job.
Michael was beside him, gently urging him to look at certain flowers, pointing out rare trees, all without a word.
He held a finger in front of Dean’s eyes, only for Dean to push it away harshly after just the smallest of movements. “You’re moving it too fast! The ship-”
“You’ll see,” Castiel replied, unwilling to voice it in case the walls could somehow overhear them. He had been right; they had arrived in the kitchens, there was no mistaking them as the busiest rooms in the fortress even compared to the barracks. There were serving girls and errand boys dashing around everywhere, weaving around each other as they somehow managed to discern their orders from the din of shouts from the cooks over the noise of the fires and another meal’s preparation. A hundred different smells clamoured for dominance on the air and Castiel tried to breathe through his mouth; he had never been sensitive to scents before, but then he had never been pregnant before.
Dean scoffed and he wasn’t smiling anymore. Still, as he headed for the kitchen he still felt the warmth of his brother’s arms around him.
Dean hadn’t been about to say anything, but his mouth clamped shut anyway. Sam fell silent too and they exchanged awkward glances. Maybe...Maybe he could just grab Cas and force him into the Impala? That would be preferable, infinitely preferable, to having this conversation.
What had started as a fairly obvious ploy to keep them safe in travelling together had become unbreakable. None of them had addressed it, none of them had had to, but they’d all been given the chance to live a steady life and they had all turned it down for Cas.
When Dean wakes, it is with a pleasant soreness in his limbs and the taste of Cas on his lips. He isn’t sure how often they woke in the night, but he can remember trading lazy kisses until they were too tired to lift their heads. He remembers sucking Cas down until Cas had almost cried from overstimulation but spilled into his throat regardless. He remembers Cas bending him over the bed and demanding his pleasure from fingers alone.
out to sea, he smiled at the anticipation that swelled within him. It was actually quite pleasant to be a part of it all without the responsibilities that came with being a captain. It had been a long, long time since he had simply boarded a ship for the pleasure of the cruise.
“What? Huh? Oh...yeah...I just,” a flush crept across his cheeks, “I was just… I uh...I was thinking of a different what comes next.”
"I didn't feel the need to point out that at least four of your herbs can be combined with several ingredients in the bunker to make a potent aphrodisiac."
had belonged to Dean’s father, a beauty of a ship from a time when he had probably flown under a Jolly Roger of his own. A time before he’d settled down and Mary Winchester had made half an honest man out of him. Dean had practically learned to walk on that ship, so it was no surprise when he took over sailing the trade routes, taking the island’s goods to the larger ports, bringing back the goods they couldn’t get for themselves back with him.
Dean had nothing in response to that. He could only stare, while Sam seemed to shake his head, “Wait. So...you’re in the middle of some kind of djinn civil war and the other side has taken Cas to get at you?”
Dean caught Castiel’s eye and they managed to convey an entire conversation without actually saying anything.
Castiel turned in Michael’s lap, straddling his hips, more than a little satisfied at the sudden hiss Michael made at the contact. “Promise me, you’ll do your best to be happy. If we can’t be together we’ll take what happiness we can where we can.”
Of course, the obvious answer would be to split up. To go back to their original plan where they found a place in their pairs. They’d managed quite well before they’d ended up together. But...Dean didn’t want to leave them. He’d worry for a start. He’d spend the rest of his life wondering what they were up to if they were okay. And he liked them, even Meg who managed to get on his every nerve sometimes but was generally alright to be around.
and capitalise on the confusion, but already the crew was clearing the deck, trying to restore some order. Castiel turned away, even though he would have happily seen Roman’s flagship at the bottom of the ocean.
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Cas said. “I don’t need you to hold my hand to know how you feel for me.”
Clearing his throat, again, Castiel shifted uncomfortably where he stood. “He might say no,” he mumbled, “There’s no guarantee-”
“Too much hassle,” the man shrugged, but Castiel wasn’t convinced, not that he was in a position to argue for his own ransom. “We’ve got a stop to make before we head for port but,” he gestured to the cabin, “You can bunk in here. I usually share with my brother but he’s been in Eileen’s cabin since we set sail.”
“You boys don’t talk about anything plainly do you?” Rowena observed with a sigh, “Anyway, I wasn’t sure exactly what could help but I’ll have Samuel send over all my recipes for particularly bad heats. It’s not witchcraft but it’ll feel like it when you’re three days into heat and this soup is the only thing you can hold down,” she said, with the long-suffering tone of experience.
“I assure you, even like this, you’re beautiful,” Cas whispered, placing a kiss on the corner of Dean’s lips, unfazed by the soot that came away with him when he pulled back. “Let me,” he gestured, taking Dean’s arm and helping him into the bath.
“Friends!” the magistrate called and Dean couldn’t help but wonder if these guys were picked just because their voices seemed unnaturally loud. Though given the circumstances, he probably wouldn’t appreciate being called unnatural in any sense. “We, the faithful, know what the Norm is!”
They could have turned back. Castiel leaned over the side, assessing the damage as best he could, the port guns were still cleared for action, they could easily outmanoeuvre
More than anything, Castiel wanted to go straight to his ship, but there were protocols to follow. Before he did anything else he had to report to the Admiral. In hindsight he should have written his report on the journey over, then at least he’d have something to present and could run back to
“I want a divorce, ya bokhesh,” Queenie spluttered as Cas and Dean drew near. “You’re more trouble than you’re worth, angel.” She let go of Sam and managed a shaky step forward towards Cas, falling easily into his arms and Dean-
The captain of the merchant ship seemed to have taken it as a personal affront that his ship should have been targeted by pirates. He shouted across to Castiel through a speaking-trumpet which seemed to have been the only thing the pirates had left them.
The water was hot, way too hot, but the groan that escaped Dean was one of pure bliss, as the heat instantly worked its magic on his muscles as he slipped up to his neck. Immediately, he felt his eyes close, but Cas was there to cup his cheek, “Stay with me, my darling. Just a little longer and then you can sleep.”
Castiel screamed again and if Dean hadn’t been outnumbered he wouldn’t have let them stop him. But his father was still strong and Sam was immovable.
Dean gave something that sounded like it might have been a laugh in another life. “It’s this way, we’re almost there.”
It was strange to think that Dean had only been on this plot of land once but he knew every step, every tree, every stone that surrounded the barn located in the back end of nowhere in Pontiac, Illinois.
“And what were you planning to eat, Dean?” Sam called, having the sense to announce his presence before either Cas or Dean noticed someone approaching.
Castiel opened his mouth to speak but Dean held up his hand, cutting him off. “Wait...please...just...just wait.”
Dean drops into the couch and realises it’s only a two-seater just before Cas sits down on the legs he is already stretching out. They fall into a familiar, comfortable silence as Cas orders the pizza and Dean flicks through Gabriel’s channels. If all else fails there’s always Netflix.
“Sam? You look...” Dean trailed off, taking in the sight of his brother who looked...well? More than well, he looked better than Dean could remember him looking for a long time. The manic glint was gone from his eyes, his skin seemed to have recovered its colour and he seemed...lighter. As though a weight had been lifted. “You look...”
bad. We used up the last of our big guns on the merchants you ran into. That’s why we were running like hell when we caught sight of you. I’m not always one to play the odds but I at least like to have a fighting chance. We were just lighting powder hoping it would scare you off, or at least slow you down.”
“If you think you can get ready in time,” Dean added, laughing aloud when Adam practically fell over his feet trying to leave so he could prepare himself.
“What’ve we got?” Dean asks. He drops into the seat beside Castiel and looks over his shoulder at the screen. He doesn’t try to interfere. Castiel has known other agents who would attempt to assert themselves at this juncture, to take point so that when the time comes, they’ll be the one to get the credit for the success of the mission.
Dean and Sam exchanged a glance, before Sam said, “Home,” but without any of the feeling sailors normally reserved for sighting land after so long away. Dean jumped out of the boat and pushed it onto the shore, pulling it to a cove on the beach where it couldn’t be seen openly.
Ishim was not deterred and again Castiel quashed the urge to roll his eyes. “But five weeks and not a hint of him, the admiralty would not take it amiss if we couldn’t find him.”
“Not like that,” Castiel said, pointedly, noticing that nobody else on deck had even registered what was happening.
“How we doing for food, Ellen?” Dean called over his shoulder and Castiel was surprised to see that Ellen was still taking casks of food aboard. He arched an eyebrow, but Dean didn’t offer him an explanation, not that he was owed one, it was just unusual to see a ship that never went more than a few days from port at a time taking on enough food for almost half a year’s voyage.
The man beamed at him, taking his hand in his own, “Nice to meet you, Cas. Dean Winchester. Welcome aboard.”
Cupping his face, Cas sighed, “I’m a capable warrior, Dean. You know this, if I can help, I want to. I thought that’s why I was here, to help you.”
It was impossible not to smile back, knowing that Dean was going to milk this for all he could. Still, the sentiment remained. “Yes. I’m sorry I judged you so harshly for what you do. I knew you weren’t mindless, bloody pirates and I shouldn’t have treated you as such.”
“Your mother is with him,” his father tried to assure him. “It’s fine, Dean. I know it’s hard,” he said with the long-suffering tone of a man who’d seen it through himself.
“Gabriel-” Sam started, his voice far softer than Castiel would have thought for addressing an archangel.
He had died and his afterlife was one where he would live in comfortable surroundings with his mate. Dean reached for him but fell back as pain lanced through his side. Albeit once he’d recovered from the pain he had apparently brought with him.
” Gabriel snapped, but there was no malice there, “You’re already joined at the...you know...everything...of course he’s going to say yes. If you don’t believe me, here’s your chance to find out.” He gestured to the front door where the man in question was stepping in, wiping damp shoes on the welcome mat.
Dean forced his face to remain neutral as he fell in with the crowd. People deferred to his uniform, allowing him to stand closer to the raised platform that had been constructed especially for such things. He wished they wouldn’t, he really didn’t want to see this. He closed his eyes, trying not to let panic set in, it wouldn’t do for him to look nauseous. Besides, it might not be anything too bad...he didn’t believe in a God (which would be enough to land him on the platform himself) but he couldn’t help but mutter in his mind, praying to whatever it was that was out there, “
At some point during the proceedings, Dean came himself, panting Cas’ name, though the angel was far away and unable to hear him. They went limp together, boneless, pressing into each other as though they had allowed even the hint of space between them before now. Cas’ head fell forward onto Dean’s shoulder and he curled his arms around him, his breathing heavy and ragged but it would be a few moments before he would have the wherewithal to calm himself.
“He’s an angel!” Dean had shouted, uncaring that Castiel and Meg were well within earshot. Meg had huffed, loudly. Castiel had looked sad.
chosen this. He had personally signed off on the negotiations and had been the one to initiate them. Hadn’t he been the one to announce his intention to marry to the council and told them that he would bend to their choice of mate? They all thought that it was so he could ascend the throne. It had been ten years since John Winchester had died but Dean would not take his place as King until his marriage to a suitable omega. Dean had done nothing to discourage this assumption even though it was pretty far away from the truth. The truth was that if he mated and became King then Sam would be free to marry where he wanted. Once Dean was King, Sam would never have to worry about taking on that responsibility, he could have a life beyond the palace, he could find his true mate and mate for love, not duty. Sam knew, Sam knew without being told, that there was something going on beyond Dean’s desire to be King which was lukewarm at best. But Dean would never have burdened him with the truth. Now that the actual day was upon him he could balk at what he was about to do, he’d chosen it but he didn’t have to like it. He’d go through with it, of course he would, the alternative was unthinkable, forcing Sam into a life of duty and servitude even at the highest levels of society. A king was just a servant in fancier clothes.
“Yeah, I know, Dean. You don’t want to work with monsters. I’m not exactly a fan of it myself, but you wanna find Cas, don’t you?”
, refitted and chasing them down for round two. He could only see the sails of the other ship, but they had hoisted their colours; the flag of the Royal Navy.
He gestured for a woman, dressed in what looked like sackcloth decorated with crosses, to step up and Dean braced himself. It might be anything from someone with an extra toe to a cat with no tail. Dean’s breath left him all at once when the woman stepped up with a box. A relatively small box, nowhere near big enough to seal a person in, not even a kid.
“No, I mean...” he wraps his arms around Cas’ waist, bringing their chests together as he kisses him deeply. “
“Of course,” Cas said, smoothly, “I’m sure you realise that if something wasn’t done then the number in your Kingsguard would be irrelevant as you’d not have a land to be king of.”
“He’ll be fine. Now, maybe the two of you should take a moment, breathe and while you’re at it, Dean dear, as much as I appreciate the view, perhaps you would like to
The movement Dean had clocked earlier was revealed to be a small group of people, all gathered in front of the building, one of the tallest Dean had seen to survive the Tribulation, looking at them curiously.
spot. “Little busy, Sam,” Dean says, voice tight as he brings the phone to his ear. He almost drops it and not because of what Castiel is doing. “Oh- Bobby!”
Dean pulls back a little, just a little so he can look at Cas though the sight of him with lips full and flush from sucking Dean off is almost as much as he can take. He wants to ask if he’s sure but the part of his brain that forms words went offline when Cas said that he loved him.
“Can we just stay here?” Meg called lazily from the bed she had appropriated as her own. They were large enough for one person, one above the other, seemingly built into the wall, but Meg didn’t seem claustrophobic. The blankets might have been a little musty, but she didn’t mind those either, stretching out as much as she could.
He could see the relief in Sam when he breathed out. “Okay,” he sighed, “Alright. I don’t like it either, but-”
Another cry. Worse, Dean could feel it through the immutable bond they shared. He could feel Cas calling out every ounce of his being. But his father’s arm was strong around his waist.
Cas let out the smallest sigh of pleasure, letting his head roll back as Dean moved from his lips, across his jaw to his neck.
He wasn’t entirely sure what it was he was going to say, and before he’d properly considered what it was he was doing Castiel had risen and he heard himself say, “Dean?”
The warmth of Dean’s arms disappeared as he came around the table, looking at Castiel as though he’d sprouted a second head.
“And we did it, Cas.” Dean pulled his mate into his arms and held him tightly. “We did it. No one’s going to take our baby away.”
“You feel so good, Cas,” Dean whispered against his lips, taking himself out so he could stroke them together.
“What can I say?” Dean shrugged, “I’m thorough.” He took a bite of the pie and let out an indecently satisfied groan, “Man, Cas, I’m glad you asked me out, this is so good I’m pretty sure I have to marry you now.”
Castiel took a seat opposite the Admiral’s desk, a grand hardwood thing with embellishments of gold leaf.
Cas caught him and held him steady. “Dean? are you alright?” he asked, as though he hadn’t just disputed the doctrine that had been drilled into Dean and every other person since The Tribulation. The very reason anyone who deviated from “the Norm” was exiled or worse.
anything, Sam! He married her or whatever the hell they did so he could get the fruit. He hasn’t mentioned her since and now he’s tied up somewhere and she’s got pictures of-” he broke off, opening the door to slam it again. His fingers itched, maybe there was a djinn or two still alive that he could kill.
“Well, we can’t exactly sail into Kingston or Port Royal looking like this, Nassau won’t shoot us on sight,” the man laughed.
The other three paused and looked at Dean as though he’d gone mad. Well, Cas and Meg did. Sam just rolled his eyes.
“Right, but we’ve been looking into some of the more obscure ways that angels can use for tracking...”
There was that smile again, the one that was soft yet chilling. The one that showed her to be something other than human. “Now they will beg us to be wiped from the earth.”
But Jo’s only response was to shout at one of the gun crew to hold fast. Dean threw himself up, holding onto the rigging, calculating what they could do to outmanoeuvre two frigates. They couldn’t take them both on, well, they could but they would suffer heavily for it and they wouldn’t be able to sink them. The most they could do is cripple them enough to escape and hope they didn’t run into them again. Right now it was only
“We’re all tired,” Cas muttered, following Sam with his eyes, but Dean drew him back, leaning on him a little heavier than he would have liked for support. Cas looked down, almost alarmed, “Let’s get you warm,” he said, firmly, ignoring the way Dean grimaced. He’d just been out fighting demons made of flame and ash, right now he’d trade all the warmth in the world for an ice bath, even though he knew he’d regret it the moment he stepped into it.
It seemed almost inevitable when the rattle at the door came. Not from the trapdoor Dean and Cas had emerged from, but the actual door that led to the barracks beyond. Dean already knew that he didn’t want to fight whoever it was coming through the door. If they were human they’d be one of his own men, if they were angel then he was about to start something Sam might politely term
Dean laughed but didn’t need to think about it for long. “Sure, that sounds great. I’ll bring beer.”
Dean closed his eyes and took a few breaths to steady himself. If he were the praying type he might ask for deliverance but instead he tried to keep his voice as even as possible, determinedly not thinking about the man beside him taking a fake knot. “You know how heats work on earth, right?” he asked, with as much nonchalance as he could possibly put into his tone. “They can get pretty intense...fake knots...” he swallowed and looked away when Cas tracked the motion in his throat, “They can help with...y’know...”
A long time later after the announcements had been made, after Dean’s parents had greeted their grandchildren, after Dean’s brothers had said hello to their niece and nephew, after the proclamation had gone out and the bells had been rung, the feasting began.
want to fight, I did my duty, but I always thought the humans deserved more than to be collateral damage in a war that barely concerned them. Granted, having the Devil loose on the earth wasn’t ideal, but I’ve always found it somewhat ironic that we managed to do more damage to the world than the one called ‘The Destroyer.’” He gave a humourless chuckle, “I learned later, much later, that the host of heaven, the ones who were supposed to guard humanity, they had gotten bored of their charge and instigated the apocalypse to usher in paradise. I tried to stop it, but...by that time most of the damage had already been done.”
