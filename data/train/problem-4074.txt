“And you know, if I become a knight and you’d, I dunno, wanna try LARP-ing sometime,” he wiggles his eyebrows suggestively and Castiel is acutely reminded of why they are in the dorms to begin with. “I could use a squire of my own.”
He lets Dean’s now fully hard dick slip from his mouth as he sits up on his knees again. Dean’s a hot mess, eyes glossed over, and mouth parted as he watches Castiel greedily.
“Fucking
It burned through him, making his toes curl and heart hammer hard against his ribcage. Sweat trickled down his temple and he stroked himself fast, balls creeping up.
Dean didn’t know when exactly dad would be arriving, but he’d suspected it would be any day soon and had therefore endeavored to cook them a small feast. Most of this would keep a few days and there were anyhow never any problems with food spoiling with Cas around. With his grace at its peak again, Cas didn’t really need much to sustain himself, not as much as one would suspect looking at his true form, but boy could he eat if he wanted to. And Dean frankly loved cooking for Cas. So much so, that he’d sweet-talked Lisa into teaching him how to bake.
reason for them to be showering
Lily rolled her eyes, a trait she most definitely had learned from Dean. “It’s just a wig, how hard can it be?”
“I like you in any position.”
(Guess you should’ve paid more attention, Deanmon)
“So, um, why did you ask me about…” he glanced up. They were still alone. “Why’d you ask me about Cas?”
“Touch your nipples while I do this,” he squirted out more lube and did his best to warm it up without spilling too much. “If you want to.”
Relief washes over Cas and he sags against Dean for a moment, trying to calm his galloping heart. “You scared me, I thought you were hurting.”
His whole body locks up and he lets out an embarrassing sound, the squeeze almost painful as his orgasm rips out of him. Pump after pump fills the condom and he can’t stop growling. The pleasure that washes over him makes him shiver and he feels feverish, never before so affected by an orgasm and he’s acutely reminded of what it had felt like when he was in rut.
“Sure,” Dean smiles widely but his eyes are still hard and Cas’ stomach churns with a sudden need to fix that, Pam forgotten. “Anyway, watcha shopping for? Dinner?”
Dean jumped, the suddenness surprising him, dad stepped back, hand on his hunting knife. Cas snarled, showing rows of sharp fangs, eyes glowing menacingly as he slowly circled Dean, thick claws digging into the frozen ground just as well as they had when it was soft.
It starts innocently enough, the two men kissing, one of them cradling the other’s face, hands roaming, crotches pressed together. They’re both in their underwear and their peni—dicks, their dicks are hard. Castiel swallows down a wave of arousal and guilt. Dean said it was okay for Castiel to watch porn, seemed encouraging even, so there’s no reason for him to feel like he’s betraying Dean for being aroused at the sight of two strangers.
“Look,” Dean sighed, going back up to the angel. “I dunno what happened up there in the sky, but I figure that ball of fire was you and maybe your friend over there?” Dean had a hard time looking at the dead angel, for some reason. “Maybe you got hit by the lightning? I’m sorry about whatever happened, though. I tried to move it, your—that other angel. But it’s too heavy so I guess we’re stuck with it… anyway,” he looked up, right into the angel’s blue eyes, and tried to put as much conviction behind his words as possible. “Please don’t make me regret trying to save you.”
“Was what?”
Dean shifted from foot to foot. Castiel’s blood rushed in his ears, drowning out every sound except Dean’s.
“No,” Dean shakes his head, body trembling but pliant as Castiel moves into position again. “Enough.”
“I’m not,” he says curtly, tone upbeat. “If not at home with your parents, then this seems like the second best option for you to end up in my opinion,” he turns around with a genuine smile. “You’re safe here, Dean, and I’m glad it seems you feel the same.”
Dean rolled his eyes and Castiel couldn’t help but smile to himself. Dean was so expressive it was a treat to simply look at him and listen to him, his conversations animated and colorful. He smiled wider when Dean made a delighted sound at the first taste of the whisky and that made them lapse into a conversation about bourbon versus scotch and Castiel relaxed almost immediately.
of course but please stay safe and call if you need anything. we love you Dean
didn’t completely stick like it was supposed to. The girls had it on their fingers and there was even some on the floor. Lily shrieked with laughter when Andrea lunged for her, leaving a glittery spot on Lily’s cheek.
“Sorry, I kinda went overboard, huh?”
, Castiel was lucky he had decided to put on the cockring. Hell, his dick practically jumped in his pants just looking at the guy’s face.
“I’m sorry for not defending you,” Castiel exclaims, eyes wide. “I-I just froze, I didn’t understand what he was talking about.”
Castiel hated his next words, hated them with such immensity it almost choked him. “Did you ever prepare that exorcism?”
you like him?”
“Fucking hell,” he muttered to the dark forest, rubbing his cock through his pants. “Fucking goddamn
“I ain’t sharing details but it was amazeballs.”
“Of course,” mom said, sounding as if she was close to tears. Hell, she looked more emotional than she had when Dean had gone to his senior prom. He supposed that was because he’d taken Jo as a gag and they’d just been joking around all evening, but this was some real shit right here. “And yes, I’ll help you with anything you need, Dean.”
Okay but truth time: this chapter had a LOT more planned but that goddamn shower scene just grew and grew and grew (not unlike Dean and Cas' love for each other hehe) so yeah... we're dealing with the fallout in the next chapter. See you next week! 😚
“Hey,” he cups Cas’ jaw, kissing him sweetly to calm down the Alpha. “I wanna mate with you so fucking bad it hurts but I wanna do this right, okay?” he smiles when Cas nods slowly. “You haven’t had a rut in forever, let me take care of you first so your head’ll clear a little. Besides,” he grins and starts unbuttoning Cas’ shirt again. “I have a surprise for you but I’m saving it for later.”
“Fuck yes, that’s the stuff,” Dean’s whole body shudders, his inner walls rippling around Castiel’s cock.
*****
Cas hummed and sucked slowly on his cigarette. And despite Dean’s desperation to make up for his behavior he felt an arrow of desire zing through him. He swallowed and watched Cas track the movement with his eyes.
“Why won’t you look at me, sir?”
palpable pheromones would make it hard for anyone to breathe in here right now.
It took a moment to find a comfortable way to lie on his stomach with his dick already as happy as it was, the moss soft enough but of course there was a twig here and a pebble there. But Dean made it work and soon he found himself prone on his stomach, the angel hovering on all fours above him, blotting out the sun with his sheer size.
“Let’s first discuss this new janitor of yours.”
felt special. But maybe that’s just stupid.”
Then suddenly it was only Cas and Dean left, and they were walking in the general direction of Dean’s apartment.
the boy? Like the boy trusts him? Lord save him, Dean’s a
over that limit (with like 15 too many...). Fear not, though, I believe the essentials are still there!
He spots Sam sitting on a bench on the other side of the festival grounds and starts weaving his way through the crowd. He makes it almost all the way and then nearly walks into a dude just as he’s reaching the bench.
It was getting frustrated, Castiel could see, and he understood why. Castiel had come down to get his morning coffee and while waiting for the nourishing beverage to finish brewing he had gone to look out the bay windows facing his backyard and that was when he had first spotted the creature. Well over twenty minutes ago, and Castiel had no way of knowing for how long it had been trying to climb the tree before he saw it.
Dean sits back on his heels, arms full of clothes, both stuff that he’s brought home to get laundred and things he never brought to college because his closet there is pint-sized.
Cas lolled his head back, grabbing one of Dean’s hands and putting them on his chest. “Pinch my nipples.”
“Dean, wait,” Castiel reaches for him, but Dean is already on the other side of the bed. “You’re still injured.”
“I’m…?”
He took half a step back, pulling Dean with him a little so the man was forced to present his ass when Castiel forced his upper body against the wall.
“Mh,” he nodded for good measure and the man gave Cas a look as if to communicate how absolutely
into the kink it was hard for him to, well, stay
Yeah, wasn’t like Dean would be able not to even if he’d wanted to avoid it.
Cas turned his head and grinned at Dean over his shoulder. “Oil to make it feel better. You put it on your cock, and preferably in me, so it won’t hurt.”
“Who is this?” the man who seemed to be a bit of a leader asked, his accent just as prominent as Cas’. “He was helping you?”
It makes Dean moan as he rocks in the Alpha’s lap, Cas coming hard inside him as his knot locks them together.
“Come on, Principal Novak,” Gordon cuts in and Cas jerks to attention, can’t
“I dunno,” Sam hummed again. “I think, if you really like him, it could be worth a shot to bring it up with him again. Like, you don’t
, he hadn’t thought much of the incident. Aside from, perhaps, noting that it might have been a pretty good deal after all. Since he
Sam bobbed his head, the evening sun catching in his hair. “He went out yesterday.”
dating, had taken her advice, even though it had been one of the hardest things he’d ever done. He’d actually opened the texting app once or twice, typing something out, just in
Scanning his options, Dean felt pretty good about this night, which was a plus. He was in his tightest jeans, making his perky butt so perky it was two seconds away from starting a Sorority, and he had downed a Jagermeister bomb for good measure. Dean was feeling
“Fucking yes,” Dean exclaims and Cas rips himself out of his thoughts. Hidden treasures whatnow? “Can I
“It’s, hm,” he’d pulled Sam into his old room, closing the door. “I met this guy.”
“You’d bend for me.”
Castiel pulled off with a wry smile, jerking Dean as he spoke, his dick slick enough with saliva. “And that would make me immune to a beautiful man whimpering under my touch?”
His attention was pulled away from those thoughts when the other three started passing around the side dishes and Dean watched with big eyes how his plate grew and grew as Cas added more stuff to it without a second thought.
Dean grinned to himself, obviously pleased. “But you thought it was weird that I was wet down there for you?”
“And even if I were, what’s that to you?”
He can feel Dean’s smile against his skin. “I told them about us, and mom and dad got a little upset.”
Cas’ shoulders slumped a bit and he took his time swallowing. Dean’s eyes traced the movement of Cas’ throat.
“It’s decidedly
Castiel is almost choking himself, too eager to take as much of Dean as possible and too aroused to remember how to multitask. Breathing seems inconsequential all of a sudden and his body jolts with pleasure with every lick and suck from Dean.
Not too hard, definitely not hard enough to break the skin, but enough to test the give. He liked to feel Cas in his mouth, liked to press his teeth against the man’s smooth skin and see the evidence afterwards. And hickeys, fucking hell Dean was suddenly so into hickeys and Cas seemed to like that too, more than the biting, even if he allowed both almost frivolously.
Dean stumbled through the dark forest, one hand up to swath at low hanging branches, the other holding a bottle of rum. He was going by feel alone, having lost most sense of direction as he replaced wit with alcohol. It was stupid and dangerous going out into the forest at night in general, even more so when he was unequipped for it and drunk off his ass, but he didn’t
“Dean, are you drunk?”
“Now let’s see what we’re working with, cowboy,” Cas mumbled as he pushed Dean’s hands aside and opened Dean’s pants himself.
Cas caught Dean by his wrist, his grip hard but not unwelcomed or uncomfortable. “Come here, Dean.”
“Shut up,” she counters briskly and walks in, comfortable in his house in a way similar to Dean. Only it had taken Meg and Cas a lifetime to build that trust. With Dean it had simply happened naturally over a short period of time.
Dean’s mouth dropped open. “What?”
But, in the spirit of giving, he does start pumping his finger in and out at a slightly faster pace. Leaning over Dean, he can’t help but to grind his dick against the man as he kisses whatever he can reach of Dean’s warm body. Dean’s trembling and moaning, dick hard and leaking same as Castiel’s and when Castiel ventures a pinch to one of Dean’s perky nipples, the man’s dick jumps hard.
sigh of relief.
He grins to himself when he hears Dean grumble. He knows Dean doesn’t disagree with the term “making love”, not when it comes to them, but it still makes him cringe to hear it. Sam has told Castiel it’s because of their upbringing, and because of Dean’s rather crude personality, and Castiel has half a mind to agree.
Cas shouldn’t feel so good about Dean clearly wanting to choose him over his friends but he does. He feels really goddamn smug about it and it’s absolutely the reason why he interrupts now.
“I hadn’t figured,” Michael answers cockily as if being a smartass is sexy. His handshake is a tad bit too hard but Dean refuses to wince.
Sammy, had told him about it but Dean hadn’t really understood it then. During his time on Earth before meeting Cas he thought he’d seen love, had observed it as an outsider looking in, but now he thought he finally understood at least part of it.
Castiel forced himself to release a shaky breath, still surprised at the level of arousal he was experiencing so close to his last orgasm. Usually he was a zombie by now, normally able to fall asleep minutes after climax if so inclined. But now, like this with Dean, he felt electrified, and he hurried to roll on his own condom and open the package of lube.
His hole twitches at the very idea and he suddenly feels so goddamn horny he can’t even think straight. Needing something inside him,
“Of course,” Cas tells the floor. “It's your favorite.”
He gritted his teeth and met his reflection’s frowny stare. There was nothing to be done about it now, he would just have to put on a cockring and hope it helped enough. Who would think he would have to rape someone and be afraid of actually coming too
“Hey,” the man said when he came to stand right next to Castiel, much closer than Castiel was used to with strangers.
, after all, and if Dean wanted IHOP Cas could have just gone and bought him some. Or maybe the boy could have had some on the way home. And it’s not like Cas is a cook even comparable to an actual restaurant…
“It’s just that, since him I haven’t been able to find anyone who can satisfy
“I guess I do.”
Dean turned around and heaved. His body shook and a cold sweat broke out under all his layers of clothes.
He’s in one of his silk robes and the panties, nothing else, and he can’t decide whether to leave the robe open or close it in anticipation of the reveal. He decides unconsciously when he hears Cas start down the stairs, wrapping himself urgently enough for him to stop and chuckle at himself.
He looked thoughtfully at his camp. Cas shuffled around some but gave a pained whine and slumped down on the ground again. Dean looked back up at him, but Cas’ eyes were closed.
Dean squirmed to get closer again, arching his back when Cas put one hand on his flank, face showing surprise at Dean’s movement.
“Shut up and get naked too,” Dean mumbles, eyes averted with apparent embarrassment.
“Are you close?” he teases lightly, smirking to himself and twitching his fingers against Dean’s dick.
Benny, in complete contrast to what Castiel would have thought of the man, chuckles jovially. “I hear that.” His tone of voice is laced with amusement, but also longing and suddenly Castiel is itching to ask if Benny, too, has a lover in a small town somewhere, safely stowed away. If this is the fate for every hunter across the world. “Thanks again for saving me, brother.”
say something if he’s just using you for his amusement.”
in a hurry,” he looked pointedly at Cas. “We will split up, Bart will drive you.”
Dean ripped his head out of the chair so fast he hit his horns on the edge. It made something on the chair smack harshly and Dean cowered against the wall opposite the chair, staring up at Cas with eyes that displayed everything in full color.
Yes, he was at fault for forgetting their lunch and yes, it was somewhat worrying that he had. Castiel didn’t normally make mistakes like that and it stood clear to him that Dean’s presence affected him, perhaps more than the little creature understood himself. What was probably even more worrying was that he
“I forgot how to turn off the TV,” the lie tasted bad in Dean’s mouth and he smacked his lips. “But then I remembered.”
“Lamp oil?” Dean asked dumbly as Cas stretched out on his stomach on the bed.
With every buck of his hips, his hole clenched around Dean’s cock, the sensation as if his whole cock were being squeezed, every inch of it swallowed. Cas didn’t move up and down, so there was no in-and-out motion in that sense, but he swiveled his hips in a way that put the most raunchy whore to shame and Dean could do nothing but stare helplessly, mouth open as he panted, eyes locked on Cas’.
“Go on now, Dean,” Cas said, voice wobbly and his grip on Dean almost too tight. “Be a good demon and towel off so I can finish up in here.”
Not a person, no, but still so…
A life, he wanted to own a
“That’s not true,” he whispered and could see on Dean’s face that the younger man knew what he really meant and perhaps even why he said it.
He got back to the house earlier than expected and wasn’t surprised to find it empty. Dad was probably out on a hunt anyway and Sam was usually at work during the days, so Dean just unloaded and took some time to clean his equipment and sharpen his knives before he ventured down to the market.
Dean wanted to go into the bedroom next to the bathroom but the prospect of being completely alone with Cas was so fucking tempting.
Meg rolls her eyes, but he knows she agrees, she’s very vocal about her opinions, when negative. They walk up to a small podium with a sign that reads “Wait here to be seated, please!” and they don’t have to wait long before a perky blonde practically bounces up to them.
“Stay like this, I wanna see your face,” he snagged the pillow he’d used during the night. “Raise your hips.”
“Please, boys,” Cas sighs and tosses his glasses on his desk, rubbing his eyes tiredly. “I thought we were over this.”
Dean blinked at the sudden light, turning to Castiel with a big grin on his face. “‘And scene’?” he asked. “That something you usually say?”
Well, if Cas had just had a scare and he simply wanted to make sure Dean was really okay then he supposed it was fine to cuddle for a while. Dean wasn’t much for it and he was still naked, so it was a bit awkward, but he’d do it for Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean mewled, his hole clenching around Castiel’s cock and making him buck hard.
Not. Allowed.
“Beautiful,” the man whispered and caught Dean completely off guard. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but the man was quick on his feet, whipping out his hard cock and pressing it against Dean’s unprepared hole. “Fucking seducing me like that,” he growled and rubbed his cock against Dean, making it clear to Dean just how fucking hard he was. “I’m gonna fuck you hard and I’m gonna come in your little pussy. Gonna mark you real good for me.”
Cas’ dick jerked and he groaned, the one hand he had on Dean’s shoulder clenching down hard.
hottie.”
Dean’s heart swelled with affection. “And pancakes.”
Unexpectedly, his words made Cas push closer, his open mouth hovering over Dean’s shoulder, his fangs, sharper by far than Dean’s puny knife, barely touching Dean’s skin. It made him shiver and he combed his hands through the fur on Cas’ head and neck.
far down. Not even after he and Cas started having sex and Cas licked him all the fuck over had Dean really fingered himself. He just knew that he wanted Cas inside, that it would feel amazing, but he hadn’t thought much about how they would go about doing it.
“You look so pretty,” Dean beamed, touching the wig and dress, getting glitter all over his fingers. “It really suits you.”
Yes, Dean thought, that was good. Cas would be there for him, to love and cherish him like no one else had done but like Dean had always wished and longed for. Cas was his and he was Cas’, for all of eternity.
He jerks when he hears keys in the lock, spinning around with a pillow in hand and frantically sniffing the air just to make sure it doesn’t smell too much of any of the many cleaning agents he has scrubbed all flat surfaces with. Hopefully it just smells like flowers, though there’s no time to do anything about that now, not when Dean is walking through the door, a big grin on his face.
“I don’t care about your excuses,” Castiel said haughtily and when Dean peeked at him Castiel was looking down his nose at Dean. Fucking hell, Dean wasn’t even worth dirt to this man, was he? “Remake the whole report. I want it on my desk first thing tomorrow morning,” he leaned in, his expensive cologne wrapping tantalizingly around Dean’s senses. “
Castiel is hopeless to obey and he lets the darkness embrace him moments later, comforted by the weight of his Omega.
“It’s fine,” Andrea said, Castiel easily picking up the slight tang to her scent that told him she was still nervous, if perhaps a little less so. “And papa said he’d dress up with us!”
He waited with bated breath for a moment but when nothing came, he cautiously opened his eyes and looked around the room. It was Cas’ bedroom; nothing had changed since last night. Except that it was brighter, though Dean with his demon eyes didn’t note much of a difference regarding that.
Sensually slow, Cas dragged his lips across Dean’s cheek, speaking his next words against Dean’s open mouth.
“And can I ask you one last favor?”
“I have seen many demons and even met some,” Castiel stood again, putting his hands on his hips. “And you’re clearly one.”
He spread his legs when his dick was completely free, arching up his butt as he touched himself. His tail once again curled out of the way and Dean could scent his own smell in the air as his hole lubricated, preparing to get fucked. He wanted Cas so badly in that moment, the pleasure that raked through him was searing hot but not as hot as the man’s touches. The smell of Cas on the shirt was driving Dean up the walls and he chewed on the collar, feeling his eyes tear up in frustration as his orgasm was held back, teetering right
“I’m gonna go up to my bed, this is your chance to back out, no hard feelings.”
“What… What you’d do if I didn’t?”
(Don’t you dare go there,
“I’m not twelve, you don’t have to—” he practically shot off the armchair, looking sheepishly down at it.
That wasn’t what Dean wanted to hear, but he supposed it would have to do.
Dean just shakes his head minutely, rolling to get to his knees. “Nuthin’, just some a-hole wanting revenge.”
Castiel is still too shaken to answer but he manages a wobbly smile, feeling both happy and nervous at this turn of events.
“I’m sorry, Gladys,” Cas leaned around Dean, arm around him and making Dean’s whole body flush hot. “He’s spoken for.”
“Right.”
“Yeah it’s tough hearing stuff from the kitchen,” Michael sneers and somehow manages to make it sound like an insult. Cas’ happy scent drops immediately, and Dean barely resists gritting his teeth.
“Let me finish,” well damn, who knew Sam had already found his Alpha Voice…? “You’re also beautiful and caring, and you’re charming. You have confidence without being arrogant and honestly, the way you just do you without worrying about other people might be your best quality. I’ve always been proud to have you as my big brother. So yes,” he grins when Dean peeks at him, cheeks heating with lowkey embarrassment. “As an Alpha I say you’re a real catch. As your brother I say
Maybe the answer was simple, Dean thought as he walked to the bus stop near Walmart, maybe the man had simply changed his mind about going where he was headed and just given the umbrella to Dean because he was nearest. Or maybe he’d thought Dean looked nice? This was after all a very big city, there were bound to be all kinds of people in it and to think that some of the men were men who’d like someone like Dean was plausible.
The droop of his little tail told another story but Castiel decided to overlook that, just as he overlooked the fact that he wasn’t the one who had brought up Dean being scared. Instead, he silently got Dean a towel and started removing his wet clothes as Dean did a poor job of drying himself off.
“What’s wrong?” he croaked, immediately draping himself over Dean and gathering him close. “Did I hurt you? Was I too harsh?” fuck he had been too rough with the demon. Dean hiccupped, obviously trying to gain control over his crying and Castiel wanted to cry himself. “Did you not want it? You said you wanted me—”
That made Dean grin wide enough to show his incisors. “I’m a demon, Cas. I’m strong, I’ll take care of
“Please, Dean,” Cas rasped then. “I can’t take it.”
Dean felt half-crazed by now. His dick was pulsating, and he was gripping the chair so hard that his muscles bunched up, knuckles going white. His balls were tight, and it almost hurt, the pain so sweet it nearly made him weep with need.
Because if Dean was half succubus, and if the real Sammy was dead, and if Dean wasn’t Deanmon but Deanmon was a part of him, and
The arousal was building insanely fast, climbing within him and making him sweat even as chilled spikes went down his spine to pool in his groin. His dick and balls ached for release and he could barely see in the darkness of the room, light dancing before his eyes as his pleasure crested painfully.
Dean fidgeted with absolutely nothing. Swimming together was something they did frequently, and even after they started having sex there hadn’t always been anything sexual about it. Bathing was mostly for getting clean, cooling off, and relaxing. But now, somehow, it felt different.
“Dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs,” the man started listing, pointing to the different kinds of animals. “Although I suppose guinea pigs don’t have
“I’m not.”
Cas knows, realistically, that he’s endangering his job just by telling Dean the truth, but he’s been contemplating the pros and cons about lying or telling only parts of the truth and he has come to the conclusion that he trusts Dean enough to be honest with him, and also that that would be the least hurtful for the boy. Doesn’t mean this is easy, though…
Castiel squirms, squeezing his thighs together, pleasure flooding out from his groin. “There’s, um… I’ve looked…” God but he can’t say it out loud.
is the keyword,” Sam answered when all Dean did was stare at Crowley. The man seemed completely unfazed, though. “We don’t want you to back out of the deal but I gotta be honest and tell you I don’t have much faith in this claim anymore.”
Most of his concentration is shot to hell, though, because Dean has definitely sucked Alpha cock before and he must be pulling out every trick because save from being inside the Omega, Castiel has never felt so good before.
“We need to get your scrapes disinfected,” he mumbles, cursing their luck that the school nurse has long since gone home. He supposes he could take Dean to the infirmary anyway, since he has a master key, but somehow he gets the sense that Dean doesn’t want to draw too much attention to himself.
Teaser for next week: remember that I love you, and our boys, very much 💖
Dean sounds absolutely marvelous like this. Voice low and gravelly not only from arousal but the slight abuse to his throat. Cas uses one hand to pull harshly on his tie’s knot and whip it over his head just as he flicks Dean’s jeans open with practiced ease.
“Well, did you also know that this is a fridge?” Cas asked and opened a white door, only to reveal shelf after shelf of food and boxes and bottles. “And that this is where I store food?”
Cas looked down, swallowing. “Okay,” there was a beat of silence. “Is it for good?”
Dean’s mouth felt dry when dread swept over him as the meaning of Sam’s careful words sunk in.
He stops the other man from kneeling, knowing Dean intends to blow him first and also knowing he’ll probably come too soon if he does.
“Unless…” he bites his lower lip, thumbs moving on their own as he taps through the process of saving Dean to his contact list. Only to change his mind and tap the little X in the upper left corner.
. Dean is free to hang out with whomever he wants and since when did it become so important for him to have these moments with the boy anyway? It has barely been two weeks.
Dean nodded, serious. “Okay.”
,” she shakes her head again. On the coffee table, Cas’ phone lights up with an incoming call and when he glances at it he doesn’t recognize the number. “He totally went off on me, you have to read his texts, this dude is mental.”
“It’s always good with you, baby.”
“You’re so…” so what? Unashamed? Different? Strange? “Brave.”
“I haven’t asked you to pay me yet,” Cas interrupted, his tone unreadable to Dean.
“Oh that,” Dean grinned at her, impish. “That’s all in the past. Life goes on, Lis. I hope it does for you too.”
“So you’re telling me you went to Grandpa’s place and you didn’t even call me? Did you at least say hi to Grandpa?”
“Fuck yeah, Cas, you’ll catch me.” Dean laughed again and pushed off Cas’ hand this time, to walk over to the camp.
And his heart almost stopped when he brushed against the man’s rock hard dick and Dean groaned so deeply his throat had to have hurt.
“I love that,” Castiel hushed out before he could stop himself.
to Dean. “Not too much, I suppose. I can be here pretty long, but I guess you’ll be missed?”
. The man’s perfect dick, definitely made for Dean alone, was hot and hard and every time they moved together it made Dean’s whole body sing.
“Thank you,” Castiel didn’t know why but he bowed his head as he put the glasses on the coffee table, a pleasant warmth curling inside him at the thought of Dean liking his home. “I decorated it myself.”
“Yeah you,” God Dean wanted to touch Cas’ skin. Soft and tanned, stretched taut over lean muscles, it was the perfect skin and that thought was weird but Dean stood by it. “It’s your kink.”
Cas laughed out loud, that big beautiful laugh that made wrinkles appear and that made him look even more handsome.
After a moment of tug and pull, Cas’ hand slipped on the bed and Dean got his face full of Cas’ smooth chest. He didn’t even have chest hair and Dean had to wonder if that was a conscious choice to make himself look more enticing. Dean didn’t care which it was in that moment, mind zeroing in on Cas’ perky nipples. As soon as he latched on, Cas cried out and bucked down, grinding his hot dick against Dean’s stomach.
Dean flashes Castiel a smile and picks up one of the menus that’s lying on the table.
“Why do you have to be disgusting?” Sam groaned, hiding his face in his hands and shaking his head. “Why can’t you just say you liked him and be done with it?”
Fucking hell, Dean wasn’t completely sure he would survive this.
Castiel’s body thrums with adrenaline and he hates himself, but he can’t help how he feels.
Fuck his accent was thick now. Dean’s skin crawled with desire, the fire burning hot inside him, making him sweat and squirm.
and yes, that looked much better. Cas.
, you’re getting a
When he reached to roll on the condom, Dean took it from him and popped it in his mouth. Castiel could only stare, wide-eyed and almost frenzied, as Dean lowered his head over Castiel’s groin, swallowing his dick and putting on the condom in one go.
“I regret not going with pinewood,” Cas muttered. “It’s much softer. This isn’t working out how I want it to.”
Dean didn’t know if he liked or hated how honest Cas was with him. “You’re his favorite after all,” he sneered. “Well? Does
“Could we get naked?”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice is tight with arousal all of a sudden. “Are you trying to push me away because you don’t want me, or because you don’t think you
“Lift your skirt,” he said, voice gruffer with arousal. “Ride me.”
“Alpha,” he whines, daring to let go of the wall to turn over his shoulder, grabbing Cas’ hair in one hand as he strains to kiss the Alpha. “Want you so fucking bad.”
“Anything for you, sweetie. You’re always welcome here at
“So he must die?” Castiel shook his head, taking a step away from the angel. “That’s truly a despicable way of thinking.”
Dad was at work but mom had a day off and had decided to treat her sons to pancakes for lunch so she was at the stove, cooking up a feast.
“Cassie,” Michael claps him on the shoulder, too hard to be brotherly and Castiel shies away from the touch as best he can, trapped in his seat at the Novak dinner table. “He’s obviously playing a prank on you. Might even be a pledge thing for a fraternity.”
He led Dean downstairs by the hand and Dean couldn’t help how his tail twitched happily, his grip on the human’s hand probably harder than necessary.
“Don’t…” Dean mumbled something more but it was almost inaudible when he bowed his head in shame and spoke against the wall like that.
he thought wildly as he slammed the door to the bedroom open, panting as he made his way to the bed.
“I thought you were fucking
(It’s because he thinks you’re disgusting to look at)
Another boom sounded above him as he started on his way home, keeping a steady course due south, already trying to map out the shortest way. Were there any caves he could take cover in close by? He knew of several
Dean scrunched up his face in a mask of pleasure and pain, hopelessly caught on the edge for just a moment too long, and then the coil sprang free. His dick jerked and pulsated, and Dean bucked up while still pressing Cas’ foot down as he emptied into his underwear.
to wreak havoc on your village and take
“Yes, so,” he harrumphs, looks to the side and tries to calm himself. “Obviously, this is a very unprecedented occurrence for me, and for you too I bet. And I’m trying to handle the situation with care so if you could just please take a few steps back and—”
“What about me?”
Cas’ hands were big and sure as they swept up and down Dean’s lithe body and he arched sinuously into the touches, arms up and above his head so he could wrap his hands around Cas’ neck and in his hair. Cas walked him bodily under the spray and Dean closed his eyes, head back as he felt the warm water wash away all the suds and run down his body in sensuous trails.
Dean frowns, immediately serious. “What’s wrong?” he hops off the desk but Cas steps away from him, rubbing a hand over his mouth slowly. “Cas?”
Dean moans and whimpers with it, young dick already hard again as he humps the poor pillow. Tremors travel up and down his back, making his muscles play under soft skin and Cas thinks he’s truly a work of art. There’s lube everywhere now, Dean’ thighs and ass smeared with it and Cas covered up to his elbow on one arm, and yet he adds more, having easily figured out that Dean likes the squelching sound.
Cas swivels so hard it’s probably more conspicuous than if he had just continued walking normally but his body moved on its own in a desperate hope to get away. Because holy hell, he can’t be walking around here thinking about flirting with Dean in a bar and at the same time bump into the boy. The
“You look like something straight out of an Armani ad,” Cas shut the door behind him, still eyeing Dean up and down and he would have to be careful about that or Dean’s dick would make them late.
“Shut up right there,” Dean says affectionately and lies down so that he can thumb open his jeans as he stretches out on the seat. “You’re more than enough for me, Cas. Fuck, you’re
“It’s different,” Dean rasps then, catching all of Castiel’s attention. “I feel weird in this position.”
His whole body heated up and yeah, Castiel had never really been one of those guys who had trouble getting hard when he was drunk. Instead, his body seemed more amped up and if anything, he would be in danger of coming too fast. Except that was usually the case with Dean, wasn’t it?
(Why not, though?)
Delicious, desperate, wanton sounds that travelled up and down Castiel’s spine and set his cock on fire spilled out of Dean’s mouth and Castiel felt that beastly thing wake up inside him again. He’d wanted to rim Dean good, probe with his tongue and lap at the hole, nip at the sensitive skin around it and kiss it soothingly after.
Yes, Dean was really pathetic, wasn’t he? Ugly with his hooves and horns, so unlike a proper human female with their round shapes and flowy hair. So unlike someone Cas would
, you know?”
Dean’s brain churning and he’d played with Dean’s twitching tail as he waited for Dean to decide what he wanted to say.
“Did fucking my tight ass crack that stone heart of yours?” he breathed hotly against Dean’s cheek. “Cowboy.”
“He’s not
“You too,” Dean mumbles then, lips grazing Cas’ skin and making his whole body tingle. “You smell perfect.”
Castiel sits down beside him, worry gnawing at his insides, and he can’t help but touch Dean lightly, so lightly. He’s really here.
He wants this to go well so much, especially since Dean brought up a potential mating. He stands there now, on the curb because he couldn’t stand waiting inside without feeling suffocated, in his nicest slacks and white button down shirt, a dark blue blazer to hold off the chill and his
Suddenly he feels a weight on his shoulders, suddenly he feels done. Suddenly all his baggage and all his trauma, it all catches up to him. He feels repetitive, this drab fucking hunt sucking out what little life he had left in him and he throws himself into the fight with reckless abandon, fearless in a dangerous way.
The creature was at least twice as big as Dean, legs double-jointed and ending in what could best be described as bird claws, with sharp talons the angel now used against Dean’s delicate body. The angel’s upper body was mostly human-like but with smoother features, and from its back sprouted massive white wings that carried the angel high up into the air.
Dean didn’t know what Sammy meant by that, truly, so he just ignored it and gave the man his best smile, conscious of hiding his teeth with his lips.
“Um,” he glanced up and found that they were alone in the dining room for the moment. “I don’t know what you mean…”
“Yeah,” Dean carefully caresses Castiel’s burning ass cheek. They should wash off and then put something on the red skin, some kind of lotion, Castiel assumes, but he’s content where he is right now. “And all the new sex stuff.”
Cas hums and takes a sip of his beer. “This
“Yeah, so…” he flashed her a new smile, one more born from how good it felt to think about Cas than for her benefit.
“Twelve seconds is nothing, man. That was just warm-up.”
The man nodded. “Seeing as you got to know me in my true form, I don’t blame you. Would it make you more comfortable if I changed back?”
Now Dean was trembling for a whole other reason.
bit lewdly.”
“I think his pheromones don’t affect them like they affect us, but they do suck everyone in after a while,” Castiel said, leaning back and braiding his fingers together over his chest. “There’s just something generally likable about him.”
“Yeah, that’s fine, I…” Dean’s words stuck in the back of his throat but no, he wanted to do this. It was time he told his brother about Cas. “I…” he cleared his throat, put his plate down, and turned to face Sam fully. “I found an angel.”
“I mean, he hesitated…”
“It’s biblical,” he peeps and wants to punch himself. “You can call me Cas, if-if you want to.”
Dean woke in the middle of the night to a dull thud. It wasn’t very loud, but he felt it vibrate up through the ground. It barely woke him the first time it happened but a moment later, just as sleep was about to take him again, it happened once more and that made his eyes fly open.
Dad looked just as confused as you’d expect in a situation like this. “Is he dangerous?”
Wanted anyone and everyone to see that he belonged to Dean. Wanted this powerful Cambion to mark this puny human and wanted to serve Dean until the day he died.
“You look like sin, baby,” Dean says, his voice low and gruff, and he tosses the belt to the side, snapping open his jeans to no doubt relieve pressure. Castiel only now sees how hard Dean is, his dick filling out against his leg, deliciously trapped in his jeans. “C’mere.”
A wave of fresh arousal washed over Dean and he stepped back and surveyed the room, ideas suddenly flooding his mind. He loved it when Cas was the one in charge, it was sexy and freeing, but to be given the chance to steer them was too good to pass up on.
Dean chuckled and chose to interpret that as a hug. He patted the angel’s head for a moment, eyes catching on the impressive horns, their tips looking pointed and sharp, and then turned to get water in his bowl to wash off the poultice with.
With that he was out of the house, ears deaf to Gary’s insults and angry words. For good measure he slammed the door hard enough that he hoped Lynette woke up and gave Gary shit about it.
The spring sun was warm enough that he didn’t need all layers of clothes in the middle of the day anymore and he knew he would get heated enough just trudging through the forest, especially since he was aiming for the mountains. Besides, he was hoping to kill at least a deer and dragging that back to camp would be sweat-inducing enough…
“I know, right?” she shakes her head and takes a sip that’s big enough to be called a mouthful. Yeah, either she’s staying the night or Cas is calling her a cab. “So I told him. ‘Listen, darling’,” she closes her eyes briefly and breathes in deeply. “‘This ain’t working for me,
Cas winced and whined when Dean washed off the dried blood, probably a little too roughly, considering how fresh the wound was. Dean couldn’t help but flinch when he saw how it tore at the terrible stitches, but he didn’t want Cas to see that he was affected.
Castiel can tell immediately that Dean has started jerking off and the knowledge makes desire ping through him. His hips buck up into the air, but he doesn’t even try to touch his cock, knowing he won’t reach and loving giving up the control to Dean.
(Careful, Deanmon)
Dean feels his insides twinge. Must he? Can’t he just let Dean have this?
“You get off him!” he barked, moving so that he and Cas had their backs to each other, facing the surrounding men.
“No, baby, we’re both fine.”
Yes, looking at Cas’ intelligent eyes it was clear that he suspected something was different, and maybe he was even feeling the same sense of dread that was curling around Dean’s insides. Whatever it was, Dean didn’t want Cas to worry.
finished. “I’m sorry.”
“Ha-ha,” Dean sighs. “Look, I asked you because you’re my queens and this is important.”
, y’know? And your mind just goes…” he squeezes his eyes shut, turning his face to the heavens and shakes his fists. “Boom.”
He bent his head back against the rock, back arching as he moaned loudly and unashamedly. He looked beautiful.
“Still hungry?” he smiled, relieved that his arousal had abated enough for him to act normal again.
Cas had intended for the kisses to be sweet and loving but they end up just as heated and urgent as usual and he loves it. Dean keens and presses closer, hips grinding as they let their tongues dance together. He squeezes their dicks when Cas nibbles on his lower lip and Cas clenches down on his hold on Dean’s neck, delighting in the way Dean melts down against him.
to him and it
, Cas’ delicious dick too close for Dean to be able to focus on much else.
a chance to say all of those things and to listen to me say mine. I’ve never felt this way before, Dean.”
would subject himself like that anyway. He supposed it had something to do with money and debt because hell if Dean could believe Cas would fucking
Dean bobbed his head in acknowledgement of Sam’s words. Yeah, no need to get wrecked about this. Cas was a whore and Dean took pleasure in the pleasure Cas gave him, simple as that. Cas’ gender didn’t have anything to do with fucking him. It was just fucking, just sating a primal need and that was all Dean wanted from Cas anyway. Because with Cas he could be rough like he didn’t like being with women because they were delicate, and Dean didn’t want to hurt them. Cas could take a punch though, and probably throw one himself. So he could take care of Dean’s more feral side. Yeah, that was
Cas snarled then; a feral sound that made Dean press his lips together to quell a moan. He stepped closer, grabbing Cas by his jowls, feeling the barely restrained strength that coursed through the angel. Smoothing his hands into Cas’ fur, he bent the angel’s head so that he could hug him to his chest, Cas’ head bent down so that his horns were on either side of Dean and the angel’s hot breath ghosted over his hard dick.
“You surprised me,” he chuckled when Cas relaxed, swaying in Dean’s lap.
Cas growls, shuffling his face against Dean’s own neck, his thrusting becoming sharper and shallower, almost more of a grind and fuck yeah, that’s his knot alright, pushing at Dean’s swollen rim.
“Is something wrong?”
“That sounds like a splendid idea,” he said, tone warm and affectionate. He wanted Dean to stay, that was much clear to him after only such a short time, and having the demon get along with Castiel’s friends and family would facilitate that.
Castiel intends to do no such thing. He wants to savor this, and he wants Dean to be allowed to come as much as he wants, to succumb to the pleasure Castiel gives him.
With that in mind, he went over to the rabbit’s cage to check on its water and food. The cage could do with some cleaning, he noted, and he thought he would do it once Cas had left for work.
“Cas,” Dean said then, an edge to his voice that wasn’t usually there and Castiel thought
He barely registers Dean asking, “Got one more in ya?”, so lost in his impending release that all he can really hear is white static.
he hadn’t made a mess in Cas’ bed or he would have noticed when he woke up. When Dean was younger, he used to do that all the time, and he got beat up a lot for it. Demons didn’t need to-to…
By the time Cas landed in the middle of the clearing with a half-eaten mountain goat in his giant hand, Dean’s body was already heated. In his mind he’d made up a thousand and one scenarios where he and Cas talked about Dean’s suddenly very pressing wishes, scenarios where the angel left him but also ones where he stayed. Scenarios where
sound of—
“You’ve hardly eaten.”
to the side and when Dean looks over in surprise, there’s fucking
, Dean was reduced to some kind of brainless mess that could only hump the man’s face and moan like he was getting paid to do it.
The man was named Bob and he was in town for business, looking for a quick hook-up before he got back to work on Monday, which suited Dean just fine. He was also pretty handsy, but Dean didn’t mind that at all at this point. Hell, he was pent up enough for his body to light up with arousal when Bob squeezed him. After only talking for a little while, Dean soon found himself straddling Bob’s lap and making out with the man as Bob fondled Dean’s ass.
So, now that I've spoiled most of the chapter, I wish you a happy read and an even happier New Year! Fuck knows we all need it... We're rooting for you, 2021,
(It’s dead anyway, what does it matter if you eat it?)
“Hey there, handsome,” Dean grins and puts down the boxes by the one Castiel had carried, only to straighten and pull Castiel into a kiss. Their lips slide lovingly against one another and Castiel can’t help but smile into it as he feels his inner Alpha purr with delight.
“Were you jealous, baby?” Dean teases, tone low and inviting. “Did looking at me and Benny make you angry?”
“I do.”
“A surprise?” Cas’ scent turns curious but he’s too deep into his rut already that the arousal doesn’t go away and Dean fucking loves the combination.
Such a simple thing to say, such an easy compliment, and yet it has Castiel’s heart racing, his inner Alpha preening. He’s sure his scent blows up with his happiness, but he doesn’t even bother with trying to control it.
“I’ve spent countless hours thinking about what a life with you could be like,” Cas said, as if saying something like that was easy. The thought that maybe Cas didn’t know how to lie flitted through Dean’s mind. “That and practicing changing forms. I’ve been… eager, to say the least, to talk to you.”
only been about the exhilaration of flying.
Cas has to make quick work of folding the pants when he realizes what kind of position he’s put himself in. Because his face is at the perfect height for—
Cas blew smoke to the other side, away from Dean. “He meant that if I had just worked a little harder on my marriage Bela wouldn’t have left me,” he smiled crookedly when Michael straightened with a sour face. “Most of my family think I should have made more of an effort, because being divorced is an atrocity.”
bed. Cas had to change the sheets not only because he’d soiled them with his release but because he was scared he would do it again if he didn’t get away from Dean’s scent. “I’m a creep.”
He slowed his steps as he was closing in on the crowd around the mechanical bull, pacing himself as if approaching a business proposal. Hell, he didn’t even know if the man was interested in sleeping with men and Castiel recognized how it could be a sensitive topic, so he wanted to approach this in a suitable fashion. But on the other hand, he had never been this aroused from just watching someone before. He could only hope it wasn’t noticeable, on his face or otherwise.
Once he was completely naked, and mostly hard, he went down on his knees, confident by now that Cas would follow his lead. The angel was pretty bossy and obviously strong enough to do what he wanted, but he deferred to Dean in some cases, this obviously being one such glorious occasion.
“I’m comparing prices,” the man—
“I’m not, that’s why he’s being an ass.”
Cas just squinted at him for a while, lighting his cigarette and taking a drag before reaching over and turning on the hood fan above the stove.
“That I am,” Castiel chuckled again, often finding things funnier than they actually were when he was drunk. Gabriel called him a happy drunk and Castiel supposed there was nothing wrong with that. “I’m gonna pay for this tomorrow.”
“Sleep well?”
Castiel and Balthazar shared a look, amused.
He shook his head at himself, standing at the bus stop to wait for the return bus, umbrella in hand since it had mercifully stopped raining, his many grocery bags at his feet.
but boy does he want to
Cas looked momentarily surprised at how readily Dean admitted that, but his expression changed to a pleased one almost immediately.
Typical straight guys… “Don’t knock it until you try it,” Dean muttered but of course didn’t really mean it because while he was sexually strung up, he wasn’t an ass.
Dean mutters something about the time and then rests back again, once more rubbing his eyes. Castiel’s hand moves of its own volition, and he gasps far too loud when it closes around Dean’s hard dick. It’s so thick. Castiel’s little hole clenches just remembering that this usually goes inside him.
“You thought you’d just fuck around with me?”
Listen, it wouldn't be Destiel without at least a LITTLE bit of angst 🤣
And, for that matter, point number two was even more illogical. Namely, why was he naked? Why wasn’t he in at least his swimming trunks? Sure, he always showered naked, why wouldn’t he? But he knew he wasn’t exactly alone this time and the only other times he’d showered naked with someone else was either at the bathhouse (which wasn’t
Cas’ eyes grew wide and Dean couldn’t help but grin happily. “Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah, talk about that and you’ll make everyone so impressed they won’t even dare ask any other questions.””
“I remember,” Dean panted, chasing Cas’ mouth when the man leaned closer again.
Dean fingered a button. “I guess.”
Well, that had certainly been unexpected but not unwelcomed.
Dean snapped his head up. “Sam’s been here?”
“Hey now,” Dean drags himself up to a sitting position, hands on Cas’ neck to pull him into a quick kiss. “Is this about what your brother said? Because we don’t have to do anything right now, we can talk more about that if you want to?”
Thankfully it wasn’t too far, since a Starbucks had long ago installed itself in the same building as the library, no doubt ready to feed off of hungry students. Dean was honestly more prone to bring snacks and things from home, to save money, but since he’d gotten the coffee for free and since he’d gotten that huge tip the other day, he thought he could afford an overpriced muffin.
He laughs again and they hang up shortly after.
“I’ll be back later, okay?” he’d said, almost ripping the hide when he couldn’t stop looking at Cas. “Not later today but… just in a few days. Okay?”
“Hey,” Sam looks serious when Dean lifts his head, the Alpha smiling slightly when their eyes meet. “You’re gonna do great.”
be serious about the situation or he thought he’d freak out, his rational mind dormant for now.
“Are we in the market for a cute little pet?” he asked, leaning down on his knees so his face came closer to Dean’s. “Do you want some company, sweetheart?”
was cool. Castiel’s cryptozoologist side wanted to shout that from the rooftops, a mythological creature thought he was
He leaned forward, putting a hand on Cas’ knee, but Charlie beat him to the punch.
“Oh,” Dean said and pushed the glasses higher up his nose. He was about to say that he would simply control his eyes so that they didn’t look like demon eyes but realized that he didn’t know how to. “That’s smart.”
The angel held her hands out to the sides. “I’m just stating the obvious, human. This creature isn’t in symbiosis with itself and it’s impossible to know when he will turn and hurt you or—”
Dean jerked when Cas suddenly spoke right next to him. “Damn near sent me to my grave,” he griped gruffly, eyes fluttering everywhere but Cas’ face.
Lilly puffed out her cheeks, looking at her sister before turning to Dean, taking his big hand in hers. “Andy thought she’d look ugly, so papa put on a dress to show her anyone can have a dress on.”
, if anyone should want to check out all the new students it should be him, right?
“I don’t,” Dean did his fucking best to sound assertive and mature, but Cas was making it difficult with his plush lips and brilliant eyes and
“With containing the boom?”
He waved, probably too enthusiastically, when Cas got out of his car, and then made it up to the man. Cas just looked at Dean and then turned to walk to the house and Dean tried not to read anything into it.
Well outside the car the cool night air calmed Castiel a little but it didn’t last long when Dean turned to him with gleaming eyes.
“What if you don’t like this though?” he whispers.
Just to cover for that, and for thinking Cas was cute, he’d grumped some the first few times, accusing Cas of scaring off prey but it turned out that that couldn’t have been more untrue. The only animals avoiding Cas’ presence were predators, the ones Dean wasn’t very interested in hunting anyway. Birds even seemed to like being around Cas, their song following them as they walked through the forest and in their camp.
Dean watched with big eyes, mouth open as he panted, his heart hammering so fast he felt dizzy. His whole body pumped, fear and awe mixing and making him feel hot and cold at the same time. He gulped when he realized he was hard in his trousers and yet he still couldn’t look away from the sight of Cas viciously devouring the mountain lion.
“Then it’s special to me too,” Dean said, also in a low murmur as if he didn’t want to disturb the peace. “I like it, it feels safe.”
“Okay,” Dean mumbled, trying
Dean nodded. “That was why I was buying steak when you met me yesterday. To make him happy. It didn’t really work.”
“I mean, I am, I don’t,” Dean swallowed, his voice wavering. “I don’t have much experience and—”
“Later, Sammy. I’ll help you.”
Charlie visibly perks up at this and Dean can feel her scent change into a poof of happiness. “Have we met?”
seemed to make any kind of connection. His eyes rounded out when he looked at Cas again. “Oh.”
In fact, Castiel is so into it that he doesn’t even register either of their morning breaths, completely giving in to the pleasure that’s slowly melting him from inside out. He could come like this, he knows, more than willing to let his desires win for now and perhaps talk to Dean about spanking later, in the afterglow. They could try it tonight, maybe?
Dean pauses again, staring unseeingly into his closet for a moment. “Yeah…”
“And I mean,” Gabriel shot him a grin that
“I need to bring in the firewood.”
Or maybe the angel didn’t have to understand, just had to know that Dean liked it and that Cas himself didn’t hate it and that could be enough. Maybe this could be something the angel did for Dean and there could be something Dean could do for the angel in return.
The sounds of the campus cafeteria rush back and Castiel manages to find at least some semblance of self-control.
Dean was immediately suspicious of Sammy’s suddenly helpful advice but decided to take it as long as it seemed reasonable enough.
“She really is, and I appreciate that you didn’t rip her to shreds.”
In the end, mom had to help Dean with his hair. He did his best to flatten it, changed his mind and tried to make it spikey and edgy in contrast with his sharp suit. And changed his mind again and started over.
For the whole night? No wait, that wasn’t what Dean wanted to say. “I don’t care,” he gritted out. “I much prefer a pretty woman anyway.”
“Thank you,” Cas said then, voice hoarse and his face hidden as he ducked it against Boxer’s neck. “Thank you, Dean.”
me, not alongside me. You’d do well to remember that, Mr. Winchester.”
The water went down like balm on his soul and he was quick to have another. Just as he was on his third mug, a sound behind him alerted him and he turned around only to see another person there. And not Marvin the security guard.
Dean nearly choked. He stuttered and cough and Cas dropped his stub to the ground and scraped his foot over it a couple of times to make sure it was out.
Castiel looks to the side. “Hm, that’s…”
That made dad frown a little and he took the shirt from Dean’s lax grip. “Is this about the not-date I gave you extra cash for?”
Fuck he wanted to be the same size so he would be able to take Cas inside him. Yeah, he’d never wanted that before but that didn’t have to make it a bad thing, right? Dean could want things for himself, accepting his desire for the angel at all had proven that excellently to him.
“Work,” Cas scoffed, taking half a step away, giving Dean room enough to breathe properly, even though it was immediately made difficult again when Cas’ hands landed on Dean’s hips. “It’s not that, although I do have, hm, prior engagements sometimes. It’s a family business, I guess you’d say.”
Dad chuckled and relaxed his stance. “I just meant I thought you hated that shirt.”
“Who…” he started, eyes hard and the man immediately lowered his hands. He was still smiling.
Cas grunted and threw his head back when Dean thrusted hard up into him, their movements somewhat limited in the space of the car and the fact that Cas was mainly just sitting there and letting Dean work, but no less glorious for it.
“Yeah, next time I wanna feel your spunk running down my legs.” And come to think of it, there was one more thing. “And maybe I’d want the lights on too, you’re stupidly handsome for fuck’s sake.”
Concealed by layers as it is, Dean’s body seems pretty average but the more Castiel explores, the more delightful surprises he finds. Dean’s ass, for example, is wonderfully round and bubbly and Castiel can’t wait to bury himself between the cheeks.
“Not at all,” Castiel admitted with a little sigh. “Truth be told I don’t know much about Dean’s past at all. Except that he seems to have been abused and for one reason or another either refuses to or can’t return to Hell. I want to ask so many things, but I can’t make myself force him to relive painful memories.”
Castiel wanted to yell at her, wanted to come with all kinds of arguments, but knew he would come up short against her ironclad stubbornness. No doubt this attitude was why Samuel the Nephilim had chosen to hole up in Hell with the demons instead, even though he seemed to have been in perfect balance with himself.
“It was a ghoul,” Dean murmurs then. “It kinda tossed me, bruised my ribs when I landed but it’s fine.”
Dean readily yielded his knife to dad’s sharper one. “I will,” he said with a new grin and dad just sighed, most likely knowing Dean wouldn’t do it as long as dad kept indulging him.
think he looked good. Not like Cas did.
? Gushing is for… infatuated people, or… or otherwise enamored people. He turns his head and squints at Dean, who’s busy picking apples from one of the trees in Cas’ yard. He supposes Dean is endearing in his own way but…
“Yes,” he growls and Dean gasps sharply.
Now, two days later, he was playing Counter Strike with Sammy when Cas texted him. Just a short “Now?” and Dean’s whole body lit up like a goddamn Christmas tree. His pulse quickened and his hand shook so much with excitement that he fudged the game and was instantly killed at the spawn point.
man, would you like that? Someone to take care of you like you need.”
It was Dean’s turn to look the guy up and down and yeah, why not? He was hot, in a pretty standard way. Nice hands, which was a huge criterion for Dean, and kind eyes. Seemed eager but hell, so was Dean.
“I mentioned you
“That’s cute,” Cas mumbled and grabbed the lube, reading the information on them. “Bite sized, huh? That’s smart.”
“Bull riding isn’t a joke.”
he was alone.
“I wanna,” he had to stop to breathe deeply. “I wanna go, uh, all the way?”
He crossed out the second S in
Dean got a sour taste in his mouth. “Anything for coin,” he muttered. “So you’d bend for every little scrap, is that it?”
Dean snorted to himself as he flipped on the light in the kitchen. Bet Castiel couldn’t even have sex without paying for it. He frowned at himself as he filled a paper mug at the water dispenser. That had been a bit harsh of him, and besides, he
This time he remains rooted to his seat and neither of them even notice when the door silently slides shut after Gordon’s rushed exit. Cas just looks at him, feeling caught but somehow (stupidly) hopeful. Maybe Dean wants to make amends, maybe he can be the man Cas can’t and extend the olive branch?
