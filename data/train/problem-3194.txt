“Samuel Campbell had his own home in the center of the compound,” Leahy says. The night air is so cold Cas can see her breath hanging like puffs of smoke. “They’d left behind the furniture but no personal items. No clothes, pictures. Not even food. Except for the box. It was in Dean’s old room. As far as I could tell, it wasn’t anything special — his old yearbooks we’d already found, some photos. One of them was a family portrait. Dean as a kid, smiling with his dad’s arm around him. But half of the photo was ripped off. The part with his mother.”
It’s now been three weeks and four days since Cas left. Not that Dean’s been keeping track.
“Dean,” Sam says again. “That’s not—”
“No one was there,” Bobby says grimly. “Compound was abandoned. FBI’s already pulled out of town. Leahy needs to talk to you, and she’s bringing Dean home right now. Jody says he’s pretty upset.”
When he opens the door and places Dean on the front seat, Dean doesn’t protest at first. After all, this nice man gave him a new car, and he said he has more here. Dean looks around the seat and the floorboard, screwing his face up at a dirty napkin and some fast food wrappers, but he doesn’t see any more cars.
“Hey, Sam,” she says. He awkwardly walks behind the stand to her, and she awkwardly pulls him into a brief hug. “Would you want to wait over there?” Mary gestures to a booth tucked into a back corner, between the jukebox and what looks like the door to the kitchen. “You’re a little early. My shift ends in five minutes.”
Cas expected Leahy to ask for a guided tour of the park, information on the town. He thought she might allow him to speak with Dean again, since Dean felt uncomfortable in her presence. He didn’t expect her to so openly ask for their help.
“I was going to.”
The ballroom at Shurley Manor is an ostentatious room filled with ostentatious people, and Castiel Novak is bored with it all.
As if timed perfectly a bolt of lightning illuminates the outside air, causing the entire house to be filled with blinding bright light, followed immediately by the loudest crack of thunder Sam’s ever heard. His laptop sparks at the charger, and the screen abruptly goes black as every light in the house goes off, plunging them into darkness.
“It was you,” he says, excited and confused and strangely hopeful. “I gotta tell you, I was thinking there had to be reason that when I’m closer to you, or at least when I’m talking to you, it stops. I was praying to you?”
“Okay, so then why are you here? Why do you need hunters’ help? And I mean, no offense, but why Seth? Guy’s a bag of dicks.”
The venom in Michael’s voice directed at his old boss would be odd if it weren’t for the fact that the man likely killed their closest ally tonight. Cas nods in acquiesce, and Michael leaves the garage without looking back.
Dean keeps a hand over his eyes. His body feels like his now — or at least it feels as much like his as it normally does, which is… not saying much. Multiple possessions and learning that God himself scripted your reality tends to warp a guy’s self-image.
“Cas, something happened on that case.” Dean’s pleading now, but that’s the only explanation that fits with how he feels and he needs Cas to believe him. He closes his eyes and puts his hand to his forehead. Dean reaches for the first time, trying to call a memory back to him rather than waiting on it to resurface on its own.
Those are the days Cas likes best, the days when he’s relieved to watch another bit of grace drain into the vial he carries, the days when he thinks about the rest of his life, his human life with the Winchesters, with an eager readiness.
“No,” he says, a little hurt she’d even ask. “Absolutely not. I was just surprised. Is there— somebody? From one of your classes, maybe?”
Letting go of Cas’s shoulder, Dean silently pulls up the chair.
He’s never been kissed with such care.
But Dean’s spent the past two days doing nothing but drinking and reading fairy lore and ignoring Cas’s texts and calls (let him see what it feels like to get left behind for once), and he’s itching out of his skin. Something has to be done. Dean needs to do it. Whatever
Instead the river dumps him on the leaf-covered ground, spitting him out and sweeping on and away. Disorientated, Cas rubs the water from his eyes and looks around. It’s dark, night when a moment ago it was day. The moon breaks through the top of the trees to illuminate a dark figure standing at the edge of the woods. Cas’s muscles tighten, preparing to spring to his feet to flee or fight.
“Let her go,” she says, her voice softer now. “She held the kid’s hand and told him his parents were dead. It’s been a rough night.” She sighs heavily. “Now, get up out of the mud, both of you.”
Cas reaches out a hand and gently touches Dean’s cheek, tilting his head to get a better look at his nose. If Dean crosses his eyes he can see it, already turning a faint, bluish, blackish mottled mix.
Dean grips the Mark for a moment, then lets go. “My past isn’t pretty. I’m not pretty.” He gestures to his arm with his other hand. “Corruption is a hell of a powerful force. I have to fight it every step I take. I can hardly feel my Grace anymore; I’m more smoke than lightning now. If I’d come back fifteen years ago, angry as I was with you then — it wouldn’t have ended well.”
Alastair seems genuinely confused by the question, eyebrows bunching together as he considers Dean’s face. It doesn’t surprise Dean he doesn’t remember. He was likely one of many who saw the monster underneath the smiling façade.
Cas has twice witnessed the death of someone he loved. The second time, he knew it was coming.
He goes through the motions of helping Cas wrap his feet and take his painkillers, mind on that flash of a memory, disturbing in its realism. For a second Dean really felt like he was with Cas in the bunker, and now he can’t get the fear in Cas’s eyes out of his head.
“RICHIE!” Dean recognizes his father’s bellow, flinching at it in a primal instinct he’s never been able to quite cover up. Richie’s eyes widen impossibly further. “Get your ass out here!”
“Michael — Dean.” It’s the first time Steve has ever said his name, and he says it low and reassuring, where Alastair can’t hear. “Maybe you should leave.”
At first Dean takes that statement and Cas’s disheveled appearance and puts them together the way he would with anyone else, and his gut burns with a flash fire of jealousy, imaging some pushy, horny co-ed getting Cas into bed and “testing” him. Then his rational brain takes over and Dean remembers this is Cas, the man who’s familiar with all the Greek philosophers but cannot name a single present day movie star, the man who once asked him with complete earnestness what “pegging” meant. Cas is naïve and literal. The kids are being brats, end of story.
With that Dean turns and stalks back into camp, filled with a fury he can’t afford to unleash.
Dean blinks at her, and Cas thinks,
“This is our choice, Cas,” she says firmly, blue eyes locked on his. “Jack and I both want this life. We want to help. We wish you would let us.”
Mommy pays a lot of attention to Dean’s new little brother. He knows she has to because Sam can’t do
Dean wants to shake him awake to prove something, to prove Cas doesn’t hold any kind of sway over him these days. To show he doesn’t care if Cas gets a good night’s sleep, he doesn’t care if Cas exists on a diet of coffee and burgers, he doesn’t care that apparently Cas has lost his dream job, too. But he can’t make himself reach over and touch Cas, and Dean tells himself it’s because he never wants to touch Cas again, not because he cares.
Cas walks around Bobby toward the park office, ignoring whatever Jody says before she hangs up. He knows those two have coffee together every Wednesday morning at the diner in town, and he knows sometimes Jody’s trunk stays parked in front of Bobby’s house overnight. They’re confidantes, possibly lovers, and they’re teaming up against him.
“Have you ever told Sam he was dead to you?” Cas snaps, sure of the answer. Dean can call him brother all he wants, but at the end of the day, Cas knows what he truly is — expendable. Not like Sam at all.
When Cas pulls up to the valet stand at El Cobra Dean’s already waiting, wearing the same suit from the ball and shaded from Purgatory’s perpetual rain by the restaurant’s black
Dean’s shoulders slump.
He does wish he could talk to someone, though. Explain that seeing Lisa immediately brought to mind two years of heavenly warfare, the worst mistake of his life, the look in Dean’s eyes when he said, “I wish this changed anything.”
Dean rests his forehead against the window of Sam’s crappy old Volvo. He wishes he’d fought Sam, insisted they take the Impala, insisted he let Dean drive. Realistically, though, Dean knows he’s not in good shape right now. Every time he closes his eyes he pictures James’ (Castiel’s?) head hanging low, those spikes drilled into his skull. How long can he survive like that? Sam’s driving at least fifteen, twenty over the speed limit down the two-lane highway, but it’s still at least two and a half hours to The Bend.
, a small little upturn of one side of his mouth. Then Cas kicks out, connecting with the demon’s (Andrew’s) balls, and it drops him suddenly. Fast, almost too fast for Dean to see, Cas reaches forward, grabs the hand the demon’s using to grip the demon-killing knife, and jabs the knife straight into its throat.
Donna trails off and waggles her eyebrows in a seductive suggestion, and Cas manages to get through the door to Dean’s room.
“Yes,” Cas says sadly, “she did. So I stayed. I came to this epiphany three years after my accident, and it took her another two years to ask for a separation. I tried to love her. I tried to force it, but she could tell. She knew all my memories were back and our relationship had changed, and she knew I wasn’t in love with her. And it hurt her, and I hated myself for it. One day she’d had enough.”
“Come on, Cas,” Jody says, pushing him out the door as he contemplates a day of walking trails in sockless feet. Imagining the odor alone makes him shudder. “We need to take a closer look at our crime scene.”
He gets a final motel room in Tacoma. North Cove is only a two-hour drive from the city, but he’s not sure what shape the cabin is in now, and his drooping eyelids tell him he needs a warm bed and a non-leaking roof over his head. Cas uses the credit card the Winchesters gave him for the room, signs the name Jimmy Novak at check-in. The brothers aren’t looking for him. He’s been gone for days, and they haven’t even called. Sam’s texted a couple of times, sure, but nothing of consequence. And Dean —
Bobby pulls out the chair across from Cas’s desk and sits down, arms crossed over his belly. “Speaking of new hires…”
He closes his eyes tightly until the tears seem back under control, then he lets go of Cas. When he leans back, Cas tilts his head, worried lines forming between his brow. Sam wonders when the angel aged, because he shouldn’t have, but Cas seems older than Jimmy Novak now.
“Jo Harvelle gave us security camera footage from the night your father came looking for you,” Cas admits with the same guilty swoop in his stomach.
On the other hand, making a scene would send a clear message to Roman that Halo knows what he's been doing and put him on high alert for the future.
?” Eileen asks through gritted teeth, clearly looking for a distraction. “Seth?”
“Hi,” he says, and she frowns at him, mud smeared across her nose like some wild thing. “I’m Dean.”
“That’s funny, because I have a great memory — as you may recall from the last time we saw each other in court, when my attention to detail put your client in prison.” Dean keeps his voice even, icy. “And I recall you telling me my friendship with Cas was over, ‘effective immediately,’ that he did not want to speak to me or see me, and I should leave him alone or you’d be tempted to file a restraining order. But Cas didn’t know about any of that. When I asked him why he sicced his guard dog on me, he said he told you to tell me the truth. So. What’s the truth?”
“People he met on the job and old hunters,” he whispers sideways to his niece, keeping his eyes ahead. “I see a few of his friends from the bar, too.”
“I have to get down there.” He starts to pace, mind racing. “Right now.”
He cuts her off with a blast of Grace to the head. Dagon reels, blood dripping from her nose, and Cas’s hand stays up and at the ready.
“Because,” he says, frustrated tears blurring the edges of his vision, “I’m a screw-up, Dean. You should know that already, and I haven't even told you everything. I can’t keep anyone I care about safe. I couldn’t save Dean, but that’s not all of it — Ellen’s daughter Jo died, too. She was a bartender in the warehouse district, and she got shot her first week on the job by some sleazebag she tried to bounce. The Angels weren’t there to save her.” Dean takes a deep breath. “My father went off the rails after Dean died, and I couldn’t help him. Claire and Jack have both been injured while I’ve been chasing Hellfire and the Demons. I don’t want this responsibility anymore! I didn’t ask for any of this!”
, Cas thinks,
Cas’s heartbeat is loud in his ears. Dean’s shoulder tenses under his hand.
it. He doesn’t know how it feels to be trapped in the same nightmare every night, to spend your days doubting yourself and your capabilities, to know you’ll never be able to fix your worst mistake, a mistake that cost people their lives.
“Again,” Cas says, and Claire sighs. But when Jack volleys his Grace at her, she creates a perfect shield to block it. Cas smiles. “Switch.”
“What the fuck?!” Dean shouts, incredulous — and then he hears the hum.
“I’ve seen a lot of things in parks,” he says, and Dean glances up at him, curious at the change in subject. “I’ve been a park ranger for a long time, about a decade. I’ve caught at least five separate couples having sex, which isn’t so odd for this line of work, but I can’t imagine it’s a standard job hazard for others. Certainly no one ever told me about it during school. The amount of used condoms I’ve seen could fill a museum, make an exhibit called ‘Cas’s Worst Nightmare.’”
“Castiel.” Anna was the first to call him Cas, and now she’s the only one who ever calls him by his full name. “We need to talk.”
“Then yes,” he says. “Heal me, and I’ll do it.”
Seth clucks his tongue. The reception’s improved some, and Dean can see that he looks even paler and sicker than he did when they were still at The Bend. He bites back a smartass comment about needing to take your daily vitamins.
The early work crew arrives in an hour. Dean listens to an FM talk show and waits out the last bit of his night, munching on a breakfast burrito Jess probably made but Sam passed off as his own creation.
“You couldn’t withhold sex from me anyway,” Cas says with surety. “You enjoy it too much.”
If they don’t talk much after that, that’s okay.
Cas rubs at his eyes, and Dean realizes he’s tearing up.
“It’s not fine. I didn’t mean to disrespect your wishes - I just didn’t know of them. But Gad, you can trust Bal.”
“Eating for two?” he teased.
Dean looked at Cas, a question in his eyes. Cas nodded. “Much as I love to see your light, Dean, it would be wise to hide it, for now. Keep asking it to dim, like before, until I tell you to stop.”
“Claire, there’s much better things we could do than sleep.” He smiled softly, and moved back toward her.
“So, what do you suggest, Sam? AA? Sit around at a weekly meeting with a bunch of other drunks, where we talk about how great God is? Because I don’t think that’s gonna work,
“Yes, I am. It’s nice. Well, except….”
to kill yourself?”
Sam smiled softly but played with one of the potato chips that was uneaten on his plate, rather than look at Dean.
“Okay, here’s the quick and dirty version. As a baby, Sam was fed demon blood by a demon. I told you about that, before; that was when the fire started that killed our mom. The demon that fed him the blood, Azazel, wanted a leader for his demon army, so he created ‘special children’. Sam was just one, but he was Azazel’s favorite. But another of the ‘special children’, Jake, stabbed Sam in the back and killed him. Sam died in my arms, that time. I- I couldn’t take it. I made a deal with a crossroads demon to bring Sammy back from the dead. Normally, crossroads demons give you what you want, and you have ten years to enjoy it before you’re dragged to Hell. I was given only
“Now, you write that  you have reason to believe that all three of those reaction memories are false. The first one, there’s no way John actually left enough cash or checked in on you often enough, and while you can’t imagine why Alastair gave you a false memory where John was good, it just doesn’t seem real. The second one doesn’t feel right to you for reasons previously discussed, primarily because Sam doesn’t recall John ever having been physically abusive, beyond the neglect. The third one doesn’t feel right to you because John, in your other memories, was homophobic. That all seems to be in line with what we’ve discussed, Dean.
“Roll better,” Dean suggested, winking. “I think it was Miss Scarlet, in the Hall, with the knife.”
“Um… I’ll take a glass of water, if you don’t mind, Jodes,” Dean replied.
“Good, Dean. And now it’s a few nights later. It’s the evening of the attack. You’ve made dinner. Tell me what you remember,” Mia prompted.
Dean nodded, and scrubbed his hands through his hair. “Yeah. Yeah, Mia, I was - hell, I still
He walked around the floor, stopping at each room - whether it currently housed a patient assigned to him or not - for a quick word with the patient and, if possible, their parents. Just some light encouragement, if it wasn’t his patient, but he’d been told before that even that little common touch could really help. With his own patients, he stayed longer.
“Death has a library. Everyone has a predestined ending to their life, written by the three Fates, and those writings are put into books and collected by Death. Some of us, however, have more than one possible ending, depending on choices that we make, because we all have the ‘gift’ of free will. I apparently have a lot of choices that I could make that lead to different endings, but for a while, they all boiled down to one fate - having taken in Michael from Apocolypse World, I died as his vessel, unless I locked myself into what’s called a Ma’lak Box. Then, I’d be unable to die, locked in to the box with Michael for eternity, but he wouldn’t be able to destroy the world, either. I actually built the damn thing, but then Sam convinced me that it didn’t have to be the only option, that we’d find another way, together. And we did. And so her message to me is that my original wide variety of predestined endings, depending on the wide variety of choices, had been restored, and that I’m not slated to die in any of them, or not right away, at least.”
, and broke up with me. And then a ghost tried to kill her father, and she needed help, so she called me.”
relapse, Mia, and I’m taking that seriously, but Sam cleared the Bunker of alcohol – he said if he wants a beer, he’ll just go out for one – so I’m not being tempted. I realize that means that if I do end up in a situation where I’m tempted, it might make it harder to resist, but I really want to just have it be away from me, for the time being. I’ve got other things I need to deal with first, if that makes sense.”
Dean huffed out a tiny laugh. “Of course, Cas. Ask me anything you want to know. I have no dignity left, anyway.”
“No.”
“And how much did you have then?”
“Even then. But I didn’t know.”
tips over and becomes pain, your every nerve stimulated past the point of sanity.
“Excellent. That’s really good, Dean. Now, should I go on to your daily journal entry that you wrote that same day, or should I skip ahead to your next letter to yourself, and come back to the daily entries afterward? Up to you.”
Dean continues to draft proposals to Cas, to write the assigned letters to his younger self, and to journal.
“Yours.” Gad looked vaguely ill. “Not just you, personally, but every current and former omega slave here, or who’s ever been here. Bal, I was a slave, but my slavery was

“I did enjoy it. I have to say, honestly, I didn’t really expect to. And that’s not just the conditioning, but also due to the fact that, while in Hell, I was raped and used sexually, with and without my consent, both gently and violently, depending on who was doing it and when. But Cas was… great. He was a little demanding, and very assertive, very in charge, but also very gentle, never hurt me, and at each step of the way he checked in with me, had me ask for what I wanted next. He didn’t do anything to or with me that I hadn’t asked for explicitly. And that let me relax into it. He took control in making me ask, but I had all the power.”
“The reason Sam made me seek help from you, Mia, was that I get angry easily and push people away. One of the people that I pushed away was
For a moment, it was exhilarating. They were trusted to be alone on such a journey! No guards had been sent, and Dean and Sam would be able to sneak away at the border without any problem at all, because no one would be watching them!
, and I did not ever want to rub your nose in that - or anyone else’s. And
Inias laughed softly. “Such concerns are wise, Your Highness, but wholly unnecessary. The egg would never allow the Heir to come to grief. It would only ever lead you to  your True Mate, a partner who will stand with you through thick and thin. Well, just look at your parents - the egg brought them together, and you can see how happy they are!”
“Of course, I’ll get a bottle from the kitchen for you. Go on in, have a seat.” Mia turned and went into her kitchen, getting a bottle of water from the refrigerator before returning to her office, where Dean had reseated himself on the couch.
“’snot. I’m not your brother, Claire. We’re not at

“Hey, Gad.”
“Good. Have you been tempted to drink at all this week?”
I was speaking in Enochian, then; but the English translation is:
Dean considered that for a moment. “Honestly… no. I don’t think so.”
Dean rolled a twelve, and moved into the Hall.
“Is that
Mia snapped her fingers quietly, and Dean’s eyes fluttered open. He couldn’t even remember having closed them.
“Yeah. And if you have questions, I can explain things.”
“I don’t think you need any more to drink tonight, Dean.”
The King was busy writing something, and waved a hand to indicate he’d heard the comment, and that the Queen could do as she wished. Naomi sighed, and went to her own room to write out some invitations for play dates to the local nobility with children, and even some letters regarding potential long-term fostering arrangements with countries that were close to their own kingdom of Heaven-on-Earth - or Paradisio, as it was sometimes called outside its own borders. She knew that there were a few such kingdoms that had children close to Castiel’s age, and she hoped that by pooling those children in one location - which location might move from time to time to different countries, as children decided they wanted to go home, and took their friends with them - her own child might be less lonely.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. But that was after I came back from Hell.”
“The clocks all stopped working, and we don’t know why; time itself isn’t frozen, but we can’t measure it, and we don’t know how to fix it.
He made another mental note to ask his mother if he could perhaps have another tutor in addition to Inias, one who would tell him fewer outlandish tales and more of the real history of the kingdom. Castiel was a serious child; being a prince, and someday the King, was serious business. He needed a serious tutor.
She continued to beam down at her son as she spoke. “He’s so beautiful, Charles.”
He shook his head, trying to get some of the water out of his hair, and called out, “Cas? I’m home.” He leaned into the small half-bathroom off the foyer, and grabbed a towel, passing it over his hair with one hand, then wrapped the kitten in it carefully.
Just then, he heard a knock on his apartment door.
“Okay, then. That’s good. Moving on. Who’s Lisa?”
“Even after thirty years of vicious torture?”
"And then Dad rushed over to Sammy and pulled him close, and said,

Then he met with Balthazar about some minor administrative issues. Toward the end of the meeting, though, Bal surprised him.

Cas studied Dean’s eyes and touched his forehead briefly again.
And then we both said, together,

Dean's doing a lot of therapeutic writing this week - continued!
“Because I couldn’t.”
“That’s correct. As I recall, last week, when I asked you to do this assignment, you felt a little silly. So, having done the exercise, Dean, how do you feel about it now?”
No. No. There’s a gate, angels can pass through it whenever they want, as long as it’s open. Humans can’t, but angels can go back and forth. It’s not too far from here, actually; I dropped Cas off on my way here.”
“You’re in a good mood,” Sam observed.
“Ah. The ‘one new thing’ policy. I like it. That lets you take things slowly, lets you get used to being intimate at your own pace. Very smart of Cas…. Very good, you stopped yourself from accusing Cas of keeping things from you regarding his need for sleep, you asked Gabe instead. And Gabe rewarded you, I see. Welcomed you to the family. Wow.”
. I’d been watching TV for hours, Sam was sound asleep. By 11:00, I just couldn’t sit there anymore. So I turned the TV off, checked in on Sammy, and then left, locking the door behind me. And I went down to reception, and I played arcade games until the desk clerk told me
it. Other than that, yes, I think you should give this to Cas. But I think you also need to say the words.”
Should Sam and Dean really trust Ruby? If she's telling the truth, why on Earth would Mary be working with Ruby and the Abyssinian Guard?
“But I tried, Cas. I tried to be good. I wanted a return to that sweetness, I wanted him to go back to being gentle, as he’d been that night. I tried so hard to be what he wanted, so he would. But of course, he never did. I failed, over and over and over, until he even started making fun of me for trying, for wanting him to be anything other than vicious to me. And for the last ten years I was downstairs, he made me believe that I deserved to be there. I couldn’t please him. It didn’t matter what I did. I wasn’t enough, wasn’t good enough, never had been.
“Not if you don’t want to, Dean.”
“Now, it’s more that people that I love might… wander away, but they also wander back to me. Sam left, but he came back, and stayed. Cas left, but he came back, and he’s staying. I believe in Cas, I believe in

"The letters to your friends and family are a good idea. Give Sam his letter. Think about whether you want to change that part of the letter to Cas that we talked about, and then give him a version of his letter. And then write to the others, I’d say maybe Claire should be next on the list? And I’ll read them next week, and we can talk about them.
safe, Dean?” Mia asked.
Mia continued on to the next portion of the entry. “This is a nice conversation, in the kitchen with Sam before our last session. He sounds very supportive of you.”
Dean laughed, but he still reached across the table and slugged Sam’s shoulder. “Bitch.”
“No. Alastair is dead. Even if I were to die this afternoon and go back to Hell, he wouldn’t be there. He’s in the Empty. That’s where demons go when they die. And although I’ve been a demon, I’m not one, now. Cas has checked and rechecked to be sure. So I can’t go to the Empty, and there’s no way for Alastair to actually have any claim over me.”
“Please, have a seat. Did you bring your journal?”
“Sam and I have a pretty big place that we inherited. It’s secluded, quiet, and protected from a lot of supernatural creatures. We call it the Bunker. Cas lives – was living – in the Bunker with us. But after that fight, he…left.”
“Oh, yeah. He’s technically in command up there, but he’s got other angels running the show when he’s not there. He wanted to check in, do a little research, talk to some other angels about stuff. He’ll be fine.”
Jody got down a glass and turned on the faucet, but her brow was quirked.

“Did you enjoy that? You’ve said you have enjoyed that, several times. In writing, and in our sessions, both. So, if you’re enjoying that relationship, what does that tell you, Dean?”
“Silly man.”
Then Dean blushed, and held up his left hand. “Yeah. I proposed. We’re engaged.”
Please comment and let me know what you think! :D
“To me, it’s so bright it’s almost blinding, Dean. I’m almost afraid to look directly at you, it’s like looking directly into the sun. In my true form, I could do it, but while in my vessel, I could burn out the retinas, just like any human.”

Mia nodded. “Your fear of abandonment is much more deeply seated than your anger, Dean. It goes back farther in  your life, and it is much more foundational. And it makes perfect sense, Dean. Think about how many people you’ve lost. Your father moved you constantly. You were barely in school, got held back two years because you’d missed so much. How many

in your life, Dean. Every single point of contact has been taken from you, at one time or another. So, when you sniped at Cas,  you were pushing him away in self-sabotage, but you caught that mistake, and owned it. But when you spiraled out of control, it was because you were afraid that

“There was
Dean decided not to get started down that rabbit hole. Thinking of Cas’ good qualities was a favorite pastime, even now, but he knew it would slow him down a little to think, and take delight in thinking, about it, and he wanted to get home and actually

“And then you mention Lisa and Ben; you say you were ‘playing house’ with them while Sam was soulless and hunting without you, that you pretended to have a nice little suburban family life, but it was all just smoke and mirrors, until Sam came to you, you deserted them, and had Cas erase you from their memories.”
“Oh, okay.” Mia turned the page, and saw that Dean had skipped to Monday evening, saying he’d been too busy to write, to process, or to think since the prior entry on Saturday morning.
“No. Not once.”
Gad realized she was right. “Yeah. Probably. I should probably talk to Benny, huh?”
“With different training.”
Dean agreed. “Yeah. We’re doing all right.”
“Yeah.
“No, ma’am.”
He thought about scent blockers, but remembered he’d be in the pool for most of the morning; they’d be washed away within a minute of his first setting foot in the water. He couldn’t rely on blockers. He could only rely on his will today - and he just didn’t think he had it in him.
“Who’s Donatello, Dean?”
Dean tried to remember. “Eight? No, nine. Nine bottles of beer. Doesn’t excuse what I did.”
“Hush,” Cas said, blushing hotly.
Mia nodded. “You can see the sense of it. You
“Yes,” Dean whispered, staring at the floor.
– get it, and I’m sorry I was such a horrible jerk to you.”
“But occasionally shepherding me away from that part of my memories while I slept? Yeah, that sounds like something Cas might have done on his own, to protect me. And if he did, I’d have to say ‘thank you’ to him for it.”
to get some help, too. Between the three of us, the atmosphere in the bunker is still…toxic. I think our talk today is a good start, but I think there have been a lot of misunderstandings and miscommunications between us, over the years, and I don’t think that everything that’s been broken is fixed yet, do you?”
“Yeah, no, I understand, Cas. I’m not taking what you’re saying badly. I asked you to read it and give me perspective, and you can’t do that without all the facts. So, yeah, it’s not my favorite subject, and I don’t enjoy talking about it, but you need to know. Yes. Yes, to all of it, to whatever you’re asking, thinking, imagining.” Dean sighed. He sat up in the booth, and stared down at the table as he spoke.
“You write here that John told you one of the four following things:  one, that he did agree, and, going forward, he made sure to leave enough cash or to at least check in every couple of days; two, John said that it’s not his fault, you should have been a better thief, and then he backhanded you, knocked you down, and beats you with his belt; three, John told you that if you wanted more cash, there were many ways that you could make money, then took you to a bar and pimped you out to a trucker for $50, but at least the guy didn’t hurt you.
“Benny’s one of my all-time best friends. You’d love him, Mia. He’s a sweet old Southern Cajun Creole boy, from Orleans parish, Louisiana. He was a vampire, but he didn’t kill humans; he either drank small animals, or got human blood from blood banks. He had been killed by some other vamps, and when I went to Purgatory, he was already there. He knew that there was a rift that went from Purgatory back to Earth, that would open when a human came near, and he knew where it could be found. He offered to lead me to it, show me how it worked. I insisted on finding Cas, so it took us a lot longer than it should. And Cas was on the run from some Leviathans, so it made it more dangerous than it would have, as well. Benny would, once in a while, calmly explain to me why looking for Cas, or having Cas with us, was a bad idea, but he never tried to stop me from bringing Cas with us, beyond that. He only asked one thing – that I take his soul with us when we left, carried in my flesh, and that I take it back to where his body had been buried, and bring him back. So, I did.
“Wait… Cas
“Oh, right. Well, Gabe is the Archangel Gabriel. He’s also the Norse God, Loki, except not really. He was
Dean nodded. “I was dead for four months; in Hell’s time, that’s forty years.”
Please comment!!  :)
“Yeah.”
“No.”
“Good. Good, I’m…I’m actually feeling pretty good.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck gently.
“Ah. So, you like that Cas understands you, and knows what’s important to you, and is willing to cater to you with regard to what’s important to you, but you don’t feel it necessary to have that which is important to you present at your wedding?” Mia looked at Dean pointedly.
“Didn’t I? I wasn’t intending to hide it from you. I didn’t realize I hadn’t said, Cas.”
“Yeah. Hey, we’ll probably be heading back to Sioux Falls tomorrow, turns out there’s a connection there to the case we were on here. So, I told Jody we’d probably be there for dinner. I know you just saw Claire yesterday, and I know you don’t eat, but….”
“Let’s get back to what I wrote in the journal.”
“Sure.” Dean signaled to the waitress with a smile, as Cas began to read. …
. I guess that’s how it must seem from your perspective. Yeah, I get it.
“Oh, no, I’m not, Mia. Sam’s
that made me recommend you in the first damn place.” Pam sighed again. “Gad, Bal isn’t going to tell anyone. He talked to me because I was the one who recommended you originally, and yes, I outed you, not realizing that was what I was doing, and he hadn’t realized - nor had I - how intensely shamed you felt about all of this. There’s no reason for it, Gad. You made the most of the opportunities you were granted. Good for you. Don’t we all do that?”
Mia laughed. “Okay. I like your letter to Alex, too. How about this one, Dean? Sending?”
He got home, took a shower, scrubbing himself nearly raw, trying to rid himself of his shame. He toweled off and went straight to bed, not bothering with dinner. He was asleep before 7:00.
“But it could have been a disaster. Charles, we can’t let our son go through the terrors you experienced. We have to find him a good mate, and steer them together.”
“Well… to be honest, no. Not completely. I mean, I understand why Cas did what he did. I just wish he hadn’t. And now we’re kinda stuck with the situation, at least temporarily, and it does make me uncomfortable.”
In this third year of the fostering program, there was talk that the location might shift from Paradisio to one of the other countries the next year. Most of the children paid the rumors no mind, knowing they might never come to pass, but Castiel wondered what it might be like in the home countries of his friends, and hoped that it would turn out to be true. He’d miss his parents, of course, but it would be fascinating to see a land as flat as Dean and Sam described Kansas, or with as many mountains as there were in Anna’s home country. Both so different from the rolling hills of Paradisio, which was all he’d ever known.
“Maybe. He’s read my journal, and he’s given me some pretty good feedback on parts of it already. It helped.”
Mia turned the page. “Of course, you’ll
“And is that
Dean shook his head, grateful for the non-royal friend who’d been like a brother to them both. “Thank goodness for Ben. I’m going to miss him.”
Mia nodded. “That makes sense. So, reading the first couple of paragraphs from your Tuesday evening entry, then, it looks like you and Cas had a little bit of an episode to work through, where he was maybe a little disrespectful of your feelings. Tell me about that, Dean.”
“Claire is fierce when it comes to family. After her dad, Jimmy, Cas’ vessel, died, she filed a life insurance claim. But of course, they never found Jimmy’s body, because Cas is using it. So, he was considered ‘missing, presumed dead.’ The insurer refused to pay the claim. But after seven years, his status changed to ‘declared legally dead’ and they had to pay out. And there was a clause or something in the policy that Sam found, when he helped her file the claim, that if they delayed payment but eventually had to pay, there was a penalty. So Claire recently got a check for just over eight million dollars, and decided she wanted to share. She gave Jody one million, she wants to give Sam one million, and to me, Cas, Alex, and Donna, she wants to give seven hundred and fifty thousand each. And I told her I didn’t want her money. And I meant because I think she should have it for herself, not …”
“Not even if you were back on the rack?”
“Well, it went a little weirdly, actually. This was a really long week. I wrote about most of it.” Dean gestured to the notebook.
God, and we had no idea, until God suddenly left the vessel for parts unknown the other day, and now Chuck’s hiding out in the Bunker, and we don’t know if we’ve warded it sufficiently to keep him safe, but today, when I drove out to come here, I had to leave the garage open because the Bunker now can’t be seen from the outside - at all. Jack couldn’t get in when he came home this morning, and he’s the single most powerful being we know of - potentially even stronger than God - and we don’t know how that happened, who did it, or why. Was it to keep us in, or to keep someone else out?
, and I trust it. So, I don’t feel so much that it’s an inevitability that everyone will leave me and I’ll be alone and abandoned, anymore. I’m not that confused, unhappy toddler anymore.”
“Yeah?” Sam waited.
“It did.” Cas’s face is heating, his Grace roiling. “Don’t try to put thoughts in my head. I considered the costs, here. I know what he did to you. I let you decide, and you didn’t kill him because you thought he’d suffer worse trapped in a cell. Is that more just?”
“Yeah.” Dean breathes out again. Everything feels hot and tight, ready to be let loose. “It’s good.” He can feel Cas smile against his neck, and he runs a hand soothingly down his back. “It’s good.”
“That’s all wrong,” Cas says, and Dean does turn to look at him for the first time, surprised to hear him pick up their earlier thread of conversation. “All of that, all of your memories that are gone, those are of dumb things I did.” He sighs heavily, staring at nothing. “Dumb things I did for you.”
When he looks up, Sam and Eileen are both staring at him, incredulous.
“Shut up,” Dean breathes before Cas can say anything, but he grins regardless. “Cocky.”
, he thinks.
Tanner’s theory about the two most recent deaths is an echo of Sheriff Dawes’ — they’re accidents. He wasn’t around for the drowning of Hannah Swift, but he recalls Wendell Perkins well enough.
“Do you want to try to explain this to Agent Leahy?” he asks.
There’s the case itself, which is confusing and open-ended, but hopefully Sam will fix at least some of that when he finally calls to tell them about his interview with Jeffords.
“Don’t touch me,” he says, scrambling backwards, away from Dean, gasping as the rapid movement pulls at his wounds. It stings, but just because Cas wants to be stubborn doesn’t mean Dean has to indulge him.
Yet —
Dean thinks of the Impala turning itself off a few nights ago. He wrote it off as nothing, a temporary mechanical problem, but with the light and the roller and this feeling of eyes on the back of his neck he can’t shake... Dean shudders.
“I’ll text you.” Cas walks backwards, not ready to let Dean out of his sight. He’s so beautiful, backlit by the bar lights.
“Dean, do you mean Cassie?”
“Idjits, all of you,” Bobby grumbles.
Not like that’s saying much.
His family stares at him and Cas swallows down his bitter disappointment and his fear and anger and says, “He was trying to draw the Demons out and he succeeded. He just didn’t get the one he wanted.”
“She was a special needs teacher before I was born,” Dean says, looking at his hands. “She wasn’t fluent, but she’d picked up enough to communicate with a deaf girl in one of her classes. She taught what she remembered to me. Real basic stuff, like the signs for hunger and sadness and love. It helped. She made me feel safe. I started talking to her before anyone else.”
Dagon’s screams are ferocious and never ending, and Cas watches the smoke around her dissipate as Hellfire’s power courses through it. Her human form is coming back into view as the Corruption flails around her, Dagon desperately trying to call it back in a vain attempt to save herself. She’s doubled over with her hands grasping at her cheeks, pulling down her lower eyelids to show the redness around her pupils as her blood vessels burst, her mouth locked open as the fire let loose by Hellfire pushes her own ruined Corruption back inside her body and consumes her.
Dean shakes his head. “You always ask me that,” he mutters. “Claire let me in.”
“No. I couldn’t.” Dean’s eyes flash to black with a faint glimmer of sparking blue underneath, and Cas feels it like a gut punch. “Where is he?” Dean stares directly at Cas. “I know he’s here.”
Dean looks down. “Cas —”
“Oh, yeah.” Sam brushes his ridiculously long hair away from his face. “Of course. I just wanted to give you some company since I don’t have to work early tomorrow, but if you two...”
“Right.” Dean’s lip wobbles. “Cas, I— I was furious. I was scared of him, and I was scared of what he would do to the world if we let him go. And I wanted him to pay for what he did to Mom, I won’t lie. I wanted to kill him, and that’s the truth — until I had the gun pointed at him, then I knew I couldn’t do it. It wasn’t just him — I mean, I couldn’t kill him, he was my kid — but it was you, too. I couldn’t do that to you.” He rubs a hand across his eyes. “Doesn’t matter now, though. It all went to hell anyway.”
“I don’t know,” Dean says. He’s wondered. Obsessed over it, really, from the moment he heard the bunker door slam behind Cas. Where the hell did he go? Where could he go that he would be welcome? Sam and Dean are all he has, and he walked out on them. Thinking about it now, Dean feels the fury building up in his chest again, hot and heavy and curling like smoke around his heart.
“I dunno,” Dean says lazily, apparently unconcerned. “I dunno where he went, but he was here.” Then he hiccups, and the carefree voice transitions into something more frantic, wet like he’s trying to hold back a sob. “I think we left him again!”
“Why would he get his own credit card? He doesn’t know anything about how to keep a scam running.” Sam follows Dean as he closes the Impala’s hood and walks out of the garage, his long legs keeping up with Dean’s fast pace with annoying ease. “I don’t think he’s coming back on his own, and if you don’t go get him now, we’re going to lose track of him. And who knows if we’ll be able to find him again.”
If Eileen’s upset that Cas killed her friend she doesn’t show it, tending to him for days without complaint. Dean even hears her telling Cas stories about faeries from behind the partially open guest room door, but he doesn’t dare get closer.
“No, Cas, we gotta run. You should start packing up the stuff. We’re probably...” Dean glances at his watch out of habit. “Oh, less than an hour away from getting made by the real feds.”
. The movie is almost six months old, and Cas has no interest in seeing it, but—
Claire rips her mask off her face. It leaves red marks around her eyes, lining her cheeks and forehead. She throws the mask in Cas’s direction. It skids across the table, sliding to a stop in front of him.
Then they had sex for the first time. So yeah, best Christmas ever.
you?” he asks, not expecting an answer and not getting one.
? No one questions Pa. No one. That’s not how life here works. You listen to what he says, you follow his every order, you train like the good little soldiers Pa wants you to be. That’s all Dean’s ever gonna be — a soldier. And he’s not even good at it.
Eileen holds up a hand.
“Sam took care of that.”
Dean hears Jody yell and then a loud shot. He tilts his head up, dizzy, nose aching from another indirect hit. He see the puddle of blood on the floor before Jody’s shocked face comes into view. There’s blood splattered across the front of her uniform, droplets on her face.
“Wait!” Cas says again, and this time his yell echoes through the trees, startling the birds from their branches. “Stop!”
He doesn’t know for sure because it’s never really happened before, but he thinks he’s made a friend.
Lisa Braeden is perched on top of a picnic table in a little grassy area next to the motel, on the side closest to their room. Her legs are crossed and she’s leaning back on her hands. She’s staring at him.
“Jack, can you give us a minute,” Sam says, not really asking. Jack leaves, but only after piling more spaghetti on his plate. Sam waits until he’s out of the room before quietly saying, “Dean, you’re still eating, right?”
Sam opens his mouth, but Cas beats him to the punch, says, “We don’t drink on the job.”
Cas wishes Dean wouldn’t ask him things like that. He wishes he could tell Dean everything.
“Doubt it,” Dean jabs, but he follows Cas through the swinging doors.
“Hoods,” the youngest one supplies. “Full-face metal hoods.”
“No, he’s staying with a friend. I promise I’ll fill you in as much as I can as soon as you get here. He’s really okay, Mary. He’s really alive.”
Think of the fucking devil and he shall appear.
. “He’s in bad shape.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes. “Fuck, Dean! You — You disappeared! I thought...”
Jo rocks back on her heels, hands holding onto the edge of the bar for balance. Cas can see the fight she’s having with herself — this is a backwoods place, the kind of place where law enforcement is frowned upon, and people can come and go as they please, doing what they please, without fear of any authority coming down on him. He saw the looks he got for his uniform. It’s a world of us versus them, and he’s
Cas walks.
“Probably. But I’m working with you right now.”
There’s a small clearing just off the path, and in it stands the ghost of Wendell Perkins, wielding a knife and standing over a trembling Ben Braeden. Perkins’ ghost looks feral, as ghosts are wont to do, grinning with broken teeth at Sam and Cas, stringy hair falling down from the cap pushed to just above his eyebrows. He twirls the knife in one hand. It might be immaterial, but Cas knows it can kill, just like the real thing.
He doesn’t respond.
Cas sits there, alone, staring at his hands. He thinks of Dean’s dark memories, all his helpless moments he’s reliving again and again. He thinks of how many of them were caused by him, all the suffering he’s put Dean through. The Empty is a fool. With all of this guilt hanging over him, Cas suspects he’ll never be truly happy, even if they can save Dean.
“Aren’t you FBI?” she says, incredulous. “You’re supposed to tell me it was some thief or something, not —“
They were together for a month. It might as well have been a year in Dean’s eyes. Sleeping in her bed almost every night, scrounging up real work as a bartender, getting to know her friggin’ neighbors — it was an almost dreamlike reprieve from his previous life of motel rooms, monsters, and one-night stands.
“Of course.” Cas reaches over to turn the music down, and because Dean is in love, he lets him. “You put it on my mixtape.”
Cas thinks.
He smells flesh burning and, like he did when his father killed Azazel, Cas turns away so he doesn’t have to see the explosion that follows. He feels it, though. It shakes the beach, rattles the cliffs and pushes back the tide. A Demon never dies quietly.
“Right,” Dean mutters. “I’ve kind of figured that out.”
Dean can’t really explain it. It’s just this twist in his gut telling him
Cas gestures to Anna, who swivels her laptop around to face the others. On the screen are security blueprints for Roman Inc., complete with labeled guard checkpoints and alarm sensors.
“You are too funny!” Lisa shakes her head, laughing genuinely now. “Of course I’m not attempting to coerce federal agents into helping me get out of my taxes.” She winks at him, and Cas can only blink back dazedly.
Once the shock passes, Cas recognizes this is his problem to take care of – his cross to bear. He fumbles for the radio on his belt as he runs along the path to the pine, pressing the call button and shouting “We’ve got a 10-50 F on Lovers’ Lane at the half-mile marker!” through the static buzz.
Fucking teenagers.
“Castiel Novak.”
“I need to get out of here.
He sits straight up, startling Gracie. She leaps from her spot on his chest with a hiss, swatting at his leg in retribution.
When he comes, Cas is panting Dean’s name. He’s always been Dean’s, after all.
, not just about his body or his prowess in bed. Cas approaches sex like it’s yet another way for him to learn everything there is to know about Dean, and Dean kind of likes the attention.
“Dean!”
“Dean, I have an explanation!” Dean is startled by Cas’s ferocity. Cas spins to look back at him. “Do you want to hear it or not? It might not make you forgive me, but at least you’ll stop...” Cas trails off, anger leaving him like air rushing out of a deflated balloon. “At least you’ll stop feeling like I left because of you.”
“You want to be human?” she asks cautiously, which is fair. It’s been a sore subject in the past.
“Your sign language is improving,” Cas says lightly. “Pretty soon you might not need to talk to her.”
He feels Claire staring at him, but he ignores her. She knows about the Demons as a crime syndicate, but she doesn’t know what they did to him. What they made him watch. What they turned him into.
I'm back!
But she’s looking at him with those wide, brown eyes, and he can clearly see her concern. All Cas knows about Lisa Braeden is filtered through the year he caught glimpses of her life from the shadows and through the few times Dean has mentioned her in the years since (usually when he’s had too much to drink and is bemoaning the people he’s lost in list form. Cas always makes the list more than once). If he’s gathered one constant from all these flashes of a life, it’s that Lisa is a devoted mother who loves her son more than anything.
Claire is 15 now, and considers herself to be quite the adult, so when she heard the scuffling downstairs she immediately woke Jack, the 13-year-old, and together they ventured off to find Cas and Dean. Luckily Dean intercepted them in the kitchen and managed to get them to settle for watching TV instead of asking questions.
Silence, Dean’s head pressing harder into Cas’s shoulder, then a soft, “Yes.”
Jo makes a humming noise, says, “Mmm, yeah, tough guy. I hear you’re not out there alone, though. I mean, I wasn’t expecting a slumber party where we braid each other’s hair and talk boys, but Dean Winchester I
“You scared me half to death,” Cas accuses, heart rate picking up at the mere memory of the night. Trapped in his hammock, blood thudding in his ears, watching the dark shape coalesce at the end of the trail. It seems absurd, how his body still reacts to the fear, even though now he knows it was only Dean and not some killer.
“Okay,” Leahy says, and Cas puts his hand on Dean’s knee again. This time he doesn’t pull away. “Good. That’s— Well, not good. But it’s something. Dean, I can’t do much else if I don’t have your cooperation. I can’t find an address for this guy that isn’t an abandoned post office box, and without your testimony none of my digging means anything. So, this is me laying all my cards on the table and asking for the last time — do you want to tell me what happened to you?”
He leaps back up after a brief few moments of disorientation, his grace extending to heal any minor injuries. He can see Sam scrambling to his feet out of the corner of his eye. They scan the woods and the trail, and Sam shouts “Ben!” into the night.
, so he points down and hopes Eileen picks up the cue. She does. Henriksen pulls out his BlackBerry.
Dean wakes gasping, but his lungs don’t ache and his throat isn’t sore from breathing in black air. Sam buries him in a full-body hug, rocking him back into the high grass. Dean looks over his brother’s shoulder and sees his leg is fine, whole down to the light blond hairs that cover it. Jack kneels at his ankles, his eyes fading from yellow back to blue.
When he did finally tell them, that was the end. Funny how when Dean held his hand and introduced (and reintroduced) Cas to his family, that was only the beginning.
“What are you doing to get him to talk?” Eileen asks, and it’s clear from her tone of voice that “torture” would very much be the wrong answer.
It’s while convincing himself that he’s not offended he decides to lie, saying “Joe” without thinking. Immediately both Jason and Diana go “Ohhhh,” in their most mockingly scandalized voices, giggling in unison.
Jody pats his shoulder, two hard slaps against his long-sleeved, buttoned-up work shirt. Shit. His jacket is probably with Green Eyes’ effects. He wiggles his toes in his boots. And so are his socks.
“So Agent Stein already told you what we’re here for?” Sam is saying, and Dean tries to tune into his brother’s voice, hold on to it like a life raft.
“But I do
Cas notes with disappointment Dean doesn’t seem impressed by Halo. He shouldn’t be surprised. Dean isn’t impressed with him in any form.
“His— His father?” Cas thinks of Dean, face drawn, saying,
“I’m not angry.” Sandy blows a breath of hot air onto the window and draws a heart absently on the fogged glass. “But I think Jason is angry, too. He yells at me a lot. I hear him crying, though. At night.”
“Sam said you talked to her.”
Dean leads Cas back toward the pasture — toward the ring. When Cas sees it, he sucks in a breath.
Sam looks across the room, just able to see Cas’s slightly open door. Dean’s probably in there. He jogs lightly through the living room, not sure why it feels so urgent that he reach his brother
“Do I know you?” he asks, just to be sure.
Hellfire —
Cas’s head hurts. He’s rubbed at his temples so often in the last 24 hours he’s probably going to go bald at the edges of his hairline.
But Lucifer was an archangel. Castiel is a seraph with only a glimmer of grace and a love for Dean Winchester.
Sam notices, but he doesn’t say anything in front of Jack, who simply touches the walls of the abandoned farmhouse and catches the whole damn thing on fire, burning it down around the spirit as the three of them scramble through the smoke for the safety of the night air.
Dean said no. Cas loses so much sleep as is, even on the nights when he curls up in the backseat of the Impala to catch a few hours. At least Dean gets to sleep during the day. Cas sticks to naps between classes. It’s probably why he got sick in the first place.
“Room 204. And you two can come back tomorrow to talk to John Doe. He needs to rest today.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
“I love food,” Jack says one day as Dean is picking at his pasta, trying to ignore Sam’s pointed glare from across the table. Jack devoured his plate within seconds. “I love it.”
“So I have a message for Halo, who I suspect is in this very room.” The crowd titters. “I’m going to be taking down a convoy of Roman Inc. vehicles tonight. You can try to stop me, or you can join me — either way, I’ll see you there. To everyone else — enjoy the rest of your night. Your lives won’t be so easy from here on out.”
Dean signs something haltingly, and Eileen sighs. “I’m glad you trust me now. But this is over my head.”
“So,” Dean says again, and he has to clear his throat against the lump settling there. “Are you, uh, gonna go back to Heaven then? You’re probably their hero now, killing Lucifer and all. Or you said you wanted to go heal people?”
“Yeah.” His voice is soft. “I’m sorry for a lot of things I did as Dean Smith.”
He throws his truck into park and jumps out, leaving the engine running. A light mist coats the parking lot in an eerie glow under the sodium lights at the pumps as Cas weaves between trucks, ignoring the curious stares tracking his progress. He never changed out of the sweats he slept in. What a sight he must make to these truckers, filling up on fuel and coffee before they hit the road, watching the strange man in sleep clothes trot through the rain with desperation in his eyes.
Samuel raises his eyebrows pointedly, and Dean can’t help but ask, “What happened to her?” There’s an edge to the question, a tone he tries not to take with his father because it could earn him a backhand or a sucker punch, but Dean’s never been a fast learner. “Why wouldn’t you tell me I had a sister? Why wouldn’t
She doesn’t elaborate because she doesn’t have to. Cas knows exactly what she’s talking about.
Ann Marie opens her mouth as if she wants to protest, but before she can say anything Sandy sticks her head out of the passenger window and yells, “Uncle Cas!”
Cas’s eyes widen. Great, now he gets it and he looks scared out of his mind. Dean steps back so quickly Cas almost falls over onto the counter.
Having sex with Cas, being
It isn’t long before he sees the headlights cutting across the living room. Cas is at the door in seconds, opening it before Leahy and Dean are even out of the car. Dean’s shoulders are slumped, and he’s carrying a cardboard box with his name scrawled on the side in handwriting Cas doesn’t recognize.
He tells Dean the tale of Eve that only battle-trained angels and a few ancient demons would remember. How the mother of humanity first had only two sons, Cain and Abel, whom she loved dearly. How she wept when Cain killed Abel, how she and Adam tried uselessly for another child, someone to love enough to ease their loss. How Eve stood at the first crossroads and asked Hell for help when Heaven wouldn’t answer. How Cain was the demon who stood before her. First she asked her eldest son to return his younger brother to her, but Cain refused.
Dean falls through empty air, arms closing around nothing. He hits the ground hard.
He doesn’t love Cas like a brother, he’s in love with Cas like he was once in love with Lisa, but it’s stronger. More sure, less dependent on unrealistic expectations and stilted attempts at normalcy. Because Cas knows Dean, knows him from Hell to the apocalypse to Purgatory and to the Darkness and everywhere in between, and Cas has always been there just the same.
Sam sighs. Dean doesn’t turn his eyes from the road, but he can see his brother raking his fingers through his hair, searching for the right thing to say. They should be approaching the Nebraska border. Any second now and they’ll officially be one state over from the bunker, where Dean left Cas and practically ran away.
His nose smarts, his head aches and he feels the imprint of Cas on his lips. Dean’s not in a position to think beyond this second.
of a small explosion leaves both James and Dean curled around each other on the ground as the after-shock dies away.
“Yeah,” Dean snarls. “Fuck you.”
“Who’s they?” Dean asks. Josephine shrugs.
, Cas thinks. Aloud, he says, “Fine. Lunch at El Cobra?” He purposefully picks an upscale casual restaurant in downtown Purgatory where Dean hopefully won’t be offended by the menu prices.
Cas leans against the wall next to his bedroom door. Gracie sticks her head out, gazing up at him wide-eyed. She weaves her way in and out of his spread feet, rubbing against his ankles and purring. It almost makes him want to cry.
He wishes Eileen was here so he could sign her name, but she’s not, so Dean chokes back his fear and asks, “Gwen?”
But he can’t say that aloud. He can barely think it in his own head.
The table in the bunker’s kitchen is loaded, covered in burgers, chips and queso, various grilled vegetables and one delicious, homemade apple pie that Dean slaved over, shooing away anyone who tried to sneak an early bite.
Cas covers his mouth with a hand and nods, still hacking slightly.
Dean laughs, bitter and a little watery. “I don’t know if I feel good,” he says.
Cas presses a fist to his mouth, overwhelmed. People journey to national parks to commit suicide all the time — his colleagues in busier areas find about one per year, usually hangings or gunshot victims. But in his ten years with the service, Cas has never been the one to find a body. He’s seen death before, yes, but always in expected places. War zones. Hospitals. Never like this, with the cold October air whistling through the trees and the birds chirping contentedly from their nests.
Cas turns away from Hannah, away from Heaven, and walks back to his car. She doesn’t call after him, not that he expected her to. He gets in and drives away, forcing himself not to look back.
Dean reaches for his belt and pulls out a gun. Its barrel is long and thin, an old Colt model. When Dean cocks the trigger, the barrel begins to glow. Cas can’t make out the runes on the gun from where he stands, but he sees how Alastair’s eyes widen as Dean presses the muzzle to his forehead.
Dean idly wonders if this is what a real family dinner is supposed to feel like, then he remembers why they’re all here in one place — because Cas is dead. They should be wearing black. This is a funeral meal, with pizza in place of homemade casserole.
Her face tightens, her lips pressing into a thin line and eyes scrunching in a way that shows how hard she’s trying not to cry. Ann Marie knows what that means.
“I’ll ask him,” he says, knowing Cas will say yes. Dean’s the one holding a grudge so tightly he won’t let even Cas talk him out of it.
Cas just shakes his head as Rita lets out the breath with a gasp.
The pain in his ankle and toe is nothing compared to the feeling of the teeth latching onto his calf through his jeans, dragging him back to the dirt. He can’t help the scream that forces its way past his lips when the second dog reaches him and latches onto his arm. It’s a scream of surrender, of defeat.
It may not be the right word — Cas could barely listen to the explanation Sam could barely give, something about Death transferring Dean somewhere else, somewhere out of reach — but it feels right. Dean might not have been able to truly die, not with the Mark on his arm, but they’ll never see him again just the same.
“I’m trying to do more with my money.” And he’s trying to ease back on the Halo missions. In the past week, he’s gone out in the mask four nights instead of seven. For once it didn’t make him feel guilty to take a break. He was still doing good, in maybe an even more tangible way. “You were right. I don’t need it, so I have a responsibility to give it to people who do. Thank you for reminding me of that.”
He plays the self-help podcasts when he feels his heart rate start to climb, because Sam always said they helped him. But Sam never went through what Cas went through. He ignores the exit signs for the small town and tries to focus on
“Yeah, I’m sure you do know. I’m sure you read the dozens of texts and listened to all the voicemails, and you decided every time, ‘Hey, you know what’s not important to me? Letting my so-called best friend know I’m fucking alive.’”
“I do.”
It’s strange, how badly Dean wants James to say yes, to go with them. He doesn’t think this is just about Claire anymore, but he doesn’t know what more there is to his sudden, obsessive need to have this man open up more to him.
“That’s all right.” He takes the burnt bread and shows Dean the garbage can, hidden underneath the sink. “The toaster burns anything if you set it above the second setting. You couldn’t have known that.”
, he wonders, and he feels something wet trickle from his nose, run down over his lips.
He’s not sure why he’s here, either. He’s gathered that this branch of the Men of Letters detests anything non-human, so perhaps it was only a matter of time before they turned on him. He hadn’t expected them to use Mary to get him here, but, then again, this is not the first time he's been blindsided by someone’s deceptive kindness.
Jo turns on her heel, storming back through the dark wood toward the highway. Dean opens his mouth to call out to her, but Jody shakes her head.
A long silence follows, and Dean almost wishes the fucking light would appear.
“Why —” James begins, then starts again, something strained in his voice that Dean doesn’t understand, “Why would you want to help me?”
“Yes. After all, someone will need to help me lead these people into the new world order. I’m not getting any younger, and when the apocalypse comes I might be gone.”
“I’m working here, Cas.” He gestures over at the light. “That thing changes once every five minutes. You better go catch it while it’s green.”
Cas stands up, giving Dean an up close and personal view of his steadily hardening cock. So not turned off by the bloody nose, then. Dean licks his lips and takes the hand Cas offers him, careful to keep his balance this time as he stands.
Cas shrugs.
Mary looks at her sons — Sam, calm and composed, so willing to make compromises for the people he loves, and Dean, a little more raw and bruised, clearly afraid of her answer. And she knows what she needs to do.
Cas grins at Dean’s irreverence. “They’d already lost Cain, a major blow. The angels were in a panic at the thought of Hell sinking its claws into the mother of humanity. This was at a time when the Host still believed they should care for the humans, place our Father's last creations above all else. They — well, we — decided that the terms of Eve’s agreement with Cain were unclear, and so we felt justified in retrieving her soul for Heaven.”
The drive into western Montana is beautiful, a vast improvement on his trek through Kansas and eastern Wyoming. The swaying fields of the plains give way to dense forests and ever rising terrain as he approaches the Continental Divide. He’d been trying to make his way to this forest years ago, back when he was first human, and he’d ended up detouring to the south, headed to Idaho instead. He couldn’t stand the thought of being dwarfed by his own creation, small and insignificant in the face of the power he’d once welded. He’s becoming human again, but this time he doesn’t care. He thinks the mountains would be a comfort, like old friends. Heaven knows Cas doesn’t have enough of those.
“What is your definition of ‘well?’” Cas asks, snapping the badge shut, eyes narrowing into his What Are You Talking About squint.
“Hey,” Dean says, and he scrambles to sit on his knees so he can see over the dashboard. The man is driving out of the parking lot,
“I, uh, I dig scars, too.”
“Yeah,” Dean breathes, holding the box with the red car to his chest. He looks up at the stranger. The man smiles at him.
“I think it’s the best theory.” Dean rolls his empty glass between his palms. “And it fucking sucks. Because the way you right the wrong is to put the circle back in place, and there’s no way we can do that. It’s gone.”
“You haven’t been his professor in two years.” Dean looks between the two of them. Sam looks at the ground.
Cas isn’t looking at him — Sam knows he hates to be reminded of how sick he is, because Cas still feels like his failure to heal the cancer is a failure of his entire mission since 2008,
“I have a theory,” Gwen announces, leaning back as far as she can in the tight space, pressing her back into a tree trunk. “I think you’re seeing the future.”
“Yeah, I am. Thanks for asking, mom.” They both choose not to comment on the poor choice of words. “I just don’t feel much like pasta tonight. Jack fucking loves it, though, so...”
).  “And my earlier offer of dinner still stands.” Dean’s stomach drops, and Cas’s eyes dart briefly from Lisa to him and then back. “It’s almost 8:30, surely you guys could use some real food?”
Dean eventually lost track of the number of insults she hurled at him before she left to go sit in her car. They got pretty creative toward the end. Cas whispered as she stormed away, “What does she mean by ‘We weren’t your Stepford family side project?’ Or what about ‘your Truman Show experiment?’ I have heard of these films, but I don’t understand...”
Cas has always been expendable.
He’s not shocked by the furious glare Claire gives him — her default setting is outrage — but Jack’s is a bit of a surprise. His disposition is that of a sunflower — always bright and cheerful. The anger heating Jack’s cheeks and making his yellowed Grace flash in his eyes is new and unsettling.
“I hate this,” Cas declares as the credits roll.
“Well,” Cas says, determined to move away from the subject for his own sake more than Dean’s, “there is a new

“I made a mistake,” he says, and his voice cracks. “I made a deal with Wayne Whittaker.”
, he thinks
“Sam?”
On the back she's scrawled out an invitation even he can understand — “Room 111.”
“Oh yeah?” Dean asks around a mouthful of cinnamon apples. “What’s the occasion?”
“I was angry,” Cas says, and he looks at his burger, not at Dean. “Because I want to explain myself to you, and you won’t let me. But I realized you owe me nothing, and I have nothing for you but poor excuses. So. Here I am, trying to earn my way back into your good graces.”
Cas grimaces around a mouthful of dirt-flavored coffee. He can just imagine Bobby calling Jody up about “baby’s first suicide victim.” He has a decade of experience, but Bobby still calls him “kid” half the time. It should be insulting, but Cas appreciates the way it makes him feel like he’s endeared himself to the old man. His own parents never called him anything but Castiel, or Castiel James when they were angry.
“Cas?” Dean asks, worried but not sure if he should move closer. Cas puts his head between his knees.
Sam is still looking at her like she’s far more beautiful than a sunrise viewed from atop Mt. Everest, but Cas is tired and would like to go back to the motel. He thought he knew what it meant, to be the third wheel — he was always the backup to Sam and Dean, never quite a complete part of the team — but after spending just under five hours watching Sam awkwardly flirt with Ann Marie, he’s now fully aware of how Dean tried to include Cas any time he was around.
“She didn’t ask me to contact you,” Eileen says. “I think she just wanted to make sure you were doing okay, or maybe she hoped I would mention her to you.”
He can ignore it most of the time. Focus on Sam, focus on the job. If he needs something else to feel shitty about, something to take the edge off the pain, he can just focus on Mom or Jack or any of the other countless people they’ve lost. He misses them, too — fuck, he misses Mom and Jack so much that sometimes it hurts to breathe through it, waking up gasping with the phantom feel of his mother’s hand on his face or the memory of Jack’s small, delighted smile burned into his corneas. Dean has pain to spare.
Eileen's likely waiting for him in their room, and Sam wants to go to her, to take comfort in her soothing words and soft body, but there’s something else he has to do first.
Cas’s chopsticks pause halfway to his lips, mouth hanging open. He hadn’t thought he was that obvious.
Nothing happens.
Dean turns to face him, a small wave washing over his feet. He smiles. God, Cas loves that smile. “So. You made your choice, huh?”
When he wakes up, there’s a beautiful brunette woman leaning over him, her brow furrowed in concern.
“Well, sort of,” Cas says. “Claire isn’t actually my niece, but I feel like our relationship is roughly equivalent to that particular familial bond.” He thinks for a moment. “That is, when she’s not angry with me.”
So, yeah, Dean has had a lot to worry about in his life, but this particular, potent mix of stress and heartbreak and jealousy feels new.
“I’m leaving,” Jack announces to the room at large as Cas walks over to Dean and pours him more wine. “You can go back to— whatever, now.”
Henriksen raises his eyebrows. “Okay then. Well, here goes.” And he presses the call button.
Dean rolls them, pinning Cas beneath him. He looks at the will-o’-the-wisp, watches it sweep up stray branches and pull up clumps of grass as it calls to Cas and attempts to immobilize him. And he knows what he needs to do.
“Sorry,” Deacon whispered later, leading Dean back to his cell, “but I know you like it a little rough.”
Sam didn’t try to argue, and Cas thinks that the youngest Winchester is well aware how jumpy Dean has felt about any of them splitting up on a job since Cas and Lucifer, and since Sam and that whole fiasco with the British Men of Letters.
All four of them turn their heads to see Cas standing in the doorway on heavily bandaged feet, leaning against the wall. He’s only wearing too-big sweatpants, so the entirety of his gauze-covered chest is on display. It’s not exactly a fear-inducing sight.
It’s playing with fire to continue to work with them, live with them. Every night spent sitting next to Dean in a shitty motel, every case researched alongside Sam, every story told to Jack is another chance that Cas takes. He feels as though he‘s always inching closer and closer to his happiest moment and thus his inevitable demise. Every time Sam makes him laugh, every time Jack surprises and delights him, every time he even looks at Dean — that’s a time Cas risks it all.
“I didn’t say that I don’t feel it necessary to have that which is important to me present at my wedding. I said that I don’t have pictures of Emma and Ben available to put out at the wedding. And, even if I did, I wouldn’t put them out, for a couple of reasons.”
“Let’s look at that ‘actively’ versus ‘subconsciously’ notion, Dean. Do you believe, actively, that you belong to anyone at all?” Mia asked.
“And then on Saturday morning, you write that you and Cas made love, and it was the healthiest sex you’ve ever had. I assume you mean from a mental health standpoint?”
“Not really.”
“We talked about Donna last session. I like this letter to her. Are you planning to send this one, Dean?”
“But Cas, when I get angry with you…. I’m
He passed the Millers’ house, and noticed that they had nicely decorated it for Hallowe’en, a carved pumpkin with a small tea light sending out a small beacon of light from their porch; a fake owl and a plastic skeleton, both hanging from the porch ceiling, the owl mid-flight; twinkle lights (in clear, purple, orange, and green; Dean liked “fairy lighting” in general, but he thought this particular color mix was a tad garish); and purple, orangle, black, and green tissue-paper streamers. Those were going to get ruined in the rain.
"Just relax. Let all the tension and stress of the last few weeks drain out of you and into the couch. Don’t worry, the couch can take it.”
Dean trailed off when he noticed the expression on Cas’ face.
Then Benny shared his own secret. Most people at NRR thought he was just a therapist, but in fact he was a full psychiatrist, able to prescribe medications and diagnose medical conditions, with his own M.D. and Ph.D. combination. He told Gad that there were only three people at NRR who knew that about him, prior to that evening - Castiel, Balthazar, and Pamela. “And now, you, Brother.”
She sighed softly as she went back inside and closed the door behind her, sliding the deadbolt closed.
Dean huffed out a laugh. “Fair enough.”

“You know, I didn’t realize that Bal didn’t know your full qualifications. If you’d told me that you didn’t want people to know, I would’ve respected that.”
“Nah, I told you, I’m thirsty.” He danced for a moment, turning  Claire, then, when she was away from the refrigerator, whirled and opened it, getting out yet another beer.
, just like the mocking pity. It just hadn’t been an act I could immediately see through. He’d promised punishment if I failed, so he would set me up to fail him. I might as well have stayed on the rack; by day, I was a torturer; by night, I went back to being one of the tortured – with Alastair as my only inquisitor. He did keep the others off my back, but then, he’d set them on me in the first place.

Naomi had agreed that all of the children living in the palace or on the palace grounds could be educated together with the Prince, and had hired sufficient tutors for all of them. Lessons were had each morning from 7:00 to noon, and in the afternoons, the children had chores or other activities, like piano or singing lessons, or horse-back riding. Occasionally, one or two of the tutors would take them on short day trips outside the palace grounds, even. Castiel, in particular, loved those jaunts, which gave him, for a short time, a feeling of freedom and peace that he couldn’t seem to find in his own home.

“Kiddo, you got a little mini-sun in your soul, and it is blazing brightly.

” Mia made another note.
“Correct.”
Cas and Dean glanced at each other in surprise. There’d be no grown-ups traveling with them? The two of them were 16, the rest much younger. Were they supposed to shepherd three kids on a long journey? Particularly for royal children, such was unheard of, even in the most peaceful times.
Dean snorted. “I’ve done and said worse, drunk. I’m not proud of
"So, Dean, did your father shove or hit you in this incident?” Mia probed, gently.
“Except for the fact that you don’t love me, Cas. And that’s all right. I don’t expect you to.” Dean stared at the floor.
Dean was trembling, unable to speak above a whisper, as he continued, “Like I said, I’ve been expecting you to leave me behind for a long time.

“Dean, do you remember the first time I spoke to you?”
“We have alternate universes bleeding through into this one, people going missing between universes, and we don’t know why or how widespread the problem is. Cas and Balthazar and Gabriel have been kind of roaming the countryside fixing the bleed-through spots as they find them, but they can only do so much, and they can’t go too far without chancing ending up in another universe themselves.

Don’t be afraid to ask for things you need, as the railroad employees have been instructed to provide you with whatever you ask for, but please, don’t be unreasonable in your demands. Simple foods, at reasonable meal times, when the railroad employees are already cooking for themselves, will get you a great deal farther than asking for outlandish items that they cannot supply. You may ask for extra pillows and blankets, they’ll have plenty. There are few travelers these days, so, if you are cold, or otherwise uncomfortable, you may speak up, but be polite about it, yes? Be modest, quiet, and well-behaved. Show the staff that I’ve taught you something about manners, please?”
“Good for you, Dean. I think that may be the healthiest thing you’ve said to me yet.”
“That’s fine, thank you.”

Dean shook his head. “No.” He looked up at Mia. “It isn’t.”

“Okay. Tell me about Crowley and Rowena?”
She thought it would be good for Castiel to know that there were other children of his own rank in the world, that it might help him find his own place. And then perhaps he might give up on his silly dream of being a healer. She laughed gently, remembering when he’d told her that he needed to learn all about herbal cures. The child was destined to be King, he wouldn’t have time to be running around dispensing peppermint to the staff with gastric issues, for pity’s sake! She wasn’t sure where the notion had come from, but she’d fired Inias, just in case, and hired new tutors who were decidedly more strict and formal with Castiel. After all, he’d asked for fewer outlandish tales, hadn’t he? A King who was a healer - now, that was an outlandish tale, indeed.
What the hell, man?”
Dean bit his lip and worried it with his teeth a bit. “Can I think about it and let you know?”
Mia got to the part of the entry where Dean wrote about Cas being in love with him, and admitted to being in love with Cas.
“I told you earlier that I’ve been conflicted about my feelings for Cas for a long time. That’s why. I’ve been in love with Cas for ages, but I didn’t feel that I deserved him, didn’t think he’d ever feel the same way. But he admitted it first. And once he’d said it to me, well, that ended the conflict. Because deserve it or not, Cas’ love is something I’ve always wanted.”
Dean huffed out a breath, but then nodded slowly. “Yeah, okay, Sammy. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to talk about stuff.”
to be Loki, with Loki’s knowledge, in order to hide out from the Heavenly host. Gabe’s Sam’s guardian angel, and, as of this morning, the two of them are dating.”
Dean nodded. “A really long time later - just last year, in fact - we found this ancient Chinese artifact, a pearl, that let us have what our hearts most desired. And Sam let me use it, and I thought I’d be getting Michael out of my head, y’know? But instead, I brought Dad forward in time from 2003. And we were able to talk to him and say goodbye, finally. So, I did get closure with Dad eventually, but literally, not until years - over a decade - after he died. With Bobby, I got it after he died, but through his haunting, and it took just, oh, I dunno, maybe six, seven months.”
"And, I want you to write a letter to

“No. I wouldn’t let him. If it looked like Sam might get into trouble, I found a way to get Dad’s attention. Made him hit me, instead,” Dean admitted.
“Nope, I’ll just bring it in, and we’re good. Unless you want to get something for us to drink?” Cas headed back into the kitchen, tossing the last bit back over his shoulder.
“But, just so you understand, Mia - Cas doesn’t remove my bad memories just because they’re bad. That’s why I have multiple sets of memories from before Hell; Cas didn’t want to do damage by removing memories that could have been real, even where it was clear that Alastair had to have implanted at least one alternate memory, unless it was clearly a fake because obvious details were wrong. He didn’t want to remove Lisa and Ben’s memories of me, either; he only did so to protect them, when I begged him to do so, and he didn’t like it, then. He wouldn’t remove memories of a dream, no matter how bad it was. No, I don’t even need to ask Cas about that.
Dean nodded, an almost wistful expression on his face.
, said she was a monster, couldn’t be trusted, he should have killed her. And when Sam refused to go back and do the job, I did it, instead. I killed her.  And when Sam killed Emma, he was protecting me, yes; but he was also taking his revenge for my having killed Amy. As I say in the journal entry, it’s the one thing we never speak to each other about, because I’m still so angry with Sam about it. Which probably means I should, huh?”

He went back upstairs, ironed a shirt and put it on, then repeated the process with his dress slacks. Then he left again for his Wednesday morning rounds at Seattle Children’s Hospital, the only hospital in town where he still maintained privileges. He had about twenty patients, all under the age of 16, and none of them were victims of war. Most had yet to present, even.
“And I took it. And eight more. Two of those after Jody’d gone to bed, and it was just me and Claire in the kitchen. And I said some things I shouldn’t have said, got too close, got pushy.

He leaned far forward, moving slowly, towards the tiny black kitten cowering under the bush. He held out his hand and let the baby sniff it. Suddenly, a loud rumble erupted, and the kitten pounced on his hand, claws extended, but just in play; even as a baby, this kit knew how to be careful.
exactly what your reaction to that gentle touch would be, Dean, make no mistake. He played you. He lied. You said it yourself -
“They did it all to me, Cas. Everything. Beatings, cuttings, rape, sex, whipping, suspension, burning – you name it, they did it. All day, every day, for thirty years. And every day, Alastair would come to me at the end of the day. And he’d stand over whatever was left of me, and he’d laugh. Or he’d act like he was sorrowful and pitying, but he was really mocking me. But however he acted, it all had the same effect – it pissed me off, and it gave me resolve. I was not going to give in to that asshole. I was not going to give him what he wanted, I was not going to take his deal. I’d refuse and he’d rebuild me, and they’d start again.
As he passed the last stand of trees in the little woods between the Smiths' house and their own, Dean upped the pace yet again. The wind was whipping up, and he wanted to get himself and the kitten inside, pronto.

, and always have been. I’ve always been attracted to certain men. I just never let myself admit it. I don’t know if they’re true memories, or not, because of what Alastair did, but I remember my father as being a homophobic asshole. If those memories are correct, he’d hate that I’m in this relationship with Cas, would probably disown me because of it. Until Cas, I never met a guy that I wanted enough to risk my father’s disapproval.”
“Oh, yeah, I’m fine. Thanks,” he said, absently.
In Benny’s case, it wasn’t shame. It was more that some of the omega slaves were crafty about their medications. They’d been used to stealing drugs from their owners, to make their slavery tolerable, and some were addicted. Benny didn’t want them trying to manipulate him into writing pain meds they didn’t really need. If he thought someone needed a specific medication for a specific purpose, he sent them down the hall to Pam’s office, and had her look them over.
“Still silly. I didn’t look back at the prior entries, as you’d asked, but, Mia, I’m sure I wrote the same damn thing every time. I mean, it’s not like my memories are gonna change from day to day. I just don’t get the point of it.” Dean kept his tone reasonable, but Mia knew he’d been frustrated.
“Yeah. God - Chuck - whatever, he made this gun, he called it the Equalizer. He wanted me to use it to shoot Jack. What he didn’t initially tell me was that it didn’t shoot regular bullets; it gathers a piece of the shooter’s soul, and shoots that - and whatever damage is done to the target, is done to the shooter as well. So, if you shoot God, and you kill him, well, you die, too. So if I
one. You got some time to squeeze me in?”
“Correct. Your relationship with Cas. You consider yourself a partner, of equal merit, to Castiel?”
“And then you wrote this: ‘Being that it probably IS something only a god could do, there's probably nothing that I can do to fix it; yet I still have this odd sense that I ought to be doing something about it. I have no notion of what that would be, exactly, but... something. I can't save everyone, and I can't fix every problem, and not everything is my responsibility. Rationally, I know that; but I still have this niggling sense of... failure? Impending doom? I'm not even sure how to describe it.’ Dean.”
“So, when do you think you started doing that?”
“I like the way you put that, Mia. Cas has always been supportive of me, and you’re right, the difference now is that I’m allowing myself to accept it.” Dean nodded.
At that point, an irritated-looking nurse strode in. “Miss Wills! What did I tell you about making noise! Oh. Dr. Jones. I didn’t see you there.”
Mia just grinned.

“Well, do you remember, did I tell you about the period of time where Sam was soulless, after Cas rescued him from the Cage?”
“I’m okay, Dean. I didn’t like it, but I’m okay.

“And here, you let Cas drive, and that made him happy. And then you reminded him that once the two of you are married, he’ll own half the car, and you say that he hadn’t realized that marrying you would have some tangible benefit. And so you told him that whatever you have is his to share, and you write here that you meant it and there wasn’t anything you have that you wouldn’t willingly give to Cas, but then giving to others has never been your problem, it’s learning how to take for yourself. So, Dean, tell me. Are you learning to take things for yourself, now?”
“Amazing what a good relationship can do, isn’t it, Dean?” Mia grinned at him. He grinned back.
way we choose to be together, I want it all. I’m gettin’ a little greedy in my old age, here.” Dean grinned.
friends, Cas, we’re
“Tuesday afternoon.”
Mia read through Wednesday’s journal entry. “Did Sam find an assistant?”
“Well, he was. When Lucifer was using Sam as his vessel, Cas threw a flaming grenade at Michael in Adam’s body. It killed Adam and Michael. Then Lucifer killed Cas, and Jimmy. Then God resurrected Michael and Cas in Adam and Jimmy’s bodies, but without Adam and Jimmy – their souls went straight to Heaven. Cas has died a few times; he just keeps coming back in the same body. At this point, that body is Cas’ now. Jimmy has no further use for it, and Cas is accustomed to it. He could be in a female vessel – he was, briefly, in the body of Jimmy’s daughter, Claire – but the body he’s in just suits him.” Dean shrugged. “Jimmy’s hot. Anyway, Amelia was Jimmy’s wife – Claire’s mother. She died. We rescued her from a Grigori that had been feeding on her, but she was too weak to survive for very long; just long enough to say goodbye to Claire, really. Jimmy prayed to be used as an angel’s vessel, and Cas chose him because he needed one right around that same time – it was just after Cas rescued me from Hell, and he couldn’t communicate without a vessel. If Cas hadn’t chosen him, some other angel would have, and they wouldn’t have been as nice to Jimmy, or as good to Claire.”
“So the next thing you wrote was a letter to yourself at ages 28-29, starting right after someone named Jake Tapper… cut through Sam’s spinal cord and kidneys with a hunting knife, and so you made a deal with a demon, and you tried to hide it from Bobby, but he figured it out, then you tried to hide it from Sam, and it took him a bit longer, but eventually he figured it out, as well. You write about the Hellhound coming for you, and you sort of gloss over your Hell experiences, passing over it to when you were rescued by Castiel, though you don’t know who or what got you out, at first. And then Bobby doesn’t believe it’s you, when you turn up on his doorstep. But once you’ve proved that it’s you, you say here, he simply accepts it. So, Dean, how did you prove that it was really you?”
You also wrote here more about your relationship with Sam, and your relationship with Cas.  You say that you don’t feel good enough for Cas, so you push him away, but you really want for him to stay. You sound conflicted, Dean.”
“Um… Oh, sure, why not. I’m not driving.” Jody got him a bottle from the fridge and handed it to him. He took a swig, and swallowed hard. He closed his eyes, and savored the taste.
“Um, what did she
“I really do, Mia. I really believe that good things really do happen and really are possible, and that I can have a part in that. I never used to, but I really do, now. And Cas is a huge part of that, but it’s also me, letting people in, not just Cas, but Sam, and Claire, and Jody, and Donna, and all the people in my life who love me, that I shut out for so long, when I didn’t need to, at all. I was blind, Mia, but now my eyes are open, and I’m keeping them that way.”
Castiel shook his head. The curricle drew up directly next to the train, and palace staff started unloading the baggage, as the royal children stayed put for the moment. The plan called for all of them to be on the same train at the start. Then, Sam and Dean would change trains closer to the border between Paradisio and Kansas, before the rails took a sharp turn to the east, toward Elyseum. Hopefully, that would prevent anyone from noticing that they were gone until it was too late to go after them.
“And that brings us to your next letter to your younger self, and this is to yourself at a few ages, looks like. It’s about two women, Cassie, and Layla. Tell me about them, Dean.”
“Yeah, there I’m clueless. We’ve asked, Billie won’t clarify.”
“Until when, Dean?”
“He’s not, and I’m glad of that, but it doesn’t completely relieve my mind, y’know?”
No matter how much relief it gave me to be off the rack, I had no right to torture others in order to get down off of it.

At least Cas, Anna, and Alfie got fed, finally. Hopefully, that'll continue.

. She was actually Cas’ commanding officer in his garrison for a long time, but she rebelled, and fell to Earth, and got separated from her grace on the way down. She was reborn as a human as a result, and was adopted by the Milton family. But when she was a teenager, she started hearing voices in her head. It was Angel Radio, but she didn’t know that, and she couldn’t turn it off or tune it out, and what the angels were saying scared her, so she committed herself for psychiatric treatment. She checked herself out shortly before I got out of Hell. The rest of the important stuff is in the letter. It’s one of three I made copies of, to have Cas deliver, if possible; neither he nor I know if she’s in Heaven. He wasn’t sure if she had been particularly loyal to him, enough that The Cosmic Entity would have awakened her and sent her back to help us.”
; demons lie. After that first night, and that first day, he didn’t keep up the gentle sweetness. It had been an
“It might help,” Mia smiled. “So, you all got together in the Bunker after our last session for a meeting, looks like, and then you went to write your journal entry. And then, at the very end, you write that you need to have a talk with Cas about where the two of you want your relationship to go, long-term, and… ‘Cas Winchester’, Dean? Anything you want to tell me?”
“All right, children, please, all of you, gather around. I have some announcements, and I don’t want to have to yell,” Miss Bradbury gestured to bring all of them in close to her, and smiled, albeit a touch sadly. “This will be the last I’ll see of you, children. Queen Naomi instructed me to bring you to the station and see you all off, and then to take myself home, and consider my employment ended.”
He found the key he needed, slid it inside the lock, and pushed the door open. He put the keys back in his jacket pocket, then thought better of it, and hung them on the little key rack Cas had put up on the wall by the door the day he’d given Dean his keys to the house and told him it was now his house, too - officially. The jacket was wet, and needed to be washed, anyway, so he’d toss it in the laundry with the rest of his clothes from yesterday and today.
“Sam currently has, in his brain’s ‘memory palace,’ a version of Lucifer, and a version of the Archangel Michael. We were seeking Amara’s assistance in removing them from there, since she’s technically the one who put them there, although she didn’t realize that was what she was doing.”
“No.”
fine. And you won’t let me care for you the way I should. And really, there’s not much more I can do. You have to
, is that it, Dean?” Cas’ voice was low and venomous in its intensity.
“Except...what?”
Dean took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. “Cas. What is this light the key to?
Mia smiled. “Good. Okay, so, that gets us up to the journal entry from Sunday afternoon. Basically, people who had gone off to various places to try to gather information were checking back in with what they’d learned, seems like, and you and Castiel and Balthazar drove back to Kansas - oh, with Cas driving, and you sitting in the back seat?”
“Yeah, he hired a guy through a temp agency. That way, we don’t have to worry about handling payroll and whatever, they invoice us and we cut them a check, and they take care of everything. The guy’s pretty cool, too; his name is Shann. I don’t have all that much to do with him, but Sam says he’s a hard worker, and they get along.”
“He wanted me to kill Sammy. Almost had me do it, too. Made me use his own scythe. But instead of hitting Sam with it, I went over Sam’s head, and kept turning, and hit Death with it, instead. And at first, nothing happened, but then, he just crumbled away into dust, and was gone. Apparently, once Death died, the next reaper to die, which was Billie, moved up to take his place. Actually, Cas killed Billie.”
, you’re still that terrified four-year-old, running from a house fire with your brother in your arms, not understanding where your mother went and why she won’t come back.”
pain. And when their pain is
Dean took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. “I’m not going to stop showing Cas that I care. Because I do. But I’m going to stop thinking of it as making up to him for past damage, and just do it because I love him, now.”
Dean nodded. “Okay.”
Lots and lots and lots of therapeutic writing this week, in fact. TBC.  ;)
“For the most part? What about the rest?” Mia asked.
“Do I want to know, Dean?”
“Yeah, well. Typical of John, y’know?” Dean, who had been excited only a few moments before, now seemed lifeless, his eyes downcast, his shoulders slumping.
Once at NRR and in the pool, Gad didn’t have time to think about his shame; he had to focus on the work. His scent stayed even and clean, and the omegas with whom he worked didn’t notice anything off about him at all. At noon, he tidied up the pool area, took a shower, toweled dry, got dressed, and went to find Balthazar. He had an apology to deliver.
“You’re very welcome, Dean.”
“And you took it.”
“Because I couldn’t. Sam could rebel because Sam was the golden child who did no wrong, who was to be protected at all costs, the smart one, the good one. I was just….”
“So, Dean, last time you were here, you didn’t seem to want to talk. What’s changed?”
“Later on, Sam met Becky again, in Las Vegas. She fed him a love potion that she got from a demon who had possessed a wiccan. She used the love potion to get Sam to marry her, and take her to a cabin on honeymoon. Then she ran out of potion, and Sam started to come out of it, so she knocked him out and tied him to the bed while she tried to get more. Eventually, he got out of the situation, and the marriage – they had it annulled. Now she’s married to someone else, with two kids. Not sending that one, either.”
? It’d
. Not really.”
By 5:00, Dean was looking for a place to stop for dinner. He saw a sign for a likely place, and pointed it out. “Hey, Cas, let’s swing in there. I’m getting hungry again, you could use a break… and I could use an objective eye on my journal entry. I’d like you to read about my dream, get your perspective on what you think my subconscious is trying to say.”
“Nope. That’s it.”
He thought about going up and knocking on their door to warn them of the impending storm, if they weren’t aware, thinking that they might want to at least unplug the lights, and take the candle out of the jack-o-lantern for the duration. He started up their front walk, and then, he heard it.

“I’m a man in love, my darling. We’re all silly. I found you, and you have given me a son, and our life is perfect.”
“No…?”
“Right. And then why don’t you see if Castiel is available to come with you next week? And then we can all three of us sit down and talk about the plans you both made, see how far you got, talk about what you both decided you want. Does that work?”
“He is, yes.”

happened, but I would have had to have been pretty oblivious not to notice something like that at some point.
“But the tradition….”
Mia looked at Dean intently for a moment, nodded, and continued reading. “You say here you were startled by your own reflection because you looked better than you had in a long time, and you think it’s because you’re happy.”
It wasn’t about you, I swear.” Dean was sweating.
"And Dad said

“You don’t get to make that decision, Dean. I get to choose when and at whom I smile. You’re not the boss of me.” Cas grinned.
“Well, Cas, there are two answers to that. The first is

“Did I really forget to say that to you again, in this form? I guess I did. I’m sorry, Dean. I know I’ve told you other times, though, that I love you.
“You bet, thanks. Can I help?” Dean inquired.
. She was in love with the Sam in the books. As you noted, Chuck leaves out a lot of details, but she assumed that she knew Sam, that there was a deep connection between herself and Sam. She was a lot obsessive, and a little weird.
related, baby.” He leaned in and nuzzled her neck, and she squirmed away.
“You’re amazing, Claire. I don’t des….”
Dean blushed a little, but nodded.
“Okay. Seems like damning with faint praise, Dean.”
Dean's therapy session continues.
“Okay. Well, as you may recall from the books, Azazel wanted Sam to lead his demon army, but he also put in motion a plan for Sam to be on the throne of Hell. Azazel either wasn’t sure he’d be able to get Lucifer out of the Cage, or if Lucifer would win the battle against Michael, but either way, he wanted to have his own candidate for the throne, and that was Sam. He put in a claim on the throne for Sam before Sam was even born. Now, of course, Sam isn’t interested, but I figure that’s what Billie was referencing in her message to him.”
You had to spend your grace and your time coming back here and removing the alcohol from my system, and dealing with Claire’s upset and my stupidity, and….”
And then he left.”
, don’t you see?
Mia nodded. “You write here that you intended to show this entry to Sam, and you ask him not to argue with you about it. Did he read it?”
“The same way you did yesterday and every day since you were hired by NRR: with the same grace and the same steady, precise, God-given
Jody rolled a three and moved three squares; her turn ended. She took a swig of her beer, and set it down next to Dean’s glass. Dean took a drink of water, and moved the glass to his left, so it was away from the beer.
“Now, I only met Lydia
“Your idea of writing letters to people is a good one, Dean.”
"Mia said I should try to work through it on my own, first, but then I should talk to you, and see what you remember.
that you still belong to him. And what I mean by that is this - is there some part of you that - subconsciously, maybe - thinks that because you gave yourself to Alastair in the beginning, willingly, of your own volition and by your own choice, that his claim was somehow valid, and, because it was then supposed to be for eternity, now remains so?”
“Dean – coffee? Or beer?” Jody offered.
believe in you, Dean. I always have. I always will. Even when you don’t believe in yourself.
“But that isn’t technically what I asked you, Dean. I didn’t ask you if you
“Before we get back into my journal, I wanted to ask you, about Cas coming in for a combined session? Is that because you think that I’m so screwed up that you need him to keep an eye on me, or because the two of us together need to work on our relationship, or because you think he might need therapy, too, or… something else, altogether? I’m not objecting to any of that, it all sounds - well, probable, actually. I’m just wondering.”
“I won’t come back if you don’t want me to,” Sam tells her as they stand up. “I... I'll understand.”
Dean thinks, but then Cas is working Dean out of his own jacket, and then his shirt. Dean, not to be beat, attacks the buttons on Cas’s shirt like they’ve personally insulted him, popping a few right off and ripping his tie off none too carefully along the way.
“It’s Thanksgiving.” Her voice is clearer now, but Dean hears a slight shake to it. “Is— Did you find something?”
“What did you lie to her about?” Gwen cringes when he answers with another shotgun blast. “I thought you were just sleeping together. What, did she really think you would go to Indiana with her and the kid?”
“I can talk to him,” Cas says.
John and Sam Winchester are right behind her. Dean doesn’t recognize John they way he recognized Mary, but it’s startling to see a bit of his own face reflected in the older man. John’s eyes are teary as he steps forward and claps Dean on the back, taking Mary’s place. Dean’s arms come up automatically to hug back, but he’s still looking at his mom, standing right behind them as if she can’t bear to move an inch away.
“Good night, Dean.” With that, Cas stands and walks past him to the stairs, taking them hard and fast, two at a time, as if he can’t wait to get away from Dean. Which, fair. Sometimes Dean wishes he could get away from himself, split from his body like so much black smoke, pour out of all the cracks in his soul and just float. Of course, the last time he tried that, he reached out to Cas anyway.
Dean learned much later — after many more cups of coffee and movies and one terrible experience at a slam poetry night — that Cas’s relationships with his many siblings are tumultuous at best, hostile at worse. He admired Dean’s stupid voicemail because it showed the kind of familial love he’d never had. Once, on a blue moon occasion when Cas got spectacularly drunk, he’d confessed his wish to have someone who loved him, which struck Dean dumb. He thought his love for Cas was obvious, but apparently not.
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice. He’s out of the office in two steps, closing the door behind and running past a bewildered Mama in the living room, up the stairs and into the darkness of his bedroom. He shuts his own door, much softer, and drops to his knees. Reaching under his bed, Dean finds the loose floorboard and pulls, wrenching it out of place. A splinter stabs at his thumb, but he ignores it.
“Daddy’s dead.” The flames almost seem to avoid Alastair as he walks slowly down the hall, like he’s the one in control of them. Cas’s eyes widen. “You’re too late.”
Sam presses his lips together until they start to whiten, then says, “Just because you gave up doesn’t mean I have.”
A wrinkled hand gently touches his. “If you’re talking literally, I’ll get you a map, sugar. But if we’re speaking metaphorically, I’m afraid sometimes we have to keep wandering till we’re found.”
“I’ll always choose you over anyone, Dean,” he says with steady conviction. “This was not me picking sides. It’s a family matter. I thought it best for Sam to explain his own reasoning for meeting with your mother.”
“Leave me alone,” Cas mumbles into the couch pillow. He could drink himself to death, given time and copious amounts of liquor, but that’s not his intention. He’s just drinking to forget that he’s let both of his children get injured
Claire looks him up and down. “You’re a little old to be called ‘hot,’” she says, which for a twenty-something is the height of bitter insults.
Mama didn’t get him anything this year. She usually knits him something, a new scarf or a cap for next winter, so Dean’s surprised when Pa is the only parent to give him a gift — a new knife with a pearl inlay, perfectly balanced for throwing.
“Hey Sam, this is Claire,” it reads. “I was wondering if you know what’s up with Cas? He usually texts me like at least one emoji a day, but he hasn’t in a while. He’s not responding to my texts, either. And Dean’s not answering.”
He flexes the wings again. Against her protests, he’d attached the neurological sensors for the wings directly to his brain stem six years ago. They haven’t experienced any issues so far, but Anna still checks them every time he goes out. “They feel good.”
— and be left alone forever. He doesn’t know which he wants more.
Cas’s hand comes up, hesitant and slow, and cups his cheek. Dean’s gut churns in anticipation as Cas’s gaze roves over his face and settles on his lips.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this for you,” Claire says for the tenth time. “You owe me big time.”
“I tried to teach him some humility by always being the most handsome brother, but unfortunately it just didn’t take.”
“Thank you?” Dean huffs a light laugh.
Claire’s sitting on top of the kitchen counter when Cas walks in that night, a roll of cookie dough halfway to her lips, long blonde hair in a disheveled bun, makeup dark around her eyes like war paint. She pauses when she sees Cas, rolling her eyes before stuffing the dough in her mouth. “Claire, get down from there,” Ellen tells her as she shuffles around the room preparing lunch and dessert, but she doesn’t mean it. Ellen never makes the kids do anything they don’t want to do. She’s become something of a grandmother-figure now her original kids, Anna and Balthazar and Cas, are grown.
“Astonishing,” Cas says, and Dean shrugs.
“That’s not fair!” Gwen points her free hand at his face. “And you know it! It’s different; he’s one of us!”
A small voice in Dean’s head whispers,
Dean closes his eyes. He feels so, so heavy and worn.
of a well-aimed punch, the grunt as the recipient absorbs it. Alastair laughs again, sounding out of breath.
“There’s a pretty obvious way to tell,” Leahy says. “You could just ask Dean.”
“I get that,” Dean says, because he does.
“Always worry about you,” Dean murmurs, and Cas smiles, just slightly. He looks over to respond, but Dean has clearly fallen asleep.
He stares at the ceiling in the dark, tracing the knots in the wooden boards with his eyes while he waits for his wife to respond. It doesn’t take long.
“Ben. His name is Ben. Anyway, I just wondered if, in your professional opinion, maybe I should go ahead and go get him? Just in case there is someone out there in the woods or something... Although he’ll probably hate me for it. He’s seventeen, and I’m just so embarrassing to him.”
Oh, so she did notice Dean creeping up...
“Oh come on,
“What are we going to do?” he asks, because yeah, Cas killed the man whose body is currently slumped next to their car, but Dean let him. He could have stepped in, could have stopped it. He didn’t want to. This is a
Dean nods hurriedly. “Yes! Seth called him Castiel. But I knew before then, and no, Sam, no I don’t know how — I just did.” Sam gives him the bitchiest face, but Dean presses on. “And when we met him... you should have seen the look on his face when I asked if he was James Novak. Sam, you have to trust me. Just, please let’s help him, then you can ask any questions you want. But we can’t just leave him like this!”
They all laugh a little, a strange, teary-eyed, smiling trio.
“And I,” he says, shuddering, gasping, “know yours.”
They’re both in the room now, waiting on more test results. Sam is so damn tired, but he can feel him coming — feel Death coming. He knows it won’t be long now. He’s not going to sleep while they’re here. There are things he has to tell them, if he can find the energy to get the words out.
“Where’s your mother?”
Ann Marie’s eyes dart between them, her mouth falling open slightly.
“It’s symbolic of
“I saw it,” she answers. “Tell me where you are, and I’ll come get you.”
“But I prayed to you,” he says weakly. “Why would I want you to go and then want you to come back?”
Dean, not feeling like explaining to Cas the nuances behind pop culture references, cut him off with a gruff, “Can we just not talk right now? Please?”
“Now they’re widening the road, and they’ve decided they want me,” Cas says. He looks down at his hands, and Dean can’t help himself. He reaches over to touch Cas’s knee, the smallest gesture of comfort he can provide.
Sam clenches the wheel till his knuckles turn white. He can see Dean, his eyes wide and wet as Death reached for him.
Green Eyes blinks, slowly, and Cas stares at him again, the dark circles under his eyes and his long lashes. He holds up a hand and makes what Cas thinks is a single sign, holding up two fingers and pressing them against his thumb. Leahy purses her lips.
He yanks Dean’s shirt off first, but Dean is right behind him, pulling Cas’s t-shirt off his head and tossing it across the room. Cas has nothing to hide now, and they’re obviously doing this rough, so he picks Dean up and pins him between his waist and the wall. Dean groans, then grins. It’s a vicious sort of grin, reminds Cas of a boy taunting him during practice fights —
He wants to go home so bad. After Mama and Papa have gone to bed, he closes his eyes and he prays to the angels Mommy always talks about. He asks them to find him and save him.
Gwen stands, loading her own gun and frowning as she snaps the barrel back into place. “He asked me to marry him.”
When Cas leaves he keeps the door open a crack. Dean doesn’t come out the rest of the day.
Cas leaves the kitchen to grab blankets from the hall closet, passing one over to Dean and sitting next to him on the couch. This scene — tea brewing, both of them wrapped up in Cas’s grandma’s old quilts, sitting too close to be respectable bros — reminds Dean of everything they used to have. Everything he’s decided he wants back.
Dean watches the directional signs. His exit should be coming up soon.
“Are you telling me the most eligible man in Purgatory isn’t regularly getting some?” Dean teases, eyes bright.
“Yeah,” he answers, more gruffly than he intended.
“I think you’re probably not a dick. Not all the time, anyway. I wonder... I wonder what happened to you. I wonder why you’re alone, when you should be with us.” Just saying that gives Dean even greater confidence. He’s right, Cas should be with him and Sam. But mostly him. “I wonder if you’re my ghost. That what Sam calls it, sometimes. The person I talk to when no one else is around. You know, this —” Dean gestures between them. “— feels sort of like that. Talking to someone who can’t talk back. But it also feels right, like I wanted to talk to you all along. Do you know what I mean?”
“We don’t have time for—” Cas is interrupted by a spurt of gunfire below. The three immediately look down as shouts erupt from Roman’s men. They’re dodging behind the trucks and crates, swinging their own weapons toward the tunnel entrance, which Cas and Jack can’t see from their vantage point.
“Listen Agent... Cas, I haven’t eaten yet.” She hops down from the table and stands up, brushes her hands down the sides of her jeans. “Maybe you’d like to go to dinner with me?”
“No,” Jeffords whispers, so quietly his voice is barely audible. “But I’m telling you the truth, Agent Burke. There was something else out there that night.”
“I don’t know that Dean will accept that,” he tells her.
Dean, and I know this will adversely affect him...”
By the time they’ve finished with the rough patch and placed a tarp over the wounded area, Cas’s stomach is growling fiercely. They climb down from the roof and head to the kitchen, Sam still yapping, and Cas sets about making sandwiches. He glances over at the dining room table — he hasn’t quite managed to get the dark spot out of the stain at the head of the table, even after scrubbing all the blood off — but Sam takes a seat at the opposite end.
Cas looks around the room. His guests are huddling together, shaken. His sister’s mouth is pressed into a thin line, face grim.
Dean also hears Cas’s footsteps before he sees the angel step through the brush at the edge of the parking lot, back from another walk around the campsite. Dean knows if this were a normal hunt he would be out at the river, trying his best to incite the vampire/ghost/Australian water monster into attacking him. Getting it over with. Fast and bloody.
He’s still thinking about those hands when Dean lets out a whoop, startling Cas into nearly dropping his coffee. Even Bobby jumps at the sound, so unused to hearing any vocalizations from Dean.
From the first time they met, Cas stayed on constant edge, worried about something — infighting at the university, an assignment his students botched, the latest paper he needed peer reviewed. Dean prided himself on being Cas’s oasis, the one person Cas turned to when he needed a break. Dean introduced him to the finer things in a life outside of academia — the Roadhouse karaoke nights, making fun of bad movies, Led Zeppelin and an open highway — and in return, Cas let Dean take care of him, something Sam hadn’t allowed in ages.
Cas’s mouth gapes open. He’s trying to work out what he’s supposed to do with this number when a familiar voice fills the room.
Alicia Banes calls Dean’s cell phone while he works on the Impala.
Ann Marie downs the rest of her drink in one go, slamming the empty glass violently on the counter. Then she looks between them, mouth twisted into a frown.
“Okay,” Dean says. He sits on the bed, hesitating as if he’s unsure of his welcome. Cas wants to kiss him but he really does reek, so instead he promises, “I’ll be out in a minute.”
They have him on speaker phone, chatting about their day. They're wrapping up a case somewhere in Kentucky, something about a ghoul. After Cas asks his question, Alicia and Max remain uncharacteristically silent for several seconds.
Dean turns and smiles at him, a black smudge of oil or grease streaked across his nose, white teeth gleaming, and he looks glorious.
“Sammy, please, can you just —” A brief racket as Dean cusses at some driver who cut him off. “I can’t... Can you just get here?”
“I love you,” he says, when he feels like he can speak without bursting into tears and bringing the rain back.
Lisa, of course, knows nothing of that. She knows nothing of Dean, thanks to Cas.
Who the fuck knows now that Chuck’s gone, and who the fuck cares? Certainly not Dean.
“I disagree,” Cas says, and he moves back, moves away from Dean, who looks both hurt and angry. “I understand why they feel how they do. I don’t blame them... I just miss them. Sometimes.”
“Really?” Dean leans forward. “The Shurley Foundation is your best?” The foundation.
and Dean shoved that idea away.
Cas clenches his jaw and waits for the inevitable
) and several from Cas — bits of his own research into the fairy problem, anecdotes about his classes today. They even text like a couple now, if your typical couple discussed whether a murderous fairy can be killed by silver bullets.
“They saw me for myself and they didn’t like what they saw,” Cas continues as if he hasn’t heard Dean. “So I guess if I were with them it wouldn’t matter what I did. I couldn’t fake it to appease them. They’ve already made up their minds about me.” He sighs. “I’m not trying to trivialize what you’re going through, Dean. I think if they love you, they’ll understand how complicated this situation is and they’ll stand by you as you work through it. And if they don’t, then they don’t deserve you.” He looks Dean in the eye then, and Dean pushes the bowl aside and walks around the counter, stopping in front of Cas.
It’s not much, but it’s a start.
He slides the next page forward.
Sam huffs a laugh.
“We know that. It won’t change how Dean feels.” Cas thinks of how tense Dean’s been for the last week, wound so tight it looked like the faintest breeze could cause him to snap. He’ll be worse now. “I don’t know what to say to him.”
His headache rivals the worst one he’s ever had — one he got when he was eighteen and stupid and drank an entire bottle of vodka to impress a girl whose name he can no longer recall. He groans and shoves his face into a pillow, safe to wallow now that Cas is situated on the other bed. Cas is propped up against his own pillows, dry and warm under the covers, watching a documentary about space exploration on mute.
“Did you notice any additional footprints in the vicinity of the tree?”
Cas stares at the ceiling as he says, “I don’t care who comes. Either of you, you’re both the same.”
Dean wants to pull away. He doesn’t. His feet feel rooted to the cheap linoleum flooring. “But what?” he asks, trying to keep his voice level.
“Nothing, Cas. It’s nothing,” Dean says, rubbing a hand over his face so Cas can’t read his expression. “The case, Sam, please, I’m begging you.”
It’s James in the chair, his hands tied down, too. He’s shirtless, chest covered in bruises and vicious, oozing cuts, some that look almost like wards carved into his skin. His head hangs low, and Dean can’t see his face, but he can see the blood dripping from his ears and matted in his hair, which is covered by some type of helmet, a cruel-looking silver dome. Dean realizes with horror that there are spikes protruding from the helmet, jabbed straight into James’ skull.
Dr. Tran clears Dean for release two days later, and he leaves the hospital in the clothes Cas bought for him, carrying the bear in one hand and his release papers in the other. He’s not in a great mood, despite being cleared to go home, so Cas doesn’t try to start a conversation on the drive out to the park office. Dean reads his release packet, brow furrowed as he scans the list of medications they’ll have to pick up at the pharmacy once Cas is off work. No doubt he’s getting worked up over the quoted prices, but Cas isn’t about to start the argument on how he’s fine with paying for them.
He also isn’t expecting the startled, bitter-tinged laugh from the man, whose face is still covered in shadow.
“You’re not taking advantage of me,” Dean snaps. “I made the move on you, remember? And you think I don’t know I’m vulnerable? Cas, I’ve spent the past two months going out of my mind with anxiety, and you’re the only fucking person who can make me feel normal for five seconds.”
“What made you change your mind?” Dean asks. The sun is setting behind him, casting a golden glow across his freckled skin. Before it all went to hell, Cas once fell in love with him here, on this beach.
“You’re worrying her,” he says.
“Yeah, well. I went to a bar,” Dean lies. “I needed to blow off some steam.”
“Dean, hear me out,” Sam repeats. Dean looks to Cas, who nods his agreement. “Perkins died six months ago, in the river. The people killed here recently have all been found along the river, each one downstream from the last.”
“But, that thing you said about companionship... Cas, wait, you’ve lost your siblings? I thought you were the one that convinced them to help God nuke Amara! Cas, what... what happened with the angels?”
Mills purses her lips together. “Of course. They’re the buyers for whatever shipments Hellfire’s been stealing?”
“Yeah, fine. Let’s get you to the bath.”
Dean keeps fucking crying on people, but this time it feels safer — alone in his room with his brother, who’s seen him at his lowest and stuck with him anyway — so Dean lets Sam side-hug him while he cries.
“Right,” Mary says. “I’m sorry; I’ll try harder.”
“I guess.” He’s never cared much for labeling his sexuality. “I prefer men, though. You?”
It’s a dream come true for the hardcore, old-school hunters, the
Dean does have to let go eventually. He somehow knows Cas won’t be the first to pull away. Cas gives and gives and gives, and Dean takes and takes and takes. He leans back, breaking their hold on each other. As he pulls away, Cas lightly touches his chin with the tips of fingers and makes Dean look at him. For a second Dean thinks Cas might kiss him, and his heart jumps.
Dean taps his fingers on the dashboard.
He taps the road winding up the mountain and into the valley.
“He’s dead,” Cas says by rote. That loss has sunk in, and yet the sting seems to have somehow grown worse following Sam's death. “He died more than thirty years ago.”
Sam is worried about Dean.
“The light is killing people.” Cas pushes the papers back into a pile and stares down at them like they should hold a definitive answer. “That sounds insane, Dean. You know that, right?”
He’s a little unsteady on his feet after three beers; his grace tucked away now, dormant. He calls it to the forefront, ready to make himself sober. As Cas heads to the back of the bar, dodging the tables spread out in the center of the room, his hand grazes the back of a chair. He’s nearly floored by the sudden sense that
Cas’s eyes widen comically over the thermos. He lowers it from his lips, guilty.
Cas huffs a laugh. “Sometimes, just simple salt and burns. But I — I mostly work at a diner and clean houses for my landlady.”
“That’s why you removed your clothes?”
Cas kisses her on the forehead and runs for the house.
