After their heart to heart, Sam and Dean hugged and called it a night. Sam went to his and Eileen's room, and Dean decided to sneak up to Cas's room. He opened the door very slowly, walked in, and closed it even more slowly behind him, taking a deep breath. He turned to Cas in a twirl that was maybe a bit too silly and just stood there for a while, looking at the ground, then back at Cas, then back at the ground.
Sam and Eileen eventually go home, still not saying much. They're gonna lie on their bed and she's gonna hold Sam until he falls asleep and in the morning he'll be a freer man, but right now he doesn't even know what he's feeling, just that it's too much of
"I love you. So much. I've loved you for years. And I never thought you could love me back but you do and I love you too and Chuck's gone so what are we waiting for? There's nothing holding us back. So I guess what I want to say is-"
Dean scoffs at the word but makes a face of someone whose mind is racing at that thought. What they have is so much stronger and deeper and bigger than he feels the word "boyfriend" can contain, but at the same time, Dean has never had a boyfriend. Because he couldn't. But now he can. So he does. Cas is his boyfriend.
"It's good to see you too, Cas." They all hugged and took a moment to enjoy the moment. They were all there, everyone was okay. They'd won.
Castiel thinks of all this and then thinks about himself, all these things he now understands because of humans, made more beautiful because of them, because of Dean, that answered questions he'd had for millions of years without even being aware of it. He wonders if other angels have these questions too, and realizes his experience with them tells him no, they don't. Why is he different? Was it the moment he saw God scared that changed him? Such a small thing, being at that place at that precise time. Was something different already in him before? For eons he thought everything he would later recognize as doubt was what God wanted him to think, everything he would later know as wanting was the wanting of God moving through him. But now he knows it wasn't so. He wonders what came first, the doubt or the disillusionment. Did God leave the angels because they were seeing the truth or did angels start seeing the truth because He'd left? Castiel wonders if this is what humans call the chicken and the egg. He thinks of how he found the Ctenophora beautiful when they first appeared, for the same reason God resented them, and how he fell in love with Dean the moment he held his soul for the same reasons God resented him too. Has Castiel always been in awe of defiance? Has that always been holy to him? Maybe he really did always have a crack in his chassis. But knowing he would have never fully realized it was there without Dean changes everything, and that wouldn't have happened if Dean hadn't died. God causes death, death turns the engine that defeats God, death outlives God. In Life and in their own lives too. Castiel looks at that for the first time and finds it beautiful in its own way.
“Cas?” Dean tapped lightly on the door. “Cas, open up, baby,” Dean hadn’t seen Cas since lunch, and he was starting to worry.
“Holy shit…” Sam said when they entered The Gold Halo Casino. Dean had heard it was fancy, but damn, this was the life. There were sparkling chandeliers overhead and the walls were made of white marble with black velvet curtains draped over them. Everything looked as it had been tinged with gold.
The pain had dulled a bit and Cas had learned to live with it. He didn’t like to touch them, but he would occasionally try to doctor them a bit by pulling bloodied feathers. He knew he needed to get rid of the damaged parts to heal faster, but he didn’t have the time, and he was in too much pain to try harder than he already had.
“Yours. Please.” Cas was so tired. “Smells like you,” he said before he could stop himself. The walk to Dean’s room was full of coddling and hushed words, a desperate assurance that Cas figured was more for Dean than him at this point. His embarrassment absorbed none of the words, but the omega in Cas soaked in the sound of Dean’s voice and the feel of his hands on his shoulders.
“I gotcha, baby,” Dean said, rolling them over once again. Dean thrust as hard and as fast as he could into his angel, just attempting to satisfy his heat. Cas let out little punched out, exhausted noises of pleasure as he came for a final time, finally melting into the sheets.
Dean lifted the lid to reveal a woven leather bracelet with the initials ‘DW’ embossed into a metal plate in the center. He smiled. “Cas, it’s beautiful, angel.”
“Hey, at least it only happens every 12,000 years or so. I do it every day,” Dean said, and Cas smiled gently, clearly fighting the growing heat in his body. “I’ll tell Sam to go somewhere else for a bit. I’ll meet you in my bedroom once you’re ready?”
“Ugh!” The demon got up, walking away from Cas to confront the boys. “I don’t believe it for a second! That son of a bitch is too stubborn to die!”
Dean pushed away the thoughts of Cas being in danger long enough to let the reality of the situation sink further into him. All that was on his mind was the exit. He would do anything to get Cas home safe.
Dean lost his bearings for a moment as Cas teleported them behind the Leviathans. “Run!” he shouted to Dean, and he obeyed.
Dean held the blade in front of his chest, pointing it at the Leviathan. “You already know my question. Answer it and I’ll think about letting you live.”
Anxiety flared in Cas. He was truly relieved that help was on the way, but his self-conscious nature returned. Cas hung his head low.
“Please,” Cas blinked, his own scent of dense trees and fresh clay acquiring a slight burn. “Just- Just come closer. Please.”
“I think they still work,” Dean said, “Lemme go request a song for you.” Dean slid out of the booth, smiling. Cas took a slip of his milkshake and watched Dean insert a quarter into the machine. He thumbed through the song options, selected one with a grin, and walked back to the table. Dean had the stupidest grin on his face. “Let’s kick it up a notch!” he professed, leaning back in the booth as the previous song finished out.
“It’s more sour than I expected… but not half bad.” He took a drink, downing the rest. Sam nearly spit out his drink while snorting and Dean’s eyes went wide.
“Why? He’s a Monster. He could come back for us,” Dean said, more confused than annoyed. “You said things will be tracking us. We should get rid of everything we see, right?”
“I remember you,” Cas said, referring to going through the portal. Dean didn’t react, so he assumed that Dean wasn’t aware of his Humanity’s affect on Cas. His heart broke a little. “I recall… falling. Hard. And then there was a woman’s voice… and then the shower… and I remember falling asleep.” Cas tried to move while speaking, but Dean made a loose gesture, telling him to take it easy. “I remember feeling very weak,” he continued, out of breath, and it was clear to Dean that he still was.
He couldn’t see, but he could hear. He heard the familiar echo of shouts in a place he had been before, maybe ten miles south of here. He heard the rustle of leaves under feet and the quickening pace of an enemy-- no, enemies-- not far behind. Once again, he felt Dean’s Humanity, filled with pleading, terrified desperation.
Dean shut the door behind them quickly, nudging Cas towards the bed to lie down. Cas whined in protest, then covered his mouth, surprised by the sound he made. Dean looked a bit stunned as well, but he was already in overdrive.
Dean figured that this shouldn’t be news to him. Cas had been at full power and became severely damaged when entering. What would happen when he was weak upon exiting. “How long do you need to get juiced up?”
“You’re okay! I was so worried last night…” Dean said, joyfully, but there was a hint of panicked sorrow in his voice. “We made it out.”
Dean laughed too. “Nah, I don’t do strip clubs anymore.” He smiled at Cas. “Twenty one plus. Same kind of money, but with more clothes.”
“No, no, it’s just a scratch, I’m fine,” Dean said, continuing to limp forward. “Come on, slow poke.”
“It’s late afternoon. We should travel overnight since we’ve been resting all day.” He held out a hand for Cas to take, which he accepted. “Have you ever travelled at night before?”
Perhaps the most concerning matter was his wings. The Monsters, Cas, and Dean were now all on the same plane of existence. This otherworldly place allowed everyone and everything to see his wings. Being sucked in to Purgatory damaged his wings so egregiously that he didn’t even want to be seen.
“No, no, Cas, it’s ok,” Dean hushed, standing to meet Cas as an equal. “So… do I get you toys, find another angel?
“Wow… You’re going to have to teach me more about all this when we’re done,” Dean joked as he lined up at Cas’ entrance. He pushed inside and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth bottoming out felt. Cas was just as slick as he said he was. “Is this… is this okay?” Dean said, holding back to make sure Cas was alright first.
“No, no, don’t worry about it. I can take care of it. Oh, here. Let me get you a key,” the young woman said quickly, disappearing behind the desk for a moment and returning with a room key. She didn’t take their name. Rookie mistake. “Room 213. Down the hall and hang a right.”
Cas had to make a conscious effort not to buckle at the knees when Dean kissed him. As soon as their lips touched, Cas felt that indescribable surge of Dean’s Humanity pulling at his body. He wanted to stay like this forever. He wanted Dean to touch him more than he already was, pulling at his hips to draw him in. So Cas leaned closer and threw his hands around Dean’s shoulders. Though they were similar in height and build, Cas felt so small against him. He didn’t hate the feeling. Cas wanted Dean to wrap him up and hold him until his Humanity made its way into his bloodstream. He just wanted Dean.
"You just had to do that, didn't you. You had to use her again, just like you always did. That's all she's good for. You say
"Oh you have a house now? Got a family in that house, too? Come on, Dean. How long as it been? Aren't you gonna let your dad in?"
Dean was frozen, rethinking the past 12 years of his life. He wasn't the only one his feelings sucked at staying hidden from, turns out. He didn't know if he should cry or laugh at that, so much had happened in the past few hours that he was out of reactions at that point. He did feel relief, though. He was so afraid of how Sam would react. Irrationally afraid, since he'd come out to Sam so many years ago, but that didn't stop him from fearing how Sam would feel about this. It wasn't just some guy, it was Cas. Irrational fear.
"So let me get this straight." Sam would be stifling a laugh if the air didn't feel so heavy. "You're barely hunting anymore......living like
Dean looks like he's making an effort not to say something. He looks angry. John decides this won't do and forces his way past Dean and into the house. The others move to stop John but Dean says from down the steps "it's okay, let him in if that's what he wants". Sam and Eileen go in with him while Dean takes his time going up the porch steps and Cas stays behind to talk to him. "Are you okay?", he whispers. Dean says yes but holds his arm a bit too tight and for a bit too long for that to be true. "What do you want me to do?", Cas asks, and he answers "Just...be here." Cas understands what that means and briefly brushes his hand over Dean's cheek before walking into the house. As he does, Dean glances into the house, trying to track John. When they get in he's already talking again.
"They are." Dean says. John keeps trying to walk into every room and Sam and Eileen keep blocking his way. This is Dean and Cas's home, they get to decide how much of it John sees, how much of their life together John gets to know about. If anything at all. Sam is bracing for a disaster.
The next group of species the professor mentions are the fish with near-detachable jaws. These are strange to humans because they're monstrous, breaking themselves apart to swallow creatures bigger than themselves whole. Monstrous for wanting too much and unhinging their very selves to get it, Castiel figures humans think, but no, they don't want too much, they simply have needs their environment does not meet. Small particles fall on them like snow in the darkness, but they can't possibly live on that. Swallowing fish whole is why they survive, it's no more violent than those dots devouring each other. And life does go on inside them, maybe not like in those dots but the fish these supposed monsters devour will later fall on other creatures like snow in the darkness that surrounds them, and the violence becomes life becomes violence again and again and the huge monstrous want of swallowing things alive was just the natural want to survive all along. One student two rows ahead of Castiel comments that these fish are ugly but thankfully there's no one around to see them anyways, and Castiel asks himself all those questions again. Is it the unhinged jaw that is ugly or is it the want? Is the want ugly because it's condemnable or because it's a mirror? Are his wants ugly too?
John almost smiles, holding on to some shred of belief that they're joking, but he knows they aren't. There's a defeated look in his eyes, the look of a big scary man that isn't scary anymore without his power and authority. A commander without soldiers is just a man demanding obedience from his equals, trying to be a self-made god by force, and a commander abandoned by his soldiers is a failed god. And a god without believers is just someone shouting orders at the air, writing gospels no one will read. John would have liked the gospels. They could have taught him something. It's not that he had so much power and didn't know how to wield it, it's that he never realized that all power is fake. God started dying when he was disobeyed but he just wouldn't quit. His precious conscious things didn't need him anymore but he wouldn't stop forcing them to need him. Not self-made, but overstaying his welcome by force. How can a god have nothing? If he has nothing, he is nothing.
"Ahhh, I see." He makes a whole show out of it, sarcastic to the point of being corrosive, grating on the part of Dean that still can't escape his upbringing no matter how much he tries. John stands there for a while, looking at the floor, contemplating the wood boards and laughing a sad little laugh. There's a long pause and Dean doesn't know what to do with himself. He's standing by the table, holding on to a chair, and Cas is doing his best to be there for him. Sam wants to come to Dean's defense but he knows it's not the time, so he just stands there holding hands with Eileen, tighter now. Finally, John moves. He looks up and says "well Mary, I tried. I did my best."
"Is that really how you see it? Was that what you thought was happening? Didn't you see me working my ass off to keep food on the table?"
"Well, sometimes. Once in a blue moon. Old habits die hard." He smiles at John just like he did earlier. Not kind at all either, but different.
This makes Castiel think of snakes. He had always admired snakes, but Lucifer was jealous of them. By the time Lucifer rebelled, snakes already existed. So did apple trees, and so many other species filling an entire garden of delights, an ironic name on God's part. Love of beauty and nature was always laced in irony, it came with the holiness. It felt right to Lucifer to appear as a snake, but he never forgave them because fact remains that by the time Lucifer rebelled, the mere existence of snakes had already beat him to it. The professor mentions that some things that don't make sense as adaptations can be the product of genetic drift, genes that tag along with others and stay there because they're not hindering anything. That one really made God angry, Castiel remembers that too. The more complex beings became, the more unpredictable God's little playground was until it wasn't his playground at all anymore, it had, well, a life of its own. The real first sin, maybe. Lucifer resented evolution too because it reminded him he wasn't the first one to do anything. He wanted to be a creator too but nature beat him to it. And to make matters worse, he'd gone through all that trouble out of hatred, and nature didn't have a motivation at all, it wasn't even doing it on purpose. I was simply existing. The devil himself had been outshadowed by nothing. Outloved and outhated. Oulived, in a way.
"I didn't. I don't. You shouldn't have come at all." Dean's voice is steady but Cas knows that's not quite how he's feeling. He wants to be closer to Dean but doesn't know if he should. He stays on the porch. Dean's tone changes a little bit, from assertive to inquisitive. "What else did they tell you?"
Cas walks towards Dean and puts his arms around his waist and his chin on Dean's shoulder, peeking at the pancakes. Dean very clearly leans into it and lets out a "hmmm" from deep inside him and smiles. At this point, Sam pauses. "Wait a second", he thinks, maybe out loud. He's not sure. He does a double take that neither Dean nor Cas notice. A triple take. Quadruple. They seem to be ignoring he's even there. He clears his throat.
"Really? Stuck in this twisted postcard of a life with whoever this guy is?" He's not even trying to mask his disgust.
Sam sits down, holds Eileen's hand tighter. Watching John hear this is something he wasn't even aware he needed. But he knows this goes beyond the part of their upbringing the two had in common. Dean needs this. Cas, on his end, tenses up, thinking at first that this isn't just about John, but then he realizes it is. After all, for Dean, Chuck was just the same thing again, but bigger. And in a way smaller, at the same time. Cas knows this and knows what it feels like, so has no intention of stopping Dean, just of being by his side. He gives John an intense stare. He has no patience for men like him, but this isn't his time to talk.
That dot had a long journey ahead, crossing paths with other dots, joining forces with them. When Castiel saw the first time one dot devoured the other he couldn't decide if it was gruesome or beautiful. This was the first time he felt doubt, but he would only realize that much later. After some time the strangest thing happened when one dot was devoured by another but continued living inside it, an act of apparent violence and destruction in fact bringing about creation of a new form of life. And this became so common that slightly bigger dots started appearing that were by themselves two different dots combined. Variety arose, the sea full of these minute wonders so many angels refused to see, and Castiel wondered what it was like to be alive with another being like those dots were. Like bees. Bees aren't soldiers, though humans sometimes call them that. Humans imagine them as monarchies with armies but they're not following orders. Castiel sees bees as sort of analogous to angels, the queen as the god of the hive, special for being the creator of all the others, but the other bees aren't taking orders from their god. They're telling each other where to find flowers, working together to build the hive, being good against all odds for something that can sting, complex against all expectations for something so small. They look like dots to most angels, too. As he relives those early memories, he wonders if he was coveting what those tiny dots had, if he was as jealous of the dots as the other angels were, albeit for different reasons. Could they be sinning if sins hadn't been created yet?
"Nothing you hadn't taught me already", Cas answers, and he kisses Dean before they start walking towards the Impala to go home.
. Shut up. I'm talking now." He's pacing around the room. "There's a lot of things I've wanted to tell you throughout my life and I think it's about time you hear them. Because you have no idea how thoroughly you fucked us up for life, do you? You have no idea how much hearing your voice inside our heads has messed with our lives. I'm not saying you had it easy, but fucking hell, a little self-awareness wouldn't hurt. And what happened was no excuse for what you did to us. Raising us like soldiers you were sending off to war, to a war that was
He decides to attend it for two reasons, a fascination with evolution and a separate but connected fascination with the way humans perceive it. He used to believe "the human perspective is limited", as he told God once, though he's not sure He was even listening, but he doesn't think that anymore. Angels always liked to think they saw the universe wider than humans, they'd watch from above as humans invented telescopes and imagined panes of stars beyond the sky and laugh in their certainty that humans would never be able to reach an angel's sight. It's simply not how God created them, they'd think. But the moment Castiel, angel among angels, touched Dean Winchester's soul, he was immediately blown away by the depths it reached, the intensity with which it felt, the breadth of the worlds contained within a simple human soul, bigger than anything he'd ever felt. Did God create that? Was it so they could see Him? Or did humans create it themselves?
Dean eagerly obliged and pounded into Cas exactly where he wanted, holding his hips still and tight as he did so. Cas’ bent over, hands flying to Dean’s shoulders, and his wings curled inwards involuntarily before crashing outward again, sending a gust of air through the room. Dean was thankful that he didn’t keep many objects around his bed; Cas’ wings were powerful enough to knock over anything in their path if they were so inclined.
They went home to the bunker in the Impala, Dean driving with one hand on the wheel and the other on Cas's thigh until Cas put his hand over Dean's and they locked fingers. They drove the whole way home like that, unable to be physically apart from each other for even one second. Twelve years was enough. When they arrived Cas and Eileen went to their rooms because Sam and Dean wanted to talk alone for a bit.
Sam gets to his and Eileen's room and sits down on the bed next to her, laughing while giving her the pancake.
Dean loves to cook. He likes cooking lunch for everyone, he likes baking cakes, and he may not be the best at it but he's been getting better. Now that they finally have time and the mental headspace for that sort of thing, he's been practicing, and he's finally figured out how to make the perfect pancakes, better than any other he's ever made. He loves making them for everyone (and Jack loves that he loves it, too). One morning, he decides to fight the urge to stay in bed with Cas and sleep in and instead gets up early to go to precisely that. It's quiet for a while, just Dean by himself enjoying the fact that he is finally able to relish these little moments, the simple things in life.
"Oh him again", Dean says as he throws a sideways glance at Cas, pretending to be mad but smirking about a second later. Sam has no idea what that is in reference to but he shakes it off and speaks again.
"I just wanted my sons to be good men." Sam scoffs, takes his hand to his face. What even is a good man according to the gospel of John Winchester?, they all find themselves thinking at the same time. A soldier blindly obeying orders out of some pure and abstract respect for duty in and of itself, never leaving his commander no matter how unjust or ruthless the whole war is? Who gets to be that commander? Who gets to decide what a good man is? Why should anyone get to decide that? God is dead and Dean killed him, but he and Cas disrespected him first, and it's hard to say which sin Chuck thought was worse. Or which one truly killed him, for that matter. Good men these are not, if we go by the gospels. John talks a big game about fighting the bad guys, after being told God was one of them, but he'd like the gospels, Cas thinks. The real ones, the ones behind the scenes. They had bad guys too. John repeats himself, almost sounding desperate to be understood. "I just wanted you to be good men."
At night, Dean and Cas go to their bed too. Dean brushes his hand across the knots in the wood as he's lying down. Cas opens his arms and Dean falls onto his chest and cries. and he cries and cries as Cas rubs his back and runs his fingers through his hair until he falls asleep. In the morning, Cas looks at him with so much love in his eyes and Dean looks at him and puts his hand on Cas's face.
Eileen walks in on that and wonders what's going on, but then she notices Cas's arm around Dean and just looks at Sam knowingly without speaking a word. She smiles so wide and her face says it all. She and Dean nod at each other. Then she and Cas do the same, but her look at Cas has just the tiniest hint of a threat wrapped in a lot of love. And everything is said.
They all walk towards the front door and open it in a rush to see up close if it's really him. It is. Suddenly the air feels heavier.
Dean worried aloud, still rapidly texting Cas. “God, he could be drunk and throwing up in the bathroom! I shouldn’t have ordered anything for him. I should’ve stayed with him. I know he can’t handle alco-”
Next is hydrothermal vents, gas that should be deadly but doesn't kill, fuming out of chimneys at the bottom of the ocean at temperatures that should by themselves be deadly too, and that aspect of "fatal in theory but booming with life in practice" is what makes these strange to humans. This makes Cas think about death, and the first time he ever witnessed it. The many first times he witnessed it, because death never stops feeling new to him. The death of the first cell wasn't the same as the death of the first cell that was a dot living inside another dot and neither of those were the same as the death of the first starfish or the first whale or the second whale or the hundredth. Each is different in its own way, like the universe stops breathing for a moment every time. The first time Castiel ever saw death he stood still for a moment, not knowing what to think (but being somewhat sure he wasn't supposed to think anything, or if he did, it was a thought brought upon him by his Father). God's hand lowered into the sea to pluck the life out of that individual dot, and thus He created the very first death. It was another moment where all angels suddenly felt that everything had changed, and sitting in this class, with all the knowledge of life he has now, he thinks it changed for the better. At first, a creation that consisted of destruction seems like a contradiction, but it's not destruction at all. Like the particles from the fish with unhingeable jaws, death for one being is never death for nature. Life becomes death and death becomes life, particles from one being are nurture for another and Castiel could spend millions of years following a single molecule, a single atom, go from algae to crab to fish to bigger fish to whale to necrophagous eel to crab again. Does that atom ever die? He doesn't think so. God can create anything but not even He can create the death of an atom. If he could, could that mean he could kill himself?, Castiel wonders. Is God made of atoms? Are atoms God?
"I had a lot of help." He glances behind him at the others standing on the porch, and then back at John. "And being good at something doesn't mean I have to keep doing it." His stare gets more intense for a brief moment. "Right, dad?"
the mom, and when I come home you're the wife because if no one's mediating then Sammy's gonna get hurt and you have to take care of Sammy. Don't forget you have to take care of Sammy no matter what it costs. And don't get sloppy on hunts, his mom has already died once." Dean swallows a whimper. The tears keep falling and the rage isn't quitting. Cas has seen these wounds in his soul but it's different to hear about them like this. John, for different reasons, has heard enough.
, that old motto you hate so much. You hate it because you couldn't quite make the cut, isn't it? You think you're worthy of anything? You pile of ungrateful, pathetic shit. I'll bet this guy doesn't even love you, whatever you two think that means. How could he?"
Cas could feel Dean’s longing pulling at his metaphysical heartstrings. Every word was a tug at his will. He needed Dean as much as Dean needed him, but he couldn’t let mere want interfere with his judgement. That would be foolish. He needed to keep Dean safe. He knew the Monsters told Dean that he was still out there. But he needed Dean to believe it. Cas needed Dean to really believe, to know for certain that he still cared.
“I’m glad they enjoyed the show.” Dean said, finally relaxing a little bit, coming down from his rock-induced high.
Dean’s room was plain, but Cas liked it that way. He used his room mostly for storing clothes and personal belongings, and his bed was just a small cot that they had never replaced after Cas went mortal. Dean’s room was functional, mechanical almost, but there was a certain comfort in the uniformity that Cas have never appreciated. Cas slept with Dean most nights, unless Dean was out on a hunt or he wanted to be alone. Dean’s bed was warmer, softer, and more permanent.
“Well, I’m in a great deal of pain… I arrived to Purgatory with my wings so severely damaged that my body couldn’t heal properly from the shock of being sent to a dimension I wasn’t supposed to exist in… I didn’t have enough time to completely heal before going through the exit, and it seems to have caused me more trauma than going through the first time.”
“Trust me, please,” Cas said, leaning over a bit, pressing his forehead to Dean’s. He was clammy, surely a sign of some further illness, but Dean kissed him anyway. Suddenly, a flash of Cas’ Grace lit up his body, just as it had in Purgatory. It was so purely
“Hey guys, Gabri- Oh, shit, I’m sorry!” Sam said, peeking through the door frame, trying not to stare. Cas froze, panicking so quickly that his wings returned to their original plane. Dean shot up with the force.
“It has a lock, I don’t want to jiggle it. Surprise attack?” Dean whispered back. Sam nodded and got out of the way. Dean backed up, raising his leg and kicking the door near the handle. The door swung open to reveal a very bloody, unconscious Cas and a black eyed demon. The waiter? He looked surprised at the entrance of the Winchesters, but swiftly raised his angel blade to Cas’ neck.
There was a sudden rustle behind him, quickly approaching. The startled Dean whipped his head around. A Leviathan lunged at him, teeth bared and arms swinging. Dean scrambled for his weapon and stumbled to the side, just out of reach.
“Bullshit, sweet cheeks.” The demon cackled. “I know that you know Thing One and Thing Two are out looking for you right now, and when they walk in here, I’m going to kill that son of a bitch Sam and then make Prince Charming watch you die.” Cas shivered.
The feathers that were left caught the dim sunlight in them. There was a faint glow to them that Dean couldn’t explain if he tried. The down and the skin beneath was softer than anything Dean had ever felt in his life. They were beautiful. Cas was beautiful.
Once she left, they all thumbed through the menus. Cas was excited. In all his years, he had never been to a casino. He was glad Dean chose to share this moment with him and Sam.
Dean lined up with Cas’ entrance and Cas pushed back immediately, forcing Dean to bottom out in one stroke. He was tight, but so hot and wet that they barely noticed. “Oh shit, Cas…”
“That oughta do it.” He panted, prying the blade from the shifter’s hand. He held it out to Cas, who took it without a word.
Dean was on the bed when he entered. There was a bowl of ramen on the bedside table and a set of clothes for Cas.
Cas stirred, adjusting to the light. Truthfully, he felt awful, but for now, he just mumbled sleepily. “What time is it?”
“Is your heat too high?” Sam asked from the table as he finished his bowl of cereal. Castiel nodded, scraping off his second attempt at pancakes to start a third. He turned the heat down to medium.
“Dean,” he breathed out, low and panicked. The other voices faded. “The exit. They’re guarding the exit.”
“Holy shit,” was the first thing Dean said when he felt the water hit his skin. He stayed pressed close to Cas, offering stability when Cas needed it. The water ran a deep, rusty color down the drain, saturated with nearly a year’s worth of filth. Dean scrubbed both of them down until the water ran clear again and the scent of Purgatory was replaced with sweet, orange scented shampoo.
For a moment, he stared at them. He noticed the matted feathers. He looked at how Cas bent them onto his back to make them smaller. He remembered Cas telling him how sensitive they were.
For the first time, Dean hesitated to call Sam. The fact that he had just come back from the dead and he didn’t want to tell his brother was shocking even to him. Listening to the dial tone drone in his ear, he gazed at Cas, still fast asleep, and hung up the phone. For tonight, he just wanted to sleep and make sure Cas was alright.
Cas smiled, gazing up at Dean the same way Dean looked at him. Cas could feel both of their heartbeats speed up and then even out to the same slow pace as they basked in each other’s presence.
For the moment, staring at the sleeping Cas wasn’t helping anyone, so Dean decided it was time to rest. He was going to savor his first sleep back topside. He rolled onto his back to stare at the blank motel ceiling and let his hand drift near to Cas, just to let him know he was there if he needed. He heard the soft rustling of bedsheets and felt Cas’ hand connect with his as he drifted off.
About five miles from the bunker, Cas stirred. Dean had been paying attention to the road signs to see how much longer they had to drive, so he snapped his attention back to Cas. He groaned, then inhaled through his teeth when he felt the pain return.
Dean hadn’t noticed in their rush, and if he did, he didn’t mention it. Even the Monsters didn’t mention them. They were more than a vainly viewed blemish; they were a mark on his very existence. He was so repulsive that even the Monsters didn’t want to acknowledge how damaged he was. Before they attacked, they looked at the broken angel with pity, and Cas spat back at their condolences with a swift death. That would end their “sympathetic” glances.
With certain hearts and careless minds, Dean and Cas travelled onward, walking with more purpose than they had in the past. Cas imagined he was walking towards his new life. Perhaps Purgatory was his penance. He had made so many mistakes. He had wronged his family in so many ways. He was grateful for this fresh start.
Reaching in the trunk for the first aid kit, Sam didn’t say a word. Dean looked like he was about ready to snap. He could smell the worry and blame seeping out of Dean. Sam opened the back door of the car for him and Cas and got in the driver’s seat. He helped Dean lay Cas on the backseat. Dean climbed in the back and laid Cas’ head on his legs.
He tried to say Dean’s name, but it came out raspy and quiet. Cas managed to slide his arms back to push himself upwards, groaning in pain as he did so. Dean looked up at the noise and saw Cas behind him in the mirror.
Dean put on his most professional persona and marched back into the restaurant area. Sam followed suit. Dean grabbed a couple empty glasses from a recently abandoned table and started power walking to the kitchen.
“Let me put it on you,” Cas said, reaching for the bracelet. He slid it around Dean’s wrist and pulled the strings to tighten it. Dean twisted his wrist into a few different angles and made a goofy face at Cas.
Cas’ thrusts grew languid and tired the longer he went, physically exhausted from the need. His fifth orgasm racked his body and he buckled forward helplessly.
“Absolutely.” Dean answered firmly. Nevertheless, Sam grabbed an empty bread basket and followed Dean through the kitchen’s swinging doors. They entered, not making eye contact with a single soul. Stepping swiftly to the back of the kitchen, they abandoned their items and walked through a door marked “VIP” at the back.
Cas’ eyes screwed shut as he took Dean’s cock, finally feeling full and nearly satisfied. But the unfamiliar buzz in his body was still growing, and it showed no signs of stopping. The anxiety crept back into the forefront of his mind. Another wave in his scent gave him away, and Dean worked diligently to keep Cas satiated in any way he could pick up on.
Cas tried to get his head straight, but he could barely answer. “The exit…” he muttered, gesturing vaguely. It flickered more intensely than it had before. “We have to go now.”
Once Sam saw Castiel struggling to flip the pancakes, he got up to help. Grabbing another spatula from the drawer, Sam gently guided Cas away from the stove to aid him in his endeavor. He flipped a pancake over with practiced ease. Castiel furrowed his brow, annoyed, as Sam backed away to give Cas free reign over the kitchen appliance once again.
“Sure thing.” Another pause. “He’s lucky to have you.” Dean didn’t answer. He wouldn’t call it luck. The moment Cas touched him he was in danger; the least Dean could do was care for him.
He blinked the water droplets out of his eyes and looked up at the moon. Every time he looked at the moon, he thought of Cas. He remembered Cas telling him how much he loved the moon, how it was a perfect creation of God.
The Leviathans got out of the water faster than Dean expected, and they saw his plan of evasion. They followed on foot, running faster than Dean could. One of them would catch up eventually. Dean thought of hiding, but he didn’t want to risk being trapped. He thought about going up, but none of the trees around him looked scalable. Dean tried to think as quickly as he could while running through the trees. Twigs snapped under his heavy feet as he began to struggle for breath.
Cas couldn’t even form a response before the telltale signs of an orgasm started floating through him- but this time, he felt them everywhere. The prickle at the base of his spine shot up through every vertebrae, and the arousal usually reserved for his most sensitive areas was racing across every inch of skin he owned. He managed to let
Around what would’ve been an earthly noon, Dean came across a lake. He stared across it and watched the sun flicker across the nearly still water. He glanced over his shoulder to assure he wasn’t being watched or followed, and he knelt beside the lake.
That room became their room, and that bed became their bed, and Dean felt his heart full to the brim whenever he said "our bed" or "our room". After a while, they decided the bunker wasn't for them anymore. They couldn't leave the hunting life completely, but Dean wanted fresh air, a life out in the open. And it felt wrong to keep an angel underground now that they didn't have to hide from anything anymore. Bunkers are from hiding. So Cas decided to build them a house, for just the two of them. They decided it would be near the woods, where Cas could keep bees and Dean could fix cars. Their hands weren't for killing anymore, they were for making, making honey and making their own happiness and making love and making furniture. Dean's were already calloused, Cas's would get there. You don't get calloused hands from holding knives and writing gospels. He wanted calloused hands. So he got to building, and the first thing he built was their new bed. Cas made a point of choosing the ugliest piece of wood and smoothing it until its knots looked like constellations. In his mind they were, eons ago.
John scoffs in disbelief. "I was out there every single day working for you. And I did what I could for you, I tried to do right by you. I did my best. When Mar-" Dean gives him a look like he's about to punch him. He corrects himself, still sounding angry. "I didn't know what to do either. I was afraid of what was out there, afraid of what could happen to you and Sam too. So I tried to raise you the best I could. And this is how you treat me now? You end up like
"I'm bisexual, dad. Always have been." Another one that's out there now. More weight piling on. He's gotten used to saying this out loud by now, but this time the word struggles to get out.
Another fascinating thing about death is that it is the engine that powers everything in life. The worst thing about death is that anything that's living can die. Seeing that tiny dot die made Castiel wonder if he could die too, and he had felt fear before but this was different. With a single move of His hand, God had also created the fear of death. Is the fact that angels can die proof that they're alive? Does that mean they only become alive when death was created? Does the fear of death make them alive? It was certainly death that made the world alive, kickstarting natural selection and the evolutionary processes that God resented so much. Maybe He resented himself for creating them, but death was unavoidable, even for Him who was all-powerful. Castiel wishes he'd been there to see the face of God as he created death. Was he sad? Was he proud? Would that pride be a sin? Did he regret it? There will never be an answer for these questions, He was alone. Was He alone on purpose? Castiel doesn't know. He thinks of all the living things that have died by his own hand, so many of them human beings, people, and looks around the room. He looks at the professor's presentation, all those species that are only alive because of the countless deaths that powered the evolutionary history that put them together piece by piece, and is still tweaking and reassembling them at every moment of creation where another beautiful creature is born, creation not by God's hand but by dot meets dot and in turn makes more dots until they become alive. Death is what makes life in evolution, and Castiel now knows it's the same in humans. That fear of death he felt millions of years ago is what powers humans through their lives. Even in His most precious project made to be puppeteered down the most minute detail, death still digs its claws and makes things bigger than God. Maybe death is His most rebellious creation, and how fitting that it outlived Him.
“Cas, if you want to borrow my clothes you can just ask,” Dean chuckled. Cas didn’t laugh. “... Did I do something wrong?”
Cas’ throat was releasing quiet whines from behind his closed mouth as Dean’s hand worked him deliberately. He was overstimulated again, but there was little he could do but learn to marvel at the new sensation. His hand reached for Dean’s- a silent plea for comfort in this terribly human madness- and their fingers interlocked as Cas hurtled towards the edge.
When the pie came out, Dean barely even savored it. He finished it faster than both Cas and Sam. Cas decided cherry pie would be the next thing he learned how to make.
“Fuckin’ shifters. They’re stupid when they don’t go walking around in someone else’s skin,” Dean said, wiping the dirt from his forehead. He took a step and winced slightly at the pain.
“You alright, baby?” Dean asked. He didn’t chastize or ask any other questions, and Cas once again felt a sense of safety return to him. Cas tried to nod and level his breathing. “Did I hurt you?”
“Nothing even wants to look at me. Even the Monsters think that I’m unseemly…” Cas shuddered and tried to meet Dean’s eyes. It was natural, but uncomfortable. “I… I can’t heal them. Something’s wrong with me. I believe it’s… it’s my Grace. It’s being taken away.”
“I’m doing fine. My Grace seems to be recharging, but I still need a little more time,” Cas answered, eyes forward, scanning the forest. “If I can be of use, please let me know.” Dean only nodded in response.
“I forgive you,” Dean said, taking Cas’ other hand in his. “I understand why you did. Let’s just focus on moving forward, okay?” Dean started to lean his head in.
Dean pulled the last stitch tight and cut the dental floss. “All done.” He smiled at Cas, who still had his eyes closed. Dean hated seeing him like this. “Would a shower make you feel better, angel?”
“Please, I-I can’t, please… more...” he nearly sobbed out, gripping Dean’s shoulders with his last shred of fervor.
Cas screamed in pain, trying so damn hard to focus on an answer. “I-I don’t know what to tell you! Crow...Crowley died three years ago!” Cas spoke quickly, not wanting to get hit or punched or sliced again. To his surprise, the demon backed away. Cas, breathless, reluctantly asked, “What do you want with Crowley?”
He was nearly immobile at this point, so he gave in. He gave up the mistrust in his foreign human body and inexplicable biological functions, all the mistrust he had left in Dean’s judgement- and it felt amazing.
“Jesus, Sammy, don’t you know how to fucking knock?” Dean said, monotone enough for his words not to be wildly offensive. “What is it?”
“I asked you a question, featherweight,” the demon snarled. Cas could only whimper weakly, still unable to find his bearings.
Dean furrowed his brow and stood up. “Tell me what’s wrong. Please,” Dean commanded more than asked.
Dean walked up to the hostess. “Do you have a reservation, sir?” She said, as equally business-like as the waitress.
“S’gonna be too much, please, alpha!” Cas cried, begging for any type of solace Dean could offer him.
Though Dean could barely stand himself, he offered a hand to Cas, who graciously took it. His knees shook as he stood. Dean hooked his other arm under Cas’.
“Umm, uh, where do we keep the books on angels?” Dean asked, suddenly studious. Sam pointed roughly to a shelf near the back wall. “Uh, thanks Sammy.”
“We won’t be wandering. I have a good idea of where the exit is based on what a few different Monsters told me. We can go through it since we don’t... belong here. I was going to find you and then head back topside.”
When Dean left the room, Cas stared at his chest in the mirror. The stitched-up cut was long and ugly. It wasn’t a clean stroke; it was jagged and deep. It was probably going to hurt for a long time, and scar for even longer. Cas felt an extremely human sense of shame.
“Hey, look, there,” Dean said, gesturing towards a Motel 8 sign in the distance. “Can’t be more than a few blocks.” Cas didn’t respond. Dean decided it was best to keep moving. He pushed his concerns to the back of his mind.
“Cas, follow me!” Dean yelled, and Cas whipped around to look at him. The four Leviathans were dead, and that left eight behind them. “We’ve got the high ground now, let’s go!”
Cas was, frankly, frustrated that Dean didn’t feel his Grace. Their love was the same, but Dean’s perception was ever so slightly different. Dean’s love had a sacrificial, protective nature to it that Cas could feel at every hour of the day. Cas’ love was more open, ready to please and serve when needed. Nevertheless, Cas wasn’t stupid. He loved Dean, and he had time and time again given him everything he had. Cas wasn’t helpless. He could figure out how to get through to Dean.
“Sammy, can you get me some whiskey?” Sam nodded, hurrying towards the kitchen. “And I need some dental floss and a needle!” Dean shouted after Sam as he led Cas to the bathroom.
“Baby, please! Stop it, Cas!” Dean commanded with a final push away from Cas. Their lips disconnected and his head spun as the pain rapidly faded from his body. Cas, eyes wide with shock, fell back against the headboard as the agony returned to his body.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean encouraged. “Almost there, sweet angel.” Cas squeezed his hand agonizingly tight as he hung on.
“I’m not gonna lie… this is probably going to hurt a lot.” Dean poised the needle over Cas’ chest. “I’ll try to go as quick as I can.” Cas nodded vigorously, not wanting to think about it. Dean pierced his skin with the needle and Cas shivered. Dean worked as fast as he could. He got about a third of the way through his task when he felt tears start to drip onto his hands.
Cas let out a low whine and took it upon himself to straddle Dean as quickly as he could. His wings helped hoist him up to knock Dean onto his back. “I’ll do it myself then,” Cas said, offering a smirk with the same caliber as Dean’s.
“Damn, you really are stupid. Let me make things simpler for you.” The demon let go of Cas’ hair and held the angel blade he stole earlier to Cas’ arm. “Where is Crowley?”
“Ah, you’re finally awake.” Cas tilted his head up, dizzy. Cas tried to get a hold on his surroundings, but his head was spinning. He heard the demon say something, but it didn’t register. He seemed to be in a nicely furnished private room. It had nice chairs and mahogany tables, and the curtains were similar to the ones in the lobby.
“For Dean Watson.” He said with a smile. Castiel Watson, Cas thought, had a nice ring to it. The hostess guided them to a table. She sat them down and handed them menus.
Cas could hear Dean’s labored breathing on the other end, and he knew something would have to be really wrong for Dean Winchester to ask him for assistance.
Cas had heard many describe an orgasm like the waves of an ocean, beautiful and mysterious- able to be felt in a way different from sensation and separate from touch- but it was in this moment he finally understood the description. In this moment, he was on the crest of the highest tsunami crashing into and over itself, and it was the most fantastic thing he’d ever felt, and for a moment, he believed he would ever feel.
Dean opened the door slowly to see Cas seated cross-legged on the bed, naked, with his storm-cloud grey wings drawn up against his back. Cas was rocking back and forth slowly, probably attempting to calm his nerves. He shut the door and took off his shirt as he walked towards the bed. He had only seen Cas’ wings twice before, and it felt like seeing him with fresh eyes each time. “Christ, you’re beautiful, Cas…”
More Leviathans emerged from the tree line, gathering around their injured comrade. They seethed with anger and bloodlust, and it looked to Dean like a great time to get out of there. He could take about four Leviathans on his own (after some practice and a couple close calls), but they just kept coming out of the trees until there were around ten.
He was growing tighter by the minute, and Dean wasn’t sure how much longer either of them were going to last. Up until this point, Dean had been afraid to touch Cas’ wings. He knew they were sensitive, and he didn’t want to risk overstimulating Cas. However, Cas looked so beautiful chanting his name like a prayer, his eyes opening and closing as he rode his own waves of pleasure, that he couldn’t resist anymore. So, in a moment of boldness, Dean ran a hand over the upper coverts of Cas’ right wing.
The bathroom was quiet, and Cas was slowly becoming more acquainted with it. Strangely, it was one of his new favorite places. The unspoken rule of solitude was comforting to him, and baths became a new and welcomed pleasure. Sam and Dean knew that Cas needed his time to relax and ease into his new life as a human, so it was not unusual for Cas to go undisturbed for a couple hours in the bathroom here and there.
After dinner, Dean hit up the blackjack table with Cas while Sam chatted up a woman with heels that were certainly higher than comfortable. Cas watched Dean play his first game intently, trying to figure out the strategy. After a few minutes of ‘hit’ and ‘stand’ and ‘split’, Dean added a hundred more dollars to his pocket.
“I guess you’re right,” Dean agreed, standing up. He reached out a hand to Cas and pulled him up. He looked a little out of it, but Dean was sure he was just tired. “Are you sure you don’t want to rest?”
“-Cas, don’t. Get up. You’re gonna get sick if you stay in this cold water any longer,” Dean ordered, an unusual worry on the edge of his words. He pulled a towel from the basket next to him and opened it for Cas.
He made quick work of all the feathers he could reach, and by the time he was done, Cas was a bit shaken, exhausted from the torment. There were still feathers that he couldn’t get to but needed to remove.
“Hear what?” Dean said. Cas gestured in front of them, and Dean listened harder. “I don’t hear anything.”
It surprised Cas the first time. He had never cried before; his celestial powers could block it out. First came the breath, heavy in his chest, punched out of his lungs. Second came the initial sob; it shook his frame with the force of all his love’s loneliness. Third came the tears, tracking down his face, first in thin lines, then in thick beads that gathered on his lashes until they became too heavy and fell.
Cas inhaled. “Can you take a look at them again? Just to see if there’s anything… disgusting about them?”
Cas’ eyes flew open in shock, and Dean almost pulled away until he saw the look of adoration and trust in his eyes. Cas let out a loud, hoarse moan as his wings flexed in response. He was then suddenly reduced to silent gasps and tight-lipped whimpers as Dean slowed his thrusts to focus more on his wings. Dean held his attention there as his fingers combed over the shape of Cas’ wings, sliding them down to brush the tips of his inner feathers.
“What?” Cas said. He started towards the end of the bed, sitting down next to Dean. He handed Cas the bowl of ramen.
Dean smiled at the waitress. “It must be my birthday or something!” he said. Cas smiled too, remembering their lunch outing.
“Ah, ah… yes.” Cas breathed out shakily. Dean held his hips, willing him to stay upright. He was happy to give Cas whatever he needed, but for now he was content with watching his angel have his fun.
It had been minutes at most, but Cas felt the feeling would never end. Tears streamed from his eyes as his moans mixed with sobs. “Dean, please!” he shouted through the storm brewing around him, hoping his vague plea was enough for Dean to understand.
Cas scrunched his face up in thought. “It feels like you. I don’t know how else to explain it… it’s just everything that makes you… you… It’s like your soul, almost, but a bit different. On Earth, I can see your soul as much as anyone else’s, but here? I can’t see it. I can only feel you.”
Cas threw his head back and groaned through his teeth, trying in vain to control the sensitivity. His chest heaved with shuddering breaths. A mix of human and Enochian curse words fell from his lips, each one feeling as foreign as the hum of arousal in his body. It travelled up his body, far enough to cloud his mind, and down far enough to make him dig his heels into the mattress for support. From somewhere far away, Dean’s words of comfort were piercing through the fog, but his scent, and the desperation on the edge of it, was driving Cas mad.
“Unhand me.” Cas commanded, clenching his teeth, trying to wriggle free. He was stronger than Cas expected for his size. He was as tall as Cas, but seemingly less muscular.
“Bad news?” Cas mumbled. Dean tossed him underwear, a worn Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and a pair of checkered pajama bottoms. There was an angel on the shirt, flying, sprawled out with thick, white-feathered wings. Cas swallowed his childish jealousy.
After breakfast Dean goes to his workshop to work on two almost ruined cars some hunters asked him to fix. Sam and Eileen show up a bit later, as they do once in a while. They say they like the atmosphere there. Cas sees them from afar and signs good morning.
Cas appears and leans against the threshold of the kitchen door, watching Dean with love in his eyes. Sam is used to this, but he does notice Cas seems more...open about it. He thinks nothing much of it. Cas says "hey" and Sam opens his mouth to say "good morning" but something about the way he says it makes Sam believe it wasn't meant for him. Dean says "Morning, sunshine". Business as usual.
Dean is making pancakes. Sam is sitting at the table, eating them. It's early and Cas is still in bed.
Dean makes a fist and holds it in the air beside him like he's about to hit the wall, but then he opens his hand and lays it on one of the beams. This is here. This is real. He and Cas are real. Raise high the roof beam, carpenters, and all that jazz. Happy moments. A house made of trees, trees watched with love, a house made by hands made for killing but changed into hands for making. A
"Yeah." Dean let out a laugh of disbelief. "Yeah, man." A beat of silence. Dean glanced at Sam and then looked at the ground, at the wall, anywhere but Sam, anything but looking him in the eyes. He cleared his throat. "What do you...uhm...what do you think about that?"
Dean braced himself and then moved first to kiss Cas, very gently, his hands slowly rising until they were around Cas's face. He felt himself being kissed back and it was so soft he could hardly bear it. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and Dean felt his eyes well up, action and reaction, the final straw for him to unravel and fully process what was happening. He started laughing and crying at the same time, tears of happiness, tears of well deserved and long awaited joy. Cas touched Dean's forehead with his and they stood like this for a while. Cas brushed his hand across Dean's face to wipe off his tears and kissed him again. They looked each other in the eyes in that telepathy way of theirs and kissed again. And again and again, each time more intense, both letting their hunger for each other roam free. They lowered themselves onto the bed. Dean had pictured this so many times but almost always cut himself off before getting to this part, forcing himself not to want it, but he didn't have to deny it anymore. And it was better than anything he could have imagined.
Cas looks at Dean. He looks back at Cas and nods. Cas looks at Sam and Sam looks at Dean and then nods too. Cas puts his hand on John's face. A flash of light, and just like that he's gone. Anticlimactic. Not that big of a death, over in two seconds. He was already dying before Cas even touched him. Dean lets himself fall onto a chair and Cas puts his arms around him, kissing his head. Dean grabs his arms and says nothing for a moment. It's over, just like that. They sit there in silence for a while. What do you say after something like that happens?
"Nah. Same as always. Something something sword of Michael, something something everybody dead, gunshots from the Colt, me back in Hell, we've gone through it. i know what it is. I just don't know how to make it stop." He sits up, wraps his arms around his knees and puts his head in his hands. Cas rubs his back and kisses his shoulder because there's nothing to say, really. Nothing he can't say like that. They get up and go make breakfast. Dean loves Cas's bees, he does. Maybe not as much as he does, Cas sees something when he looks at those bees that Dean knows his mind can't reach no matter how well he understands the general idea behind it, but he's always surprised at how Cas never tires of their honey. It's endearing.
"....Okay." Dean answers, not thinking of anything else to say. "Should we split up? Me with the EMF reader and you with the...angel spidey senses?" Dean knows Cas doesn't understand that, but he still nods so Dean continues. "Alright, I go that way, you go this way, let me know if you see anything, and we'll meet back here in an hour. Sounds good?"
personal revenge fantasy. I was six years old when I first saw you kill a monster. Twelve when I first saw you kill a man. I was over thirty when I found out how many monsters were also men, some of them not that bad. You wanna talk about that? You raised us to shoot to kill and not even give anyone or anything a shadow of a doubt. You didn't want sons, you wanted guns that shot wherever you pointed them. Carnage on the way to how you wanted the story to end and who cares if you fuck up a couple of kids along the way. We were children! You don't get to write the story, nobody does! Tragedy happened, yes. You were grieving, yes. But what kind of psycho does that to his kids?"
