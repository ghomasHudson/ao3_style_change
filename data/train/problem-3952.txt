“Aww, come on, Samsquatch! I thought you missed Crowley and I figured you’d like a reminder!”
“Adding Abilify,” Cas blurts out, because that’s what the commercials on tv say. The nurse is not impressed with his answer but all the other patients snicker.
“Careful!” Castiel yelps as he feels her falling off his shoulders.
“Cas - you can’t just do that to the guy you’re riding! That must’ve hurt, what the hell!”
“He’s a danger to himself and everyone around him. We need to do something before he hurts anyone else.”
The morning of the seventy second day, Cas is barely able to swallow enough to drink a carton of orange juice… there’s no possible way he can consume breakfast. He goes back to his room after and lies down in Dean’s bed, curling in on himself with his eyes closed. There’s no way to know if Dean is alright, because the nurses won’t tell him. So Cas stays in bed, under blankets that smell like Dean. He dozes at points, not quite a full sleep, and doesn’t leave for group or for lunch. Salvation eventually comes, however, in the form of Sam Winchester arriving during visiting hours. And for this, Cas gets out of bed.
But eventually, somehow, Dean manages to drift off. And he dreams.
Regardless of the answer to that question, Dean gradually shifts onto his side and shuffles closer like Cas was thinking of doing earlier. There’s no longer any doubt that some kind of line is being crossed, here. Cas knows enough to understand that people don’t lie in bed and stare at each other this way unless at least one of them intends something to come of it.
“I’m on a locked ward of an inpatient psychiatric facility. I doubt he’d be able to reach me here.”
“Hey, bro. What happened to your first vessel?” Gabriel asks as if this is the time for such questions.
“It’s essentially a promise for more later. Courting takes a long time by your standards, usually angels use that time to decide logically and thoroughly that they desire this particular mate. If the pair are often separated because they perform different tasks for Heaven, or if they’re soldiers from different garrisons, then multiple short meetings are necessary and feathers are gifted back and forth each time. Eventually both angels will have amassed a small stash of each other’s feathers. When they’re finally able to build their nest, these feathers are then mixed into one large pile and used as part of the building material.”
“Yeah, maybe. We’ll burn that bridge when we cross it I guess.”
Allegedly, anyway. His legs almost refuse to move, to stand him up from the floor. His ears still bleed and his muscles shake. It’s concerning, if he’s this weak he may fall down again while walking. But there’s no choice. He notes that several hours have passed and wonders if Sam and Dean are out searching.
“I know you’re-y’know what, stop calling me Sammy, Dean!”
“Why aren’t you sleeping, Dean?” he whispers.
he’ll be mad that you lied to him about it-”
“Well that’s a given,” Dean points out. “And I bet you’re stealing Baby for this, too.”
It’s a really stupid story, a story he’s actually only ever told Charlie about because he knows she won’t judge him for it - twelve years ago when he was a young rookie Islander, he somehow managed to get sent to the ASG (which… that by itself is just fucking insane, even taking into account him not actually being the first choice to go) and since it was over in Edmonton he didn’t feel bad or nervous about poking through Grindr, especially since he was away from Dad.
“Dude, c’mere.” Dean grabs Cas by the arm and they both go into his room. “You can borrow one’a mine for tonight, tomorrow when we get to Miami we’re gonna go get you some new ones. You can’t just wear the same tie every night for the whole season.”
“Well Cas is - so we’re - y’know, solidarity and all that shit,” he says, not exactly outing his teammate but knowing Benny will catch on.
“No. My grace seems to be borrowing from his soul in order to bring itself back to full strength and heal my wings. Incidentally, I approve of your choices in movies, I’ve heard those are reasonably age-appropriate for you and generally wholesome.”
It’s unproductive, however. Castiel turns his eyes back to the stack of books in front of him. He’s searching for more effective ways to trap archangels, considering Lucifer can force holy fire to burn itself out much faster than it normally would. So far his research has been mostly a way to eat time between Dean’s waking hours, because he’s found exactly nothing helpful.
fuckin’ wings, okay.”
This happens eight times in succession until Dean’s father eventually stops calling. Cas wonders if he’s actually given up or if he’s only waiting several minutes in hopes that someone else will answer. So Cas sits by the phone and draws bees using a clipboard to hold the paper. He puts as many as will fit on the page and then starts over with a fresh sheet. And the phone rings again.
“Ain’t that your tie, brother? You dressin’ everybody else now?” Benny teases.
“He could hotwire somethin’.” Bobby jerks his head sideways and mouths
“No, champ, that’s the point. It’s
“I’m a supportive teammate.”
“Hey, I’m gonna go grab some food. Will you be okay for a few minutes?” Sam asks.
“Awesome,” he grumbles. “Okay, now what?”
“Mm.”
“Oh, this is - I don’t believe this,” is Dean’s response. It feels natural because Dean has always had such a mentality, that hard facts must back things up, but Castiel can see tiny threads of doubt in his friend’s face. It’s interesting to contemplate.
“Did you mother never teach you to dress yourself, Feathers?”
“Will there be space for all of us or should I book hotel rooms nearby?”
“Because he just came back from the dead and deserves a fucking nap.”
“Chaotic and rebellious? Unrepentant rule-breakers?” Naomi’s obviously horrified by this idea. “Look where he’s gotten us! And there’s only
“Here comes the airplane,” Dean snickers.
“Dude,
It’s not a bad theory, but somehow Dean knows it’s wrong. Also he still ain’t sure that
“Maybe uh, inattentive,” Dean grins, because yeah, he does read. It seems like a good word. “Y’know. Less ‘dumb.’ Less ‘ass.’”
Dean doesn’t wanna think about any of this mess anymore. He swigs down whiskey like it’s beer until he’s hit almost a bottle and a half’s worth of alcohol, by which point it’s been way too long and he figures he should find out what the hell those two are doing. That actually turns out to not be a fantastic idea, because he’s drunk enough to be off-balance and suddenly a stack of books jumps out on the floor right in front of where his foot’s trying to go.
“You never told me that.”
Enter Raphael. “Hello, Gabriel. Castiel. Look at the mess you’re making.”
It’s just them in the panic room, mostly for privacy. Now-Cas fixed the door and is currently being kept on lockdown by Gabe in the living room, so Dean and Future-Cas are just hanging out, waiting for him to recover from basically exploding in Hell while getting Gabe free.
“Apologies.”
Castiel hates himself for saying that even more than he hates the fact that it’s technically true. He hasn’t been given orders in a very long time, but back when he was receiving him, that was almost always the case. But Dean deserves tenderness and attentive care from a friend, not cruelly delivered arguments and directives.
“Yeah but that still sounds easier than abducting a baby from a hospital,” Dean shrugs.
“Uh-huh. Imagine that. You doing somethin’ stupid and getting your fool ass blown up for your efforts ain’t his idea of a good day. And guess what, when he has to deal with you, me’n Sam gotta deal with
“You wouldn’t have been able to see anything,” Castiel says. “I fell into the veil. And in all honesty it may have been horrifying for you, I was in excruciating pain and there wouldn’t have been anything you could’ve done to help. I wanted you there, incidentally. But it would’ve been impossible.”
“Dean, I don’t think I’ll be able to-”
“Yeah, yeah, okay, I get that.” He’s seen
Sam looks away and doesn’t say anything. Dean realizes he doesn’t actually buy what just came outta his own mouth, because something about all of this is screwy, and he feels like he’s being watched even though there’s nobody here but them. He gets his mind back on track. Focus. Logic. Show Sammy that this ain’t some angel.
Staring at the screen of his phone, Cas considers what steps he can take and calls Dean.
You have no say in whether he lives or dies and you have no choice but to accept this fact.”
“Yes, you’ve mentioned those. Or you will. Dean, I’m from 2013. I was fleeing from other angels who are angry with me for resisting their brainwashing techniques and to avoid them I flew into time. During the course of my travels it occurred to me to undo the worst mistake I’ve ever made, the details of which I’ll get into once I’m sure you believe what I’m telling you.”
“Yeah, I got the email from management.”
“Thanks,” Sam grumbles, and finally leaves them alone.
and for a second thing he got traded to them last season from the New Jersey Devils, so it just makes sense. At first it was supposed to be kinda mean-spirited but of course the fucker actually enjoyed it and it stuck. (Although, Dean can’t really blame him - whose mother names them Fergus anyway? That’s just cruel.)
“No, it’s fine,” Dean insists, cutting him off. “Here.” The spoon is held out.
“At least say you feel fucking guilty!”
“Don’t lump me in with your flawed view of things,” Castiel says. “Positive physical contact and visual attractiveness are only side benefits. There are many more important aspects of Dean that I value over either of those things.”
Dean doesn’t, and thankfully doesn’t seem to have heard him thinking that. “I’mma go home now so you can get settled in and shit, but if you need something you can call. I’ll come running.”
“Yes.” And his legs go out from under him.
“Don’t encourage him,” Castiel snaps before viciously tugging a feather up that was previously ingrown.
“Yes, the shirts are a pleasant surprise and I definitely appreciate the gesture.”
“I’m going to demote her,” he mutters to himself between bites. He’s not sure if he means it yet or not, but if she keeps picking fights with Castiel it’ll make up his mind in a hurry. “Someone else could take her spot…”
“No, Cas. No we’re not. Because after I eat, I’m taking a god damn shower, and then I need a nap. You can wander around and do whatever the hell it is you do while I’m out.”
“GABRIEL! I WILL DEEP-FRY YOU IN HOLY OIL!”
had stood up for him the same way.
“Yes, actually,” he decides. “I’ve been part of this team for approximately one week and I have yet to hear you say a
“Yeah. Dean, you - I’m sorry.”
So my thought process with the addition of Michael and him not being as much of a dick as Raphael was that in the show, out of all the archangels, he's the only one besides Gabriel who seems like he can actually be reasoned with to some degree. We see it a little bit in s5 when he possesses John and has a very calm and rational discussion with Dean, and then later in s15 when he allows himself to be convinced to help them get into Purgatory and especially by his essentially symbiotic relationship to Adam where he cohabitates rather than full-on possesses.
“It’s good for you.”
Dean’s killed greater demons and wiped out vampire nests and won a faceoff with
“God no, that’s the last thing I need is you two ganging up on me…”
“Somebody there?” Dean turns his head in several directions. “Hello?”
“Try to hold still,” Sam scolds.
from me!”
“I see.” Cas knows this topic is important, but his mind disobeys and he needs further reassurance. “Are you sure Dean will be alright?”
“Right. So uh… do you really think it’s more likely that you’re seeing things nobody else sees because you’re just that special, or because it’s just your eyes and your brain playing tricks?”
“Why?”
“Yes, apparently I’m not an angel and there aren’t demons everywhere like I was led to believe by my own mind.”
blocks a shot with his chest and the puck skitters away to the left corner, which has Castiel charging after it. He ends up crushed into the glass under two opponents, all three of them scraping with their sticks and the blades of their skates to try and free the frozen rubber disk from where it’s trapped - ultimately,
(There’s also a secret fourth criterion, which Castiel didn’t mention but Gabriel knows beyond any shadow of doubt is also present - they must be absolutely accepting of humans who fall under the “queer” umbrella. It might actually be more rigidly non-negotiable than the others, even. Castiel tends to be extra-opinionated on this topic after meeting Dean in Hell.)
“Guess again on my choice of beverage, Sammy.”
It’s surprisingly easy to picture as he threads his way between the torture racks and past the occasional patrolling hellhound. Dean with large iridescent wings, because undoubtedly with his high intelligence and amazing combat proficiency he’d also be a seraph and probably lead a garrison if he was a celestial being. In this scenario, with them both being warriors, they wouldn’t be capable of meeting particularly often given that they’d be stationed outside of Heaven. But angels are eternal if they aren’t killed so it wouldn’t matter. Every handful of centuries they’d come back to each other for a short time and exchange feathers. After three or four millennia, their rotations would change and they’d have a few years in Heaven that they could spend building a nest. And that would be that.
“Okay, Dean, stop. Why are you about to kill him?”
Castiel doesn’t open his eyes, because he’s aware of how pointless it would be to do so. The same black emptiness will exist outside his eyelids just as it does behind them. He allows himself to be folded into it, and awaits a long sleep.
Also this is my first time writing Death, I think I got close to the mark with him? *cringes in fear*
Play stops when the left wing on the ice is tossed in the box:
“Yeah, because you’re a wavelength or whatever and you don’t have junk.”
He musters himself. Any reserves of strength or willpower remaining, not smothered by the Empty, are drawn together. There’s no escape and he knows that. But he needs to do
“Okay okay enough.” Dean waves his hands. “Is that why you kept getting sick and shit?”
“Yeah, shut the fuck up. Your lying ass is coming back to Bobby’s with me and you’re gonna explain yourself to them, and then we’re gonna figure this shit out.”
Dean just laughs.
“Dean, what exactly do you think we can do instead?” Bobby mumbles. “We can’t hold him somewhere and he clearly ain’t gonna see sense. What are we left with?”
Not like family as in
When did hockey become a burden on him?
This whole thing is just made even more weird and impossible by the fact that Cas is a disembodied voice in his fucking head right now.
“Yes. In twelve years, how many times have you been involved in a fatal plane crash?”
“He’s the same. It’s okay, he’ll probably wake up soon.”
“It’s not the blanket necessarily, it’s the compression. It’s about being squeezed into the mattress, it stops me from feeling like I’ll float away from the world or fall off of something. It’s grounding, it’s comforting. Like a hug, except… much less unbearable.”
“You sure you’re not too tired for this? I don’t wanna get you all sore if you got practice tomorrow morning too,” Dean asks for the third time.
Castiel is instantly horrified. “You plan to release Michael from Hell?”
And Castiel understands that it’s Dean. Dean whimpers this word, over and over again. Sobs and cries between these words. Subsequently he realizes that the peacefulness in truth stretched for approximately two minutes. The third thing that comes to him is how irredeemably he’s failed this time, possibly not as noticeable to the world or Heaven or Hell at large. But this failing is several dozen times more painful than his previous ones. Somehow, he neglected to take this into account.
to get your own wings and sometimes I miss a couple spots, but there’s nobody around to do it for me. Michael’s in the cage and I don’t have a mate.”
“Even though I shot one’a your brothers?”
Dean’s lungs shiver and he tries to open his eyes again but all his effort is concentrated in grabbing on with just that one hand.
“Usually,” Death agrees. “But you, you arrogant and clumsy little soldier, you have become a
Castiel allows himself a moment to feel exasperated before retreating to the armory to work on the bullets like Sam suggested previously. It’s not an especially difficult task to mark the rounds with the correct sigils, although after the fact he labels each box with a Sharpie by hand because he has nothing better to do and it should eat some time.
on the right-hand side. In the middle and left of the Stars’ end, Kevin and
Dean has no idea what to say anymore. He kinda… wants to believe Cas. Yeah, okay, he
“You’re not half bad at drawing,” Dean comments randomly while they eat.
“Cas?” A groan. Okay, Cas is still alive. “Hey, get up, buddy.” Dean tries to lift him - he’s nothing but limp dead weight. “C’mon, Cas.”
Dean glances at Sam, then turns his eyes back to Cas. “Talk.”
“Nothing that’s any of your business,” Raphael says in
“Suck it up, buttercup,” Gabriel snorts. “You’ll thank me when it’s over with, believe me.”
“No. You use soft materials. Presumably on Earth the construction would be slightly different from the way it’s done in Heaven.”
“Gabriel called, he’s out of intensive care and they’ll probably release him tomorrow,” Cas says once he’s swallowed.
His hands stop and he can’t make them move for a few minutes, because he doesn’t understand how this happened. He didn’t necessarily need to teach Sam the lesson at the Mystery Spot, but setting aside the fun of repeatedly ganking obnoxious-ass Dean he had good intentions the entire time because he wanted Sam to figure it out. Plus, Sam’s soul is more pleasant to look at - Dean’s is much too bright, it actually hurts Gabriel’s eyes and he has no idea how Castiel puts up with it. And when he stuck them in his idiot box, he let Sammy be the savior-doctor, and the car, and the star of the commercial. His pranks finally got Sam’s attention, and Sam reciprocated, only to take it back at the last second. Talk about mixed signals.
wait.”
“That sounds stressful,” Cas says.
“You are, actually,” Cas insists. “Instead of joining the military you should’ve been a model. And men can be pretty, not just you. In your case I might even go so far as beautiful.”
“I’m under contract, they can’t get rid of me for at least a year. And I’m not going to get in his pants, Meg. I’m a professional. Besides, I don’t personally know a single other NHL player who isn’t straight besides myself, and I’m sure he’s no exception.”
“Yeah, I do. You’re gonna hassle me about the same damn thing that Cas hasn’t shut up about for the past week and a half. Mom. It’s fine. Okay? We don’t-we don’t gotta talk about this. I don’t wanna talk about this. It’s getting real fucking old between Cas and Sam already, you don’t need to jump on too.”
“Okay.”
“Don’t go, Cas.”
For a second he’s jealous that Sammy’s gonna get to have quality family bonding time with Mom, but then he realizes that between Sam
he meant to say “with you guys” but now it’s been too long and he can’t make the save. But Cas is weirdly oblivious about certain things, maybe he won’t even notice…
He spots Dean in the hallway pacing and points. “His brother is a lawyer.”
But it’s different, now.
“Okay. Follow me from point A to point B here, champ.
of which being his death, John Winchester will never offer Dean such a thing.
Day seventy eight. Dean has been here for three weeks, which Cas knows is an unusually long stay for the average psychiatric patient. This is thanks to Sam bullying Dean’s insurance provider because Dean is clearly not well enough to be left unsupervised yet. Cas is glad that his friend has such a competent and caring brother. Dean deserves to get better.
Afterwards, Cas is still waiting outside, even though his interview was before Dean’s.
“You didn’t sleep with him
Dean grins and hugs him on arrival before signing for him. “Alright, ready to get the hell outta here finally?”
“What happened?” Castiel murmurs, leaning over to ask
“Okay. Uh. You can’t just… say shit like that, Cas.”
“Are you finding everything okay this afternoon?”
1. Dean gets subdued with tranquilizers by hospital staff for an outburst.
“It was a critical oversight on Gabriel’s part. He clearly doesn’t understand that this isn’t something that can be resolved in a ‘reasonable’ time frame.”
It’s a balancing act. Jack isn’t an NHL player, he’s an awkward and klutzy five-year-old just starting out at a team sport. Dean keeps this at the front of his mind. He refuses to do what his dad did when he was learning, to grill and grill and grill endlessly until Dean was crying and couldn’t stand up anymore. Jack doesn’t deserve that treatment. No kid does.
Dean knows that Cas compulsively asking him for consent at every tiny thing should probably be getting annoying, but he actually really appreciates it. After being ordered around and forced to do shit all his life - first by his dad, then by dickbag angels, and always,
Dean’s ears turn pink. “If you say so, man.”
“And it causes cancer in humans?” Jack reiterates with a worried frown.
The linesman drops the puck, the Edmonton centerman smacks it to his winger. The number on the jersey is
“Go for it, buddy.”
“Your brother.”
“Don’t know what to tell ya,” she shrugs. “Course if you get traded again, I can’t actually move with you, so you’ll have to find a real babysitter.”
“Bitch.”
“I do,” Castiel nods. “I’m guilty and extremely ashamed of myself. Sam.”
“Yeah, but… here.” Dean grabs his tie and messes with it briefly. Castiel puts effort into not flinching away from the physical contact. “Did someone teach you to tie those or were you just kinda left to figure it out for yourself?”
He sits Cas in the kitchen and gets the plate out of the fridge. They hang out while Cas eats and then for a little bit after, not really saying much. Dean knows they should talk about…
And so Castiel focuses. He may still be able to walk across Dean’s dreamscapes if he exerts enough effort. It takes quite a bit of strength for him to reach far enough, and Dean seems to be intoxicated which makes accessing a REM sleep cycle that much more difficult. But it’s necessary. Castiel must communicate to his love. He affects the most peaceful ideas and imagery that he can think of and subjects Dean’s subconscious to them. And he makes Dean aware of his presence.
is forced backwards over the blue line, which means all the Isles have to scramble into the neutral zone in order to not be called on an offside.
“So we’ve established that omens and signs and generally weird shit cropping up means the kid’s gonna be born soon.”
And Dean was able to bury the whole thing back then, because until now their only contact was as opponents. Starting today, he’ll be sharing a locker room with a guy whose dick he’s taken. That’s not a normal thing for him and he hates their GM right now for this trade.
Hearing that, it becomes painfully clear why Dean was able to interrupt Naomi’s control of him in the crypt. He was permanently altered to love Dean at a time long before Dean existed or had even been drawn up as a concept yet by God Himself. Castiel despairs at this revelation that he had still managed to exact such grievous harm to his human.
Tim Janklow makes too soft of a pass and the puck turns over, which gets an answering goal for Calgary almost immediately. Dean and Charlie both scream at the television loud enough that people on the other side of the building can probably hear them - right up to the point where John challenges and the refs decide that it’s not a good goal because it was technically scored on an offside. Dean laughs hysterically when the camera pans across the outraged expressions on the Flames’ bench.
“It was destroyed by one of
After the discussion with his little brother, Gabriel spends most of the rest of the night eating an endless pile of Skittles and thinking very hard about his feather-substitute. Before most of the humans get up, he materializes two perfect-temperature toaster strudels with raspberry filling and brings them to his nephew.
“Yeah.”
Jack seems distressed and his wings briefly wrap around him. “Is it because Dean has his head up his ass?”
“He’s not trying to hide,” Gabe says. “And when we brought him here to open the rift he was unconscious, so he probably doesn’t know where we are. Right now he’s in Ohio.”
“You could’ve been less mean about it,” Sam says, but there’s very little anger or resentment behind the statement.
Castiel points out.
“A suspicious death was reported this morning in the next town over from you. It might’ve been Lucifer, I called to tell you to be careful.”
Jack shakes his head slightly. “Maybe not.”
They separate and Cas tries to focus on arranging his groceries in the refrigerator, but his mind is spinning. Apparently he has “a thing” for Dean, and didn’t notice until now. But he doesn’t particularly mind, and he can keep it to himself. That’s the rule for this situation, which he’s found out the hard way - say nothing. If the other person reciprocates, Cas should wait to be approached first. If Dean feels the same way it’s reasonable to assume Dean will come to him.
“Here.” Cas hands over a locked box, Enochian symbols just barely visible under a carpet of dust and cobwebs. “This should be the last one, as far as I’m aware only three were ever written.”
“I thought you call Jack during intermissions.”
“That ain’t your job, man.”
Castiel sighs at his helmet - it’s also technically wrong, but the shades of blue are similar enough that it’ll be much harder to notice. He plasters a new sweat-wicking liner onto the area of padding that touches his forehead and then starts to carefully peel the stickers off the outside.
“What kinda noodles?” Jack whines, apparently giving up on the pizza idea at last.
“How’re you doing, Cas?”
“Think you could swing it with your mojo?”
They eat in silence for a few minutes. More accurately, Cas eats. Dean pokes at his own food with his fork and doesn’t take actual bites.
“Hello, Dean.”
“This is my library. The lives of everything on Earth are listed in those books.”
“A surprise.”
“Say it.”
Trigger warnings in endnotes.
Dating ain’t exactly
“Actually he kinda has a point on that one, buddy,” Dean grumbles. “Hey Bobby, if you knew so long, how come you never said anything?”
“Mostly. My side still kinda hurts,” he admits. “What happened to him?”
“Yeah, me too.” Dean leans in and kisses his forehead.
“Jesus,
The puck drops and they explode into motion. Crowley smacks it sideways and Castiel jumps backwards with it, away from an advancing winger. A foot up from his own blue line he tosses it to
“But shouldn’t they be trying to fix a problem if it makes them sick?”
“You offering to goon for me, Cas?”
on his paper.
“Castiel.” An angel in a female vessel approaches and stands right outside the entrance. There’s two more of them and the whole group are holding their weapons. “Where’s the Tablet?”
“Out buying groceries.”
Another door has showed up. Of
it’s a long one. And I wanted to ask you for something.”
“No problem.”
There’s just no reason for you to even exist. You contribute
Fifty subscriptions now on this fic - and incidentally I'm visibly keeping track like this because I'm just so overwhelmed at not being in a tiny fandom and/or Rarepair Hell anymore and my fics actually getting significant attention. Later, I will go back and look at the chapter notes when all of them have been posted, and grin stupidly to myself seeing the number go up each time :D
“I don’t use it. It’s for writing down my feelings, but I don’t know what most of my feelings are called, so it does me no good.”
“You should pay more attention to your Twitter presence, Cas. There’ve been some interesting developments with your fans as of this morning.”
Dean shakes his head. “I HAVE TO GO I THINK WE’RE LOADING IN A COUPLE MINUTES”
“Thank you. And in return I’m going to also do my best to gain a more thorough understanding of human emotions so that I can be better at communicating with you.”
“It just feels like… he should get to know. Dean really loves you, Cas, and if you
So Dean goes to the kitchen and makes a sandwich.
“Great. Now get the hell out,” Dean orders, because he seriously ain’t in the mood to handle whatever new unreasonable request he’s about to get. Cas wouldn’t show up and heal him for no reason, there’s gotta be something else nasty waiting just around the corner. When Cas does nothing Dean rolls his eyes. “Don’t you got someplace better to be right now? Like guarding seals or whatever?”
Stop and think about this!” his brother demands.
“That’s okay, it’s all in the arms. Here, c’mere.”
“No, Dean. I’m sorry for all of it, but there was no other way. We don’t need to talk about this now if you don’t want, either.”
Castiel completely tunes out and ignores everything John says to him during the intermission. He has no reason to believe any of it is relevant to his actual on-ice performance. Instead, he thinks of more important things, like how Jack is starting peewee hockey next week. It’s on Jack’s request, of course. Castiel in no way pressured him about it and asked several times if that’s what he really wanted, and his response was always the same: he wants to play hockey so he can be like his dad and like his Uncle Gabe. (Gabriel, naturally, was thrilled to learn this.)
“Whatever, pal.”
It’s not that easy, though - it’s never that easy with Lucifer. Gabriel gets hauled backwards into a concrete pillar, not smashing through but definitely cracking it. He flies before Lucifer can throw him again, landing on top of a machine and trying to dive down and spear his brother with his archangel blade.
“This is so fucked.”
“My Father instructed us all to love them.”
Day sixty one.
Nick was apparently served an instigator penalty on top of the five minute major. Castiel quietly wonders who, exactly, John bribed to get that call out of the refs, but he also isn’t complaining about it because now that bastard won’t be back until almost the end of the 1st.
“Back to Dean?”
“Your dad’s a dick,” Dean mumbles, squeezing him a little.
“Yeah, no big loss. You know how she is, she’d rather stay home and work. I should be back on the ice for the Dads Trip, though… I’m bringing Bobby this year.”
Crowley does. That man is simultaneously extremely talented and indescribably unprofessional, and Castiel is beyond tired of his antics. The only reason he doesn’t step in and interfere is that he hates John even more and he knows John deserves it.
“Yeah. Well. Here’s the thing. He was a mean drunk, I mean
Thin tracks of moisture trickle down both of their faces. For a moment, a moment Castiel likely doesn’t have to waste, they stare at each other in silence.
But Dean does what Cas asked, and he’s got a deep breath and then four words. “Cas, I… love you.”
“Will you please try to make me understand why…?”
Seven days post-hospital and Cas is out replenishing his food supply. He’s having lunch with his sister and oldest brother today, which he’s not looking forward to at all, but Michael may be able to help get him more services so it’s in his best interests no matter how awkward and unpleasant it’ll inevitably end up being.
He almost forgot the hand was on his arm this whole time until now, because suddenly it gets real tight and he’s being dragged through clouds of steel wool. Dean clings to Cas, refusing to let go of him now. It feels like he’s getting peeled and eventually it gets to the point where it doesn’t make sense that neither of them is shredded up like cabbage and bleeding all over the place.
“You’re welcome.”
Hey, look at that. Dean’s found words again. “Well good for you, Cas. You’re such a fucking child. Okay, this turned out way better than it would’a otherwise and that’s only because another you showed up to un-fuck the situation. So you don’t get any fucking brownie points with me for admitting you’re wrong. I already know you’re wrong, dammit! I’m the one that
Dean’s breathing way too hard for a guy who’s just reading a fucking book.
“Am I that predictable?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jack, are you alright?” is Castiel’s first question.
“I will,” Cas promises, nodding.
“How likely, Cas?”
“Oh, absolutely,” Sam agrees, nodding. “They’re the worst at feelings.”
At this, Castiel ultimately decides not to press the issue further, because Dean seems genuinely overwhelmed and not just avoiding the subject like before. He regrets that humans have such a low tolerance for abnormal situations; Dean’s is higher than most, but he still has limits. The fact that Dean, who often refuses to sit still in favor of “going out and finding something to punch,” is about to take a nap in the middle of the day speaks to how far he’s been forced to stretch. It also occurs to Castiel that thanks to the incompatible time flows of Heaven and earth, Dean’s been awake for an entire day despite it only being one in the afternoon.
“Shut up,” Gabriel sneers. “I know you don’t wanna hear the sad horrible truth about yourself, and that just makes me need to say it extra-loud so it
Cas leaves just before the end of group to meet his psychiatrist… or so he thinks. It’s actually his brother Raphael waiting for him. Cas doesn’t appreciate this at all. Because of his autism as much as his alleged psychosis, he doesn’t have agency over his own life. That means Raphael is in charge, and Cas doesn’t get to leave the hospital until Raphael says so. But Cas is also horribly aware that Raphael doesn’t like him, and so he’ll never be allowed out.
“Pfft, I’ll be fine, I’m still intact in all the ways that count. Anyhoo, I got what I came for, so I’ll let you two get back to screwing each other senseless or whatever it is you were doing before I called.”
When that’s done with, they finally pile onto the ice of the practice arena. Dean almost sighs with relief as his skates cut in, because for the first three seconds it’s like coming home, he’s had this feeling under his feet since he was four years old and it’s almost more familiar to him than the voice of his own mother. Then the responsibility comes crashing back down again. He wears the C now, which is actually something he never wanted, and it just means an extra ten layers of expectations (which will all inevitably end in disappointment) from his dad.
“Just the usual reasons,” Dean complains. “You wanna come hang out and watch dumb chick-flicks with me this weekend?”
Cas knows that because he draws a calendar each month, with help from a nurse’s cell phone. The nurses like him, usually. They’re nice to him even though he screams and panics sometimes. Of course… everyone screams and panics sometimes, here. But they like him. They like him because he doesn’t get angry with them, he doesn’t yell at them or try to kick them. He understands that it isn’t their fault he has to be here. And because they like him, they’ve managed to keep him by himself, not place a roommate.
did you?”
Dean startles so hard he actually falls off the bench and onto the floor. “Jesus, don’t sneak up on me like that! I can’t head a team if I’m dead from a fuckin’ heart attack, y’know!”
chosen to smite some sinner? You just gotta wait for the divine bat signal, is that it?”
So far, they’ve managed to get Kevin and Victor in on the scheme. Kevin is new to the NHL and still has an idealized view of things, which means he hasn’t been completely crushed into submission yet, and Victor is a long-time veteran of awful coaching practices and knows things need to change. Four players, all at once, corroborating the story that John Winchester is unfit to be leading a hockey team is a fairly powerful group perspective as far as media is concerned.
The most prevalent one, the one he chooses to focus on as intensely as he can, is that he never understood until recently what could make angels desire to mate. He’d known most of the others in Heaven, at least well enough to put a face to a name, and that included the functionaries. Only rarely did garrison soldiers or intelligence officers bother to court and find mates, but the bureaucratic workers and soul archivists had plenty of time for such things. This idea by itself wouldn’t be impure but for the fact that Castiel now imagines how it would be if Dean was also an angel and they could’ve proceeded with the process.
“I think…”
“Yeah, it’s waiting for you at Gabe’s house, I was even nice and gassed it up for you.”
“Yes, this is Gabriel. He’s the only one of my siblings who… actually likes me,” Cas admits.
Dean feels his ears get hot and he clears his throat. “Uh. Okay. Thanks.”
Interestingly, John has exactly nothing to say about this to any of them. Castiel would’ve thought it might stand to reason that here he berates them for disrupting the game, but he’s strangely silent on the issue. That seems odd but also indicative of an extremely disturbing truth.
“Sounds about right,” Sam whispers. “Cas… I get why you don’t wanna tell Dean. Really, as awful as this all is, I get that. And probably in your shoes I’d do the same thing. But um. I wish you would’a told me at least and not let me figure it out on my own.”
“Okay. Gabe, Dean, Cas, you guys go set the trap. Mom, Bobby, you’re going to help me get everyone armed up, we’ll pray when we’re ready and Gabe can come grab us all for the fight.”
They’re finally allowed to have their break.
Maybe Cas gets the message, or maybe he just decides to take pity. Either way, he keeps his mouth shut, and Dean goes out with everyone else for the middle period of the game.
Dean’s hands wrap in his shirt and coat, getting a firm grip in order to slam his face down into the table over and over again. Castiel is wrenched down to the floor after, flipped over, one of Dean’s hands yanking his angel blade out of his sleeve and the other holding him by the tie. It’s pointed at him. Blood pours down his face. He’s about to die, at the hands of a man who once talked him into rebelling against Heaven on the grounds that life is valuable.
“I figured. Let’s go.”
His nerves are coming back on. Dean slowly starts to understand that something’s happening. His brain sluggishly tries to catch up while he notices air coming into his lungs again, but there’s no pain to go along with it. He knows this feeling, these warm tinglies happening just under the surface of his skin. He used to feel like this when Cas was healing him… but that’s not it, obviously. It must be Jack.
“In what way?”
“Uh. Right.” Sam sits down. “So Dean said that your older brother has agency over you and you’re looking to challenge…”
“Where’s Jack?” he repeats, slightly harsher this time.
Gabriel complains.
“Dammit, Cas, we talked about this.” Dean’s forehead gently drops against the space between his shoulder blades. “Hello is when you walk into a room. Good morning is when you wake up in the same bed and then your boyfriend fucks you through the mattress.”
“Cas, I’m-”
Sleeping hurts. Everything hurts. Dean’s always throbbing, behind his eyes and under his ribs. He acts like he’s not in pain when Sammy’s around, and by now he’s gotten good at that, at pretending. But the feeling never leaves him for real. It’s a constant aching pulse that only cools when he’s ramming something sharp through warm flesh. His hands itch endlessly for destruction and death. And everything else - pain. He lies down and his mattress is made of needles. His blankets grind against his skin.
“I’m not,” Cas murmurs, and then kisses him.
Until the therapist tells him the following: “Castiel, the last five times I was here, all you did was draw bees. Can you try something else this time?”
to make his friend understand. “Because the Dean Winchester I know would never have murdered that kid.”
he had any sense of fairness at all. I can assure you he doesn’t.”
“So you got no plan, you don’t even got
“Then - I’ll keep going with you.”
Anna picks up on the second ring. “Injury or nursing shift?” is how she greets him, well-versed in this circus routine by now.
“I never deserved that,” Cas interrupts, voice cracking slightly. “And I especially never deserved your forgiveness. I still haven’t done anything to earn either of those things, Dean. And I don’t mind being erased for that reason among an endless list of others.”
“Are you gonna be home this week?”
Dean can’t stop himself - and even if he could, he wouldn’t want to. He yanks Cas upright in bed for the tightest, squeezingest hug possible. Cas hugs back, a little weaker after spending almost a week in bed doing nothing. And afterwards their foreheads rest together while Dean sobs and Cas giggles hysterically, both of them losing their minds for a few seconds. And Dean is so glad he’s back.
“Please,” Cas begs, unable to explain himself. Words desert him.
“I’m still cold,” Dean complains, adjusting his sunglasses. “Why didn’t you warn me that I’d be all hollowed out or whatever after you got back in your own skin, Cas?”
“A what now?”
“You love it,” Dean snickers.
Gabriel crams another donut into his mouth and essentially swallows it whole before answering. “I had an idea.”
The second line is, admittedly, marginally better than the first line, in that when they make it to the attacking zone they try (and even manage) to put some shots on goal. That doesn’t mean they succeed at actually scoring, of course. The whole team is off tonight, yelling at each other and not connecting the way they should. Castiel takes mental notes on all of this. He’ll tell his sister later so she can write about it, this terrible culture made by John where they’re irreparably demoralized and at times simply lose their ability to function as a unit.
“If it’s so hard to groom our own wings, why did God design us this way?”
participating in arguably the most homophobic mainstream sport in the country - men are falling all over themselves to be my spouse.
Jack watches, completely still, crying but absolutely silent about it.
Even keeping his eyes out to observe his teammates, Dean still works in tandem with Benny perfectly. They’ve been first-pair defense together for over six years now and they know each other’s moves by rote, it’s at the point even that despite what John says there’s no more possible improvements they can make to their partnership because everything is tuned just right.
“C’mon, man, I ain’t looking for an apology here. ’Cause. There’s stuff, for me, I never asked for. I figured I couldn’t have it, either. ’Cause I didn’t know angels can feel, which is kinda stupid’a me since you got turned mostly human a couple times.”
“Yes, when I attempted to return your audio cassette tape.”
3. Discussion of child abuse at the hands of siblings.
“But I want pizza.”
Trigger warnings in endnotes.
“He seems like a good guy,” she agrees, wiping moisture away on the sleeve of her shirt.
“Y’know if you ruin your mouthguard your teeth’ll get fucked if you take a hit to the face.”
The first concrete thing he figures out is hair, somebody else’s hair against his ear and the side of his face. It takes six tries to get his stupid, heavy eyelids to open just a little bit, and most of what he can see are Sam’s legs. Okay. So Sammy has nothing to do with whatever’s going on right now. Dean realizes he’s on his knees on the barn floor and his eyes won’t stay open on their own yet.
Dean does nothing, just sits there gasping for breath - it’s not Dean in charge right now anyway, it’s Castiel, because Dean can’t take how badly hurt he is anymore and is rapidly losing consciousness. Castiel may be right behind his boyfriend, actually, between his wings and the gaping hole in his side.
“You… can I see your wings?” he blurts out, because apparently he has nothing better to do with this fucking conversation that he begged so hard for them to have.
Dean can’t handle this, actually, he’s pretty sure he’s about to break under the weight of everything Cas has said to him. “But now you’re gonna die soon.”
Dean gives them his best smile and says “CONGRATULATIONS” with the biggest, wildest movements he possibly can. “WHEN DO I GET TO BE AN UNCLE?”
Cas demands in his I’m-at-the-end-of-my-fucking-rope-with-you voice.
“You look even more constipated than usual, Feathers,” Crowley remarks from his right. “May we get you some colon-blow?”
The warding is gone.
The sound of angel wings that are actually healthy gets both their attention - it’s Gabe and he looks panicked.
“Because it’s extremely rare for an angel to be the party that carries the Nephilim. So in all honesty, the thought simply didn’t occur to me.”
“Do you need a hug?”
“You should sleep, Dean. You’ve been through an ordeal.”
Cas’ abrupt stop is telling. “What?” Dean growls.
Charlie complains, and he can fucking
Dean laughs, shakes his head, and doesn’t say anything else.
They go back to the locker room and John rips them both new ones - Castiel for leaving, and then Dean for not somehow psychically
“I don’t know. What he did was an illegal check. I can’t say whether he thinks what he did was right at the time, but I could see it from the bench, if one of their players did that to us I would get very angry about it.”
“Cas, I’m fucking quitting,” Dean announces, much too casually in his opinion. “Lucifer’s dead, Hell’s in too much disorder to be a real threat right now, you’re about to get a huge power-up and Sammy’s got a brand new army of hunters to send out and take care of shit. And I… man, I gotta be honest, I’m just so done with this.” He half-laughs the words. “I can sit here and do what Bobby did, I know most’a the lore off the top of my head by now anyway so I’mma just sit on my ass and pretend to be an FBI director over the phone. Maybe every so often I can drive out to back up Jody or Donna with a case or whatever, but besides that…”
“By caring for Earth,” Castiel answers. “Our Father also commanded us to look after humanity in His place. Slaughtering them wholesale is counterintuitive to that order. Our focus should be on trying to put Hell back in its place. Demons are very active and have grown too bold, and there aren’t enough human hunters to negate them. Additionally, I know for a fact that Crowley is a much bigger threat than he initially appears to be. His intelligence and cunning are only matched by his cruelty.”
“Cassie!” Gabriel hugs him. (Gabriel is the only one besides Dean who currently has hugging privileges.) “It took me until now to figure out which hospital Raph tossed you in after the last one.”
be asking is why he suddenly forgot how to do his fucking job, he has to focus on the game ahead of him and nothing else because otherwise he’s totally gonna run into one of his teammates and knock them both over like a complete dumbass the way he just did five seconds ago.
“Sammy, is this real?” Dean asks, hoarsely. His back aches where he got skewered but it’s fading.
“Was this… on purpose?”
“You don’t even know what I did and you’re thanking me,” he teases.
The checking line is on the ice, along with the first D-pair; Dean and
“What, Cas.”
“Is this really the best time and place for this conversation?” Castiel demands, not out of any desire to help the situation but rather from a place of pure spite because Crowley gets on his nerves. When Castiel was a Ranger and Crowley was a Devil, they inevitably threw hands at least once every time they faced each other.
is draining. Castiel shakes his head and says nothing.
“Do you… believe that you deserve to die because of that?”
of course, and like, obviously he already knew that was there, but it seems extra-present tonight now that he’s team captain. The skates left by his dad for him to fill are just too big, he’ll never live up to that, his own
There are other coping mechanisms as well, which he learned from multiple different therapists when he was still in school. Mentally he lists everything that he’s done today: they flew in this morning from Colorado, Castiel took a nap the second he got to his apartment, he had a late lunch after he woke up, he and Jack played video games together until Anna arrived, they had dinner, Castiel left to go to Nassau Coliseum on his own.
“Supposing we succeed and Anna gains agency over me, what happens after?” Cas wonders.
“Wow, okay. Tell you what, buddy, your dad’s busy right now, but we got some littler weights over there that you can prob’ly handle. If you want I can show you how us pros do it, help you get ahead in your own hockey training.”
“Cas, they’re gonna be fine. There’s two’a them and only one Satan. Don’t get all distracted on me now, buddy.”
Seventy four subscribers... I think by this point I should just call you guys "audience" instead, because seventy four is actually a lot of people. I have an audience of readers, like murder of crows or a herd of buffalo or a pod of whales :D
Apparently Dean’s hand was a sacrifice to the Hockey Gods tonight, though, because Frank is doing amazing so far. By the time they hit the twelve minute mark in the 1st the Bolts are already getting visibly frustrated, because Victor and Jesse both have goals to their names at this point but Tampa is still at zero on their own ice.
“Am I being mocked for wearing your necktie?” Cas asks, way too seriously.
Jack’s left wing twitches as Gabriel scrapes some old dirt and dried blood out from between two primaries. “That feels funny.”
But Castiel’s sense of time passing has been altered by Dean, perhaps permanently. Having spent so long on Earth, continuously no less, he’s semi-adjusted to the human view of it. His chronological perception has ground to a screeching halt by comparison to his brethren.
“Yes. I burned my hands extracting her soul from my being.”
“Anna is a psychology professor and Raphael is a lawyer… which you’re already aware of, sorry,” Cas realizes. “Michael is in the air force, he’s a very decorated pilot, which is the extent of my knowledge about him as a person. And Lucifer is in prison for three different murders, each with life sentences and no chance of parole. Although… we’re fairly certain there were at least seven and they weren’t able to prove the other four.”
about things, just less cranky than usual.
“Okay.”
“Maybe. I do regret it a little bit now, since I know more about what makes humans tick. Anyway, it’s also part of why I stood up to Lucy in the hotel dining room. I didn’t want to see him riding around in your meat. It was too unsettling. Obviously that didn’t turn out so well for me, but after I got rescued from Evil Colonel Sanders it was mostly because of you that I found my way back.”
And also Cas is still an angel, and angels can read minds.
When the waitress comes by to give them their check, she sees them still holding hands and asks how long they’ve been together - and apparently their perpetual staring match hasn’t gone unnoticed, because she doesn’t believe Dean when he tells her thirty seconds.
Dean is taking a nap in their room and Cas refuses to disturb him for something that will only put him in distress. The phone rings again. Cas picks it up.
“Until the end of next week.”
totally
Castiel charges after it. He snatches it about a second before a Star can reach it instead, attempting to move towards his team’s attacking zone but without a real viable route to do so at the moment. Instead he tries to pass to
“No, dude,
“An epic bromance already in the making, possibly without the ‘b.’ All your fangirls lose their minds whenever they see you with your new alternate.”
The thing is, as long as he’s hung out on earth, Gabriel hasn’t spent much time with humans outside of tormenting them. Mostly he’s been around gods and their monsters, that kinda crowd. He needs an expert.
“Any names off the top of your head?”
“No.”
“Not with your hands, no. But with your joke-spell. That could be considered touching. The fact that he allowed that to happen, because he certainly could’ve stopped it if he’d wanted to, speaks to how serious he is about this. In fact he even asked me for input as to why you got so upset with him. The situation is simply the result of two largely incompatible means of communication and thinking. Interspecies courting can be difficult.”
“Don’t get all sarcastic with me, boy. Now, forget Heaven and your damn archangels and the apocalypse for a minute, wouldja? Do you even understand why Dean’s so mad?”
“The demons… I don’t necessarily feel safe enough attending therapy groups.”
“And what’s stopping you from sending him my way when he does?”
up for me some kinda fruity liquor with the little umbrella?” Cas snaps it into existence and holds it still just to the side so that all Dean has to do is turn his head slightly and sip through the straw. He hums. “Hm. I think Crowley kept drinking these when I was a demon and we were hanging out at the bar…”
A quiet chuckle.
“Um. Yes, I am all those things,” he agrees. “Let me speak with Dean first. I’d like his input before deciding anything.”
“Mom, there’s something you need to know.” He can’t ever tell Sam about this, but Cas is already aware of it and for some reason it seems weirdly wrong to not explain himself to his own damn mother. “Dad, um. Dad drank a lot after you died.”
“No, Dean. No ‘but.’ And I’m also not interested in hearing how much you think you don’t deserve it. I don’t care if you deserve it or not, and it’s irrelevant in what form your affection to me is returned, be that platonic or familial.” He very obviously leaves out romantic as an option there, but Dean totally forgets that in the next second. “As a very close friend once said to me when I was being foolish, it’s a gift, and you keep those.”
“Yeah, we heard you the first time, you damn killjoy,” Gabe says.
Mostly, Gabriel is just trying to get his attention. Sam doesn’t strike him as a guy with a very well-developed sense of humor, which is why he’s not prepared for his wings to suddenly be all gummed up with rubber cement.
“There was a player misconduct from charging that resulted in an opponent being severely injured, he was ejected from the game and will face further punishment later.”
Sam is found in the kitchen drinking coffee strong enough to hold up a machete and eating an egg white omelet with vegetables. The refugees gather in the main space for their meals usually, because they’re so used to eating together and that’s where there’s room enough for all of them to congregate. The Winchesters still eat in their kitchen. Gabriel’s just glad that Destiel seem to be elsewhere right now.
“NO BUT I NEED TIME TO THINK SO THAT I DON’T TALK LIKE A DUMBASS ABOUT IT” Dean says, grinning at him.
“Fine.” He sounds so resigned about it.
Well that’s a hell of a conversation starter.
“I’m not gay, Cas!” Dean bellows.
“Uncle Gabe, are you teaching me to fight some more today?”
“Uncle Gabe wants me to wear my Sens jersey more!”
Play stops on an offside; the fourth line and the first D-pair change on. Dean and Benny take position a few feet back from the dot and Crowley moves a little too soon, so he gets tossed and Castiel takes the faceoff instead. The linesman drops the puck and Castiel slaps it directly onto the blade of Dean’s stick like he’s got eyes in the back of his head or something.
“You seem angry.”
“Don’t
“Hello, Sam. Bobby. To start with, it’s necessary for this conversation that you’re aware angels can bend time.”
“Sure, you can fight humans, probably a few different kinds of monster, regular angels. But in all the ways that matter, you, bucko, are an archangel. And you should know how to hit like one. Trust me, it’s important. Lucy’s gonna show up and paint the walls with our guts sooner or later, so you need to know how to fight back before that happens.”
“What, Cas?”
The Habs aren’t about to take this lying down, of course. They’ve sent their checking line out to face the Isles now, which
The wings take a little getting used to. They’re not like. In the way or anything, but he can feel them sticking outta his back and it’s just so damn weird. He only had them once before, when alt-Michael was in him to go after Lucifer. Maybe he can ask Jack to let him keep the grace without the damn wings.
“Has he been taking his meds?” is Sam’s first question.
“I know, he’s really good, it makes the awkwardness worth it.”
“There’s this one other thing that stuck.” Dean tries to brace himself. He has to do this. He consciously reminds himself that his dad’s been dead for almost fourteen years and nobody’s gonna hit him for this, and even if they do he’s big enough to hit back now. “How come you never said anything until then? Before you made that deal, I mean. You said… happiness isn’t in having, whatever the hell that means.” Dean knows exactly what it means, actually, but he can stall that part a little by playing dumb for a few seconds. “But you could’a told me, y’know. Did you - did I do something? Did you not trust me to be cool about it? Because when Charlie was alive-”
“Really? We’re going to do the whole three little pigs schtick? I’m gonna have to huff and puff and break your bedroom door in? Hm?”
“Your boyfriend?” Cas wonders as Dean hangs up.
“How the hell should I know?” Dean yells, genuinely outraged now. “Whatever it was, apparently it wasn’t good enough, or the world wouldn’t be in this fucking mess right now!” Dean makes a grab for a duffle bag that’s piled on a nearby table and yanks out an angel blade. “Get outta my face before I decide to stop bein’ nice about this and fucking end you right here.”
“Cool!”
he realizes.
Castiel has no idea what that means, so he ignores it, assuming it’s some kind of “saying.” He shakes his head.
“Sammy, I’m not here to find dates,” Dean snaps.
Castiel smiles miserably. “I don’t think it matters how I feel, Mary.”
“It’s not your fault.” Cas closes his eyes and tries to relax. “I’m glad you’re here.”
it has! There’s finally a door at the end of the hall. Dean growls and goes over to it to read the label.
“Did it hurt?”
“No.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I told you everything I know.”
“I blame your dad for teaching you that hockey is the be-all-end-all of the universe,” Charlie grumbles.
“Yeah, well, it’s because your dads are idiots who can’t figure anything out. And not only that, they’re
It’s now that Cas has a truly disturbing thought.
It’s the smallest, dumbest fucking thing that finally breaks him.
Hockey is arguably the most homophobic major sport there is, to such a degree that it’s almost too easy to ignore the fact that the Isles’ PR team loudly boasting about being the most inclusive club in the league is at least half performative allyship for brownie points with SJWs who probably don’t even watch the damn sport in the first place. Yes, they have seven queer players, yes they have three players of color, yes a lot of their support staff are something other than cishet white guys.
“I can’t undo this. And I can’t fix it. But I meant what I said. You’re good. I love you. I want you to live.”
“Of course you are. And you’re also unable to see your goal through without outside assistance. It seems pertinent for you to be aware of that.”
Dean refuses to feel awkward about this. He already had his mental breakdown about it two days ago when he got informed that Castiel was joining their roster. Plus, judging by Castiel’s own lack of awkwardness or freaking out, it’s a pretty safe bet the guy doesn’t remember anyway.
The medical trainers get him off the ice and while walking to the quiet room it occurs to Castiel to become extremely angry about this, because Jack and Anna had to see that happen to him and now both of them are probably upset. He’s about to have a meltdown in the middle of a game, and sitting in the unlit space with a medical trainer on his left he digs all his fingers into the back of his neck in an attempt to interrupt the psychological stress.
“That’s not possible. I’ll stay as long as I can, and you’ll remember this dream when you awake. But you can’t sleep forever and I’m not able to maintain this.”
“Well, I like yours,” Sam admits quietly.
“Yeah. Okay. We’re gonna - we’re gonna talk about this some more later,” Dean decides. “C’mon.”
“I know you’re not. But now you know, going forward, that there’s no reason why you should have to continue not being okay with it. And in some capacity, I understand why you feel this way.”
“No. He is unreasonably tall, but he’s human.”
“I see. That’s very responsible of you, but why aren’t they in a pharmacy container?”
He checks his watch a couple times, but mostly just for curiosity reasons. It’s not a chore for him at all, because he knows Cas is okay and the Empty hasn’t tried to snatch him back or something. That’s Dean’s new biggest fear, like he doesn’t have enough fear and especially enough giant nightmare-inducing fears already. He can’t lose Cas again, not after that. Not after everything. And now that Cas is human, vulnerable, mortal…
“I need a list of everything your brother’s been in,
“Well, you should keep reading anyway,” the kid insists.
“Yeah, I can be pissed and not want you to straight up murder the guy!” he yells, throwing his arms out to his sides and almost flinging the whiskey bottle by accident. “I’m not gonna let you do this, so come up with something better!”
“Me and Jack. He’s out of kindergarten for the day, and you’re here, it seemed like a good idea.”
Cas wants that future for them. He thinks Dean might, too.
“I know. I’m sorry.”
Lucifer picks him up under his arms, sloppily hefting his weight. The movement jars his undoubtedly shattered ribs and he cries out even though he can’t quite breathe. Cas’ eyes don’t want to stay open. He’s going to die, why is Lucifer still moving him around and dragging it out?
“Angels’ lifespans are infinite. I have existed for over four billion years, so from my perspective the lifetime of a human is extremely brief. For you it should be a very long time.”
“Yeah, but they’re itchy and painful because new feathers are trying to grow but the old ones are still stuck there.”
“HOW MUCH DID YOU SEE?”
As always, John has nothing nice to say to them.
“Wh-Dean, come on!” Sam groans.
“Dean. Sam. Listen to me. Bringing it here will put all three of us in peril as well, and not only from Heaven’s soldiers. The level of uncontrollable power in a Nephilim is absurd and beyond description.”
“Done.”
“This would be so much easier if he was an angel, then I could just offer a feather,” Gabriel gripes.
“Yeah. Cool. Whatever.” Ever the skeptic. Castiel recalls Dean’s rant to Sam in the church in 2006. “Look what you did, now my dad’s all knocked out over there. Some angel you are, mister.”
“Cas,” he calls sometimes, still really hoarse from the massive fucking chest trauma.
“Excellent job helping the other team,” he snarks.
Dean watches him for an uncomfortable moment, glowering visage never softening. But finally he lowers the blade and puts it away again, then stares out through the windshield at some undefined distant point in the night.
is really an angel, because it didn’t actually have wings, it just randomly made some shadows that looked like wings. Not the same thing. Angels are supposed to have feathers and shit.
“No. I don’t know how it works, it wasn’t meant for angels. It’s reasonable to assume that’s why Naomi wants it. I have to keep it away from her.”
“Angry,” Cas spits. “I don’t want to see you, Raphael.”
Dean peers at him uncertainly. “Is one’a those signs maybe angels getting sick?”
“Just trust me, Dean.”
The nurse’s voice approaches from the hall.
Dean snorts. “You gonna give my brother the silent treatment, man?”
“Right.” Dean snags a second beer and heads to the library. Sitting down again and staring at the fucking book, trying to remember where he stopped, something occurs to him. “So Gabe’s the main source for this, right?”
Dad comes in, except he’s not Dad right now, he’s John Winchester, a legend with a retired number and current head coach of the Islanders. Objectively, he’s a smart guy and an effective leader, and he puts together teams that are absolutely
They dispense the benzodiazepine medication to him and the nurse sits with him until he can breathe again. He still wonders where his wings went, he can’t feel them. But he’s sure they’re supposed to be there, he only can’t find them in the mirror when he looks…
Cas goes back to sulking again. “Raphael wanted-”
Open the fridge. There’s beers in there. Dean still checks for cracks, but he can’t find any, so he grabs two of the glass bottles and closes it again. And he realizes part of him, a tiny part that still hopes for things no matter how much he knows he shouldn’t bother, wants this bullshit to be true. He wants that thing wearing the guy with the stupid coat to be an angel. He wants to be considered good enough to be rescued from Hell, him,
“God had nothing to do with it. Earth is a hallway of his little glass figurines and you equate to a wrecking ball. Instead of television, I watch your interactions with the Winchesters.”
Cas dimly realizes that’s what the explosions were earlier. It’s surprising, now, to know how loud guns are when fired indoors.
“No, Cas, that’s not the expression, it’s ‘tearing off a band-aid.’” Bobby stares and Dean hurries to explain. “He’s hitching a ride with me right now, that’s how I got here without being dead. I’m kinda. Um. Dying.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas practically yells at the phone despite it being less than five feet from him.
“DON’T YOU FUCKING DARE” Sam says, finally pulling the bitchface out from hiding again.
“Don’t you think it would’a been helpful to clue me in, though?” Dean growls. He’s not angry at Bobby so much as he’s angry at
Finally: “Why’re you so pissed at Sammy and not me?”
“The center should’ve passed to the right wing instead of the left,” Castiel comments.
“Yeah, well…” Sam shrugs slightly and sets aside the now-empty bottle. “Have you even gotten to hold her since the first time?”
For the first time since the apocalypse when he’d embarked on his search for God, Castiel finds himself praying. Not in Enochian or Latin, especially not in English, but in impressions. Angels are technically a telepathic species and it’s not unreasonable to think that perhaps this will be clearer to God than any words can be about his feelings and intentions. It’s why there aren’t descriptors for emotions in Enochian. Angels can simply pass along how they feel to each other if they choose, assuming said feelings are within the range of approved non-logical responses to stimuli.
“I don’t know why he would, I’m not comfortable in this conversation. Especially not with you. We’re done speaking about it.”
“I… yes, possibly…”
“Hello, Dean. Were you sleeping?”
“Since when?” he demands, jumping out of bed and shoving Cas back a couple steps with his hands. “You let fucking-” He chokes around Alastair’s name and swallows the word back down. “You let him kick my ass in that room and I almost died, then you pop up in the hospital and don’t heal me. Now you’re here and I
And in front of Dean, Cas is lying on the ground in a pile. Not moving. Not breathing. Not doing anything.
“Okay, look, Cas. If the fucker really wants in, he’s prob’ly gonna find a way in no matter what you do. When something’s coming after you, it goes in this order: your first choice is to run, then if you can’t run you hide, and if you can’t do either, fight. You’re not trained or armed, fighting should be the last resort for you. Keep your phone and your keys in your pocket at all times. Now if you get stuck in there and have to hide, call me. Call and say nothing, I’ll assume the worst and come running. But we don’t want it coming to that, okay? Your best bet is to escape if you can and come to me instead.”
“Okay, whatever. That ain’t the point.”
“Anyway, I think you’re not a hundred percent right on that one, Cas. I think maybe having’s got a lot to do with happiness. And I also think even with the being and saying parts, you probably still want to
“It’s not likely I’ll be able to reply again soon, or realistically speaking ever again at all. But I promise I can hear you. Please speak to me as much as you want. I love you, Dean Winchester.”
“In theory,” Cas hurries to add.
Dean raises his eyebrows and stares at Cas. “See? It ain’t just me.”
“Good. Then Raphael can’t hurt you anymore.”
Dean just shakes his head, he can’t take off his gloves and he can’t really sign while wearing them because they’re too chunky. Cas squints and then watches his hands for a second, seeming to figure it out. Dean shakes his head again, silently begging Cas not to say anything.
Castiel sits, drinks Gatorade, chews his mouthguard. He watches his teammates. Dean, despite all the criticism John sends his way, is an incredibly talented and truly spectacular hockey player. He’s extremely competent at reading the ice and anticipating the moves of everyone around him, and his skill with the puck seems above average for a defenseman.
felt a pain this bad, not even that time Metatron gutted him. The second the pain finally stops it feels like he’s being yanked downwards, kinda like when he got eaten by a Hellhound and dragged into the pit, except not. He can’t see a god damn thing, either. What’s extra-weird (and a little ironic) is that there’s a phantom sensation of Jack’s hand holding onto his upper arm, just under the same spot where Cas grabbed him and ripped him out of Hell twelve years ago. But that’s good. That’s his lifeline through all this.
“Cas, this is Dean, he’ll be your roommate from now on.”
“Not exactly.”
I refuse to allow him to make that mistake.”
“Yes, I understand. I believe we’re having a ‘team bonding moment.’”
“With the mark being visible and accessible, it offers some amount of protection from demons attempting to steal you. The mark can only be removed by the entity that placed it there to begin with. Hence Alastair’s expectations of taking you back with him being unrealistic. It’s possible that he could’ve done it, but there’d be resistance and if he did manage to get you down there his power to harm you would’ve been severely hampered. Of course, you’d also be rescued again.”
“I’m friends with an angel?” An unrestrained and frankly gargantuan smile grows on his face. “That’s awesome, I can’t wait to have some badass monster hanging around to help me with hunts and shit! You can kill stuff, right? I bet you make it so I’m better about flying too. Is Dad cool with you being friends with me? Does Bobby have books about you? Hey, can you make me not be allergic to cats anymore?” The excited expression abruptly falls away again. “Actually, can you make me not be such a big fuckup all the time? Dad got hurt ’cause of me today, that’s why he’s so mad.”
Dean snorts. “I don’t know about that first part.” They both people-watch for a few moments before he speaks again. “Listen, there’s something I wanted to ask you about.”
“Thought you ain’t allowed,” Dean snarks, glaring at him.
“Maybe. You’re thirty four years old, does it even matter anymore?”
Light flares from the eyes and mouth of the enemy angel they just stabbed and Castiel notes the wing color - a warrior, yes, but still an ordinary angel.
feel safe again simply because Dean is here. As he’s dozing off he thinks for a moment that Dean is nuzzling his neck a little bit, but maybe he dreams that, it’s hard to be sure. He doesn’t get very deeply asleep, though, because his phone starts to buzz annoyingly on the side table close to his head. Cas grumbles and stretches painfully while Dean answers for him and puts it on speaker.
FYI, due to semi-unexpectedly being out of state for a family camping trip last week, I posted chapter 11 several days early. With that in mind, you may want to back up to that chapter and check to make sure you didn't miss it by accident due to the temporary disobedience of the posting schedule :)
And the crying begins anew.
“It’s okay, Sam! I went with him and made sure there was no malicious tampering!” Jack speaks up helpfully.
“Oh.” Castiel still holds back his malaise with great effort and dredges up another in a long series of lies to his boyfriend. “Yes, I suppose it’s possible. I’m not doing well this morning.”
“Who is?” Castiel doesn’t look up from his lore book.
“Cas, you awake over there?”
“Castiel. He’s missing and needs to return to Heaven.”
“Thanks, buddy.” Dean rolls away and groans as he stretches his back against the mattress, rubbing his face on his palms. “How long was I out?”
“It’s happening,” he wheezes. “When Dean awakes… and I’m not here… tell him I’m out searching. And that the Nephilim will be born soon.”
“Think you’d know better by now,” Dean snickers before another long slug of beer.
Castiel goes through his routine in the weight room, occasionally distracted by what Dean is doing. Frankly it’s obnoxious and he doesn’t understand why he can’t focus, normally he fixates on a task like a laser but he feels as if something is forcing him to pay more attention to his captain than he needs to. Dean isn’t even active right now, he’s on injured reserve until his cast comes off, so there’s absolutely no reason why anything he does should be at the forefront of Castiel’s mind.
bitchface. “Cas procrastinating for nine years was the worst, I didn’t think anyone could be as bad at this as him, but you bumped him down a notch somehow.”
” Gabriel looks up and waggles his eyebrows. “You wanna see?”
“Yes. It seemed like the safest option.”
Especially not in defense of Cas (or at least, not since Cas was a child). Cas wants Dean to not be punished for it, for being brave. So he distracts the nurses by sitting on the floor and hugging himself, indicating to them that yes, he’s still having a severe panic attack and they need to help him. (And it’s not even a lie, so he doesn’t feel bad about it.) The situation gets diffused. Raphael signs out and leaves.
At my previous check on my statistics page, I have fourteen people subscribed to this fic... previously I've pretty much only written for small fandoms or rarepairs, and I would get five subscriptions at most. But I also know that Destiel or even SPN in general is a
“Yeah, I know, kiddo. Your feet just gotta learn, that’s all. In a few more weeks you’re gonna be used to it, you won’t even notice anymore.”
He’s not gonna say nothing about it, though. Because even though it’s for players like him, it’s still not for him specifically. It’s for Kevin, their first-round draft pick who’s so excited because his warmup jersey on Pride Night will have his surname in Vietnamese characters. It’s for Cas, who wasn’t allowed to officially and unambiguously come out with his previous team, and who is also going to give an interview talking about being the only autistic NHLer (as far as anyone knows, anyway). It’s for Max, who’s gay and a mixed race person of color, which is practically a unicorn in professional hockey. It’s for Jesse, the very first player in the entire National Hockey League who publicly came out and who had to move five times to avoid the hate crimes for it in the first few years after he did. And it’s for the fans, who just want to enjoy watching a sport without being reminded of how much the rest of the world hates them while they do it. Dean is gay but it’s not for him. It’s for everyone else, because they’re what’s important here.
“You’re right, it isn’t. Dean, it’s not unreasonable for you to still have issues around Chuck, but whether you like it or not he made you this way and there’s no changing it. You can’t fix it because there’s no problem to be fixed in the first place. Sam is aware of it and loves you regardless. Jack would be indifferent if you explained it to him. And your mother…” Cas pauses, clearly thinking. “Mary isn’t John. She won’t hit you or threaten to disown you. It may take some getting used to on her part but she will.”
“You should get to see your progress!”
“Should I be worried?”
And then - then, Sam holds out the feather and hands it to Gabriel.
“Not even tiny harmless pranks? I want to be the fun uncle! Samsquatch will only show her how to read five books per day and make salt shells!”
“Yeah,” Dean mumbles, moving in starts and stops to lie down on one of the beds and wincing at every other motion he makes. “Get pie.”
“Yes, this is true. It confuses me that a Nephilim would be designated as a Prophet, but that’s beside the point.”
“Have you started working on your wedding vows yet, Cassie?”
“Cool. Thanks.” He nods and doesn’t touch it, staring at her. “Why?”
“No, what about him?”
The irony isn’t lost on him that he and all his siblings are named after angels.
“You should introduce me to him sometime, I think I’d get along really well with your dorky little guy,” she grins.
For fifty five days he’s had the room to himself. He doesn’t want to give up half of his safety to a demon, it’s distressing. He wants it to still be SHURLEY and then a blank line underneath.
“You shouldn’t uncover teammates like that. It’s unprofessional and rude.”
“Shut up,” Dean says, stomping off to his kitchen for something to drink.
In only eight days, Cas has been compiling an understanding of Dean Winchester. A severely broken man, yes. An unemployable and non-functioning alcoholic, absolutely. But since yesterday, during the incident with Raphael, Dean has been considerably less… mopey. From this, combined with Dean’s previous comments, Cas has ascertained that Dean functions best when he has something or someone to protect and look after. Cas wonders if all this time what Dean has really needed is a puppy. He also wonders if he should suggest that to Sam in a few minutes.
me, you’re
“Why must you tease me with a good time if you don’t plan on delivering the goods, Cassie?” Crowley’s phone rings in his pocket, interrupting them. He answers it for exactly three seconds. “Mother, not now.” After he hangs up it immediately rings a second time. “Mother. I’m working.
It’s now that he notes a conspicuous absence. “Where’s Sam?”
Dean wasn’t sure he knew how until now. “Are you being good for Aunt Anna?”
“Well he uh. Dammit, take me off speaker!”
Someone bangs on the door to the panic room and Dean tears himself away so he can throw his flannel back on. Having it buttoned like this with no undershirt is a weird feeling, like he put on his boots without socks. He wipes his face on his sleeve and at least when he opens the door it’s only Sammy.
“THAT DOESN’T MATTER” Dean “yells” in huge motions. “DAD WILL KILL ME”
Charlie asks excitedly.
His fingers curl just a little into those collars. He thinks there must be a necktie underneath. A dress shirt and a necktie and a rough coat.
“I’ll remember that for next time. Hopefully Meg doesn’t make fun of me for it too much…”
“I wouldn’t have thought the two activities were in any way comparable,” Castiel says, rolling his eyes and subsequently treating himself to a large swallow of Gatorade.
Then one of the enemy angels looks at Dean, just for a second. And apparently that’s some kinda crime, now, because then Cas zaps over behind him and spears him through the back. The light flares out and Dean covers his eyes in the bend of one arm while reaching into his pocket with his other hand for his knife.
Regardless of how tense he is, Dean does begin to yawn shortly before the credits roll. The tv goes off and Castiel stands up when he does, knowing he isn’t about to relinquish his grasp. It’s at this point that Dean apparently realizes he still has Castiel by the arm, because he has a strange expression on his face.
“What happened to him?”
He chuckles. “Yeah, that was a helluva night.” Then he feels his friend’s distress running up his back. “What is it, Cas?”
Cas does exactly what he said he’d do, retrieving his orange juice from his breakfast tray and opening it. As he’s walking back to his room a nurse stops him.
Dean picks him up with only a quiet grunt of effort and begins carrying him out of the kitchen. Castiel remains rigid enough to make the process easier for his boyfriend, but otherwise feels as though his strength has been completely sapped. He hopes Dean doesn’t ask more questions… he doesn’t have the will to lie any further.
They’re interrupted by a shift in weight in the aisle seat. “Hello, boys.”
It comes to Dean. He skids sharply into a turn so that he won’t just crash headlong into a Tampa D-man, briefly losing the puck but kicking it back onto his stick with the blade of his skate at the last second. His eyes land on a friendly jersey and he passes sideways to Crowley, who hits it to Kevin. Kevin being so shrimpy is a huge advantage here: the kid just zips by two opponents, weaving right between them untouched with a b-line for the net.
Cas nods. “I know.” At least the bastard finally seems like he gets how bad this could’ve been, and how bad it still is that he went down this path at all. “But can I ask what you would’ve done in my place, Dean? I’m not going to try to defend my actions or explain myself anymore except to say that I had to do
Castiel knows already that the Mark doesn’t technically have this effect all by itself. Instead it acts as a siphon, so that whatever lingering negative emotions from despair to vicious savagery are pulled from each victim and into the bearer of the curse. The siphoning effect is more potent with the First Blade, but still happens to some extent with any other weapon as well. But the Mark is also unable to be transferred to anything other than a cognizant being that already has a tendency towards violence. And wreathing Dean’s soul, slowly picking more and more holes into it, are small scraps of random lesser demons and various monsters… as well as larger and more dangerous shards that grab hold to dig deeper, most notably from Abaddon and Cain. To have pieces of two extremely bloodthirsty greater demons latching onto Dean’s soul does nothing short of invite its destruction.
“Okay. Whatever. Now what the hell are we s’posed to be talking about? I wanna get outta here and finish my beer.”
Randomly on the topic of Sabriel - why is it a thing? Don't get me wrong, Gabe is my second favorite character to ship Sam with after Eileen. But in general I consider it a crack ship (they don't interact all that much if you look at it, plus Gabe is seriously not one of the best things to ever happen to the Winchesters until the very end of season 13), and most people take it very seriously. TL;DR, I like them, but just... why? (And no, they will not be appearing as a couple in this fic. Sorry guys. If you want a fic of mine which
“Sure, she’s over in the K section. I’ll holler when it’s time to leave. Don’t go wandering around anywhere else.”
(Kinda. John is God as far as this team is concerned, so Dean isn’t actually at the top of the chain of command here.)
Cas nods and closes his eyes, and he
Castiel steps forward and smacks Sam across the face, as hard as possible without inciting a concussion or a spinal injury.
Cas stares at the paper in his hand, tapping his fingertips on his knee.
“Awesome,” he grumbles, rolling his eyes.
Dean stops moving and glares at him, but mulls that over all the same and eventually nods. “Fine.”
“Dean, I’m tired, can you please get me another sandwich?”
Cas feels warm all over. “Really?”
“Really? I didn’t think that was an option.”
Now Sam just looks utterly baffled. It’s fucking
“What the hell are you talking about? Y’know what, never mind. Let’s wrap your hand then you can sleep this off.”
Is he… is he fucking for real right now? First of all, how does he even know about that, it ain’t like Future-Cas was gonna be stripping in front of them. And second of all, what the fuck. Seriously. Dean pulls his phone outta his pocket and pokes around until he finds the picture he took of the feather before it vanished, then holds it up long enough for Cas to see before stuffing it back into his pants.
“What?”
“Well thanks for bringing me up to speed. It ain’t like I can help from all the way up here, but it’s nice to be kept in the loop,” Bobby chuckles. “Now, I might be dead, but I ain’t stupid, boy. The hell are you stalling for?”
“Yeah, man. I’m done with this gig after the whole thing with Chuck, okay?”
“They’re only dreams,” he says, because he’s sure that’s what’s wrong. “Your mind is trying to hurt you but it can’t actually do anything.” Cas rests his palm on Dean’s back. “I can bring you a soda.”
do you
Dean immediately flicks his lighter and drops it to light the circle of holy oil. He throws his arms out to his sides. “Well? I’m waiting.”
The words leap unbidden to his mind as if he’s hearing them all over again. Castiel strongly suspects that he could come to any point in time where Dean is cognizant, and in every one of those points Dean will always be Dean in the ways that matter. It’s a comforting idea.
“Can I ask something, Dean?”
“Yes. And he doesn’t like me. I have autism and I’m gay, that goes against his natural order of things. Dean, I don’t want to change hospitals again. This one is familiar and the nurses aren’t mean to me.”
“Yes. Regardless of the result, the intent is still kind of you. That’s what I’m thanking you for.”
His sixty fourth day - a moment of truth. Today, Cas does eat his lunch, sitting at a table in the corner with Dean because he feels safer sitting in a corner. He feels safer with Dean in general. He likes Dean.
“Either. Hell, you could get both if you want.”
Castiel can hear the overpowering fear in those words. Dean isn’t threatening further violence, now, but instead stating an inevitability that he’s certain he won’t be able to pull back from a second time.
Mom seems just the tiniest bit fed up with both of them over this. Dean shuts his mouth again and waits.
“I hope you understand how I meant it.”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Okay. I never thought about it that way, but I guess you’re right.”
“I killed him several thousand times and he
“Got it, anything else?”
“I’ll see what I can do. It’ll take some planning and also some convincing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel gets serious, a rarity for him. “How’s your head, bro? I don’t remember the last time I saw you go down that hard.”
“Nothing, it’s not important. Hey, you’re doing your briefing thing for the refugees today, right?”
“Why?” she says again.
“You gotta be fuckin’ kidding me,” Dean snarls. “What, did you miss Heaven’s newsletter or whatever two months ago? Dude fucking melted into a river! How’d you think the chompers got in here from Purgatory in the first fucking place?”
“Thank you.”
“Nope.” He says the word with a deliberate popping noise. “You?”
“I took down a monster,” Dean growls, stuffing his pistol into the back of his jeans. “Because that’s what I do. And I will continue to do that, until…”
“Uh…” Dean makes a face at her. “I guess. Uh. It kinda turns out that way during practice sometimes, too. But it’s got a lot to do with how the rotation shakes out and stuff, me and Benny spend a lotta time with the first line and the fourth line more than the second or checking lines. So uh. So you get more chemistry that way.”
“Dean, for one thing, you’re much prettier than I am,” Cas blurts out before he can stop himself. “And for another thing, yes, it will get better, the bruises will fade and my nose will heal just fine. For a
“Yeah, love you too,” he grins. “Later.”
“We just had one tiny part of a scene left to shoot, they’re doing all the editing and shit now. Sit up and quit hogging.”
Actually that’s not true, he can see himself, but that’s not all that helpful.
Castiel has a broken nose and his teammates are at each other’s throats and Crowley is insufferable. He doesn’t think he can be blamed for the screaming match he gets into with their head coach in the locker room, culminating in him actually standing up and shoving John back a couple of steps. On skates, Castiel is taller than him, and it buys complete silence from everyone until they head back for the start of the 2nd. He’s aware that he’ll probably be a healthy scratch next game, no matter how stupid of a decision it is to bench an A when the team captain is already out on injured reserve.
“It reminds me of when Metatron expelled all the angels from Heaven. Being human took some acclimating and now I need to remember what I learned then.”
None of them are really talking to him after the stunt he tried to pull. Bobby nods and takes the box as Sam works on cracking the second Tablet out of its stone covering. Dean stands rigid in the corner, drinking a beer and glaring.
“Maybe not,” she cuts him off. “But don’t you think life is hard enough already without making this into such a big deal for yourself?”
“Cas-”
“Who?” Cas whispers.
That’s the only thing Dean actually
“Cas.”
“I am, yes. Meg once commented that it would take less food to sustain a herd of elephants than what I consume on an average day.”
Gabe disappears and Sam turns to Dean. “Did you guys get everything set up over there?”
“What the fuck, Cas! You’re seriously just gonna -
“Uh, yeah, okay. Go ahead, Cas.”
Dean’s not a crier, not unless something is incredibly fucking wrong like when his dad got hit by that car, and he doesn’t cry now in the shower even though he kinda wants to. But he is gonna call Charlie tonight, or maybe Bobby, somebody who’s not Sammy and so will actually get it. Because his brother is married and happy and doesn’t need Dean making him miserable over shit he can’t fix.
“Not to sound like your bonehead boyfriend, but Castiel, you’re an incredible dumbass,” Gabriel comments, very unhelpfully. “And - y’know what, no, this is unacceptable! You’re way too smart to do things this stupid! So you’re off screwing the pooch right now, huh?”
“Cas, you have no idea what Dean… he… the only time I ever saw him get like this was when Lucifer stabbed you after Jack was born,” Sam says, very quietly and in a trembling voice. “He… Cas, I’m sorry, believe me. There was nothing I could do to help him, and he was drinking himself to death anyway, on purpose. I looked and looked for a way to get you back but there was just - it wasn’t possible. He was suffering so bad, and… I hated it. I hate myself for it, okay? But there was nothing I could do for him. I didn’t feel like I had a choice. He didn’t want me to save him.”
A snort. “No. It’s not.”
“Good, I’m glad I could help.”
“Okay, so we’ll keep an eye out for living arrangements that’ll let you do that.”
Dean tries really hard to look like he’s watching his laptop and not their hands.
“Hello.” He drinks his orange juice. He doesn’t look at her. He’s afraid to look at the nurses because he doesn’t want to accidentally find out that they’re demons. “I’ve been here fifty seven days.”
Fifty three subscribers! I feel seen but like. in a good way :)
Dean now finds it impossible to trust that Castiel will stay, even if requested. Castiel unflinchingly and intensely hates himself for it.
man in charge now, and part of the reason we lost to Montreal was that you can’t stand up for yourself against John and subsequently nobody takes you seriously.”
anyone says and the permanent frown and the bright, bright blue eyes.
And, as abruptly as he’d arrived at the library, Castiel finds himself standing just inside one of the gates of Hell.
“Hello.”
This was actually not a great choice, apparently. Because Dean kinda assumed that angels thrown by a sigil just teleported someplace else normally like they would with their wings. Turns out - no. No, they don’t. It’s like Dean and Cas get fucking catapulted clear of the panic room and then rocket away at three hundred miles an hour. And even though Dean’s absolutely sure he keeps his grip on Cas the whole time, when he smashes into the ground and very literally breaks every bone in his body Cas somehow makes impact almost fifty feet from him.
“Thank you, Sammy, for making this easier on me and not being a complete dick about it when I already feel bad enough about this as it is,” he yells.
“You’re welcome. I’ve managed to get him to start eating regularly at meal times, I feel this could’ve set him back.”
“You are aware that he’s less than trusting of you. He’s much more likely to pester me.”
“I think. I might have a thing for Cas.” It’s weird trying to come up with the way to mimic that statement with his hands, which Eileen’s eyes are glued to. Dean clears his throat to stall. “But he’s sleeping right now, so I can’t talk to him. And I feel like a dick-” Another thing he can’t really translate to signing. “-because it’s my fault he’s unhappy.”
There’s only so long that Dean can stare at big blocks of words before he zones out and can’t pay attention anymore. As he gets more and more annoyed, his stupid wings start flapping a little bit. And it’s like sweating during exercise, apparently. Even more fucking wing oil dribbles down his back to make fucking sure that his shirt is fucking stuck to him.
