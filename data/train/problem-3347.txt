“I don’t know what to say,” he finally answered to the two angels watching him.
Castiel cocked his head. He wasn’t sure what the words meant, but he got the gist. And he was amazed and amused, despite it all. This human who had every reason to hate him, was giving him a nickname and…teasing him? This man who had just been tortured was trying to make light of his pain?
Castiel smiled genuinely. He watched as Gabriel gave one last deep thrust and yelled, filling Dean’s body with his hot come as well and stilling over the top of Dean, chest heaving and body hot and sweaty with exertion.
Castiel knew that Dean could not have murdered his friend. It was so totally incompatible with what he had seen that it was bedrock knowledge for him. That’s not to say, as Gabriel had mentioned once, that Dean
John knocked back his shot of whiskey, breathing through the burn. The others at the table with him did the same, and it was quiet for a few moments.
“I’m going to spank you, Dean. I think we all are going to enjoy this. Don’t worry, thought, if you don’t enjoy it, we will stop. Tonight is about us reconnecting and your pleasure.”
The beating…well, he’d taken a lot of damage over the years from various supernatural creatures who were trying to kill him, so that kind of pain was nothing new, nothing too scary. Facing an angel, Dean hadn’t been surprised at the strength and power Castiel had been able to bring to bear on him. He knew from the start he was about to get his ass kicked, he just wanted to make sure he got in a few licks of his own – make the angel feel it, even if just a little.  Feeling the angel come down on top of him and push his substantial cock into Dean’s asshole – well, he had a lot of weird crap twisted up in his mind about that. Sure, he’d thought about it over the years, wondered how it would feel – like, there was no way it wouldn’t hurt, right? But, and this was a huge “but” – just the thought of the solid weight of a man on top of him, the muscle and the bone of it, the strength…well, it had always done something to Dean. For Dean. Of course, he’d imagined it the other way around…mostly….
Dean nodded. It wasn’t anything he hadn’t expected, and to be honest, he felt a weird sense of relief. And warmth. While he knew a large portion of the angels’ swift and decisive reaction to what had happened was a result of the threat against their brother, he also felt they were taking care of what was theirs – him. And he hadn’t been taken care of for a long, long time.
A tingling warmth flowed through Dean from his shoulder down his arm and then through his chest and further until his whole body felt it, and the pain eased. It didn’t entirely go away, but it was magnitudes better, and Dean groaned with the relief.
John’s expression softened, just a bit. “I know, son. Last time. Please. Tell me. Start from when I called Dean with the tip.” John had been on a job five states away when he received an anonymous email tip about a werewolf preying on humans not far from their home in South Dakota. Dean had been staying home, resting up a sprained ankle from their last job. Sam had just come back for the summer after his first year away in college in California, keeping his brother company.
Gabriel slowly started to fuck him, pulling nearly all the way out, then pushing deep. It went on for a long time, and Dean got harder but he didn’t get anywhere near coming. Weirdly, the whole experience felt…safe. He didn’t have to do anything, he just had to lay there and take the angel’s cock.
“You remember my name, Pretty?” Gabriel asked softly.
Today the Novaks had been called to a meeting with their brother Raphael, out in the angel quarter. They were going to drop Joshua back at his own house for the duration, but he had wanted to stay with Dean and had won the ensuing argument, surprising Dean. He wondered at their confidence in him, but it also gave him a warm feeling.
The Registrar nodded. “I recognize your claims, Castiel and Gabriel. I See your essence within him. Both of you have penetrated him and filled him with your seed. He is marked as your demonstrated bitch, now and forever.”
Dean flushed and his ears started ringing as he heard Castiel tell everyone within earshot what he’d done to him.
, Castiel,” he repeated.
Gabriel cleaned himself and Dean with a thought, then urged Dean to sit…gingerly…facing him.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice broke through his musings, and he had the feeling Cas had said his name a couple of times.
“Dean, where is Joshua, please?” His eyes met Dean’s green eyes, and he felt…warmth.
“What’s going on? They’re letting you call?”
Gabriel gave a small smile, then it faded, his eyes soft.
Dean was still smiling. “Yeah, well.”
Cas’ whole body relaxed, and a wide smile broke free, full of relief and joy and love. It was miraculous, and it spread warmth and delight throughout Dean, who kept smiling back at him. Suddenly, Cas’ wings manifested, arching huge and black over them both. Dean jumped, but then stared in awe. Cas’ wings spread wide, then slowly, gently came forward to fold around Dean, cocooning the two of them away from the rest of the world. Dean closed his eyes as he felt Cas’ arms pull him into his body, then encircle him with their strength and power, and one hand cupped the back of Dean’s head and guided it down to Cas’ firm chest, and he knew he was where he wanted to be forever.
“There is no way that a being with a soul like yours could have murdered my friend. It’s impossible. Which means that I was wrong. I was wrong, and I was willfully blind to it. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Perhaps we should start with any questions you might have.”
“Yeah, Dean. It was a bitch and a half, but I did convince him to go back, for now.”
“Okay, Dean.”
There was quiet for a few moments as one hunter looked off into the distance, one tapped their fingers, a couple squinted their eyes. After a few moments, the dark-haired woman started to speak.
Castiel came into the room and handed the beers around, keeping one for himself. Dean shifted to sit upright, uncomfortable already, and nobody had said a thing.
“Wars in our home dimension combined with the difficult journey from there to here…it resulted in the fact that not many of us who started the journey completed it. Many of those we lost were our submissives. It left our people…unbalanced. Many have tried to find partners of a like spiritual…bent, …but even if connections are made, they are generally imperfect and at least somewhat unsatisfying. Some have given up trying to find someone; some have known themselves well enough that they have never tried.”
Luke laughed loudly. Smirking, he said, “I bet Castiel and Gabriel aren’t looking at his face much – I bet they have him bent over, legs spread wide for them all the time.”
“I love you, too.” Dean still had a hard time talking about his feelings out loud. He just couldn’t do it. But this, this he could do.
Dean flinched, unable to stop the reflexive movement, but he didn’t back up. He met Castiel’s unblinking gaze and was unable to look away. His heart was beating fast, pounding in his chest, and he started to feel faint. His head went light; he swayed, and then he felt strong arms come around him, holding tight, and a firm chest against his. A hand palmed the back of his head and gently guided it to a solid shoulder. Dean stood stiff for a few moments, totally confused – what even was happening? But then he allowed the warmth of Castiel’s body to enter his awareness and then seep into him. He allowed the strength in the arms holding him to anchor him. He allowed the solidity of the body pressed into his to buoy him up. The tension flowed out of him, and his breathing and heart slowed as he relaxed into Castiel’s embrace.
Gabriel collected his thoughts for a moment. He wanted to give Dean some things to think about without overwhelming him. It was a delicate balance to walk.
Ramiel looked at Dean, nodded, then continued walking past them into the depths of the house.
Eyes wide, Dean looked back and forth between Castiel and Gabriel. They seemed to be pretty serious. There was so much bound up in that statement that he couldn’t deal with it all at the moment. Ignoring the huge and potentially explosive implications for now, he chose to concentrate on the details. He narrowed his eyes, trying to show them he meant business. “Does that mean I’m gonna finally get some answers now?”
“What, Gabriel?” he asked, exasperated. He was busy, trying to get some work done, after having dropped everything for so long to take care of the immediate crisis. They were in the home office. Castiel had been there all day, but Gabriel had only joined him a few minutes ago. Castiel had ignored him, as he was ignoring everyone and everything else in favor of burying himself in work to avoid thinking about Dean. After he had said his piece to Dean three days, 5 hours, and 37 minutes ago, he had left him alone, despite Dean’s earlier words about questions. Castiel couldn’t handle it, not then. If Dean decided he wanted to stay, then they could continue their talk.
Dean smirked at his thought, but the leader, the one Dean had attempted to choke earlier, did not appreciate it, and he threw a hard punch into Dean’s belly. Dean grunted at the impact. He just knew this was not gonna be good.
Castiel was looking into Dean’s eyes again, and it was both nerve-wracking and comforting at the same time. Dean swallowed, then looked down and took a sip of tea, just for something to do.
And he was focused on taking care of Dean. He greeted him in the morning with his regular, “Hello, Dean,” and he asked if he’d slept well. He made sure Dean ate regularly and if he needed anything. He showed Dean the room set up as a gym and encouraged him to use it regularly, “Because you need to take care of your health, Dean.” Dean tried. He ate and slept and worked out hard, and he read. And he thought. He thought about what he wanted and why, and what did that imply about him, and why did it matter anyway? He thought about his family’s reaction to him and his possible choices. He thought about other people’s reactions, and if that
Dean swallowed drily. “So, it wasn’t…” He closed his eyes and lifted his hand to cover his face for a moment, holding on. “It wasn’t the best time of my life, okay? But I need to…not talk about that right now, Sam.” He swallowed again.
“Charlie. What did you find out?” Castiel asked calmly.
“Yeah, okay, Dean, that’s good. Listen, I have something to tell you, too.”
Then this train wreck happened. Once he settled into the house with Castiel and Gabriel, he’d…enjoyed himself. The angels were interesting. The sex was good…and he could see “great” coming up on the horizon. Taking care of them and the house made him feel useful for the time being, although he knew it wouldn’t satisfy him forever. He’d want to get out hunting again. Would they let him work with them? Would they respect him? What the hell was that “marked as your bitch, now and forever” bit? What did that mean? How would they treat him, inside and outside the house? Would it be different? How would the other Novak brothers treat him? And he could he accept it, whatever the answers to those questions were?
“Come on, Dean, we’re done here,” Gabriel said, motioning him to follow Castiel, who had already turned to leave the stage. Dean obeyed, and Gabriel followed behind. They descended the rear steps of the stage and made their way behind the backing wall, to the private access parking lot.
“Gabriel,” Dean said on an indrawn breath.
Castiel nodded. Now that he was no longer blinded by his pain and anger, he knew she was right. Now they just had to find a way to make it right. And maybe find out who had really murdered his friend.
“Hmm.”
He sighed and took another sip of life-giving liquid. He and Sam had come back to the bunker and tried to get into living a normal life, but it felt like they were waiting for the other shoe to drop. They did their chores and searched the papers and the internet for possible cases, but the only possibility they found so far had turned out to be a human monster, and they had called in a tip to the police to take care of it. Dean had to wonder - had Jack taken all the monsters away? Because Cas had talked about how Jack would make the world better. Maybe. Maybe he did. Dean had no clue what he would do, what they would do if that were the case.
In the days after the binding, Gabriel showed Dean what was expected of him – cooking and cleaning for the most part. The Novaks had a large household made up of not only Castiel and Gabriel, but also their currently absent brothers Michael, Luke, and Ramiel. The five of them together were the elite hunter group known as the Novak Brothers. Castiel had started the group with Gabriel’s assistance, years ago, after he had emerged from the insular angel community and learned the trade from Silas.  They had pulled the others into their group after their initial success had led to bigger and tougher jobs, along with the corresponding money, reputation, and power.  Another brother, Raphael, served as their business manager. Their last remaining sibling, Joshua, remained behind in the angel community as he was still a youth.
“We were careful going in, but everything was quiet. No signs of anyone – human or werewolf. Finally, we found a small room on the second level – it was set up like a small apartment, and there was a dead guy there, an older, gray haired guy, looked like he had been stabbed from the quick look we took. We had just started to check out his room when we heard noise from back on the ground level. We went to check it out, and it was the cops.”
“Yeah. Listen, Sam, they know I’m innocent, and they’re going to help prove it.”
He sneaked a look at Castiel again and was ensnared by his eyes, again. Something had definitely changed. “What’s going on?” Dean demanded. He knew he didn’t have any way to force them to answer, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to ask.
Dean felt the man’s heat and presence behind him, then he felt the fingers gently push into him. It felt weird – really weird, but it didn’t hurt. His tense muscles slowly relaxed and then he felt the most amazing thing as those fingers found a spot inside him that made him see stars. He grunted and realized that he was starting to get hard. What the hell?!
“You don’t have to say anything, Dean,” Castiel answered.
It’s been a couple of hours now, and Charlie’s been checking every fifteen minutes or so. She saw Dean and Joshua were still playing cards at the table, and she idly wondered how long could they even do that. She’d never seen Joshua do one thing for so long. She’d met him a few times, and the boy struck her a normal high-energy…. She took a closer look at the camera that focused on the dining area, using the computer to pull the image up to fill the screen.
“That’s a good bitch, Dean, take it, take Gabriel’s cock where it belongs, deep inside you, filling you, showing you what you are. You’re his bitch, Dean, just as you are mine. My beautiful bitch.” Castiel breathed to Dean, his cock swelling impossibly hard .
“I’m gonna be blunt here, Castiel, because we all know you don’t get subtle in personal interactions. Explain to Dean what you thought, what you found out, what you feel, and what you want. Go.” He sat back, leg still kicking idly, gazing at Dean.
“Yeah, dude, I’m totally okay.” Dean’s mind flashed an image of him hanging helplessly, blow after blow falling on him. “I’ll be okay,” he reassured his brother and himself at the same time.
“Yes, Pretty. Those are the names of your superiors. I’m going to fuck you now. I’m going to claim you as my bitch, just like my brother claimed you. All you have to do is relax and take it, Pretty. Just relax and let it happen. I don’t want to hurt you.” As Gabriel talked, he moved until he was between Dean’s legs, nudging them further apart. Dean’s breathing quickened, but he didn’t resist.
, he taught,
If this was having an older brother was like, it was just as well he didn't have one.

the same as having his brother with him. For a moment, he wheezed out his panic as it clenched around his lungs, not having realized how he had grown accustomed to Cas’s constant presence in his life.
His mother’s bright voice settled into her stern mom voice as she said, “You will be there, and you will support your brother. He’s nearly 40. It’s more than time for him to settle down.”
Startled, the kid jumped a bit and cleared his throat anxiously, tucking the sign under his arm, and trying to take the bag from Castiel, only to be held off. “I can manage, thank you…?”
, you’d better cut me some slack, got it, Tweety?”
They should all know what it’s like to have each and every hope and dream you held dear ripped from you (
Mr. Blue Eyes looked Sam over briefly and seemed to come to some conclusion. He smiled politely at Sam and took his hand to shake it.  “Nice to meet you, Sam. My name is Deacon Castiel Novak.”
With iron resolve to keep it together no matter what, Castiel started walking the ten feet to the garage just as a lot of yelling broke out.
She stabbed Balthazar in the naked ass with her nails, causing him to howl and slide out of his chosen omega, even as the kid scrambled out of the way of the now-snarling alpha and the cold woman staring at them. But it didn’t come to down to a fight. She pointed at the sleeping Alpha being carried out, and the guy swore, nodded, and got dressed in a hurry. He scuttled after her as the sound of her stilettos clicked down the hall, and as he slipped through the door, he winked and waved at the stunned brown-haired omega he had just been fucking.
“Hey! It had nothing to do with me! I wasn’t even born when whatever happened on the Russian border happened!”
The big guy was huge, actually inches taller than Dean, and twice as heavy. His initial shock had worn off just in time for Dean to whirl and deal him a left hook that did little than make the guy pause, followed by a hefty kick in the gut Karate-Kid style.

Sam covered his aching nose with a hand and threw Dean another angry look. He then turned back to Castiel, hand still over his nose, and said, “Sorry, Father.”
Crowley smirked. “You were
going to stop them very long!”
But the bird was right. Although he wasn’t feeling all that hot, there was something about Cas’s presence that helped settle his still burning, buzzing center. The bird huffed at being hugged and then shifted into a more comfortable position, allowing himself to be snuggled.
Dean looked pathetically grateful as he took to cleaning up the kitchen. There wasn’t a lot to clean, but from the look of it was better than being stuck with Castiel and Sam’s discussion of religion.
Did he even
Dean half shrugged because she made a good point. “That’s true. But I swear we’re just students. We just want to ask about someone named…” He turned around. “Hey, what was his name again?”
While they spoke, Dean searched for Daniil’s chart, not finding it in the drawer. He started looking around the doctor’s desk. “And then who died?”
She surged forward, her control over her form wavering as she lost power. Her hands transformed into tiger’s paws, and she slashed out with them, barely missing him as Dean blocked with his sword. Again and again, she hacked at him, her anger and desperation burning the air around her.
“I thought you were making a suit,” he asked, staring at the suit and shirt, bewildered.
Dean looked over the sandwich. It was just the way he liked it. He got a mug and poured out some coffee. One sip later and he was frowning because it was exactly like he liked it. He thought about what Gabe had said, and decided it wasn’t worth the effort.
He sees Cas run out and it's a relief that someone who is not the size of a matured live oak is helping him along.
Although Dean’s skills were amazing, Castiel found he had a problem. Even though Castiel tried not to stare and the jean-clad ass—with the small worn holes where Dean kept his wallet, so much lighter in color at the seat—as Dean shifted from one side to the other, making food and plating things, it was
Castiel turned back and finished putting the water and grounds in the machine like he had seen Bobby do so many times now. He flicked the on switch and turned to face Gabriel.
“Well, Katia started to feel ill herself, and, again, it looked like the flu, but… then Anna’s body was found by the river, her throat torn out, her face shredded.” Abram shuddered. “And Ed was found the day after, in the same state, behind the general store, one of his arms missing.”
“Mr. Novak, I have the suit waiting for you as you requested.” Watery gray eyes peered at him from out of dark bags and shaggy brows. The graying curly brown hair and the scruffy full beard did the man no favors. He looked like a mole that was forced up to surface. He looked towards Dean and said, “You must be the young omega. Please come with me.”
“Yeah, like that's not creepy.”
Dean hoped not. His heat would end soon, but then so would his time with Cas.
“Dean,” Cas said suddenly, “Remember? Bobby said that name meant ‘white face’!”
He didn’t
Sam had opened the door and all the windows, panicking at the smoke spiraling off the pan of burning eggs. Dean tried to hide his laughter, but he really couldn’t. He burst out laughing, making Sam snap a glare at him and give him a full-on bitchface #7 (
Sam rubbed his face with his hands and blew out a frustrated sigh. “Okay, so what’s a New-rah-ree-hee-on thing? Explain it.”
followed it, that he found himself separated from Michael.
“First off all,” he replied slowly, petting the back of Castiel’s head as he wheezed wetly into Gabriel's neck. “We get you a new shirt. That one looks like you’ve been battling vampires. And losing. Badly. Second of all, you straighten your back and be proud of your choices. You can control yourself. You’re Castiel, android extraordinaire!”
It was the weekend before Christmas when Michael showed up and decided to take them to a pricey steakhouse. There weren’t a lot of stuffed animal heads or saddles and horseshoes on the walls like Dean had seen in some places. There were no rough wood decorations or peanut shells all over the floors. It was all fancy chandeliers and gold-leaf walls. The round tables actually had cloth tablecloths, the menu was merely one page, all of it à la carte (which he discovered meant he had to order everything separately, meat, sides, and all).
“Your mate.” Gabriel nodded. “I know, kid.”

appreciated he was nearly hip-to-hip with a strange Alpha in a little car being taken somewhere.
He walked out of the church and back towards the rectory, and, as he reached the door, the smell of horny and angry alphas struck his nose. It worried him because it was wafting from where the garage was, and Dean was alone.
Lucifer muttered, raking a hand through his hair. “He’s been so happy lately, too.” He paused and pursed his lips. “I think we should just leave them alone. Let them figure this out.”
He looked over at the other tables, and it looked like they all had woged at the same time. The small tables held like twenty Drang-Zorn. He ducked his eyes again, staring at the table. He wasn't one-hundred-percent certain that it was the eyes that gave away Grimms, but that’s what the lore said. He had never seen Bobby or John’s eyes change, but they had both gone to fancy ass Grimm training as Legacies that told them that, yes, Grimms are identifiable by the dark void littered with stars that woged Wesen saw, that scared them because the void reflected back their true natures.
bad as it could have been. He got off at the ninth floor, shoving past a woman with her head tucked into her sweater neck and eyes glued to her phone, and a bicycle messenger who was chewing his gum too loudly and covering his nose with a sweaty-gloved hand.
Laying with his beloved Basherter, Castiel wondered how much time they would have together. He could not stop himself from dropping kisses on Dean head, listening to the satisfaction in Dean’s released sleepy sighs.
“Seeking out the dead and creeping into houses?” The brothers exchanged looks. Benny leaned forward and said, “That does not sound like much of a life.”
“C-can I come in?” It was cold at 930 am. Dean had been talking about taking him to buy a new coat and gloves (his old ones had ripped and didn’t fit over his now-bigger hands) but it hadn’t happened quite yet and he wasn’t even sure where Dean was going to get the money for it. But with his wrists sticking out and not being able to wear a lot of layers because his coat was a bit small… Sam was definitely freezing his ass off.
“Because it's adorable,” Cas shrugs nonchalantly, “And I enjoyed getting flowers. No one’s ever done that for me before.”
Green eyes snapped over to Bobby. “What’s he talking about Bobby?”
The murmuring got louder, and Akira shushed them by just putting out her hands and making a settling motion with them. “Okay, alright. That means we basically have two days to at least
morning.”
He continued to ignore her, apparently finding something of intense interest by his tail.
“And do NOT fall asleep.”
Then again, it could have been from the last time they made a fire, so it was a toss up whether or not it was an accurate measure.
The twins exchanged wicked looks that Castiel just caught as he lowered his hands.
He bit down lightly at the flesh of Cas’s thigh, and the man arched up again and growled, “Get back up here and show me what I’ve missed, Winchester!”
Dean lets the rich, husky voice lull him, his eyes sliding close as he lets himself imagine Cas singing to him and only him. That there aren't thirty other people around him, watching the beautiful man too. That the end of the day would bring him home to those warm smiles. Those plush pink lips kissing him…
“Happy Holidays!” Came the rousing reply, people hugging each other drunkenly and giggling at pretty much everything.
Both Gabe and Cas had managed to find one of the bodies. She had been stuffed into the cabinet under the sink, and Dean wasn’t exactly sure how she had been missed, what with the pool of blood in the bathroom. The short blond was partially eaten, with long claw marks raking up and through her body. There was a sort of rage about the killing that Dean was willing to bet was missing from the other bodies. He supposed he’d find out later, when someone went to the M.E.’s to examine the victims and try and piece together what they had, if Gabe and Cas couldn’t do it.
Michael chuckled. “Crowley gave it to me with some… persuasion.”
Was anyone going to blame him?
Bobby said in his gruff old man voice, “It’s cursed. Whoever frees the Baku either has to reseal or kill the damned thing or they’ll die in one hundred and eight days.”
The doctor’s office was in a gleaming building that seemed to be more glass than anything else. The lobby was bustling with people in suits, the copper tones and warm colors of the interior supposed to be professional, yet rich and warming. It just made Dean feel severely underdressed and he nearly turned around and left. As it was, the parking garage was expensive and he hoped the doctor’s office would validate and get him off the $20 charge.
In comparison, these alphas smelled like watered-down piss, with the sweaty, druggy overtones that stank sickeningly like patchouli. It felt glued to the back of his throat, and he wanted to cough and hack it out.
In the bedroom, he paused because the stench of sickness and death lingered there, even if the bed had been stripped of its linens. The bed was an old fashioned four-poster bed, and there were several pairs of leather restraints tied to the bed, which made Dean whistle and mutter, “Kinky doctor sex in the house!”
“You’ll know it,” the bead (Itchy-wren?) said.
night, depending on how tough things are that week.
“Is there anything else you need to tell me,” Dean said as he stood, put his utensils on his plate, and carried them to the sink to wash up.
Gabriel. Castiel looked into the mirror and his eyes were burning Alpha red in a way he had never seen before, his skin rippling with the change just under it. He looked murderous and beastly, his incisors having raised blood and stained his lips and teeth. Gabriel was right; a low growl was rumbling darkly out of his chest as he tried to control himself and he had even somehow managed to gouge the sink’s marble counter when he had curled his hands into fists, the white stone already splattered with drops of his blood.
Dean sidestepped him easily, putting out his foot, and the guy tripped, flying forward, his entire weight and momentum meeting the unmoving metal carcass of the Lark with an unnervingly loud
So today, Castiel was reading a theology book in the breakfast nook, just off of the small hothouse his father had had installed last year. This particular hothouse was used almost exclusively for exotic flowers and rare plants, whereas the large greenhouse was used for winter gardening and keeping down the House’s produce costs.
~*~*~*~
Despite his position, he called himself a simple gardener. Castiel loved it and him and was grateful that Father Joshua had chosen to mentor him.
He ground his teeth and stomped back to the house (slipping on the mud and whacking his elbow on a tree), thinking spitefully about how many ways he was going to kill that fucking bird when he got back for worrying him.
Wesen specific. The humans seem okay, or, at least, there’s been no reports of illness from them.”
He changed clothes too, and meandered down to find Dean dozing on the couch, the raven watching him from the desk. Bobby watched the tengu, wondering if Castiel realized he was cooing faintly and swaying just a bit. Bobby had thought that perhaps the bird was carrying a crush on Dean, what with his occasional freak out around the kid. And, heck, tengu were human before they became yōkai, so it wasn’t entirely out of the question that he might harbor some illicit affection for Dean. Of course, Castiel was also a bird, so there wasn’t much he could do about courting Dean, unless there was another transformation he was hiding.
Michael finished up his speech having grasped a flute of champagne from one of the attending elves, and toasted the assembly (one arm around Dean) with a hearty, “Happy Holidays, everyone! May your days be bright!”
Was The Call
When Dean was fourteen, he couldn’t stand Sam’s crying into his pillow with hunger anymore. He couldn’t. John had gone off to find a man guilty of murder and hadn’t returned in a couple of days. They had no money; what they had had gone to the motel room costs, paid in full until the end of the week.
Cas put down the mug, still chuckling, and scooped out a dollop of whipped cream with his finger. Before Dean could react, he stuffed it between Dean’s lips, and followed up with a kiss. Dean tasted of vanilla and cream, and Cas could hardly get enough.
“Is everything alright?”
Lucifer, who was pinning Castiel’s wrists while Gabriel sat on his waist, leered down at him. “Now, Cassy, you know you can’t lie to us.”
Cas tilted his head and a sad amusement oozed off him for a moment, making Dean wonder what he had said. “Indeed, I would like to see you do that.”
“You spoil me, Cas,” he murmured, watching his angel put the cast iron pan in. “But couldn't you have just mojo’d them warm?”
Uh. Hi. Your mentally and emotionally spazzed out writer here. Ah, I know it's been like EONS, but I assure you all that I have been working on this the WHOLE time. No lie. I was just having issues with aspects and then my brain fried and decided I needed an emotional roller coaster that kept going just a BIT too close to the edge, if you catch my drift?
More reluctant grumbling emerged from the burrito, sounding suspiciously like, “It’s too cold and early.”
that girls like to talk about?”
Twin pale faces stared at him owlishly and he sighed. “I’m sorry, the little girl is dead, and her body should not be seen by her family. It would only cause them unnecessary anguish.”
a bit in the last battle they’d had in the dream realm. She was just pure monster to him. Screw that nue.
“You must have had your First Communion and be chosen to serve.” He looked up at Dean with those guileless blue eyes that, for some reason, really pissed him off. He added, “You also have to be under the age of eighteen.”
As they walked to the church a few minutes later, Sam kept looking over at Dean with concerned hazel eyes, sipping on the hot chocolate Dean had bought them from a nearby café.
The fact there was little mechanically wrong and most of it was cosmetic made her a dream job for Dean. He always wanted to fix a car by himself, without Bobby or his Dad hovering over his shoulder. The fact Joshua had already given up on the vehicle made it easy to relax and just throw himself into the job without worrying about ruining it.
As the sun hung low in the sky, the two humans had finished most of the building. The smell of freshly cut and painted wood still floated in the air, stronger than the smell of river mud and recently turned earth. Cas had returned at some point, but he had been deliberately avoiding Dean for some reason.
a pureblood.
“Must be nice to be all smoked up and ready to deal,” Dean grumbled as he applied the balm to his bottom lip and just rolled his lips together. He pointed at the blond dude. “That’s all you’re getting out of me!”
Startled, Cas came back to himself and took a step back, horrified. His claws had emerged and pricked the crying boy.
She screamed as the first sickle cut through her neck deeply, burning easily through her protective hair and half severing her head. The howl was interrupted as the second sickle sliced off her head neatly, the only sound in the alley the hollow thump of her head bouncing off the concrete before the rest of her collapsed into a heap.
Dean blinked at Gabe, not sure he was following, and Gabe smirked. “Never mind, man. You’ll see what I mean. We have dinner in a few hours. Formal dinner. So make sure to dolly up for Mikey, okay?”
“Holy shit!” Dean whimpered at the dark-skinned baby-gnome thing. It mewed and shivered, pulling itself towards them with determination.
Dean shuddered and leaned back into it, his own hand reaching back to dig into the short curls that just touched Cas’s neck. He tugged Cas’s head up to kiss him, and, even from that angle, his mouth slipped perfectly over those puffy pink lips and blossomed into a feud of tongues. Cas’s hand smoothed down Dean’s chest in response, and Dean pushed it down to his waistband, helping Cas unbutton his jeans with fumbling fingers, sliding them off his hips and thighs with a sigh.
Sam fidgeted a bit, averting his gaze, and then, looking at his lap where his hands were knitted together, he mumbled something Dean didn’t catch.
] Well, you can also be
Smiling, Cas pets the ivy again. “I was always suspicious. But then your brother mentioned that your mom gardened and she taught you all sorts of stuff, like meanings, and it made sense.” He hefts the bouquet towards Dean. “Add that they stopped coming while you were in hospital, and it makes perfect sense.”
There were four alphas lounging on the couches, a bevy of omegas swarming over them, giving them massages, complimenting their looks. One of the alphas was dark haired and lean looking, his eyes a nice blue hazel, who was speaking to an older, balding alpha who was not aging well, the bags under his eyes and the weaselly expression on his face genuinely unappealing. There was an alpha with chestnut blonde hair and cold eyes, her nails perfectly manicured, looking out of place in her very expensive-looking business suit, and she was watching the pole dancers like she wanted to skin them. To her side was handsome blond alpha in a V-neck shirt, dark jeans, and snake-skin boots who leered at the dancers, while keeping one of the young male omegas in his lap, his hand roaming over the young man’s waist and legs. Dean was pretty sure the omega’s name was Kenny. Maybe… Lenny?
“It was better than just standing here at the edge of a clearing, watching evil little pixie assholes kill each other over a strip of skin,
(Damn it!
“Doezn’ look too bad,” he finally said, trying to cheer himself up and holding his nose. Indeed, the liquid was just a milky toffee color, like black tea with cream in it, so at least it wasn’t a murky green with human feet bubbling in it. He tried to calm himself with the thought of Conan the Barbarian tossing over a giant vat of foul-smelling milk tea and then he swallowed it down in two gulps, and went pale.
“He means me,” Sam mutters, picking himself up and dusting off his pants.
! You
Blinking, Sam looked up from his laptop. “Is it Cas?”
They walked on a bit, Dale getting heavier and heavier, his longish, dark brown hair falling over his eyes. Mark blew out a tired breath. His stamina was wearing out, and they still had quite a bit to go. It was after 2am but it felt later, and, for some reason, maybe the booze, maybe the exertion, the air felt heavy and thick and he was having problems breathing.
wind.
Balthazar, Dean noted, was not at all abashed. “Naomi, sweetheart, you’ve never stooped to having anyone do anything for you. Isn’t that why you married another alpha? To get ahead?”
“Do you need me?”
“Sam! Stop flailing!”
Dean scowled. “What are you even talking about? What nocturna...whatevers?”
Dean tried to scramble in the direction of the sword, but she stepped between them and roared her conquest, leaping towards him with intentions of shredding him to bits. Dean closed his eyes and cringed back as he was about to get a face full of claws.
Cas finally jumped in and asked, “Um, what about… police?”
Castiel scooted over and looked around the corner of the rectory towards the garage. Standing in the driveway, Dean was wearing a pine-green Henley that was faded and worn to holes at the cuffs and neck over what looked like a black t-shirt and already ruined jeans. The weather was brisk, especially as evening approached, but Dean didn’t look cold. He looked
“Best if you and your boyfriend get back sooner than later.”
When he finally opened his eyes, he found Sam eyeing him warily from his place between Dean and Castiel, arms outstretched. Absently, Castiel could see that Sam’s shirt was a bit too big and probably a hand-me down. It was thin in spots and the collar looked worn. The lanky, thin boy in the hand-me down clothing, was trying to protect his omega brother from the big, bad Alpha.
Sam smiled softly. “Dean, I don’t care about gifts. I mean, if this will make you happy, you should do it. Don’t worry about me.”
Cas started chuckling into his shoulder. “
Dean didn’t give a fuck. Work and private life were two very separate things and he planned to keep them that way. Bastards.
Not really thinking about it, Dean grinned as he scooped Cas out of the chair and hugged him close to his chest, Cas letting out a protesting squawk.
“My father was quite terrifying as a child,” Castiel replied tartly. “You’ve never seen him angry at the twins. I was there when they superglued all his books together, side-by-side, and then put them back into the bookcase. When father tried to pull one out, the whole shelf worth of books fell on him!” He shook his head. “It’s a miracle those two survived to adulthood.”
He was naked, on the ground, with his (ruined) jacket underneath him, and his bones
Clear blue eyes mocked him as Cas carefully stirred a teaspoon of jam into his cup. “It’s delicious,” he said after delicately tasting it.
Dean laughed without humor. “That would be the Winchester training. I guess I should be lucky I didn’t get the Men of Letters Legacy. Sam can take that, for all I care.”
“Don’t worry about it.” He scanned the area a bit more and sighed again, ignoring the stench. “Okay, I’m thinking we can either follow the trail as it leads into the village, or we can go home.”
shut the fuck up! I’m not a…” His mind blanked for a moment, he was so mad. “A fucking
“CASTIEL! Stop right now!”
Through hazy, pheromone-drugged eyes, Dean could see Joshua and a scared-looking Sam next to him. Joshua stalked up to Cas, scowling fiercely, and grabbed his shoulder. Dean cried out as Cas whirled with claws and fangs, his eyes pure red Alpha aggression. Joshua (and Sam) were in danger!
He was so glad it was going to be over, one way or another.
Dean Winchester would not survive long without his luck, and that damned kitsune and tengu were not going to do much about it.
holes. Again, illogical to his mind, but he wasn’t the one wearing them.
He ignored that niggling voice in his head and told them how Cas was fading because of the transfer, and how they were going to have to chase down the Baku because there was
“Hey, your coat!” Dean called after him, taking it off.
Dean turned to look at his little brother for a second, as he pulled a plate out from the cupboard. “Pfft… C’mon, Sammy! I can get up for this.” He set the plate with the egg and two bacon strips on the table and nudged Sam knowingly. “Besides, I don’t want the trailer to burn down. That’s important.”
He spread his hands in front of himself as if he were a magician who had revealed his trick. "That is how his organs came to Barsuki. The
But then, as he strolled in Wednesday evening, there in the waiting area was Michael, larger than life and looking totally like he’d stepped out of GQ in his dark gray suit, elegant tie, and royal blue shirt. He was leaning on the receptionist desk, flirting with Laura, who was blushing hard.
Joshua put his wellies by the side of the door and padded inside, shaking his head in disbelief as he headed to the bedrooms. “You know, I think I’m going to head upstairs and take a quick shower. Don’t burn down the rectory.”
The bird shook its head. “No. Those come to life because of the past owner’s will. Tsukumogami come to life because they have earned it through aging and have become self-aware.” He paused. “I hesitate to use this term, but… you would say they have earned ‘souls.’”
All these things were constant quiet whispers in Castiel’s own head when he thought about Dean. For some reason, it surprised him that his brother was in the same emotional boat, feeling that pull to breed. Perhaps it was part of being an Alpha?
They cleaned up, something that was made easier when they realized Cas’s child-sized bird body was actually stronger than the two of them combined, as he easily hefted one of the pines they were taking home all by himself, something that made Bobby just mutter, “Friggin’ tengu.”
Castiel turned to face Dean with a very serious expression and bowed slightly. “I apologize for my underling’s behavior. He is a very good servant of Buddha, but I fear I allowed him to watch a bit too much human television.”
“When there is enough, I will bring Hell to this earth.”
was so much better.
He stifled his surprise as he realized that he could understand the chant, and watched the umbrella. It writhed under the webbing as Castiel chanted.
Crowley shifted and grinned winningly, slapping him on the ass. “Don’t worry yer pretty little head over that. Smart-looking bird like you… we’ll make a fine killing tonight! Got some real big fish from St. Louis who are doing business in Kansas City and apparently heard that we were the place to visit.” He stepped in closely, reeking of cigars and Beta. “I mean it, green eyes. Reel them in. I want some fat fish for my supper, and yer my bait.”
When they arrived at the church, the parking lot was mostly empty. They knew they needed to go to the rectory and locate someone to ask about becoming an altar boy. When they strolled up and checked the door, it was closed and locked. Dean grinned and said, “Well there you go. Guess God doesn’t want you waiting on him, Sammy. Let’s go grab a burger.”
He slid under the blue guy’s swing at him, and, as he stood, he realized that this wasn’t a guy who was cosplaying as a blueberry. He had horns. Tiny, black horns that stuck out from his scalp and were just visible through his bright, berry-blue hair.
“Dean, you can’t just give up like that! Just because there’s no one in the rectory, that doesn’t mean there’s no one in the building.”
“C-Cas?” Dean manages to gasp out, right before his brother accidentally pokes him in the stitches, causing him to break out into a
Cas straightened up as much as he could, still straddling Dean and nearly bumping his head on the ceiling, and smiled down at Dean.
“I knew,” he jabbers, “And I thought I understood but seeing it—no, no, I've got this! I'm good.”
There were six pirozhki, each on the size of a Hostess fruit pie. In fact, they looked
From out of wherever Cas put his magical gear, he pulled out a
They talked for a while more about requirements, and Castiel set up a time to practice with the boys.
Now, he just needed space to think.
“He’s very stubborn, and he fights me at every turn. It really shouldn’t be as cute as it is.”
When Castiel was young, God had seemed so close, so fulfilling, a shelter from the pettiness of the Novak Family and the constant tricks from his older brothers. Prayer was soothing, the songs at mass relieving and empowering. When he realized at sixteen that he wanted to be as close to God as possible, it never even occurred to him that God, his beloved and omniscient God, might have another plan for him.
What did God want from him?
Dean rolled his eyes. “Not like I wanted this.”
Gabriel teased finger wiggles over Castiel’s ribs, causing Castiel’s breath to hitch. “C’mon, Cassy. We can
Sometimes he just hates his job.
Dean stood up, eyed Bobby in the doorway, and turned his back on the bird. “Two months is nothing, Cas. If I don’t tell him soon, Sammy’s gonna have my head anyway.”
“But?” Cas coaxes.
Sighing, he walked the small path and tried to keep himself from showing he was nervous. These not-dates were getting more and more serious. He really didn’t want to indulge Michael more than he had.
This was bad.
: [CREATURE/FIGURE] Technically, there are very few "daitengu" (great tengu), and King Sōjōbō is one of them. He rules a specific territory and the smaller/younger tengu around him bend to his will. He's familiar if you watch anime or read manga. He's one of the most powerful tengu, so he's mostly in human form.
She pointed at it, making Dean grateful that her fingernails were short and blunt. “What is this doing here?”
And, after the bear-skin had been prepared, the shaman and his friends quietly went to the man's hut and placed the skin under the man's pillow. They hid themselves to see what would happen when the man went to bed. They watched the magic work upon the man, and did nothing, content with their deed. It was as such that, upon waking, the man found that he had become a huge bear with a white face and white feet."
Grinning, Dean said, “He’s pretty bad ass for a beta! I’d love to meet him!”
Bobby broke in and said, “Yeah, but they multiply fast and they’re annoying as hell.”
Sam had also had to reckon the tengu was crushing right back.
“You are the biggest idiot, Cassie.”
When they returned, Gabe took off with Cas, leaving Dean to report to Bobby. Of course, Bobby was not happy. “God damn it! Can’t we get a break?!”
Cas smiled back while that damned heat surged up Dean’s face again. “Can we just get down to business?”
When he woke up the next morning, he found he had received a phone call from Michael, which he ignored, and that he had slept another 12 hours. He crawled out of bed and, finding Sam sleepily eating cereal at the table, he asked, “Do I still stink?”
Dean nodded, and Castiel stood from behind his desk. He had been trying to keep as much distance between himself and the boys as possible, but although he could smell Dean faintly from that distance, passing him was like passing by a patisserie: his scent was fresh and warm and enticing. Castiel had to stop himself from leaning over and just scenting the boy, and it worried him.

Dean tried not to glare, but ignored the palm that had been presented to help him from the car.
Dean swallowed hard, moving on autopilot and pushing tree branches out of their way. “Okay, so she eats a bunch of dreams, she gets a boost from the demons… why
Sam blinked and nodded, and, impulsively, Dean gave him a hug and dropped a kiss on top his head, because he was feeling a bit clingy. Sue him.
“I don’t know what to do, brother,” Castiel whispered hoarsely, trying to hold back his despair. “I don’t know if I can do this.”
“Fifty bucks,” he had said finally, looking the alpha in the eye.
he’s ever going to be taller than me!”
Dean frowned and opened it up, swearing a blue streak at the headline: Four Dead Under Mysterious Circumstances at Local Park.
“Bitch,” he snorted as he closed and locked the door behind him.
His words faltered. He closed his eyes and licked his lips, pressing them together as he visibly tried to pull himself together. “Dean, I have… no right to have feelings for you.”

“OH, holy fuck! It’s true! Cassy, what
Michael slipped into the driver’s seat just as Dean had worked himself into a fine temper. Sniffing delicately, Michael murmured, “Are you okay?”
Gabe popped back into his giant fox form and shook himself, then turned to eye the congregation.
Dean ran his hand over Cas’s jaw and said, “I was complaining about how you hate to get up in the morning and Charlie sent me this poem, and I just remembered that I loved you.”
Liza huffed out a sigh. “I’ll be right there.” She got up and walked to speak to an older couple closer to the window. Yana grinned at them, beautiful in her pink dress, her dark hair lovely and framing her round face. “So… you’re staying for a while,” she asked coyly.
Dean didn’t give a shit what it was called because he was positive it was made up of ground yōkai ass with a sprinkle of ginger, because that was just how his luck (literally) ran. When he gagged, and tried not to vomit afterwards, he managed to choke out his suspicions. She smiled patiently and didn’t deny it, and he eyed the thermos suspiciously while Akira winked at Sam and Bobby.
“I believe we can leave this like so,” Cas said with pleasure in his tone. He seemed to smile, something not readily evident from his beaked face, and Dean realized that, somehow, in the past 48 hours, he was learning to read the bird very well. It was weird.
Cas smiles and sits down across from him. Not that there's a lot of room at the front tables. That’s when Dean notices the club is ridiculously quiet, and he looks around and finds it dark and completely empty.
Akira hated wearing all the crap she was expected to wear as an onmyōji: the sashinuki were okay, because the wide-legged pants were pretty comfortable, but the joē, the ceremonial robe that went over it, make it a pain to move her arm and hands, and she ended up pushing them up her arms a lot while she prepared. Even with the strip of cloth she used to hold back her sleeves, they inevitably got in the way. She also hated the weird fin-like mesh hat called a tate-eboshi, but it was part of the outfit, so she bore with it.
(later Minamoto no Yoshitsune) swordsmanship.
…even if he couldn’t taste it, it was a comforting bit of affection from the beta.
He realized he was thinking in circles, and he did not understand how humans endured it. All these small choices that affected them in the long term, and their "long term" was not even that long. He had more recently understood the concept of mortality, but it was not death that was frightening. It was the choices, the everyday choices. The tiny desires that led them down paths, so many of which led to an early death, each of those tiny connectors to the future that each human had no idea about, only by the grace of his Father and luck.
The campsite was not glorious, but it was not bad. There were fish drying in the sun over a smoking fire. The children were nowhere to be seen, but there were evidence of faded plastic Powerwheels and a very patched over soccer ball. To one side, there was a small cooking area with burners set out, a small pile of various tubers on the table. There was a large RV with a large peeling canopy, under which an old man sat.
Dean’s head whipped around to glare at him, something unfathomable on his face, and he snapped, “How the hell should I know?”
Both Benny and Abram looked at Dean, who shrugged. “He just talks like that.”
, Dean!”

“You’re done with your heat?”
So that evening finds Dean back in the front row of the stage, back to the hair of the dog that bit him.
“Pffft–like eight. Don’t blow it out of proportion,” Dean snickered, running his fingers through the scruff Cas had developed. It was softer than it looked and when he kissed down Dean’s body, it tickled in a good way.
“You got me out of bed and
Cas released a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Behind him, Dean also relaxed a bit. “This is fucking intense,” he huffed, raking a hand through his sweaty hair. “And we still don’t know what that roar was?”
A growl rumbled out of Cas’s mouth, his pupils even redder, his teeth elongating.  He shook his head as if trying to shake out his thoughts. “It’s not that I don’t
He distantly heard Bobby stomping back downstairs, breath coming in a pants, and when he stopped in the doorway, Dean wasn’t very surprised when Bobby said, “God damn it, boy! I told you to be careful up there!”
Pushing past his own reluctance, Cas kept on, Dean’s breathless
“I feel like a damn stripper,” he muttered under his breath. “What is this, Magic Mike?”
She quirked a smile and presented her hand like she expected the back to be kissed. “Bela. Bela Talbot.” She raised her chin and jerked it a tiny bit towards the group talking at the couches. “You may know my half-sister, Naomi? She works with Michael.”
Cas chuckles and gets up to help Sam, and Dean groans inwardly, uncomfortably, at being caught.
Jake’s eyes widened with disbelief and he shook his head. "I bet you didn't think through the terms. Crowley's not letting that kind of cash slip through his fingers lightly."
,” Cas countered. “
In her own defense, she had pulled a large band of hyōsube (the hairier, dirtier,
“Dean, I don't think eating that much fried food is good for you, what with just being released–”
“Who? I’m here alone.” Dean tried for clueless. It wasn’t hard. He really didn’t have any idea what was going on here. Why would some humans be after an angel child? It was nearly suicide, as far as Dean could tell. He knew the Novaks would destroy anyone who hurt their brother, not to mention what the larger angel community and maybe even the rest of the supernatural community would do if humans injured or killed an angel child.
“You tell them, and you be careful, Dean,” John ordered.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “In his office, of course.” He had kept trying to get Castiel to use Dean, to no avail. Castiel had holed up in his office and bedroom, alternately, for the entire week before their brothers returned from the Banshee job they had just completed.
It was Gabriel, of course, who broke the silence. “How ya feeling, Deano?” His usual smirk played over his face, but his eyes were warm and concerned.
Gabriel nodded, “Least we could do. You saved our brother’s life.”
Castiel inhaled sharply and smiled, pleasure spiking hard. “Yes…perfect, Dean, thank you, I appreciate that,” he said, giving Dean the positive reinforcement he needed. He sped up, punching into Dean harder. He wouldn’t last much longer, even if he had just come a few minutes ago. Hearing Dean admit that - it was too much. He grunted and came again, spurting into Dean again. He gave himself a minute to rest, then pulled out and gently turned Dean over. He smiled down at him and then moved to take his cock in his mouth and suck hard. Dean shouted in surprise and overwhelming pleasure and came just a few seconds later.
John starts investigating...Dean is still confused but not hating life...Gabriel has plans
Dean nodded. Yeah, he wanted to know this shit, for sure.
That left getting fucked, to put it bluntly. And truth be told, although he was frustrated as all hell, since Gabriel hadn’t been letting him come, he…well, he liked it. He found it barely possible to admit to himself, but it was the truth. Yeah, he was a normal guy growing up – he’d had his share of hookups with women, plus a couple of relationships, although nothing really serious. He’d looked at his fair share of guys, too, but he’d never taken that step. It had just seemed to involve too much baggage to be worth the novelty, so his curiosity had never gone further than the occasional glance and a fleeting thought.
Hearing of Silas’ death had hit Castiel hard. He had never lost someone so close to him. As a hunter, it was not entirely unexpected, but still – and to a human? The utter uselessness of it, the waste of the such a good man had torn a hole in Castiel. Watching the trial day after day, hearing the prosecution claim that the human had hated all magical races, that he had set a trap for a werewolf, that he had murdered that werewolf, it had enraged Castiel – that a human could wipe away all that Silas had been, all the good he had done, in ignorance and hate. He had wanted, no, needed, to see the human punished. The defense tried to claim that Winchester had been tracking a rogue werewolf who had killed several humans in the last couple of weeks before the incident, and that the evidence led him to Silas. They claimed that Winchester had found Silas already dead.
matter to him and if so, why? And should it? Could he choose to not care about what anyone else would think? Was he that strong? And if he was that strong, why did he want what he wanted?
As both of their hearts and breathing settled back down, Gabriel eyed the turbulent swirls of Dean’s energy, and thought he should try to smooth it out just a little bit. Not with his magic – no, that wouldn’t be a good idea at all at this point. Dean was settling into life at the Novak household pretty well. He had their schedules down and was keeping up with his chores, with no issues or rebellion.  He also submitted to Gabriel’s cock every day – but that was not so easy for him. Perhaps just a little nudge here would help.
“Gabriel is smart and funny and a bit of an asshole, but I like him, Sam. And Castiel is…he’s got this…he’s got this *presence*, and he wants to do what’s right, and he’s funny, too, but in the driest, snarkiest way.”
Gabriel sighed. He surveyed the confused young human and explained. “You know about State Labor and Restricted Labor?”
“Hey, Dad,” Dean said into the phone, trying for nonchalance and missing by a mile. During the meeting with Charlie, they had determined that their first step would be to connect Charlie with John so she could get the raw data straight from the source. Only there was no way John would talk to Charlie – a Novak employee – without good reason. Castiel had insisted Dean make the call in private, not that Dean fought him on that, and so Dean found himself perched uncomfortably on Castiel’s bed, phone in hand.
“Sam’s gonna be so much better, now, that’s for sure.” Dean could hear the smile in John’s voice.
The truth is revealed and the fallout begins
“And you’re really okay? I mean, that sounds like….” Dean could actually hear his little brother swallow.
He had been so…locked in, so walled up, before Castiel. Over the years they’d grown closer, Dean had allowed his defenses to recede, not overall, no, that would probably never happen, but as the walls fell between him and Cas, there was also room for others, slowly and gradually. Cas had saved him from hell all those years ago, and he kept saving him, every freaking day.
“I don’t think he did.”
There was another awkward silence until finally Gabriel broke it. “Ooookay then, people. Let’s get this party started.” He turned to Castiel.
“But it’s okay, I mean, he doesn’t need…. I don’t need….” Dean bit his lip. He abandoned that thought.
Castiel cocked his head. He hadn’t intended this part of the conversation until after Dean was freed, but he could see that Dean’s current reaction was not the relief and happiness he had anticipated. Sometimes he had a hard time interacting with humans. He wasn’t the best at interpreting their facial expressions or body language, certainly not as good as Gabriel was. Very well.
“Let me complicate that a little bit for you.” Gabriel smiled at the snort Dean let out. “That percentage does not correlate with…importance, or…significance.” He was trying to be very careful here.
Dean cocked his head toward the door, hearing some odd scratching sounds. He got up and went over to the monitor near the door. He saw three human-appearing men huddled close to the door. One appeared to be fiddling with the door knob, the other two were looking in opposite directions down the street. Oh, this cannot be good, Dean thought.
Well, his dad hadn’t raised him to be a coward.
Dean watched the two together and couldn’t help but think of him and Sam. He missed his brother. He missed his familiar life. He missed his freedom. The sudden sense of loss washed over him, and he swallowed hard, trying to let it sweep over him and not push him under. He had no time for this, not here and now, anyway.
Dean was truly beautiful, especially now that they had cleaned the worst of the blood off of him, and Gabriel had eased his injuries. He remembered the sight of his brother mounting him, fucking him, filling him with his come, and Gabriel was suddenly rock hard again. The young man was naked and defenseless in front of him, and Gabriel couldn’t resist anymore.
“Dean! Oh my God, Dean! Are you okay? Where are you? How are you calling me?” Dean smiled into the phone at the rapid-fire questions in a voice that went from total shock to total relief and then back to land on a combination of stress and warmth.
Buried full-length in the young man’s tight asshole, his balls pressed firmly against his firm round buttocks, Castiel turned to look at the magistrate. “Witness, if you please, Magistrate. I’ve taken Dean Winchester as my bitch.”
“Except he had heard of John Winchester, and, as he told me so earnestly, that human had a solid, profession reputation. He thought I must be wrong, when I told him Winchester was next. I tried to convince him otherwise, but unfortunately, he got suspicious, and when he got suspicious of Winchester, he started to think back to the others. You can see that I had no choice, Castiel. I had to keep him from trying to interfere in my business. So I had another werewolf associate of mine make a couple of messy kills near Browne’s warehouse and sent Winchester a tip. I was monitoring the town, of course, so I knew when a hunter arrived and started asking questions. I knew it wouldn’t be long until the hunter went to the warehouse, so I went there first and took care of Browne, then waited.”
Castiel set down his tea carefully then stood and moved toward Dean. He didn’t appear to rush, but one moment he was at the table and the next he stood close to Dean, too close.
Dean nodded, and Gabriel gave him a small nod of encouragement back. “There is one more category of Labor called Unrestricted Labor. It used to be common, but it has fallen into a bit of disfavor in the last, oh, hundred years or so.” Gabriel pursed his lips, looking off to the right as if trying to think of the right way to explain.
“Huh.”
The beating started. They took turns, alternating their blows with questions. Dean didn’t respond to either. They struck him from the front, then they moved to the back, then the front again. There wasn’t a lot of room to get at his sides, but that still left a lot of vulnerable, painful territory for them to pound. Dean’s attention wavered and faded as he slipped into straight suffering. He knew he just has to hold on long enough…but fuck, why, why is it taking so long! Where are his fucking angels?! Then coherent thought began to take too much effort, and all he could do was endure.
“Look, we don’t want to hurt a human, but we will if we have to. Just tell us where he is, and we’ll take him and leave.” It was Curly this time, trying for reason maybe.
“Yeah.”
Castiel got in the front seat of their nondescript sedan, while Gabriel followed Dean into the back seat, to both of their surprise. Gabriel smirked at Castiel’s look, and he reached down with one hand to gently grasp Dean’s cock. Dean flinched and inhaled sharply, but slowly relaxed as Gabriel did nothing more than hold on.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Dean shivered, his stomach dropping.
The next day, a couple of hours after lunch, Dean was called to the door by Gabriel.
He looked back at Gabriel, abruptly realizing where this whole explanation was going. Gabriel was about to fuck him too.
“Cas?” Dean was confused, but his body was lax and trusting.
Castiel reached for the glass of water he had ready on the table nearby and held it for Dean to drink. He would take care of him from now on. He nodded his head at Gabriel, and he urged Dean to his feet then across the room to the bed. He sat down and turned and pulled a confused Dean until he lay across Castiel’s lap, his firm ass perfectly placed for what was coming next.
Sam must have heard that moment of weakness, because he said, concerned, “Dean?”
Gabriel laughed at the look of frustrated bafflement on Dean’s face. “During the trial, Castiel wanted nothing more than to see you punished for killing his friend – a righteous punishment for an evil act. And then, when we saw you at the jail – you were so cocky, Dean, with that maddening little smirk of yours – Castiel gave in to his instincts. He proved his dominance over you, and that gave him the biggest kick, I can’t even tell you. I know, because I felt it, too, of course, when I mounted and fucked you.” Gabriel gave him a sly but good-humored grin.
Dean makes his decision.
Sam paused to gulp some water, then continued. “It all checked out. The sheriff’s department gave us copies of the reports; the families confirmed the details. We went out to the abandoned warehouse he was supposed to be holed up in.”
Dean blinked, and then swallowed. “Yeah, please” he managed to get out, just loud enough, he judged. Fuck. It was happening right the fuck now.
Dean heard more wood smashing downstairs, muted now, and too soon, he heard the door to Castiel’s room smash open, close and violent. He tried to keep his heartrate and breathing slow, trying to hear what was going on, trying to anticipate. He felt the closet door open more than anything, some weird sense of space and air where there had been none. Movement near him, then a hard impact fell on his thigh where he lay curled protectively.
John sighed out a long breath, thinking. It was pretty clear that it had been a trap meant for him, or him and Dean both. Sam had been an unexpected addition to the situation, since he had been out of the picture for nearly a year. Three things stood out for him. One, who sent the tip, why, and how did they know him? Two, why did the police show up when and where they did? And three, who killed the werewolf? He knew it all was likely to be related, but it helped him to pull out the threads.
The brothers came back to the house in short order, one after the other, until they all sat around the living room, waiting. Castiel continued working in the kitchen until the doorbell rang, and he ushered Charlie in and took a seat himself.
Dean took another sip of tea, just to gave something to do while his mind tried to shift into gear. He looked at Gabriel, too uncomfortable with Castiel’s sudden intensity. “What happens next?”
He looked over to Cas and his beautiful, strong profile, and he felt a wave of love for the man sitting next to him in Baby. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, had done so much for him, for them. And in the end, he chose to become human so he could spend a lifetime with Dean. It humbled and amazed him, each and every time it crossed his mind.
He cocked his head, shaking it gently. “Killing the werewolf did make a bit of noise. Someone must have heard something they shouldn’t have. Anyway, I was not able to get to both humans quickly enough for my comfort, so I simply dropped the knife and flew away.”
Gabriel saw the sudden realization on Dean’s face, and his cock started harden again. It had softened somewhat during the trip from the jail to their house. His strong initial reaction to seeing Castiel dominate and fuck Dean had faded as he realized how injured the young human was. They had settled Dean in the small room prepared for him, and Gabriel had argued with Castiel about letting him rest for the night first. But Castiel had been right. It would be better to get this done now, then let him recover the rest of the night before they took him to the Registrar tomorrow for the binding and marking.
“Yeah, okay, Dean. Just – you can always come out to California, you know? If you don’t want to stay with Castiel or Dad, you can come out here. If you want, I’d like it, too, you know?”
The young human had to know that he had no real chance against the strength of an angel, but that didn’t stop him from trying. Castiel moved with the punches, absorbing the lightning fast blows that kept coming for a few minutes that felt like forever to those watching, and the magistrate shifted uneasily until he caught Gabriel’s shake of the head.
“Eileen?”
“Yes. You and Sam…all the hunters are free, now.”
Dean let out a surprised laugh, “Yeah, no. This guy – he…. No, he’s not lying.” Dean blinked, nonplussed, because as cynical as he was, that thought had never even crossed his mind. And he didn’t have to think about it now, either.
Upstairs now, he kept running and closing doors. He heard the smashing of wood coming from downstairs and knew he was out of time. He darted into the master bedroom, closing and locking the door, then into the walk-in closet. Fuck, what the fuck! Everything was hung up and tidy! He should have gone into Gabriel’s room, he bet that guy had clothes lying everywhere! Dean grabbed clothes off hangers and sheets and bedding off shelves and tossed it, trying to make it look somewhat normal messy, whatever that meant, and buried himself into the resulting pile. It was ridiculous, but it was all he had now. He wanted to be hidden, slow these guys up, but he needed to be easier to find than Joshua.
Castiel looked at him this time, but he didn’t say anything.
Dean was silent for a long while, then admitted, “and that’s all crap. Well, it’s true, but it’s still a bunch of crap.”
He looked away from Castiel for a moment, then back. “Well, Castiel, are you ready for the next job I have lined up for Novak Brothers?”
Sam and Eileen and the girls had left for Jody’s yesterday and spent the night in a rental cabin near them. He and Cas had their own cabin next to theirs at the lake for the next three days. He couldn’t wait to see them all and play with his nieces. They didn’t live far from Cas and Dean, but…fucking Covid. Everyone had gotten both of their vaccines a couple of months ago, and the rate of infection had dropped off a cliff, so they could finally have this. Dean absolutely couldn’t wait.
Gabriel started to fuck him, slowly at first, then he picked up the tempo until he was slamming into Dean over and over, fucking him deeply, driving all thought from his mind.
The next few days passed excruciatingly slowly, for Dean. Gabriel was mostly out of the house on his own mysterious business, blowing in and out with a rush of energy and words -
On some few occasions, if a convict had committed a crime against a person instead of against the state, the victim could place a claim on his or her labor if he or she desired and could support and maintain the convict. Restricted Laborers in this situation had to be approved and were monitored for appropriate obedience, work performance, and safety by the city Labor Magistrate’s Office.  RL’s owed their labor to their assignees (unofficially known as their owners), but they could only be punished for infractions by the Magistrate’s Office after a hearing. RL’s still had rights and protections.
Little by little Dean had found himself gravitating toward Castiel. Castiel would often be found in the kitchen or living room, mostly working on his computer or studying papers. Dean would sit close, but not too close, and watch for a while, but he usually ended up falling asleep. He wasn’t sleeping well at night – too much was going through his mind, but once he found himself in Castiel’s presence for any length of time, he relaxed, the hum quieted, and he fell asleep.
Dean felt his face flush hotly at Luke’s comment, but he kept his gaze up. He wasn’t about to let this guy get to him like that.
“Maybe,” Castiel answered, his smile growing and becoming warm, feeling relief move through him. It was only a start, but it was a good one. Dean hadn’t rejected him out of hand, and he felt confident enough to demand answers. The young man was showing himself to be a force to be reckoned with.
There was a taut silence as Dean waited, holding his breath.
Dean stiffened and his breath stopped for a second before it started up again. He wasn’t sure where this was going, but he really doubted it could be a good place. “Uh, angels…don’t have a sexual preference?”
“Um…in the bathroom? There’s a little storage area….”
“Oh, no.” Dean looked at Castiel, then over to Gabriel, who was smiling a bit, and kicking his leg rhythmically.
Cas’s smile grew wide. Dean could feel the love and the happiness emanating from his husband, and he returned the smile, then turned back to the road, tapping his fingers to the music. They’d be there soon. Their family was waiting for them.
Dean’s belly jumped at the praise, and his cock started to plump up a little bit more. He liked knowing he was giving Cas pleasure, even if he didn’t know what the hell he was doing.
“Why, Raphael?” Castiel stood in front of Raphael’s desk. He was alone. His brothers had wanted to come in with him, but this was his firm. This was his responsibility. Gabriel waited at home with Dean, and the others waited in his own office.
Dean had been in contact with his family, but John was halfway across the country, still trying to track hunter deaths and working intermittently, and Sam was in school, so he hadn’t been able to see either one yet. One family member had made it to the court though – Bobby Singer. Seeing the two of them hug briefly, desperately, gruffly, had made Castiel happy. He resolved to do everything he could to help Dean stay close to his family, however it was made. Bobby had asked if Dean wanted to come stay with him. Dean had looked at Castiel for a minute, then answered, “Not right now. Maybe later.” Tentative warmth spread throughout Castiel. He hadn’t been sure, but now he knew that Dean was going to give him a chance to convince him to stay. It was up to him to make the most of it. And he would.
Gabriel nodded, “Good. Now here’s the tough part. I know you’re hurting, but we gotta get this part done. Castiel already claimed you, but since you belong to both of us, I need to claim you too. We have to take you to the Registrar tomorrow, and he will be able to tell if I haven’t.”  His hand came down to rest on Dean’s shoulder, holding gently but firmly through his reflexive flinch.
There was a moment of utter silence, broken by a deep indrawn breath. “Jesus. All right. Good. Good.”
“Those who attacked you are dead, Deano, and the rest of the group has been taken into custody. This won’t happen again,” Gabriel added.
Dean was off balance and ashamed. He had spent his whole life being trained by his father to be a strong, aggressive, dominant hunter of evil, and here he was standing in front of the whole community, being presented as a bitch. Everyone here knew he had taken these angels’ cocks up his ass. Everyone here knew that he was going to keep taking cock every day for the next five years, and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.
Gabriel had stopped at that, highly unsatisfactory point for Dean. A few things had settled in his mind, but Gabriel’s ‘angel class’ had raised even more questions for him, questions that Gabriel had already said he wouldn’t answer – yet.
“I choose you, Cas.”
He wasn’t sure it was a great idea to bring this up now, but then again, he wasn’t sure there’d ever be a good time to talk about this with his brother. But he had to talk about it to someone. “They want me to stay. After.”
Her job was to assist the Novaks – well, it was, even if she mostly – okay, totally – ended up assisting Castiel alone because the others really didn’t have too much to do with humans. She ran the office and everything associated with it and did pretty much anything else Castiel needed help with. So – keeping an eye on the house.
Dean blinked and looked at Gabriel too.
“So, you know, since you left, Dad has been going off on his own hunts a lot. Or sending me off on my own hunts.” Dean stopped, waiting for he didn’t know what – acknowledgement maybe.
Gabriel cocked his head. “Castiel, that boy is not a murderer. You would know that if you just looked, but you don’t want to for some reason.”
Just then the other brothers rushed into the room, taking in the situation with a glance.
Gabriel saw that Dean was struggling with it. It was to be expected, after all. A young human who had no experience in that way, who had been brought up to act dominant, to be dominant, had no frame of reference for this, unfortunately. It was up to them, Gabriel and Castiel, to show Dean the way, to show him that his pleasure lay in serving them, in submitting to them. That he was made to be their bitch. Gabriel had recognized it the instant he saw Dean in that cell.
“So, what’s up, guys?” Charlie asked. “Dean, I’m glad to see you’re okay, by the way,” she added.
“And Dean?”
They hung up a few minutes later, and Dean sat there for a bit, letting it all settle. Dad was caught up – well, mostly - and would talk to Charlie. Sam was caught up. Now he just had to wait and see what Charlie could come up with. It wasn’t his best thing, but he didn’t have a choice. And in the meantime – he had to work on what the hell was going on between the three of them and why Dean wasn’t running for the hills.
“This is awkward.”
“And now we come to you. And Castiel.” Gabriel smiled at the involuntary jolt that shook Dean.
Turning back to the waiting young man, Castiel slowly and deliberately approached him, stopping a couple of feet away. This close, he could feel the younger man’s body heat. Castiel was a bit shorter than the young man, but his solid presence more than made up for it.
“How did I miss this?” Castiel asked Gabriel plaintively, his gaze still, always, on Dean’s unmoving form. He had pulled his grace back from Dean and veiled his Sight from the Spiritual plane, so he saw only physical reality right now, but he would never -could never- forget the glory of Dean’s soul. He found it difficult not to keep taking a peek at it, but it was too distracting. He needed to think, not be entranced by...well, Dean.
Trying to maintain iron control of his fear, Castiel took a deep breath and approached Dean. He hadn’t been able to really look at the man for days. He had been so confused about what he thought and felt about this human that he hadn’t known what to do. He had wanted to figure it out before he proceeded, and he kind of got stuck doing nothing. Now he was here, facing a bloody and beaten Dean yet again. This time, he felt no triumph, no pleasure in his pain – he only felt an ugly sickness in his belly.
Dean’s head jerked, and he slowly picked it up off his chest. His eyelids flickered and a glimmer of green shown through. His mouth quirked up in a barely-there smile, and he muttered, “nick of time, Cas.”
“You think he could be in danger?” Bobby asked, concerned.
“I am not a natural healer, as Gabriel is. When I helped him heal you, I had to let my grace touch your soul in order to hold you here,” he explained.
Gabriel came up behind him and between the two of them they helped him pull his clothes off, then settle back down on his knees for Cas. Gabriel remained behind him, naked and hard himself. Dean felt gentle hands pull his buttocks apart and a lubed finger entered him, getting him ready for a cock.
“They convicted him on hearsay and dubious evidence.”
Dean flushed at the knowledge that Cas had heard everything he’d prayed, both the words and the feelings he hadn’t been able to put into words…yet. He was glad though, so glad that Cas knew. He knew that didn’t get him off the hook to actually say those things, though, and to be honest, he wanted to.
“Where’s Castiel?” Michael asked, shifting his gaze from Dean to Gabriel.
Dean felt the prickle of tears and willed them back, breathing through the urge. He had tried not to think about this, because there was nothing he could do about it, but it seemed he was doing this now, after all. The fact was, he loved Cas, too. He had known it for a long time. He couldn’t pinpoint when it had happened, but then again, it didn’t really matter. And he had tried to call him brother and family time and again, and while it was true to a certain degree, it was also true that the feelings he had for Cas were not the same as the feelings he had for Sam.
“So that’s one…point…for you to think about. It does relate to what you said about angels not having a sexual preference – if you look at the 95%/5% split, you can see that the physical form does not have as great an impact on us as the spiritual form. So yes, we do not generally have a physical sexual preference.”
Dean woke suddenly, his body assaulting him with messages of pain from everywhere. He breathed through it, trying to keep from exacerbating the pain and failing. As young as he was, he had a lot of experience dealing with pain, but this was next level. All of his nerve endings were screaming their distress, and he slowly forced it back enough to turn his attention back to the outer world.
Dean swallowed heavily. “How’s Sam?”
“Jack took the monsters off the board?” he asked.
Gabriel shook his head, giving Luke a chiding look. “You know that’s not how it works, brother. He owes his service to me and Castiel, not to any of you.” He was speaking to them both, Dean knew, and the knot in his belly slowly relaxed a little.
Dean believed him. He believed Cas would help him do whatever he chose to do, now that he was free. This moment was an inflection point in Dean’s life, and what he chose now would either send him back to the life he had always known, maybe with a little bit extra knowledge and life experience, he acknowledged to himself with an internal smirk, or it would take him into a new life – a life with Cas, a life of service, of submission. Of love.
“Yes, Dean.” Cas looked at him, all gorgeous, soft blue eyes and smile.
“Castiel has never found a partner.  Until now.”
Dean half laughed through the last of his tears. “Yeah, you were right, you can totally gloat.” He looked at Cas, unable to look away, unable to believe that he was really there, really back. “Cas…”
Pulling Dean over his shoulder, he stood up and asked Gabriel, “Can you get his clothes?”
Castiel swallowed. Gabriel was an exceptional healer. If he needed Castiel’s help…. He didn’t know exactly what had happened here, but he could guess that Dean had protected Joshua with everything he had, maybe a little bit more. He owed Dean his little brother’s life. After everything that had happened to him…after everything Castiel had done to him…Dean had still saved an angel’s life. He knew he would have a lot to think about soon, but first, he had to help Gabriel save Dean.
“You got that right, Boss-man,” Charlie declared, raising her hand for a high-five from Dean.
The Registrar turned her eyes back to Dean. “The binding will be done. Please hold him, gentlemen.”
He waited until Sam ran down, then said, “I don’t have all the answers yet, Sam. Let me do one thing at a time.”
“Good boy.” Dean closed the panel, making sure it fit but wasn’t airtight. He felt time running out, and he had to get away from Joshua’s hiding spot, now. He had no idea what was going on, but he figured better safe than sorry. If these guys turned out to be repairmen or something, then he’d be embarrassed, but he knew deep down humans breaking into an angel’s house meant nothing good.
“I have arranged for a copy of the trial transcript to be sent to my assistant, Charlie. She is our office manager and an expert in all things electronic. She will attempt to trace where the initial email that was sent to your father came from. It is my intention to see you cleared and free again, as soon as I can.”
He remembered.
Sam and Dean had given up active hunting. While the spirit was willing, their bodies just couldn’t do it as well anymore. They had decided to get out of the bunker and find some windows, since there were no organized monsters anymore. No plots and big bads trying to find them and kill them all the time. They could afford to get back to the real world. They had found out by accident that their records were clean again and they had absolutely obscene amounts of money - they had to believe it was one last favor courtesy of Jack.
“I’m okay, Dad. I’m still with the Novaks.”
Gabriel watched Castiel turn his back to him and rolled his eyes with exasperation. His little brother was so smart in some ways, but once he made his mind up it would take a sledgehammer to get him to change it. Well, he had planted the ideas he wanted Castiel to think about, anyway, and that was what all he wanted.
“…what?”
“Is it…an actual possibility? I mean, is Castiel interested, or…?”
Gabriel nodded and went to sweep up the discarded clothing. His dick was hard as a rock after watching his brother mount their new bitch, but he knew it would be better to wait until they got him back to the house to take his turn between the boy’s legs. He could wait.
All at once he couldn’t wait any longer, and he moved, slowly pushing his engorged cock into the young human. Dean took a quick breath, and Gabriel shushed him.
The Registrar looked at him. She wasn’t smiling, but it wasn’t a cold look, either. She turned her head to look at Castiel. “State your claim, Castiel.”
Gabriel smiled down at Joshua. “Fair enough.  I am glad you came to visit. Joshua, this is Dean, he belongs to me and Castiel now.  He has his own duties, so don’t bother him, alright? Come to me or Castiel if you need something.”
One thing that had become clear to him was that Gabriel was strongly implying that Dean was filling the role of the submissive for both of the angels, but he also seemed to be saying that while Gabriel enjoyed himself (obviously), Castiel might have…. Dean didn’t even know how to finish that sentence. Castiel might have enjoyed himself more? Might have been more attracted to Dean than he wanted to be? Might have been more satisfied than he wanted to be? He just didn’t know quite what Gabriel was going for there.
“Did you find out what the hell those guys were after? I mean, there’s no way they coulda thought they’d get away with kidnapping an angel kid?” Dean asked Gabriel.
Finally, Gabriel pushed deep and came with a long, drawn-out groan, his semen spurting rhythmically into Dean, hot and slippery. Gabriel rested on top of him for several minutes, his breathing and heart slowing down, then he gently pulled away, not far, just enough to shift his weight off of the young man. His belly warmed a bit with pleasure as he saw traces of his come marking Dean, spilling out of him.
Anger and pain simmered in him, and Castiel had finally thought of a way to begin to let it out. He would claim Winchester as Unrestricted Labor. As one of Silas’s heirs, along with Gabriel, they could claim him. And Castiel would find out the truth, and along the way, he would punish and teach the human in whatever ratio he had to, in order to make this pain fade.
“Hello?” Sam’s voice was quizzical. It was hit or miss whether any of the Winchesters would answer an unknown phone number, but Sam’s curiosity must have won out in the end. Dean guessed he was glad. No, he *was* glad. He wanted to talk to Sammy, needed to. It was just going to be hard, navigating the tricky figurative land mines.
“Yeah, Cas?” he asked.
“Yeah. Yeah, they’re letting me call. They believe me, Dad. They believe I’m innocent.”
along with Dad – well, it eased a wound he hadn’t allowed himself to realize was there.
Gabriel nodded his head toward Dean,who had just poked his head into the open office door.
Dean lay sprawled out on the couch, watching the big screen television that it seemed no one else ever did. Well, he wasn’t about to let something this glorious go to waste. Things had settled down mostly, but now…now he was waiting for the big reveal. Or whatever. He still really didn’t know what the hell was gonna happen. He didn’t know what he wanted, much less what Castiel - or Gabriel - wanted. After a lot of going around and around with it all in his head, he’d come to the conclusion that he had wait for Castiel to lay it out for him before he could make heads or tails of it. Thus his epic binge of all things television.
Charlie perched on the edge of an armchair and nervously said, “Hi guys, how’s everyone doing?” Charlie, normally not one to hesitate, was clearly stalling.
Dean woke slowly, savoring the comfort of his bed and an overall warm feeling of total well-being. A niggle of concern tried to come to the forefront of his awareness, but he refused to pay attention to it right this moment. He allowed himself to drift for a few moments more before reluctantly kickstarting his brain. Slowly, his memory came back online, and he remembered. His whole body tensed involuntarily before he consciously relaxed, part by part. He breathed.
Charlie checked the monitor again, saw nothing out of the ordinary, and she noted it down. Her boss Castiel had asked her to keep an eye on his house this morning while they were meeting with Raphael. It was weird, but then again, Charlie knew about Dean Winchester residing with him now. Hell, everyone knew about that. She wasn’t quite sure what to think about it all – should she be all ‘get ‘im, Boss’ or should she feel bad for the human in a tricky situation? So she tried not to think about it at all, really.
As their blue eyes met green, Castiel’s grace touched Dean’s soul, and Castiel was engulfed in an explosion of power and magic and possibility that he could barely comprehend. He didn’t see energy as his brother Gabriel did, in colors and streams, but he saw/heard/felt the totality of Dean, the absolute and utterly overwhelming beauty of Dean’s soul, and he knew he would never be the same.
Cas appeared in the doorway and stepped into the room.
“I have partners along the dominance/submission spectrum, Dean, but no one has ever matched me as you do. Perhaps you are thinking that one time is not enough evidence for me to make that statement, and it might be true, if I had not experienced your soul. Your body is beautiful, and you are a good, attractive man, but your soul is…the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I wanted nothing more than for you to be my partner and me to be yours, Dean.” Castiel stopped, not sure if there was anything else he could say. He had been as clear as he was capable of. The rest was Dean’s to decide
