He dismissed his personal assistant with a wave of the left hand and made his way over to the couch. Steve gave a small wave to Mrs. Potts who was already on her way back to the elevator, then followed Stark. The billionaire had propped himself on one of the leather couches, the sunglasses now resting on a couch table made of glass, looking at Steve from beautiful brown eyes. Following Starks orders he sat down at the opposing couch and took out his notebook.
As he got up he swayed a little. The alcohol was making him tipsy. It had been a long time since he had been drunk the last time.
Taking a trip to the bathroom to take care of the morning necessity’s left him standing in front of the mirror, brushing his teeth while looking at his reflection. He ran a hand trough his hair, displeased about the greasy look. Also, his normally neatly trimmed goatee was growing into something ugly and unkept. He hated feeling filthy, but even the thought about taking off the brace to shower was painful. Sighing he took a few painkillers, deciding that he might try showering and shaving as soon as they kicked in. For now he would stay in bed, watch stupid shows and wait for the pain to recede.
Tony paled visibly as Steve and of course Peggy made their way over to their table. "Hey", he mumbled and continued eating his pasta.
, even said so yourself" Steve answered with a soft smile. Tony let out a long sigh but since Steve looked so eager to help, he just couldn’t bring himself to say no.
compatible with,” Sam tells them as he flicks open the first envelope. He clears his throat. Eyes the picture. Nods.
marble statues of like, his entire family in the foyer of their house. It was just. Terrifying. And super ugly. So, really. Thank God. I hope your house is nothing like his, or I'm really gonna have to bail.”
parking lot, Tony blocks thoughts of Ryan Gosling and Steve Rogers from his head. He conjures up a charming smile, and readies himself for a thirty-minute awkward dinner before leaving the blasted place.
It seems as if merely Carter's voice silences the cafeteria. More than half of the students’ eyes are trained on the table, and Tony resists the urge to face palm.
Tony settles on the couch, feeling extra warm as he looks out the window to the wintery scene — Paul’s knitwork is immaculate. Bruce clears his throat. “Now can we open the mysterious ones?”
“We stay up later, but the old people go to bed at nine every time,” he rolls his eyes. “Steve’s about to get a boatload of blankets and pillows and we'll make a big nest while Sharon starts her Christmas movie. Then we dig into the Rogers' ice cream pile and eat it until the lights go out at midnight.”
Tony bites back a laugh. Apparently, Darlene, Sam's mother, usually buys the presents, but since she's currently overseas the responsibility fell to Paul, who sorta botched it with all of the Legos he spent his money on. Tony tried to say that perhaps Steve really would like the Lord of the Rings set he got for him since Tony knows that Steve used to like the books back in seventh grade, but Sarah quickly shut the idea down with her uproar of laughter.
And, well. Tony can't deny that. He would want to, no matter what state of intoxicity he was in, but… but he wouldn't offer unless he was this stupidly drunk.
They're walking away. Cross drop kicks Stone's soccer ball at their backs and as it descends down on Romanoff, she neatly ducks then kicks the ball all the way across the field.
and give exaggerated explanations on the credibility of it. At some point FRIDAY joined in, and backed up their claims with articles about the app. Tony was on the verge of pulling his hair out and hysterically laughing the entire time.
“Are,” Rhodey shoots, then groans. “God, we're older than forty-year-old men and we're acting like children.”
Steve chuckles, tone low, as he walks his way over to the coffee machine. “Which includes a disgusting cup of straight black,” he chirps, throwing an amused glance Tony's way. Tony feels his cheeks heat a bit, but refuses to shy away. Through the four months that he's known Steve, he still hasn't ran out of the bakery with nerves and if he starts now it's bad for self-esteem.
“You asshole!” he accuses. “You got a Paul Wilson knitted sweater! Everyone! Tony got a Paul Wilson knitted sweater!”
“Hm,” Tony hums. He takes the apple off of the tray, taking a large bite. “Well, then, you should be asleep.”
Tony still struggles with his feelings for Steve Rogers, and an unexpected visitor comes in with astonishing news.
no next year for you. Not here, anyway.” Picking up a piece of paper on his desk, he slides it across the surface to Tony. Walking forward hesitantly, Tony takes it from him.
Dr. Banner shakes his head. “No, he would. When Tony dropped by in New York and explained the whole thing to me, Steve also came to ask me some questions about biotechnology. Tony had gotten Harley a lot of presents for his help, and Steve asked about it so Tony gave him a quick briefing.” Dr. Banner smiles ruefully. “Believe it or not, they were even more tongue-tied around each other back then. Anyway, with Steve's eidetic memory… He should've been able to remember that. I do.”
“Can we please go one conversation where we don't bring up Mhmm Mhmhm?” Sam asks. Nat, who closely followed Bucky, rolls her eyes.
Steve's lips move like a dance, and Tony's never been very rhythmic, but his lips find that they can tango with Steve's anyway. It starts slow and soft — a clash to their starting meeting — and Tony feels himself melt into Steve's waiting embrace. It's stupid, honestly — but it feels like coming home.
When the Grinch was reading the names of the citizens of Whoville and simultaneously screaming that he hates them? Wilson wheezes.
“I am a genius, after all,” Tony jokes, arrogantly. Steve gives him a smile, but it's lacking the usual genuineness. The Steve factor of it.
Tony glances at Steve once before looking back at the road. Steve's cheeks are pinker than they were before. Tony thinks his own are, too.
Everyone's eyes snap over to the doorway. Tony Stark stands there, in a three-piece suit that's not the one from his date last night. Worryingly, he doesn't even look pleased at the fact that he surprised a group of the most highly trained and skilled people on the planet.
Tony looks over to her. He schools his expression, giving an apologetic, but charming smile. “I’m sorry, but are you sure that's my table?”
He feels Steve's gaze on his head, and he's helpless to do much more than look up. Steve gives him a weak smile. “You don't think I set us up?” he jokes.
As their voices drain out, Tony helplessly looks to Steve. Steve bites his lip, amusement clear in his face.
So Tony's taking a break. Unless some tall, perfect, strong, blue-eyed, self-righteous, brave, heroic blonde is planning to come sweep him off his feet — He's keeping them planted in celibacy.
Tony shrugs. “Compared to other robots running on AI, DUM-E really isn’t that impressive. My college dissertation will need to be on something a bit more advanced.”
He shakes his head. He cannot be comprised for this mission, there's too much at stake. He cannot be comprised for this mission, there's too much at stake. He cannot be comprised for this mission, there's too —
Ty sighs, but he makes himself calm anyway. “I dunno. He's a good guy, but this is fucked up. He's got people trying to take it down, but everyone knows the mods for the stupid school blog never actually go on there, and ever since Rumlow's ‘'fighting’ video, people are always looking on there. Half the school must've already seen it.”
“Because he's probably already forgotten about me, gummy bear,” Tony remarks, smiling in the saddest winning way. Rhodey arches one eyebrow.
Tony looks at his phone for a minute while he sits in his car in the parking lot and he sees a surprise message.
” Sam explains. “Steve has one, too. That's why we had to take that video of him, to prove that he was
“See you guys later,” he shouts. “I’m not missing out on the chicks here! Find a ride home on your own!”
Tony's not talking. Steve scrambles for an assembly of his thoughts. He really wishes he was face-to-face with Tony right now.
“Yeah, bought it with my money and ate all of it during a movie marathon,” Steve sighs. “My tongue is numb to the taste of pepperoni now.”
“I probably said a bunch of stupid shit, used you as a human crutch, and then — fell asleep on you, on our way home,” his face felt hot red, “I’m so sorry about that. And then I didn’t even apologize or say thanks the next time we saw each other.”
“Nat — Nat, that's you in Chemistry,” he spits out breathlessly. Then Romanoff starts laughing, too, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably.
She leads him to a part of the gallery with lines of exhibiting pieces. “These pieces are some of the foundations of Timely Comics. Starting from this corner is where the very first pieces were being shared. As you make your way down the room, feel free to ask for any information about a piece, or a guide to lead you more into the gallery.”
Tony sees it coming. From miles away. But Howard's fist connects with Tony's face before Tony can register that he's actually going to do it.
The rest of them jump back in surprise as Natasha Romanoff stares coldly at them. Sharon Carter approaches her from behind and, calmly, they stare at the boys.
“Steve, darling, as much as I appreciate the confidence, his girlfriend can move things with her mind,” Tony protests. “We
That's why, three months into his stay, Steve Rogers got poured in thick, wet, elementary school glue, by Brock Rumlow, supplied by Tony Stark's dad's wallet.
Steve exhales a puff of cold air. His blonde hair dampens from the snow, his skin flushed pink, and his hands are shaking. His eyes search Tony’s own, aimlessly, and Tony looks down.
That seems to twist Steve's expression even further. Tony mentally flails around, with his mouth running on its own.
Peter's getting a sense of foreboding. “Uh. Do you think now's the time to tell him that we're actually Mr. Stark's meddling companions and not
Steve, for some reason, gravitates to the robot trash pile. DUM-E, the AI bot that Tony still hasn’t successfully finished, is what Steve reverently runs his fingers over — even with the opposite corner displaying an assortment of phones, tablets, and laptops that top any product the current market can present. Tony hmphs.
Stone appears in the doorway of Tony's last period class. He winks at him, before explaining to the teacher why Tony needs to be excused — something about soccer. They got the Coach's permission, too.
Glancing, surprised, at each other, everyone takes his word for it. After they've all picked a sundae, Mr. Wilson starts telling them about how Mr. Rogers agreed to go on FlickLove and Peter relaxes a bit. Eventually he tells them how he tricked Mr. Stark into doing it, and that makes them all laugh.
Tony frowns a bit at the questions. He and Steve were obviously never close friends, closer to enemies, so Steve asking him these things instead of ‘Gee, hate to see you go, pal, but my life's about to get a whole lot easier!’ is just a tiny bit odd.
Steve purses his lips, looking away from Tony. “Tony. Tony, I know you visited the bakery my first day at Timely Comics.”
Tony's jaw tenses, momentarily. He calms. “Careful, Rumlow, isn't your mom coming home for her holiday?”
Steve mimics his movements and slides to his butt against the wall across from Tony. He tilts his head. “How's your summer been?”
They react similarly, Peter giving them a good look at Mr. Chapman and his daredevil grin, before he goes on to the next envelope.
“Hi, can I get a pink pan dulce and a straight black?” he asks, cutting to the chase because Steve isn't here so what's the point of smalltalk?
He's met the gorgeous Natasha Romanoff and the famous Peggy Carter, but he'd never met Bucky, the actual owner and Steve's (very emphasized) platonic soulmate.
“Anthony,” Howard says, no emotion in his tone as Tony enters his study. He's facing the window, and Tony's sent back to when Howard sat with a ten-year-old Tony down and told him that since Tony kept making the designs of guns and weapons that he had, he would be very proud to be his father, and then gave Tony a shot of whiskey.
It's kind of unspoken knowledge in the group that they don't really, at the end of the day, have each other's backs. Admittedly, Tony and Ty have gotten each other out of tight situations, but they've known each other since diapers. Even then, though, they've watched each other be torn down and provided no help, like a reminder that everyone's by themselves — a reminder that they’ve only stayed together for so long because of their fathers. With the others, though — Tony always arches an eyebrow, and Ty always laughs or sighs. It's not that they
Tony opens his mouth, but can't seem to say anything. Steve clears his throat, pointedly, and Stark snaps it shut.
Tony explains the whole thing, happily, and, in an extra-hushed tone, recounts his night with Steve, which Rhodey uncharacteristically giggles at — Tony vows to tease him forever, but Rhodey just says, “I don’t even care, man! Kiss him the next time you see him!”
“I’m fine.” He opens up the M&M's, pours them into his palm, and holds it out for Rogers. “Want some?”
The four glance at each other anxiously. Tony's confusion heightens. Rhodey reaches behind Peter and pokes him, making the kid stumble forward. Peter glares at Rhodey, which is a
“He — He was moping?” Tony repeats, voice small. He feels like this is another joke, another prank, but with Clint's tense back, Bucky's flared nostrils, and the sad look in Sam's eyes, he feels dread dawning on him.
Tony snorts louder, and it soon dissolves into hiccups and giggles. “True. And you were so skinny! Made me wanna... Feed you or something. Sounds weird. Anyways. You're big now, captain.”
Sam Wilson moved to Timely in freshman year and was immediately admitted to the Varsity basketball team since he can basically fly across the court. He had an entire school of admirers and a team that loved him. He could be friends with
Three of them blatantly smirk, while Vision does something with his face that is dangerously close to one.
“Hey, babe, need a pick-me-up?” He tilts his head back, a challenging little smirk on his lips. (Ty sends Tony a look that makes the sighing noise for him.)
When Steve does come in with enough blankets and pillows to cover Timely, Sharon is indeed scrolling through the proffered Christmas movies. Thor is absently pushing the furniture to the sides of the room while listening to Bruce go on and on about something science-y. Bucky and Scott are looking at their phones while continually pointing things out to each other on one another’s, while Sam and Natasha go to get the ice cream.
Steve gnaws his bottom lip. “You — You think? I know I wasn't the best at the edgy abstract art Bucky always wanted me to make for the bakery and I'm not saying I'm any better at the sequences that we have to make for comics, but I've definitely practiced this style more and I'm confident enough in it to say it's not too cheesy or — or an overused style — not that my co-workers overuse styles — !”
is a place that protects them. Not even that, because when those sore topics come up, they don't clam up. They just talk. But — well, they've always done that! Too much talking, which led to arguing and mistrust, so…
Steve bites his bottom lip. “R-Really? Because. Because if you're only doing this because you — you feel bad and wanna make it up to me — ”
Tony actually smiles back, albeit still uncomfortable. “It… That's good. This is all… This is good. Especially that... we're doing it for the Army? Anyway, when are you leaving?”
Sam laughs, excitedly. “Uh huh! She’s one of the owners of that prosthetic company! Guys, she basically gives away metal body parts for
Tony patiently waits till Steve comes back out and silently freaks out that he's been interacting with Steve Rogers for a good half hour.
is criminally calm on the exterior, but Peter can just imagine what could be happening on the inside. Mr. Stark yelling and pointing, Mr. Rogers frowning and speaking in a calm tone that's
“I'm sorry to disappoint, as well,” he says, voice earnest, and all 'aw, shucks', “but you won't be getting the... 'spanky-spanky' from me, either. You will get the other type of hitting, though, if you imply something like that about one of my friends again.”
he's better than you, and who has his arm wrapped around Tiny Rogers's shoulders who's smiling all bright and sunny is just —
Tony can only distantly correlate what's happening to reality. Stone's tense next to them. They're both not made for this part — it's why Stone never actively hurt Rogers, or why Tony never went farther than the planning.
Steve straightens. “You’ll all be going over extensive training to hopefully lead you away from your intrusive habits. The drills we have planned for you all
Tony closes the gap between Steve and himself, and cups Steve's cheeks. He exhales, shakily, and Steve's eyes widen, his cheeks flush, with his mouth gaping open.
It's awkwardly quiet for a moment. Tony swings his head to Sarah, gesturing to the phone on the corner of the desk. “Could I — The phone?”
Tony burns a deep red. “I — No, no, definitely not, that is the second time you've caught me singing today and this is just — peak humiliating.”
Tony looks at him, incredulously, before laughing, hard. “You don't think I already realized that?” he laughs, breathlessly. “Why else would I punch out that overgrown toddler? Why else would I finally do what's right — ”
“What exactly are you apologizing for?” Tony teases, trying to portray being calm because holyshithe'smaintainingaconversationwithsteverogers.
Tony straightens as the two approach, eyes flickering to a cowering Cross every once in awhile. He looks scared shitless. Good.
So the blind date thing actually came through, and Tony's on his way to it now. To go disappoint some well-known guy that just wanted to go on a pleasant date.
“When I first saw you, I thought,” Steve swallows, eyes still frantic, “I thought that you were just — just…”
Still, he shrugs. “I’m not gonna make it to the end of the semester. It's gonna be to California. And, uh. Well. Forever. Not to sound overly dramatic.”
“Even with all those muscles, sissies need bodyguards,” Hammer reiterates, chortling at his own joke. Cross squints at Rogers.
“Why do you wanna touch them so much?” Rumlow challenges. Hammer tries to defend himself, but Ty's already talking over him.
Looking over, Rogers isn't looking up at all or talking, seemingly doodling very concentratedly in his notebook. Wilson, however, is staring right at Tony. He doesn't look very happy.
“I want to barrel in all of their faces,” Rumlow growls, hands clenched around his lunch fork. “Especially those bitches.”
“Stevie and I will be drinking mimosas and making out,” Stark finishes, sliding his glasses off his face. He grins. “Happy muscle strains, meddlers.”
Tony inhales sharply, mouth opening and closing like he can't find his words. Peter guesses he never does, because Mr. Stark just sends him a tiny, warm smile.
Steve shrugs a bit. “Not too far. Uh, three blocks away from here. And, well.” Steve shifts. “My house… I — Your friends are very… My house doesn't exactly look like Tiberius Stone's house.”
“Don’t worry about that, I can forge it,” Natasha dismisses, entering the room. “What we need to worry about is that Tony's not in his room.”
“Doesn’t seem likely, no.” It comes out of Tony's mouth instantly, and he internally berates himself when Steve's face falls. God, Tony's a mood-killer. He swallows. “Anyway. To my understanding, you haven't been in cooperation with four meddlers as far as I know, so I have to assume that you didn't know that I'd be your… guest for the evening, as well.”
“Oh no, you'll get that when you come back,” Tony mimics. Steve is battling through relief, happiness, and pure rage.
“Steve,” Tony interrupts softly. “I’m here, too. All I can conclude from this whole thing is the kindness of you and your mother. Besides, it's not any of my business.”
Tony smiles brightly in return and Steve's cheeks fluster in a…not unattractive way. Tony clears his throat, looking away to sit against the wall of Sarah's office.
“As much as I enjoy seeing your creations, sir,” Jarvis's voice speaks from behind him, “I have my doubts about that assurance. DUM-E has been brought from the storage units to the workshop several times, now.”
Tony slumps as he ducks his head to go in the car. “Do you ever feel like a child even when you're in your thirties?”
Cross and Hammer are being spotted by the football coach right now in order to give Rumlow, Stone, and Tony a proper alibi.
hey, long time no see :( i always first wanna apologize about my lack of replying to comments - i read each one, and they really do fuel this story!! i probably would've given up on it awhile ago without all of you commenters :)
(also, i updated the tags on this! these new tags are definitely important, so if there's one that you think i'm missing, feel free to share :))
And it was tearing Tony apart, because sure, he knew that he and Ty and Cross and everyone else were gonna follow the rules until they got into college, at least, but seeing the reactions to the broken rules via Steve Rogers's life? Fucks with Tony's head, because damn it, he wants to punch Rumlow in the face after a stupid prank, and he wants to draw a synagogue and paste it to Nazi-boy Schmidt's locker, and he wants to fucking smile while wearing—
Tony, slightly amazed and overwhelmingly confused as he always is with Steve, starts looking through the better tech he has on hand for gift ideas. His mind fires off, making connections with the stories he collected from the evening, and he gets everything together easily enough — he then starts the gruesome process of making sure everything is perfect because nothing is worse than a broken present.
Staring at her phone as she walks in, Romanoff announces, “Sharon says she'll be here in about half an hour or so, so we can start the movies. She also said that I get the first pick.”
The whole group stares at the pile of unknown presents under the tree. Tony sends one glance to Steve, who has mastered the surprised expression on his face.
She's the CEO of the company Equality First, and sponsors nearly two dozen young minority groups every year. In addition, she participates in a training center for young women learning self-defense. She's... She's looking for a partner who can keep up with her, can respect her, but can most of all learn more about her than just the surface.
In Tony's subtle attempts to detach her, she had navigated him near the center of the room, where Tony lost track of her but was soon surrounded by a group of more people gyrating their hips against him. He could almost swear some guy's dick was nudging his ass. He does get a beer somehow pressed into his hand, so he just chugs it down and let people continue doing their thing. It's whatever.
“Plus, that's what got me in that junior slut's pants,” Rumlow wriggled his eyebrows. “Freshman year was great!”
Tony reddens. She still has this terrifying all-knowing expression on her face. “Uh — Yeah. Yeah, it's me. A little rougher around the edges, but still me."
Tony sighed and threw his phone into a corner. Then he decided it was best to turn it off, so he started searching for the phone. Which really wasn't easy, since his whole room was a mess, just like his life right now.
In Row 1b there was only one seat left, right in the middle. So Tony made his way across other peoples laps, constantly apologizing.
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle. He would have loved to be a witness of the two officers trying to rescue a kitten. And both Clint and Bucky finally were getting somewhere. Their colleague Natasha had a betting pool on them and Steve himself had participated in it, rumors said even their boss was in. Thank god no one was betting on his love life. (Or he thought so, knowing Natasha there might be a second pool. He just didn’t want to know)
After a few minutes Tony’s breathing slowed down and he opened his eyes to look at Steve. His skin was flecked with red spots, his cheeks as well as Steve’s t-shirt wet with tears, but at least he wasn’t hyperventilating anymore.
At the flat he was greeted by the sight of Steve who sat at the kitchen table, staring at his mobile phone and playing candy crush.
"Don't do that or you will get sick, too", Tony stuttered and blushed. Steve smiled at how adorable his boyfriend was.
“Okay, mom”, Tony answered with a sharp nod. Both knew he wouldn’t go back to bed. Not when the only thing distracting him from the pain was working on stuff. Pepper sighed and turned to leave.
"Hardly a restaurant", Bruce muttered, "I don't want to know what I'm eating there..." Everyone started laughing.
"You should take it easy today, you still fainted", Steve told him. Tony finally looked at Steve's face and saw a small plaster taped over his nose. The last time he had seen that face it was covered... stop thinking, stop thinking. He felt his legs going weak again.
But still, what had out him in such a good mood? Had he really gotten himself a girlfriend? Steve wasn't sure what to think about it, but as long as Tony was happy.
Steve also told him that, after Tony had walked into the living room wearing nothing but soft sweat pants. Both sat down at the edge of the couch and Steve grabbed the towel Tony presented him with, to take care of drying and re-wrapping the injury.
"I'm horrible, Bruce", he whined, "they are so happy and I just hope they break up. Really soon if possible."
"Yeah, right, says the guy, who probably isn't able to reproduce anymore", Tony grinned. "Which is better this way anyway."
“Uh, yes, I could just use some more coffee. Want some too?” He got up and Steve couldn’t help but notice him sway. On a second glance he could see the engineer’s brows furrowed in pain. Thinking back, he hadn’t seen Tony take any painkillers and remembering his own bullet wound (which had just been a grazing shot) he should still be in a lot of pain.
“Hey, are you the police?”, one of the guys called. From his voice he wasn’t the one who called but rather the one holding the gun.
"I think our rooms are a bit small, we should just eat here!" So everyone sat down on the dark hallway and started devouring their pizzas.
“Sorry, didn’t want to insult you, it’s just that I could use some food and you might feel the same way!”
“You know what, you should invite your boyfriend to next game night”, Bucky told him, getting up from the table to make himself some coffee.
On the campus he saw Steve and Peggy from the distance and let out a small sigh. Peggy was really nice but he still had this stupid little crush on Steve.
“Alright, Mr. Stark, you can either have a nurse come over once a day or have Mr. Rogers help you. Your choice”, the doctor answered and shrugged. Tony was still staring at Steve, his face sporting a bright red blush. He shook his head and settled on a fake smile that could barely hide how exhausted he still was.
of daily visits. Once he finished work (thankfully no night shifts for him that week) he visited Tony, helped him with the injury and they watched movies afterwards. In the matter of a few days Tony looked a lot better than the first day Steve visited, the infection having healed and the last night of their weekly arrangement ended with Tony telling him, that Dr. Banner had allowed that he could go back to work…if he took it easy.
He made his way back to the workbench, Tony behind him, when it happened. He heard a small curse to see that Tony’s flip flop had gotten stuck between a few pieces of junk, the brunette trying to gain back his balance, arm flailing ineffectively, the crash inevitable. He tipped over and crashed into Steve with a cry sending both tumbling to the ground. Everything went quiet.
They met in front of the dorm and went for a walk over campus. The snow under their feet was the only noise. Long time they walked without talking.
A few hours later Steve was done for the day. Every single teacher had spent ages on telling them how important the subject they were teaching were. He didn't know that History of art was going to make the difference weather he got a job or not. He was really grateful that football practice would only start on the next day. After all he was here for a football- scholarship, but had to choose a major. Who would have guessed that art was going to kick his ass?
Just when he reached his bed again, utterly exhausted from the short toilet break, he heard a key turning and the door opening.
"Oh, thank you", Peggy beamed, "Were you at the fair, too? Steve told me you are really good at science! I don't understand half of it, but the fair was still fun."
"Uhm... thanks", Tony answered. This was bad, he had decided he hated Peggy and here she was, being friendly to him.
“I already rested a week”, the billionaire argued, “and you saw how bad I am at changing the bandages.”
“Good morning”, Steve called as he went for the shower. Bucky only gave a grumble and stared at him through half lidded eyes. When Steve came back from the shower he at least looked a little bit more awake than a few minutes ago.
"Peggy, since you never had the pleasure: This is my flat mate Tony- Tony, this is my girlfriend Peggy", Steve introduced them.
"Do you really think mixing 8 different flavours will taste good?" Steve asked suspiciously as Tony added another chocolate bar into the melting bath.
"Hey, look, I'm sorry for running you over this morning. Are you alright? I just was in a real hurry"; Steve explained, scratching his head awkwardly. The glare on the others face softened a little.
Steve didn't really want to fight. Mainly, because he was here to watch Steve's game, but also because Hammer was holding a bucket of coke. He didn't really want that all over him.
“Shit”, Tony screamed in agony, “Fuck.” Steve could hear his voice break, he saw the engineer’s form trembling and the moans were replaced by soft, wet sobs. Steve took a quick breath then kneeled down next to him.
"Oh", Tony breathed, "I'm sorry." He still tried to process the information. Steve was single again. And he could finally like Peggy without feeling jealous. But he still felt bad for Steve who looked really down.
Tony hid under the shower. He didn't want to face Steve any time soon. He had just fainted because of a little bit of blood. It had been Steve who had been hurt and he just collapsed instead. Kinda pathetic...
Over the course of the next half hour Banner cleaned the wound, telling Tony how lucky he was that it was just a minor infection. Then he showed Steve how to apply the bandages as well as the brace. He even looked at the small burn on Steve’s finger, applying a bit of salve and a new band aid.
“Mrs. Potts will be here in a minute”, he said with a gruff voice. Steve thanked him and put his hands in his pockets to stop himself from fidgeting. It wasn’t until a solid fifteen minutes later when a young woman with red hair dressed in a neat suit appeared at the front entrance.
On the inside Tony hated himself even more. Steve was happy so shouldn't he be happy for him? But well, Tony Stark had always been selfish and he couldn't suppress this jealousy.
“Finished?”, Tony asked, waving the gun in his hand. This made the other man flinch and stare at him like a deer caught in headlights.
They went silent and most continued looking at the stars until Tony sneezed. In an instant all eyes were locked on him.
Turned out that while being a genius, Stark was also amazingly good at explaining how things worked to normal people. His voice was warm and friendly and against Steve’s expectations he was patient in explaining what to do. While the captain was sitting in one of the chairs, Tony had sat down at the edge of the table and got up several times to get some spare parts or another cup of coffee.
“Stop fidgeting so much, the doctors said to clean it at least every second day. You don’t want to get an infection, do you?”, the redhead answered and poured some more antiseptic on the wound. Tony shivered from the cold feeling. At least it didn’t burn as badly as he expected it to.
After taking the first bite he had to admit though that he could have just eaten a candy bar. There wasn't anything besides chocolate in this.
"I'm so sorry for ruining your evening," Tony mumbled, "and I don't have a present for you anymore."
“Uhm, Mr. Stark…Tony? This is Steve Rogers, are you here?”, he called as he stepped into the penthouse suite. The sun was shining through the huge glass panel windows tinting the room in a soft light and Steve could feel the faint breeze of the air con on his skin. No one answered his call. Alright, that meant the engineer might already be in his workshop again. Still Steve couldn’t help but be a bit curious about Tony’s living situation. He took a step forward. Ok, no, this was an invasion of privacy. Before he could change his mind and give in to the curiosity, he turned and stepped back into the elevator, this time pressing the workshop button.
“I’ll show you how to treat everything”, Dr. Banner told him. “Do you have a bathroom where we can wash this wound?”
“I’m sorry, just have to follow the protocol”, Steve answered, continuing to write down Starks answers. “So aside from being in pain you were fully conscious when pointing a gun at a person?”
“Okay, okay”, Steve took out his handcuffs, crunching down next to ex-thug. The man offered him his hands without a question while still having his eyes fixed on the gun. As soon as he had the man in custody he heard a clatter and saw that the gun falling to the ground.
When Rumlow breaks out into a run toward a big van, Tony follows hesitantly — he isn't a stranger to the kidnappers in white vans, who is?
in the romantic aspects of life. Or the sexual ones. You see, Steve fell in love with Peggy first. And that ended so abruptly and really — Steve just gets depressed thinking about it, especially after Peg's death, even though he
“ — an online bookstore, and has made over fifteen different free apps for multiple levels and subjects of education. Apparently, she's tech-savvy, got a doctorate in tech-something-something, which apparently turns Steve on, right?”
Barnes splutters before launching into an argument that the other guys jump into, as well. Steve looks at Tony, apologetically, but Tony just kind of is awed. The arguing doesn't seem new, yet all of them are so unashamedly supportive and protective of each other even with these disputes. If Tony told Ty off like Romanoff is doing to Wilson, Ty would've painted Tony's room bright pink and dip Tony's clothes in pink, as well. And Tony would've done the same. Yet they all just… Move on from it.
Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter are walking and chatting amorously, gradually reaching their table. Carter's a senior, and a busy one at that, so she's rarely visiting the Juniors' lunch. They get stopped by Thor, and start talking just a few feet away. Rumlow is literally growling.
Tony feels dread rising in him. Rogers cannot do that, Tony won't allow him to, hell, no — If he sleeps in one of those rooms, someone will approach him, try to get in his pants, and somewhere very distantly a more sober Tony wonders why this is at all Tony's problem, but drunk Tony is telling that Tony to shut the hell up, and is already talking out loud.
Tony cracked one last smile before being pushed out of the kitchen. Where he ends up in the living room, in the heat of a conversation.
Tony huffs. “I never should of told you about him back in seventh grade or introduced you that one summer.”
Tony was quite embarrassed. That was the reason why he hated to shower or undress in public. He had been way too young to remember any of the operation but it had left him with this nasty scar and he was getting tired of explaining.
“I don’t really know. I got a call stating that you got shot…in the shoulder..and that I’m your emergency contact.”, she told him with a sad smile. “It really when I saw you, you were so pale and cold. Oh Tony, you lost so much blood and were out for two days. I was so worried!”
So he simply nodded and followed Stark halfway through the lab (he couldn’t help to close his eyes every time Stark nearly stepped on something sharp, ugh, flip flops!) till they reached a work bench that was relatively clean. He could only see small metal parts and cables as well as a soldering iron.
Who knew he had such a great voice? He had to force him to go to the karaoke bar across town sometime soon. Then he remembered him and Tony not talking. Ok, barely talking.
"As friend Tony I will stay here", Thor told them, everyone nodded. As an exchange student it was probably the best idea.
Steve started rubbing circles onto his back while talking to the engineer in a soft voice. Tony closed his eyes and sucking in a shuddering breath, then another.
“I’ll just go…to the workshop”, he answered, already distracted by the thoughts of possible projects. At least he could count on his engineer’s brain.
“I’m sorry I already wasted so much of your time, Captain”, Stark sputtered, looking at the clock. “I tend to get carried away when working on stuff. Since you helped me a ton, I would love to invite you to some fancy restaurant.”
“I talked to Captain Rogers from the NYPD. He’s a nice young man and the one who found you, do you remember?”
"Well, I think I'll finish for today and do the rest tomorrow." Or the next days. He would probably need more time.
His legs responded before he could even understand what he saw. He found himself running towards the dorm. After locking the door twice he leaned heavily against it.
Christmas eve was the first day Tony was able to leave the bed for more than 20 minutes without nearly collapsing in the aftermath.
The next days he started avoiding Steve. Forgotten were their cooking parties and movie nights. Tony spent the days locked in his room running only on coffee, energy drinks and fast food while Steve was never at home, spending every evening he got with Peggy.
"Couldn't decide, so I'm going for both, mechanical and electrical engineering", Tony explained, "what about you?"
“Ah, I requested that…more details on the man who got shot. Hopefully gonna interview him soon so we can close this case”, Steve answered and started looking through the now unorganized papers with Bucky peaking over his shoulder.
Tony's bed was occupied with variant parts of DUM-E, so Steve decided that it would be easiest, if he slept in his bed.
This time they took the elevator (again, pin coded) to the basement. Huge glass panels divided the workshop from the entrance and Steve could see Starks form hunched over a work bench. The workshop itself was full of different types of heavy machines, workbenches and tons of scrap material. And Steve had never seen that huge amounts of…well... junk lying around anywhere. Mrs. Potts entered a code and the glass doors opened letting them inside.
Tony tugged self-consciously on the sleeves of the jacket Steve lent him. It was a lot too big but at least warm. So warm that it was getting uncomfortable waiting inside.
He knew Steve adored motorbikes. He had never said so, but every time they passed one on campus he got this look in his eyes.
The doctor left and Steve sat down on the edge of Tony's bed. The nurse had undressed him completely and given him a hospital gown. He was lying under at least three heating blankets.
“Naaah, I’m awake.”, Tony called from the couch. Both Steve and Banner turned around to see the billionaire slowly sitting up.
Tony felt his own face heat up under that innocent comment implying losing his clothes. God, he sure was fucked. Looking at Steve the blonde merely smirked upon seeing Tony’s emotions displayed on his face. Normally the engineer wouldn’t have any problem to shoot back an even flirtier comment, but Steve somehow managed to shut down his brain.
Steve's expression softens. “C’mon, Tony. Let's go in, everyone will understand. Honestly, it's… it's really… uh… admirable? Admirable. That you… That you even wanted to — ”
“Tony, I — ” he falters. “Thank God you're okay, I couldn't — If you got hurt and I wasn't there — ”
“No, no, I...” Tony huffs a little laugh. “It may be good to get this out. So, I'm guessing you've all seen Darren Cross's story.”
In retrospect, Sam's definitely right, and this is exactly what Steve signed up for. But it's all so soon. And tomorrow's
Tony stumbles where he stands, looking like an idiot but not caring. “What, I — You can't take me out the year before senior year, you can't make me
It doesn't matter that Tony hacked into Hammer's phone and MarvelUs.com to post that humiliating video.
“Pep, darling, pudding cup,” he starts. “You know I'd never intentionally be a pain in your ass, so please forgive me, I'll be there in a blink of an eye, seriously!”
“Oh,” he says. Instead of actively showing his disappointment, Tony shoves the cup in his face — only to instantly pull away with a scrunched-up nose because the coffee is disgusting because Steve didn't make it because everything sucks.
“I — ” Bucky starts to protest, but Natasha sends him a stern, meaningful look. He huffs before nodding in agreement, reluctantly.
Tony furrows his eyebrows, opening his mouth to question what the deal is, when Jarvis says, “Your father is here.”
Eyes surging open, Tony pushes past people with a similar lack of care. He vaguely remembers that the front door is in the direction he's heading, but in all honesty, he's just kind of stumbling until he reaches a doorknob.
Hence new kid was now skinny kid who fought and had an accent, and Tony was helpless to do much other than gawk at him. (It soon became A Thing, embarrassingly enough.)
“So. My name is Sarah Rogers,” she introduces. “I'm a nurse from Centennial Medical, and I help oversee the health department here at SA.”
“Anyway, you're getting free pink-frosted conchas and straight blacks for a week,” Sam says flatly. Tony makes a noise of protest, but Steve shakes his head, grinning.
“What I want to know,” Howard fumes, “is why Rebecca Hodge called your mother this morning telling her about how you punched her son out.”
Tony tames down the heat that starts to flood his cheeks. He shrugs nonchalantly before looking away not-so-casually.
Tony gives him a searching look, then shrugs. “M'kay. But yeah, I guess I identify as bisexual, though pansexual might be a better fit. And by the way, I wouldn't be so sure with that heterosexual thing till you knock a guy. Don't tell your aunt I said that.”
Tony swallows, wants to pretend that he didn’t hear him, but he couldn’t bear hurting him more than he’s already done. He stops next to the mailbox and turns.
Steve laughs softly. “Because you haven't slept in over 48 hours, you're delirious, and this seems very spur of the moment.”
Ty tsks. “I was thinking about offering little Odinson in. Then we can get Thor, and easy access to Rogers for the prank.”
The man goes to continue gushing, but she lightly dismisses him. “Now, I know you've brought your little girl with you. Go on, John, show the lady a good time.”
They trudge silently inside, and Tony makes short work of placing the presents under the tree. Steve sleepily watches him, smiling as he settles into the blankets. Tony follows him under the covers and sighs a breath of relief, his mind settling into a state of rest as his mission is completed.
“Maybe by how you didn't think to even text Steve that you weren't interested?” Bucky growls. “How you left the guy mopin' for weeks because you couldn't take the time outta your "busy" schedule to call him? He was so — so fucking torn.”
Tony pauses only for a moment longer before stepping into the Rogers home. Barnes is shooting him a red hot glare.
Jarvis doesn't react at the name that Tony knows he's heard a million times from Tony himself, and nods respectfully to Steve. “Hello, Mr. Rogers. I hope it was not too much of a bother for you to look after Master Stark in my absence?”
Some are still laughing, others are walking away. Some are congratulating Tony and the group even though they didn't publicly take credit for it this time. Stone is grinning, gripping Tony's shoulder.
“Santa got me a subscription to free StarkCAD,” Scott squeaks. “Fuck AutoCAD, this shit is going to — AH!”
Sleep, that is. He can't possibly just sit here and… Bide his time while his wallet sits in Steve's car, just waiting to be used to buy all of these extremely sweet people gifts.
i'll try my best to get a new chapter out next week! i hope this one was worth the wait and that tony singing was a lot of second-hand embarrassment because it was for me and i wrote it :D
There are only two physical fights (both involving Sharon, that woman is terrifying) but everyone ends up satisfied with their plates and bowls and hands (Lang). Barnes chooses to watch
“We’re all supposed to be doing something,” Steve says, almost absentmindedly, “that doesn’t take away from our own wonderful, does it?”
Tony gets hung up on — he’s laughing too hard to even care. After sending a quick Snapchat of him giving a thumbs up and a ‘happy holidays’ to Pepper, Tony shrugs into the sweater that Paul knit and dodges out of the bathroom.
Tony's heartbeat takes over. The friendly banter is even worse than silence. He can't deal with Steve Rogers's adorableness.
Tony’s stomach caves in before he says, certainly, “No. I’m sorry. Thank you, again. Merry Christmas.”
Instead, Tony exits his car, a careless grin playing on his lips, and walks easily toward Marvel High School.
Tony's sipping the coffee as Happy informs him, and he's about to agree before the coffee hits his taste buds, and —
“Coulson is going to come down and make sure everyone's in the right places in five minutes,” Strange interrupts. “I'm keeping your asses from detention.”
“He obviously likes you,” Tony interjects, too tired to correct his own mispronoun. “You can have this unit once I’m in California, visit it every month or so. It’ll be pretty much empty by then.”
Wilson just gives him another warning look. The class eventually starts chattering again, this time in low whispers.
“Yeah, yeah.” He scrolls a bit more. “Lastly, it says she wants a man who’s polite and respectful, but not overly traditional, and one who can appreciate her, but not only for her achievements or money.” Sam squints at the award list. “Which I bet she has
ius. Ever since Sunset Bain started calling him 'Bear' as a nickname, no one's shook it off, not even his closest friends.
“Tony, you didn’t — You didn’t do anything wrong,” Steve protests. “I was having a terrible night before I bumped into you on the sidewalk. You sharing the M&M’s…”
Tony's response is immediate. “Well, I've been staring at this ring I made you six months ago for like, the past hour, so, really... This isn't spur of the moment.”
“No, you're all potatoes,” Sam argues. “But especially Steve! Guys, please help me convince him to go on FlickLove!”
“Hey, no, no, no,” Tony reassures gently. “No hating yourself, okay, you're literally an angel, no hating angels, Stevie, this is important — ”
“I’ve got Hannah here,” Ty tells Tony, when one of the clocks on the walls say it's two o'clock in the morning. He's motioning to the blonde next to him. “And we're gonna go fuck, so! Bye!”
Peter's cheeks are burning red, but he's still working hard, just glancing at his phone every few seconds.
There's only a short splatter of laughter before Wilson stands, shrugging Rogers protests off. “You say anything to him again, you touch him again, you do anything to him and I'll rip you to shreds.”
“What's your sexuality?” is the one of the first questions. Steve shifts in preparation, clearing his throat.
In his hands is a sketch of a city, presumably New York City, with mute colors shaded in by a skilled hand. The city in the worn book seems to be alive in a way that Tony's never seen in a color-pencil drawing before. The sky is a deafening dark color, seemingly blue and purple, with skyscrapers towering over a road of flying cars, which makes everything seem like it's moving, and Tony feels like that's how Steve must have thought what his city felt like. Tony feels a smile spread over his cheeks.
“Thank you, officer”, he managed to slur and felt the world closing in on his. The last thing he saw was the panicked look on the face of hot officer. Then he let darkness wash over him.
It was dark enough so no one could see him blush, but it was way too obvious as he croaked a small: "Thank you."
“Tony, I brought Captain Rogers, as you requested. I’ll be leaving now, but you can always call me if you need anything.”
“Haven’t I already told you everything? He tried to mug me, I went for his gun, he shot me, I had the gun, I forced him to call you.”
“You know, I’d rather get to know you myself. The internet isn’t a kind place”, he said with a smirk. Tony, who had still been drinking, started to choke on the water, his face turning a bright red. He started coughing. After a few seconds the brunette finally managed to suck in a breath and struggled to regain his composure.
Steve beamed at him and Tony blushed when he saw how happy his friend got just because he agreed to watch one stupid football game.
Suddenly the door to Steve's room opened. His blood grew cold. So he had been at home and he had heard him and he was sitting at the table in only his boxers and...
Damn brace, his new bane of existence. But the doctors had been very clear. If he wanted to recover fully, he wasn’t to use his arm at all for the next few weeks. And while that was totally inconvenient Tony was all but stupid and wouldn’t risk his chance on recovery on simply being annoyed by being disabled for a few weeks. Still meant it sucked and he was sorry for Pepper who had to deal with his bad mood.
“You are doing great. Amazing. I know you’re in pain, but you will get better. Come on, slow breaths…”
"Guys, do you want to join us for an awesome cooking party?", Clint greeted them as soon as they entered the building.
“Hand over your money!”, the thug demanded and Tony had noticed the small but distinct shake of his hand as he pointed a gun at him. Probably was his first time robbing someone, Tony wasn’t even sure if that guy knew how to use a gun.
"I'm here. And I'm fine", he mumbled, keeping his eyes glued to the ground. "I'm sorry for ruining your game."
“You know, no offense, but resting is important for recovery”, Steve sighed. Tony gave him a small shrug but Steve could see his ears turn pink. That again looked quite cute and even if he didn’t approve the engineer’s workaholic lifestyle he sure could understand the need for distraction. With his mind wandering off he forgot about the hot soldering iron in his hands. He cursed, talking to Tony had distracted him enough to burn his fingers.
"As a matter of fact I'm studying engineering and you business management", he sighed, "You will never beat me, no matter what you try. Intelligence beats arrogance!"
Right in front of him was standing the unfriendly guy who ran into him that morning. His hair was still as messy as the first time Steve met him and his glasses were taped together at the front with some duct tape.
“Oh Tony, don’t ever scare me like that again”, his friend sighed, and helped him to sit up by pushing some button on the side of the bed. Having opened his eyes Tony could see the dark circles under Peppers eyes as well as several IVs and other kinds of cables running into his arms. Probably painkillers and fluids. His shoulder was bandaged, and the pain was dull.
"Of course not, that is something you have to tell him by yourself if you want him to know." Bruce smiled at him.
"Actually I have no assignments", Tony smiled, "the Profs gave us none, which is awesome! This is why I like Christmas time."
After being pestered by Steve for hours he had even agreed to put on a costume. So right now he was wearing a cape from the local costume rental and pointed teeth. At least it wasn't that bad, being a cool vampire sure was awesome. Or at least not embarrassing.
“A lot!”, Tony sighed and sat down, watching Steve going back to arranging everything for the night.
Two days later and against doctor’s advice he discharged himself and left the building with a useless arm and a small bottle of painkillers.
Tony sighed. That was going to be the worst lunch he had ever had. Finally everyone moved on and started talking about sports.
“A lot better already. Let me just grab a band aid and I’m ready to work again”, Steve had spotted the first aid kit on the counter and wrapped a small plaster around the burnt finger. “see, nothing to worry about, let’s finish your device, I’ll make sure to not burn myself again.”
"Leave Steve out of this", Tony yelled. Another punch, this time it hit him in the stomach and Tony felt his legs giving out. Shit, it hurt!
Steve shrugged while his best friend continued to laugh. Even though this whole situation was more than embarrassing for him, he couldn’t help but smile about Bucky’s delight. He was used to the friendly banter since from their high school days on Bucky had tried to set him up for several dates (none of them successful though) The next moment his phone pinged and before Steve could have a look, Bucky dove for it, snatching it from Steve’s fingers.
Tony finally found his phone and looked at the screen. Another message, but this time from Bruce. So he decided to at least read it.
After Steve left, Tony realized that he had fallen for his friend. So hard that it hurt thinking about it.
“I have parking duty today”, Bucky complained and took another long sip, “and it’s with Clint” He sighed. Steve couldn’t help but laugh about the look of pure misery Bucky sent him.
He had always had a little problem with seeing blood, had even collapsed because of it before. But the last time had been years ago.
The redhead gave him a sharp nod and the elevator stopped. Steve followed her into some kind of private suite. Looking around Steve noticed the fantastic view through the glass panels that made up the wall. Stark sure knew how to live luxurious. He saw some couches in front of a giant TV as well as a very nicely equipped kitchen that looked like it had never been touched.
Physics class was the first time in ages Tony could relax. Finally! He just wasn't made for this. Constantly interacting with others, trying to be nice... It was exhausting and the semester had just started. But the others seemed quite nice. He was still a little angry with Steve for breaking his glasses, but just watching him made up for it. But still- Steve was a guy, he was a guy and his parents expected of him to come home from college with a nice girlfriend. To be honest- he didn't need the education, he was already way more experienced than most of their teachers. But his butler had convinced his parents that a little social interaction would do no harm.
The next weeks went by in a haze. Even though Tony wouldn't admit it he started to really grow fond of his new dorm mates. After Clint discovered his big flat screen he had pestered him long enough until he moved it to the common room.
“Morning”, he muttered and continued watching videos on his smartphone. Steve helped himself to a bowl of cereal and sat down facing his best friend.
Wait no, he couldn’t be serious. Couldn’t he see that Tony was the one in pain? And he was sympathizing with thug-guy? That was low.
Tony tried and failed, so Steve carefully lifted his upper body and then held the painkillers in front of Tony's face.
With his personal assistant returning, he wouldn’t need Steve’s help anymore and the Captain didn’t know if he was very happy with that. Sure, Tony was a hand full and sometimes a real hassle to deal with – for a genius his sense of self preservation was disturbingly low – but Steve enjoyed his company a lot. So when Tony asked him to the promised dinner date, he said yes.
“Good morning”, Steve called and the brunette turned around, flinching and nearly spilling his coffee. Tony’s eyes widened, and a smile formed on his face making him look younger and a lot less exhausted.
It was amazing at what speed a human under pressure could move. He managed to pack in less than two minutes, shower in less than one and was at the bus stop only five minutes after he woke up.
“Shot, yes, you’re right. The bullet damaged bone as well as tissue. We fixed you up in an emergency surgery right after you were admitted to the hospital and I’m happy to say that you’ll probably gain back full function, but you’ll need time and physical therapy.”
“Can’t deny I’m feeling a little drowsy”, Tony muttered, “okay, but only if you let me take you out later.”
Fist he didn't finish his thought, but Steve just kept looking at him so he went on: "If you don't care for my looks and me not looking at you as a last resort I could be your model. Or you just use a photo of your mom..."
Ok I'm not sure how long this will be anymore. Planned on something short and the counter is at 6000 written words atm. But I keep changing stuff, so we'll see 8D
"Steeeve, I'm not sick", Tony sighed, but realized there was no way to escape his friend as soon as Steve entered the mother-hen-mode. So he let Steve tuck him into bed, telling him to rest until the soup was ready.
Which proved itself pretty hard since he couldn’t stop his hands – ok his one good hand- from shaking. Hell, that one wasn’t even injured! Coffee wasn’t working either which was bad. Like, really bad. Normally a cup of hot steaming coffee would steady his hands and calm his mind, right now his thoughts were still running in circles and he kept flinching. As another pretty hard shiver wrecked his body and he nearly dropped the soldering iron, he decided that maybe he would need help, so he pulled out his phone.
“Look Tony, I’m getting deployed again. I’m sorry”, Rhodey told him in a pained voice. Tony simply nodded. He knew of Rhodey of military duty – hated it - but he wasn’t ready to let his friend go so soon.
"I don't know, you did the shopping yesterday", Steve answered, opening the fridge and looking inside. There was...fast food, incredible amounts of fast food.
"Since I don't like burgers for breakfast how about some scrambled eggs and bacon?" "Sounds awesome", Tony yawned, "My first class is in an hour..."
"Sweetheart, we need to go, I don't want to be late for the movie", Steve took Peggy's hand, "It was fancy meeting you, have some fun!"
When Steve was anxious no one could stop him. He ended up running way faster than the others. His football training was paying off.
“As you might know I’m currently…lefthanded”, Stark pointed on the prominent brace restraining his right arm, “and I am working on a prototype that needs someone able to use both hands for assembling. If you’d please follow me? Also, just call me Tony.”
After what seemed like an eternity Tony could see blue lights flashing and he sighed. Finally. He wasn’t really sure for how long he could hold up the illusion of him being in charge anymore.
“Hi”, Tony greeted the others, then turned to Steve, “Stop worrying, I’m fine, Dr. Banner just told me I can take it off for a few hours each day. Really.”
“Alright” Stark nodded, all the professional, “Then let me walk you to the door. Don’t wanna waste more of your precious time, Captain Rogers.”
“Stop being childish, you shouldn’t be working anyways! Tony, please. You should give your body time to heal.”
“Still not the morning person, are you, Buck?”, he asked with a soft smile. They had spent the last evening staying up late, talking and it sure had taken its poll.
"Would you like some hot chocolate?" he asked, "Jarvis, my butler, always made hot chocolate for me when I felt bad."
"Finished!" He exclaimed a few moments later and turned his pad around so that Tony could see his portrait.
“Ouch, Pepper, that hurts”, he exclaimed as his friend and assistant started dabbing at the now stitched up hole.
Several guys from all over the room were staring at her with big eyes. Steve dropped his arm over her shoulder.
The room was basked in soft light shining through the huge glass windows and Tony noticed that sometime in the night he had kicked the blanket out of the bed. With a look at the clock he sat up. Huh, he couldn’t remember the last time he last slept for more than 13 hours. That would also explain why his shoulder was hurting more by the minute. His fingers itched to do something productive, but considering the events of the last day (and the doctor’s orders) maybe spending the day in bed, pumped with painkillers, wasn’t the worst option. And Steve was coming over that night, so he had that going, which was nice.
Tony forced himself to look away and focus on his work. Soon enough he even forgot about Steve being there. His work was coming along quickly.
Huh, that wasn’t to bad. Then he touched the actual injury, first slowly, then a bit harsher - and cried out in pain. He was taking back every single one of his previous thoughts, this was awful and hurt like hell. Horrified he noticed that his eyes were swimming with tears. Stark men did not cry, damn it.
“Do you want something to drink?”, she asked him with a small smile. Tony gave a short nod and she helped him to a glass of water. The small sips were balsam for his sore throat.
7:48 shit he was running late! Tony grabbed his gift and left the workshop in a hurry. Outside he just realized he had forgot his jacket inside but there was no time to turn around again.
Steve stopped raising one eyebrow. Had he done something wrong? While Stark had been somewhat irritating, he didn’t seem to be a bad man. So what would he want?
“Shot”, Tony corrected him through clenched teeth. Banner moved to his side and fumbled with one of the IVs. A few seconds later Tony could feel the pain recede and gave him a small smile.
"So little Tony Stark is attending a common college like everyone he so despises of", Hammer laughed.
They somehow managed to get Steve back on the field, but he just couldn't concentrate on the game. When they were done finally he just grabbed his stuff and left.
When Tony's attempting to take everything out of the freezer and making the last preparations, Romanoff comes into the kitchen.
Tony mentally slaps himself. Do not come onto the random bakery employee. Do not take out your hangover no-filter tongue on the random bakery employee.
The dining room is buzzing with activity. Tony got first shower, and he sits back and watches as everyone takes their turn while Sarah and Paul make breakfast and everyone chatters and texts others and beam at Tony with their gifts. Tony’s own phone buzzes, and he glances at it.
He's Tony Stark, and he's Steve Rogers, and even when Tony's looking straight into Rogers's eyes, they are on completely different sides of the world.
“I’ll still get my ass kicked!” Mr. Wilson exclaims. He groans. “This is literally the worst situation ever. How could I let this happen? How could I be one of the initiators for this situation?”
While doing so, his gaze falls to a pile of papers that weren't there before. Looking through them, he huffs. Weapons designs. That he made while being drunk.
“Busy, busy, busy,” Tony tsks, standing. He waves away Ty's comprehensive look, pulling Rhodey to the side. Rhodey's eyebrows furrow.
Tony doesn't respond. He's minutely aware that she's still talking to him, but he really can't find it in himself to care.
Tony sighs. “I… Fine, okay, I wanted it to be a surprise, but whatever. I'm — I'm gonna get some gifts really quick, okay?”
Pepper fails to subtly rolls her eyes. “This is important, Tony. With the extensions we've been making to reach out to the public for the new StarkPhones, you need to attend — ”
Steve lets out a short laugh. “I try not to make it a habit. I promise, Tony, I'm not kidnapping you.”
“Hey,” Tony warns half-heartedly. “Don't you remember the Positive Action crash courses from last year?”
Steve’s holding his small card-shaped gift carefully, and his eyes fly to Tony, uncertain. Tony just smiles, though his own anxiety is clawing up his throat.
Sam groans. “He’s typing. Oh my god, I haven't been this nervous since sophomore year in high school when Keyana Leans offered me 'a fun time’.”
“You really expect us to be scared of two little girls and their big baby queer?” Cross laughs out. “Give me a break, man.”
The other three glance at him, looking away quickly. Vision makes the most human noise Peter's ever heard from him: “
Tony feels an itching feeling creep up his hands from where he watches. Oh, fucking hell. What if they don’t like them? What if they all simultaneously decide to trash them, and then kick Tony out in the snow? What if — Oh, god, what if Steve thinks his gift is ridiculous, and looks at Tony, like he’s seeing him for real, all of the nasty parts of him —
Tony's about to talk but the doorbell rings. Jarvis finishes wiping one section of the counter before disappearing to answer the door.
Tony blinks. Clears his throat. “That... Did not go as expected. Can I, uh, can I ask how you came to that conclusion?”
And there Steve was, back with his dorkiness and bravery and kindness and his fucking accent, walking around clumsily like he always did, this time just six inches taller and a hundred pounds of muscle heavier.
also, i wanted to post this before christmas, as there's still another christmas chapter, though i'm not sure whether it'll be released by then. either way, i hope you enjoyed this one!! tony's growth has just skyrocketed, hasn't it? :D
Tony looked up and Steve could see that his ears had turned red. His eyes were wide and he looked a lot more lively than a few seconds ago.
When he woke again he had missed an entire morning of watching TV, since he clearly fell asleep again mere seconds after going back to bed. By now the pain was reduced to a faint unpleasantness, but his discomfort with his body had grown. After taking a few minutes to wake up, he once again made his way to the bathroom and clumsily wet his face, using his left hand. Water drops were running through the abomination that had once been his goatee and he grabbed both shaving cream and a razor from one of the cupboards.
Steve smiled as he walked over to the table, Tony trailing behind him. The brunettes eyes widened taking in the sight of the set table.
Tony sat down at their little table and started watching Steve as he prepared their dinner. There wasn't much to prepare. Tony had insisted on pizza and Steve was slowly getting used to eating pizza almost every week.
Slowly his mood started to brighten up and he found himself humming the tune to one of his favourite songs. The shower was loud enough so he gave it a try. The next few minutes he spent with an awesome shower-karaoke-session.
“What do they want?”, he sighed. Right now he didn’t want to deal with anything; the least being some police officers asking stupid questions.
“That wasn’t a question”, Bucky answered, grinning. “Stevie is crushing on a billionaire after rescuing him. Like, you are his knight in shining armor!”
They then proceeded to watching a Christmas movie. Steve had actually got "The reindeer games" so they could watch it, but it left a bitter after-taste in his mouth thinking about Tony. He had thought they were friends.
“Buck, stop. I’ve seen him once, not gonna see him again. And that was all just work business. The case “Stark” will be closed once I finish writing this report.”
As Steve entered their apartment he could see light coming out from underneath Tonys door. So he was still awake... But he had explained earlier that he had some homework left, so Steve just went to his own room. After all they had only known each other for a few hours and it would do no good to start pestering him on their first evening.
"We thought about having a small christmas party in our dorm before the ones that visit their parents go home", Bruce told them, "so just some nice sit in, food and maybe some christmas movies next Friday."
“Interesting. Not as bad as you said, tho” Steve shrugged and placed the folder with his notes on his desk.
“That’s actually a really nice idea! You sure it won’t bother you? Or the rest?”, Steve asked, “Oh and also, he isn’t my boyfriend. I wish…”
“God, Tony, you alright?”, Steve asked and sat up. The other was lying on the floor next to him, trying to sit up but failing, soft moans escaping from his mouth. Then  he slumped down to the ground again, his left hand clenching into a fist.
“Put them on the kitchen table, we’ll first get you dry.” Steve told him and opened the door to a small but cozy looking apartment. They passed through the kitchen where Tony left the macaron bag on the table. In the bathroom Steve grabbed a towel and handed it to Tony.
“Even if I’m repeating myself, you should really cut it short for a few days. I don’t want you out of bed till Friday, alright? Also, please schedule a checkup with my secretary next week, I can’t always just leave the hospital as soon as you call me.”
“I’m working on a portable holographic device; already coded and developed everything in theory - now I just need to build it. This is where I need your help”, Stark…Tony told him and pulled out a blueprint that looked more complicated than anything Steve had ever seen. “Of course, I’ll walk you right through every step. Nothing complicated.”
How couldn’t he remember? Even though he wouldn’t admit it the guy had practically saved him. Well, after he saved himself, of course. And he could have been a bit faster. But - if you’re a beggar don’t be a chooser – he had at least done his job as well as (he wouldn’t admit that but from what Tony knew he had lost a LOT of blood) saved his life. All while looking like a human angel. Life was unfair sometimes.
“Is everything alright? As I recall I turned in all the paperwork on time”, Steve answered, looking confused.
Despite his angry voice, Steve started laughing. He had been called a lot of things after his growth spurt last summer, "dorito" wasn't one of them.
“Mr. Stark, you were shot a week ago. You can’t expect your body to heal in a few days. Patience is the key as well as taking proper care of yourself.”, Banner answered with a sigh, “If you ask me, you should have stayed in hospital a lot longer. Or at least stayed in bed.”
“What? That’s not the point here, officer.”. Stark threw up his arms. Or tried to do so, he gave out a small yelp and clutched his right shoulder, brows furrowed in pain.
Tony was in deep trouble, like, deeper that usually. He had only known the police officer for a week, met him two times (three if you counted their initial meeting, which Tony did not, he only counted meetings where he was conscious enough to flirt) and he already was crushing on this stranger he didn’t know anything about except that he was a police officer, an absolute pleasure to look at and kind. Well, he also knew that Rogers…Steve had a room mate and was good with his hands from what Tony observed while watching him work. His fingers were long as well as strong and his handshake had been firm but warm. Tony could still feel his finger tingling.
-You have a girlfriend, Tony, that's amazing. I really want to meet her! Let's go on a double date some time!!-
“Mister, if you would please put down the gun and tell me what happened here”, police hottie told him. Tony gritted his teeth, alright, he could do slow explanations for dumb officers.
They spent the evening chatting in the hallway until their resident shooed the all back to their rooms.
The campus store was away a 15 minutes walk from their dorm. He ended up buying at least ten different kinds of pizza (maybe Steve would like one or two), a dozen eggs, bacon, pop tarts, chips and an apple for good measurement.
“Dinner’s ready”, Steve told him while picking up the blanket, folding it and putting it back down on the couch. “How are you?”
The billionaire nodded, his eyes were closed again. Steve slid his other hand under Tony’s knees and picked him up in a bridal carry. He made his way over to the elevator with Tony in his arms, punched in the code and pressed the penthouse button. After a silent and quick ride, they reached the penthouse and Steve carried him over to the couch.
Clint spent some time admiring his muscles then he said: "So you're the prodigy coach told us about."
Yes, right. He still felt guilty because Steve took care of him instead of celebrating the victory with his friends after the game. And when the others asked him, if he would come, he had agreed.
"You spent the whole day locked in your room, working on something, let's have some fun once", Steve answered.
Starks PA turned nodded with a soft smile, then turned around and left Steve alone with the billionaire. Steve raised one eyebrow as Stark patted him on the shoulder with his good hand.
“Thank you for the amazing food and the great company”, the engineer told him as they were walking towards the elevator.
He didn’t remember a lot after that, just a warm and fuzzy feeling and when he woke again, he was in his bed. It took him a few minutes to figure out how he had gotten there, but Steve had left a note at the night stand.
"Yeah, you should definitely try it out!" Steve grinned while he mustered Thors upper body. He should have enough mass to tackle down everyone in his way.
God, the police officer was something else, something way to good for Tony to even consider taking for himself. But what could he say, he was a selfish man and Steve didn’t seem to be opposed to the idea of spending some time with Tony. Maybe even more.
“Be happy I don’t force you to attend board meetings”, Pepper called over the shoulder then exited through the elevator leaving Tony to himself.
She was wearing a very tight, very revealing cat costume. There wouldn't have been a big difference if she had just come naked.
“What about you project? It still isn’t finished, is it”, Steve asked with a frown. This situation was spiraling out of his control much faster than he would have liked.
"Also, we need to talk", Steve started. Tony froze in his thoughts, he had hoped Steve wouldn't say that.
“I’ll just…put on my clothes, thanks for lending me your stuff”, he told Steve, attempting to get up.
“I’m gonna leave you to yourself”, he told Tony as soon as he had helped him take off both brace and shirt, “try to not get those bandages too wet and call me as soon as you’re finished, so we can change them.” Then he left the bathroom and Tony alone with his thoughts.
He also bought some vegetables and tangerines. On his way home he noticed so many happy couples, cuddling and kissing under mistletoes that he started to feel bad again. Things only got worse when the single person approaching him was Justin Hammer.
The blonde apparently realized Tony was no longer paying attention to her, because when Tony looks down, she's gone. Tony blinks at Rumlow, then pushes him to the side, but Rogers is gone.
Thor doesn't smile at him when they pass each other on the field outside. Scott Lang continually throws tiny and sharp paper airplanes at him and his group during lunch until Coulson reluctantly tells him to stop. Gamora Titan calls him an asshole when she sees him. It's the first time she's ever talked to him. News travels fast.
That causes them to start an over-the-table brawl, that Tony swiftly moves his tray away from. Ty sends him a look.
Tony sighs. It's not like Steve or Natasha was rattling about him to Clint, so Clint must be after some information of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark. Tony layers on a charming grin.
Steve's sitting there in a nice, navy blue suit with a light grey button-down and his hair is all nice, and he's… He's beautiful. He's looking over the wine list, pink bottom lip between two rows of perfectly straight and white teeth, and his foot is anxiously tapping on the ground and... And he's waiting for Tony.
They lay down a thick layer of blanket before piling the pillows in the middle, and draping the rest of the blankets on the couch for people to grab. Tony hums satisfactorily at the image it presents. Steve nods in agreement.
It's like seventh grade. Rumlow's just poured an innumerable amount of glue on the tiny New Yorker kid. The kid's life is basically over.
“Did you seriously get punched again after Hodge gave you that black eye?” Lang blurts. “'Cause, honestly, even Steve doesn't get hit that often.”
“The third match is a woman named Mariah Gonzalez, aged forty-three, who lives in Manhattan, New York City. She's founded twelve orphanages throughout Mexico, seven homeless shelters throughout the southern American border, and five help centers of some kind throughout the east coast. In a span of only
“Yeah. Pretty much. So? This is me asking you if I can stay over at my stranger friend's house, mom.”
that was so long ago. But he, of course, can remember it like yesterday — and how he felt. It was just a few days before the whole Ultron mess started, and Tony had finally accepted one of Steve's offers of dinner. Steve had been ecstatic. It was after Tony's show of brilliance with the Mandarin and Steve's mess with Bucky and the fall of SHIELD, but even with all of that, Steve couldn't help but think of Tony. All the time. So he sent Tony an invite to a restaurant,
But now Hammer's hopping up and down, almost indiscernible, his face pulled in a nasty expression while he has his phone and Steve's Instagram post on his screen.
He steels himself, then walks over. Steve's face is a mixture of surprise, confusion, and something else that's harder to identify.
“Mr. Stark?” the same woman from before asks from behind him. “A group of the artists are in the main foyer if you would like to see some of the faces behind these pieces.”
“That’s bullshit, Carter,” he snorts and Tony feels his life breaking apart over the next few words. “Tony’s pranks on Rogers are the only thing that some people look forward to.”
As soon as he hangs up, Happy rolls his eyes. “I'm going to Barnes's first, don't get your panties in a twist.”
after all that Thanos stuff. Oh, no, Peter never should have done this, this isn't good at all, Mr. Stark's gonna
girls because of that stupid game, Spin the Bottle. The meeting with the engineers definitely could've gone better and Tony still hasn't been able to correct the code behind his first attempt at an AI. His parents promised a trip to California to visit Uncle Obie and the beach, but they still haven't visited, and with his mom in Germany and his dad working as much as he has been, Tony doesn't see the trip happening anytime soon.
Tony's heart starts beating rapidly in his chest. Rogers has tiny hints of red and blue in his hair, more emphasized because of the blonde background it's against. He has heavy bags under his bright blue eyes and he's not wearing his usual stark black jacket.
On Friday, Tony finally throws the cup away. Barnes and Wilson played a cute joke, but it wasn't that funny to Tony's pining heart.
At some point on his trek to the kitchen, a girl in a pineapple 'costume' — which consisted of a green bikini top and a yellow bikini bottom — apparently appreciated all the bare skin his costume presented, because she plastered herself to him and still hasn't let go.
“‘Busted. Barnes, Wilson, and Romanoff, I'm guessing? Do you guys often act like you're Rogers? -Rhodes, Banner, Parker & Vision’,” Nat reads aloud. “Bastards.”
Tony nods, still not looking back, though the remark sparks a smile on his face. “Right-o, captain. I forgot you had muscles as big as my head now.” When Steve doesn’t say anything in response, Tony worriedly looks behind him. “Steve?”
Tony leads Steve to his unit, lightly shivering in the cold. His unit is tucked deep in the lot, one of the units that are three times the size as the normal ones. Steve’s eyes widen at the sight of it.
Jarvis arches an eyebrow at that before turning back to his meal, and Tony looks back down at his phone. He goes back to the comment section, and there's already a multitude of comments, but none of Rogers's group says anything besides one more from Lang:
about you, Tony. Took a while but I know now. God, you're always letting them take over your life, and then you just —
There's a gasp somewhere in the room, and Sam's beginning to think that those are coming from Bucky.
Tony frowns, turning toward Jarvis, who carries a plate of food. “Dinner, already? Also, I resent the implication that I can't fix our fallen comrade.”
Steve sighs. “No alcohol, no drugs, no sex, and no physical fighting because of what happened to Bucky.”
Taking a glance at the comments, Rogers already had his share of probing words thrown his way, yet Tony finds a comment that Rogers bothered to respond to.
At the same time as she's telling Peter this, Mr. Wilson and Bucky walk over to the table. Peter now sees Mr. Wilson's sick expression, and he actually feels comforted that he's not alone.
And Tony, well. Tony's got a lot of things about him that no one at Marvel High, much more Timely, knows about him, and he doubts that'll change any time soon. He'll keep his own traits to himself, Jarvis, and his workshop, and he'll let Marvel High have the rumors about him fly anywhere they want.
Tony briefly raises an eyebrow. “Maybe. The only ass I've gotten tonight though is Cross's. Pull down your skirt, moron.”
Christmas music hums through the car, snow still gently falling against the windshield glass, as the unmistakable air of the holidays flitted through the air. Lights strung high on houses added to the feeling, and Tony felt —
Sarah rolls her eyes. “Steve Rogers, everyone knows who eats all of the butter pecan ice cream. And James Barnes, I placed that exile because you kept on daring Steve to fit himself into small locations, and the boy's stubbornness was getting him all kinds of bruises. Now, Stark,” she barks.
“Fuck, I'm gonna piss myself,” Rumlow's whispering to the table. “I can't wait to see his fucking face.”
Thor's already lightly snoring with a large arm draped across Bruce's thigh, Bucky has been leaning against Natasha, suspiciously quiet, for a while now, and Sharon's been dozing in and out up on the couch.
Steve makes a noise in the back of his throat. His eyebrows are furrowed further than Tony's ever seen them. His mouth is opening and closing around speechlessness.
“Christmas,” Tony blurts. Rogers furrows his eyebrows. “It’s Christmas Eve. What are you doing in a place like this?”
“Uh, nothing,” Tony manages to say. One of the man's flawless eyebrows arch. Oh, god. “Anyway — Hi. I'm Tony.”
Tony takes a step back. He hears himself distantly talking, but it's like he's hearing a conversation through a wall. “
Nonetheless, Jarvis looks incredibly upset and frustrated as he sees Tony off for Tony to do his SATs and some other state-issued exams that he'll miss out on. Tony waves him off.
Tony stiffens. Relaxes. “I’m not. But that's what people will expect. So calm down. What do you wanna do about Hammer?”
He keeps his eyes acutely focuses on his nails, so when Bucky slams the coffee cup on the counter, he jumps.
Well. Tony's spent nights with people he barely knows, most half-naked, before. This is hardly one of the worst situations.
being incredible to us by helping clear our names, preparing our move into the compound, and allowing us to live anywhere close to him. I'm not going to ruin that by letting my... Feelings get in the way. In addition, I — ” He inhales, sharply. “I understand where you're all coming from. Although I think you should've let
Sam's mouth forms an 'o’. “That’s your job. I pack the tupperware and clothes when Mom's not here, and you pack the presents.”
Sam shows them the woman, whose hazel eyes and dark skin pop. Natasha lets out a whistle, and the two men look at her, surprised. She shrugs.
Tony gives him a little grin. “Understandable. But I was actually going to ask if I could catch a ride with you. I'll call a driver in for both of us?”
Tony's jaw clenches. “I think the noodles were quite personal to Rogers's skinny little body back then.”
When he gets home, Jarvis has a meal ready for him. Two bites in, he runs to the bathroom to vomit. Jarvis watches him from the doorway. Tony reassures Jarvis that it really wasn't his lasagna, but Jarvis doesn't look reassured.
“How are you? Why weren’t you answering my calls? Where are you? Is Jarvis around?” Comes the barge of questions. “Let me talk to him, we need to — ”
Tony opens his mouth to argue, before an idea dings somewhere in his mind. Shaking his head, he smiles sweetly. “Okay, Steve.”
Peter nods in agreement. “Exactly. Honestly, Mr. Stark can get zero to a hundred matches, but that could be overnight or throughout next week.”
Tony sighs. “Agreed. But, Jarvis…” He gives a cursory look around, before continuing, “I'm kind of on the top of the world right now.”
Outside, he just shrugs. “I was thinking before one of the breaks, so we can get the best out of our hard work.”
Tony's eyes widen, mouth gaping open. Clint's on the side, obviously listening in, but finishing his order.
Vision steps up. “I believe what he is attempting to say is that we have found someone that we believe to make you very… Very
“He was my kitchen assistant, but I'm trading him out for Paul.” Sarah winks at Tony. Mr. Wilson laughs and follows her. “So, Paul, how's Darlene doing in Afghanistan?”
Natasha sighs. “All of that unresolved sexual tension that's been amounting for close to a decade is going to be used up, now. What were we thinking?”
Ty chokes on air. Tony bites his lip, eyes twinkling as he looks to Rogers, whose eyebrow is arched high. Rogers’ eyes catch his, and Tony's lips quirk up, just on one side. Rogers turns red.
, Tony thinks, and he starts to lean in when there’s a loud shifting noise — Sharon is turning on the couch above them, most likely to face their side.
Though Tony hadn't noticed it before, he can feel the room lose tension in indescribable amounts the more and more he expresses just how much his life is... a giant cluster of what the fuck.
“No! Steve — Steve, that argument can go on for days, okay, so let's just give it up,” Tony says, very responsibly. It makes Steve smile despite... Everything. “Just... What was the second reason? Why you were hesitant?”
Rogers is holding a little bag of M&M's to Tony. Tony stares at it, then stares at Rogers. Rogers blushes.
That's an entire other thing. Every year, without fail, since Steve Rogers came to Timely, Ty and the others look to Tony for the yearly prank of Tony. Who gives them one, smiling brightly, and then watches on the sidelines as they act it out — with Rumlow usually there to take the subsequent fist to the face.
Steve snaps his mouth shut. His cheeks darken. “Nothing is original anymore,” he argues faintly, smiling a bit.
like people with heart problems.” Sam says it. Natasha reaches behind her, grabs a roll of paper towels, and throws it at his head. Sam barely ducks in time.
“You'll see when you look over the answers at the end, okay?” Sam shudders. “Let's just move on, please.”
Ty finds his words. “Either way, we'll get infected with something,” he shoots. It's a solid insult, but calling Natasha Romanoff a slut? Not Tiberius Stone's best move.
Peter sighs. “It could take a while. This is a really fancy, private dating app, believe it or not, and they take their time pairing only compatible people. They also do background searches, but I already sent in a video of Mr. Stark talking about FlickLove, so they know he's actually him. See — He's got a little red check to his name to confirm his celebrity status.”
Steve pokes Tony harder. “Aw, c'mon, Tony, this time it's just a Christmas song, not a teenage girl bemoaning the loss of her boyfriend.”
“Sir, Mr. Rhodes has sent an... Expressive recording,” FRIDAY reports back. “Would you like me to play it?”
Stone pulled a bucket of divided paint colors out of his own locker while Tony broke into Steve — Rogers's locker. Tony ignored the prickling in his eyes as Rumlow took the colorful canvas out of his locker.
“I’m fine, Stevie-boy,” Tony exclaims, even though he's kind of swaying where he stands. “No one will hurt me here, really, unless I want them to!”
Shifting, Tony clears his throat. “So, uh. Sorry about this.” He vaguely motions to the pile of M&M packets in his arms.
Tony's sitting cross-legged on the couch with a slice of cheese when the Grinch's heart expands in his chest. He glances at Steve.
. She uh, she’s actually worked with Mhmm sometimes.” He gnaws his lip. “To be honest, I think she's the head of his prosthetics division.”
“Is — Is that an option?” Steve murmurs, then he seems to snap himself out of it. “Wait — No. No, we can
“Considering that this convention is the beginning of his work at Timely Comics,” Bucky starts, leaning casually against the counter. “A lot more, I'm thinkin'.” Tony deflates.
“Wow, that really smells amazing”, was the first thing he said, then yawned and sat up. The blanket slipped to the floor in a heap.
“Leave me alone”, Tony mumble, turning his head to the side just to avoid seeing the hurt look in Rhodey’s eyes. He knew he had both worried him and Pepper and it pained him that he was the cause of that. After a few minutes of silence he felt a hand settle on his right leg.
“Alright Mr. Stark let’s have a look at your arm”, Banner told him, making his way over to the couch.
"You don't need to, I already ordered new ones. Also you probably couldn't afford the frame anyway", the other - Anthony - answered.
The last time Steve had done the shopping so there was enough green stuff to make a soup. He stated chopping carrots and ginger while slowly roasting the onions. Adding the ginger he stirred a few times, then he poured water in the pot. Last he added the carrots. Now it had to sit for a while.
After he had wandered around campus for a bit, Steve found himself on the edge of the football field, as if an invisible force had dragged him there. He climbed up on the ranks and sat down somewhere in the middle.
Steve gulped. Okay, Stark was a lot to handle with him being a billionaire and one of the most influential people Steve met in his life and he didn’t know if this was still content with the compliance rule, but he felt his resistance crumble under Starks smile.
When he made his way around the corner of the narrow street he could see two figures sitting on the ground behind one of the containers - as well as the shine of a gun pointing at someone.
"We should draw names first before we eat the desert." Steve said. He was a little worried if everyone would be alright after eating Tony's mousse.
After taking his blood pressure ("90/50- It's a wonder he is still conscious!"), his pulse and body temperature ("91.4 °F- We have to get him warm again quickly!") the nurse disappeared and the doctor took a look at Tony's ankle.
He woke to the steady beeping of a heart monitor and needed a few seconds to process where he was and what had happened.
“Dr. Banner will be here in a few minutes”, he told Tony who gave him a small smile, “try to sleep a little”.
“Mister, if you would please put down the gun and tell me what happened here”, he answered, trying to stay calm. This was the most unusual situation he had even encountered in the last 5 years of working for the NYPD.
After a short silence he added: "I can always work on DUM-E though. I think I'm going to have a big breakthrough soon, so I might spent some time in the lab. They have the necessary tools over there. What about you?"
"Did you plan on eating all of them, friend?" A big guy with a European accent asked. "Yeah..." Tony didn't want to explain his irregular eating habits so he nodded to his roommate.
He threw his screwdriver on the bed and got up. Maybe cooking something would get his mind off that guy. He opened the fridge. Nothing. Well, then shopping. Maybe he should just skip the cooking part and get a pizza...
"So Tony must have been my secret Santa." Steve sighed. No present for him. To be honest, he was a little disappointed.
He left Tony on the couch, making his way over to the kitchen area. Looking through the cupboards he found everything better stacked, then he would have thought. Tony didn’t seem like someone who would really cook for himself. Deciding on a pasta dish, he started collecting the ingredients and went on to cooking. A loud snore from the couch told him that Tony was fast asleep. He smiled softly. While being a genius in science, taking care of himself clearly wasn’t the engineer’s strong suit. Waiting for the water for the pasta to start boiling, he pulled out his mobile to message Bucky.
Wow, Steve mused, Bucky had said the guy was a genius, but Stark couldn’t even remember to not use his right arm. He sighed.
Suddenly Tony heard a loud bang, making his ears ring and he felt his shoulder and arm being engulfed in pain he couldn’t really process. What he could process, tho, was that both he and thug-guy were lying on the ground and he was clutching the gun in his right hand. Which he couldn’t feel anymore.
I'm really sorry to tell you that we won't be able to grant your requests, as this fic is already finished and we won't edit it (Kate is working a full time job, I'm studying for my first big exam in med school- no time left for anything like this).
"Both Tasha and me are sophomores so we have already joined clubs last year. I'm on the football team and Tasha does material arts." Clint explained.
Tony woke up while he was tucking him in. He just opened his arms and Steve took that as a gesture to climb into bed with him and hold him warm.
Both Natasha and Steve would stay at the dorm since they had no parents to visit left. Clint would go on a vacation with his boyfriend.
Shoot. He could deal with finding someone attractive, wanting to take him to bed. But Steve was different, a good but dangerous different.
“Tony, I’m here with Captain Rogers from the NYPD”, Mrs. Potts called and Steve heard footsteps approaching.
“Sir, I was told by my boss you requested to see me. I must remind you that the NYPD isn’t comprisable even if you send us money.”
After that weekly movie nights became a thing, even though they always spent hours fighting about the movies to watch.
Also from next weekend on I'll be on vacation for two weeks :D Sadly that means no new chapters till I'm back.
“I don’t think this is a good idea”, Steve answered and saw the brunettes face fall. This was for the best, he reminded himself. Just not to rush anything, also Bucky would be waiting for him “You know, I have food at home and I promised my roommate to cook today.”
"Stop worrying about such stupid things," Steve answered, "I'm so happy you are alright or going to be, you just need to rest for a few days."
As nobody answered him Steve opened the door. He was met with the sight of utter chaos. Wires and other electrical looking things were spread all over both desk and bed. And Tony was sitting in the middle of the mess, headphones on and hadn't even noticed Steve. Slowly he closed the door again. It seemed like Tony was absorbed in his work and not to be bothered.
"That looks like a sprain to me. I'll wrap it up and you shouldn't put too much weight on it for a couple of days."
“Wait what? Your body is like the American dream”, Tony intervened. Steve couldn’t help but laugh, feeling a bit self-conscious. He scratched his head.
"As long as you want ME to be your model." Tony answered, emphasizing the "me" as if he couldn't believe someone found him worthy of drawing.
"Oh, Stark. You finally left your garbage bin of a flat", Hammer greeted him, "How is lover-boy doing? Alright, I forgot he has a girlfriend. Such a pity he doesn't like you."
“Tony, you alright?”, he asked worried. The engineer’s eyes snapped open again and he grabbed onto the sink to stabilize himself.
