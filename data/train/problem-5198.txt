Cas’ eyes sparkle. “Thank you, Dean.”
He’s been grooming Dean for taking over as CEO since he was old enough to hold a wrench. Dean thinks Sam would probably be a better choice, but the kid has never wanted anything to do with the company. So Dean put on a suit, went to college, got a business degree (along with his automotive mechanic certification on the side), and started working for Winchester Motors right out of school.
“Perhaps he and Jo can trade off those hours.”
Dean frowns. “Sounds like the good life.”
The bell dings and, sure enough, it’s not a customer who walks through the door. It’s Dean, followed by Benny and Dean’s secretary, Anna. Cas makes the briefest note of the other two people before the haggard look on Dean’s face catches his attention. That, along with the fact that Dean isn’t scolding him about Jack not being in sight (he’s in the back), consumes him with worry.
“I promise,” he vows softly.
Later that night, as Cs readies himself for bed, Anna appears in his doorway.
The bosses seem to realize that they have an audience at the same time. They don’t pull away from one another, but they straighten, and Mr. W glares out at all of them playfully.
- Also, I don't know a damn thing about how doctor's offices in the 1820s would have operated. I did very little research on it, but here's my best guess.
Cas’s mile is tiny, mostly in his eyes, but it bowls Dean over. “Oh, I don’t know,” he says airily. “Not all alphas smell all that bad.”
done farmwork, but he can hardly tell Cas that he was playing at being a farmboy for several weeks to rip off a rich plantation owner (and, with wicked delight, take the man’s omega son’s virginity). Instead, he latches onto the rest of what Cas said.
“Ah.”
“Your husband is a man of principle,” she tells Castiel. “I mean that as a terrible insult.”
Dean leans down to kiss him hard, murmuring, “I’ll just bet you did, you sap,” against his mouth.
Joshua was a kind, loving soul. Gentle in all things, in touch and manner and voice, he was everything Naomi has never been. He was, quite simply, everything a frightened, aching, absolutely clueless young man on the run had needed.
He changes the angle of his thrusts one more time, striking Dean’s prostate. Dean starts to cry out as much as he can with his fangs sunk into Cas’ neck, and Cas clamps his own jaw down as he feels his own orgasm start to crest.
- Dean Winchester, smooth like crunchy peanut butter.
“Well, they don’t have you, of course.”
Dean still has visions of Cas dancing in his head when he walks into the office a couple of hours later. Cas’ hair,
“I suppose,” Naomi says dryly, “it’s too much to hope for that you have seen the error of your ways and have come to join me.”
Dean snorts unattractively
Finally, after a million years go by, Dean slumps. “Dammit, Cas.”
Castiel finally finds Dean smoking behind the equipment shed. His shoulders are hunched, his face dark, and his eyes are red and wet. His hands tremble minutely when he brings the cigarette to his lips.
Castiel has made a more concentrated effort to blend in with humanity with dark jeans, a simple button-up, sneakers, and his favorite trench coat. Not the
“About family business.”
Possible BPD (drastic and violent mood swings.)
Anger makes Dean’s heart rate pick up, and he knows he’s unable to keep at least some of it from bleeding into his voice. “The sixty hours a week I’ve put in for the past five years hasn’t convinced them? What about the Sandover merger? It would have
A small, shaky voice calls out, “Papa? Alpha?”
Dean makes a face and Anna smiles sympathetically. “Sorry,” she says again.
afraid that time away will make Cas tell him to hit the road.)
When Dean let him know that he’d have to go into town to mail Sam’s letter, Cas told him that he would hear gossip and rumors. He told him that, especially since Michael disappeared, no one in town has been overly concerned with whether or not Cas can hear them when they talk about him.
It looks to Dean like the entire senior class is here. He smirks, watching from the corner as all of his rich, uptight, preppy classmates finally loosen up a little and become real people for a while.
“Ellie,” Charlie hears him say, “how are we looking?”
Lucifer’s husky voice is earnest, eager as he waves for them to sit at the meeting table in the middle of the room. They do so warily, all of them on one side and Lucifer on the other.
“Cool with it,” Gabe replies without taking his eyes off of the Vegas strip. “Honestly, I think I love this guy. What a great way to live.”
“I’m telling you true, pup,” Dean says solemnly, looking into Claire’s doubtful eyes. “I’ve had bread from all around, y’know, I’ve done a lot of travelling, all up and down the country. And this?” he says, gesturing with the hunk of bread that’s accompanying his breakfast, “is the best bread I’ve ever had.”
Dean kisses him again, unable to contain himself. “We’ll just sleep, darlin’,” he whispers huskily. “Nothing else, I swear it.”
this), he doesn’t know if he could betray Cas for Sam, either.
Castiel thinks
As he’s drying the last plate, he hears a very soft, “Oh,” barely heard over the sounds of Claire playing.
Though they married to lend credence and strength to a merger, John and Mary Winchester truly adored one another. They had the kind of happy marriage that embarrassed their kids and friends alike. They
He’s just so
just weird. Crain Veterinary is where Mr. W and Mr. N take their dogs, and why would they be calling if nothing was wrong?
“You were a very easy patient,” the omega assures him as he watches long, thin, capable fingers treat his injured leg.
Castiel sighs. “I’m sorry.”
He only gets to pretend he’s not watching his boyfriend from the corner of his eye before Dean speaks.
A few good-natured groans meet Castiel Novak’s request, but he ignores them with long practice.
Lucifer winks. “You ever need someone to show you the ropes, I’d be happy to. It’s been a long time since I had a vampire hanging around.”
“Indeed.”
Only long practice keeps the growl off of Dean’s face and out of his voice. “Yessir, it is.”
“But fear is so
Cas orders a few sandwiches to be delivered from a local sub shop while the others start to set up the bar. It’s still a few hours early, but they can pull stools off of the tables and roll any extra silverware they anticipate needing. Cas insists they all sit at a table and eat. Again, no one argues.
“Of course,” she says softly. “Of course.”
He vaguely remembers setting Zeke and Meg up to sleep on his couch, piling it high with blankets. He supposes that it makes sense that he would have hugged Zeke, too. Cas hugs
Cas smiles, and his own voice is deeper than usual when he replies with a rasp, “Always.”
He wants to, he
Dean knows Cas isn’t talking about the sex. “I love you, too. And believe me, it was my pleasure.”
Dean can feel his orgasm building at the base of his spine and his knot starting to grow. He won’t knot Cas, not like this, not for their first time. He desperately wants Cas to come first, however, wants to feel him rippling around his cock.
Dean is well aware that Cas is probably already back in the house. The bedroom door is wide open, he’ll be able to hear them easily.
“Good night, pup. Sleep tight.”
In short, Castiel is the precise combination of physical features that have been known to get Dean to do stupid,
“Because of the… Deal.”
Each piece of fabric, whether it’s clothing, towels, or a bolt of material, has a note pinned to one corner. After insisting she be extra careful not to prick herself on the pins, Dean lets Claire bring him a few pieces at a time so he can sort them into piles. The embroidery requests range from simple (initials placed in the corner of a handkerchief), to quite elaborate (a flowering vine along the hem of a dress). Each of them has a date on them, which Dean assumes is the date that the order was placed. He stacks them with the newest requests on the bottom and the oldest on top, although the oldest requests are only a week old, which is astonishing considering how much work is there. Another reason to be impressed with the omega, Dean supposes.
Dean stares at the closed door for a while, puzzling it out. He’s been a conman long enough that he knows his story and his scent didn’t give him away. There’s no good reason for Castiel to think Dean is anything other than a trader who’s meeting his brother at the river.
“It’s… Well, it’s about Nick.”
“And the best part,” Cas continues, “is that our big, strong alpha would
“You don’t-”
He works to even out his breathing as he listens to Dean move around in their bathroom. A drawer opens and closes, the cabinet door swings shut, and the water goes on and off a few times before Dean comes back into the bedroom.
“Okay, we’re probably going to need a little bit more to go on than that,” Sam says.
Castiel breaks off his conversation with Kevin as Sam reaches them, and Dean sits up.
It’s too dark to tell if Cas is blushing, but Dean is a betting man, and he thinks his omega’s cheeks are a rosy color right now. It’s driving his inner alpha wild.
Cas cries, horror gripping his heart, but Zeke doesn’t have the chance to hurt the dog before he’s been knocked onto his back. The gun flies out of his hand and skitters to a stop near the baby clothes rack. Colonel is standing on Zeke’s broad chest, snarling and baring his teeth, claws digging into the man’s shoulders. Zeke watches him with wild eyes, but the moment he tries to move, Cas whimpers, and Colonel snaps his teeth shut just a hair's breadth away from the tip of his nose. After that, Zeke stays still.
He points to Adam and barks, “You!”
“You agree to marry me for at least one year. That should be plenty of time for me to secure my position.”
Cas grunts, but doesn’t otherwise respond, and Dean grins.
“Wouldn’t miss it for anything, gorgeous.”
They’re taking advantage of the rare opportunity presented by Cas’ whole family being out of the house to have sex somewhere other than the backseat of the Impala.
Dean’s eyes widen in horror. “Oh, my God, I didn’t even ask if you’re interested in men. Listen, you can-”
“I’m signed up for remote classes for next semester, and Charlie says that doing that for the semester after won’t be a problem. Sammy and Bobby know, and Sam’s teaching the old man how to Skype. Benny and Ash think I’m studying abroad.”
“Dean.” His voice is thick. “If I were to lose control, if I were to
Mary smiles, flicks the light off, and quietly shuts the bedroom door.
“‘Sup, this is The Bunker.”
“Thank you, Anna,” he says, voice low and heartfelt. “That means a lot to me.”
“Like I said, I’m looking for Dean Winchester.”
“You’re not going anywhere, Dean Winchester,” Cas says firmly. “You’re not going anywhere, or leaving coin behind for us, or explaining
“Cassie, don’t you think we’ve gone over it enough?” Gabe Shurley asks, slumped in his chair dramatically. The drama is only undercut a little by his lime-green Hawaiian shirt and orange bicycle shorts. “We’ve been here for
Cas arches a dark eyebrow. “I have a feeling you don’t plan to stick around here, anyway. I’m not terribly concerned.”
“I know that this is… Unconventional, and completely out of left field, and I’m pretty desperate, but I want you to get something out of this, too. What I’m proposing will be mutually beneficial, I won’t lie, though, you’d be doing me a pretty big favor.”
Balthazar, however, has proven to be an excellent teacher. Under his watchful eye, Dean has become quite proficient in a wide array of bladed weapons. Balthazar says he’s a fast learner, Dean says it’s easy stuff, and Cas thinks it’s unbearably attractive.
“It won’t… It doesn’t make it any better, but we never took from anyone who couldn’t spare it. If we could manage it, we rarely took from anyone who would even notice. But I know that doesn’t help, I just… Want you to know that I was
John knows damn well that Dean’s bisexual, he just doesn’t
Cas blinks. “Really?”
He accepts the paperwork from Anna, sets it and his briefcase on his desk, and leads Benny down the hall to his father’s office. He’s keyed up, wondering if this is
Charlie loves The Pack like they’re her own. She doesn’t have kids yet, though she wants them fiercely, and she can’t have pets in her apartment, so she’s imprinted
Cas goes back out after midday. He admonishes both Dean and Claire firmly about overworking themselves, makes them both promise to stay indoors, and finally leaves, deeply suspicious of the easy agreements he receives.
“You must know,” Castiel continues. “I have been hiding this from you for long enough. You wanted to know, and I will tell you.”
Cas finally looks up to see Sam sitting at one end of their dining room table with books, pens, papers, and folders scattered around him. His shaggy hair is wild, going in every direction in a mess that rivals Cas’ own constant bedhead. The poor boy has circles beneath his eyes and his shoulders are tight with tension, but the disgusted face he makes at the two of them is genuine.
There is so much left to concern him. The Lightbringers, though they are without their guiding force, still need to be tracked down and dealt with. Dean, though he has taken to immortality remarkably well, is liable to spiral now that they do not have a set, definable goal to work toward. Castiel, himself, is probably going to need
Firmly, he says, “Zeke, we haven’t been biding our time for anything.”
“You’ll find a way to live,” Cas says dryly. He’s given up the fight about the book thing.
It doesn’t hurt, of course, that Dean looks so damn good out of those suits and in Cas’ space.
Upon an explanation, Bobby rolled his eyes and told Sam to suck it up. Not that he didn’t have cause to be upset and scared, but if he was going to be mad at Dean, he would have to become angry with Bobby himself, too. When faced with that prospect, Sam instead calmed down, let go of his anger, and insisted he be allowed to help with the Lightbringer research.
“Good. Got a job yet?”
When he was younger, Dean’s favorite Cas was naked Cas. All that pale, smooth skin, his to touch and kiss and mark up? It was no contest.
His omega is a
“This was you,” he says quietly. A statement, not a question.
“It’s Sam, and all work and no play is gonna make Sam a lawyer,” Sam corrects without looking up.
Dean blinks. “Embroidery, do you mean? And tailoring.”

“... No? Like… To protect me? Or something?”

“We belong in the darkness,” Lucifer says, surprising Cas, “it’s why the light burns us.”
from the back room is followed by a surprisingly loud, fierce snarl. A streak of brown and black fur flies by Castiel and lunges at Zeke before he can properly react.
They only make it a few blocks before they hit wall of negative emotion so thick it almost stops Castiel in his tracks, steals breath he doesn’t really need from his lungs.
“And another thing? Mr. N and Mr. W are solid. That’s the wrong damn tree to bark at.”
“... Okay?”
She’d texted him to thank him, and there began a wonderful friendship she wouldn’t give up for anything. When he’d text her, years later, about needing a server at a bar where he’d make certain she was protected, Anna already would have done almost anything for Castiel.
Not that she would, of course.
Castiel recognizes the changes in Naomi’s stance. Though he had many a tutor over the years, trained under many fighters under several forms of combat, his first teacher in violence was the creature before him.
Cas whines again and Dean adds another finger, stretching Cas a bit to account for his own girth. He’s not the

and Cas is…
That, along with Mary’s approval, is all John needs.
Cas comes back in after checking on the cow and Impala for the last time before bed. Dean tries to hide the fact that his inner alpha is perking up happily and drops his hand away from his face. Apparently, however, he’s not fast enough.
Cas is mumbling softly against his shoulder and Dean takes the opportunity to lift his head to blink blearily at the alarm clock. As soon as the numbers register, he stiffens in surprise.
Cas hums again, eyes tracing down Dean’s body in a way that makes him shudder. “Well, the offer is open, I don’t have enough beautiful things to look at during the day.” Cas smiles again before looking back down at his paperwork. Almost absently, he murmurs, “You could open your own shop, maybe. Work on cars all day. You

“Little one,” he whispers in Claire’s ear, “what’s wrong, little love?”
- Cliffhanger! I'll try not to leave you guys hanging for too long!
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean ruffles her hair, and Cas watches in bewilderment as his gentle, softspoken little sister blushes and giggles as she bats his boyfriend’s hand away.
Castiel feels as if he’s been suspended in time, in space - all he can do is stare at the young man, lost in awed indecision.
“He’s just in the back.”
Cas was right. Dean hates it here.
never would have let something like that happen to Needs Must. I know how much you love it, and that bastard husband didn’t even know something was wrong until Gabriel called him.”
Though John is a wizard under the hood, he’s never been as comfortable sitting behind a desk. He’s done a passable job of it, along with the board, and their rate of growth has remained steady and sustainable, if not remarkable.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean murmurs, soft enough that it doesn’t disturb the cloud of contentment Cas is floating in.
He shudders again when Dean sinks in one last time, as deep as he can go, so deep Cas can feel his cock pulsing as he fills Cas with come. Dean moans, long and loud, and leans his forehead on Cas’ shoulder while he wraps one arm around Cas’ waist to keep him tucked up close.
Dean nods. “Yeah, for sure, but it is what it is. The problem is that I’m not in a relationship right now, and I definitely don’t have anyone lining up to marry me.” That nervous smile hits Castiel right in the heart again. “That’s where you come in, Mr. Novak.”
“Then, out of nowhere,
noticeable outfit, maybe, but certainly less so than Gabe’s.
Dean can’t stand it any longer. He tries to move slowly, to be as delicate as he has been before, but the kiss he presses to Castiel’s luscious mouth is passionate and wanting without his express consent.
“Whatever you say, babe,” Dean says easily. He flops down onto the pillow, then tugs Cas until his back is flush against Dean’s chest. Now that Dean is a vampire, too, he isn’t quite as burning hot as he used to be against Cas’ skin. It’s better now, more comfortable. He’s warm, and his arm is firm when it wraps around Cas’ waist, holding him close.
Dean nods. “That’s a darned good way of thinking.”
She snorts. “You’d be right. Missouri Moseley, head nurse, at your service, Dr. Smith.”
with that, and he really is more than happy to give Cas whatever he needs, but he does need to angle his hips away from Cas to make sure the omega doesn’t feel pressured or awkward or-
“It doesn’t matter.”
They hit the grocery store before lunch. Cas decides that he feels well enough to leave The Colonel at home, but he sticks real close to Dean as they navigate the aisles.
“I will never believe that humans are less than us,” Castiel says, firm in his conviction. “And I will always see vampires as monsters.”
It is short and brutal, when Castiel tears Uriel’s throat out with his teeth. Excessive, maybe, and a bit dramatic, but he is immediately appeased when the blood too pale and thick to be human pours sluggishly down Uriel’s chest. Thick, wet choking sounds come from the other man’s mouth before Castiel reaches out and casually tears Uriel’s head from his body.
No one is certain what John and Mary Winchester did to get their sons into Pontiac Prep, but it couldn’t have been wholesome. Castiel isn’t convinced that it was even as simple as bribery. He thinks it may have been something much… Darker.
believe that I don’t want to do this, but I need you to put your hands where I can see them, Castiel.” The voice sounds like it’s coming from underwater.
- Did Cas just make a dick joke at his FIL? Yes. Does Cas regret it? Not a chance.
“... Okay. Wanna elaborate?”
The real shock, Castiel supposes, is that Joshua’s head is lying a few feet away from his body. Castiel is fervently grateful that Joshua’s face is turned away so that all he can see is the back of his mentor’s head.
- This chapter brought to you by my husband, who danced with me in the kitchen to
A slightly sharper
She nods. “I just…” She seems to brace herself. “This is stupid, but I just wanted to tell you that I really like Dean, and I think you’re really good together.” She speaks so fast the words bleed into one another, but Cas understands her perfectly.
- One step forward, one step back, one step sideways just to keep everyone on their toes.
“I overheard Mom and Dad talking.”
Right after he pours the coffee into the boiling water, he hears a door open behind him. He turns, intending to greet Cas and defend his motivations if need be, but his mouth dries up before he an when he lays eyes on the omega.
He didn’t anticipate that he would be completely
He surges up and wraps his arms firmly around Dean, holding him close. Now that they’re evenly matched for strength, every time Dean lets Cas hold him means more.
Three perfect children and Castiel.
She has been friends with a lot of coworkers, of course. It's hard not to be when you're in the trenches of food service anywhere from twenty to sixty hours a week. A lot of places form a sort of family atmosphere, and she's made some lifelong friends that way.
Donna Hanscum-Mills beams at Gabe from where she sits on her wife’s other side. “Aw, you like it, or you wouldn’t be here.”
Gabe’s eyes are sparkling even as they roll in his head. “As much fun as it would be to watch you two break some laws, and it
Finished eating, he makes his way home.
Dean shrugs, and Castiel doesn't believe the nonchalance for a moment. They don't look at one another, still pressed cheek to cheek, still swaying slowly to the music.
Dean is outright frowning. “Where is this coming from?”
The anger in Dean’s voice is like ice, sinking into Castiel’s limbs and chest and making him shiver and ache. The surge of victory disappears completely in its wake. He turns to look at his boy, though he looks more like a man now than he ever has.
Dean keeps the gun pointed at Zeke, but he comes to Cas and uses his free arm to crush him close. Cas goes, shuddering and wrapping trembling arms around Dean’s neck. He buries his face in his husband’s shoulder and clings.
“It’s not much…” Cas said, hesitant in that way he gets when he doesn’t know how Dean will respond to something.
he thinks to himself firmly.
Dean brings their hands up so he can press a kiss to Castiel’s knuckles. “I love you, too.”
you, Castiel,” Zeke says earnestly. “I know it’s been a very long road, and I think you’ve been very cruel, making me wait for you this long, but I forgive you. We can be together now! We can leave now, start somewhere new, and-”
life in his arms, Castiel can do little but laugh, and be grateful that he had the foresight to take that invitation offered to him by a rug so long ago.
- I know that it's kind of confusing with Charlie referring to them as Mr. W and Mr. N, but that's how she thinks of them, so... You know. Sorry.
Gabe’s cheer makes all of them jump in their seats.
beat. “Oh, okay. That’s okay. Um, what do you want?”
It’s Dean’s turn to scowl. The man is an alpha, and the blatant challenge to his attack is going to pis him off something fierce. There’s no guarantee that he’ll chase Dean now, injured or no.
Cas frowns in confusion. It’s not a new feeling, since Dean often says things that confound him, but this doesn’t seem to be a reference to a movie. “Pardon?”
Dean likes to think he’s a pretty laid-back boss. He’s not strict about start times, and he frequently lets the crew go home early if it’s a slow night. There’s no dress code. He doesn’t mind Bal cooking dinner for the crew if he has time. He’s generous with time off, or at least he tries to be.
“What’s wrong? You don’t bark at customers.”
“Uh… What? No.”
He goes through the formality of asking permission to leave the classroom, but a formality is all it is. He’s going to find Dean, come hell, high water, or detention The teacher lets him go without a fuss, he assumes, because no one shouts at him as he leaves, but he doesn’t actually care.
Dean wraps Cas up in his arms and holds him, too tired to keep his eyes open but not too tired to nuzzle sleepily at the back of his neck.
Everyone likes Nick. He’s friendly, smart, funny, and handsome. He fits in with everyone here, and his first two weeks go by very smoothly. Everyone likes Nick.
No vampires are burned by the sunlight or affected by garlic or crucifixes. He would agree with the idea that these ideas were fabricated by humans to give them a sense of safety, but quite frankly, so very few vampires prey on humans at all that it makes no sense that they would
It’s only a moment or two before Dean covers Cas’ mouth with his own, swallowing Cas’ whimpers and cries as they get louder and longer. With one hand he holds himself braced above Cas, and the other he holds Cas’ hip in a firm grip, keeping the omega exactly where he wants him as he pounds into him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I do, really. But Dean, you are not what you do. Or, at least, you are not what you have done in the past. I have never seen you be anything but gentle and kind. The way you care for myself and Claire, the way you plan for our future.”
“I travelled the world, sometimes with Gabriel, sometimes not. I met Balthazar during…” He frowns. “One of the world wars, anyway, and we became friends. He and Gabriel, I’m sure you can imagine, got on very well immediately. The three of us, we’ve been through much together and apart. Mostly, the last few decades, it’s been apart, unless one of them was in trouble.

The flu has swept through Pontiac Prep with a viciousness that has felled around half of the student body. Cas has somehow managed to keep himself healthy, but Dean folded like a cheap lawn chair. He’s been sick for a few days now, and though Castiel thinks they’re on the other side of the worst of it, his poor boyfriend is still miserable.

easy to have yourself an accident? Perhaps-”
“Cas, look, I… I know this isn’t what you agreed to. And that’s okay, I didn’t know that- wait, no, that doesn’t matter. This isn’t what you agreed to, and I don’t want you to feel…
“Thank you, Charlie. We’d be lost without you.”
“Imagine my surprise, then, when the pastor who kept the church was a vampire, too.
Castiel smiles and wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, savoring the automatic way Dean leans into him. “When did you become so level-headed and reasonable?”
He scratches at his jaw for what feels like the fortieth time in an hour. It’s been a long time, too, since he went more than a day or two without shaving, and the itching is driving him mad.
It’s Lucifer’s turn to blink. “Oh. Okay. What’s up, guys?”
Cas says, voice severe even though he’s smiling at Dean’s side, “that’s all right with you, Aam.”
darlin’,” Dean drawls. He runs a hand from Cas’ knee
Claire has gotten into the habit of darting back and forth and picking a combination of wildflowers, weeds, and long grasses seemingly at random. She gathers them into a bundle and wraps another long bit of grass around the middle. She’ll carry it around for a few hours until it gets left somewhere around the farm. It’s pretty damn cute, if Dean has anything to say about it.
With no more ado than a strong sweep of his arm, he beheads his mother.
Cas’ smile widens impossibly. “And I, you, Dean.’
It’s a relief when they reach the address Balthazar gave them. The warehouse is derelict, which is no more than Castiel expected. It’s close to mid-day, but a carport has been erected right in front of the door to the warehouse, so Dean pulls the Impala under the shade it offers and turns her off.
Cas thinks as he slowly, so slowly, puts his hands up in the air around his head and turns to face the intruder.
Dean frowns harder. “Uh… Why?”
The crowd around him is politely clapping, but fuck that. Plus, even if he’s not here to fight with Cas’ mother, there’s no sense in passing up a chance to irritate the piss out of her.
As he steps out of the post office, intent on getting right back on Impala and riding out of this hellish little town, there’s an alpha he doesn’t recognize standing next to her. Impala is smarter than most horses (smarter than most men, really), and a big one at that, so Dean is not particularly concerned that she is going to be harmed or stolen. She’s alert but relaxed, aware of the invader to her personal space, but not panicked or worried. Dean takes his cue from her, since she’s never steered him wrong, and keeps his posture as non-threatening as possible.
he adds, a beat too late and with a sneer.
He thinks blearily of his parents. Despite a life of crime, John and Mary Winchester were both taken by yellow fever a few years ago in a hospital in Arkansas. The last letter he has from his mother forbade him or Sam from coming to see them, lest they get sick or (even worse, in Mary Winchester’s mind) blow their cover. In the end, it didn’t matter. John and Mary were dead and buried before Sam and Dean managed to get to the hospital, anyway.
The Pack, and what if something’s wrong?
He knocks on the door and waits for his father’s invitation before coming in. Benny takes up position outside and gently pulls the door close behind Dean. He wonders if it’s kosher to suggest a raise for the man.
Cas groans and wraps a hand around the back of Dean’s neck to pull him back down. It never occurs to Dean to protest, he just moves until he’s lying on his back with Cas sprawled sleepily over him.
As surely as Dean himself does.
For all that Castiel has dealt with their attraction by ruthlessly trying to control both himself and Dean, Dean has just
Cas widens his legs to let Dean stand between his knees in front of him. Dean’s hands tremble with pain and fury when he cups Cas’ face. Cas lets the ice pack fall away, giving Dean the rest of the picture
Claire cheers softly and runs to do as she’s told. As soon as she’s out of the room, Dean opens his mouth to say gods know what to Cas. Maybe he wants to apologize? Explain, maybe, that Claire might just be feeling a bit clingy, or that-
He’s still reeling from the meeting with his father. The whole thing feels surreal, like a vivid dream (or nightmare). And he knows that he’s also struggling with the idea of John

like a win last night, but he can’t seem to convince himself that it was genuine in the hours that follow. Does Cas really want Dean’s help, does he believe that Dean will stick around after he’s healed? Or is he just humoring Dean? Does he think, perhaps, that Dean is just spouting out pretty lines that might warrant him a better treatment while he’s here on Cas’ farm (not that Dean can think of a better way to be treated)? Dean doesn’t really blame Cas for thinking that way, if he is. It’s obvious that Cas’ history has left deep scars, not just physically, but emotionally on both he and Claire.

Dean kisses his temple lightly and wraps an arm around Cas’ waist to bring him close. “All right, all right,” he grumbles. “Only for you, gorgeous.”
Dean moans softly and kneads Cas’ thighs, but does nothing to attempt to control Cas’ movements.
As Sam asks, Gabe seems to materialize in the doorway from the kitchen wearing a floor-length silk robe and giant fuzzy bunny slippers. Despite what he’s wearing, the stress of the last day shows itself in his face, in the tightness he carries around his eyes and at the corners of his mouth. He grips his coffee cup too tightly, and his eyes meet Cas’ as Sam asks his question.
Castiel may have an iron grip on her son, but Dean is holding onto Castiel just as tightly. The control Castiel has is mutual, a bond between the two of them that is not easily understood by others, but no less powerful from lack of understanding.
“Ballsy?”
He gestures to his leg, stuck out at an awkward angle to relieve pressure on his wound. “Well, I’ll need help helping your papa, won’t I?”
be submissive, and he certainly has never thought so with the way his mother raised him, but they’re usually a
Cas smiles faintly. “She despises when you pick me up for school.”
“It is,” Dean says, an absent sort of horrified wonder in his voice. “It’s because I married a man. Because I didn’t settle down with a pretty blonde and have two-point-five kids. It’s because of Cas.”
He will stand with Dean, free of judgement either way, but this must be Dean’s decision alone.
“-talked about-”
through the all-consuming fear that seems to be eating him alive, much less feel angry about Dean’s damn car. There’s a sound, a sort of scritching coming from the back room. Cas would hope for rescue, but he doesn’t have the brainpower to think about it outside of acknowledging that the back room was empty save for him before all of this began. He’s on his own. As it is, the only thing really keeping his attention is the way the gun has started to tremble, just a little bit, as Zeke’s hands start to lose their steadiness.
The pup huffs, but leaves without further protest. Cas sets the familiar tray with a bowl, spoon, and plate on the vanity and brings over the bowl of broth with a thick chunk of dark bread.
PT shows no signs of violent tendencies. Very empathetic -
Something wild settles a bit in Cas’ eyes and he nods seriously. “Th-thank you, Dean. Come with me, I drew you a bath.”
Naomi looks over at him, giving him a dispassionate once-over. “I know about your paramour, James,” Dean stiffens in surprise but stays blessedly silent, “but who, pray tell, is this?”
Her mom isn’t there to yell at her about her homework, but Castiel will ask about it from time to time. Her mom isn’t there to tell off guys who grope her, but Dean and Benny keep a sharp eye on the patrons at the bar. Maybe her mom is still a phone call and a few hundred miles away, but Jo’s part of a family just the same here.
Cas turns enough to cock an eyebrow at Dean. He’s strikingly lovely in the afternoon sunshine coming through the window, with a clean white shirt rolled up this elbows and breeches that would be distractingly snug if Dean wasn’t so worked up about his interaction with the sheriff.
“I’m, uh,” the boy replies, eyes moving rapidly to take everything around him in. “I’m looking for Dean Winchester?”
“Dammit.”
Sam, wonderfully intuitive at the worst of times and cuttingly intelligent at the best, asks, quite innocently, “Cas, how do you know all of this?”
Unfamiliar fangs drop from his gums and sink into the arm held to his lips, both by his own iron grip and by Cas himself. At the same time, he feels his heartbeat shudder to a complete stop.
When his hips are finally flush with Cas’ behind and he’s sheathed to the hilt in Cas’ silky heat, Dean braces himself to stay still while Cas adjusts. He’s still fairly well-endowed, and Cas really
- I'm very sad to see this story end. I hope you loved it as much as I did.
he assures himself,
“Well, Cas, be-because you’re
She’s very, very good, though, because she doesn’t bat an eye, or make any indication that she knows who he is. “Of course,” she says, rising to her feet. Castiel tenses, but she simply moves around the desk and down the hall. “If you’ll follow me, I’ll show you to Ms. Naomi’s office.”
The next morning, the scent of pup wakes Dean again. This time, he opens his eyes immediately and sees the ice blue eyes of Castiel’s daughter in the same place she was yesterday, regarding him solemnly.
“I’ve heard that before, Dean. I’m sure you’re not…” Cas swallows hard and his eyes dart away for the briefest moment before he meets Dean’s gaze head-on again. “I’m sure you’re not a threat to my daughter, and I’m sure you’re who you say you are. But she has suffered for my lack of wariness before. Never again.”
Dean finally opens his eyes and meets another pair of blue eyes, although these are icier, lighter than Castiel’s. The light of the lanterns that keep the room from being plunged in darkness dance on her light blonde hair peeking over the foot of the bed and the illumination is just enough to see her eyes and her little snubbed nose. She’s young, probably only four or five years old, certainly too young for the wariness in her eyes.
Anna nods, pauses awkwardly, then flings herself forward and hugs Dean fiercely before waving at Cas and darting away. Dean blinks, then chuckles and resumes walking them toward their physics class.
He watches Adam, whose similarities to Dean and Sam become more apparent by the minute, as he stumbles over an explanation. If he’s homeless, it’s quite recent. His clothes are dusty but not grimy, and he’s at least had the opportunity to kee his face and hands clean. His bag is worn, yes, but it hasn’t needed any patching yet that Castiel can see.
Dean doesn’t let it crack his composure. “Something I can help you with, then?”
There’s not much he can do for the land yet, anyway. He’ll have to go to the city for seed, expertise, and parts for the plow that he’s found need replacing. He’s going to put that particular journey off for as long as possible, really. It’s not that he’s scared that time away will make Cas tell him to hit the road, really, but Dean doesn’t want to spend any more time away from him and Claire than he has to. Especially with her little arm still splinted and his courting of Cas so new.
with more experience than me, and you know it. Not with this company.”
He thinks about Sam, somewhere, waiting for the day they meet up next to the river.
“Excuse you,” Balthazar says stiffly. “I do not
Dean winces. “Shit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean-”
“Don’t,” a very familiar voice says, and Cas freezes. “Just… Don’t, all right? I don’t want to do this,
It seems absurd after all they’ve been through together that he has any secrets at all from Cas. He knows that Cas prefers his breakfast bread just this side of burnt, he knows that Claire believes firmly that she will win every footrace she enters. He knows that Claire was a happy baby, and that the wariness that greeted him when he first woke was a defense she uses against
“Cas?” He sounds incredibly young, more like the teenager Cas met than the young man (vampire) he’s become.
“Castiel.”
When they get back to the house, Claire’s own little bouquet is clutched to her chest, then given a place of honor on top of her chest of drawers in her bedroom. Dean presents Cas with the bigger bouquet, looking him int he eye and making sure that their fingers brush when he hands them over.
Cas rolls his eyes at Dean’s crassness, which was Dean’s goal, and they make their way into the theater where graduation is being held.
Dean snorts, but Castiel is too busy staring at Joshua’s blood on the walls. He slowly follows the trail until he sees the heap of a body on the ground in the corner.
It’s only a few blocks before he runs into a little tea shop. It won’t be as good as what Donna makes, of course, but it’s relatively quiet in the middle of the day, and he needs
Pontiac Prep Academy has a lot of advantages on public high schools. The teachers are stellar, the class sizes are small. The arts and academia receive just as much passion and following as sports. The students who attend are widely acknowledged to be better prepared for
Not last night, however. No, last night found him tossing and turning, unable to focus on anything but that single note of anguish and the way it resonated so terribly with something deep within him. Perhaps that’s why he’s here today - he won’t be able to move on until he knows more about whoever is suffering so dearly.
with all of the trouble they’ve been having with the Lightbringers, who are very much still at large. When the idea of following Sam was presented, Gabe made a lot of noise about how good the food is in college towns. Balthazar ruminated on all of the young, tan,
John meets his eyes and just looks at him for a few moments. He looks solemn, and almost… Regretful, ashamed. Dread dances up Dean’s spine to make him lightheaded.
“Dean,” the voice is panicking. “Dean, you have to drink.”
“I’ll love you no matter what,” Cas says casually, “but if I’m sacrificing half a milkshake for it, I expect to see results.”
What he
Dean shrugs. “Some girls in her grade were giving her shit. She asked for some help with how to deal with them.” He smiles a little. “I’m glad it worked. She’s a sweet kid.”
Castiel smiles because Dean is ridiculous, but he’s also wonderful, and Castiel loves him very much. “Thank you.”
“I stayed for a year, and then she adopted another child.” A ghost of a smile touches Castiel’s lips. “His hair was too long, and he was too smart-mouthed for Naomi to really like, but Gabriel’s presence our estate woke me up.”
But Mr. N rarely
Dean ignores the pointed words as guilt drowns out the happy feelings bubbling up inside of him.
When he opens his eyes, he’s in a brightly lit, simple room. It’s hard to know for sure without knowing which way the home is facing, but the way the bugs are screaming outside tells him it’s about midday.
Dean knows that Cas loves him, but Cas still thinks that emotions are a weakness. Dean doesn’t know where that mindset came from, necessarily, but he thinks her name is Naomi and he thinks she’s a bitch.
Now that he knows Naomi is the driving force behind the Lightbringers, Castiel can see the patterns in their behavior clearly. He berates himself for not putting it together sooner for about an hour before Dean catches onto him and manages to distract him thoroughly from his self-loathing. A few hours later, while he’s much more relaxed, he still thinks he should have connected the dots.
“Dean, I-”
He startles when he feels a rag drop into the water, but Cas immediately shushes him.
The only thing that could make the night better is when Dean wakes just enough to register that Claire is wiggling in between them, both she and Cas safe and warm in Dean’s arms.
Nick shrugs, feigning nonchalance. “Dean is just so… Bight. Personable? I don’t know, he seems so outgoing. And Castiel is… A little bit of a cold fish, don’t you think?”
Zeke shakes his head like a dog getting rid of a fly. “But none of that matters now, Castiel.”
in front of him.
Instead, he’s been watching television with Dean. As much as he despises inactivity, even he has to admit that letting Dean rest on top of him on the couch and fall asleep on his chest while Castiel desperately tries to understand whatever show they’re watching is an excellent pastime, far from a waste.
Cas’ eyes seem to glow in the scant moonlight coming in through the window. He stays silent, though, clearly waiting for Dean to continue. Dean can’t decide if he’s grateful or not.
“All right,” Dean says, holding his arms out to the sides, “c’mon. Let’s fight about it.”
“An angel in human form,” Sam says.
Cas ignores him, though. His nose is in the air. “What is-”
Well, mostly peaceful.
“I stayed with her.” Now his voice is robotic, strained. He is tired and heartsick, he wants to lie down and sleep forever, maybe. He just has to finish the tale of his failure to Dean and he’ll get to.
Dean nods. “Well if you give me a hand with one of these chairs outside, I’ll take care of it.”
“What do-” Cas croaks, then clears his throat and tries again. “What do you have in mind, exactly?”
a deep voice from a memory he can barely grasp assures him.
Dean nods. “All right. Let’s go kick some graduation ass, baby.”
In the center of that room stands Balthazar. He’s wearing all black (which Castiel feels is overkill), and he’s glaring at the man tied to a chair just a few feet off center.
“Does it have something to do with Joshua?”
Castiel’s face could be carved from granite for all the emotion it gives away. He learned from the best, after all. “Oh?”
“Quit woolgathering!” Gabe snaps. “It’s Halloween, and I haven’t seen you in
for you, can you feel it?”
. It's a cause that's near and dear to my heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean nods decisively and points to Jack. “Text me what you want, kiddo. I’ll go grab Benny and we’ll be back before you know it.”
But there’s
“Benny’s calling the cops, and we’ll get the kid an ambulance as soon as we can, okay.”
He was a stranger the first time he road through town, someone with no association to gossip about, anyway. Add to that the fact that he was galloping down the main road, cradling an injured pup, and his scent was a mess of fear and anger, no one much bothered them until they got to the doctor’s office and his nasty office omega spoke to Dean.
They need to talk for about four more hours before he’s going to feel okay about this, about what he’s done to Cas and if he’s manipulating him, but
out of the ordinary,” Dean grits out, his amusement fading fast. Rumors and gossip are one thing, a nasty, unnecessary thing, but people are people. Accusing Cas of murder directly to Dean’s face, however, is something else entirely, and Dean finds himself almost unable and entirely unwilling to hold back his aggression any longer.
With The Colonel behind him and Dean curled around his front, Castiel falls asleep again easily. This time, there are no dreams.
fighting sleep, so Castiel helps him settle back into bed and draws the blankets up to Dean’s chin.
Too much fear has always given Castiel a headache, though. He prefers gentler emotions - joy, contentedness, affection - but he hasn’t fed in quite a while, and he has to admit that it’s satisfying to be able to just breathe in once and be filled to the brim with emotion.
He is a soldier.
“The fact that frightening humans has never lost its shine for you tells me precisely how good you think it is,” he says dryly.
Cas seems to hear more, though, and he’s nodding. “That does seem frightening, and I’m sorry you dreamed about it. But I know a secret. Would you like to know what it is?”
when I realized you were with him, and I must have blacked out, because the next thing I remember is-”
Cas slumps against him, and Dean catches him with a soft “oomph.” He winces when his over-sensitive cock slips free, but he gently helps Cas maneuver himself so he’s resting on Dean’s chest and their legs are tangled.
Instead of doing what he’s told, Dean snags Cas around the waist and pulls him close. Cas laughs and meets his husband halfway in a fierce, short, playful kiss that makes his head spin and his knees weak.
- *rolls in a month later with Starbucks* Hi, friends. Real Life has absolutely kicked my ass lately. There's no reason to get into all of it here, but I might bitch about it on Tumblr later. The point is, my bad.
They crawl beneath the covers together and Dean wraps around him like an octopus. Knowing his concentration is shot, Cas doesn’t even consider getting any more work done tonight.
So he’s kind of surprised that Sam knows about the Walker deal at all, much less that he knows enough to be freaked out by whatever he heard.
Dean nods once. “All right.” He leans forward to press his mouth very, very gently against Cas’ busted lips. When he pulls away, he whispers. “I gotta go take care of this. I love you.”
indicative of a very kind soul. Cas can only hope that some of that kindness remains in the company.
Adam smiles, a crooked, timid thing, but better than the low-key fear that’s been on his face since he walked into The Bunker for the first time.
His thoughts are interrupted by the chime of the bell, Jack’s indistinct voice, and then a
Relieved, Castiel smiles. “I wouldn’t dream of interrupting your routine.”
“I know I’m overly formal, and that I often miss social cues.”
“Their idea,” Castiel says slowly, still struggling to parse out what exactly is going on here, “is a world in which humans serve vampires. They would give us whatever we wanted.”
Castiel blinks, utterly derailed. He really thought the meeting was going quite well. He’s nervous, of course, but he feels that he’s doing a passable job of covering.
Later that night, Cas is attempting to distract himself from his racing mind by reading. It’s not working, but he’s giving it a shot.
“I will hear no more of it,” Cas cuts him off briskly. “You’ll continue to sleep in the bed and that’s that.”
Dean is talking about a test he took recently, one on which he did well. Mary is already well aware of it and is proud of her son. There is now, however, a note of (albeit shaky) confidence in his own voice. It’s something she’s only heard rarely before, and in her surprise, she glances at Castiel.
this, of course, that wouldn’t be right, but I really think if you settle down and get married, their concerns will disappear.”
It is not, after all, the first time someone has looked at Dean with such unadulterated
“Are you
“I am.”
Cas’ eyes are luminous and unreadable. “Not because I’m an omega?”
Cas takes in a deep breath.
Dean, at that point, had been studying Cas for a long, long time. He knew, then, a lot of the ins and outs of how Castiel thought. He knows the more now, of course, has travelled them many a time at Cas’ side, but then, he knew enough to realize a few things.
Castiel’s respect for her, not insignificant to begin with, goes up several notches. She must have genuine, strong feelings about Dean Winchester to brush off any compulsion at all, even as weak as what he just did was. Castiel hates that he
He doesn’t know what he’ll do instead, but making the assertion to himself makes him feel a little better.
Finally, still a bit breathless from the coughing, Dean waves the omega off.
Mr. N turns the car off and turns to Charlie, who’s already speaking.
“Well, I suspected, or, well, I suppose I
Blonde
A kind of fear that Castiel is intimately acquainted with.
Castiel was not, however, one of Naomi’s generals for nothing. Though he came with a vague plan, he easily makes alterations to it and hopes that Dean and Lucifer play along.
Castiel glances at Dean, who nods a little and places his hand on Castiel’s thigh beneath the table. Cas covers Dean’s hand with his own, clears his throat a bit, and speaks.
Cas and Dean aren’t just in love, they’re
They let The Pack outside and Dean feeds all of them while Cas starts the shower. Once the dogs are settled, he hurries to join Cas. He flings his clothes off haphazardly and slips into the shower behind Cas.
Fortunately, Dean’s is better.
before he realized how incoherent Dean was, he probably thought some asshole alpha was there to
Apparently, the world of Novak, being a Well-Rounded Adult means that you must have an artistic pursuit as well as academic. Which is weird to Dean, since in the world of Winchester, you just have to know how to hustle pool and look dumber than you are, but to each their own.
Cas hurries to him, already reaching for his cell phone to call an ambulance.
Castiel manages to keep himself from rolling his eyes, but only just. The teenagers Gabriel has frightened give off piercing shrieks into the night, followed by relieved laughter. Gabriel, forever an adolescent, is laughing uproariously from behind the hockey mask he’s wearing.
He’s never gotten that impression, however. All Cas’ scent has ever revealed to him is a sort of bashful, confused pleasure.  That’s quite enough for Dean.
asked his weird, snake-in-the-grass question. It was sneaky and underhanded, and Charlie thinks that that behavior isn’t the kind of thing she wants at The Bunker.
Dean has become entirely still, in the unnatural way of vampires, but Castiel has almost forgotten him in the rush of memories that wash over him.
“Uh… Hey, Cas?”
“commitment.” No one will believe Dean is anything but firmly attached.
Dean shakes his head as if in thought. “I just don’t know what’s different today. But you and your papa here have made the best bread in the whole world.”
“Don’t be smug. If it’s not because you’re having second thoughts, why are you stalling?”
Dean grinned. “Yeah.”
There is a beat of absolute silence before Dean snorts again. “Jesus, lady,” he murmurs.
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, ‘pala runs the show, without a doubt.” He tries another smile. “What’s your name, so I can know what to call the man saving my life?”
“That’s the wrong damn tree to bark at.”
“In conclusion, we realize that the HLSC isn’t Winchester Motors’ normal investment. We’re hoping, however, that our good standing in our current long term agreement will encourage you to sign a renewed contract,” Castiel finishes with a nervous, hopeful smile.
Dean nods earnestly. “Yeah, totally, and I get it, I do. And I don’t wanna push you, ‘cause Missouri said that would be bad, but you’re shutting me out, and I-”
A young Mary Campbell had her first coffee date with John Winchester at the shop that, at the time, just had an orange neon sign over the door that declared “COFFEE.” Mary was rather sentimental, so when the shopping center went up for sale twenty-five years ago, she created a subset of Winchester Motors to help local small business owners and bought it. She signed them in for their current fixed rent rate and put a twenty-five year expiration date on it.
He’s every wet dream Dean has ever had.
The smile hits Dean square in the chest, and he smiles back, helpless and a little giddy. “I know, but I’m not going to make you put up with me for that long, sweetheart. I’m just… Spreading my wings, maybe. Seeing what fits and what doesn’t.”
There’s no need for more. They are such a sure thing, such an inevitability to both of them, that declarations of love are rendered obsolete (for now).
Jesus.”
The kid jolts like a gun went off and stares at him, wild-eyed. “What? Me? What?”
“Hello, this is Ellie from Crain Veterinary Clinic. Is a Dean Winchester available?”
He knows, of course, that this peace won’t last, not exactly like this, anyway. Dean is still reeling from quitting a job that he relied on heavily for his identity for a very long time, still trying to find his equilibrium in a world that has changed quite suddenly for him. While it’s nice to see him loosen up a little and to see the end of those terrible suits, Dean will need to figure out a plan soon, to find out what and where he wants to go next. Cas is really just glad for the opportunity to be a safe harbor for his husband during this time of recovery.
So now they stay here, in Cas’ home in California. It’s an extremely light place, with light-colored woods and white walls and big windows. The windows have been treated to block UV rays, so while it’s not always comfortable to be sitting in direct sunlight, the vampires move about the house with ease in the daytime.
Dean’s grinning shamelessly. He rolls them so he’s hovering over Cas, and he savors the way Cas just goes, easy and warm and pliant.
Castiel misses the rush of warm blood to Dean’s cheeks being his own, but the knowledge that the blood that makes him blush is from a donor doesn’t lessen the impact overmuch. “Stop, Cas,” Dean murmurs. “Gonna make me all stuttery for when we meet with the enemy.”
“We would have been lynched for sharing a milkshake in the fifties,” Cas says dryly.
Cas shakes his head, trembling from head to toe as he’s assaulted by pleasure. His limbs tingle and he tightens his fingers in Dean’s hair again.
Cas knows the accusation hit Dean hard, but pride swelled in him when Dean just buried his face in Cas’ neck and hid there until Sam dragged Bobby back into his own living room (they were visiting in celebration of Dean’s graduation when “the talk” occurred). Dean didn’t pull away, run, or try to put unnecessary and painful distance between himself and Cas, but instead gripped his hand hard when he faced his brother and uncle.
He nods toward the door they’re still standing in front of. “Will you tell me about this patient, please?”
Castiel’s breath catches in his chest, and his heart gives one heavy
“Dean,” Cas says softly, running his fingers through Dean’s hair. “He came all this way, did all this looking, just to find you. I think it’s highly improbable that he’s going to leave now.”
Dean is staring daggers at the wall. “The Lightbringers.”
It’s no question at all, really.
she thinks as she restarts her count.
What he knows is that it’s
“I’m fine, Cas. Just dirty and tired.”
Castiel heaves a sigh. He’ll talk to Dean, he will, he’s always planned to, but he really
As he surrenders to the blackness for what he suspects will be the last time, he hopes someone will take care of his horse after he’s dead.
“Which is… With you?”
One last deep breath. “Of course, Dean. Lie back against me and we’ll get started.”
to Claire.”
Dean is vulgar, immature, and prone to starting fights
Cas nods earnestly and twists his head uncomfortably so he can keep his eyes on Dean. “Oh, yes. Very important.”
She interrupts him by hitting a button on the intercom on her desk, and all hell promptly breaks loose.
“What’s wrong, sweetheart?” he whispers urgently.
Gabe sounds like he’s already recovered from encounter with the asylum. He’s always been remarkably quick to bounce back from something, which Castiel has always admired. He, himself, is more of what Gabe calls “the brooding type.” He finds himself caught in his thoughts, in his memories, far too often to be healthy.
“Cas, this is too fancy,” Dean murmurs in his ear. “You’ll have to help me. I dunno which fork to kill myself with.”
Castiel doesn’t remember when they met, but he remembers the magnetism was irresistible right from the beginning. He can’t really pinpoint the day they went from “Dean” and “Castiel” to “Dean and Cas,” just that it’s perfectly natural to have Dean’s arm flung in a seemingly careless manner around his shoulders as they walk down the halls.
A trickle of unease works its way down Charlie’s spine. “I repeat, what do you mean?
The feeling of victory brought on by Cas’ tepid acceptance of Dean’s help fades quickly, leaving the alpha tossing and turning all night. It had certainly
Thing is, Mr. W and Mr. N are pretty affectionate in the day-to-day. Mr. W is always reaching out to tangle his fingers with Mr. N’s, or nuzzle Mr. N’s dark hair, or wrap an arm around Mr. N’s waist and pull him snug against him. It’s sweet to see them like that, so loving and gentle even after being together for so long. It gives Charlie hope, especially because Mr. N always leans into Mr. W, always allows the PDA when his partner initiates it.
When he’s finished eating, Castiel brings him another cup of water and forces him to drink the whole thing. By that time, Dean is
“My goodness,” Cas says after the silence draws on long enough to make it clear that Dean won’t continue until Cas answers him. “What on Earth could you have to tell me?” A soft, teasing smile on that mouth that Dean’s so taken with. “You’re not wanted for murder, are you?”
Dean doesn’t want to forget a damn thing that happened in that office.
“Dean,” she acknowledges, ice in her voice.
And then Cas discovered the fault lines in the landscape of Dean’s own heart and mind. The self-doubt and loathing he carries with him in everything. The almost paralytic need to take care of Sammy, which has led to more than one bad decision on his part. His strained (to put it politely) relationship with his own shitdick, abusive father. Not to mention the mother who couldn’t settle in one place long enough to have a forwarding address, much less take care of two sons. The anger in him, the fighting he used to do almost every night.
Dean’s voice sounds very far away.
But Dean is still struggling to move away. “Already bad ‘nough for you,” he mutters, almost to himself. “Don’t wan’ be worse.”
Dean frowns. “What?”
Dean pauses in his sorting and blinks.
Surely there’s paperwork he needs to sign, something to get started on to finally
Jo says, “I gotta go back down to part-time. Classes are starting up again.”
Anna beams. “Great! I’ll be right behind you. I’ve been wanting to try Oh, You Betcha, anyway.”
“Don’t,” Dean whispers, a ragged, wretched sound that pulls at Cas’ heart. “Don’t ask me to go easy on him, Cas, please, for the love of God. I can’t do it. Not after I had to watch him point a gun at you.
Castiel allows himself just a beat to smile smugly before he returns to his desk to study.
He stretches hard, then silently leads Rugaru, Phoenix, and Kitsune out of the bedroom. His girls know the drill, so they’re all quiet until he shuts the bedroom door behind him. The Colonel stays in bed with Cas, and he’ll be there until Cas gets up.
Dean asks Cas about Ketch as soon as he’s back home. Claire is out in the stable, babbling happily to Impala about her day while Impala munches oats and lets her ears swivel toward the girl.
“She is, however, extremely persuasive. They will believe her wholeheartedly because she has gotten them to love her, to trust her. That’s why they’re so dangerous, they’re entirely committed to this cause. They will stop at nothing to see Naomi’s vision through.”
“We’re here to see Naomi,” he says to the receptionist.
Castiel nuzzles at Dean’s cheek shamelessly, love making him affectionate and stupid. “You are, by far, the most singularly spectacular being I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.”
Adam blinks a couple of times, looking around. The whole damn crew is here, doing a piss-poor job of pretending to work. Except for Charlie, who isn’t even pretending.
Dean isn’t angry with him. Dean isn’t disgusted by his weakness. Dean doesn’t think he’s a monster (well, outside of being a vampire), or an abomination, or a failure. Dean still thinks Castiel is worthy of sorrow and physical affection.
“Cas,” he says softly, and the seriousness in his tone has Cas waking up for real and sitting up enough to prop himself on his elbows to hover over Dean. “Cas, sit up for a second. We should… Talk.”
“That is… That is
Castiel and his siblings also seem to be perfect. Well-mannered, well-dressed, well-groomed. Not a hair out of place or a wrinkle in sight.
He considers drawing out the process of drying off, but he can’t bring himself to do it. If this will change the way Dean looks at him, he may as well get it over with.
“Right now, I want to have lunch with you and Jack and Benny and Anna. Can I… Can we stay?”
right. Listen, son, have you seen anything…
“Got anything you wanna tell me?” Dean asks, deceptively calm.
“Drink,” Dean says, urging Castiel to sit up and take the glass of water from him. Castiel acquiesces easily, never moving far from the solid warmth Dean’s chest offers. Dean combs his fingers through Castiel’s hair and kisses his shoulder and neck again while Castiel drinks. Once he’s done, Dean takes the empty glass and puts it back on the nightstand. Then he tugs Cas back to lying down and pulls him close, wrapping his arms tight around Castiel.
Claire’s eyes are very wide and very blue. “Can alpha tuck me into bed?
The sound has become quite commonplace over the last several weeks. After everything that went down with Nick, Dean has been especially wary of hiring someone to fill Jo’s open hours. Everyone has pitched in, Dean and Charlie and Anna. Even Sam has worked a bar shift or two over these last weeks.
Sure, it’s a little weird. Hell, Mr. N himself is more than a little weird. But it’s nice, too, really nice.
“You… Said you wanted to go to bed.”
Charlie gapes for a second, then walks over as quickly and quietly as possible to snag Anna’s arm. When the pretty server looks up, eyebrows furrowed in confusion, Charlie jerks her head up toward the dance floor and puts a finger to her lips.
“Yes, little one?”
all lush and almost always curved up in a knowing smirk. Dean didn’t stand a chance.
John doesn’t seem to hear him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The Winchesters have been running cons as long as any of us can remember. It’s all we know. Most of us die pretty ugly, to tell you honest, but our parents died of yellow fever a few years back, so Sam and I took over the family business for good.
The scent of Dean next to him, though, vibrant and warm with the blood they consumed together before they left, keeps him present.
“But Papa is caring for you,” she says with a little frown of concentration. She speaks formally, just like Castiel, and Dean finds himself inexplicably charmed by it.
Dean is still a little rough around the edges. He’s open about the fact that he was a scrapper when he met Cas, getting into fights almost every night, reopening the wounds on his knuckles before they ever really healed. He says he was too much, too directionless before he met Cas.
“Of course, pup,” Dean answers, his own voice much less composed than Cas’ was. “Go get ready, I’ll come in when you’re in bed.”
She also recognizes the hold he has over her eldest son.
On the third day that Dean is awake and alert, Castiel is
“I’m fine, Dean,” Cas assures him softly. “They surprised me, that’s the only reason it’s this bad.”
“Love you, too,” Dean murmurs against his mouth, “love you, Cas, of
“C… Cas…”
The bedroom door snicks closed outside, and Cas knows he can’t put it off any longer.
His opportunity comes when a small wild goose is caught in one of the traps. It’s big enough to feed the three of them generously, but not unmanageably huge. HE makes sure it’s a clean kill, then takes extra care when plucking and preparing it for cooking.
Dean is frequently caught off-guard by Cas’ ethereal beauty, and tonight is no different. The light from the street lamps outside has cast him in warm orange and cool black shadow, highlighting all of his sharp edges.
Cas blinks, frowning. It’s the most emotion he’s shown in the last few minutes, which has Dean sweating bullets.
Dean nods down at Cas’ swollen cock, looking painfully hard and wet at the head. “Go on then, sweetheart. You wanted it so bad, you make yourself come for me.”
- The fork line is from
"Yes," he whispers, voice rough and eyes misty. "Yes. Tomorrow. We'll go tomorrow."
“I could… Help you?”
The ride is silent, save for the rock music coming from Baby’s speakers. Dean sings along softly, and Castiel finds it in himself to hum with the music after a while. His body gets looser as more scenery goes by, and his mind begins to relax a bit. Driving with Dean is familiar, known, and it’s hard to stay worried and alert when he’s in a scenario in which they’ve always been safe.
Castiel doesn’t mind. Dean has always come back to him, and Cas will be here to call him back until either the end of time or Dean doesn’t want him anymore.
She laughs. “All right. Four grilled cheese sandwiches coming right up.”
There’s a lot there that could be considered assumption, but Cas knows as well as Dean they were always going to end up back on Pontiac. He can’t leave Anna and Hannah here to rot under Naomi’s rule, any more than Dean can leave his parents and their slipping hold on their criminal empire behind.
As the seconds slowly pass, Cas feels himself relaxing in Dean’s hold. They’re pressed together all the way down, folded into one another almost too intimately for public. He feels surrounded by Dean, drowning in his scent and his presence.
A piece of greyscale abstract art that Dean has always felt gave off a desperate, predatory air hangs on one wall. Otherwise, the room is bare of personality. There’s no family pictures on
When he got close, though, that wasn’t the stuff that kept him coming back. That was the wicked, dry humor Cas has, and the almost predatory intelligence that he doesn’t bother to hide or dumb down. Everything about Castiel ensnared Dean somehow, and he’s happily caught.
It seems to work, because she goes back to her sandwich, humming a tune Dean suspects she’s making up as she goes along.
“Hard to say for sure. Depends on the doctor you’re talking to. He’s got a lot of symptoms, fugue states, auditory and visual hallucinations, you name it.” Her voice shakes with emotion, and Castiel makes the first impulsive decision he’s made in a very, very long time.
John is still spluttering, well on his way to shouting, when he walks out of his father’s office.
Lucifer has been remarkably… Casual about the Lightbringers, their mission, and their worship of him. He behaves mostly as if it’s amusing, which quite frankly boggles Castiel. The First seems to treat most things as though they’re jokes, though. Even this evening when they were gearing up, he made a quip about being “too old for all that” and firmly declined any offer of weaponry.
Dean can’t help how stiff his voice gets. “I’ve heard about the
He frowns again. “But you were in there for so
he were real.”
“We got a free half an hour,” Dean says, apropos of nothing.
“Tell me you’re not hurt,” Dean’s voice is strained when he speaks, “tell me he didn’t hurt you, sweetheart.”
“Indeed. I realized she wanted to do the same thing to the boy that she had done to me, and I couldn’t… I couldn’t let that happen. I had failed Anna, but I was strong, now, just as strong as Naomi, at least physically, and I wouldn’t let myself fail this child.
“Dean, Dean Winchester.”
“I…” Dean seems to steel himself. “Cas, I don’t want to wait.”
He has to be there for Sam, and someone’s going to take care of Bobby as he ages, and Cas. He needs Cas, and Cas needs him, and it doesn’t matter to him that Cas is a vampire because Cas is the
“Of course,” he says a bit breathily.
Dean lets the rest of The Pack out into the backyard, then sets about getting breakfast ready. First, he brews strong coffee for himself and sets up the tea kettle to get it ready for Cas (Cas is on this tea kick recently, and it looks like it might be around to stay, so Dean is adjusting). He starts chopping vegetables and getting ingredients ready for omelettes. He’s only a few minutes into this routine, and into his cup of coffee, when a deliciously rumpled Cas comes into the kitchen.
Gabriel stands next to them in a horrific Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops. He’s got big obnoxious sunglasses perched on his nose, and if Castiel didn’t love him so, he’d be embarrassed to be seen with him.
Zeke shouts, and Cas jumps again. He presses his lips together hard so he doesn’t cry out. Even if someone were to hear, there’s no telling what Zeke would do to them, and Cas is certain the front door is locked, anyway.
Uriel smirks, his eyes gleaming. “Well, it was certainly enough to frighten Joshua before I tore his foolish head from his shoulders.”
“Very good.” Another deep breath. “Very good.”
“Don’t give me that hippie, ‘turn the other cheek’ bullshit,” Dean says without heat. “Tell me.”
They pulled up to a dingy building, settled in a not-so-good part of town between an all-night laundromat and a nondescript business on the other side that has no sign. A few of the windows had been busted out and boarded up, as well as the door. There was a sign over the door at one point, but the only indication of it left was a patch of lighter-colored building where it had been.
And that was that.
Dean aches to comfort Cas with warm words and gentle touches, but Cas doesn’t respond to anything like a normal person. The implication that he needs gentleness is also, to Cas, an implication that he is weak.
A small part of himself is holding him back, too, and not just for Cas. As much as he wants to throw himself into a new life on this farm, with this omega and this pup, there’s something stopping him.
“Shh, whatever it is, it’s okay, we’ll handle it together. We can do anything together, really, I think. So whatever is happening, we’ll
“Not particularly.”
Dean tosses his head back and laughs. Claire lets out a surprised giggle, and the sound does more to lighten Dean’s heart than anyone could. The pup is far too serious.
Mr. W assures her several times that it’s nothing, just some paperwork. But Mr. W is a lying liar who lies and is also
Cas signals the end of their quiet time by taking the bar of soap and turning to start washing Dean. For his part, Dean follows Cas’ soft requests to move this way or that. His hands are gentle and thorough.
It occurs to Dean that
have to compel here, but he is not, in fact, an actual doctor. He can be truthful in some of the comfort he offers her, though, and he thinks that might be more important, anyway.
If Dean thought for a moment that Castiel wasn’t interested in his advances, he would cease them immediately. He’d still be happy to stay on this little farm, whether or not he and Cas are involved (gods, he hopes Cas wants to be involved with him). Dean’s known a few alphas in his time who didn’t see anything wrong with forcing their attentions on an omega, but it’s always made him queasy to think about, especially with everything in Castiel’s history.
But Cas’ arms are still around his neck and his legs are still cradling Dean’s hips possessively. Cas is painfully beautiful like this, pliant and radiating warmth. Dean’s heart clenches.
“What next?” Dean says.
He must not succeed, though, because Claire tilts her head back to look up at him. The crown of her head thunks against his sternum, which is infinitely comforting in a way that he doesn’t want to examine.
Castiel looks up and laughs softly, a sound that rattles around Dean’s head for a moment. “Only when I asked you to move around, lift this or that, and when I asked you to still yourself so I could remove your breeches, Dean, nothing more.” He pats Dean’s bare knee as he reaches for two long strips of linen from a basket beside the bed. He folds one into a pad roughly the size of the wound and uses the other to wrap around Dean’s leg, holding the bandage in place.
“Dean,” Cas whispers against his mouth, “I’m so

"Mother, I must ask a favor of you."
along his front, so that he can feel Cas’ rapidly hardening interest against his own.
Sam looks apologetic as he hovers at the door, phone in hand. “Uh… Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”

with a very bright, very cheap Hawaiian shirt, and even more offensively vibrant sneakers. His only attempt to be in a costume at all is the mask, which remains pushed up on his head.
but Dean
“It’s supper, Papa!” Claire crows. “Dean ‘n me made supper to help! Did we? Did we help, Papa?”
John falters and frowns. “You don’t think what?”
- ALSO the cover art is just something I threw together on my phone. Try not to judge me for it, lol.
To his utter horror, Dean hears himself blurt the words out with no amount of finesse or smoothness whatsoever.
to fabricate anything of the sort.
“Watch the register for me, please,” Cas says, a little unevenly. “There’s some more inventory in the back that needs to be sorted.”
“This is comfort cuddling,” Cas says, interrupting Dean gently and letting his head rest on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s very important when a significant life change has taken place that you cuddle for comfort so you can heal and move forward.”
“Hmm?” Cas hums, busying himself by pulling out one of the thin towels they use to filter the coffee grounds out of their cups. His lack of eye contact is rather conspicuous. It makes the suspicion buzzing in the back of Dean’s mind even louder.
“And my handsome alpha,” Cas says, twisting his hips on the downstroke and whiting out Dean’s vision for a moment.
bodies available for debauchery. Cas has always just wanted to be where Dean is, but he suspects that his companions are still wary not only of the Lightbringers, but because of the events surrounding Dean’s kidnapping by Alastair. There must have been a reason they both stayed in Kansas, after all.
He turns Impala and she trots briskly down the street before Ketch can respond.
Cas cocks an eyebrow. “What is this?”
The lower level, while not wall-to-wall people like the dance floor is, is pretty damned crowded. Anna, the cocktail server, is an angel on heels as she glides between and through throngs of patrons. She’s graceful and unobtrusive as she moves.
“Uh… Whatcha doing?”
“This is about me, being tired of doing what I’m told. This is about Cas, who doesn’t deserve half of the shit I’ve had to put him through because of this company. I’m not giving him up, Dad, I’m just not, and I quit.”
“I just…” Adam is saying, staring down at the bar where his wringing hands rest, “I don’t know, I guess. What I was thinking, coming here.”
He frowns, though, when Cas shuffles forward and pulls his hand free after just a few moments. “Cas?”
“Gross.”
sensation of relief. He’s able to sort those out rather immediately and put them aside - whoever he’s here for certainly isn’t feeling any of those things.
The next few days pass in a cozy haze. Claire is just as affectionate and clingy with Dean as she is with Cas now, always touching one of them somehow. Cas, too, touches Dean more often. Not as often as the pup, but little touches here and there. A brush of their fingers, standing close enough that their shoulders press together, a gentle hand on Dean’s arm when they speak.
Who had
“I’m… Finished?” It’s a question more than a statement, much to Dean’s amusement.
Dean lets the subject change come gratefully and he gives Castiel what he knows is a rogueish grin.
Lucifer shrugs. “I mean, yeah, I’m the First, but it’s not like it comes with a lot of perks. And I don’t really hang out with vampires anymore, so I guess it doesn’t really come up all that often?”
“When Meg brought me back here, I knew you felt it, too,” Zeke says. “The way you
Castiel’s slim shoulders stiffen, but his voice is even when he hums noncommittally.
Dean is surprised by the pang of hurt in his chest. Castiel has no reason to trust him, especially with his pup, but it stings nonetheless. Not just because his inner alpha is upset at the implication that he’d hurt the most vulnerable of the pack
Dazed, he watches as Cas straddles him again and reaches behind himself to sink his fingers back into his hole. Dean finds the energy to wrap his own fingers around Cas’ cock and relishes the moan it gets him.
“Of course.”
Castiel approaches Dean slowly, cautiously. He kneels on the floor at his feet without touching him. The only sign that Dean knows he’s there is the way his green eyes squeeze shut as if in denial.
- The "Iceland, baby" scene is the one I had in mind when I started this fic. Directly inspired by the Laboratory episode of
Once Claire has declared herself ready, Dean goes into her little bedroom. He carefully steps around the pallet on the floor where Cas sleeps so he can sit on the edge of her bed, looking down at her angelic, sleepy face. Her hair is spilled out across the pillow, and the blankets are down by her waist.
She nods enthusiastically. “Yeah, it worked great! Just like you said it would!”
Gabe nods and makes his way to the kitchen. “Coolio.”
“Dean-”
had many lovers, so Dean wants to-
“Uh… No, but I-”
And the thing is, Cas means that. He genuinely does not give one fuck one way or another. Cas will never look at Dean differently if he rejects Adam now. Cas is sentimental, but only where sentimentality is earned. Cas is a painfully good person, but he puts Dean before everything else on the planet. If Dean says he can’t do this, quite literally nothing will change for Castiel.
“I’m sure you wouldn’t. Come along, now, you can carry the patient charts for me.”
He already left his shoes at the door, but he slips his jacket off, and after a moment’s thought, his jeans, too. He grabs Cas’ gift and crawls into bed next to him. Cas lifts the covers obligingly and presses against Dean’s side under his arm as soon as he’s settled.
like sweet, fertile omega. Claire smells like pup and pack and a lot of things Dean’s never going to get to have. They’re both good and hardworking and honest, and Dean can’t help but feel bad that he’s lying to them and draining their already slim resources.
So he tells himself, anyway.
There’s no need to get into a verbal bitch fight with Cas’ mom, though, no matter how much Dean wants to. First of all, Cas would disapprove. Mostly, though, engaging Naomi right now would send the wrong message.
Slender, calloused fingers pressing against his lips effectively silence Dean. he realizes that his gaze has shifted away from Cas and off into the darkness. With an effort, he makes himself meet Cas’ eyes again.
“I believe,” he says in answer to Sam’s question as he places one hand on the back of Dean’s neck and starts kneading gently, “that it was supposed to be symbolic.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean says with another shrug. “I’m not as smart as you are, Cas. Don’t see why I should waste time studying when it’s not gonna help.”
Dean gives him what he knows is a dazzling smile. “C’mn, share a milkshake with me, gorgeous. It’ll be like the fifties.”
Dean blinks again. “Oh. Well… That’s…”
“Are you all right?” Cas asks softly.
But Sam just smiles. “Yeah? Good. I like Cas.”
Dean nods. “So I was thinking that maybe we could help him out.”
“Fine, but your figure had better stay above reproach,” Cas says, a small smile on his lips.
He wears that stupid jacket, and his jeans always have holes in them. He smokes and drinks and is everything that Castiel has ever turned his nose up at in a romantic partner.
“I know how Dean feels about me, Charlie. We both know that he’s uncomfortable expressing his emotions verbally, but I know how he feels. I’m at peace with it.”
Cas goes easily when Dean pushes him into bed, then lets Dean arrange them to his liking. Cas ends up on his back and Dean flops down hard enough to draw an “oomph” from him. He rests his head on Cas’ shoulder almost defiantly before pulling the blankets up over them, grumbling the whole time.
Dean had smiled. “Not near as lucky as I am.” Always honest when it comes to Cas, unashamed.
“From all of us,” she interrupts firmly. “Just don’t say that shit to anyone here. We all like Mr. N just the way he is.”
“You know I love you, right?”
happening to him, but it’s unimportant. He’s much more focused on the fear, the terror.
Instead, he sits rigidly on the bed while Cas oh-so-gently turns his face this way and that, runs the straight razor confidently across Dean’s skin, and studiously doesn’t make eye contact. He’s not thinking about how good Cas smells, not really, he’s thinking about how much it doesn’t
With Cas’ timid acceptance of his plea to stay, Dean starts to oh so slowly court his pretty, standoffish omega.
Dean scoffs. “Cas, I’m in your debt, at best. At worst, I’ve wildly taken advantage of you and your kindness.”
“I have few memories of the orphanage, admittedly. Only that it was dingy, overcrowded, and we were constantly filthy and underfed. There was little in the way of structure, no attempt at education. It was a very bleak place.
The way Dean is smirking tells Cas that his thoughts are being broadcast on his face, so he quickly says, “There’s been no movement from the Los Altos. Charlie says she’ll let us know if there’s any change.”
Finally, Dean speaks.

- And, obvs, Cas and Dean live happily ever after... Forever.
The music and the background singers start to fade, and the men slowly spin to a stop, just holding one another close and pressing their foreheads together. It’s the goddamn cutest, gayest thing Charlie has ever seen in her
One of his contacts intercepted communication regarding Alastair’s failure to capture and subdue Dean, or to eliminate Cas. It explicitly describes the entire incident, much to Cas’ confusion, going so far as to describe what each of them was wearing. Dean brushes aside how strangely detailed the report is and just beams at Cas when Gabriel reads the part where Cas breaks down the basement door aloud. Castiel is sure he’s blushing.
really need to review their proposal again. It’s simple, a slight increase in their rent payments in exchange for another twenty-five year fixed-rate contract. It’s not much, but it’s what they can afford, and he’s hoping another heaping dose of nostalgia will keep the Heaven’s Light Shopping Center open and thriving.
Cas frowns as she walks away, then sighs. “Grilled cheese. There goes my girlish figure.”
mated, but Castiel isn’t saying anything about it, so Dean doesn’t push. Gods know that he has a long list of things he won’t talk about, so he doesn’t begrudge the omega his own secrets.
he thinks sourly as he and Colonel wait for a crosswalk signal to change.
There’s no alpha to fleece, beat, or any number of dark things that Dean wants to do when he thinks of Cas and Claire being harmed, though.

- Me, sing-songing through this whole chapter:

I’m so sorry, that was… Uh, a little out of nowhere.” He smiles, crooked and now a bit nervous, too. “Let me explain?”
Instead, he says, “Very well, then.” He knows he sounds stiff, too formal in his surprise and gratitude.
The name shocks Castiel. He feels his face cool as the blood he does indeed possess enough of drains from it, making him paler than normal, he’s sure. His limbs are alternately almost numb and far too sensitive. His fight or flight response has him struggling to keep his fangs hidden. He pointedly doesn’t look at Dean.
“Balthazar has him in a warehouse a few miles away.” Sam nods to him. “We were waiting for your instructions, Cas.”
Once the shock wore off the night before, Dean felt nothing but pride for his omega. He knows damn well that even if Cas had gone to someone in town about how Michael was treating him, small towns like this one aren’t the most sympathetic to mistreated omegas. The way they react to Cas or anything to do with him, even now, is proof enough of that.
“Yes.”
“What is it?” Cas whispers back. His hand is on Dean’s side, cradling his ribs. Dean finds the touch ridiculously comforting.
As Claire hops down from the table and hurries to follow the request, Dean cocks an eyebrow. “What’s goin’ on, Cas?”
Cas scowls. Dean knows very well how Castiel feels about the kind of strange shuffling that passes for dancing at high school formals. The Novaks, of course, have all taken extensive ballroom dancing lessons, but Cas is quite sure that’s not what Dean means.
Dean only indulges himself in staring for a beat. There’s no way Cas will miss it, but Dean does his best not to make him uncomfortable. It’s only a few weeks that Dean is staying, but he doesn’t want them to be strained, tense weeks.
“Sorry, boss, but it looks like you have an eleven-thirty meeting.”
“Cas, I-”
“Yield to me,” he says, and his voice comes out like unforgiving gravel. “It’s over, Naomi, all but the bleeding. You know it as well as I.”

They sit in silence for a beat before Castiel speaks.
“‘Night,” Dean says absently as Castiel shuts the door behind him. There’s something strange about the omega’s scent, some sort of combination of regret and relief that makes Dean’s nose twitch.
“I think that’s a
They’re studying in Cas’ bedroom since Dean’s parents are using the Winchester house for some sort of working meeting.  Dean is sprawled lazily on the floor, surrounded by scattered papers and books, while Cas sits primly at his rigorously organized desk. The yellow light of his desk lamp casts Dean in hues of gold, making it difficult to look away from him.
while I baked on Thanksgiving morning.
He continues to disregard various sensations brought on by common medications - a sort of metallic sharpness from mood-stabilizers, a thickness of thought brought on by antipsychotics - for quite a while before he’s able to latch onto what he’s looking for. While he was standing outside, it was easy to hear the person he’s here for, but inside it’s a cacophony.
The words burrow themselves deep into Dean’s heart, where they’ll stay forever, protected by his ribs and keeping his heart beating steadily for the omega beneath him. He kisses Cas hard, fiercely, and he slowly sinks into him.
how good the omega smells, because he’s not staying forever. He’s not thinking about how much he wants to bed Cas, to bury himself in this sweet, fierce, independent omega, he’s thinking about how
Using another chair (and probably risking his recovery, which he should mind more than he does), Dean manages to get a big cooking pot hung over the fire in the fireplace to start the water boiling for another stew. Once that’s done, he scoots over to the table to chop vegetables and meat, letting Claire gather them up in a little towel and carry them from the table and dump them into the pot.
Castiel looks up from where he’s studying at his desk. He’s wearing sweats and a t-shirt, something he’s begun doing recently and is directly Dean’s influence.
He thinks about Mary and John, about the sense of belonging they had managed to instill in their boys when they were always on the run, always at risk of getting caught, and especially when both Sam and Dean presented as alphas and they were in the throes of three different rut cycles.
So why, really, would he believe Dean?
“Well, I thank you,” Dean says with what he’s always been told is a charming smile. “Impala and I would be mighty appreciative of your hospitality.”
“I love you,” Castiel murmurs into Dean’s chest.
Sam huffs out an impatient breath. “I overheard them talking about the Walker deal.”
He has no idea how long it takes for Dean’s hips to come flush with his ass, but it feels like a long time. He realizes dimly that Dean is running soothing hands up and down his sides, and that he’s murmuring praise and encouragement softly.
he muses. “Where?” he asks aloud.
Zeke says firmly, loudly. Cas jumps.
Lucky for him, they get along.

Sam leans back onto his hands. “And that doesn’t strike you as odd?”
“Chinese?” he asks, plucking an idea out of the air. “Potstickers sound good.”
“That I am, pup.”
Castiel doesn’t say much while he helps Dean eat (he can use the spoon himself, thank you very much, but holding the bowl is a bit beyond his trembling muscles). He tells Dean they’re pretty far into the Missouri territories, at least two day’s ride from the river. He says there’s a town closer than that, just big enough to have a general store, a doctor’s office, and an inn. He talks about the weather, about farming, and about his rose garden.
“Perfect.”
The pup nods firmly, pulling him away from his own thoughts.
“Can I ask you something?”
He walks into the house in his smallclothes to see Cas sitting at the kitchen table, staring down at his clasped hands. At Dean’s entrance, his head whips up and he stares for a beat before surging to his feet and hurrying toward Dean.
At this, the mention of his mentor, Castiel sees red.
Sam’s brow furrows, but Castiel swipes to answer and puts his phone to his ear. “Hello?”
Dean doesn’t know what to do with another little brother. Sam’s all grown up, a lawyer who married a tough-as-nails nurse. Dean did his big brothering already. He just wants to run a damn might club with the love of his life, is that too much to ask?
Castiel stems his irritation and writes a quick reply under his desk, paper pressed to his leg, before folding the note back up and waiting until the professor’s back is turned to drop it onto Balthazar’s desk next to his own.
Accepting an offer for a better job was easy.
“Hello,” she says in a professional, almost bored voice, “how may I help you?”
Blushing at being caught daydreaming about his husband while staring at said husband, Cas just says, “Yes?”
only have the one mirror, in my bedroom, but it’s rather high, and I’m not sure you’re quite up to standing for that long yet.”
Dean eyes them hungrily, but still finds it in himself to ask, “Don’t s’pose you’d be open to bringing me a cup of coffee, too?”
it. He won’t let Cas change the way he dresses (because, Cas suspects, Dean knows it’s secretly a turn-on), but he’s stopped fighting or sleeping around, and he at the very least
It’s no trouble at all to get into the hospital. The Azure court offers some limited psychic powers. He’s already wearing a set of light green scrubs - memory alteration is often helped by a corresponding reality. The receptionist just gives him a bland smile while he signs in, persuaded by the very gentle compulsion not to notice him. She probably won’t remember him at all, and “Dr. Michael Smith” isn’t planning to do anything memorable today, anyway.
Castiel smiles. Flippant though she may be, Charlie is surprisingly fierce and earnest. Castiel considers her a good friend, and not only to Dean.
Dean wakes up easily, strangely enough. He’s comfortable and he feels clean. His leg hurts, but the dull ache is nothing compared to the hot agony he remembers.
into his mouth, and after hurriedly hushing him, proceeds to pound at that exact spot mercilessly. The sound of skin slapping against skin seems obscenely loud.
“Charlie!” Mr. W rounds the bar, smiling. He looks tired, like he has for a couple of weeks now, with shadows beneath his eyes. He’s been drinking more coffee, too, and more distracted.
“I’m sorry,” he says softly, doing his best to look honest and trustworthy. “I’m not trying to harm you or your pup, Castiel, nor am I keen on burdening you any more than I already have.”
Cas snorts inelegantly and revels in the laugh it pulls from Dean.
John announced his intention to prepare for retirement almost six months ago. He’d named Dean as his most likely successor, but it was still less than certain. The board would have to vote him on, though Dean was reasonably confident that they would.
Periods of lucidity, fugue states, periods of inability to communicate.
It’s possible, then, that his current discomfort is from the time he’s spent with Cas on his farm, isolated as they are. Or, perhaps, that any appreciative glances are no longer quite as welcome as they once were, courting Cas as he is.
“And what is the best case scenario?”
Cas doesn’t even stop to consider it. “Yes.”
But I know now, I did some thinking, just like you would, and I know he was just an experiment. You wanted to be good for me, you wanted to be sure.” The smile on his face is warm, kind, and absolutely devoid of any sanity that Cas can find. His hands start to tremble and breathing steadily is difficult.
Dean blinks. “Huh? For what?”
He saved Castiel, and Uriel murdered him.
There are so many things Dean wants to help Cas shoulder. Running the farm, living so close to a town that has ironclad negative opinions about them, raising Claire. This one, though, Michael’s demise and his final resting place, is one thing that Dean will take completely from his omega and carry on his own. Dean’s not so unused to the darker side of life, and he’ll gladly take this burden (light as it is, really) for Cas.
away from their home.
“It wasn’t-”
The bottom drops out from Dean’s stomach, and he stares at Cas for just a beat before his body catches up to the words, and he wastes no more time pulling Cas close to him.
It’s an echo, an answer to the promise he made to Cas the night before, and Cas keeps true to it.
what’s happened in his life to make him act this way? Who knows how he’s been hurt, that he would cling so to what was clearly a fantasy?
There is some shouting, some throwing things, and more than a few glasses are smashed. Finally, Castiel and Benny get Dean shut up in the back office with a bottle of whiskey and a demand to leave the opened wounds on his knuckles for Castiel to disinfect. Cas also tired to leave The Colonel with him, but Dean insisted that he wanted the big German Shepherd with Cas instead, because he “doesn’t trust that damn kid one bit.”
Mr. W is getting into it now, swinging Mr. N around wildly. Mr. N is laughing as he sings, more carefree than Charlie has ever seen him. She looks over to Anna, wide-eyed and wanting to share her surprise, but Anna is just
Cas eyes soften a little from the suspicion that had been in them. “Well, not unless you know how to sew. You’re too weak to work with any of the animals, yet, and I do think that if you tried that before you took a saddle to Impala, she’d trample you.”
Castiel sighs. “Charlie-”
“Yes,” Cas says simply.
Dean laughs again and leans forward to press a kiss to Cas’ cheek. Sam, sitting next to Charlie across from them, gags, and Charlie whips out her phone and snaps a picture before either of them can object.

He hums noncommittally and resumes worrying.
the kind of alpha that Dean has always despised. Too enamored with the strength and benefits nature gave him to worry about the fact that he did nothing to earn them, has done nothing to prove himself more or less worthy than anyone else.

is smearing onto his mouth, his chin.
She squeaks and drops the stack of menus she’d been gathering in her arms. Mr. N helps her, all stiff and stoic like always, and then neatly stacks them on the shelf just beneath the top of the podium.
Before he can spiral further into a panic, a voice from his nightmares answers, “Of course, Hannah. Let them in.”
(Once, early on, Asa propositioned Dean, knowing full damn well about Cas. He carried the black eye for a week, and never said another word about it. They’re still friends, but Dean doesn’t tell Adam about that.)
bad luck out there. It would be a shame to see a fella like yourself get hurt.”
still infuriatingly weak. Dean resolves himself to having an itchy, hairy face for a while.
His planning is interrupted by Dean’s warm mouth pressed to his. Cas doubts he’ll ever get over how natural it feels to kiss Dean, and is therefore thoroughly distracted until Dean pulls away.
he knows, but it must have been a while for Cas, and even so, he’s enjoying watching his omega squirm on his fingers
Castiel sits before Dean, whom he so wholly adores, and waits for his judgement.
He stops a few feet from them, though, his eyes going sharp and his posture tightening.
Cas laughs softly at Dean’s almost indignant response. “Of course, as well as a plow for them. But I don’t have seed, and couldn’t afford to purchase any. Even if I could, I don’t have a horse or a mule, and the fields are quite large. I can’t leave Claire alone long enough to tend them properly.” He stands and pulls the blankets back down over Dean’s freshly bandaged leg, then pats his knee over them. “Don’t you worry about us, Dean. I…” he tilts his head with a smile. “I appreciate it, I think. It’s been a very long time since someone has worried about us, but we make do. Another week or two and we’ll be in your dust cloud, I expect.” He smiles down at Dean as he gathers the rest of the supplies and makes his way to the door.
Actually, men like him have always made perfect marks, and it’s a bit of a fight to keep from falling into old habits as well as to keep from doing some posturing of his own
“Good,” she says, “terrible place, that. Putting a nice boy like you in suits all day. A shame, is what it was.”
Dean jerks down to look at the pup in surprise. Claire continues to play, unaware of her betrayal.
“Zeke,” Cas makes his voice soft, placating, “Dean and I have been together for a long time, it wasn’t out of nowhere. We just-”
Gabe blinks, then smiles a little and relaxes. Though he’s rather obnoxious and flamboyant, Castiel loves Gabriel like a brother, and he wonders if he should do a better job of showing it.
After dinner, they continue to move to the couch to watch movies or mindless TV together. The only difference is that now those nights are more apt to end with Cas rocking down on Dean, leaving sucking kisses down the line of his throat and driving Dean wild. The Colonel has stopped trying to sleep next to them on the couch and lies in his dog bed every night with a disgusted huff.
When he finally makes it to what he thinks is the right hallway, he’s thoroughly disgusted. While the lobby and the entirety of the ground floor are clean, well-lit, and as comforting as a place like this can possibly be, and presumably the floors above are the same, as soon as he reached this floor there was a distinct difference. Oh, it’s relatively clean, but nowhere near spotless - dust in the corners and cobwebs on the ceiling give testament to a lack of care. There’s a distinctly lonely, neglected feel to the place.
- Look at my lil' baby Dean, all grown up and whatnot.
and the implications are making him feel satisfied and possessive. However, his (no)
Castiel just smiles when Dean hits the doors to the physics classroom so hard they bounce off the wall and rebound back at him. Dean catches them so they don’t hit Cas, then drops them and puts his arm around Cas to take them out of the room. He seems uncaring about the yelp from the student behind them.
- Shout out to Dragon67 for spotting the Balthazar/Lucifer connection and pointing it out to me!
He does his best to put aside his brooding tendency for the evening, but in the back of his mind, that silent wail of agony emanating from the asylum plays again and again.
“Hello,” Cas says as he opens the door. “How can I help you?”
To boot, Dean has also encountered those omegas. Except for those who are desperately broken, nay of them wanted no reminder or acknowledgement of what they’d gone through. Cas is as proud as anyone Dean’s ever met.
Dean’s eyes are wide as he looks around, head swivelling as if on some sort of hinge. Though he hates it here, it reminds Castiel with a pang that he hasn’t had an opportunity yet to take Dean travelling with them. He promises himself that, once they’ve handled this Lightbringers nonsense, he and Dean will take the Impala and start driving, and they won’t stop until they’ve seen the entirety of this country and a couple more, to boot.
Balthazar is eyeing Sam with distaste from the other end of the table. “You know, all work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.”
In that moment, however, surrounded by most of his family and with the love of his long, long,
While he’s revelling, his phone buzzes, and he frowns down at it quizzically. Dean’s staring, too, and the room has gone silent.
Now Cas turns to look at Dean, tilting his head a bit in confusion. Dean looks as lost as he feels, standing next to the bed, hands lying limp; at his sides.
Dean is tense at his side, fingers tapping against the side of his leg. Castiel puts a hand on the small of Dean’s back, rubbing soothing circles there until Dean relaxes minutely.
“And…
“Good morning,” Cas says.
“James,” she says.
They’re criminals, pure and simple. Castiel should give all of them a wide berth.
you. You mustn’t let it bother you, Dean. You must hold your head high and ignore them, and… Well, it might be for the best if your visit is brief.”
Cas is standing just outside of the room, tears in his eyes. “Oh, Dean, I-”
Once he drops Michael’s body in, filling the hole goes much faster than digging it did. Once the soil has been replaced, Dean carefully tamps it until it’s level with the surrounding area, then spreads loose rocks, sticks, and leaves over the unmarked grave obsessively until it’s indistinguishable. Only once he’s satisfied that it will be nigh impossible for the body to be found does he settle a little ways away to eat the light meal Cas packed him to take today. His canteen is half empty, too, but he’s not worried.
“Hey,” he says softly, squeezing Cas’ hand in his gently. “I love you.”
“He and Michael were friends,” Cas says as he gently washes herbs from the garden. “He thinks that I…

“I don’t really have an active way to prove it, but I’m indestructible,” Lucifer says, more craziness spilling from his lips like it’s nothing.
Dean nods. “Oh?”
The arm around his shoulders tightens there to bring him to a stop. Dean smiles sunnily as a streak of red hair announces Anna’s presence. She barrels up to them and grins at Dean, eyes shining.
Dean is Castiel’s, without a doubt, which makes Sam his, too.
Despite everything, he feels a twinge in his heart for Zeke, who clearly needs help. With a man as reserved as Zeke has always been, who
Cas takes a sip of his mass-produced, subpar tea and looks up beseechingly.
Dean never has a proper answer to that.
Instead, the omega’s hands are occupied by a massive basket, full of small canvas bags that Dean’s nose tells him are full of rose petals. There are also several blooms still on their long, thorny stems wrapped in clean linen cloths. Cas places the basket on the table and looks at his pup, who seems unfazed.
- Merry Everything and Happy Always, my loves. May whatever holidays you celebrate be blessed and full of warmth. <3
Gabe grumbles but doesn’t argue. Across the little circle of chairs they’re all sitting in, Meg Masters rolls her eyes. “We done here, Clarence? I don’t want to hang around if y’all are just gonna make googly eyes at each other.”
It’s always been a foggy, nebulous plan for the future. Find someone, maybe get married, and he doesn’t
“Well, our alpha just told me that he's going to stay with us forever,” Cas says, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He’s whispering to the pup, but his eyes are just for Dean.
If he believes nothing else about last night, Dean believes that Cas wanted it just as much as he himself did, and that it was as good for Cas as it was for him.
Sam fixes his hair with a glower, but still asks, “How?”
Cas blinks away his thoughts and looks up at Dean, who’s smirking knowingly, and Jack, who looks expectant and cheerful, which is how he always looks.
“He would have called your husband, and I couldn’t let him. He’s a nice kid, I guess, but I’m

Claire’s eyes flash with something too fast for him to interpret. “... Yes…”

The girl knocks on the last door on the left. “Miss Naomi? James, Dean Winchester, and a guest are here to see you.”
“I find the idea of someone else turning you undesirable.”
But Dean told him to be still, and so still shall he remain.
no matter how much it feels like anxiety.
Castiel is nothing but proper and brisk, though, pulling away the bandage and using a clean cloth to wipe at the wound. The bullet must have hit him at an angle, since there’s a long burn along his thigh where the bullet grazed him before burying itself high in his thigh, just below his joint.

“It’s… Incredibly difficult to talk about.”
“Dean-”
to all of his classes. He’s cut back on smoking, especially since Cas won’t kiss him if he tastes like an ashtray. He’s still quintessentially himself, but he gives Castiel the control he needs by changing things that don’t matter all that much to Dean himself.
She looks down at her computer. “Just that your father wants to see you before your first meeting today, and you have a stack of memos to return.”
Dean winces. “How, ah, how did I get here? I’m sorry, I don’t-”
Gabe rolls his eyes. “Shut up,” he says fondly, and Castiel knows that he’s been forgiven. “C’mon, if we take a left down there we’ll walk by the asylum. Air’s bound to be soaked.”
She blinks once, twice, before replying slowly. “G’morning.”
it was you who couldn’t be out of the closet. And it was
Castiel frowns. “What’s wrong?”
Castiel knows that eavesdropping is terribly rude, of course, but when he realized that Charlie and Nick were talking about him, he was unable to decide if it would be more awkward to interrupt or to pretend he wasn’t there.
John’s eyebrows shoot to his hairline.
Instead, he looks down at his hands, fisted in the sheets nervously. “I, uh… Yesterday was…”
“Mornin’, gorgeous.”
“How’s it going up here?” she asks.

mean so much to him. Jody and Donna and how hard they’ve fought to get here. Gabe, with the damaged heart he doesn’t hide but does his damnedest to protect. Meg and Zeke, with their quiet, steady relationship and quiet, steady friendship to the others of the Shopping Center. Aaron and his bookshop and his insecurities. Missouri, who says cryptic things while feeding and caring for all of them. Even Ash, with his terrible hair and good heart and wickedly sharp intellect. Castiel loves all of them so very much, and he desperately wants to do right by them.
Every move each one of them makes is comfortable, warm, specifically designed for the other. They’re each a whole, complete person, but they complement one another so well you’d never be able to tell. The love shining in their eyes, even when they’re not looking directly at one another, it floors her every time.
“Z-Zeke?” Cas stutters. “What happened?”
With one last look at Dean Winchester and a silent promise that he’s going to raise the boy out of this perdition, Castiel follows her.

Castiel does not jerk awake this time. He awakens all at once, but he remains perfectly still save for opening his eyes.
Cas’ blush flushes darker fast and his scent goes haywire. Dean freezes.
Dean inhales sharply but stays calm at Cas’ side. He is, once again, intensely grateful that Dean has adjusted so well to vampirism. He doesn’t know how well he would handle this without Dean next to him.
“Of course,” Cas says haughtily.
Cas doesn't hesitate to go to Dean, who rather gratifyingly doesn't hesitate to open his arms and wrap them around Cas tight, burying his face in Cas' neck.
Love, possessiveness, obsession, and passion beat their way through Dean’s face in a fierce rhythm. He opens his mouth to express everything Cas makes him feel, just like he does every time they do this, but what comes out is a simple, “Love you, too, baby.”
- This chapter is a series of flashbacks, of a sort, from the crew's POVs.
Adam looks dazed. A vindictive part of Dean thinks
it appears that it’s what Cas wanted, too. At no point the night before did Dean see anything but a desperate, burning eagerness in his husband. Every touch was exquisite, tender,
Cas, however, has other plans,
Adam frowns. The expression makes him look familiar, somehow. “I’m not here for a job.”
Her smile remains firmly in place. “Do you have an appointment?”
“Hmm?”
He’s alone in bed. He gets up and dresses slowly, mechanically. His mind is racing, but he is certain.
- In case you were wondering, Lucifer and Balthazar totally run away together to track down the last of the Lightbringers and end them. Gabriel and Kali end up together, and when Balthazar doesn't want to settle down and Lucifer doesn't want to leave Balthazar, Luci gifts Gabriel with
“I… I told her to keep her money, that I would take my sister and go.”
“Well, Dean, I’m the sheriff ‘round here, my name’s Arthur Ketch. I’ve been hearing that you’ve been spending some time out at the Novak farm, is that right?”
it okay, okay? Shh, just tell me what’s wrong so we can fix it, darling, shh-”
It's telling as to Dean's state of mind when he doesn't so much as blush at the compliment. He just shrugs and lets his eyes fall to look down at Cas' chest. Cas allows it for now.
Cas melts into him a little and Dean holds him gently as he slowly eats his donuts, being careful of his lip. Cas doesn’t have a lot of weird little quirks, but donuts as comfort food was one of the first that Dean learned.
as Joshua was, as Joshua believed he could be.
“What’s wrong?”
Zeke is warming up to his subject even more, if that’s possible. “And then, just a couple of weeks later, I thought I’d catch the two of you leaving whatever little get-together he took you to. I thought if all three of us were together, alone, you’d see who you really loved, and who really loved
Dean fiercely wishes it was the middle of the day so he could lay Cas out in the sunshine to see every bit of him, or even that he was willing to separate from Cas long enough to light a lantern to see by. Since it’s not and he’d rather die than move even an inch away from Cas, he has to make do with sinking one finger into his omega and enjoying the way Cas’ bak arches and his breath catches.
Once they’ve cleaned up and the smell of stew is starting to drift through the house, Claire points out the piles of laundry.
“No?”
in those minutes, the way he looks and feels and smells. His orgasm washes over him gently, an inexorable wave that has him clenching as Cas pulls off just in time and finishes Dean with his hands, stroking until Dean is gasping with overstimulation.
After that, it’s a blur of clothes flying off, Cas’ desperate, bratty demands, and Dean going with the flow. They end up with Dean shirtless, on his back, with his jeans and boxers pulled down to mid-thigh. Above him, Cas’ shirt is unbuttoned and hanging loose, framing his thin chest and flat belly rather nicely. His pants and briefs are on the floor, where he has one foot braced. The other leg is wedged between the backseat and Dean’s hip.
“Cas,” Dean says softly, “you don’t have to-
“‘Charity suffers long and is kind,” Mr. N says, his eyes glued to Mr. W, “'charity envies not. Charity brags not itself, it is not puffed up.’”
Dean somehow got the impression that he is less, that he is unworthy. Unwilling to address this part of himself, he puts up a front, an almost unbreakable mask. Dean would rather pull out his own teeth than talk about his feelings, so he simply pretends they don’t exist.
He thinks of Dean’s whiskey-smooth voice in his ear, rasping, “You mine, Cas?”
“Yeah. All of this was Lucifer,” Dean says, reading Cas’ mind and waving a hand to indicate the bodies. “While we were in there, I guess he, uh, took care of everyone else.”
Before he can voice his panic, Cas sighs loudly. “Claire.”
Dean takes a deep breath. “I just… Look, when I quit my job, I wasn’t really thinking. I shouldn’t have done it without… Without talking to you first.”
And then it turned out that it
John Winchester smiles his “colleague smile” and stands. Dean hates the way that remote, impersonal expression looks on his father’s face.
It’s not-so-secretly his favorite day of the week.
Dean doesn’t need to hear any more. With a growl, he rolls them so Cas is on his back, his legs spread sweetly for Dean as he grinds down on his omega like he’s been dreaming about doing for
thank God. I mean, shit, I thought I… Well, no matter.” He smiles, self-deprecating and just a touch shy. Castiel is not going to make it out of this meeting alive. “I’m not either, obviously.”
“Of course,” Dean murmurs against his mouth, and then proceeds to chase all thoughts of anything outside of the here and now from Cas’ mind.
The next morning starts much the same as the one before did - Dean wakes up tangled up with Cas, in Cas’ room. There are a few things that are different, of course. They didn’t have sex the night before, so he doesn’t have any of that good soreness in his body that he did yesterday. His phone is on Cas’ nightstand and his clothes are in the laundry basket instead of strewn across the floor. Colonel is curled up at Cas’ back, where Dean is pressed to Cas’ front.
Not to say that Dean is casual about them, no. His easygoing facade is belied by the way his eyes are always locked onto Castiel, who preens under the attention. Castiel might get a little jealous (an understatement), but Dean gets downright
“-strange alphas-”
“Shh, Dean,” he soothes. “Go back to sleep. I’m not going anywhere.”
(Not Cas, never Cas. It still overwhelms him, the demands of working behind the bar, and his hands often tremble too much to reliably navigate all of that glassware.)
Dean wrinkles his nose. He’s patched himself and Sam up a fair number of times, but he’s never gotten used to the sight or smell of so much blood. He’s never had an infection, thank the gods, but he remembers his father getting one before he managed to make it back to a safehouse. His mother berated him harshly and the cabin smelled like a terrible, sweet sickness for over a week.
“Indeed,” Cas muses.
Confused, Cas asks, “Why?”
If he was capable of feeling anything at all, Cas would be wildly offended. As it is, he can hardly feel his
(See the end of the chapter for
After supper, a simple but rather delicious and filling rabbit stew that was also loaded with vegetables and spices, Castiel insists on changing Dean’s bandages. Dean tries to protest on the grounds of propriety, but at Cas’ dry, “And who, exactly, do you think bandaged the wound the first time?” Dean’s arguments die on his tongue.
“I think it’s time for pups to get ready for bed,” Cas says with an adoring smile.
“And why, pray tell, is it so unthinkable?”
“She’s quite the well-mannered young lady,” Dean offers with a wink to the pup. It doesn’t get the giggle he wanted, but she graces him with a tiny smile.
His hurried warning is cut off by his orgasm. He clenches his teeth against a scream, spilling into Dean’s mouth. Dean sucks on the head of his cock almost tenderly and continues working his prostate, prolonging his aftershocks torturously.
Balthazar, unfazed by Castiel’s obviously sour mood, just smiles. “Someone’s a little grouchy, eh? Missing your man?”
from that shithead kid you used to be?”
Probably wouldn’t work, anyway.
He takes it out to the woods behind the farm. He walks for a long time, until the sun’s position in the sky is much changed, before he feels comfortable stopping. It would be a
When Dean plays with her and her dolls, he tends to let Claire take the lead. Cas, though, Cas puts the dolls in sticky situations and has Claire play her way out of them. Even as Dean finishes washing up, he’s watching her learn to apologize gracefully, to settle a difficult argument, and that growling is not an appropriate response to being insulted (he has to stifle a laugh at that, but he’s successful). She learns to interact with others without ever leaving the little farmhouse (and without encountering the scorn she would surely receive in town).
Castiel examines Adam closely. While Dean was shouting and punching the bartop, Adam looked genuinely frightened. Moreso than the situation called for, Cas thinks. A kind of fear that lives outside of the fear for one’s physical safety.
She also knows that The Bunker is a good place.
he was happy being with a high school dropout bartender with anger issues, an unhealthy attachment to his car, who regularly had arguments with his dog, but he was. He was happy with frozen pizza and boxed mac and cheese while they watched soap operas in their underwear at Dean’s place. He was happy with walking The Colonel on brisk fall mornings with Dean, shyly reaching out to lace their fingers together and then beaming when Dean squeezed his hand and held on.
Cas laughs and shoos him out. “Go! Off with you! And take your dog, too.”
Claire stills, then nods slowly. Cas tugs her way from Dean, just far enough that she’s looking up at him.
when Dean was getting into trouble, like he doesn’t know that Dean’s not that kid anymore.
Dean laughs gently, not mocking, and pulls his
Dean frowns and stands from where he was sitting next to Sam at the breakfast table. “Cas?”
“Claire,” Castiel says from where he has appeared in the doorway, “I do hope you’re not bothering our guest.”
Sam tilts his head and examines Dean closely enough that it’s uncomfortable.
“Please, Dean?”
at him, goodness and affection almost pouring out of him.
The significance of those words has Sam’s eyes widening. “Wait, seriously?”
“As I have said, you are welcome to stay here, and I am happy to care for you, and you will owe me nothing but gratitude as you leave.” Castiel’s slender shoulders tighten, and his scent becomes sharper with anger and a hint of distress. “If I find out that you’re not who you say you are, however, Dean Winchester, you won’t live to meet your brother
Dean is silent, save for the occasional sniffle, for a long time. Cas holds him through it until Dean finally lifts his head. When he does, Cas pulls back just enough to cup that handsome face that he loves so much gently in his hands.
“Who did this, Cas?”
to the alpha. Maybe that was part of the reason Cas’ little pallet of blankets is in Claire’s bedroom, so close to her bed, but Cas not saying it out loud still means he’s trying to spare Dean’s feelings. Considering how mercurial the omega has been up ‘till now (not that Dean’s complaining), Dean will take hat he can get and be inordinately grateful.
During
“What about it?”
Dean scrubs at his jaw with his hands, revelling in the smooth feeling. “Thank you, Cas. I appreciate it.”
“I ran. I took Anna and Gabriel and we fled. I think we only got away so neatly because we had been so incredibly broken before then. Naomi didn’t see it coming, and we fled.
“It’s your birthday,” a jet engine voice says softly from next to him, interrupting his survey of the room. “Shouldn’t you be out there with your friends?”
He points to the phone. “That for me?”
Dean snaps, suddenly all business.
The smell of the body is both worse and better than Dean expected. It’s been years, so only a hint of real decay remains, but it’s enough to make him gag several times while he pulls the body up from the ground. He rewraps the canvas to make sure it’s secure before he moves it.
“I quit,” he says. He wants it to be firm and unshakeable, but his voice is shuddery and soft instead.
“Yeah, I’m the Novak whisperer.”
- The quoted verse is taken from the King James version of the bible. I believe different translations are very different, the oft-quoted "love is kind" verse instead.
Cas cries out softly before biting his lip and gripping Dean’s arms hard enough to leave little half-moon marks that Dean can admire and preen over later.
“Of course, Dean.”
Castiel feels his mouth drop open a little. “Wh-what?”
Cas smiles, because he knows, but is willing to play along. “You know I’ve always enjoyed having a third person in the house.”
She’s never met the boy, no, but she recognizes the ruthlessness, the calculating intelligence in his eyes. Hell, she sees it in her own eyes in the mirror every morning.
Dean blinks. It takes a moment for Cas’ offer to sink in.
Dean gambled with everything he’s ever known. He knew, he
When Anna’s pretty, delicate features come into sight, Cas has to concentrate on fighting the flashbacks away.
When he goes out to the bedroom, he doesn’t look at Dean at first. He goes directly to the dresser, drops the towel from around his waist, and pulls on a pair of briefs and flannel sleep pants. The silence is oppressive.
Their mother clenches her jaw, the only outward sign of her anger.
Anna, his assistant, dutifully checks the digital calendar she keeps for him. Anna is a painfully kind, sweet woman who Dean hired mostly to get her out of the sales department, which is a sexist boys’ club at
He’s maneuvered until he’s flat on his back, but he ignores the hands that guide him to a comfortable position and focuses on drinking deep. The warm liquid is burning him up and he can feel his insides shifting and flexing in a way he’s not familiar with. It scares him a little, but death scares him more, so he finds himself reaching up to clasp whatever it is
Alastair Rack is fired within the week. He never works as an educator again.
“Didn’t have to?” Frankly, Dean can’t stand to listen to Cas insist that he does all this work while Dean stays in bed. “I know, Cas, but I’m going a little funny in the head just sitting here.” He smiles easily. “‘Sides, it’s my leg that’s hurt. My arms are just fine, and my arms are all I need to do any skinning or plucking. C’mon, Cas, please?”
“I love you,” Cas whispers, “and
“Sure thing!” Jack says cheerfully. Cas thinks for the umpteenth time that Jack would be better suited to work outside of private security. He vows again to stop letting his own life distract him and talk to Jody about what else they can find for the boy.
Uriel rolls his eyes. “Just because you are too naive to see the right path doesn’t mean that all of us are so misguided. I follow Naomi gladly.”

“Those need to be separated, so Papa knows which ones need ‘broided and which ones need tailing.”
Dean rakes his other hand through his hair and snorts. “Yeah, just like the fucker to have a kid we didn’t know about. Shouldn't surprise me, I guess. Probably has another few of them running around.”
much. For appearance’s sake, we’ll have to…” Here he blushes, which Cas finds inappropriately delightful. “Well, we’ll probably have to move in together. And we’ll need to go on semi-regular dates for visibility, but I think that will be the extent of it. Might be overcautious, really.”
Silence all around him tells Castiel that either the rest of the fighting has stopped to watch them, or one side has dispatched the other. He spares a glance for Dean, who’s a bit more bloodied but is on his feet and observing solemnly, before looking back down at Naomi.
“We’re
The moment they’re close enough, Dean wraps his arms around Cas and crushes him to his big, solid chest. Cas immediately clasps Dean back just as tightly, tilting his head up to murmur soothing nonsense into his husband’s ear.
“I understand,” he says instead.

Dean tries to hold Cas’ hips still, but he moans when Cas wraps his fingers around Dean’s cock and pumps, smearing leftover lube around.
“Well,” Castiel murmurs to himself, “needs must, I suppose.”
Dean smirked.
“Joshua was an incredibly kind, understanding man. The humans who called themselves his flock, as per the word of the Lord, freely allowed him to feed from them, and allowed me the same when Joshua asked it. He insisted that both Gabriel and I both stay with him until our health was restored. After that, we both chose to stay there.

She just stares at him, and before either of them can say another word, the door crashes open to omit Castiel. The air floods with omega anger, agitation, and fear. Castiel rushes into the room to pull the pup up into his arms. She goes quietly, and Dean notices that Castiel takes care not to hurt her in any way even as he handles her abruptly.
Dean shrugs, still not looking up. “I just, uh... Graduation is in a few weeks.”
into his mouth.
you don’t need to be ashamed, it’s okay, it takes time for everyone. You taught me that.”
Cas whimpers. “Jack-”
Castiel is not good by reflex. He is not virtuous, or merciful, or kind.
he growls.
“Charlie said she and Ash are, like, seventy-five percent sure, which is almost a one hundred percent guarantee where those two are concerned,” Dean says easily. “I say we at least talk to the guy, scope him out, and if he’s not who we think he is, we at least have one guy to cross off the list.”
Castiel has had bad experiences with alphas, at least one, anyway. It’s rather obvious that there’s no mate running around here. Cas doesn’t smell mated, there’s no alpha scent, and there’s been no confrontational alpha breaking down the door. Which means that the omega is here, alone, with a small pup to care for and defend.
“Cas, I-”
All of the extra contact is
“Cas?”
“I’ll be expecting you.”
Castiel smiles at him as he ties off the bandage. “You have, and you’re quite welcome.”
Dean comes in while he’s struggling to focus, drying hair still damp from his shower. He’s silent as he tosses the towel into the hamper and pulls on a pair of briefs and pajama pants. Castiel watches him, is always watching Dean, and gives up the pretense of reading entirely. He assumes the silence is a product of the same nerves he’s suffering from until Dean seems to steel himself and comes to stand at the foot of the bed in front of Cas.
“In… In our way of
It’s surprisngly traditional, seeing as Cas normally ignores tradition altogether. It’s also surprisingly delicate, with lace on the sleeves and at the hem and neckline. While it’s a modest nightgown in a rich cream color, it still hints at Cas’ collarbones and stops just high enough that Dean can see his pretty ankles.
Instead of the relaxing, playful, flirtatious experience Dean was anticipating, they’re both tense and drawn. While Dean’s alpha arousal is certainly in the air, so is the sweet, almost cloying scent of omega arousal. Cas is just as affected as Dean is, and he can’t decide if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.
If it wasn’t so sad, it would be fascinating to watch Cas’ features close off. His back stiffens and his scent flattens into guardedness, wariness.
The heavy velvet curtain rises as the house lights dim. The school orchestra is sprawled elegantly across the stage, and Cas is set apart, front and center, violin already tucked beneath his chin.
The fog in his mind clears a little. “Cas, you’re not-”
Claire laughs in delight. “But we’ve eaten the same bread every day!”
When he finally turns to let his eyes fall upon Dean, his boyfriend is sitting on his own side of the bed, head in his hands, elbows resting on his thighs. Frustration, anger, and sadness are written in every line of his lovely body.
Not that you would know it, looking at Sam. The kid is wickedly intelligent, a bright young man who made friends quickly when he and Dean showed up two years ago. Sam is going to change the world, maybe even save it.
Sam’s bellow has Dean leaning over Impala’s neck and urging her to run faster. Somehow, impossibly, she does, and they manage to catch up to Sam and his big bay stallion, Wisdom.
A bit further away, it looks like Balthazar and Lucifer are having a hushed argument. Well, Balthazar is arguing, Lucifer is as unworried as he has been for the last two days, maybe even a bit amused. As Castiel watches, Bal seems to run out of steam. Once he’s quiet for a moment, Lucifer reaches out to touch his arm, briefly at first, then curling around Bal’s bicep almost familiarly, warmly. Bal relaxes into the touch and Lucifer smiles.
Dean wants to be nice to the kid, he really does, but it’s been a damn long day and an even longer forty minutes.
It eats at Charlie.
He’s no better when he gets into the office that day. He gets through a chunk of his emails and weekly reports from various departments he oversees, but his heart’s not in it. He finds himself halfway through a page without any recollection at all of what was on the first half. He daydreams about lunch, which isn’t
Castiel thinks of Dean for a beat. He thinks of Dean’s leather jacket, his ridiculous car, the eyes fit for a Disney princess. Of cheeseburgers and a calloused hand holding his own and of rolling his eyes when Dean insists on carrying his books to class.
Things…
Cas hums again. “For?”
Finally, solid ground for Castiel’s overwhelmed mind to stand on. “We need your help,” he tells Lucifer. “I think they’re going to be gathering a show of force. I think having you there to negate what Naomi says will… Lessen the bloodshed.”
- This is me letting you know that
So, really, it’s no wonder that Dean (who does, after all, have some experience with overworking one’s self) notices and decides to do something about it.
Mr. W is snorting, but his hand curls around Mr. N’s almost tenderly, and Charlie’s cheeks start to ache at how wide she’s smiling.
He thinks it has much more to do with the hissed gossip and not-quite-whispers of Cas’ name that follow him wherever he and Impala go, though.
The same place Dean has his.
“Yes, well,” Balthazar says firmly before Gabriel can agree enthusiastically, “that will have to wait until after we deal with the Lightbringers.”
silly!”
“May I have a word with you?”
The way Dean had looked when he’d talked about Cas made Benny think of Andrea, how Andrea had seen the best in people no matter what, even when she’d been proven wrong. How she’d urged him to do the same.
He and Kevin dissolve into excited chatter about the class, but Dean looks right over at Castiel, who makes sure to keep any smugness or satisfaction off of his expression.
alpha,” Cas growls back impatiently. Hearing that gravelly voice get even deeper, soaked in desire, sends a shudder up Dean’s spine, and he’s suddenly helpless to do anything but obey.
hands on his flesh away from the forefront of his mind. He’s only a little successful.
Dean smiles into the darkness as he listens to Chupacabra and Rugaru curl up next to one another on the dog beds in the corner (that won’t last long, the minute Dean falls asleep they’ll be up on the bed next to him). The Colonel, as always, is on the bed next to Cas, already settled in for the night.
“Hello again,” he says with a smile.
Or so he’d thought, anyway.
we could have.”
he thinks, looking over at the dog in question, who’s staring up at Cas with devotion in his eyes and the hope that Cas has treats in his heart.
“Dean! Are we all done helping now?”
Many Azure Court vampires prefer fear, claiming precisely what Gabriel does, that the vibrant taste of it remind them of being human. The argument holds little water for Castiel, since they’re all perfectly capable of eating and tasting regular food
Claire’s smile is bright, another blessing. “I know all of that!”
Cas raises his own eyebrow. “How can I deny what you haven’t accused me of?”
Cas is gently applying bandages to Dean’s leg again (another thing Dean has added to Cas’ long list of chores, boiling and laying out bandages to dry after they’ve been soiled, making the salve for his wound, caring for Dean’s useless ass). He hums thoughtfully, but shakes his head.
“Come on, alpha,” Cas murmurs when he’s done. “Off to bed with you.”
“I need you to be sure, Dean.”
life could be.
He’s content to lay here for a bit before he has to rally himself to actually move again.
A mutual understanding passes between them and Castiel nods. “As am I, Mrs. Winchester.”
themselves, for God’s sake, but they’re obvious nonetheless.
he reassures himself. He finally lets himself succumb to sleep again, unworried.
Cas is complicated.
Finally, the pup nods. She sends one more furtive glance at Dean, then buries her little face in Castiel’s neck. Castiel, on the other hand, doesn’t look back at all as he carries his pup out of the room and closes the door firmly behind them.
“Now you listen here, young man. I’m not letting you take that boy
“Yeah, let’s go back. I wanna hit that lane with all the candy houses again, scare us up some kiddos. God
Dean growls.
Cas mewls in response, beyond inconsequential things like words and sentences.
Dean lets him hide his face in his shoulder until he recovers his composure, but there is no way to hide their besotted smiles for the rest of the night.
Uriel. There is no truth to it, it’s merely a tool we use to keep one another in line. A… A flimsy origin tale meant to comfort those of us who want roots, who want history. The First isn’t real.” He frowns. “And even if he was, there’s no
it here, godsdammit, and he likes being with Cas and Claire.
“I know they’re together, but I guess I don’t get it.”
Everyone stands and puts their chairs in stacks against one wall of the little coffee shop as they chat amiably. Cas lets the sound wash over him and soothe some of his uncharacteristic anxiety.
“I’m sorry,” he says again as Castiel begins to smear more of the mysterious salve onto his leg. It burns and tingles, which makes Dean hiss, but it smells like herbs and plants, and he can feel the pain abate in just a few moments. “It must have been pretty disgusting to deal with me when I rode up.”
Luckily, Dean seems to be thinking clearly, at least.
"Will you let me take care of him now, my love? Please?"
His eyes have been closed forever, now, and moving is something he distantly remembers as an option. He slumps forward, completely unable to control his descent. He’s vaguely grateful for the cold bands that keep him from falling more, falling forever in darkness.
Claire’s heavy suspicion doesn’t lighten at all. “Help Papa with what?”
Zeke beams. “Of course, Castiel.
pleases the alpha in Dean. He didn’t stalk and hunt the goose, maybe, but he’s providing food nonetheless. He’s proving that he’s a good alpha, that he can feed the little family
“It looks much better than it did when you first got here,” Castiel says as he gently but thoroughly cleans the wound again. He’s wiping away bits of salve that have dried, revealing a relatively simple wound that nonetheless is still bleeding sluggishly. The omega looks satisfied. “Blood instead of pus is quite the improvement.”
Cas’ scent is lightly amused as he concentrates on treating Dean’s wound. “I don’t know if I would describe what you were doing as ‘riding,’” he says wryly, “but you weren’t so bad as all that. You were quite incoherent, of course, but you were obedient, at least.”
Eventually, a tug at his sleeve brings him back to the present. Dean, still torn and bleeding a bit (although this blood is much darker, he’s fed more recently), is looking at him with concern shining in his green eyes.
She doesn’t share her concerns with anyone else. She wants to, she really does, but everyone feels the same way she does about Mr. W and Mr. N’s dogs, and she’s just not willing to freak anyone else out.
At first, of course, it was that perky, tight ass encased in expensive slacks that caught his eye. The pale, smooth expanse of Cas’ neck that’s just begging to be marked up by Dean’s teeth. And,
“I…” Well, it
Alarm bells start going off in Castiel’s head. “For what, precisely?”
Dean, who he loves
- I truly can't tell you how much I appreciate you guys going on this wild ride with me.
He mirrors his mother’s movement. He meets her eyes. “Yes, mother?”
“Castiel.” Anna’s voice is tight with emotions. “Castiel, Joshua…”
Dean clears his throat a little. “Uh, like I was saying, as far as being married, I don’t think we’ll need to entangle ourselves
Castiel has tried to be patient. He is aware that self-esteem problems should be handled gently, with kid gloves. He knows that only patience, love, and time will make Dean see himself as Cas sees him, as smart and loyal and irritatingly wonderful.
up his inner thigh, where the flesh is pale as cream and so, so soft. “You’ll forget everything but my name and my knot, sweetheart.”
So instead of voicing his thoughts (or worse, swearing to protect both of them from harm forever), Dean grins at Claire. “Everyone belongs in the kitchen, pup. The kitchen is where the food is.”
when you broke up, I realized you weren’t ready to be out of the closet yet, so I kept quiet too.”
“Absolutely not,” Cas says through smiling teeth as the smelly board member ambles away. “You are not permitted to leave me here alone under any circumstance.”
comes along.”
"When, then?" He asks. He will deny to his dying day that his heart has picked up a fast beat, thudding against his ribcage in a delightfully uncomfortable rhythm.
Dean rolls his eyes, but his expression is warm and fond. “Yeah, yeah. What do I get if I pass?”
Castiel comes forward the rest of the way until he’s standing in front of Uriel, his old comrade. “Tell me what I’ve found is mistaken,” he says, almost pleading. “She cannot possibly still be looking for the First.”
